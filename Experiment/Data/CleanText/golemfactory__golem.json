How long does it take to download resources that are initially placed on only one machine?\n. In my opinion it makes no sense to support both. We will probably add whole python directory to a final app anyway, so it should be just Python 3. \n. There are many problems with combination of Twisted, Python3 and Windows. \nTwisted is claiming: \"Ideally we could omit a number of them: twisted.python.win32 - windows is not a target platform for the initial release.\"\nSource: https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Plan/Python3]. \nSome functions are badly tested, there are fixes for some of them but not necessarily active in official releases. We can try to patch twisted by hand:  (change file to open, change implements to @implementer), but it will not be tested and may lead to unexpected behaviours on windows. \nThere is much better library for Python3 called asyncio, but moving to this new platform may be time-absorbing. \nI propose to stay with Python2  during development of Python render but we may return to this topic in the future.\n. No. We have a first prototype version, but it should further developed. First we must change current simple version to fit payment system model, then we may make further experiments. \n. I'm closing this issue for know. We will create a new one with updated description after we prepared task & transaction protocol description. . https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/wiki/Golem-Task\nhttps://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/wiki/Task-Definition-Framework\n.

No, he may try to connect with nodes that are with specifi distance from him (or at least get information about them), ie. belong to specific kademlia bucket. \n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/wiki/Verification\n. There is still a problem with running luxrender test on windows + we probably should add more tests when we receive some examples scenes.\n. GUI project: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1B9rJaotPdPmu2rud7rLjj3RjxsWFI7V3wHwBZwrhlQo/edit?usp=sharing\n. This should be part of bigger process of redesigning tests.. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/wiki/Installation\n. It's a part of bigger task of replacing client_id with key_id in all Golem classes: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/issues/41\n. Pros:\n- It's really working! Yay!\n- Probably much safer and less buggy than our code. \n- We don't have to worry about nats and private network for sending resources.\n- Trendy technology that probably will get much better in the next two years. \nCons:\n- Much slower for local computations, which make \"quick\" and simple local tests a nightmare. \n- Much slower for very small data. \nConclusion:\nLocal tests are not typical use cases and our old methods of resource sending won't be much quicker for nodes in different private networks. So let's keep it,\n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/103\n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/96\n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/322\nFurther tasks: #324, #325\n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/68\n. Is this one finished or are we planning to add something more here?\n. We may remove RSA or leave if it for test purpose. It was added to test if auth methods are general. \n. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-rd/wiki/Task-Timeouts. Typical micropayment channels in bitcoin are working well and are used in a few applications already, eg. for video streaming, network bandwitch sharing. We already know that they are created for one-to-one scenarios and are not useful in Golem.\nLightning network may be useful but is still in a very early development stage. There are few naive implementations, but they are not safe and not efficient. Nobody knows how to solve routing problem in a proper way. I also recommend article: https://chrispacia.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/lightning-network-skepticism/ which describes many problem with this solution. \nAnyway, payments channels in a current state-of-art are completely unuseable for Golem.\n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/wiki/ethereum\n. Hydrachain is nice solution but it seems to be created for small networks where all voting participants are known (or at least their number - to check whether 2/3 of nodes has voted). It may not be suitable for dynamically changing real world network.\n. Further discussions about interface changes should be move to golem-design & golem-electron. . It will be useful, but some people don't trust upnp and may not want to use application that uses it. For example what if should they do if situation like this: https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2015-10-12-upnp-vulnerability repeates? \n. - Computation on task computer should be stopped when user kill or exit golem.\n. Remember to check wiki\n1) finished_computatation is a question, computation_finished information. Do you have better ideas for names? \n2) Maybe get_next_subtask?\n3) In current tasks there is no difference. We can imagine some scenarios where it may be a difference, but in most cases it should mean the same. \n. 1) Personally I prefer react_to_computation_finished (convention with verb), but other proposition is also good. \n. Important changes:\n- app_cfg is a little bit nicer\n- client_id => node_name\n- resource server is indexing resource peers by key_id instead of client_id\n- p2pserver is indexing all peers by key_id instead of client_id\n- tasks are indexing known client by key_id instead of client_id\n. I change task specification (see title). https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/81\n. Seeds should be given in separated file that is kept in new config directory.  After successful connection with some nodes their addresses may be added to seed file. \nSeed from config should be taken away and replaced with option \"connect to node\".\n. default dir should be DEFAULT_ROOT_PATH = os.environ.get('GOLEM'). Can you please check it on Linux after configuration changes from this pull request?\nAnyway, it should be always corrected to absolute path, so that's the first thing that must be corrected. \nSecondly, where do we want to put this file when we remove GOLEM variable? In AppData?\n. Fixed.\n. Could you add short description to this task? I don't remember what it was about and I don't know if it's still important/valid.\n. Yeah, thanks for finding that. I've added a quick fix. \n. Well, in fact, we don't need all_peers structure at all. General information about peers in the network should be kept in PeerKeeper, about open sessions in peers and about peers with whom we may connect in the future in free_peers. This list was never really used. I'll remove it completely. \n. I make a quickfix in develop branch.\n. I thought that there may be some unpredictable problems with verificaiton or preview generation. But there weren't any and adding rendering tasks from .gt files was easier than adding dummy. So I'll just mark it as duplicated. \n. On windows there will be problems with levedb (required by pyethapp). There are few (but pretty old) unofficial forks that should build on windows, but they're not exactly working. I may try to search for some better implementations later. \n. I don't think it's the good idea to move it to golem. \n- golem.nsi should be moved outside, with setups, dockerfiles, etc. \n- Other files should be moved to examples.tools.\n- Alternatively make_package may be left in golem.tools, but it's not really part of a Golem, it's just useful to copy golem files, for Update Other Golems task. \n. Looks good, thanks. \nMaybe we should move examples.tasks to gnr.task.code or something similar? \n. Jakie s\u0105 potrzebne warunki na flma, \u017ceby zadanie si\u0119 wznowi\u0142o?

Can you add some simple tests for new functions? \n. I've added str method instead.\n. The basic version of draft is ready. Things that should be changed:\n- Some payment data should be part of Golem state. They should be saved in database and recover after application restart.\n- Only newest payments should be loaded with possibility to load more. \n- There should more information about computing / requesting node, maybe after double clicking the row.\n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem-docs/issues/3\n. Should be developed further in the future, when we define all requirements.\n. It's just something like that right now: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8jXV0W-_NcWell0dHljTzFfTkE/view?usp=sharing You can sort columns. My vision: There will be a button in transaction field (or link) that will allow you to see proper transaction in blockchain. There should be also added column with date. \nIncome tab: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8jXV0W-_NcWcDJPSl9id0ttcVU/view?usp=sharing\n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/115\n. Things to think about in the future: How are we going to solve the problem with some functions that should be called on computing nodes? It's not necessary, but it causes a lot of redundancy. \n. There are a few problems with this solution.\n1) The file for test engine are created in different directory than task result, so the first .flm is in different directory. Therferore first subtask always failed. They should be created there because checking whether new files are created in test directory is what test engine is basically doing. \n2) Next tasks pass the verification. Does it mean that the first flm, which failed the verification is now a basic flm for comparing other?\n3) In development phase we may want to add tasks without running tests. \n. Blender and Lux are already running in Docker. We need also a simple docker container with python and the move Dummy Task to Docker. \nWe still don't now what to do with VRay, PBRT and 3dsmax.\n. Bug123 seems to be fixed.\nBut there is a problem with new .log files. We can send them if they are empty (we can send no results at all then): https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/issues/129\n. Last commit fixes https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/issues/123 but we can't merge whole branch until we solve #129.\n. print_progress is fixed for FileConsumer, but similiar functions are in FileProducer, DataConsumer and DataProducer. We must fix them all (or add some parent class).\n. This one is no longer valid, because we've decide to use IPFS instead of resouce network. \n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/wiki/Blender here are links to benchmarks , also to one added by Todd. Todd's scene are available by Dropbox account, check slack for credentials.\n. Todd McIntosh wrote: Multiple render passes (Colour, Ambient Occlusion, Shadow, Vector, UV, Emission, Glossy) \u2013 output to single\nMultiLayer OpenEXR frame file or multiple PNG image sequences\n. Blender cache generated on requestor machine can be added as normal Blender resources. This mechanism should be used to render simulation (fire, particles, smoke, etc.). Piotr Ar\u0142ukowicz wrote:  Blender can compare files using nodes also, which is just a _mathematical absolute difference between two pictures. I can be easily normalized, and the image which is the difference can be produced. This is not a numerical value however, and we can think about introduction some measures here. \nWe should check whether this method may give as better results than PSNR.\n. I'm merging this branch, even though there are still some doubts, because there are some useful features. We may come back to ethereum address class design during ethereum integration.\n. This value is only used as a string, so it's also possible to make a fix in tests and not in function code. But we may need to want to use number in the future so changing a function may be a better solution. \n. Sorry, I've changed that to a same value that I used in asserLess below. It's probably much too huge, but it doesn't really matter here. Check if it works.  https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/commit/3e1421f51d9cdf51fefabaf02e87721779ea2ca0\n. I thought that 10000 is a very safe estimation. Hm, ok, so we may just save get_dir_size for an empty folder and than check whether new sieze is at leasto for 50000 greater than empty dir size. \nBut do you know whether test in lines 38-43 is safe in that case? I add there a new file to which we don't have access and try to check whether get_dir_size doesn't change much (because it can't check new file size).\n. And again.... (on Magda's Linux so, it's not a windows issue this time). \n```\n____ TestDirSize.test_dir_size\n_______\nself = \ndef test_dir_size(self):\n    with self.assertRaises(OSError):\n        get_dir_size(\"notexisting\")\n\n    self.assertFalse(os.listdir(self.testdir))\n    empty_dir_size = get_dir_size(self.testdir)\n    self.assertIsInstance(empty_dir_size, int)\n\n    with open(self.testfile1, 'w') as f:\n        f.write(\"a\" * 20000)\n    os.makedirs(self.testdir2)\n    with open(self.testfile2, 'w') as f:\n        f.write(\"b\" * 30000)\n    size = get_dir_size(self.testdir)\n\n    self.assertGreater(size, empty_dir_size)\n    self.assertGreaterEqual(size, 50000)\n\n    self.assertGreater(get_dir_size(get_golem_path()), 3 * 1024 * 1024)\n\n    if not is_windows():\n        os.makedirs(self.testdir3)\n        with open(self.testfile3, 'w') as f:\n            f.write(\"c\" * 30000)\n        os.chmod(self.testdir3, 0o200)\n        new_size = get_dir_size(self.testdir)\n        self.assertGreaterEqual(new_size, size)\n\n        errors = []\n        get_dir_size(self.testdir, report_error = errors.append)\n\n\n      self.assertEqual(len(errors), 1)\n\nE           AssertionError: 0 != 1\n\ntests/golem/core/test_fileshelper.py:53: AssertionError\n========== 1 failed, 143 passed, 18 skipped, 3 error in 65.83 seconds\n==========\n```\n. @magdasta Did it ever happen again?\n. This issue may no longer be valid, we should check if problem still occurs. \n. Hm, so it's a feature not a bug :) It was more of a problem befor when tests used to left some unwanted files inside repo. Running with sudo and moving files doesn't sound like a good idea. I'd suggest we ignore it. \nCan you just add a comment here that build.sh only works if repo directory is clean, ie user has access to all files?\n. Task results are placed here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8jXV0W-_NcWa0ZOTTR0QUxXZTQ\n. I don't think it's worth doing further tests.  Conclusions are:\n- if the scene is \"simple\", ie. it doesn't have many textures, files and object that should be loaded the we can split in 1000 or more parts without any significant delays. \n- if the scene is \"complicated\", ie. it requires a lot of time to be loaded, we shouldn't split into more than ~ 100 parts. \n  Maybe we may try to esitmate how long does it take to load the scene during first benchmark test?\n. From logs it doesn't seem like it doesn't receive files. We have: \n\nFile data receiving 100 %                       2016-02-12 17:50:47,399 - golem.network.transport.tcpnetwork - INFO - Receiving file asdsad50001.exr, size 1730\nFile data receiving 100 %  \n\nAnd then it tries to pay for properly verified task. Are those .exr files saved in master's res directory? Maybe there is a problem with extension (lack of extension) or problem with putting images together?\n. Looks great, but we still should consider possibility of sending check for someone else and receiving a percantage of the prize. \n. Duplicate of: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/issues/174\n. Fixes: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/issues/164\n. Imunes tests have to be rewritten / changed, so this issue is probably not important any more. . @magdasta Is it still an issue or is it fully solved with new resource management?\n. This one may be solved at the same time as this https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/issues/333.\n. @banasiakadam60 Is this one finished?\n. Works really well and looks nice! There are some tests needed and then we can merge it. \n. @magdasta This is finished, isn't it?\n. We should also write this information in log (INFO severity), RPC call may also be a nice addition for debugging process. . https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/285\n. It looks like tga files aren't close properly and the test cannot remove in tearDown. Adding \"img.close()\" doesn't help. \n. I don't think you should spend time on this right now. Let's just remove TGA from this test. We may add it back in the future, when we find out that someone is really using this format. \n. We should also remember about restrictions from user config, ie max memory usage, max disk usage, max num cores.\n. See the resource management section: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/wiki/Docker\n. There aren't any new features - only changes which allows Blender and Luxtask defined in GUI to run as docker files. \nSorry for the \"id\" rename, I just couldn't resist :( \n. Can we connect this task #239?\n. We're going to use old interface so functionality connected with this issue is not relevant any more. . LocalComputer is suppose to run some docker containers when task that was defined on this machine requires it (to run benchmarks, tests, verify or join computation, whatever). Most of the code comes from our old TaskTester. It prepares directories, resources and callbacks  and starts DockerThreads. Do you have a better idea how to do it?\nIt's here because it was needed to run merge for luxtask (and wasn't really needed early) and right now is not used by other classes. \n. How can we check if it's really working? What should happen if we run again CI tests on this branch, docker container won't be build again? \n. TestEthereumTransactionSystem.test_init fails - can't remove test dir - chaindata is used. Same problem with EthereuClientTest.test_client. \n. Seems to be working :+1: \n. Why? Shouldn't it be a user's concern?\n. Maybe we should just create an empty file after the task was started and then we may just warn that the file will be overwritten and ask user if he really want to do this. \n. Previous assumptions: ~ 5 cents per hour, ie 0.006 eth (with current prices). \n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/wiki/Installation\n. 1. What do you suggest to make it less \"weird\"?\n2. Fixed, check please. \n3. It shouldn't make the window much bigger. Can you send me some additional screenshots, how it looks at the beginning and what happens after showing advance option and then after hiding them?\n4. Yeah, of cource, also gnradmmain.py and some other classes. But I was thinking about doing this as a separated task / PR, because it's a lot of work. Is it ok? \n. \nI checked the version with task specific options on the right and advance on the bottom but it makes the window too high and is much less logical for me. \nAnyway, it's pretty strange why you have your form labels aligned to the right. In my app it's aligned to the left and it's set that way in the form layout. \n. This task is connected with that one #182 \n. - [x] Version Golem docker images, e.g. golem/blender:0.1.\n- [x] Do not build the image again if already available.\n- [ ] ~~Cache built images on CircleCI: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/254/commits/1830f046c3d3d8baa4843e1b420cc0939197e528.~~\n  Cache doesn't seem to speed up builds very much (they still have to be loaded from ziped files).\n. Simple version: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/tree/golem_version \nTo make it better we should remove version from config and hardcoded it somewhere in the app. Than we should use this version as default version for task_base.\n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/293\n. #301\n. I think I prefer the first one. \nAnd how can we organize  tasks / plugins?  Should we keep it as it is now, with general directories that keeps different parts of task, ie:\n- task where we keep tasks logic,\n- ui where we keep task specific widgets,\n- customizers where we keep widgets' logic,\n- scripts where we keep executable code?\n  Or alternatively we may keep all task related components in separate director, eg. blender directory containing files like widget.py, customizer.py. Maybe it will make adding new tasks easier. \n. https://github.com/outsideris/slack-invite-automation\n. Test version:\nhttp://94.23.17.170:3000/\n. Benchmarks in the preferences tab are correctly run and their new values are saved properly in the config file. But if user click \"change button\" which is supposed to save a new config, the benchmarks value is reset to zero and those zeros are save in the config file. \n. It seems like there are some problems with test_paymentprocessor.py. I'm guessing that this branch is just too old. @magdasta Can you rebase develop or merge it into this branch and then check if payment test is still an issue? \n. Hm, you're probably right with the names. I'll change it later. \nWhat do you mean by static description? Task definition (like in gt file)?\n1) User defines timeouts for his task and subtasks. \n2) When user start a task, a task timeout is changed to deadline. Subtask timeout is not changed. \n3) When a computing user gets a subtask to compute than subtask timeout is changed to deadline. \nDo we agree on this? \n. 1. Names are fixed, points in times are now deadlines. \n2. All deadlines are in UTC. \n3. Computing node get a subtask with a deadline. \n4. Task state \"failure\" is changed into \"timeout\", so user would now what really happened. \n. Task timeouts changes are not allowed. Good idea!\n. It's forbidden. . Let's close it. When we get more feedback about interface / plan the new one we will think again about this. \n. #351 \n. It's not missing. I guess the reason is that it takes the list of all dockerfiles and build containers in that order. It's usually alphabetic and base is before blender but the documentation claims that the result of os.listdir is in arbitrary order.. \nSo. We can fix that easily \"for now\" by building base container first and put other containers in different directory but we should think how to make a good containers hierarchy in the future. \n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/340 Is it ok for now? \nUntil we will have a better environment manager.\n. How are they incorrect? Can you add more details?\n. Ugh, right that's terrible. Let's switch off sorting for this table (maybe we'll try to add this feature back in the future). \n. #351\n. Isn't this one solved?\n. #351 \n. It's working the problem are probably connected with delay when application is really busy. Solving this issue may be help: #197 \n. \n. Somewhere in between self.preview-file_path is changed from a representing each frame to a single file.  As  a result self.preview_file_path[num]is interepreted as a single character of a string.\n. Sorry, it is properly set, only I choose the wrong scene file. \n. User can disconnect with stop golem button. . Solved in #362\n. Solved in #362\n. Resolved in #362\n. It looks like it's a little bit quicker, but there may be problem if we change Dockerfiles. But we will need a better solution for docker management, anyway, so I guess it's sufficient for now. \n. Resolve in #362\n. Does this problem is in develop version or in package version? It was supposed to be fixed here: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/issues/363? Did you run 'setup.py develop' or 'setupy.py install' after pulling new commits? \n. @mfranciszkiewicz I cannot recreat this error, on clear kubunt 16.04 installation everything looks normal, same after installing libqt4-dev (4.8.7).  Can you add more information about system / configuration / package version?\n. * [x] Check again behaviour of subtask after it was restarted. Is the list above up to date?\n [ ] Prepare note that described workflow on R+D wiki\n [x] Check if behaviour on new GUI & from CLI is the same\n* [x] Ask @lukasz-glen about compatibility of current behaviour with his research. This one is connected with: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/issues/210\n. TODO: Find out if it's possible to turn off compositing in post processing with python script.\n. This probles were caused by postprocessing functions. If we turn off compositing by default for tasks that are split in part, than the effect should not occur. . It would be good to block \"test task\" button just after the test is started (so if someone close testing window, he won't be able to run test again). Same should be done with the recount button. \nOr maybe even whole \"new task\" form should be disable while testing took place. \n. Only if the test hang out completely. But then it may be impossible to run another test (because test folder will be blocked), so user will have to restart Golem to add a new task anyway. \n. Are you able to add some tests quicklyl and resolve the conflicts? It would be nice to merge this branch soon. \n. Just merge develop into this branch - make just step 1 form resolving conflicts instruction and then push the results here. \n. vboxapi module is required on windows package.\n. Seems to behave nicely! But maybe we should remove the frame from the preview? \n. Yes, looks better in my opinion. \n. Well, develop branch is still working, but doesn't connect to external nodes on purpose. \nBut UGH. This merge is going to be massacre. I was sure that packaging branch is merged regularly with develop :/ \nAny ideas how we can solve this problems and made mammoth merge? \n. Note: we should remember to change node_name variable in gnrapplicationlogic (if #444 is merged).\n. Fixed. Those functions should not have handle_key_error modifier (subtask_id is checked on the higher level).\n. It's very unclear what new options does. Some explanations and better default value is a must. \nAdditionally, it's a very specific options strongly connected with \"frame render tasks\". So it should be in task specific options (and only for Blender). Also leading zero should not be part of task_definition but element in options (renderer_options) in definition.\n. I'm not sure (3 or 4)? My problem with default 0 is that I'm not sure if I should write \"000\" or \"3\". \nPotential problem with max(definition.leading_zeros, max(frame_numbers)) is that you're calling it two times: in customizer (ok) and in blender task script. Blender task script works only on small subset of frames, so it this two methods may generate completelly different results.\nIt may not be a problem - there's a chance that blender finds max frame number in the full scene, so the final file will have proper name, but please check it. \n. As you wish. I don't like the idea of additional checkbox, but I'm not sure what's better.\n. Ok, checkbox looks nice. One additional suggestion: maybe you can change name 'leading zeros' to 'pad to length' or something like that? \nProblems:\n- Subtasks results are named properly, but final pictures have old names. For example part of the subtask result has name frame_5_00005.exr, but final picture has names frame005.exr. \n- Subtasks numbers in final frame numbers are unnecessary (and sometimes plain wrong), so output file name for that task should be frame_00005.exr and not frame_5_00005.exr. This subtask number is only userd to distinct different part of frames received from computing nodes. \n. I have a few more ideas how to improve it (maybe we can replace padding GUI elements with Blender-like \"#\" notation in output names. I'll try them out soon. \n. Alternative approach. User define output file name for frames with \"#\", ex. \"output_image_#####_ver_1.PNG\". It's compatibile with Blender approach, so it may be more natural for the users. If you don't like it and prefare previous version with GUI, feel free to reverse the last commit. \n. We must change start task method just after this update, start task just after add (and remove start task button and context menu method) or made button and method not enabled just after click. \n. Seems to work now, but I'm not sure if it's the best method to do this or the best function name. Feel free to change it to something nicer. \n. Was it on package version or develop version? Can you send us the full log? \n. Yep, please try to reproduce it, because we haven't seen recently.\n. I think it can be merged after moving this one function.\n. 1. They were caused by typo. But that's a good example - we should add some validation function for important subtask parameters before we start computation (or send them to the network). I'll make a sepearate issue for that. \n2. Done!\n. Check this out: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem-docs. Is this what you had in mind? \n. It's private right now, but we'll open it when we're ready. \n. #488 seems to solve the problem and is less problematic. But I'm leaving the branch open, maybe we will need to use this method later.\n. 1) I got an error after starting: QFormLayoutPrivate::setItem: Cell (4, 1) already occupied, \n2) \n\n3) Default task name is not shown in new task form (but later added properly to the tab). \n4) I would change column order, but I'm not sure which one may be the best. Maybe we should ask Julian about it later. But it's not very important now. \n. Can you try to merge develop into this branch and then check if it passes the tests?\n1) There are two price fields, remove the one at the top. \n2) Luxrender tasks are still called Blender_date\n3) Cloning the task doesn't change the name\n4) I think maybe the right column order should be: name, state, progress bar, value, time, id (but it's up for discussion). \n. We use simple incomes version from  payment monitor without linking payment to task for Brass 0.3. We'll improve it later.\n. Nice. Can you add a simple test? \n. It have to wait with being merge - there's not time to add it to relase 0.3 version (because there is no time to test it and still a lot of debugging with other problems. \nOne new PR is ok imho. Can you add some tests to pass codecdov patch? \nAnd one small issue: default lux render task is loaded properly after clicking \"reset to defaults\", but not after changing task type combo box.\n. Great! Work very well. \nBut can you make the subtaks frame thinner? It's very thick in that version.  That thinckness makes problem from #541 very visible (and possibly, however I'm not 100% sure make it even worse). \n. Still problems with 1920x1080, 30 subtasks. Preview strips are connected in the wrong order and I'm not able to mark the last subtask (number 30).\n. -  Possible technologies: cmd? click?\n- Interactive or deamon + stat commands? \n- We may want to change interface logic to general interface logic and use implemented rpc services for communication. \n- gt format for saving task should be changed into something that can be edited by user, eg. yaml.\n. I've moved it to monitor repo: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem-monitor/issues/1\n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem-docs/issues/5\n. It's nice that default directory is user directory. But that's the only one improvement I'm afraid. If you reload the task or change task type, custmizer is generated from the beginning and saved paths are reset. \n. Yeah, reload = load again from .gt file\nHm. I've checked QFileDialog docs and theres saveState function.\n\nSaves the state of the dialog's layout, history and current directory.\nTypically this is used in conjunction with QSettings to remember the size for a future session. A version number is stored as part of the data.\n\nMaybe it can be easily used to save those directiores and then to be restored not only between tasks but also sessions. Just an idea, not sure if it's really going to work. \n. Right now it always open the home directory, now matter what you set or opened. \n. Windows.  Always open home directory, doesn't matter if I set scene in different directory by hand or load from the .gt. \n. I think I find the reason - settings weren't saved on my computer because there was a problem with access right to the default file. I've changed the settings file, please check that it's working properly on Linux. \n. The most irritating and misleading progress bar ever, but probably better then previous empty test  window :) \nMaybe we'll add some serious estimation later, right now it should be sufficient. \n. Are you going to change something more here?\n. We may show proper progress when we find out how to measure subtasks progress.\n. Works great! Let's resolve the conflicts and merge it as soon as possible.\n. I get on windows:\n\nno such file or directory\nError response from daemon: Container command not found or does not exist. \n\nIt may be a problem with working directory: https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/2950 \nDo you have some ideas or should I investigate further on my machine? \n. There is no point in fixing this issue, because we're migrating to new GUI. . Moved to R+D repo. We may solve it by additing config update monitor method.\n. I got several errors on Windows in test_peersession test_react_to_hello.\nLine 80-81 key_id is removed from peers.\nLine 88 Actual call is 'Too many peers' not 'Duplicate peers'. \n. Works great!\n. It will save our testers (and us - answering the questions about magenta) a lot of time :+1: \n. That shouldn't be the final solution of the problem, we will need updateConfig monitor model and method in the future.\nBut it's good enough for now and works, so let's merge it.\n. Preferably both. \n. One small potential problem: if user resize one column manually, than those changes are lost aftert window is resized. Anyway, it's probably not very important and this is much better than current \"solution\" . \n. I've added some locks so test passes on my machine, but feel free to revert and do something else.\n. ```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Sources\\golem\\golem\\rpc\\websockets.py\", line 231, in perform_requests\n    message.kwargs)\n  File \"C:\\Sources\\golem\\golem\\rpc\\websockets.py\", line 316, in perform_request\n    result = server.call(method, *args, kwargs)\n  File \"C:\\Sources\\golem\\golem\\rpc\\service.py\", line 92, in call\n    return method(*args, kwargs)\n  File \"C:\\Sources\\golem\\golem\\client.py\", line 728, in get_status\n    progress = self.task_server.task_computer.get_progresses()\nAttributeError: 'TaskComputer' object has no attribute 'get_progresses'\nUnhandled error in Deferred:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\twisted-15.4.0-py2.7-win32.egg\\twisted\\internet\\defer.py\", line 393, in callback\n    self._startRunCallbacks(result)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\twisted-15.4.0-py2.7-win32.egg\\twisted\\internet\\defer.py\", line 501, in _startRunCallbacks\n    self._runCallbacks()\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\twisted-15.4.0-py2.7-win32.egg\\twisted\\internet\\defer.py\", line 588, in _runCallbacks\n    current.result = callback(current.result, args, kw)\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\twisted-15.4.0-py2.7-win32.egg\\twisted\\internet\\defer.py\", line 1184, in gotResult\n    _inlineCallbacks(r, g, deferred)\n---  ---\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\twisted-15.4.0-py2.7-win32.egg\\twisted\\internet\\defer.py\", line 1128, in _inlineCallbacks\n    result = g.send(result)\n  File \"C:\\Sources\\golem\\gnr\\gnrapplicationlogic.py\", line 179, in get_status\n    self.customizer.gui.ui.statusTextBrowser.setText(client_status)\nexceptions.TypeError: QTextEdit.setText(QString): argument 1 has unexpected type 'NoneType'\n``\n. We're going to do this differently. . Moved to R+D\n. If you change the output format then new output format is added to the task name instead of being changed. For example you define output file as:/home/user/outputfile.PNG. Then you change 'output format' to 'JPEG'. Output file is not changed at the beginning, but if you click \"test task\" or clickoutput fileline edit it is changed to/home/user/outputfile.PNG.JPEG`.. I vote for removing the newest. Maybe @paulperegud has different idea, but this one should work well. If there are no more subtasks in some old tasks it's going to be removed from the list anyway, so there's a place for the new task to be added. . This was partially solved, but there still may be some problems. We don't want to verify subtasks using samples that are smaller than 8x8 pixels. In fact, we don't want to allow users to define subtasks that may have height smaller than 8 pixels.\nWe want to define:\n minimum acceptable resolution (it should probably be bigger than 8 pixels - 64? 128? @Elfoniok please decide what is the resonable value)\n* maximum number of subtasks that can be defined for given resolution. For example for task with resolution 800xX maximum number of subtasks should be 100, but for task with resolution 600xX maximum number of subtasks should be 75. \nThis checks should be implemented for both GUI (@mdtanrikulu) and core (@Elfoniok).\n. Related issue: #682 \nShould also resolve: #2002. We can assume that high quality production frames can take ~ 40 hours of rendering. \nFrom PBRT book: \n\nFinal rendering of the cover image at 1496 by 2235 resolution using pbrt took over 40 hours of computation on an eight-core Mac Pro computer.\n\nThis gives around ~1 h 15 minutes for single subtask which is very reasonable. So setting maximum 33 subtasks per frame seems to be a good choice!. ERROR - golem.task.taskserver - Wrong task header received Invalid signature. This path was not invalid because it contains strange symbols, but because join changed it to a proper (but strange) path inside root directory. Therefore, this test passes for normal users, but failed for root. \nWe can assume that our tests should be run only for non-root users, but then modify this test to try to create a normal log files inside root directory or accept and remove this part of the test. \nI vote for accepting this PR. .

New changes that are being implemented in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1412 will make this PR useless. To be able to solve this issue we will need additional changes in both Golem core & GUI / CLI. @chfast Please define the changes that should be done to make this possible here or in separate issues. . 1. First and minial requirement is to be able to make Ethereum account backup\nAdditional requirement is to prepare backup of Golem state, settings and history. \nPoints 3 and 4 about restoring /changing account in UI should be ignored for now. . Resolved by: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/755. Too many brackets (see preview). Also we can appveyor flag: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/40ffpq86bl00um02?svg=true. This should be addressed in GUI (https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-electron/issues/206) . It looks like it is related to https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/240. \nPIL cannot open file as PNG, so it tries to open it with all the other format plugins. TGA plugin doesn't check for the length of the data and return IndexError insted of SyntaxError that is expected. Therefore PIL is not able to close the image the properly. \nStupid but working workaround: write more data to the \"broken.png\"... . Can you upgrade protocol versions for p2p network and task network? . Discussion should be moved to golem-design. There are two problems here. \n1) Your Docker isn't working. Have you installed it? \n2) There is a problem if Golem is installed on other disk than the data - I'll create an issue with better description. . This issue was about old interface.. Please ask to reopen this issue, if the error still occurs. . Can you chceck if there is a running instance of \"default\" Virtual Machine using VirtualBox? If there is power it off and try again. . Good fix. We should also think how to add a mechanism that stops nodes from trying to connect again for certain time if connection was dropped.. There's still a problem with packing and unpacking max_price value. Ints are unpacked to longs on windows, longs are unpacked to ints on Linux. . Those files can be attached as additional resources. . ~[Assigned to Creed]~. Resolved by #1176. In all installation from source instructions is specified to run pip install -r requirements.txt before running setup.py. \nIssues with pathlib can be relatively easily solved, eg. by moving get_golem_path function to external file that imports only os. \nBut we're still going to need PyGit version installed before. Also PyQt installed and some additionall packages. Maybe we can create better developer instalator later, but for now I'm closing this issue. . It was resolved some time ago. . When subtask is restarted, then the part of image that it produces should be removed from preview. \nFor single frame task in Blender it is done by just painting the right part of the preview with black color. This procedure is not done however when there are many frames - and that's something that should be implemented. \nAs you noticed properly this part  of the code should be removed, but only after a proper method in framerenderingtask is implemented. We need _remove_from_preview function implemented in framerenderingtask that runs parent method if task is not using multiple frames and it\u2019s own removal method in other case. . Thank you for your suggestions @cookiengineer \nSupport for developers, ie. possibility to add your own tasks with proper set of tools and documentation are planned for next milestones, ie. Clay, Stone and Iron. You can check the roadmap here: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/wiki/Roadmap\nNew installators should be more useful, however we definietely need easier instalation for developers. \n\nI'm closing this issue, because there are too many different topics here. . These error messages aren't connect with test error. They just indicates that the version that you've installed is newer than the most of the test network from package. \nCan you describe this test fail with more detail? Are you using GUI or CLI? If GUI what is displayed in popup window and what in logs? Do you have Docker installed and working properly? . Wow, great description!\nTest phase shouldn't generate final image. It locally renders a small part of the image somewhere in your temp directory. To generate the final output you have to click \"create task\" and then \"start task\". Then it will be sent to Golem network and rendered on providers machines (and not your own). \nThe test result should be saved in ~/.local/share/golem/default/task_tmp/output. You can specify different directory with --datadir description. . Anything that references to it. Task manager, tasks implementatino in apps (if there are left any), interface part, task states, etc. \n. Was done by @matthewsedam Thanks again for contributing!. Wow, that's pretty strange. Would it be possible to share with  us the scene that you have used? Are there any special plugins / renderes that are needed to render properly this scene? . Seems that it's the bug in old package version that is already fixed in 0.4.\nClosing for now, we may reopen it if it's going to be observed again after official 0.4 for Linux is released. . This is back on Mac 0.5. Resolved by #981. Bug connecte with geth synchronization.. Resolved by #1071 . Do you have your system clock properly synchronized? . It's generally caused by other nodes with desynchronized clocks sending messages to the system. This log information however shouldn't have \"error\" level, just warning. \nI'm going to prepare PR that changes this. . Resolved by #993 . Solution proposed by jesephxsxn won't help because that is the problem with ethereum nodes seeds, not Golem newtork seeds. \nWe may want to catch this type of errors and show user a proper warning / information about problem. Apart from need for better error handling, this should be a temporary issue caused by problem with ethereum testnet. \n@slowkow Can you confirm that you don't have this problem any more? . - We moved to rinkeby, so geth testnet issues should be solved.\n- Non-critical geth errors are caught. \n- Benchmark bug mentioned by aesopwonder was  resolved by #1171. . This error message should not cause task failure. It's not important for task that can be rendered in Golem. \n\nAre there any additional error messages in logs? \nDid you use advance verification options? If yes what was the parameters? \nDid this error happen once or is it reoccuring? For one specific scene or for all scenes? . @slowkow This error message means that your docker run out of memory. How much memory do you have available on your system and how much have you set for Golem? . @apolikamixitos Golem Ids and not names are used here, so I don't think that wild card mechanism will be useful. \nWhitelist mechanism is a good idea. \nRemember, however, that this is temporary alpha/beta Brass solution. It's not a final mechanism that will allow user to certify apps / developers in Clay\n. This was fixed by switching to Python3 . Thank you for all the feedback! \nWe tried to address most of the issues that were described here and we'll still continue the work on making UX better. . That issue can be treated as a duplicate of #1001 . Resolved by #1121 . @chfast Are you going to continue to work on this PR further? . This are not errors, just infos and warnings. Your node may not be able to connect to some nodes if they are behind NAT (without forwarded ports) and your node is behind NAT (without forwarded ports) or if a node went offline. \nHowever, we should decrease severity of those logs, to make it less confusing. . The logs should be saved in C:\\Users\\.local\\golem if your run golem in non-administrative mode (which is recommended). . Golem tries to install geth, but geth Windows installer used restrictive limits on PATH length. It should be fixed now, so we're hoping that new realses will be free from this issue (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3419). \nRight now, you can check if there's no geth install in C:\\Program Files\\Geth and if not dowload id and add to PATH manually. Sorry for inconvenience. . It doesn't work for .exr output files. Reference image is always generated with png extension, but final_image_ready checks for default output format. . Can  you bring back protocol versions? Also please, don't touch reputation in this branch. \n. When you connect to our test network the first time you receive tGNT from our faucet. Keep in mind that they are not \u201creal\u201d GNT from main chain and can be only used in test-network.\n\nYou can\u2019t earn any additional tGNT because you are not connected to Golem network. There most probably l reasons for that:You don\u2019t have public IP and you didn\u2019t forwarded proper ports on your router. Check this instruction if that\u2019s the issue: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/wiki/Testing#how-to-start-testing\nAlso, the option is called --nogui that's why --no-gui was not found. \n. Resolved by #1151. Are  you sure it's only TCP? There is only this one option in default geth command line settings + I've always have geth listening on specified port both on TCP and UDP. . @Radagast-red Are you going to work on this?. I'm closing it for now. Feel free to reopen it when youl continue to work on it. .

I've moved this issue to frontend.. There are some problems with computing properly estimated reputation value. However the fact that your node has low reputation, you are constantly disconnected and can't compute task, implicates that your node is not working properly. Probably you don't have public ip or forwarded ports: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/wiki/Testing#how-to-start-testing\nMaybe there is also some problems with geth no your machine, that pushes your reputation further down. Can you please check if there are some ERRORS when you start golem node? \n. @paulperegud or @jiivan merge / rebase, please. . @mfranciszkiewicz Can we close this issue?. @dixon-hill Would it be possible to add minimal requirements to some FAQ & wiki pages? . @jiivan Please check if doesn't need any changes on monitor side. We can merge it after you give your accept. . @matthewsedam Can you please do merge / rebase one last time? This one is ready to be merged after that. . Not important anymore, because old GUI was removed. . @chfast Can you check that you have signed CLA? \n@jiivan Can you accept?. Merge together with: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-electron/tree/trust_range. Hi! \nCan you check that you don't have restrictive firewall active? If it doesn't help, then please send us logs to tech@golem.network. Hi! \nYou are not able to log into golem, it just should generate you a new id and use it to connect with the network. This message means that your Golem app does not start properly. Firstly, check if there is no geth process active before you start Golem - it may cause problems. If that doesn't help check this webpage: \nhttps://docs.golem.network/10-troubleshooting.html\nIf you still cannot find a solution, then please send us email to tech@golem.network with more details, ie. your OS, and golem log files. . No, it's not possible yet. Golem is still on testnet and it uses automatically generated Ethereum addresses. . Can you make sure that this issue is still relevant? First error was probably caused by indeterminism in dummy_task test. . Moved to https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1316. It is a good first step. However as you see from test suite, without adding proper implementation of this method in framerenderingtask it's just going to break the code. . Probably it's a duplicate of #1230. Check also PR #1323 . We're merging, @inexxt please fix the failing tests with separate PR. . Issue was solved with newer geth version. And we're not install geth client anymore. . Also if we're not able to listen on any port we should grafefully terminate golem with displaying proper error message. . Should be fixed by https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1296.

It will be inconvenient to use github API for that (limits!). We should check this somewhere else where it's not causing this problems. Monitor might not be the best idea, so let's add this check in seed nodes, ie. Golem node should compare it's version with seeds version.. @jivan Can you make a PR to develop & close this one? . Golem is still in starting phase. As you can see at the bottom, the dot is still red and some configuration is going on. This can take quite a long time. When everything is finished the button should become enabled. \n@Slavenin Can you affirm that after a couple of minutes message in the right corner is different? \n@ederenn This is a big UX problem and this behaviour app behaviour may not be clear to many users. Can you create an issue about this in golem-electron github?. How many times did it happen? Can you add screenshots? Did you agree to make changes?. @ederenn Can you confirm that this problem doesn't occur again on clean OS with new installer? . What exactly is the problem here? . I go this error when I try to add app with some previously finished tasks\nFile \"C:\\Users\\badb\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36\\lib\\site-packages\\twisted\\internet\\defer.py\", line 746, in send\n    raise result.value\nTypeError: add_task() got an unexpected keyword argument 'async'\nSubprocess 7184 terminated. @ederenn Is this issue still valid? Can you close it if it's not or move to golem-electron if it is?. @. @ederenn Can you move this issue to golem-electron?. @maaktweluit Yes, please, can you close #1301?. @mdtanrikulu Can you please tell me exactly with which API call do you have this problem? comp.environment.performance returns four benchamark results with DEFAULT included. . Resolves: \nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/1502. The second one looks correct (old faucet on Pebble).. @ederenn @mdtanrikulu Is it still valid or can we close this one? . @chfast Can you sign the CLA please? . This issue should no longer be valid (we use external geth by default). . More precisely it would be nice to have option that allows user to set Cycle sampling rate. . This issue was observed after Golem was stopped, configuration was changed, and then it was restarted. On Mac and Windows, Docker machine was not restarted correctly and throws some regenrate-certs error.  Maybe certs must be regenerated with every config change? Maybe there's a better way? Solve this issue, so that Docker Machine is restarted correctly every time.. @tapuat Please let us know if you have similiar problems with 0.11.0 version, feel free to reopen issue or create another one. . Will be merged from b0.9. We can assume that X is big enough that it's not needed. . @etam Do you still have this problem with 0.11.0?. This task can be done in parts. \n1. apps\n [ ] Check that all log messages in apps part show meaningful information\n [ ] Check that all log messages in apps part have apropriate severity. @RDProjekt We were not able to reproduce this, are you still able to observe this issue?. @Krigpl Can you take a quick look at this one, if this one can still be valid. Please close the issue if it's not. . @spoonbear Have you tried using version 0.11.0? If you observe similiar error there, please let us know. . @Weldopedia Have you tried running 0.11.0 version of Golem app? If you observe similiar problems with the new version, please let us know. . Related to https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/225. Right now we have this description of behaviour reported by one of our users: \n\nWhile waiting for a renderjob Windows went to sleep and after it woke up: Golem was still running and stated \"Job processing\". Even the nodes were reconnected. But the renderjob seemed not to work anymore. No more frames were rendered. I let the machine do whatever it did for some hours, but nothing changed. I received no more frames from the network.\nThen I shut down golem and wanted to turn my PC off when the system told me that the virtual box manager is still accessing some resource and thus Windows cannot shut down without aborting that.\n\nWe should try to reproduce this behaviour. . @ederenn Please reopen, if this error occur again in 0.11.0 or later. . @ederenn Can you confirm that those behaviours with sleep mode for preparing and waiting state don't repeat themselves with current code version?. @ederenn Please close this issue if you don't observe this behaviour anymore or comment if you do. . Duplicate of: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/1640. This was typical out of memory error. \nDocker recovery options should work much better now. @ederenn Feel free to reopen if you observe similiar problem in the future. . Hi @lagorsse!\nYour golem instance is not started properly, because it cannot run docker. \nDid you have previous version of golem installed? \n. @tomasz-l  Can you sign the CLA?. Hi @TheRoboKitten!\nRight now we are developing Brass - MVP concentrated on rendering with Blender and Luxrender. Further use cases will be supported in next release. We are however collecting requirements for additional use cases. Can you please write to contact@golem.network? I'll contact you with the right person to talk to about your nodejs projects. . Resolves #856 . Hi, @capitalknew!\nPlease send us email to contact@golem.network if you are still interested. It's not possible to add your own tasks now. . We can:\n1) Use only x64 location from @mfranciszkiewicz version\n2) Use x64 and remove VM installer (mixed version)\n3) Use this version with additional script with killing vm and installing driver script. \nI think that version 2 seems to be the safest and less problematic. @mfranciszkiewicz @maaktweluit what do you think? . Version 2 will be implemented in #1683. It's not a bug, it's a feature. We can consider changing state of \"waiting\" and \"computing\" behaviour, but that's a topic for the future. . Duplicate of: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/1594. Hi @jochen1727 \nPlease try to use the newest release of Golem and checking if this issue is valid. If you observe similar problems again, feel free to contact us or reopen the issue. . Fixed in GUI, still requires changes in CLI. . Hi @slonus!\n1) Not getting tasks\nDid you change any default options, eg. min. price, reputation?\n2) What timeout are you setting with your default task? What kind of scene are using? . It's not a problem related to  Golem itself. \n@maaktweluit Can you please add this solution to Common problems wiki section and close this issue? Or is it still blocking mulit-os tests? . Duplicate of: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/1775 . @maaktweluit Do you know if this error is fixed? . Hi @AniimaL @slonus @lonelymyp @golemUser1!\nThere were many changes in Golem app since you tried to use it, please try the newest version and if you still have problems with receiving job from the network please contact our user support on Rocket!. 1. Nodes are blocked when they are not able to exchange resources between each other. \n2. You cannot, because it doesn't make sense - if nodes are not able to exchange simple resouce between themselves, they won't be able to exchange resources and results. \n3. Nope. \n4. 20 seconds \n5. Older HyperG version were not working with each other in internal network. This should be fixed now. Feel free to reopen this issue if you observe this again in 0.11.0.. @maaktweluit Do you still have this problems or is it solved? . Is probably related to: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/1786. Hi @sakhawat18!\nNot yet, it will be possible after more generalise task API is created. Are you able to describe us your use case with more details, so we can figure out how quickly it can be integrated with Golem? If yes, then please send us email to tech@golem.network and refer this issue. . @Elfoniok Fixed.. @maaktweluit Can you make some tests with different version of VMs and try to figure out when does the problem occur exactly so we can understand it better? . May be related to https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/1824. Hi @mackode \nThank you for contributing, this implementation however is not really integrated in Golem. Keep in mind that even if this implementation was using ports from the config and not hardcoded ones than they may not be ports that Golem is really using. Golem is trying to find first free ports that are bigger than the defined one. \nYou can also check this branch that @mfranciszkiewicz has started working on: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/compare/upnp\n. I believe this should be solved with new golem-messages updates. @jiivan Can you confirm?. Hi @Date1! \nCan you give us more detail? What OS are you using? What is exactly the problem? Have you checked this website https://docs.golem.network/10-troubleshooting.html? Can you share your logs with us?. @Date1 What OS are you using? . @Date1 Windows 7 is not officially supported, Golem only supports Windows 10. \nAnyway, please send us your logs to tech@golem.network. They should be located in C:\\Users\\.golem\\logs. Please refer to issue 1805 in your email. . Hi @Slavenin \nHave you uninstall 0.9.0 version before installing 0.10.0? This log looks like it comes from the old Golem version - there are references to x86 paths and old minilight checks.\nCan you please try to unistall all golem version that you may have installed on your machine and then try to install 0.10.0 again?. @apolikamixitos Please try out version 0.11.0. If the problem occurs again, feel free to comment and reopen the issue!. @chfast You started computing tasks when you were able to pay for it. But in the meantime you have lost you tokens because they can be used also outside of Golem. Payment that should be done is already noted in database, but you cannot settle it until you restart Golem node. This issue allows you to settle it just by adding additional funds. @Krigpl correct me if I'm wrong here.. @Technoprenerd Are you able to run docker run hello-world or generally download any official docker images? \nCan you check if this topic can be related in any way? \nhttps://stackoverflow.com//questions/23111631/cannot-download-docker-images-behind-a-proxy . @Technoprenerd \nThis first pull that you have tried does not work because you have called docker pull golemfactory instead of specifing exact name and tag, ie docker pull golemfactory/base:1.2. \nThe second pull seems to work properly! Can you try to run docker run golemfactory/base:1.2?\nHave you tried to install 0.11.0 version of Golem? . @ChrisHelmsC Can you check what is the exact error that command docker pull golemfactory/base:1.2 returns on your machine? . @Technoprenerd  Did Golem starts correctly with newer veresion? . @ederenn Are you sure that that's a proper issue number that it's related to? Also how is the error in issue title related to the message in logs? . Both issues you mentioned still seems to be unrelated. However, this error should be investigated further, there's a risk that it may have cause problems with payment matching. This issue #1832 may be related. . @kascheri12 It seems that it's your node that was not able to pay for comptuations here. Can you please check your logs and figure out if there were additional problems with geth during this time? . GNT is not an ERC20 coin and remember that we're still on testnet! It means that we're using test GNT and test ether from rinkeby chain. You get them from our faucets, please don't buy anything yet to test golem!\nThanks for the @alptiginsaki, there's one error in your log that show some unstable work of Geth service which might cause this issue back then. Are you still have only \"awaiting\" transaction or were you able to observe some completed ones? . Hi @chriscrutt!\nThanks for reporting, we'll check and fix it! \n@ederenn Can you confirm? . It's not really possible in the nearest future, because it will overcomplicate protocol, but it's a good suggestion for the future and potentially change the protocol in the next releases. . 1. To how many nodes were you connected? Did you have warning about closed ports?\n2. Did you change the default reputation option? \n3. What price did you set? \nThis three are usually the main blockers that make other people not compute your tasks. \nYou can also check in your logs if there are any nodes getting \"banned\" from tasks, ie. they tried to compute it but failed. . Hi @wp31 & @chriscrutt \nThere is a new version of Golem available. Can you try it out and see if it's working properly? If the problem still occurs, then please send us the logs to contact@golem.network or via https://chat.golem.network and reference the number of the issue!. @ederenn Can you try to reproduce this behaviour? . @ederenn Can you confirm that this is issue is not valid anymore in 0.11.0? . @golemUser1 advice should solve the issue!\n@ceto14 Please feel free to reopen if it doesn't help you. . Golem is currently only supporting DockerToolbox with VirtualBox and disabling Hyper-V is necessary. It may be changed in the future, but right now I'm afraid there's no other way than the workaround you have described. . https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-electron/pull/192 should be merged as well. Related to #1862. Hi @Slavenin!\nIt means that there are some problems with crossbar router which connects golem core with user interface. Do you know when do these errors occur? Were you able to start application normally? Do they start to appear at the beginning or after some time or just after closing golem app? . This seems to be dying RPC issue that should be solved in 0.11.0. Feel free to comment if you observe this behaviour in current releases!. Hi @josephyoungh!\nCan  you please send us full log to contact@golem.network and reference this issue number in your mail?\nDid this error occur while you were trying to add a task? What scene did you use? . With updated Golem network better information about failed tasks should be available in logs also potential problems with sending resources should be fixed, so I'm closing this issue. \n@josephyoungh Feel free to comment and reopen if you observe similiar behaviour in 0.11.0!. @jiivan Can you please take a look and check which of this errors are already known and solved and which may be the new ones? . @golemUser1 Feel free to reopen if you observe similiar error again!. The crashed default virtual machine should not be an issue - Golem doesn't use default virtual machine. \n@golemUser1 Can you please write us how much RAM have you assign to golem node and how many cpu cores? \n. @golemUser1 Feel free to reopen if you observe this error again.\n@ederenn Please also keep an eye on application behaviour during local tests. . Was resolved in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1928. @ktomala Did application continue to run? This exception should stop the application, it should not be started properly with this error. Do you have rest of this log? . It should be and it is, however we should add something to make sure that subtask_ids are unique between different requestors. Ie. subtask_id should be hash of requestor id and task definion (with timestamp included). . Resolved by #1941. Nodes that don't have forwarded ports may still be useful for the network in the way that they can route information about peers and tasks for other nodes. They may, however, not be able to compute anything that comes from outside their local network. You are right that this should be more visible. . @mdtanrikulu Is this issue fixed?. This was caused by a specific situation with updating certificates for golem monitor service. Taking into account that this error was only printed once we can assume that this full traceback is not a problem and a warning level is apropriate. . @maaktweluit Can you get full logs of this issue in 0.11.0 version? . @golemUser1 Thanks! That's really helpful. Did you golem app was able to work again after the crash visible in logs at 22:15 or was it totaly unresponsive? . Hi @asato-ma!\nYou must stop golem to be able to change the resources. \nThis behaviour may not be very intuitive, so @jamuszyn here's another UX problem for you. . We should display more information about Errors. Issue for that is here: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-electron/issues/217. @shadeofblue @jiivan Is this one fixed?. This should be fixed in 0.13.0. @maaktweluit Do you have any suggestions how can we improve the logs to be more readible? . Ok. So we may assume that it's part of this issu: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/1598. That can happen when the traceback is empty. It's not a bug, but some additional information should be added to the log message. . It's not a bug, it's a feature...\nHowever, this button should not be visible or should be disabled if task has hit the timeout. \nFor subtasks that were positiviely finished there should be an option to restart them (if the whole task was not finished yet), but it shouldn't be visible / active for failed subtask and there should be a warning that restarting subtask that was already computed will result with higher price of whole task. \nThis is however GUI issue. \n@ederenn Can you move this issue to golem-electron (and close this one here)? . @mdtanrikulu Did you try to run two instances of Golem on the same machine? . Any configuration changes? . Environment must be kept in TaskHeader. Basic information about task owner, ie. key_id, address and port as well. There's additional problem that those information are duplicated in TaskHeader itself, ie. for example key_id is both in task_owner data structure and in task_owner_key_id field. \nThe tricky part is to check which one of them is really used. . Can you plase specify what do you mean by progressive rendering for Cycle? . Alternative implementation is here: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2207 @jiivan @etam. It was already fixed in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/commit/c9d45d47312ca8eda6ed3ee597ac46daba238ea5. @gokulsan Please write to use to contact@golem.network and describe with more details what would you like to do with Golem. We'll see what can be done in short term. . @maaktweluit @dixon-hill It's probably a good idea to put this in Common Problem wiki section! . Blocked by: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2291. @dixon-hill Do you have logs? It's probably caused by RPC router crashing and loosing connection between GUI and Golem (but that's just a guess). . We should generate a similiar log for Blender 2.79 to make sure that log format is not change. . Multi-OS test scenarios on this branch should be done by @ederenn before we can merge it. . Hi, @kascheri12, that's the new feature anti-sybil feature. Can you please try to remove your old golem keys? They should be located in datadir directory in keys directory. . I agree, that it would be quite useful, but it should be used with extereme caution after we're on mainnet. . Part2: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2337/. Hi!\nCan you please make sure that you have run python setup.py develop and you are using the proper version of golem-messages? . https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-rd/wiki/Testing-with-IMUNES. We already tried to done this during LocalRenderTest. We try to measure there RAM usage and than it's set as required RAM for providers. There are still some problems with it however:\n memory measurement is not done very precise and can be improved\n verification should not be run in parallel\n user should be warned that with lowering golem caps he's risking verification failures\n user should get more information about out-of-ram LockalRenderTests problems (ie. error 247). This information is showed in logs but not in GUI. . Let's have a class method get_param_limits that return dictionary with param name and a pair of (min, max). It should be universal enough and later used by GUI. . This may be caused by https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/2472, but its just a theory. If you observe Dockers trying to restart when golem service stopped again, let me mnie.. Hi! Your funds should be unlock after 24 hours. Function that unlock resources after deleting tasks or getting timeout was merged today. . 2. When you add a new task to the network some funds need to pay for computation, ie. GNT and ETH are locked by Golem. ETH lockup is quite strict, it's locked enough ETH to pay for gas in the worst possible scenario, ie. highest possible gas price and every subtask being computed by different providers. Locks are removed after real payments are scheduled (with better price estimation), after task is deleted or 24 hours after task got timeout. Therefore your available balance increase with time. Wallet (account info) doesn't display locked funds. \n1. Is it possible that the first task was partially finished in 2 minutes? . @mdtanrikulu Do you receive more detailed error messages with this RPC call? Is it possible to display it? . Can you remove dummy task from mainnet as well? . @fbsanches Hi, thank you for suggestions!\n\nWon't be possible because we're decentralized application and we don't want to include centralized double authentication methods. \nWe've already added some tips, but if you find some settings where they are still missing let us know. Also if you suggest adding something more fields to onboarding, please specify which one. \nWe're adding auto-start on variou OSs to the backlog!\n. 1. Remember that you have to scroll down to be able to accept the terms. \nIt seems that it's sometimes hang on this step if there's a problem with docker. \nCan you please check docker related steps from here: https://golem.network/documentation/09-common-issues-troubleshooting/\nIt it won't help please join https//chat.golem.network to get some help in real time. \n. @miloshev Hi, thanks for reporting! \n\nCan you please send full logs to contact@golem.network with reference to this issue? \nIs the problem reproducible after app restart? . Hi @cyberminotaure!\nCan you please send us logs to contact@golem.network and refernce this issue in the email?. Not permantently but for 24hours.\nAnyway they should be released after timeout but with taking into account all the subtasks that are still waiting for verification.. Hi @taiwil!\nFirstly, please try to follow steps from this page: https://golem.network/documentation/09-common-issues-troubleshooting/\nIf this doesn't help, then please join https://chat.golem.network? You can get there some user support in real time. Alternatively, you can describe your problem and send email to contact@golem.network. Please attach your logs (https://golem.network/documentation/15-understanding-logs/) if you choose this form of communication.. It's probably not a bug but misleading log message (or not very optimal part of p2p protocol). We should check it and make this message more meaningful, but there's nothing to worry about from user perspective. . It's not a bug per se, rather not very fortunate design decision. We should however consider improving protocol to support address changes. . Hi @maflores16 \nThere is a bug in GUI that doesn't display properly allocated resources after Golem is started, but in fact those resources are allocated.\nThere can be another reason why your computer was not able to compute task, having too low allocated reasource is just one option. Is everything working correctly now? . Hi @Slavenin \nThere are docker errors in your log, so that's probably a source of problem and not necessarily ip addresses blocking. Take a look at this line in your log:\nb'It seems there is a  problem with your Docker installation.\\nEnsure that you try the following before reporting an issue:\\n\\n 1. The virtualization of Intel VT-x/EPT or AMD-V/RVI is enabled in BIOS\\n    or virtual machine settings.\\n 2. The proper environment is set. On windows powershell please run:\\n    & \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Docker Toolbox\\\\docker-machine.exe\" env golem | Invoke-Expression\\n 3. virtualbox driver is available:\\n    docker-machine.exe create --driver virtualbox golem\\n 4. Restart Windows machine'\nIf it doesn't help, than please contact us on https://chat.golem.network or send us email to contact@golem.network. \n. Docker machine may die during heavy computation and however it should recover itself most of the time, sometimes it may require additional activities. . Can you please try out docker-related commands describe here: https://golem.network/documentation/09-common-issues-troubleshooting/ and check if you get any errors?. What we would need is exact information about those tasks, what were the exact parameters and what were the timeouts / subtask timeouts. It would be also helpful to observe how many tasks are in the network when something like that takes place. @ederenn Can you try to get this information?. Quick guess is that 899.5 MiB may not be enough. We will investigate further. . @tworec Can you make PR to develop with this change? . Do not merge before @mdtanrikulu accepts!. @mdtanrikulu Call result changed to dict, check if you are ok with this change. . VPN will allow you to make outgoing connections but will block you incoming traffic and golem will still use your normal ip address ports to describe task requestor location. So right now it's not possible.\nIf we add some relaying services or data routing through other nodes, it may help (as for other network scenarios when ports are not forwarded). . Hi @heiko1234!\nRaspberry Pi3B+ is still below minimal requirements for golemapp so there are many things that can go bad. \nDebugging binary vesion can be difficult, so if you are able to spend more time on this, I would strongly suggest you to try to install the source code version so you can get much better error messages. . Hi @Lehmax \nAre you using version 0.15.1 or 0.15.0?. Stopping VirtualBox after all tasks & verification is finished may be added to the todo list for this task: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/2606. Hi @k-syusteem, \nThank you for your proposal! Can you send it to contact@golem.network so people responsible for branding can take a look? . Hi @Petelin \nPublic ip address is not required if you are able to forward ports / have upnp enabled in their router. \nThis error means that there is no communication between golem core and GUI which may be caused by too heavy computation or some problems with Golem core. \nPlease check this site: https://golem.network/documentation/09-common-issues-troubleshooting/ and if you can't find solution there ask for help on Rocket chat (https://http://chat.golem.network).. Was the new task created? Are pictures and description about finished tasks that was restarted? Do you have logs? . It seems that two tasks were created, but the second one has some problems with properly defined number of total tasks. This should be investigated further. Do you remember exact parameters of your scene, ie. number of frames & total tasks? . Hi @jish \nDoes restarting the app help? If not, try steps described here: https://golem.network/documentation/09-common-issues-troubleshooting/docker-errors-on-windows-10/\nIf you have further problems please contact us on rocket: https://chat.golem.network. Give up on it. Blender Render is going to be removed in next Blender version anyway. And this issue can be fixed by properly preparing scene, ie. prebaking textures. \nWe are going to add proper info to docs / tutorials, though. . Let's not change b0.15.1 at this point. Why do you need this update here? . Hi @Warolf! It usually means that there are other problems with your golem instance usually caused by Docker problems. Please check the steps described here: https://golem.network/documentation/09-common-issues-troubleshooting/ \nIf nothing helps, then please send us logs https://golem.network/documentation/15-understanding-logs/  to contact@golem.network or join Rocket Chat to get some help in real time (https://chat.golem.network). . There are no reasons that we are aware of recently that will make usage of Intel Optane with Golem not possible, but it hasn't been tested yet. . Updated version: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2804. Not a bug, it's a feature ;) \nGolem uses default hardcoded list of seeds / bootstrap nodes. All the hardcoded ones right now point to 0.15.1. New one that work with 0.16.0 were not added to hardcoded seed list yet. . Keep in mind that fundrequest bot is not connected with anyway with Golem project so there is not reward funded by golem team for this issue. . @mdtanrikulu Please check this PR, how this changes will affect footer implementation? . @magdasta ^^^. Neither me, nor @maaktweluit are not able to reproduce this error. Were the files added by hand or from some scripts? \n@ederenn Can you try to repeat this on Monday?. @ThomIves Can you please join chat.golem.network and ask user dixon.hill for help with reference to this issue? . @jamuszyn Can you take a look at this? . Hi @tenninebt. \naccept tasks is a boolean option so there's no point in changing it to anything higher than 1. \nCan you please send us screenshots with logs to contact@golem.network with a reference to this issue? \nThe differences may however be a result of slightly different way that successful tasks and payments are defined. The first one means that your machine computed subtask without errors before deadline. It does not implicate however that it manage to send back the results or that results were verified correctly. . @etam What's the connection of accept tasks = 0 and runningo out of disk space? It seems that ResourceCleanerService is not connected in any way to this option. \nYou can however force resources to be removed more often by changing clean resources older than second option. . @tworec After it's merged please send proper links to builds to @ederenn . There is a memory limit included, it was just not set properly from GUI and require specific user interaction from CLI. . @tworec Can you please make this PR to develop?. @etam Why?. It belongs to old ml poc, afaik. . Sorry, it's not ml, it's dummy: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/f82a8bc1275b0eb62cdec3d38c35eb2f05b74203/tests/golem/docker/test_docker_dummy_task.py. Hi @mirzazulfan \nThanks for reaching out. Please contact natalia.mroszczyk@golem.network about this. \n. This issue should be rather solved by Clay team, don't you think @mfranciszkiewicz?. Duplicate of https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/2882?. Duplicate of https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/2883?. Could you also show how DummyTask json would look like after  your changes?\nWe don't want to call it render_type - just task_type. Not only renderer will be supported in the future. \nAlso - frames should be part of script_package\nAnd script_package name is quite misleading, it's just something as job parameters / metapaprameters. \nDo you also need to to put the list of resources / files inside ComputeTaskDef? . This one should wait until taski API is more precisely defined (and we decide if we want to inform about job being finished, child task being finished or other part of computation being finished) . (1) Additional statefulness of Task Session has been removed. \n(2) Resource transport logic for Blender will not be changed (except of the protocol message format). \n(3) In this PR resources are formatted in exactly the same way they were sent before, just in the different message. \n(4) What kind of changes are exactly needed to make this PR acceptable? because I'm lost after reading this comment. . It's truly a scene file, a modified .pbrt scene description. Scene can be treated as resource, but it's a special resource. \n. Maybe we should set root_path as a variable in instance KeysAuth? It won't be static method, but use will be able to set path in config file.\n. node_name should never be None in no-test scenario. But yeah, for unpredicted or test scenarios, we should initialize it with blank string.\n. Because it's very old and ugly way of making messages (each message has its own constants). Maybe we should change someday... (but it's not crucial change). \n. This warning may be misleading. There are problems with too broad exception clause in many places in the code. We should change this to OSError and add some support for ValueError and CalledProcessError (with different warnings). \n. But this function is used mainly to check whether command exists in a system. If it doesn't OSError is thrown. CalledProcessError is called only if this program exists, but return error. \n. What are the pros/cons of making method anonymous?\n. So it's just safer for user who may send empty message with value by mistake? Are there any cost differences? If not, it may be a good idea. \n. Here is a little problem with this test, it duplicates the error from the code. It should be addr = addr[1:], same in the 117 line of tcpnetwork.\nCan we merge it after we fix that line? It will make the code in node.py much nicer. \n. It makes no difference here but it's a \"good practice\" to use is not None instead of I=.\n. You cannot use \"_\" for more than one argument in a function. Using \"_ctx\" and \"_param\" notation makes it less readable for me (it's usually used for protected variables) and it won't help with pycharm warning. \nUsing del won't do any harm and will remove the warning. I don't think it's really necessary, but if you thinks it's a good idea, I may add it. \n. I'm getting different hash here, therefore test result is always -1. I don't now way, but during debug there are two files in lux_task dir: .lxs and lxs~, maybe that is the reason... Artur or Pawe\u0142 can you check if you have the same problem or is it problem with my system? \n. I know that there are too broad exception clause problem in many places in the code, but I'm planning to fix it. \nSo can you please add there IOError and ValueError?\n. Same issue as in a comment above. \n. This except can stay as it is.\n. We change a little bit golem directories in the meantime, to remove GOLEM variable.\n- We access golem directory by calling golem.core.common.get_golem_path() function\n- Old save directory was moved to os.path.join(appdirs.user_data_dir('golem'), 'save')\n  In which directory this file should be saved?\n. Same thing should probably be done for blender?\n. Are ethereum addresses case insensitive?\n. This method need general changes, the whole description should be change and it's not used right now. I'll fix description (and method) when payment and verification protocol will be updated.\n. Done in develop. It's not a final version, only a mockup with less misleading name that previous MessageSubtaskResultAccepted. \n. \"First, cPickle can be up to 1000 times faster than pickle because the former is implemented in C\" - source: https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html#module-cPickle\n. It comes from user input and then it is read from config file right now, but as I understand in the future it will be generated from lightwallet. Maybe we should jest add class EthereumAddress that has some parsing / checking /comparison method?\n. I will leave it commented as it was. It generates a lot of information which is useful for some very specific network debugging scenarios. Putting this in logs just doesn't make sens most of the time. \n. The question was if why is cPickle better, not if it's really necessary ;) It probably doesn't make a huge difference for current small objects. Maybe if there are many resource files. Python3 uses cPickle as default pickle implementation and we're using cPickle in different places in the code... Just guessing, I don't now what was the real reason. \n. Yeah, you're right it should be 51. normalize_address function accepts strings with length 40, 42, 48 and 50. \n. Because only those cases (ok, 51...) arguments are supposed to be hex-encoded strings. Other lengths are accepted when they are 20 or 24-bytes arrays.\n. Oh, come on. Pay for task it's a mockup right now anyway and it's functionality it's commented out. When we add real integration with Ethereum we should think how to solve this situation properly... We will see \"very important\" log and remember about it, but it won't mess up test nodes... \n. See the comment at the bottom. It doesn't make sense to throw back address exception right now. \n. Why should it? \n. I still cannot install it properly on Windows. Can I? \n. It is. All methods in this file are. I know it's terribly ugly, just temporary solution until I find a way to use pyethereum..\n. normalize_address returns binary address format. We need a method that return hexencoded string in some places, so I think it's useful to have this class which gives easy access to both representations. \n. Is this important? I don't see any difference between set and set([]).\n. Hm, right... @magdasta Do we really need this file? Why can't we save the test result directly in the output file? \n. It should be a string. \n. We shouldn't save this file in golem directory (it production version it will be installed as python package), let's change it to \"results\" directory for this task.\n. Is ethereum9 a typo or network number?\n. Yes, good idea.\n. Do not use empty list as default parameter: http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm \n. Is it still true?\n. Yes, but it's a greater issue. We should do proper warnings for other configuration variables. I put it in separated issue: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/issues/213 and i'll try to address it later. \n. Why is it commented out?\n. Please remember about removing this function from gnr.custormizer.configurationdialogcustomize - __check_eth_account method. \n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/issues/231\n. TaskKeeper was previously responsible for two things - keeping information of all tasks (task headers) in the network and keeping information about tasks computed on this machine. I split it into two classes: TaskHeaderKeeper and CompTaskKeeper. The information that TaskHeaderKeeper holds is temporary and may be dropped when Golem is closed. Information that CompTaskKeeper holds is permanent and should be saved in the database. Therefore I thought that CTK better suits TaskManager which holds other permanent information about tasks than TaskServer which probably shouldn't. \n. Why? Simple asserts are considered more pythonic and readlible, but unittest methods produces nicer error message and looks nicer to me.\n. So your suggesting that we should rename methods (supported -> available) and (accept_tasks -> enabled) and then add method \"supported\" which checks both?\n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/issues/235\n. We should change this name if we want to accept other formats. \n. Can you make this function shorter? Maybe we should pack behaviour for exr in one private function and for other formats into another. \n. Lets remove this test at the end of the file, it just makes a mess. \n. Is this on purpose?\n. Unresolved reference 'i'\n. 'print' here and above\n. Yeah. \n. It brokes the GUI, which is expecting \"task\". \n. Shouldn't we change this in \"subtask\" too?\n. Oh, sorry, that was just an experiment and I forgot to change it back!\n. LoopingCall(self.run) is not working? \n. It was nothing wrong in this case, PeerSession was just a complicated issue and I thought that maybe there are some problems with mulitple inheritance somewhere (multiple inheritance is why I prefer this notation). Forgot to change it back. \n. What was this function supposed to do? \n. This reactor is imported too early and you cannot start a gui application because of that (try admmain.py or main.py).\n. endswith takes at least one argument\n. What is [:] for? \n. Don't you want to include also 172.18. - 172.31?\n. Yeah, we should probably run only docker tasks as benchmarks. \n. docker_machine_command call the command so here you receive a result of a command and run the result. \n. I would write \"for which subtask you want to perform...\"\n. I would write \"for advanced verification\"\n. As above \"you want to\" sounds better for me. \n. Maybe we can add that we cannot compute that if \"optimize\" option is checked. \n. Too general. It's about how long provider should wait for full computing task definition. \n. It does a little more (which isn't clear). It reload original settings. Maybe we should change this button name...\n. We should add here short example of supported frame formats ie, 1-4, 10-20;2, etc. \n. Maybe \"accept tasks that use this\"\n. Can you use TempDirFixture for this test and create temp file self.tempdir? \n. Can we change this to ethereum>=1.1.0 \nHigher versions still aren't working on windows. \n. Maybe it would be better to user deferLater or other twisted method? I'm affraid of some synchronization problem and parallel access (and you don't use any locks here). \n. Session is only open between two specific clients. There won't be any other clients in this class. \n. Can you add tooltips to other labels too? \n. The problem with frameless windows is that it's can be quite invisible. Is it possible to add frame, but with closing button not enabled?\n\n. Hm. So let's keep the \"x\" but let's make testing button not enabled earlier (before test is started). \nLater we can show a warning after x is pressed and kill the test (but there's no easy method to kill docker computation before timeout right now). \n. It's not necessary. If the task is finished properly \"start task\" button will made enabled by other function from customizer. \nIt's also a good practice to keep separate issues in separate commits.\n. \"success\" parameter is no longer needed. \n. Should I comment it out or remove? \n. Btw. is it possible to use except Exception in _try method instead of just except? \n. This isn't used. \n. We would like to have \"change_node_name\" function in the future available and node_name is set only at the beginning. It's not really important right now, just a look-out for the future. \n. Can you move it to start function?\n. On windows I get an error: \n\nPicklingError: Can't pickle : it's not found as test_processmonitor.run_exit\n. Part of change_config probably, but I'm not sure yet. Anyway, it's all right, I've just added a node to #438 to remember about this. \n. Hm, I don't think it's a good idea to put this list here.  I suggest adding get_performance method to enviroment and getting this value from there. \n. TaskServer may ask self.task_keeper to get performance from environment using environments_manager. See comment above. \n. renderercustomizer is for all renderers and frame's options are only used for framerenders (ie. Blender but not Lux). This should be changed in framerendercustomizer. \n. Can you move it to FrameRendererCustomizer? \n. Can you change it to use_docker_machine_manager? \n. Documentation said that it should, but it doesn't and account, _ doesn't work on my machine. Maybe it's a version issue. \n. We should probably use 0.000000 notation. \n. Hm, it's not necessary to put it config. Let's move it to some renderdefaults or environment options. \n. Throws exception when transaction system is turn off\n. Can you use  ETH from golem.core.common here?\n. https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/blob/develop/ethereum/utils.py#L408 denoms?\n. One small thing: in other places where ether division is implemented there is also imported float division from python 3. Can you add from future import division here?\n. Maybe better solution is to make it: error_message + \"There is a chance that you RAM limit...\"\n. What's wrong with this test?\n. Why do you remove this line?\n. This None isn't needed. \n. Not needed?\n. One small problem - subtask_id is digit, but it's a little bit too long to realise that some values are shorter than others.  We may \na) change the way subtask id is generated\nb) add some predefine types to this new class\nc)  leave it, it's not very important. \n. Uhm, it's not a very good approach. You're taking into account only the number of frames which may have nothing in common with frames numbers. For example we may have 3 frames with numbers [11232, 13134, 23131]. \nSo we should take into account the maximum numer frame, not number of frames. \nAnd the best approach is to allow user to define this format (number of leading zeros). \n. Also name total tasks may be very misleading here. It may have nothing in common with number of frames. \n. Why do you remove this?\n. Consider using \"with\" with files and \"not in\".  It's just a suggestion, it's not important. \n. Previously ig logged to \"gnr.gui' not a file. It's probably not a problem to log here, but do we have final policy about naming loggers in golem?\n. Can you add c.quit() in these functions? There are problems on windows otherwise. \n. Final frame have name just like \"abc_00007.png\". Frame is saved correctly, but in the GUI it's displayed like \"abc_0_00007.png\" which doesn't exist. \n. I still have a feeling that this description is misleading. More precisely we're padding the frame number in frame name with leading zeros to the given width. \n. This test doesn't work on windows:\n1) OperationalError: database is locked occurs\n2) AssertionError: 0.01098901098901099 != 0.0\n. It's not the same library: restult TypeError: encode() got an unexpected keyword argument 'indent'. On my machine: \n  EncodingError: Could not parse address: '0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'\n\nProbably some package mismatch version. What is the reason to replace format with %? . Maybe it's a better idea to keep Exception here (until we switch to Python3 at least). . Typo in a test name. Would it be problematic to add a simple test for this function and for requested_neighbour_rank?. After discussion with mfranciszkiewicz: this function should be called before start_client_process. \nAlso this file is only used to start gui, and we'll probably need it also for console interface. Can you try to move it to golemapp.py? . This test fails on windows generally, not only on appveyor. .

It was neede to pass a test that was previously broken. Previous test for this function was written in a way that always returned True (even though it should fail).

I can remove this tests if we're sure that we don't want to accept situations when transaction system is disabled / not working properly. . Test get_balance in test_client lines 1144-1146. Can you create an issue for this and attach its nubmer to this TODO comment?. These two functions should be moved in the future to some external marketplace module. But that's just a comment for future refactor, it's probably not worth it to separate them now (in this PR especially). . Can you replace asserts with if & Exceptions? . Just to be clear - the purpose of this checking is just to make sure, that we don't decrease the mask in the first 30 seconds of task computation. Later it shold be regulated by looping call interval, right? . Are you sure that you want to use floor and not ceil here? . One more assert left. If you call reset here, you can also remove self.counting_thread checks below (lines 176-178).. Isn't that too restrictive? What about OSError? What if ValueError occurs?. What's that for?. Is this necessary?. So right now, if there are two Golem instances on the same machine, to connect with the second one with golemcli we must give both  - proper rpc port and datadir, right? . Starting golem with just golemapp (without electron) should generate secrets as well. . What about: return local.major == remote.major and local.minor == remote.minor?. There is TaskHeaderFactory. Unfortunately most of this fields need to have specific values for the rest of the script to work properly (so they cannot be completely random). . It's not needed yet. Will be in the next step. I can remove it and add when it's actually needed. \nRight now way that resources are sent is not really much different than the previous one. \n@shadeofblue Can you show me the part of the code where the resources are passed to Concent?. Size option can be also already specified in options (that should be the case for TaskToCompute (check line 233 in taskkeeper). \nThis option is used to estimate how long may it take to download resources. With ReportComputedTask we want to dowload results so their size should be used. I guess that usage of resource_size in this place was just a heuristic (we assumed that results size won't be significantly different  that size of resources, which of course doesn't have to be true). . Maybe add empty lines in this part?. ",
    "azawlocki": "We may also want to look at https://github.com/ipfs/go-libp2p for p2p protocols. \nGolang only though.\n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/wiki/ipfs\n. On a second thought, it may be just an interface (set of Python functions) for running rendering tasks from test scripts.\n. 1) maybe on_computation_finished, since this is kind of a callback? Or react_to_computation_finished. Some general convention would be useful here.\n2) sounds good\n3) I see\n. This bug causes self to be added to the list of peers.\n. At some point it would be good to separate the Blender-specific part of node.py (~3 lines of code) from the more generic stuff that can be reused with other environments.\n. Sorry, didn't want to close this yet!\n. I like the overall idea. It may be useful to allow sharing of some config files between nodes running in the same host machine. We could have separate --config-dir, with read-only config files that can be shared, and --data-dir used exclusively by a single node.\n. After the dependency on 'rlp' is fixed you can go ahead and merge!\n. How is this different from #91?\n. Does it work on Windows? If so then please merge. \n. Merge at will!\n. Go ahead!\n. Any details?\n. Fine for me but let's try to meet this 80% codecov target.\n. It works on my system, but in the first place, why do we want to assert that an empty dir occupies less than 10000 bytes in the fs? What if there is an fs with block size >= 10000?\n. For future reference: https://github.com/docker/docker-py/pull/360\n. As of 138d27f1dcfa4f43ffea88c882d8b4a504ae216f docker tests pass on Windows as well, showing that docker-py can be used on Windows.\n. See https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/177\n. Done in #177 (merged in 0d88bf2d56e9025ffaef88187e95dff34a57a3cf)\n. What branch is it? I cannot reproduce it in develop.\n. As of 24556fd323bdcfa290f89f655b4ef306aabd6fe3, all Docker tests pass in CircleCI.\nChanges required for Docker to work:\n- For some unknown reasons, calls to client.remove_container() raised exception docker.errors.NotFound (see output from tests at https://circleci.com/gh/imapp-pl/golem/640). The workaround was to wrap these calls in try: ... except, see c77c44ae246ca4e6ce9c993138d941941ca4732b)\n- In create_container() specifying keyword arg disable_network=True caused any subsequent start() on the created container to fail with: \nAPIError: 500 Server Error: Internal Server Error (\"Cannot start container 099e66dbdf74da3f6b25d75720301b31e9c8f86330c77459fda46f7823211002: empty namespace path for non-container network\")\n(See https://circleci.com/gh/imapp-pl/golem/647). It started working when I removed the keyword arg. The effect of this change is that the containers are connected to the default docker0 network interface created by docker.\n. NamedTemporaryFile has 'delete = False' added sometimes, but not here. Why? Is this flag ever needed?\n. I'd just change 'Exception' to 'subprocess.CalledProcessError' and let other exceptions pass through.\n. In this case the program is 'which'/'where' and its returns error if the command we test for does not exist. Our code assumes that 'which'/'where' is available, if it's not then an exception should be thrown\n. In P2PService there's a number of lists and dicts such as free_peers. The function client.add_peers() could add peer addresses to free_peers. It seems that P2PService.sync_network(), which is called periodically, tries to connect to nodes from free_peers if more peers are needed.\n. I don't like the name transferExt. 'Ext' is for 'external'?\n. Or we can store real_balance + 1 in _balance, so that it is never 0 even after withdrawAll(), and have another function (closeAccount()?) for explicitly shutting down an account. Not sure if it's worth extra complication, maybe in future.\n. simpler\n. was uint[] payments in transferExt\n. The same for loop as in transferExt (almost). Can we extract it to a separate function, or have one existing function call another?\n. ok\n. I think so. You decide.\n. Thanks!\n. Test cases in test_address_parsing.py are for the method TCPAddress.parse() specifically. It makes sense to have separate tests for parse_peer() here, to test things like handling multiple peer arguments, passing unicode as argument, error handling etc.\n. I'd mark somehow that ctxand param are not used in this function to avoid confusion (and to suppress pycharm's warnings about unused vars). Maybe _ctx and _param or even use _ for both? I've seen also suggestions to write\ndel ctx, param in the first line in such cases.\n. Forget it. I thought there is some elegant Python solution, if not then adding del is not worth it.\n. Why this address?\n. Why no try here? (Or put Image.open inside previous try .. except)\n. This  os.path.join(get_golem_path(), \"gnr/task/computing_tasks/something.py\") appears many times (at least 8) in the code, maybe it would be better to have it computed by a function, like get_task_path(\"computing_tasks/update_golem.py\")?\n. why not just:\ntry:\n  reactor.run()\nfinally:\n  self.client.quit()\n. Can you please add a simple comment: when is this msg sent, who is the sender and who is the receiver?\n. A typo: \"Subask\"\n. But the param's called subtask_id.\n. I'd make this comparison case insensitive.\n. We should also check that AccountInfos with same key and other fields different are equal.\n. No idea.\n. Looking at the tests in TestEthereumPaymentsKeeper below I assumed the addresses are given as strings containing 20-digit hex numbers. Separate class for addresses is a good idea.\n. I've simplified this to import cPickle as pickle (without try ... except). That's how we import cPickle in other places.\n. You're right, never write in comments what you can write in code. Fixed in 2eff0831aad71e868cf53f0a6654bba19bb77f80\n. Removed.\n. Note that changes related to databases are merged from 0d2ec0810611abd05ee3f5d96349a498034782d2 (I needed separate databases to safely run multiple nodes, each in a separate process).\n. I can, but why bother?\n. Done\n. Done\n. Done, but I'm not sure PEP 8 says from's should come after import's.\n. Fixed (and in other places as well).\n. This is an override of a superclass classmethod.\n. I've removed one sleep() that made a difference.\n. ",
    "chfast": "Do we want do switch to Python 3 or support both 2 and 3?\nIt seems to be quite difficult to support both, mostly because of dependencies. E.g. Python2 has a external package ipaddr (by Google), Python3 has a built in package ipaddress (based on ipaddr) and ipaddr is syntax-incompatible with Python3.\n. At least pyethereum has been ported to Python 3 recently.\n. We would do that if it was up to us only, but we have dependencies that does not support Py3.. @badb are you working on that?\n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/wiki/Golem-Network#basic-messages-shared-between-p2p-task-and-resource\n\nSend information about node2 closest neighboursh: node2 --MessagePeers --> node1 \n\nNot about node1?\n.

We are planning to add something more. Windows builds.\n. Side question: can we remove RSA-based manager?\n. I will leave it then. Any comments about the code changes?\n. 1. We should have it as soon as possible if easy to integrate. It gives users a public port so they can be seeds.\n2. It should not be optional. UPnP (and other similar technologies) are features of routers, so if turned on applications should use it.\n. The issue is about UPnP client implementation, not UPnP per se.\n1. We can look for Python implementation, e.g. https://github.com/skatkov/upnp-client-lib.\n2. We can check if the miniupnp issue has been fixed.\n. It would be nice to separate big mechanical changes (like renames) from functional changes in the future.\n. This sounds good.\nHowever I would like to suggest alternatives:\n1. Simpler solution is to hardcode the list of bootstrap nodes. This can be also the first step of this task.\n2. We can remember addresses of previous nodes in database. No need to prepare special file for that.\n3. The list of peers can change quite often. Do you want to remember all of them? When to save the file? I think the list of predefined bootstrap nodes should be always kept.\n4. If we want the file to be editable by a (power) user, let's use JSON or YAML.\n. Should we revisit this?\n.

See https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/81#discussion-diff-46923535\n2. I think we need another option that tells the node to accept tasks for computation, e.g. --accept-task, --compute, etc. Environments should be passive, a \"requirement\" that makes some kind of task computations possible. After some time we can also introduce \"task filters\" to specify what kind of tasks a node accepts.\n.

We should have a wiki page describing it, also describing individual files and directories in the \"data dir\". \n. Ok. However, consider adding test for get_dir_size(): https://codecov.io/github/imapp-pl/golem/compare/017d052...47be47e\n. All comments addressed.\nThis PR contains also code for Ethereum contracts. It would be better to submit them separately but I hope we can live with that.\n. This is good idea. But let's keep it as a independent package.\n. \"Someone else\" would need to know the proof. So only the lottery participants can do it. Let's consider that later on. \n. Ok!\n. Is this still relevant?. Currently the node can be started from golem workspace by python golem/ethereum/node.py. But we need at least two nodes on two servers and service failure detection.\n@mfranciszkiewicz can you help with that?\n. Current command to run is:\n/home/chfast/bin/geth --datadir /home/chfast/.local/share/golem/ethereum/full_node --networkid 9 --port 30900 --nodiscover --ipcdisable --gasprice 0 --verbosity 6 --nodekeyhex 476f6c656d204661756365742020202020202020202020202020202020202020 --etherbase 6528d9354356d7f668c75e9ed97f792bf910c8e5 js /home/chfast/golem/golem/ethereum/mine_pending_transactions.js\n. Upgrading pycryptodome to 3.4 helped. Not sure due to upgrade or just simply reinstallation.\n. We should better use Qt layouts. Now all the boxes have fixed size. They should auto resize depending on content.\n. Can you add the workarounds as issues?\n. If only renames go ahead.\n. Looks ok. Only comments for considerations.\n.

In case of test_localcomputer.TestLocalComputer.test_computer there is a race condition. The dir is being removed while its content is modified by LocalComputer.\n. You should resist putting trivial renames and new features in a single PR. It makes the review a nightmare.\n. Windows fixed.\n. Please setup AppVeyor CI server (or any other Windows CI if you want to spend time searching for alternatives).. Code looks ok, but tests should pass.\n. What is LocalComputer? It looks very suspicious to me. Another convenient class that takes a lot of params and configures other objects?\nAnd why it is not submitted as separated PR?\n. I lack full picture. Is it possible to have single execution stack. I believe it should be possible to run benchmarks, test tasks and run others' task using the same infrastructure. We should not need TaskTester, TaskRunner, LocalComputer, etc.\nSimilar problem is with tasks  themselves, why the need to have BlenderTask, LuxTask, ... and BlenderTaskBuilder, LuxTaskBuilder, ...\n. In general it looks good. You can merge it if you need it now. I can check details later if required.\n. @badb @mfranciszkiewicz anyone?\n. They will be built faster.\n. Thanks. I will take care of that.\n. Blocked by https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/279.\n. @badb Can you test again on non-virtualized Windows?\n. Using single Ethereum node is a bad idea as mining will take a lot of time.\n. Yes. This is UX issue.\n. It happened to me I had 2 tasks, and the second one overwrote the result of the first one.\nMultiple non-exclusive solutions are possible:\n- Offer the output file to be the named after source file: {name}.blend -> {name}.png.\n- Lock the output file for running tasks.\n- Ask the user if wants to save result into an existing file (confirm override).\n. Yeah.. It's caused by test_dummy_task.py.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/259/commits/06663ea7f5d04ca8dea2a910a352a6835df93057.\n. \n1. The visual style is quite weird.\n2. Left side buttons are bigger than the container. The container should be configured the way it has the size of contents (no sizing by hand).\n3. \"Advanced options\" make the window suddenly much bigger, and when hidden the windows stays big (see picture). Can you consider placing \"Show advanced options\" button on the top of right pane (will be just button there by default)?\n. Moreover, should you remove admmain.py and others to clean up the gnr a bit?\n. Yes, please.\n. @mfranciszkiewicz Can you submit your fix, possibly as a separated change?\n. @badb can we accept this task?\n. This simple change cleans up the code around QApplication. Do you want it @badb?\n. My suggestion is:\n- golem - core Golem libraries used to build applications,\n- golemapp - Golem App (currently for rendering),\n- golemapp.ui - UI components.\nAlternatively, using Python namespace packages (top level package must be empty):\n- golem.core,\n- golem.app,\n- golem.ui.\nI think there should be no rush to change that. And in my opinion it doesn't make sense to make all components super reusable and generic. I would prefer having very simple UI that can be easy changed instead of set of plugins and customizers.\n. This is all about golemapp right?\nSo the layout looks ok, but I would move scripts under tasks.\nPlugin based layout seems to be better. Plugin should define a set of task templates with UI, scripts, environments. But we might want to get there in steps.\n. @badb, can we include that in tests? It just moves some files (as can be seen in https://github.com/imapp-pl/ethereum-payments).\n. The code looks very nice.\n. I don't think it is a good change. It's too chaotic.\n1. Name are wrong. Timeout is a time duration, like 30 min. Deadline is absolute point in time.\n2. A static description of a task should have timeout set (if user wants it).\n3. Timeout changes into deadline when the user starts a task. Deadline is what the network knows.\n. Except 3). Computing node gets a subtask with a deadline. That's is actually independent on task having timeout/deadline at all. \nI would suggest implementing good 3) first. And leaving tasks without any time constraints. \n. You probably should use https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem clone to make pr (just use your own branch) instead of using a fork in https://github.com/banasiakadam60/golem.\nE.g. CircleCI does not build PR from forks by default.\n. Looks ok.\n. Single small issue. Can be merged if fixed.\n. Ubuntu 16.04 / Qt 4.8.7.\n\n. I squashed the commits. Let's wait for another build.\n. @mfranciszkiewicz Can you explain what you wanted to do with test_result.xml? I followed the CircleCI docs. CircleCI seems to be happy now as it can parse XML test report.\n. Small issue with a message text. Besides that looks good.\n. The code looks good to me too. If everybody happy let's merge that and move on.\n. Some suggestions:\n1. I'm not sure it is standard or not, but I've seen and like the config in form of \":warning;golem.*:info;golem.pay:debug\".\n2. Our logging.ini config file sucks. I tried to use it many times but still cannot figure out how it works if at all. Can we replace that with something usable?\n3. Let's have \"info\" level by default.\n. I was thinking more about dividing the packaging changes into pieces and review as PRs, one by one. It does not has to instant. But testing two versions at the same time is not ideal.\n. Also looks like the develop still requires ipfs.\n. LGTM\n. Can we have single react_to_key_error? Also, better name might be handle_key_error.\nCan be merged.\n. Level of golem.pay is to high by default. Can be merged after fixed.\n. After merging in handle_key_error changes I have problem with test_gnrtask.py. I'm not sure which version is final as the same changes are applied many times in different branches. Anyway, functions like GNRTask.get_stdout() do not throw KeyErrors but have handle_key_error modifier.\nPlease remove my last two commits if needed.\n. You can link PR with issues by:\nCloses #398.\n. Only if you know how to do it, you could squeeze some of the WIP commits to make the history look better.\n. In general looks good. The biggest concern is ipaddress package not used where it could be. Try to address the issues and I hope we could merge it ASAP.\n. Address as many issues as you thing is reasonable and merge.\n. I will not able to finish the review soon so please check it yourself, check code coverage and merge. The same for other pending PRs.\n. Fixed in https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/447/commits/7c199c1df535a066404136ae62b3fb51b695986d.\n. Let's create golem-docs repo with Markdown files in it. Testing.md document is a good start.\n. Yes. Should it be a public repo?\n. There are small issues that should be addressed. Can be merged afterwards.\n. I'm not sure passing width and height to task collector explicitly is so good idea. @badb ?\n. Now looks good to me.\n. Closed by #503.\n. https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/blob/develop/golem/client.py#L137\n. Looks and works great. Thanks!\n. Works and looks!\n. Customizer tests are quite flaky. Some issues show up only if you run a series of them.\n. Thanks!\n. Conflicts with #513.\n. Free to merge?\n. I checked, and exec is fine, but some VM implementations are never used, so can be removed.. Still some failures in tests.. Upstream bug report: https://github.com/pipermerriam/populus/issues/209.. I removed populus dependency.. What more than Ethereum account key file do you want to backup?. @mfranciszkiewicz @badb this ok?. Hi,\nThe todo list is mostly the issues list. They are not very well ogranized, but we know how complex is each now. The onse labeled [planned] should have good description and be ready to start, but I can see this set is not complete.\nIf you will have trouble finding anything there for you, we can review the list and mark some task easy to start with.. rmtree has incorrect implementation on Windows. Might be fixed in some Python 3+.. I will try to improve Payment tests later on.. @badb ?. Are you ready to merge it?\n. Resolved by https://github.com/pipermerriam/web3.py/pull/165.. I agree. @badb can you re-label it?. This is back.. Fixed.. The point is python setup.py fails because of it.. Explain?. Something is wrong with the git history here.... This is caused by geth searching for hardware wallets.. geth 1.6.1 is released, so we can upgrade and add --nousb option.. Should this affect also testing of a task?. So this should improve my new sent tasks or incoming subtasks?. Are we doing this?. Fixes https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/971.. This is planned, but not done here.\nI will do this in very next PR. . So?. @badb ?. :shipit:. Windows build works: https://codecov.io/gh/golemfactory/golem/commit/f212e8b81319dffa87c88b03d480ebb700e5e55d/build. @mfranciszkiewicz @badb was this done somewhere else?. No, this is dead end.. No tests for it?\nThis is quite patchy. geth is actually using TCP and UDP ports, but this way you changed only TCP one.. @marmistrz Are you still planning to finish this?\nIf yes, can you separated changes related to Python types from functional changes?. Tx: 0x61ce8fe969ee265072bdbfd90ce4a1a2b2134d89b0a8ca9efb4b54ecffe28d0e.. > @chfast Can you sign the CLA please?\nWhy do I have to do it?\nAnd formatting is still broken.. Moreover, you do you need 2 commits to do this single change?. This does not make sense to me. Why do you start computing tasks you cannot pay for? The payments are not going to be settled until you transfer some additional GNT?. I propose alternative solution:\nLet's assume we control Ethereum account entirely, user can only send funds to it. So the balance can go lower only by Golem actions.\nGolem will be also monitoring if anyone is performing external actions on the account. This is very easy: we just remember the expected transaction count (stating from 0, because we are creating the account on the first run). If the transaction count differs from the expected we report the problem. I think we should stop any requestor actions this moment and report problem to user.. Multiline doc string should be written as:\n\"\"\"Multiline\ntext\n\"\"\"\"\nLooks bad, but you don't want to have \\n at the beginning.\n. Also no space at the beginning.\n. Is this ever needed? Doc of says NamedTemporaryFile \"the file is deleted as soon as it is closed\".\nI would recommend putting assert here.\n. This functions was left empty?\n. Can you replace that with a log?\n. Aren't we sure the file exists in this moment? If yes, replace that check with assert.\n. Can you condense the lines about a process execution?\n. Is this file truly a \"scene\" file, not a \"resource\" file?\n. Replace with assert? See comment below.\n. It would be better if exec_cmd could handle the dir of execution.\n. I don't really get why this dir is needed.\n. Whould you mind removing this blank line?\n. Check not needed.\n. - If node_name is None the warning message will be incorrect. Probably the better default value for node_name would be '' or '<unnamed>'.\n- Is the leading space needed?\n. \"Node Name\" of \"Node name\"?\n. Shouldn't that be an empty string by default?\n. Why that repeats many times?\n. 1. Here we can add param nargs='*'. That will parse --connect addr1 addr2 into ['addr1', 'addr2']. No need to manually parse coma-separated lists. More info: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#nargs\n2. I would consider name other than --connect, preferably --peer, or --peers.\n. I would like to avoid to call connect directly. I want to just add peers and let the Client implementation what to do with that information. Ideally:\nclient.add_peers([])\nclient.start()\nI can be sure add_peers() is non-blocking. Not sure about connect().\nHowever, current version can be accepted for now.\n. What about that suggestion?\n. Yes. It's an transfer() alternative that transfers only external value. I'm not sure it is worth it, but is should be good at least for comparison. Currently it is not even tested.\nIs transferExternalValue a better name?\n. I have similar ideas about that.\nIn the end DApp can/should handle that. We can keep it simple here. DApp/Golem can add another level of abstraction, like:\n- create account: deposit(1)\n- withdraw all: withdraw(balance() - 1)\n- close account: withdraw(balance())\nI plan to send the contract for community review too.\n. bytes32 and uint are binary identical to contracts. However, it turned out it is easier to pack uint96 and address into bytes32 than into uint in Python. In other words bytes32 is better for Python and humans as it informs the data is not a simple number.\nIn general I proposed to extend the ABI with structs like (uint96, address), but that will take at least some time to be accepted. https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/21\n. We can do both. But we will loose gas on that. It is not a big deal for now, but prevents reliable transfer with transferExt comparison. \n. Anonymous method is called when contract cannot match any other method. In case a transaction with value and without data is sent, we can still add the value to the sender's sub-account. \n. No additional costs. It's just solidity feature. As you said, we can catch some user's mistakes with that and prevent the user from loosing money.\nI will track contract's TODO list in #88\n. I would prefer simple command names like start.\n. Can that be just a gnr.Node class, modeled as object?\n. golem.Client should just accept a list in its connect method.\n. As @azawlocki's changes around TCPAddress are already in, can you add these tests to tests/golem/network/transport/test_address_parsing.py?\n. I think if flm_file: is enough. Also remove () in other ifs.\n. Prefer correct \"quick exit\" pattern. In other words: else is not needed here.\n. names.endswith(\".flm\")\n. Do not underscore argument names.\n. How about address.decode()?\n. This is probably an indication that placing dialogs in separated modules is not the best idea.\n. Shouldn't that (Node class) be a part of Client API (Client class)?\n. Let's fix TCPAddress.parse() instead of workarounds. Can be done in following commits.\n. Does it mean \"convert to string\"?\n. Space missing between arguments.\n. Can you add a test that at least actually starts an GNRNode instance?\n. I suspect it is a temporary file added by accident.\n. Contract's address is keccak(sender, nonce).\n. Replace with logs?\n. \"computing_tasks\" is not a good name. I'd prefer \"task scripts\" or \"scripts\" to suggest it is not a Python package.\nAgree with @azawlocki, let's have get_task_script() function.\n. Clever hack, but not entirely right. On some systems appauthor param is ignored. Please use path.join() as:\npython\npath.join(appdirs.user_data_dir(appname=\"Golem\"), \"data\")\n. I'd suggest using single top data dir for Golem. In other words, use user_data_dir(appname=\"Golem\").\n. It's better to have it like:\npython\nself.main_program_file = find_task_script(\"3dsmaxtask.py\")\n. As I mentioned before, that will not work. You will get C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\keys\\golem on Windows.\n. To avoid normpath() you can do os.path.join(appdirs.user_data_dir(\"golem\"), \"save\", \"testtask.gt\").\n. Needed?\n. Why cPickle is better?\n. Depends what you mean. Ethereum account is a 160-bit integer, so no. Python implementation usually uses 20-byte array (still no), but it is common to present is as hex-encoded string, usually lowercase. If this input comes from a user we might consider that.\nI would add some tests covering such cases.\n. That looks weird. Can we make it more generic by providing environments to load, or adjust \"default environments\" before starting a node?\n. We must use logs here.\n. Why?\n. This is not needed I think.\n. But it was not needed in the first place. Does it improve performance?\n. I would keep it as pyethereum does for now, what is a list of 20 bytes. Conversion from string is done by str.decode('hex').\n. Where the 50 comes from?\n. Why to lower only in this case?\n. This function does not even return a EthereumAddress.\n. Exception replaced with a log? WTF?\n. Is there any problem with pyethereum package?\n. Maybe we should use simply normalize_address()?\n. Is that a copy from pyethereum?\n. The repo is named pyethereum, but Python package ethereum. I think it should be from ethereum.utils.\n. Yes, this is very important... log.\n. Maybe it's better to skip -h option.\n. Is it faster than pure Python? E.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1392413/calculating-a-directory-size-using-python\n. Can use use os.path here for joining paths? Preferably (my opinion) as from os import path.\n. The name files suggest there are many of them. How then that is supposed to work?\n. I don't have a full picture, but reaching for a predefined folder is a bad idea. I don't know what feature it provides but we should start thinking about abstracting that (any particular script should not make such assumptions). \n. I guess I've seen similar thing in blendertask.py. Can you at least add a task to distillate common parts from Blender and LuxRenderer scripts?\n. Thanks for new test!\n. I suggest using tempfile module.\nIt would be probably even better to reuse TestDirFixture class from https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/blob/develop/tests/golem/resource/test_dirmanager.py#L9-L17.\n. I don't agree. We should choose single internal representation. Convert only in place where different representation is expected.\n. It looks like \"named constructor\". If it is not designed to be used in other places make it private.\n. Ok. I'm usually add FIXME comment in such places to track \"small tasks\" like that.\n. I don't remember what task_id is, but if it is a binary array than can be wrong.\n. There is also hasattr() builtin function. It might be more explicit.\n. Remove.\n. No. We are using Ethereum private network with id 9. I added the id to the dir name to make Ethereum network swap easier.\n. @badb Here is a helper function that finds free port number on host. That may be useful for others. Should I move it?\n. Yes. In stage 1 we have: value (32b), payer (20b) and maturity (should fit 8b). In stage 2 random value replaces maturity and payer.\n. Can't it be just name=DATABASE_NAME (hint: Python's strings are immutable)?\n. I would use binary or operator | to make it easier to follow.\n. Can you align PID number?\n. Just to make it look nicer as PID typically can be 4 or 5 digit long.\n. I've found a nice way to sort imports: first imports then froms. More in PEP8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id20.\n. No space around =.\n. If cls is not used it can be @staticmethod.\n. Style: remove spaces around =.\n. In general, there are a lots of long sleeps around. Can they be lowered to run tests/simulations faster?\n. Style around default argument values.\n. Does it mean invalid values will not be report in the UI and will not affect the client?\n. Have you tried new syntax:\nself.gui.ui.taskTypeComboBox.currentIndexChanged.connect(self._task_type_value_changed)\nAlso: shouldn't it be \"currentIndexChanged(const QString&)\"?\n. You have tailing space here.\n. Fixed by https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/190/commits/c6bc7e3cd8d4a0ff8055442520c3dd72fb75e14a.\n. In the future we should keep track of the reason the task was rejected.\n. Doesn't it mean that the task does not require any environment?\n. It would be better to allow Environment Manager to decide what it means \"task is supported\". It can be:\n- is environment available?\n- is environment enabled?\n  etc.\n. Why it was added?\n. I call then \"awaiting\" payments. I want also avoid \"pending\" because in Ethereum it means transactions that has been passed to the network and wait for being included in a block.\n. I would advice using plainassert`. PyTest parses the failures very well. Like \nassert ik.get_income(node, 0) is None\n. Something like that. And only supported() should be used by other modules. But that can be done in later changes.\n. Ok, I will revert that. UI changes are planned after the Payment System is working.\n. Is there a chance it is not a string?\n. This is not tested.\n. I will take care of incoming payments later on. This change is all about outgoing payments.\n. We use str.format() for string formatting.\n. Make error mandatory.\n. You can wait in a loop for the expected result. See wait_for helper for Ethereum node.\n. I would call it commonprefix as in Python 3.\n. Why not extracting directly to dst_path?\n. Remove code if not needed.\n. Probably is. I always forget that in Python function is a value.\n. What's wrong with super(). I usually change it in favor of super().\n. Actually \\n is better because std::endl additionally and unnecessary flushes the stream.\n. Does it actually fix the issue reported by valgrind?\nIn any case const is misleading when passing argument by value.\n. Here '\\n' can be used instead of \"\\n\".\n. I think we should keep the address as a single string (e.g. 172.0.0.1:8888). DB does not need to know the pieces of the address.\n. Does it have to be a single transaction?\n. Here you want \"insert or replace\" SQL query. Maybe peewee supports it.\nMore: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3634984/insert-if-not-exists-else-update.\n. Usually I'm against mixing function and non-functional changes in a single PR.\n. You don't have to surround every query with db.transaction(). It is useful only if you want multiple queries be all or nothing.\n. Any changes we can add unit test for that function?\n. How about >=?\n. Still unnecessary const.\n. You can. In case some tests fail I will take care of that later.\nOn Wed, May 18, 2016, 18:35 badb notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nIn requirements.txt\nhttps://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/329#discussion_r63737766:\n\n@@ -20,4 +21,4 @@ Twisted>=15.4\n ethereum-rpc-client\n devp2p>=0.5.1\n cffi>=1.1.2\n-https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/tarball/develop#egg=ethereum\n+ethereum>=1.2.0\n\nCan we change this to ethereum>=1.1.0\nHigher versions still aren't working on windows.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/329/files/a8fc44e7496dabcdc059439f7a4fd64e738a038f#r63737766\n.

What do you thing about Python magic like:\nany(ip_network_contains(net, mask, addr) for net, mask in networks)\n. Why skip?\n. That would saved me some time yesterday :)\n. I don't have to check details here to be sure I've done it right, but...\nWhy haven't you tried using ipaddress package (backport from Python 3), e.g. https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_private.\n. Usually, by \"comment\" I mean add comment in the code for future generations. \n. Have you measured the difference? Is it worth it? We are doing a prototype here. I know it is very slow already, but also less code to maintain is better.\n. I think it will never be used when use_ipv6 == False. So you don't have to even set it.\n. Or alternatively, you can have just self.networks containing v4 or v6 networks depending on self.use_ipv6.\n. You could have used enum here (see enum34). But this is not critical.\n. Is this code needed?\n. Remove?\n. I think it should be @click.option('--multiprocessing-fork', is_flag=True) if there is no value passed with.\n. Please give it a explicit name. E.g. \"golem.task\".\n. Is the empty constructor needed? Is it abstract class?\n. Sorry, but no!\nAggressive version would be self.listeners.remove(listener).\nDefensive version would be if listener in self.listeners: self.listeners.remove(listener).\n. This seems to be overdesigned. Unless there are issues with multiple inheritance in this case, can you make the TaskManager the TaskEventListener? It is enough to rename notice_task_update() to notify_update_task().\n. Not needed if TaskManager would implement TaskEventListener interface. See previous comment.\n. Is it oneliner packed into a dadicated class?\n. Fixed also in https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/499.\n. How is that related?\n. Please removed and if needed submit as a separated change.\n. As the log_name is a full path it does not make sense to pass also the datadir. You can extract the directory name easily by os.path.dirname().\n. I think it is simpler to write it as\nif not path.exists(datadir):\n    os.makedirs(datadir)\n. Small optimization possibility here: you can move the pathName to the chunks vector instead of copying it.\nchunks.emplace_back(std::move(pathName))\nOr alternatively pass the pathName to the function by reference.\nbool addImgFile(const std::string& pathName)\n. Foreach for construction can be used here. It would look like:\nfor (auto& chunk : chunks) {\n    bitmap_ptr img= GenericLoader(chunk);\n    ...\n}\n. This is a bit problematic as we need to open a chunk just to get its height and it is closed just after.\n. I precisely mean log_file is either datadir + LOG_NAME or LOG_NAME. So datadir is either included in log_name or is None.\n. Understood.\n. There is easier way to pass this->width to lambda function. You must add this in the capture expression:\nauto RGBChunkWorker = [this, =, &finalImage](...\nand IIRC you must use this explicitly inside the lambda as this->width.\n. It's better to keep the same type. width is unsigned int, w is int.\n. Set value to millions to see any non-zero digit.\n. Fixed.\n. Not the best idea. We need a function or a type to represent ETH amount. First try should be pyethereum library.\n. Yep. I'm working on it. But will submit as a separated PR.\n. I guess the new_filler should return the .filter_id straight away. Besides you have type in filer_id.. What happens if you omit the \"from\" field?. That make no sense.. Avoid not related changes in other files.. Good point.. Done.. Use \"quick return\" here to improve readability.\n```\nif not definition.options.use_frames:\n    return __num_from_pixel(p_y, res_y, total_subtasks)\nframes = len(definition.options.frames)\n. Can you add the script name to the error message?. Good question.. We are in the process of removing asserts, so please use TypeError here.. TypeError here.. Do not keep the `num` in a dedicated variable. Return as quick as you know the value.. I think we should print error and stop the script.. I don't know what you have decided, by py.test picks up `assert` very nicely -- you will get much better error report than from `assertEqual`.. You can use `asssert` for every check. py.test will analyse whole expression tree attached and will detect comparison operators, will show values of function call arguments, and more. Try it.. Can you replace `assertTrue` with `assert` and run again with `py.test`?. That's exactly what I'm talking about @jiivan @banasiakadam60.\nCompare\nE AssertionError: False is not true\nwith\n\n  assert task.task_resources[0].endswith('docker_blendertask.py')\n\nE       AssertionError: assert ('docker_blendertask.py')\nE        +  where  = 'C:\\Sources\\golem/apps/blender/benchmark/test_task/scene-Helicopter-27-cycles.blend'.endswith\n```. If this is not used in derived classes, maybe remove it and move the value to the property?. You suggest using protected fields instead of private? Can be. Testing might be also easier.\n\nI still thinking about this as a prototype. Here I was experimenting with \"private where possible\" to check how it \"feels\".\nMaybe it's time to setup a document with coding rules?. The docstring must be inside the function.. Shouldn't it be {}?. Let's make system_geth public and that's it.. This enforces other dependencies (Twisted, autobahn, ipaddress), so upgrade of virtualenv used before is not possible.. Why not calling time() single time?. When this can happen?. I believe it was there because gettempdir() returned \"short path name\". Now we use Golem's datadir which comes from other source and is in \"long path\" format already.. For me it is exactly the opposite. The defensive code like this usually hides problems and means we have not idea what our code is doing. I can accept exception here, but not silent break.. 1. .format?\n2. Maybe just \"After test: \"?. You don't like the .format variant?. Instead of passing zpad as an arg, let's try to guess it by checking the length. There is also normalize_address() helper function in pyethereum, but it works the other way around (from hex to bytes), but we can use it as a first step, then covert back to hex.. I'm not sure it is useful, but at least it should be something like Hyperg version: ...\\n.. Fixed. Thanks.. Fixed. What next?. Don't use _raw suffix. We should keep addresses as raw bytes everywhere and encode on the fly.. Is this method needed? If only in UI, let UI to encode it.. Construct the message once.. Why are you removing this?. Please write comments as sentences: start with a capital letter, end with a full stop.. Please write comments as sentences: start with a capital letter, end with a full stop.. Is it worthy to copy the client reference?. Maybe \"Saving keys failed!\"?. Maybe \"Saving the keys failes...\"?. We must specify exactly what kind of keys they are. @badb can you help with this?. I don't know. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1410#discussion_r140773038\n@marmistrz ?. I agree with @marmistrz on this. I forgot that class C(object) and class C is same in Py3.. Should we care about Py 3.3?. I'm not sure using flush() is good idea. This will actually make the Python thread, because it will wait longer on system sync. Let's leave it to library to decide when to flush.. In 3.3.1+ bufsize is -1 by default.. Can add (or confirm one exists) a test where there are some confirmations but not 12?. Oh no. I missed the test has actually 2 stages.. Also add the node to https://stats.rinkeby.io by --ethstats='Golem Name:Respect my authoritah!@stats.rinkeby.io'.\nThere is also one running on pebble on the same port 55555.\nI also disabled web3 module of RPC.. Add comment: tx: 21000, balance subtract: 5000, arithmetic: <800. The ipaddress is a part of Python 3.3+, there should not be a reason to install it with pip.. I think using Gwei is fine, but you can update the comment above.. Is it worth it to put # noqa everywhere instead of making the expressions shorter?. Can you narrow the exception type?. What kind of error happens here? Using local or remote geth?. Name it keccak256(...) for precision.. This check can be moved to get_incomes_from_block().. How about income_value or just value?. Do you mean None here? If yes, maybe we should be specific about this?. eth_available = balance_eth_after_sendout - PaymentProcessor.ETH_BATCH_PAYMENT_BASE\nassert self.pp._eth_available() == eth_available. privkey is bytes..

    "mfranciszkiewicz": "IMHO we don't need this method in an async environment. Also, this parameter might be irrelevant in a new assignment scheme.. This is indeed the case if you're using the same IP address. Pystun opens a UDP socket with the SO_REUSEADDR option, so every instance can bind to the same, default (54320) port number. STUN servers respond to the last known transaction ID, and these interleave when running multiple clients.\nRandomizing the source_port argument of the stun.get_ip_info function solves this issue.\n. P2PService.find_node (called by PeerSession._send_peers) explicitly returns private addresses and ports. Because nodes currently filter reachable private addresses with addition to public ones, both should be sent in the Peers message.. @etam On the other hand, we're always sending a node object ( golem.network.p2p.Node ) in the response, so all known node info is already included in a Peers message. A recent change, which made it to 0.13.0, takes advantage of that fact. Golem now tries to connect to (in order):\n1. a known ip:port\n2. public address : public port\n3. private addresses : private port\n2385 tries to get rid of task_owner_addr and task_owner_port sent in TaskHeader along with a node object, which makes them redundant (and, in some cases, making connections not possible).. @etam self.p2p_service.add_peer and self.p2p_service.add_to_peer_keeper are called when the connection is verified.\nYou've been running this code since 0.13.0.. Yes. I even wanted to incorporate this change into that PR, but it grew a bit too much.. @etam This would only work if the remote node initiated a connection to us, not the other way around. In the latter case, it will be a random port assigned by the operating system.\nCurrently, public ports are read via UPnP (if available).\n. Summing up:\n- node's public IP address is discovered with STUN and also UPnP (if available and enabled)\n- public ports are known only thanks to UPnP, otherwise are assumed to be same as private ones\n- currently, we try to make use of all addresses sent by the other node and filter out unreachable ones (using naive address - network matching)\n- there are few PRs addressing this issue:\n    - #2540 - Allow users to specify the public IP address and ports via command line / config file\n    - #2385 - Cleanup socket addresses in TaskHeader, WaitingTaskResult / WaitingTaskFailure\n    - #2454 - Drop owner_address, owner_port and owner_key_id from Task classes and builders. There are migration tools available in peewee's playhouse:\nhttp://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#migrate\nIn general, the migration process cannot be fully automated. I.e. table / column renaming cannot be inferred from schema changes and would be seen as a drop + create. This part has to be explicitly specified by the developer.. Resolved in #2023. I've modified the connection retry mechanism to include all relevant resource manager methods. The number of retries is limited and needs further fine-tuning.\n. PR #291 - dirty fix\n.

I am aware of what's in the docs. test_result.xml isn't generated when test timeouts occur, and CircleCI-specific timeouts were the problem I wanted to solve. I didn't change back file's location.\n. This issue has been resolved, but it's not related to the develop branch - closing\n. This is a duplicate of #390 and was fixed in #391. This problem no longer appears in a packaged version, also a quick test confirmed that the develop branch should be free of this bug. Can you confirm that #391 was applied to your codebase?\n. There are issues with restarting tasks / sub-tasks:\n- for a partially computed task:\n  - restarting a task does not reset the preview box\n  - a certain amount of time has to pass before sending new sub-tasks (timeout-related issue?)\n  - restarting a computed sub-task changes the corresponding preview part to a red stripe (internally marked as failed?), computing nodes are unable to retrieve new sub-tasks\n- for a fully computed task:\n  - restarting a sub-task changes the progress value, but the preview remains intact (not sure if this is intentional)\n  - task requests are rejected by the requestor (No more subtasks in ... on the provider's side)\n. It's enough to merge the netcode branch to retain connectivity, but it will still be a lot of work. I'm looking into that.\n. The Estimated Lux / Blender performance values are not updated in the UI. Besides that, it works as it should.\n. (Tested on Windows) VM reconfiguration takes place in a separate Thread, the done_callback is also ran in that thread.

On 100%, the preview is incomplete. \nAlthough I don't think anyone would want to that, it may be a sign of some deeper issue.\n. Task assignments fail because environment is not set in ComputeTaskDef.\n. All other changes also get updated. I think it would be better to save benchmark results separately.\n. The progress column takes more than half of the view after maximizing the window. Perhaps some reordering / width scaling would help?\n. @paulperegud Not really. Feel free to make changes.\n. I took the liberty of changing the resize behavior. Users can now resize columns manually.\n. A draft on how it might be implemented:\n- a subnetwork consists of group leaders and group members\n- a group member is a node that:\n  - was provided with priority list of host:port of group leaders and their common pubkey via config\n  - uses the same pubkey as other group members\n  - rejects nodes from outside the group\n  - accepts tasks only from group leaders\n  - maintains p2p connections with all group nodes\n- a group leader is a node that:\n  - was provided with priority list of host:port of group leaders via config\n  - was provided with a whitelist of group members' pubkeys via config (own, lone pubkey by default)\n  - is responsible for:\n    - requesting batches of subtasks (proportional to the number of known group members) from their leaders or requestors\n    - assigning subtasks to group members\n    - collecting information on computed results and forwarding it to requestors (i.e. result hashes)\n  - maintains p2p connections with all group nodes\n  - current leader replicates it's state among the failover leaders (if any)\n  - monitors heartbeats of other leaders and takes over if necessary\nInstead of manually specifying group leaders, an election could take place. At this stage of development, elections could be based on node capabilities, i.e. node being a supernode, then based on bandwidth, performance, etc, without structuring the network or taking network topology into account.\n. Other known issues:\n- batch subtask requests vs reputation\n- batch subtask requests vs nested groups\n- node's group reputation (whether and how it is calculated)\n. A different subtask distribution model will be implemented.. Your 32-bit python installation is most probably trying to load a 64-bit version of libeay32.dll (or a 64-bit version of one of its dependencies). To fix this you can either:\n- Copy a 32-bit version of libeay32.dll to your working directory;\n- Modify the PATH environment variable, so that it will point to a directory with a 32-bit version first.\n. \"Running from the source\" wiki section for Windows has been updated and now includes a full installation guide.. I cannot re-create this issue, please provide more info. Tested on both windows and linux.\n. Please keep in mind that we're in an early alpha stage. There still are security issues we must resolve. \nHowever, this server is a legacy one and is not used by Golem. In fact, Golem will not be using a centralized solution for exchanging resources.\n. Closing in favor of #735. This was a temporary issue. The script should be working fine now.. The issue is not complicated at all - a filename cannot contain a null character (*NIX systems) and a specific set of characters on Windows (':' among others). Apparently, os.path.join rewrote the \\0 character and the test passed.. On a clean Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS installation (started with $ golemapp):\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/bin/golemapp\", line 11, in <module>\n    sys.exit(start())\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 722, in __call__\n    return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 697, in main\n    rv = self.invoke(ctx)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 895, in invoke\n    return ctx.invoke(self.callback, **ctx.params)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/click/core.py\", line 535, in invoke\n    return callback(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/golemapp.py\", line 55, in start\n    start_app(rendering=True, **config)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gui/startapp.py\", line 117, in start_app\n    transaction_system, **config_overrides)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gui/startapp.py\", line 57, in start_client\n    config_logging(\"client\", datadir=datadir)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/golem/core/common.py\", line 103, in config_logging\n    from loggingconfig import LOGGING\nImportError: No module named loggingconfig.

Could you upload the contents of golem_jelly-VirtualBox_nie__5_lut_2017__18:35:09_CET.log?. That's unfortunate. It should be created on start, among golem_client.log and golem_gui.log.\nCould you please paste the output of ./exe.linux-x86_64-2.7/golemapp --gui?. Please download the (full) package from http://52.40.149.24:9999/golem/golem-win32-latest.zip and extract it manually.\nCurrent \"installation\" process does not provide enough feedback and we're working on a replacement.. Please try removing /home/ethereum/golem/exe.linux-x86_64-2.7/libstdc++.so.6. \"Error detecting VBox version: exit status 126\" might appear if you have uninstalled VirtualBox but VboxManage is still present on your PATH. \nTo check if this is the case, run (should be empty):\nwhich VboxManage\nIf you do not have VirtualBox installed, please remove this executable. . You can compile with -Bstatic, which is not what we really want for packaging, or compile freeimage manually.. I'm assuming you're using Ubuntu (or Ubuntu-based distro) - it's actually an issue with the libfreeimage-dev package.\nWe can either:\n- change the linker flag\n- update the wiki accordingly. This was a problem with the faucet web service code. Closing.. This message will be fixed and can be ignored for now.. Hey, addressing your points:\n- peer's version number is not present in PeerSessionInfo (it should be)\n- I think we should settle with app version\n- lets skip GUI for now\nAPP_VERSION is your local app version, instead we can update PeerSessionInfo with app version that ought to be sent in MessageHello. . You may need to restart your computer (or log out and log in again) to apply group membership changes - your user has been added to the docker group during installation.. Please try adding the docker group manually and run sudo usermod -aG docker zlom. Then, log out and back in.. Could you paste the output of sudo docker version?. This issue is most likely connected to #1005, which will soon be resolved. For now, please install docker manually.. It seems that someone has done it: https://github.com/thewtex/docker-opengl. The OS X Hypervisor framework is reporting that your processor is not supported. This means that Docker's xhyve driver is not compatible with your hardware.\nYou can verify the compatibility by:\n- typing sysctl kern.hv_support in terminal. It should print kern.hv_support: 1\n- typing sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string. Your processor should support Unrestricted Mode, which is available in Wolfdale and later architectures. For reference, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_CPU_microarchitectures. This issue has been fixed in the develop branch.. LGTM, except for the merge commit.. The directory that contains your geth binary is not present in the PATH environment variable.. @chfast No, it was not.. Could you provide some more info? Calculate total is not covered by unit tests.. The command line interface requires a running instance of golemapp.\nFor Ubuntu, I suggest downloading and running the installation script.. The installation script gets stuck on dependency installation. I type the password for sudo and then nothing happens.\nAlso, docker installation script warns:\nIf you already have Docker installed, this script can cause trouble, which is\nwhy we're displaying this warning and provide the opportunity to cancel the\ninstallation.\nso we should probably skip updating Docker.. @Radagast-red That is an issue with the new interface and the way it handles previews, not the increased preview resolution.. We should withhold merging until golem-electron[.exe] has been renamed.. Resolved by #1171. OSError: Ethereum client 'geth' not found\ngeth is missing. To install it, please follow these instructions.. Are we removing ruggu altogether?. Resolved in #1193 . Alternative implementation: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1212. Initial 1.1-compatible version of pyelliptic: https://github.com/mfranciszkiewicz/pyelliptic. @badb I believe so. Closing.. Resolved in #1193. Check whether you:\n- can successfuly run docker images in terminal\n  Windows: run docker-machine start golem and follow the instructions from docker-machine env golem first. If docker or docker-machine cannot be run, please add the docker installation directory to your PATH variable.\n- have sufficient privileges\n  Linux: add user to group docker or ~run Golem with sudo~\nIn case of further problems, please refer to https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/faqs/troubleshoot/\n  . The virtualenv section describes an alternative way of managing and installing python dependencies. Docker is still required.. Updating and inserting is covered by unit tests; the new GUI always uses the create function to update presets.. @badb From what you've written, config update seems to be a follow-up issue. The code hasn't changed.. Failed to exectue script golemapp usually indicates that a dependency has failed to start. To make sure that all dependencies are available for Golem, try executing the following commands in a command line window:\n- docker-machine (Windows and macOS)\n- geth version\n- hyperg --version\nIf any of these fail, please try adding the relevant installation directories to your PATH environment variable.\nAlso, please note that running geth manually will cause the client to synchronize with the main (not test) network. Golem currently uses the test network to execute transactions.. @barryleybovich The problem is that geth's port and ipc socket path are both set by Golem. A new geth instance will be started anyway. \nHere's an example invocation: \nC:\\Program Files\\Geth\\geth.EXE --datadir=C:\\Users\\%USER%\\AppData\\Local\\golem\\golem\\default\\ethereum\\rinkeby --cache=32 --syncmode=light --rinkeby --port=53257 --ipcpath=C:\\Users\\%USER%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\rinkeby-53257 --nousb --verbosity 3\nYou can view Golem's process tree to see if geth child process is missing. Process Explorer is a great tool for that.. On Windows, Docker for Windows cannot be used alongside Docker Toolbox. Golem does not currently support Docker for Windows.\nIf you encounter the ENOENT error, try adding Golem's installation path to your system PATH variable.  Here's a guide on how to do that: https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml .. 3 more tests are failing on macOS in comparison to develop (#1358):\nhttps://gist.github.com/mfranciszkiewicz/57b8a328d98ee59f1149c1f9dddca0d6. Those 3 tests are still failing with #1362. Resolved.. @badb The bootstrap node was not updated with the latest changes.. Why not sys.executable?. These start up issues have been resolved in #1384. The easiest workaround is to downgrade geth to 1.6.7.. The current idea is not to terminate core when a user presses the X button, but when you quit the application (resolved in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-electron/pull/87 and merged).. Kademlia fixes: #1474 \nLimiting the number of peers + peer neighborhood: #1491. @gborowik Yes, this issue is affecting all PRs. @Krigpl @etam I've removed the DataBuffer dependency from message.py, in preparation for the upcoming DataBuffer changes.. Closing in favour of #1514. > receiving code was unlinked to drop any Degree messages if someone will post them\n@Radagast-red Golem will actually drop that peer https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/dfab211a4c936da72e3b97cb268e83655805da5f/golem/network/transport/session.py#L92-L96. @Radagast-red I think changing protocol version is enough for now. react_to_degree doesn't really do much, so most of the time is spent on deserializing the message, etc.. Closing in favour of #1527. Geth 1.7.2 automatically rewinds the existing chain to the Byzantium block and synchronizes with the correct chain.\nSolution: upgrade to 1.7.2, remove manual chain initialization with rinkeby.json.. Resolved in #1514. They are all constants (note the caps). None of them is changed in the application. They either serve a purpose of:\n- the one true value\n- default value of a variable\nThe name variables and comments inside the file are, in this context, misleading.. @Radagast-red Can you paste the output of chcp from your Windows console? I have no issues with utf-8 chars.\n. I haven't been able to reproduce this bug. Most probably resources were downloaded after task's deadline has passed.. @maaktweluit Golem actually tries to do that. It stops the VM, updates the configuration, starts the VM and runs docker-machine --shell cmd golem (the --shell cmd part is there for unified output on macOS and windows). \nNote that this is not the issue of regenerating certs, all commands in sequence fail (stop, start, env). regenerate-certs is a last resort recovery attempt. It seems that the VM / env variables are broken prior to stopping.\n. @tomasz-l Could you resolve merge conflicts, please?. Addressed in #1582, however I wouldn't call this a bug. This is a default configuration for the RPC router and clients.. Could you provide the full log? Failing handshakes are unlikely to terminate the RPC router.. Also, OpenSSL libs can be moved to Golem's installation directory. This way we can avoid library version / arch conflicts and make less changes to PATH.. @maaktweluit On Windows, libraries in the application folder take precedence and there is no need to modify PATH (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682586(v=vs.85).aspx, \"Standard Search Order for Desktop Applications\")\nAFAIR \"PATH too long\" in Python 3 installer is for enabling long (file) path support in Windows.. Is it possible to also remove golem.http and related tests? It was created for interrupting HTTP requests sent to the IPFS daemon.. It's not urgent, I think we can wait for those unit test PRs.. I'm also for option 2.\n~BTW, we could upgrade golem's VM just like in Docker Toolbox installer.~\nOnly boot2docker.iso image is updated.. @etam Yes, after pressing ctrl+c you will see a message \"Node shutdown requested\". The point is to not close the router after all clients disconnect.. @etam Your commits specifically? Please elaborate why.. @etam If \"fix pytest version\" does more than it says, then this PR's title is simply wrong. The rest is a matter of personal preference, but I will keep that in mind.. For anyone encountering this issue, here is a quick workaround:\npip\\compat\\__init__.py:70\nif sys.version_info >= (3,):\n    def console_to_str(s):\n        try:\n            return s.decode(sys.__stdout__.encoding)\n        except UnicodeDecodeError:\n            try:\n                return s.decode('utf_8')\n            except UnicodeDecodeError:\n                from ctypes import cdll\n                os_encoding = 'cp' + str(cdll.kernel32.GetACP())\n                return s.decode(os_encoding). + version bump in requirements.txt would be nice :). If we really need to rename it, how about tx instead?. @etam \u201cNeeds review\u201d was removed. @etam Either way I'd have to re-create the thread. Unless \"stop\" doesn't stop the service.. Fixed in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1778. Resolved with the 0.10.1 patchset. @chfast The point is to maintain change history (i.e. request for a comment). PRs can be squashed.. http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html#sqliteq. @mackode Hello, yes we've built miniupnpc for Windows.\nGolem, by default, is searching for free ports if the usual ones are already taken. You can avoid this by setting start_port = 40102 and end_port = 40103 in your config file (Golem binds to 2 TCP sockets).. Thank you again for contributing! I'm closing this PR in favor of https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1859\n  . Closing in favor of #1826. Reopened, changes will be merged with the b0.10.1 branch.. The task was stuck in the \"Preparing\" state because an API request to add resources to HyperG was never sent. This issue is caused by a congested event loop and can be solved by migrating from HTTP requests sent in deferToThread to using Twisted's Agent (https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1816). We now have duplicate commits in the history. @golemUser1 @jiivan Cannot connect to Hyperdrive daemon may appear during startup when hyperg is (still) booting up. Golem has a built-in timeout and will terminate if it's still not possible to connect. I wouldn't consider this an issue, maybe a debug log level would be appropriate here.\n. @golemUser1 Increasing this timeout won't help with the frequency that this message is showing. Cannot connect to Hyperdrive daemon is logged when Golem probes if HyperG is running and cannot yet get a response, because HyperG is performing its startup chores. If HyperG doesn't start, you will see an error message in the UI.\nIn general, that signature verification error shouldn't prevent you from computing tasks. If I understand correctly, you have no issues with port forwarding. Could you check port 40102, 40103 and 3282 (using e.g. http://canyouseeme.org/ ) while running Golem?. Few questions:\n- why is the geth load balancer running on port ~80~ 443?\n- is nginx configured properly on that machine? What about the fd limits?\n- are we sure we want to remove the fallback list? E.g. certificate expiry might become more than an inconvenience.. One would expect a typical http webserver sitting behind 80 / 443. This needs to be changed.\nFallback list aside, we should make sure that nginx is ready to go before merging this PR.. @etam Does that differ from the currently implemented mechanism?. @etam Implementation = code you removed. Instead of HTTP addresses, you would put the HTTPS addresses of (other?) load balancers in the fallback list.. I've temporarily removed secp256k1-0.13.2-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_10_x86_64.whl from our pypi repository; secp256k1 will be build from secp256k1-0.13.2.tar.gz on macOS 10.10. Are you planning on removing FilesProtocol, FileProducers and FileConsumers?. @maaktweluit Yes, these changes haven't been merged to develop.. Fixed in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2553. Well, that's why we have a resource handshake in place - to see if we can transfer resources between peers. And sometimes it's not possible. The message could not be an error though.. 2018-01-24 08:39:30 WARNING  golem.monitor  Port status: 40102: timeout, 40103: timeout, 3282: timeout\nShows that there was an issue with wp31's port forwarding setup.. @wp31 Port forwarding is not required if your router supports UPnP (IGD). This doesn't seem to be the case, unfortunately:\n2018-01-24 08:39:29 WARNING  golem.network.upnp                  IGD: discovery error: no devices discovered. @Elfoniok You\u2019re right. This PR is more of a PoC, but seems to be working properly. A review of changes introduced in the pyelliptic fork would be much appreciated.. Oh, and WIP comes from using a pyelliptic 1.5.9 branch of golem-messages, despite the needs review label.. pyelliptic dependency has been moved to golem-messages. Closing in favor of #2048.. @maaktweluit Neither version locking is implemented in Docker's homebrew formula nor are there version specific formulas available. It seems we will have to implement a workaround.. A manual docker-machine restart golem resolved this problem. The machine was most probably running while docker was being upgraded and the VM wasn't restarted by Golem.. Resolved in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2098. @tworec Yes, we support 3.5+.  Did you compare 3.5 and 3.6 on the same machine?. We are using 3.6 exclusively on macOS.. We want to keep the code backwards compatible with 3.5; this does not imply that we don't support Python 3.6.\nPlease note that:\n- tests and releases for macOS are built with python 3.6,\n- tests for Windows are done both on 3.5 (AppVeyor) and 3.6 (buildbots),\n- release binaries for Windows are built with 3.6,\n- our wheel repository at https://builds.golem.network/simple is populated with both 3.5 and 3.6 wheels,\n- most macOS and Windows developer machines are running 3.6,\n- 3.6 isn't a first choice because it's not available by default on Ubuntu LTS,\n- we do fix incompatibilities caused by development done on 3.6.\nStating that we only support 3.5 is not true.. @maaktweluit Directories are unique for each test and will be removed in tearDown (thanks to TempDirFixture and DatabaseFixture).\nOh and yes, there are no issues with buildbots, fixes are already there. Will do when I get all the reviews.. Migration scripts need to be updated due to changes in develop and #2068 (to be merged).. Tests are failing due to missing migration scripts. Awaiting PR: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2077. Changes are formal, since I\u2019ve introduced 2 new field types for peewee_migrate compat. Db schema does not change.. @etam You already have your answer. Please either approve or reject and specify the reason.. This is a duplicate of https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/issues/114 (resolved). Closing.. @mdtanrikulu fixed in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3702. Resolved in #2163. I'm not really convinced that managing remote geth nodes should be a part of EthereumTransactionSystem. Why is this change required?. @etam Well, we use the sync (requests) version of the hyperdrive client mainly during startup. This change won't affect runtime too much.\nWhat happened to sessions for geth clients?. assert_called is a method introduced in 3.6. How will headless providers skip this step? Or is it going to be mandatory, e.g., via CLI?. Could we also log the active preset configuration (e.g. on change)? IMO that would allow us to have some insight to why some jobs are failing.. Resolved in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2158. This issue seems to have been caused by verification callbacks, run outside the main thread. reactor.callFromThread([callback]) fixed that (version 0.12.0).. @jiivan Most probably. I've added a comment there.. The None value here is a conn_id. conn_id in logs is in no way correlated with node's id, so it provides little information to us. IMO this should be refactored or removed.. @Krigpl Please do; you are more familiar with the sci code.. There are 3 separate issues here:\n- [x] reconnecting to remote geth servers and recovering the state (sync, stale payments, event filters)\n- [ ] sending pending task results (https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/2223)\n- [x] querying providers for task results.. I don't think the API is that simple, since this is not a message queue. Sessions are lost on both ends, and sending a mid-protocol message requires consistency (on both ends). Pending task session's data may be redundant, but at least it's complete.\nPlease correct me if I'm missing something.. @Elfoniok The main database is mildly congested at times and the second database is there in order not to make the situation worse.. @jiivan Another approach would be to store session's state outside the TaskSession class and implement the message queue. Are there any plans for the latter?. @etam https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2317. I broke the dam. You should also remove the transaction_system param in tests/golem/tasks/dummy/runner.py. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2354 (recently merged) introduced the mainnet argument for Client. Could you update the value of self.mainnet in __init__?. bad_alloc is a sign of running out of memory. This could happen if verification was running in background.. macOS. But it seems that \u2018data\u2019 is not bundled by PyInstaller.. Closing in favor of https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2448. @Krigpl Thanks for pointing that out, it's been addressed.. @maaktweluit Most of the changes were merged just before the code freeze. We also have to update the website. Related to #2554. Cast and send as a str.. Thank you for reporting, wiki has been updated.\nThe --nogui option no longer exists, golemapp starts in headless mode by default.. BTW duration is calculated as timeout - remaining_time, which is not supposed to be a constant value like estimated time to compute. . What's keeping this PR away from being merged?. It looks like more tests need updating.. Golem binaries are built for the x86-64 architecture, whereas the Pi board is based on an ARM processor; it's not possible to run the released binaries. Also, Docker images are pre-built for the x86 architecture.\nThe only option to run Golem on a raspberry is to install it from source, build the Docker images by hand and manually build / link or start HyperG before running Golem.. I guess we can close this now.. Golem-Smart-Contracts-Interface==2.1.0 or 1.2.0?. This error often appears when you use the WS connection from another thread. NetworkConnectionPublisherService should call client.publish in the main thread (reactor.callFromThread).. Refactoring LoopingCallService is not in the same scope as fixing this bug.. @badb agreed. I'm hijacking this issue.. @shadeofblue Could you remove this issue from your backlog?. I have a gut feeling that this was supposed to be 1.6.0. That\u2019s another way to solve this issue :). @Wiezzel Benchmarks can take time on slower machines (looking at you, Blender), but since the first run is always the longest, IMO we can wait for the results. Either that or we can ignore performance <= 0 for now.. Newer versions of crossbar are broken on macOS - they use psutil.Process.cpu_affinity which is not available on that system.. Realeased with v0.19. I'm OK with this solution, but I have a question to all reviewers: is it better to build the extension as a part of Golem sources or to only have the pyext library as a dependency, but keep the sources in the same repo?. @Wiezzel @maaktweluit Please review the changes in 55d9ad7.\nFew things have changed:\n- usage of the psutil package instead of a custom ps function\n- ~reading the running configuration from the process command line\n    Docker writes the configuration to a file on exit, so this was bad from the UX point.~\nEdit: this was a bug in current implementation.. @Krigpl Please refer to https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3241#discussion_r213968763 . If this class didn't depend on timer management (reactor) it could simply be a dict of str: list.\nI've removed the singleton logic and added a get_n-like method. Please re-review @maaktweluit.. As we've talked offline, pythoncom.CoInitialize() needs to be called on a per thread basis. I don't think that the second import is a bottleneck, so the whole initialization process can be packed into a single function.. pyssim is also a dependency in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-verificator but doesn't seem to be required there either.. You're right, my bad.. I believe we should validate the output crop size within the app during task creation.. If I understand correctly, task requests will be tracked by the marketplace module?. Idle is the time not spent on downloading resources, computing the task and packaging the result.. Not really, the market document only states a need for the idle time since last computation.. @Krigpl Will do, I guess my IDE did not know better when resolving conflicts.. It's the same with CLI when explicitly running an unsupported benchmark. The problem is that the RPC connection dies.. @Krigpl @tworec I've reverted the changes.\nElectron is being fixed, independently. CLI now catches benchmark errors. Clients are responsible for proper error handling, otherwise the connection will become unusable. This goes for all of the RPC methods.. Now we need to store those prices in place of current max_price * subtask_timeout calculations (i.e. compute_subtask_value function, TaskServer.requested_tasks). @jiivan @shadeofblue Task headers are supposed to be (mainly) immutable and we have to resolve this issue somehow.\nWhat I can think of is:\n- add a creation timestamp property to the immutable part of the header (there has to be one)\n- make task_id a derivative of Hash(FixedTaskHeader) and exclude it from the fixed part. . @tworec Could you identify when it happens? It's never random.. This doesn't seem to be related to the reported issue. I've encountered issues with building Docker images with Golem during startup (macOS). One problem lies in moving the entrypoint.sh script.. Is it possible to change the amount of memory assigned when the VM is suspended?. I'm doing that right now.\nIt's develop, not release. The images are automatically built by Golem.. The pull will fail since the image is not published to Docker Hub. But then it defaults to building the image and fails to do so, which is the main issue here.. Please fix line endings in golem/task/tasksession.py. @dybi If we change the line endings, it will be difficult to review existing PRs. No other reason, really.. @Krigpl Why has this already been merged?. @maaktweluit @Wiezzel Please re-review. Not really. Signing was probably used in the old delta-resource mechanism. This has been fixed in pypiserver 1.2.2:\nhttps://github.com/pypiserver/pypiserver/releases/tag/v1.2.2\nbuilds.golem.network is running v1.2.0. But why?\nAre you planning a transition from twisted to asyncio?. We should at least check if WantToComputeTask.price == TaskToCompute.price. Is this change really needed for 0.19?. I've uploaded the wheel, feel free to remove it and deploy your own package if needed. @ederenn This looks like some other bug. Could you please test this on Linux instead?. @mplebanski How is it blender specific?. The flattened directory structure change was never supposed to be implemented. That approach was use-case specific. This preserves the original directory structure and is the expected behaviour.\n. Is the issue here that subtasks die while downloading or that the task is not assigned to any other node?\nIn case of the latter, please re-assign the issue. Hello @JulianMaurin, these images are supported only on Linux systems with an NVIDIA card.. LGTM, though I wouldn't merge this yet, unless no one uses Golem to build their Docker images.. @Krigpl The reason is that not every image can be uploaded to Docker Hub. E.g. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/compare/amdgpu?expand=1. Locally installed driver libraries and configuration files need to be added to the image and they must always match what's installed in the host os.. There is little use of enforce in the codebase. It can be removed.\nMost of the wheels on builds.golem.network need to be updated.\nLinux:\n- OpenEXR\nmacOS:\n- OpenEXR\n- scrypt\n- secp256k1\nWindows:\n- cytoolz\n- miniupnpc\n- netifaces\n- numpy\n- OpenEXR\n- pyethash\n- pywin32\n- scipy\n- scrypt\n- secp256k1\n- Twisted\n- zope.interface. @shadeofblue @etam Please consult the RnD team first.. The idea is not new. This is exactly why you should talk to RnD.. Please make sure that:\n- your docker-ce version matches the requirement of nvidia-docker2\n- you use the proprietary NVIDIA driver\nYou can test that everything is working properly with:\ndocker run --runtime=nvidia --rm nvidia/cuda:9.0-base nvidia-smi. ~This issue should be resolved by https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3985~. Just to be extra safe and avoid collisions while extracting (tmp_dir is a uuid).\n. This shallow copy is unnecessary. Thanks for pointing that out.\n. Newest version breaks client API version compatibility on CircleCI\n. Yes, peewee supports upsert queries. The thing is, it matches all data, not only the required ip address and port.\n. It's also useful when the transaction isolation level is not known (the underlying db engine will probably change), and we want to read only committed data.\n. TCP keepalive is a native connectivity check built in a networking stack. If the underlying transport is not TCP-based, setTcpKeepAlive method will not be available.\n. I was going to, and also wanted to respond.\n. See my note below\n. This bit makes the check much faster for multiple addresses\n. I've done synthetic tests. What I haven't done is app profiling focused on processing delay, which will surely show that the impact is small, as there are other areas in need of optimization. I'll remove that code to keep it simple.\n. Yes, this chunk of code is commented in order to ease app testing. Nonetheless, this part will eventually be rewritten.\n. In packaging this part is active and instead, TCP keepalive was turned off. This results in faster connection teardowns. It might be a good idea to keep this part or separate it.\n. Will change_node_name be a logic's method or a part of change_config? If so, there will be no problem keeping it up to date. Inserting a yield / deferred call here complicates testing.\n. In this case, there is a value\n. It should be ok to pass by reference.\n. get_or_create returns a tuple. Maybe it should be\naccount, _ = Account.get_or_create(node_id=self.get_client_id())\ninstead?\n. log_name is not always a full path. Note the if ... else above.\n. Yes it is, but it doesn't take multiple processes into account. It might (and does) happen at the same time, leading to an error.\n. Well, my choosing of datadir as a keyword is probably misleading. It could really be any directory, e.g. /var/log/golem.\n. The reason was that some new errors related to killing the geth subprocess popped up.\nWhen you interrupt the app with Ctrl+C, all subprocesses receive the shutdown signal. If you close the GUI, the process monitor detects a dead subprocess and exits the application. The app shuts down either way (or at least the 2 main processes). We currently have problems with terminating geth, but that's an issue to resolve in a separate PR.\n. Or maybe just remove node_info and rand_val keys in PeerSessionInfo?\n. Misspelled deadline\n. Maybe something more like this?\n```\n        for postfix in ['ETH', '%']:\n            if t1.endswith(postfix) or t2.endswith(postfix):\n                l = len(postfix)\n                t1 = self.to_float(t1[:-l])\n                t2 = self.to_float(t2[:-l])\n                return t1 < t2\n        return t1 < t2\n@staticmethod\ndef to_float(t):\n    try:\n        return float(t)\n    except Exception:\n        return 0.0\n\n``\n. Could we avoid (deep)copying listeners?\n. I moved it toremove_peer_by_idwhich will be called ifstored_session == peer_session. Wouldn't it be better to select multiplePayment.costs in a single query? If you're concerned with query size, you can:\n- split the query into batches\n- later on, when a task <- subtask mapping is stored in the db, query withtask_id` (hopefully soon)\nPlus, how about storing a (lazily initialized) sum and updating it on each payment?\n. On second thought: I think we should postpone the optimizations and merge this PR.\n. Let's just remove this line\n. False instead of should_wait?\n. Done\n. The __file__ is there by mistake (it was supposed to be __name__). I've renamed the logger to golem.core.\n. OK, the interactive mode will have to be set explicitly\n. expected is assigned a value prior to the actual test. The outcome doesn't change, though, and the assertion still holds.\n. if os.geteuid() != 0:\nmight be less straightforward but IMHO is better.. Do we need both tasktype and task_type?. Perhaps we could use package directories (e.g. rendering.__path__) to avoid ... gui/view/icons.qrc. StopIteration will always be raised while working on valid streams; I think we don't need a debug log here.. This block will always fail on Windows.. Or simply \"task\" :). We might want to update these paths. if not docker_images would handle empty lists. You can use if not ... to catch empty values. if not self.key_id:. This test expects that no messages were written to sys.stderr. assertIsNotNone does not check whether it is an empty string. The same goes for lines below.. Does not check for empty values.. supports returns a boolean. self.total_tasks may be 0. Not needed. ~F.e. when someone uses a directory listing method which includes special \".\" and \"..\" directories~\nLone '..' should not occur here.. You could also validate the value of ipfs_id. ipaddress.ip_address. IPv4 addresses only.. self. return True. if and returns will no longer be necessary.. ... docker_image.tag == self.tag. There's a bug in session protocol and connections are dropped prematurely. This will be addressed in a separate PR.. This file uses the same format as other .ini files. Perhaps rename as version.ini?. service --status-all | grep -Fq 'docker'. Maybe try checking $? instead?. $?. Previously, the expected path was golem/../ instead of golem. Does this change work as intended?. I think it's not that easy. We should be able to automate builds using CI. Re-running tests should not change the version.. Is it possible to use current directory / a directory relative to current directory?. We also should use semantic versioning, but this could be a separate PR.. False will be returned anyway. This could be merged with the if block few lines below. DictSerializer converts python objects to dicts, it does not perform serialization per data type.. if root != '.' and root.split(os.path.sep)[1] in excluded:. It's persistence :). Please uncomment. Not needed. Not needed. Could preview_x and preview_y be defined as floats?. return os.path.join(self.tmp_dir, \"test_result.flm\") ?. Please link hyperg to (e.g.) /usr/local/bin. Please update.. Please also install and add hyperg to PATH. qt5-defaultlibffi-dev. we still need qt5-default, package names were concatenated. Unfortunately this was required for appveyor. The newest version of crossbar broke dependencies on windows.. I agree, it needs to be fixed. But it doesn't work when user is logged in as root, see https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/1006. Maybe it's not a big deal, but % formatting is inconsistent with the rest of the project.. ShowInformation. Maybe just in case something changes in the future:\n(^\\s*Time:\\s*)(\\d+):(\\d+\\.\\d+)?\nOr something like that?. Please change it to ==. cffi==1.10.0 is an explicit dependency of crossbar.. I just continued the style from lines above. We should probably change this.. For continuity, maybe comp.tasks.preset.[remove|save]?. I don't think this is true. Or is it?. Done. Please see the updated border generation code. \"\".join(warnings) is not unicode. Typo in FOUNND. Maybe create a constant for \"BMP\"?. \"BMP\" is not parameterized. \"BMP\" is not parameterized. You can use DictSerializer.dump(cfg_desc, typed=False) instead.. @banasiakadam60 Don't we install docker with the official installation script (https://get.docker.com)? IMO this should be removed.. This package is windows specific. For Python 3, we have to use the development version git+https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller. Please see @jiivan 's comment. This function returns a tuple. This change belongs to a separate PR.. After the change, this part is (IMO) much less readable. Please do not put values in a new line.. Could you create an Enum for these error keys (environment_unsupported, environment_not_accepting_tasks, etc.)?. It seems that ok is always set manually and we're not taking advantage of the default value. Plus, desc could be initialized with a default value, e.g. \ndef __init__(self, ok, desc=None) -> None:\n    self.desc = desc or dict()\n    .... Since this is not a single instance of SupportStatus, please rename. If I'm not mistaken, this cast is used exactly once. Maybe use is_ok instead?. The name strongly suggests a bool return value. Judging by the name, I'd expect a bool return value. This could also take advantage of SupportStatus-like class. And they will still be able to. But not in core.. The script in question is executed inside a Docker container. These constraints are ineffective, because cpu_count will be limited by the VM (Windows, macOS) or cgroup (Linux).. Same as docker_blendertask.py. This will list available / assigned CPU cores that may go well above VirtualBox limits. Not available on macOS.. config = sync_wait(Settings.client.get_settings()). It's been moved from TaskServer, I'm not removing dead code here. Not yet. If I'm reading it correctly, this benchmark is blocking the main thread. Can we execute it in background?. Fixed in #1426 . This updates the version according to the latest tag, for some reason develop is still in 0.8.0. I will abstain from bumping the version above the limit here.. It's been moved to the parent (mixin) class.. Probably, in most cases, yes.. I don't see why this cannot be a private(ish) function.. But sometimes with different parameters (emulating successful resource downloads / uploads).. Comments weren't changed while porting from Python 2 to Python 3.. Yes, it should be fine. ''.join is just faster.. Actually I've tried replacing all byte counts with constants and the code was IMO less readable. I'd like to hear another opinion.. The setup script automatically updates the version and it's pointless to fight it with every PR.. I believe that this is ok in tests.. The base Message class is not instantiated in the application. Where is that message from?. This will be used in the near future. I agree on hiding the method. EDIT: actually, it's still needed outside the class.. Though 100 bytes is by orders of magnitude too low for this test, it seems that b''.join is not faster in Python 3.. I'll revert changes all changes made in databuffer and address them in a separate PR.. Without more refactoring, these are still needed for signature verification, done outside the class.. I've added TYPE = None to make the linter happy, but this part will fail (0 and up are reserved, negative value is not really possible). Overall, it doesn't make much sense.. The difference is that decrypt_and_deserialize was only used in tests, so I did that freely. I suggest leaving this for the DataBuffer-related PR.. That is the case, it doesn't (always) return closest neighbours. Maybe this test should be moved to #1474?. node_num is never passed via command line (line 195). As a matter of fact, it is not needed in this version.. develop, unlike devp2p, tries to bind to the next free port if current one is taken. There is no need to manually manage ports. And currently, hyperg's port is not set by Golem.\nThis file could probably be left unchanged. The removal of unittest.skip and changes in DummyTask itself should suffice.\nIt's up to you whether you want to:\n- add node_num and have better control over assigned ports\n- revert this file and keep the changes to a minimum. BASE_PORT is used for Golem's ports, not hyperg. \nEvery Client checks if a hyperg instance is already running. The problem here is that requestor and computers check for presence of hyperg (almost) at the same time. The first one succeeds to bind, the others fail because port 3282 is taken. Typical race condition.\nThere is a possibility to change listening and rpc ports in hyperg (try --help), but it is not currently possible to do so with Golem. \nWays to resolve this:\n- computers spawn only when requestor's hyperg is running\n- hyperg is running in the background, prior to starting the test\n- an option to disable hyperg daemon manager; used in computers\n- an option to define custom hyperg ports in Client and daemon manager; a command line arg for golemapp.py would also be nice\n- start computing nodes with an arbitrary delay (e.g. sleep?). So the problem lies somewhere else, still hyperg will be an issue.\nPort binding:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/b0506b28a4b548f1ff315332c82cfe935f003470/golem/network/transport/tcpnetwork.py#L246-L254 ...\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/b0506b28a4b548f1ff315332c82cfe935f003470/golem/network/transport/tcpnetwork.py#L371-L378. In Python 3.6, there is a random.choices(collection) function. We can backport it to 3.5 from here. Can we increase this value to e.g. 160 to prevent line folding?. Logs in Geth are already formatted and we can see prefixes like [INFO], [ERROR]. Maybe it's enough to print GETH, instead of geth-out and geth-err?. No, only 3.5+. We reset the state in case someone wants to retry starting the node.. We're not blocking and trying forever. public_nodes is a shallow copy of random_public_nodes(), and each node is popped from the list on connection.. Will do. You should probably check this before calling self._data_to_messages(). If we receive a message of size MAX + 1, we append it to the buffer and read it in the next step. The buffer is now empty.. Please do not remove this property, it's still useful for stats / debugging connectivity.. Yes, it's returning None in case the response evaluates to False (empty string, collections, None).. enabled is currently for enabling / disabling concent requests. It will probably be removed soon.. Yes, reactor defines global values and installs signal handlers. We do not want that on import.. It's queued instantly if there is no delay (and put in _queued), otherwise a deferred call to _enqueue is saved in _waiting. It doesn't seem that it's queued twice.. There are no calls to ConcentClient here, but I've added explicit checks to test_loop* methods.. Done. Done. FIXME added. Conversion to list is superfluous. Could we avoid using loggers prior to configuring them?. It\u2019s also meant for external usage. In that case ConcentRequest.STATUS.Initial doesn\u2019t seem appealing.. Serialize requires a signing function (+keys), which isn\u2019t available further in the call stack.. I don't think passing private keys around is a good practice. Currently, message type information is needed and further deserialization is an overkill. Maybe passing both is a good idea.. _raw is already present in Message but only populated for ingress messages. Done. Done. Done (using object). I think it would be a good idea to call image.close() wherever possible, instead of waiting for the GC.. image.close(). img.close(). image.close(). image.close(). img_task.close(). img.close(). img_task.close(). Thanks, I forgot to change this - at one point there was a where clause. Unfortunately Service uses a fixed-interval looping call. This service locks on a queue and saves messages asap (apart from sweeping old messages, etc.).. Well, it's the \"other\" node. Depending on context (local / remote role, message class) it may be a receiver or a sender.. Ok :). Will do. Done. Yes, ConnectionError means that there were problems connecting to HyperG, whereas HTTPError means that there was a problem with the request. In this case, resource_hash is not known by HyperG, so we should add those files again.. task.task_status is not used outside this file, so I've removed it in favor of TaskState.status. I've created a common interface for Services (called IService, derived from ABC). Also, Service became ambiguous, and it's now named LoopingCallService.. Doesn't this create a Hyperg.db directory in C:\\BuildResources\\hyperg and bundle it with the installer?\nYou can change hyperg's directory with a --db param.\n. That's good to hear. Yes, it is used in other places. BTW this part of resource management is going to be refactored.. Could we use a msg_dict and create a NetworkMessage instance here? Returning True on error is a bit misleading.. Sure, let's address this issue in a new PR.. Maybe\nwhile os.path.exists(new_fname + extension):\ninstead?. Unfortunately each web3 provider throws different types of exceptions (ipc socket, http from requests, value errors) and error handling varies in each. The assumption here was that we are connected to the client and these exceptions are temporary. I did not want to assume that we're using the http provider only.. As far as I can tell, ValueErrors are thrown when the json response contains an error property. This is specific to the HTTP provider though.. Good point. client was created every time to support client configuration change on the fly. That is not done in Golem (now) and probably won't be.. I'll change the code to use a single Client instance.. The count should be 1 since we want to increase the pool size exactly once (see the AsyncRequest.initialized check in __init__). Resulting files can be big. We can't afford to calculate checksums here and block the event queue.. list is done on purpose, since peers can be changed during iteration. 2nd comment: Generator expression must be parenthesized if not sole argument. Those in front are the oldest. What do you think?. I can do this the ring buffer way - either drop the newest ones or overwrite the oldest, but the latter seems overly complicated for this use case.. IMO this message could include the message class and remote peer's address. The latter is not available here, so this might have to be logged in Basic/SafeProtocol.. The test is still the same - an exception was raised on first retry. The exception is not on the \"retry\" list, so we stop the execution.. I think you are right - this change was not needed.. Just a question - why not client instead of token?. It might be a good idea to move all constants to a separate file.. hyperdrive_ports (currently one) are a set, so there is no indexing, and next requires an iterator.. A successful response from hyperdrive will contain its listening addresses / ports, unless it failed to start (and requests will throw a connection error). I could put a guard here but I believe it is not required.. I believe the constants in mind are DockerJob.WORK_DIR, DockerJob.RESOURCES_DIR, etc.. self.p2pservice.peers is always available when self.p2pservice is constructed; this call is actually a check whether self.p2pservice is equal to None.. self.task_server.task_manager is always available when self.task_server is constructed. Besides task_server being None, this looks like a bug in get_task_dict, which assumes that every task_id argument is present in task_manager.tasks.. Return type annotation added. Yes, the migration module calls this method.. Having both golem.model and golem.database, the former is not an obvious location for a global database object. But moving db requires many additional changes and I'd rather see it done in a separate branch.. I see nothing strange in rebuilding indexes here, and peewee_migrate probably does this as a safeguard. In fact, migration / upgrade would a good place to vacuum the database.. Also, the imports are not organized correctly. This is only one of the issues with scripts generated by peewee_migrate.. Please restore options here - a proper version of quickfix introduced in 0.10.1 will require these.. Same as above. Oh yes, I missed that, thanks. These dels aren't really needed. Doesn't the regex below already check the length?. Do we really need to limit the character subset to ASCII?. Resolved.. Done. I took a slightly different approach here (basing on a KeyError). I've also moved the check_version call to the top of start - that was actually a fix for running hyperg instances.. Missing 'e' in message. Indent on the next line. It seems that this method is unused - is it a part of a bigger changeset?. Or simply !=. Typo :). remove_forwarded_session_request seems to be missing. Maybe move it to new_session_prepare?. I'll add missing trailing slashes for consistency's sake. +1. IMO start should be refactored to do exactly what _start_node does. Probably in another PR.. The (lambda) function returned by _error could do a reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop) / reactor.stop() after logging the error.. Please avoid global reactor imports. Done. Maybe \"retrieve\" instead of \"construct\"? + Information on task / subtask id; sometimes it is hard to tell when log messages interleave. . Used only in on_error, we can skip a fetch from the database. It's supposed to be more than current capacity.. I agree on double underscores, but strongly disagree on calling nested / private functions and unmangling arg tuples being a cleaner solution.. @shadeofblue Right, I missed that bit.. Good point, I've added an error handler. if self._reactor.running: should be safer to use. Alternatively, you could do something like while reactor.running and conditionally raise the exception outside the loop.. Could you also start docker when RPC is ready? That would provide users with error / status information.. eth_available for gas?. I believe that price calculation belongs to the Task class, since all the implementation details are there (headers, prices, timeouts).. IMO this function could be a simple balance check. What do you think, @badb?. IMO this value should be defined in golem_messages and have a sane value for clock desync tolerance (i.e. less than 5 minutes, currently). Here we actually verify whether the now + timeout value defined in task's header is (almost) the same as subtask deadline received in ctd. Also, we try to take clock differences between peers into account.. In other messages, task_result.package_sha1 is prefixed with sha1:. Done. Please keep the protocol id an int or make it always be a string.. # pylint: disable=broad-exception. Since the config file isn't updated, please remove this mapping.. Thanks, (probably) a rebase went terribly wrong here - it's not even the right if condition.. thanks, my editor's import feature broke the comment. It logs and propagates errors to the returned Deferred object.. Done. This will block the main thread for 100ms. \n~This might not be the best idea here, but maybe we schedule retries in the event loop?~. PendingMessage is enough to send the message, but might not be enough to correctly process the response and send the following messages; e.g. self.result_owner is required in some places.\n. Will do. Will do. Is it safe to assume that we have enough ETH for the transfer / conversion?. Could you change this call to if not self.mainnet? is_mainnet() has been moved to Node in rpc_pass branch. The name suggests a different result order :). + some error handling. Isn't self.crop_counter always 0?. Ack, thanks.. It is necessary from a linter's point of view.. Could you surround it with try ... except?. IMO we should call _result.errback, since _result is returned by this function. Maybe we should do task_created(...).addErrback(...) in the calling function?. Can be replaced with filter(None, subtask_ids). I wanted to make these the true overrides. It's true that it makes little sense to force the public IP and ports with UPnP on, but now we have a --noupnp flag.. We already do in except. I've moved it to the end because it affects tens of tests and is not required to build the instance.. It sounds better; rejected and overdue do the exact same thing though. If the comparison inside the try block raises other exception, everything is handled in a single except.. Consistency is what I did here explicitly - this function is written in the same style as other functions.. If I had a nickel for every missing exception type fix.... # pylint: disable=no-self-use should be at the first line of function definition. You probably want to use .format. Otherwise the exception payload will be a tuple.. @maaktweluit We're using a wildcard for ini files in that directory.. Could you decorate sync with @report_calls(Component.client, 'sync')? This way we can inform the UI on what's happening and show a message to the user.. It's not altered in this loop, but elsewhere, probably in a callback from another thread.. It doesn't - the callback should be either guarded with a mutex too or fired within the main thread. Either way, this fix produces a preview that reflects the state at the moment of calling.. ~Shallow copying won\u2019t cause a context switch.~ (edited: this one is wrong; still it does not matter at this point)\nWe\u2019re not iterating over a dict itself here, but over a view of it\u2019s items (with an iterator). Copying references to those items at one point will prevent the \u201csize changed while iterating\u201d from occurring.. A mutex would solve this issue in another way - the dictionary would not change until this loop is done or the loop won't start until the dictionary is changed. There is no guarantee that mutex will help with producing the actual state of the preview. And neither does this solution.\nThe real race condition here is in img_task.save. return bool(self.docker_machine) ?. Copying and extracting should be moved to a separate thread.. Minor: id is a keyword, task_id seems good enough.. You are blocking the event loop for the time required to copy and extract (potentially) gigabytes of data.. Could you add an error handler?. Are payments per payee summed?. Could you also add node_name, node_id and task_id to these messages? That would provide clear information as of who and why.. Please see my other comment regarding logs. Unfortunately, currently there is no such parameter.. @Krigpl These checks have been moved to should_accept_provider. Uhm, since we now have a 7-element tuple, maybe it's a good idea to format the return value as (e.g). a dict? And get rid of all \"None\" strings, simply return Nones.. drop + add (rebuilding) indexes isn't harmful and may even be desirable in the current state. We should implement some other machinery for that purpose, though. Could you remove these lines ?. Can i haz (in a former fashion) comp.environment.performance.min as get and comp.environment.performance.min.update for updating? Or does it cascade changes in GUI?. We've talked about this (semi) offline; could you create an issue for setup.py develop migration + data directory changes?. yield (+ inlineCallbacks) isn't required here, since get_min_accepted_performance is 100% synchronous. A straightforward call should suffice.. Same as above. I'm sorry to interrupt, but golem_messages shouldn't try to define the protocol.. Doesn't look like a change for the better. Empty list seems good enough. Needs type annotations and changes in GUI.. Please don't break the convention - this tuple has 2 elements. Was a single donation per application run intended?. Unguarded updates of _gntb_reserved are fine for now, but are prone to future errors.. Please replace the magic value with a constant. tasks may change during iteration (each _run call is delegated to a thread). Maybe the task_owner entry should be mandatory and validated?. It seems to already be the case in validate, where error messages expect a valid task_owner. Could you add some logs here? The same goes for decrease_task_mask. Now they both fail silently. \ud83d\udc4d . Enum. You can decrease the level of nesting with\nif not ...:\n    continue\nfor both conditions.. self.k_size - int(math.log2( node_id_distance(peer, self.key_num) )). = 0 for the sake of consistency?. Could you rename this to something like encrypted_package_path?. HardwarePresetsMixin is a mixin class for golem.client.Client; this method handles the env.hw.caps RPC request. Spoken too soon - these lines cannot be simply removed. reset does not modify the counting_thread property.. _process_queue should be called only if we cannot start the verification process or the verification process has finished (via callback), not when _run returns.. Exception type needs to be more specific. In case of a really broad range of exceptions, add # pylint: disable=broad-except. @Krigpl are you sure? p should hold the reference to payments at the time of definition, different for each loop.. Is eth for batch payment always a part of locked eth? What about providers?. Our front-end uses a bignum library, that's an issue with the RPC serializer.. IMO strs would be a better option. Maybe REASON.Refresh? AFAIR that was the one used before.. Those values are not constant and had to be changed. That additional logic needs to be tested elsewhere. But why are we then testing the same deterministic outcome 3 times? This test is assuming a bit too much about the environment.. The problem is that sometimes this test fails, because each update_config call reads hardware caps independently and that can change (i.e. free disk space). I made it always return the same value, which is retrieved from the current hw configuration.. I sincerely thought that this test was supposed to verify that applying the same hw configuration more than once won't trigger a \"hardware changed\" event. In production, we care only about the real environment and do not care about the values in fashion that this test is written in.. The logic that tests invariance of hardware parameters.. Could you handle the case when get_task_message returns None?. > None here would indicate some major bug imo\nAnd we don't care what happens next?. deferred.addErrback(lambda _: self.fail('reasons'))\nassert deferred.called\njust saying. Typo-h in accounta. You can replace this try ... except block with a handle_task_key_error or handle_subtask_key_error function decorator. It does the same thing with less changes.. Should be task.get_progress(). Could you add more information to this message, e.g. task_id, node_id, node_name?. I think we should return False here - we're sending WaitingForResults instead of CannotAssignTask to banned nodes.. Minor: could be simplified with ctd set initially to None. Minor: code is copy-pasted, maybe a function instead? . The market algorithm should not understand what WantToCompute is, only take a set of input parameters. We need an additional layer which translates this kind of message into a parameter set.\nPlus, IMO we should be able to have multiple queues, this way it will be easier to manage timers and separate offers for multiple task ids.\nWhat we also need:\n- persistence\n- scheduled queue sweeping / explicit removal from the queue when a task is deleted, restarted (basically deleted and created anew) or finished. IMO we can move the VerificationQueue and VerificationTask out of apps.blender sometime in the future.. Any thoughts on making the queue persistable?. Are you sure that race conditions won't occur in can_run / run?. It would be helpful for verification_context to return a Deferred object, so we can decrease the number of callbacks we pass around. start could simply raise an exception.. It's there\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/48921417e18aa054e76fcfcbed8d6a1a3ab7eee3/requirements-win.txt#L1-L5. Whoops, fixing. == ''. cpu_cores_available is severely broken at the moment (https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/3037) and can throw a wide range of exceptions.. Here - agreed. Yes, this was probably auto-generated by the IDE and overlooked by me.. If help fails, an EnvironmentError is raised and Golem will refuse to start.. Timeouts will vary between pulling images and checking vm's status. Should every command have one?. docker and docker-machine commands already have timeouts built in. I wouldn't add another layer of complexity that will bring new problems to the table.. Ok, will do.. The point was that mem, cpu and cpu_cap are guaranteed to be constant.\nWith Enum we would have to use something like EnumName.property.name or have enum values as keys.. I'm not against Path, but to me it seems to be an overkill just to have a nicer dir join syntax.. It's included in start. open terminates instantly. Fixed in subsequent PRs.

I think it's just as clear as map but here we don't care about the results :) Could be renamed to for_each though.. That's the thing - I also initially thought we would need something like a get_n function.\nThere are 2 approaches here:\n- count based\n    Wait until we get n offers. n could be bigger than the number of subtasks, but this may slow down the job assignment process.\n- time based (this one)\n    Every timeout we take all the offers. If n is greater than the number of subtasks, we choose the \"best\" ones. There is no guarantee that we will have a pool >= number of subtasks.\nBut maybe you're right and this structure should handle both scenarios.. E.g. to re-add items that were taken out of the pool.. That's true, we can have only class methods and import the reactor lazily.. _pools are private-ish, so this could be a common method instead. This indirection doesn't seem to be unclear though.. Yes, should probably be less magic.. It's a simple get but renamed to make it clear that it does not modify the pool.. What's the use case for get? I don't get the intent behind your question.\nIt's a convenience method and a part of drain. Since it is safe to use and doesn't modify the pools, it became a part of the public interface.. Soft requirements were provided here and here. Implementation details are left to the marketplace developer(s), because the initial assumptions (i.e. constant pooling time) may prove impractical.\nThis method is a proper way to resolve drain + add situations. There is no specific use-case scenario behind it and I strongly disagree that we need one to make a method public. Refactor as you please.. > It will be way more beneficial and less wasteful if we all agree on the same conventions\nI don't think this questionnaire is a productive and healthy way to propose changes.\n\nEach public method adds a maintenance cost \n\nWe're discussing a blatantly common get method for a pretty generic collection wrapper. If you are thinking about other methods and this is just an example, please speak your mind clearly. If not, I don't think we're producing any value here.\n\nI doubt this is a proper response\n\nThis PR is not the place to agree on conventions, also with others from @golemfactory/clay not participating. I'm leaving for vacation for the next days and won't be a part of the decision process. If you believe that \"refactor as you please\" is not appropriate, then please do not introduce changes to this PR until I'm back.\n. Hm, if we reach self._retries and raise here during startup, Golem will shut down. I believe some previous change was addressing that issue. \nWe could return a {\"error\": str(exc)} dict here instead of None.. No longer here. Why not CamelCase?. Could you extract the creation of crsb_users?. Does this line work properly when multiple IP addresses are assigned?. Entries will be duplicated when address.host == \"localhost\". The thing is that localhost is the default value. You can pass a different address for crossbar to listen on, e.g. -r 127.0.0.1:60111 or -r myrig:60111 so that won't be enough.. @Wiezzel Yes and that's where the question originated from.. self.tasks seems redundant - it's only used for writing.. Maybe self._timed_out?. stop_task is not the same as \"timed out\". I think it's worth renaming and hiding (e.g. as _verification_timed_out). \nPlus, maybe you can use named keyword arguments (task, event, etc.) for readability?. A warning / error perhaps? E.g. \"Verification timed out for subtask %r\". I'm not sure if the message will be duplicated, but this one could use a higher log severity.. Maybe \"ComputerRes\" could be a constant?. Is this directory also shared with SMB? AFAIK it's %HOME%\\AppData\\Local\\golem\\golem\\default\\ComputerRes\\tests without the testnet or mainnet part. . If the issue lies with accepting results, maybe this block should wrap the self.accept_results call instead?. The idea behind it was that you can safely call comp_finished as many times as you want and won't be spammed with log messages. I'll change it and hopefully that won't be the case.. Whoops, the call was not committed. Yes, these changes were merged in the meantime.. Actually, it's called after self.task_server.send_results which is responsible for packaging the results. Typo :). Providers may disconnect in the meantime. They shouldn't if they want to compute a task. But if they do (for whatever reason) and we assign a task to them, self.send(ttc) will fail and we'll be basically waiting for the subtask to time out.. A simple sanity check for the current session should do the trick. Should we worry that this could be called multiple times instead of once, e.g. due to a bug?. This part could be moved to a separate script. Unfortunately we need a specific order of operations and SubtaskOp is an Enum. This psi can be set / tweaked independently.. The marketplace doc has 4, which is a better fit for current implementation (SubtaskOps). I've reverted this change, since writing and op and op.subtask_related() isn't really nicer. isinstance also checks for Nones. Either that or cancelling the deferred returned by deferLater. I know. That document treats verification failures as computation failures.. I've changed the type to tuple. This and the following line can be written as offers = cls._pools.pop(task_id). Could you move this block to a separate method?. You're right, this happened due to some external changes. I've removed the delay from this branch (requestor stats) and will cover the issue in provider's one. Just a small remark: we don't know what we're executing (sync / async), unless we have the debug mode on :). Can we move this code to the Hyper-V hypervisor class? This workaround will also affect macOS.. This line is missing. Why remove the len check?. Could you log Creating Docker VM in parent().create?. IMO we could do as you suggested - let's move this logic to the DockerMachineHypervisor class. But I'd suggest moving to setup and make create responsible only for creating the VM (i.e. no recovery process).. Yes, I missed that - thanks. WORK_DIR is exported as an environment variable (see docker/job.py). The problem here is that this max memory does not reflect the settings in the UI. In fact the user is not in control of the assigned resources. \nI believe this is both a UX issue and a one with max memory calculation based on total memory. ~IMO we should try to force-swap some memory (as we've discussed).~. Maybe this could be useful (in the future):\n\nThe memory cost associated with running a guest operating system on a Hyper-V virtual machine was observed to be approximately 300 MB for the hypervisor, plus 32 MB for the first GB of RAM allocated to each virtual machine, plus another 8 MB for every additional GB of RAM allocated to each virtual machine.. I believe a follow up issue will be fine. Well, it's clearer when pad_memory doesn't do more than its name says. Besides, I can see no benefit in storing a volatile configuration - it will almost always differ from user's settings and cause a VM restart.\n\nActually, there is one more thing to do for comparing configurations - to make them aware of padding.. Taken straight from ms docs, will update. It will limit the result. I don't believe it's something we should optimize for, even if it takes 20ms.. I cannot see why it obscures code since it strictly follows the API and naming conventions.. Sure, I can rename it. It's called enumerate because the main thing it does is call EnumProcesses. Same as above - it calls OpenProcess. It could be, at first I implemented it like that. Somehow it feels like the event as an argument fits publish_event better, but that's my opinion. - set_publisher was the initialization function, called once. Now it does more, so it's been renamed\n- registering the event handler here keeps the relevant logic in one file\n- we avoid coupling using the dispatcher. It proved useful for implementing your suggestion below.. What is the impact of removing the numpy.float32(min_y) conversion?. Maybe move this line to golemfactory/base?\nThis directory is actually enforced by Golem while creating the container, but since WORKDIR is already here, maybe it's a good idea to set the default value.. The only difference is the -r flag, the initialization and cleanup are copy-pasted. IMO these should be merged into a single script.. Yes, it should. It was mistakenly auto-indented by the editor.. AFAIR this was introduced because sometimes the border was off by 1 pixel. It's OK if that's no longer the case.. @Krigpl This was accidentally removed in a previous PR and effectively disabled the su-exec (privilege drop) part in entrypoint.sh.. That's because entrypoint.sh resided in core/resources/images/scripts and the scripts required by image_metrics are placed in the provided root rendering/resources/images. It was not possible to build the image.\n. This file is derived from develop. @Krigpl Yes, this should be patched for 0.19. @bidzyyys This code wasn't removed but has been moved to docker/task/task_thread.py. Please remove the newly added lines from this file. We might want to update the monitor with these new fields. This reflects the current functionality, other changes may be introduced after this PR is merged.. This PR changes the entrypoint without touching anything non-Docker, say apps, with 25 files modified. Payload is already here and trivial to remove.. I'd suggest moving the latest to golem/apps/rendering/resources/images, so all images can be built by Golem automatically. 'python ' + container_script_path is hacky. DockerJob in this state supports non Python payloads.\nWhy removing Payload is so important?. I'll prepare some other approach, without the Payload class. I don't want DockerJob to know anything about the command.. Yes, but I'm leaving this for now as it is.. I'd suggest not to update dependencies now unless there is a strong reason to do so. Maybe if not isinstance(result, dict) and put it before DictSerializer.dump?. Could add a fixme with the issue number?. We could clean up the sources and intermediate build artifacts to decrease size of the image. It looks like task_keeper.get_task may now return tasks that have no subtasks left. AFAIR the headers are removed and ids are kept in task_keeper.removed_tasks. Maybe get_task should also exclude those?. IMO we should raise an exception here, so that the other side (CLI or GUI) will know the cause of failure. Please replace underscores with hyphens, that way it will follow the naming convention of other arguments.\nWhy do we need a new argument name here?. Virtualization is not enabled per se, it's simply not required. I'd treat this fix as temporary. Maybe this call should be simply skipped by the UI?. ",

Can be closed?\n. Seems like this feature wouldn't be very useful - based on Todd's answers, the most common way of rendering animations is saving frames in separated image files. Besides, some of the video formats supported by blender use system-dependent codecs, which would probably be hard to manage in Golem. We can consider supporting some simpler formats (like AVI Raw or AVI JPEG), but it can still result in problems (for instance blender animations can contain sound, which may result in further problems with audio encoding, etc). So all of it looks like requiring quite a lot of work.\n. yes it is\n. What are the symptoms?\n.

It's because of JPEG compression distorting small crops differently than big images (locally generated reference vs. provider's result). We can't do much about it, except discouraging users from using this format or dropping its support. In the future we might want to add a new parameter defining compression level, but most probably JPEG is rarely used by blender artists, so I wouldn't consider it a big problem, at least for now..

It was a workaround for tests on Circle not running.\n. Please rename logger to \"blenderreferencegenerator\" or \"blender_reference_generator\" (accordingly to the convention used in this repository). rename to \"get_pixel_centers_offset\". +1. I prefer simply importing \"numpy\" over importing it as \"np\" (but it's totally subjective - I'm suggesting a change, not insisting on it). Should inherit from ImgRepr.

Let's leave it for now, we'll see in the future if we should add error handling. please change the docstring accordingly. Pycharm claims: Expected type 'List[dict]', got 'List[Union[bytes, str]]' instead. Cant this be done using params.__dict__ or something? . this file is suspiciously similar to apps/core/resources/images/scripts/install_py_libs.sh. Golem-messages can't serialize float32s, and we believe this whole double-float32 conversion isn't really necessary - it should be removed completely in the future . But AFAIK it's not used by anyone yet? We can re-publish it. The name of this variable is very misleading, it has nothing to do with resolution. Please find better name and change it in all functions in this file.. and, of course, analogically for yres. Please refactor this method, it's hardly readable in this form.

    "etam": "@badb @mfranciszkiewicz \nQuestion:\nIn P2PService.find_node if node_key_id is None we might send peers we haven't received hello from. So we're not sending key_id for example (the node_info field might be None and node_name might be an empty string).\nBut in P2PService.try_to_add_peer the logic assumes that key_id is there.\nSo: Do we want to support sending reduced info like only (IP address, port) pair?\nIf yes, then P2PService needs refactoring around try_to_add_peer method and incoming_peers dictionary. If not we just need to cleanup find_node method.. @mfranciszkiewicz \n\nOn the other hand, we're always sending a node object ( golem.network.p2p.Node ) in the response, so all known node info is already included in a Peers message.\n\nAre we? As I wrote, PeerSession.node_info is None after creating the PeerSession object and is set a value in _react_to_hello. If we send Peers message while we haven't received Hello from other node, we're sending None in \"node\".. Oh, ok. So in Task message we can just send a list of serialized Node objects? Dicts created in find_node seems redundant.. We have a lot of ways to detect our network:\n- stun to detect public ip\n- connecting to DEFAULT_CONNECT_TO, DEFAULT_CONNECT_TO_PORT to detect which local address is used.\n- calling monitor ping-me to have ports checked from outside.. There's one thing we're not detecting, but can be implemented: public port.\nWhen connecting to other node, the remote node can send in a response hello the port which he sees the connection is coming from. This could be also used to detect public IP (this could replace STUN).\nThis could  work for P2P and Task ports. Hyperdrive should handle this by itself and report it's public port to golem.. >  In the latter case, it will be a random port assigned by the operating system.\nRight. My knowledge about networking needs some refreshing.\nSo, in case someone manually creates a port mapping on router, where external listening port is different, then it seems there's no way to detect it.. Why was this issue closed? It's still not resolved.\nThe resulting binary is still not statically linked.

Fresh vagrant image of ubuntu xenial (16.04) does not have 'python' command, only 'python3'. We've migrated golem code to python3, so I think the install.sh should also use it.. Well, yes.

This happened to me too, and I wasn't debugging nor blocking golem in any other way.\n\nI think this happened, shortly after I created a luxrenderer task. There was some precomputation going on in the background and then golem died.. I've installed latest 0.9.0. Still no golem logs.. @badb can't test it now, because 0.11.0 fails to run with openssl 1.1. Once 0.12 gets released I'll test it.. With test binaries of 0.12 it seems fixed. It's a good practice to rename files in one commit and change them in second. This way git better tracks renames. (In this case I need to use \"git diff -M10%\" to see what changed in renamed files). If we have constant set of methods, then using dict is not a good idea. Better use enums, or leave it as is.. @ggruszczynski you said you've done something in this direction. Do you have any comments?. #1654 is not merged yet. ReReview plz. The import seems OK, so I don't know why this error appeared. I've implemented some tests though.. Looks like it (a subtask) was killed by OOM (Out-Of-Memory) Killer.. I think there's nothing to be done. This happened, because the computation required high amount of memory, and it reached the limit. It's something that will happen in real life.\nThe question is, was it reported to requestor and properly handled?\nYou can try to reproduce this by reducing the amount of memory of the provider.. We can also detect \"exit code 137\" in message and append \"probably killed by out-of-memory killer\" to the log.. Second TODO in tasksession.py and one in test_tasksession.py should be resolved before merging, I think.\nIt's because I'm not sure if or what is needed there. This is a complex state machine and reading the code isn't much helping.. Temporarily approving for slow tests to run.. typo: advanced. @maaktweluit it's not related\n@kascheri12 I'm curious about AVI format used here. How did you create this task? Did it work with earlier golem?\nThe \"this is not my subtask\" message is a misinterpretation in KeyError exception handling. It needs to be fixed.. This is not a bug.\nThis message does not need to be visible all the time. If there are some payments to be made, they're done every 10 minutes. This message says that there is a payment waiting to be done.\nExample:\nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] Next sendout in 15 s \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] Peer count: 25 \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] ETH: 0.0207827 \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] GNT: 445.8333333333333 \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] Next sendout in 2 s \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] Peer count: 25 \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] ETH: 0.0207827 \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] GNT: 445.8333333333333 \nDEBUG:eth.chain.tx      deserialized tx tx=b'8f624b46'\nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] Batch payments: bec052, value: 3.333333 \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] Peer count: 25 \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] ETH: 0.0207827 \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] GNT: 442.5 \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] Checking 0xbec0 tx [4] \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] Peer count: 25 \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] ETH: 0.02004654 \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] GNT: 442.5 \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] Checking 0xbec0 tx [4] \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] Confirmed 0xbec0: block b7364db00ea85da79cf5e5254be3e7399f4bf96ee57673c44d9b133e4c8d6\n06f (1372253), gas 36808, fee 184040000000000\nAfter that the message is gone.\nThen I created a new task, it got rendered and the message is again appearing, because there is a new payment to be done.\n@kascheri12 If you think you found a bug in sending payments, please add more details and reopen this issue.. If I run golemapp from command line, pressing ctrl+c causes a clean shutdown. Will it still work this way?\n(I'm totally incompetent in the golem <-> crossbar relationship). @mfranciszkiewicz Please don't squash my commits.. @mfranciszkiewicz Because they are supposed to be separate, with their own commit messages. Now it makes no sense, that commit titled 'fix pytest version' does also something different. It's not a big issue in this case, because the squashed commit is small, but I really hate those huge commits that changes bazillion things at once.\nI also use various git features (like rebase interactive) to keep the history nice and clean.. @mfranciszkiewicz Yes, I agree, that the second commit goes beyond what this PR was about. I should have created a second one for it.. Should I move pyelliptic repo to golemfactory?. It's not working with mac yet. I'll fix that.. It's not working well. I'll reopen this if I get something better.. When sending a list of nodes, they are taken from P2PService.peers. Nodes are added there after their version is verified in PeerSession._react_to_hello (to be more precise, after responding to ChallengeSolution or RandVal message).\nSo even if in database there are nodes still running old version, seed won't send them to other nodes until it connects with them and verifies their version.\nI don't know how bootstrap_go works yet.. It seems that bootstrap_go works similarly.\nThe completely different thing is that it needs to be updated to the latest protocol.. > If we really need to rename it, how about tx instead?\nI'm not sure. A bit too abbreviated for me. Requires about 2 or 3 additional cycles of brain processing unit to parse.. \\<offtop>\nWhat if I told you that unit mismatch could be a compilation error?\nhttp://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_1/libs/units/example/quantity.cpp\n\\</offtop>. This is so big I don't even know where to start reading.. I'll make a new issue for that, because it seems it's different. #3230. Maybe it would be cleaner to use composition, instead of inheriting from Thread? This delayed initialization of Thread class looks like a dirty hack.. @mfranciszkiewicz recreating Thread object is much cleaner solution.. Presets are stored in internal database. We also keep the SCHEMA_VERSION in the database. If it changes (no matter up or down) we make no migration. We just drop all tables and create new ones. So presets that are stored in it are lost.\nCurrently there is a difference in SCHEMA_VERSION between develop and b0.11.0\nSo the easy solution is to say \"it's not a bug, it's a feature\". The harder solution is to start supporting database migrations.. #191. The connection problem and \"no active journal\" are both caused by node running out of file descriptors.\nI've created a PR #1887 that might help with the situation a bit.. This is also corelated with this:\nDec 21 16:29:38 drohlum golem-bootstrap-go[17327]: Peer connection from 200.69.141.134:58738\nDec 21 16:29:38 drohlum golem-bootstrap-go[17327]: Peer session error: unsupported msg type 55324. Based on input from @Krigpl I've changed the design a bit. Instead of having a separate file with allowed nodes, everything is in deny.txt. Adding a line with ALL_EXCEPT_ALLOWED makes it an allowed list.. golem-electron part: golemfactory/golem-electron#192. #1862 is fixed\nThe first backtrace comes from this: At BenchmarkManager.run_benchmark we pass a string to the error callback. But it should be an exception http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5948\nhttps://github.com/twisted/twisted/commit/8a9e920d63accc2ad14dc4069f07c8ceed96d47e. I think that if we want to have a fallback, it should be just a second host with the same nginx reverse proxy.. @mfranciszkiewicz Yes, because it allows to still use https (falling back to a not encrypted connection is, I think, a Very Bad Idea).\nWe could also go completely the other way. Setup nginx reverse proxy without load balancing on every host with geth and do load balancing in Golem, like it was before.. @mfranciszkiewicz That's true.. I've changed the pull request. Now it's just using rinkeby.golem.network as an another geth instance.. rebased onto current develop. There is an issue with using rinkeby.golem.network as a reverse proxy with round robin multiple backends. As @Krigpl said, we make some stateful operations, so we have to connect to one geth instance and stick to it.. Meanwhile I changed the PR to just stop trying to download a node list from rinkeby.golem.network.. Let's continue the discussion at #2041. I got the same error, when trying ./golemcli.py envs recount DUMMYPOW. rebased onto develop. Use _client instead of __client?. Updating pylint is also a good idea.. @Krigpl good point. Deleting code looks nice!\nBut why are there submodules?. Code was refactored by @Krigpl. Not relevant anymore.. I came with this idea: Instead of actively sending RemoveTask message, there would be an additional field in Tasks message with the contents of TaskHeaderKeeper.removed_tasks. This way the info about removed tasks would nicely propagate throughout the network without flooding and with timeouts we already have implemented.. Ok, so I did it this way: if the task header is removed from TaskKeeper, the message is propagated. If it was removed before, it's not propagated.\nThe ids are removed from removed_tasks after 3 minutes. I wonder, if it's not too short? It is possible, that the message will propagate through the network infinitely if there's a loop where message propagates slower than this timeout. I don't know what is a reasonable timeout in such case.. Do you have any tests for SmartContractInterface? You're removing all it's instances from tests and replacing it with mocks.. The IP address is of one of our ethereum rpc servers. This message means that golem has already open 10 connections to it and it tried to create new one..

But keeping a session to hyperdrive seems reasonable, right?. > What happened to sessions for geth clients?\nThey are managed internally by web3 library. @jiivan I think it would be more complicated. You'll have to handle RemoveTask and RemoveTaskContainer messages differently. In this PR RemoveTask already behaves like a container, without any bloat added by nesting messages. It can also be extended to have a list of tasks.. > Could we also log the active preset configuration (e.g. on change)?\ndone. do we want this also in b0.12.0?. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-smart-contracts-interface/commit/53e200662940d9c269101030f1d14390d735d938#r27656022.

Oh, so it was already fixed by #2162 . Does that resolve #2059?. @badb decided this should be this way for now, but it should be changed before mainnet release. See #2213 \nI don't know if just throwing an exception is a good enough solution.. Also, in logs peers are referred by name or id. This log line shows some UUID, so it's still hard to get what's wrong.. This is because PeerSession._react_to_hello sends Hello and RandVal or ChallengeSolution one after another.

OK, from now on, the floor is supposed to be wet.\"\nI also dislike that we have \\r\\n line endings in some files. On the other hand my Emacs has no problem with handling those files, so I don't even notice it. And making it harder to do git blame is a real problem. I think we just need to live with it.. 607521caa - @mfranciszkiewicz it's your fault. @Wiezzel The thing is that there was earlier (about 2 weeks ago) a change of line endings, so the history is already destroyed. In this case I don't care anymore.. It's being done as part of https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-internal/issues/82 by @Krigpl . While on it, I think we could follow this guide: https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/a-better-pip-workflow. I think that, like in geth, mainnet should be used by default and testnet used when requested by --testnet flag.. Here https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/commit/03b7c37527e6fcb4c62b2fcb4d37a60327e36a1a you can find additional features:\n- logging used blockchain in golemapp.py\n- testing Node and Client classes for passing mainnet/testnet flag. One more thing: it's more readable to prefix boolean variables with \"is_\" or \"use_\" or something like that. Just \"mainnet\" can also be some complicated object that represents the blockchain.. Noooo! My image reaction is broken :(\nHere: https://media.giphy.com/media/GCvktC0KFy9l6/giphy.gif. Hello?. I'm late :(\nBut I'd suggest making ImgRepr implement context manager interface https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typecontextmanager and use with statement as much as possible.. I'd extend this to implementing pagination to any rpc method that returns a list of something. Incomes, payments, tasks, subtasks, network peers and so on.. @wp31 0.13.0 was released a week ago. This fix was merged yesterday into develop branch. It'll be present in next release.. @Krigpl how about now?. Note that this is quite serious, because it broke the startup procedure of golem and made it not functioning.. And now, when trying it again, it prints\n[11:38:25.149604] ERROR: Exception: [Errno 17] File exists. Fixed in 0.15.0. Houston!

Tuple[bool, str], where first is whether command succeeded and second is an error message. restart_task should take this into account.\nOver all, I think (and I know that currently it's not always the case), that we should pass developer friendly things over rpc, and create user friendly output in golemcli.\nSo in this case, I think it's better to return Tuple[Optional[whatever_type_you_want_to_return], Optional[str]] where the second is an error message in case of failure. This would be especially important if whatever_type_you_want_to_return is str, which is not the case in this PR.. note to me: Windows tests are constantly failing on tearDown. This needs fixing.. The windows tests are failing. #3031 should fix that. @mdtanrikulu The reason for this change is, if you connect to golem's rpc somewhere while it's already working, you don't know the state of all components. With this change you know them all.\nIf you save the results from the previous call, you can compare them and see what has changed.. RPC change: method net.status and event evt.net.connection (Client.connection_status)  is changed from string to a dictionary structure.\nIf golem is not listening (p2p or task port is not open)\npython\n{\n    'listening': False\n}\nelse:\npython\n{\n    'listening': True,\n    'connected': bool(has any connected peers),\n    'port_statuses': {\n        1234: \"open\",\n        2345: \"unreachable\",\n    }\n}\nport_statuses is filled on receiving data from 'ping me' service. So it might be empty shortly after starting golem.\nPossible values (from https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-monitor/blob/f731eb03735f615b9a64ebcf2699874a6b113ae3/models/golemstatsmodel.js#L263):\n- 'unreachable'\n- 'timeout'\n- 'open'.

Instead of creating new command, a new line is added to golemcli tasks stats.. @badb isn't this solved by 4bbb47dde2c2214726797cd82e512076e7b94bee ?. And now we're also publishing an \"Op\" that indicate what happened..

Quick fix (migration for pickled data) is merged. The issue stays open for development of migration to database.. > Why do you need this update here?\n\n\nBecause this is our latest stable release, and it's not possible to deploy it from source.. setuptools is in requirements_to-freeze.txt file. What happened, that it was missing in requirements.txt?. RPC change: ~~new method provider.status, takes no arguments~~ dict returned by method 'comp.tasks.stats' (get_task_stats) is extended with a new key 'provider_state' with possible values:\npython\n{\n    'status': 'golem is starting'\n}\npython\n{\n    'status': 'computing',\n    'subtask': ComputingSubtaskStateSnapshot as dict\n}\npython\n{\n    'status': 'waiting for task',\n    'task_id_waited_for': str(task_id),\n}\npython\n{\n    'status': 'not accepting tasks',\n}\npython\n{\n    'status': 'idle',\n}\n. > Some time ago, I implemented the same logic for get_host_state function here at #2788 instead of creating another RPC, maybe we can consider to move this function into that, so we can ask for the provider stats and status at the same time?\nDone. It might be one of many cases, where our event loop is overloaded with network activity. It sometimes manifests with random errors happening in rpc connections.\nIt doesn't change the fact, that we should somehow handle such errors :). I think I've found possible source of the problem. I've reported it here: https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl/issues/766. I think it would be cleaner to pass a bool to LoopingCallService.__init__ that determines whether _run is called in the main or separate thread.. It's not \"fix help message\" (nothing's broken here), but \"change arguments order\".. > What's the connection of accept tasks = 0 and runningo out of disk space?\nThat's a good question. I pointed this out, to make it clear that the node is not accepting tasks. But the command ./golemcli.py res clear --provider suggests that it keeps resources as a provider. So either there's something really wrong, or at least the command ./golemcli.py res clear has swapped meaning of \"provider\" and \"requestor\".. Seems to be good, but tests are failing. It would be easier if you wrote in advance that this is related to https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-verificator/pull/34. Are you sure you want to merge it to b0.16.1?. Because the issue is about running out of disk space. CLI confusion was something that was also found, but wasn't the main problem.. Sorry, it's about --log-level. ```\nERROR    [golem.node                         ] Stopping because of 'setup client' error:  \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py\", line 387, in _make_request\n    six.raise_from(e, None)\n  File \"\", line 2, in raise_from\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py\", line 383, in _make_request\n    httplib_response = conn.getresponse()\n  File \"/home/etam/code/github/golemfactory/golem/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/raven/breadcr\numbs.py\", line 375, in getresponse                                                                                               \n    rv = real_getresponse(self, args, *kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.6/http/client.py\", line 1331, in getresponse\n    response.begin()\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.6/http/client.py\", line 297, in begin\n    version, status, reason = self._read_status()\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.6/http/client.py\", line 258, in _read_status\n    line = str(self.fp.readline(_MAXLINE + 1), \"iso-8859-1\")\n  File \"/usr/lib64/python3.6/socket.py\", line 586, in readinto\n    return self._sock.recv_into(b)\nsocket.timeout: timed out\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/etam/code/github/golemfactory/golem/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/requests/adap\nters.py\", line 440, in send                                                                                                      \n    timeout=timeout\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py\", line 639, in urlopen\n    _stacktrace=sys.exc_info()[2])\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3/util/retry.py\", line 357, in increment\n    raise six.reraise(type(error), error, _stacktrace)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3/packages/six.py\", line 686, in reraise\n    raise value\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py\", line 601, in urlopen\n    chunked=chunked)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py\", line 389, in _make_request\n    self._raise_timeout(err=e, url=url, timeout_value=read_timeout)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py\", line 309, in _raise_timeout\n    raise ReadTimeoutError(self, url, \"Read timed out.

I have all conditions to have \"Not enough GNT\" for task creation, in terminal I have the exception but I don't have it on RPC error callback.\nFixed. Done. I don't fully understand your comment\n\nProbably while creating test task, there is no task name and it causes error from _validate_task_dict. So test result is always {error: \"Length of task name cannot be less than 4 or more than 24 characters.\" , status: \"Error\"} in GUI. If I pass task name for test reason it's checking task name and everything is okay on this side.\n\nI moved validating of task description from golemcli into core and also added it to check test task description. What you're saying is correct. If you don't set a name for a test task, it will fail at validation. Setting any proper name should solve the problem, and I think it's a better solution than making special cases at validation.\n\nNot sure maybe it's a good idea to check task name length here.\n\nWhere?\n\nApart from that, test result is always from previous test. Is not waiting for the new test results most of the time.\n\nCould you elaborate more on that? Steps to reproduce or something?. This happened to me also. 0.18.1:\n2018-11-08 01:00:20 CRITICAL twisted                             Unhandled Error\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/twisted/python/log.py\", line 103, in callWithLogger\n    return callWithContext({\"system\": lp}, func, *args, **kw)\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/twisted/python/log.py\", line 86, in callWithContext\n    return context.call({ILogContext: newCtx}, func, *args, **kw)\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/twisted/python/context.py\", line 122, in callWithContext\n    return self.currentContext().callWithContext(ctx, func, *args, **kw)\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/twisted/python/context.py\", line 85, in callWithContext\n    return func(*args,**kw)\n--- <exception caught here> ---\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/twisted/internet/posixbase.py\", line 614, in _doReadOrWrite\n    why = selectable.doRead()\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/twisted/internet/tcp.py\", line 205, in doRead\n    return self._dataReceived(data)\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/twisted/internet/tcp.py\", line 211, in _dataReceived\n    rval = self.protocol.dataReceived(data)\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/golem/network/transport/tcpnetwork.py\", line 333, in dataReceived\n    self._interpret(data)\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/golem/network/transport/tcpnetwork.py\", line 359, in _interpret\n    self.session.interpret(m)\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/golem/task/tasksession.py\", line 138, in interpret\n    BasicSafeSession.interpret(self, msg)\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/golem/network/transport/session.py\", line 75, in interpret\n    action(msg)\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/golem/task/tasksession.py\", line 537, in _react_to_want_to_compute_task\n    msg.num_cores, self.address)\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/golem/task/taskmanager.py\", line 407, in get_next_subtask\n    node_name\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/apps/blender/task/blenderrendertask.py\", line 445, in query_extra_data\n    self.total_tasks)\n  File \"/data/golem/golem_git/apps/rendering/task/framerenderingtask.py\", line 381, in _choose_frames\n    return [frames[int((start_task - 1) / parts)]], parts\nbuiltins.TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'int'. @Krigpl minor thing:\npython\nf.write(json.dumps(keystore))\n->\npython\njson.dump(keystore, f). @mdtanrikulu For me it looks like a problem on Electron side. env.hw.preset.activate RPC call expects an argument, but it gets none. And there was nothing changed since it was created.. may be related: #3118 . More states could be added, like timeout and verification_failed.\n@Elfoniok also suggested creating a state verification_finished that would be used before going to finished.. @badb said:\n\nthe state in task manager represents Golem knowledge about child task state. Core task object represents apps knowlege about child task state.\nGolem knowledge should come from app \nApp, ie. task (so Golem Blender task)\nGolem should not care how apps classes are implented (apart from API (ie specific functions right now))\n\nSo, these two state machines should stay separate, but with their own enums. Question is: what states should each have?. Idea:\nHaving two separate state machines is just asking for trouble. As I understand, the point is to have some generic API to know the state of tasks, which are not necessarily rendering tasks, while a task itself might have more complicated and detailed internal state machine.\nSo the proper solution should be that a task keeps it's state internally in whatever way it want, but has a method which translates it to a common/generic state. And if a task state needs to be changed (for example a task is aborted) then there should be a common/generic API method for that.. The only way that could happen, is that connection_status was called through rpc before start_network.\nThis will be fixed by #2702. The plan is to have it merged together with https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-electron/pull/396. I wanted to merge it quickly (https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-electron/pull/396#discussion_r211215697), but @mdtanrikulu insisted on consulting something with @jamuszyn.. There are 2 things to do:\n1. Don't write full traceback in such case. A good idea is to change validate method to raise a custom exception, which will be handled by simply printing the message. But keep the current generic Exception handler, that prints the traceback, in case something unexpected happens.\n2. Find out why outdated headers are propagated and fix that.. Maybe that's related? https://github.com/mfranciszkiewicz/golem-hyperdrive/issues/12. we'll see.... This should be automatically closed by github after merging the #3235 PR. Weird.. You should type ALL_EXCEPT_ALLOWED in a separate line (no matter if it's first, last or wherever). It changes the whole file from being a blacklist to whitelist.. Actually, requirements_to-freeze.txt should contain only things, that are explicitly imported by golem. This is a requirement of requirement, so it's ok, that it's only in requirements.txt.. > hmm... maybe the more interesting question is: why does __remove_old_tasks touch the same task that another node just issued a WantToComputeTask for (which suggests the task is still being computed)...\nBecause it's marking a subtask as timed out. Yeah, it's not something you wold expect in __remove_old_tasks.. So, every LoopingCallService runs in a separate thread. Can we move to Rust quicker? There a data race is a compilation error.. We're fixing a bigger issue here: #3660. The same happens, when restarting successfully finished subtask.. #3280. When creating a task, fundslocker locks funds for a given amount of subtasks. When restarting subtasks, additional funds aren't locked.

Duplicate of #2762?. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3266#issuecomment-418136489. Restarting frame, when task is finished, is working, but not quite. Task state is changed to computing, but there are no funds locked in fundslocker, task is removed from p2pservice and many other things are cleaned up when task is finished. It works, because providers that have the task header and are still asking for more work. To make it work properly we need to create a new task, like in Client.restart_subtasks_from_task.. I'll write tests that are reproducing problems before applying those fixes.. test_taskmanager? I changed a single line there.. I'm not sure if there is that much code repeated that makes it reasonable to pull out a common part. Such function wouldn't have even any meaningful name.\nI was thinking about moving creation of Client object into setUp, but it wouldn't work with some of test cases. Then I found that there's also a TestClientRPCMethods class, which is initializing a Client object in setUp, but it's not clear what's the distinction between it and TestClient class.. done. fixed. please delete branch after merging (there's a button next to \"Pull request successfully merged and closed\"). Currently Golem picks one with the shortest path (number of chars in filename and all directories it's in).\nWith my change it's possible to add main_scene_file to task definition dictionary. It's not an error if it's also in resources.\nExample:\npython\ntask_def = {\n    ...,\n    'resources': [\n        \"/path/to/scene.blend\",\n        \"/path/to/model.blend\",\n    ],\n    'main_scene_file': \"/path/to/scene.blend\",\n}\n. Shouldn't you also remove noqa?. @mplebanski when merging this PR (not now, obviously) please use the option to squash all commits.. Wild idea: implement validation using json-schema https://json-schema.org/. related: #2768. Is this supposed to go to b0.18.0 branch?. This touches private parts of standard library. This smells bad. Isn't it possible to add those things to argument parser in correct order?. @dybi you can trigger rebuilds directly from buildbot web interface. > Is setup.py develop really supposed to install dependencies?\nI think it does.\nhttps://caremad.io/posts/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/49684835/952263. @magdasta 0.18.0. One more optional idea: maybe we should remove old pickles files?. Shame on us all, who reviewed this: #3581 . Does golemcli work with this change?\nAFAIK these imports are important. Imported objects are not directly used, but they are automatically registered as handlers.. blocked by #3630 . Please add tests.. I'd approve that, but there are some very odd whitespace changes. I added comments to some of them, but then I realized there are more, so I just gave up.. Idea: implement locking as a context manager (example: https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.contextmanager) and in golemapp.py wrap creating and starting Node object in with statement.. Is this related? https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/pull/279/. If you add a type annotation to TaskState.subtask_states would mypy catch this?. just don't delete the branch after merge. I'm not sure, but this seems to be a corner case when while a subtask is being verified it's marked as timed-out.. @Elfoniok In this change https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-verificator/commit/e645b00c69229ffedef083c7f18efb00330bd34d (that you pushed without any review), in def task_timeout there is self._clear_state() after a return statement.. > 2. When as provider checking requestor deposit also check if it's locked.\nIt's already done: #3191 \n. @Krigpl You didn't move test_verification_queue.py. And it still uses BlenderVerifier.. fixed by #3659 . @maaktweluit I Love Progress Bars https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24vYoso8Af0. > Why do you think it is safe to run TaskArchiver service in a separate thread? By looking at do_maintenance method it is no so clear to me.\nOk, I had a closer look at it, and it's not thread safe. But very little work is required to make it so, so I'll do it.. > Same question for ResourceCleanerService. It is using the same dir_manager that is used by the golem apps arbitrarily.\nNo, it calls remove_distributed_files and remove_received_files, which are creating their own instances of DirManager and are just removing files from filesystem. There's an issue to make it more safe #2432, but from threading point of view, I see no problem here.. > Did you have a chance to run it and check performance behavior?\nYes and it seems that it's working good.. I'm working on properly profiling golem. It means I need to learn a bit of this stuff. When I'm done I'll share my results and write a guide for others.. probably related: #3098 . I've force-pushed a completely new change, so you can safely ignore what was before.. I confirm. This happens on the node that is trying to connect to the other. This exception also makes the connection attempt to fail, so nodes stay not knowing about each other.. Instead of appveyor and travis we have now buildbot. ci.py should be adjusted, rather than removed.. log line before:\n2019-01-10 05:14:52 WARNING  golem.network.history               TaskToCompute message not found for node None, subtask '9dad3c5e-1491-11e9-a770-839b6556940b'. later happens this:\n2019-01-10 05:10:31 INFO     golem.network.p2p.p2pservice        Can't remove peer [... node id ...], unknown peer. fix merged to b0.19. I rebased this to latest b0.19. Starting from b0.18.3 makes test fails, because there was no rust back then.. Houston! We have a problem!\nBuildbot tries to run rust tests, but there are none in b0.18, so it fails.. If we're not going to release more 0.18 versions, then no.. #3362 by @Krigpl removed counting_task from TaskComputer, but this was in marketplace branch.\n3439 by @mdtanrikulu on 0.18.0 branch added a new use for counting_task.\nbranches were merged and here we are. merged to b0.19. May be related: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-smart-contracts-interface/pull/37. This one seems much more related: #3622. fix merged to b0.19. I don't remember such functionality. And I can't find anything supporting this in the history of our source code.\nAnyway, how we should resolve this? Adding incrementing numbers to output filenames might be tricky and error prone with multithreading. Any ideas?. Or maybe it should be like this: When creating a new task, with the same name and output directory as another task, user should be warned that output files will get overwritten. It sounds like a lot of work with gui and stuff, but I tried to think about what user would expect.. Probably requirements are not well specified. For me such output files suggest that \"task?.png\" files are one thing and \"task?_?.png\" another. But that's probably something for UX team to decide how this should work. I think that's confusing, but if UX agrees that it's how it should be, then I won't object anymore.. Quick idea: If task has multiple frames, then put results in a subfolder that is named after task. If folder already exists, add suffix.\nSo for sequence of tasks with 2, 1, 3 and 1 frames the result would be:\ntask.png\ntask_1.png\ntask/task0.png\ntask/task1.png\ntask_1/task0.png\ntask_1/task1.png\ntask_1/task2.png\n. I asked @jamuszyn for comments.. hello?. anyone here?. Build from https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3843. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/32bba1097cb3de9704b652c0c051894f923267c0/golem/network/transport/tcpnetwork.py#L464-L478\nThe exception happened at line 474, but there is a check at line 466. The only way this could happen is if another thread deletes session member. This can happen if connectionLost is called:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/32bba1097cb3de9704b652c0c051894f923267c0/golem/network/transport/network.py#L110-L111\nSounds like #3660. Another issue is that even if there was no race condition, if self.session is None would also raise AttributeError.. I agree.\nAnd for solving #3660 I think we should start with merging #3661 and then carefully start to look for possible bottlenecks and things that could be moved to separate threads. Because right now we just have unsynchronized threads mayhem.. 2019-03-05 13:18:57 CRITICAL twisted                             Unhandled Error

follow up: #3976. I'd change one thing. Having two mutually exclusive bool flags, creates a problem, when both are set True. Better solution is one flag x-run-verification, with values enabled (default if not specified), lenient and disabled.. The current name suggests that it's a limit, that a user puts on himself. And in this case this limit is not enforced.\nIf it's supposed to be just a default value, then sure, it's just a naming issue. Maybe default_requested_price would be better, to make it clear it's not used by provider. In this case it would also make sense to make bid value in task dict optional and fill it with value from config if it's missing.\n// there are 2 hard things in IT: naming things, cache invalidation and off-by-one errors.. Those message queues: #2223 ? It seems to me that it adds persistence, which allows to resume a session if a node crashes/restarts. Still you need to have handling of those messages implemented somewhere and I still think it's a good idea to do it using a state machine with separated requestor from provider.. \n. On hold until message queues are implemented.. Comment by @shadeofblue: for integration test, instead of failing verificator, we could have a provider that always returns bogus files (for example provided 1 black pixel).. this no longer points to pyflakes. Shouldn't that notify service restart, like in buildbot-master role?. It looks OK, but why this step is not needed on buildbot_master hosts?. E: golem/network/transport/message.py:102:35: Instance of 'Message' has no 'TYPE' member (no-member). Is this bytes or strings?\n```python\n\n\n\nb''.join([b'123', \"abc\"])\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: sequence item 1: expected a bytes-like object, str found\n```\n\n\n\nIf it's all bytes, then this should be fine:\npython\nself.buffered_data += data. Comments in this class suggests, that it operates on strings, but instead it operates on bytes.. Is this supposed to go in here?. Magic constant. Magic constant. $ python3 -m timeit 'b1 = b\"0\"*100; b2 = b\"f\"*100; b1 = b\"\".join([b1, b2])'\n10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.19 usec per loop\n$ python3 -m timeit 'b1 = b\"0\"*100; b2 = b\"f\"*100; b1 += b2'\n10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.126 usec per loop\nIt looks like += is faster.. From pylint, run by shippable.. At 10000 bytes they become equal. Do we know why this happens at all? Is it legal for this object to have None as prv_port?. This test seems too big. I think it should be split, but not necessarily in this PR. . Without TYPE it will fail anyway, so it's absolutely fine.. In such case, is it legal to even try to send some pending payments to node that we shouldn't connect to?. This git id is meaningless. I don't know if or when it should be updated and why. It would be better if it was a tag or branch.. Handlers are run at the end of play. And this looks like something that should be run before next commands (or am I wrong? IDK)\nIf that's the case, then add register: pywin32_installed and change the handler as a next task with when: pywin32_installed|changed.. https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html\nTL;DR: Typo. data is not str. It's bytes. self.buffered_data += data. It should be updated in whole class, not just here.. :param bytes data: .... In whole class, not just here, ofc.. 1. it's not related to building taskcollector\n2. maybe something like [[ \"$PWD\" != \"$HOME\" ]] && mv hyperg $HOME/?. But this might also swallow other error messages. I think we should leave as it was before, or do it properly.\n(And I think attaching small changes to other unrelated PRs is not a good idea). Why not aliases, like it was before?\nThis way it's easier to make mistake. You'll spend hours debugging if there's mismatch in strings. You'll get instant error if object does not exist.. Yep. You removed 'golem.version' from the other file.. The thing is that get_difficulty takes much more time to compute, than current is_difficult_enough. And it's crucial when generating new keys.. What do you think about this?\npython\nreturn itertools.islice(\n    (peer for peer in bucket.peers_by_id_distance(key_num) if int(peer.key, 16) != key_num\n          for bucket in self.buckets_by_id_distance(key_num))\n    , alpha). if not self.peer_keeper.add_peer(peer):. if peer_to_remove:. docs.python.org/3. Actually, this might be not needed.\nIf everywhere there was\n```python\nimport golem.core.variables as vars\n[...]\nvars.P2P_PROTOCOL_ID\n```\nthen it would work fine.\nBut\npython\nfrom golem.core.variables import PROTOCOL_ID\ncreates a local copy of the variable, which is surprising.\nWell, it wouldn't be surprising if anyone would care about what pylint and flake8 have to say about our code.. if not datadir:. Put all imports at the top of the file.. > More compact\nTrue\n\nmuch less legible\n\nDisputable\nFor me checking twice len(neigh) == alpha makes it not much legible either.\n\nless efficient\n\nQuestionable\nWhat about this?\npython\ndef neigh():\n    for bucket in self.buckets_by_id_distance(key_num):\n        for peer in bucket.peers_by_id_distance(key_num):\n            if int(peer.key, 16) != key_num:\n                yield peer\nreturn list(itertools.islice(neigh(), alpha)). Shouldn't this be managed by DirManager? It already does something similar for other directories..\nW: tests/test_golemapp.py:17:4: Useless super delegation in method 'setUp' (useless-super-delegation)\nW: tests/test_golemapp.py:20:4: Useless super delegation in method 'tearDown' (useless-super-delegation)\n```\nAre those methods needed?. Dunno. It's just moved this code from other place.. Probably for ignoring any additional arguments. I just copied how other tests are done. I'll check if it's needed.. Removed .format(). Removed *_. I think that building taskcollector should be tested (it requires libfreeimage-dev). Is ipfs still needed? AFAIK we're not using it anymore, so this could be deleted. Do we have any tests for taskcollector? If not at least we could test if it builds.. Well, on shippable we only run linters, not full tests, so this can be dropped from here.. fixed. fixed. > this is not covered by unit tests\nwill fix that\n\nDo we use it anywhere?\n\nWe use it here: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/2c82f8e7a1af783ef59ee8cda472c1fe768b6259/golem/network/p2p/peersession.py#L390\n\nWhat happens if someone send a key in a bad format?\n\nShit happens ;) But seriously, if such event happens, it should be detected at lower layer of networking stack. And if it reaches here, then decode_hex will throw an exception.. update documentation about returned values. hyperg was updated. fixed (added test). done. Well, but it might be useful. And it makes the interface complete.. I asked a question https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem_rd/issues/132#issuecomment-345200716 \nno reply so far. But anyway, I've made it use _load_and_check_keys. done. done. If tasks never starts at all, there will be no time_finished nor time_elapsed.\nMaybe just time_started + timeout + older_than_seconds?. It's used in setup.py.. It's used indirectly. It allows to run python setup.py test, but it seems broken.. I tried\npython\n    @patch('os.symlink')\n    def test_conflict_file(self, os_symlink):\n        os_symlink = Mock(side_effect=OSError)\nBut flake8 says F841 local variable 'os_symlink' is assigned to but never used and it seems it doesn't change anything. And I don't want to patch whole os module.. I've found a way to patch os.symlink just for tested function.. I'm sure https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/4.3.x/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save. It checks if any bytes were written without throwing exceptions.\nI think that anything more elaborate (like checking if it's actually a PNG 1x1 image) is out of scope of this test. It should be checked by PIL itself.. done. The type annotation of _services is List[Service] (with from golem.core.service import Service).\nWith this new type of service, I think it should be changed that they all implement a common metaclass.. Maybe not directly a metaclass, but an Abstract Base Class.. Nice. How about this?\npython\ndef _get_next_random_seed(self):\n    if not self.unused_seeds:\n         self.unused_seeds = random.sample(self.seeds, k=len(self.seeds))\n    return self.unused_seeds.pop(). But here you're creating a new generator every time seeds_round_robin is called. This generator must be stored in self for reuse.. ```python\ndef random_round_robin(items):\n    while True:\n        sample = random.sample(items, k=len(items))\n        for item in sample:\n            yield item\nclass P2PService:\n    def init(self):\n        # ...\n        self.seeds_round_robin = random_round_robin(self.seeds)\ndef connect_to_seed(self):\n    # ...\n    for ip_address, port in self.seeds_round_robin:\n\n``. But when set is slightly changed (like one seed added), then you're resetting whole thing. The current solution remembers used seeds.. In what unit is thismax_price?. Which type is underdictionary['bid']`? Which unit?\n(ah, the joys of dynamic typing). There's no need to repeat type here.. In what unit is computation_time?\nThe documentation of ReportComputedTask in golem_messages says it's type is float.. If you're already touching it, then why not?. In TaskHeader fields subtask_timeout and deadline should also be ints.. The comment about ReportComputedTask is also a request for changes, but in another repo.. And while at it, you could add comments that those ints are seconds.. Is it OK if one is already running?. Like in requirements-test.txt. Start with #.. That doesn't explain anything.\nThat would be better:\nNewer version contains no code. Only deprecation warning.. A comment about why it's not a NetworkMessage object here yet would be helpful.. this can be a @staticmethod. you may want to use freezegun package to avoid any timing issues.. I think tail -n 1 is more legible than sed -n 2p. python\nfor peer in self.peers.values(). python\ndistances = sorted(\n    peer for peer in self.peers.values()\n    if peer.key_id != node_info.key,\n    key=lambda peer: key_distance(key_id, peer.key_id)\n). If queue is full, this will drop entries from front. Is it OK?. What's `super_mock`? It's unused.. I think it would be much cleaner, to have a first step that checks if required fields are not None and after that use `msg.whatever` like before.. This comment implies some connection between compare_version and connection. It made me confused for a bit.\nI think it's enough that the code is in correct order and this comment should be removed.. My intuition says that dropping the oldest messages from the queue is unfair and may lead to some priority inversion.. My intention is to handle both hex string and int input.\n`TaskManager.get_task_definition_dict` returns `difficulty` as int.. This should be split into small test cases.. [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself): call the methods below.. This could be collapsed into one line. Or at least two (`ths_tk` variable is OK, `ret` not so much).. `get_other_tasks_headers`. `get_my_tasks_headers`. `ts.get_other_tasks_headers()` is better than `ts.get_tasks_headers()[1]`. But why?. Shame. The current form is very hard to read and confusing. `get_my_tasks_headers` and `get_other_tasks_headers` was nice and clear.. We shouldn't have illegible code in tests either.\nI think `get_tasks_headers` should be deleted and replaced by two methods.. typo: \"Unexected\" -> \"Unexpected\". `int(a/b)` -> `a//b`. Splitting this function is a small change. Public api or not, more readable code is always better.. For private fields there is single underscore. Double underscore is to avoid naming clashes with inheritance.. changes in this file in this commit could be squashed with previous commit. It would be better, if this change was in a separate commit.. squash this with 98ce12e0bff949096c72ae2eeb45e3429f99c660. Just pass database as an argument to Trust. You won't need to make such weird if statements and you'll avoid setting database as class property..python\nd = self.new_path / str(uuid.uuid4())\nd.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\nreturn d\n```. http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_variables.html#hey-wait-a-yaml-gotcha. http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/become.html\n\nbecome_user - [...] Does NOT imply become: yes. I don't think we should care about race conditions in this case (unless you like to race with editing config files against a starting application). Also I wrote it this way, because in C++ an expected condition shouldn't be handled with exceptions. But that's python, so I think it's OK to change it as you propose.. Yes. https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/unittest.html\nBenefits out of the box\nBy running your test suite with pytest you can make use of several features, in most cases without having to modify existing code:\n- [...]\n- Use plain assert-statements instead of self.assert* functions. class GNTWToken:. class GNTWToken:. Con C ent ?. Isn't it possible to reuse those from golem-messages?. use golem.testutils.TempDirFixture?. This time freezing would be better if you'd use a single timestamp as a starting point both here and in setUp. . You could make it as a part of golem-messages library (something like golem.testutils) and import it in both places.. 'tempfile' imported but unused. http://docs.shippable.com/ci/pull-request-builds/\nThis is done by pulling the latest code from your your branch, i.e. the branch where the pull request will be merged, merging with the changes in the pull request, and running your build against the merged code.. I think it would be better to put this check before checking genesis block.. This is some weird state machine. P2PService is given access to TaskServer by Client in start_network method. So we don't want to send GetTasks messages, before we can receive them.. As I see, P2PService makes an assumption that it won't receive any tasks messages, before it's ready to handle them. Fixing this would require bigger cleanup.. logging and os are from standard library, so should be together. What's the return type of this?. Is it useful to have it as a public method?. What's the problem with that?. unused import?. Why is there dropping and adding index? Rollback seems to do the same.. Is it possible to have is_converting and is_updating_personal_deposit_address that do not change the state of object? I understand how this works, but it's quite confusing to see that is_converting does some work and update_personal_deposit_address being used in an if statement.. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/pull/25 was merged. I think it should be an info, not warning. It's not that important.. I think it's better to keep such test cases as a separate functions. When in one function, one test case might be affected by a state created by previous one. It's also harder for a reader to deduce the initial state of a test case. It's overall against the idea of a unit test.. This \"Keeps only private\" is confusing and, I think, unneeded.. Maybe add a default value 0 for difficulty and use keyword argument when calling with a raw value like self._create_keysauth(difficulty=2). This will improve readability a bit.. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/#class-and-instance-variable-annotations. This was moved to golem_messages module. . minor thing: test_key_recreate_and_backup_on_increased_difficulty. or even better: test_key_backup_and_recreate_on_increased_difficulty. Names with double underscore at the beginning and end are reserved for Python.\n\nThis would be cleaner if call function was called once from outside and some other private method was passed to reactor. The problem of *args, **kwargs can be then solved by passing them as a tuple (args, kwargs) to this private method and unpacking them when required *args[0], **args[1].. minor: use variables from CallRateLimiter instead of hard-coding magic numbers.. minor: like above. print?. or rename it to key_password - no doc needed. We're introducing the key difficulty thing, so most keys will be regenerated anyway.. I think, that as long as we're on testnet, we don't need to care so much. On mainnet such feature would be mandatory.. #2213. I think this PR should be closed without merging. This issue should be properly and completely handled in #2213 and any partial solutions are bad in their own ways and not worth spending time.. The comment at MAX_TIME_DIFF says it's about difference between golem and monitor. It should be adjusted to be more generic.. Was this change under review?. It's redundant to provide types in comment if they are already as type annotations.. You can specify this at decorator, like this:\npython\n@patch('golem.core.keysauth.KeysAuth.is_pubkey_difficult', return_value=False). import at top. Change the _awaiting from list to http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/sortedlistwithkey.html. Here you add middleware to web3 and later you create web3. Is that a correct order?. I don't think so. It's just to make the exception contain any backtrace.. maybe wrap it inside another LoopingCallService?. why the version number?. minor: os is part of standard library. should be in the first group.. It's unclear in what units is this timeout. I know it's a bit verbose, but I really think it should be like timeout_seconds.. Is this necessary? This function returns an object that fits in the Acl metaclass.. Why?\nHow can I know the task_id, if I'm creating it over RPC?. I can haz return type annotation?. I can haz return type annotation?. I can haz return type annotation?. I can haz return type annotation?. In what units is this amount? I think that it's not '1.45', but rather 1.45*10^18. Please check and update the help message.. Ah, you make int(Decimal(amount) * denoms.ether). inconsistent formatting. What happened with Crypto? Build failed, because it's missing.. Which base class would that call?. pytest encourages using raw assert https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/assert.html. Done (I hope correctly, please check carefully, because I'm not very familiar with Deferred). Done, but in different file.. OK, I educated myself a bit on that matter, and I agree that's the proper way, and luckily base classes follows the rules to make this work properly.. This is too bold. Change it to return True on success and add printing an error message in golemcli on error.. Suggestion: in sorted(node_set). Otherwise it'll mix the contents every time.. return False, str(e) in last line.\nBut also instead of isinstance, it would be more straightforward to use if self.task_server is not None: (it's None until start_network is called for the first time).. The type of task_server is Optional[TaskServer]. No big refactoring needed, no type checking needed.. > Is it? I don't see any type declaration here\nYou can add it.\nLots of our code was originally wrote for python 2. Don't expect to see type annotations everywhere. If there are none, then it doesn't mean \"it can be type T, but it can be also completely different type U\". In most cases it means \"it's type T, or Optional[T]\".. Wouldn't that reset everything that was prepared in setUpClass? If this is required, then it seems reasonable to create a proper setUp method.. return type annotation?. type annotations?. type annotations?. type annotations?. type annotations?. You can use self.new_path, which is a pathlib.Path. Then everything is easy:\npython\n(self.new_path / \"something.good\").write_text('meh'). self.new_path like above. return type annotation plz. In type annotations don't use list. Use typing.List[inner_type].. In type annotations don't use list. Use typing.List[inner_type].. No code is not worth a type annotation.. I don't know what exactly do we need. I just put there everything that seems reasonable. Keep in mind, that our GUI might not be the only RPC client interested in this data.. As the comment says, it was supposed to prevent 'unused' warnings. But since we also have proper comments for linters and stuff, probably this could be removed. If it is, I think it should go in a separate PR.. What's the minimal set of data, then? @badb @mdtanrikulu ?. I don't understand your question.. How about None if there are no tasks that this node may want to compute (just removing 'either' from the beginning)?. fixed. fixed. As long as there are no other golemcli provider ... commands, I see no reason to do this.. Yes, but they make sections of the code more visually separated.. done. Minor: according to inlineCallbacks documentation, since python 3.3 you can use regular return instead of returnValue.. Is this , *_ needed?. what is the type we originally get here? string? int?. value is not a float anymore.. Then maybe there's no need to convert it to int and back to string?. > Calculating gnt_reserved requires ints\nThat's fair\n\nAlso _fmt expects ints for division\n\nThat could be done by inserting a dot a a specific place in string. (I'm not saying it must, but could)\n. This class is periodically sending connection status as an event on rpc (on crossbar you can call a method over rpc, but you can also publish events).\nSo, yes, I know that my change affects both 'net.status' rpc method and 'evt.net.connection' event.. To check only for important parts and not make it strictly bound to output formatting and other stuff that might appear. If someone later adds some more info to the output it won't affect the test.. added. The term apply suggests that it modifies the mask. Something like matches would be better.. Task derives from abc.ABC and the methods below are marked as @abstractmethod. You can't create objects of it. In tests this was worked around by u sing @mock.patch.multiple(Task, __abstractmethods__=frozenset()). It was ugly and was making me problems when refactoring tests around WrongTask, which derives from Task.. No. The main fix is in adding else part after try and except in DockerTaskThread.run.. Not a single type annotation in this file :(. Second point of https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports. Second point of https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports. That's ugly. It would be better if _run would return bool and _process_queue would loop based on that.. Type annotations? They were here before.. If we only want the size of file contents, there's no need to waste memory for that. Use os.stat('path').st_size. Oh, result_data is used below outside of this loop. So it uses the value of the last result. Is that correct?. Maybe instead of adding int around max change\nint(virtual_memory().total * 0.75) / 1024\nto\nint(virtual_memory().total * 0.75 / 1024)\n?. List of what?. While at it, you could add that it's in kilobytes.. then. -> Dict[str, int]?. -> Tuple[str, Dict[str, int]]?. whaa? I don't understand what are you talking about.\nLets split this one-liner a bit:\nBefore your changes:\npython\nproposed_memory_in_kb = int(virtual_memory().total * 0.75) / 1024\nresult = max(proposed_memory_in_kb, MIN_MEMORY_SIZE)\nreturn result\nMIN_MEMORY_SIZE is int.\nThe problem here is that proposed_memory_in_kb is a float, not int. So result also might be float.\nWhat you're proposing is changing return result to return int(result).\nI propose changing calculation of proposed_memory_in_kb so it's int instead of float.. Dict[int, Union[List[str], float, CropContext]]? Or maybe just Dict[int, Any]?. minor: it would make more sense to return as a tuple. That's the weirdest way to pass arguments I've ever seen. Why not just drop those dicts and use path=crop_path, position=crops_info, ...?. done. How that works? What is the difference?. https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#why-do-lambdas-defined-in-a-loop-with-different-values-all-return-the-same-result. The return type annotation is in comment, because mypy hates inlineCallbacks decorator.. Maybe...? I'm violating Python anyway, because __cause__ is supposed to be set by calling raise CreatingTaskFailed(task_id) from exception. So I don't think it's legitimate to assign this in constructor.. :+1: . Is there a reason for registering _react_to_hello here? It's defined in derived classes (that's why no-member is required). Derived classes also register their _react_to_hello in __set_msg_interpretations methods. I think this line should be dropped.. Of course it is. Should I use RuntimeError or a custom exception class?. note: with Path object you can use task_path.read_text() instead of\npython\nwith open(task_path) as f:\n    f.read(). This is wrong. Here you try to get something from task_owner and below you check if it's a dict. You should first make sure it's a dict and then get anything from it. It will also make mypy less angry.. Get a timestamp once, assign it to a variable and use it in both places.. Me being used to C++.\nBut on the other hand, you can move the line node_name = task_owner['node_name'] under if not isinstance(task_owner, dict): and you won't need to catch TypeError nor silence the type checker. Then you could replace the whole try...catch thing with node_name = task_owner.get('task_owner', task_owner). Wait, what?. I don't understand this part:\npython\n        except (TypeError, KeyError):\n            node_name = task_owner\nWhat sense does it make, if we expect task_owner to be a dict?. done. I'd change that to:\npython\ntry:\n    node_name = task_owner.get('node_name')\nexcept TypeError:\n    ...\nThis way, if there's no node_name in task_owner it'll be handled by if not isinstance(node_name, str): below. (because in such case, error message 'Task owner missing' is misleading). https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#runtime-or-type-checking. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#runtime-or-type-checking. # type: ignore Why?. Maybe _private_key shouldn't be a private variable? After all, it's used everywhere, but not in KeysAuth.. If you add if not self.rpc_session:, like in other methods around, then Optional goes away and ignoring type should not be needed.. ```python\nfrom typing import Any, cast, Callable, Optional, TypeVar\nfrom functools import wraps\nF = TypeVar('F', bound=Callable[..., Any])\ndef _require_rpc_session(f: F) -> F:\n    @wraps(f)\n    def wrapper(self: 'Node', *args, kwargs):\n        if self.rpc_session is None:\n            self._error(\"RPC session is not available\")  # noqa pylint: disable=protected-access\n            return None\n        return f(self, *args, kwargs)\n    return cast(F, wrapper)\nclass Node:\n    ...\n    @_require_rpc_session  # no '()' at the end here\n    def foo():\n```\nNot ideal, but I think a bit better.\nhttps://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generics.html#declaring-decorators. What's wrong with that?. Maybe just use mapping={} default value in arguments?. Can I haz sum type annotations? (for variables below too, especially _mapping). python\nclass ClientProxy:. super()?. python\nclass Publisher:. Is this nonlocal necessary? uri is not used outside of wrapper scope.. https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.wraps. type annotation?. There's a short time between when RPC session is ready and procedures are registered. If in that time a client connects and calls something, it will get errors.\nMaybe we should have a method (registered very early, returning bool) and send notification after methods are registered, so that a client could know when golem is ready?. that would also require some changes from electron side. I thought it might be easier to copy just a filename, if you know it's unique and have it already in your directory browser.. Ok, I removed partial matching.. Is this used anywhere? Looks quite dangerous.... I like that even more than a migration, that I wrote in TaskManager. :+1: . this change is not needed anymore. I removed the check, because it's not possible for self.task_server to be None. It was in the past, but it's not anymore. But those checks were left, so I removed them.. done. self.key_id is set in _react_to_hello.\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/158d31afecd59ff850d507a819aa11ea4edd4e2c/golem/task/tasksession.py#L879. My idea was, in higher level of abstraction, that if someone connects and don't send hello message, then golem doesn't know who he is.. Actually, a \"less informed user\" wouldn't be much more informed by a message \"key_id uninitialized\".. I had to somehow silence mypy complaining about self.key_id being Optional[str].\nShould I put assert self.key_id is not None then?. done. So assert it is.. Anyway, the message is gone now.. done. changed to debug. done. Yes, it is. I spent a minute with jiivan trying to find a way that's readable and acceptable by pylint.. To make sure the message is properly signed? Or is it checked anywhere else?. In my opinion, exceptions should be raised in unexpected situations. This is totally expected. An enum would be better.. In this function I just moved things around to improve readability, but the logic stays unchanged.. This line was an important missing piece.. why import here?. name is not used outside wrapper scope. I suggest decoupling _validate_task_dict from client. In this case it would be enough to pass a concent_enabled: bool argument.. don't you need # noqa pylint:disable=unused-import here?. suggestion\n        task_mock.get_total_tasks.return_value=3. Looks like change of end-of-line encoding.\n@mplebanski I know we have some files with \\r\\n and some with \\n, but we have to stick with what we have.. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports\nhttps://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips#Import_Statement_Overhead\nI think your argument is invalid.. maybe _call shouldn't be private anymore?. Doesn't that causes mock_task object to be reused in all tests? Is it possible that one test changes the object and another test sees those changes? (I'm not sure that's the case, but I have a feeling, that it might be. Just asking). :+1: . :+1: . This quote is not relevant. And I checked that this is the case.. suggestion\n            elif any(k.startswith(prefix) for prefix\n                     in Settings.BOOL_CONVERTIBLE_KEY_PREFIXES):. what's the type of deadline?. there is a shortcut above:\npython\n    @property\n    def task_manager(self):\n        return self.task_server.task_manager. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/f2c00b6312e5851cfcd7c18cfb2e9f77000b3939/golem/task/taskbase.py#L192. Codecov says this is not tested. Is it correct?. send_pings is missing?. Is this check still relevant?. :open_mouth:. Why?. I think this notation makes it very confusing.\n(In C this would mean that op_class_name is a label, that you can jump to, and you're assigning value to str variable). If you want a newline so much, this way would be more legible:\npython\nop_class_name: str = \\\n    op.__class__.__name__ if op is not None else None. ?. TaskStatus has is_completed method. Maybe you could add a new, similar one, and use it instead? . Or line 80 can be changed to result = sync_wait(deferred) or []\n. Type annotations for arguments plz.. you have proper name in golem.config.active.DATA_DIR. I'm a bit confused. Why do you need to pass 'rinkeby' or 'mainnet' to get_local_datadir as additional env_suffix argument? What's wrong with from golem.config.active import DATA_DIR that was in there?. suggestion\n        super().__init__(. why move?. https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/18.9.0/api/twisted.internet.defer.html#succeed. Is the return type still Optional[Deferred]? It seems it's now just Deferred.. small steps at a time :). Why is this cast required? From glancing quickly at the code it seems to me that it should always be int. If it's not, then I think it's a bug and should be corrected elsewhere.. Everywhere else timeouts were ints. They come from task definition in format \"hh:mm:ss\" and are converted to ints.\nI think you should add here conversion to int and revert all conversions to floats you did in this PR.. timeout and subtask_timeout are given by requesting user and are a relative number of seconds. Therefore ints.\ntimestamp and deadline are absolute timestamp values. On the one hand I think that we don't need sub-second granularity and int would be sufficient, but on the other hand time.time() and our get_timestamp_utc are returning floats and changing that would require lots of changes all over the place, so I'm willing to accept status quo.. you can change builtin_types to be a tuple\npython\nbuiltin_types = tuple(i for i in types.__dict__.values() if isinstance(i, type))\nand then instead of\npython\ntype(obj) in cls.builtin_types\nyou can use\npython\nisinstance(obj, cls.builtin_types). types.InstanceType seems to not exist in python3\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/9548936/how-to-determine-the-type-of-class-instance. datastructures.Container?. Why?. You don't need to expose this through Client anymore. Just put rpc_utils.expose directly on is_virtualization_enabled.. Does this work if system is configured to use other language?. How about\npython\ndef test_vt_enabled(self, *_):\n    with patch('golem.core.virtualization.get_cpu_info',\n            return_value=get_mock_cpuinfo_output()):\n        self.assertTrue(is_virtualization_enabled())\n?\nI know, it's bikeshedding. Anyway, I think it's a bit more tidy. Change it if you want, but I don't mind if you don't.. Python standard library is calling popen directly and does not use any encoding/decoding: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Lib/platform.py#L455\nMaybe that's the correct way? . Well, in other place it does: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Lib/platform.py#L798 and it uses latin-1. Soooo.... What is the conclusion? What is the right thing to do? I feel incompetent to approve or reject this part.. why not just bool?. \nPh'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn. We are using pytest to run tests, which handles assert a == b as nicely as self.assertEquals(). For me plain assert is more readable. Do you have any good reason to use self.assertEquals()?. done. Because you made a confusing comment in another pull request (which now I know was wrong) and the design document is written in such way that it makes very hard to find related formula (I found it now).. It is now.. of course no. The complication was not because of python-rust communication of float('inf') value, but because of calculations done in order_providers_impl (for which I expanded tests in marketplace.py file).\nThe problem is when alpha = 0, because inf * 0 = nan. And using inf would totally break cases when 0 < alpha < 1, because the score would be always inf.\nBy using float max it's at least giving a good impression of behaving correctly. I tried to talk with @mbenke about it, but he's not responding right now.. done. ",

    "banasiakadam60": "This bug is still valid. On github I found discussion about this issue (https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/6644). There was a proposal to add flag, which allow to ignore such files, but it wasn't accepted. So all we can do is to inform user about files with unallowed permissions and ask him to move/remove them, or we can force user to run this script with sudo and then move such files to some temp dir, like ~/.golem_tmp and when script will finish its work, restore files and remove tmp.\nI propose to print some message about such files and then move them to tmp.\n@badb what do you think?\n. Done :) Closing this issue.\n. Yes, it can be closed\n. @chfast Ok, commit now available here: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/pull/345\nThis one can be abandoned,\n. BTW. Maybe I will also disable 'ok' buttons on tests in 'Provider' tab?\n. Can it be closed?\n. Should it be closed?\n. Should it be closed?\n. Additionally on Ubuntu 16.04 I can move \"Account\" icon. There is no such problem with other icons\n\n\n. At this moment FreeImage has a bug and the fix is needed to build it. This bug will be removed in next version of FreeImage, but we don't know when it will be released. I've prepared a small patch, to fix this, but we need to publish it somewhere. Do we have any public server, where I can put this patch?\n. I suppose this issue can be closed.\n. I suppose it can be closed?\n. @badb OK, working on it. But it will force user to restart the application. Is it correct?\n. OK, thanks for the explanation :) \n. Can I merge this branch? After doing this, I'll send the tests.\n. I'm not able to debug this bug. Each time I got Segfault. I'll revert commit with tests.\n. Can it be closed?\n. OK, removed.\n. You meant something like that?\n. OK, but what should be the default value? At this moment it set to 0 and defined as max(definition.leading_zeros, max(frame_numbers)) in case of default (0) or incorrect (too low) value.\n. I've checked it yesterday and it looks fine. But ofc I'll check it one more time :)\nMaybe I'll add some additional checkbox to determine whether the user wants to define padding, or wants it to be generated automaticly (basing on the frames numbers)?\n.

I've joined this two issues becouse both need a change in AppMainWindow.ui, so I could pushed it as one PR, or two related PRs. IMO one PR is better option.\n. OK. Oh, thanks, I have somehow missed this issue :)\n. I found it here: https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem/wiki/Common-problems\n. @badb OK, I'll change it\n. OK, ofc I can change it and keep paths in some external class (I suppose it will be best solution), but I'm not sure... I thought that if user change task type, let's say from Blender to Lux, we shouldn't show him dir with blender tasks. But, as I said, if you want, I can change it.\nbtw. What do you mean by 'reload task'? Loading saved task?\n. Yyy... I've just checked this and it's work fine? At least on my KUbunu. I even had to use QSettings in tests, because it was using last used directory when testing. Did you check it on Ubuntu, or Windows?\n. OK, I'll check it on Windows. I've tested this on KUbuntu and works fine, on pyqt wiki it was written it works similar on every supported platform, but it looks like it doesn't.\n. Haha, thanks :) As I said last time, for me we shouldn't use this progress bar as an estimator (IMO it can be misleading) and this pr can be closed.

Everything is fine.. This is one of the bugs found by bandit. I've reported all of them to let us investigate and to not miss any issue. If you're sure it's not a bug just close this issue.. #690. LGTM. Done ;). - [x] Versioning\n- [x] Tests . @chfast Can you review?. #735 . So first of all: now we can build a wheel package (this will be improved in PR with versioning). you just need to launch python setup.py bdist_wheel. It works on Linux (tested on KUbuntu 16.04) and Windows (tested on win 10).\nNext, there are two scripts:\n\n\ninstall.sh - this is script which allows to install Golem with all dependencies on Linux (tested on Ubuntu, should works also on Debian and Mint). At the begining it checks if golem is installed. Next check if pip/Docker/geth/IPFS is installed. If not it asks user if want to install it manually or if the script should do this for him. After that it install dependencies (if neccessary), download golem wheel from server, install via pip and remove wheel.\n\n\ninstall_script.iss - it's Inno Setup install script (and my nightmare). So... You need to have wheel package for windows in {Repo}/dist directory and all required exe files in {Repo}\\Installer\\Installer_win\\deps\\ dir (this mean: DockerToolbox.exe, geth-windows-amd64-1.5.9-a07539fb.exe, python-2.7.13.msi, pywin32-220.win32-py2.7.exe, VCForPython27.msi. They are too big to keep them in repo). Then there is a lot of black magic, but if you compile it with Inno Setup, you will get golem installer for windows in {Repo}\\Installer\\Installer_win dir. \n\n\nFrom more interesting things:\n\n\nsetup.py was rewritten. Now it contains only necessary things. All auxiliary functions were moved to setup_common.py. BTW. TaskCollector is automatically build for linux and OSx (I think). I have no idea how to call vc.exe from cmd on Windows, so I left this for now. \n\n\nI've removed scripts\\packaging, because it was used by cx_freez, so now, we don't need it.\n\n\nTo sum up:\n\n\nOn Linux: you need to build wheel, and copy it on the server. install.sh will automatically download it and install with dependencies\n\n\nOn Windows: build wheel, compile install_script.iss with Inno Setup and you have installer (I'm going to add building wheel to the .iss script). @mfranciszkiewicz Should be fixed. @mfranciszkiewicz \nOK, https://get.docker.com does\n$sh_c \"mkdir -p /etc/apt/sources.list.d\"\n$sh_c \"echo deb \\[arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)\\] ${apt_url}/repo ${lsb_dist}-${dist_version} ${repo} > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list\"\n$sh_c 'sleep 3; apt-get update; apt-get install -y -q docker-engine'\nSo I'll add docker-engine to this line https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/update_installer/Installer/Installer_Linux/install.sh#L149. #1124 . @paulperegud It would be great if you could test it tomorrow. Eg. launch script, downgrade docker and geth (ethereum and docker-engine packages) and rerun this script.. Tested, it works for me\n. @badb What's with this PR? Should it be merged? It was accepted some time ago, and still is hanging?. @mfranciszkiewicz I agree ;) It's just a first version for tests. @mfranciszkiewicz Ruggu is (or should be) 0.6.0 seed, so, as for me, it can be removed and replaced with Rebbu. @badb ?. LGTM, but didn't tested. @mfranciszkiewicz Can we merge it?. +verified. #1285 . To reproduce:\n1) cat ~/.local/share/golem/default/app_cfg.ini | grep 'end port'\n2) end port should be set to 60102\n3) Launch golemapp (old GUI)\n4) Go to Preferences->Provider\n5) Change anything (eg. RAM or CPU) and save with Change on the bottom of the window\n6) cat ~/.local/share/golem/default/app_cfg.ini | grep 'end port'\n7) end port would be set to 0. Right now, with #1323 end port in point 7 should still be set to 60102\n. @snario Please sign CLA. Without this, we cannot merge this PR.\nAnd thanks for this fix! :+1: . Fixed in #1397 . I've checked this few times, but it would be great if someone find a moment to check it ones again. Golem should be removed anyway from Path, location doesn't change anything. I've checked that. Also, at the beginning we check if Golem is already in Path, if there is anything containing the word Golem in the Path nothing will be added. And if you already have Golem installed, InnoSetup will not ask you about location and will automatically use the previous one, so there is no way, that Path will be outdated. #1246 . #1247 . It looks like pyinstaller doesn't link to any libraries in %PYTHONPATH/lib/site-packages (eg PyQt5). Probably we need to manually point to this dependencies.\nSee https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/How-to-Report-Bugs. It looks like we're at the same point on MacOS and Windows now. PyQt is included (in a really nasty way, which have to be changed in the feature, but it works for now)\nIt would be really, really, really great if someone could try to build it on Windows and check what happens. OK, as for now, it looks like I've fixed Windows problems in #1244 and #1272. I've checked that and also @Radagast-red did. We needed to change some dependencies (eg. change vc_redist) and add some switches to the PyInstaleller.\nOn MacOS it looks that @mfranciszkiewicz fixed issues. Everything is merged, so IMO we can close this issue.. @ggruszczynski What's the status? It was approved 12 days ago, can it be merged? Or you need to change sth in this PR?. LGTM. #1247. We only launch geth installer during installation. This problem is not in our installer, but in geth's. I've reported an issue in their repository.\nThank's for reporting ;). OK, so thanks to @mfranciszkiewicz we've got nice status ;)\nIssue can be closed. Fix for: #1230 . @badb Can you check this PR?. OK, max_cpu moved to another PR\n. @mfranciszkiewicz @badb Can you review it?. ## Windows\n\n\nFrom VBox Manual\nOn page 14\n\u2013 Guest multiprocessing (SMP). VirtualBox can present up to 32 virtual CPUs to each\nvirtual machine, irrespective of how many CPU cores are physically present on your\nhost.\nSection 3.4.2 (page 51)\nStarting with version 3.0, VirtualBox supports symmetrical multiprocessing (SMP)\nand can present up to 32 virtual CPU cores to each virtual machine.\nMacOS\nxhyve has right now limitation for max 16 cores\nLinux\nHappy - no limitations. Can it be merged?. @mfranciszkiewicz Do you agree to merge this?\n. We should merge it ASAP to develop and b0.8.1. @mfranciszkiewicz Could you?. Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and 17.04. Short description:\n\n\nLINUX\n\n\nAdd -dev/--develop switch to download packages from dev repo instead from main\n\n\n\"Lazy initialization\" - urls were intialized with downloaded json parsed in python. It tooks few seconds, and wasn't needed eg. when calling with --help and there's no situtation where we need all of them\n\n\nInstall docker with apt - we don't need to update checksum anymore\n\n\nFix files owner and permissions\n\n\nWINDOWS\n\n\nUpdate geth to 1.7 . Fixed in #1397 . As you can see, this function is called from main. Parameters are taken from argv. This mean, char* is casted to the temporary std::string and the reference to this temporary object is passed to addImgFile. So we need to call copy ctor.\n\n\n\nIn any case const is misleading when passing argument by value.\n\nWhy do you think so? It just protect from accidentally change of the value of param. If you want only read it, IMO, it should be marked as const.\n. Yes, you're right.\n. Right.\n. I know it looks awful, but you cannot just disable this button. It depends on window manager, not qt. Only thing, which can be done is to overwite event closeEvent, which is raised when user click 'x'. If you do this, button is still enable, but nothing happens when 'x' is clicked, so it may look like the suspension of the application. And of course, inheritance of QDialog is needed to do this, and at this moment, we have an object of this type.\nHere is a topic about this\n. Sorry, I pushed it here by mistake.\n. OK\n. Ok, done \n. OK, done :) \n. Due to documentation it's optional field with default value web3.eth.defaultAccount, so I've added _from = _from or self.web3.eth.defaultAccount\nSee: http://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web3.eth.html sendTransaction. OK. Removed. Sorry, my IDE automatically changed it and I've accidentally sent this change. It looks like etherbase address must be set. ```\nIn [72]: def ver(a, b, v):\n    sum = 0\n    l = 0\n    g = 0\n    for _ in xrange(v):\n        r = int((int(urandom(getsizeof(b)).encode('hex'), 16) % (b - a)) + a)\n        sum += r\n        if r <= (b / 2):\n            l += 1\n        else:\n            g += 1\n    sum /= v\n    print \"Avg = {}\".format(sum)\n    print \"Less than = {}\".format(l)\n    print \"Greater than = {}\".format(g)\n   ....:     \nIn [73]: ver(1, 100, 1000000)\nAvg = 50\nLess than = 504228\nGreater than = 495772\n. If we have mining enable by default, maybe we should remove this line: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/develop/golem/ethereum/node.py#L108 ? It is duplicated by https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/develop/golem/ethereum/node.py#L131 with probably another address.. Maybe it would be better to set it to '>='?. Done. Done. Done. Fixed. Done. Fixed. Done. Done. It have to be overwritten. I'm not sure, but isn't it possible, that `end` will be greater than `start`? Wouldn't it cause any error?. Remove unused parameter. Later in `_prepare` it is used: `image=self.image.name`. So, IMO, it will be better if it fail at the beginning, rather than later, forcing people to debbuging, and searching what's wrong..\n\n  assert 1 == 2\n\nE       AssertionError: assert 1 == 2\n\n      self.assertEqual(1, 2)\nE       AssertionError: 1 != 2\nBoth are similar for me.  In some cases using `self.assertXXX` is more readable, eg. `assert foo()` you don't know if it check if function returns True, or just check if it's returns anything. If you use `self.assertTrue(foo())`, then it's clear. And, IMO, it will be better to always do assertions in one way. But, of course, if you want, I can revert it.. That's strange. It is calculated as:\n        resource_size = 0\n        task_resources = set(filter(os.path.isfile, task_resources))\n        for resource in task_resources:\n            resource_size += os.stat(resource).st_size\nDoes it failed on Windows or on Linux?. Fixed. Fixed. OK, done\n@badb could you check if this error still occurs? Because I cannot reproduce it. Fixed. Done\n. Done. Done. Done. Done. My bad. I thought, that 'path to main golem directory' means `/some/path/golem`, not `/some/path/golem/../`\nFixed. OK, we can do it, but later, not now. For now it is enought as for me.\nBTW. CI wouldn't increase version. `increase` parameter is defined as `'bdist_wheel` in argv` in `setup.py`, and as far as I know, CI doesn't launch `bdist_wheel`.. There is `src` constant, but I cannot find a way to use constants in `#define`. Fixed. Fixed. Fixed. Fixed. Done. Done. Done. Done. Done. Done. Done. Why did you remove this? It was asking user if he want to run script as root and if he want, then rerun script with `sudo`. What's wrong with this?\n. When run with `sudo` it will set `SUDO_USER` to `root`\nadam@adam:~ [15:26:33] $ cat test.sh \n\n!/bin/bash\necho $(whoami)\nadam@adam:~ [15:26:36] $ ./test.sh \nadam\nadam@adam:~ [15:26:38] $ sudo ./test.sh \nroot\nadam@adam:~ [15:26:44] $ \n``\nAnd we useSUDO_USERto get a name of user who called script (which is always launch with root privileges: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/develop/Installer/Installer_Linux/install.sh#L186)SUDO_USER       Set to the login of the user who invoked sudoSo, if you want to use the user name (which always will beroot), why don't use just$USER?

In the code (lines 66 and 78 it is changed). You can use -n operator (non-empty)\n`if [[ -n \"${diff}\" ]]; then. Why have you changed exr to png?. @mfranciszkiewicz Yes we does: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/develop/Installer/Installer_Linux/install.sh#L128\nBut it was added just to update docker. @mfranciszkiewicz Can it be removed? Or it will break something?. Is it used anywhere? Maybe you should add -h/--help option?. If you want to parse arguments, please make sure, that you handel all options.

( ubuntu desktop 16.04 )\n\nWhere should all this logic go to be compatible with the rpc / gui?\n\nMost steps I could think of next are marked as TODO in the code.\nPlease note: All this POC does is run golemcli tasks test on save files from the old GUI. To test 'empty' values they are set to \"\" in the test.gt file manually.\nWill continue when i'm back from holiday!\n. @mfranciszkiewicz i think this issue is deprecated now the GUI is moved.. Made an attempt to fix this issue, please check PR#1148\nedit: added link. TL:DR;\nThink its in client.py constructor as use_monitor, but could not find any configuration.\nWould like to help fix this, but need some hints getting started.\nFull comment:\nAfter some digging in the code i think this issue is about:\n./golem/client.py:80:            use_monitor=True\nThis boolean disables the monitor in that file, it seems to do that correct but i am no expert. When turning it off it still builds and runs, i do not see any notable difference.\nAfter a global search it did not seem to affect other files, what other channels of communication have to be checked before the monitor is properly off?\nAll configuration to enable it seems lost, all places where ' Client(' is called do not use the use_monitor parameter.\nAlso, none of the versions until 0.4.0 mention anything in the --help about more options. Do you remember where this was configurable at the time?\nIf i'm looking in the correct direction i can try to add the option. Else please point me in the right direction to assist on this amazing project.. Looked at adding this to the cli, worked for the 'interface' part but the data is missing.\n\nIs the version number of each node available in the peersession info?\nWhat version are we looking for; app, p2p or an other?\nDoes it make sense to add it to the gui with Electron coming?. Anytime! Thank you for the quick reply!\n\nSo I can:\n- expose APP_VERSION to the rpc\n- add it to the peer and/or PeerSessionInfo\n- put it on the screen as int\nWill look for where the peer data is loaded later, have to go now.. Thanks for the clear reply! It helped me make the commit into this PR.\nshould we make a new issue for the rpc mapping?. Updated the PR with test results, this made some new questions:\n\nHow to not hard-code the version in tests? import and use APP_VERSION?\nIs the \"patch\" for network dht enough for now? will make a new issue to follow up.. ok, sounds good!\n\ngolemapp --version should do the trick in most cases, if properly linked.. :). Geth is no longer installed by default in golem since a few versions. It has been moved to a remote Geth instance.\nYou are still able to install it and make golem use the local instance instead.\nClosing this issue for now, please make a new issue or re-open this if you have any trouble running the latest version.. Hey beastybryan,\nThanks for the report!\nI'll try it tonight on the develop branch, to confirm it is still happening.\nCould you please provide the last few lines of your log file after the error occurred? it should be in ~/golem-0.6.0/logs/ when you used the installer or where you extracted your package.\nHave a great day!\nMaaktweluit. Thanks for the info!\nIf you put code quotes ` on a separate line it becomes a multi line block :)\nI've also checked it on develop and the error is still there.\nIn terminal it shows:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/maaktweluit/src/golem/gui/controller/taskcontexmenucustomizer.py\", line 69, in __show_result_triggered\n    self.logic.show_task_result(self.task_desc.definition.task_id)\n  File \"/home/maaktweluit/src/golem/gui/applicationlogic.py\", line 300, in show_task_result\n    self.customizer.show_task_result(task_id)\n  File \"/home/maaktweluit/src/golem/gui/controller/mainwindowcustomizer.py\", line 167, in show_task_result\n    file_ = t.task_state.outputs[num]\nIndexError: list index out of range\nSubprocess 2586 exited with code -6\ngolem_gui.log show nothing\ngolemclient.log only shows:\n2017-06-20 19:33:17 INFO     golem.network.transport.tcpnetwork  Deserialization of messages from 50.175.188.188:40102 failed, maybe it's still too short?\n2017-06-20 19:33:33 INFO     golem.ethereum                      Node terminated in 0.00 s.

Rebased this branch onto develop after conflicts appeared.. Rebased for conflicts. Updated my node mwu-vps/1(v0.7.1) to this branch rebased on develop.\nCurrent stats are: 308 (err:1 tout:13)\nMost timeouts where from before the bug.. Hey Golem team,\nI'm off on holiday for 2 weeks, please continue this issue without me if needed. When back i can fix comments / conflicts.\nHave a good one!\nMaaktweluit. Yay! maybe we can also resolve some of the loading / path hacks at the top of https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/blob/master/golem_messages/cryptography.py. Yes, golem is still running on the testnet. Works as expected, test success :D \nhttps://circleci.com/gh/golemfactory/golem/4961. Thanks for the reply!\nTo confirm this, i have compared the source of the manual package vs the official github released version and it shows only whitespace changes.\nEdit: travis uses a package as well it seems\n- brew install python3 qt5 openexr freeimage. The issue is solved now :). Both travis and circleci have problems with:\ntests/golem/resource/swift/test_swift_resourcemanager.py .F.\nLocally on ubuntu and windows this error is not consistently reproducible.. Closing PR due to qt debugging, i can rebase and re-test this branch when the time is right.. it looks like python is missing, can you check using python --version?\nmaybe ubuntu 17 only has python2 or python3?\nThis causes HyperG to have the wrong install file.\nP.S. you can use on a line before and after the logs to format them all `monospace`. No need for python here, bash can handle it all:\nwget -qO- --header='Accept: application/json' \\\n https://api.github.com/repos/mfranciszkiewicz/golem-hyperdrive/releases \\\n | grep browser_download_url | grep linux | head -n 1 | grep -o 'https[^\"]*'\n``. indeed, combining the first 2 grep's into thegrep -o` could also work with non pretty json.\nsince github is currently giving pretty json it seems better then assuming python is installed on 16.04. is this also a rule in one of the linters? can help keep it clean :). https://docs.pylint.org/en/1.6.0/features.html\nexpected-line-ending-format: LF\ncan enforce this, eslint ( javascript ) has the same rule, thats how i know about it. Commented this on the PR :). Found a way to trigger a webhook on each pull request event.\nWe should make an endpoint to filter the requests and trigger the build accordingly.\nI propose to implement the exit code for now, it can even skip coverage in fast mode.\nFor the hooks we can make an issue or wait for buildbot to make it better.. Made all agents fail when only fast test ran. Looks like only circle is able to query github today, added a known issue in the main comment.\nAlso picked #1310 fix to this branch to get proper linting results.. Ready for review!\nBuilds will only show proper coverage-diff and full green statuses after 2 approvals. Marked some more tests as slow.\nOn circle this removed 400s compared to the previous build.\nOn appveyor it only removed 60s, probably due to @ci_skip.\nPlease note 'checks' are red until 2 approvals, unless #1314 happens.. Agree with all points above.\nAs described in the OP there where 2 solves, use github (statuses and webhooks) OR fail when ran slow.\nAlso i am not sure if coverage show properly when only parts of the test run.\nI propose to leave this pull as is and make a follow up issue to migrate the exit 0 to a new status / webhook call.. the approval check is already native to github, the current problem is using the same status for slow and fast runs.\n\nDoes not re-trigger builds after 2 approvals, leaving the light green\n\nThis problem was solved with exit 1, and could be solved with a separate status or webhook.\n@badb should I change this in this issue or make a follow up?. ready for another round of reviews.\ntravis fails in a weird way, can not reproduce on my mac.\nwill look into this and the next comments tonight.. Lowered the required approvals to 1 and fixed travis!. removing the approval keeps it on the API:\nhttps://api.github.com/repos/golemfactory/golem/pulls/1300/reviews\nWe should make the script smarter to only look at the last entry per user/reviewer.. @badb it looks like the old approval remains in the list, so the un-approval does not override it.\nhttps://api.github.com/repos/golemfactory/golem/pulls/1300/reviews\nWill have a look if i can remove duplicates ( per user ) before checking the approval count. @badb resolved in latest commit, it only takes the last \"vote\" of each user now\nlove python!. @badb they are skipped for a different reason:\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/task/dummy/test_dummy_task.py:9: It doesn't work, using new dummy task instead\nWant me to remove these skips? not sure what the impact will be, the message states it does not work.. good one! will do it when i get home tonight!. Closing, will be merged in #1487. Whoops, thought i closed it 18h ago.... It can not lint new files on the working branch: file is not found when it switches to develop.\nSee related issue for a linked build and logs. @marmistrz nice catch! when mypy or pylint can expand the * its even better!. @marmistrz we can remove the \"create\" part from this issue and only keep the \"test and save default values to task file\".\nWill update the title to be more clear.\nWhen #1331 is finished i'll rebase and continue on this PR. closing this PR because it is stale for a year.\nWe can use the branch as reference when we pick up #823 again. Still valid but now we own the agents it is even less priority.. @joshkirby this warning during the installation should not cause the app to give this error when starting.\nGood things to check when this error happens are:\n- Is Golems program files folder in the PATH?\n- Is C:\\OpenSSL created and in your PATH?\nWhen these checks are completed golem should create logs about any other error, if you are running the latest version they are in C:\\Users\\<NAME>\\.golem\\default\\logs \nFeel free to tag me in the #testers channel on rocket chat if you have any more questions.. @badb yes, we can select a list of available windows versions, should we only allow windows 10 pro next release?. Two down, one to go:\n\n\nNext steps before releasing:\n- python 2 to python 3\n- windows unit test\n- grouped build ( optional )\n- decide on hosting\nAdded those to OP\n. From the PR #1455, 3 tasks left to pickup on next update:\n- Update hyperg to 0.2.3\n- Remove ipfs after #1548 \n- upload codecov to s3\nAdded those to OP. Windows blockers solved :D\n\nWill group all open branches and:\n- Remove python2\n- Remove ipfs\n- Add guiding build\n- Check re-build protection to not build all 3 when one fails.. Removed IPFS and python2\nAlso added inno to build installer after binaries\nNext steps are:\n- guiding builds\n- re-build protection\n- coverage\n- nightly repo uploads.. Made great progress on the controlling jobs.\n- structure setup and tested\n- PR hook enabled\n- PR approval count migrated\n- enabled multiple workers per server for control builds\nNext step are:\n- [x] upload coverage\n- [x] write nightly job\n- [x] Test new status reports\n- [x] Test artefacts with original version from version.py\n- [x] Add rebuild protection on previous success of commit + platform\n- [x] migrate lint job\n . Made good progress on:\n- Finish rebuild protection\n- Adding linter tests\n- Test status reports and version parsing\n- Add multiple workers for production setup\nGot blocked by Windows not behaving as intended:\n- Installer broke on end-to-end test setup ( reported jberezanski/ChocolateyPackages issue 28 ). Made work-around so i could continue\n- Windows unit tests broke on paymentkeeper, made issue #1738. Added skips for these tests for now.\nNext steps are:\n- [x] Hide coverage secret ( WIP )\n- [x] Write nightly build ( WIP )\n- [x] Merge new files required for production setup #1743 \n- [x] Setup production\n- [x] Link production with github\n. Requested the migration this morning, Y2 will propose a transfer window.. Relates to #1571 . builds only failed on not enough approvals.\ndoes show the extra information nicely!. @jiivan @mdtanrikulu this looks like a duplicate of PR #1479 can this be closed or is it different?. @Radagast-red Thanks for the review! Replied on the \"conversation\" page to all questions, do not see them on the \"files changed\", sorry!\nI am traveling tomorrow but will run some tests Tuesday and make fixes or show logs.. Started my machines and ran some tests based on the comments, the results:\n- With the current configuration the daemon-stop command still runs when cancelling the build. only when the worker crashes this can still be a problem.\n- LANG is not needed to run the tests, removed it. ( take care when re-installing the machine )\n- hyperg and ipfs need to run in daemon mode else a lot of tests are skipped. Propose to make a separate issue to remove this 'manual' dependency and start the daemons from the test. ( @badb ? ). ~~pushed, but PR does not update.. bad github..~~\n~~https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/compare/develop...maaktweluit:mwu/linux_unit_test?expand=1~~\nUpdated PR!\n@Radagast-red please check again, all q's are replied to. Updated the repo back to the original now nogui is merged.\nAlso created #1548 to get rid of all IPFS references, tests and dependencies.. Circle failed due to approvals, now running again\nAppveyor failed on ethereum, think it has to do with the full harddrive, will re-run when this is reported fixed.. This happens when a newer version is already installed, as far as i have tested the newer version works fine for us too.\nAs a first step i will check for the current version, and then try to add incremental versions as well.. After a lot of debugging and comparing 0.8.0 with this version the errors nor ports matter.\nThe first line missing from the current branch in the logs is hyperg \"looking up\" the resources. @Radagast-red do you know where this ( accept task and download resource ) should be happening?\nCalling it a day for now, will continue with a fresh look :). Found and fixed it!\nTurned out the price in taskserver was not allowed to be equal, only greater then.\nAlso added config_logging to the dummy nodes so on errors there is logging available.\n@Elfoniok @mfranciszkiewicz Thank you for all the help and please review again.\nPropose the following \"follow up\" tasks:\n- [ ] Add better asserts to the dummy task ( None | exit code 0 is minimal )\n- [ ] Remove old dictionary ( isinstance ) based code facilitating the dummy task.\n- [ ] Add task_defenition to dummy task so there are no ( ignorable ) errors\n@badb  Please advice on what issue to make where, if any.. Seems this PR is done when its updated and maybe an issue is created for splitting the test\n@etam @jiivan is this correct?\nShall i update the conflict?. Should this issue be closed now its moved?. @badb shall I close #1301 ? there are 2 open PR's with the same code.. @ujjwalgulecha circle failed on docker, think a rebuild would solve it there. Appveyor looks good, only needs 1 more approval to also run the slow tests and turn green.. Same here, will ask someone to hit it :)\nedit: its building again. @Elfoniok This PR looks ready for merge, anything left to fix? If so, can i help?. @Radagast-red Thank you for the clear reply, double approved now :). Reviewed the script ( did not test ), only some small question:\n\nIs python the right version of python or should it be brew install python3?\nShould docker-machine start golem be called ( instead of env without eval ) before loading the env?\n\nAlso most commands are once, only docker-machine start and eval $(docker-machine env) need to be run each time after computer restart, maybe this can be split.\nFor the rest it is super clear and look good :). Since #1487 qt is no longer a dependency. LGTM!\n. @ederenn updated the OP with `` for better formatting, could you check if its still correct?. first few googles on this hint to runningdocker-machine env golem` after each config change.\nWill reproduce the error locally and see if this is indeed the correct solve.. @mfranciszkiewicz thanks for the input!\nMy first check indeed show the command is already called, now digging in deeper.\nNot able to reproduce though :(. Tested on 0.8.1 and on 0.9.0 and can not reproduce the error, maybe mac osx 10.13 is not affected by this?\n@mfranciszkiewicz  did you also get this error on mac high sierra?. Reproduced it!\nThe first tests show it does not happen when only stopping during computation, but will test more to be sure.\nSteps taken:\n- Accept a task on mac, confirm its calculating\n- Hit stop golem\n- Change config\n- Hit start golem\n- Error is there. After loads of trying and debugging i have found the underlying error:\n2017-10-26 11:36:21 WARNING  golem.docker.manager                DockerMachine: failed to stop the VM: Command '['docker-machine', 'stop', 'golem']' returned non-zero exit status 1. -- b'Stopping \"golem\"...\\n(golem) Stopping golem ...\\nunexpected EOF\\n'\nstop is the first command that fails and unexpected EOF is where you see the issue is happening.\nChanged start to restart and it seems to recover properly now.\nRunning a few more tests to be 100% sure before pushing my branch and making a PR.. good one! will add those when testing from a clean machine, when running the second time it goes through fine.\nWill discuss if we trust Sourceforge enough to use the \"official\" project URL, for now the internal one is fine, just for my own AWS it will not work.. My bad! i assumed it was internal only :$ then we can leave it for sure!. @etam are all your requested changes fixed? just finished the service and want to merge this PR before making a new PR.. @etam Thanks!\n@pstiasny Can you look at this last comment? or want me to include it in my service PR?. Could you try running brew doctor?\nPlease also use ``` before and after blocks of logs to make them more readable. @etam are the changes/replies good to approve?. Does this resolve #1504 ? in this case its better to change the initial comment to \"resolves\" over \"addresses\" since github will auto-close. yay for semver, it saved my OCD ^^. Double approved!. @Krigpl thanks, removed it!. Made a step in this direction with: #1660 \nOnly the flags differ from the proposed solution:\n- Normal: logs info and higher\n- Verbose ( --loglevel DEBUG ): all logs\n- Quiet ( --loglevel WARNING ): only warnings and up\nLooks like the only thing currently missing is real quiet mode, maybe this can be solved adding --loglevel ERROR as an allowed option too.\n. Investigated this a bit and seems possible, found some notes on adding OpenSSL to a local location instead of PATH based:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/23804438/find-library-in-ctypes. Few notes on my research, we can use these to get to a proper solve:\n\nPATH too long is a button in the native python3 installer, we can see if this is also available inside our installer builder software\nIn my POC for the new installer the PATH was handled properly, need to test with too long paths\nGETH is gone from the mandatory requirements\n\nProposed solve:\n- Move all PATH needing binaries to root of golem program-files folder, this way only 1 PATH is needed. ( required for golemcli.exe, but no longer mandatory )\n- Resolve golemapp.exe and hyperg.exe to working directory when not available in PATH\n- OpenSSL seems more tricky, but can use dynamic adding to PATH to ensure this version is loaded over any other installed version on the users system.. Ran some tests on windows:\n- Without openssl, the application makes no logs, this makes it hard to test with this.\n- Moved hyperg and openssl into the application folder, found:\n  - Golem.exe ( electron ) does not find golemapp without PATH.\n  - Golemapp.exe does not find open SSL without PATH.\n  - Golemapp.exe does not find hyperg without PATH.\n- Everything worked as expected when adding only the PF\\Golem folder to the PATH.\n@badb Is this enough to solve this issue, or should we look into loading every step from the current working directory over one single PATH entry?. From reading the code it seems there is a command-line argument --start-geth that defaults to False and controls if local geth is started and used.\nThe next steps in this issue are:\n- Remove geth from installers\n  - mac\n  - windows\n  - linux\n- Add electron option to toggle --start-geth on from the GUI\n- test, test, test. Tested it locally by removing geth from brew.\nGolemapp 0.9.0 still working.\nThen removed it with @gborowik from the homebrew dev repo. Will prepare a PR for the live repo so it can be merged on 0.9.1 release day. Tested installer generation on windows, works!. @mfranciszkiewicz Good one! checked it and seems its not used anymore, so removed it!. From rocket chat someone had some idea's for the stats send to the monitor.\nIf not picked up in this issue please make a follow up issue to extend the send data.\n\nBenchmark scores\nHardware specs\nCPU speed\nCPU model\n..... hey @kascheri12 ,\n\nThanks for the report!\nSome questions to help reproduce the errors:\n\nWhat OS are you using?\nHow are you running golem? ( source or binary )\nWhen does the error occur? ( seen it before golemapp fully started, does it happen after too ). @Krigpl Thanks! will wait for a second check :). @mfranciszkiewicz good one! fixed it :). @pstiasny please re-review, all comments are fixed and tested.. @badb or @mfranciszkiewicz could you please review this PR?. Closing to be merged as one branch for buildbot unit test.. Hey @Alino \n\nThe milestones are moved to trello:\nhttps://trello.com/b/YL1qZ2pZ/brass-kanban\nThe blog post where this was announced has some more information on how / why:\nhttps://blog.golemproject.net/11-after-11-11-5c7b8dd6df85. hey @kascheri12 \nGreat idea!\nIf you are on a linux system ( mac needs some gnu-tools ) you can use:\ngolemcli tasks show | grep \"Waiting\\|Completed\" | grep -o '^\\S*' | sed 's/^/golemcli tasks delete /' | bash -s\nchange Waiting\\|Completed to the statuses you want to delete and it will clean them all up one by one. Each one separated by \\|\nIf you want to test it first and see what it will do remove | bash -s and you will see the commands it creates before executing them.\nPoke me in #testers chat on rocket if you need some more help on this. Then we can leave the issue focussed on the golem feature. Resolved by: #3303. This seems the core of the problem, both nodes run the same versions / develop\n2017-11-10 16:52:42 INFO     golem.network.p2p.peersession       b'Starting peer session '10.30.10.96':53203'\n2017-11-10 16:52:42 INFO     golem.network.p2p.peersession       b'P2P protocol version mismatch 16 vs 15 (local) for node '10.30.10.96':53203'\n2017-11-10 16:52:42 INFO     golem.network.transport.session     b'Disconnecting 10.30.10.96 : 53203 reason: Protocol version'. @kascheri12 Thanks for the report!\nserver 188.165.227.180', port=4000is fixed now, please test again.. Configured https://uptimerobot.com, ready for testing!. this docker error was solved by running docker-machine rm golem && docker-machine create --driver xhyve golem.. ~~relates to #1630~~\nThanks @etam: not related, only the same error message. Was wondering how linux did it when working on the mac unit tests.\nSolved it in one of the unit tests branches, can extract it and make a separate PR if you want is asap.. This alpha version of golem uses the rinkeby test network of ethereum. There is no way inside the app to move your test GNT to another account.. @badb can i merge this or would you like one more approval?. i think we can go for version 2 for now.\nMost people removed all old versions before 0.9\nWhen the new 0.10.0 needs the driver fix we can add it again, but hope we can build it to clean up by itself.. @jiivan Yep, sorry, was distracted by GETH problems in my review spree.\nOne small q there\nAlso re-triggered the builds for you. Duplicate of #1630 . for unit tests i fully agree they should be decoupled from any remote components.\nthis can only be done when said test are covered as integration tests.\nuntil then maybe we can run all tests on local geth instances to not have it fail on devops related errors.. \nFirst buildbot installer is made, will test it myself first and then send it to @ederenn for testing. Tested the first nightly build and it works for me\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ylp_QyK66bP5ytu3jF3LR_Bwd8TeJXeM\n@ederenn when you have time could you try this binary too?\nIts from develop a few days ago.. Quick google shows we should update https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython\nThe latest master is not released yet.\nFixed when running:\npip install git+https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython. hey @Kennyl , \nThank you for the report!\nWhat version of golem are you running? it looks like 0.9.0\nThe log folder should be created in ~/.golem in this version, could you check who owns this folder? the command for that is: ls -lah ~/.golem\nIf you ran golem with sudo before you should run it with sudo again or chown all folders back to your regular user.\nIf this is the case also look at ~/Library/Application\\ Support/golem\nHope it helps, you can also poke me on Rocket chat under the same username for any questions :). Indeed, permissions also look good to me :)\nThe error posted is related to docker machine, can you stop golem and re-create the machine?\n```\nQuit golem if running, then run:\ndocker-machine rm golem\ndocker-machine create --driver xhyve golem\n```\nMaybe you run into #1698 after this.\nWhen this is the case another fix to try is removing all docker working files: stop golem, then sudo rm -rd ~/.docker please note: this deletes ALL docker images, not only golem related ones.. Same bug has just been spotted on windows #1736 logs are in the comments there.. Thanks for checking, fixing and replying to all review comments: All have been resolved.\nPlease let me know when parts have changed requiring re-review. @badb Yes, i'll add it to this page and then close the issue.\nWe applied the \"fix\" where we needed for multi-OS and it is no longer blocking.. Added here after updating the page to the new headers and template: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/wiki/Common-problems#unicodedecodeerror-utf-8-codec-can-t-decode. Thanks for the fixes and replies!\nReplied to the last open thread. hey @hivemall \nThanks for the report!\nIn your log there are 2 errors worth checking:\n- docker install had errors\n- golemapp install had errors\nSeems like you checked if docker is working, so this should not be the problem.\nLooking at the golem install, can you try to manually install this package?\n```\nDownload latest release ( replaced /tmp/ with ~ )\nwget -qO- https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/releases/download/0.9.1/golem-linux_x64-0.9.1.tar.gz > ~/golem-linux.tar.gz\nExtract it\ntar -zxvf ~/golem-linux.tar.gz\nCreate directory if it does not exists\n[[ ! -d ~/golem ]] && mkdir -p ~/golem\nCopy files to golem directory\ncp -rf ~/golem-0.9.1/* ~/golem\nClean up archive and extracted tmp folder\nrm -rf ~/golem-0.9.1/ &>/dev/null\nrm ~/golem-linux.tar.gz &>/dev/null\nSetup symlinks\nsudo ln -s ~/golem/golemapp /usr/local/bin/golemapp\nsudo ln -s ~/golem/golemcli /usr/local/bin/golemcli\n```\nPlease note the release numbers are hard-coded in this script. Now it is the latest but next release it needs a manual tweak.\nThe install script is only optimised for ubuntu at the moment, these steps should make it work for you as well.\n. Great to hear it helped!\nThis looks like openssl has some troubles, could you check the version with openssl version?\nOn windows i remember the wrong version is 0.9.8 and the required version is 1.0.2, not sure what versions are running on deb.. Hey @Vantskruv \nYou are correct, we use pyelliptic directly and indirectly. We are working on switching to another wrapper.\nPersonally i have no experience on Debian, on windows and mac it is possible to load other versions of OpenSSL for golemapp by adding it to the PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.\nHope it helps, if not feel free to reply here or join the discussion on rocket chat on https://chat.golem.network , you can tag me on the same nickname.\n  . @alx Closing this issue, feel free to re-open or make a new one when the issue is back.. Hey @Hardstyles \nThanks for the report!\nYou made a \"Pull request\", indicating you coded a solution for it.\nSince it seems like its a bug report or feature request this should start as an \"Issue\"\nCan you please make an issue directly next time?\nFor now i've made #1724 so we can close this PR. @badb  Not that i know of, we do not test much with vpn enabled, if you like i can enable it and run some tests. Hey @AniimaL \nThank you for your report!\nFrom what you describe here everything should be fine, lets run some checks to see:\n- Can you see yourself on https://stats.golem.network/show\n- Did you test your open ports with an external tool? f.i. canyouseeme.org ( app must be running )\n- Can you check for errors in your logs? ~/.golem/logs on mac/linux and C:\\Users\\<USER>\\.golem\\logs on win.\nYou can paste the error lines here surrounded in ``` or send the while file\n. Hey @AniimaL \nThis seems related to #1698 as well, @slonus can you check your log if you have the same error?\n2017-12-06 23:28:27 WARNING  golem.docker.task_thread            b'Task stderr:\\nshell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory\njob-working-directory: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory\n/usr/bin/python: can't open file '/golem/work/job.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory\nWill comment on that issue that its on windows as well, this one can be closed as duplicate after we collected some more information:\n\nWhat version of golem are you running? ( v0.9.1? )\nHow did you install Golem ( from installer? )\nDid you install golem before\nIf so, did you uninstall before installing\nDid you configure anything manually during or after installation? ( other folders then default, other settings then default ). @slonus indeed the logs look OK, how long have you been running it? since it is a test net there are not always tasks requested.\nFor the second logs, did you quit the app at the end? if not it did crash there.\n\n@AniimaL same error in the logs? the team will start investigating this error.\nIf you see any other error that might help please post it.\nThanks again both for running the alpha! its of great help to make the app better :). Tested this by removing the 2 skip lines, the same 2 errors show up. #2122 . test_paymentskeeper.py no longer exists.. @etam @Elfoniok added one more file i missed, please check again. Thanks for the update!\nLast weeks we had some breaking frozen packages and found out future self will be happy with these comments. This way we can upgrade more safely and quickly if we know the root cause.. Made issues for:\n- Nightly uploads\n- Redundant master\nWill try to fix the rebuild-slow and rebase to get this finished PR merged.. Updated the code to the latest of develop and made all follow up issues.\nNow this PR is ready to be reviewed and merged :). Thank you all for the great comments!\nReplied to all and updated the PR.\nAlso added 1 small fix after the \"pull request webhooks\" got enabled and broke ( SHA c66ee6a ). Linter can be green with 2 tweaks:\nC: golem/model.py:5:0: standard import \"import pickle\" should be placed before \"from golem_messages import message\" (wrong-import-order)\nC: golem/task/tasksession.py:386:0: Line too long (88/80) (line-too-long). @badb Thank you for checking out the fix!\nSounds like the crypto vs cryptography issue will break this when merged.\nWould propose to:\n- Use golem_messages.cryptography and make this the leading location for this logic\n- Add golem_cryptography and move all related logic here.\nPropose to go for option 1 now, and make a follow up issue for option 2.. Made good steps today on this issue:\n- Moved the fix to golem_messages.cryptography\n- Removed golem.core.crypto\n- Moved tests and missing logic from crypto to cryptography\n- Made PR in golem_messages, blocking this one\n- Made #1880 as follow up issue to make it its own package\n. This will be partially solved by #1988 \nTo make it even better, shall i add a warning or look for a fix from the application side @badb ?. Installed golem-0.9.1 on windows 10, versions:\n- Docker : 17.06.2-ce\n- Virtual Box : 5.1.26\nInstalled golem-0.10.0 on windows 10, versions:\n- Docker : 17.10.0-ce\n- Vitrual Box : 5.2.0\nInstalled golem-0.11.0 on windows 10, versions:\n- Docker : 17.10.0-ce\n- Vitrual Box : 5.2.0\nInstalled latest Docker stable, versions:\n- Docker : 18.01.0-ce\n- Vitrual Box : 5.2.4\nDuring this whole test only between 0.9.1 and 0.10.0 the VirtualBox required repair. Making me think the bug only shows up when upgrading VirtualBox from 5.1.x to 5.2.x. Made an item of this based on the new template of common problems and solutions:\n\"Error Starting Docker\" after upgrade of golem\nSymptoms:\n\n\nWhen golem starts it shows the error \"Error Starting Docker\"\n\n\n\nWhen starting Docker Quickstart Terminal it shows error \"Error creating machine\"\n\n\n\nIn golem.log it shows ERROR    golem.docker.manager    DockerMachine: failed to start the VM: Command '['docker-machine', 'restart', 'golem']' returned non-zero exit status 1.\n\n\nDescription:\nDuring the upgrade of golem, VirtualBox also got updated, this caused the existing docker-machines to stop working. \nResolution:\n\nclose Golem\nclose VirtualBox in Task Manager\nhit windows key and type \"Add or remove programs\"\nthen search for \"virtual box\" and select \"modify\"\nclick modify -> repair\nrestart\n\nFound\n20 Dec 2017 by @ederenn\nRelates to:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/1786\nAffected version:\ngolem 0.9.1 and before\n. @Misterdudeman did the resolution mentioned by @ederenn as first comment resolve the issue for you?. Duplicate fixes where needed in #1785 and #1788. Great to hear it was solved! \nGoing to close it now, feel free to re-open or open a new issue when you have any issues.\nA good place to check when making an issue are the logs: %LOCALAPPDATA%\\golem\\golem\\default\\logs on windows\n. when using the 0.10.0 release the logs have moved to: %LOCALAPPDATA%\\golem\\golem\\default\\logs. Hey @apolikamixitos \nThank you for the report!\nCould you please share the logs of the golem application?\nwindows logs are in %LOCALAPPDATA%\\golem\\golem\\default\\logs, mac logs are in ~/Library/Application\\ Support/golem/default/logs and linux in ~/.local/share/golem/default/logs\nThis way we can pinpoint the error and debug it faster..

[] '\nThis will be solved in #1602 \n. Hey @Poppiii,\nThank you for the report!\nSince this is an old issue with old resolutions i've created a new issue #1994 for investigating your error.\nGoing to reply there now :). Hey @Technoprenerd \nThank you for the report!\nCould you share the results of docker-machine ls?\nSometimes when docker updates the machine needs to be re-created. This can be done with:\n- Close golem\n- run in terminal docker-machine rm golem and confirm with y\n- Open golem\nThe first start can take longer since it has to create the machine.\nWhen this does not work for some people it helped to remove the whole docker cache folder, sudo rm -rd ~/.docker. Please note this removes all docker images you ever used, only a problem in case you use docker for other things too.\nHope it helps, if it does not feel free to comment again or tag me on rocket https://chat.golem.network. Thanks!\nThat IP is assigned by docker, it looks good.\nToo bad the 2 commands did not work.\nCan you try the pull command manually to see if it gives a more clear error?\n```\nensure the machine is running\ndocker-machine restart golem \nmake docker command use this machine\neval $(docker-machine env golem)\npull the images\ndocker pull golemfactory/base:1.2\n```. Will dig into those errors and let you know.\nOn windows the docker daemon does not work when the docker app is running, maybe it is the same on mac.. Could you close docker.app and try again?. Indeed strange errors generated there by docker.\nSome users in chat had problems with docker after an upgrade and in they're case sudo rm -rd ~/.docker helped. Please note this deletes all downloaded docker images and machines. Be careful if you use docker outside of golem.. Hey @Gffy \nThank you for the report!\nTried to reproduce it today on my windows and it seems to work for me.\nCould you please describe your scenario in more details so i can reproduce and document it?\nFor example:\n- Did installation work with UAC OFF?\n- Is there any error in the logs when you start golem with UAC OFF?\n- Did you upgrade golem or install clean?\n- What version are you installing? ( i guess latest 0.10.0 )\nThanks again for helping out!\nHave a great day!\nMaaktweluit\n. Thank you for the information!\nWill run some tests and see if i can find the root cause.. Hey @chriscrutt \nThanks for the feedback!\nThere are 2 sides to this:\n- Estimation before starting ( related to #823 )\n- Payments \n  - Ensure you have enough when starting\n  - Ensure you have enough when finished\n  - Pay per second of computing\nI think Golem should check before requesting any task if the worse case scenario can be payed for, excluding already running tasks and they're worse case estimates.\nSince i'm not sure i will check with the team and get back to you on the payments side.\nHave a good one!\n. Spoke to the team on payments:\nThe taxi scenario should never happen, currently Golem checks before starting a task like i described.\nThe payments are currently based on the timeout, not the time spend. There are a lot of edge cases and trust issues to make this better, not sure if this will be picked up before the Brass release.\nHope this answers all your questions, if not feel free to re-open the issue or join the discussion on chat.golem.network. You can tag me on the same username.. Hey @chriscrutt \nThis is currently now implemented yet, there is an issue to start on this: #750\nThis issue would be a next step after the account features have been added.. Maybe you can have a look at Shippable, there are 3 errors where 2 can be removed with # pylint: disable=no-member ( add # noqa #py.... if it gets too long ). This also fixes #1137 . @jiivan Turns out it was already merged back, how did the tree break for you?. I see this issue did not auto-close.\nNext time you can use one of these keywords to link the issue and the PR: https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/. Can add my 2 cents for these questions:\n- The support request stated: \n\nYes, public should be HTTPS only, private can be HTTP.\n- The settings are setup by Y2 as \"Round robin best practice\" i did not check the config on fd-limits.\n- This depends on how certain we can be this server is always up, would be nice to be able to, but safer to have a plan B.. You can make a support ticket at Y2 to check or update the configs.\nPlease let me know if you want me to pick that up.. Made a support ticket!\n\nRequested to add port 55555 and check the configs.\nPorts 443 and 80 can be removed after golem release to reduce scanners / spam.\n@etam if you have any additions to check / add here please let me know!. @mfranciszkiewicz fixed the config split in the mac version, please have a look!\nWill apply to linux and mac when reviewed. @mfranciszkiewicz Thanks for the tips, applied them all! Please check one final time, then we can merge :). While investigating this issue i found a few things:\n- Buildbot mac_01 and mac_02 have different mac versions. One is not as requested\n- secp256k1-0.13.2-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_10_x86_64.whl from https://builds.golem.network/simple/secp256k1 does not work\n- secp256k1-0.13.2.tar.gz from https://pypi.python.org/simple/secp256k1 does work\nI propose to remove the 10_10 version from our pypi server so it can use the global, generic one.. re-ran the build and it passed the point where it failed.\nSeems to be fixed with this\nhttps://buildbot.golem.network/buildbot/#/builders/6/builds/78\nWill close when it is green.. Test success!. This does not work well with windows, resolved the issue in a different way.. After checking the test result something seems wrong:\n./lintdiff.sh: line 95: flake8: command not found. PR is merged, so closing this one\n@ktomala you can link the issue and pr by using https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/. Found the file golem/RELEASE-VERSION was not bundled by pyinstaller. Running a test now and will make a PR when success.. Thank you for the reply.\nNow the naming makes a lot of sense, will approve!\nmaking --start-geth smarter sounds like a nice idea but not needed for this fix.. rebuild Appveyor now it has an approval.\nPlease check Shippable, one fix and it will be a green build :)\n```\nChanged lines findings:\n./golem/node.py:147:81: E501 line too long (85 > 80 characters)\n.

Thank you for the rebase!\nRan tests on mac as well, these went flawless.\nAlso see buildbot/control_test is green so looks good :)\nOnly the 1 windows comment left on the PR.. Thanks, clear to me.\n@mfranciszkiewicz Is this the way we can handle releases without duplicates?. Issue also spotted on ubuntu 17.10 ( from public chat )\ngolem.error.log\n. @badb Shared the logs with you, hope it helps!. Thank you all for the reports, logs and resolution!\nClosing this issue, feel free to re-open or create a new one when the issue persists.. hey @sdrpa \nThank you for the report!\nThe first error indicates another golemapp is still running. This can be caused by Golem.app. If you want to configure golemapp with arguments you have to start it before Golem.app and it will connect automatically\nThe second error is new to me, to check, did you configure xhyve with the 2 sudo commands after installation ( found on readme under Installation ). We use xhyve as docker machine hypervisor, so we are dependent on its minimum system requirements.\nFor example on Windows this is VirtualBox, and requires certain HyperV and Bios settings to be working. \nMaybe on mac there are similar bios/OSs setting to enable this. Reading some quick google results on vmx_init: processor not supported by Hypervisor.framework there are some things to try, and some hardware limitations. Please be careful applying changes in the bios, use at own risk.\nLet us know if you have any more questions or issues, you can also join the discussion on chat.golem.network and get answers there.\nClosing due to found root cause: processor not supported by Hypervisor.framework. Could you provide the docker version before and after the upgrade? i think this might explain the issue.. Thanks for the update!\nSeems the docker update from 17 to 18 is breaking something.\nMaybe we can lock the version in homebrew to not have this issue.\nAn alternative would be when we detect this to add it to the release notes to give users a smoother upgrade experience.. \nWill make a commit to the advanced installer buildbot branch to add this to next release.. Resolved here: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/commit/ed1772b812c618acd594bc154d2c2f26a3d6ecf8\nThe branch can be tweaked and released when the signing flow is complete.. Hey @Poppiii,\nGeth is no longer included in golem on your machine so this error should be from somewhere else.\nStrange the log is to small, are these still the only lines in the log file?\nIf there are no more logs, could you check the following things to zoom in on the problem?\n- What is your UAC setting? Some users reported when its OFF the first time you start golem it does not work.\n- Is hyperg installed with the right version? The command to test this is hyperg --version in cmd.\n- Is OpenSSL installed correctly? the command to test this is where libeay32.dll\nHope it helps!\nThanks again for the report and helping to make golem better\n. Based on these checks your setup seems correct.\nA few next checks i can think of before asking the team:\n- Does \"Docker quickstart terminal\" open without errors?\n- Could you share the log files golem.log and golem.error.log?. Thanks for the logs and the checks.\nThis all looks correct too, except for the empty log.\nWill discuss this with the team and get back to you..  Checked in with the team and we came up with 2 possible solutions:\n- Could you run golem with debug logs?\n  - Close GUI\n  - open cmd and run golemapp --loglevel DEBUG\n  - This should add more lines to the logs\n- When debug logs do not give any more info we recommend re-installing the application. Maybe something got corrupted during the upgrade.. Thank you for the debug logs. They show a bit more but unfortunately not enough.\nWhat we see is it quits while writing to the local database, this could indicate an error in your database.\nThe database is located at: %LOCALAPPDATA%\\golem\\golem\\default\\golem.db\nCould you zip your database and send it for investigation? To test if a new database helps you can rename the file before starting golem, it will create a new empty one for you.. To resolve this for you before the release we can delete the old task files.\nPlease make sure golem is NOT running while removing the files.\nThe problem is in all *.pickle files in C:\\Users\\<USER>\\AppData\\Local\\golem\\golem\\default\\tasks and sub-folders.\nIf you do not care about your task history you can delete the whole tasks folder.. This looks like a duplicate of #1827 with open pending solve #1871 . At first buildbot required to downgrade, this was already in there before i worked on it.\nWill test this on buildbots tonight when its calm and make a PR to remove it when no longer required.. You are right, the second requirement was no longer needed.\nMade a PR and tested both buildbot jobs with success!\nInvited you to review.. Hey @wp31 \nThank you for the report!\nProduction benchmark is quite a big render, this will stress your local machine during the test.\nAre there any extra assets required for this render? if so, are they included in the job?\nCould you please attach the logs from your application?. Thank you for the logs, it seems the subtask failed with this error:\nTask computing error: Subtask computation failed with exit code 247\nDoing quick search on this error code gives no result, will consult with the team and get back to you.. After consulting the team this is an out of memory error.\nHow many resources are assigned to your golem machine? this benchmark requires  > 12 GB RAM, > 6 cores (approximately). triggered re-build of appveyor now it has approvals. @tworec py3.6 seems to work well on my test buildbot-worker.\nI have followed this guide:\nhttps://www.caseylabs.com/how-to-create-a-python-3-6-virtual-environment-on-ubuntu-16-04/\nAll that was missing was the python3.6-dev package.\nRan pytest and pyinstaller with success on a 3.6 venv.\nNext step would be to add py3.6 to the ansible setup scripts so we can update all agents at once.. @tworec The pythton 3.6 pull requests are up:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/ansible-role-golem-dev-linux/pull/1\ninternal/ansible-buildbot/merge_requests/5\nWill invite reviewers and try to merge them before the buildbot release end of this week.. when you get the latest fixes from develop buildbot will work again.. Hey @golemUser1 \nThank you for the report!\ncould you also provide the golem.log? it can contain useful info messages surrounding the errors.\nAs a first step of investigation could you test where pyelleptic's base library is located?\nThis can be done running where libeay32.dll in cmd. Hey @golemUser1 !\nThank you for the report!\nThis is not an error but a warning, I think this issue should be marked UX.\nThis warning indicates that you disconnected from the monitor at stats.golem.network.\nThe message could be more clear to indicate this, golem should work regardless of this warning.\nIn the scenario you describe there should be other errors indicating there is no connection at all.\nLooking at your logs these are:\nPayment-processor:\n2018-02-03 14:55:50 ERROR    golem                               b'Service Error: Traceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"C:\\\\Python36\\\\lib\\\\threading.py\", line 916, in _bootstrap_inner\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\Python36\\\\lib\\\\threading.py\", line 864, in run\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\twisted\\\\_threads\\\\_threadworker.py\", line 46, in work\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\twisted\\\\_threads\\\\_team.py\", line 190, in doWork\\n    \\n--- <exception caught here> ---\\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\twisted\\\\python\\\\threadpool.py\", line 250, in inContext\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\twisted\\\\python\\\\threadpool.py\", line 266, in <lambda>\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\twisted\\\\python\\\\context.py\", line 122, in callWithContext\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\twisted\\\\python\\\\context.py\", line 85, in callWithContext\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\golem\\\\ethereum\\\\paymentprocessor.py\", line 412, in _run\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\golem\\\\ethereum\\\\paymentprocessor.py\", line 109, in is_synchronized\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\golem\\\\ethereum\\\\paymentprocessor.py\", line 92, in check\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\golem\\\\ethereum\\\\client.py\", line 41, in get_peer_count\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\web3\\\\utils\\\\functional.py\", line 14, in inner\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\web3\\\\net.py\", line 24, in peerCount\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\web3\\\\providers\\\\manager.py\", line 44, in request_blocking\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\web3\\\\providers\\\\rpc.py\", line 52, in make_request\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\web3\\\\utils\\\\compat\\\\compat_requests.py\", line 21, in make_post_request\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\requests\\\\sessions.py\", line 535, in post\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\requests\\\\sessions.py\", line 488, in request\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\requests\\\\sessions.py\", line 609, in send\\n    \\n  File \"C:\\\\BuildbotWorker\\\\buildpackage_windows\\\\build\\\\.venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\requests\\\\adapters.py\", line 487, in send\\n    \\nrequests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host=\\'94.23.57.58\\', port=55555): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by NewConnectionError(\\'<requests.packages.urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x000002789B1B8898>: Failed to establish a new connection: [WinError 10065] Der Host war bei einem Socketvorgang nicht erreichbar\\',))\\n'\nResource-manager:\n2018-02-03 16:03:31 ERROR    golem.resources                     b'Resource handshake error ('6620431515d236653c02e9d95ef480162e1b3c3ad05b35251751d247f5b085c777b468940cbe8aba5244b29369bfc37983a0dc7e57deaeb6ad2817420527fd88'): <twisted.python.failure.Failure requests.exceptions.HTTPError: [Failure instance: Traceback (failure with no frames): <class 'twisted.web._newclient.ResponseNeverReceived'>: [<twisted.python.failure.Failure twisted.internet.error.ConnectionDone: Connection was closed cleanly: Connection done.>]\nThere should also be one for task-related connections.. I would propose to reduce the level of the complicated messages with UUID's and stack traces to debug level and replace them with ELI5 info messages. I vote the setup we currently have but then stateless. 1 proxy per 1 geth server seems overkill to me, also the ssl certificate must be on many more places.. Turns out this router does not support the IGD standard of upnp and is not found because of that.. P.S. When will we move this to the other repo? I would prefer to merge it there.. Merging here can not be released ( deployed ) until we move to the other repo, since there are pending changes there too. I'm fine with that.. The main problem we saw when using the plugins is assets are missing when loading the .blend file in golem.\nThese assets are auto-generated by the plugin, maybe we can export them in a plain .blend file all together.. @badb should i change the target branch of this PR to b0.12.0?. We can make a repo for the master python script for public to use.\nBuildbot roles are quite case specific now, we can make them into galaxy roles once they get better and share them with the public this way.\nWas this what you meant or am i missing a part?. Please look at the test results, there are some tests still calling the function with a public key https://buildbot.golem.network/buildbot/#/builders/6/builds/1005/steps/5/logs/run_tests. test_paymentskeeper.py no longer exists.. Thanks! good we have the upgrade to 3.6 ready to be released this week :D. Could you attach the logs of the other node in the private network? there might be a related error there. Thank you for the logs!\nIndeed not much in the logs around this time, there is a warning 7 minutes later, seems un-related.. are there any related errors in the logs during this process?. Tested this locally on 0.12.0 and it seems to work properly.\nI noted there are no info logs at all surrounding these steps, will try to add info for starting / stoping and running benchmarks. My first investigation showed windows defender was locking the file. Tried excluding the file but this did not solve the issue.. triggered appveyor rebuild, lets see what the build thinks of this ;). Shame it did not become MegaIntegerField or GigaIntegerField ;). Thank you for the fix!\nAppveyor has a time / assertion error, is this related or should we just rebuild?. Hey @kascheri12 \nThank you for the report!\nWe recently upgraded all python versions to 3.6, on mac this was already default but on ubuntu the default is 3.5. Could you try this again with python3.6 ?. setuptools is part of python3.6-dev can you try installing that package too?\nI also recommend to try python3.6-venv, it helps to not run golem as sudo. @badb Updated the page with both errors and the solutions.. Circle gives an error:\nCould not find a version that satisfies the requirement eth-abi==0.4.4 (from -r requirements.txt (line 21)) (from versions: 0.5.0, 1.0.0b0, 1.0.0b1)\nNo matching distribution found for eth-abi==0.4.4 (from -r requirements.txt (line 21))\nRest looks good, will approve when the test are running :). Hey @kascheri12 \nThank you for the clear report!\nLooking at the version you are running on develop currently we are working on b0.12.0 for the next release, the release branch contains some fixes not on develop yet.\nCould you try switching to this branch?\nFrom your logs i see hyperg is not able to connect, this indicates there might be a connection problem, could you check the hyperg logs on kascheri12 for connection attempts to kascheri12/201 to confirm the proper port ( 3283 ) is used?\n. I think this is related to: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1633\nAfter recovery the images need to be checked and pulled again.. Not sure if this is still used, but its also here:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/c2c20539ed048a8fbafebd14000352bb073df097/tests/apps/blender/resources/stdout.log_for_test. Strange! maybe its not used at all, @badb do you know if this file is still needed?. Grabbed a log from re-starting my node after upgrading this morning, only mwu-mac shows up as its public IP, none of the nodes are in golemcli network show\ngolem.log\n. @mfranciszkiewicz applied a patch to solve this in a recent PR to the release branch\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2236/files#diff-b9f07081bef4581763153e7f1f60fdf8R28\nPlease double check if its working on all OS'es after the release is merged back. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/b0.12.0/golem/task/taskkeeper.py#L49. Needs testing with different versions of vc_redistributable ( 2015 and 2017 )\nCan not be merged before b0.12.0 is merged and this is rebased to reduce conflicts. https://buildbot.golem.network/buildbot/#/buildrequests/13604?redirect_to_build=true. Build a latest greatest package here:\nhttps://buildbot.golem.network/buildbot/#/builders/1/builds/1348\nThis can now be tested on:\n- Clean windows ( should install vc_redis )\n- Windows with Golem 0.15.0 ( should not install vc_redis )\n- Clean windows with vc_redis 2012 . ( should install vc_redis )\n- Clean windows with vc_redis 2015( should not install vc_redis )\n- Clean windows with vc_redis 2017 ( should not? install vc_redis )\n. I hope this is resolved with the linked PR, please re-open if not the case and i'll investigate. ahhh, TIL, thanks :). Whoops, commented on electron, will repeat it here since its more applicable here:\nWe could use the --nomonitor golemapp argument for this, currently by default data is send to the monitor.. @badb @Wiezzel @shadeofblue just pushed a second location for catching keyerror, please check again!. updated to b0.13.0 commit has not changed.. @Wiezzel looks like an awesome fix, maybe we can make an issue to do this cleanup after this busy month. https://circleci.com/gh/golemfactory/golem/8759?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link. Ran some tests and it seems to work now, please review again!. @mfranciszkiewicz @badb fixed coverage too, should be good now.. Made a guide on the wiki: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/wiki/How-to-freeze-pip-modules. I suspect this has something to do with the data-dir being used in an old version, 0.13.0+dev12 or before. Merge was already in progress, closing this pr to continue on b0.13.0_to_develop. ~some of this info is available at golemcli tasks stats but i agree with you there could be more detailed info for better debugging~\nI was wrong, the issue is as \"requester\", in that case golemcli tasks show can show only the % of completed tasks, and remaining tasks seems broken #2272 . Can you upload the .blend file or .zip used?\nIs this the latest version from the docker demo site?. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/develop/scripts/pyinstaller/hooks/hook-golem.py\nYou can copy the line from the release-version file, it is included in the same way.. Sorry for merging so quickly, a PR was blocked by this.\nGood idea for next steps, will add them if i get back to this code again :). Hey @S1W \nCould you run these commands to check if the VM is created properly?\nIts best to turn off golem before the commands.\ndocker-machine ls\nThis will show the status of the VM. When it has errors or warnings you can try a restart with:\ndocker-machine restart golem\nAfter this command succeeded it should show no more errors in docker-machine ls then you can try to start golem again.. Related wiki page: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/wiki/How-to-freeze-pip-modules\n@etam replied to your review, please check. Branch got too old, creating a new one with the same steps executed, hoping to be merged before the next freeze\nSorry for the reviews!. Hi @GMDays \nThank you for the interest to contribute :)\n@Wiezzel was working on this, looks like it is already part of the branch 1622_...\nLets check with him before picking up this issue!\n. From #2352  I noticed it is as 'None' during tcpnetwork transport:\n2018-03-13 14:04:25 DEBUG    golem.network.transport.tcpnetwork  SafeProtocol._load_message(): received <Hello...\n...\n'prv_addr': 'None',\n.... Turned out UPNP was the problem this time...\nLeft some logs and added the dates in this test only.\nHope the next time dummy tests failures are easier to spot :)\n@mfranciszkiewicz @tworec please review again!. See one small bug in the unit tests: \n```\nself = \n    def _run(self):\n        if self._sci.is_synchronized() and \\\n                self.get_ether_from_faucet() and \\\n                self.get_gnt_from_faucet():\n        if time.time() - self._last_balance_log > 60:\n            log.info(\"ETH: %r, GNT: %r, GNTB: %r\",\n\n\n                   self.__eth_balance / denoms.ether,\n                     self.__gnt_balance / denoms.ether,\n                     self.__gntb_balance / denoms.ether)\n\nE               TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'NoneType' and 'int'\n```. Hey @douglaslimaxx \n\nThey are there so our pyinstaller will see all folders. This is the process of making the source code into runnable binaries.\nA more detailed answer and links to the docs can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/44287914. The desktop icons and main installer icons have been updated to the latest versions.\nI think this can be merged separately and then look at next improvements in a follow up issue.\nOther possible locations to split mainnet are:\n- Start menu\n- Taskbar\n- Start menu tiles\n- Application folder ( in program files )\nOther locations to improve the images are:\n- Windows start menu tiles\n- Smaller icons without subtitle\nCurrent state:\n\n\n\n. Rebuild appveyor. All icons are updated to latest version, last commit was just a image repace.\nResult:\n\n@jamuszyn Could you please check and approve?.

Also when shutting down the node:\nINFO     [twisted                            ] Main loop terminated. \nSentry is attempting to send 55870 pending error messages\nWaiting up to 10 seconds\nPress Ctrl-C to quit\ni hit ctrl + C to not send any more spam.

Great! thank you for sharing the info here again!\nWill close the issue for now, please dont hesitate to re-open or make another one if you have any more issues :). Hey @JonasBrendt,\nThis means the docker installation does not work on your OS from the golem script.\nI recommend to install docker-ce manually and then run the ./install.sh again.\n. There are some checks before golem closes, please wait a bit and golem should close automatically after the first X.\nCould you check or share your logs? after the first X it should show \"Shutting down...\". hey @noconstruct \nCould you try uninstalling Golem, docker and virtualbox from the control pannel > add or remove programs?\nWhen this does not work could you make a screenshot of the error?\nWhen all 3 are uninstalled you should be able to install virtualbox and make it work again. @etam i skipped the -test and -lint since they are not part of the build, do you think they should be frozen too?. @etam done, builds also seem fixed :D. six and pyelleptic fixed in the new commit. @etam please check again, all errors are solved from my side :D. hi @cyberminotaure,\nSince the last release (0.15.0) we no longer supply binaries compatible with OSX 10.11, since they are build on 10.12\nYou can try running it from source or building binaries on 10.11, it should work, but it is no longer officially supported.. The GNT address is the same as the ETH address, from CLI this is less clear then from the GUI. Hey @qanon1111 \nbe careful changing trust settings, with wrong configuration you might never pick up any tasks.\nCurrently the network has a lot of providers and not so much requestors, it can take a while before you pick up any task.\nDid you confirm your ports are forwarded correctly? when nodes are connected and ports forwarded you are ready to compute :D\nI'm not sure what promise you refer to, please read the risks involved with participating in this BETA: https://golem.network/documentation/02-risks/\nWhen you have any more questions feel free to re-open this ticket or create a new one.. @etam Exactly my surprise, this might be caused by the merge back of 0.15.1\nat least its fixed ( and tested ) again now :D. @Elfoniok Thanks for the feedback!\n\n\nI'm not sure what you mean with this, the original issue title was: \"Finish important tasks in the background after closing Golem\". This PR does that, it disables using golem and closes automatically when all important tasks are finished. The GUI can be closed after the shutdown bit is set.\n\n\nYes, this has been considered and is possible to hook in there eventually. For the first implementation we decided to not hook here to reduce impact and first see how this works.. POC -> MVP -> enforce on each user. All tests have been added!\n\n\n@Krigpl @Elfoniok @jiivan Please check again: removed WIP, fixed some comments and added all tests.. This issue has been resolved by #3031. @harvipan this issue already had 2 open pull requests, so it is already in progress.\nYou can try other issues with the label up-for-grabs. Hey @ThomIves !\nThere are 2 answers to your question:\n- Enable Upnp on your router ( needs to match Upnp type in golem )\n- Configure ports manually on your golem nodes\nTo configure the ports on your golem nodes:\n- update 2 ports for golem\n- update 1 port for hyperg\nfor golem update the start_port setting in the ./.local/share/golem/default/mainnet/app_cfg.ini file to the first port you want to use. It is recommended to increment the start_port between nodes in steps of 2 since golem uses 2 ports.\nthen we need to start hyperg on a new port. grab the arguments from a running golem setup with ps -aux | grep hyperg. Then replace or append the argument --port 3283 ( this is the default 3282 + 1 ). it will look something like: hyperg -d ~/.local/share/golem/... --port 3283. Run this in a separate terminal and keep it open while running golem.\nAfter saving the config for golem and running hyperg with the right port you are ready to start golem and it will connect on the new ports.\nOnly some port forwarding left and you are ready to compute!\nPlease let me know if you have any more questions about this, you can also tag me under the same username on the golem chat :). Hi Thom,\nWhen it is not working for you the issue is indeed not closed yet :)\nFrom the raw output you send here i can extract the command you should run for hyperg on another port:\nOriginal = port 3282\nhyperg --db /home/thom/.local/share/golem/default/mainnet/hyperg --logfile /home/thom/.local/share/golem/default/mainnet/logs/hyperg.log\nUpdated port = 3283\nhyperg --db /home/thom/.local/share/golem/default/mainnet/hyperg --logfile /home/thom/.local/share/golem/default/mainnet/logs/hyperg.log --port 3283\nLet me know if this works for you!. Resolved in b0.16.0. I just merged a fix for this: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2839\nThe info logs inside node look much nicer, maybe you can merge those to develop for the next release?. Hey @james-allein \nThank you for your contribution!\nUnfortunately this is a duplicate of PR #2857 can be closed if the other PR gets merged.. #2857 has been merged, I will close this duplicate.. Ok, please let me know if you want another round of review :). The build queue got too long when we implemented this. The fast vs slow tests resolves this partially by running shorter builds when there are no approvals ( and the PR could not be merged anyway )\nI do not see how this is detrimental to the task flow, when a PR is approved in the grace period ( 1m ) after its made it will build slow right away.\nCould you provide a scenario where this is hurting your task flow? i'm happy to help look into ways of solving this :). Yes, all tests marked slow are only run after approvals. \nTests not marked are run both times.\nSplitting the tests, never running duplicates sounds like a great idea!\nThe challenge is to combine the coverage of all 6 tests, but this is certainly possible :D \nThis will also increase the amount of \"status\" checks on each PR, but i feel that is worth it.. Hey @testitem \nThank you for reporting this issue!\nYes, this is normal, after the task is added to your list your node will ask for a subtask to start computing. When all subtasks have been given out you will receive a NoMoreSubtasks message back. Your node will try all active tasks in its list once in a while.\nCurrently there are more providers then requestors in the network so this will happen a lot, once there are more providers this error should be less common but still nothing to worry about.\nClosing this issue now, feel free to re-open it when you have any more questions.\nYou can also join our chat at chat.golem.network and get answers live, you can tag me on the same username if you like.. --loglevel is for crossbar and --log-level is for golem\ncrossbar levels are lower case and with warn\ngolem levels are capitals and with WARNING\nall other levels have the same names, just other capitals\nif i remember correctly only warn and error should show from crossbar inside the golem logs, as WARNING and ERROR, this can be toggled with the setting for 3rd party logs\nnot sure if this is related to this issue, hope it helps clarify the arguments :). hmm, in that case we could split it up in 2 issues, since tests.golem.docker would also be better off using TestDirFixture.\nI'll make a new issue for the old ML poc cleanup: #2962 Could you add the files there?. Thanks for the update and the link, updated the title and the description. What are the problems you are having?\ni'm happy to help the assignee :). Other resources that can assist this research:\n- https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1077.md\n- https://safe.gnosis.io/ \n  - https://gnosis-safe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/services/relay.html\n- https://medium.com/@austin_48503/ethereum-meta-transactions-90ccf0859e84\n- https://github.com/status-im/contracts/blob/73-economic-abstraction/contracts/identity/IdentityGasRelay.sol\n. Found that the stable release notes contain links to fixed versions. Updated the link to the latest current version that is used in my tests:\n18.06.0-ce-win72. @igor replied :) did you apply the change?\n@mfranciszkiewicz i think the py-ext rust lib can be part of the golem code-base, and the plain rust libraries should be published as crate.. This depends, i had in mind they would also be used in for example Unlimited.\nWhen those libs are only used in golem i fully agree with you. > Separate repos only make sense when there's absolute need for them\nAgreed, i thought there was a need, but if concent and unlimited join the repo there is none indeed.\nLets keep them together for now and split when we see a good reason to. Replaced by #3241 . @Wiezzel Added the line as requested :). Thanks for the approvals!\nupdated target branch to develop, then this PR, will test 1 more time before merging. Tests succeeded! @mfranciszkiewicz @Wiezzel please check the last commit again. Please note clay team is working on docker for windows, this will switch the hypervisor from VirtualBox to HyperV\nNot sure if it applies to this issue, just FYI :). @Wiezzel when using logs % is the best way, because it will format only when the level is active.\nFor this one i'll change to f'' strings, agree this will look neater.. This already got fixed :). @Krigpl Thanks for the comments, it makes the PR a lot cleaner!\nWill keep this in mind when fighting more civilised languages ;)\nCould you please have another look?. @mplebanski re-build the hook_pr so it would try again, the timeout seems like a bug in one of the tests.\nWhen you get an approval the control_build should trigger too :). @mplebanski Is the reply for both the log and the optional cli feedback?\nI think the log would be nice to add now, and leave the additional feedback for the other PR. When testing this branch i noticed scipy is still installed:\n(.venv) \u279c  golem git:(remove_scipy_dep) \u2717 pip freeze | grep scipy\nscipy==1.1.0\nchecking the pip dependency tree it shows:\npyssim==0.4\n...\n  - scipy [required: Any, installed: 1.1.0]\nThis change does not make much sense if we still keep the dependency indirectly, pyssim is only used in 1 place, maybe this can also be moved to the verification docker image an removed here.. Maybe this PR can continue after #3382 is merged. Merged in #3401. @Wiezzel good catch!\nfound the group is created when windows is installed, so i think we can remove this block.. \nUpdated without the create block . ^\nCurrently nothing happens when the add fails, should we fail the installer?. Sounds reasonable :) updated the script to fail if the check does not complete the second time:\n\n. Resolved in #3353 no longer need for a quick-fix. When building the quick-fix i noticed a targeted catch can only be done with the -D flag on docker-machine, otherwise the error is not logged. Found that using the swap file is not an option in hype-v, since it does not bind second level memory.\nhttp://www.aidanfinn.com/?p=15659. Found dynamic memory is an option to set in the library we use: os_win\nWrote a small POC and it works for us, the only thing i noticed is that MemoryData.Limit is not exposed in a public function, so extended the class with it.\nMy solution to this research is to use dynamic memory. We can build the next task on my POC.. @Wiezzel was thinking the same, but after i looked at the rendertask one it shows multiple results\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3345/files#diff-0eb7ac38825687120c20b4fd70f9008bL205\n. @Wiezzel i did not see that those 2 where related, then the loop can be ignored.. @Wiezzel Thanks for the comments!\n\nI think it would be better to override VMUtils.get_vm_summary_info() to include an additional field in the result instead of introducing a new public method.\n\nIn the underlying library the vm_summary_info does not contain this data, that is why i opted to make a new function to get the vm_memory_data.\nI think this also makes it easier to merge back to the upstream os_win library. ( https://github.com/openstack/os-win/compare/master...maaktweluit:master )\n\nMake sure to update HyperVHypervisor._parse_create_params() as well to have dynamic memory enabled and configured when creating the VM.\n\nThis was where i started, but these arguments are not available. The machine is always created with static minimum of 1GB, so i think this is OK.. Good one! fixed :). @Wiezzel no, the second commit also fixes the verification on a real task. @mfranciszkiewicz @Krigpl resolved your comments, please check again :). Updated the second fix with checks and exit on failure.. @Wiezzel Good one! updated :). P.S. This will collide with #3426 would update this PR asap after the other one is merged. @Wiezzel yes, will have a look!. I have logged the os_info after it is serialised and see enough info to get the version:\nINFO     [golem.monitor.model.nodemetadatamodel] OS_INFO '{\"type\": \"OSInfo\", \"obj\": {\"platform\": \"darwin\", \"system\": \"Darwin\", \"release\": \"18.0.0\", \"version\": \"Darwin Kernel Version 18.0.0: Wed Aug 22 20:13:40 PDT 2018; root:xnu-4903.201.2~1/RELEASE_X86_64\", \"windows_edition\": null, \"linux_distribution\": null}}'\n18.0.0 == mojave\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system). Solves a part of #3476. Maybe caused by #3368 ?. @Wiezzel sure!\n\nReverted dynamic memory, it brought more edge cases then it solved\nCatch errors on start_vm and try to start the VM with the minimum constrains\n. @Wiezzel updated description, does this answer your question?. good one, done. Hi @Hiturunk \n\nThank you for the report!\nThe registry is checked for the version here: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/develop/Installer/Installer_Win/Golem.aip#L685\nCould you check your registry and share the value of HKLM\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\14.0\\VC\\Runtimes\\x64\\Version?\nWhat version of C++ redistributable do you have installed? we have seen before it does not always work with newer versions, but installing 2 side by side solved that.. Thank you for the info!\nIt seems the screenshot is missing from your last comment,  could you send it again? you can also email it to maaktweluit@golem.network\nWinNTVersions are all the versions that are not supported, we only support windows server 2016 x64 and windows 10 x64.\n\nThe x86 redistributable works fine instead of the REQUIRED x64 distributable in those lines.\n\nI think this could be the key, it only checks and allows x64 vcredis 2015.\nDid you also tests requesting and providing based on the x32 vcredis install?\nCould you install the vcredis.exe ( out of the extracted installer ) manually and send me the errors it gives? when golem installs it all these screens and warnings are hidden. Thanks for the data, this helps a lot!\nThe logs show you already have vc 2017 x64 installed:\n[26A8:1C14][2018-12-21T08:02:03]i108: Detected compatible package: vcRuntimeMinimum_x64, provider: Microsoft.VS.VC_RuntimeMinimumVSU_amd64,v14, installed: {03EBF679-E886-38AD-8E70-28658449F7F9}, version: 14.14.26429, chained: {0D3E9E15-DE7A-300B-96F1-B4AF12B96488}\nThis is why the installation of vc 2015 x64 fails\nDouble checked some things and it looks like:\n- 32bit and 64bit should work side by side (source)\n- vc 2015 and vc 2017 should share the same registry values (source)\nCould you try to re-install a fresh downloaded version of vc 2017 x64?\nThen please check if the registry is updated accordingly.. @Wiezzel tested this and it seems the share is not created at all on boot.\nGolem only calls apply_config from node.py, while update_config (called later from client.py and friends) creates the share.\nThink you found a new bug, should i try to fix it in this PR or make a new issue?. @Wiezzel after some more tests the -WindowStyle does not affect the prompt, it still appeared even if the console is hidden. Etam is correct, ci_skip is still used on buildbots to skip tests on mac and windows.\nOnly the old function ( and ENV ) names where kept, they can be renamed to clean it up. @Wiezzel both comments are resolved, could you check again?. @JulianMaurin that is correct, currently GPU is only supported on Linux. @Wiezzel good one! \ntested 0.18.x and 0.19.0 so will test a clean install and a manual setup and add this to the docs :). Tested clean install and manual setup\nMade the version argument optional so the docs can remain the same.. Thank you for the reply!\nWaiting long should not break the test, hard coding was wrong, thank you for the golden tip to fix it.\nPushed these changes and it is building again.. Fully agree, we can fix this in #1365. good thought!\nwas thinking here the taskcollector should be a single binary installation\nI can fix it if you want, but would propose to leave it.. fixed 3x. nope, but would love to find out.\nLooked it up and seems like List[_pytest.Item] from source\nDo you know an easy reference for looking types up?\nAlso i see currently the list is without capital, does this matter for python typing?. thanks for the tip, replaced it super easily.. Thanks for the great tips!\nUpdated it and it seems to work when running and linting it.. any reason for extended whitespace?. order differs from below, makes it harder to check what properties are checked and not.. property not tested below?. -i inventory/ could be defaulted in setup.cfg\nNot really more clear when its only one configuration, but when it grows it can help a lot.. throws an error on my machine, think its fine in python2 but python3 requires an extra o, like 0o644. any reason for nice json? if only machines read it it saves a few bytes by not being nice. Very minor.. good to know, will switch it this weekend with the new spawns :). When TODO is fixed will update this back.. else after a single if ending in  return doest not add anything. TODO's are in the OP\nthere is a link to PR 1301 that describes the error on ubuntu server 16.04 . got different errors when hyperg was not in path and when not running.\nWill test next time without starting hyperg manually and let you know what tests fail if any.. not sure, will test without and get the errors.\nthis can also be moved to the setup of the buildbot-worker user if it is required.. the latest stable, i think...\nshould we use a specific version?. the test failed when hyperg and ipfs are not running, took them from circle.yml.\nBuildbot does not support & background commands, so had to solve it with a start and stop script.. At the end of the test this will kill the daemons started before the tests.\nThis is a not water tight cleanup, but better then nothing.\nWill investigate if ipfs and hyperg can be started by the tests alone and remove these 2 scripts if possible.. the test need it to run, copied from circle.yml. \nits started from scripts/test-daemon-start.sh and called from test_factory(). When trying again after failure should this be an error or warning?. from what i've read elsewhere it picks the public port when the private port is not set. i'm not 100% sure it is also the case here.. Ran some tests and there are a lot of tests skipping when the daemons are not running:\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/test_client.py:281: IPFS metadata is currently disabled\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/task/dummy/test_runner_script.py:26: It doesn't work, using new dummy task instead\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/task/dummy/test_runner_script.py:89: It doesn't work, using new dummy task instead\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/resource/ipfs/test_ipfs_resourcemanager.py:51: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/network/ipfs/test_ipfs_daemon_manager.py:146: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/task/dummy/test_runner_script.py:13: It doesn't work, using new dummy task instead\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/task/dummy/test_dummy_task.py:16: It doesn't work, using new dummy task instead\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/network/ipfs/test_ipfs_daemon_manager.py:86: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/network/ipfs/test_ipfs_daemon_manager.py:96: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/resource/ipfs/test_ipfs_resourcemanager.py:73: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/resource/ipfs/test_ipfs_resourcemanager.py:62: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/task/dummy/test_runner_script.py:60: It doesn't work, using new dummy task instead\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/network/ipfs/test_ipfs_daemon_manager.py:34: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/network/ipfs/test_ipfs_client.py:32: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/resource/ipfs/test_ipfs_resourcemanager.py:44: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] golem/resource/base/resourcetest.py:124: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/network/ipfs/test_ipfs_daemon_manager.py:23: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/network/ipfs/test_ipfs_client.py:88: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/task/dummy/test_runner_script.py:73: It doesn't work, using new dummy task instead\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/network/ipfs/test_ipfs_client.py:52: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/network/ipfs/test_ipfs_client.py:38: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/network/ipfs/test_ipfs_daemon_manager.py:47: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/network/ipfs/test_ipfs_daemon_manager.py:104: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/core/test_hostaddress.py:95: Find network testing framework\nSKIP [1] golem/resource/base/resourcetest.py:124: Hyperdrive daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/network/ipfs/test_ipfs_client.py:72: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/network/ipfs/test_ipfs_client.py:79: IPFS daemon isn't running\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/task/dummy/test_runner_script.py:43: It doesn't work, using new dummy task instead\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/task/dummy/test_dummy_task.py:10: It doesn't work, using new dummy task instead\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/task/dummy/test_runner_script.py:80: It doesn't work, using new dummy task instead\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/task/dummy/test_dummy_task.py:21: It doesn't work, using new dummy task instead\nSKIP [1] tests/golem/network/ipfs/test_ipfs_daemon_manager.py:16: IPFS daemon isn't running\nI propose to keep it as is for this PR and make a follow up issue to let the tests start the daemon's them selves.. See logs and proposed solve in the other reply.. See logs and proposed solve in the other reply.. See logs and proposed solve in the other reply.. fully agree!\nAlso I can not \"break\" it again by removing it from the code. Will remove it for now and clean it up, next fresh install might give problems, in that case it belongs to proper user setup, every user should have LANG defined on ubuntu ( but we should warn the user if they do-not ). node_num is required to increment the port, it ensures unique hyperg:port instances can run at the same time.\nI see it is not passed on line 195, but the arguments seem lower then 5 there, so it will not trigger this elif.\nWhat would be your proposed solution?\n- Add node_num to 195?\n- Remove the need for node_num, solving the ports differently\n- .... ( anything i could not think of? )\n. comment out of date, will fix it when node_num is sorted. Nice, thanks for the clear answer!\nWill try keeping changes to a minimum if possible, remember errors about hyperg ports but they could be from elsewhere.. reverted the 2 files back, the first computing tests now fails without clear error in the logs:\nRemember digging in and finding an error on ports somewhere, will try to find it again.\nWhere should it pick the ports automatically? maybe i can add some logging there to confirm.\n```\nE       AssertionError: 'Computation timed out' not found in 'Node exit\ned with return code 0'\ntests/golem/task/dummy/test_dummy_task.py:14: AssertionError\n------------------------ Captured stdout call -------------------------\n[REQUESTOR 10011] Starting in /var/folders/sy/873ntd415m53f3n9h86dchlh0\n000gn/T/golem_dummy_simulation_jvp9dgf0/requestor\n2017-09-17 22:28:57.600 [HyperG] [INFO] HyperG [0.2.1]\n2017-09-17 22:28:57.602 [HyperG] [INFO] TCP listening on 0.0.0.0:3282\n[REQUESTOR 10011] Started in 4.0 s\n[REQUESTOR 10011] Listening on 192.168.1.10:40102\n[COMPUTER  10047] Starting in /var/folders/sy/873ntd415m53f3n9h86dchlh0\n000gn/T/golem_dummy_simulation_jvp9dgf0/computer1\n[COMPUTER  10046] Starting in /var/folders/sy/873ntd415m53f3n9h86dchlh0\n000gn/T/golem_dummy_simulation_jvp9dgf0/computer0\n2017-09-17 22:28:59.529 [HyperG] [INFO] Sharing 0cc599822f0c0301c97429f\na0b880b720bf3d56c8934f181132a2d52974a1e28\n[COMPUTER  10046] Started in 2.2 s\n[COMPUTER  10046] Connecting to requesting node at 192.168.1.10:40102 .\n..\n[COMPUTER  10047] Started in 2.2 s\n[COMPUTER  10047] Connecting to requesting node at 192.168.1.10:40102 .\n..\nStopping nodes...\n------------------------ Captured stderr call -------------------------\ncreate HyperG logsdir: /var/folders/sy/873ntd415m53f3n9h86dchlh0000gn/T\n/golem_dummy_simulation_jvp9dgf0/requestor/logs\nUnhandled error in Deferred:\ncreate HyperG logsdir: /var/folders/sy/873ntd415m53f3n9h86dchlh0000gn/T\n/golem_dummy_simulation_jvp9dgf0/computer1/logs\ncreate HyperG logsdir: /var/folders/sy/873ntd415m53f3n9h86dchlh0000gn/T\n/golem_dummy_simulation_jvp9dgf0/computer0/logs\n``. tried a few of the options:\n- Hyperg already running ( this is also the case on CI ) did not make any difference\n- Sleep before spawning computers, beginning offor`, did not make a difference\nWill go back to the working version for me, propose to make follow up issues for the proposed improvements.\nShould I do anything with the node_num on line 195?

Samples in #1571 . Is this problem also on macs? in that case we should also add a similar block there.\nI can help test on mac if you have none available.. Maybe catch a more specific exception if possible?. Ok, will test it next week when back from holiday :) This is already a great addition to help the end users.. Discussed with @mfranciszkiewicz and we can use the public source too:\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20221/pywin32-221.win-amd64-py3.6.exe\nwget works for me ( must follow redirects ). unused var :(. This was taken from the devp2p branch, will check if the called function will handle it well and update it. was taken from devp2p, will remove if it was only needed there. Will do! though the interface will change a bit i've seen.. i'll give it a shot!. done. done. done. maybe name these variables for clarity. wrong continuation, should match with (. Why is this file removed?. maybe use the semantic_version module instead of the bespoke _machine_version to compare the versions.. too little indent. line looks too long. semantic_version.next_*() can do this more easily. maybe update to unittest.mock now this file is touched.. for what arguments is *_ present?. is the severity of this error so low it should be debug?. assert_called_once() might be more readable, but same. thanks for the info! my CI might break now in this :). nope, no longer needed, but removed in #1620 ( also up for review and merge :) ). i think linters do not use it at all, the light is green on the PR so \"assumed\" it was good like this.. great one! forgot about it, will try it right away!. will try this, its only to start the service after configuring, maybe the name alone is enough. fully agree, will generate a password and store it in the local secret file.. i do not know, this string comes from buildbot_worker_service.exe so hopefully it can start the service without, making it less error prone on changes. will test it. also logged exception thrown here, please check again. this still needed too?. good one! updated it :). pylint errors when trying to sort them alphabetically, leaving as is for now to keep the alphabetical per list.. swapped all if's top facilitate this, good one!. pylint does not allow classes with only one public function, maybe we can add reset_counter() and make this a public attr?. Solved :D. Good thought! Made #1664 to align it with the linters running on shippable.. why does this have a getter when public_key is a public attribute?. same q as above. maybe use the native logger formatter, this way the string will not be calculated if the level is off.\nlogger.debug(\"%r\", value). Good one! commented tasks in the main issue, will update this with the removal of python2 and IPFS. #1400 . Reset branch back now its merged. travis.yml got updated, update here too. cleanup old comment. done. TODO: release before merge?. initial requirement was to return None instead of empty string.\nDoes this work like javascript and do that?. nice addition!. what is the future default value of enabled?\nIn case of true it might be easier to clean up if you switch the default.. I think adding a delay is more likely then adding a custom URL, maybe you can switch the order to make it callable without None url. any reason to not import on top of the file?. call time.time() 2x quickly in a row, when it was one more a variable would be preferred. this looks like the req is added to self._queued twice, or am i reading something wrong?. maybe this can assert the MockClient got called. should the default be true in that case so its better prepared for the future?. is this required to run the app normally? think the only one that should stay is in -test.txt. Moved log message to after the config is applied, good catch!. Indeed, removed it and everything seems to still work :). Can the # noqa be removed now the line is properly split?. Should optional arguments be always last?. should this be info or debug? does it have use to read for end user too or only for development?. how bad is this? maybe upgrade to warning?. Also please use native logger formatters logger.info('message: %r', variable)\n.format() is a bad practice since it will always parse the string, while the native logger ignores parsing when the level is turned off. should this tests assert some things, like for instance mock called?. More tests in this file have the same question. FYI, the PEP8 mix in is in progress of being replaced with mandatory linter tests on CI #1664 . is task_id enough to investigate?\nif not maybe a list of files in a debug log next to it would be helpful. nice cleanup!. is still still the default status now its gone here?. Log not consistent with other info's in the class, Task %s restarting.\nSuper small, can be ignored.... is it worth noting the difference between ConnectionError and HTTPError in the logged message?. looks like a raw method to ensure file, is there a native function for that?. maybe this can be added to the log.error messages? \nFor example: No conection for the top one, no resource_hash for the bottom one\nIt would help finding a problem in this region when it occurs\n. Would be nice to add a comment why its fixed\nMaybe you can link the issue to upgrade the package, is that made?. Yes, even when its started by another user it worked. It was only not able to kill at the end.\nThis check is in there so when a user ( or disconnect ) stopped the build it wont break the next time.\nLooking at it now it might be better to kill and re-start in this case to be safer, will put it on the list of improvements as follow up issue.. Added it as possible improvement to #1754. good catch! I thought it would be created in \"working dir\" will check and change if required :). Checked on the worker and it looks like the working-dir is used, so no change needed.. is this flag still used elsewhere? if all change to True it can become default behaviour. looks like the mock is re-used without reset\nI think the count should be 2 or the mock should be reset before the second test.. maybe now can be used here. here now can also be used, unless the previous if can take a long time.. Can we use GitPython module for calling git like the old implementation?\nIf not we can delete it from requirements, i think.. I see it is already removed, nice!\nNvm this comment, approved!. why is the default ?????. does this comment still belong here?. why remove the standard __name__ here? . # noqa can be removed now the line is no longer too long.. Never knew there was an Ansible set of PEP001 rules as well, awesome!\nSince it is already running and in production i do not feel safe adding this and running it again. Durning installation there where some problems with become: yes, though mostly on mac and windows.\n. on mac this does not work as intended, maybe we have to re-configure become-method.\nPropose to investigate this when splitting up the roles.. Tried to keep everything without \"\" if it would still run, is that not a good practice?. using \\n in the logs was a bad practice at my old work.\nThis was so the log harvest software could not parse them natively when multiline.\nNot sure if that is also the case here, maybe if we want to harvest logs later down the line.\nWill approve on reply!. When trying to fix this i found there is a bug in ANSIBLE0017: https://github.com/willthames/ansible-lint/issues/215\nin site-linux-worker.yml become is set for the full role.. replied above. replied above. Yes, think it is best.\nWe should find a solve for both mac and linux separately before enabling this check.. missing .Id after $HyperdriveProcess. Good catch! it was used for getting the version, will double check\n. You are right, not used at all anymore, will remove it.. Good one, fixed :). unittest.TestCase is now imported alone and as whole package. what is the added value of the iter? \nlooks like this also can be hyperdrive_ports[0]. should we check if we received ports or will the manager handle this error?. Thank you, clear :). Thank you, i agree :). Removing the merge of the base_branch will give false positives some times when the PR branch is not updated to develop properly.. TIL... :D\nIn this case we only need it on buildbot since its not as cool as shippable :). should it break the second loop when it found what it was looking for?\nOr do you only want the last message result?. @jiivan had some down-sides on using time, please double check if this is correct.. break loop when found?. would log this as an info warning, debug logs are not visible by default.\nyou can ignore this comment if an unknown OP has no affect for the end user. Please use unittest.mock from the stdlib, mock is deprecated since we upgraded to python3. unittest.mock. thank you for the explanation\nin that case why do we loop?\nmsg = st.messages[-1] should also get the last message. same as above. the linter only complains on changed lines: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/develop/lintdiff.sh#L115\nthough i like every single linter please :). This makes the singe item fetch a lot less feasible.\nStill think the loop is not optimal, but its nice and readable.\nSince we had some questions about it maybe a comment would help our future self. Free disk space should be stored as fact. Isnt this handled by default? then you only need to compare\nAlso only python fails now, i would add an assert and exit the whole role.. what is the added value of this test? when collecting the facts it will fail if no connection is available.. i mean it should be already stored as fact.\n- debug: var=item.mount\n  with_items:\n  - \"{{ ansible_mounts }}\". Why skip python when there is not enough free disk space?\nWould prefer an assert at the top that fails based on default facts.. This change makes the name fields inconsistent.. AFAIK ansible will not connect without winrm.\nIf i am wrong and this is required i think it belongs in the playbook, it has nothing to do with buildbot-worker.. no need to set it, it should already been set by ansible while gathering initial facts. I'm OK with keeping it.\nThough then I opt for putting it in the playbook, it has nothing to do with the role buildbot-worker.. all fields used to be consistent, not a big deal but nice to keep in one way everywhere.. Should this message also be renamed to something like \"removing tables\"?. The name of the logger and the file do not match, why not __name__?. this can use the new constants you added too. We can add a todo / fixme / comment this can be removed when 0.2.4 is deprecated due to lacking version api. Now this logger no longer only applies to the version maybe we can change it to __name__?. logger is more popular in golem. i think this variable was only used for this purpose, could be removed now too. is there any difference between ending in / or not?. Would it be possible to use int's here? i remember an issue before this should be preferred.. Can this be enabled again after the errors have passed? this will protect the rest of the file of errors. Is it safe to remove the self._error here?. the version number is not semver ;P. password, the R is missing\nPlease dont fix this :P. This could be useful in many more places, maybe it can live in golem.core.common or similar. Maybe add a comment on why ordering is supposed to work to fix later?. i think @staticmethod is better then disable pylint. please use logger arguments over formatting wih %\n. msg_part can be used in the exception log as well. Good one!\nI'm not sure, this change did not matter in the end so reverted it, thanks!. would move this up 1 line to keep the comment and the os.env... together. Changed it to 15 minutes timeout and the message to 10m, managing expectations here :). was this moved in this PR? dont see it added. Looks like a del is missing somewhere?. To match the easy_install'ed hard-coded version in the build. To change this version a buildbot release is required.\nAlso want to reduce the scope of this issue by keeping the versions as close to the 0.14.0 release as possible.. Good one!\nThis is not meant to be merged, this was required to find what component is blocking\nChanged title to WIP, will ping you when its ready for review again. Yep, the one and only...\nHopefully the rest makes it easier to find next time. This comment seems incorrect, not is missing?. would be nice to call this before use_upnp to remove that manual check there, i guess this is not possible due to the need of upnp info. I think a similar line should also be added to the pyinstaller hooks to bundle this new file in the binaries. Thanks TIL :D. whow, i fully agree with you.\nWanted to match settings chosen in electron:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem-electron/blob/039cc0a8e95bf7a3b5c1fd7676cebb842fb9ddaa/src/components/onboarding/steps/Register.js#L143\nWill check if this was thought of yet and update ( both if needed ) accordingly. all versions will be locked in #2448 \nCurrently ( before freeze ) we only lock versions when it breaks.. its not in pypi as Crypto... remember this was a problem last time too, will check that branch, i fixed it there :). good catch! done. Made issue with this comment, so we can round off this PR :) #2679. Good idea! Does need some testing / UX love, so made an issue #2678. no more need for updating the ETH balance?. I liked the val[len(x):] more then a string replace, not sure what is more efficient / readable. I agree this looks fishy, but from all options this was picked as the best approach to this problem. I'm open to alternatives to this setting\nNo, it wont even work as expected when the users sets it before running golem, this setting is only set after golem is running. ( by gui or rpc )\nPlease read the description of the PR at least, i tried to make all steps / changes clear to get to a graceful shutdown.\nThe reason this was chosen is that config_desc is available in all places where the in_shutdown should work, and update_config handles updated from all sides properly. . this would make the file inconsistent, all settings are set in this way\nWhat is the added value / clarity you see on removing only this line?. clear! thanks for the explanation!\nWill update this :). Should one ( or both ) of these checks be >= to allow withdraw of the full balance?. what operations is still in progress?. This log line is now duplicated ( benchmarkmanager.py ), maybe \"requesting benchmark\" followed by \"running benchmark\"?. Then it should be fine, i see the old code was >= and in the new version it changed to >. looking at it more closely it is indeed the same:\nold = gnt >= amt = success\nnew = amt > gnt = failure\ngreat this has been simplified now ;). Agree with the end-user message, but not sure if all of our future selves will find this easily\nMaybe a comment for the unfortunate dev that has to debug this later would be nice.. Good idea!\nWill check this when we add this feature to the GUI, then either the settings can be adjusted directly from there or we have to make an explicit call like you propose. great catch!. good one! fixed :). added. changed it to _try_shutdown() does that make it protected enough? ;). good catch! find and replaced them all. Why do we need the # type: ignore?. this could be calculated once as f.i. refresh_time and used for both last_update values. These values could be stored in a shared variable for easy updates later on.\nThey could even link to the constants in SCI, any reason you did not?. clear, thanks :D. haha, not very much.. but every computation saved helps\nto use blocks for this sounds better for sure, will approve!. Fixed!. Fixed!. The name of the #noqa rule (instead of number ) would be more readable here, is that possible like with pylint: disable?. wildcard args would make this more future proof, only not so nice when using msg.. up to you, nit comment... This could use golem.testutils.TestDirFixture ( maybe this needs the tests to be ran as pytest ). nit: space missing between and and \\. Should this log something ( like insufficient ETH ) in the else?. Nope, there are no official guidelines on this.\nPersonally i prefer a space before it when possible for clarity, this matches how we add spaces around = and operators.\nI think that \"it would make the lines 80+ chars\" is a good reason not to add it.. does it matter here if the str( cast is before or after the slice [2:]?. awesome! even better :D. is the name price here clear enough or would subtask_price be better?. maybe the magic numbers can be replaced with task.*?. Are you sure the mod should be 0.0?\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/daf6d0223db7270835d55b196ccf40d84140afee/golem/ranking/helper/trust.py#L43\nI think its better to remove the second param, but i only..\n\n. i think it is a perf_index value, used by all query_extra_data functions.\nIn this case it is strange since this function expects a extra_data dict object.\nLooking back at the history this was added 11 months ago by Jacek or inext. with a comment to query the data inside.\ni have followed the comment/fixme and moved the query inside the blenderrender class.\nWe can use the FIXME issue to continue this fix for the other renderers\n. i think this would be better as a warning, something went wrong and it will retry so its fine. Twisted is not able to serialise Enum, it does for IntEnum. Where is the ETH unlocked in this function?. Where is the ETH locked in this function?. Repeated magic numbers, maybe they can have a common source?. same here, isnt it better to use denoms.ether?. ahhh, now i see, its all there :D. thanks! ditto. How is this related to the checksum in the public address?. Super clear! thank you for the explanation!. since the order has already changed maybe its better to put the deprecated argument last?. nice first step on this issue :)\nso until #2670 is fully fixed node_id should be optional?. what is warnings.warn over logger.warning?. i think its neater to add an extra space at the end: ) \\\nLinter does not enforce this so can leave it :). Thank you for the explanation! super clear and handy. it is better to use multiple arguments when logging, less formatting when the level is disabled. nice cleanup!. we should put this on our python registry, else it will break on a freeze. Good catch, done!. added. Kept that as it was, but was thinking the same\nShould we fix that?. Nice one! will clean it up. like it! moved to a private function. fixed. is this update related to the cleanup? else a separate PR would be nice\nShould be released before merge. where will taskthread work now there is no chdir?. should have checked the linked PR, is related :). haha, almost useless still :P\nyes, that would work\ni also see a tmp_path variable available, maybe that is a good working dir to chdir to?. is there a difference between stderr and stdout on windows?\nif so i think stderr is better to log as error, maybe stdout as debug. Memory limit instead of CPU set?. this update should also be in the non frozen version. i see, sorry then, did not see it change. This is the default behaviour of the Advanced Installer UI.\nPropose to remove it in part 2, since those OS'es are blocked in another setting in the installer config. recipients_count = self._payment_processor.recipients_count\nwould make the rest of the checks more readable. nit: its more like call_each_each() but not sure if that makes it more clear ;). think we will also need something like drain_x, getting x items from the pool\nCan be added later when it will be used. haha, indeed.. i'm fine keeping it as is :). when the network is big enough to fill the pool within the timeout a get_n would be nice\nfor now we can leave it time based and add it when we need it.. Will have a look if i can split it up, if it takes too much time i'll make an issue to fix this later. Looked at it and do not see an easy split, most of them are testing RPC methods..\nshall i make a separate issue to look into this or leave as is, there are many more tests that need cleanup like this.. What do these files have to do with marketplace / rust?. Why the double underscore? \ni think we should stick to rust naming conventions an not disable them.. Since the capacity of the vec is already known you could make it:\n``\nlet mut offers = Vec::with_capacity(pyoffers.len(py));. I thoughtcommon.to_unicode()was only needed for python2, or is this something peewee related?.NotEnoughFunds` is now imported twice\nMaybe it is good to keep the imports consistent to make them easier to manage. ok, sounds good for the py-ext part of the lib.\nlets keep the plain rust libs clean and 100% rust standards :). because the node_id passed to this function is a Mock object.\nNow i think about it i could also set a random node_id, would that be better?. will this be re-tried? else the gntb is locked for ever.. When picking the value i looked at other around, they are ABC and DEF, this is why i picked a since it meant just as much.\nI like making it more clear, so updated it to your proposal :) . please use arguments for formatting logs, when the level is disabled the formatting does not need to happen.. formatting. no new line at end of file. i recently added that self.command logs the output as debug, this line is now duplicate. you left an unused import here. good one!\nIn this case i'm not sure if we want to show the arguments or the price. Since its a debug log i think the first, so propose to leave it as is.. Haha, i was thinking about both options, could not choose so left as is :D\nWill try to remove this default, if it breaks tests a lot i will make it a common CONST somewhere. No, without testnet or mainnet it will not be shared\nbut, cls.root_dir will include rinkeby so this will be.. good one! will pick this up in a new PR. is there a reason you did not use self.is_computing() here?. the check for is_computing() is removed here, was that on purpose?. Looking at it again it is even more like self.is_computing() now, why is this thread safe over calling the function?. Thank you!. maybe this can be a warn or error, to be consistent with the comp_started() error.. unused function?. can agree with that\nbut it would be better to call it exactly enough. did you mean counting_thread?\nshould this use self.lock then as well?. 30 seconds interval sounds a bit long, on mainnet you get a lot of offers in the first few seconds. any reason why the import is not at the top of the file?. sounds good, let me know when to check again!. now it import os and from os import path, maybe those 2 lines can be joined to make it cleaner?. nice one! missed that in my PR!. maybe keep the failure case for better coverage?. this message could include ...provider=%r', node_name_id) . what python magic is this? it looks like there is an assignment missing ( or knowledge on my side ). typo, colledted  => collected. mock is not matching type, not sure if that matters: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]. why do you need redefine-outer-name?. maybe _platform would be a better solve then?. i like the solve a lot more then my proposal! \ud83d\udc4d . _OPS could be moved to https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/4d236bf460461f801ddf6166ee133f66652c8ad3/golem/task/taskstate.py#L179 as is_completed(). should this use a lock to ensure only one thread can update it at the same time?. I think op.subtask_related() is nicer then isinnstance(...). hmm, not sure if my previous comment about is_completed in _OPS is still applicable after this change.. sad but true :). Done!. This line is not needed because it is already in lib.rs. maybe we can lock all the funds available? the user should not be allowed create a bigger \"lock depth\". Good one! resolved by adding async to the async logs. maybe keep this assert for the new property node_id?. Is this also no longer needed? Is the issue closed?. my question was: \"Why is this removed\"\nNow i see its moved.. /shy\nNo questions remain ;)\n. should this also be renamed to ActionTimer.start()?. same q as above. maybe debug the function signature at each call of this function to be consistent with the other logs.. Good one, will look into this!. I think you are right.. i need to move this code to \"start_vm\" so will adopt it accordingly to this case.. agree, will fix it or make an issue out of it :). good one! will move it up.\nThought it was nice to only make this 128 rule inside windows. i am not sure.\ni think some machines might be able to dynamicaly change \"GuestVisibleMemory\". so for them OS-win works now.\nFor our docker it does not update after start, once set to 1GB it stays 1GB, so we need this to be as high as we can.\nos-win people are super nice, so will make an issue when this branch is working again. done. stopped the VM while building config for now, open to better solves :). done. nice idea! move it up now, will move like you proposed once it works. good idea!. Now it is, first try! ;). good one! fixed. good one! fixed. good one! fixed. %.6f formatter is removed, was this meant?. I removed line 31 here because it was a duplicate of the one inside create:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/epic/docker-for-windows/golem/docker/hypervisor/docker_machine.py#L51\nDoes this cover your question?. ok, will do!. Updated, please check. - for mac we do not control the VM, so there this will never help\n- for virtualbox/toolbox i'm not sure if it is needed, afaik when create fails it can be run again without rm. i'll make an issue to confirm this with toolbox, it is a good idea to check :). Should this also use the same const WORK_DIR as in the file above?. i think the name is a bit inconsistent, execute for ssh\nany reason behind this?. As discussed we will add a message to the GUI when this warning is triggered, this way the user is informed and can update its settings or close RAM hungry apps. Indeed!\nWant to add it now or make a follow up issue to start using this?. Ok i understand now but still do not agree\nlooking at the list only ls is replaced by list. the rest is named as the docker-machine command.\nfor docker excec i think execute would be a good name, but this is docker-machine ssh\nNitty comment so can leave it, what you perfer :). Ok, made the issue. I think the most reasonable name is the one consistent with the underlying command, not the one we subjectively think is more applicable. this can be done first, so it is only done once\nempty_..() will not change the VM configuration so 1x is enough. is this meant to be no longer done on build_config?. This is the default option, so it could be removed too, both is fine for me. Since host_shutdown_action action is now save_state, maybe we do not have to manually save it.\nI think it is worth to test the difference to make sure. makes total sense!\nok, then this is the way to go. fully agree\nand since start_vm is called after build_config the free check is still done\nresolved. golem.hardware is now imported \"twice\", maybe we can use on or the other?. i think the @patch decorator is neater here then with patch. good one, did not see that..\ncan only think of patching HyperVHypervisor._check_memory, but i am not sure if that works. good one, will look into this. there is already a function in the same file called publish_event this one is more log_and_publish_event\ndo you think that is a better name?. Will dropping the session here change the list of all_sessions? Think it was 2 loops for this reason. nice! ok, approving :D. Nitty comment:\nMaybe the formatted values can be at the end of the line.. ",
    "Wolf480pl": "Should I expose this information by RPC, or is a public method on taskkeeper enough?. @maaktweluit dunno. AFAIK this information is passed around but still not exposed anywhere. Ask @badb whether actually using the information somewhere is part of the issue.. You mean task_timeout argument to __compute_task(), which is calculated from subtask deadline, or do you mean task deadline from task header?. @maaktweluit AFAIK yes.. For a subtask restart:\nLooks like the subtask is being set to restarted unless it was already a failure, in which case it stays a failure.\nThe task is always set to computing.\nDidn't check exactly, but it looks like a restarted or failed subtask will not be sent to a provider again, instead a new subtask will be created. Is that the case?. From the UI side, it looks like you can always restart a subtask, no matter what state it's in. (In QT you also see the old subtask in state \"Restarted\" even though there's new subtask for this part of image, you can't restart the old subtask agian, but you can restart the new one. From CLI you can restart the old \"Restarted\" subtask, it may cause a bug, I'm not sure).\nThe preview goes red, but doesn't refresh (so you can see it only if you switch the preview to another task and back), and then when another provider starts the subtask it gets green (and does refresh).\n. Apparently, the provider who got the subtask before restart can still subimt the result and get paid for it. This is compatible with @lukasz-glen's analysis. The computation agreement between the provider and requestor is not affected.\nThis might be a problem from UX point of view. The user should be aware that he's paying for each subtask restart.. Do we want a limit per requestor public key? What if someone has many public keys?. As for priorities, I think it requires some consideration from security point of view.\nI asked @paulperegud and he had some ideas, but he's not sure for which protocol version this is for.\n@badb is it for gossip or broadcast?. @paulperegud which ones should I drop? oldest? newest? cheapest? random?. A task header doesn't even have a creation time, so I guess it'd be by receive time.. If we drop a task because we reached the limit, do we want to trigger the post-removal cooldown (the thing that prevents the task from being re-added too quickly) ?. AFAIK this issue reduces to ethereum/pydevp2p#58 cause I don't see pyelliptic used anywhere in golem code.. cryptography doesn't call (or provide a way to call) OpenSSL's check_key :(. I have no idea why the test is failing - it worked ok locally.. Each of these is enough to trigger the segfault:\npython -m pytest tests/apps/core/gui/controller/test_newtaskdialogcustomizer.py tests/golem/interface/test_cli.py\npython -m pytest -v tests/apps/core/gui/controller/test_newtaskdialogcustomizer.py tests/golem/interface/test_cli.py -k 'test_execute_interactive or test_customizer'. Adding import readline to test_newtaskdialogcustomizer.py right after customizer._show_add_resource_dialog() causes it to segfault without test_cli.py, with just one test: test_customizer.. Happens when you QDialog.open() and then import readline without importing readline before. Quick workaround: add import readline at the beginning of test_newtaskdialogcustomizer.py.. Minimal script reproducing the segfault:\n```\nfrom PyQt5.QtWidgets import QDialog, QMainWindow, QApplication\napp = QApplication([])\nwindow = QMainWindow()\nQDialog(window).open()\nimport readline\n```. @gborowik is it better now?. @gborowik I added some tests. @nickwilliamsnewby sure, go ahead, but if it's not done until monday, we'll have to do it ourselves.. This was for backwards compat, in case I miss some places that still expect bool.\nAlso, I think it's kinda convenient and Pythonish, similarly to how you check for empty collections.. I made them not-enum on purpose, so that apps can easily define their own reasons.. What should I use as dict keys: enum members, or their string values?. Not sure if it's in scope of this issue. Ok, will keep it for now.. No, because it's not reached yet.\nBoth deadlines are (most likely) in the future.\nThe thing is, a subtask, which is part of a bigger task, should be finished before the big task is finished.\nIf the deadlines say eg. \"yeah, you still have 10 hours to do this subtask\" but the parent task's deadline is in 2 hours, then something is wrong.. Really? I thought % was legacy/deprecated.. Is this method user anywhere?\nIs there any other place where you are adding stuff to self._tasks?. Is this called only from dead code?. Even in tests?. Even in tests?. At least tests don't fail silently.. Oh, the requestor adds its own address in get_for_task and sends the list to the provider. So it always pulls from requestor. Ok.. mmk. Why? What did that poor (object) do wrong, @marmistrz ..... Explicit is better than implicit. Explicit is better than implicit, so IMO class Foo(object): is better.\nAlso, this is not quite equivalent, so I think it's better not to change it.",

Merging #1879 to b0.10.1 and then merging b0.10.1 to develop.

Possibly related to: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/issues/70#issuecomment-357284438. @maaktweluit please remember to change help text for --loglevel also.. @Krigpl good point. Fixed. We only have to watch the length limit of taskid/subtask id which is set to 128:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/blob/5886a932990932b4680911c95a7ddc2d753b3181/golem_messages/message/tasks.py#L45:L55. @etam Agree. Even better to pass Traceback object.. @maaktweluit this branch has develop merged to itself, conflicts solved, and lints removed.. Duplicate of #1970 . @tworec I've been using 3.6 since golem switching from py2 to py3. Only issues that i've experienced were related to maintaining compatibility with 3.5\nThe full bumping means updating all CI to use python 3.6.. @tworec Could you confirm wether failed Shippable test is unrelated to your changes?. closed by #2136 . In your solution we could just change protocol and put [[task, owner_sig], ...] instead of task_id.\nNested messages list solution could be clarified to let owner generate RemoveTask message and only send it nested (possibly with other RemoveTask messages he got form other nodes in a container message. Thus receiving end would only have one type of message to handle.\nIt also has a bonus of:\n 1. RemoveTask.timestamp acts as kind of a nonce, making it hard to run a replay attack (when task_id duplicates)\n 1. Timestamp can be verified against task generation time.\n 1. RemoveTask.sig out of the box. depends on #2228 . closed by #2631 . Necessity of manual addition of node in each subtask query would introduce a huge possibility for bugs. Also some dicts would be less readable i.e. subtask2taskmapping etc.\nIn my opinion just making subtask_id globally unique is the solution. If we use something like <node_id>:<uuid1> than we would only need to verify <node_id> when TaskToCompute is received.. 1. Both subtask_id and task_id should be unique. Also check resource id?\n1. Check code for uuid4. Replace it with <node_id><uuid1>\n1. Separator is not necessary. W can assume prefix has fixed lengh (len(node_id))\n1. Verifying logic should be placed in golem-messages to avoid code duplication in concent\n1. Places to look:\n   1. golem_messages.message.tasks.TaskToCompute (ComputeTaskDef) (subtask)\n   1. golem.task.taskkeeper.TaskKeeper.add_task_header ?\n   1. golem_messages.message.p2p.Tasks (tasks list). @Krigpl uuid4 is simple random and thus is not unique (even on one node). Even though the probability is very small why not cut it down to zero with a prefix (node_id) and timestamp (uuid1) to avoid problems?\nuuid1 should be unique as long as we won't generate more than 1 id per 100 nanoseconds.\nThe downside of uuid1 is that it exposes MAC address and generators clock. It can be circumvented partially by using <node_id><timestamp><uuid4>. Then only clock will be exposed.. Could it be related to #109 ?. Queue should be implemented as separate sqlite3 database (separated from golem.db).\nPossible schema implementation could look like this:\nsql\nCREATE TABLE queue (\n node_id text not null primary key,\n task_id text,\n subtask_id text,\n msg_type int,\n -- pickled slots tuple\n msg_slots blob, \n)\nAlternative approach would be to store msg blob instead of msg_type int and msg_slots blob. With whole message blob approach we would have to remember to reset message timestamp (and signature), because timestamp should reflect actual sending time and not the time of queue insertion.\nAPI proposal:\n```python\ndef put(node_id: receivers uuid, task_id: uuid, subtask_id: uuid, msg_type: int, msg_slots: tuple) -> None:\n    # ...\ndef get(node_id: receivers uuid, task_id: uuid, subtask_id: uuid) -> Iterator[golem_messages.message.base.Message]:\n    \"\"\"Returns iterator of messages.\n        Can be used by an established TaskSession between ourselves and node_id\n        to know what messages should be sent.\"\"\"\n    # ...\ndef waiting() -> Iterator[tuple(node_id, task_id, subtask_id)]:\n    \"\"\"Returns iterator of (node_id, task_id, subtask_id) that has pending messages.\n        Can be used by TaskServer to know which nodes it should connect to.\n    \"\"\"\n    # ....

Not relevant. related to: #2223 . Will wait for https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/pull/170 to make calls to history provider.. There are two places to look at:\n1. golem.network.concent.client.ConcentClientService(enabled). Comment in code suggests that it should be removed but actually it shouldn't. It should be controlled by a commandline switch (something like --disable-concent and --enable-concent)\n   1. It's invoked here: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/6a943f4a08c33890513cf1cbb7e0241892db09e9/golem/client.py#L133-L136\n1. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/6a943f4a08c33890513cf1cbb7e0241892db09e9/golem/task/tasksession.py#L462-L464\nThe conclusion is that for now there is no system parameter that can be used in stats. All nodes have ConcentClientService disabled, but they announce (in TaskToCompute.concent_enabled) that concent is active.. Status of concent can be fetched from enabled property of ConcentClientService which is instantiated in golem/client.py :\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/9768f23bdbf3e7d27946fa43eef3fbc284cef3a6/golem/network/concent/client.py#L190-L192.

It could probably be started on demand via https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#processpoolexecutor. If this issue is resolved, #3331 won't happen again.. Currently this issue is relevant for golem.task.rpc.ClientProvider.create_task. enqueue_new_task always takes task as parameter.. In favor of #2648 . Already solved. Already done in:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/2aa5d432594227aeba1c6302eba9a76f0096e431/golem/task/tasksession.py#L702-L719. > G 6.3\n\nProvider gets new subtask to compute\nThis existing use case. This description regards only its interaction with contracts.\nAfter Provider receives TaskToCompute but before he starts to compute, Provider checks if Concent flag in TaskToCompute is set properly and then he checks Requestor\u2019s wallet and deposit. If Concent flag in TaskToCompute is not set properly, then Provider cancels computation by sending CannotComputeTask. Provider checks if Requestor\u2019s GNTW balance is at least (total task price). If Concent is enabled, then Provider checks if Requestor\u2019s deposit is at least 2*(total task price). If it is not then Provider cancels computation by sending CannotComputeTask.\nRelations: G 6.3.1, G 6.3.2\nG 6.3.1\nProvider checks Requestor\u2019s deposit\nInput: required value, Requestor\u2019s Etherum address\nThis simple function checks if deposit of the given Ethereum address is not less than the required value.

Subtask verification is started only when task session is established TaskServer._add_pending_request(TASK_CONN_TYPES['task_verification_result'], ...) -> TaskSession.result_received()\n1. If any of callbacks fails (pulling package cbk upon ReportComputedTask receival, verification cbks started in .results_received), no message will be sent to provider. What about renaming calls from _blockchain_sleep() to blockchain_sleep()?. T/Y. Fixed that.. log.exception is a convenience method that appends current traceback to LogError, so there is no need to manually reinvent this if this is what you meant.. Actually the main point of this change is to avoid string formatting unless it's necessary. After this change, formatting will occur only for LOG_INFO and below.. Sure. Done it.. Isn't this var (pub_key) just overwritten in a while loop and then right after it?. Is this necessary? If it is, then maybe .reset_mock()?. Altough it's just a helper test function may I suggest the following:\n\n\nUse just one flag ip_v6, because it's either ipv4 or ipv6 and there can't be both. ipv4 can be default.\nUse this flag to determine first argument of socket.inet_pton\nremove c&p code. Thank you. Fixed that. Is it really necessary?. unittest's assert methods cover vast amount of checks. And it's probably better to be consistent than using assert statements for boolean checks and unittest methods for more complicated cases.. Do you prefer\nself.__sync = False\nself.__temp_sync = self.sync\n\nI disagree with that. In this case I prefer more concise version.\nBut I have to write that I really don't like private variables. I don't see positives and they just kill inheritance.. Since private/protected are alien concepts in python (private just means magic name mangling) I suggest using plain names without any underscore prefix in most cases.\nad coding rules I propose using zen of python import this and most rules from PEP-8. There are many tools to help, and can even be included in a test to assure some level of code quality. By tools I mean pyflakes, pep8, pylint.. Thank you - fixed that.. Maybe fd.seek(0) instead of double opening? And if you're already changing this I think it's a good idea to correct misleading fd var name to f. Because it's not a file descriptor <int> (see: https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.fileno ) but a file object.. For me if engine not in (\"BLENDER_RENDER\", \"CYCLES\"): is more readable.. I prefer to leave function as soon as I know I should. It also leads to less nested code which IMO is more readable.. Hmm. I called this channel/signal p2p because the whole communication starts when p2p listening is established (listening event here https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/826/files/5226328020083a8cad7f7a169e159de7e2922471#diff-e07e1d9df038df866cf07c237db623eeR98 ) and unreachable event is kind of a reply to this. Isn't it all related to p2p subsystem?. I suppose it wll always be the same class, so maybe do:\npython\nclass BlenderRenderTask(...):\n    VERIFICATOR_CLASS = BlenderVerificator. I propose the same solution as in Blender class with class attribute/const.. why use __ name mangling?. Can this be moved to RenderingTask or even better CoreTask?. advance*d*_verification?. Maybe property.setter instead of javaish setter method?. callback. Thank you for pointing out all the debugs left in code.. It's probably safe to remove it. Will remove on error.. I suppose on-chain integration will require a whole new interface. I really don't like the idea of putting binary blobs into relational DBs. IMHO pickles will work for Brass.. Whitespace before **kwargs.. Those two lines are removed in #872 (can safe remove lines 144-145).. Formatting log message in this way work like this:\n 1. Calculate \"BlockHash: {}; BlockNumber: {}\".format(l['blockHash'], l['blockNumber'])\n 1. (simplified) decide wether to emit this log\nIt can (and IMO should be) optimized to this form:\n`log.debug(\"BlockHash: %r; BlockNumber: %r\", l['blockHash'], l['blockNumber'])\nWhat this invocation does is:\n 1. Decide wether log record should emitted\n 1. Only if it should it will perform string formatting. I'm not sure about this. Anyway this file will be overwritten in next dump().. :heavy_check_mark:. :heavy_check_mark:. :heavy_check_mark:. Uncomment/remove?. Maybe use absolute values here?. measured. Isn't it called before by unittest?. May I suggest a rewrite of this method? I really feel this is overuse of OO programming. :) IMO:\n * No need to use instance attributes here - never used outside of this method. Simple vars would be more readable (without self.)\n * No need to use classmethod. A simple lambda or inner function would do. Yet in this context I would use a Mock()\n * No need for _error() method. It's ideal case for a Mock(). At first I though exc here was abbreviation of exception not execution. Maybe get_time_spent() or get_execution_time() would be clearer?. The same goes for exc_time argument passed to success callbacks. Maybe execution_time or time_spent? Or exec_time if you prefer abbreviated name?. https://medium.com/@kentcdodds/please-don-t-commit-commented-out-code-53d0b5b26d5f :). :scissors: . Maybe check wether [mocked] .add_task_header() have been called?. Could it be a problem if this loop runs forever? Maybe limit number of iterations to smth high like 1000?. Some asserts here?. Thank you :). Actually new messages will be introduced in second PR. Here the refactoring doesn't change the external representation of Msg.. PEP8 recommends something between 72 and 100 characters. I personally disagree with those limits. I feel that all moderately modern workstations are able to properly display any line length (with or without wrapping). That's why I disabled line length checks in style checker.\nAnd this diff shows why I feel single lines are easier to maintain. When I added message namespace I just didn't want to go ascii arting with aligned indentation. That's why I quickly joined all lines. This won't be a problem with simple hanging indents though.\nBut I'm flexible in this matter. If most of you agree with line length restrictions I will enable them.. Yes.

I know that .format() is consistent with the rest of the project, but logging lib is not ready for it. :)\nhttps://gist.github.com/jiivan/eedb505574ccb2503af48fa2e3043036. golem/client.py:14:81: E501 line too long (88 > 80 characters). golem/client.py:225:81: E501 line too long (99 > 80 characters). golem/client.py:229:81: E501 line too long (90 > 80 characters). golem/client.py:246:81: E501 line too long (84 > 80 characters). golem/client.py:250:81: E501 line too long (86 > 80 characters). and so on....

Hopefully it won't happen, but IMHO it's an easy check, worth adding.. I don't but it doesn't matter. logging doesn't support .format() formatting (yet?)\nI explained it here https://gist.github.com/jiivan/eedb505574ccb2503af48fa2e3043036 pls have a look. Isn't it against Zen of Python, namely Explicit is better than implicit.? But I'm no expert in ethereum logic and I'll gladly see what you mean, maybe in another PR?. Why not noop()?. Why not?. should be a project. Maybe lines 68-72 could be moved to config_logging() function?. Any docstring about purpose of this decorator, please? :). I think multiline if will be much more readable than this powerful oneliner. :). unnecessary here. unnecessary here. unnecessary. Hmm. I believe pycryptodome is not a golem requirement. I think it's a requirement of some of the packages already in requirements.. PASSWORD_LENGTH - missing \"t\". Why triple underscore?\nTo me this method looks unrelated to this Class (it doesn't use any of class functionality). For this kind of code I suggest making module level functions instead.. Probably it won't change much, but is it possible to make a single query with something like select count(*) where environment_id__in=benchmarks.keys() and then check if count equals keys length?. While reformatting please also use % substisution.. Maybe something like: \"Subtask deadline reached: \"?. know**n** issue. It is but it's the only substitution that works with python logging library.\nSee: https://gist.github.com/jiivan/eedb505574ccb2503af48fa2e3043036. Oh, now I understand. So maybe: \"Subtask deadline shouldn't be after...\" So it would be more obvious?. Should this go to production?. Why the migration to double underscore instance method? Is it used anywhere outsidesynchronizedmethod?. I think this oneliner method unnecessarily complicates logic. I would prefer usingkeys.privtoaddrdirectly when it's needed.. Is this oneliner method really needed?. ?. line ending. line ending. Maybe breaking after colon (: `) would be more readable?. ?. Result typing here is unnecessary as the __init__() result is ignored in python.. I suggest using percent formatting in logger: https://gist.github.com/jiivan/eedb505574ccb2503af48fa2e3043036. Also consider using exc_info argument of logger or .exception() method.. Why not directly calling while not self.processor.synchronized():?\nIs it possible that code will hang in this loop forever?. Will be good to actually test this overflow with hex encoded field in db. :). :+1: . First of all it's no longer a class but an instance of a class.\nSecondly this will instantiate those classes during definition of TransactionSystem. Therefore every instance of TransactionSystem with default parameters will use the same instances of payments/incomes keepers. Is this intended? It can be misleading.. Is this test no longer needed?. Are you sure this overflow won't occur? If you think this test is no longer needed then please remove it. If not, please uncommment it.. Let me start with a citation from PEP484:\n\nPython will remain a dynamically typed language, and the authors have no desire to ever make type hints mandatory, even by convention.\n\nWith this in mind I think that annotating/typing arguments and methods should only be used when there is confusion or lack of clarity in code, to help developers and linters understand the code. Defining return type of __init__ function is useless, because the None is obvious. Also annotating every argument imho doesn't serve the purpose of readability. For example isn't it obvious that *_callback args are callables? Also comp_failed_warning and comp_success_message use strings defined one line above... The same probably goes for bool args with default boolean values. Does annotating argument with default value False add anything to readability?. I think this a good example where annotating actually adds clarity.. Does the name run() suggest any other return type than None? IMO it should be annotated only when it returns something other than that.. Maybe just importing from golem import appconfig will prevent cluttering of namespace and simplify code?. Maybe choose FileExistsError or OSError?. Unless you change golem.core.common.HandleError.__call__ decorator it won't work. What is the reason of this change?. Unless you change golem.core.common.HandleError.__call__ decorator it won't work. What is the reason of this change?. I suggest refraining from using AssertionError here. It generally should be used with assert statement to indicate a condition that should never occur. Also AssertionErrors are disabled when python runs in optimized mode (see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#debug ).\nMaybe defining custom ProtocolError or just using generic RuntimeError will do?. Fixed. I would change peer_id to node.. ?. maybe return after disconnect(). In this way we can reduce indentation of the remaining of this method.. In this case it has to be ordered sequence (ordering matters). Added check for tuple.. traceback.print_exc(). If TASK_PROTOCOL_ID changes we should bump minor version not patch.. Isn't it enough to just use logger in _handshake_error()?. Isn't it still referenced in golem/task/taskserver.py?. Since python3.3 mock is part of standard library in unittest.mock. We shouldn't use external package.. Why using the double underscore here?. maybe session = MockTaskSession(self.tempdir) and following initialization could be put here in setUp()? It is used in all tests in this TestCase.. Hmm that's very interesting question. :) We don't have definite guidelines for loglevels so it's a very subjective matter. For sure connecting to seed nodes is a crucial step in connecting to p2p network and failure at this point is an important event (possibly prohibiting the node from any meaningful activity).. Yes prv_port can be unknown and this prohibits making TaskSession connection.. assert shouldn't be used outside of testing/debugging code. It won't work in optimized mode. See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#debug. Any docstring here? In what scenario self.pubkey_x and self.pubkey_y returns False?. Yes, possibly after restart we can loose information about prv_port.. For consistency sake should it return None instead of 0 as get_task_count and get_computed_task_count etc?. Windows instances are most problematic in this issue, but I will be glad if you could test it on mac, or have experienced any similar problems (usually on \"fresh\" installs).. Maybe this would be more readable?\npython\nif not tasks:\n    return. I think that moving dispatcher.send inside try and with block is a mistake. File should be closed before dispatching, and try block handles unpickling related errors.. It will also catch '' witch is not desired.. I made sign argument mandatory, as it is always used in golem code. It was omitted only in tests.. Same as above. This test checks messaging not encryption, but arguments are mandatory.. Since you're editing this test: pls use stdlibs unittest.mock.. t.owner_key_id. CommonConfig is unused.. Yes, created this issue: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-electron/issues/156. If you want to change this line, pls also consider removing bad .format() code.  https://gist.github.com/jiivan/eedb505574ccb2503af48fa2e3043036. Isn't the third result now ignored everywhere? self.nat_type. assert_called_once() was added in python3.6 and we still support 3.5 especially in CI.\nSEE: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.assert_called_once. It might work when using external mock module, but that should be avoided IMO.. A tiny remark here. I don't that keeping stdlib and custom libs import separated is necessary. It really doesn't matter, and just keeping them alphabetically sorted is enough.. I have a gut feeling that naming this method send() would let us avoid problems. :). If I may suggest: I prefer handling failed cases in ifs and returning in them, and handling positive logical path afterwards.. Accessors are really not necessary in python. Maybe just use self.is_available attr instead of self._is_available?. __can_call_concent() can easily be public. I think that pylint intention (however this sounds :) ) is to avoid small classes which could be implemented with simple functions. Is this the case here? Well it's worth a second thought.. One last thought (sorry that it's late, just popped in): consider adding golem.testutils.PEP8MixIn.. Maybe leave logging ofnat_type in logger but just don't return it?. Last parameter (nat_type) is removed right?. What if task timeout is greater than CLEAN_TASKS_OLDER_THAN_SECONDS? Maybe it will be better to check against time_finished? It will probably be time_started + time_elapsed if remaining_time == 0? . Seems reasonable. This overwrites os.symlink for all other tests. Better use unittest.mock with side_effect.. unittest.mock with side effect. Simplified form of just calling super().__init__(daemon=True) could be more readable.. If values of this \"enum\" are not important than maybe use object() (or auto() in python3.6) instead of manual series of ints?. Why use a cache in _raw attribute instead of just calling serialize() where it's needed? Is this cache invalidated every time the message contents change?. If this class is only used for ConcentRequest class maybe it would be cleaner to put it's definition inside ConcentRequest and just call it STATUS(Enum)?. Maybe then either pass keys, or serialized message to the call stack?. If it's really needed then passing both is a better idea than introducing cache attribute IMO.. I want to make a release when this PR is accepted, and update requirements before merging.. Because it would stop every other PR related to golem-messages. Please use percent formatting with logger. https://gist.github.com/jiivan/eedb505574ccb2503af48fa2e3043036. Are you sure KeyError always means unsupported image? Maybe some additional checks would prevent covering other errors? Or at least a .debug(\"Detailed information about image saving failure\", exc_info=True)?. Something more elaborate than just a boolean test? :) Since it's 1x1 image.. It just occured to me that it's a great opportunity to write\npython\nP2P_ID = 18\nTASK_ID = P2P_ID\nIt'll be a good first step of #1692 . .keys() is not needed. Iterating over dicts always iterates over its keys.. I just noticed missing parameter filepath in this log.. This method should be split into separate cases i.e.:\n * test_add_files_invalid_paths()\n * test_add_files_empty_resource_hash()\netc.. side_effect can be an exception (class or instance). What's the benefit of _build_raise() method?\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.side_effect. https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.touch. Maybe a hanging comma so further additions won't modify previous lines? Just an aesthetic :). Would it be possible to use string values, to make debugging with external tools easier?. Is this a recipient node or a sender node? I'm confused.. Would it be possible to inherit from golem.core.service.Service?. Why not .select().count()?. Could you put this comment in code?. Yes, I thought that sweep method fits in a core.service structure. Thanks for claryfing. Could you also put this comment in code (maybe class docstring)?. side_effect (also fixes a warning from Shippable). Are you sure you meant a metaclass https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=metaclass#metaclasses ? :)\nA common mixin class may or may not be a good addition though.. May I suggest using a generator instead?\nIt would look smth like this:\n```python\ncurrent_seed = next(self.seeds_round_robin())\ntry:\n   # ...\n   self.connect(...)\nexcept Exception:\n   logger\n   return\nreturn\ndef seeds_round_robin(self):\n    \"\"\"Endlessly yield seeds ensuring every item is yielded in each iteration\"\"\"\n    while True:\n        current_sample = random.sample(...)\n        for seed in current_sample:\n            yield seed\n```\nNo added instance attributes, cleaner (IMHO) logic of connect_to_seeds(). Yeah, you're right. We could also use itertools.chain(), but there is still problem with __sync_seeds() where self.seeds is updated. Maybe we should restart the generator there.. Or... self.seeds could be a custom set that implements randomized iterator AND resets iterator when it's modified.\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset.update\n```python\nclass SampleSet(set):\n    def iter(self):\n        # ...\n    def add()\n    def update()\n   def remove() etc:\n      reset generator\n. @Krigpl `decimal.Decimal` instead of `float`?.python\nif self.running:\n    return\n?.python\nif definition is None:\n    return\n``\nMaybe this is more explicit? Since golem-messagesv1.2.0compute_task_defwill always be an instance ofComputeTaskDef. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/blob/master/golem_messages/message.py#L725. Is thisrawparameter really needed? Maybe it would be better to adjustgolem-messagesto handle it automatically?. :+1: . Moved totearDown(). It resetsMessageHistoryServicestate to it's default state.. Thanks for  pointing this out! It was a mistake.get_syncdoesn't depend oninstance`.. DateTimeField is more customary in DB context: http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/models.html#datetimefield-datefield-and-timefield\nMaybe call it processed_at? So it will be more obvious that it's a time of processing not creation/modification time.. You can use freezegun to test time related cases.. Does this test wether mock works properly? :). :wastebasket: print. freezegun. It seems to me that this test is too low-level. Almost like testing:\na = 1\nassert a == 1. Are you suggesting that human readable time is less readable than an integer/float? ;) By default you can use datetime instance or anything that is parsable by dateutil.. :eye: It's a matter of taste but it doesn't look readable to me.. It's not relevant but I think fixing automatic updater of this const is outside of scope of this PR.. Issue for that: #1824. Verification is done in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/blob/master/golem_messages/message.py#L262. Yes, probably can_be_unsigned code should also be removed from core.\nIn the beginning session.key_id is set to 0 which effectively disables signature verification i golem_messages.load() ( https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/pull/63/files it's version mentioned in requirements )\nAs soon as key_id is set there is no reason to not verify signatures on any message.. Is it a race condition here on self._awaiting?. @Krigpl refactored to return boolean. It comes from: @mock.patch('golem.network.transport.session.BasicSession._react_to_hello'). Without this, disconnect would be called by it (different golem_messages_version). Maybe a set will be enough.\nIt'd also be nice to see a short comment why this was implemented. For a long time POSIX user this is totally unobvious.. ./golem/network/transport/spamprotector.py:36:81: E501 line too long (92 > 80 characters). Why not explicitly use golem_messages.message.SetTaskSession.TYPE?. Unused, just move 20 to FreqDict?\n  . If FreqDict then self.last_msg_*dict* also?\n  . If this is meant to be constant then maybe FREQ_DICT?. Instead of implementing helper _check_msg_type() just ask FreqDict?\npython\nif msg_type not in self.FreqDict:\n    return True\nnow = time.time()\nlast_received = self.last_msg_map.get(msg_type, 0)\ndelta = now - last_received\nif delta > self.FreqDict[msg_type]:\n    self.last_msg_map[msg_type] = now\n    return True\nreturn False\n  . ~~Why?Is your intention to prevent casting to int anything other than str?~~. Could you add a docstring that states explicitly that restarted state means that a task is stopped and duplicate is created?. Maybe also test subtasks? Or test only golem.client here mocking TaskManager.put_task_in_restarted_state() and test put_task_in_restarted_state in place of removed test_restart_task.. python\nprotocol.session.interpret.reset_mock()\nprotocol.session.interpret.assert_called_once_with(msg). s/DROPING/DROPPING/. It's already named and easily referenced by INTERVALS[SetTaskSession.TYPE], why add another label?. Oh, now I see that casting is made with base 16. My bad.. I know it's not your code but since your're touching this you may as well rename message to msg to avoid ocerwriting message namespace from imports.. Thanks for pointing this out, fixed that..

Looks like it will failure() only when last crop failed.. Looks like it will success() only when last crop is successfully rendered. @Krigpl Since python3.3 it's part of stdlib unittest.mock. We should remove dependency on custom mock library completely. I've done it once on devp2p branch.... This change alone is unacceptable as there are packages missing for python3.5 which are custom build in this place.. Could be accepted only temporariliy. Finally this release should be placed on builds.golem.network.. It's a step back. All golem-messages releases are on builds.golem.network.. I'm not sure about that. Concent suggests there is a typo (consent), but it's more widely used as concent now. Changed.. It's hard because tests are not included in golem-messages library. I don't know how to resolve this reasonably now. Also they're really simple straightforward declarative definitions. I think the abuse of DRY here is not big.. done. done. Could work. Created an issue for that https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/issues/117. self.assertEqual(msg_for_history, msg_from_get_task_message)?. This pylint directive should better be placed on a line that it's needed to narrow it's scope. And truly speaking there sure are lot of arguments.... ditto. This is very reasonable warning from pylint, and why disable it for a whole file?\nhttp://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/messages:r0903.

You could use self.new_path  instead of pathlib.Path(self.path). To avoid string substitution and concatenation unless it's needed by current loglevel you could:\n```python\nnot_accepted_message = \"Cannot accept subtask %s for task %s. %s\"\nlog_args = [comp_task_def['subtask_id'], comp_task_def['task_id']]\nif not task.requests > 0:\n    logger.info(not_accepted_message, *log_args, \"Request for this task was not send.\"). Could this be a method of Task? Could be useful in many places.. Is it possible to receive two transactions to the same Income?. Is a check/query needed here to verify that income is awaiting (transaction IS NULL)?. transaction IS NULL?. logger is more popular in golem. Unfortunately they did. There is some risk of confusion, but aren't namespaces the answer to that? :)\nimport this\nThe Zen of Python, by Tim Peters\n[...]\nNamespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!.

But I'm not sure if this should be silenced. Maybe it could be refactored by using partial?. :heart_eyes: . :fearful: . No, no. This is HTTP response header and requires a string.. Good catch of Mr Paste Copy code :). Maybe a factory?\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/35a553576a4d9256ae7bf85a41a9cb2b24120d2f/tests/factories/taskserver.py#L12-L18. message. Logging formatting. yeah, the pitfalls of ascii art indenting a.k.a. aligning with opening delimiter :). values. good catch, moved. Did you mean \"this sentence\"? :P. Maybe you could write a factory? Factory boy + Faker has all the methods for random strings, names etc.\nSee: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/tree/develop/tests/factories. factory.Faker('random_int', min=1 << 20, max=10 << 20)?. factory.Faker('random_int', min=1 << 20, max=10 << 20)?. Yes, this functionality is not used anymore (moved to golem-messages). Can we use header.deadline here? What is the difference between subtask_timeout and deadline? Maybe we should remove one of those field (possibly relative timeout, because we're interested in absolute deadline only). Thanks for clarifying! A comment in code would help a lot.. duplicated pylint directive. After simplifying logic, and adding shortcuts I'm not sure whether the decorator approach is needed or add to readability.. I got your point, but the way I used this factory in tests is to nullify unneeded parts after creation of instance by factory. We could also create custom constructors for different scenarios or even separate factories for them, but in my case this approach worked well (I think).. Maybe just:\npython\nif not <condition>:\n    return\n?. This class should probably implement .as_message() method. (It should know how to create a message from itself). To be consistent with .put() this should return Message iterator. Since in current implementation TaskSession instance is bound to a subtask, is it necessary to have separate PendingSession and PendingMessage? Logically we're interested in sending a pending message, and address:port should be accessible from PeerKeeper.. It's because ._fail(e) handles both true exceptions and sometimes is called explicitly. It's a good candidate for a nice refactoring.. Import ordering. Import ordering. Where is .shut_down() called?. If .start() is moved to setUp() then .shutd_down() should be also moved totearDown(). If we want to change this logic, then it'd be better to use msg.task_to_compute.provider_ethereum_address. @Krigpl did you mean total-lock?. I suggest __qualname__ and standard dict formatting.\n```python\nreturn '{} {}'.format(self.class.qualname, self.dict)\n``. This method  could be a function. It's related to message, not Messagehandler class.. or evenpprint.pformat(self.dict). Are those needed outside of tests?. I think faker is unnecessary here. Wouldn't justcryptography.ECCx(None)be enough?. Is your intention here to not compare signature and header.encoding? If so please add a comment.. Maybe we could useresult['feedback']['suggestions']here?. What I meant is that you could just use.assertEqual(msg1, msg2)becauseeqis implemented inMessageclass.. TaskServer is already overbloated (C: golem/task/taskserver.py:1:0: Too many lines in module (1018/1000) (too-many-lines)) but yes, I'll move it to better place thantask.server.resources..TaskServer.verify_results()is async, but will move for clarity. @shadeofblue  it is in default callback (because it doesn't requireTaskSession):\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/c0ea6b96e25548dfefc703d05559f32e4043573f/golem/task/server/resources.py#L77-L85. It's doable but I think we should also update all calls togolem.task.tasksession.get_task_message()too.  Created an issue #2670. :+1: . hmmm :?. explicit keyword argument would be more resistant to extending method signature in the future. just.serialize()?. Yes.

I treat it as a general assert that there are only 3 possible responses.. because before this change enabled=True meant staging. :). Those are just development artefacts. Thanks for pointing them out. . It'll be used in provider deposits and to verify whether other side has sufficient deposit ( #2766 ). And there no such thing as private method in python. :). Good point.. Since this is only one time migration for old pickles, I would be really pleased with a comment that it's a migration.\n\nAlso maybe it's possible to enclose this migration logic in a function with proper docstring? Something like _migrate_status_to_enum(). @Krigpl isn't it covered by fundslocker?. If Provider asks for Concent, but Requestor cannot comply he responds with ConcentDisabled.. This kind of getter/setter encapsulation is suboptimal in python. You can just rename _gntb_reserved attribute to gntb_reserved. If a need arises you could always make it a property in the future.. Ungrouped imports lint. @shadeofblue yes. I know it's c&p from other regexes, but is re.MULTILINE | re.IGNORECASE really needed here? Especially re.IGNORECASE could slow parsing down significantly.. I'm not sure about toggle here. Explicit shutdown cancelling would be nice.. RCT was fetched from history only because it was historically absent in AckReportComputedTask back in the days.. <FixedHeader: ...>. if 'task_owner' in self_dict:. I think raising exception on validation error and returning None otherwise is more pythonic way.. Why is popping signature required? Could you add some comment?. just max_price. Any docstring here? Especially I would like to know the difference between TaskHeader and TaskFixedHeader. I think it's proper to use .get_nowait(). My proposition:\npython\nlast_sent = 0\nwhile not event.isSet():\n    if time.time() - last_sent < self.monitor_sender_thread_timeout:\n        time.sleep(veryshort)\n        continue\n    try:\n        msg = self.queue.get_nowait()\n    except queue.Empty:\n        msg = self.node_info\n    last_sent = time.time()\n    self.sender.send(msg). max_price is already getattred in lno 351.. @Krigpl AFAIK it's the intention.. Are you sure? Looks like it's an int value in golem_sci:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem-smart-contracts-interface/blob/e53673630f107c3f03c185dc729a971eff71a40e/golem_sci/implementation.py#L536-L537. @Krigpl done.. gotcha. @Krigpl there is no such thing as a \"protected method\" in python. Just sayin' :). I think using the right vocabulary for the tool helps a lot. There is a single underscore convention in python slightly enforced by exclusion of single underscore functions and variables from __all__ (can be overridden). It's also supported by some linters. But there is not such thing as protected method.\nOOP concept of access control is neither supported nor encouraged in python.. It's needed to know whether transaction succeeded or not. See  scripts/concent_integration_tests/force_accept/test_requestor_doesnt_send.py. Done. Better use if msg is None:, because many objects can have False boolean value. As you said it can be a future bug or feature :). Is this intentional?. :-1: . First line should be a summary without a continuation. Please use logging function parameters for string format arguments.\nhttps://gist.github.com/jiivan/eedb505574ccb2503af48fa2e3043036. @Wiezzel That's interesting, I didn't know about that. Maybe that's why linter didn't complain about f string method. Readability is subjective.

On second thought we could generate almost timeouted SRA, pay, and wait till timeout.. Created an issue #2963 for that.. Is this alias method necessary?. Thanks @Krigpl , missed that call. Although it seems clanky that update_...() is called as a side effect of getter method.. IMO they're better for everything that fits into warning categories. They can be nicely controlled by command line arg (-W) and programmatically. It makes it easier to find all occurences of a deprecated call by changing severity to error.. It's outside of scope for this PR. I've created #3055. .keys() is unnecessary. Why, replace elegant namespace import with local namespace pollution?. assertRegex or even .assertRaisesRegex().. rm. rm. IMO it's perfect place for *args, **kwargs. It clearly states that this method is just pass-through for received_batch_transfer and it doesn't modify arguments. Stating arguments explicitly here would reduce legibility as a reader would have to check whether all arguments are passed unchanged.. Good catch! Thanks.. No magic here, but greppable argument sounds valid to me.. Good catch, it was an artefact from when handler interacted with IncomesKeeper.. Thanks, missed that method.. Yes, using proper path looks like a good route to take :). As far as I understand the documentation, it states that provider should reject subtask if requestor has timelock shorter than 48h. @lukasz-glen ?. Now I understand @Krigpl . Removed it completely. :). I also feel that it's a client/frontend responsibility to split & format paths. Backend should just return unique fullpaths.. python\nif warnings:\n    try:\n        return_data[\"warnings\"][\"missing_files\"].extend(warnings[\"missing_files\"})\n    except KeyError:\n        return_data[\"warnings\"] = warnings. ```python\nself.assertIn({'baseName': 'f1.png', 'dirName': 'XXX'}, warnings['missing_files'])\n``. Would this test be necessary if you leftwarningsas set?. Is it possible to use a more specific Exception here?. I vote for a custom exception.. Why not use a namespace?message.ComputeTaskDef. Maybe something likelog_mockinstead ofmockwhich could easily collide withunittest.mock..self.assertIn(...)orself.assertRegex(...).self.assertEqual(...). What will happen when any of previous asserts fails?. Doesverification_finishedcollide with something?. I see. IMO collision with this method is not a problem (verification_finishedvsself.verification_finished). Only the name of internal function ofapps.core.task.coretask.CoreTask.computation_finished()  verification_finishedshould be changed.. It's just [EAFP](https://docs.python.org/3.6/glossary.html#term-eafp). What's wrong with that?. We expecttask_ownerto be adictand act accordingly, but when it raisesTypeErrorit means it's something else and I would like to know what it was i.e. include it inTaskHeaderError`.\nI wanted to have all exceptions raised here to contain at least task_id and node_name. Could use something generic like <unknown> but thought that some actual/related value would be better.. Would it be possible/feasible to decorate schedule_crop_job() with inlineCallbacks and results, time_spent = yield verification_context.computer.start_computation() inside?. #FIXME cleanup. #FIXME cleanup. :scream: Good catch. Added proper tests and fixed.. Not really sure. It returns None for None but str(value) otherwise. I just used the same logic as in get_payments_list().. Good point. I didn't know peewee has default id field.. :+1: . Yes, block_hash and block_number are not displayed anywhere. Do you think they shouldn't be stored?. Done (simplified to strings).. Actually it's not really related to resources. It's just a method that generates WantToComputeTask. Reasoning for including provider eth details in WTC is in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/issues/244. Because if provider has concent enabled but requestor doesn't, then there is no reason to continue communication.. It's a generator/coroutine. Typing specifications. @Krigpl they'll be used in GUI: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/ZHISL0F3TX9#/screens/297433337. IMHO db/peewee model is structured enough. I don't see a reason to create custom mapping class only for \"presentation layer\"/rpc.\nMaybe it's a good idea to move rpc formatting to client, but client is overbloated (1.7k lines). I think it deserves a proper refactoring to smaller modules e.g. client.payment, client.account etc. but it's totally outside of this PR.\nI think this PR is big enough not to implement this refactoring, don't you?. I apologize. Must have misunderstood you then.. I suggest using factory defined in complementing PR: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/pull/255. CertificateError. new_tasks.pop(). I can't understand from context, why is this sleep needed? Maybe inline comment?. Is really transforming one-element set to list and fetching element by index more readable than just poping element? :). AppVeyor used to return different values for time.time() and calendar.timegm(time.gmtime()).. Optional[Session] has no attribute add_procedures. Mypy not cool? :). True, it may be a good candidate for next refactoring PR.. Nope. Try this:\n```python\ndef f(a=[]):\n    a.append(1)\n    print(a)\nfor x in range(100):\n    f()\n``. http://www.effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm. Is this comment still valid?. I doubt it's detrimental either.. Yes, it's done once whenNodeinitializesClient. I'm open any improvement suggestions to this one. haven't come with anything better.. I need this, because base class doesn't implementexposed_procedures()method and I really want it.. I get your point, but I see no better solution.. yes, object.. For linters only.. It would be usefull foinnerif defined. This function actually returnsf`.. It was done as part of some refactoring which I don't remember, but IMHO it's always better to use namespaces. Helps to minimize local namespace pollution.. AFAIK electron has some grace time when golem starts to wait for registering procedures. We could minimize the time gap of this race-condition, but I don't think it's worth the effort.. I second to that this lint is valid, and would like to avoid that redefinition.. Would be nice to rewrite this to raise exceptions instead of this quirky triple return, but prolly outside of this PR.. What happened here? Please revert this change.. It's the only place it's used. IMO those imports shouldn't pollute module's namespace.. lintdiff didn't complain, but I added ignore anyway.. I believe those quote validate my argument:\n\nIt's often useful to place them inside functions to restrict their visibility [...]\nNote that putting an import in a function can speed up the initial loading of the module [...]\n\nThis method is called only once in golem.Node.\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/a62ee28a12b8abb642dbed9b6abfd0334e991ae3/golem/node.py#L416-L438. IMHO whole idea of using ClientProxy should be refactored out in favour of using wamp uris. But for now _call has to start with underscore because otherwise it can collide with proxied methods:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/a62ee28a12b8abb642dbed9b6abfd0334e991ae3/golem/rpc/session.py#L243-L245. Looks like it will be fine:\n\nPatch can be used as a TestCase class decorator. It works by decorating each test method in the class. This reduces the boilerplate code when your test methods share a common patchings set. patch() finds tests by looking for method names that start with patch.TEST_PREFIX. By default this is 'test', which matches the way unittest finds tests. You can specify an alternative prefix by setting patch.TEST_PREFIX.\n\nsource: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.patch. Good catch, thanks @etam !. Yep. It'll also work with bound-method and whatever python proxy object you'll feed it.. True it just duplicates typing annotation.. IMO this should be logged. Isn't it self-explanatory?. IMO you could place this int in golem.core.variables.PICKLE_ID. ?. We also need to test what happens when __getstate__ returns golem.__version__, __dict__.

We can't really tell (from the providers perspective) whether there are no more subtasks. Temporarily all subtasks may be delegated to providers, but if one subtask fails it becomes available again.

    "marmistrz": "The variables mentioned in the issue do not exist in localcomputer.py.. Closing in favor of #1254 . All the automatic tests pass on Circle and should pass on the other CIs. \nWhat's left is fixing the linter messages (hence the fail status on Circle), including 71 (sic!) \"line-too-longs\", mostly from legacy code.. The problem still persists and is similar to the latest failed AppVeyor build: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/golemfactory/golem/build/develop-1328 (but not exactly the same)\nThis seems to be related to the hyperdrive, since it's the only place which requests the port 3292.. It looks like the problem is gone. Maybe I still had the errors due to not having rerun setup.py develop.\nActually, now only the GUI fails, but the GUI is to be removed soon (tm), so closing.. The same happened here: https://circleci.com/gh/golemfactory/golem/4984, test_luxrender_real_task_exr again. As for me yes, @inexxt?. Do not merge yet.. This will be ready to merge once https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1283 is merged.. @inexxt why are you using jsonpickle in your tests? We intend to remove the dependency altogether, jsonpickle was removed from the rest of the codebase in #1254 . Hmmm... you could use dos2unix and check if anything has changed. Other than that, I don't know from the top of my head.. We settled the high-level vision of the task, no technical progress made yet due to #1254 and #1258.. It would be best to annotate the whole code and run mypy statically, but that's not a job for one day. There are lots of places where it can't be done trivally.. The status checks being red has one intrinsic issue. The status checks failing or succeeding makes it easier to find out if my change is not broken. If the status check is always red, people will start to ignore it, finding out that the tests fail only when they're ready with a change.\nBesides, Circle tests failing will clutter the inbox.\nI understand that your intent is to block changes with not enough approvals?. My idea would be to make the approval check a separate status check, just as the CLA check is.\nWe could just mark it somewhere that the coverage should be ignored until the full tests run.. From travis:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"scripts/get-slow-argument.py\", line 27, in <module>\n    result = [a for a in json_data if a[\"state\"] == \"APPROVED\"]\n  File \"scripts/get-slow-argument.py\", line 27, in <listcomp>\n    result = [a for a in json_data if a[\"state\"] == \"APPROVED\"]\nTypeError: string indices must be integers\nLooks like some type mismatch, it may be a good idea to print the response.\nNote that some tests may fail due to #1278 having been merged.. This commit should remove jsonpickle from requirements, since the only left occurence is in the gui due to #1254 . What's the problem with quotes expanding eagerly?. @maaktweluit I've just realized this will break if there's any *.py file containing a space. I'll tackle this in #1312. Closed in favor of #1308 .

Anyway, this commit is a no-go even if you remove the create part due to usage of jsonpickle, which is possibly dangerous and was removed #1254.. Are you using a virtualenv?.

It looks like the comment has already been removed in 8fd9b0d57ad69c8a9e33465f38c31ed1b5f7454b. Do not merge yet, I'm just adding support for dumping existing tasks. It appeared extremely useful to me while working on devp2p/AWS stuff.. You mean that a new one should be generated or that the user should be asked for inputting a new one?. As for the Task Manager, you mean dumping the tasks from the CLI or the dump_task function of taskmanager.py?. @badb this is a no-op, since I've already asked you :). I'm not really sure which distros are officially supported by the Golem team, but see the workaround I did on Arch Linux, which ships with OpenSSL 1.1 too: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/wiki/Installing-Golem-on-Arch-Linux-(unofficial)#final-patches\n. Mainly because I didn't know about it :P Nice catch, fixed that.. Oh, I missed a thing, that doesn't make any sense.. This happened due to not having rerun setup.py develop.. Unfortunately, I don't know, how to fix that FIXME about extra_data. The class is defined in taskbase.py but it's really unobvious, how to convert float to ExtraData. @inexxt I don't really understand your comment. Can you be more precise?. I'd squash those two style commits into one, so that there is a total of 2 commits.. @chfast This seems finished to me. As for the Python type changes, they are neatly separated into distinct commits.. That's expected. This means: execute b develop.\nI can't know if the user has an alias b for some tool.\nAnyway, the script should fail then.. I added @enforce.runtime_validation and all the tests pass.. I missed that, thanks!. Let me quote the very same PEP-484:\n\n(Note that the return type of __init__ ought to be annotated with -> None. The reason for this is subtle. If __init__ assumed a return annotation of -> None, would that mean that an argument-less, un-annotated __init__ method should still be type-checked? Rather than leaving this ambiguous or introducing an exception to the exception, we simply say that __init__ ought to have a return annotation; the default behavior is thus the same as for other methods.)\n\nNow, recall that tools such as mypy check only what appears in a so-called typed context. By default unannotated functions definitions are considered untyped context, which means this is the only way to enable constructor type-checks.\nThis is very far from being obvious. It may be bool. But you may expect Optional[bool] instead. Or a Union[bool, int, NoneType] or Union[bool, List[int]], since both int and list can appear in a logical context. To quote PEP-20, named The Zen of Python:\n\nExplicit is better than implicit.\n\nWhile the fact that a task is an instance of Task is obvious to you, it is far from being obvious to an automatic type-checker. In a 70k LOC project it's really easy to make a human mistake, mix up the order of arguments or their type (use an integer where you ought to use a class constructed from an integer).\nBut you reminded me that I ought to annotate the precise type of the get_compute_task_def, which is Callable[[], ComputeTaskDef]. I forgot about it.. I still believe that failing the tests just because there are not enough approvals is not the right way to do this. This should be properly done using the GitHub hooks.\nIf the fast CI suite will always fails, people will start ignoring the failing status checks on Circle/Travis. Moreover, people with a CircleCI account (as me, I had a CI there for another project) get an e-mail message whenever a test fails. With the current approach - there'll be a mail flood here.\nAdditionally, it's sometimes useful to see which is the last commit to pass the test, especially when developing something in a hurry (because it's a blocker). Separating the dependency requirements is basically a good idea, but will require apt to parse the dependency tree twice. I'm not sure if this won't slow down the CI a little (but this may not be a great deal). This is out of date.. Do you know the type of the items contained in the items? If yes, then you may annotate it as List[T], where T is the type.. You may want to use the famous requests module, especially that Golem is already using it, it's a little less verbose.. Oh, @jiivan, that's exactly the reason why annotations even in obvious places can be really, really useful!\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1351/files\nIf self.subs (or maybe event_names too) were annotated, such an error would not stay undetected.. If you are not sure, you can always try enforce. List (capital) is simply a generic version of list. By specifying the contained type you can get extra checks, but in a helper script it's not a big deal.\nAs for looking types up.... welcome to Python! :) There's basically no such way, since the essence of Python is dynamic duck-typing. What you can do is:\n inspect the code\n use print(type(foo)) to find out what the type is in runtime\n use enforce to validate your hypotheses\n ask colleagues. leaving this up to you, it shouldn't be a big deal either. If we're going to move to our own Docker image, then we can leave it.\nCircleCI 2.0 uses Docker anyway, the image circleci/classic:latest by default, I don't know about 1.0 (which we're using right now). Maybe the user has changed the UUID on his own...? I can change it to Note: discarding the UUID from the preset. Can you fix the line-too-long warning here, since you're touching this code anyway?\nAnd check if dir_manager is of class DirManager, if yes - annotate the types. This should be trivial using enforce.. Since you're touchting add_new_task, can you fix the pycodestyle warning at line 151?. It may be a good idea to annotate the type of subtask_id. It's very far from being obvious.. If you add -> None, you get mypy type-checks for free.. How about adding -> TaskHeader to get free typechecks?. Oh, I didn't notice these are tests. It's up to you then, but I prefer to have free checks in tests too. A common reason for failing tests is buggy tests :). Fixed. What about \nraise FileExistsError(\n    \"Error adding to resources: data path: {} exists.\".format(data_path)\n)\nThis should be 73 columns in width and is much more readable.. This was fixed while merging @Wolf480pl's change: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/commit/56a7944f9305666dfdada0d3870ea394b1668d5e. Because it's redundant now. All the classes are new-style in Python 3.. Of course that should be keys, not results.. TL;DR: It's superfluous in Python 3, it's how the official docs do.\nThe historical reasons follow. Initially in Python 2 you did class Foo:. At some point they decided to change the behavior of classes, and class Foo: meant an old-style class, class Foo(object): - a new-style class, since they didn't want to break backwards compatibility. \nNow, in Python 3, they discontinued the old-style classes altogether, so class Foo: gives a new-style class. Thus, writing (object) is superfluous, even the Python 3 documentation uses class Foo:.. Tell it the Python authors: https://docs.python.org/3.1/tutorial/classes.html. If you need monkey-patching builtins.object, you're probably doing something wrong. Please use self.assertEquals instead of assert n tests. It produces more informative output if the assertion fails.. I think you don't need the trailing comma after status_filter. ",

    "Elfoniok": "Because our verification scheme is based on random crops which sizes are percentage of chosen dimension (y) they will grow, with resolution. Because of that this ratio is constant and yields percentage of dimension for single frame.\nSince first generation of crops are defined as 1% of y dimension, and second generation as 2%. We add some margin, and deciding on 3%. \nWe define maximum subtasks as:\n\nThis reduces to:\n\nSo we are ensuring that subtasks is at least 8px/y + 2%, this will grow to 800px linear, and then stop. Yielding 33 subtasks per frame. But this not resolving issue that latest geth don't work with golem. I have found that 1.4.18 is working for me. But i dont know why.. Yes, although i still cant process task, mentioned logs disappeared and i seem to be connected, so probably problem is somewhere else. I think this can be closed now.. Turns out that first one have to download and set up docker images.. On my machine ui_AppMainWindow is old and not generated during start of golem applications.\nThis raises a question if those should be generated and attached to commits which change UI files, or should any before start of golem up start qt ui compiler?. Turns out every developer should launch setup.py script.. Hi\nThanks for commit. Definitely there is sens, as we would like to even extend cli methods.\nI think that its APP_VERSION that you can get from golem.core.variables.\nYou could also add this in golem.rpc.mapping so we can consider addint this to ui. Maybe lets leave rpc mapping topic for now. We don't have ui ready for this anyway. Although we could add to cli method for checking your own golem version so this could be potential new issue. . These need to be imported once, after project is loaded to pycharm.. Wouldn't it be better to provide this option from config file?. PR here https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1131. There are to much concerns regarding performance of gevent reactor, these need more investigation and due to architecture change it might be not needed. Since we are not benefiting from it since pydevp2p are on hold, it would be better to merge this.. I will after we move our code base to p3. Monkey patch is not nice thing, I am waiting for some comments here\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/issues/760\nat least it fix are issues for now, since many loggers were disabled from level configuration because of this.. So the motivation is to sent an event as soon as task is created.\nBecause now task it sent after uploading resources, and rechecking external addresses for node which both are time consuming operation.\nHowever i think we should refactor task/sub tasks management in further development, this change will improve user UX for now.. After a week of struggle looks like executable for windows 10 can be build. Although it needs more tests.\nTwo important things here. \nLooks like python 3.5 is compiled on windows with newer c runtime and it was necessary to recompile pywin32 with same runtime.\nAs for pyinstaller it still has a lot o problems with python3. However recent pull from github alowes us to build something stable.\nAs think we have more problems with Mac Os right now.. Hey two things, if you write down your environment, please provide golem version. Than check if your node is listed here:\nhttps://stats.golem.network/show\nIf not, probably you don't have port forwarded, i know you are writing you have but have you confirmed that those are open?\nFor example with netcat utility (telnet on windows?)?\nFor some cases this can be pointless if your ISP is not allowing for this. For example at home my ISP is operating only on IPv6 addresses but since most of internet is working on IPv4 they have something called DualStack-Lite which is translating IPv4 to IPv6 but in the end it doesn't allow for IPv4 port forwarding even if i do this in my ruter configuration.\nAs for logs, on Windows check out folder\nC:\\Users\\.golem\\logs pack it and send to us on \ntech@golem.network. In order to tell whats wrong its easier to skip GUI in process. Just launch golem but in a console find and invoke:\ngolemcli.exe network show\nand check output of this command.. Looks like you need to do this in privileged console or set UAC to allow golemcli.exe to access sockets.. Lets merge this, there is no reason i think why Freeimage was installed from source? This can be also done on Travis i think?\nJust  today Circle crashed on building Freeimage so using prebuilt binaries would be a good change.. Couple of question\n1) How this function should check if newer version is available? Could it be written in some monitor resource file?\n2) Does this step necessary? Gui could ask for this information monitor itself without core assistance.\n3) So where and when? Like this should be periodically? Once for a change? This could be a popup? I could propose, that this check could be periodically but instead of showing warning popup, this could be a label below current version of installed application. So we could have:\nCurrent version 0.8.1\nLatest available version: 0.9.0 . Moreover it looks like this is a duplication for existing PR:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1447\nDoesn't getting latest version from github is better option? Asumming that we always use github for our project.. As a general note.\nYou mix code cleanup/refactoring with features. It is hard for review such pull request, think if you could divide this in more pull request. First you make commit with cleanup/refactor then you add new features.. Fixed here\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/commit/be2de9fb4ce2f95220d5a5320dbeb967129c2c2b. Fixed here:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/commit/21934baa6a15d7ac573b0171e6e854a29617c098. Fix https://github.com/imapp-pl/golem_rd/issues/137. I would advise to remove ipfs, really. Can you update \n\nRequires #1301 to be merged, else the tests will fail on the linux server based on error in the description.\n\nAlthough this one is closed, no gui was already merged, so i think we can proceed with finishing this and merging. You are right, we should create follow up issues, if there is nothing very important. Will be good to have tests on buildboot.. Just fix all failing tests, maybe there are old test, testing old UI?. MessageTask compose of 244 bytes of overhead, which is constant.\nFor each entry it yields on average 943 bytes (for each task header sent within)\nWe could gain here quite a lot, because a lot of data in TaskHeader is not used by remote node. Another task would be to analyze this and get rid of obsolete fields during serialization.. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1489. Downloading resource:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/develop/golem/network/hyperdrive/client.py#L61\nI am not sure what do you mean by accepting task, probably you can start here:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/develop/golem/task/taskserver.py#L184\nHere golem takes one of known task descriptors (aka TaskHeader) and tries to connect directly to task owner. When it does and receives: MessageResourceList\nIt will pull resources:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/develop/golem/task/tasksession.py#L670. The idea was to disable sending/receiving. The message with its structure and sending/reacting method stays. Call sites of this methods was removed since they was broken anyway (producing so much noise), receiving code was unlinked to drop any Degree messages if someone will post them.. Ok this is a good point. Should i change protocol version then? Or should i react to MessageDegree simply and do nothing?. GNT to GNTW converting process.\n\nBasic algorithm was implemented. However there are some failing tests, and Deposit slots needs to be commented in order to whole thing to work.\nPaymentProcessor tests are done using ethereum tester class. This needs all necessary contracts to be deployed with `state.evm' from bytecode. This allows one to tests contracts locally. However some contracts needs parameters passed to constructor, this problems should be addressed. For example Faucet contract needs GNT address passed as parameter.\nIn other tests transaction functions should be mocked.\n. This feature is finished by Krigpl in another PR. Geth was updated, init method was changed (we dont need rinkeby.json anymore, nor we need to remove old chain data), looks like we are good after Byzantium hard fork:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/commit/382766327e68c361ab0ad519ef2c9f6c643d752e\nThis PR fix Tee related problem, syncing is working on all platforms, no further problems detected:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1512. Actually there might be another problem, sometimes geth chaindata will be corupted. Syncynig will stuck at that time.

Please don't hard code columns numbers... It works on windows, though looks ugly there ;P I have successfully synchronized all blocks from genesis to latest block on rinkeby.. > chcp\nActive code page: 852. Task collector will not work, on Linux on fresh machine without freeimage.. Ok even though python is on desktop machines python3 is by default as well, so probably a good idea.. Yes this is a feature, i already explained this, we better have node shutdown behavior than hanging overwhelmed process. But this is not be good for developers making debugging sessions, maybe we should make an option form this?. Hey, thanks for pointing this out!\nLooks like we had problem with our faucet, should be working fine now,\nas a side not we should also handle this kind of error  gracefully.. Closed in favor of https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2040. Actually for me worked\nimport locale\ndef console_to_str(s):\n    return s.decode(locale.getpreferredencoding() or \"utf-8\", 'replace'). Very good change. It greatly simplifies resources code and its working properly.. That solves problem discovered yesterday with some deserialized tasks crashing applications.. For the record, this is explanation of this error. Looks like simultaneously drop and select cause this:\nhttp://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=DatabaseIsLocked. Actually from this:\nhttps://github.com/mackyle/sqlite/blob/58f507c7a066d40b077fe8c89fc36aa3a7a88e00/src/main.c#L1415\nIt looks like we are getting SQLITE_BUSY error. Fix is here:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1925\nFor now we will retry operation when DB is busy, at later time it might be good to actually decrease concurrency in accessing sqlite writes in golem.. Solved here:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/commit/1bc0bf41d88947c62b6112a929e5fc2ac74401ee. Its a good idea (choker) and we might keep that in mind for future development. But bit torrent use case is for data not messages so its not easy to incorporate this, but we might get inspired and try to design something more sophisticated later in time.. I dont know why? This is a result of analyzing golem p2p messages in terms of amount of messages on sec for p2p session. I have discovered that ResourceSession is not used anymore and is obfuscating code base.. Submodules added by mistake are gone now.. Commit is here:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1985. PR is here\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2040. Actually maybe simply propagation will work after all? No solution would work if some removed_tasks list was not present on node. Luckily taskkeeper holds such list, i didn't check the details but seems like solving problem with receiving removed tasks.\nCheck self.removed_tasks. I have tested this also on Windows, good spot with this posix path, thanks badb.. Fixe is here https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2172. Currently a formula have been proposed that takes crops size into account when user is declaring subtask amount. It is impossible to set subtask amount that will yield subtask smaller than crop size.. Check attachments\nRandomVsAnalog.tar.gz\n. It turned out that there is no problem with file format and post processing. Problem is as follows:\nMSE metrics is very sensitive pixel wise, especially when there is some edge in the picture. It can go very high in such situations when image is displaced by only one pixel.\nI am closing this because its another problem.. @mfranciszkiewicz \n3.6 isn't a first choice because it's not available by default on Ubuntu LTS\nThis only matter for developers, the main question here is what we can build with pyinstaller.  If you say that windows and mac'os are built with python 3.6 that's great.. Fixed in #2026 . Fix is here:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2172.

Original problem was solved some time ago, but problem still occur when one use debug switch for golem. Since this logs are third party libraries logs, we are not interested very much in them, however if they are need ed in rare cases it should be possible to show them, hence this commit:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2810. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2921/files. Yes, calculated pixels can be on edges on crop border as well, hence equal signs.. Here is fix\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2494. Fix for:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/2443. Closing in favor of which is targeted for develop:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2588/files. This done here:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/commit/e0dd6eed559464c24b3aff11751ad5a357d92437. It was merged with b0.15.1. Main changes are done in verificator:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem-verificator/commit/3f5b4cbe1a0d1988535b194ae5c6107593d06d9b. During local test, when default parameters should be recognized, when scene has default jpg format, we fail to recognize this (probably because we drop support for jpg outputs?). This results in not \"Not Loaded\" in Fromat editbox. However despite this, GUI is sending \"jpg\" as demanded format, which is wrong since Blender is using JPEG which is the same, but has to be formed with e.\nWe should:\n1. Decided what to output in case we don't support some output format during local tests.\n2. Send to core valid output type format\n3. Return some error if we still don't support type which GUI sent.. Please provide logs from stdout and stderr, you can find them in:\ndatadir/res/[task_id]/tmp/[subtask_id]/std[err|out].log\ndatadir/res/[task_id]/tmp/[subtask_id]/[0|1|2]/tmp/output/std[err|out].log. Actually one can see that the division line exists on material itself, hair doesn't have much with this. For this effect material option \"Subsurface scattering\" is responsible. We don't know why yet, but if scene is rendered part by part (like in golem when scene is divided on strips) in some areas of such material it yields clear divisions between subsequent strips.. Here is output without hairs (slightly lower resolution)\n\n. I have also doubts about this.\n1. This started from request to close golem VM after shutdown, but this not solve this, instead we wait for golem to finish task, strange.\n\nHave you considered using addSystemEventTrigger(\"before\", \"shutdown\", ...), this should be used if one want to do anything before twisted will start shutting down process. . Hey Magda, you need to sign CLA, besides, this need to be merged after new release of golem-verificator.. This was cherry picked here:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/commit/4d164a783270e34269dc569187c78997f184aa1a\nand merged so i am closing this.. I will accept for slow test to run.. Two offending test are due to docker images not being available on MacOs and Windows buildbots. Since DummyTaskEnvironment inherits from DockerEnvironment it is reasonable to not support those if docker images are not available, but this also force us to ci_skip this tests.. \n. What about ping messages?. maaktweluit what OS offended users have?\n\nWhat do you mean by until they changed the resources allocation of the VM golem is overriding any manual set up, or you mean they are running whole docker in VM?. Hey SmartLibertyFBO why do you think you memory is not freed? I am sory but i don't see anything on your screenshot.\nFirst of all tell us what Docker Toolbox and Virtual Box you have?\nYou can check if any of docker images inside your VB is using up resources with command prompt:\ndocker-machine env golem\n@FOR /f \"tokens=*\" %i IN ('docker-machine env golem') DO @%i\ndocker stats\nLast command will open a window which monitors, docker containers, and its resource usage, please show us if there is anything suspect. Also would you mine sending us some logs?\nLogs can be found here:\nC:\\Users[yourUser]\\AppData\\Local\\golem\\golem\\default\\mainnet\\logs. @klopsknoedel we would love to use Docker CE for Windows, but it is only supported from Windows Pro and above, so we would need to drop support fro Windows Home. So we have two problem here:\nMain is that, even on machines with sufficient amount of RAM (16Gb should be enough to render most of Blender artworks) Blender is having problem with allocating memory. This may be due to some bugs in Blender allocators, and probably we can not do much about it, except raise this issue to Blender devs.\nThe second one is that memory that was taken by faulty containers is never freed. This is something that we can investigate, as proper error handling is introduced in Golem and should be working all right.\nGeneral question is, i know that both of you have 16Gb, but how many of this is allocated to Golem? You can check this in VirtualBox setting for Golem VM, or judge from the percentage value of the slider in Golem application.. Yes, this error simply mean that there is not enough resources, trust me sometimes you need 12-13 Gb for render some scenes.\nAre there any memory leaks? From what i have checked, error is handled gracefully and no problem here.. SmartLibertyFBO can you check and provide some screen shots (or output of commands that i have provided), so we can check if any process is holding resources?. OK we are planing to correct this cryptic error codes, and maybe raise some issue to blender since it would be natural to just use swap, and slowly compute, task.\nOn the other hand we are planning to filter out providers which doesn't have sufficient resources to successfully compute subtask.. Example build: https://buildbot.golem.network/buildbot/#/builders/11/builds/4447/steps/5/logs/stdio. I agree hopefully we will be there soon.. This PR should resolve issue, that is golem should not hang on verification anymore:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3164. Can we change this label to deferred?. First of all i am curious if have you encountered this on buildbot? Because we are dropping Circle CI. Nevertheless here is PR which will speed up test 3 times, so it should help.\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3131. This bug is caused because preview file is handled in two separate threads.\n/golem/task/taskserver.py\", line 140, in sync_network\n/golem/task/taskserver.py\", line 881, in __remove_old_tasks\n/golem/task/taskmanager.py\", line 787, in check_timeouts\n/golem/core/common.py\", line 147, in func_wrapper\n/apps/rendering/task/framerenderingtask.py\", line 131, in computation_failed\n/apps/rendering/task/framerenderingtask.py\", line 338, in _update_frame_task_preview\nand\n/golem/network/transport/tcpnetwork.py\", line 366, in _interpret  \n/golem/task/tasksession.py\", line 123, in interpret\n/golem/network/transport/session.py\", line 76, in interpret\n/golem/task/tasksession.py\", line 485, in _react_to_want_to_compute_task\n/golem/task/taskmanager.py\", line 396, in get_next_subtask\n/apps/blender/task/blenderrendertask.py\", line 484, in query_extra_data\n/apps/rendering/task/framerenderingtask.py\", line 338, in _update_frame_task_preview\nPreview file can be corupted this way, and PIL yields that it can not identify image file.\nIn general removing tasks in Golem is very poorl handled because of python\neasier to ask for forgiveness than permission guidline, instead of ensuring that it is safe to delete task/subtask we just delete it and then handle lot of errors that it causes everywhere in datastructures of Golem.\nWe can go that way further and just provide proper locking of this file, or make it right this time.. This fixes https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-verificator/issues/55. Above exception is caused by the result of some other bug which causing the blenderrendertask file extension to disappear (as one can see from above log) and crash saving image. \nProper error handling will be added to mitigate this error. However this not solve problem with task status not updating. Either the original cause (which is unknown, ederenn can provide more details about problems with output format not specified) or even something else might causing this (in example still not fixed updating preview from different threads).. Fix:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/3357. Merge should wait for system tests. It works well for PNG, although blender scripts will have to be extended at some point, for example\nbpy.context.scene.render.image_settings.color_depth = '16'\nOtherwise blender will simply use whatever is set in the scene file, but if it is 16 bit, then collecting images save it in 16 bit format.. EXR and JPEG are assembled well as well.. Fix is here\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3597. Are you sure that key_id is always owner_key_id?. key_id not defined here?. key_id not defined here? ....\"wating\" there is no such thing! One more thing you changed passed arguments list, but i don't see modification of Client function definition. What about call site present inside __connection_for_task_result_failure ?. OK. OK. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Please explain it in more details.. Ok. Done. Done. Done. Actually \\n is already there. But i agree that it should be more descriptive, i see this as a quick solution for upcoming release. In longer term i would like to send more data about environment in case of fail, but this require rethinking how to send this and present.. Is it use anywhere?. Are you sure you need two exactly same messages just with different names?. Not used. Not used, i can see that you use it in commented code, but first off all this testing code should be provide as a snippet, not in PR, second import for this should be grouped together with code.. Same as above. We don't want this in out code currently, why would we?. List is not used. jsonpickle should  not be used anymore. Please add a new line on each of the files.. We should remove this, for long time there is no such thing as resource peer.. ? Double declaration?. Does isinstance isn't inherently wrong? what if someone change this to set? for example.. What for print statments?. Why this is taken out of try block?. I don't thin it is necessary, is it? Some previous bug caused that some function threw exception here but it will be fixed after transferring some fixes from devp2p branch.. why print it here?. Where you catch exception threw here?. Same here if you compare strings 10 version will be lower than 9. What does it mean to return True here?. Ok great. Yes so? where you are going to catch those exceptions? I can see you are catching this in tests, buy what for client? or even RPC call?. Can you add a comment to this function?. What for are this scripts?. How this script is used?. Where do you use IPFS?. What version of geth this will install?. Actually you don't need start hyperg, golem should start this on his own.. In what test this is required?. Which TODO? Why are you using your own fork?. Hm i think tests should be independent, different platform can and will have set it differently, our tests should be agnostic as well if there is a dependency on that we should fix this. Or maybe the error is because of this var is NOT set? Any way some details could be useful. I don't understand why this is moved?. Actually we are, but looks like Circle was also set up this way, so it's ok.. Actually no, we don't need IPFS is some test need this , it should be removed.. Ok i will accept solutions taken from Circle but please remove IPFS. But choices is with repetition, no? I want to try random.sample is this all right?\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample. So this is actually a reason?. Why are you creating unnecessary local vars?. I would but it's better to check if all entries are unique, as you pointed out without repetition.. Typo: proposition \"of many if\" -> \"many of these\". What is the point assigning something just before throwing exception?. So in case of remote geth we are blocking and trying forever, and in case of local geth we are trying once and crashing if this failed?. Can we confirm that gas price will not change significantly?. How did you calculate this gas price?. Please don't add this file, it was removed for a reason. This should not be part of this PR it's already changed anyway.. Yes i can confirm currently hyperg daemon should be run in background when running tests. 1. No its not but its not worth PR for such a change.\n2. Maybe good idea, but don't want to change behavior just before release.. You will not, there is not point for using those in code, that is why events, are left as aliases, but method names are passed to crossbar ruter only. You don't need them unless you are using debug class, but i guess then you know what are you doing and can use those correctly.. What problem this is solving?. Why this is needed?. Why serialization here?. Are you sure you want to init this with [ ] (it will be same list every function call), instead None?. Please add task id to logs. Can you get this dir from config?. Hmm shipable probably just don't use taskcollector, so it can be skipped?. Comment in requirement file?. That is a new custom but ok. Is it so common? Maybe a warning here?. Quite strange, wouldn't it be better to simply hold reference to HyperdriveClient?. again why create it over and over?. Coud you use utils.denoms.ether constant to express this value?. Could you change this also to be expressed with denoms.ether. why not express this in 20 * denoms.shannon ? This is what i meant (ether was just example). Ok i just learned that all fractional units of ethers are obsolete. I would argue for creating then units that are already using like Gwei. And using this in our code.. No the point is to have names on such constants.. Done. Lets just leave this. I have changed previous name. Done. Done. Done. To understand what it means. This function is not available anymore.. This is only for tests. Doesn't make sens, code in test often use function in crude way, because it's trying to create specific environment. In golem we only need one function. This is small change not api refactor.\nHaving two function calls instead of one is not desired,  its not public api.. You can send hex encoded pub_key and use it in query against 'sender_node' from Expected income, otherwise, i am not sure that subtask_id is unique among all tasks.. Can't you do this once in run_benchmark function?. Please can you describe constants used here?. Or some documentation to algorithm used here. In document this is described as SSIM ans MSE calculated on  edge transformed image. Maybe change this to SSIM_edge ? so its obvious what is the difference between SSIM_normal?. Edge transformed?. Done. verifier was a local variable, it could die before threads finish with verification. Done. Done. Done. This is intention. Done. Done. Done. crop_min is not int, check division after generating random int. Not really this is not '/golem/output' dir, this is path to output of blender job, where crop files are stored. This is in order to avoid copying files,. dzyzaz. Docker Task Thread is well for Task, its not well prepared to handle something else, but i try to make it nicer.. sure :). Probably need to change docs. No i set it after first stage to 3.. Thanks. I need it to pass in start_network function.. Oh it is but only for mainnet, i didn't noticed this. But imho if we are not want this updates we should not even bother dispatcher with sending them. . Because this flag is in wrong place after all. Maybe, its not the point of this change. This is a quick fix for monitor.. Yes in 1.2 there is PSNR calculated also. Dockerfile was not changed. I think i will create separate repo for scripts for image_metrics or clean up exisitng ones.. Good point thanks.. Yeas actually i was thinking the same, but somehow hesitated . So provider need to modify this manually?. this can be double and firejail doesn't  support it. i think because of time needed for additional logic in send. why no requirements here? What are purpose of it then? Could you provide example?. Shouldn't requirements from task definition be passed here instead of empty list?. empty requirements list?. I though about it but, i cant be sure that none is set only on exit, who nows what gets in here. It might be that we don't want to break when getting none because of some possible bug or feature.. So requirements are not passed in message?. Whats the point of passing this? Shouldn't  environments manager be used for getting environment for specific ctd?. Once again why this if we are using manager?. why not environments manager?. What is the point of using docker manager, looks like Task Computer should be agnostic if it can use different environments, and some of them will not use docker at all.. Ok, i suspected that but this should be noted clearly.. Right, thanks!. Ok. No i was asking about Tasks Message. But its all right.. Ok this is also important to note.. Ok. Ok. Ok. Done. Done. Done. Done. Done. No, list is good for now.. This may return None. Its not needed here to access list once again, use += operator or extend metohd return_data[\"warnings\"][\"missing_files\"].extend(warnings['missing_files']). Cant you leave this as it was for missing files? Just store whole missing_path. Otherwise you are unnecessary doubling data storage, where it could be up to the consumer of this class to either get basename or dir name.. Alternatively you can leave set, as warnings type, and apply sort when adding element to it. This way you don't need to iterate over it so many times,  and you know that you are actually sorting by keys, so this will not change anything ( baseName will always be before dirName) :). Ok but why don't split path on basename and dir name, right before displaying it?. Please explain, because i see this unjustified. Why not store whole missing_path and extract basename and filename where is necessary?. conversion to bool is not required. That is better but you could sort items before inserting them so save some iterations.. /tmp/ ?  I think its always good to remove chdir (like who use that?!, what if separate threads are saving files and someone just change its working dir?). I am pretty sure that this is working dir for local test, during adding task (but better confirm this) so datadir/network_name/tmp dir ?. Hey i checked this, so this is base class and its never used (i tried as provider and requestor), derived class which is DockerTaskThread is used all the time and currently i don't see when one could want to use base implementation.. This is handled in one (main) thread only.. Ok but lets leave it for later, for example during actual persistence implementation.. Ok, this is done, verification context will handle deferred list, and start will return it, so the caller code can handle this.. Yes, i dont think it is possible right now without requestor able to connect back to provider. Right now all verification is during provider connection session. When we close golem we will lose this connection. The idea is that we serialize all verification tasks, not the queue itself. On golem start we deserialize verification tasks, recreate the queue based on them and establish connection back with provider. This should not be part of this PR.. It would be possible, but this require a lot o changes since computer implementation need to be changed. It is not justified for now.. done. done. done. done. done. I am not sure if this is a good way to collect exposed methods? basically we scan all methods of providers and check if its has uri attribute?. why do you need this? Is is allowed to use private fields of base class according to python conventions?. I am not sure if we don't depend here on WAMP internals? Wouldn't be a problem when updating WAMP version?. That is a good question, currently, verification task can be restarted after canceling, so this means that is not entirely valid. But I will remove it when proper verification queue persistence is implemented.. Can this throw exception?. well as far as i know we are still supporting writing to EXR format, could you check this with badb or blue?. Some error handling would be nice :). There will be 1.5.3 merging both paths.. Done. Sometimes it happen during merge, actually i like it more as it is sorted in increasing order of characters in Golem- deps :P. good points. ",

It same for minutes, seconds bigger than 59.\nCurrent problem here is just a max. date normalization. And I already sent patch to the library repo, waiting for merge.\n  .

I have only one multi  object into an array. To get the changes from the object all the time I need to make deep object diff. I think it should not be that hard to know latest changes. Cannot we return an array with pushed states objects into? So the last element or the first can be the most recent state of app? . @mfranciszkiewicz Nothing, merging it. . The final decision for the upcoming release is; \nWe will keep minimal performance slider as easy as possible and in safe range. Thumb of the slider will run onto 10 simple steps. \n\nLevel (step) 0 will accept all work offers\nEvery step will increase desired score by 300. (Max will be 3000 for blender usecase)\nUsers will be able to see which level their performance on.. Seems like it's already resolved with the latest updates.

RPC does not return any exception reason while task creation. I have all conditions to have \"Not enough GNT\" for task creation, in terminal I have the exception but I don't have it on RPC error callback. . The only problem is, it takes too much time to create task, or at least \"response\" from the \"create task\" definition,  if the task file is heavy/detailed or etc. The return/response shouldn't wait for the task to be created. It was a known problem some time ago and solved by the team, but this branch cause it again.. > Not sure maybe it's a good idea to check task name length here.\n\nIgnore this, I solved in electron side as you mentioned. \n\nCould you elaborate more on that? Steps to reproduce or something?\n\nThis local task \"Atv Buggy\" started after \"Pavillion missing\" task and results are belong to \"Pavillion missing\" when I have the results.\n\nSame for the other way around for \"Pavillion missing\" task, results belong to \"Atv Buggy\" one.\n\nYou can reproduce the same thing if you have one blend project folder with missing assets and one without.. @ederenn Does it resolved with previous release?

But why we have another RPC for it? I was expecting to have the parameters in this RPC.. @pawelkisielewicz It was working like that afaik, but the concept had to change because of UX related issues. When RPC waits until task creation it was taking a lot on GUI to redirect user to the task list screen or give a feedback about the related error. So instead of waiting all process we made this change. \nIf we wait whole flow, this issue will pop-up again. Is there any alternative or an idea to shortened the waiting time tolerably?. @mplebanski Only thing I remember, it was depend on the task complexity.. Everything is fine, finally I got it;\nelixir\nconcentBalance: {\n    value: '400000000000000000000',\n    status: 'unlocking',\n    timelock: '1547848245'\n  }\nNo idea why I couldn't have it on first try and actually waited more than half an hour. \nClosing it, as there is no issue right now.. This is the feature of semantic_version package. Version classes easily comparable with simple comparison operators.. response.raise_for_status()\nRequests(v2.8.0 >=) library has it's own exception handling, if status code is not one of the success codes 2xx , it will raise exception.. On RPC call there's an exception handling but for CLI there's no, so I'll fix it soon.. If the current version is latest one, just returned boolean instead of sending json message about it, and I'll check the type on client-side if message is boolean or not.. Sure.. yeap, make sense. \ud83d\udc4d . seems like #noqa is needed for database boolean filter in where, otherwise shippable pops up this error;\ngolem/network/p2p/p2pservice.py:133:43: E712 comparison to False should be 'if cond is False:' or 'if not cond:'\\n. It's not, I removed it.. updated \ud83d\udc4d . updated \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks for review! I updated it as ValueError.. \ud83d\udc4d done.. \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks! I applied it, looks more compact, but still I wanted to keep length condition separately to address the error precisely, if it's just a length or character error.. js routine \ud83d\ude42  updated.. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . I tweaked a bit more.. None of them are necessary in subtask_progress.__dict__ for now, but good to see what we have as information about computed task. We can consider to use at least some of them to show to providers for the future. . While having an if condition  if return_data.get(\"warnings\"): how it can return None ? . Done, thanks!. Oh seems like I forgot to add attribute for sorted, like \nsorted(f.items, key=lambda f: f['baseName'])\nwhich is fixed now. \nFor your first comment, this is the goal of this PR. To make data structured. We are using both information (dirName, baseName) in new local task test result as below to give user more information about the place of the data, so they can place the missing files easily; \n\n. While having at least 2 different file system to check (Windows, Mac/Linux) and having built in path method already for it, I couldn't find any reason to write another function. . I already explained it in here. \nInstead of having one full path of the file, I would rather to create an english syntax for UX purposes. To do it, I needed to have file name and the directory separately. And the lines you pointed, was the best place to split path correctly for all related OS file systems. Thus, rather than writing another function to check and split different file system paths, I used built-in one without any additional effort. . Done, thanks good to know. . @jiivan I will keep the same argument, If I was doing any other string manipulations I would definitely go for it. But for the cross platform file paths, I see it more suitable.. Done.. Test was there, only thing I did is update to the new form. Who wrote the test probably wanted to be sure if there's any duplicate still. If needless, which it is with set usage, I removed it.. Thanks good one.. Yes, that's true, should we keep only localhost then as hardcoded? . Given flag on golem electron;\nnpm run start -- --datadir /Users/USER_NAME/golem_2 --rpc-address 127.0.0.1:60002\nfor golem;\npython golemapp.py -d /Users/USER_NAME/golem_2 -r 127.0.0.1:60002\nResult;\nWARNING  [twisted] dropping connection to peer tcp4:127.0.0.1:50579 with abort=False: WebSocket connection denied: origin 'http://localhost:3002' not allowed\nAs you see above; crossbar gets 127.0.0.1 address as localhost, but CORS does not applies the  rule for localhost properly; because address.host variable is 127.0.0.1 by default not localhost. And it's probably doing a simple string check for CORS. \nThe only way to get address.host as localhost is passing rpc-address flag as localhost:60002.\nSo my suggestion is to check if address.host  is either localhost or 127.0.0.1 and replace it with localhost all the time.. Auto formatter force to do that, working on it. . Same reason as above. Same.. @jiivan @Krigpl  if it's fine for the API representation, fine for me too.. ",

Yes, we should have one instance of DirManager. \nOur code needs refactoring of I/O path.  Feel free to do so.\nThe rule is simple: keep it consistent across the project, i.e., \nclean copy-pasted 'path-helpers' functions and use one DirManager everywhere.\nThere is also a fileshelper.py which can be merged into DirManager.\nbtw, taskmanager isn't a clever one ;-)\n``` python \n        self.root_path = root_path\n        self.dir_manager = DirManager(self.get_task_manager_root())\n...\ndef get_task_manager_root(self):\n    return self.root_path\n\n``.

Please keep nomenclaturepriv_key, pub_key = cls._generate_new_keys(difficulty)... just in case ;). It seems, thatget_difficultyhas a lot of common withis***_difficult`, I think that they should be merged like:\npython\ndef is_difficult_enought(some_key, difficulty):\n    return get_difficulty(some_key) > difficulty\n. That's right, however I decided to introduce a class just in case that someone could use it the other way around  ;-). done. yes, the extra _ is also removed.. done\n. done. ok, self.nat_type reverted.. The method shall also check whether pubkey matches the privkey...\nor store only the priv_key.. I think that:\npython\n self.key_id = encode_hex(pub_key)\nis enought, because _def _cnt_key_id(public_key: bytes) isn't used anywhere else (only in tests).\nMoreover the cnt shorcut is strange.. the def is_difficult(self, difficulty: IntFloatT) is a dead code. Appears only in tests.. I think that we shall always use the safer method: _load_and_check_keys(...)\nBTW, maybe it is enough to store just the priv_key?\n. What will happen when GolemFactory will decide to increase the difficulty?\nI am afraid that silent overwriting of the previous keys may result in unexpected lost of identity, founds etc.\nFor now, let the self._save_keys() just create a new file \"keys_no1-DD-MM-YYYY)\" then \"keys_no1-DD-MM-YYYY\".. Please, avoid silent try-except block.\nPlease, add a logger in the except block.. def load_from_file is a deadcode together with \ndef load_keys_from_file(self, file_name): from golem/client.py\nRemove please.. def save_to_files(self, private_key_loc: str, public_key_loc: str) -> bool: deadcode\nPlease remove together with\ndef save_keys_to_files(self, private_key_path, public_key_path) from golem/client.py\n. There is to much features (and dead code) which might be useful in golem. \nIt is enough to keep the live code in develop branch.\nPlease remove this function.. self.task_persistence is a bool being true by default.\nWe dont need another persist=True flag.. What is the difference between TaskStats and CurrentStats?\nPlease, add some documentation.. Do we really need another TaskOp class/enum containing similar fields that classes above?. ",

Attached is a zip of the tmp folder including multiple \"failed\" subtasks, as well as the correctly rendered slices of each subtask.\ntmp.zip\n. @tejas4goa if you know what needs to be changed, it would be great if you could go ahead and update it.. The problem is that scenes vary dramatically in complexity and render time, and you also don't know what your node is rendering.. That doesn't address the problem. You are either a requestor or a provider for any particular task. If you are a requestor, you know what scene is being rendered and how long it took, but not the specs of the nodes doing the subtask computations. If you are a provider, you know what your specs are, but not what scene is being rendered or even what part or how much of the scene you are rendering (in general you won't even know when you are rendering, though you could monitor processes to work out that you are rendering something).. Here's an explanation of how to port forward to multiple nodes I wrote a while ago. It should work in most cases, though in some cases you may need to forward to different internal ports and update the ports the golem app is listening on on each node (I don't have a write-up of how to do this currently, sorry).\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GolemProject/comments/8la5rk/golem_client_updates/dzfoprw/.

    "Deozaan": "I just downloaded and installed Golem 0.6.0 for Windows 10.\nThe installer installed a bunch of stuff. Then I ran Golem and a black command console popped up for a few seconds and then some text flashed on the screen and the console closed. I ran it a few more times trying to see what the text said. After several attempts I finally managed to capture a screenshot at just the right time so I could read the message that briefly appeared before the window closed. The seemingly important part of the message said \"Access is denied.\"\n\nSo I ran Golem again with Administrator privileges and again a console application popped up and then I started seeing a ton of messages about downloading new headers or something. I didn't realize Golem needed to sync the entire blockchain. Also, what if I already have the entire blockchain synced using Parity? Seems like it downloads everything fresh because it's in a VM/Docker container that doesn't know anything about my system. Or maybe because it's running on the testnet?\nMy ISP has bandwidth limitations; I can't sync the blockchain twice (or even once).\nSo I pressed ctrl-c to stop it and decided I probably acted in haste when I installed Golem. I decided to read up a bit more about it and realized that, from the best I can tell, it doesn't actually do anything yet. So I decided to uninstall it while I do more research into what Golem is and how to use it and when it will actually be usable.\nI ran the uninstaller which told me after a second or so that everything had been uninstalled. But I still have Kitematic (Alpha), Docker Quickstart Terminal, and Oracle VM VirtualBox shortcuts on my desktop. In my opinion this is bad behavior. An uninstaller should uninstall all the stuff that the installer installed.\nI see no listing for Kitematic in Windows' Uninstall Programs section of the Control Panel. Clicking the shortcut makes it open a Docker Toolbox, which does show up in the control panel. Uninstalling it gets rid of the Kitematic and Docker Quickstart shortcuts. Uninstalling VirtualBox gets rid of the VirtualBox shortcut. But now I'm left wondering what other junk got left behind on my system by this.. ",

I would love to edit if i have permissions?. My bad. I can see the guide has been updated already :). ",
    "miserablegit91": "Hi friends, \nI made a github account just so I could respond to this thread. I consider myself a novice, but am interested in Golem and want to help accelerate it's development in any way I can. Here are the issues I have come up against during installation / running. I am sure I have done something wrong with regard to my installation and / or port stuff - please tell me if so, but I thought sharing my novice experience would be beneficial all the same.\nI first attempted to install it on an older laptop with 2gb ram running Windows 7 (x64), and came up against these issues: \n\n\nThe installation instructions were unclear. I started downloading all the dependencies as per here before finally getting to the release  page, only to see that everything is installed via the golem-win_x64-0.6.0-setup.exe download file. \n\n\nWhen I went to run the application, the command prompt opens and I was given the following information:\n\n\n\nThe block headers began downloading, after which nothing happened. The latest block was downloaded every second or so, and that's it. No GUI opened up or anything else. Okay. Maybe this laptop doesn't have enough ram? Not sure.\n\n\nI tried installing it on a different laptop (Windows 7 (x64) 8gb, much 'newer'), and I managed to get the GUI to launch. Yay.\n\n\nI followed the DHCP router configurations described here to the letter, and also made inbound and outbound rules for both TCP and UDP for ports 3282, 40102, 40103, as described here.\n\n\nThe GUI still displays the error \"Not connected to the Golem network. Please check seed parameters. This was despite my connection registering here\n. Which, to my understanding, meant I was at least visible to the Golem network?\n\n\nNow I am just seeing this error over and over again in the command prompt. \n\n\n\nLargely, I'm unsure of what exactly it is that I am doing with regard to port forwarding and the like, so any help would be appreciated. Hopefully user installation will be a bit more friendly in the future, so even novices like me can put their idle compute power towards something greater! Thanks.\n. ",
    "ArcAster": "It could be a good idea to ask people trying to install Golem to screencast with audio?  That might give more insight as to where the install flow breaks down for varying levels of \"beginner\" users?. I think a more concise definition of \"efficient\" is necessary.  Once Golem is running with real ETH, it's likely people will look for \"minimum hardware requirements\" in terms of the monetary returns they'll make or the bare minimum to run a working node.\nIt might be a good idea to list benchmarks for common consumer CPU's (intel Core-i7 7700k, Ryzen 1700), a few \"budget\" Xeon CPU's  (i.e. Xeon e5-2660 or e5-2670) and on the low end something embedded or an arm platform (xeon D, intel, atom cxxx or desktop ARM v8 platform?) capable of running Docker (being able to run Docker seems to be the current lower-bound in terms of hardware compatibility)..

UAC attempts to alleviate this using File and Registry Virtualization, which redirects writes (and subsequent reads) to a per-user location within the user\u2019s profile. For example, if an application attempts to write to \u201cC:\\program files\\appname\\settings.ini\u201d and the user doesn\u2019t have permissions to write to that directory, the write will get redirected to \u201cC:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\Program Files\\appname\\settings.ini\u201d.\n\nSo it's normal, the log file is just written somewhere else, there is no error to catch.

You can close it.. I think it will be necessary to turn off linters this time (or turn them on only for specific files) - because a lot of code is touched in this PR, linters found ~2k warnings and errors.. Waiting for https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1362 to be merged first. But still, it may sometimes be useful to do it in the runtime (eg if things are constructed dynamically, or in the annotated-not annotated code transitions) - mypy (and generally - static type checking) alone doesn't have such capabilities.\nI suppose that some of these insinstance() checks were put there for these reasons. . First step of refactoring that: moving these paths to params.py (this is the way extra_data task parameters are passed to subtask script in docker), to remove hardcoded values from docker_*.py scripts (they can be accessed now by params.WORK_DIR etc) - done in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1297. LocalComputer shouldn't require task parameter. It is an inconvenience when doing verification, since there are no separate classes for verification tasks, and instead some code which gives ComputeTaskDef is provided (along with code run inside LocalComputer container). \ntask is needed only when optional flag use_task_resources is set - it would make sense if instead of setting this flag to True/False, user would set it to Task/None.\ntask parameter is also used in TaskTester, when the method after_test is called - it should be easily refactorable too.. Closed in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1370. @badb What was the reason for introducing both TaskManager.task_status and TaskState.status?. EDIT: @marmistrz which FIXME are you talking about in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1374#issuecomment-330790623?. It appears that they are indeed used mostly in tests:\n - for dummytask, defaults are used to build test task for benchmark, but the benchmark isn't used anywhere\n - for renderingtask, only two fields are used, defaults.min_subtasks and defaults.max_subtasks - and used input is checked against them (which doesn't make much sense IMO, since they should be default values, not limiting values. In other words, removing them from here would make things better. The same situation happens in framerenderingtasks.calculate_subtasks_count, although it also uses defaults.default_subtasks.\n - luxrendertask doesn't use them, except for the inherited method of renderingtask. In particular,main program_file is not used anywhere (everything uses LuxEnvironment.main_program_file directly)\n - blendertask - as above.\n - for coretask, defaults in construction of CoreTaskBuilder.build_minimal_definition, to get main_program_file.\n - TaskTypeInfo.defaults are only used to do the thing above\nSo, it seems refactor should be relatively easy, except for the question where to store default/min/max subtasks.\n@badb ?. Fixed. Closing - it was decided that messaging should be done by sockets, and this required replacing majority of code here, so the change will be introduced in another PR.. No, on buildbot they were passing fine, and after merge they are passing locally too.\nClosing.. Right, I haven't spotted the pyssim dependency. But it seems that it is only used in docker and in imgverifier.py - which I think is dead code (no unit tests break, I am able to act both as a provider and requestor after deleting this code).\nBut it would be better if @badb confirmed that.. In golem-verificator, it is used in lux_verifier.py. So it seems that it is actually not possible to drop scipy, without dropping support for lux verification.. They were, I think it's fixed now. Fixed. Fixed, changed to isdir. No, a mistake with commit. All logs deleted now.. No, I left it here for \"educational\" purposes (so if someone is swapping his own code in place of computation.py and is trying to modify the docker script, he will notice that there is this WORK_DIR waiting for him to be used). Done. TODO was actually about removing old-style print and replacing with new style print(). Same as below, \"educational\" purposes. Done. Done. I didn't know if the function should raise Exception or just log the event and go on.\nWhat do you think?\n@badb ?. Same as above. Done. Done. Done. Please fix length of those lines. I think it's clearer to do that this way (each message type has its own response function, see dict in the tasksession.py/__set_msg_interpretations) than including a flag indicating which way is the message going, then checking for that flag in the response function and calling appropriate function on that.. Yes, I didn't know where to put it.\nShould I create a gist for that and include the link in the code, or create an issue with \"messaging integration test\" and include it there?\nI left this code because if we were to write integration tests in the near future (and I think something like messaging should be tested in that way), this code may be used for that.. Full type checker is disabled at default (see enforce.config({'groups': {'set': {'dummy': False}}}) at the end of the file), but it can be useful during tests. Type checker like mypy can't rule out all the bugs in the types in the dynamic typed language like Python, so it is useful to do a test run before release/merging PR/etc with all types checked in the runtime, see if everything works ok, and then disable it in the production.. Fixed. Fixed. Fixed. Fixed. Fixed. There is a tool that automatically, continually executes tests for code that changed- https://github.com/tarpas/pytest-testmon, and .testmondata are temporary files used by this tool to mark what was changed.. Unfortunately, yes.. It was used in two places - and since crossbar errors are sometimes quite difficult to debug, IMO it is better to keep additional constant then to spend time trying to fix potential issues stemming from code duplication later on.. IOError is the same thing as OSError.\nHow can ValueError be thrown in this situation?. Fixed.. With method verification_finished in CoreTask.. Fixed.. Fixed.. Fixed.. Fixed.. Fixed.. Switched names (verification_finished_ parameter to verification_finished and internal apps.core.task.coretask.CoreTask.computation_finished() function verification_finished to verification_finished_)..

I believe this is working correctly now.. > Does this resolve #1504 ? in this case its better to change the initial comment to \"resolves\" over \"addresses\" since github will auto-close\nTIL. FWIW I resolved the conflicts in #1665. This is no longer relevant.. Doesn't seem to happen anymore after #1608\nJust to extra sure I changed the price calculations not to use floats #1729. The code responsible for these errors doesn't exist anymore. Closing.. Closing as this shouldn't be happening anymore.. Geth servers are more stable now. Fixed by #1772. @kascheri12 Looks like this is what was happening:\nYou created a large task that resulted in number of payments.\nWe tried to add them for sendout one by one.\nFor each added payment we reserve some amount of ETH for gas.\nAfter a couple of added payments it looks like you're short on ETH for gas so we don't add any more payments (those are these Low ETH available messages in the logs).\nWe make this single sendout and update balances.\nThen when you restart the node we read remaining payments from the db and try to add them again for sendout - this time you have enough ETH for a couple of more payments, so we add them, but the cycle happens again.\nThere are two issues here:\n1. Looks like we were overestimating gas cost by quite a lot (from your logs it seems a single transaction used about 0.001 and your balance was 0.01, thus we should be able to send more payments). This logic has been improved recently, so you may want to re-test it.\n2. Even if we run out of gas, but later we top up the account we should detect that automatically and add pending payments without the need of restarting the node. This is indeed something we need to implement.. The linked PR fixes this.. FWIW, https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4251#issuecomment-279117184 makes this error go away (it's a workaround, not a solution though). @jiivan As far as I can tell we have two timeout checks: one for pending (non verified) connection in tcpserver and second in p2p_service for verified connections. So we should be covered.. @etam floats are evil in general, I dunno an explicit comment here is valuable. Fixed by #1731 . I'll let myself merge it. Done in #1771. @jiivan Depends on what you want to test. We mock geth client in the tests anyway, so the only thing that seems like sort of worth testing is whether block=pending is being passed to getTransactionCount. I can add it but I don't think is has great positive value :). SCI module is taking care of that.. This error - Failed to verify method signature - isn't connected to the value of RandVal, it checks the signature and doesn't look at the rest of the message. Here it would mean that the RandVal message has been incorrectly signed, but it could happen to any other message as well.\nWhile I agree floats cannot be trusted in general, the problem here is of a different nature. You don't know the original value of rand_val so you can't tell whether 00001 was \"additional\". Please rename this issue and ideally provide more details next time you see it (like pub/priv keys of the sender node and the signature itself).. This is happening to me consistently with other message types as well\nINFO     [golem.network.transport.session    ] Failed to verify message signature (Peers(timestamp=1514454880.48068, encrypted=True, sig=b'P?\\x11\\x89\\xfa9\\x94\\x91\\x18\\xc6\\x16\\xe4g\\xa9\\x95`\\x13\\xb0\\xf7r\\xe94B6\\xc9\\n\\xba\\xf5\\xf3w\\xc8e\\x1c\\xdc\\xfc\\xa5\\x0b\\n\\x19z_<\\x95\\x0e\\xdd\\xcb+A\\x870+\\xeb\\xc5#\\x80\\x82\\xa1s\\xb9B\\x1e\\xf5\\x99y\\x00', slots=[['peers', [{'node': <golem.network.p2p.node.Node object at 0x7fd96034b278>, 'port': 40103, 'id': 'f6a48d728cb05d53fd30fa96f67f2353aa7641576ddbc3991605554f9a279566bff97f064485c4c0aae65aec17b2bc294b6dced73338947df1ff0ade4ae6b78d', 'address': '10.30.10.101', 'node_name': 'igor'}]]]) from 127.0.0.1:56770)\nI believe this is regression introduced by https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/commit/c90519a79e47a08f7a6195e4ad38d2914df496e2\nI checked a commit before this one and it doesn't reproduce.\nPassing to @jiivan to investigate.. You can reproduce it using two local nodes with the same golem-messages version, so nope, this isn't related to incompatible versions.\nPlease close the issues only after checking (yourself or confirming with the reporting person) the issue has been resolved.. @chfast What you described is not really a solution. Yes, we can detect whether the account has been used externally, but only after the fact, so we need to be prepared to handle reality being different from what we expect.\nFrom the other side, even we would be able to provide such guarantee then these checks are even more useless - since we wouldn't be allowing to submit a task without enough funds to pay for it.. > Shippable failed. Is this caused by ignoring noqa comments or something else?\nThat was because of the long import statements, hopefully this is fixed now.. This isn't a bug. We are using https://github.com/locals-world/locals-faucetserver for our faucet server and as you can see error code 403 means that the queue is full, but might become available later. (but I definitely agree that returning error code 403 doesn't look friendly for non actual error)\nThis issue become more common recently since the demand increased and our faucet is constantly under high load, I'll see what we can do here.\nRemoving the bug tag though.. Mitigated the issue so it happens less often, but we can't resolve it completely at the moment.. @mfranciszkiewicz \nCreated #1855 for that. Pylint will remain sad because I can't do much about those errors\n E: tests/golem/transactions/ethereum/test_ethereumtransactionsystem.py:100:19: Instance of 'PaymentProcessor' has no '_PaymentProcessor__client' member (no-member)\n(or can I)?. I guess we could update pylint https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/1643. > Use _client instead of __client?\nI'm aiming to remove Client from PaymentProcessor altogether so this will resolve itself anyway.. Having two lists for denied and allowed users and both of them being non empty feels weird.\nSomething like one list with the list of specified users and a mode (deny/allow) would be cleaner imo.\nNot insisting though, so if it's too much to change then I'm good.. @etam Not yet, as all this class does is forward calls to Token and Client which are tested. But as soon as I move it to a separate repo I start covering it with tests.. > So after this we assume that the only thing that user can do with GNT is convert it to GNTW?\nI wouldn't say that's gonna be the case after this PR. it was always the case with GNTW. . Not gonna happen after #1986. Not gonna happen after #1986. @mdtanrikulu Could you check whether UI is handling timezones properly? The timestamps are always in Unix epoch.. Archaic version. Archaic version. Not relevant anymore. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3482. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3482. @etam Maybe, maybe. If you have any other ideas how to provide functionality of storing some data between consecutive golem runs, please share. This is just what I came up with @mfranciszkiewicz yesterday which sounded good enough.. Done. mypy is sad because it thinks it can do static analysis but it can't. I was referring to the only one error caused by this PR which is this one:\n\ngolem/ethereum/paymentprocessor.py:183: error: Unsupported left operand type for - (\"None\")\n\nWhile your solution will work I don't think it's valid to just assume this variable will always be None.. Fixed in a way where mapping connections is consistent, i.e. requests from same IP address will go to the same geth instance which solves this issue.\nAdding the proxy in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2332. Root cause described here: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-smart-contracts-interface/issues/5\nClosing this one in favor of the above.. Good point.\nI wanted to move all web3 stuff into golem_sci, so this project only uses high level methods like new_sci_rpc/new_sci_ipc and doesn't have to create providers and Web3 objects. It's not strictly required for anything, it was meant to be a simplification. I'll go with a different approach.. Yeah, I meant to change it to something else but didn't have a chance yet. Will do it another time.. > Is there an issue to borrow @jiivan's setup and deploy this package like golem-messages?\nNo, I just haven't done it yet :). @mfranciszkiewicz I was thinking of either using CLI or passing the password via command line arguments (for developers mainly) or passing the password via env variable.. The goal is to have encrypted wallet on the disk as well, so providing a password is mandatory.. I just made successful batch transfer so at least we know those upgrades don't break basic functionalities :). How is uuid1 better here instead of uuid4? Since we need to use sender_node's ID anyway when working with subtask IDs.. My reasoning is that this scenario either:\n- will not happen in mainnet at all\n- will happen in mainnet and handling it should be muuuuuch more carefully done, including informing the user about backup, why the address has changed, why they lost all theirs reputation etc\nSecond case is obviously much more complicated but we don't plan supporting that at the moment, so we're fine with 1. In which case exceptions are fine. For testnet we can just ask users to uninstall previous golem version before installing new one which we has done in the past iirc.\nAnyway, I don't really need this change, I just thought it'd be clearer this way.. fwiw, this PR alone is ready for review and even merging.. This should be implemented in smart-contracts-interface. @mfranciszkiewicz I'm fine with taking this task over if you like.. This is done. Looks like it will be fixed by #2268. This is done. So it's easier to review\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2289/files#diff-1bef601c50a4151f88f0ecda16e1aa10. \n. I wouldn't say that change resolves any of those two mentioned issues.\n~In case of #1926 this change makes it even worse. This issue is about making sure that single requestor won't generate two identical IDs. When creating new subtask Golem should check that it's ID hasn't been used previously, simply by checking the DB.~\nOk, I didn't realize uuid1 encodes current timestamp with quite large precision. In that case it makes it reasonable here.\nAnd in case of #2211 it's about making sure that we use pair requestor_id, subtask_id when identifying subtasks. Using uuid1 instead of uuid4 doesn't change anything in this regard.\n. @mfranciszkiewicz Yeah, just did :). Ping. Done. @etam \n\nI think that, like in geth, mainnet should be used by default and testnet used when requested by --testnet flag.\n\nI see your point, but mostly for our (golem devs) convenience it's better to make testnet the default for now. Main app will know to use the mainnet flag but devs may forget about testnet flag all the time.\nFWIW I made a poll in my room and all the votes were in favor for testnet to be the default :). > Just \"mainnet\" can also be some complicated class that represents the blockchain.\nThat's why we have type hints? Not every boolean variable has to have a prefix like that imo, and I'm a bit reluctant to add it here.. \n. cc @Wiezzel . This is annoyance of the current version of the web3 library we are using - it either makes you use unstable v4 version or will flood you with those warnings (in other words it's an example of how not to mark a method as deprecated).\nNot much to be done here at the moment.. - peer count is the geth's peer count and comes from golem_sci. I guess it makes sense to decrease the severity of this log message\n- the interval is set to 13 seconds and should be of this magnitude for now - changing when the logs are displayed is better\n- yes. Which OS ?. Implementation in #2426. @mfranciszkiewicz Yeah, that'd be nice\n\n. No moar Lux. \nI'll let @etam take this :). tbh, test coverage of this code leaves a lot to be desired, since not a single test failed...\nI made an issue for it #2475. Removed in #3017. \n. @tworec That should be fixed by the linked PR. Do you mind confirming and closing if it's resolved? . In favor of #2546. Hey, thanks for the report. \nGNTPaymentChannels represents work in progress and is far from being ready for deployment and use. Please see https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-contracts/issues/31\nClosing this issue in favor of the abovementioned.. @etam They aren't really. This is a leftover after I was considering a different approach where RPC calls to client would be enabled only after the client has started (which in general makes sense).. > If so, I think it should be in a separate pull request.\nVery well.. Maybe some other day.. Not relevant anymore. Done in #2856. Resolved in #2832. \n. >I'll give it a yes.\nI'd rather have some gif, but fine.. Done in #2894.

Resolved in 0.18.0. \n\n\nallow only https:// node addresses\n\nFWIW there's https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2750 to allow both http and https (there is no sensitive data here so http is fine too).. > Seems to be good, but tests are failing\naka \"the usual\". This is not exactly precise, will not merge it just yet.. Fixed in 0.16.1. Not a bug.. HMMM. Hi @Slavenin, this is expected as GNTDeposit is not yet available on mainnet (and Faucet will never be). Nothing to worry about.. This has been solved.. Nah, I made a mistake when creating the branch name :). Method removed in #3167. Fixed in #3080. Thank you for your well described report, but as far as I can guess what this is about, we don't need supporting this.. Thank you for yet another detailed report, however I am forced to close this as I just checked and all contracts compile just fine on both solc v0.4.21 and solc v0.4.24 just like they used to.. I need to rethink that.. [*]. @maaktweluit Looks like it. > i think the py-ext rust lib can be part of the golem code-base, and the plain rust libraries should be published as crate.\nWhat's your reasoning for that?\nI don't see Rust stuff as an external generic library that Golem will use, but part of Golem which just happens to be written in Rust.. > But I also believe we should consider splitting the Golem codebase into separate repositories and crates/libraries as we move towards a more decoupled architecture.\nSeparate repos only make sense when there's absolute need for them, otherwise they only introduce annoying dependency management issues.\nWe're building an application not a library so moving a chunk of code to a separate repo just because it can be moved is not justified. \n\nThis depends, i had in mind they would also be used in for example Unlimited.\n\nI don't know how Unlimited is supposed to be related to Golem Core but if we end up sharing significant amount of code I think it could live in this repo as well. FWIW I also think Concent should live in this main repo as well - this would eliminate the need for golem-messages (which currently includes much more than just the messages, e.g. cryptography and protocol constants, so it's abused already), golem-smart-contracts-interface and golem-verificator (and most likely more in the future). Even golem-electon could be moved here - solving the RPC interface synchronization issues.\nNot saying we should do all of that right now, but that's my reasoning why Rust should stay in this repo.\nA nice read on this topic: https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext\n. Fixed in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3294. That's gonna impact the processing time of the create task request which will need to include time for confirming the transaction. And that can be long. Iirc @jamuszyn was working on some mitigation for this from the UX POV. I dunno if we wanna merge this change just yet.. Resolved in #3407. Same error as in #3237 - and hopefully already fixed, closing.. @Wiezzel Sorry, I meant to answer you:\n\nWhat about moving self.num_tasks_received += 1 to CoreTask as well?\n\nI wanted to do that, but then I thought that it looks innocent but may spark a larger discussion that I didn't want to conduct in this PR so I sticked to my original change (since I wanted to clean up the usage of TaskClient and not do general clean up). But otherwise yeah, this can be done.. Does anybody understand the PR that caused these issues in the first place and could explain it to me?\nBecause this looks like a bandaid solution to what seems like not properly designed \"solution\" to some other problem. Since when RPC connections require access to some local internals of the remote side?\nWhat is happening here? . @Wiezzel Before computation_failed was overridden in derived classes so if I wanted to add this extra param I would need to add it everywhere. And I think it's not really relevant for derived classes. \nCurrent approach solves that. But still, I'm happy to find a better one.. After offline discussion with @lukasz-glen OfferCancelled shouldn't be treated any differently than other reasons, so these changes are not required.. Only after my last commit I actually understood your question.\nShould it be tracked by the marketplace module? Right now I just implemented it simply in the TaskServer. I can't find any requestor selection algorithm for providers in the marketplace doc so I dunno it should belong in the markerplace module.. Root cause: #3370\nIn other words this happens when all subtasks are marked as finished but the task itself is not.. @mplebanski \n\nMy node is brand new (fresh datadir).\n\nYour logs suggest this is not a fresh datadir at all. . - keys already exist (they are not generated)\n- initial balance is not 0\n- and the main culprit of this error - fundslocker restores task locks, meaning task lock existed before this run. @mplebanski \nJust remove fundslockerv2.pickle file until the root issue is resolved.. Disregard my previous comment about merging to develop - I guess there'll be fewer conflicts while keeping everything in the feature branch.\nOne question though: what exactly is considered idle time here? I'm thinking that anytime that has_assigned_task = False - is that right?. How about persistance? isn't it needed?. I somewhat prefer explicit exception in cases like this - after all you're not supposed to run a benchmark on an env that you don't support.\nWhy not just fix electron instead?. @maaktweluit @mfranciszkiewicz This is ready for review now.. @etam \nI removed all those comments via script so didn't cover those special cases.. Doesn't apply anymore. @maaktweluit Yeah, I'm not removing short_desc completely (that'd include removing it from ComputeTaskDefinition), this is just that TaskThread doesn't use it at all, so this is obviously useless. . @Wiezzel It limits to 6 by default, so no need for that.. Anybody knows what is Windows upset about?. Is this still relevant? If not please close.. Assuming no.. Is there anything that stops it from being merged?. Possibly related #2725. node_name issue is fixed in the linked PR and missing task in tasks show is a result of a new feature from https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3543. Concent methods should not be called when Concent is not enabled and there should be code in place to guarantee that. Wasting real money on a no-op contract just because is a no go.\nEven after Concent contract is deployed on mainnet there will be an option to run Golem on testnet with Concent disabled and in this case we shouldn't be calling any Concent methods as well.. @maaktweluit \n\n. @Wiezzel Yes.. But in a separate PR.. Meh, root_path is used in one random place. Why not publish the images before merging?. Payments stuff looks good, leaving the rest to @jiivan . \n. @jiivan Somewhat. This change requires an ability to use Docker on macos/windows buildbots, something that is not supported right now, but @maaktweluit is looking into that.. @maaktweluit Right, these tests are also failing for me on develop so I just removed \"fixme\" and see what happens. I might have broken environment :). Why not?. @ANDREYDEN Click on details link next to the failed tests then see what tests have failed - you'll get the filepath of the test then you should be able to find Client usage there and modify it appropriately.. @ANDREYDEN Sorry about the confusion but it turns out that geth_address not being used is a bug and instead it should override the default value from the config provided here https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/develop/golem/node.py#L107\nSo we don't want to remove it after all, but start using again. If you don't mind changing your PR to reflect this, it'd be great.. Sorry, there's a bug in the code and the proper fix isn't just removing this argument. This doesn't qualify as a good first issue anymore as it is a bit more complicated and has to be fixed before the next release. Feel free to pick up another issue though :). Scope has changed, see linked issue for details.. It's more like \"missing error messages when an exception is raised in Node::_setup_client\" which is not related to nonces in particular nor golemfactory/golem-smart-contracts-interface#37. For _set_env_params in tasksession except that now we can get it from the message itself instead of our local state.. @mfranciszkiewicz There won't be custom price field in TTC as it's redundant, the mentioned PR was supposed to do that but needs to be updated.. Also closes #3772. \n. ping @magdasta @nieznanysprawiciel . That should be pretty much possible at this point with little or no changes needed in the transaction system.. Isn't this the issue basically? https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/develop/golem/testutils.py#L43-L47. Any progress on that?. Closing in favor of https://github.com/golemfactory/blenderapp/pull/1. @mfranciszkiewicz And what if they do? This kind of thing won't be supported so what's the reason for delaying?. @mfranciszkiewicz Why can't it be uploaded?. That sounds like something that should be configured in the runtime rather than built into the Docker image, though. Otherwise images tagged under the same name will be essentially completely different on different hosts which contradicts the idea of consistent Docker images, doesn't it?. @blue Apps were never meant to live inside the same repo. @jiivan \n\n. self.encrypted, self.sig and self._payload don't need to exist.\nThey are only set and used during serialization, we can just used them there locally.. I might be missing something but is it used?. I believe this doesn't have to be exposed anymore.\nAnd by making it an internal method we can get rid of the properties I mentioned in the other comment. It's used three times and in one place you put a comment explaining what it is so might be worth using an actual constant.\nSomething like SIG_LEN = 65 shouldn't hurt legibility too much\n. I think it'd be nice if we'd get rid of DataBuffer here. That would mean removing deserialize method and leaving only deserialize_message which doesn't depend on DataBuffer. deserialize is only used in tcpnetwork.py and that's where DataBuffer logic should live. You already did pretty much the same with decrypt_and_deserialize so removing DataBuffer dependency altogether would be nice.. I believe ordered[:expected_n] should be used here, right?\nSame for the line 56.\nDoes it mean you added some buffer because otherwise it doesn't work? Could you check whether it works with fixes from #1474? Otherwise this is something to investigate. Feel free to commit it as it is and I'll update it in #1474.. Do you mean something more fancy than lines 399-402 in test_paymentprocessor.py added in this commit?. I dunno, if MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE means we want to reject massages longer than this then it can happen that we will receive half of message of length 3/4*MAX then the other half + another message of length 1/2*MAX. Both messages are under MAX but total number of bytes in the buffer is larger than MAX.\nWe can of course change it so we won't allow buffer to be larger than some maximum size, but current approach is fine as well imo.. This message won't be seen by the end user so this PR doesn't fully addresses #1430, right? Any follow up for that?. Log an error message? This is not expected after all. msg.port is already an int I believe, no need to cast it. Good point, in that case probably peeking len and checking against MAX is the way to go. else return 0 ? Or is None expected?. else return 0, to comply with type annotation. I'd say others should return 0 as well, but I'm not sure whether that's the intention here. If task is not supported but there isn't task_archiver then we'll fall into else branch and add the task which isn't right. I'd say blacklisted requestor should have higher priority than max price threshold. So it shouldn't be overridden in the next if block. camel_case. No need for task_achiever=None, we can just use the default (in the whole file). More compact, much less legible, less efficient (alpha is usually small). Imo not worth it.. This is Python and I feel safer checking against None explicitly. ditto. There are 14 instances of MagickMock in this file, I'd rather not add noise in this commit by changing them. Why won't make you a release instead of this custom 20_msgprefix tag?. What stops you from making the release before this PR is accepted?. It is, but I'm not gonna change it in this PR since this is quite unrelated.. Yeah, I tried using generator but came with those exact conclusions. And I don't think storing generator is more legible than the current version.. I like it but it's slightly inferior to the above because self.seeds can change between calls to _get_next_random_seed and you'll end up connecting to a seed which you know you shouldn't.. :(. In whichever you imagine since this is Python. But seriously it is in wei equivalent for GNT. string. bid = 1 means 1 GNT. computation_time is in seconds so is supposed to be an int. I'll check that, but I wouldn't trust documentation much tbh.. computation_time originally comes from the the UI in the form of \"00:10:00\" for 10minutes.\nThen it gets converted to seconds using golem.core.common.string_to_timeout which returns an integer. Should be fine.\n. True, but is it really necessary to request changes for such minor thing?. We probably have different conventions but I request changes when I'm not fine with committing the changes the way they are, and would just approve them if my only concerns are not impactful in any way like this one (it's a harmless comment after all).\nContext switching for responding to such a minor is usually not worth it.. True, but since this is a fix for a bug in current master branch I'd rather not make irrelevant changes to it.. Don't get me wrong, I agree with your points and would usually apply them, but for small concrete bug fixes like this one I'm reluctant to do such things.. As I understand this a way to check and we returned early from the function and didn't send anything to Concent.\nThis check depends on this particular implementation, more natural check would be a check against self.concent_service.submit not being called, since this is the side effect that should not happen.. Why is this needed ?. s/succes/success/. I don't know the internals of how python tests work, but I understand that each test is not run in a separate process and we need to perform cleanup of the global state after each test?. I think we update the balances every 13 seconds or so. A value of 30 seconds might be more appropriate I guess.. Imo an empty list is also a valid return value for the above call, so this should be fine. Do you have anything else in mind?. I'd rather not reduce var names' legibility in favor of shorter lines, but I'm open to suggestions here. Right. This is simpler.. > SQLite does not have a native date type, so dates are stored in formatted text columns.\nI'd rather stay with integers. What do you mean? It tests whether timestamp field has been set on payment during the PaymentProcessor::add call.. It isn't, it tests exactly the lines of code I've added here:\nts = int(time.time())\n            with Payment._meta.database.transaction():\n                payment.timestamp = ts\n                payment.save()\nThis test will fail if those fail to execute. Why do you think it's too low level?. I looked at the freezegun package and correct me if I'm wrong but you need to specify the time in human readable format, can't just provide a unix timestamp? Which would make this test less clear about what it's doing.. Oh, yeah, definitely. I'll # noqa it :P. Relevant?. one line?. Why is it removed?. I can't find it - where can_be_unsigned is respected?. This is inside a lock. It'd be better if we would stop here (and in other react_to_hello) if messages versions do not match, so it should return boolean or something. Maybe a separate method with descriptive name (like check_version_compability) would be better\n  . log it?. rm. this is repeated all over, helper function would be nice. a check whether DisconnectMessage was sent could be useful too. Why did you decide to use exceptions here? This function is supposed to check whether the versions are compatible, it's way more natural for it to return boolean. It not really unexpected when the versions don't match so no exceptions should be used here. Looks like the only use of this exception is to return a string with the message.\n  . That is the plan. This is currently replicating the existing logic where we also don't query by sender_node and I'm planning to change it in a separate PR. AFAICT even querying by (sender_node, subtask_id) is not safe at the moment, since sender doesn't guarantee subtask_ids will be unique. (which is again something I'll improve soon). self.AssertEqual and family are preferable since they give much better errors messages compared to these simple asserts . I understand that Path is os aware and datadir / DENY_LIST_NAME will use \\ for Windows?. Because of get_incomes_from_block which is token dependent.. Huh, I must have been blind because I thought the messages are not descriptive. TIL. I plan to make number of changes to refactor and clean this up so these will get sorted out.\nThis PR is just to move everything in one place.. I think the BlenderVerifier, self part is no longer needed. ditto. Why is that?. When callback is not equal to self.verification_completed?. I'm not familiar with this code, but where is the asynchronous part? I just followed the flow of the start_verification and can't find where it does anything asynchronously.. What's wrong with mock ?. crop_min is an int, for consistency you should vase crop_max to an int as well. I don't see there self.crop_id is used outside the constructor. That could be class \"constant\". Bump it to 22, as current develop is 21. What is this self.task_server check for? I don't see task_server being used anywhere here explicitly so feels like this check either doesn't matter or should be somewhere else. derp. maybe add a comment then, because it's not obvious. It's not. Since we are operating on batch transfers we do the mapping which transaction covers which incomes. received doesn't make much sense the way it is implemented right now. I'll change that to make it more clear.. Right, even accepted_ts IS NULL.. is_converting would be split into two methods and the usage would look like:\nif converter.is_converting():\n  converter.keep_converting()\nI dunno whether it's better. \nupdate_personal_deposit_address suggests modifying the state and imo it's fine to return bool to indicate whether something has been updated or not, what's the issue here?. I think you can do gnt_balance, _ = ... without the square brackets. these can be private (_ prefix). using a tuple instead of a list is better here. ditto (tuple instead of a list). that's not really clearer imo. nope. This PR is 400+ lines, I went through first 100 and most of them are style changes like this one.\nThis introduces a lot of noise to the PR and makes it really unclear which changes are important which results in more difficult review process.\nAlso these changes are counter productive - personally I prefer the style on the left, it's more flexible when new stuff needs to be added and the indent size is consistent. But if others have different preferences then we should come up with a single convention for the whole team to avoid going back and forth all the time.\nPlease revert all unnecessary style changes from this PR to make it more legible.. Since keys_auth is already typed I think self.keys_auth doesn't need to be typed separately unless the two types are different.. I find it odd that constructor of an object is blocking the calling thread, run is more explicit in this regard (but this is just my opinion).. afaik this step could be done asynchronously as well. _key_auth_ready is not thread safe with _rpc_router_ready. Those two methods can be called in parallel and it is possible that both will end up calling self._setup_client().\nSee my other comment on an alternative approach.\n. Alternatively and in a thread safe way we could make these _setup_* methods return deferred objects, collect them (check out DeferredList) and only then call _setup_client.. Why private _start_node instead of previously used start?. I usually like to reduce indentation if do\nif not self._use_docker_manager:\n  return None\n<rest of the code>. I don't know if it's the case right now (doesn't look like it) but we should stop reactor and exit application if any of the setup steps is unsuccessful.. Pardon my ignorance but why is it better compared to self.key_id = in the constructor? Doesn't it make it possible to access it via BasicSafeSession.key_id which is useless (i.e. class vs object member)?. \n. Other statuses start with a capital letter. Too much hassle for too little benefit.. :(. What's >>?. Can you use vargs instead of & ? Like in the lines 32-35? It'd increase readability.. not the greatest method name for what it does. How about Income.transaction.is_null()?. It's be great to be consistent at least in a single file with conventions like that.\nAlso you get to get rid of one noisy parenthesis.. Would it be possible to somehow override this constant in testutils.TempDirFixture::setUp? Then everything would so much easier.. A small comment explaining why, like KeysAuth uses it but by default it takes too long which is unnecessary for tests blah balh. No need for log message if you're throwing an exception - it's gonna be caught somewhere and logged anyway. Can you check whethe rlines 24-36 are still needed after the patching in TempDirFixture ?. I'd leave this one as it may or may not be called from unit test env.. Actually this should be a bit more complicated otherwise check_payments is called every X seconds and we will just keep decreasing the trust infinitely for a single payment.\nI feel like bool overdue column in the Incomes table should come to life.. Then it will crash the process and be logged on the stderr anyway, right?. The way it works is that test_dummy is in the unittest env, patches this method then calls run_simulation which spawns new processes for the clients, meaning that this particular call is executed not in the unittest env anymore, thus this method is not patched.\nI think that's the case, not 100% sure so you can always just run it and see.. So it's silently swallowed? That doesn't sound right. This won't be needed after #2281. I second that. I'd just ignore it for now. We can show it in the UI as a separate status.. Awesome, I was always disgusted by the previous implementation but never got to change it :P. Can I have it back? I actually use it in my PR.. Hard to tell for me whether they are actually no used (yay Python), so I assume you tested it e2e?. huh ?. I introduced WrongPasswordException because I'm actually catching it, I dunno if there's need for specialized exception types for those two other errors.\n. I don't fully understand meaning of this variable. When can it be false? When we received SIGINT just after reactor has started and we haven't reached this point yet, right? In which case we won't abort the while loop. What am I missing?. This mainly includes method/contract name changes.\nReal changes are in the contracts' code which translates to bytecode in the above commit.\nSo the answer is not really because there's not much to review, the actual stuff has been reviewed (yet in another repo (golem-contracts)).. You're welcome to take a look though :)\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem-smart-contracts-interface/pull/13. That looks sketchy and should be resolved on the unit tests level.\nHow about introducing a method like should_stop_generating_key which returns whether reactor is running and can be mocked in tests to simply return true?. No, this is future proof if the defaults change in future and cause long processing again.. I'm not gonna insist on changing that but want to stress my points again:\n1. This is prone to race condition I mentioned, where we receive SIGINT and stop reactor before setting this value, this the loop won't break.\n2. I find it bad practice to put some code in production code just to make the tests pass, as you mentioned it indicated bad design. But if we decide to go this route then an explanatory comment would be beneficial as there might be other people like me wondering what this variable is for and trying to remove it, because it looks unnecessary - just to find out later that it breaks all the tests for some reason.. \n. I wonder, in line 29 we use get_timestamp_utc and here it's time.time and those two aren't guaranteed to be the same. Maybe change this one to get_timestamp_utc as well.. datetime.now doesn't use time.time.. I'm not gonna dig into whether _time is the same as time but the point is, time.time return seconds from epoch while get_timestamp_utc returns seconds from unix epoch, where epoch is system defined and unix epoch is not.. What's 6 ?. This really introduces unnecessary dependency (transaction system depends on tasks, in compilable languages that would be even more explicit and unnecessary).\nImo it's better to just use get_balance to get available GNT and perform this if check in golem/client.py.. rm. It's not thrown anywhere in the transactions.ethereum module, I doubt it belongs here in that case. why is this needed now?. If using real keysauth is to stay in setUp then it's not required anymore I believe . num_batches is confusing, it's cost for a single batch which contains multiple payments. PER_PAYMENT. So these 3 methods are now purely for tests? If that's case then it shouldn't be the case imo.. When, what's the plan here?. This function doesn't seem to be used according to grep. No :). Done. Bad comma?. What about show_terms ?. Add versioning of the terms. That shouldn't run for testnet. rm ?. The timeout should be higher, IIRC generating new key averages on 2 minutes, but p95 is 8minutes. And even recently @Elfoniok had to wait ~6minutes :)\nThis timeout is pretty harmless so might be like 10 minutes or more as well.. You know it changes blame, right? So unnecessary is actually removal of this comma. And in general commas like this help preserve blame.. I wouldn't really mind if all these terms related logic would be in a separate class, since this a completely separate piece of logic. Having TERMS_* constants in this class feels weird.. Having it in a separate file would also be fine. Yeah. This and all other self.assert*s can be replaced with simple assert not bool etc which are clearer. use self.tempdir, /tmp won't work on Windows for instance. Might be neat if we limit the number of decimal digits to 4 or something like that, so we don't show 18 decimals.. Actually that path should also be a constant in the Terms class. Is start_node=True needed here?. yes, we do\nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] ETH: 0.019917198 \nINFO     [golem.pay                          ] GNT: 1000.0 GNTB: 0.8922222222222222\nFor ETH it happens that the balance will always have up to 9 decimals (because gas cost is in gwei = 10^9). But for GNT it's like above.. just do amount-lock, no need for transaction_system.withdraw to be aware of any \"locks\". \n. Oh yeah, I realized my comment doesn't actually make any sense. The current approach is correct.. Could we just remove it from the DB instead ? It might be better for now (until we have Concent), instead of permanently showing it in the GUI as awaiting.. I dunno if rejected correctly describes it, maybe just overdue ?. \nYeah, I realized immediately after pushing, it's fixed now.. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2463/files\nPython's stuff I guess. same as DockerManager.MAINNET = mainnet. I'm not really familiar with this code but this seems a bit suspicious that AppsManager is created both in Node and here. Wouldn't it make sense here to receive it from Node ? (we wouldn't have to provide mainnet flag as well then). make a constant like REGISTERED_CONFIG_FILE. why is it needed? Seems weird that it's only required in tearDown without any changes in other places. you don't need that, do you?. This will make a bunch of tests (test_client) unhappy. Right, github collapsed ~200 lines between these changes and I didn't the context change, derp.. snake_case convention\nalso I think it'd be better to make it private and just make load_all_apps do nothing if it's already loaded. on the other hand, do you really need that? At this point the apps have already been loaded\nmaybe except for the tests, but then it should be fixed in the tests, not like this. typo. \n. rm whitespace. warning? duuu?. As far as I understand these aren't # of files but total size of them, so these labels are not accurate. I don't see how the dict could be altered in this loop.\nAre you sure the error you're trying to fix isn't caused by a race condition?. So it's a race condition then. And making a shallow copy doesn't actually fix it - initial dict can still be altered while making the copy.\nProtecting this object with mutex is a way to go.. > Either way, this fix produces a preview that reflects the state at the moment of calling.\nMaking a shallow copy of a dict is not an atomic operation, so this change doesn't really fix this race condition - only slightly reduces the probability of occurring.  . My only concern is that c = dict(d) doesn't have to an atomic operation. It happens that under CPython it is - but this is really implementation dependent and I believe it's not enforced by Python's standard, so it's not something we should rely on.\nSo yes, in CPython this in fact solves the issue. The same could be achieved using a mutex which would work regardless on Python's implementation.\nI assume that the probability of anyone running Golem using a Python implementation where it isn't safe is negligible, so we can use this fix, but please put an explanatory comment in the code. \n. How about making it a proper unit test by mocking out the SenderThread and checking whether send was called with proper args?. Yes. Inside sci.batch_transfer. Yeah, previous estimation wasn't accounting for multiple payments to a single provider, current version does so the check is performed in a different way.. I'd rather not import this and just use whatever for the constants, it's an unnecessary dependency here.. this doesn't exist anymore. this also doesn't need to set actually. just use whatever here, this is not the subject of the test anyway. Why do you remove these checks? They are still useful so the provider doesn't even bother requestor unnecessarily.. I know, I'm saying that they are still useful on the provider side.. Oh, this is still requestor side. So my point is that these checks could be beneficial on the provider side as well.. Also, max_resource_size and max_memory_size are no longer needed in this method.\nI'd also look into why estimated_performance and num_cores is needed. sci.get_eth_address returns the address so use that instead of sci._address. I don't see it being used anywhere else so either make it private or just inline below since it's quite simple anyway. _gnt_available gives you GNT+GNTB so later when you try to call deposit_payment it may fail because there's not enough GNTB. This just sends the transaction to the network and it may take some time before it gets mined - do you care about that?\nThis may also throw if there isn't ETH for gas. Shouldn't it happen only when Concent is enabled ?. In general any time you feel like you need to access protected member in SCI just tell me - I'll either point you to the right direction or change the API appropriately if needed.. Let's not change that. This test checks whether the geth_address argument is correctly passed down the stack, not whether the argument itself is correct.\nSo instead of this and adding the other test test_geth_https_address_should_be_passed_to_node it should remain as it is and you may add a test for the parse_http_addr itself. I see that the tests/test_argsparser.py file is missing so feel free to add it and write a test checking whether it correctly parses both http and https.. Same as above, do not change it.. Nit picking but I find it confusing that requestor_deposit_amount is coming from the golem_messages module. Another thing: we shouldn't end up putting too much to the deposit, not to end up in a situation when we can't cover the task from the main balance. AFAICT right now you could transfer whole balance to the deposit and basically be forced to pay from the deposit instead of the usual batchTransfer. self.transaction_system cannot be None anymore (same applies to the if above). That doesn't account for GNTB that is locked in PaymentProcessor. just put return here. I didn't look closely at the whole PR but this looks fishy. Do you expect someone to set it to 1 and then run Golem? If not then it doesn't belong in the config file.. These are readonly, so I will use property indeed (not a personal fan of this solution, but I guess this is Pythonic way, so I'm fine).. This isn't needed.. Not needed.. A test for this method would be beneficial. Please spawn an info log message about the amount and including the tx hash. Since you introduce this property, can you make FundsLocker use it in the gnt_lock method?. This has to be total amount of locked funds from FundsLocker\nLet's say you have 100 GNT\nThen create a task for 5 GNT\nYou lock 5 GNT in FundsLocker\nYou make deposit for 20 GNT\nThen you create a task for 25 GNT\nYou lock 25 GNT in FundsLocker (with total of 30 GNT)\nYou want to make deposit for 80 (100 - 20), but have only 70 (100 - 5 - 25) available, so you make deposit for 70 GNT\nTotal deposit is 90 GNT, your balance is 10 GNT but you have tasks for 30 GNT\nPlease add tests for these cases.. Which test is it ?. How about just removing this line and changing line 127 to in_shutdown=0 ? afaict it should be fine.. node_name, node_address, eth_account, seed_host, seeds are all set to empty string literals so it's already inconsistent in this sense. \nI understand that all the values in this file are configuration properties of Golem and can be tweaked by the user if the need arises. While IS_SHUTDOWN is not something that is supposed to be changed by the user because it not really a configuration property, it's just a runtime boolean flag for proper execution.\nThat's why I find it fishy to put this property here but if it's the easiest then it shouldn't be exposed among other real configuration properties.. Yeah, just remove these lines, let's adjust test code to the production code, not the other way around and currently there's no production scenario where transaction_system is not set.. Not sure I get it. The way it is now you are able to withdraw full balance. GNT-GNTB conversion, I imagine this message could be shown to the user, so it's better to use vague background operations rather than GNTB conversion.. Maybe we should try to clarify what golem_messages actually is. My thinking so far was that it just provides all the messages (so simple structs basically) + some implementation helpers (like serialization), but it doesn't provide any constants/mechanisms defined by the protocol.\nBut looks like it's the former. I wonder whether that was intentional or just convenient, since it's a shared module between Golem and Concent.\nThe thing is that if these constants get changed it requires to bump the golem-messages version, since it's not backwards compatible. And that affects non Concent users even though they shouldn't be affected because the change has nothing to do with them. . This is the same as gntb_balance = self._gntb_balance but without an extra request to Geth. Why is it needed?. I dunno what's the current state of the uniqueness of the subtask ids, but bulletproof way of grabbing the correct income is using pair (sender, subtask_id), like in update_awaiting method.. Please don't do that. There's a reason for it.\nMake concent_deposit take a callback instead.. Since the goal is just to call ask_for_verification after there's enough GNT deposited I'd say you could move this one inside concent_deposit and hide the receipt check there.\nIn other words just invoke callback immediately if there's enough GNT otherwise use on_transaction_confirmed. And then you don't need to return tx_hash from concent_deposit as well.\nThe idea is that tasksession shouldn't really care about any blockchain implementation details, there belong in EthereumTransactionSystem better.. You need to divide this amount by denoms.ether. I think it makes sense to put else time.sleep(1) or something similar here, otherwise this loop may become wasteful active waiting loop (when msg is not None but timeout is not reached yet. @jiivan Your way changes the logic to send at most 1 message per time interval which wasn't the case before. I dunno what the requirements are for the monitor but I imagine there might be cases where we end up sending a bunch of messages at the same moment.\nAnother way I see is to just put None in the queue in the join method and break the above loop if we retrieve it from the queue (so 3 lines change).. How about not using magic string literals? :). Please add return types to all newly introduced methods. I think this could be a protected method.\nAlso I don't find this name descriptive (check in the name suggests boolean return imo) but can't come up with a better one. Maybe try_quit?. assert_called_once_with() even. Yeah, this is the log message and it easier to read 1 GNT instead of 1000000000000000000. But yeah. you don't need to, but it's way better. You don't need that anymore, right?. Fix return type. on_transaction_confirmed callbacks should not throw - there's no error handling for them. Just log the message (even with critical severity).. I've heard you first time you said that, but there are conventions and linters and we use them.. Why do you pass the receipt if it's not needed for anything ?. It's a test. I don't see production code using the receipt which is a code smell. Depending on what the test checks you can either assume the transaction was successful or check the deposit amount whether it increased this way knowing if it was successful.. Considering that you have to write disable-protected-access in our codebase when accessing things starting with a single underscore I think calling a method 'protected' is the right vocabulary.. If you use break here you can remove self.stop_request altogether. This allows multiple donations per single run when you run out of GNT. Although it's not exactly the logic I intended, lemme change that.. Not sure what you meant but if we ever change the threading model in Golem not to run everything from Twisted when many more places in Golem will have the same problem.. string. Calculating gnt_reserved requires ints. Also _fmt expects ints for division. mypy complains because p.status is of type PaymentStatusField so the assignment is not compatible. Yeah, but it doesn't really matter, does it? I aiming to get rid of these values anyway and replace them with more useful one (geth's last block number/timestamp). > That could be done by inserting a dot a a specific place in string. (I'm not saying it must, but could)\nWith value less than 10^18 it would be awkward.. Yeah, that wasn't me who introduced this code :). But yeah, these could be non magic numbers - someday.... s/requester/requestor/. nit: space after comma. Honest question: is there a guideline which says there should be space here? Neither my editor nor buildbot complain about the lack of space here, so I dunno.\n(also I didn't put the space here to make it consistent with line 249 where putting the space would exceed 80 characters per line :) ). Hm, the str cast in unnecessary even. I dunno, it was price before, either is fine. But also I'm aiming to change the way FundsLocker works altogether (as you might have noticed already) so this should't matter in the long run. Yeah, but as I mentioned when I'm finished with FundsLocker most of this stuff won't exist anymore so I didn't bother to fix it now :). No need for copy() anymore I guess. Oh yea, I dunno actually. I also don't have an idea what I'm doing. I assumed this is wrong based on the api and nomenclature and high likeliness of copy-paste bug from symmetrical increase_trust_payment. But I guess you're right, 0 doesn't make sense here.. Umm, endline characters are off?. What was that number and why it's gone ?. Why was that change needed ?. length=20 - it's an Ethereum address. You can use it in lines 305 and 319 for consistency as well.. Why the reorder? All other withdraw functions have amount first. I found the answer so nevermind. Now: copy payments by value in the loop, at the time callback is executed p has the expected value\nBefore: payments is just a pointer to values from sent map, after the loop is over it points to the last element and at the time callback is executed copy copies the last value from sent instead of the expected one.. I don't fully understand your question. I am rather sure my description is correct.\nWhat I don't know is why p=payments is enough instead of p=payments.copy(), but it is.\nFeel free to play with different approaches and use the corresponding test.. Locked ETH is calculated based on the _payments_locked variable.. Ditto. The value doesn't really matter and is not used anywhere else (as in changing this value doesn't trigger changing any other 10**9), that's why imo it's fine like this. . This is somewhat arbitrary as well but will use denoms.ether for clarity. Because pubkeytoaddr didn't return checksum'd address IncomesKeeper didn't match any incomes correctly from blockchain events (which contain checksum'd addresses). Thus many events have been processed without correctly marking incomes as confirmed. Changing this value is one way to enforce listening to all income events from the beginning of the blockchain which in turn will correctly mark the incomes as confirmed. . ETH for batch payments has two parts: base and per payment. This only adds the per payment part which for providers will be 0. The logic below checks whether the base should be added.. afaict there's no way one value will be None while other won't, so Optional[Tuple] looks like a better choice. task_dict['cost'], task_dict['fee'], *_ = \\ \nself.transaction_system.get_total_payment_for_subtasks(subtask_ids), None\nwould work then, but lets not do that :p\nI'm fine either way, was just nitpicking.\n. This isn't necessary and it's even harmful.\nIt's unnecessary because the line below calls update_overdue_incomes in the process.\nIt's harmful because with two consecutive update_overdue_incomes calls the second will always return an empty list, so the TRUST below won't get updated.. True, summoning @Wiezzel here. \nBut seriously this comment is useless. Are those needed?. Missing closing bracket . Don't use args and kwargs here, they are not required and greatly reduce legibility.. So, if provider is expecting 3 payments 1 GNT each and will receive 1.5 GNT from the requestor and then 1.5 GNT from Concent, one of the payments will still not be marked as done.. Remove it, it will be taken care of when blockchain event is detected (also this select is quite incorrect).. What is this supposed to be ?. It wasn't handled before. Also this is response on receiving ReportComputedTask so None here would indicate some major bug imo.. I dunno, we didn't until now apparently  :)\nBut this is also applies to the get_task_message above which is also not handled if it returns None.\nMight be worth changing that but it's outside of the scope of this PR.. I'm pretty sure I meant third-person singular imperfect indicative of bander here. \n. You're doing kwargs.get('sender', None) below which is completely unnecessary since sender will always be present in the arguments and that would be obvious if the arguments would be listed explicitly. Otherwise it raises questions like \"when sender is not in the args\" with the answer \"never\". This is the lack of legibility I'm talking about.. There's no way it's gonna be negative.. noice. value_received should be equal to value for confirmed incomes (those with transaction hash set). Is it possible to make it happen in this migration?. The field is requestor, not sender. Imo it's fine to repeat it every 5 seconds if you wanna. You could get rid of this indirect way by explicitly checking whether deposit is already greater than 0.. connect_to_network iterates over all KnownHosts and tries to connect to all of them. Can you confirm that trying to connect to 100 random nodes sequentially won't increase the startup time?. This has been removed in #3165. This magic isn't needed here, the following is imo more readable and more importantly greppable.\nif msg.recipient_type == requestor:\n  self.on_force_payment_committed_for_requestor\nelse:\n  on_force_payment_committed_for_provider. Why is it needed?. How about making get_available_gntb take an address argument and return sci.get_gntb_balance when address is provided and not equal to our address?. Address is not the same as public key. magic const ?. also timelock is a timestamp in the future or 0, so this check is invalid.. This can also return 0 which means that the deposit is not timelocked - so safe to use.\n. iirc the deposit timelock will be set to 48h, so using the same value as minimum is pointless.\nshouldn't this value depend on the task timeout for example?. rm? or reduce severity. 1. that should use private key from the transaction system\n2. and because of that the API should be different, transaction system won't be exposing its private key, instead it can provide a method to sign whatever you need. Hmmmmmm, good catch. Maybe it wasn't completely useless. Although I'm pretty sure working directory here could be simply set to /tmp/<whatever>, right?. If it's meant to be a singleton then in this particular case we don't even need to create an instance at all and have all the methods static.. I dunno if it's beneficial to have, it's not going to be used externally (or is it?) but adds an indirection when reading the code.. When do you expect to call this with more than one item?. Inconsistent with others key not in self. isn't it take_after ?. Also what is count? How is it gonna be used/chosen? I thought we will just pass all the offers to the algorithm? . what is this for?. Nvm, I think I get it now.. yeah, but what's the expected use case?. > Since it is safe to use and doesn't modify the pools, it became a part of the public interface.\nThat's not really the reason why something should be a part of the public interface - and that was my question: when this method is expected to be used externally?\nBecause as I mentioned I find this code hard to review without knowing/seeing the requirements.. I strongly believe there should be a clear use case in order to introduce a public method. Each public method adds a maintenance cost - as opposed to private method which you can modify as you wish at any time without any additional penalty.\n\nRefactor as you please.\n\nI doubt this is a proper response. It will be way more beneficial and less wasteful if we all agree on the same conventions that we're all gonna follow instead of changing the code to your liking any time you touch it.. Looks like my editor changed new line characters or something. It aims to use module__function_name style, it's of course arbitrary but since we're gonna have more modules in Rust I tried to make it legible (since module can also have underscores, so to avoid module_name_function_name). But we can use a different style.. Quite indeed.. afaict this isn't used anywhere. Transaction hashes are never conceptually used as integers so I find this counter-intuitive - they are just hex strings. . That will never be retried so it's better to just remove it completely imo. web3 will translate this dict into an exception anyway here https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py/blob/master/web3/manager.py#L112 so that won't help.. why do you need to patch it ?. same question. Yeah, no need for them anytime soon. And if they will ever be needed they can be obtained from tx hash anyway so there's no loss here.. I guess that's also the reason why the above patch exists?\nimo it'd be better to set proper node_id in the setUp - otherwise we might end up patching more and more functions like that (and in general I find it better to mock inputs in tests rather than random functions across whole codebase that happen to be inconvenient at the moment - you wouldn't be able to do it in civilized languages /r). . This is fine to check whether CI passes but should be changed to a proper version before merging.. Why is this needed? I have a feeling that ethereum public key shouldn't be necessary for resource handshake.. Yeah, I noticed it right after submitting the PR and fixed it already, I hoped nobody has noticed yet :P. Right, I got confused and thought this is some kind of Hello message instead of WantToComputetTask. tx_hash is 66 chars long (because of 0x prefix) while tx field has max_length=64. not used. sci returns hashes with 0x prefix. block_number doesn't exist anymore. it's already hex, isn't it ?. What pk stands for? Is it primary key? isn't it an internal stuff that doesn't need to be exposed? Transaction hash is also a primary key.. In cases like this I usually like to use strings like unittest_key_id so it's clearer in the logs what it is, since standalone a is not self explanatory.\nOr even use proper stub values, so like 64 hex characters here, because e.g. short_node_id('a') == 'aa' which isn't correct :)\nUp to you though . I may just misunderstand but why the return type isn't simply Optional[str]? . I don't think created and modified are used either - I know they exist in payments_list but probably shouldn't as well.. I'd make it a structured object instead of arbitrary dict, it'd be easier to deal with. And if to_unicode is really needed for whatever reason then it should happen in client since it's related to presentation layer which doesn't belong here (same for payments_list of course, so it's not a perfect base to follow).. I didn't suggest any kind of refactoring here. I'm just saying that TransactionSystem should return structured data, just list of model.DepositPayment is fine and all this to_unicode transformations should happen in the client.\nIn other words - why would transaction system convert all values to strings by default, what's the benefit? IE.g. f you'd need to calculate the sum of all deposits you'd need to convert values back to int.. 20 - 1 looks random. I believe this is gnt_balance - gnt_lock so please use those values instead.. ditto. If you wanna display price you probably wanna divide it by 10^18 (denoms.ether) for readability . instead of changing this function you could try to use set_environment from config.environments just golemapp does. You never know. I'm not attached to it but I like to keep consistent style everywhere.. Will do.. Imo we could just get rid of the default value. sci doesn't have concent_timelock method, make sci::get_deposit_locked_until return 0 and get get rid of the patch on test_check_payments method. Since this is run periodically it needs to check whether there isn't already ongoing withdrawal, otherwise many unnecessary transactions will be sent. what AppVeyor issues ?. Since you touched listen_* args: looks like they are not useful and they are used only in one place in TaskManager, so you may remove them completely. Either here or in a separate PR, if it'll turn out too big.. Upgrade sci to 1.6.1 to have this method. This is the only use of fake, I really doubt it's beneficial instead of having some arbitrary value hardcoded. When testing a specific class it's really better not to mock any of its method and mock dependencies instead. Just mock sci.get_deposit_value instead. Same as other comment.. These comments aren't useful imo. I don't think so. has_assigned_task is broader than is_computing (i.e. anytime is_computing=True => has_assigned_task=True. Actually yes - I changed it so it's properly thread safe. If you write:\nif self.is_computing():\n  self.counting_thread.check_timeout()\nthen after returning from is_computing but before executing the next line other thread can change self.counting_thread - because it's not protected by the lock anymore.. I actually reverted this change now because linux and win builds were not happy, I dunno, something's wrong here. I have a feeling that ProviderIdleTimer.comp_finished() and self.finished_cb() should always be called at the same time (which is not the case e.g. in task_resource_failure). Maybe a helper function which is always called when task is completed would be nice.. I reverted the revert. As I suspected the problem was in a different place.. fwiw exec_cmd can be implemented to use execve to avoid forking, so yet another optimization. This is called before packaging the results, right? But you mentioned we wanna include that in the not idle time.. Neat. I like the fact we call ProviderIdleTimer only from this class.\nAnd not I feel like the timer is off iff has_assigned_task=True after all. And that would make sense. Might be worth keeping it in mind when doing some clean up (e.g. to change self.assigned_subtasks from dict to Optional[str]).. Hm, maybe, the doc proposes 30 s as default \nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem-model/blob/master/market/doc/OfferBufferingProposal.md. Yeah, no, this was just quick RFC so I still need to do cleanup and add tests :). Can't we make the assumption that they won't disconnect? And if they do they are not taken into consideration?. Good point.\nAlthough it isn't marketplace related, marketplace only increases chances of it happening :)\nIn general we could(/should) check whether self.send(ttc) succeeded and react on it. Otherwise it's basically the same as provider getting the task but not computing it - we'll wait for the timeout and decrease reputation.. Good catch, my mistake. I started with that. But then it's easier to do self.assigned_subtask.get('task_id') == task_id when it's always a map. I can revert back to it.. I believe self.key_id will always be set - SRA message has to be verified, before reacting to it, and verification uses self.key_id. So this if won't happen. Similar for other messages in general.. I dunno if it's an error - provider can't prevent from receiving these messages and can't do anything about it. Malicious requestor shouldn't generate error messages on the provider side.. I think SRA has task_to_compute property which has requestor_ethereum_address property which should be used here.. fwiw, I find\n.where(\n  cond1,\n  cond2,\n)\nmore legible than spamming with parentheses.. I think so, yes. Imo the is_income_expected check should live inside check_requestor_for_subtask's if body.. If you apply my comment from line 788 you won't have this issue at all. Why did you add this?. Woah, this if is ugly. I imagine this should happen for all messages and not just this particular one and should be moved to some other place, somewhere before calling react_to_* methods. Afaict this is not the case right now, but I wouldn't add this check here now.\nUnless @shadeofblue or @jiivan have something planned for that already.. > To make sure the message is properly signed?\nAlso checking whether message is properly signed is already done before reaching here. This is for something else. . That'll return None when concent is disabled and SCI will fail, because it expects strings or not to have the key at all.\nSo for disabled concent this entry shouldn't appear here at all.. Well, yes in general. Would like rather have an additional check for that?. That should use compute_subtask_value from taskkeeper module. Having this event we should get rid of finished_cb altogether (not necessarily in this PR). I'd hardcode 0.9 in a constant in some more visible place (top of the file?) . Does it have to have the same value as the other psi? If yes then it'd remove this from args list completely from both functions.. In the doc Q has 3 values, that's the 4th one?. I'm referring to https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-model/blame/master/market/doc/LocalReputationProposal.md#L91\n. or\ntask.get_total_tasks.return_value = total_tasks. Can it be a tuple? Since it's always supposed to have 4 elements. afaict develop needs changes from 1.5.1 which are not included in 1.5.2 (say whaaat) dunno how this should be resolved @Elfoniok . suggestion\n        self.sci.get_eth_balance.return_value = denoms.ether. Since you touched it, please do assertRaisesRegex for specific exception, I just noticed that dest is not checksum'd address so this method could fail with a different exception as well.\nI don't think this is the case right now, but it's better to check against specific exception anyway.. I'm somewhat reluctant to do this - I mean you're correct, but imo it doesn't help that much (user is in debt anyway) to justify the code changes required.. I dunno, that's why I didn't include it. If you introduced a named tuple then just stick to it. It might be more accurate to use transaction's timestamp in place of time.time() - especially when transaction gets mined when client was off. I think that should happen iff inserted. Same, delay might not be accurate. / denoms. These should be HexIntegerField. Just use accepted_ts, settled is not reliable is only Concent specific.. processed_ts is set just after payment is created, so this isn't what you want. on_batch_confirmed's receipt argument has timestamp field, use it instead.. This measures how long verification process took.\nI think you're looking for block.timestamp - e.accepted_ts. This isn't relevant to this PR and I didn't touch that, the issue is not closed (as you can check by yourself) and I dunno if it's still needed. I might have missed the point of your question :P. You can just pass mock.Mock() as the second argument and you won't need *_ in test methods. Also, test_conformance won't need to change (fwiw I'd remove test_conformance altogether from the codebase - the coverage is very sporadic and we have other tools in place to cover that).. Yeah, but dir_manager is set in the constructor and change_config is only called with exactly the same argument which changes nothing, so this is no-op.. The default is .6 anyway, so yeah. I'd say we either do full validation or none at all and we didn't validate subtask_id nor value.\nThese args are coming from SRA message and are validated there (afaik).. Also it is explicitly set during container creation so this is not needed at all. ~~Please set your editor to trim whitespace at the line endings.~~\nNvm, I was blind to the \\ character.. Please import and use WITHDRAWALS_ENABLED instead. So this script doesn't do anything useful anymore and the main script is in the Docker image - wouldn't it make sense to get rid of this file completely?. How come it wasn't needed before?. So this is a bug that made it to 0.19 branch, but this PR most likely won't, right? If not then it should be a separate bug fix PR to the 0.19 branch.. Let's change maintainer to Golem Tech. container_script_path returns Python script path (job.py) so this isn't ideal.\nInstead, it should either pass the script path in e.g. extra_data for wait for my change to remove passing the script file altogether (imo preferred).. The whole Payload class won't be necessary when we stop passing the script via the message and instead pass the argv-like invocation. So making changes in this order is imo wasteful.. Leave these checks, lock_funds_for_payments can be called from wherever and if should still do the validation.. revert this. use smaller numbers or denoms.ether. Remove this method from FundsLocker - it doesn't use any FundsLocker's internals, just the transaction system.. I stated in the summary that this is supposed to be a simple code move, not a cleanup. There's much more to be cleaned, I'd rather not do it in the same PR.. Since this is just about the entrypoint wouldn't it be better to just change the command on line 147 to 'python ' + container_script_path? Leaving the src_code untouched this would be the least invasive way to support generic entrypoint and without giving a false feeling that we do support non Python payloads (which we don't just yet because of the above).. Nope, test_transactionsystem which tests TransactionSystem shouldn't test a method from a different module, move it to an appropriate test file.. Don't patch methods from a class that is being tested, patch external dependencies instead.. Ideally, we will pass this whole command via message, right?. Yeah, this is a slight abuse of extra_data, but there were no better alternatives at the time. Ideally src_code from ctd would be replaced with script_filepath (or even better with some environment config dict, e.g. to include argv as well) but this requires changes to Golem-Messages so this will be done separately.. Let's just check whether concent is available and only then subscribe to concent events (inside _subscribe_to_events method). When do you expect this will be triggered? My understanding is that the transaction system will have concent address iff it's not disabled, so when can that happen? . image_metrics doesn't work with that\n$ docker run golemfactory/image_metrics:1.12 /usr/bin/python3 --version\n/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh: line 13: /usr/bin/python3: No such file or directory. Does it mean that it can go away once the contract is deployed on mainnet? If so please annotate this with such comment (or file an issue).. At this point in the code you are able to just check if self.deposit_contract_available so no need for any external dependencies. But I'm not insisting.. I'd strongly encourage to use ints instead of floats. They are safer to work with and there's absolutely no need for floats here. Also you're unnecessarily going back and forth below with denoms.ether. What's that ?. This isn't needed, is it?\nctd['resources'] is supposed to contain package IDs downloadable from p2p network, not actual filepaths. Isn't this the buggy version? - instead of + ?. Please apply in this PR, there's no point in submitting known buggy code.. that could just use self.tmp_dir and get cleaned automatically . that doesn't feel like the right solution here - in production code we still leave this temp file.  imo benchmark classes should clean up after themselves. same as above. Why not just use self.tmp_dir here and below ?. These filepath operations are not gonna work on Windows, are they? Use pathlib module instead. Also use tempfile for creating temporary files. fwiw I find it noisy/confusing to see comments like \"done\"/\"fixed\" without corresponding changes in the published code, the standalone comment like that has little value until there's code to look at. \n. Why did you change it without any confirmation in the first place?. Did you verify this is correctly handled by the Rust module?. What kind of complications are we talking about? It fails with an error? There's test_rust.py which is supposed to test proper integration with Rust and I'd expect a test there that guarantees no \"complications in rust part\".. is this still valid then?. I'd be inclined to use scale_price function here rather than a raw value - this value is an implementation detail which may change (and it already has done it once; from inf). Is this logic in here really needed for anything?. That's been changed to an entrypoint in #3932 so it needs to be updated. What's the meaning of this file?. How and where is this file used?. Why not use resources field from the top level dict? I'm not a fan of the add_to_resources approach later. afaik these won't be cleaned up if not used in context manager.\nPlease use our custom TempDirFixture from testutils. Wellll, ok. You mean in a unit test or in general? Because unit test uses it, but that can be freely adjusted. ",

    "lukasz-glen": "Python 3.6, to be clear.\nUpdating the Docker image is simple. It is important to test it. We need to check if old and new Dockers  generate the same images/subtasks. The threat is that resulting images are different in size (rounding problem) or in quality or execution of Dockers are incompatible.\nPlease do not include new Docker in Golem production branch - it is more business decision.. Tests:\n1. Mimic execution of Docker: render the same subtasks as regular Golem do. Check rendered images.\n2. Create Golem with new Docker image and check if it works properly - computes subtasks.. Information sent to the monitor includes:\n\n\ntotal time to complete task (starts from broadcast, ends with completion of all subtasks or cancellation of task or failure of task) divided into tasks that failed, succeeded but contained failures or timeouts, succeeded without failures and timeouts\n\n\nnumber of tasks that failed, succeeded but contained failures or timeouts, succeeded without failures and timeouts\n\n\nnumber of received messages MessageWantToComputeTask (as a measurement of response to 'task announcement'). Do you consider those two reasons: Requestor could not download results using Concent and Requestor could not download results not using Concent?. Maybe we should consider other way. For now nodes report number of successful, failed and timed out subtasks. Maybe we should extend subtask final statuses: failed, timed out, cancelled, rejected, accepted.. and add corresponding logic on the monitor side. and do not forget to persist data. I suppose requestor stats do some of the job. this issue was replaced by other issues created by shadeofblue. @shadeofblue is right.\nBut it is ok for Concent to respond http 400 in the situation you've mentioned.. done within integration tests for UC1/UC2. all non-protocol messages has very low priority\nwe can think about how requestor should react on such messages later, for now it is sufficient to log them. duplicates #2761 . And update Provider's UI for unsupported tasks if there is such.. Update: there is no need for logic on the monitor side, please do just Golem part.. there should be also synchronous rejection by Concent in additional verification, it is also a reason for failure but we need to clarify it in a documentation first. As stated above. done within integration test for UC1/UC2. apparently we need to add a proper reason for that in CannotComputeTask. Please refer to G 5.4 and G 6.1 and G 6.2. @jiivan you have done some work with Concent negotiation, please check it up if it is partially done. 8. Also returning sutasks (failed and timeouted) should be assigned to pooled Providers.. Please keep in mind that 'assigning policy' is a 'moving part'.. the exception should be logged anyway, to not loose information regardless of the code below. \n\n",

    "kascheri12": "Why was this closed? What's the workaround? Did it get solved? I'm stuck not being able to run golemapp on a fresh Ubuntu installation with the latest version of geth.. I was seeing this error on every subtask I requested from MacOS 10.13.1 golem-0.9.0 RC. \nSolved it by removing docker contents. sudo rm -rf ~/.docker/*\nI'm wondering if this could be due to trying to run golem from source AND golem 0.9.0 RC on the same machine but at different times.. . Again on MacOS 10.13.1, tried running golem from tags/0.9.1. Golemapp seemed to run ok, but requested subtasks failed with same error as above. \n2 things I did different to solve the problem:\n1. rebuild golem machine using docker-machine command instead of removing the folder. docker-machine rm golem and docker-machine create  --driver xhyve --xhyve-virtio-9p --xhyve-cpu-count 1 --xhyve-memory-size 2596 golem\n2. eval $(docker-machine env golem) -- because I forgot to do this.\nDoing both of these things solved the problem, subtasks are now entering the 'Downloading' state. I wonder if I didn't need to rebuild docker-machine.. Here it is again on a different node.

Also since I'm getting theCould not accept new connection (EMFILE)` text over and over again so quickly, it's maxing out the CPU. Would it be possible to also fix so that no info or error message would waste so much spare resources? \n\n. I believe this happened on MacOS 10.13.1 and I think the issue is due to Terminal. I'm not sure if I was running from source or binary but it seemed like a buggy terminal window. When I exit the golemcli, my terminal session was still not acting correctly. I solved this by closing the session and opening a fresh one, navigating back into golemcli and then everything was working right.. @etam I created the task using a .task file with formatted json task object. I read through Blender documentation that the engine can render files in AVI format so I tried to plug it in to see if it would work. It did not finish to completion, although all the frames were rendered, but not stitched together.. That's your history actually. Those are payments that have been made to another node in return for the computations to complete your tasks.\nThe tasks you're requesting can be found in the \"Tasks\" tab up at the top next to \"Network\".. I ran a very complete and successful test and have attached the log file here for review. I do believe there is a bug here and it is not sending payments as it should and I will explain below. \nThis is how my test went:\n Last night I started a task with 400 subtasks. Woke up this morning and it was in Finished state. No countdown for next sendout was happening at this time.\n Shutdown golemapp\n Start golemapp -- This is where the log file starts\n  * Note all the payments that are waiting to be processed. 73.3333 GNT reserved at this time for 11 payments. Note 205 more payments waiting to be processed.\n Wait 10 minutes, sendout happens, block confirmed\n Wait approx 30 minutes, nothing is happening.\n Shutdown golemapp\n Start golemapp right away\n  * Note 66.6666 GNT reserved at this time for 10 payments. 195 more payments waiting.\n Wait 10 minutes, sendout happens, block confirmed\n Wait 10 minutes, nothing happening\n Line 2006 of log file, I attach golemcli and request 4 new tasks to be computed with 1 subtask each.\n  * Line 2282, first subtask is finished. 6.6666 GNT reserved. Sendout starts to count down.\n  * Line 2346, 2nd subtask finished. 13.333 GNT reserved.\n  * ... 3rd subtask finished. 20.000 GNT reserved.\n Sendout happens for the 20 GNT reserved, block confirmed.\n Waiting, nothing happens\n Line 2867, 4th subtask finishes\n  * 6.6666 GNT reserved, Sendout starts to count down again.\n Sendout happens, block confirmed.\nAt this point, I know the previous payments are not going to happen on their own so I shutdown golemapp again.\n Start golemapp\n  * Note 53.3333 GNT reserved for 8 payments. 187 payments still need processing.\n Wait for sendout, it happens, block confirmed.\nMy conclusion: There are payments that are not being queued to process automatically. In this case I am forcing the backlog to queue up by restarting the node.\nAll this testing was done on MacOS 10.13.2 with golem-0.9.1 binary.\n20171214_golemapp_log.txt. @jiivan At the time this was posted kascheri12 node was running 0.11.0 binary. .

I'm running tests on my kascheri12* nodes and subtasks are being computed and Finishing now. Looking good!. Hi @maaktweluit \nI will switch all kascheri12* nodes from develop to b0.12.0 this evening and launch some more tests. \nThe following are logs from the same time from kascheri12 node.\n2018-02-22

Is this the Redis db that needs to be purged? Are there instructions to do this?. @Wiezzel Oh that's right - I was thinking of monitor. Thanks!. @jiivan Yes. I didn't need to delete tasks or anything for it to work, only waiting a minute or two.\n\nWhy can't I create a second task immediately after creating first one? I can create a second task 2 minutes after creating the first one, but not 10 seconds.\nWhy is my \"available balance\" increasing over time (that's what the error messages are telling me) while my wallet (via account info) hasn't change at all?. Thank you, that makes complete sense and answers that question about functionality. \nYes, the task was partially finished in 2 minutes and subtasks were scheduled for payment.. I see this and wonder - the estimate is only 0.17 tGNT - I have that amount of tGNT in my wallet.. What do I need to do to have enough funds?. 1. Add estimate of ETH for the task also?\nTell me in pop-up that ETH is the issue so I know to add more ETH to wallet.\n. @maaktweluit Thank you for the invite. LGTM; this solves my issue.. I was confused when reading the output of golemcli account info since eth_address doesn't specifically tell me that it's a gnt address also. \nI have since sent GNT to this address and successfully seen the amount in my node's account info.. \n",

I pushed changes to address them.. @maaktweluit Feel free to take over for the windows service.\nIn addition to the post I linked in the issue, if you haven't already, you might want to look into the ansible user right module for setting \"SeServiceLogonRight\" (\"log on as a service\", required by buildbot).\n. @maaktweluit I had no problems with timeouts, but feel free to tweak to whatever works for you. Although wouldn't it be more appropriate to put ansible_winrm_read_timeout_sec in group_vars instead of using set_fact? . @maaktweluit the file is publicly available, it should work for you just fine (unless you need a different version).. @etam, I addressed that issue in adf28e4029863897dbc082b2ace2e345dc99eac4. Right. I've removed stale comments and restructured the code.. I think it\u2019s good to keep this explicit as you might have a separate dev/staging inventory and wouldn\u2019t want to apply your configuration to production by accident if you forget it.. I didn\u2019t even test with Python 3 as there were, if I remember correctly, problems with some parts of buildbot on 3. Please use python 2 as provided by the ansible configs.. Not really, but it\u2019s nice to default to a more readable output since it\u2019s not a situation where every byte counts.. It should. Done.. Yes, unfortunately VirtualBox won't run on AWS. It will be necessary to move to a different platform if we want to test with it.\nI'll remove the package.. This is mirrored from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pywin32. That package was recommended by @mfranciszkiewicz IIRC. . This is not required for any of the current commands, although it will be required before initializing a windows service.. Are you sure about this? I feel having own mirror would be more reliable than sourceforge.. In https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1535#issuecomment-339801915 I mentioned it should be possible to set appropriate user right via the user rights module. Did you try it?. I'm not sure it's a good idea to reuse the worker pass (for the master-worker protocol) as a Windows password. Seems unnecessary and weakens security. It would be best to generate a random one, or at least use a separate variable.. Would it be possible to omit path? Won't buildbot_worker_windows_service.exe already take care of configuring that?. Looking at win_service examples, it looks like it should be possible to use it to query service state without going through the shell:\n- name: check if a service is installed\n  win_service:\n    name: service name\n  register: service_info. yep.

    "msayle81": "I think I am having a similar issue to what ederenn has described. I have forwarded the ports as detailed in the in the wiki, however whenever I start golem.exe, the 'Golem is having trouble connecting. You may need to check your router ports.' error message pops up. Left clicking on the popup makes it go away, and the status at the bottom of the app changes from Connecting to network, to 1 Node (or 2 Nodes etc). Changing to the Tasks tab also shows that Golem is ready (screenshots attached)\n\n\n\nDoes that mean I am successfully connecting? If so then it seems the error message is popping a little bit too early, before the app has finished connecting to the network, and may be confusing users that they have a networking issue even though they don't. Or do? I am not sure ;-)\nHope this helps. ",

Thanks @ktomala @maaktweluit for your reviews, thanks @badb for mergeing\n\nNow I see that this should be implemented in .pylintrc. I'll make another PR with fix. closed by mistake. hi @maaktweluit, this is rebase + some style fixes for #1702 which you have previously reviewed. But do we really support it? Till today I was conviced so and was using py3.6, but my golem nodes (@ mac 10.13 & ubuntu 17.10) are not allways able to compute bigger tasks (bmw > 1000x1000) with multiple subtasks. no, I didn't. Yet. \nBut nonetheless, since we do not support 3.6 in build bots and distro, I would prefer not to add Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6 for now.. so you insist adding 3.6?. @maaktweluit I have spoken with @badb and @mfranciszkiewicz and they both support idea of switching to 3.6 as our primary and only development python version.\nCan you please check if py3.6 works well on linux (ubuntu 16)?\nAFAIK this is last OS platform where we supply py3.5 within golem binary installation.. great! thanks @maaktweluit !\nWould you amend the setup of all agents then?. that's great @jiivan, your testimony harden basis for switching to py3.6. tihis speeds up my local lint.sh from beyond 3mins to under 1 min\n```\n$ time ./lint.sh \nUsing origin/develop as reference branch\nComparing ffad4425...64b83acf\npylint main...

While my CPU is high end, according to http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/processormfg/ it no more than 2x as fast as average user machine. Thus difficulty 14 should result in average key generation time below 2 mins, and below 8 mins in 99% of cases.. I've checked and 0bfff9e7 works well. included in #2281 . For reviw brevity pls look only @ first commit a41c04dfd.\nSecond one is just tests speed-up. I agree with @etam. What is the purpose of this change?. >  But it is not clear what is it. Is it node's system infrastructure or Golem configuration \nThe latter. See \nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/85f470dbd631ce5ebb7bc008b058b1772cb3f8ed/golem/monitor/model/nodemetadatamodel.py#L15-L16. sorry @Krigpl this is WIP, simply putted @ GH to be able to continue work from another machine :). @shadeofblue as I said, this is draft, a WIP commit only. It's current shape will highly evolve. I didn't ask for review.... ;)  \nMy plan was to implement solution discussed with @jiivan and described here: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/2211#issuecomment-371785739. guys @Krigpl and @shadeofblue, I've changed solution conception: lets use public_key as a node for uuid1 generation. Code presents it only for task_id. If you like it, I will change also subtask_id generation.. - task_id is generated as uuid1 with node (low 48 bits) set to top 48 bits from public key\n- subtask_id is generated with node (low 48 bits) set to task_id node (low 48 bits)\nSo (sub)task_id's can be verified by golem-messages to match requestor public key. This enforces uniqueness betweeen requestors (to produce malicious collision attacker need to generate public key with same top48 bits wich needs ~32k cpu years, and this will allow only to disturb single node on the network).\nUse of uuid1 ensures uniqueness within requestor.. Seems that we store mem and disk in KiB\n$ golemcli settings set 2>&1 | grep max\n    max_resource_size                                    int > 0 [kB]   Maximal resource size\n    max_price                                              float >= 0   Max GNT/h price (requestor)\n    max_memory_size                    16777216 > int >= 1024000 [kB]   Max memory size\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/efae6fe40390091f6d7b13bb655726513ed228f7/golem/interface/client/settings.py#L61-L63\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/efae6fe40390091f6d7b13bb655726513ed228f7/golem/interface/client/settings.py#L140-L141.

It is partially addressed in #2734 . interaction from @jamuszyn https://invis.io/6JJ0IF9ZU54#/297977145_dont_Want_To_Be_A_Provider_Copy_2. implementing this is useless w/o fixing golemfactory/golem-electron#346 first. @badb @mdtanrikulu @jamuszyn lets summarise our decisions:\nWe will introduce performance multiplier expressed as percentage of current requestor performance value. It will affect all golem use cases -- work offer will be accepted only when:\n[provider performance] >= [requestor performance] * [performance multiplier] / 100\nPerformance multiplier can vary from 0% to 1000% (10x). By default we will set it to 100%.\nExamples\nAssume that we (as a requestor) have blender performance = 700. Given that, when performance multiplier is set to:\n- 0 we will accept all work offers\n- 50 we will accept work offers from providers with at least half of our (requestor) blender performance ie. >= 350 \n- 100 accept only providers as strong as we are or strongest >= 700\n- 200 accept only at least twice as strong as we are >= 1400\n. RPC part is done https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2734\nwaiting for review\n@mdtanrikulu check out new RPC mappings.. RPC names will stay unchanged:\n- performance.multiplier for get value\n- performance.multiplier.update for set\nand will accept float value between 0 and 10\nCLI would allow to set this value event beyond 10x.. This is not resolved yet, as I do not see GUI changes.... ok, there is golemfactory/golem-electron#348 with GUI changes, but not merged yet. related to #2771. One general comment: please do not use force push after review was made, because it hinder next review phase. Rather add new commits and push them . thx for answers . cannot replicate. Please add description how did you encountered it.. those two classes HardwarePresets and HardwarePresetsMixin should be merged I think... cause their responsibility are pretty the same, furthermore this would shorten Client code. \n. It was a bug in new monitor backend. I had fixed it and deployed to production. Users having this issue should restart their golem nodes to update their status @ stats.golem.network . Did it help for you?. here is my proposition. It was easier and shorter to code it than write about it ;). So, I'm proudly approving my own solution, seeing you said it solves our problem ;) . You've correctly interpreted my intention about test_update_config_not_changed.  Mocking methods that are building blocks of update_config reduces this test coverage, so I've proposed solution with mocking lower level functions which are responsible for reading current env limits. But reading your comments allowed me to realize that we should also add a test with changing this mocks between update_config calls, because this happens on prod all the time.. . Main part of this PR was merged into develop with  #3071. Unassigning myself as I'm not in Brass team...\n@ederenn, please use @etam hint. It should fix your issue.\nThere are unit tests for this feature, which are passing\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/fd37007cc4ef7eaebf6b0c6f5beced93a262bb0c/tests/golem/task/test_acl.py#L51-L61\nFurthermore I've tested it manually on all platforms just before 0.16.0 and worked as a charm!. \n. I'd rather check if env is supported and log error instead of trowing exception. sorry, misclick. I'm experiencing random handshake errors (timeouts) too.. I don't see any pattern here\n$ grep handshake golem.log\n2018-11-27 11:06:50 INFO     golem.resources                     Starting resource handshake with '1f8e0cdf..cf6c3ba6'\n2018-11-27 11:07:26

We have two types of blacklisting in Golem:\n\n\n\ntask specific. It blocks further work offers from provider nodes which failed to calculate previous subtasks for this task. Other tasks are not affected.\n\n\nglobal, which have also two incarnations\n\nsoft. upon resource handshake error it will block peer for 2h. \nhard. persisted in deny.txt file as described here. It can be added by manually editing the file or via GUI and CLI golemcli network block <node_id> \n\nWhat you are describing (when nodes fail to finish within timeout) should be type 1, so does not affect further tasks.. according to doc in notice_task_updated (line 850) this op should be notified with persist=False. ugly: DefaultDict import is only for type annotation comments. This enum is a mess. It mixes TASK, SUBTASK and others.. h() and c() are meaningless. They should be  fully named.. code in this method looks awful/boilerplate because of using immutable tuples instead of mutable class. But I'll leave it as is, to not be burried into marginal style fixes any more . no, we want to see the last message, because it is indicator of current subtask status.\nif it is RESULT_DOWNLOADING then increase counter. @jiivan can you please comment on this?. same as above. should be rather hidden form user. I'm touching this file only to please linters - this is pure/dumb/automatic import optimization. . ok, I'll fix it here. good point! :) I was not precise.\nTask is considered not_downloaded, when there was RES_DOWNL msg, not followed by FINISHED nor NOT_ACCEPTED. Other msg are ignored. ;) It was complaining here. I don't know precisely why. Maybe because of my manual rebase steps (those RDP commits were very old and had conflicts). @maaktweluit please approve (via rocket chat)\n. ok. no problem. i'll put a few words. according to what I have ack from @badb, as for Golem Brass we will accept that node will re-generate key when difficulty is increased.. why?. I've realized that already but thanks. thx @etam, please check it again now . ok, thx for feedback\nI've used automatic PyCharm format feature. I'll revert style changes. indeed. thx. I was looking somebody tell that! :). right! thx. @mfranciszkiewicz reccomended the same approach. I'll give it a shot. yup! I do not want this refactoring in this PR. cool! new python insight for me, thx!. thx! I overlooked this. this enforce all beta-users to regenerate their keys... Can't we just read old key, and repack it into new file for first time?. password doc is missing. I think we should point out some solution, for example to reinstall golem, or delete old key file... or even some url to some FAQ page with question: how to transfer GNT(W) from old golem account...  . yes, but until #2213 will happened we should, at least, inform user how to deal with this issue... for example \"Loaded key is not difficult enough. To regenerate please reinstall golem or remove key file path.. I agree the latter part of your statement, but this PR is good foundation to final #2213 solution :). ok. right. ok, I was thinking about something similar, but thought that it will be too much hassle with tests, where KeysAuth is not invoked from within reactor. But I've found solution for this. good point, I'll try. @Krigpl done. ok. nope. it is not caught because reactor is stopped.... this is inside tests dir. Is there any other purpose of this code than testing?. nope. sorry, I wasn't careful. it was clumsy and... broken. It would never return anything below 0.1. please notice that this exception is thrown after reactor is stopped, so no callback nor errback would be executed. I'm throwing it to break processing. It could be return, but i think raise is more natural in this situation. Logger is additional, to be informative to our users.. ok. yup. i've succesfully act as a requestor and provider with this code. yes, that was the case. Thanks pointing out. I've tested it e2e ie. started node and requested task which successfully finished, and from other side my node has successfully served as a provider. Can I remove this test?. same here.... thx @jiivan !. ok, I taught that it is a good practice to introduce named exception in python... will remove two other. maybe it is wrong by design, but it is here just for tests purposes; keysauth is invoked w/o reactor in most test cases, and  reactor.running = False all the time then. But in production keysauth is invoked as deferred from within reactor,  so reactor must be up and running already.. is there a must to provide default values here?. to much hassle... ;) after re-consideration I think it is good in current shape, as it enables keysauth usage from outside of reactor.. ad1. right, but it is race condition between reactor and user mainly, so in worst case user will wait... not a big deal I think, while it is near impossible to hit CTRL+C between reactor.run and invocation of this assignment. \nad2. fell free to add such a comment. I see that you're changing this file in #2289 \n. and @Krigpl thanks for really insightful comments. thx for that fix with comment! Will remember :). oooh, I was looking for this in docs, but given up. Thx! :). ok. \ud83d\udc4d . why not static? cls is not used. 10y? it need's a comment. would be nice to have tests for this SSL client, especially with auth failure . looks strange, is this some python idiom?. this will affect whole app, not only dummy task. o, no, we dont\n2018-03-26 12:23:54 INFO     golem.pay                           ETH: 0.018496877, GNT: 1000.0, GNTB: 0.0 \n2018-03-26 12:24:58 INFO     golem.pay                           ETH: 0.018496877, GNT: 1000.0, GNTB: 0.0 \n2018-03-26 12:26:04 INFO     golem.pay                           ETH: 0.018496877, GNT: 1000.0, GNTB: 0.0 \n2018-03-26 12:27:09 INFO     golem.pay                           ETH: 0.018496877, GNT: 1000.0, GNTB: 0.0 \n2018-03-26 12:28:14 INFO     golem.pay                           ETH: 0.018496877, GNT: 1000.0, GNTB: 0.0 \n2018-03-26 12:29:19 INFO     golem.pay                           ETH: 0.018496877, GNT: 1000.0, GNTB: 0.0 \n2018-03-26 12:30:23 INFO     golem.pay                           ETH: 0.018496877, GNT: 1000.0, GNTB: 0.0 \n2018-03-26 12:31:29 INFO     golem.pay                           ETH: 0.018496877, GNT: 1000.0, GNTB: 0.0 \n2018-03-26 12:32:34 INFO     golem.pay                           ETH: 0.018496877, GNT: 1000.0, GNTB: 0.0. ok, done. Choosen 10 decimal places for ETH, and 3 for GNT(B). too much hassle, furthermore it will be printed only when those three methods return True. seems it's only line changed not regarding logger. Is this cause of our headache? :) . len_ is redundant as uuid node must be 48 bits, which mean 6 bytes, or 12 hex'es. GEN_LEN  is enough.\nIt also would be nice to add some doc, because gen parameter is not so easy to understood at a glance. Maybe seed is a bit more intuitive.. mark as __private. Encourage to use f-strings eg. f' Task_id {task_id} and task owner {task_owner} mismatch'. \ud83d\udc4d Hmm, how could I've missed that! :) . I'd rather move both docs to idgenerator. ... --> and given seed. here is still gen --> seed. style is not consistent with beginning of the class:\n- hardcoded subtask_id instead of generated one\n- log_ --> l. such exception w/o msg just with value would cause users/developers doubts\nshouldn't we just raise click.BadParameter here? . pub_p2p_port --> p2p_pub_port as in golem/network/p2p/node.py:21. I'd move config_args just after config_desc not being optional as it is not optional really. We always provide it within golemapp.py . I'd move config_args just after config_desc not being optional as it is not optional really. See my comment in golem/node.py:49. here you just confirm my hipotesis that this is more intuitive place for that arg. I saw, but what is this raise-catch-raise for?. This is of minor importance and feel free to ignore it, but to be consistent: You are using type=Click.INT so value here has type int. Click lib handles non-integer input for you and prevents calling this function if input is not valid int. I can't imagine other exception in comparsion. \nI would raise Click.BadParameter immediately with a bit more informative msg: 'Port should be in range (1-65535)'. If you expect other Exception, than catch it and rethrow as Click.BadParameter.. All other functions raises Click.BadParam immediately and catches some specific exceptions not vanilla Exception. buts lets not dive deeper into it. Its ok. We have more important problems \ud83d\ude80 . :wink:. thx!. now looks that it will work :). :) upps. I was considering adding size word, but decided to skip it for brevity. This will be obvious when you see the output\n```\n$ golemcli res show\ntotal computed files    total received files    total distributed files\n\n0B                      4.0K                    0B\n``\n . changedfilestodataand removedcomputedcolumn as it's point the same asdistributed.Port-->Port(s):. add missing test cases:\n- unknown\n- Application not listening, check config file\n- Port(s): [list]\n- Connected / Not Connected .. check\n. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . You have changed return type and value forconnection_statusand corrected its usage ingolem/interface/client/network.pybut it is used also inNetworkConnectionPublisherService` see line 1337\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2702/files#diff-9f351727974c5655127c6a4dc0671995R1337\nI don't know the purpose of this class, but have you considered and checked consequences of your change?. why not use exact full message which we are actually expecting and no such heuristics, where you are checking for some part is in, and two otheres are not? This is not easy readable.. ok, cool.\nhere you should test also connection_status()['port_statuses']  because you've added such a property. good point. @Krigpl thanks for feedback. it was intentional, as we discussed. But will change, as Blender benchmark uses multi-core. ok. we need to align it with @mdtanrikulu No problem from my side. will do. As we discussed, I've added it just for catching exceptions, because without yield and inlineCallbacks it was'nt working for me. But now seems to work ;) It was too late yesterday.... ok, I'll remove one of them. since we've decided to do it more generic (see https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/2771#issuecomment-391344430) this hardcode will be removed. @mdtanrikulu agreed, so I've changed. Please check. nice to have return type. do we need those details?. why do we need/want to supply all these details with state?. this doc is malformed. \ud83d\udc4d for removing unnecessary node_name :). what is it for?. this is not best practice. I'd rather provide minimal set of data, not maximal one. If anyone in future will need something (s)he would simply enrich this.. i think you can remove this preventive code, but need to add , unused-import at line 14. this is not a blocker for me, feel free to ignore this comment. ok. I've done it here https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2734/commits/57c36cb8410f84581757408352f1376e6d20255e. it is same Q as above regarding details. \ud83d\udc4d . the waiting_for_task var holds None or task_id, hence name you've proposed for it is misleading. I know task_computer uses this name, but it is also misleading. Please clarify that by changing to eg. task_id_waited_for. I would do a provider class/group with the status method/command. Than cli invocation would have form:\ngolemcli provider status. those comments are not necessary, as you provide string result saying the same. to be consistent with other commands. why do we need increasing this? . ups, I did it again ... thx. \ud83d\udc4d cool, that you're adding typing. is this the main fix here?. \ud83d\udc4d for comment. what is this empty class for?. :+1: veeery goood to split long tests. do not like it, but lets go on. @mfranciszkiewicz asked to put node info into logs. It helps debugging. ok, but now task_id is redundantly twice.... interesting comparison, I think you can post it on #developers channel on our rocket. I also like f'string readability but thought that it is much slower than 'correct logging'. @Wiezzel create PR for @jiivan code with f'string ;). we can do a poll inside our team for readablity of f'strings and other string formatting methods !. \ud83d\udc4d . whaa? we need to assure that it is not below MIN, how do your code achieve this?. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\ude04 . \ud83d\udc4d . @etam, I'm totally sorry - it was my misunderstanding as of y-day. I didn't notice double int( constructor. done. with those mocks, config can differ only on name field. This test is not testing real/prod code any more... \nI'd rather mock cpu_cores_available(), memory_available() and free_partition_space() methods here.. those are specially crafted values for this test to pass. \nI guess you're trying to bypass test environment limitations/characteristics here, am I right?\nBut in this shape you are stripping lots of logic from tested class.. It is even better now, since we are testing update_config method here.\nI suggest creating three additional tests for those three methods used here (mocking methods checking system resources ie. cpu_cores_available() for cpu_cores()) \n. three times is abundant, 2x is enough, your're right. You can remove one invocation if you want.\nThis test is assuming that environment has more than one cpu core, more than 1200000KiB RAM and more than 2000000KiB / 3 * 4 disk space. When you mock methods I've enumerated above, it will be independent from actual env limitations.   . I think mocking same methods as I've mentioned below/above is sufficient also here. \nWhat additional logic are you mentioning? . would be great add a reason here! It will highly simplify debugging. I do not know about those integrations tests... can not review it.... eg. like here https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/ae70ab85a52c2a62dc12b62dc820a4939ddefd34/golem/task/taskmanager.py#L449-L451. thats more than enough. thx. why do you returning handshake error here?. ok, didn't notice one of not's. yup, golem-monitor-replicator will ignore unknown requests and fields. As for now, ProviderStats is a completely new request type from gmr perspective, so it will be ignored as a whole.. ",

    "RDProjekt": "Tests on Windows no longer hang when I run them using pytest (\"pytest\" or \"python -m pytest\"). i.e. in the same way as it is done in CI. I double checked this using various Windows machines.\nThey still hang when run by executing \"python setup.py test\" but I guess we just should not execute them that way.\nSo perhaps this issue can be considered as closed.. Golem adds a session ID to every message it sends to the monitor (sessid in Redis and PostgreSQL) along with a timestamp. Session ID changes every time Golem is started, so based on the session ID and the first/last timestamps bound to it, we can identify the session start/end timepoints with an accuracy of 1h - this is the interval of taking snapshots, not sending out stats, which happens much more often.\nSumming up - do we really need the session start timestamp, or are the current data enough for now?. To do this we need to use nodejs packages secp256k1 and js-sha3 in monitor, is that ok ?. Also, while working on this issue we noticed that public key used as node ids is in uncompressed form(64 bytes), but compressed form is 33 bytes, so maybe node ids might be shorter ?. We heard that release without signing stats is planned, so how should monitor react on stats sended by older clients without a signature ?. Actually we want to try mocking part of DockerEnvironment instead of using ci_skip. Failing tests do not really need Docker to run, and both of them are testing fairly important pieces of functionality, so it would be good to leave them running.. Blacklisted requestor is joined with max price threshold rather than overridden by it. In the resulting unsupported task stats, both unsupport reasons (deny_list, max_price) will have increased counts in such case.. Absolutely, done.. This one is Optional as in \"can be None\", but the parameter needs to be always provided. I think it would be weird to pass new first and old after it.. End user can't do much about it and it does not really affect her. Demoted to debug.\n. Changed all new logger calls to use logger formatters. If this ever happens it means that someone changed TaskOp enum but did not update the stats collecting code. End user can't do anything about it, so instead of upgrading demoted it to debug.\n. c() does that, first thing it checks is if the handler has been called.\n. This is kind of opposite of self.task_persistence, which describes if the system has persistence enabled. persist parameter says if the particular change that called notice_task_updated was important enough to save the task. I have added a comment describing this in more details.. They have different fields. TaskStats are about a single task, CurrentStats is a summary for all tasks in the session. Added documentation to CurrentStats, TaskStats already had it.\n. Yes, other structures describe current state of the task and TaskOp describes the change of the state.\n. We added functions for such test in another commit, we'll create pull request for it shortly. Done. Done. Done. Done. this is get() on a map, so empty list is the default value if no environments were reqistered for this type. Requirements are checked 3 lines below.. Yes, if the Provider wishes to prefer other environments, that list has to be modified manually. It does not affect tasks which have specific requirements not satisfied by this environment though.. As in the TODO - it's actually not clear if requirements should be passed here.\nThe problem is that LocalComputer is used for local computation, including verification and creating reference data. For that reason it should be able to compute given tasks.\nSo the question is - should it be possible to create a task that requestor cannot compute itself, e.g. require CUDA rendering engine when the requestor does not have it? We've chosen 'yes' as the answer because it makes golem way more powerful for end-users. But that means that LocalComputer should ignore requirements and select any environment for the task - at least one such environment must be present.. \"message\" as in \"ctd\"? No - requirements are added to TaskHeader to that providers have them at hand from the beginning and so can decide if they support the task before possibly asking for it (see TaskHeaderKeeper.checkEnvironment(header)). In general DockerManager is still required because some (most) environments require working docker setup. But I do see your point that 1. docker manager might not be required if all configured environments are not docker-based, 2. maybe TaskComputer is not the best place to have it.\nMoving it out of TaskComputer would require decision on \"move to where\". There is no better suited place right now, so we would have to create a whole new mechanism of setting up executables based on golem's configuration.. When computation is requested straight from a task (e.g. in luxrender __generate_final_file ) there is no environments_manager reference at hand. Passing explicit environment is a workaround, as more robust solution would require quite a lot of debate and refactoring:\n\nenvironments_manager must be globally referencable, manually passing it from one entity to another doesn't work in that case.\ndiscussion what exactly are tasks and what should they carry - e.g. in blender verifier calculacting verification scores is done by explicitly running a docker job. But in luxrender merging flm results is done by running an artifical (created on spot, not received from external requestor) ctd with different script_src - that way it runs in the same docker as standard luxrender task.\nshould tasks locally be computed the same way as global ones (i.e. including requirements) or do we allow local computation to differ. If they can differ - should local computation environment be hardcoded, configured by a separate config, or reuse environments config?\n. see reply above. see reply above. \n",

Clear your database.. See https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/2339. When switching from current develop version to b0.13.0 you need to downgrade or purge your database.. @kascheri12 No, Golem doesn't use Redis but SQLite. This database is stored in a single file in the Golem data directory. On Linux it's ~/.local/share/golem/default/golem.db (unless you configured Golem to store data elsewhere). In order to purge db just remove the file.. @maaktweluit Dunno how to do it. What is \"the golemapp pyinstaller hook\"?. @maaktweluit Done.. @mfranciszkiewicz @Krigpl Please review new changes.. @GMDays I started working on #1622 which is a larger issue possibly including this one but I never finished it. So if you want to take this one please help yourself.. I will do this when #2462 is reverted.. Closed by #2489 . @maaktweluit It's rebuilding. :). @etam Googling for this error message returns some interesting results:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/1632\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/1017\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/864. Ref: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2651#pullrequestreview-112034901. I tried on both Linux and Windows and I was unable to reproduce this issue. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. @etam I updated the code according to your suggestions.. Looks like tests.golem.rpc.test_router.TestRouter.test_rpc got broken. :disappointed: \nMaybe @mfranciszkiewicz could help you with deferreds since I am not expert either.. Golem-Messages 2.9.1 is not yet published.. TaskStatus was changed from string to enum in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2709 Looks like you restored some old task which was incompatible with the new code.. Cannot reproduce the issue with any newly-created tasks.. @jiivan Fixed the issues you pointed out.. @mfranciszkiewicz Done.. @FotG What operating system are you running? How do you start Golem (clicking an icon or by command-line)?. @FotG Thank you for feedback. I will investigate the issue.. I could not reproduce this error on my machine (Windows 10) using 0.16.0 binaries.\nFrom the provided logs I infer that the error occurred in this code fragment:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/83bfaf3d15c950498b6f5985e615d838200b736c/golem/transactions/ethereum/ethereumtransactionsystem.py#L65-L67\nI tried to analyze all calls to int() from these lines but there were around 100 (!) of them. Further debugging is impossible without the full stacktrace which we unfortunately lack. In #2933 I introduced an extended logging mechanism that will print the stacktrace if any unhandled error occurs during node initialization.. @mdtanrikulu Please check if this works when you're done with the front-end part.. @mdtanrikulu Done. Added last_updated field which contains the time of last status change. It is a timestamp like time_started.. The functionality has been discussed with @jamuszyn.\nI am aware that some tests are failing therefore [WIP].. @mdtanrikulu Done.\nTest are fixed as well.\n@mfranciszkiewicz @Krigpl Please, review.. One problem with this feature is that Hello message could be sent before benchmarks finish so that 0.0 would be sent instead of true performance. A way to solve this would be to wait with starting network until benchmarks are computed, but I don't know if this solution wouldn't cause some further trouble. On the other hand the problem is not very serious since benchmarks are computed quite fast and this affects only a couple of first Hello messages (most likely sent to seeds).\n@mfranciszkiewicz @Krigpl What do you think?. @mfranciszkiewicz I will add waiting for benchmark computation in a separate PR.. If it's in the same repo then it should be built as a part of Golem I believe, not as an external crate.\nBut I also believe we should consider splitting the Golem codebase into separate repositories and crates/libraries as we move towards a more decoupled architecture.. @mfranciszkiewicz, @maaktweluit Plz test & review.. @maak Yep, the powershell script should be included.. int() could also raise ValueError.. Tested again. Worked fine. \ud83d\udc4d . 1) What about computation_failed?\n2) I think we will be getting rid of \"subtask\" at all, so maybe wait until our new nomenclature is settled? (summon @badb). @maaktweluit @mfranciszkiewicz Please approve (or not if you thing something more is missing).. Also, I cannot see what happens if adding user to the group fails.. I believe that failure should stop the installer. This not an extra feature. This is really necessary to run Golem.. @maaktweluit I think we've just established on #developers channel that start_task and end_task are always equal.. @Krigpl Why did you ignore my comment? :crying_cat_face: . @Krigpl OK, that's fine.. > This was where i started, but these arguments are not available. The machine is always created with static minimum of 1GB, so i think this is OK.\nOK, so just remove the --hyperv-disable-dynamic-memory parameter.. @mfranciszkiewicz Please take a look at DockerTaskThread._run_docker_job(): https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3355/commits/c20f1d2e51fbf32cdede4ff15708c8e0f7146221#diff-43eb30acee2bdc4ee65fbbc0fb41659bR167. @Krigpl Could you explain why computation_failed and on_computation_failed need to be two separate methods?. @Krigpl OK, sounds reasonable. I can't think of any better solution. Maybe just make on_computation_failed a protected method to make clear that it's supposed to be called from computation_failed only.. @maaktweluit This is only a fix for the unit tests, right?. Waiting for buildbot/control_build to finish now and I'll test it.. See https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-monitor/pull/60 for respective monitor changes.. @maaktweluit Could you pick up the \"TODO\"?. Is setup.py develop really supposed to install dependencies? I never run it without installing the requirements first.. @maaktweluit Could you explain the recent changes?. I can seee it still being nullable:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/10ec48f0d62dd2f8d222efcd20d3213f3dce2c8c/golem/model.py#L296. @maaktweluit The diff of the .aip file is much bigger than I expected. I'm not sure if I didn't mess up anything.. @maaktweluit It's a one-liner so I decided no to make into a separate file.. @mfranciszkiewicz No. This is why we still use stop_vm() and start_vm() in restart_ctx().. Update: Test show that suspending VMs also prevents IP changes. Which kinda makes sense because the VM would only make DHCP request during boot.. Running docker-machine start actually makes three SSH connections to the VM after it is started:\n1) To check if SSH is available:\nhttps://github.com/docker/machine/blob/eae38c196a2e10e4e11cc7b8d6dfe8863fb60519/libmachine/provision/provisioner.go#L104-L107\n2) To check what OS is running inside them VM so that appropriate provisioner class could be chosen:\nhttps://github.com/docker/machine/blob/eae38c196a2e10e4e11cc7b8d6dfe8863fb60519/libmachine/provision/provisioner.go#L109-L114\n3) To check if docker daemon is listening:\nhttps://github.com/docker/machine/blob/7a9ce457496353549916e840874012a97e3d2782/libmachine/provision/utils.go#L257-L258\nA single docker-machine ssh command takes ~12 seconds. This is quite suspicious but still none of these ssh connections is really necessary. To check if Docker daemon is running one can simply scan the appropriate port from outside the VM (if the env is set properly a simple docker info will do).. @maaktweluit @mfranciszkiewicz \nThis PR is ready for final review. I updated the description to cover all the changes.. Why?. @maaktweluit Yep, sure. Maybe update the commit message as well?. @ederenn Do you have logs from the provider machine? Or, even better, saved state of that machine?. @maaktweluit There is one thing you should double-check: If the SMB share is not created and you start Golem does it prompt to create it?. @maaktweluit \n\nThink you found a new bug, should i try to fix it in this PR or make a new issue?\n\nIt's up to you. But the fix must be applied before merging this PR. My concern is that even when the script is run on Golem boot the -WindowStyle hidden option might cause the prompt not to appear.. @maaktweluit It's fine. \ud83d\udc4d . @maaktweluit \nThe deal with uninstalling Docker Toolbox is that we're not sure if it's a good decision. Our UX experts decided that we shouldn't do that because if something goes wrong with Hyper-V users could easier go back to Docker Toolbox. But I wasn't sure about it so I only disabled this step in case wanted it in the future.. You can check much easier if Hyper-V is enabled. It is actually already done in HyperVHypervisor.is_available() method: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/6ec4e13fba79b011864d1b453afc78716164c31c/golem/docker/hypervisor/hyperv.py#L194-L202\nSo just modify _check_vt_windows() or get-virtualization-state.ps1 to include this command.. This behavior repeats. I attach the full log.\ngolem.log\n. And with loglevel=DEBUG:\ngolem.log\n. @jiivan You recently modified the line that raises the error.\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/commit/e7c24fa58979673600660fb572073bafc8a30a0a#diff-9f351727974c5655127c6a4dc0671995R144. @etam I'm not expert in marketplace but price / max_price looks much more reasonable than max_price / price.. There is a separate PR for develop (which also includes some additional changes): #3939 . Naming idea: it should be ProviderTaskSession and RequestorTaskSession not TaskSessionProvider and TaskSessionRequestor.. Apparently it's peewee's way of saying IS: http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/querying.html#query-operators. I find & more readable than comma. With multiple arguments I always wonder whether it means 'and' or 'or'.. Oh, yes, that's better.. What about get_nodes_with_overdue_payments?. I'll have to use & in line 117 anyway, so maybe enforce consistency the other way round and use & in lines 32-35 as well?. Nice idea, thanks for the tip!. Fixed.. Fixed.. Fixed.. Fixed.. @Krigpl This would probably require wrapping the whole logic in some db lock. Otherwise nasty things can happen.\nAlso: what about repaying overdue debts? Should we restore the lost reputation? Maybe partially? Or just ignore it?. Done.. Fixed.. get_timestamp_utc uses datetime.now which uses time.time. So how exactly is any difference possible here?. Really?\npython\n@classmethod\ndef now(cls, tz=None):\n    \"Construct a datetime from time.time() and optional time zone info.\"\n    t = _time.time()\n    return cls.fromtimestamp(t, tz). Yes, _time is the same as time.\npython\nimport time as _time. Ok, changed to get_timestamp_utc.. https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2373/files#diff-ee50db3879b3a935ba33b4de6f6b575dR1 \nThat space after = can cause a conflict. :P. Well, they are temporarily disabled. At some point we will probably re-enable this.. Summon @badb . @Krigpl It will be disabled on mainnet, but enabled on testnet. Check out the new commit.. Fixed.. @Krigpl This only shows that grep is not the best tool for checking if a function is called. Take a look at this method.. There is no RPC call for show_terms.. It should.. OK.. Just unnecessary.. OK.. That's a good idea, but it could be done in a separate PR. I don't want to postpone merging this one any longer.. This is not a good way to test multi-threaded code. If you want to test SenderThread as well add another test case.. Test should probably be renamed if you check all these data. Now it's called test_protocol_versions and the docstring says \"\"\"Test whether correct protocol versions were sent.\"\"\".. In the same directory?. Voil\u00e0.. I am not a fan of using plain assertions in unit tests. unittest.TestCase.failureException could be changed to a different exception class than AssertionError and then we get different test outcomes. I advocate using plain assert only in core code.. Fixed.. Good idea.. In test_monitor_messages. :stuck_out_tongue: . But yes, it should be called in tearDown.\n. Done.. Why hack pylint rather than make this method static?. You can as well use self.client instead of Account.client to avoid warning. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: . I'm not sure if score 2 counts as strong password.\n```python\n\n\n\nzxcvbn('golem.pass', user_inputs=['Golem', 'adam'])['score']\n2\n. No package version specified?. Alright, understood.. This line should be removed as well.. Why? Isn't it already disabled by `send_payment_info` flag in monitor?. It's not that we don't want them. We don't want them now, but we want this to reconfigurable. Removing this line basically makes the flag pointless.. OK, so maybe just move the flag to payment processor?. It can't be changed, because of https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/b0.15.1/golem/interface/client/tasks.py#L26\nI would have to change it for all methods in this module.. Why should it?. OK.. Why not simply `super().setUp()`?. `super().tearDown()`?. I'd encourage using `assertEqual()` in tests instead of plain `assert`. It makes possible to override the failure exception class and distinguish failed test assertion from other errors. Also running `python -O` disables all `asserts`. (See https://stackoverflow.com/a/2958450). Kinda ugly. There is no guarantee that the code will complete in the given time. Better return a `Deferred` from `publish()` and use `twisted.trial.unittest.TestCase` for testing.. I have a different opinion but, whatever, that's not an issue.. `TestDatabaseWithReactor` because it's the first superclass.. Done.. You mean something like this?python\ntry:\n    # here goes all code\n    return True, None\nexcept Exception e:\n    return False, e\n. `str(e)` for sure.\nBut I'll keep the type assertion. It enables type-checking. Of course it would be better to declare this field as of `TaskServer` type, but that would require a bigger refactoring.. Is it? I don't see any type declaration here: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/develop/golem/client.py#L156. I get nice hints from IDE when using type assertion:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9394821/39312957-0d25ce0a-4971-11e8-8c2c-84abd2138703.png)\nBut not with not-none check:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9394821/39312988-22f22882-4971-11e8-83cc-a5489e29cf2d.png)\n. OK, fixed.. Fixed.. Nope. It just resets calls to mocked methods. ([sauce](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.reset_mock)). Shouldn't it be `not msg.concent_enabled and self.concent_service.enabled`?. Yep, agree. I just copied the old code.. What do you mean?. The binary form is signed. It would be pointless to sign the signature.. Good catch, thanks.. Yes, but that's not really an error. Just reaching max/min size. I thought it would be easier this way but I can as well add some check before increase/decrease and not throw any AssertionError at all.. Fixed.. Fixed.. Fixed.. Fixed.. Fixed.. It's `self.k_size - int(math.log2(node_id_distance(peer, self.key_num))) - 1` actually.\n. OK, but I will change it elsewhere because it is not directly related to this PR.. Fixed.. Fixed.. Sure. Actually I was thinking about replacing this with:python\nnum_bits = min(num_buts, self.MASK_LEN - len(bits))\nif num_bits < 0:\n    raise ValueError\n. Fixed and updated tests to cover it.. Yea, exactly.. Floor gives masks that are possibly more restrictive i.e. yield less work offers (that's because the logarithm value is negative). This what we want because we could extend the mask later if no sufficient number of workers appear.. Ooops, will fix.. Done.. I can add another logging command in `get_next_subtask` but not here.. Ok, there you go.. Better now?. @jiivan Actually, you didn't include the f-string method in your logtest. I did and the difference for string argument is negligible:\n\n\n\n'message'\n           correct_logging: 1069.55ms\n         incorrect_logging: 1213.96ms\nnewstyle_incorrect_logging: 1250.48ms\n     format_string_logging: 1089.07ms\n\nAnd using f-strings is more readable than using `%s`.. I will leave it as it is. But we surely need some explicit, team-wide coding standards.. Fixed.. Maybe move this assignment to `CreatingTaskFailed.__init__()`?. :(. Actually it might be good idea to return `new_task_id` here as well.. @mdtanrikulu do you agree?. OK, done.. Returning a single `None` would make this assignment much uglier: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/6f614648d4b4d4c5be4068b22040c8cb0662cacb/golem/client.py#L936-L937\nI can go with `Union[Tuple[int, int], Tuple[None, None]]` if you don't like `Tuple[Optional[int], Optional[int]]`. Done.. OK, that's not a simple \"getter method\". You're welcome to rename it so that no one else gets confused.. This is a really bad function name. I'd suggest something more informative, e.g. `list_dir_recursive`.. Maybe `yield` instead? Caller could always wrap the call in `list()` if the result needs to be reused.. Type annotation would also be nice.. `Generator` takes 3 params. The return type should be `Iterator[str]`.. Line too long.. No newline at the end of file.. I modified `connect_to_network` to use only `opt_peer_num` hosts instead of all 100: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3112/commits/c90991a9b7e2c325066526092da6ad02cf7f9e54. `stderr` is redirected to `stdout` See line 25.. Why do we list all these versions (`Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000/XP/Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8 x86/Windows 8.1 x86/Windows 10 x86/`) when it works only on Windows 10?. I would encourage using `Path` class:python\nROOT_DIR = Path(get_golem_path())\nAPPS_DIR = ROOT_DIR / 'apps'\nIMAGES_INI = APPS_DIR / 'images.ini'\n. ??. Maybe add a `timeout`?. Why do we need such broad except clause while possible errors are very limited?. See comment for line 45.. In Python 3 you can writepython\nsuper().init()\n\ud83d\ude2e . What if `self._select_hypervisor()` succeeds but `self.command('help')` fails? Wouldn't it return false positive in such situation?. Why do we need such broad except clause while possible errors are very limited?. See comment for line 150.. `docker_vm_name` or simply `vm_name` would make a better field/variable name.. If `name` is an optional parameter we should probably add this as well:python\nname = name or self.docker_vm\n. Why `Optional`?. Is it really necessary to create a two-way dependency like this? `DockerManager.command()` calls the hypervisor's `COMANND_HANDLER` so why cannot hypervisor call it by itself?. `timeout`?. OK, I see it is done in the next PR.. This method (and `_pipe()` as well) looks like a general macOS/linux utility function rather than something docker-for-mac-specific.. I'd rename args to `source_cmd`, `sink_cmd`.\nAlso see comment for `_pid()`.. Isn't `wait_until_started()` necessary here?. Ok, so why not `None` (return type is `Optional`) and if for some reason empty string is better then why call `str()` instead of using literal `''`?. What is the actual benefit of having this `CONSTRAINT_KEYS` dict? The programmer still has to remember `'mem'`, `'cpu'` and `'cpu_cap'` keys. Maybe using an enum would be a better idea?. Pulling images may take long time, so probably not every one should have a timeout. But if checking vm's status does not finish in 1 minute then something is definitely wrong and we don't want to hang forever. This probably means we need some command -> timeout mapping instead of single constant.. Why?. Why not classmethod?. OK, built-in timeouts will do.. Aren't `memory_size`, `cpu_count`, and `cpu_execution_cap` guaranteed to be constant?. `-> None`. `-> Optional[int]`. `-> None`. This `'Running'` is a kind of magic constant, isn't it?. `: Optional[Hypervisor]`. `-> None`. `-> bool`. `-> bool`. These should be constants: `cpus`, `memoryMiB`.. Maybe extract lines 54-60 to a separate method `_get_config()` and re-use it in `_update_config()`?. @mfranciszkiewicz Is it possible to have two IPv4 addresses assigned to one network interface?. This will be only called for `vEthernet (Golem Switch)` interface so if someone assigns another IP we could just say \"Sorry, it's you fault. You are not supposed to mess up with this\".. This comma hurts me. \ud83d\ude3f We don't expect the argument list to expand, do we?. Maybe like this?python\nif not self.task_manager.check_next_subtask(...):\n     _cannot_assign(reasons.NoMoreSubtasks)\n     return\n. \ud83d\ude22 . I have following comments regarding this method:\n1) Parameter names are not explanatory to me. I could guess that `path` points to the file/directory we want to add to a zip archive and `ob` is probably some object representing this archive but it's not obvious. Type annotations would help too. And the role of `rel` argument is still not clear to me after reading the code.\n2) Are directory paths with trailing slashes handled well? As far as I can remember `os.path.basename()` returns empty string when called on such path.\n3) This method could be unit-tested by creating some temporary files/directories and mocking `ob`. Please add some unit tests. Apart from assuring correctness they would help to understand the function's desired behaviour.\n4) I'm not sure if silently skipping non-existent paths is a good choice. I'd rather go with raising an exception or at least displaying a warning.. Why compare only lengths? I'd say we should check if the directory structure is OK.. Done.. Done.. I'd say that empty value should represented as `None` instead of `{}`.. See prev. comment.. See prev. comment.. Maybe add something like this?python\n@property\ndef asssigned_task_id(self) -> Optional[str]:\n    return self.assigned_subtask.get('task_id') if self.assigned_subtask else None\n``\nAnd then just useself.assigned_task_id == task_id.. Because ofplatform.. Maybe, I'm not sure.\u00af_(\u30c4)/\u00af. :ballot_box_with_check: Fixed. What is the reason for this? To make classmethods work with@command?. This docstring seems outdated..result or []in line 89 suggests thatresultmight beNone. It should be handled here as well.. If you're sure this won't happen, just remove theor []. I'm fine with this.. Shouldn't we useavailableinstead offree`? Psutil docs state that:\n\navailable: the memory that can be given instantly to processes without the system going into swap. This is calculated by summing different memory values depending on the platform and it is supposed to be used to monitor actual memory usage in a cross platform fashion.. I'm afraid we might get tricked here since we're using the dynamic memory feature. Imagine the following scenario:\n1. The host machine has 8 GB of RAM.\n1. There's a VM running with 6 GB memory limit.\n1. The VM is not running any computations so the OS allocates only 1 GB of RAM to it.\n1. Other processes on the machine are using 2 GB of RAM.\nI suspect that in such case we would get information about 6 GB of free memory from psutil.virtual_memory() and 6 GB from hypervisor.constraints() thus ending up with max_mem_in_mb equal to 12 GB.\n\nI am not sure if this would actually happen but it needs to be checked and somehow rectified if true.. Point 2. is deprecated as well. And actually, I believe that this message should be somewhere else.. Wouldn't this cause the hypervisor try to change the memory every single time Golem starts? Since the actual memory limit would be different than the config value I believe that it would.\nAs far as I remember this was why I put this line in DockerManager and not in HyperVHypervisor:\npython\nmemory_size = memory_size // 2 * 2. Let me know if I get this right. Is this a bug in os-win that we're fixing by overriding?. Maybe just keep one option to accept all terms?. > Thought it was nice to only make this 128 rule inside windows\nAgreed. Maybe try to get the best of both worlds by introducing some new method like pad_memory in the Hypervisor abstract class?. Stopping the VM looks fine to me. It would be stopped anyway a moment later when the config is applied.. Are you sure this line is unnecessary? I see dir_manager being used in a few methods.. That's weird. I thought it was already moved to pad_memory method.. I was just wondering if this shouldn't be the default behavior in parent class. \ud83e\udd14 We don't want corrupt VMs for other hypervisors as well, do we?. Alright, just leave it like this then.. Well, this is about executing a command on a VM. I think it wasn't a good decision for docker-machine developers to name it ssh. Docker itself uses exec for this kind of command. Therefore I decided to rename it in our code.. >looking at the list only ls is replaced by list. the rest is named as the docker-machine command.\nWell, that's because other docker-machine commands are named reasonably.. This should not be ignored but committed. (Ref). I believe host_shutdown_action is the action triggered when host OS is being shut down. We still need to do it ourselves when shutting Golem.. I'll leave explicit.. I dunno how costly it is to call _get_max_memory() but if it takes long we could get rid of this call (we already retrieve the max memory in _check_memory()). This however would probably make our code uglier so only if _get_max_memory() is really costly.. This name is kinda cryptic. Why not simply process_ids?. What is pProcessIds array? Do you mean lpid_process?. Can't we just use cb_needed? Creating a separate variable for the reference kinda obscures the code for me.. Okay, I see now that this is WinAPI's Hungarian convention. But do we really need to follow it? It's totally confusing for me.. enumerate seems like a name of a function that returns some iterator. Maybe just init? Or even put this in new?. I'd go with a name like get_process_handle instead of open.. Doesn't PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS cover all permissions? If so why use the other two flags?. Maybe add some logger.info() here to inform about the performed operation?. Using logger.exception() you don't need to pass the error explicitly. Just a convenience.. What will happen if there are more? Will EnumProcesses fail or just limit the result?. I just meant that maybe we don't need a separate variable just to hold a reference to another variable. We could inline it. But if you feel like it's necessary feel free to ignore this remark.. IMO the previous version was more readable.. OK, there's missing parenthesis in the first line but still looks more intuitive.. Maybe publish_event could just take event name instead of dict?. I think that the amount of memory assigned after lowering is an important information and should be included in the event.. Could you explain why are these changes to StatusPublisher necessary. Constrain should be outside this if.. How do I use @patch on self.something?. Looks like a job for enum to me.. More like 'publish_event'. Well, it will do.. Maybe put it in HyperVHypervisor class with all the other constants?. Actually, if look into get_frame_subtasks you can see that None is returned also when task with the given ID is not found. This relates to the next except clause. If frame_subtasks is not None and getting task_state raises a KeyError it means that something bad has happened and taskmanager is in an invalid state.. As stated above it's more like \"invalid task_manager state\" than \"unknown task\". But do we even need this try/except if we use @run_safe decorator?. Where is this flag being set? I don't see it in the error handler.. OK, fine.. ",

MR is ready to merge: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/1923. @badb Yes, it continued to run. Normal logs followed with GETH statuses, etc.. Branch was rebased.. @badb Could we merge this PR?. I think we should merge this here, before splitting to another repo dedicated to buildbot, especially that our gitlab repo is not public.. Should we also generate another github repository with removed files for general public consumption?. Yes, that's ok with me. Let's make an issue for this so we can share buildbot roles as galaxy ones in the future.. seeds.golem.network was implemented in RR fashion for mainnet seed nodes some time ago. This task can be considered completed.. If we are concerned about users privacy we can also create a custom logging formatter that will scrub unwanted data from logs sent to our talkback service. Otherwise the data scrubbing is also implemented server-side.. As I have stated in golem-electron: This is something else, I believe we should have a distinctive option. And since this is opt-in (not opt-out) we would prefer rather --enable-talkback or something like this.. Will be resolved by merging https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2375. This issue was completed some time ago.. We've discussed it, it was a version diff between develop and b0.13.0. . This is done with proxy server and https://geth.golem.network:55555 is working.. I have added https://rinkeby.golem.network:2137 proxy to our AWS geth servers. Preliminary testing from Russian IP's seems to work.. Added bootstrap_go mainnet seed 51.38.49.60:40102 that should work with Russian IP address spaces.. I'm closing this issue as https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2927 was merged to 0.16.1. . @Slavenin Could you please head over to chat.golem.network and ping me (ktomala). I need some information that shouldn't be told publicly.. Please join #testers channel and just start the message with @ktomala I will respond to you and try starting private message.. Seems that user @Slavenin had all traffic redirected via SOCKS4 proxy. This isn't supported and wouldn't work.. Only remaining thing is low-priority seeds update. Seeds updated. Done and implemented in Buildbot. Buildbot integration tests is done and enabled.. We can somehow alleviate this problem with providing jump-hosts.. The cause for big slowdown is because of unzipping of archive contents inside EXE created by PyInstaller every time golemapp and golemcli starts.\nRecommended approach is to change .spec files from utilizing onefile option changing it to onedir.\nThis can be done by changing .spec file like this:\n```\npyz = PYZ(a.pure,\n          a.zipped_data,\n          cipher=block_cipher)\nexe = EXE(pyz,\n          a.scripts,\n          exclude_binaries=True,\n          name='golemapp',\n          debug=False,\n          strip=False,\n          upx=False,\n          icon=icon,\n          console=True)\ncollect = COLLECT(exe,\n                  a.binaries,\n                  a.zipfiles,\n                  a.datas,\n                  strip=None,\n                  upx=False,\n                  name='golemapp')\n```\nThis also will probably need adjusting buildbots and advanced installer.. I need to set up additional proxy outside of AWS.. @maaktweluit Yes it also applies to Hyper-V. Already fixed in #3369 . Everything is ready on buildbot side, just cannot be enabled before 0.18.0 release. Enabled some time ago. Closing. It seems that web3 implementation in Golem is working incorrectly, because when this error happens I have checked with issuing requests via curl to the specified Geth instances and they were responding correctly. I think it might be related to some masked issue with TLS negotiation. During the 502 Bad Gateway error there was also error with ethereum.web3 saying \"Connection refused\", but looking into tcpdump during this connection attempt it seemed that the packets are sent back to Golem client from the Geth instance.. Fixed with --disable-fallback flag on pypi-server. Updated to 1.2.5. Golem uses HyperG (https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-hyperdrive) for file transfer. Underneath Hyperdrive utilizes DAT protocol. This is not an issue per se, I'd recommend to ask such questions on chat.golem.network. Closing issue.. @avatar-lavventura I have pointed out the project source code. I don't know the specifics. This is a place for issues with Golem not the discussion forum, so I would recommend again going to https://chat.golem.network and asking your questions there..

Please wrap template variable in double quotes, i.e.:\nworker_master_hostname: \"{{hostvars[groups['master'][0]]['ec2_private_ip_address']}}\". Should we ignore ANSIBLE0017 for now?. This has to be done, because it will wait for winrm service to start (which starts up to 60 seconds after Windows launch). This is necessary so the next steps won't fail, especially when we will use on-demand workers (auto scaling).. This registers free disk space as a fact, so we can control how much space would be required.. When I have tested on windows 10 after VM starting this was required, otherwise there was problems and ansible failed unexpectedly. It means really no harm, except for a slight delay. I'd opt for leaving this here.. Ansible debug command prints the fact, it doesn't set it! set_fact is for setting the fact, which is used correctly here. If you want it as variable we can move it to defaults.. What do you mean? All previous fields are upper case. Only the ones much below are lower case. Ok, misunderstanding. Added FIXME comment as it will require enabling gather_facts: True which might be another can of worms. I'd suggest to do it with https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-internal/issues/49. Fixed those fields to be all capitalized. good point, will correct it. good find, will do. also good point. This will fail if block under with is not executed (not sure because of this handle_image_error - what it does exactly)?. I don't like this. This is prone to errors when ordering will change. Would suggest doing ordered dict and then creating a list out of it.. Same here. Should change to logging I think.. :joy_cat: . ",

If I remember correctly there was just left as an empty with no reason behind it, so I thought about it as a \"glitch\" that needs to be removed. Tx fee should be presented in ETH. We should take into consideration two scenarios during task creation. \nFirst is when gas prices are low, and the confirmation time of deposit should not take more than 5 minutes. In this case, a task is being created with \"Creating the deposit\" status: https://invis.io/UGNICBIREA5#/314104068_Task_Settings_Main___Concents_Copy_10\nThe time of deposit confirmation should not be taken as a part of a task timeout that was set by a user.\nSecond is when gas prices are high, and the confirmation time of the deposit will be higher than 5 minutes. In this case, we strongly recommend creating this task without Concent Service: https://invis.io/Q4NICAKXEJM#/314103867_Task_Settings_Main___Concents_Copy_8\n. @fredhampton All instructions provided here: https://golem.network/documentation/03-installation/installation-on-mac/ will work with Mojave. > Quick idea: If task has multiple frames, then put results in a subfolder that is named after task. If folder already exists, add suffix.\n\nSo for sequence of tasks with 2, 1, 3 and 1 frames the result would be:\ntask.png\ntask_1.png\ntask/task0.png\ntask/task1.png\ntask_1/task0.png\ntask_1/task1.png\ntask_1/task2.png\n\nThis sounds reasonable. I would also include timestamps (task creation) to those folders (not the filenames). . Output of golemcli commands that require change.txt\n. ",

How come it's a problem given that 11.0 was supposed to not require port forwarding anymore?  Router?\nIn any case, I just configured port forwarding and Golem seems to be rendering a task.  Note that I had my ports forwarded in the past and had been rendering successfully.  I don't know how that was somehow disabled.  . Ok thanks Marek.  I confirm Golem is rendering perfectly now.. There weren't any extra assets for this render.  Just one .blend file.\nI sent you the logs.. Currently, Golem is only meant to do rendering with Blender or LuxRender.  In the future, Golem will have increasing more functionality including the ability to do Machine Learning tasks and those involving Big Data Analytics.  \nIf you want to try out Golem, you can find Blender files here:  https://www.blender.org/download/demo-files/. I tried to reproduce this today (version 13.0) and it worked.  (7 identical tasks all of which simultaneously say \"Preparing\"). \n. Ah ok, great thanks @etam!. I received this error as well (yesterday) and I'm running Mac OS 10.13.5.  I've kept Golem running (instead of restarting) and it's even computed a task today with no problem.  I'd guess the subtask was too large given the RAM on my pc (only 8GB).  Months back when I was running the testnet, there were blender files I couldn't render (like Benchmark) because they were too large and IIRC it would just timeout.    . Just checked the logs again and it seems I encountered this error today too.  And it seems the file resource is the blender \"benchmark\" which, as mentioned above, my PC has never been able to compute most likely because of lack of sufficient RAM.. ",

I believe it's more or less okay but I think it would be better for @jiivan to have a look. blocked by https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/2260. @tworec it's a step towards a good direction but as @Krigpl said, it doesn't resolve anything with regards to the second issue for two reasons:\n1) someone might still generate a colliding task_id + subtask_id\n2) it doesn't resolve an issue of a perfectly normal task flow where one Provider fails the task and another Provider takes it -> since, if the subtask_id stays the same, the first Provider's message exchange history may still interfere with the second one's history ... we'd need to identify those messages using not only the subtask id but also the node the messages were exchanged with. @mfranciszkiewicz a good point - though, as you have suggested, I believe it's something to consider in the future maybe, not necessarily at this point now... as in, \"first make it work, then optimize\" ;). @jiivan hmm, in this case, I believe we could do with a single process for the service and use the multiprocessing module more directly... maybe using separate threads on a per-request basis, though the current implementation using twisted's LoopingCall locks the loop for the duration of a single execution and thus runs only one request at any given time.... needs discussion between @mdtanrikulu and @etam . This is the output rendered using Golem with 10 subtasks:\n\n. This is the output rendered using Blender directly:\n\n. @maaktweluit ah - well - I didn't know that you were running a different set of tests once the approvals are there... what I was thinking about was to separate the part that's executed after the approvals are added so that it can be executed quickly without a long wait. this probably happens when the ForceGetTaskResult message is sent the second time (after the timeout) after having been sent the first time earlier... . @dybi I believe this happens in case of a ForceGetTaskResult message since it has two modes of sending - in one case it's sent directly after a download error and the other if a download doesn't succeed before a timeout happens ... \nand I think there are (were?) actually two issues there:\n1) the second ForceGetTaskResult was not cancelled after the first was sent (maybe the cancellation of the delayed message happens only on success and is not done on explicit failure)\n2) the sending mechanism doesn't check if a signature exists and tries to sign the message the second time. @ktomala @mdtanrikulu \n\n. question: how do we check it's in fact the same scene? . @etam please communicate with @ktomala and establish the address that needs to be used here. discussed with @ktomala and the conclusion is that the observed issues were not caused by the \"ping me\" service . @jamuszyn is this only about golemcli network or generally about any CLI command? \ne.g. this is the ouptut of tasks:\n```\n$ ./golemcli.py tasks\noptional arguments:\n  -i, --interactive     Enter interactive mode\n  -a ADDRESS, --address ADDRESS\n                        Golem node's RPC address\n  -p PORT, --port PORT  Golem node's RPC port\n  -t, --verify-trust    Verify Golem node's certificate\n  -h, --help            Display command's help message\n  --json                Return results in JSON format\ntasks:\nabort               Abort a task\ncreate              Create a task from file.

(I haven't looked at the relevant code yet)? . @jamuszyn should be in ETH, right? ...\n@mdtanrikulu it doesn't require changes in Elector prior to this change, right?. the idea from our end was to construct some dictionary for possible values in ComputeTaskDef containing:\n the required docker image\n hash and/or name/path/etc of the ComputeTaskDef's src_code\n* required \"schema\" / attributes of ComputeTaskDef's extra_data which:\n may and will differ between different environments\n is abstract enough to include any arbitrary types of tasks (apart from Blender and LuxRender)\n must still support LuxRender as a reference \"other platform\"\n for blender - should provide a way to agree on the used script_src (via hash/name/path/etc? similarly to CTD.src_code -> maybe there should be a common mechanism to pass this information for both CTD itself and for extra_data components)\n. @kbeker re: script_package there should be some version - or - identifier - or - identifier + version (maybe the identifier could be a sha1 of the raw, unfilled script?) associated with the underlying script so that it would be more obvious that both parties see the same template.... @kbeker plus - another thing - there's this script_src which is sent inside ComputeTaskDef.extra_data -> are you planning to also supersede that with some reference to a file held in a separate dictionary?. > @shadeofblue After talk with @cameel he decided that the best way would be to put script which is in src_code to docker image or just to golem repository instead of keeping it in ComputeTaskDef. There is not any benefit for keeping it in ComputeTaskDef. It might be another change in Golem Messages.\n\nI think that we should split all changes into few smaller and changing it step by step to be sure that everything works correctly after every update. \n\nputting it in the docker image might not be the best thing - since we might want to:\n update the script itself without updating the docker images (they are pretty large)\n use the same docker image for two different task types (e.g. when the differences are cosmetic - e.g. GPU vs CPU rendering). > 1. src_code does not contain any hard-coded parameters, just code. It looks like a part of the implementation to me. It will need to be different for different tasks (it needs to know which executable to run) and maybe even for different versions of the program. \n\nSo instead of it being a template passed inside `TaskToCompute` it would be more natural to just have it as a script in the Docker image. It could take all its parameters on the command line. Or it could be a Python module that provides a function that accepts these parameters.\n\nI don't think we need to pass a path to it. It could just be in some standard location in the image.\n\nBut I think it would be better to do this in a separate issue and here focus on the `script_src` to keep changes small and easy to test and review.\n\n\nok, let's move it to a separate issue and not discuss it now\nRe: script_hash -> yeah, let's call it script_template_hash for the sake of clarity\n\n\nI think that scene_file_src should moved to the package with task source files (textures, blender/luxrender project, etc.).\n\n\nhmm.... I wouldn't do that as it doesn't solve the issue that we're trying to address - namely - execution of arbitrary code...\n\n\nThere should be more information about the schema. What types are expected for the fields? Which values are valid?\n\n\nhmm... well - those are just parameters to fill in template - they can be arbitrary depending on the task - I unsure if we should try to establish strict typing and/or validate those values - at least not here and now with this change... should we?... \n\nE.g. what are the allowed values in `output_format`? Do they have to be uppercase? Is it `JPG`, `JPEG` or both for .jpeg files?\n\n\n\nso, same as above - I don't think this should be validated... \n\n\n\nWhy is docker_images a list? Can there be more than one image?\n\n\nunsure - I'd leave it as a list\n. re: #4\nokay ... but this validation should then depend on the type of the task ... so maybe - in some dictionary that defines the neeed parameters for each type of task, there should be an additional dictionary that defines the type/validation criteria... still - I believe it would be an additional assignment - outside of the scope for this task here\nre: #3 \n@cameel sure, let's treat it as out of scope for this task. ok, after a heated discussion we have concluded this does not make any sense. @ederenn is this still an issue then? or can we mark it as resolved?. @ederenn has this reappeared? or can we close this issue?. resolved in: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3260. @jiivan please determine if this is an issue on our end or if it needs to be addressed in the Concent Service. @etam and what's the plan regarding the merge of #2702 ? . hmm... maybe the more interesting question is: why does __remove_old_tasks touch the same task that another node just issued a WantToComputeTask for (which suggests the task is still being computed)... . I believe it's fixed. allegedly fixed in: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3251. @etam oops, sorry, I meant test_client ... my bad. > I'm not sure if there is that much code repeated that makes it reasonable to pull out a common part. Such function wouldn't have even any meaningful name.\n\nI was thinking about moving creation of Client object into setUp, but it wouldn't work with some of test cases. Then I found that there's also a TestClientRPCMethods class, which is initializing a Client object in setUp, but it's not clear what's the distinction between it and TestClient class.\n\n@etam well, what's stopping us from creating a new TestClientRestartTask TestCase? ... generally, imvho, the test cases should be separate unless there is a good reason for them to be part of the same class ... ... so, if we have more than one test that requires a similar setup, that - imvho - constitues a pretty good reason to create a common TestCase class for them... . @etam approved -> the only issue is that we probably don't want to merge to b0.17.1 specifically... . [ note ] the tests show that this fix causes the restarted tasks not to be computed by the network - needs more investigation - or maybe - even some refactoring of the task restart functionality and related RPC calls. [ possibly resolved -> there's an integration test that checks this scenario and I believe it passes correctly ] . we should ensure that's still an issue by:\n1) running 0.17.1 on testnet by executing some tasks on it\n2) upgrading to 0.18.0 and seeing if Golem can still run normally and list already computed tasks. @mplebanski would you consider adding some tests for the purge_tasks method? both positive (where the task exists) and negative -> where the given id(s) are not found? ... . > @shadeofblue please clarify what do you mean by \"given id\" because purge_tasks does not take any input. It's a convenience wrapper over delete_task\n@mplebanski ah, yeah - right... my bad ... so just a positive test that ensures that indeed the delete_task is called for any tasks found should suffice... . superseded by https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3465. needs discussion with @jamuszyn . fix merged into 0.18.0. <3\n. @ederenn please verify if it's reproducible under 0.18.2 -> plus suggest a way to reproduce reliably. we need to add type casts to the task definition JSON. [ probably a temporary issue in requirements vs golem core code - we didn't see it afterwards ]. duplicate of: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/3398. @ederenn has this issue repeated itself lately? were there any more issues or just the error message?. @magdasta \ngolem.log\na full log from an integration test that reproduces the same issue. [ possibly resolved - there's an integration test that checks it ]\nthough, generally, there's some issue with integration tests on develop. [ maybe if it's indeed fixed, the fix should be cherry-picked into 0.18 ]. I believe it's fixed. @ederenn we know this node to have less than optimal amount of RAM so - while it would be good to know what caused that issue, I wouldn't treat it as important ... . @jiivan don't we have a \"pay.deposit.create\" to create the deposit? or it just happens on the first task added with Concent Enabled? . We should figure out whether that's something we can fix or whether we should just clearly state we don't (yet) support Ubuntu 18.10. @ederenn if possible, please upload the golem.db file from this instance. @zakaprov it looks like they're working for the Linux build but fail for Windows and MacOS ... https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/tree/replace-status-shield. @ederenn this is not about binary vs source but rather about develop vs stable ... we don't support downgrades from higher versions to lower ones. @ederenn could you please confirm if you can reproduce this issue?. @etam do you have an idea how to reproduce that issue so that we could verify the pull request indeed fixes it?. @mdtanrikulu are you sure that you aren't trying to run a mainnet node?\n. @jiivan wouldn't it be less of a hassle to just check if there is any contract defined? it seems very artificial to me to deploy such \"no-op\" contract just because we cannot implement a simple if/else in the code... . iow, I believe there should be a check if the concent is available and if not, just don't try to unlock/relock the deposit... . sure but the \"different logic\" is really just a single if/else ... I really think that's it's an overkill to deploy no-op contracts here... maybe let's implement a simple check now and once @Krigpl is back, we can let him decide whether he indeed also thinks having no-op contracts is better than just checking this in Golem itself.. @Krigpl your opinion needed... . @jiivan can this issue be closed then?. (apparently, this has been resolved already). @mdtanrikulu could you put any details re: the currently used RPC endpoint that you're using for gas price estimation into this issue here?\n. yeah, @pawelkisielewicz @jiivan the actual deposit can be made asynchronously but the check whether there are funds for the deposit can indeed be made immediately\n. @etam probably not -> that change has long made it to the stable version. hmm, I feel undecided here... on one hand, I understand this is mostly a refactor aiming to remove an unnecessary exchange of messages and in this case, I can only second @jiivan that - if possible - it shouldn't add statefulness to TaskSesssion but at the same time - I understand that it may be unfeasible at this stage to straighten-out the TaskSession in this pull request here... \nOn the other - I have one more uncertainty with regards to multiple-package resources and Concent - are we assuming those multi-package tasks right now just won't be supported by Concent? if so, maybe we should modify Golem not to allow the concent_enabled flag to be set on such multi-package tasks until we decide how we want them supported?\niow (in case we don't want Concent support for multi-package tasks right now):\n on Requestor's end, we'd need to respond with \"CannotAssignTask\" to any concent-enabled WTCTs referring to those tasks or more generally - disallow creation of concent-enabled, multi-package tasks\n on Provider's end (at this moment), ignore any TaskHeaders that are concent-enabled and refer to multi-package tasks (unsure if it's already possible to determine that such task is a multi-package task at this stage)\nOn the other hand, if we could probably enable the Concent to process such muti-package tasks but then as I said above - we'd need to enable the Concent to also verify those additional resources - most likely by adding package hashes somewhere in TTC or earlier... of course, we'd need to modify the Concent itself to enable such support in the service itself... . @etam is this pull request relevant anymore?. @ederenn how did it work before?. iow, please provide missing details:\nActual result\n(What is the result of this issue)\nExpected result\n(What is the expected result)\n. @ederenn please confirm that this feature used to work in version b0.18.X. @etam we could try to do that on the back end when starting the task - may indeed by trick-ish if there is nothing created when the task is started and only when it's finished... . @pawelkisielewicz could you provide some information on were exactly are you getting this error from? Golem? Concent? I suspect that's an issue with the validator itself... . anyway, @jiivan could you please have a look at it? I'm unsure - but if the error happens on deserialization, it's pretty obvious the validator will always fail as the deadline for the task will almost always be over when ForcePayment happens. fixed in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/pull/312. @ederenn please verify if this is still an issue. @zakaprov @ederenn this seems more like a \"feature\" than a bug ... . @ederenn please confirm if this is still an issue. @ZmijaWA okay, we have established this is an issue in Golem Electron @mdtanrikulu . @ederenn @mdtanrikulu is this still an issue?. I didn't expect the kind of Spanish Inquisition. @ederenn please confirm if this is still an issue. @pawelkisielewicz please change base to develop - it wasn't supposed to be included in 0.19. anyway @rkondziolka pls, update requirements-to-freeze too . okay, it requires testing, which in turn, requires the pip package to be uploaded ... please merge only after tests confirm that it fixes the issue. @rwrzesien for the question above: 2 -> failing now. wlochaty 3 anim.zip\n@rwrzesien actually, please add an actually animated scene to the test packages (attached) and make the test use this scene (using the --task-package kwarg in the test).  @zakaprov @pawelkisielewicz  do you have any idea on the status of this pull request?. fixed in Electron. descoped. @Krigpl how did it go? a single repo for everything ? ... and now what?. @etam actually, that's probably indeed a good idea\n. sigh... okay @zakaprov please change the name of the function to is_virtualization_satisfied or is_virtualization_requirement_satisfied ... . @ederenn does this error have any influence on Golem's functioning?. Do we really need to enforce such a limitation? both values are under requestor's control -> what sense does it make to force the user to update their settings just because they want to set a higher price for the task they're creating? ... I believe it's just a matter of naming -> it shouldn't be named max_price but rather default_price...\n@jamuszyn opinion?. @etam there's a pretty good chance that once we implement message queues, the tasksession's scope will change and especially, we will be able to remove state from TaskSession altogether... \ncc: @jiivan . @etam let's talk about it when @jiivan and you are at the office next Monday so that we can all be on the same page ... I'm just of an opinion that it doesn't make sense to start working on this issue here without taking the message queues into consideration. @kbeker I think it should be resolved by porting the changes that we made on the base blender image for non-gpu computations to the NVGPU image. (sorry, accidental). :open_mouth: . \n. @ZmijaWA added you as the default assignee as per the \"verifier\" role in the \"User support\" flow doc. @jiivan I think I'd second @etam here and - of course, acknowledging that it's that much of a problem - I'd be for including the tests into the library so they can be reused, especially that we'll most likely have more and more code even there and it seems a waste indeed to have to maintain two copies... . hmm... have those statuses proved unnecessary?. @jiivan it may be useful to provide a short docstring here to explain what resources are in this context so that someone reading the code has some initial idea of what the mixing implemented here pertains to... . I'd generally name those factories SomethingFactory to eliminate possible confusion between the factory classes and the message classes... . @jiivan hmm... yes, of course, I know those classes exist in separate modules and can be referred to using the namespace prefix... maybe it's a matter of personal preference though... I'm somehow reluctant to have classes named the same when they're closely related.... @jiivan right. @jiivan this exception seems partially duplicated ... maybe it would be more sensible to first check for 2xx and if it's okay, just break the execution flow and only it's not generate some logging messages and/or exceptions?... or provide a more DRY handler that you'd call with:\nhandle_concent_error(response, exception, reason)\nthat would construct the appropriate logging messages and/or exception messages?. @mfranciszkiewicz well, it's about retrieving ReportComputedTask which is needed to construct ForceGetTaskResult -> and the \"can't find message\" for the ReportComputedTask is anyway logged in the get_task_message helper. @mfranciszkiewicz ah, right, good catch :+1: . the sentence lacks a verb... I'd suggest act ? and for proper grammar -> should act as if it _had_ sent #nitpicking #sorry ;). :D naughty Concent! naughty! ;). nice :+1: . :+1: . :+1: . @mfranciszkiewicz aye!. fyi, I started introducing a provider_concent_history and requestor_concent_history decorators to complement the earlier ones that could be used for concent messages but sure, it can also be explicit.... hmm... I thought about it for a while after my updates to the factories in golem-messages on Thursday and I do believe , we shouldn't provide subfactories for all the messages by default and rather provide separate ways to generate objects containing different messages... the reason is that e.g. here - if we decided that we want to have a RejectReportComputedTask with a nullified TaskToCompute, it would automatically mean that all the other sub-messages would be broken too. @jiivan I wouldn't call that \"Impossible\" ... rather, \"Illegal\" maybe?. @jiivan not quite... \n```\nIn [1]: class JivanPrintable:\n   ...:     def str(self):\n   ...:         import pprint\n   ...:         return pprint.pformat(self.dict)\n   ...:     \nIn [2]: from golem.core.printable_object import PrintableObject\nIn [3]: class A(PrintableObject):\n   ...:     def init(self):\n   ...:         self.dupa = 'dupa'\n   ...:         \nIn [4]: class AA(PrintableObject):\n   ...:     def init(self):\n   ...:         self.a = A()\n   ...:         \nIn [5]: class B(JivanPrintable):\n   ...:     def init(self):\n   ...:         self.dupa = 'dupa'\n   ...:         \nIn [6]: class BB(JivanPrintable):\n   ...:     def init(self):\n   ...:         self.b = B()\n   ...:         \nIn [7]: a = A()\nIn [8]: b = B()\nIn [9]: aa = AA()\nIn [10]: bb = BB()\nIn [11]: str(a)\nOut[11]: 'A '\nIn [12]: str(b)\nOut[12]: \"{'dupa': 'dupa'}\"\nIn [13]: str(aa)\nOut[13]: 'AA >'\nIn [14]: str(bb)\nOut[14]: \"{'b': <main.B object at 0x7f16fe2da668>}\"\nIn [15]: \n``. hmm, right, but in such a case, it should then be moved into the API of the appropriateForceGetTaskResult[Upload|Download]classes ... I'll leave that as an excercise for some future update ... generally, this piece of code was earlier included as a part of the handler and just moved outside of the method for DRY reasons.... @jiivan ah, probably not...  just my PyCharm complained those were missing.... @jiivan maybe__noop? or maybe just definelambda: Noneas the default forafter_successandafter_errorbelow without adding this function?. @jiivan hmm, indeed, good catch, it was about not includingheader.encrypted` in the comparison ... but on the other hand, we might consider not including it in the equality check altogether ->  https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/pull/187  \nwould there be any reasons against such a move?. @jiivan I'm unsure here but maybe this cancellation should be performed first, before we start the verification... otherwise, theoretically we can request a forced download even after we have received the result - since we do have the extracted package by now... \n(and yes, I'm aware that this is not a new issue). @jiivan hmm... I don't think this is a good idea to just do nothing in case we're using concent -> it doesn't make sense to wait until the timeout if we're sure that the direct download didn't succeed and the specific action of dispatching the FGTR here should be triggered immediately.... generally, I'm unsure if resources is the best place for this handler... I have a feeling this module's logic should know as little about Golem's and Concent's protocol as possible and should only be concerned with the download of the resources... \nwouldn't the taskserver be a better place for this piece of logic? . @jiivan ah, right, okay :+1: . :+1: \n. I was wondering whether we shouldn't rather fix the test not to use a file in the source tree ;p. @jiivan I wouldn't use UC3 in debug messages as I think it's too \"niche\" -> maybe rather \"end of the Force Accept scenario\"? . :+1: . I really think we should be looking up those messages also using the node id ... . ah, right :)\n. yeah, that's why I'm not completely sure... . ?. typo ? ; instead of ' ? . isn't this assert slightly superfluous? after all, we're performing more specific checks in the specific tests below... . please make the timedelta argument a keyword argument so that it's obvious what value that timedelta actually is. :grinning: . I wouldn't place this comment here ... there are more tools that depend on the existence of the init file ... - e.g. ipython won't provide you with completion, etc... . so, I believe it should be just concent_variant here, the default value of which, should be golem.core.variables.CONCENT_CHOICES.get('disabled')\n. just variant. just variant. and I think it would be good to call this parameter concent_variant so that it's perfectly clear the variant of what we're referring to... . btw, why does it default to staging here all of a sudden?. wouldn't it be more future-proof to check just e.g. the URL? I imagine we might add some setting later on that wouldn't be crucial but could be None as a default and it would fail this check.... and again, why a different default yet here?. maybe the debug message should say msg concent enabled: instead of just msg enabled?. or even ttc concent enabled:. and I'd change it to either _cannot_compute or maybe _cct as the lone \"cannot\" sounds awkward-ish to me ... . @Krigpl I believe it's part of the protocol so indeed, it should be included in golem_messages... . hmm... but doesn't it mean that we're making ourselves more dependent on a single test tool? I'd also be in favor of using the assert methods rather than raw asserts? ... . @jiivan maybe make it a setting in the golem variables?. hmm... does the golem client always have access to the source directory?. @jiivan is this part responsible for making a file from the source available in the binary package?. @etam uhm this is a test, mind you... . hmm... @jiivan wasn't the report_computed_task validation/logging needed here?. ah, gotcha. @Krigpl good point indeed, sir, good point. @jiivan shouldn't the 3 be some kind of a golem.core.variables setting? ... or something?\n. v2.10.0. v2.10.0. yes, generally, I came to a conclusion that even in the regular run, the debug loglevel is sometimes beneficial to verify some interactions. LAR? shouldn't it be RAL ? . s/payed/paid/. what's stopping us from implementing \"pay\" and \"sleep till timeout\"?. :+1: . @jiivan you mean, there's no way to abort an already-started transaction, right? or do you mean that we have no way to tell the requestor node not to send a payment that's in the waiting period (for which the blockchain transaction has not yet already been started)?. @jiivan hmm... shouldn't we somehow take the amount_paid and amount_pending into consideration here? ... and, e.g., maybe only update those incomes for which the sum of expected incomes is lower than amount_paid? ... . I thought that it would be an incentive for you to improve SCI so that such depencency is not needed ... or something ;p. nah, that's actually useful in case of a failure. :+1: sure. actually, I did it to make it clear that this is the only function from the library that we're intending to use here and not the whole library. bandaiD. you mean, French bander?. @etam honestly, I have no idea - I'll check if the tests pass without that line but generally, as you can see, this pull request doesn't add that reaction callback - it only updates the code to use the newer golem-messages API. @Krigpl okay, added issues that will change that:\n\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/3206\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/issues/252\n\nplease add one that will add the appropriate call to the ETS API and link it as a dependency, thank you :). please remove the link to the issue... . it doesn't need to be an ordered dict, actually ... but yeah, a good idea!. @tworec added -> though the reason can be twofold. @etam shouldn't this go into some helper factory method so that we don't need to repeat this sequence of operations in each test?. it would probably be good to refactor these tests instead... . @jiivan hmm... if both the timelock and now are expressed in seconds since epoch (and btw - are we sure that timelock is an int? asking because time.time() is a float)) wouldn't timelock > now mean that it's \"unlocking\" and timelock < now (which means that timelock is in the past relative to now) mean that it's already unlocked? ... . @jiivan is this needed? peewee should automatically create a primary key id in case none is specified... shouldn't it?. I wonder -> shouldn't we think ahead and already implement an interface for pagination? iow, add limit and offset parameters to the call, filled by default with 1000 and 0 respectively, so that we can later implement the pagination on the front-end when we decide so?\nI'm mentioning that because there already are concerns about lack of pagination in our RPC calls... so maybe it would be good to stay future-proof when we implement new calls.... (same here - or rather - actually here) I believe Peewee should add the identity field automatically... . hmm. I'd move the comment to the line above to make the pylint ignore redundant... . exactly as @Krigpl said. @rwrzesien hmm, I know this had been there before - but maybe it would be good to put the decode_hex(address) lookup first so that it doesn't need to be converted twice (here and in line 45 below). adding a way to ensure this: \nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/issues/262. @rwrzesien please correct me if I'm wrong but msg here is a TaskToCompute, isn't it? so I believe it should be:\nwant_to_compute_task.verify_signature(\n    decode_hex(msg.provider_public_key)  # we can use the helper here actually... \n)\nam I missing something?. @rwrzesien btw - does it work this way? I mean - shouldn't this line be a link to github's commit? like this: https://github.com@4r/golemfactory/golem/pull/3317/files#diff-b4ef698db8ca845e5845c4618278f29aR34 ? . @rwrzesien @cameel (disregarding the fact that here something else is happening) hmm, well it would be better to just replace the occurences of eth_account with ttc.provider_ethereum_address anyway sooner or later... so if we can do it here, all the better... . @rwrzesien as I was afraid -> it doesn't work that way: https://buildbot.golem.network/buildbot/#/builders/9/builds/6583/steps/2/logs/install_requirements -> please replace the requirement with a link to the github commit (and once the golem-messages counterpart is released we'll be able to put the correct version here before merging). @rwrzesien on second thought -> it may make little sense to verify the signature of the want_to_compute_task against the included provider_public_key here - remember, we're the provider and the message had been generated by us - so, it would actually make more sense to verify that the attached WantToComputeTask is our message, so, instead, we should probably do the following:\nwant_to_compute_task.verify_signature(self.task_server.keys_auth.ecc.raw_pubkey)\nto ensure the message had been generated by us... \n. @rwrzesien so yeah, I believe the relevant validation has been added to golem-messages. @rwrzesien I believe it would be safer to specify the relevant key in the call to TaskToComputeFactory above with:\nwant_to_compute_task__provider_ethereum_public_key = self.provider_keys.raw_pubkey,\nwant_to_compute_task__sign__privkey=self.provider_keys.raw_privkey\nto ensure the WantToComputeTask is signed correctly... but maybe the handlers here don't check that condition.... @mplebanski I'm unsure if it's a good idea to hardcode mainnet data directory in one more place - it's already defined in golem.config.environments.mainnet.DATA_DIR ... so I'd expect that value to be used, not an arbitrary value that happens to be the same as that one... \nso, instead of adding another parameter to get_local_datadir, I'd rather just use golem.config.environments.set_environment exactly as it's used in golemapp.py... . I wouldn't add the data_subdir parameter here (see the other comment). :D https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3348#discussion_r220587771. is this needed?. sigh... there are more such sleep statements in the code there ... and they are used so that anyone running the tests is not spammed with repeated Cannot find the new task ({}) messages but instead the test waits more patiently for the deposit to happen... . hmm... unsure if it makes a difference here... I'm finding the used syntax more readable... . RenderingTaskBuilderError perhaps?. why are we looking for partial matches instead of just verifying equality? plus, why would there ever be more than one candidate? shouldn't we just check for exact equality and only ever find one match or none?. again, I'm unsure why we're specifying a partial path -> I think it should be exactly the same path as is specified in resources. I would just add an optional main_scene_file parameter to _scene_file and do the check inside that function instead of performing this conditional assignement... but that's up to taste... . should cpu be a literal string here? isn't it defined as a contant anywhere?. @etam I'm unsure I understand the removal of the check here... especially since you don't seem to be checking for the possible AttributeError that may result from uninitialized task_server in any places that use this property... . whoM .... on the other hand, can self.key_id be None in within a correctly initialized TaskSession ? isn't a session always initialized with the other party's node id? . @etam in that case, I think this message it not really useful... it should rather say e.g.\nSubtaskResultsAccepted received within an improperly intialized TaskSession - key_id is empty.\nor something like that ... otherwise, it's completely unclear what the meaning is without looking at the specific line of code here... . @etam @Krigpl correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think we can completely eliminate the check_requestor_for_subtask and just replace it with is_income_expected since we specifically modified Golem not to generate the Income record before SRA is issued... so this is mostly a fix for older awaiting transactions for which the comp_task_keeper record has already been removed ... but for the currently processed subtasks, we should still rely on that check and not on existence of the expected payment... Am I right, @Krigpl ?. yep, but that requires extensive knowledge of TaskSessions internal functioning... and won't tell anything to a less informed user... . indeed, it's not to check whether the message itself is properly signed - that's done during the deserialization - but rather whether the whole message chain is correct and that all messages belong to the expected parties. @jiivan do we mean that it will be checked during deserialization?. it would probably make sense to pull that copy + sign operation to a separate function method since it seems it can be used more than in just one place. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5790860/and-vs-list-and-dict-which-is-better#5790954a\n... just sayin' . @dybi I use the latter but I'm unsure if that's a organization-wide rule. hmm... now that the location of the modules is more or less stabilized I think it's more readable and concise to just use the relative ones ... . @dybi vi artifact? ;). @zakaprov that's a regular pytest syntax ... but sure, we can add an example like that\n. unneeded formatting prefix\n. @jiivan why did we get rid of the structure? I think it does make sense to wrap those kinds of pieces of functionality in self-contained classes like this... . wouldn't it be better to have explicit on/off calls instead of a toggle?. I'd prefer something like this here:\nif not client.concent_service.enabled:  # `enabled` implies `available`\n    raise CreateTaskError(\n        \"Cannot create task with concent enabled when \"\n        \"Concent Service is \" + \\\n        ('switched off' if available else 'disabled')\n    )\n. @dybi  ... on the surface, this function seems generic but really it's only applicable to a very specific case and hardly reusable... wouldn't it make sense to just get rid of that key specifically in the _build_parser without having a separate function for this task? . wouldn't copy.deepcopy seem more natural here?. why capital V? ... . suggestion\nand not sending out the payments. suggestion\nRequestor Node not sending out the payments. suggestion\n        return self.task_settings_dict.get('options', {}).get('format'). hmm, is this a new thing, @zakaprov ?. suggestion\n        :param outgoing: if `True` we're waiting for an outgoing message. hmm... right... unsure why I didn't do that ... . yes. suggestion\n    def task_settings_dict(self): -> dict. suggestion\n    def task_settings_dict(self) -> dict:. ah. actually, this could probably go to ConcentBaseTest ... . suggestion\n    def test_requestor_already_paid(self):. @dybi if we're using the TaskHeaderFactory, I don't think we need to hand-generate the Node and provide the task_id and other values here... we can most likely just use the factory as is ... (and possibly, maybe, fix the factory if it doesn't produce a usable TaskHeader + Node ... . @mdtanrikulu line endings? ... . thank you! :). indeed... especially, that we take care to correctly decode the string using the system's locale and then just check the string directly against English... . I believe both syntaxes are no more or no less \"correct\" ... just one applies the patch against the whole method and the other is more useful if the patch is supposed to be active in a specific context... . iow, I wouldn't change it in this case to the other syntax. ah, that... I thought @etam preferred the CM to decorator... . okay, I'll try to remember that, although in this case, I'd say it's not worth a separate commit ... . hmm, DictSerializer does a bit more processing and I believe it handles other types of objects as well ... and - on the other hand - I'd say - to paraphrase ducktyping - if it gives keys like a dict, it can be treated as a dict... alternatively, I can put the subsequent line in a try/except so that any objects that do pass the iteration over keys are handled correctly and those that are not are just passed as str(result) ... . @mfranciszkiewicz ^ updated. unsure, but putting it there just in case.... why is the version name so strange?. + shouldn't the requirements-to-freeze also be updated?. curiouser and curiouser... . hmm... I'm unsure ... right now, ResourceList servers as a point to exchange the resources but the list is always assumed to contain just one element ... and then, when e.g. the resources are passed to the Concent, they're passed in a different way (using HTTP, not p2p) and are verified thanks to the hash contained in TTC itself ...\nif now resources could comprise of multiple parts, hashes of each part would need to be specified somehow if Concent was to be able to verify each of them ... \nso, the list here is not only needed, but actually, @badb the list should probably be a list of dicts (?) containing both locations (p2p IDs of those files) but also hashes of those files .... @pawelkisielewicz could we have 'abcabc' defined in one place instead of two?. actually, probably a staticmethod. though - we should probably make the task multi-frame and make sure only the specified frame is restarted and all of them... . @jiivan \ud83d\udc4d \nadded:\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/issues/323\nhttps://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/3898\n. and not the other way round? ... . @pawelkisielewicz modifying an external value inside a function doesn't sound like a good engineering practice, does it? ... . (object) is not needed in python 3... . @pawelkisielewicz os.makedirs?. @Krigpl it would be good to either add a type hint for the second value or maybe just add a comment what it is when not None ... . @badb there seems to be something not quite right here... unless I'm misreading...\nwhat I mean is that previously, the size here had always been set to the resource size specified in the task header... \nright now, the only call to this method that specifies the size, uses the ReportComputedTask.size which is not the resource size but rather the result size ... is that indeed what we need here? am I wrong?. @pawelkisielewicz why are we removing the separators here?. and same here -> please add spaces for readability here. and pls, don't remove the separating line here. if we already have shutil imported, wouldn't it be better to just call shutil.copyfile rather than import copyfile again? especially that for someone reading the code, it may not be perfectly obvious that copyfile comes from shutil ... and actually, same with functools.wraps... although, maybe indeed in the latter case it's a bit more obvious... . @pawelkisielewicz please move the key reuse code to a conftest inside scripts or actually scripts/node_integration_tests so that this setting doesn't interfere with regular unittest runs. @pawelkisielewicz as mentioned above, please move this code to a location more specific to these tests here. :+1: \n. @pawelkisielewicz the point was not to pollute the global conftest.py with something that's used only in the node_integration_tests... . @pawelkisielewicz not quite what I meant ... :/\n. I believe it should be an ERROR not WARNING. I'd update this error message to be more meaningful, e.g.:\nCannot enqueue task: golem is running in a limited-functionality state,\neither because of an initiated shutdown or because of an environment misconfiguration.\nTo be able to create new tasks, toggle shutdown mode off or consult golem log to resolve the configuration issue.\nor something like that... . + maybe mention that the error pertains to either Docker or the the keystore ... ? (unsure what the previous error messagekeys or docker meant ... ). @zakaprov or maybe the message in the EnvironmentError is meaningful enough to include it in this logged message?. @jiivan actually, just by should be removed. suggestion\nTo achieve that, we can disable key reuse for this particular test by adding the. suggestion\nassignees: 'ZmijaWA'. right, I'll rather just change the name to something else, thanks :)\n.

Instead, if the hash does not match, it responds with HTTP 400 (containing a JSON message with an error) to the request that uploads the data.\nSo effectively it's not possible to successfully upload invalid files and this case never occurs.. Oh, OK. It was just just a clarification anyway.. @Krigpl The checks based on app version should be replaced with ones based on protocol version, right? Or are protocol version checks already present somewhere else and the app version checks should be removed completely? I think it's the former but everyone reading the description seems to have a different interpretation :) Could you clarify? . 1. src_code does not contain any hard-coded parameters, just code. It looks like a part of the implementation to me. It will need to be different for different tasks (it needs to know which executable to run) and maybe even for different versions of the program. \nSo instead of it being a template passed inside `TaskToCompute` it would be more natural to just have it as a script in the Docker image. It could take all its parameters on the command line. Or it could be a Python module that provides a function that accepts these parameters.\n\nI don't think we need to pass a path to it. It could just be in some standard location in the image.\n\nBut I think it would be better to do this in a separate issue and here focus on the `script_src` to keep changes small and easy to test and review.\n\n\n\n\nField script_hash should be sha1 script hash\n\n@kbeker You left this in the decription but script_hash is no longer in the example.\n\n\nI think that scene_file_src should moved to the package with task source files (textures, blender/luxrender project, etc.).\n\n\nThere should be more information about the schema. What types are expected for the fields? Which values are valid?\nE.g. what are the allowed values in output_format? Do they have to be uppercase? Is it JPG, JPEG or both for .jpeg files?\n\n\nThere's something wrong with nesting in your examples. Why is } at the same level as the last ]?\n\n\nWhy is docker_images a list? Can there be more than one image?\n\n\nIs script_hash in your proposal supposed to be generated from the script or from the template?\n\n\nMaybe it would be a good idea to split script_src into two modules? One would be the static, located in the image or in Golem source, and would import a smaller script that only sets variable values. Or returns a dict that the static script uses to set variable values. Only the smaller script would be a template. Or it could be just a JSON dump of a dictionary.\nThis way we would not really need to use hashes as versions. We could have a version as a simple integer. Combined with task type it would identify the script to use.. > > 4. There should be more information about the schema. What types are expected for the fields? Which values are valid?\n\n\nhmm... well - those are just parameters to fill in template - they can be arbitrary depending on the task - I unsure if we should try to establish strict typing and/or validate those values - at least not here and now with this change... should we?...\n\n\n\n\nI think that all the parameters that go into the template should have clearly defined types and should be validated. If we allow anything in them and just embed them in the template verbatim without checking, someone could put a part of the script in them.\n\n\n\nI think that scene_file_src should moved to the package with task source files (textures, blender/luxrender project, etc.).\n\n\nhmm.... I wouldn't do that as it doesn't solve the issue that we're trying to address - namely - execution of arbitrary code...\n\nOK, it may be out of scope for this task. But what do you think about doing it in general, in a separate task? This really seems like it's a part of the source (analogous to the .blend file) rather than parameters that should be in TTC.. @shadeofblue \n\nre: #3\n@cameel sure, let's treat it as out of scope for this task\n\nI wanted to define an issue for it but when I dug deeper I discovered that this parameter should not even be in TaskToCompute.\nIt seems that @kbeker included it because it's a parameter in run_lux_renderer_task() similarly to how script_src is a parameter in run_blender_task(). But if you look at how LuxTask obtains this value you'll see that it reads it from a file whose path is in main_scene_file. So it's not something that the requestor puts in TaskToCompute. It's probably already a part of the .zip package with scene definition.\nThe TaskToCompute for LuxRender probably contains just the path - main_scene_file. Or maybe not even that - the code could be generating this path just before rendering by looking at the source package.\n@kbeker Please get a real sample of a LuxRender task and make sure that all the fields you proposed are really there. scene_file_src should definitely not be there.\n\nre: #4\nokay ... but this validation should then depend on the type of the task ... so maybe - in some dictionary that defines the neeed parameters for each type of task, there should be an additional dictionary that defines the type/validation criteria... still - I believe it would be an additional assignment - outside of the scope for this task here\n\nI have created an issue for this in golem-messages (since I think that's where the validations should go): https://github.com/golemfactory/golem-messages/issues/260\n\n\n\nWhy is docker_images a list? Can there be more than one image?\n\n\nunsure - I'd leave it as a list\n\nFound it: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/blob/0.17.1/golem/docker/task_thread.py#L87-L94\nLooks like the idea is that it should list all the images that could potentially be used to render this task and Golem uses the first one that's available in its local Docker registry.\n\nputting it in the docker image might not be the best thing - since we might want to:\n\nupdate the script itself without updating the docker images (they are pretty large)\nuse the same docker image for two different task types (e.g. when the differences are cosmetic - e.g. GPU vs CPU rendering)\n\n\nI have created a separate issue for this and also posted a response there: https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/3309#issuecomment-421157419. @shadeofblue This a proposal and rationale for one of the changes mentioned in comments of #3066. Please review it and tell me if you think it could be done as described or if you have some reservations.\nI've assigned you just as an indication that this is waiting for feedback from you (though feedback from anyone from Golem team is welcome). When we agree how to proceed, @PaweuB can assign someone from Concent to implement it (@kbeker, @Jakub89, @dybi or @rwrzesien).. @shadeofblue To address you concerns from https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/3066#issuecomment-418351561:\n\nputting it in the docker image might not be the best thing - since we might want to:\n- update the script itself without updating the docker images (they are pretty large)\n\nDocker images consist of layers and the layers that are identical are stored only once. Every layer has a unique hash, like a git commit. Each command in Dockerfile builds on top of layers below it and creates a new one in the process. Docker aggresively caches these layers when you build an image by comparing the commands against ones that were used to build layers found in images that are already available in your local registry. It two images start with the same commands, they will share the layers up to the first difference in their Dockerfile.\nIn the case of this issue the script should be placed at the end of the file so that in case a modification all layers below it can be reused and building a new image only adds one new layer that's the size of the script rather than a whole new image.\nThe only thing to keep in mind is that the new image should be built on a machine that already has the old image in its local registry (--cache-from option may be needed if it was built on a different machine). Otherwise Docker will actually execute the commands and layers will be recreated from scratch which will most likely result in them having different hashes (usually due to newer file timestamps in the filesystem).\nHere's detailed info Docker cache and layers:\n- Best practices for writing Dockerfiles > Leverage build cache\n- How to Maximize Your Docker Image Caching Techniques\nAlso, we can do #3311 which could slim down the images a bit without any downsides.\n\n\nuse the same docker image for two different task types (e.g. when the differences are cosmetic - e.g. GPU vs CPU rendering)\n\n\nThis is trivially solved by putting two scripts in the image and calling one or the other. We would only need a parameter in TaskToCompute to indicate which one to use. I stated in the description above that this should be done based on task_type but we could just as well have an additional parameter to allow selecting various variants of the same task. Or we could even leave the choice up to the provider - as long as the result verifies as correct he could render any way he likes. But if you wanted to allow him to render only in a few sanctioned ways - that's all the more reason not to allow including arbitrary scripts in TaskToCompute.. I can assign people but I don't have permissions to change your permissions :) Someone else has to do it.. Do you mean this?\n\nFIX: update fallback URL to https://pypi.org/simple since pypi.python.org\nhas shut down\n\nIf I understand correctly, this will make the server redirect to the HTTPS URL rather than the HTTP one. So this will work around the HTTP 404 problem reported by @bartoszbetka above if @ktomala updates to 1.2.2 and re-enables the redirect.\nThe thing is that the HTTP 404 should not be a problem. It's normal for a package not to always be present in all the registries. I've found an old, but still open issue in pip's bug tracker: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4580. It describes the exact same problem, though between older versions (8.1.2 and 9.0.1). I think it's a bug in pip so I dropped a comment there.\nThe people in the issue say that it happens only when using --no-cache-dir. And indeed for us this workaround works too. But it's not ideal because when building Docker images we don't want the cache. The workaround for the workaround is to remove the cache manually after installing packages.\nSo, to summarize:\n- @ktomala has disabled the HTTP redirect which is the right solution in my opinion but sadly pip seems to have another bug that makes it unusable without the redirect.\n- Not using --no-cache-dir is one of the workarounds.\n- Keeping the redirects on the server is another workaround that should work, but requires upgrading to pypiserver 1.2.2.\nIf we want to keep the redirects then perhaps we should replace --extra-index-url with --index-url in requirements? Because with redirects Golem's repository can serve as a proxy for the main repository and having pip check the main repository in addition to that is redundant. It would only be useful if we wanted to have packages that have some versions available in Golem's repository and others on PyPI.. I don't think you're supposed to put untagged development versions in the requirements.. Wasn't eth_account supposed to be replaced by a property to avoid having this kind of changes?. I think that golem-messages should have a validation against this.. @shadeofblue Just FYI, it would work if it was what git describe returns (which would look like this: 2.13.0-10-gd8cd1d3). It does not work because it's from the version script and does not have  the original <tag>-<n>-<hash> format. I was surprised too when I saw it for the first time but git does allow you to use something like this as a reference to a commit and simply ignores everything but the hash.. Oh, and by the way - if this was just temporary change I think it would have been a good idea to have a comment in the code. Or have it in a separate commit. Otherwise it's not obvious and easy to miss later when you merge (hence my remark that started this thread).. Anything between 200 and 299 is a success. In practice Concent uses:\n- HTTP 200: request accepted, no errors, response sent\n- HTTP 202: request accepted, no errors but the requested operation has not finished yet - the response will be delivered asynchonously (via the receive/ endpoint).\n- HTTP 204: Like HTTP 200 but the request does not require any response\nAs for 4xx and 5xx - it would be best to distinguish them but all in all they're both errors. HTTP 4xx is an error in the request (malformed request, validation error, etc.) which suggests a bug on the client side, 5xx is an error on the Concent side that's out of client's control (timeout, unexpected database error, bug in Concent code, etc.).\nNote that the code refers only to the transport layer (HTTP). When a protocol message is delivered successfully it happens with HTTP 200 even it it's a message like ServiceRefused.. ",

    "dybi": "@jiivan, I have scanned the code and haven't found any call to golem.task.rpc.ClientProvider.create_task with Task as argument (except for a unit test that checks if compatibility fix works). \nI would propose to remove the compatibility fix and the unit test, else you are sure there are some unobvious calls (i.e. via some callbacks, setattrs, etc.).. @shadeofblue - what would be the best way to reproduce? Which test?. @jamuszyn, is there any direction preferred? I.e. You would like to have 0 and 1 or True and False when showing settings, envs, etc.?. I have picked up :\n(0,1) -> (False, True)\noption. should be removed. % -> ETH. @jamuszyn \n@shadeofblue \nshall it disappear only from ./golemcli setting show or from clientconfigdescriptor?. golemcli payments confirmed\ngolemcli payments awaiting\ngolemcli incomes confirmed\ngolemcli incomes awaiting. golemcli deposit_payments confirmed\ngolemcli deposit_payments awaiting. new cmd: golemcli tasks current or golemcli tasks show current. just filter out to show tasks which states are in : \n    sending = \"Sending\"\n    waiting = \"Waiting\"\n    starting = \"Starting\"\n    computing = \"Computing\". There was a bug in golem.core.variables -> 'deposit_contract_address' was not set properly for 'dev' and 'staging'. @etam, quite frankly, I wasn't able to figure out how to do it without touching the internals. The thing is, that options for parent parser (self.shared_parser) are normally added first. Even though, I tried to tinker with internals as carefully as possible ;). @Krigpl, done. @jamuszyn - could you please check what format is displayed in GUI for status, ie.:\n\"notStarted\" or \"Not started\", \"waiting\" or \"Waiting\", etc.\nEDIT:\nchecked offline - everything's crystal clear now.. Updated the description with the latest findings. A proper solution will be proposed. @jiivan done. @jiivan the problem with the proposed approach is that @group and @command decorators are evaluated at import and whether we are running on miannet or not is determined later (after arguments are parsed). @mfranciszkiewicz any reason you have both in the repo? And why not to unify it?. Closing as https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3847 has been merged (and for whatever reason hasn't automatically closed the issue).. Final thing: lint.sh again:\n```\n...\nNew findings:\ngolem/verificator/imgverifier.py:65:81: E501 line too long (93 > 80 characters)\nChanged lines findings:\ngolem/verificator/imgverifier.py:65:81: E501 line too long (93 > 80 characters)\\n\nErrors occurred, summary:\npylint main...       [FAIL]\npylint tests...      [OK]\npycodestyle...       [FAIL]\nmypy...              [OK]\n``. @etam, not really -send_pingshas its converter.BOOL_CONVERTIBLE_KEY_PREFIXESis only for fields that are defined outsideSettingsclass and thus cannot have own converter.. sure. BTW: Do you have defined convention forassertEquals:\n-assertEquals(expected, result)or\n-assertEquals(result, expected)?. ok. I was wondering if it would be ok to do this. Sure :+1: . done. quite frankly, it shouldn't be; if you thoroughly analyzedef get_tasks(self, task_id: Optional[str] = None)fromgolem.client, you will see thatNonecan be returned only whentask_idhasTruevalue in boolean context. But when this is the case, wholeif` from line 82 is skipped. \nSo it seems that or [] from line 89 should be removed.\nIf you insist, I can add handling of None, but so far I feel more inclined towards removing or []. @Wiezzel, what would be your preference here?\nAnyway, thanks for pointing this out :). @Wiezzel @etam removed; also I have added a unit test to make sure we will notice if logic connected with None ever changes. :+1: . done. maybe 'awake' ? ;). what about BadRequest or NotFound responses (4XX in general)? They are now indistinguishable...\nAnd sometimes concent responds with 202 (i.e handle_send_force_report_computed_task case). one more thing - wouldn't be better to uncomment \n```python\ntime.sleep(120)\n``\ninSCIBaseTest.put_deposit()method (scripts/concent_acceptance_tests/base.py`) ?. :laughing: right, will fix. @shadeofblue, you've got a point - the name of the function is too generic. However, I would be for having it separated from the rest of the code for the sake of better modularity and unit-testing.. it is no longer there - as stated above: \n\n@group and @command decorators are evaluated at import and whether we are running on miannet or not is determined later (after arguments are parsed)\n\nso it seems not to work properly: at the time command_enabled is evaluated  IS_MAINET flag is still False - it gets to True later (if -m is provided) when arguments are parsed. please first setup the mock, and then feed it to FundsLocker. please use f-strings and the values above (as variables). please use self.assertEqual. you could also check, that the mock was actually called. I will update it with proper tag as soon as GM counterpart is merge and new tag is available. no idea why this happened... I'll fix it ;). okay, I reduced the boilerplate to the required minimum. two remarks:\n1) please use self.assertEquals()\n2) could you please put use string literal here, so it can be deduced from the test, how the path should look like?\nYou might also put comments at the beginning of the test explaining, i.e.:\n\"\"\"\ncwd: path_to_golem/tasks/whatever\ntask_name: some_task777\n...\n\"\"\"\netc, if you recon it would help understanding what is being concatenated ;). same as above. @etam, in such case, the only reason would be personal preference. So, consider my remark as null and void ;). @rwrzesien, the formula that is used currently assert output_dir == os.path.dirname(\n            frame_task.task_definition.output_file) works only because frame_task.task_definition.task_id is equal to \"\". Please include it calculations if using string literals is not feasible.. OK. please remove as it is a dead code - not used anywhere. please remove as it is a dead code - not used anywhere. this file imagerepr.py should be removed; exactly the same file is placed in apps.rendering.resources and it should be used. please use this file from different location and remove golem.verificator.imgrepr\nsuggestion\nfrom apps.rendering.resources import (ImgRepr, PILImgRepr). why @property annotation has been removed?. I would leave it as is (with \"\"), not to introduce escape character in the string.... just one thing, please add #TODO: fix it, not to forget (I can do it as a part of my current assignment)\nsuggestion\n    def test_task_timeout():  #TODO: fix it`. :). goooooood catch :) :+1: . fixed, but differently than you had. ok, done. Why removing this?. if I get it right, it's more like:\nsuggestion\n            f' Starting docker thread for:  '. In such case, the exception logging in error() is unnecessary as well... please mov it to __init__(). once it is in CoreVerivier.__init__(), it can be deleted from here. it looks like the type was changed here. Can you explain?\n. please adhere to the existing style of asserts:\nsuggestion\n        assert result is False. please adhere to the existing style of asserts:\nsuggestion\n        assert result is False. please adhere to the existing style of asserts:\nsuggestion\n        assert result is False. please change assert style so it is coherent with the rest of the cod ein this module. :+1: . :+1: . please use it with explicit keyword argument (self._check_state(expected_result=False)) - the intent becomes more obvious. again, please use existing assertions style. it seems that after adding self.results and self.subtask_info fields, self.verification_data is not needed anymore.... you don't need this for loop - tou iterate over results within _are_image_sizes_correct(). it seems that self.resources are not used anywhere... neither in this class nor in CoreVerifier. in check_size() only x dimension is checked... what about y?. why is it called (and result is ignored)?. if None is default value, the conditional part seems unnecessary; below as well. \"cropp\" -> \"crop\". this if now seems unnecessary.

    "klopsknoedel": "I've seen this issue at least since 0.15.1. I'm not quite sure if it was a problem with 0.15.0 already.\nThis one is the main-reason of my \"err: x\" - count.. On my side this error does not crash golem. I can pick up tasks after this error shows without restarting golem or changing my resource allocation. It just produces errors and wasting some resources.. That's quite interesting. I had this error several times today but everytime the memory got freed accuratly. I've never had to restart golem or my machine or quit VirtualBox (Headless).\nBTW. I'm also running on a 16GB - Machine.\n\nJust a guess: Before installing Golem via the standard Windows-Installer I manually installed latest \"Docker Toolbox 18.03.0-ce\" which ships with \"VirtualBox 5.2.8 r121009\".\nAs I remember Golem ships \"Docker Toolbox 17.xx.x\" which may rely on a older VirtualBox - Version. You could try to update \"Docker Toolbox\" to the latest version. Maybe there is some weird behaviour on VirtualBox side as a vm runs out of memory and VB laggs to free the allocated memory correctly.\nApart from that, it would be great if golem could depend on \"Docker CE for Windows\" or \"Docker CE for Mac\" in the future so there is no need for VirtualBox (windows) anymore.\n. Hey @SmartLibertyFBO .\nYou may got me wrong. I didn't mean that updating \"Docker Toolbox\" or \"VirtualBox\" will fix that issue. I was guessing that it only will fix your memory-drain AFTER this error occured as you've mentioned in your first post. So that you don't have to kill the VirtualBoxHeadless.exe - process every time this error occures.\nBTW, It may would have been better to update the whole \"Docker Toolbox\" - Suite instead of only updating VirtualBox. But if you don't have any other strange behavious it should be good for now.. @Elfoniok thanks for responding. A legal Windows 10 Pro Licence-Key is not that expensive. I've got mine for ~10\u20ac on amazon (Germany). It would be a great feature to have the decision while installing to whether use \"Docker Toolbox\" or \"Docker CE\". But I definitely understand your point of view and I know there are more important things to care about for now.\nConcerning this issue. I've seen some people over the past few weeks (testers-chat) who also complaint about not freed memory after the error (described in the OP) occured.\nI had this error a lot (over 30 times now) but never faced this memory-leak - issue and I use latest Docker Toolbox as written above. . I've allocated 10GB of RAM to Golem. You can check that on your status-page. Node-Name is also klopsknoedel.\nI want to make clear that I only see this error on /golem/resources/benchmark.blend since 0.15.1 (maybe earlier) and never on any other task. May this could help to narrow the problem.\n. > Are there any memory leaks?\nNo, I've never faced any memory-leaks. Just the benchmark.blend - error a lot of times (just today 7 times).. ",

I updated virtualbox to the last version \"VirtualBox-5.2.12-122591\" and about 10h later I haven't faced the issue with several tasks completed without any errors.\n. It doesn't solve the problem, I had this error once more today. You have a slider that let user change the allocated machine ressource for golem. If the problem happen, every following task that need to be computed raise this error, because memory is not released by VM. I think when we change allocated ressource, it force close VM to change config and then restart it.\nIf I manually close golem VM in virtualbox, the memory is released.. I checked in golem chat with @maaktweluit and gave him my logs.\nyour command doesn't give any informations about the blocked memory, I can only see that golem VM is running and if I connect in ssh I see a lot of free memory available.\nI'll try to add more swap to see if I have the problem again..

These buttons for closing and commenting are definitely too close :P. @shadeofblue After talk with @cameel he decided that the best way would be to put script which is in src_code to docker image or just to golem repository instead of keeping it in ComputeTaskDef. There is not any benefit for keeping it in ComputeTaskDef. It might be another change in Golem Messages.\nI think that we should split all changes into few smaller and changing it step by step to be sure that everything works correctly after every update. . https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/3066#issuecomment-414643255 updated with new version of ComputeTaskDef. >2. Field script_hash should be sha1 script hash\n@kbeker You left this in the decription but script_hash is no longer in the example.\nActually this field exist. Other fields were wrong and now are fixed. \n\n\nThere should be more information about the schema. What types are expected for the fields? Which values are valid?\n\n\nAll fields which I have mentioned in example I wrote with types as they should be in real. I can also update them with type annotations if you want. \n\nE.g. what are the allowed values in output_format? Do they have to be uppercase? Is it JPG, JPEG or both for .jpeg files?\n\nI think that it should be also an Enum with possible values. In all places where I saw output_format is uppercased.\n\n\nThere's something wrong with nesting in your examples. Why is } at the same level as the last ]?\n\n\nOh, I haven't notice it. Already fixed\n. @badb \n\nCould you also show how DummyTask json would look like after your changes?\n\nI can't find place where in DummyTask script_src is used. I found that there is only place for src_code. . To summarize:\n\nIs script_hash in your proposal supposed to be generated from the script or from the template?\n\nscript_hash should be a hash generated from script template to be sure that user used same template as we using for creating scripts. Also then it might have different name e.g. script_template_hash?\n\nI think that scene_file_src should moved to the package with task source files (textures, blender/luxrender project, etc.).\n\n@cameel I fully agree, but maybe it should also be another issue? We should have small issues to review them quicker \n\nThere should be more information about the schema. What types are expected for the fields? Which values are valid?\n\nexample updated. \n\nMaybe it would be a good idea to split script_src into two modules? One would be the static, located in the image or in Golem source, and would import a smaller script that only sets variable values. Or returns a dict that the static script uses to set variable values. Only the smaller script would be a template. Or it could be just a JSON dump of a dictionary.\nThis way we would not really need to use hashes as versions. We could have a version as a simple integer. Combined with task type it would identify the script to use.\n\nI think that it might be bigger change to split it. It might be another issue, but we can't change everything \n at once :)\n@shadeofblue : \n\nWhy is docker_images a list? Can there be more than one image?\n\n. @ederenn \n\n@kbeker it's impossible to upload a task from GUI.

    "pawelkisielewicz": "I reproduced this with last release versions\n- Golem 0.18.2\n- Golem Electron 0.18.0\nEverything is OK, problems does not exist any more. I have investigated this task and the reason of problem is creating task asynchronicity. In function create_task (rpc.py) there is some validations and there is really None and error message returned in case of failed validation. \nBut in next step task is created asynchronicity, so if we want to return consistent output we have to wait until task is created, check if there were errors and then return valid task id. This way all errors from function enqueue_new_task will be handled, but it will make the whole flow longer. \nMy idea is to wait for results of enqueue_new_task and I will start implementation this way. If there is not acceptable for you please let me know. . I spoke with @jiivan on rocket and general suggestion is to move checking of available GNT and ETH before call  asynchronic function - as \"expected\" fails. I try to extract as much as I can of fast validations to cover as much cases as possible. I'm not sure if it will be 100% perfect, but it seems to be the best approach.  . Problem I discovered:\ngolem console:\nWaiting for ForcePayment...\nWaiting for ForcePaymentCommitted.\nWARNING  [golem.network.concent.client       ] Concent request failed with status 400 and response: '{\"error\": \"Golem Message contains wrong fields.

It was tested previous with times from yesterday, but in Golem-Messages 2.23 it was decided to add this validator. I think that to resolve this case test should be updated to new code: we should't test messages from the past and send regular message (with current time).. Probably resolved in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3819. There is added validation checking if port > 0 (and some other checks for port and address). This sessions are rejected, so they will not fail in golem-messages validation any more.. this was reverted without pull request. I spoke with @cameel and all responses between 200 and 299 are OK. Please change this line to\n if not 200 <= response.status_code <= 299:\nThis will resolve problem with https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/issues/3210. done. done. changed. I did it like this at first, but in all other tests there is assert result == so I decided to unify. But changed :). done. right, done. done. done, moved to rpc.py as inner function. reverted and added assert for function validating possibility of locking founds. yes... right. I left this check before calling enqueue_new_task as well, there is very high possibility that in this case it will be caught before. But it is called also in enqueue_new_task to prevent race condition. :+1: added to other places. It is used to check possibility to lock founds. In \"first\" version I moved this validation out of concent_deposit, it was the reason. Now it is back and this parameter has to stay . moved to test_rpc.py. after moving to test_rpc.py there is no need to patch any more. Thanks for comment anyway. :+1: thanks. Removed. done. done. It should. Changed. Check added to _validate_enough_founds_to_pay_for_task. This function is called in 3 places:\n- _validate_enough_founds_to_pay_for_task - check added\n- _ensure_task_deposit - there was check before\n- ask_for_verificationin _react_to_subtask_results_rejected- there is check before call as well.. OK, thanks, didn't know about this. task.subtask_price. But task.get_total_tasks() has to stay to check ETH. While restarting subtask we should ensure eth for batch transfer for only one task. Is it correct? . done. checking if client has enough ETH for deposit is and was related. Now it is additionally checked gas for transfer, so by restarting I assume that there is one task. . done. done. done, converted from function to method. done. done. good catch, done. done. done. I thought about it, but didn't want to create a new variable. Changed :+1: . OK, removed. But please check the rest of flow in this function. address is used only in self.__add_subtask_to_tasks_states and only in logger:\npython\nlogger.debug('add_subtask_to_tasks_states(%r, %r, %r, %r)',\n                     node_name, node_id, ctd, address)\nDo we want to keep this and always log empty string? In this case I think that address should be simply removed. . OK, I have only question about it. subtasks_to_copy is empty unless I pass subtask_id as subtask_ids_to_copy. And in this case subtask state if Failure. Please give me some more info how to do this. And how should it be called in test:\npython\nself.tm.copy_results('old_task_id', 'new_task_id', ['some_subtask_id1 ?? '])\nor \npython\nself.tm.copy_results('old_task_id', 'new_task_id', [])\nas previous?. I just fixed readme, please check it now. There is also decorator setting default behavior, if there is no flag, tests run with default, decorator setting. I set it to True, so by default it will be True. ok, done. :+1: . done, but I'd prefer to leave two reusable 'keystore.json' in folders as it is now and replace this folders each time. Less mess, it will be always replaced  . renamed. It is to disable reusing node keys. With this argument all tests will start with new node keys. . It was modifying only test_kwargs, mkaybe the name of function was misleading. But now it is removed anyway. sorry, I made changes with list and wrote here, but didn't push because of tests. Sorry one more time, it is pushed now. done. done. ok, sorry for this. right, done. done, moved to node_integration_tests/tests/base.py. sorry, fixed. fixed. You don't have to inherit from  LogTestCase here. This is wrong, try to change expected status to e.g. WRONG_ANSWER and run test again. It will pass. I worked with this test as well, please check in https://github.com/golemfactory/golem/pull/3967/commits/ac0dafed697fec882658cd82fc26e598fb5ded31. It works, in first version in case of fail there was timeout, after my work assert fails. I don't think LogTestCase is used here. :). This is not your test, but there is the same situation. You can change e.g.:\nassert kwargs['result']['time_ended'] == 'really_anything' and test is still green. If you can please fix it, if not it should be done in separate issue. Because in next step there is callback or errback called. And result is logged there. Leaving this message here would make logs duplicated. . Not necessary... failure (with log Verification verdict: negative.) is called in two cases: \n1. in callback, when result is negative. This is normal behavior, verification finished without errors, but verdict is negative.\n2. When some unexpected error  during verification occurred. In this case I think it should be logged, that verification raised exception. This is not expected behavior.   . done. done. After all fixes this argument is not passed to tests, so this code is not here any more. no, the type is the same. It was string and is string now. ",

Adding verbosity to CLI is a subject for another PR.. I misunderstood you. It's changed now. . This pull requests is actually a question about what is our approach to such changes in the code? This method name is clearly confusing, but some other code might already depend on it. . I should fix a commit message to \"Remove NAT type retrieval\"\n. 1. Fine, starting from next commit \n2. Honestly I would inline get_nat_type code in get_ip_info. That will also require tests refactoring. (. A more meaningful commit message would be useful. Unfortunately active environment in golemcli depends on when the modules are loaded. In this case it's the backtrace:\n\n-> from golem.interface.client.account import Account  # noqa\n-> from golem.node import ShutdownResponse\n-> from apps.appsmanager import AppsManager\n-> from golem.config.active import APP_MANAGER_CONFIG_FILES\n-> if os.environ.get(GOLEM_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE) == MAINNET:\nthat is setting the active env long before the parsed arguments are checked so set_environment solution analogical to golemapp won't work. I marked simpleenv.py with FIXME. The last change looks acceptable to me and the tests pass. I could put that config reload into set_environment function to hide this problem from developers in the future. . The real problem was set_environment function and the way it depended on module loading. Now if someone wants to use it the config will be reloaded - as expected. .

I resolved the conflicts that appeared because it was hanging for over a week.. @jiivan I fixed the line endings problem. Weird.. Can we give it a go? It's easy for this refactor to become a conflict (many files affected). . I only plan to do this regarding Electron client (@mdtanrikulu). Is there anything else I should take into consideration? . Closing due to too many conflicts. I assume this is a provider scenario. Are you able to compute the task at some point in time? \n. Thanks for the comments. I will open another bulk PR for problems like this.. It happened again. Github web gui changes line endings.... Regarding question about CLI: create, show, restart all work. . @jiivan Maybe we could move this dict patching into a separate function? . Migration can be removed now.. IIRC this is an expected behavior. Is it causing any problems?. Why files like:\napps/core/task/coretask.py\napps/dummy/task/dummytask.py\ngolem/task/localcomputer.py\ngolem/task/taskcomputer.py\nNeed to know anything about blender specifically?. To me those classes seem pretty abstract, yet here they are using concrete implementations. For each of the files I mentioned I believe blender specific stuff should be removed. Especially DummyTask which is about POW now knows blender stuff. Do you see my point? . OK now I have read the related issue. What about putting meta_parameters inside 'extra_data' and rendering a template on provider side?. @jiivan I added the tests but there is a problem with them. They depend on stuff they are not testing like internal implementation of e.g. create_task. IMHO exception handling should not be done using decorators but there should be one big exception handler on a higher level. . Is region always a  rectangle? Maybe a more descriptive name for it would be a Rectangle . Hello,\ncore dumps are created according to /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern. Please investigate the content of this file to determine core dump location. \nMy wild guess is that it's related to 18.10 version. . LGTM. Looks good to me. What about you @shadeofblue?. @mdtanrikulu How long is this wait time?. Why do you think it is safe to run TaskArchiver service in a separate thread? By looking at do_maintenance method it is no so clear to me. \n. Same question for ResourceCleanerService. It is using the same dir_manager that is used by the golem apps arbitrarily. . Did you have a chance to run it and check performance behavior? . Are we going to merge that or not? . Awesome. . Yes it is used by DirManager IIRC. What was it for anyway?. It happens when there are three nodes in play. Two of them are on the same host and the last one is remote.\nFirst is started with:\npython golemapp.py --password=abcd --datadir=/home/mplebanski/Projects/golem/node_A --rpc-address=localhost:61000 --accept-terms\nSecond:\npython golemapp.py --password=abcd --datadir=/home/mplebanski/Projects/golem/node_B --rpc-address=localhost:61001 --accept-terms --peer=localhost:40102\nand third (remote):\npython golemapp.py --password=abcd --datadir=/home/mplebanski/Projects/golem/node_A --rpc-address=localhost:61000 --accept-terms\nProblem dissapears when second node is started with:\npython golemapp.py --password=abcd --datadir=/home/mplebanski/Projects/golem/node_B --rpc-address=localhost:61001 --accept-terms --peer=--peer=5.226.70.49:40102\nmeaning that probably localhost in command line argument --peer is improperly handled.\nEDIT: After further investigation it turns out that both 127.0.0.1 and localhost are causing the problem. I thought it's only localhost. Only pointing to the local peer with it's external IP address makes the problem disappear. . It looks to me like a blender specific patch in generic code. As discussed offline, OK to merge for me. . . No, not really. I will checkout develop for this file.. Thanks for comments. \nAd 1 \nAs suggested I refactored names ob to archive and rel to subdirectory. Is the rel paramter clear now? \nAd 2\nFixed that with rstrip('/'). I am not sure if I should put this inside zip_append function or leave it where it is now. \nAd 3 \nAdded \nAd 4 \nTrue, I added RuntimeException with appropriate explanation. This happened because I used github web gui to merge the golem/client.py into feature branch. Not really. If you take a look at:\ndef __getstate__(self):\n        return self.PICKLED_VERSION_2, self.__dict__ \nonly, then 2 in place of the identifier is just a magic number. My bad. I don't understand. It clearly states that this is a version information. What changed that previously it was fine and now we need to modify 'extra_data' ? . No, sorry for that one. . From looking at golem_async.py I can't deduce when happens the race condition that is being synchronized here. asyncio_start first calls _ASYNCIO_RUN.set() then schedules asyncio_main. What is synchronized here? . Why log_sometimes name?. Yes because log interval is already explicitly stated in the decorator. Maybe log_routine is a better fit? . OK. If an exception is thrown inside the task being processed, is this thread completing it's execution?. Are we droping this backwards compatibility? . scripts/node_integration_tests/tasks/__init__.py is still using subtasks. Isn't using a @property here a bit of overkill? None of the class members are dynamically computed inside getter methods -> They could be simple fields . This could be removed, because cpp-poc is now merged into master branch..

Ok, but it will be done inside docker - it causes problem with serialization while sending via the internet.. @mfranciszkiewicz I've added these lines because of failing tests on Linux during removal of files created by docker(it works on other platforms). Please discuss with @nieznanysprawiciel whether keep these lines or remove them and fix failing tests. . This image is not in use currently. Ok. Because of failing tests - you've added FFmpeg docker image. Ok. It causes deadlock (test_query_extra_data), fix it by yourself @rkondziolka . It is suggested by PyCharm. Have you thought about benefits from rewriting it to private method? IMO Python is not strictly object-oriented language.. /golem/output is a directory inside docker container, docker does not know anything about the realpath. We should have all video chunks in a single directory that is mounted as /golem/resources/. If you are sure that they are collected in the same place, I'll change it.. Here I prepare list of video chunks for docker container - to make them visible the real directory should be replaced by /golem/resources/  . DirManger does not know anything about /golem/resources/ (it is the path inside docker container with video chunks).. It is raised by collect_files method.. I will define constant docker's paths (output, resources and work).. I can change it, but OSError can be raised by os.makedis, no other exception is expected here.. I haven't seen this :+1: . We mount one directory as /golem/resources/, so I will check if each file has proper path (and raise ffmpegException). To enable specifying custom directories, see merge_video. Btw this is executed inside docker . ",
    "zakaprov": "The problem here is caused by the field subtasks being parsed as a string instead of an int in golem core. This fails in: Client#get_subtasks_count for parameter total_subtasks.\nI did not manage to reproduce this issue directly, only caused the same problem by hardcoding subtasks to be a string (or when trying to upload the task def file from CLI).\nWill look further into this.. The task def JSON sent over by the electron app is already fixed (tested on latest versions of electron/core pair). I think it makes sense to add JSON schema validation and/or testing. I created a separate issue for it (#3600).. Resolved by: #3715 . @shadeofblue All three shields are working fine now. Since shield generation endpoints were (temporarily?) removed from Buildbot (see: 0.9.0 release notes) I used a third-party service for this. Any issues here are probably related to that service's availability.. Okay, will take a look.. Good idea, this can actually be replaced with this library, which already includes a context manager for file locking. The original implementation of file locking is based on that library.. @mdtanrikulu I created a separate endpoint since the data returned by comp.tasks.estimated.cost is specific to tasks, while the added pay.gas_price is general and could be used independently.. This was already resolved on b0.19 (#3716), so it only requires a port to develop.. FYI:\n$ grep -nr \"geth_address\" .\n./node.py:85:                 geth_address: Optional[str] = None,\n./node.py:138:            geth_address=geth_address,\n./client.py:104:            geth_address: Optional[str] = None,. @Wiezzel Thanks, didn't notice that. I saw another solution using Get-WindowsOptionalFeature, but that one requires running as admin. Let me update and test this.. Preliminary observations from debug logs: task c6dab040-22f5-11e9-8df7-0e9c5f4ab51d gets restored from a pickle which is removed immediately after restoring. This is due to the task being recognised as too old (default: 3 days + task timeout).. The root issue here is a race condition - it's possible for a client (e.g. Electron app) to get a list of tasks (comp.tasks) before the outdated ones have been removed (via clean_old_tasks). This leads to a situation where the client displays tasks which are no longer available in core.\nThe initial approach here (#3855) was flawed and therefore was reverted. Properly deleting a task currently requires it to be registered in the task manager, which in turn requires it to be restored from a pickle.\nFixing this properly requires properly deleting outdated tasks before they are made available to clients. Since this is a larger change, it falls out of scope for this release. The issue for this is #3862. To remedy this in 0.19, task cleaning will be disabled.. As discussed with @mfranciszkiewicz - without solving the actual underlying cause (#3660) a temporary fix would be to synchronise session via locking. Considering the cost of that vs the low frequency of this issue I'd say it's not worth patching in 0.19. @etam What do you think?. @shadeofblue There are still some changes left to be done in order for this to work (see the most recent comments from the discussions here).. This turned out not to be an AMD-specific problem - virtualisation checks were failing due to a race condition between Golem core and Electron client (see #3966).. @shadeofblue: what's your take on this?. Resolves: #3935 #3928\nThe above two are filed as AMD specific, but were actually caused by this race condition (Golem core exiting before Electron client asked about virtualisation support).. You're right, it's no longer needed here, let me remove it. Okay, interesting - didn't realise there's a difference!. Reminder: make sure to update this once changes to messages are merged. nit: might be safer to use an absolute import (same for other occurences below). ok, fair enough. That's because the environment needs to be cross-checked here - when we're running on mainnet, we want to inspect the datadir for testnet (and vice versa).. you know, just stuff. Good idea, will do. Alright, I guess it makes sense since @lock_datadir depends on environment being set anyway.. I think the terms themselves should be a part of this PR. Reminder: update version here once terms are added. Is this override necessary?. +1, or perhaps create a separate flag to accept all terms (for potential additions in the future)?. Clarified: these can be added later on. I think this section could also mention how a single test can be started using pytest (since that's not obvious), e.g.:\npytest scripts/node_integration_tests/tests/test_golem.py::GolemNodeTest::test_regular_task_run. :+1: Thanks. This is already imported at the top level, no need to re-import locally.. This needs to be called from start before getting the full datadir path.. I think it would be more readable to use if task_id in container for dicts (since that's O(1)) and handle supported_tasks array separately, something like this:\n```\nfor container in (\n    self.task_headers,\n    self.support_status,\n    self.last_checking\n):\n    if task_id in container:\n        del container[task_id]\ntry:\n    self.support_status.remove(task_id)\nexcept ValueError:\n    pass\n```\nWhat do you think?. LBYL \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Good catch, sorry. and not sending out the payments. Requestor Node not sending out the payments. Perhaps add the return type here. Just a note: graceful shutdown could be changed to use the dedicated RPC call (golem.graceful_shutdown).. and -> an. nit: search terms can placed in a group to avoid repeating .*, like so: '.*(' + '|'.join(concent_fail_triggers + (awaited_messages or [])) + ').*'\n'.*Concent service exception.*|.*Concent request failed.*|.*Problem interpreting.*'\nvs\n'.*(Concent service exception|Concent request failed|Problem interpreting).*'. See above (concent_base.py). Now that I see this repeated in a couple of places I think the logic for searching logs for failures should be moved to a separate method in ConcentTestPlaybook.. See above. nit: typing annotations on parameters. :(. Good one, I'll add a separate task for that. I discussed it with @tworec - merging this PR won't break monitor backend (new fields will be ignored).. I see, so this is entirely separate from the changes I made here. Thanks for taking a look!. I've slimmed it down by removing these one-liner methods, see the updated version. Updated, when using assert_called_once_with the assertion failed on messages in both tests. However, when comparing with the message stored in call_args_list this works as expected.. Ugh, I missed the sender field there. Or better show the difference like unittests assertEqual. I tested it on Windows 10 with Polish locale. The output was in English, but encoded using CP1250 (i.e. appropriate for the system's language in Windows terms). As far as I can tell, the output does not get localized. Then again, it's not like I can take a look at the source code of that command.\nOne safeguard I can think of is to ensure the script is called via PowerShell and not the standard Windows command line. PowerShell uses UTF encoding by default (yay).. I already updated this, putting return_value in the decorator makes these tests more concise.. That's not really an issue here, since the output of the command doesn't get localized. I was thinking more of the encoding used in the shell itself.. Got it, turns out it won't be required most likely (see comment below).. I don't think this should be renamed, afaik the name of this field is supposed to be subtasks_count.. Are there any cases where this could fail right after enabling was successful?. current_concent_deposit is not used anywhere else but here, just do: required_deposit_difference = required - self.concent_balance().. founds -> funds. Passing the transaction system here is redundant, you can just refer to self.client.transaction_system directly.. This should be moved to after the check for available GNT (next to where eth_available is initialised).. Please merge this into a single line. There is no such kwarg in validate_concent_deposit_possibility, either change this to required or rename the expected argument.. See previous comment on this, this method expects a different argument name.. Same as above, this method expects a different argument name.. Sounds correct, but is this part related to restarting subtasks?. This is not the expected behaviour - the address here should not be the requestor's own address. Now that I think if it, this field should probably stay empty - the state will be updated anyway once the subtask is assigned to a provider and there's no added value in knowing the address of the provider who previously failed on the subtask.. There's a mapping between new and old subtasks available, you should use it here. please see subtasks_to_copy above.. Ok, I think that in this case it's fine to remove the address parameter.. You can create a mapping analogous to subtasks_to_copy based on the start_task field, but for all other subtasks of the original task. Then, for each of the new subtasks created (after the call to query_extra_data, which assigns the value of start_task) you can try accessing the old subtask state. If that fails for some reason, just put in empty strings as defaults.. Got it, in that case I'm going to drop the next try-except and keep the @run_safe decorator for catching any unexpected errors.. Makes sense, I'm going to remove the try-except here.. Makes sense, but as discussed - let's make this as a separate change.. The logic for temporarily blocking providers should be made optional by default. This means the disallow timeouts here should be set to some special value (e.g. 0) and treated appropriately.. Same as above, the default timeouts here should be set to a special value (disabled by default).. Since this is not implemented, I think the max_times parameter here should be removed. Also, I don't really see a good use case for having this feature on allow ACL anyway.. Should this one be exposed?. This should stay in short form.. Please make these temporary disallows optional (add conditions to check against the config's disabled value).. Right, missed that one.. Actually, the names of these ALLOW options are counter-intuitive, maybe let's change the prefix to DISALLOW? I think that would better describe their function, since they control the number of times disallow needs to be called for a given provider to result in a ban.. I agree, hence the comment I left there. Another option would be to change this RPC / create a new one specific to the use case (i.e. checking for Docker support).. Besides the file name, I think the test name should also reflect the logic being tested.. In the end I'm not making use of the shutdown flag. The error handler prevents client from being initialised which results in the relevant RPCs (creating/restarting tasks, running benchmarks, updating configs) not being registered. Golem remains in a state analogous to when terms of use are not yet accepted.. The EnvironmentError doesn't include a message itself, but there's an error message logged before raising it (e.g. here). I'll update the message logged here in the error handler.. Ah snap, this is a leftover nit from when I was trying out the shutdown flag approach. In the current approach this error won't be raised. Instead, a generic \"RPC not registered\" error will be raised when trying to create a task.. This method name sounds like a handler, perhaps add a type hint here?. Same as above.. ",
