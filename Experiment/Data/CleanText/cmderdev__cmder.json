    "samvasko": "Fixed in latest master. Sorry for delay. \n. oh, great did not notice that at all :+1: \n. in /vendor dir there is script init.bat that takes care of setting up the enviroment for cmd. You should be able to change there. But it seems like a sensible thing to move it to Conemu config if possible so I will look into that. \n. I am afraid this is not related to cmder in any way, but anyhow\nif you want to change to folder on another drive you should use cd /d or if you just want to change the drive use D: (just type that in, It is kinda weird)\n. Sorry but I can't seem to reproduce that: cd /d F: (note the colon) works for me.\n. thanks for both :+1: \n. I have tried to use links but I found it not working on removable media. My idea is that it has to do with absolute paths.\nOk I just googled a bit and I found this program. I will try your link and this program.\nThanks for a great suggestion!\n. wow, that is damn smart! I did not know that you can do it that way. Thanks\n. do you have any idea how to set the icon? I have serious trouble using %CD% in icon path, where %USERPROFILE% works just fine\n. I will get onto that. What kind of keyboard layout are you using?\nBy the way what would you suggest. Are you using any other emulator with different key binding?\n. It fetches the latest featured archives form google code. So not the alpha builds.\n. Hello,\ntry replace your vendor/init.bat with this one\nDoes that fix the problem?\n. Did not tried running it on windows XP. :hurtrealbad: I will do that and let you know\n. That would be quite awesome! But I think it is something in domain of clink (component of Cmder). You should post this suggestion there. \n. Great, I have looked into the source code and I think I am capable of coding something. I think it is something worth looking into for next release\n. Hi! I just found out.\nBased on the docs it looks like that the functionality is already there.\n. I got it working locally right now. So it should be part of next release. That will happen as soon as I figure out the launcher. \n. I am also working on clean/dirty indicator. Do you have any other suggestions? \n. Status so far, What do you think? \n. Good one, Thanks!\n. I have a feeling that has to do with different versions. I will post 1.1 build here so you can test it before I release it. \n. Thanks! \n. no more chcp, this should be fine in v1.1.2\n. Next time I will be in Barcelona. :beers:.\n. Man, those typos :goberserk: \n. Vim is working in latest master now...\nVi is just alias for vim in msysgit/bin/vi\nPwd is only a reference file msysgit/bin/pwd and you can fix that just by doing alias pwd=cd\nSo I think I am closing this one. Thanks for helping\n. I think I will for better methods of launching for future. But I will keep this open for now.\nThanks for helping.\n. Wow, that is a good one! Thanks\n. I will just write: \"Always quote the values\" like 100 times so I do not forget it next time. :D\n. That does not seem to be doing the trick for me. Did it work for you? \n. That is a very good idea but...\nFile C:\\Users\\Samuel\\Desktop\\Cmder\\repo\\vendor\\init.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled\non this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at\nhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.\n    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess\nWhat do you suggest?\n. Thanks for a great explanation... Can you possibly use -ExecutionPolicy flag to just shim that for the init script and then return it back to normal on the end? \n. @austinwagner I am powerless as you are. You need a certificate that I am not planning to buy :(.\nOr is that some other case in this situation? \n(btw I just finished my traveling so brace yourself for round of updates)\n. I m merging this one into #136\nLets solve this powershell conundrum :muscle: \n. Thanks!\n. yay, fixed!\n. I am planning to move all the prompt handling to clink. So I started with moving the lambda! \nPlease try the latest release. \n. whops, I balled up the merging :confused: \nbut It works! Thanks \n. Oh, so can we combine the behavior? \n. Good Idea! All aliases (or rather doskeys) are already parsed by clink. This could be possibly done by modifying its source or the lua extensions.\n. You can slap the config file into /vedor/ConEmu/Conemu/ConEmu.xml and it will loaded by default.\nBut that kinda breaks all the separation, that I was aiming for, e.g no cofiguration in vendor folder\n. I found out it happens to me also. My tip is history fetching. Can you give me steps that will reproduce the issue 100%?\n. This should be fixed in latest master. Thanks for reporting :hand: \n. I think something like that can be done by extending clink. I am sure there is a way to hook into that.\nRelevant issue from clink (marked as wontfix)\nRelavant docs\n. @Jackbennett Yes, it will. but powershell is horribly slow for me for no fucking reason.\n(and also that is not really valid answer to problem like that, you could you say \"just use linux\" )\n. but what about  cd ~\\Documents\n. not sure if Cmder \u2282 Chocolatey or the other way around. I am putting it in my list\n. You are indeed correct. I guess something installed that for me on the virtual machine.\n. Hi can you try v1.1.2 ? All the .dll should be packaged there.\nThanks.\n. Not the MSVCR100.dll that is a dependency of clink. But for launcher.\n. I am closing this as wontfix the solution is:\n\nClink depends on MSVCR100.dll that is present on majority of systems as part of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package . If you do not have permissions to install this. Just download the dll and paste it to vendor/clink/ in your distribution. \n. This looks like duplicate of #45 Does that works for you? \n. This looks like a duplicate of #40 \nThanks for reporting :+1: \n. Great, I was looking into that! That almost closes the #23 \n. Interesting @Vivix, I summon you! :zap:\nI will test that right now\n. This does not seem to be an issue for me. Can you replicate that?\n\n. My fault, sorry. I am working on 1.1 that will contain the fix. I should have asked about the version.\n. Should be fixed in latest release\n. :rage2: Oh man, why the hell...\n. relevant issue msysgit/msysgit#58\n. This looks like more complex than just removing\n. I can port it if it is a trouble. The language bar is diverse already. :D\n. The script is not working very well. Not at all I should say.\n. Well I wanted to work on it myself and I just about finished it. Check the git-cleanup branch. I had to dig bit into git source and use checksums to find the duplicates.\n. I think no. Some of the perl/sh scripts still use the dashed version.\n. Should be fixed in latest release\n. The million dollar question is: But will it break something else?\n. Should be fixed in latest release\n. Can you try it latest version. It works for me there.\n. That is odd, in a new version I still using clink 0.3.1 due to similiar issues. Are you sure?\n. Thank you sir.\n. As @austinwagner said. PATH is not recursive. I am thinking about adding crawler that would check for executables in folders in /bin. I think it has to be limited to 1 level due to speed. So /bin/Ruby/ruby.exe should be loaded automatically but not /bin/Ruby/bin/ruby.exe\n. Thanks for submitting :) It will take maybe some time before I can accept this request. My windows bootloader just broke. \n. Duh! Where does the $PSScriptRoot\\autorun\\ come from?\n. BTW,  I still get, damn\n\nSecurity Warning\nRun only scripts that you trust. While scripts from the Internet can be useful, this script can potentially\nharm your computer. Do you want to run Z:\\cmder\\scripts\\powershell\\DefaultProfile.ps1?\n[D] Do not run  [R] Run once  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is \"D\"): R\n. I am currently working on merging all the PS stuff at powershell-tweaks\n. I got it working by using $Env:CMDER_ROOT but the policy seems to be still broken for me. And no always option :(\nMaybe you could test it out in VM or some other machine?\n. @pcrockett Is there a possibility to check for existence of user's profile and make them choose?\n. @kjerk  Even if the ExecutionPolicy flag was effective. Wouldn't that be kinda dangerous? \n. Oh damn, thanks, I guess there is a need to distribute that also. \n. I managed to get a quick intro windows .dll files: does this work for you? Please say yes :-D\n. can you type path and paste the output here? Thanks\n. @galli-a That is rather strange, can you give me your computer specs and md5 (or sha) of the .exe? Thanks\n. mine is md5: 8d073afa242dfa7d018a16a3a010a00a from the last release\n. I think WIndows XP is the critical part. I will take a look.\n. @ezuk I was waiting for confirmation about new launcher and dependencies. All seems to be clear right now. So in a few days...\n. Thanks! \n. Mysterious config file is mysterious. \n. Hi it looks like from when you forked the repo I did similar changes on the master, pull that and see what else you find.\nThanks\n. I suggest defining alias as ls=dir /w As @Vivix pointed out. No UTF yet.\n. This functionality is already implemented in ConEmu. Everything should work out of box\n. Sorry but this is wontfix. You will have to live with that. If you for some reason want to use cmd with ansicon I recommend using some parameters on shortcut to load ansicon.\n. Great, you do not have to use @echo off all the time. Just prefix the command with @\n. After that I will test it, merge it and make issue for porting this to ruby.\nMany thanks\n. Some issues are still not ironed out. I can put out pre-release and see.\n. Its alive! :grimacing: \n. .history file in config folder, whops\n. Good one, thanks :) \n. Can you tell me the version you are running? (Should be in the /)\n. I think this is because git repo discovery. It is quite a slowdown without a proper process fork.\nYou can modify the /config/git.lua/ and comment out the last line to disable git.\n. Well, it was labeled as pre-release for the reason of polishing out the dependencies. So I think I will keep the 2013 dependency and redistribute the dlls.\n. is this still an issue with v1.1.2 ?\n. Thanks! I did not really made the launcher. I think @austinwagner was the one. And I am not really familiar with C++ and Windows Api that much.\nSo if you could possibly do the mentioned changes without having to remove that function. You can just submit a pull and I am happy to accept it! :+1: \n. I can't replicate that. please test it again in VM/Other machine if you can\n. I just found out: \nThis is related to this prompt setting line\nI have tried multiple things but no luck so far. If you want to set the set the color your best bet would be to modify the init.bat and/or set the PROMPT enviroment variable in computer settings.\n. In the latest version there is no need to run .bat on Vista+\n. Sorry but FAR manager compatibility is not central to cmder. But if you have fix, I am happy to accept it.\n. You can fire up the powershell directly by using ctr-shift-2 or ctrl-t. \n. This is related to clink I assume. Try changing this line\nCmd has that odd behavior of asking that question independently of the process.\n. The only thing stopping the powershell is the script policy issue. If we can somehow get the cash/cert/avoid the policy settings, I think powershell has a nice future :-)\n. looks like you won the price  @MartiUK :fireworks: \nGo nuts!\n. 1. What would you suggest to add? We currently have windows native aliases.\n2. Can you provide relevant docs from msysgit?\nThanks\n. I think there is nothing like that for cmd.exe + msysgit.\nBut\nI think it would be nice to also add git bash to cmder. So I will add that to the todo!\n. This looks like a clink not loading config files from the config folder.\nDid you just downloaded the cmder.zip and extracted it?\n. Hey, try add @ before like chcp 65001. It will disable the echo\n. Whops That should beCtrl-Alt-U` now. The clink has been updated. I will try to fix it, one way or another. \n. I like it :) \n. When injecting clink it checks if there is already something. If it is it will not inject our clink with the settings to turn the keys into values.\nOne way would be to check if clink is present and unload it or load it with out settings.\nCurrent fix is: remove clink from global autorun for cmd.exe by doing clink autorun --uninstall or something like that.\nAlso I will check if there is way to display some informative error.\n. in /config/aliases there is a alias that will run the colored version for you every time.\nSo you have 3 possibilities:\n1. Remove the alias\n2. Run ls --color=never > file_list.txt that will overwrite the thing\n3. Do the good ol' dir /b > file_list.txt\n. I am not absolutely sure, but there is no reason to use Cmder instead of cmd here. Apart from aliases there is nothing you can gain. Cmder is just a user friendly layer above the cmd.exe \n. Oh, I am afraid you are at wrong address.  All the git completion is done by clink.\nYou can see the relevant FAQ\nI am sure somebody can figure that out! I would also like to see that.\n. Relevant source would like to contribute! :muscle: \n. I am not sure if you used setx or set so I will check both:\nWith set after I restart the cmder. I don't get 1234 echoed. I am pretty sure variables set by set name=value are tied to lifetime of cmd session.\nIf you are using setx than the environmental vars first need to be reloaded on the second console to work. If you want this kind of functionality you should try some for this.\n. But has been a default since forever. Env variables get loaded on start of cmd.exe\n. Done, thanks I was not aware the link is missing\n. I am in afraid currently this has lower priority than #136 . We need to convince windows to be as cooperative with the scripts as we can.\n. First of all. I think this a amazing and clever idea. But his is section confused me\nRestricted\n     - Default execution policy in Windows 8, \n       Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8.1.\nDoes this mean that even signed PS scripts will be refused on win8?\nI will follow up on more stuff tomorrow. \n. I just renamed the issue\n. I guess git got confused by different versions. I suggest using mini version if you have git already. \n. As @hopbit pointed out set is only for local variables. So this behavior is correct.\n. Cmder does not have cygwin. But it uses slightly different thing: msysgit it contains majority of linux tools.  You can get the latest archive and replace the vendor/msysgit with the zipped version.\n. Amazing I think you can just do this.\n``` bash\nFork the repo\ngit clone  \ngit remote add upstream \nYou might have to do: git pull origin scripts\ngit checkout scripts # the working branch for the powershell scripts\ndo stuff in scripts folder\ngit commit\ngit push origin scripts # you might need -u here to set the tracking\nSubmit a pull request to cmder/scripts\n```\nThen we can accept your changes and they will be listed under this pull request. Feel free to poke around in whatever you find interesting. I am not planning to do any work today nor tomorrow :bike: so no necessary collisions  should happen.\n. Also when some changes happen on this branch I think you can do git pull upstream scripts to avoid having to fork the branch before each pull request.\nNot sure if that makes any sense :confused: \n. @Jackbennett And your commits are here! git-magic :zap: \n. I suppose you can do what I did in the ruby version. Just check the if extracted dir contains exactly one folder. If it does, just flatten it somehow, by using temp folder name like I did or just copy the contents.\n. Jack, can you please check the modified build and tell me what you think?\n. @Jackbennett Do you have any experience with doing multiple threads in PS? Do you think that would be feasible do to extraction and downloading on different threads? \n. I was considering to remove the batch file for the next release. It was in current one only because of XP. Do you have any particular reason to use it? \n. Sure. You are using jpg. That does not support transparency (sometimes called alpha). You have to use gif/png for that. For logos of any sort you should always go like this (from best to worst): \nsvg > png > gif > jpg\nBut saving from jpg to png will not magically delete the white pixels. So you have to crop it out. That is really annoying thing to do. So try to find out .png version of the logo.\naaand I found it here\nAlso this is unrelated to cmder so I am closing this one :hammer: \n. It looks like ConEmu is not supporting transparent images. But you can download the this image and set it as a bg and it should work fine :)\n\n. Very good work. I did not know that about the majority of the stuff :-D so good thing you checked it out. \n. Let's see what will happen!\n. Maybe it would help to disable transparency? But it is just a blind shot. \n. Well, I just found clink-completions. That has everything already implemented. We could possibly include that in cmder\n. @sweiss3 You can make a fork and send PR on that repo. I assume @vladimir-kotikov would accept it :+1: . If not we can just use your fork.\nOther than that. I just added a nice way to register lua extensions right from vendor folder. So we can include that repo or your fork into cmder very soon. \n. Why not I guess. Thanks!\n. Every time you make a new shell thru cmder. It injects the clink to the process. That makes the prompt replacement work. When you run it without that, no replacements happen.\nIt is not really something you can fix but I am looking into it right now and I might be able to do it smarter. \n. You can put the line into the vendor/init.bat and you should be good to go.\n. Oh yea! That would be really convenient :-)\nMaybe we can call out to @anurse. To help us!\n. You can use the super secret cmder.exe /register user to add it to context menu.\nI should really document that now...\n. This is interesting. We are basically using implementation from clink batch file. So maybe @mridgers would also be interested in this problem.\n. :cake: Thanks\n. IIRC the default font for Conemu is now Consolas too. So if you set it to Source Code Pro, I will fallback to Consolas. Or if you are ninja and you are willing to spend some time. You can modify the source of Source Code Pro add lambda and build your own font.\n. its your lucky day\n. Got mixed reviews on hacker news for the first time. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6802777. So why are you looping trought all that? I do not really get this part\n. Oh thats a good point :+1: \n. Can we somehow avoid this? The link I used was nice, but as you changed it I guess b/c it does not allow hot linking.\nCould we possibly just name the download the archive, name it conemu-maximus5.zip (or just conemu-maximus5). I am pretty sure 7z only cares about archive metadata/headers. That way we can avoid caring about the extension and filename and this field will be unnecessary.\n. ",

Cmder is a package of 4 different products each with its own individual settings that sometimes conflict.  Cmder.exe will open in the current working directory or a directory you supply on the command line.  If you want cmder to launch from a shortcut in a certain folder every time configure the shortcut start directory instead.  Cmder here will continue to work as expected this way.. Try this.  I have not done this but it should work.\n\nDrop ruby folder in %cmder_root%\\vendor\nEdit %cmder_root%\\config\\user-profile.cmd\nAdd this on a new line 'set path=%cmder_root%\\vendor[ruby_folder]\\bin;%path%' without the single quotes. Replace [ruby_folder] with the actual name of the ruby folder.\nOpen a new cinder session.. Yes.  That's the way Windows and every other operating system works.  Not sure how you think it would work any other way.. Understand.  I think since this is an old as well as a closed issue the dev team has decided not to pursue it.\n\nIt would have to be some sort of script that ran as a part of cmder startup that dynamically updated the path based on a directory containing exe, com, bat, and cmd files for the running session further slowing startup that is already a complaint of many cmder users.  I would not count on it geting added any time soon.. @mhamri Why?  Current cmder will open in the current dir or a command line specified dir IF your tasks are not using legacy config from older versions.  You should never edit init.bat. @arfmach what you say does not work works fine for me with current cmder versions IF your tasks are not using legacy config from older versions.  . Hardcoding the task is not the right answer.  Most of you want to be able to open a cmder session in a folder from explorer.  This should work using cmder /REGISTER [USER|ALL].  This adds the Cmder Here context menu you can get to by a right click on the folder.\nIn all situations I would recommend downloading the latest version of cmder and make sure your tasks do not use the -new-console argument at all.\nWhat exactly are the rest of you trying to do here, and I do mean 'exactly'.  Give me the process step by step from the very beginning.  Are you in explorer and want to open cmder in a right clicked folder?  Are you in a Windows cmd.exe or a cmder session and want to open cmder in the current folder by typing cmder [something]? Or clicking a shortcut icon?  I believe cmder can indeed work in all these sutuations, just need to know what you,are trying to do.\nIn all situations I would recommend downloading the latest version of cmder and make sure your tasks do not use the -new_console argument at all.. @onewhaleid did you try my suggestions?  I have not with your use case.. @onewhaleid I tried various things also and could not make that option work.  The context menu is your best option for explorer.. This is fixed try a nightly build.  See the readme.md. Fixed in v1.3.8. & in batch is a reserved character and should not be used in folder or filenames. I am surprised it was even possie.\nWe can't fix this.. @noxasch Not a good solution as it will be overwritten on update.  Instead add the below to a file called %cmder_root%\\config\\my_prompt.lua:\n```\nfunction my_prompt_filter()\n    cwd = clink.get_cwd()\n    prompt = \"\\x1b[1;32;40m{cwd}{git}{hg}{svn}\\x1b[1;30;40m{lamb} \\x1b[0m\"\n    new_value = string.gsub(prompt, \"{cwd}\", cwd)\n    clink.prompt.value = string.gsub(new_value, \"{lamb}\", \"\u03bb\")\nend\nclink.prompt.register_filter(my_prompt_filter, 1)\n``. @michidk/register alldoes not honor/singleunless you do/register all /singlesame thing for/register user /single`.\nI wrote this support so I know it worked on my system.  I will need to test it again.. This is possible today using the computername specific conemu.xml.  Just copy 'vendor/maximus5-conemu/conemu.xml' to 'config/conemu-%COMPUTERNAME%.xml'.  Any change from this point forward done using the conemu fui will also be backed up in the file you copied.. Added to Readme.md. or you could use a mintty session in the development branch\n. Mintty is already a part of cmder in the development branch.\n. @rmorrin it is not a limitation of ssh, rather it is because the Windows console so I that cmder uses for cmd and PowerShell shells is limited to 16 colors.  \nAs I said in earlier responses the development branch uses a newer Git for Windows that includes the xterm-256 capable mintty.   This in itself creates other issues.  See development branch readme.md where all of this is explained for more.\n. Output of 'echo $TERM'\n. At you in a mintty session?  If so type 'export TERM=xterm-256color' and try again.\n. Then I am guessing you are not in a mintty session in under.  What are you choosing from the tasks menu to launch your session.  If cmder, powershell, or bash these do not support w56 color.  Note mintty sessions are only available in cmder development branch at this time so if you are running released cmder 1.2 you will not find it.\nYou can add Babun to released cmder tasks and it will use mintty and should work with 256 colors.\n. @willemdh  Glad you got it working.  When you do an update via the ConEmu GUI you are updating the ConEmu portion of Cmder not the full Cmder package.\nThe error you posted above looks like you downloaded the Cmder source zip and not a Cmder distribution zip.  The difference being the distribution zip includes '[cmder_root]\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5..\\git-for-windows\\usr\\bin\\mintty.exe\" plus all the other bits Cmder requires but the source zip does not.\nif you open a Powershell prompt outside Cmder and chenge to 'C:\\Users\\Willem\\Dropbox\\Utilities\\cmder-development\\scripts' and type '.\\build.ps1 --verbose' it will download all the components missing from the source distribution.  This will fix 'mintty' from the Cmder tasks menu throwing the error and you will not need to add Babun to Cmder defeating one of the major features of Cmder, portability.\n. Pressing enter also resizes vim.  Closing.. Fixed in current release. @adam-arold Do you have a %cmder_root%\\config\\user-aliases.and file? Never versions of cmder 1.3.2+, I think, store aliases in this file.. @adam-arold The alias command run in 'cmder' shell based on cmd.exe should write the alias to the file I mentioned in my last post preserving it for future sessions.\nIf using a 'bash' shell aliases created using the alias command are not saved unless you manually add them to '%cmder_root%/config/user-aliases.sh'\nSince your aliases contain / and you say aliases are not preserved across sessions I assume you are using a bash shell.. @adam-arold. File content?\nShould look something like:\nalias aliasname='cmd args'\nalias aliasname2='cmd2 args2'. @adam-arold All is working as expected.  The alias command in bash sets an alias for the running session only.  To make it permanent and cmder portable you add it manually to the file I told you about.  If you are not worked about it being portable the bash way would be to manually add it to the ~/.bashrc file.. @xelra what version of cmder? If not latest, download the latest and follow the upgrade procedure in the readme.md.. @maxpower9000 the \"don't\" is syntax for linux/Unix\nThe \"do\" is syntax for 'cmder' command alias.bat. @jakoandersen is that a question?  If so, Cmder aliases in cmd based shells are based on doskey.  See the doskey macro docs details on how to do advanced aliases. . The *.example it's supposed to be copied to the config folder and named what you named it on first launch if it doesn't already exist.  If that didn't happen there's probably a bug in the init.bat.  if you copy it there manually you should start having some default aliases. Cmder cmd session aliases are based on doskey.  Look there for syntax.\nAlso no need to restart cmder, just execute user_aliases.cmd if you edit it directly.. @bholmquist11 WSL Bash is technically an external *nix env according to cmder.  You have two choices:\n\nAdd aliases to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile\nNote: These aliases are not portable and are specific to this machine\n\n\nSee this in the README.md.\n. Should this look for ConEmu-%computername%.xml or user-ConEmu.xml?  The latter fits more with what is going on with user config files for the various supported shells.  \n\nI would also suggest an addition to the .gitignore of config/ConEmu-*.xml if we stick with the %computername% route.  user-ConEmu.xml would already be ignored based on the current development .gitignore.\n. No.  The current development branch supports the following user shell specific config files:\nPowershell = config/user-profile.ps1\nCmder = config/user-startup.cmd\nBash = config/user-cmder.sh\nI suggested 'user-conemu.xml' to fit the pattern established by the above files and because currently the development '.gitignore' ignores 'config/user-*'. \nI guess I did not understand what you were trying to accomplish, it is clearer now.  It sounds like you are looking for a different conemu config based on the name of the system?  Not sure why but everyone has different needs.\nI guess if you wanted to fit the established pattern AND have what you need it could be 'config/user-%computername%-ConEmu.xml'.\nI like configurability/flexibility so I like it what you are doing, I just saw an existing pattern and this did not quite fit the pattern so I thought I'd ask.\nEDIT: I personally like the ability to feed the exe an xml file on the command line that way I can create shortcuts to launch whatever I want.\n. This issue is closed, there is no news to be had.  There is already a feature to save open tabs.  If this is not what you want I suggest you ask the conemu developer for a feature enhancmwnt.  We do not maintain conemu.. Cmder has the complete Git for Windows which does,not have the compilers.  You probably want the Git for Windows SDK dowloadable here https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/releases.  It is easier to setup and deal with than mingw.  Install it then you can integrate it into cmder.\n. Asked and answered.. Answered. I like this looking at it maybe to add.. I did find the site you referrenced. I looked at it and my initial reaction is not to add it to cmder.  I had issues with it closing the cmder window.  Are you using it with cmder currently?. History works in all 3 session types so closing due to inactivity on this ticket.. Path was removed from conemu.xml other issue nis expected behavior closing. init.batshould not be running when starting cygwin.bat unless you are calling cygwin.bat from a Cmder session started by init.bat.  That being said I see no reason to set %HOME% to %USERPROFILE% other than to make the whole shell more Unix/Linux like.  However I am reluctant to change it since the feature has been this way for so long and there are plenty of workarounds for it.\nPossible solutions:\n\nUnset it in the user_profile.cmd\nAlways run cygwin using conemu task directive: conemu /cmd {cygwin}\nUnset %HOME% in Cygwin.bat (or create own one)\n\nWon't fix.  Closing. @AlexHankins Add to the %cmder_root%\\user_profile.ps1:\n. $profile. You guys keep calling this a bug but I can't reproduce it.  If we can't reproduce it and you keep masking it by just changing it to $ it will never get fixed as you guys seem to want based on the recent comments.\nIf someone can find a root cause and tell us how to reproduce it might be looked at but until that happens no one on the Cmder team is trying to 'fix' it.. If you do want to just mask it there are better ways than changing the clink.lua because this file is overwritten on upgrade.. @justsoos are you using the up arrow to cycle through history as others have mentioned? And then backspacing to the beginning of the line?. Hey there,\nCmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem or want a new feature with that, please open a bug/feature request over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\nThank you! :). I use vundle with vim in cmder.  It works fine.\n. I use this in Cmder using the bash shell.  It could probably work with Cmd based shell but currently that is not a requirement for me so i have not investigated it.  Its not portable at this time in that it is not a part of Cmder but I am thinking about trying to make it portable.  \nMy ~/.vim folder, the only thing I cloned there manually was 'Vundle.vim'\n/c/Users/]username]/.vim/\n\u25be bundle/\n  \u25b8 gundo.vim/\n  \u25b8 lightline.vim/\n  \u25b8 nerdtree/\n  \u25b8 tabular/\n  \u25b8 vim-fugitive/\n  \u25b8 vim-ps1/\n  \u25b8 Vundle.vim/\n  \u25b8 YankRing.vim/\n\u25b8 colors/\n\u25b8 doc/\n\u25b8 plugin/\n  colors.tar\n  vundles.vim\nIn my ~/.vimrc file\n```\n\" =============== Vundle Initialization ===============\n\" This loads all the plugins specified in ~/.vim/vundles.vim\n\" Use Vundle plugin to manage all other plugins\nif filereadable(expand(\"~/.vim/vundles.vim\"))\n  source ~/.vim/vundles.vim\nendif\n```\nIn ~/.vim/vundles.vim\n```\nset nocompatible              \" be iMproved, required\nfiletype off                  \" required\n\" set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize\nset rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim\ncall vundle#begin()\n\" let Vundle manage Vundle, required\nPlugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'\n\" The following are examples of different formats supported.\n\" Keep Plugin commands between vundle#begin/end.\n\" plugin on GitHub repo\nBundle 'tpope/vim-fugitive'\nBundle 'scrooloose/nerdtree'\nBundle \"itchyny/lightline.vim\"\nBundle \"godlygeek/tabular\"\nBundle \"sjl/gundo.vim\"\nBundle \"skwp/YankRing.vim\"\nBundle \"PProvost/vim-ps1\"\n\" All of your Plugins must be added before the following line\ncall vundle#end()            \" required\nfiletype plugin indent on    \" required\n\" To ignore plugin indent changes, instead use:\n\"filetype plugin on\n\"\n\" Brief help\n\" :PluginList       - lists configured plugins\n\" :PluginInstall    - installs plugins; append ! to update or just :PluginUpdate\n\" :PluginSearch foo - searches for foo; append ! to refresh local cache\n\" :PluginClean      - confirms removal of unused plugins; append ! to auto-approve removal\n\"\n\" see :h vundle for more details or wiki for FAQ\n```\nHope this helps.\n. \"~\" is \"%userprofile%\" so \"c:\\users[username]\".\n.

Closing.. cmder.exe %1 or cmder c:\\windows sould work with the latest version 1.3.6\n. %USERPROFILE%.bashrc is now sourced and vendor\\init.bat is not used for bash in see #702\n. @thehackercat you don't want to do that because that file is replaced on update of cmder.  Create a proxy.bat file in %cmder_root%/config/profile.d with:\nset http_proxy=http://10.178.0.84:3128\nset https_proxy=http://10.178.0.84:3128\nset no_proxy=127.0.0.1,localhost,.....\n...... = whatever else you want to bypass proxy.\nYou can also do a proxy.sh that will be uses by bash\nexport http_proxy=http://10.178.0.84:3128\nexport https_proxy=http://10.178.0.84:3128\nexport no_proxy=127.0.0.1,localhost,...... The latest cmder here does not have this problem.. Works in the current version.. It was actually released this week and anyone can be an insider.  They just need to configure theire system to participate.\n. True.  Was not thinking of Windows 10 for corporate use.\n. @viletouch Cmder cmd sessions do indeed use doskey.  $T is definitely valid I have several aliases that use it.\n@luisrudge your question is misphrased.  If you were wanting to concatenate commands $t is the answer.  $t is doskey for &.\nThe question should be how to create alias that uses pipes.  Not sure I have ever tried pipes in a doskey alias but you could try escaping the pipes with either a '\\\" or a '^'.  Most likely alias.bat can't do this and you would need to manually edit the file.\n. @viletouch Then why does this work for me:\n```\nC:\\Users\\dgames.DTG\\cmder\n\u03bb alias test\ntest=dir $T Dir c:\\\nC:\\Users\\dgames.DTG\\cmder\n\u03bb test\n Volume in drive C is Windows\n Volume Serial Number is 2C73-1044\nDirectory of C:\\Users\\dgames.DTG\\cmderdev\n03/20/2016  07:59 AM              .\n03/20/2016  07:59 AM              ..\n11/07/2015  11:01 AM                68 .gitattributes\n03/06/2016  06:14 PM               226 .gitignore\n03/02/2016  07:21 PM             1,285 appveyor.yml\n03/06/2016  06:20 PM              bin\n01/04/2016  04:59 PM              build\n03/06/2016  06:14 PM               424 Cmder.bat\n03/20/2016  08:28 AM              config\n11/07/2015  11:01 AM             1,822 CONTRIBUTING.md\n11/07/2015  11:01 AM              icons\n11/07/2015  11:31 AM              launcher\n03/02/2016  07:45 PM               424 MyCmder.cmd\n03/02/2016  07:30 PM               302 packignore\n03/20/2016  07:58 AM            10,207 README.md\n03/06/2016  03:52 PM              scripts\n03/20/2016  08:54 AM              vendor\n01/04/2016  04:58 PM                 0 Version v1.2.9\n               9 File(s)         14,758 bytes\n               9 Dir(s)  21,213,876,224 bytes free\nVolume in drive C is Windows\n Volume Serial Number is 2C73-1044\nDirectory of c:\\\n12/05/2015  09:36 AM          .aliases [C:\\Users\\dgames.DTG.yadr4win\\aliases.doskey]\n12/05/2015  09:36 AM          .aliases.sh [C:\\Users\\dgames.DTG.yadr4win\\aliases.sh]\n12/05/2015  09:30 AM          .aliases.sh.yadr4win [C:\\Users\\dgames.DTG.yadr4win\\aliases.sh]\n12/05/2015  09:30 AM          .aliases.yadr4win [C:\\Users\\dgames.DTG.yadr4win\\aliases.doskey]\n08/07/2015  11:16 AM              Firmware\n11/25/2015  08:51 AM              git-sdk-64\n12/18/2015  09:23 AM              Intel\n11/01/2015  09:20 AM             4,256 log.txt\n10/30/2015  02:24 AM              PerfLogs\n01/04/2016  05:38 PM              Program Files\n02/01/2016  08:36 PM              Program Files (x86)\n11/16/2015  07:26 PM              recovered\n01/04/2016  05:33 PM              tools\n12/18/2015  09:26 AM              Users\n03/07/2016  09:04 AM              Windows\n01/23/2016  12:02 PM              Windows.old\n               5 File(s)          4,256 bytes\n              11 Dir(s)  21,213,876,224 bytes free\n```\nThis also works:\nC:\\Users\\dgames.DTG\\cmderdev (better_aliases)\n\u03bb alias test\ntest=dir $1 $T Dir c:\\\nAlso if you noticed in my original response I said alias.bat could not handle pipes, \"Most likely alias.bat can't do this and you would need to manually edit the file.\"\n.

See: https://conemu.github.io/en/ChildGui.html\nClosing.. Working on this..... fixed. I don't get it.  What will emoji support be used for in a terminal/she'll app like Cmder/ConEmu.\nCan someone explain to me what this means?\n. You could all +1,000,000,000 this here and it will do no good.  This is not a feature for the cmder team to add.  If you want emoji support it would need to be added to ConEmu or maybe even Windows Console subsystem by Microsoft.  ConEmu is a component of Cmder and not developed by the Cmder Team.  I think you all know Microsoft.\nGood Luck! . @DRSDavidSoft Thanks for the good explanation.  I get it, it would be nice for tools that use them.  I just never associated the word emoji with this.. This is fixed in the development branch for all three shell types cmder, powershell and bash and can be closed. See #702 \n. What do you guys think of my suggestion of having a cmder team controlled aliases file that is loaded first then a config\\user-aliases file that is loaded second?  This would require making the bin\\alias.bat manage config\\user-aliases.\nI have verified this would work and it is an easy change.\nI have about a lot of aliases, mostly Git related, that make most Git commands 1-5 characters for both cmd and bash.  I could also look at making these work Powershell.  It would be nice to add these to Cmder.\nA user could override any included macro with his own by adding it to the config/user-aliases, config/user-profile.ps1, or config/user-profile.sh.\nEdit: Unfortunately Powershell's new-alias and set-alias are lame and cannot make aliases that have command line arguments.  So really useful Powershell aliases are not likely to happen. \n. ConEmu.xml could be handled I a similar way I am handling cmder.sh and similarly to the way you handled aliases.  There could be a default vendor/conemu.xml.default file that is copied to the config dir by Cmder.exe if it does not already exist before it launches ConEmu.exe.  This requires changes to cmder.exe that I cannot do or I would and create a PR.  Somebody? :-)\nThis plus your cmder.lua suggestion just leaves the settings file to deal with.  Not even sure what it does but it could be handled in a similar way as well leaving the config/ dir a create on demand and purely for user config that is never overwritten.  I like it.\n. @rmorrin I am right there with you. I currently have two files.  One for bash and one for cmd.  Powershell aliases suck so they will never be as functional as cmd/sh.\n. @MartiUK - I think coding some bash to parse the config/aliases file and convert it to bash aliases would not be too tough as long and that file did not contain any Doskey special characters like $B, $G, $L, $T $$, and $*.  \nThe  problems I see are not all macros will work in bash and cmd and if you want to save macros in bash you would have to manually edit the config/aliases files in doskey format.  Just seems clunky and error prone.  Powershell aliases can only alias a single command with no arguments to a single probably shorter command so it is pointless to worry about converting doskey/sh aliases to Powershell. They just do not work right.\n. @janschulz PR#1109 - Addresses the above by backing up the ./vendor/conemu-maximus5/conemu.xml file if it exist at startup to ./config/ConEmu-%COMPUTERNAME%.xml OR ./config/user-ConEmu.xml if one or the other already exists in that order.\nIf neither exists the backup will default to ./config/user-ConEmu.xml this maintains a portable copy of changes made to this file while using cmder that will persist across new installs and updates\n. @CollinChaffin see #1109 for an explanation for how it actually works today in current cmder versions, it may also be explained in the readme.md.  Your user conemu config is actually stored in config\\user_conemu.xml or config\\conemu_%computername%.xml if you specify you want computer specific config via cmder.exe command line options.  It may be a - and not an _, I can't remember since we tried to remove all dashes at your request , to try and get Tcc.exe working and I don't know if we did this file, I am on my cell phone and can't look right now. \nSo if you must edit the xml file to make config changes edit either the config\\conemu_%computername%.xml or the default config\\user_conemu.xml\nI believe it was recommended at one time, EDIT: #600, by maximus5, that the conemu.xml file used by conemu exe be in the conemu folder so that's where we put it.  We, however, need a cmder specific starting point so we have cmder specific session tasks in the conemu gui.  That is what the 'default' conemu.xml file is for.  I don't like the location either, it should be in vendor since it is literally used one time in a fresh install of cmder.\nThe backup of the settings on cmder start is not a perfect solution but it's the only solution we have since cmder.exe is a launcher and not a wrapper.  It launches conemu and exits so we cannot backup the settings when conemu closes.  We are following the conemu authors recomendation on where the file should be and that will probably not change.\nI have been using cmder for years and have not had data loss since this feature was implemeted, that is why I added the functionality in the first place.\nI am sorry you had some data loss but I must ask, what version are you running.  Cmder.exe even posts an error message if it is unable to backup the file on start.\nIf you want to change the config storage path that is up to you just don't use one of the above mentioned filenames.\nHope this helps.. I am not where I can look at it right now but I am not aware of the \"-%COMPUTERNAME%.history\" duplication.  This is not a feature I have never tried to use more do I know much more about it than what you have seen in the cpp.  The cpp has nothing to do with history.\nIt could just be an 'undocumented feature' or as I call them a bugs.  Clink handles the history.  Maybe look in vendor/clink.lua. Yeah when you said cpp I thought you meant the cmder launcher cpp code.  Honestly I have never even considered looking at clink or conemu code, never had a reason.\nShared folder access for Cmder is a relatively new and probably under used feature.  \nI assume you have seen the -c cmder.exe command line argument?  This separates the user config folder from the cmder binaries but uses config from both locations.  It allows a shared cmder config with user customization and individuality  I have not tested it personally with regard to .history storage.  I have not done a lot of looking at how history is handled, again never had a need to.  I will see what I can find but my guess it is still clink and it has to do with the clink profile location specified when clink is started from init.bat.  I doubt it would know any thing about system specific history files as this is a truly cmder unique feature.\n. @collinchaffin the -c is something I added to cmder because users had requested a way to use cmder in a multi user use case and I had my own reasons.  \nThe ignore config pr is related to your question only in that it gave me a reason to look at the cmder launcher cpp.  I am a strong believer that everything in config is user data and should not be touched by us.  We have been slowly moving things we own from there to vendor.\nI have played some with the computer specific config and I have not see ths -%computername% phenomena you mentioned.  I guess I don't fully understand what you are doing if not using the -c because without it I would fully expect all users to share everything in the %cmder_root% where launch launched cmder.exe from.  \nJust thinking about this tells me that -c needs some work for your use case.  Multi user cmder is not really for your use case because cmder.exe puts the conemu.xml where conemu recommends which requires write access to cmder/vendor/conemu and varying config depending on who launched it last.\nA better approach would be if using -c use the user-conemu.xml or the conemu-%computername%.xml preferring the latter from %cmder_root%\\config to start conemu.  All user settings set in conemu are truly user settings at that point.\nIf that file doesn't exist the copy it from the shared cmder/vendor/conemu install to config then use it from there.\nHopefully this makes sense?\n. @collinchaffin I just made a cmder version that does exactly what I suggested above if you are interested.  I will do a pr after some additional testing.. I am also working on enabling the use of the new  git bash.  Should be ready soon\n. It will be a separate pull request though\n. It is in the source so i fixed it.  Do with it whatever you feel is necessary.\n. It might look wierd but it is correct.\nIt looks even wierder when you look at the %path% or a variable that has \n'\\' in it.\nOn November 12, 2015 6:54:47 AM Benjamin Staneck notifications@github.com \nwrote:\n\nI think it looks weird without the \\in the paths :/\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/698#issuecomment-156096053\n. We could do that to get rid of the wierdness.\n\nThat would also require changes to my other pull request as it behaves in a manner consistent with what init.bat does and expects %CMDER_ROOT% and $CMDER_ROOT both end with either a '\\' or '/'.\nI can work on both to correct.\n. I actually modified the .gitignore in my last commit so it is relevant to all and does not contain any personal files.

Squashed\n. hang on something got messed up in the squash let me fix it.\n. Squash fixed.  One commit 3 files changed.  Sorry about that somehow I combined two branches. in the previous squash\n. Making one more change.\n. The development branch had no support for a bash shell as previous version did, as for the  changes and why I saw most of them as related.  Note: See below for possible unrelated changes that could be backed out.\n1. Adding 'vendor/cmder.sh' - Is required for Msys2 bash, to normalize $CMDER_ROOT for the unix like env and to get git into the path in a portable fashion.\n2. Modifying 'scripts\\build.ps1' - Is required for Msys2 bash, to place 'cmder.sh' in /etc/profile.d post download and expansion of vendor\\git-for-windows\n3. Modifying 'packignore' - Is required for Msys2 bash, to ignore 'vendor/cmder.sh' during packaging since it does not need to be there in the final packaged distribution because it was put in '.\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\etc\\profile.d\\cmder.sh' buy the changed 'scripts\\build.ps1'\n4. Modifying '.\\config\\ConEmu.xml' - Is Required for Msys2 Bash, to add the task to launch this shell.\nI did the four above changes in the same pull request for the sake of completeness and to match what I saw was happening with the Cmd.exe and Powershell.exe based tasks already defined in the 'development' branch.\nIf you prefer I can back out the two seemingly unrelated changes I mentioned below and resubmit but in my opinion the .gitignore changes are required and should stay.\nPossible unrelated changes:\n1. '.gitignore' changes - This just looked like an oversight to me that needed to me fixed since the files are auto created on first run of each shell type and you don't want them in the repo.\n2. Renaming task 'cmd' to 'cmder' in 'config\\conemu.xml' - This was in the same file that required changes to add a task msys2 bash in change 4 above.   Most of the changes in here are time/datestamps written by ConEmu that I had no control of that will not affect the operation of ConEmu.\n. I was not replacing cmd with bash, at least I don't think I did.  I was adding bash using mintty.exe as an additional option because there was none in the 'development' branch I pulled down and I could not figure out the ConEmu commands required to get it woking with cmd.  \nThere were three tasks cmd, powershell, and powershell as admin there was no bash.  I added the 4th task.\nMaybe someone added the 4th task launching bash from cmd between when I pulled the development branch and when I created the pull request?  I did not even notice it was a change vs. an add in the pull request until now.\n. Actually I just pulled down a clean copy of development and there are still only 3 options.  No bash.\nThe ConEmu.xml is not loading the 4th task defined in the file that is bash because the ConEmu Task count is set to 3 and not 4.\n. No, I was trying to add a 4th task because there was no bash task when I look at con-emu tasks.  so I added a 4th task.  Since the task count in conemu.xml was 3 instead of 4 my attempted 'adding' of a 4th task actually 'edited/replaced' a hidden 4th task called 'git sh' that used cmd.exe to launch bash.exe.\nI made an additional change to the conemu.xml that renamed the default task from cmd to cmder.  this second change was completely unrelated to my msys2_bash change.  \nI am going to resubmit to try and clean this up so there will be a total of 5 tasks:\n1. cmd\n2. powershell\n3. powershell as admin\n4. git sh - the original 4th task that was hidden\n5. git mintty - the task I was trying to add.  It uses mintty instead of cmd to launch bash and seems much faster than task number 4.\n. New/Clarified changes:\n1. All shells types [ cmd, powershell, bash/mintty] now have working standard user and admin user tasks. (Admin sessions added at request of Jan Schultz above)\n2. Shell tasks are grouped by shell types [ cmd, powershell, bash/mintty ] with a cascading menu for each.  I cascaded them to abbreviate and organize the tasks menu.\n3. Admin tasks for powershell and bash now launch without file/path not found errors.  When I added the admin tasks they did not work so I fixed them rather than committing broken code.\n4. Init.bat launches .\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\post-install.bat if it exists. Note: This file is deleted after it is run.  See vendor\\git-for-windows\\README.postinstall for details as to why.\n5. Bash shell types no longer require init.bat to setup $CMDER_ROOT env variable prior to running /bin/bash, no more exit bash then exit cmd, seems a little faster to launch also.\n6. Bash shell types now allow for user level customization via $CMDER_ROOT/config/user-cmder.sh like Cmder and Powershell.\nAny questions let me know.\n. New/Clarified changes:\n1.

Hey Martin, I don't think there are any of bits like you suggested that \nneed to be documented as long as the Git for Windows postinstall.bat file \nis included in the packed distribution everything should be automatic. \nThere were no key binding changes that I'm aware of, if so  they were \naccidental.\n\nMain things I added to the bash support were the ability use the native Git \nfor Windows terminal 'mintty', to do cmder portable user-specific config \nfrom the config/user-cmder.sh file and that the /etc/profile.d/cmder.sh \nwill source the %userprofile%.bashrc if it exists.\nBiggest default user visible changes were organisation of the tasks menu \ninto a cascading menu by shell type.\nAlso the mintty tasks may be an issue for inclusion in cmder because they just work differently since they do not use the Windows Console API.  If you want to leave them out I understand.\nOn November 20, 2015 4:36:01 AM Martin Kemp notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@daxgames Any instructions needed in the readme.

Does this apply to the curent development branch?  Vendor/msysgit does not exist?\n. Yes, the development version of vendor/profile.ps1 allows you to put user specific Powershell config in config/user-profile.ps1 without affecting the default user config.\n. I know I am not a trusted-contributer, maybe someday, but I am a big fan and daily user of Cmder.\n\nI think we should mention this is probably the most complete Cmder release to date supporting Cmder enhancements/portability in all three shell types, but that is probably stating the obvious.\n. Works with current version.  Closing. This is probably one of the normal differences when using Mintty vs the Windows Console API.  These differences are briefly called out in the development branch README.md.  I doubt it will be addressed.\nI personally like that Ctrl+W does not close a tab when using mintty because Ctrl+W in vim is how you access vim splits/panes.\n. I don't know.  I'd say the best solution is to not use the mintty tasks and stick with the others if Cider/ConEmu key bindings are important to you.\n. It would probably work fine if I could build the cmder.exe but I can't because I do not have the tools.  I, and anyone else trying/developing on the dev branch that cannot build the exe, use the cmder.bat to start cmder hence no icons.\nI just did what I did so it would work all the time with or without the cmder.exe.  To me working all the time was better than working some of the time even if the cmder.bat is deprecated.\n. Sure.  Will do later today.\n. Done\n. I made a suggestion in #694 and I agree if we can deal with those last two files.\n. Wait on this one I need to check some stuff before merging.\n. This is good to go now.  I was seeing some init funkyness and determined it was unrelated to this change.  This has been tested with Babun(Cygwin), msys, msys2, and the Git for Windows SDK(msys2)\n. @MartiUK - Should I close this?  Is there any chance it will make it in?  If it might did you see my profile.d PR #855.  If this might make it in I would want to add the profile.d bits to it as well.\n. Updating with profile.d like support in #855 - Do not merge until I release here.\n. This is ready whenever you are.\n. Open PowerShell. Type 'set-execution policy remotesigned' without the quotes.\n. Needs to be PowerShell as admin\n. Mine opens using same screen position it had when I closed it.  Closing due to it seems to now work as requested and inactivity.. @vladimir-kotikov I have this too.  You know what it is and how to fix it.  I'm not a lua expert but since this came from your repo I hope you know how to fix it?\n. Mine is an issue on WIndows 7.  Have not tried Windows 8.\n. I updated to the latest clink but no fix.  it turned out that I had outdated lua bits in my config folder.\n. if not then I suggest:\nvendor\\init.bat\nif exist \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\git-for-windows\" (\n    set \"GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\git-for-windows\"\n)\nvendor\\profile.ps1\nif ( test-path $($env:CMDER_ROOT + \"\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\bin\\git.exe\") ) {\n    $env:Path += $(\";\" + $env:CMDER_ROOT + \"\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\bin\")\n}\n. I would think we would only use externally installed Git if Cmder Mini was in use and thus did not include the vendor\\git-for-windows folder.\n. So maybe the best code would be:\nvendor\\init.bat:\n:: Check if msysgit is installed if running Cmder Mini\n@if exist \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\git-for-windows\" (\n    set \"GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\git-for-windows\"\n) else if exist \"%ProgramFiles%\\Git\" (\n    set \"GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=%ProgramFiles%\\Git\"\n) else if exist \"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Git\" (\n    set \"GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Git\"\n) else if exist \"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\" (\n    set \"GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\"\n)\nvendor\\profile.ps1\nif ( test-path $($env:CMDER_ROOT + \"\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\bin\\git.exe\") ) {\n    $env:Path += $(\";\" + $env:CMDER_ROOT + \"\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\bin\")\n} else {\n    try {\n        # Check if git is on PATH, i.e. Git already installed on system\n        Get-command -Name \"git\" -ErrorAction Stop >$null\n    } catch {\n        Write-Warning \"Missing git support, download the full Cmder that includes Git or install Git for Windows.\"\n    }\n}\n. Git and the *nix like environment is why I use cmder so I personally would say no.\n. works with current version, closing. @chrisxaustin This module is an integral part of Cmder Powershell sessions, if you don't like or want ot the don't run a Cmder Powershell session.\nJust create a new Powershell task that does not use Cmder's profile.ps1 to configure the session.. The recently added bash/mintty is based on msys2 not cygwin.  It is better \nthat the old stuff but it's not not Babun/cygwin IMHO. :-)\nBabun/Cygwin is much not more functional and very possibly overkill for the \naverage cmder user.   It is so easy to add both if these to cmder if the \nuser is a power user and a fringe use case so I see no reason to add it out \nor the box, also just my opinion.\nI have a pull request out there, \nhttps://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/740, that is just a simple script \nyou can add to your externally installed *nix setup to incorporate cmders \nportable profile configs into it.  It is currently marked do not merge at my request, not \nsure why it is still marked that way though.\nNote in addition to adding this to your external external *nix \n/etc/profile.d you need to add a Cmder Task to actually launch the external \nsession\nOn January 20, 2016 9:47:17 AM Benjamin Staneck notifications@github.com \nwrote:\n\nWell we recently added bash/mintty, does that help?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/807#issuecomment-173244583\n.

Seems to work in the current version.  Closing.. What you are expecting is wrong.  Tab completion works as it would on a Linux system, the current folder is not in the path and must be specified using .\\ or ./.  Try:\n.\\bu[tab]\n. It does for me.  What version you running?\n\n. Specifically what icons? Cmder is a suite that uses conemu as a component but the main cmder icons are not part of conemu.. It has nothing to to with cmder/vim compatibility.\nCmder uses the windows command line subsystem by default which supports 16 colors.  Most likely this is your issue.  Git-bash outside cmder uses mintty which does support more than 16 colors.\nThe latest cmder master branch and 1.3 pre-release binary code allows you to run bash in mintty or using the windows command line subsystem.  Using mintty in cmder will probably solve your issue.\n. Unaliased git even requires quotes so this is not an issue.\n. I would like to ultimately see if this can be expanded to adding msys2 bits to git for windows inside cmder.  Thoughts?\n. Your probably right about not messing with the bundled Git for Windows \nstuff.

All good points.  I was just trying to make it easy to extend and configure Cmder with portable apps.  This does that.\n\nAs for maintaining plugins I, honestly I did not think about that.  I assume if someone makes a plug-in they would maintain it.  I personally don't plan on maintaining anyone else's plugins.\nI work from several different machines and I like my env to be as close to identical on all as possible.  Carrying a flash drive or having an archive in the cloud, or even a git repo/archive full of scripts to build an eng seems to me the best/easiest way to achieve this.  I am not a big Chocolatey user, I never even considered using it alongside Cmder.  Its a good idea, maybe I should try it.\nI like to code and I just saw an opportunity to streamline and automate something that I have wanted and seen some people ask about.\nMaybe it shouldn't be a part of core Cmder For the reasons you stated.  It could be an add-on that people can use of they want to.  Either way it does not matter to me, it's above my pay grade.\n. What about combining the approached?  Cmder plugins that use Chocolatey to do the installl and the magic of the plug-in is the binding of that Chocolatey managed install to the cmder env.  \nMy goal was to create something re-useable by many without everyone having to do custom scripting to extend Cmder.\n. That is sort of what have me the idea.  It was out there but under utilized \nsince there was no way to apply an add-on vendor.  Which is why I wrote one.\nOn February 24, 2016 12:23:33 PM Martin Kemp notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n@vladimir-kotikov I had an idea for something similar a while back.

I just wanted to explain the use case for this PR to justify its inclusion in core CMder. \nI use Cmder with a team of people as a shared work env.  We actually have a shared config in a git repo that we overlay on top of a binary Cmder distro so all team members can contribute to the shared config bits via source control.  This PR is how we are able to manage the shared aliases while allowing users to have user personal aliases.  We create '%cmder_root%\\config\\profile.d\\shared-aliases.cmd' and '%cmder_root%\\config\\profile.d\\user-aliases.cmd', they execute in that order so the user has final say and can override any shared alias.\n.

Tested, verified safe, and implemented in #873.\n. Fixed in #873\n. Correct.  It turns off echo for the duration of the current script. \n\nI did the exact same testing.\n. I think this might be an issue for ConEmu.  I see nothing in the environment that a script can trigger on after duplicating root.  Also if you look at the confirmation box from ConEmu it specifically mentions cmd.exe even when duplicating a bash session. \n. Did you already have a user-aliases.cmd? or did you rename aliases manually to user-aliases.cmd?\n. The logic for the update prior to my pull requests today is below\n```\nif not exist \"%user-aliases%\" (\n   echo Creating intial user-aliases store in \"%user-aliases%\"...\n   copy \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\user-aliases.cmd.example\" \"%user-aliases%\"\n)\n:: Update old 'user-aliases' to new self executing 'user-aliases.cmd'\nif exist \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\aliases\" (\n  echo Updating old \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\aliases\" to new format...\n  type \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\aliases\" >> \"%user-aliases%\" && del \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\aliases\"\n)\n```\nSo if all you had was the old aliases file and no pre-existing  'user-aliases.cmd' a new 'user-aliases.cmd' SHOULD have been created from the new 'vendor\\user-aliases.cmd.example' which contains the self extracting logic.  Then if the 'aliases' file exists it is appended to the new 'user-aliases.cmd' and 'aliases is deleted at that point.\nI don't see a flaw unless your 'vendor\\user-aliases.cmd.example' does not have the self extracting loigic and I can't explain that.\nI did a pull request today that makes the process a little more robust.  Please let me know if you figure out why it does not work.\n. Cool, glad you figured it out.\n. It works only in a bash session in CMDER.  I use it all the time.\nSee: #535 \n.

I am also using the 'cmder_exinit' component in Cmder with Babun to allow Babun to use the init scripts defined in $CMDER_ROOT/config.  Maybe why I am not getting it?\n. Output of 'git --version' and 'which git' from a bash session?\n. No idea.  I had an issue with git 2.8.0 but 2.8.1 fixed it.\nOutput of 'dir \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\"' from inside CMDER?\n. Output of 'ls'\n. Glad to help.\n. First step would be to use cmder_mini distribution OR if you already have cmder full installed just delete the %cmder_root%/vendor/git-for-windows folder.  Then start cmder.\n. I had a downlevel git 2.7.2 installed in \"C:\\program files\\git\" that was being used by cmder.  Upgrading that to 2.8.1 using the git for windows installer fixed my issue.  However the issue still exists with git 2.8.0 bundled with cmder.  \nI renamed the external git and updated cmder to git 2.8.1 by editing sources.json and rebuilt and all is good now.\n. fixes #910 \n. Should be fixed in current version.  Closing.. Works with the latest version.  Closing. Nope have not seen this.\n. Typo where?  See my latest pull request for a little more explanation.\n. There is no need to use Choclatey to install cmder, there is no install process.  Download, unzip, done!\nJust my $.02.\n. In cmder session:\nSet http_proxy=http://[proxy]:[port]\nSet https_proxy=http://[proxy]:[port]\nIn bash session:\nexport http_proxy=http://[proxy]:[port]\nexport https_proxy=http://[proxy]:[port]\nIn PowerShell session:\n$env:http_proxy=http://[proxy]:[port]\n$env:https_proxy=http://[proxy]:[port]\nYou can also add these commands to a proxy.cmd, proxy.sh, and proxy.ps1 \nscript in the [cmder]\\config\\profile.d folder to set the proxy on every \nsession start.\n. What I told you is it.  This is the way to use proxy in Windows and Linux consoles.  It really has nothing to do with cmder.\n. @lunyx Trying this tonight when I get home.  It is painfully slow on the vpn but fast in the office.  Will let you know.\n. Works as requested in the current version.  Closing.. I don't understand the question.  There is no difference between running \nthis in cmd and cmder is once cmder uses cmd as it's default shell.\n. Not enough info dead link.  Closing. cmder %cd%. Awesome!  Clad to see this is finally out.\n. @jrappen I know this is closed but want to make sure things are working as designed.\nIf you had an existing aliases file in %CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\aliases and copied the 1.3 release files from an extracted archive into %COMDER_ROOT% then the init.bat is supposed to update your existing aliases file to the new format.  Did you copy the new release into an existing %CMDER_ROOT% folder or start with a fresh new folder with 1.3?\nIf %CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\aliases does not exist when launching 1.3 the first time, from a new folder,  a new default %CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\user-aliases.cmd is created from the seed file.\n. Nevermind on this.  it was some other code that caused my issues.  Closing.\n. Did I open that or to go into master?  I so I meant to open it against development.\n. Cmder wraps conemu, conemu does what you ask.  Doing this with cmder.exe gains you nothing, just use conemu to do it.. @lbaca cmder.exe just launches conemu.exe with a default task that launches init.bat.  The true power of cmder is the init.bat and how it glues together all the software that make up the cmder suite.  If you use conemu.exe to launch init.bat you are doing the same thing cmder.exe does.. rm .git/index.lock\n. @lucas0000miranda how does this have anything to do with cmder if you are on mac osx given cmder is a Windows only app?. @bogacg You should not edit \\cmder\\vendor\\init.bat because your changes will be overwritten on update.  instead you shoul add a path.cmd/path.sh/pasth.ps1 file to cmder\\config\\profile.d\\ that enhances the path with what you need.  These changes will not be overwritten on update.. Just leave those files where they are and edit them.  They also get run.  I like to use profile.d others dont\nIn userprofile.cmd: set path=%path%;c:\\my_dir\nIn userprofile.sh set $PATH=$PATH:c:\\my_dir\nIn userprofile.ps1: $env:path=\"$env:path;c:\\my_dir\". @ethanpil,\nI wrote the alias code you seem to have issues with.  I just downloaded cmder full from the web site, extracted it to a new folder and ran cmder.exe.  It works perfectly see the output of the first run:\n```\nGenerating clink initial settings in \"C:\\Users\\dgames\\Downloads\\cmdernew\\config\\settings\"\nAdditional *.lua files in \"C:\\Users\\dgames\\Downloads\\cmdernew\\config\" are loaded on startup.\nCreating intial user-aliases store in \"C:\\Users\\dgames\\Downloads\\cmdernew\\config\\user-aliases.cmd\"...\n        1 file(s) copied.\nCreating user startup file: \"C:\\Users\\dgames\\Downloads\\cmdernew\\config\\user-profile.cmd\"\nC:\\Users\\dgames\n\u03bb\n```\nThe example file is copied to 'C:\\Users\\dgames\\Downloads\\cmdernew\\config\\user-profile.cmd' if the destination does not exist.  the result of that copy, '1 file(s) copied.' is evident in the output above in a fresh newly extracted and otherwise unmodified directory structure.\nI then closed it and relaunched 'cmder.exe' again with no issues.  See output of the second run  after issuing the 'alias' command to list all default aliases that ultimately came from the file you say is not there:\n```\nC:\\Users\\dgames\n\u03bb alias\nUse /? for help\nclear=cls\nclink=\"C:\\Users\\dgames~1\\DOWNLO~1\\cmdernew\\vendor\\clink/clink_x64.exe\" --cfgdir \"C:\\Users\\dgames\\DOWNLO~1\\cmdernew\\config\" $\ncmderr=cd /d \"%CMDER_ROOT%\"\ne.=explorer .\ngl=git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate  $\nhistory=cat %CMDER_ROOT%\\config.history\nls=ls --show-control-chars -F --color $\npwd=cd\nunalias=alias /d $1\nvi=vim $\nC:\\Users\\dgames\n\u03bb\n```\nI then did EXACTLY the same as above with this development archive, https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/n15ep9jijgcunjes/artifacts/build/cmder.7z, with EXACTLY the same results.\nI cannot duplicate your issues with the limited information provided.\n.

It the example file does not exist after initial extract the issue is most likely in your system because it is definitely in the archive.  Are there spaces in %cmder_root% path?\n. ! is a reserved character in cmd that wraps a delayed expansion variable name.  It is not a good practice to use ! in a file path.\n. Just tested this with latest cmder master branch build that re-enables loading user lua files and it works.\nI added a %cmder_root%\\config\\tilde.lua with the below content:\n```\nlocal function tilde_match (text, f, l)\n    if text == '~' then\n        clink.add_match(clink.get_env('home'))\n        clink.matches_are_files()\n        return true\n    end\n    if text:sub(1, 1) == '~' then\n        clink.add_match(string.gsub(text, \"~\", clink.get_env('home'), 1))\n        -- second match prevents adding a space so we can look for more matches\n        clink.add_match(string.gsub(text, \"~\", clink.get_env('home'), 1) ..

This is not my experience.  Cmder starts in 1-3 seconds\n. Looks good to me.\n. @antsen what exactly is not fixed?\nIf cmder.exe is in my path I can type cmder.exe from any directory and it will open in that directory.  I can even type cmder.exe in the Windows Explorer path bar and it opens in the current directory displayed in Explorer\nI can launch cmder c:\\ and it will open in c:\\\nI can click the green + in conemu and specify a startup dir for a new tab there and it also works.\nI think the problem is with your cmder tasks config the we provide defaults so for on a new install but never touch again because it becomes yours to managed.\nOld versions of cmder had -new_console:d:\"%userprofile%\" in every task.  You need to remove this setting from the tasks in conemu that you use to launch sessions.\nAlso make sure you are using the latest builds of cmder available here\n. 'dir D:\\OneDrive\\Personal\\Software\\cmder\\config\\profile.d' output?  I'm guessing you have a '*.cmd' file in that folder that begins with 'Active' and has spaces in it.\n. Edit %cmder_root%\\vendor\\init.bat and change if not defined verbose-output ( set verbose-output=0 ) to if not defined verbose-output ( set verbose-output=1 ).\nStart a new cmder tab and paste the output here.\n. The code that is calling that is below:\npushd \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\profile.d\"\nfor /f \"usebackq\" %%x in ( `dir /b *.bat *.cmd 2^>nul` ) do (\n  call :verbose-output Calling \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\profile.d\\%%x\"...\n  call \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\profile.d\\%%x\"\n)\npopd\nIn cmder to the following:\ncd %CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\profile.d\ndir /b *.bat *.cmd 2^>nul\nPaste output here.\n. I have no idea.  I don't know why it would find something there during startup and not after.\n. In %cmder_root%\\vendor\\init.bat add dir /b 2>nul on a new line after pushd \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\profile.d\"\nStart a new cmder tab and paste the output here.\nHave you tried removing whatever you did to change the codepage and starting a new cmder window?\nDoes this happen when you start a powershell session or a bash session?\n. Glad you fixed it.\n. You could add that command to %cmder_root%\\config\\user-profile.cmd instead of the registry and it would be portable.\n. Drop a script into $cmder_root/config/profile.d folder.  It has to end with '.sh' for bash, '.cmd' for cmder, or 'ps1' for PowerShell.  Drop as many as you want it will run all scripts in that folder for each shell type.\n. Are you using cmder 1.3.x?  If not update to it and you will have a profile.d folder\n. Hmm.... Thats odd, I thought the profile.d folder was in the distribution but apparently not.  I guess I need to update the code to create it if its is not there on first run.  Will do that today and create a PR.\nType ' ls $CMDER_ROOT\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\etc\\profile.d\\cmder.sh'.  If you have it then you are at least on 1.3.0 and creating '$CMDER_ROOT/config/profile.d/script.sh' should run that script when git bash starts if you are using git-for-windows included with commander (meaning you do not have it installed externally in the path).  Cmder will prefer external git for windows over its own embedded version.\n. Never mind it already is in the source to create it so if its not there you may be downlevel on cmder version OR you are using external git for windows.  if you are using an external git for windows see the readme on how to integrate it with 'cmder_exinit'.\n. Check version by doing 'ls $CMDER_ROOT'\nCHANGELOG.md  CONTRIBUTING.md  Cmder.exe*  README.md  'Version v1.3.0'  bin/  config/  icons/  vendor/\n. If you copy cmder_exinit as stated in the cmder readme.md to your external git for windows /etc/profile.d I folder think it will do what you want.  Have you tried this?\n. If you copy cmder_exinit as stated in the cmder readme.md to your external git for windows /etc/profile.d I folder think it will do what you want.  Have you tried this?\n. From cmder_exinit:\n```\n# Uncomment and edit the CMDER_ROOT line to use Cmder/config even when launched\n# from outside Cmder.\nCMDER_ROOT=${USERPROFILE}/cmder  # This is not required if launched from Cmder.\n```\n. From cmder_exinit:\n```\n# Uncomment and edit the CMDER_ROOT line to use Cmder/config even when launched\n# from outside Cmder.\nCMDER_ROOT=${USERPROFILE}/cmder  # This is not required if launched from Cmder.\n```\n. I do not like having to have a computer name in my custom config file that I want to be the same on all hosts.\n@kodybrown when I added the user-ConEmu.xml check after your computer specific check I removed some code, lines 129-132.  I could not see that these lines actually did anything used by the cmder launcher.\nWill this break your situation somehow?\n. @kodybrown any comments on my add of backing up of the customized config file?  I hated that my ongoing 'conemu.xml' customizations were lost of I deleted the vendor folder for a fresh install.\nThis is nice since it backs up the continually changing 'conemu.xml' file to a computer named file (if it exists in ./config/) or user file if not at cmder launch.\nOnly reason I ask is you are the only one who has expressed interest in custom config.\n. Bump.  Has anyone on the Cmder core team looked at this?\n- This provides a check for a custom user-ConEmu.xml storage that will serve as a user custom default config for any system '%cmder_root%/config' is copied to for new installs.\n  '%cmder_root%/vendor/ConEmu-Maximus5/ConEmu.xml' is maintained as the config file used for all sessions.\n- Possible loss of ongoing changes to '%cmder_root%/vendor/ConEmu-Maximus5/ConEmu.xml' are mitigated by the backup of the last saved settings to the '%cmder_root%/config/' folder .\n- Custom config based on computer name is too specific for most users but some have this use case so it still works.\n. No problem, was just wondering if there were questions.\n. Ok I did compile and test it with Visual Studio Community Edition 2015.  It works in all situations but I am no c++ guru so that would be good.\n. I can push it again as soon as my system comes back up.\n. Pushed, hopefully this allows checks to complete.\n. Syntax hilite?\n. If you disable everything in init.bat why use cmder then?  Cmder is a set of tools including ConEmu that together is an enhanced version of the windows cmd shell and the init.bat is what handles loading those enhancements.  \nFirst time launch is slower because some cfg files are initialized.  Launch will always be SLIGHTLY  slower because it is not vanilla cmd.exe but should not be impactful.  Second launch on my system takes under a second.\n. I have not seen this.\n. cmder mini does not include the 'ls' command so unless you have it installed elsewhere and in the path this is expected behavior.\n. Closing - See https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/2022#issuecomment-473572828. Download the new version and copy it to you old location.  That's it.\n. One clarification the only piece of configuration stored outside the config directory is the conemu.xml which is where all of your startup tests are kept kept.\nI have an open pull req that resolve this issue it just needs to be merged.\n. Upgrading ConEmu is not the same as upgrading Cmder.  Cmder is a compilation of several tools working together to form a whole.\nI never upgrade ConEmu when it is a part of Cmder because bad things can happen.  You should be able to do this but I have had bad results doing this so I don't do it any more.\nThe only way I do this is if building cmder using scripts from the git repo and a new version of conemu is already included.\n. I am sure you see my comments above.  The times I have upgraded by clicking the button presented by conemu and the issues I have had have made me think it's not a good idea to do it.  Granted I have only tried it 2-3 times but I had issues every time.\nYou guys may have a different experience though. \n. is your home folder a git repo?\n. 'git init' makes any folds fit is run in a git repository.  Git supports branches and the default branch is called master.  Cmder is telling you you are in a folder that is a git repository and you are on the master branch.  It is a very useful feature of you use git.  \nDid you type 'git init' in 'C:\\Users(Username)'?  There is probably a folder in this location called '.git' if you rename it the 'master' will go away.  Keep in mind if you did not type git init and some other process did this to track changes for you you could break something.\n. 'git init' makes any folds fit is run in a git repository.

Keep in mind if you did not type git init and some other process did this to track changes for you you could break something.\n. @MandarSant did you get whanted out of this?\n. Can you explain what you are asking?\n. You got it, mostly.  \ncmd/bash/powershell are shells that you can use to write scripts.\nconEmu is a GUI terminal that can run multiple shells in tabs as well as other applications if desired.\nConEmu is a part of Cmder along with Git for Windows, Clink, Clink Completions, and a whole bunch of scripting tying them all together.\nMintty is the native graphical terminal of Git for windows that is integrated into Cmder along with bash.exe - see the Cmder readme.md for differences between Mintty and bash.exe.\n. ConEmu conflig is loaded from vendor/conemu-maximus5/ConEmu.xml, not config/ConEmu.xml on an existing install.\nOn a fresh install where cmder has never run the conemu.xml is copied from config/ConEmu.xml to vendor/conemu-maximus5/ConEmu.xml them conemu is launched and loads the config from vendor/conemu-maximus5/ConEmu.xml all changes via conemu gui are stored here.\n-- start unreleased functionality\nThe currently unreleased cmder.exe will on an existing install copy vendor/conemu-maximus5/ConEmu.xml to config/user-conemu.xml at launch to maintain a 'copy' of the current conemu config.  So as you make changes via conemu gui they are backed up so they are not lost upon deletion of the vendor/conemu folder.\nOn a new install/update if vendor/conemu-maximus5/ConEmu.xml does not exist and config/user-conemu.xml does then config/user-conemu.xml will be copied to vendor/conemu-maximus5/ConEmu.xml and used instead of config/conemu.xml.  \nThe above makes it safe to delete the entire vendor folder and not lose any user config assuming you are not going in an manually editing scripts in this folder.\n-- end unreleased functionality\nHopefully this makes sense.\n. At this time you could do either.  I think we are still trying to decide which.\n. Master is where the new config I spoke of above is located.\n. What reaction, closing It as an upstream issue?  It is an upstream issue.. @xplantefeve You can change the cmder behavior you described to pre-pend git for windows binary path to the path env var.  See: /nix_tools init.bat arg.  This will prefer all cmder binaries over those in the windows path so be sure you know what this changes.. I just downloaded and launched it and did not have the issue.. please turn echo back off and change add\nset verbose-output=1\nto the top of the file rerun it and attach the output here.. Yes.  Look at the readme.md about using cygwin with cmder and cmder_xinit in the cmder/vendor folder.. Actually I am wrong. That file has nothing to do with the prompt.  I will see if I can find it and let you know.. Save this file to /etc/profile.d \nhttps://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/vendor/git-prompt.sh\nAnd start a cygwin session.. I'm not trying to be confrontational or anything but why do so many people insist on putting this in \"C:\\program files\" it's a portable piece of software it can go anywhere.\nCmder relies on several unix/linux like binaries where paths with spaces are generally not used.\nWhile paths with spaces in them are a common thing in Windows it was never a good idea.  Microsoft has even moved away from the practice where possible in newer versions of windows.\nIf it doesn't work in a specific location move it to another location.\n. History for cmder cmd.exe sessions is setup by execution of the init.bat at session start.  This probably does not happen when restoring saved sessions, therefore it is probably working as expected.  I have not confirmed this.. Clink is included in cmder and provides history if init.bat is run probably because it is supposed to be portable.  I assume installing clink with the autorun option is running clink for all executions of cmd.exewhich is not portable... The question I would have now is where is your history being saved?  In installed clink default location, in %cmder_root%\\config\\history, or one or the other depending on how the session is started.. This is not related to cmder.  This is Microsoft cmd.exe syntax.. You could do an alias.  Something like:\nalias cdd=cd /d $*\nThen:\ncdd e:\\test\nWould change to 'e:\\test'\nDo not do the below because it could bread some stuff:\nalias cd=cd /d $*\n. Use a nightly build it works from unreleased versions.. There is a link to nightly builds at the bottom if the main README.md file. \n https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/branch/master/artifacts. Do you have any errors when starting a cmder session?. @jdhao there are probably also settings required in your vim config file to allow this.  If this works in a standard cmd.exe prompt the I suggest asking the question in the conemu forum.  Conemu is the cmder terminal app and is not maintained by us.. @Jackbennet - Thats what I would do with two additional stepc depending on current version of Cmder.  Backup the ConEmu.xml before deleting the vendor folder and restore it after copying in the new Cmder stuff.  The extra two steps are not required if upgrading from version 1.3.2, the current version.. This is not anything we are doing.  Do you have a sample script?. You could customize it but you would need to redo the customization after each upgrade.  It is not designs to be user configurable.. Auto update is a component of and only updates conemu which is only part of cmder.  The rest remains at an older version.. This is more a conemu feature request not cmder.. The following is how it works.  I have not tested the exact circumstances since I am not quite sure what those are.\nCmder shell env is inherited from the cmder.exe that launched it.  If running a new cmd.exe works then running a new cmder.exe should also work.  Simply starting a new shell from an already running cmder.exe session will not work because it still has the env that was available prior to installing the new apps.. You using cmd or bash? Default shell is cmd and it probably does not like ./. This is not a Cmder issue.  Cmd.exe does not support unc paths as current directories.  You can't cd \\\\server\\path.  You need to use pushed \\\\server\\path that will temporarily map a drive to that path then change to it.\nThis is not something that can be fixed by us.. @izimbra UNC Paths are supported in cmd.exe.  You can copy files to and from them, and map drives to them.  You just cannot cd to them and a UNC path cannot be the current directrory.\nI assume you are referring to a feature in Conemu.  We are not the maintainers of Conemu we simply use it as our terminal app.  If you have issues with or questions about this feature you should ask them.\n. I am a heavy tmux user but unfortunately I have not found a version that works on Windows in cmder.. This is not a cmder issue.  Report it to conemu devs.. That is bash syntax.  Are you using git-bash or cmd shell?. Windows insider build?. Aliases worked prior to a previous Windows insider update.  Not sure about this release as I am not running it.  Cmder aliases for the cmd shell are based on the very old doskey macro functionality.  We are somewhat at the mercy of Microsoft on this one if they break doskey then I don't know what we will do.  It is probably best to wait untill an official Windows release and try then to see if they fix it.\nThe question I have is do doskey macros work in standard window cmd prompt window outside cmder with similar settings?  If not it's not a cmder issue.. I use vim daily in cmder using cmd, powershell, and git-bash shells daily with zero issues.  I don't think the issue is in cmder.\nWhat shell are you using when you have an issue?. Works for me.. No issues.. @Foxandxss the only issue with that approach is that the aliases are not portable.  Maybe not an issue for you but cmder best practice would be to put the aliases and any other shell specific config in a .cmd, \n .ps1, *.sh file in $CMDER_ROOT/config/profile.d and then you could zip up the entire cmder folder and take it all with you.. @illusive-man not sure why you pointed this at me.  I am fully aware of how it works since I wrote the profile.d code in cmder and what the issue is.\nI was just pointing out to @foxandxss the definite lack of portability in using an alias store outside the cmder folder.\nIndeed you can store aliases in config/user-profile.sh, I wrote part of that too, but putting all the config in one monolithic file can get a little messy.  You can just drop a file in profile.d whose extension matches the shell you are running and it will become a part of that shells initialization.. @illusive-man No problem.  I have like 500+ aliases makes the file a little large.. @Foxandxss If they load from ~/.bashrc and not from $CMDER_ROOT/config/user-profile.sh then I am betting the issue is not the creator update.  The Creator update issue is specifically an issue with cmd.exe doskey macros and clink a component used by cmder to provide bash like command completion and other things to cmd.exe.  I will look and see if I have the same issue and let you know. . Just confirmed it.  I am on Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.15063].\nRunning bash->bash in cmder loads aliases from both $CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh and from $CMDER_ROOT/config/profile.d/*.sh.\nOutput from brand new bash->bash with no ~/.bashrc\ndgames@DTG-WS ~\n\u03bb alias upsh\nalias upsh='echo I am an alias from the $CMDER_ROOT/config/user-profile.sh'\ndgames@DTG-WS ~\n\u03bb upsh\nI am an alias from the /c/Users/dgames/cmder/config/user-profile.sh\ndgames@DTG-WS ~\n\u03bb ls ~/.bash*\n/c/Users/dgames/.bash_history\ndgames@DTG-WS ~\n\u03bb\nThe same does not work for doskey aliases when launching cmder->cmder as expected.\n```\nC:\\Users\\dgames\n\u03bb alias cmderr\ncmderr=cd /d \"%CMDER_ROOT%\"\nC:\\Users\\dgames\n\u03bb cmderr\n'cmderr' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file.\nC:\\Users\\dgames\n\u03bb\n```. Odd.  Maybe we are on diff versions of cmder.  Also are you using Cmder's bash or windows 10 ubuntu bash?\nJust for arguments sake I commented the clink load bits from %CMDER_ROOT%/ventor/init.bat and now launching cmder->cmder aliases now work:\n```\nC:\\Users\\dgames>alias cmderr\ncmderr=cd /d \"%CMDER_ROOT%\"\nC:\\Users\\dgames>cmderr\nC:\\Users\\dgames\\cmder>\n```\nBut we lose all the niceties clink provides.\nHave you tried building cmder from source?

You may need to update powershell if you are running version 2.  I can't remember if it will build on powershell 2.  To check type $PSVersionTable inside powershell.. After looking back at your output you appear to not be running the cmder 1.3.2+ or you are not running cmder's bash, or you customized your prompt to not use cmders prompt.\nNotice the difference in the prompt:\nYou:\nfoxan@DESKTOP-G0E7BTC MINGW32 ~/Documents/Programming\n$\nMe:\ndgames@DTG-WS ~\n\u03bb. Wierd I just built from source and my prompt matches yours which means something is broken. but my aliases still work as expected.\n. Change to $CMDER_ROOT and type . vendor/git-for-windows/etc/profile.d/git-prompt.sh\nThis should make your prompt look like mine.  For come reason this is not happening automatically as it should be.\nYou could also type: . vendor/git-for-windows/etc/profile.d/cmder.sh which is the file that handles loading of stuff in $CMDER_ROOT/config and $CMDER_ROOT/config/profile.d\nI have updated mine to include some strategic echo messages to help debug the issue:\n```\nif [ -d \"${CMDER_ROOT}/config/profile.d\" ] ; then\n  unset profile_d_scripts\n  pushd \"${CMDER_ROOT}/config/profile.d\" >/dev/null\n  profile_d_scripts=$(ls *.sh 2>/dev/null)\nif [ ! \"x${profile_d_scripts}\" = \"x\" ] ; then\n    for x in ${profile_d_scripts} ; do\n      echo Sourcing \"${CMDER_ROOT}/config/profile.d/${x}\"...\n      . \"${CMDER_ROOT}/config/profile.d/${x}\"\n    done\n  fi\n  popd >/dev/null\nfi\nif [ -f \"${CMDER_ROOT}/config/user-profile.sh\" ] ; then\n    echo \"Sourcing ${CMDER_ROOT}/config/user-profile.sh\"\n    . \"${CMDER_ROOT}/config/user-profile.sh\"\nelse\n    echo Creating user startup file: \"${CMDER_ROOT}/config/user-profile.sh\"\n    cat <<-eof >\"${CMDER_ROOT}/config/user-profile.sh\"\nuse this file to run your own startup commands for msys2 bash'\nTo add a new vendor to the path, do something like:\nexport PATH=\\${CMDER_ROOT}/vendor/whatever:\\${PATH}\neof\nfi\nSource the users .bashrc file if it exists\nif [ -f \"${HOME}/.bashrc\" ] ; then\n    echo \"Sourcing ${HOME}/.bashrc\"\n    . \"${HOME}/.bashrc\"\nfi\n```\nNow when I launch bash I get the below:\nrunning git-for-windows/etc/profile.d/cmder.sh\nSourcing /c/Users/dgames/cmder/config/profile.d/user-aliases.sh...\nSourcing /c/Users/dgames/cmder/config/user-profile.sh. If you do not have the cmder.sh then there is something amiss with your cmder install.  Possibly it is old as I said earlier.\n'.' is same as 'source' in bash.  I understand you are OK with it because it works for you.  I wrote this code so if it is somehow broken for some I want to fix it so I need your help since I cannot reproduce the issue on my own.\nI just fixed the git prompt not auto-loading and will be doing a PR toy resolve the issue.. If you have a git-for-windows folder that did not come from a cmder full binary distro that that explains the issue.  We add cmder.sh and replace git-prompt.sh with our own versions during package build.  You can copy vendor/cmder.sh to the path I gave you earlier and it will fix your alias loading issue.\nYou may need to get cmder.sh from the zip I asked you to download earlier to attempt a build from source.. @Foxandxss Was my last message accurate or is there something else that needs to be foxed?. @Foxandxss I understand, I do too.  Just so you and others know, no 'revert' is required.\nWe add cmder.sh and replace git-prompt.sh with our own version during package build.  These are the only changes we make to the core git-for-windows distribution.\nYou can simply copy cmder.sh to '$CMDER_ROOT/vendor/git-for-windows/etc/profile.d/cmder.sh' and it will make profile settings load when a cmder bash session is started as designed in the following order:\n\n'$CMDER_ROOT/config/profile.d/*.sh'\n'$CMDER_ROOT/config/user-profile.sh'\n'$userprofile/.bashrc'. @thatdoorsajar the fix I posted was for that specific user complaining of aliases not working in Bash if stored in the cmder/config folder because he had deleted cmder.sh.  He was trying to fix the issue in this post and inadvertently created a completely unrelated issue.\n\nAs stated earlier aliases not loading in cmder cmd sessions are related to an issue with clink. See. https://github.com/mridgers/clink/pull/464 for the fix you are looking for.. @stanzilla when are we going to start using your clink fork to fix this?  I am using \"https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/9s1asp19s0hoq7g4/artifacts/.build%2Frelease%2F20170816_247112%2Fclink_DEV.zip\" in my sources.json and building using scripts/build.ps1 and it fixes my macros in cmder cmd sessions.. ## Cmder 1.3.11 with Clink v0.4.9\nclink set history_io 1  changes this behaviour to update the history file after every command.. @Hugo-KTM, Thanks.\nYou did part of what I asked.\nI like the change and it addresses an issue a user reported earlier but it is not complete in my mind. Can you please replace all instances of 'cd /d' with 'pushd' in 'vendor\\init.bat' to ensure this works in all situations.\nThen I will approve.. @hugo-ktm I ended up removing my changes to your code after it was merged to cmder master.  Please pull down cmdere master and verify all still work is.\nOk. Think to truly make this work the registry changes neerd tone added to cmder.exe.  I may work on that.. @AlexAkulov. Is this still an issue using current nightly builds?. Closing due to lack of response from OP.. This feature request should be submitted for  conemu not cmder.  Cmder uses conemu it is not conemu.  . Default Cmder sessions add *.lua files to the config folder.   Note: This is an advanced feature and requires knowledge of the lua language.\nBash sessions you could add code to config/user_profile.sh or add a file to config/profile.d/[filename].sh.   Note: This is an advanced feature and requires knowledge of bash language and prompt customization.\nPoweshell sessions, Im not sure this is possible with existing cmder but if it is it would be similar to the Bash but instead of .sh extensions you would use the same locations with .ps1 extension.. Put scripts in %cmder_root%\\config\\profile.d is the preferred multi shell compatible way.\nOr in %cmder_root%\\config\\user-profile.cmd, %cmder_root%\\config\\user-profile.sh, or %cmder_root%\\config\\user-profile.ps1,. @thehackercat what scripts, filenames?  If you are referring to %cmder_root%\\config\\user-profile.cmd, %cmder_root%\\config\\user-profile.sh, or %cmder_root%\\config\\user-profile.ps1.  They should be in the exact paths shown. \nIt depends entirely on the version of cmder you are running as to whether it has profile.d support.. The latest cmder releases use a new format for the alias file.  Read the docs.  Also even if you get the latest version and the alias file format to match you could still experience an issue with the latest versions of Windows breaking aliases in cmd based shells.. Sorry was busy when I replied to this, probably should have waited.  I just went to the docs myself and they are incomplete.  I will be updating them.\nI you are using a current version of cmder and upgraded from an older version that used '%CMDER_ROOT%/config/aliases' it 'should have auto-updated that 'aliases' file to the new '%CMDER_ROOT%/config/user-aliases.cmd'.  If it did not I need to know that.\nIf starting fresh with a newly downloaded cmder in a new directory then '%CMDER_ROOT%/config/user-aliases.cmd' should have been automatically created at first run.  If it did not I need to know that.\nTo fix what you have make sure you are running cmder 1.3.2, rename 'aliases' to 'user-aliases.cmd' and add the below to the top of the file:\n;= @echo off\n;= rem Call DOSKEY and use this file as the macrofile\n;= %SystemRoot%\\system32\\doskey /listsize=1000 /macrofile=%0%\n;= rem In batch mode, jump to the end of the file\n;= goto:eof\n;= Add aliases below here. Closing resolved in latest Clink/Cmder. Is this still an issue?\n. Maybe its the fact that ppk and open-ssh keys use different formats. See: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/74545/what-difference-between-openssh-key-and-putty-key. @jaysassyinfotech see my last comment on this thread.  You need to use ssh-keygen to create an ssh key.  ppk is for use with puTTY.. If you can find standalone 'rz.exe' and 'sz.exe' that do what you want and add them to '%cmder_root%/bin' then you could do this yourself.. This is not a cmder issue.. @leyafo error messages?\n%cmder_root%/bin is added to the path.  If you put the files in the path they should run. That's the best we can do with a foreign exe file.. @Hugo-KTM, I like the change and it addresses an issue a user reported earlier today but it is not complete in my mind.  Can you please replace all instances of 'cd /d' with 'pushd' to ensure this works in all situations.. @Hugo-KTM you should just combine this with #1399 and close this PR after adding the requested changes to #1399.. Sorry for the inconvenience but this is not unexpected since conemu is a self contained product that is used by cmder.  We have no control over what it does.  It does not know it is being used with the other components as a part of cmder.  Reset does exactly that, reset to conemu default that knows nothing about cmder. I know but when you loosely integrate disparate products it's unavoidable.  This is not the only situation.. Explain?  Works for me for system files and folders, what directory?\nC:\\Users\\dgames.DTG>attrib c:\\windows\\Fo[tab] --> C:\\Users\\dgames.DTG>attrib c:\\windows\\Fonts[enter]\n   S R             C:\\windows\\Fonts\nC:\\Users\\dgames.DTG>attrib ntuser[tab][tab] --> C:\\Users\\dgames.DTG>attrib ntuser.dat.LOG1[enter]\nA  SH              C:\\Users\\dgames.DTG\\ntuser.dat.LOG1. I did yes.. The unc path issue is not a cmder issue.  It is a cmd.exe issue.  May be able to work around this using pushd and popd to dynamically map a drive letter to the required unc path in %cmder_root%\\vendor\\iniit.bat.  I am not somewhere in can test it right now.\nThe update is indeed for conemu and not the whole cmder package.  I personally do not take conemu updates via this dialog and would recommend disabling it as I have had mixed results after completing the process.. PR #1456 may address this.  Asked the submitter to make a couple of changes.\n@mikeychan can you confirm if this would fix your issue?. @bitbonk look in Cmder 'Setup Tasks->Integration->Default Term->List of Hooked Executeables'.  I think if you add total commander's exe file here it may launch conemu when clicking powershell from total commander.\nIt is probably not actually doing what you want though.  Yes it is launching conemu if you launch powershell but that conemu session will not have cmder enhancemnents since the cmder powershell task is not being launched.\nSee below:\nLeft - launched powershell.exe directly, right - launched cmder powershell task\n\n. Probably not a cmder issue.  My guess is you are not running cmder's ls.exe but another from your path.  I do not think the file it is complaining about is part of cmder.\necho %path% or echo $PATH output?. You could try using this to launch cmder instead of using cmder.exe.  https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/Cmder.bat\nNote: This is not part of the cmder binary distribution and will need to be downloaded and copied into cmder manually.\nTo launch type or add to a shortcut:\nCmder.bat [path-to-user-conemu.xml]\nThere may be side effects but it is the only way that I know of.. 'pwd' is a git bash command and you are not in a git bash shell you are in a cmd shell.  'cd' will return 'F:\\Devops'.   rsync is not a part of the cmder package so what are you using to get that?  It is an gnu utility and thus would not understand Windows paths lik 'F:\\Devops'.\nTry what you are trying from a bash shell instead of the cmder default cmd shell.. I assume this helped? :-). Don't know about the \\Microsoft but 'ls' is not part of cmder mini.. The default bash task is designed to work with vendored git.  So the path is correct and required.  We can't launch a get that we have not discovered yet and so far the only Discovery we have is in the Annette. Bat for command sessions so I don't know what to say. .  why don't the users that want to use mini just edit the task to point to their own Bash. @drdavidsoft I think that all sounds great but how do intend on making this first launch magic happen?  And it does not have to be done each time under starts, just the first time.. @DRSDavidSoft  That means maintaining two different 'default' conemu.xml files.  One for cmder and one for cmder mini.  It's already a pain to maintain one copy of a change is needed.\nI think we just need to add a section to the readme.md explaining the task is there for the full cmder but can be altered or added to in the case a user has a prior installed bash shell.  I think were trying to fix something that does not need fixing but might need documenting.  Another option is another command line art for the launcher where a user can specify a git install root but I'm not real hip on the idea because as you have said there are many different bash shells that can be installed and not all Will launch exactly the same way.\nMaybe we even rename the vendored menu option to cmder bash to denote the built in nature of the censored git-for-windows.. @DRSDavidSoft. PRs are always welcome and no permission required. Just understand the only time the default conemu.xml is used or references is on initial install.  Just don't break the current handling of the conemu.xml after that initial install.  . @jods4. What error?. @jods4. You say you get this error in all shells not just a cmder shell?. Chances are this is a big in cmder.exe relying on relative paths.  I wrote the original code for this but currently have no way to fix it as I do not have a dev workstation setup with the right software.  Can anyone else look at this?. @bajax because that defeats the point of cmder being portable where all settings are saved with the app.. @bajax Cmder is not one product.  It is a collection of tools loosely glued together by some startup scripts.  What you are asking for is not possible, at least at this time without some significant re-coding of everything.\nAn alternative approach, while not exactly what you are looking for is this:\n\nInstall Git for Windows on the system for everyone to use.  This is the largest component of Cmder 234MB of 254MB cmder full extracted package.\nEach user then download a personal copy of cmder_min.zip and put it in 'c:\\users[username]\\cmder', about 10MB per user.\nIf users need Bash Cmder shells modify the Cmder tasks that launch Bash Cmder sessions to point at your globally installed 'Git for Windows'.\n\nHope this helps.. @roschacker I am not sure I understand.  Are you wanting to store cmder user config some place other than the %cmder_root%\\config folder?  Your why not question has been answered here\nThe recomendation would be to store the cmder folder in a location that is writeable by the user using it.\nIf that is not possible then cmder now has the ability to store user config anywhere based on a command line argument to cmder.exe, for example:\ncmder /c \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\cmder\"\nWill first load a shared Cmder config from %cmder_root%\\config and it will also create and use the following for user config:\n\"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\cmder\\config\\profile.d\"\n\"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\cmder\\config\"\n\"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\cmder\\config\\user_aliases.cmd\"\n\"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\cmder\\config\\user_profile.cmd\"\n\"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\cmder\\config\\user_profile.sh\"\n\"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\cmder\\config\\user_profile.ps1\"\n\"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\cmder\\bin\"\n\"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Programs\\cmder\\bin\" will also be added to the %path% variable\nHope this helps!. Just add the %userprofile%/.ssh/config file and it will be used.. ; works as a command separator in bash and power when but not in cmd.exe.  the default cmder shell is cmd.exe.  you can use & or && in cmd.exe shells.\n& = always execute the next command\n&& = only execute the next command if previous command exits with errorlevel 0. You can set cmder to launch the powershell task as the default in the setup tasks menu.. To get rid of the -> origin from a cmder session:\n\nType del  \"%cmder_root%\\vendor\\clink-completions\\git_prompt.lua\"\nStart a new session.\n\nTo make it permanent so it does not come back after a cmder update add the following to \"%cmder_root%\\config\\user-profile.cmd\":\nif exists  \"%cmder_root%\\vendor\\clink-completions\\git_prompt.lua\" del  \"%cmder_root%\\vendor\\clink-completions\\git_prompt.lua\" \n  . Kind of but not really.  Cmder adds some configuration to the /etc/profile.d folder inside git-for-windows.  To upgrade and maintain all functionality you need to add that configuration back to that location. Delete vendor/git-for-windows, Download the portable version and expand it to vendor/git-for-windows.. There is another way but it's more effort.. Can you please  this in a little more detail?. I have never seen anything like this .. The default cmder shell is cmd.exe. Mini does not even include bash.. That is cmd.exe.. Type ver in both you will get the same output that is the version of Windows.  You can also type set and it will show you the eng variables.. I don't know.  Why are you using cmder and all its benefits if all you want is cmd.exe?  You could create a task that just launched cmd.exe but you would lose all the other benefits cmder provides.. The lamda is part of clink config.  I am not a clink expert.  I could probably figure it out but don't have the time.. Same problem as before.  Not in your path.. Curl is not a part of cmder. This is a part of the daily builds already just not released in binary form.. @fabiosantoscode Curl is included with the latest cmder full but since windows has it the windows version is used by default.\n```\nwhere curl\nC:\\windows\\system32.exe\n%cmder_root%\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\mingw64\\bin\\curl.exe\n``. @otiel I hate to ask this but did you relaunch cmder after adding to your user path.  New adds/changes are not available until a relaunch.. @schlichtanders Working on it.. Done #1591. Upstream feature request. Request this from conemu.. I'm not even sure what the ask is?. Closing due to lack of response from OP.. It will be configurable 1-5 levels with a default of 1 which means no subdirectories.. Just use latest cmder 1.3.11 and register withcmder /register /single`.  Works for me to open a new tab in an existing window.. @gpakosz are you suggesting the missing code should be added back?  What do your tasks look like in the conemu config?. @gpakosz That's where I was heading.  I will look at the root drive complaint.. @jods4 Yeah remove that and it should work, I think.  @gpakosz can you post your task config for @jods4?. 32 or 64 bit? Cmder uses 64 bit git-bash. You could download and install 32bit git-bash and cmder or cmder mini with it.\n. Did you install git to  the default location?  You could try deleting. The cmder_root\\vendor\\git-for-windows folder. I like it as long as the behaviour fully is documented in readme.md  I am no it where I can test it though.. I am testing this after merge to master and it fails to find a valid git version on vendored git.  Problem appears to be here:\n:: get the git version in the provided directory\nfor /F \"delims=\" %%F in ('%git_executable% --version 2^>nul') do @(\n    set \"GIT_VERSION_%~1=%%F\"\n    call :verbose-output GIT_VERSION_%~1=%%F\n)\n\nVendored git returns a version string that is not parse by the for so no version is ever set.\nTrying to fix it in the PR I have been working on.. @DRSDavidSoft I do not use cygwin.  what is returned by git --version in cygwin?\nVendored git returns git version 2.15.0.windows.1\n. FIxed in #1665 . What is '__git_aliases'?  Is it another script that is missing?  Your .bashrc is trying to run this command and not finding it.. You may be able to replace '__git_aliases' with 'git config --get-regexp alias' and get what you expect.  This is a guess and not tested!. Yeah looking at it again more changes to that script are needed.  I bet/etc/bash_completion does not exist, at least in that exact path, and it is setting __git_aliases which itself is probably an alias.\nChange what I originally suggested back and change /etc/bash_completion to ${GIT_INSTALL_ROOT}/etc/bash_completion.  . That will not work either unless you copy that script to that path but there is probably a better way.\nYou should copy that script to \"$CMDER_ROOT/config/profile.d/bash_completion.sh\".  If there it will run every time you start bash::bash setting the appropriate aliases.  Then remove/comment the first if block from your .bashrc file.\nMaybe more but that's where I'd start.. To make it all portable you could also move the contents of your .bashrc into $CMDER_ROOT/config/user-profile.sh.  depends on whether cmder is your only bash environment.. Cmder init scripts source your .bashrc on start.. Without __git_aliases being set then the following block does nothing:\n``\nfor al in__git_aliases`; do\n    alias g$al=\"git $al\"\ncomplete_func=_git_$(__git_aliased_command $al)\nfunction_exists $complete_fnc && __git_complete g$al $complete_func\n\ndone\n```\nWhen you say you can use the git aliases what do you mean.  You can type:\ngit [alias name]\nAnd it works?  I would expect this as this is how git aliases work.  The purpose of the code in .bashrc is for translate your git aliases into bash aliases so git aliases:\ngit cm\nOr \ng cm # .bashrc sets `alias g='git'`\nThat actually runs git commit -m would become a bash alias:\ngcm\nWhat bash aliases do you get when you type alias?. ls --show-control-chars -F --color - Works for me.  Running cmder 1.3.5+. @DRSDavidSoft no . @DRSDavidSoft Sorry for the initial short reply phone keyboard issues.\nNo,  I made the 'for' block that gets the version more intelligent so it:\n\nCould deal with paths with spaces.  My cmder folder is in my 'Google Drive' folder so your code did not work because of the space.\nExtracts the semantic version from the return value of git --version and passes it to the verify function.. @DRSDavidSoft I do see something I need to fix though then I need you to test it in your system. @DRSDavidSoft Fixed what I needed to fix.  Can you please test and make sure it works for you?. @DRSDavidSoft. Yes, /v turns on verbose output.  Those are all calls to :verbose-output.  It certainly could be prettier.\n\nMainly a debugging thing to help us help people using under.\nAlthought your %cmder_root% variable is wrong.. Or maybe  after looking closer at other output.  Is cmder.exe you launched in c:\\?. Thats odd I don't see that but I have never runt it like you did.  I need to look at that.  What if you modify the task and add /v.  Look at the readme.md you will need to add additional set of \"\" around init.bat to make it work.. I'll look at it.  Not where I can look t the code right now.  The thing is if launching init.bat inside a cmder session should just take the already set cmder root and not even try to set it.  I don't know why thsts happening.. @DRSDavidSoft - I cannot duplicate the issue I saw with you manually running init.bat /v.\n@cmderdev/trusted-contributors - Please test and comment, this has some pretty cool stuff in it.. @Stanzilla Conflicts?. @Stanzilla I haven't seen that.  I just did a clean merge locally into a copy of master. Hah too late... Been working on it already.  Actually not separating them out into bin rather added. %cmder_root%\\lib\\lib_git.cmd|lib_path.cmd|lib_profile.cmd|lib_console.cmd they can be 'included in any bat|cmd file by executing call \"%cmder_root%\\lib\\lib_git.cmd|lib_path.cmd|lib_profile.cmd|lib_console.cmd\"\nAnd can be used by adding %lib_console% debug-output init.bat \"This is a debug message\"\nWhich produces output like:\n```\nDEBUG(init.bat): This is a debug message.\n```. @DRSDavidSoft Sent you email with the lib_git.cmd attached so you can contribute it.  Needs to be clmpleted but it work.  see my email.. See the 'lib-it' branch.. Hah - the unlimited depth just bit me.  gotta fix that.. @DRSDavidSoft @stanzilla - Max recurse depth added please test.\nI also have this all broken into importable libraries in my 'lib-it' branch, mostly works just working on docs.. @cmderdev/trusted-contributors I added a CHANGELOG.md entry to this PR and I called it 1.3.6-pre1 and it links to https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder and not a release.  \nEDITED: My suggestion is when we merge to master we tag it with 1.3.6-pre1 change the link in the CHANGELOG.md to point to the tag and tag each subsequent merge to master with the next -pre# until ready to 'release' and a changelog entry without the -pre[#] and link to the release when the release is built.  Hopefully that work for every one.\nI am not sure what specific issue numbers this resolves or adds so if anyone doe pleas update with a PR to my branch at least until it is merged to master.. Need to fix cmder /REGISTER|/UNREGISTER and CMDER HERE its horribly broken. @cmderdev/trusted-contributors Still testing - just found an issue where user installed git for windows breaks path.  investigating....\n. Fixed and ready to merge AFAIK - the issue mentioned above was releated to over zealous use of setlocal enabledelayedexpansion inside a for block that did not have corresponding endlocal calls and also due to the loop being broken with a goto thus even if there were enough endlocal calls it would have still failed.  Simply removed the offending extra setlocal enabledelayedexpansion to fix the issue.  @cmderdev/trusted-contributors and @DRSDavidSoft - PLEASE TEST!. @Stanzilla I will go ahead and merge it.  I assume that is what you meant by rebase?\n. @i-s-o This version of init.bat supports command line arguments.  you can add a '/d' after init.bat in the task and it enables debug mode.  Look at the readme.md for init.bat command line arguments.. @i-s-o what LF vs CRLF issue.. Thats really odd.  Is appveryor doing that?  I just downloaded the nightly and had the same issue.  If I run unix2dos vendor\\init.bat  all works fine.. @i-s-o please try the latest nightly build - init.bat should have correct line endings now.  I just downloaded and tested it ant it was fine.  Please confirm\n. @Stanzilla I see no conflicts.. @Stanzilla I am sorry and not ting to be argumentative but trying to understand.  Why would this branch show no conflicts on a merge and a squash and merge but shows conflicts on rebase and merge as you showed?\nI personally have never used rebase and merge when incorporating a PR in github so why rebase and merge vs one of the other two options.. . I screwed this up royally try to rebase - closing and trying to fix!. just run:\nC:\\Users\\user\\Documents$ clink set terminate_autoanswer 1\nSettings 'terminate_autoanswer' set to '1'. Create a shortcut.  Its a portable app.. You can add this manually to your own config by creating a new task and using -cur_console:s50H.  The number is a percentage\nRight Split:\n\nBottom Split:\n\nThen add your desired key binding to the new task.. I was not even talking about an automated changelog based on git commit messages.  Normally I say automate everything but to me automating a changelog based on git commit logs is almost meaningless  spam.\nI guess I was suggesting a human written changelog entry and version bump for each PR.  If not that's fine, just looking for more meaningful data in that file.. I can do that. In my PR so let's not merge it yet.  If we do a changelog entry and a version bump with every or then there is no changelog management at release.  Every or to master is a release.. See: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/1871. You are showing the conemu version which is a component of cmder.   The cmder version is in a file in the root dir, the current version is 1.3.5.  The only way to get the most recent version of cmder is to download the zip file and following the upgrade procedure in the README.MD\nRead the README.MD and search for 'aliases' on how to set them.. I see you went back and looked at the Readme.md.  \nConemu and cmder are not the same thing.  Conemu is a component of cmder and it's config is stored in the conemu.xml file.\nCmder config is stored in %cmder_root%\\config folder and it can include conemu config in various forms.  Again see the Readme.md\nWhen cmder.exe starts and %cmder_root%\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\conemu.xml does not exist and   %cmder_root%\\config\\user-conemu.xml does not exist %cmder_root%\\config\\conemu.xml, the default cmder specific conemu.xml file, is copied to %cmder_root%\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\conemu.xml.\nIf cmder.exe starts and %cmder_root%\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\conemu.xml does exist it is copied to %cmder_root%\\config\\user-conemu.xml.  This is done to preserve any conemu config changes your previous cmder session may have saved for future use.\nWhen cmder.exe starts and %cmder_root%\\config\\user-conemu.xml exists and  %cmder_root%\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\conemu.xml does not %cmder_root%\\config\\user-conemu.xml is copied to %cmder_root%\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\conemu.xml.\nThis is done to reapply any conemu config saved from a previous run.\nThis decision process happens each time cmder.exe is run.\n. @step Why? Is something not working?. Fixed. not fixed - probably can't fix TCC/LE that I have access to appears to be incompatible with cmd.exe despite their docs saying it is.. which ssh and post output?  You have multiple this will tell us which one is running.. @cmderdev/core @cmderdev/trusted-contributors Can we close this?. I beleive #1665 is ready to merge but would rather someone test the nightly build other than me cmder.exe args were severely broken before today in this branch.\nTo clarify the conemu.xml in config is just the default conemu config.  It is never used after the first cmder launch.  The actual file conemu uses is in the conemu folder and that file is copied to the config folder as user-conemu.xml each time cmder starts to preserve user changes to conemu config post upgrade.\nI would not count on cmder working 100%  with a non-vendored conemu, it might, but things might be missing.. I just tested all of these and the work for me.  My task:\nPowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NoProfile -NoExit -Command \"Invoke-Expression '. ''%ConEmuDir%\\..\\profile.ps1'''\"\n$PSVersionTable\nPSVersion                      5.1.16299.248. @victormongi The easiest way while not really correct would be to delete the file '%cmder-root%\\vendor\\clink-completions\\git_prompt.lua'.\nI am working on a more corrwct way to do this.. Cmder version?. @dadaa1 Cmder version?\nTry one of these\nRe-open if the issue persists.. Not sure about this one.  Need to test it and and decide.  Probably will get added just not exactly like this.  Holding off for now to let some of the dust settle.. @DRSDavidSoft Vendored Git or user installed 'Git for Windows'.  Notice the code only adds it if the folder exists.. @gucong3000 - I am adding this to my PR #1665 as it already has enhancements to how we update the path by adding this to my PR I can do it by adding 4 lines of code:\nif exist \"!GIT_INSTALL_ROOT!\\mingw32\" (\n        call :enhance_path \"!GIT_INSTALL_ROOT!\\mingw32\" append\n    ) else if exist \"!GIT_INSTALL_ROOT!\\mingw64\"\n        call :enhance_path \"!GIT_INSTALL_ROOT!\\mingw64\" append\n    )\n. @DRSDavidSoft Keep in mind users should only be putting custom config in the config folder.  And nothing in the clink.lua should matter for user config.. Why store another config file?  The entire config folder is stored config files.  You can use bat/cmd, sh, and ps1 files.  Init.bat will soon be able to take command line args and these are stored in the users conemu.xml in the config folder.\nWhat config is there to store that is not already storable in the config folder?\nI think we need to have user lua scripts and that is an easy 5-8 line mod to %cmder_root%\\vendor\\clink.lua that's have already written band was going to propose after my current PRs are merged.. @cmderdev/trusted-contributors @DRSDavidSoft - This is a new PR based on #1665 because I screwed that branch up somehow trying to rebase for @Stanzilla.  Please test the Nightly build of this commit.. Try saving this init.bat to %cmder_root%\\vendor\\init.bat. @cra0zy -  UGH....Sorry about that.  Try this build of cmder mini it is from #1696. Cool thanks.  Fixed by #1696 . \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks @alex-jitbit - Fixed see #1725 \nTry one of thes and let us know if it does what you expect: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/1.0.604-master/artifacts\n. Aliases work fine on newer Windows if it's not there is something not right with your config folder most likely.  What shell are you using?. @andyd0 What she'll?. That's because you deleted the files.  The easiest thing to tell you is out the files back where you had them and unregister the shell extension by running cmder.exe with the /UNREGISTER ALL and /UNREGISTER USER.  Confirm the shell extension is gone then delete the files if you want to.. Working on this..... Working on this..... Fixed here\nRemove /newconsole:d:* arguments from your default cmder task..

I have thought of that in the past as an option just never tried it. Might work, init.bat might need some re-work, but it should work.

A fully functional cmder cmd::cmder session in the current directory with tab completion AND your portable Cmder configs loaded.\nIf you are using cmder for the benefits it provides, Enhanced Shell using Clink and Portable user settings then I would not recommend the solution above because adding clink to the path %ConEmuBaseDir%\\clink seems to hijack cmder`s value added startup scripts in favor of a generic clink startup.  You lose all the portability of user config by doing this because Cmders init scripts are not run when using this solution.\nHowever if you REALLY want it to share files and don't care about Cmder value adds you can do the below:\nRun Cmder as Administrator:\n```\nC:\\Users\\user\n\u03bb rmdir \"%conEmuBaseDir%\\clink\" /s\nC:\\Users\\user\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\clink, Are you sure (Y/N)? y\nC:\\Users\\user\n\u03bb mklink /d \"%conEmuBaseDir%\\clink\" \"%cmder_root%\\vendor\\clink\"\nsymbolic link created for C:\\Users\\user\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\clink <<===>> C:\\Users\\user\\cmder\\vendor\\clink\nC:\\Users\\user\n\u03bb dir \"%conEmuBaseDir%\\clink\"\n Volume in drive C is Windows\n Volume Serial Number is BE6A-E4D2\nDirectory of C:\\Users\\user\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\clink\n06/03/2018  07:54 AM              .\n06/03/2018  07:54 AM              ..\n05/19/2018  04:58 PM                16 .cmderver\n05/19/2018  04:58 PM             9,172 CHANGES\n05/19/2018  04:58 PM             2,070 clink.bat\n05/19/2018  04:58 PM            55,510 clink.html\n05/19/2018  04:58 PM           111,740 clink.lua\n05/19/2018  04:58 PM           552,960 clink_dll_x64.dll\n05/19/2018  04:58 PM           538,112 clink_dll_x86.dll\n05/19/2018  04:58 PM             2,147 clink_inputrc_base\n05/19/2018  04:58 PM           136,704 clink_x64.exe\n05/19/2018  04:58 PM           122,880 clink_x86.exe\n05/19/2018  04:58 PM            35,823 LICENSE\n06/03/2018  08:00 AM              profile\n              11 File(s)      1,567,134 bytes\n               3 Dir(s)  440,839,606,272 bytes free\n```\nThis still hijacks things so I don't recommend it but it will allow you to share the clink that is a part of cmder..

It is not a bug in either app. Yeah that would work too.. @emzero Try the latest release, it works for me.. Ready to go! Tested and looks like it works to me.. This should be fixed in latest unreleased builds here. @kodos84 This is probably not anything cmder related but you might get some traction opening and issue here: \nhttps://conemu.github.io/. @xiazeyu - Yes 1.3.5 is the released version of cmder.  The master branch has unreleased changes.  Also I made a couple more small changes just to make things a little clearer.\n@cmderdev/trusted-contributors do you approve of this change?. @drsdavidsoft I don't understand the argument handling question and I don't understand the plugins comment because there is no argument handling because any unknown argument to is just passed to user-profile.cmd and there are no plugins so can you explain?. @xiazeyu  Cmder has a concept of importable libraries in vendor\\lib this is what @DRSDavidSoft was referring to when he suggested a 'lib_arguments.bat to parse the arguments'.  I like what you have done mostly.  I am hoping you can refactor your code using the files in vendor\\lib as examples.\nWe put the libraries in vendor\\lib because they should not be edited by users of cmder.  Your have method if it is to be a part of cmder should not be edited by users so it should not be in %cmder_root%\\bin.  Eventually I would even like to move the alias.bat out of %cmder_root%\\bin into a library in vendor\\lib for this same reason.\nI am not sure I like have as the method name, I am thinking flag_exists as the method that checks if a flag is set and flag_exists not could check for the absence of the flag. \nThoughts?. We just released 1.3.6.  It has a couple of issues that have already been fixed.  I think we might need to do another one sooner rather than later.. Still have not had time to look at this PR.  I need to before we merge it, something doesn't feel right about it still but I can't say for sure until I have time to really sit down,and look at it.. @stanzilla no I haven't, work has been very busy.\n@xiazeyu explain 'there's a low possibility that this new feature would go wrong after configured correctly'\n. I don't even remember reviewing it.  Last I saw the author had some concerns.  I have not really looked at it.. @DRSDavidSoft and @xiazeyu I am not sure we need to add this functionality to cmder.exe, I am not sure I understand why its needed.  The stated use case is to run init.bat /noautorun in a shell from another tool not running cmder.exe /noautorun standalone, both provide completely different results.  One starts a Cmder/Clink enhanced shell in the current shell session the other launches Conemu and starts a completely new shell session in the Conemu window.\nI have said before I am concerned with adding so much functionality to the launcher that it becomes difficult to maintain.\nI am also concerned about breaking existing functionality.\nCurrently cmder.exe accepts a start directory in the following ways:\ncmder /start c:\\start_in_this_dir\nor\ncmder c:\\start_in_this_dir\nWe can't just throw a random arg at it because it errors on unknown/invalid command line args.\nIf this functionality is added it would need to be in a way that used a prefix like /uflags \"/noautorun /dosomething /dosomethingelse\".  The value of /uflags could then be set to %CMDER_USER_FLAGS%.\nTo me the meat of this PR is the library that makes it easy for easy determination of whether a flag was passed or not.  Currently the lib does not appear to adhere to the format of our other libraries in %cmder_root%\\vendor\\lib so that is an issue I have.\nI need to look closer though and do a full test and review of the PR, if I am misunderstanding something please clarify.. I have adapted it to a cmder library and can PR back to @xiazeyu.. I changed my mind I did not make it a library.\nIn my opinion flag_exists.cmd does not adequately describe what this does.  It as actually a conditional execution based on a detected/undetected flag passed to init.bat.\nIn my PR to @xiazeyu I have:\n\nRenamed %cmder_root%/vendor/lib/flag_exists.cmd to %cmder_root%/vendor/bin/cexec.cmd\nThis makes the file easily callable by its name since %cmder_root%/vendor/bin/ is added to the path\nModified the cexec /setpath to set:\nccall=call C:\\Users\\user\\cmderdev\\vendor\\bin\\cexec.cmd Evaluates flags, runs commands if found,  and returns to the calling script and continues.\nExample: %ccall% /startnotepad start notepad.exe\n\n\ncexec=C:\\Users\\user\\cmderdev\\vendor\\bin\\cexec.cmd Evaluates flags, runs commands if found, and does not return to the calling script.\nExample: %cexec% /startnotepad start notepad.exe\n\n\nAdded exit codes to allow multi conditional execution:\nIf a flag is detected and the command is run cexec exists with an %ERRORLEVEL%=0\nIf not is specified and a flag is not detected and the command is run cexec exists with an %ERRORLEVEL%=0\nElse cexec exists with %ERRORLEVEL%=1\nExample: %ccall% \"/startNotepad\" \"start\" \"notepad.exe\" && %call% not \"/startwordpad\" \"start\" \"wordpad.exe\"\nWordpad is only started if %CMDER_USER_FLAGS% contains both /startNotepad and /startwordpad\n\n\nUpdated the documentation in the readme.md.. The only issue with the above approach is it is a manual change to the cmder task config for existing users that already have a user-conemu.xml file.  \n\nJust spit balling here but we could instead add some code to init.bat to append %* to %CMDER_ARGS% then have the command line parser parse %CMDER_ARGS% instead of %* then it would not have to be added the the cmder task in conemu.. @shevegen\nIf you really want it and are willing to try something you could do the below:\n\nDownload and install 7Zip 32Bit or 7Zip 64Bit\nDownload the Cmder Source\nUsing Git\ncd /d %USERPROFILE%\ngit clone https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder\nOR \nZip File\na. Expand the Zip file to %USERPROFILE%\\cmder-master\nb. Rename %USERPROFILE%\\cmder-master to %USERPROFILE%\\cmder\n\n\nOutside Cmder open a Powershell Session and execute the following code:\ncd \"$env:userprofile\\cmder\\scripts\"\n.\\build.ps1 -verbose\nWait for cmder to build.\nYou can just pull the latest cmder.exe, as of this post, from zip file and copy it to %USERPROFILE%\\cmder\n\nTo auto update:\n\nClose all CMDER/ConEMU sessions.\nOutside Cmder open a Powershell session and execute the following code:\ncd \"$env:userprofile\\cmder\ngit pull origin master\ncd \"scripts\"\n.\\build.ps1 -verbose\nStart your upgraded Cmder\n\nNote:  the above steps are from memory and may be incomplete. @DRSDavidSoft I like your enthusiasm but this PR has a history dating back to 2016.  I like the functionality and I think others will also but the @cmderdev/trusted-contributors had some reservations.. @vikyd cmder /register all or cmder /register user will give you a right click context menu on folder to open Cmder here.\nIf in a folder in Explorer you can type cmder in the navigation bar to open cmder in that folder.\nBoth require the latest release 1.3.6. Supporting unc paths and using them as current directories is two different things.  We cannot fix what cmd.exe does not support. @oshihirii It a feature.  The green tabs are cmder enhanced launched using the cmder tasks inside win+ctrl+t.\nThe black tabs are are probably vanilla Windows cmd.exe.  Maybe you have a vanilla Windows Cmd.exe task defined that you are launching?\nI am sorry I do not understand Cmder > New console..., what does that mean?  Is that a command you are typing?\nWhat does the dialog look like when you hit ctrl+t.  Mine looks like:\n\nIf I hit start here I always get the green icon tab.\nIf this is no longer an issue please close.. /c is an unreleased feature.  You would need to use a nightly build.

Cmder supports 3 shells, cmd(default), bash, and PowerShell.  You choose the shell from the menu when you start a session.  Choose bash then choose bash.  It is labled bash::bash in the Tasks dialog.. @half-potato Cmder is a compilation of tools to enhance the users shell environment.  It defaults to using the Windows Cmd.exe shell to try and make it more functional and make unix tools and some functionality available but some things cannot be changed like the direction of the '\\'.  Use bash in cmder it is even more unix like and uses the forward '/'.  \nKeyboard shortcuts can be remapped in ConEmu by pressing 'win+alt+t' and navigating to 'Keys & Macros'.  Exiting cmder and reopening it will backup any changes to this config for future sessions so your changes do persist between sessions and upgrades.. Thanks but I think I already fixed this in cmders nightly builds.  Making this PR unnecessary.  I need to verify that to be sure but I believe it already works as expected it has just not been released.. @alex-salas Use one if the nightly builds.  You can find a link in the readme.md. @alex-salas and @bnbdr no reason to build it yourself.  The nightly builds are packaged just like the release builds they are just not released.  There is a link at the bottom if the readme.md to the nightly builds page. @bnbdr can we close this since it is no longer necessary any longer?. Probably because this is not a cmder issue.. @ittayd Questions:\n\nI assume Powershell works outside Cmder?\nDo Cmder Cmd and Bash sessions work?\nIf 1 and 2 = Yes what are the contents of %cmder_root%\\config\\user_profile.ps1 and from Powershell the contents of the $profile file.\nAre there any *.ps1 files in %cmder_root%\\config\\profile.d\n\nYou could launch a Cmder Cmd session and run cmder_diag.cmd and post the output.  This may give us enough of a picture of your environment to help.  Make sure you look at the output and sanitize it before posting, it probably doesn't  contain anything sensitive but just make sure.. @ittayd Glad you found the issue.\nIf you do not have %cmder_root%\\config\\user_profile.ps1 you are running an older version OR Powershell never got far enough in Cmder to actually create one for you.  Now that you say it is working it should exist now.. @ittayd then something is still broken because it should self create.  The diag file did not come through.  I assume you attached it to an email.. Try a nightly build.  https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/branch/master/artifacts. Maybe because you are trying to launch as admin.\nThis works for me:\n```\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\Directory\\shell\\CmderBash]\n@=\"Cmder Bash Here\"\n\"Icon\"=\"C:\\Users\\user\\cmderdev\\icons\\cmder.ico\"\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\Directory\\shell\\CmderBash\\command]\n@=\"\\\"C:\\Users\\user\\cmderdev\\Cmder.exe\\\" /task bash::bash \\\"%V\\\"\"\n```.

Try the latest release 1.3.6. Try the latest release 1.3.6. You should not edit that file because it is replaced on updates.\nYou should instead edit ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile if not worried about portability.  If you want it portable then edit $CMDER_ROOT/config/user-profile.sh. if you are using bash in cmder then yes you can create a function the same way you would in zsh.  this is not a cmder issue so closing.. Yes . @qrzysio Move the folder to a path with no () or try the nightly builds found below.. The newest builds also fixes the issue. Fixed in #1796. Try the 1.3.6 release. I went back and looked at the code for 1.3.2 and it is identical to the code in 1.3.6 for setting up the context menu.  Something has changed in windows top break it.. What exactly is TCC and why is this a cmder issue if the scripts work in cmd.exe and cmder.\nAfter all cmd.exe is the interpreter/run env for batch files.  If it supports it so shouldn't TCC? . @collinchaffin I did not even try to research what TCC was and thought a quick question to the issue might save me some time.\nI am sorry you took my comments as abrasive which made you respond in such a way that your response was deleted.  I do not know everything and was also just trying to understand why this was an issue so it could be resolved to everyone's satisfaction.\nI work on cmder in my spare time and there is not very much of it.  I think the cmder core team is overall very responsive to issue reports and willing to help given this is a 100% volunteer effort.. @Stanzilla and @cmderdev/trusted-contributors  - The only concern I have with the changes to init.bat to add support for TCC as implemented is it will break all existing cmder users that have existing user-profile.cmd.  The fix is simple tell users to rename the config\\user-profile.cmd to user_profile.cmd but I hate making users do this.  I was actually trying to figure out how we fix it while maintaining backward compatibility and add compatibility with TCC.  \nDo we try to code a backward compatible fix or do we just note it as a breaking change in the CHANGELOG.md with instructions on how to fix and bump the version to 0.4.0.\nMy initial thought was it would have to be a code change in the cmder.exe to look for and rename the file before launching conemu so we could avoid '-' in the init.bat when doing a rename of the file.  Also if we do it for cmd.exe shells we should do it for the others as well for consistency.\nThoughts?. @Stanzilla - Working on it.. Fixed. @YenForYang I downloaded TCC/LE and installed it.  Set my comspec to ComSpec=C:\\Program Files\\JPSoft\\TCCLE14x64\\TCC.EXE and run cmder.exe with no errors like you show.\nUsing either the latest master branch or my user_lua branch.. @YenForYang did you try this build of cmder. @YenForYang  - Must be something in your config folder.. @CollinChaffin How about you?  Any issues with cmder\nBTW: Had you said TCC was 4NT I would have been more familiar with it.  I'm an old timer too!. Hmm, thats funny.. @YenForYang - That makes no sense, if it was a TCC compatibility issue with something in Cmder I would think it would fail if it was a clean cmder folder or yours? \nDo other folders in vendor have a similar effect if you copy them one at a time?. @YenForYang Well it seems to run without any errors but none of the cmder enhancements are there.. The only complaint I see from TCC/LE is:\nTCC: C:\\Users\\user\\cmderdev\\vendor\\init.bat [212]  Missing SETLOCAL\nI have fixed some stuff so debug and verbose output now works.  bit not getting my git path stuf. \nIf I push a branch can you pull it down and test it?. Branch name is tcc\nRun init.bat with \"/d /v\" args. @YenForYang - This is a problem in TCC.exe and is probably a big part of the problem:\n```\n[C:\\Program Files\\JPSoft\\TCCLE14x64]set test=c:\\\n[C:\\Program Files\\JPSoft\\TCCLE14x64]echo %test%\nc:\\\n[C:\\Program Files\\JPSoft\\TCCLE14x64]set test2=%test:\\=\\%\n[C:\\Program Files\\JPSoft\\TCCLE14x64]echo %test2%\nc:\\\\\n```\nIn cmd.exe:\n```\nC:\\Users\\user>set test=c:\\\nC:\\Users\\user>echo %test%\nc:\\\nC:\\Users\\user>set test2=%test:\\=\\%\nC:\\Users\\user>echo %test2%\nc:\\\n```\nThe Cmder init.bat and libraries make use of this pattern pretty extensively and TCC.exe does not handle it correctly.  Both shells above were outside cmder so they were completely native cmd and tcc.. I think TCC is just too different from cmd.exe to be supportable by Cmder.  Not really sure why you need cmder if TCC is everythig it claims to be on their website.\nThe main things cmder brings to cmd is:\n\nclink - readline like functionality, git aware prompt and command line completion.  As far as I can tell Clink is not compatible with TCC, since TCC crashes when clink loads, at least it does for me.\nAliases - Which are included in TCC.\n\nWhat exactly are you guys trying to get out of using TCC with Cmder?  Am I missing something?. Not fixed - probably can't fix TCC/LE that I have access to appears to be incompatible with cmd.exe despite their docs saying it is.. @YenForYang - Are you using 'far manager'?  Reason I ask is I found this:\nhttps://jpsoft.com/forums/threads/tcc-c-fails-when-run-from-third-party-terminal.5131/\nSeems to explain the mystery /c and may point the issue where it belongs vs cmder. Can you try the variable setting test I did above and see if you have the same results?. Interesting so maybe its a bug in tcc/le.  so you wanting me to download and install https://jpsoft.com/products/tcc-cmd-prompt.html?. or https://jpsoft.com/products/take-command.html?\n. I installed it and it produces the same errors as yours when I set it as comspec.\nUsing this as the task command:\ncmd.exe /k \"set comspec=\"C:\\Program Files\\JPSoft\\TCC23\\TCC.EXE\" & \"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\init.bat\" /d\"\nThe below seems to work for me with no errors, try this as your task command:\n\"C:\\Program Files\\JPSoft\\TCC23\\TCC.EXE\" /k \"\"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\init.bat\" /d\"\nThe key test is ti manually run \"vendor\\init.bat /d\" again already inside a cmder session.  if all worked correctly you should not see ad much debug output.. I would setup a separate task called TCC for the above.. Sorry I get one error using the user_lua branch:\nTCC: C:\\Users\\user\\cmderdev\\vendor\\init.bat [211]  Missing SETLOCAL\nI get no errors using the tccbranch.  Using:\n\"C:\\Program Files\\JPSoft\\TCC23\\TCC.EXE\" /s /k \" \"%ConEmuDir%..\\init.bat\" \". What do you mean 'Error received (all black and white no cmder functionality)'?  Are you talking about the git prompt not having any color?  This is expected since clink is not compatible with TCC and does not inject if comspec is TCC.exe.. Which branch are you using?. Clink provides the colored git prompt.  Since TCC and Clink are incompatible that's not going to happen: https://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/108. @YenForYang Has cmder ever worked as expected with TCC?. @YenForYang maybe more intelligible but not any more helpful.  It looks like something is adding a /c to the command line.  I have uninstalled tcc.  Is /c and valid arg for TCC?  note: even if we figure this part out it will not get you a colored git prompt. This is more of a question for conemu developers. https://conemu.github.io/. See Doskey docs . alias clls=clear $T ls -lah. It is slower but it is doing more.  It takes about 2 secs longer for 1.3.6 to launch.\nAdded echo. | time to top and bottom of init.bat in both v1.3.5 and v1.3.6.\nv1.3.5\nThe current time is: 17:12:10.26\nEnter the new time:\nThe current time is: 17:12:10.72\nEnter the new time:\nv1.3.6\nThe current time is: 17:37:09.96\nEnter the new time:\nThe current time is: 17:37:12.34\nEnter the new time:\nCan you elaborate?\n. @gunr2171 Cmder 1.3.6 init.bat is doing more when it runs so it is a little slower we already know that.  I doubt we can make it much faster without removing the additional functionality.\nYou can try this.  It has been optimized for speed a little more than the released Cmder 1.3.6 and has a built in timer.cmd to time init.bat if the /t argument is specified in the ConEmu Task that starts init.bat.\nEdit the Cmder task in this new build and add a /t to automatically time the init.bat.  See the new task command below:\ncmd.exe /k \"\"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\init.bat\" /t \"\nActual Sample Output from my system:\n```\nElapsed Time: 0:0:1.81 (1.81s total)\nC:\\Users\\user\\cmderdev\n\u03bb\n```\nYou can make it even faster by skipping git detection.  Just add /GIT_INSTALL_ROOT %ConEmuDir%\\..\\git-for-windows to the task:\nElapsed Time: 0:0:1.36 (1.36s total)\nThat is better than my own Cmder 1.3.6 time posted above:\nC:\\Users\\user\\cmderdev(diags -> origin)\u03bb timer 17:37:09.96 17:37:12.34\nElapsed Time: 0:0:2.38 (2.38s total)\nIf you want to you can also time other Cmder versions by:\nNote: The /t argument is not supported or required on older Cmder versions if you follow the directions below!\nCopy %cmder_root%\\vendor\\bin\\timer.cmd into a previous Cmder install in the following location %cmder_root%\\bin\\timer.cmd.  \nAdd the following to the top of the init.bat after @echo off:\nset cmder_init_start=%time%\nAdd the following to the bottom of the init.bat above the last exit:\nset cmder_init_end=%time%\ntimer %cmder_init_start% %cmder_init_end%. @gunr2171 Cmder Fast Mode Init takes my init times from 1.81 down to .74 seconds.. I provided the timer.cmd and instructions so there would be a common standard way to test.\nI have found in my optimizing this that startup times can vary widely from launch to launch, even on the two systems I have tested at home.  The system I mentioned above I have seen 1.74, .94, .74, .72 seconds all on fresh launches and this new code.\nThe timer may add some time because it is actually doing calculation of elapsed time but should only add a few milliseconds.  You can try just adding echo %time% to the top and bottom of vendor\\init.bat but then you are not comparing apples to apples.\nYour work PC probably has the added overhead and variability of IT department controlled AV, HIPS, and possibly some DLP software that can cause huge slow downs.  That could account for the much larger jump in time on the work PC.\nYou can keep your Git and still us Fast Init Mode by adding /git_install_root [path] on the task command line.  Note this is not Git discovery, rather you are specifying which Git install to use so it is faster than discovery.. I dont understand the issue.  Deleting the folder should be sufficient assuming you did not run 'cmder /register' . If that works I' close the issue if I were you..

I am unfamiliar with this feature and your issue does not have enough detail of the expected outcome and the failure.  I woul suggest aking your question in the Conemu Issues tracker at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues. There is a setting in the conemu settings for default task on startup.. I actually wrote the lua stuff months ago.  I've just been having fun this weekend working on stuff that's not work.. Yes. Cmder uses conemu for it's terminal window you should ask over there.. I am not a c++ dev so I can't tell you how the code should or should not be organized.  At best I hack at it until I get the result I want, so have at it.\nI'm not sure how %cmder_root% could be wrong since it is based on the exe dir of the launcher exe.  Not sure what you mean by discover and configure.\nI don't think there needs to be a check for update feature nor an auto update feature.  Its a portable app you download, expand and copy it to the dir, it's just not necessary.  This is probably the best idea of them all, while I think it's unnecessary and could be confusing since conemu already has this and it is often confused with a cmder updater users may like it.\nWhy would you add a confirmation dialog for a command line switch the user typed, isn't that confirmation enough.\nNo checkboxes, no registry settings, no more config files.  Btw what does a 'do not as me again box' do?  Is it for the proposed features like check for update? If you are storing additional config it should be in a file in %cmder_root%/config. Actually I'd like the version file to be called version and contain the version instead of version-1.3.6.675 so that when someone upgrades they don't end up with multiple version files.  A /h and a /v switch might be nice and easy to add.. @DRSDavidSoft Sorry if I was harsh.  It was a long day.  I understand your use cases and actually like the dialog mock ups.  The examples talk about the %CMDER_ROOT% variable which I still don't see how it could be wrong but I can see how the variable based on cmder.exe current path could be at odds with a previously registered context menu settings set from another path.  It could become VERY annoying though to someone like me that has multiple copies of cmder installed for testing purposes.\nMaybe I'm old school but xml is probably overkill to store a set of binary flags to save checkbox state.  Ini file would probably suffice and I would do a separate flag for each checkbox.  I prefer file storage to registry storage because at its core cmder is a portable app.  I don't even enable the context menu until someone complains its not working and I have to test/fix something.  When I'm done I disable it.\nMy biggest concern with your ideas is maintainability.  Seems like a lot to add to an otherwise simple launcher.  We barely support the launcher today because none of us are really c++ experts.  You may know it but what if you get bored with the exciting world of contributing to cmder and decide your done.. I am sorry but can you provide any ore details in english.. you can do that or edit your cmder task and add /nix_tools 2 \n\nNote: This will prefer even more *nix like tools that exist in other paths that are a part of Git for Windows.\n. I see previous versions of decide.  Were you using cmder at the time they worked for you?  What versions of cmder have you tested?. @rasoulian in cmd.exe based and git bash based shells this is already possible.\nCmder cmd.exe\nset /a sum=12+12\necho %sum%\n24\nGit Bash\nexport sum=$(expr 1 + 1)\necho $sum\n2. Don't know never seen that.. Seems to work fine for me with latest cmder.\n. @charlie3620 Do you want to run the same commands at the start of every git bash session?\nIf so do you want those commands to be portable and follow cmder wherever you download and run it?  If so and you need portable add the commands to $CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh if not portable edit $HOME/.bashrc.\nThere is not currently a way to make git bash do what you are asking for a single session.\n. 1. Create a task for what you want to do, See: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/2022#issuecomment-473572828\n2. Run: cmder /task [taskname]\n. This is a question for the conemu developer.. @CollinChaffin the last two blocks were added in order to load user lua files at the end of processing the clink.lua.  The idea is to allow users to have their own lua customization capability without having to edit the clink.lua file since it is a core piece of cmder and is subject to overwrite in update.  Changing any file inside the vendor folder is be discouraged because data low can occur in upgrad if the user forgets to backup his/her changes.\nHave you edited the clink.lua?  If so I suggest moving your edits to one or more lua files in the config folder.\nThe last two blocks are very similar and they are there to support cmder ability to have a shared config cmder_config_dir for running cmder from a shared location and also allowing  users to add their own config 'cmder_user_config_dir'.\nI did some testing and it looks like the block you commented is actually unnecessary.  Files in this folder are being loaded by clink.lua and then again by clink.exe, I think.\nI commented it and lua in the config folder is being loaded by clink directly.  So it looks like you found a bug.  I think I know how best to fix it so we maintain full functionality.  I will do that today.\nCan you point me to how you are adding power line so I can actually test the fix?\nThe ignoring lua files that begin with _ came from the block above where clink_completions modules are included.  I don't really have any issues with changing the ignore prefix, I doubt it is a widely used feature of cmder.\nIf we change the ignore prefix I suggest we change it for all cases though.\n@cmderdev/trusted-contributors any issues with this?. Also in my testing the ignore code is not working anyway so it could probably just be removed.. @CollinChaffin - Are you using cmder-powerline-prompt. @CollinChaffin I am not arguing with you, In fact I agree with you 100%.  You are not understanding my last post.  As I said earlier you found a bug, it happens, but the solution is not to just remove both code blocks.  \nThe below explains why:\nIf a user launches cmder.exe /c %CMDER_USER_CONFIG% then all the user config including lua is loaded from %CMDER_USER_CONFIG%\\config after loading %cmder_root%/config/user_profile.cmd and %cmder_root%/config/profile.d/*.cmd.  However in this case lua is not automatically loaded from %cmder_root%/config because the clink profile is set to %CMDER_USER_CONFIG%/config.  Clink itself loads lua from the clink profile folder, I am not sure if there is any specific lua code responsible for it.\nThe desired effect is load all 'shared/team' config from %cmder_root%/config and then 'user specific' config from %CMDER_USER_CONFIG%/config so teams can share a cmder config and still have user specific config.\nThe code in clink.lua should therefor be:\nif clink.get_env('CMDER_USER_CONFIG') then\n  local cmder_config_dir = clink.get_env('CMDER_ROOT')..'/config/'\n  for _,lua_module in ipairs(clink.find_files(cmder_config_dir..'*.lua')) do\n    local filename = cmder_config_dir..lua_module\n    -- use dofile instead of require because require caches loaded modules\n    -- so config reloading using Alt-Q won't reload updated modules.\n    dofile(filename)\n  end\nend\nSo that if %CMDER_USER_CONFIG% is set clink also loads config from %cmder_root%/config.\nNotice I also removed the ignore code based on your feedback.\nHopefully this makes sense.. @CollinChaffin PR #1884 submitted please test.. I have tried #1884 with and without the /c [path] argument and I am not getting duplicate prompts with cmder-powerline-prompt. @CollinChaffin Hey just curious does the powerline git aware prompt work for you?  It does not seem to for me.  EDIT:  I got it working, I had another git_prompt.lua that was breaking it.. @collinchaffin No probmem.  Thanks for the bug report.. Why not just use cmd.exe for this vs cmder.  I am not sure what you are asking is possible.. call \"%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%/cmd/start-ssh-agent.cmd\" /k exit is what current versions of cmder has in user_profile.cmd. I am sorry but I just don't understand what the issue is not what you are asking for in this issue.\nWhat does 'I want to pass files from C: to Windows Apps WSL. Is there any way to emulate terminal inside CMDER like Powershell? ' mean?. @leochien0102 The development branch has been abandoned.  Could you reprint your PR at e master branch? I believe the issue are trying to fix is already fixed in master.  Also make sure all conflicts are resolved.. Report this to conemu maintainer. This is more of a question for clink.  I have never tried this.\nI f you figure it out please post it here so others can benefit.. Cmder is a portable enhancement for cmd.exe, Powershell, and Git Bash sessions.  The main goal is to make Windows cmd.exe shells more useable/functionalfor a Linux user.  It is several tools stitched together using some init scripts.  The component that provides much of the functionality you see in cmd.exe sessions, clink, unfortunately is not compatible with tcc.  We have done every thing we can to enable tcc use with cmder but since we do not maintain clink or tcc we can't fix this incompatibility.  There are closes issues on this in the cmder issues area of you want more detail.\nYou can add tasks to launch other shells like msys2 and others I have done msys2 so I know it works and it can take advantage of cmder init script processing.  See the readme.md on integrating external shells.\nHope this helps.. @abdulbadii Does this answer your question?  If so please close the issue.  If we do not hear from you in 5 days the issue will be closed.. No response from @abdulbadii closing.. Steps to replicate?. Not sure I understand.  Please provide more detail.. Did you follow the process to upgrade in the README.md?\nBasically to answer your question the author of conemu recommends keeping the conemu.xml file in the conemu program folder so we do.\nAll 'user owned' Cmder config is supposed to live in %CMDER_ROOT%\\config all 'cmder owned' config is supposed to be in vendor.  'cmder owned' config is assumed to be over writeable on update while 'user owned' config is not touched.\nLaunching the latest cmder.exe will backup your conemu.xml in the conemu program folder to %CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\user_conemu.xml.\nIf conemu.xml in the conemu program folder does not exist launching cmder.exe will copy the %CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\user_conemu.xml to the conemu program folder as conemu.xml.  This way we backup any config changes you make via the GUI on launch so on upgrades you can just delete the entire vendor folder, copy in a new vendor folder, and run cmder.exe.  This puts back your config before starting conemu\n. @MBurchard Does the above answer your question?  If so please close this incident.. If you followed the process in the read me it was not clear that you did from your initial post.  There are two processes depending on the version of cmder you were running.\nDid you have a user-conemu.xml in the config folder?  If so simply deleting the vendor folder and copying a new cmder folder content into your under folder should have worked.  Launching cmder.exe automatically copies user-conemu.xml to where conemu expects conemu.xml to be.\nI just tested it and it worked correctly for me.. Cmder.exe is a launcher for conemu.  It starts conemu and exits.  I already explained how it works above but I will try again.  \nSettings changes via the gui are written to vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\conemu.xml.  When cmder.exe is run the next time it will backup this file to config\\user-conemu.xml preserving any settings for future use.  This assumes the cmder.exe is new enough.\nIf vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\conemu.xml and config\\user-conemu.xml both do not exist the cmder.exe will copy config\\conemu.xml to vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\conemu.xml to provide a default cmder enabled conemu config.\nIf  config\\user-conemu.xml exists and vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\conemu.xml does not exist the cmder.exe will copy will copy config\\user-conemu.xml tovendor\\conemu-maximus5\\conemu.xml putting back any previously backed up config after an update.\nconfig\\conemu.xml is used only one time on a NEW install and is never written to again.  I think the latest builds of cmder even moved this file to the vendor folder.\nHopefully this helps.\n. @mburchard did that make sense?. @mburchard thanks for the clarification.\nSome questions:\nWhere are you getting cmder, link?\nWhat is the step by step process you are using to 'upgrade'?\nWhat is the folder path cmder is installed into?\nLatest unreleased build is located here.\nFollow the exact upgrade steps for 'older' cmder versions in the readme.md.  Make sure after the upgrade you have the latest cmder.exe as this is the file that performs the described actions.. @MBurchard - One additional step:  \n\nCopy your backed up conemu.xml back into where you backed it up from THEN launch cmder.exe.\n\nYou should now have a user-conemu.xml or a user_conemu.xml file in %cmder_root%\\config, if not let me know.  I just tested this by renaming my %cmder_root%\\config\\user-conemu.xml and launching cmder.exe and it copied my conemu.xml from the conemu folder to config as user_conemu.xml.\nIts code it SHOULD do exactly the same thing on all systems unless you've got something funky going on.. @lonecloud steps to reproduce?  Have you tried latest unreleased builds?. This is now fixed in Cmder 1.3.11. The shell context menu /register||/unregister on drives will be in the next release.. It must not be in your path.  What changes?. @stnlylee and @tonybengue When you say 'installed bash on my Windows 10' I assume you mean 'wsl'? I have wsl and do not see this issue.  Have you tried the latest unreleased builds. Pull requests are welcome.. This is a conemu question.  Best to report it to the conemu developer. @vpa24 have you tried the latest unreleased builds. @wqk317 I use the commands you posted daily and have never seen this issue on several different systems.. @wqk317 Does it do this in all git repos?. Closing due to lack of response from OP. Hey there,\nMake sure you are running a current version of Cmder and understand how it handles changes to the conemu.xml file.  See PR #1949 for a long explanation or just rust me it works IF Comemu saves the setting to the Conemu.xml file.\nIf it is still an issue the Conemu is not saving the setting so Cmder can back it up.  Cmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\nThank you! :).

You can't complete arguments for doskey aliases.. You can't complete arguments for doskey aliases. Cmder completion is provided by clink completions.

Cmder.exe is a dumb launcher that does the file copy that is failing.  init.bat does all the work.\nI am not a VS Code user but many of our users are and this is how they integrate cmder, I assume for the same purpose you are trying to do.\n@drsdavidsoft can you look at this and confirm?  It does not look the same but maybe you can make some recommendations.. @SmGG I am not sure if the below would work but it looks to me like this might achieve what you want ASSUMING it is valid:\nNote: Substitute [cmder_root] with your Cmder installation directory.\n\"terminal.external.windowsExec\": \"cmd.exe\",\n\"terminal.external.windowsExecArgs\": [\n      \"/k\", \"[cmder_root]\\\\vendor\\\\init.bat\"\n],. @PSLLSP See PR #1988. It works for me.  Two different drives on 2 different systems:\n\n. @fnzr Did you possibly map the drive as another windows user id or even as an admin user?  I have seen this behavior before but it should also happen with cmd.exe outside Cmder.. Admin level user and regular user are two different security levels.  drives mapped as admin are not accessible by non-admin users.  This is a windows thing.. @glucas Thank you.

Adding one more thing:\n\nIf %CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu.xml exists in the shared install and there is no current user config in [path]\\config\\user_conemu.xml\ncopy %CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu.xml to [path]\\config\\user_conemu.xml\nuse it to launch ConEmu.\n\n\n\nThis allows all new users to have a shared starting point for ConEmu config that they can then modify without access to modify the shared config. . @collinchaffin if you want each user to have their own init scripts, aliases, and history you would create a shortcut like:\nd:\\programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe /c d:\\programs\\cmder\\config_user\\%username%\nCmder.exewill create %cmder_root%\\config_user\\%username% and use the d:\\Programs\\CMDer\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\conemu.xml as a starting point for user specific %cmder_root%\\config_user\\%username%\\config\\user_conemu.xml.\nIf a user wants computer specific config they can copy their %cmder_root%\\config_user\\%username%\\config\\user_conemu.xml to \n%cmder_root%\\config_user\\%username%\\config\\conemu-%computername%.xml and restart Cmder.exe. @Collinchaffin users will have total control of their personal config, history, and conemu settings with no conflicts.. Just added /m command line switch.  It handles auto creating conemu-%computername%.xml if it does not already exist.  If the file already exists the switch has no effect and the machine specific config will be used instead of user_conemu.xml as it does today.. /register now recognizes /c [path] and creates a shell extension that uses /c [path]:\nRunning the below inside Cmder:\ncmder /register /c \"%cmder_root%\\config_user\\%username%\"\nCreates this shell extension:\n```\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\Directory\\Background\\shell\\Cmder]\n@=\"Cmder Here\"\n\"NoWorkingDirectory\"=\"\"\n\"Icon\"=\"C:\\Users\\dtgam\\cmderdev\\launcher\\Debug\\icons\\cmder.ico\"\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\Directory\\Background\\shell\\Cmder\\command]\n@=\"\\\"C:\\Users\\dtgam\\cmderdev\\launcher\\Debug\\Cmder.exe\\\" /c \\\"C:\\Users\\dtgam\\cmderdev\\config_user\\dtgam\\\" \\\"%V\\\"\"\n```. @CollinChaffin \nEDIT: You asked for thoughts and I had so many I could not type them all on my phone last night before heading to bed.  So here they are!\nYour use case is VERY specific and I can't see changing/breaking features that are already in the wild, and have been for some time, so drastically to suit it.  Specific features I am speaking of are:\n\n/c [path] - #1696 Merged 3/13/2018\nUse of %cmder_root%\\config\\conemu-%computername%.xml simply because it exists. - #427 Merged 12/4/2015\n\nFirst an explanation of the original features:\n\n\n/c [path] - Designed to separate Cmder 'user' configuration config and scripts bin folders from the Cmder binaries to provide a sort of shared install capability. This was partially successful see the long diatribe above.  Note: This was a huge departure from Cmders 'Portable` app roots based on user feedback through incidents and feature requests. PR #1696 by @daxgames :-)\n\n\n%cmder_root%\\config\\conemu-%computername%.xml.  _Note: This was a based on a user PR #427 by @kodybrown.  I'd rather the filename be user-%computername%-conemu.xml but I digress! :-)\n\n\nGoals:\n\nA single user wanted to share a single copy of Cmder and run it with different ConEmu config on different machines.\n\n\nFunctionality\nUser must to log into a copy of Cmder stored in the cloud and manually copy %cmder_root%\\config\\user_conemu.xml  %cmder_root%\\config\\conemu-%computername%.xml\nGoing forward %cmder_root%\\config\\conemu-%computername%.xml will be used on that machine simply because it exists.\n\n\n\nFeature Enhancements in this PR\n\n\n/c [path] Again see above.\n\n\n/m - Initially create ConEmu-%computername%.xml so the user does not have to copy it manually.\n\n\nGoals:\n\nMaintain existing behavior of  %cmder_root%\\config\\conemu-%computername%.xml will be used on that machine simply because it exists.\nAuto create %cmder_root%\\config\\conemu-%computername%.xml based on a command line switch if the user desires machine specific config for ConEmu.\n\n\n\nFunctionality:\n\nUser A runs cmder.exe /m on machine A and  ConEmu-A.xml will be created and used to start ConEmu.exe.\n\n\n\nHow this affects your use case\nA user can create a shortcut with whatever /C [path] and icon he wants so you could do ALMOST exactly what you suggested using the code that is already written without breaking existing functionality.  \nThe exception being the BONUS SCENARIO.  If conemu-%computername%.xml exists wherever the users config is stored, /c [path] or not, it WILL be used.\nUsage as designed\nCmder.exe will create the /c [path] exactly as provided, Windows will resolve environment variables, and inside it will be a config and a bin folder to store and use the separated Cmder config:\n\nInit scripts(user_profile.*, user_aliases.*, profile.d/*.*) depending on shell run.\nClink Config - (.hitory, and *.lua) if using cmd.exe or compatible shell.\nConEmu config(conemu-%computername%.xml if it exists or user_conemu.xml)\n\nSo you could have a shortcut that is both Computer and User specific as shown below:\nU:\\programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe /c U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\%computername%-%username%\nIf using scenarios similar to above would produce:\n```\nMachine #1: TESTPC1\nUser #1: TESTUSER\nCommandline: U:\\programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe /c U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\%COMPUTERNAME%-%USERNAME%\nCMDer Init: U:\\programs\\cmder\\config\\user_profile.cmd\nCMDer Profile.d: U:\\programs\\cmder\\config\\profile.d*.cmd\nCMDer Host/User Lua: U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC1-TESTUSER\\config*.lua\nCMDer Host/User Init: U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC1-TESTUSER\\config\\user_profile.cmd\nCMDer Host/User Profile.d: U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC1-TESTUSER\\config\\profile.d*.cmd\nConEmu config: U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC1-TESTUSER\\config\\user_conemu.xml\nClink History: U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC1-TESTUSER\\config.history\nMachine #2: TESTPC2\nUser #2: TESTUSER\nCommandline: U:\\programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe /c U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\%COMPUTERNAME%-%USERNAME%\nCMDer Init: U:\\programs\\cmder\\config\\user_profile.cmd\nCMDer Profile.d: U:\\programs\\cmder\\config\\profile.d*.cmd\nCMDer Host/User Lua: U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC2-TESTUSER\\config*.lua\nCMDer Host/User Init: U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC2-TESTUSER\\config\\user_profile.cmd\nCMDer Host/User Profile.d: U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC2-TESTUSER\\config\\profile.d*.cmd\nConEmu config: U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC2-TESTUSER\\config\\user-conemu.xml\nClink History: U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC2-TESTUSER\\config.history\nMachine #1: TESTPC3\nUser #1: TESTUSER\nCommandline: U:\\programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe\nCMDer Init: U:\\programs\\cmder\\config\\user_profile.cmd\nCMDer Profile.d: U:\\programs\\cmder\\config\\profile.d*.cmd\nConEmu config: U:\\programs\\cmder\\config\\user_conemu.xml (If conemu-TESTPC3.xml exists it will be used - Required for backward compatibility)\nClink History: U:\\programs\\cmder\\config.history\n```\nResponses to your statements:\n\nBONUS SCENARIO\n\n\nThis probably will not happen because you can achieve it with existing /c [path functionality and without some feedback from the larger community because it breaks pre-existing functionality. @kodybrown See above; This suggestion affects you, maybe others this feature has been around since 12/2015.\n\n\nLater logon to Machine #1 using same Windows profile, same USERID, but now with a different CMDer icon with /m vs /c, does this support it?\n\n\nYou create the shortcuts, there are multiple icon colors, you can create whatever shortcuts with whatever command line and icon you want.\n\n\n'as you can see it is simply run with a different USER-based config (desired result)'\n\n\n/c [path] does this except the user_ConEmu.xml is BOTH Machine and User specific based on the /c U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\%COMPUTERNAME%-%USERNAME% that was passed on the command line.`\n\n\nConemu now can store all data history/etc.\n\n\nConEmu does not store history in the Cmder config folder, Clink does you just happen to be using Clink with ConEmu via Cmder. :-)\n\n\nThe big missing piece here causing collisions has always been the FOLDER used for all the different components.\n\n\nAs detailed at length above /c [path] creates a separated Cmder config root folder that can be:\n User specific - U:\\programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe /c U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\%USERNAME%\n Computer Specific - U:\\programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe /c U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\%COMPUTERNAME%\n User and Computer Specific - U:\\programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe /c U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\%COMPUTERNAME%-%USERNAME%\n None of the above, separated but hard coded - U:\\programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe /c U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\Collin's_Config\n\n\nThe same userid that ran earlier on this machine using MACHINE-specific /m hits UP-ARROW after using a totally different USER config, but still has his/her .history file THAT SHOULD ALWAYS be tied to what that USER is doing ON THAT MACHINE but considered different when moving machines (with new profile use)\n\n\nI am confused as to what you are referring to USER-specific and MACHINE-specific configs.  I understand you are talking about the ConEmu config but isn't EVERYTHING in U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\%COMPUTERNAME%-%USERNAME% both USER AND COMPUTER specific config based on the command line passed to cmder.exe.\nIn my opinion the pieces of config that should be tied to unique users, possibly on unique machines, are init scripts, aliases, and history because of what they can contain.  Preferably securing the folder using a file system permissions and/or 'config' drive mapping model that would prevent one user from accessing another users config.\nExample: Credentials(Bad practice I know but it is user config and we can't control what they put there.)\nI may be wrong in this but it sounds like you have a ConEmu.xml config that you like that is different from everyone else's and that is what you are trying to maintain.  Your ability to run your config when you want to?  If that is the case you can do that to.  See above.\n``. @CollinChaffin Cool, I too thought it was a pretty complete solution after reworking it.   Working with you and your use case helped me to see where the previous/c` functionality was lacking.\n\nIts funny, it has taken more time and text to explain hw what it can do works than it took to make the actual modifications to the code!\nPlease just let us know if you run into any issues so we can get this peer reviewed and merged.  I will release 1.3.9 shortly after.. @CollinChaffin - Answers/Responses\n\n\nThis is the default Clink Settings file it is located where the --profile [path] puts the Clink profile, in your case it is the /c [path] folder.  There is only one Clink profile and only one Settings file that gets processed so the shared Clink settings are ignored when using /c [path], this is out of our control because we do not maintain Clink.  You might be able to use your shared user_profile.cmd to copy down the shared Settings file and *.lua to each user config folder on initial run, not sure how that would work though since Clink runs before the user_profile.cmd.\n\n\nThe functionality should first process the shared user_profile.ps1 then the profile.d\\*.ps1 folder then the user user_profile.ps1 then the user profile.d\\*.ps1 folder so something is not right.\n\n\nI noticed in the Powershell profile.ps1 it is doing:\nforeach ($x in Get-ChildItem *.ps1) {\n      # write-host write-host Sourcing $x\n      Import-Module $x\n    }\nThis is wrong and was done 3 months ago via a PR.  The code that I know worked because I wrote it used to be:\nforeach ($x in Get-ChildItem *.ps1) {\n      # write-host write-host Sourcing $x\n      . $x\n    }\nI will be fixing it.  Its already written and will be added to this PR:\nNote: you can un-comment the write-host line to confirm these are being sourced.\nFixed code:\n```\n    foreach ($x in Get-ChildItem *.psm1) {\n      # write-host write-host Sourcing $x\n      Import-Module $x\n    }\nforeach ($x in Get-ChildItem *.ps1) {\n  # write-host write-host Sourcing $x\n  . $x\n}\n\n```\n\nExpected behavior.  This is designed to source the shared scripts from where they are on the shared media and not to copy them into into the user config.  That's the point of a central shared install, not to mention its difficult to maintain updates if every user gets a copy of the shared files the first time they run Cmder and never get updates again.  If they are processed correctly in the shared location any update an admin makes will apply to all users the next time anyone starts a Cmder session.\n\nIf you want to copy them down you have a user_profile.* in the shared config folder but if all is working properly they should be processed from the shared config location.  If you take that approach I recommend you move the files out of the shared profile.d to avoid processing the files twice.  We will be leaving them where they are and not copying them to each user config folder.\nAlso, as a secondary, I have not gone through all of the new code...\n\nNo if using /c [path] the shared user_profile.* and profile.d\\* is processed first then the user path of the same files are processed.  As I said earlier Clink Settings and *.lua come ONLY from the /c [path].\n\nAnd lastly ...\n\nNone that I see, but I have spent a lot of time fixing things I didn't expect to see - :-). @CollinChaffin - Fixed profile.ps1 not properly sourcing *.ps1 files:\n\nTested as follows:\nCreated config\\user_aliases.ps1 . sourced from config\\user_profile.ps1:\n```\nnew-alias ssh $env:cmder_root\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\usr\\bin\\ssh.exe -erroraction silentlycontinue\nfunction va {\n  vi \"$ENV:CMDER_ROOT\\config\\user-aliases.ps1\"\n}\nfunction gs {\n  git status\n}\nfunction ga($git_args) {\n  if ([string]::IsNullorEmpty($git_args)) {\n    $git_args = \".\"\n  } else {\n    $git_args = $args -join ' '\n  }\ngit add $git_args\n}\n```\nCreated config\\profile.d\\user_aliases.ps1:\nfunction cmderr {\n  cd $ENV:CMDER_ROOT\n}\nLaunched new sessions with and without /c [path] all aliases/functions work.. The files created in the user config folder are initial vanilla defaults that do very little.  Above I recommended if you want every user to have the same profile.d scripts to not duplicate them in both profile.d folders.\nUsers still need their own user_profile. and user_aliases. so they can add their own config customization after the shared profile runs.\nEDIT: \nClink Settings is in the Clink profile folder.  I just reconfirmed and was initially wrong about where lua runs.\nLua does indeed run first from shared config folder then the profiles config folder.  Your env var assumption is correct.  Profile config overrides shared config.. @CollinChaffin We good to go on this one?  I know all has been positive so far but wanted to check since you have used this more than anyone.. @Stanzilla you want to look at this before it's merged?  I was going to merge it and release 1.3.9.  I'd like to start releasing more frequently rather than waiting months.. @CollinChaffin - Merged and Released.. @TinaAreadyLose does @Malcn suggestion help you?  if so please close this issue.. See #1956 Issue poster suggests a solution.. For the second issue:\nCmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\nThank you! :). This is resolved by the current release.  You can re-open if not.. Then use '/'.  This is not a Cmder issue.  The *nix commands are a part of Git for Windows.  \\ in *nix is an escape character so this is expected behavior.. Hey there,\nCmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\nThank you! :). A better approach to fixing this would be to add a file called dollar_prompt.lua to %cmder_root%\\config\\\n```\nfunction my_prompt_filter()\n    cwd = clink.get_cwd()\n    prompt = \"\\x1b[1;32;40m{cwd}{git}{hg}\\x1b[1;30;40m{lamb} \\x1b[0m\"\n    new_value = string.gsub(prompt, \"{cwd}\", cwd)\n    clink.prompt.value = string.gsub(new_value, \"{lamb}\", \"$\")\nend\nclink.prompt.register_filter(my_prompt_filter, 1)\n```\nThis will survive upgrades where other suggested solutions will not.. Hey there,\nCmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\nThank you! :). Some say prefer my pre-installed Git some say prefer Cmder Git.  We can't have it both ways.  The assumption made by Cmder is if you installed Git you want to use that Git.\nIf that is not the case you can modify your Cmder task in the conemu gui and add /git_install_root [CMDER_ROOT]\\vendor\\git-for-windowsand it will use it and skip Git detection.  . @rjvdboon PRs are always welcome.  Even with your fix though if cmder detects a git that does not behave correctly the problem could still occur.  so it is possible you would still need to add /git_install_root [path] to avoid using git detection. . What dies that mean?  What is the issue?. I still don't understand.  Cmder git IS Git bash for Windows.. Don't use tcc.exe as %comspec%. @DanielChesters Nice catch! Looking forward to the PR.  Probably should do that for any use of find in any Cmder *.cmd in the vendor folder.. @DanielChesters Thanks for the PR!. There is a powerline lua that works with cmder.   cmder-powerline-prompt\nNot sure it does exactly what you want but it does support git repo status.. I am also a heavy mac user and use item2 and polarized.  I have not been able to successfully duplicate solarized color scheme in cmder that I am happy with.. I just uncommented:\n:: uncomment this next two lines to use pageant as the ssh authentication agent\nSET SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/.ssh-pageant-auth-sock\ncall \"%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%/cmd/start-ssh-pageant.cmd\"\nand got the below in my next session:\n```\nStarting ssh-pageant...\nSSH_AUTH_SOCK='/tmp/.ssh-pageant-auth-sock'\nSSH_PAGEANT_PID=18156\nC:\\Users\\user\\cmderdev(master -> origin)$\n```\nAll is working as expected.. @tomasorti maybe your user-profile is from an older version of Cmder.  The commands I uncommented ore different than yours.. @tomasorti Have a look at #1807 and #1781.  From what I saw #1781 was best.\n. @tomasorti - Just a little more info.\n%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%/cmd/start-ssh-agent.cmd is provided by the Git for Windows Package that Cmder uses.  It is not maintained by us and thus can't be fixed by us.. Did you upgrade from a previous version?  Press Win+Alt+t and change the command line in the {cmd::Cmder} task to:\ncmd /k \"\"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\init.bat\" \"\n. @gwarnants the /start [path] switch works for me.. Cmder used to force %userprofile%.  We don't do that any more .  That piece of config is written by us exactly one time, when you install/run cmder the first time.  Then we never touch it again.  You had the cmder 1.3.1 default task list.\nGlad it's working now.. Cmder used to force %userprofile%.  We don't do that any more .  That piece of config is written by us exactly one time, when you install/run cmder the first time.  Then we never touch it again.  You had the cmder 1.3.1 default task list.\nGlad it's working now.. @sql-sith I have not seen this behavior.. @sql-sith So you are running a Powershell session in Cmder and have created a Powershell alias/function called dir to run the cmd.exe internal command dir?\n\nHow did you do that?  function dir() {cmd /c dir $args}\n\nThis is what I get:\n```\nC:\\Users\\user\n\u03bb  del alias:dir\nC:\\Users\\user\n\u03bb  function dir() {cmd /c dir $args}\nC:\\Users\\user\n\u03bb  dir \".\\Dropbox\\jdbc\\Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server\\sqljdbc_6.0\\enu\\xa\\x86\"\n Volume in drive C is Windows\n Volume Serial Number is BE6A-E4D2\nDirectory of C:\\Users\\user\\Dropbox\\jdbc\\Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server\\sqljdbc_6.0\\enu\\xa\\x86\n03/16/2019  06:06 PM              .\n03/16/2019  06:06 PM              ..\n09/16/2018  04:36 PM             3,117 git_prompt.lua\n               1 File(s)          3,117 bytes\n               2 Dir(s)  362,287,190,016 bytes free\nC:\\Users\\user\n\u03bb   cat .\\test.ps1\nparam (\n     [string]\n     $Config = $null\n)\n\"Config = $Config\"\nC:\\Users\\user\n\u03bb\n```\nSeems to work for me.. It is a very unique problem and it did try the switch away and back and had no issues like you reported.. @camohub Cmder uses Git for Windows Portable 64Bit.  Does the same issue occur outside Cmder with this software.\nIf so this is not a Cmder issue and should be reported to that team.. @jjen I don't understand your issue.. @jahusa02 Cmder supports multiple shells.  You are using the cmd.exe shell.  Have you tried the bash shell?. @rjvdboon Thanks for the PR.. @CIPop Can you post any error messages?  The install is pretty simple, unzip, done!. I am rolling back this release, no idea what happened.. Found the issue, testing the fix, will re-release soon as 1.3.10.. @CIPop for the issue you experienced, no.  Cmder v1.3.9 had some enhancements that contained a bug that prevented Cmder default Conemu config from being applied before starting Conemu, completely my fault because I wrote it and did not test that exact scenario.  That is the only reason I could respond and fix it so quickly.\nThere are, however, some scripts in %cmder_root%\\vendor\\bin that can provide us some visibility into the environment users are using Cmder in to help debug issues.\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user 197609 1053 Nov  4 09:48 vendor/bin/cmder_diag.cmd\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user 197609 1380 Nov  4 09:48 vendor/bin/cmder_diag.ps1\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user 197609 1031 Nov  4 09:48 vendor/bin/cmder_diag.sh\nCould you please confirm v1.3.10 resolves your issue and close this issue?. 10 seconds is a long time.  This was an initial start so it takes longer than others because of the one time run so setup Git for Windows.  Startup time varies based on underlying hardware and installed software(Antivirus, Malware, DLP).\nMy not exactly state of the art system(~8 years old):\nSystem Manufacturer:       Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.\nProcessor(s):              Intel(R)_Core(TM)_i7-2600K_CPU_@_3.40GHz\nTotal Physical Memory:     16,268 MB\nHard Disk:                 400GB SSD\nSee my below start times measured by adding /t to cmd::cmder task\n```\nElapsed Time: 0:0:3.32 (3.32s total)\nC:\\Users\\dtgam\\cmderdev(master -> origin)\u03bb\n```\nand the same system with /t /f added to cmd::cmder\n```\nElapsed Time: 0:0:1.30 (1.30s total)\nC:\\Users\\dtgam\\cmderdev(master -> origin)\u03bb\n```\nThere is the /f sswitch that diisables some features but the bottom line is it takes the time it takes everyone's system is different.  Other than your system being slower, maybe its older, maybe you have some very intensive anti-virus/malware/DLP software installed I don't see a problem here that we can fix.. @hellobbq 4s is still a long time with /f, e3-1230, 16GB, and ssd hdd. I would think you'd be on par or better than me given your CPU is for a server and of similar age as mine.. @lonelykid 1.6s is about right for /f.\nBasically init.bat sets up the path, injects clink, conflgures user aliases, and runs user init scripts.  All the things that make cmder.  \nIf you reset you are running straight conemu and have lost all the Cder enhancments.. @anekenonso I would say how you close a program running in a cmder terminal is independent of cmder. Can you provide an example of why you think this is a cmder relevant question.  . @Anekenonso What is Ctrl+Alt+A it is not a default key binding in Cmder.  I still do not see how this is Cmder relevant and is app specific.. I am trying to help and I do understand what you are asking.\nWhat I am saying is it depends on the app you are wanting to close and what is required by that app to be closed.   There is no 'universal close the running app' key sequence.\nIf you are running a console command or script ctrl+c generally works but I don't know what app you are trying to close and even if I did I may not know the keystroke to close it if one even exists.. If you would normally expect Ctrl+Alt+A to close this app it is possible Conemu, a component of Cmder, is intercepting it.\nConEmu documentation on key bindings and defaults are found here.  Note these are probably different than the Cmder default key bindings, also look here for docs on how to change key bindings in Conemu.\nSince this is not a Cmder feature request and I believe I have answered your question could you please close this issue?. I understand.  I am working on a switch to /prefer_nix that adds *nix commands to the front of the path vs. the default of adding to the end of the path.  This is how Cmder used to setup the path and users have requested *nix tool preference.\nFWIW you can do this today with existing conditional call features in Cmder and init.bat:  \n\nClone a Conemu Cmder task, call it Cmder No Unix Tools\nAdd /no_nix to the command line.\nCreate a %cmder_root%\\bin\\no_nix.bat file with:\n\nset path=%PATH:C:\\Users\\user\\cmderdev\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\usr\\bin;=%\n\n\nEdit %cmder_root%\\config\\user_profile.cmd and add.\n%ccall% /no_nix no_nix. @patstew A clarification.  I just want to make sure your change works with mine before merging.. \ud83d\udc4d LGTM - Thanks for the changes.. @Stanzilla - You want to look.  I tested it and it works.. In my testing not even cmd.exe shells outside cmder have the user path configured.  Cmder inherits the path from explorer as does cmd.exe.  This is not a cmder issue.. What configuration?  There are several types.  How are you verifying configuration is not saved?  If Conemu config see #1949 for a good explanation of how it's config is handled.\n. Try this.  \n\n\nChange the setting and save it.\n\nExit cmder but do not restart it.\nCheck the file for the saved change.\n\nIf the change is not there this is not a Cmder issue and you should report it to the conemu author because conemu is not saving the setting.. LGTM \ud83d\udc4d @haroldhues Thanks for the PR!. @eparizzi what you are seeing is cmder debug output normally enabled using the init.bat /d command.  What command is being run in vscode config?. Vscode is feeding in an argument that init.bat is seeing as a '/d'  See the references PR fir a workaroind. @kamenminkov you are experiencing exactly as I thought but explained poorly. @haroldhues Thanks and I don't know why we didn't do all of this a long time ago.\nHave you looked at the cmder.exe /c [path] argument.  It allows running Cmder from a central location using config from the central location then applying user unique config from [path] on top of that.  Any change to the central location automatically applies to any user the next time they run it with no need to copy config to the users workstation.  See: PR #1949 for a detailed explanation.. @cmderdev/trusted-contributors Can anyone verify this works as stated and does not break anything.. @b0bh00d How about you?  Can you confirm this works as expected?. XP is not supported.. Cmder is not running on your remote host.  It is not responsible for the color of the remote host prompt.\nCmder uses conemu as its terminal emulator.  You should try doing a similar action with default conemu that is not cmder enhanced.\nMy guess is the problem is with conemu or one of its settings.  Issues should be reported to conemu team.. Can this be closed?. I don't understand the screenshots.\nWhat version of cmder?\nDid you update cmder recently?  If so what was the old version?\nIf running the latest you can type cmder_diag.cmd and post the output to give us some insight into your config.. I still do not understand the issue based on your description.  What does 'Cmder was started with 'use' all aliases and after start, they are unavailable' mean?\nI don't see any obvious issues in the cmder_diag output.\nThe latest cmder uses a different file format to store aliases than what your previous version used.  I believe it was 1.3.2?  When an old version is seen it is converted to the new version. Maybe something went wrong in this conversion?. Nope.  Can you share the contents of '%cmder_root%\\config\\user_aliases.cmd?. @Grupa-Leonardo you have not responded.  Do you still need help with this or can I close it.. Closing due to lack of response from OP.. I don't see any issue.  This is normal behavior for a first time launch.  All user configuration is in%cmder_root%\\config.  There is a separateuser_profile.[cmd|ps1|sh]` for each shell type that gets created at initial launch of the shell.\nHope this helps and welcome!. Don't know what to tell you other than what I just said.  ls lists what is in the current folder and that is what is in the cmder folder after you unzip it.\nWhat are you expecting to see that you are not?. I'm afraid I can't help you with that.  You would do it the same way you would with any other terminal.. This is a limitation of doskey macros which is how cmder cmd shell aliases work.  If you want true alias functionality use the bash shell.. Add /d /v to the cmder task that you are launching to see where it hangs and post the output.. Closing due to lack of response from OP.. Check your antivirus quarantine.. Closing due to lack of response. Cmder version?  The screenshot appears to be an old version.. @auirarrazaval I just tested and did not see this issue.  The file that is executing and erroring in your screenshot is not a part of Cmder or was edited after cmder was installed.  It looks like your Powershell profile might be being dot sourced from this file.  Make sure the path to the sourced profile is wrapped in quotes.  I would look at %cmder_root%\\config\\user_profile.ps1\nAlso I still contend your screenshot does not match the current version powershell task settings of cmder.  Below is how my Powershell task is configured:\nPowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NoProfile -NoExit -Command \"Invoke-Expression '. ''%ConEmuDir%\\..\\profile.ps1'''\". @auirarrazaval  I just looked again at your screenshot and the task is the problem.  It is sourcing the profile and is unquoted.. Can someone that uses SVN confirm this does not break anything?. I use Nerdtree all the time in vim in cmd and bash sessions with cmder.  I think I have also used it with wsl in cmder and not had any issues but I need to verify that.. I'm betting it's a font issue. Not familiar with oh my posh, need more detail than 'It doesn't work'.. @riverscn can you try this pre-release and confirm if it helps?. Thanks, fix coming soon.. Why would you want to?  Have you thought about using your SSH config file to create aliases for hosts. Oh it's definitely possible there are just better ways to do it . they are virtually the same for me:\n\n. If I add /f to cmd::Cmder task1.3.11is actually 1 second faster than1.3.6. @speedysparrow it's all In the [README.md](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/README.md#changing-cmder-default-cmdexe-shell-startup-behaviour-using-task-arguments). You can also do a/t` and it will give you an exact time it takes to start.  How long does it take?. That is still crazy slow even with /f. @speedysparrow do you have an antivirus/antimalware you can disable and try again.  These could be slowing it down.  If they are you might be able to exclude cmder from on access scans and get it back to full speed.\nJust curious what hardware you running this on, processor, hdd type, and memory?. Those times can't be right the fastest says it took 15+ minutes to start. @speedysparrow I personally know others with corporate laptops that have the similar complaints.  Sorry not anything we can do about that.. Works for me:\n\n. I think it's a difference between the default conemu settings and the default cmder settings.   I spent hours the other night trying to find the magic combination.  Never did find it.  If I use Cmder with default conemu settings all seems well.. @tomasorti That is certainly an option.  There are others as well.  \nYou could reset the config in the conemu gui to conemu default.  You may need to then re-add the cmder tasks.  Restart the entire session an verify if behaviour is what you'd expect.\nI am not able to test this at the moment or I would.. I just confirmed the approach I suggested above works to restore snap behavior seen in default ConEmu.  It is not Cmder init scripts or other components.  It is just some 'magical' combination of ConEmu settings that are defined as a part of Cmders default ConEmu.xml. See Cmder 1.3.11 vs. ConEmu Default Settings. Do you have this issue running straight cmd.exe in conemu?  Have you tried other shells in cmder like Bash or Powershell?  They might be faster, if they are it might be an issue with, Clink, the cmd.exe shell enhancement package we use.\nI'm afraid what you are asking is beyond the scope of the Cmder team.  Cmder is a curated set of packages tied together with some scripts and configuration to provide an enhanced shell env for Windows users wanting a more Linux like experience.  Perhaps the macros you ask for could be added to, Conemu, the terminal emulator we use.. @zonky2 Can you clarify?  Is this an issue you are having or a feaqture request?. @zonky2 when I click Create New Console, I assume that is what you meant.\nI get exactly that, one tab with one new console.\n. History is maintained by clink.  The history command is a doskey macro.  Output of doskey macros cannot be used with a |.  If you want to grep the history use:\ncat %cmder_root%\\config.history | grep [pattern]. My answer to you remains the same but I will try to clarify.  History is maintained by clink which we did not write nor do we maintain it.  If you have questions about clink and how it works with history please ask the clink developer.. ## Cmder 1.3.11 with Clink v0.4.9\nclink set history_io 1  changes this behaviour to update the history file after every command.. How to reproduce this?  I have never seen this issue.. Did you find a solution? . Python is not a part of Git for Windows, a component of Cmder.  you might be able to make it work if you add a folder that contains it to the path.. Make sure Ctrl+c is not set to copy text in:\n\n. Save\nOpen at Start. A batch file that runs one then the other:\nCmder_notepad.bat\nCmder.exe\nNotepad.exe. Was not trying to be 'smart'.  What you ask is not possible, cmder is not a shell cmd.exe is.  I simply answered your question with less detail than you wanted.. You may be able to create a task in cmder that does this and then point to that task via a cmder command line arg, but you cannot do this with cmder.exe alone.  If anyone knows this I do, I am one of the maintainers of this repo.\nI am however on a phone at the moment trying to answer your questions.. Cool, Now that you have a task you can:\nCmder /task [task_name]. Time to upgrade.  Also you may want to put your script in '%cmder_root%\\config` and call it from there.. @goodandrewsoft Make sure you follow the instructions in the readme.md file before upgrading.  To ensure you don't lose any config.. Your first example works the same for me in both Cmder and Powershell:\n\nand so does the second:\n\nWhat is the content of the $profile file?  I do not have a $profile  maybe something in yours is making Powershell outside Cmder behave differently?. We are the same.  No $PROFILE default cmder settings. I will verify that by downloading a fresh copy and trying again.. Confirmed my exact same results with fresh default Cmder 1.3.11 version. Both Cmder Powershell and Powershell work and fail in exactly the same ways.. I was able to duplicate your failed results launching powershell .\\test.ps1 -Config \"A B C\" from both Cmd::Cmder the default Cmder session type and Windows Cmd.exe Prompt so this is not a Cmder issue.. As you can see in my last it's not just cmder but also cmd.exe so it's not a cmder issue.. Cool will look when I get home.. @lonelykid and did you do that by editing the %cmder_root%\\vendor\\clink.lua?\nIf so a better way is here. @sqrt Sorry but I am unaware of what config changes you are referring to.  We have not in any recent changes required any user changes to update.\nThere should be no need for a user to manually migrate configuration assuming you follow some simple rules:\n\nNEVER change anything in the %cmder_root%\\vendor folder.\nKeep all user config stored in %cmder_root%\\config and %cmder_root%\\bin\nUpgrade using these instructions. Note: These need to be updated to say \"[cmder_root]/config/user[-|_]conemu.xml\"\n\nAny time we have changed a config file name/location/format/content we have written in automation to handle that change for the user.  Cmder should see that changes are required and do all required changes for you on first run after upgrading.  If this is not the case can you please provide a detailed example of where this did not work for you.\n. README.md updated #2041. @sqrt was the above helpful?. Closing due to lack of response from OP.. @SCLeoX have you tried:\nCreate %cmder_root%\\config\\my_prompt.lua:\n```\nfunction my_prompt_filter()\n    cwd = clink.get_cwd()\n    prompt = \"\\x1b[1;32;40m{cwd}{git}{hg}{svn}\\x1b[1;30;40m{lamb} \\x1b[0m\"\n    new_value = string.gsub(prompt, \"{cwd}\", cwd)\n    clink.prompt.value = string.gsub(new_value, \"{lamb}\", \"$\")\nend\nclink.prompt.register_filter(my_prompt_filter, 1)\n```\nRestart cmder.. Did the prompt change to a $?. It is definitely Clink.  I can not reproduce the issue with Cmder without Clink(Left) but can reproduce it with Cmder with Clink(Right): \n\nhttps://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/514. @RAB815 updating the way you did requires an additional step.\nCopy \"%cmder_root%/vendor/cmder.sh\" \"%cmder_root%/vendor/git-for-windows/etc/profile.d/cmder.sh\"\nIf %cmder_root%/vendor/cmder.sh does not exist, and it probably doesn't, download it here. If you installed that it is what is being used.  Verify feom inside cmder cmd session with:\nwhere git\necho %git_install_root%%\nCopy the file I suggested to the same folder in the Windows installed path.. Does the same thing happen running wsl outside cmder?  What about running wsl in native conemu?. @maksiik Then it's not cmder.. I assume the alias works on it's own?\nCmder uses doskey to provide basic macro/alias functionality to cmd.exe shells.  The issue you describe is a limitation of doskey and is not something that can be fixed.. @hurani If you want true alias support the use a bash shell with cmder.. @shane-moore Details?  Mine opens in 1-4 seconds max, something else on your machine is probably causing this. \nCorporate PC or home?  Anti-Virus/Malware can be an issue.\nHave you tried all cmder shell types cmd, bash, and powershell?\n. What version of Cmder.  I just opened cmd.exe changed to the Cmder folder and ran vendor\\init.bat.  All works as expected.. @happy-sadan have you tried the latest release?\n. I don't see how that's possible its portable software it should work on any windows system the same way for everyone.\nDo you have an environment variable called cmder_root set outside Cmder in Windows?\nOpen cmd.exe and type set cmder if anything comes back set each to nothing like:\nset cmder_root=\nset cmder[whatever]=\nThen change to path you expanded Cmder to and type vendor\\init.bat.\nIf the above works delete the environment variables from Windows.  If you don't know how Google setting environment variables windows 10.\n. Glad its working FWIW the space in the path shouldn't matter I use it that way every day.. Have a look at #1807 and #1781. or call \"%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%/cmd/start-ssh-agent.cmd\" /k exit is what current versions of cmder has in user_profile.cmd. Single quotes cannot be used in cmd.exe sessions.. git commit -m \"Double quotes\". Open a pr with clink completions on github.  This is not a cmder issue.. cmder [path]. I guess my post is irrelevant.  Was not aware of what hyper.js was but this is how to open cmder in a path.. @Eldair I installed Hyper and can't find a way to do what you ask.  This is not really a Cmder issue, probably best to ask the Hyper developers.  If you get a solution please let us know here.. @chenfd99 Did you see my post and question?  . We do not maintain the code that does our autocompletion.  You could add this by contributing to clink-completions. The default cmder shell is cmd.exe and there is no direct equivalent to using & in linux.  You could lookat this.\nYou can launch a cmder bash shell and you use the & character to background a process. @NBardelot I assume this can be closed then?. Yes.  The build.ps1 puts it where it needs to be whenrunning a bash shell.\nI ignore it in packing to avoid confusion of having the same file in two \nplaces, vendor/cmder.sh is not used when running cmder.\nOn November 10, 2015 3:20:06 AM Martin Kemp notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n\n@@ -16,3 +16,4 @@ icons\\icon_256.png\n Cmder.bat\n vendor\\tmp\n appveyor.yml\n+vendor\\cmder.sh\n\nAre you sure this should be ignored?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/702/files#r44384444\n.

I don't understand your comment.  'add-cmderplugin.ps1' should be a part of the core cmder.  It could be updated separately if necessary by simply copying the file and utils.ps1 from the source repo into an installed binary release.\n. Rename what 'add-cmderplugin.ps1'? To what?  I think it is already pretty self explanatory what it is.\n\nOr are you talking about the aliases file to user-aliases.doskey or something like that.  I think I suggested that in another post.\n. That could be added I guess.  Right now it complains if the directory is already there and prompts the user to use the '-replace' argument to force replacement of an existing plugin and then exits.\n. Yes it is.\n. That is probably an artifact from my starting point on adding plugin support.  I started with cmder_root\\scripts\\build.ps1 and modified it to do what I wanted it to do.  That is actually an error and has no function at this time.  I should probably remove the default.\n.

Is it better to use xterm? I changed mine in to xterm in init.bat and it works. \nJust don't know if all linux distributions have xterm or is linux a generic one that works with all of them?\n. Just ran into this issue. Trying to get one portable dev toolset to use across XP, Vista, and 7. Also PHP 5.5 needs msvcr110.dll instead of msvcr120.dll which comes with cmder. Gonna check and see if it's as simple as dropping the additional 110 versions of the dlls in there but thought I'd mention it. \nWill this need to have a separate launcher for XP or are you guys working on one that will work for all? I wish I could help but I don't know much about C++ and the Win API or creating launchers either.\n. Nice :-)  As for the PHP issue I mentioned, dropping the correct dll into my vendor/php directory does fix that problem so  it's non cmder issue.\n. Just tried it too. Working great. Thank you!\n. I had this issue after upgrade because I only copied over files manually so as not to overwrite any of my own custom settings, aliases, etc. The problem was I was missing   cmder/config/prompt.lua because I had not copied it over.\nBTW is there a better way to stay up to date than manually copy/pasting  without over writing customized files?\n. Yep manually creating the aliases works\nart=php artisan $* \ng:mig=php artisan generate:migration $*\ng:con=php artisan generate:controller $*\ng:mod=php artisan generate:model $*\nvssh=ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 2222\nI had trouble but the following seems to work to create the alias\nalias foo=php artisan $*\ncreates in aliases file\nfoo=php artisan $*\nThough strangely it appended it to the end of the line for the last alias so I still had to manually put a line break in there\n....\nvssh=ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 2222foo=php artisan $*\nNot a big deal to me to just manually put all my aliases in the file but that's just me :-)\nUPDATE:\nActually it was probably because of my manually creating aliases and had deleted the extra new line last time I made one. The alias command seems to put a new line in after creating the alias so it works the next time I create one using the alias command\n. Got it worked out. First I upgraded to the latest version because I noticed some differences in the init.bat file but I don't think that was the problem. \nI noticed echoing path that 7zip and gnuwin32 were getting the numbers cut off but I think that's because numbers in variable names don't work. They're fine in the path a variable points to, just not in the variable name it's self.\nHere is my new setup which is working fine. I did have to move %PATH% to the end though so windows 'find' would not be used.\n:: Enhance Path\n@set zip_bin=%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\7zip\\App\\7-Zip64\n@set gnuwin_bin=%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\GnuWin32\\bin\n@set git_install_root=%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\msysgit\n@set PATH=%CMDER_ROOT%\\bin;%git_install_root%\\bin;%git_install_root%\\mingw\\bin;%git_install_root%\\cmd;%git_install_root%\\share\\vim\\vim73;%zip_bin%;%gnuwin_bin%;%PATH%;\n. Shouldn't cmd.exe be the default because it is always installed and in working order on all windows systems? \nAdded the policy bypass flag and then get error because I need to install posh-git module. Very frustrating to be forced into using powershell instead of simply giving instructions for those who want to use powershell.\nHow do I change this default task to use cmd.exe?\nUpdate: found how to change it in the release notes https://github.com/bliker/cmder/releases\nAlso I see it is labeled as \"The powershell release\" So I will try to embrace powershell and if it doesn't work out, go back to the 1.1.4 release. \n. After installing the redist package I found the dll inside windows/system32 and just copied it to the root of cmder installation. Then uninstalled the redist package. Tried downloading the dll from dll-files.com but it didn't work so may be corrupt. This official dll works though.\nI think this is what needs to be included so users can stay portable and not need to install another runtime package. The only problem I see is that the x86 and 64 version of the dll has the same file name so you can't just put both of them in the cmder root. Thanks a lot MS.\nI actually had to remove a bunch of different vcc redist and visual studio versions that had built up over time where I had to install them to get node, python, and various other things working. Then recently had issues where all these different versions were causing issues so had to remove all and install 2013 version. I don't want to have to install another version and end up with issues with other programs.\n. @babhishek21 Yes in theory that should work. My system used to look just like yours from 2005 up to 2013 because over time I had installed them all. Then one day I updated npm and node and the new node-gyp package could not compile native npm packages. Many others had the same issue and the solution was to remove all the old ones and then install visual studio 2013 express. I have no idea what the actual issue was or why that fixed it but that is the working solution many people had to do. \nBut back to the topic of this issue, we should not need to install any of this because it kills the portability of cmder. Other dlls have been included with cmder to make it work without needing to install anything else so hopefully this dll will be included. \n. ",

Alias.bat has changed, it is no longer the three lines presented here, and has adopted a minimal validation against empty arguments or malformed alias names. Though making no arguments print your aliases is probably a good idea for people used to bash. Could you update/pull the latest changes and see if it fixes things?\n. A safer option might be: screen-16color, or similar.\n. As far as I know, terminfo describes a terminal to correct your colour output, terminal size, handling of keys, and various pitfalls from legacy hardware. That's why using the wrong one can potentially create strange behaviour. It seems xterm suits cmder fine, though. Reading the files and what they describe of your terminal, however, isn't something I've done. So how xterm differs from 'linux' terminfo entry isn't known to me.\nIf you want, however, you can test by changing your terminfo (listed in /usr/share/terminfo/ in alphabetized folders) and starting a curses or ncurses program. (Such as weechat-curses) and seeing what happens, just to see that it has an effect.\n. Modifying it to use Pathext to search even further sounds like a lovely enhancement, just making users aware of pathext is a good thing! Anyone working on such a script?\n. You can escape it with ^!^!, this problem seems to stem from clink, but I couldn't find any configuration options for it to halt history expansion. There's some options to explore, configuration files for clink, or cmder, but until then ^ escape is your friend.\n. No problem. If you want something closer to Linux you can try cygwin and such with bash or other shells (can't remember if sh or zsh is available.). Implementing \\ would not be a good idea in a cmd consistent environment.\n. using dir, or dir/w if you don't like lists, fixes this, temporarily.\nI have to add though, this is probably something cmder can't fix without altering the ls port.\n. There's no immediate plans of cmd supporting UTF-8, according to windows 10 dev feedback, but as far as I could tell, there's possible UTF-16 will be at some point, meanwhile, avoid programs that do not respect the encoding of cmd.\n. ConEmu actively blocks Ansicon, you can not run it from ConEmu. This might be circumvented in various ways, but it is not necesarry. It should also only display the error once at startup, if it displays every time you write something, there's probably something else wrong. Is this the case?\n. ",

Yep, my version is 1703, i have the same promblem too :( Thats too bad and this problem makes me want to back to win7 :p. the same Linux way \nJust copy all yours Linux vimrc contents into C:\\Users\\\\Vim_vimrc\nThen inside vim run:\nPlugInstall\nPS: screenshot of cmder/vim on Windows 10\nhttp://imgur.com/wXI2k7s. You can use Gvim through Cmder.\nI installed Gvim and Cmder. Then I copied my vimrc to _vimrc, installed all plugins through vim-plug(PlugInstall).\nTo open Gvim through Cmder just type: vim\nPS: Keep all those codes from _vimrc above then copy all vimrc commands to it! \nMy vimrc: https://github.com/vegangaro/dotfiles/blob/master/linux/vimrc\nPS2: I made some conditions as: if has ('wind32') \n... \nendif. Altough its easier having two vimrc (.vimrc & _vimrc)\n. @Mystiflow Thanks, that was bugging me. So if I reinstall clink will the repeating message come back or now that I have the proper settings file can I control this?. I found this a lua error, but I know nothing of lua, is there anyone can solve it?\nPS: I use cmder in Chinese env. I don't think so, I've always used semicolons in Linux to chain my commands, I also did it with cmder on my old computer, and I never have faced this issue before. . Maybe you struggle to find it because I said it was a Linux computer ;)\nWell I don't know, at work on a windows computer, I can use them, but I didn't use powershell. Maybe it was set in this way ? the opposite thing happens with the surface : I bought it with windows 10 on it and I instantly downloaded cmder, and this issue happened. . Me too, but I can't at home with my surface, that's my point !\n64 bits, windows 10 (I'm not at home I can't provide the exact version sorry), and I use cmder without any custom settings, I don't know if it emulates a windows console, I'm not very experienced in that, I just use it ! . That's helpful, thank you !\nDo you know if there's a way to set power shell as the cmder's shell ? . Thank you ! . thank you, it works now.\nAlbeit all commands run extremly slow. i.e. git status, git branch etc.. ",

In the traditional cmd with clink, there are two git look-ups run in clink.lua to refresh the prompt:\n\nget_git_branch  - fast, reads .git/HEAD\nget_git_status - slow, git status which is used to decide about dirty/clean colourisation. In the whole git repo of Boost, this one takes annoyingly long time.\n\nSo, instead of disabling git information in the prompt completely, some may prefer to just get rid of the detailed/coloured status, keeping the current branch info:\n```\n\u03bb diff -Nua c:\\apps\\cmder_mini\\vendor\\clink.lua.original c:\\apps\\cmder_mini\\vendor\\clink.lua\n--- c:\\apps\\cmder_mini\\vendor\\clink.lua.original        2018-04-09 09:54:20.468732700 +0200\n+++ c:\\apps\\cmder_mini\\vendor\\clink.lua 2018-04-10 08:39:57.809013700 +0200\n@@ -263,11 +263,12 @@\n         local color\n         if branch then\n             -- Has branch => therefore it is a git folder, now figure out status\n-            if get_git_status() then\n-                color = colors.clean\n-            else\n-                color = colors.dirty\n-            end\n+            -- XXX: Disable git status due to lag in large repo\n+            -- if get_git_status() then\n+                 color = colors.clean\n+            -- else\n+            --     color = colors.dirty\n+            -- end\n         clink.prompt.value = string.gsub(clink.prompt.value, \"{git}\", color..\"(\"..branch..\")\")\n         return false\n\n```\nKudos to https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/447#issuecomment-244149494 for inspiration.. @DGalt Try this\n\nedit vendor\\profile.ps1\nfind this bit\n[ScriptBlock]$CmderPrompt = {\n    $Host.UI.RawUI.ForegroundColor = \"White\"\n    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\\Write-Host $pwd.ProviderPath -NoNewLine -ForegroundColor Green\n    checkGit($pwd.ProviderPath)\n}\nremove checkGit($pwd.ProviderPath)\nsave and relaunch cmder. Yes, that snippet above needs refinement.

Is this issue exclusively related to {Powershell} vs {Cmd}? (I can't tell from the OP's report).\nI've configured tasks for the WSL Ubuntu and Debian (both installed the new way via Windows Store), launching:\ncmd /c \"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\\ubuntu.exe\"\ncmd /c \"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\\debian.exe\"\nand experiencing exactly the same problem as OP describes.. @Jackbennett ~Do you mean a workaround would be to run something like clink \"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\\ubuntu.exe\" as cmder task?~\nInterestingly, if a task launches WSL via cmd /c \"C:\\windows\\system32\\bash.exe ~\", the history scrolling works as expected.\nTo summary:\n\nC:\\windows\\system32\\bash.exe - history works (legacy command has been deprecated and replaced with wsl.exe)\nC:\\windows\\system32\\wsl.exe - history scrolling with arrows does not work\n%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\\ubuntu.exe - history does not work either (it's the new WSL distro launcher)\n\nThis https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/111 seems to related.\nFinally, after upgrading Cmder from 1.32 (161206 stable) to 1.35 (180206 preview), arrow keys can now scroll history for %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\\ubuntu.exe.\n. For those confused or lazy ones who still look for instructions\n\n\nDownload the latest ConEmu pack (eg. ConEmuPack.180626.7z) from https://www.fosshub.com/ConEmu.html\n\n\nLaunch cmd.exe\n\n\nRemove the current ConEmu but without ConEmu.xml config file.  For example, if Cmder lives in c:\\apps\\cmder_mini:\n\n\ncd c:\\apps\\cmder_mini\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\nc:\\apps\\cmder_mini\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5> ls -1\nConEmu\nConEmu.exe\nConEmu.map\nConEmu.xml\nConEmu64.exe\nConEmu64.map\nplugins\nc:\\apps\\cmder_mini\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5> rm -rf ConEmu ConEmu.exe ConEmu.map ConEmu64.exe ConEmu64.map plugins\nc:\\apps\\cmder_mini\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5>ls -1\nConEmu.xml\n\n\nUnpack ConEmu pack into c:\\apps\\cmder_mini\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\n\n\nLaunch Cmder\n. @seanofw For the clink.lua, I've just posted another workaround here https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/447#issuecomment-379992066. \n\n",

    "Jackbennett": "The execution policy get-executionPolicy -List is something you've go to set yourself to unrestricted for random scripts from the internet to run. Personally I think best thing you can do is explain it in an FAQ and accept it's just going to be a blocker to using powershell by default (sadly).\nSetting the policy to remoteSigned is what a user of powershell will(should) be running with, they'd have to cd cmder project folder and run ls *.ps1 -recurse | unblock-file to release the scripts. The policy unrestricted would not require this. That's why package managers seem to say to that in step one.\nsee: get-help unblock-file -ShowWindow\nsee: ls *.ps1 -recurse | unblock-file -Whatif\nI could go on but I fear I'm already coming off as patronising. \n. Just using the powershell console you get all kinds of tab completion and history search. I've got monokai applied to the ISE but I don't know how to do it to the console. \n. @chodorowicz Ah sorry, I tested mine inside the $profile.currentUserAllHosts file for powershell. \n. This is because you pin the conemu exe not the init script that starts conemu with the right config. I think someone would have to make a protable launcher exe to pin because I don't think you can pin just a .lnk\nright click the pin, right click the exe and at the end of the target line append /loadcfgfile \"path:\\to\\cmder\\config\\conemu.xml\"\nI've tried to look but I have no idea if you can apply the conemu.xml contents to the registry key conemu checks HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\ConEmu\\.Vanilla so it just hits this by default\nI think if you could write the .reg equivalent to conemu.xml and import it so \nHKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\ConEmu\\cmder then edit your EXE target and append /config cmder or just overwrite everything in vanilla with it. might not be best practice really. I'd expect that to break on updates.\n. I'm going to sound like a broken record but powershell will do that. \n. Just to point out for the unaware, set-executionPolicy unrestricted is basically passwd -d root\nIf you can, just drop to unrestricted for scripts you are aware of and trust. Leaving it set remotesigned is pretty safe. \n. worth mentioning - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chocolatey/a8WdEoF-M58\n. I didn't think it was right to change this in the pull request but to set this as default you'd right click on the cmder title bar, settings for ConEmu, startup and change the {cmd} box to say {AdminPowerShell}\n. That's interesting. I get the popup on windows 8. I dial UAC down 1 notch from default to stop it going to secure desktop. (second from bottom)\n. If you use the powershell(3.0+ i think) console you can stick this in your profile to add the paths at the start of each console. But this is is only going to add each subdir. If you want to scan the path for subdirs fir /bin or .exe the I guess copy/modify our one that scans for .git that's here\npowershell\n$env:path.insert(0, ((ls ($env:CMDER_ROOT+'\\bin') -Directory).fullname -join ';') + ';')\nor, create a symbolic link to the exe in that bin folder but you need admin permissions for that.. The latest w10 can symlink without admin rights otherwise Yeh it's a good\nway.\nOn 22 Dec 2016 8:00 p.m., \"Gruber\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nInteresting thank you!

I'll talk profiles here as it's only tangentially related to #136 and this. \nThere's 4 profiles that exist in powershell [$profile][1] is the current host but also;\n$profile.AllUsersAllHosts\n$profile.AllUsersCurrentHost\n$profile.CurrentUserAllHosts\n$profile.CurrentUserCurrentHost\nSo this hosts thing is cool; if you run each of those commands they refer to a filename at a path. If you run $profile.CurrentUserCurrentHost from the console you get something like C:\\Users\\j\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 and from the ISE I get C:\\Users\\j\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Microsoft.PowerShellISE_profile.ps1 (note shellISE_ in the filename)\nSo I wonder if Cmder or Conemu can set its own host identiy to use like \\Cmder.PowerShell_profile.ps1  so we don't have to worry about overwriting an existing profile.\nOr just append our stuff to $profile.CurrentUserAllHosts on init. \nIf you run powershell.exe /? there's a [-PSConsoleFile][2] to load custom snapins and maybe something else but that's real .NET developer land I think. I know not of those parts.\n[1]:http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.10.windowspowershell.aspx Profiles\n[2]:http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/Section/Extending-Windows-Powershell-with-Snap-ins.id-320555.html Custom Snapins\n. Run powershell.exe and cd into cmder/scripts and get-help .\\build.ps1 -full should tell you plenty.\n. or use get-help .\\build.ps1 -detailed would be a more appropriate amount of output. \n. Just tested @Piscean stepps from the current dev channel clone and build. Works as expected and the text color stays at # 3\n. Consolidating on #136 if there's any progress. Doesn't seem to be a great answer to the execution Policy no matter what. \n. Should be right-click on it for properties and unblock file\n. page-up / down is scrolling up/down through my commands history just like up/down arrows do.\nI think that's right from the descriptions provided. Re-open if this is incorrect please.\n. The font you've set in the cmd window doesn't have a lambda symbol. You'll have to either use a different symbol or font with it in.\n. You can double tap the c in ctrl-c to break the process to really exit instead of pressing Y\nDoesn't doing that give you similar weird behavior? If not maybe conEmu is not handling the interactive message quite right?\n. clink and cmder have moved on a lot I can't seem to reproduce this.\nI tried serving a node static server and closing it with ctrl-c once stops it as expected. \n. Can you still select and highlight text to copy? Not being able to mouse click on your line to type is default behavior it shouldn't be too shocking. \n. Whilst I like the project and to help I pretty much live in powershell land and the focus for this project isn't in that direction. (I don't think)\nThink I best stick to lurking. \n. There's now a config/user-startup.cmd file created for this purpose as well as the already available powershell $profile areas to use. Should be available from the 1.3 release onwards.\n. I can't see a conEmu setting so this would be something to request with that project, which we may or may not turn on by default. \nUse @MartiUK suggestion (pipe to more) which is more robust as its not specific to an application setting.\nthiscommandproducesmanylines.exe | more\n. Why would you say no to an action you just wanted it to do?\n. Just downloaded the fresh mini version to try. \nNew console as admin, hit no. You get that message the new console can't be created because you denied the permissions and are returned to the original console that was open. \nThat's working as intended. It looks like an intimidating warning but it's just debug info really. line 2 This operation was cancelled by user is all it would Need to say to be a friendly message. \nWould you want cmder to open a new non-administrator console anyway after being denied opening an elevated tab?\n- If you have 1 tab\n- Restart as admin\n- Say NO to UAC. Conemu in cmder with enter a detached state. As it has close the normal use console and failed to open another console. \nIf you now choose restart or as admin it will crash cmder as there's no console to try to restart. Restart... and un-ticking as administrator along the bottom will return you to an intented state.\nII imagine most users always open new tabs as opposed to restarting existing ones. \nI'd definitely call it a UX problem on ConEmu's part putting those menu options a mis-click away. \n.

Now is fixed tested as of 1.3-pre. the bat PR fix could have landed sooner I'm not sure specifically what it was.\nalias art=php artisan works fine.\n. Shift + R-click offers \"Open Command Window Here\" That's from windows itself. If you configure conEmu to be the default terminal I believe that should open in a fresh conemu instance as you describe.\nRegister the cmder hook with cmder.exe /REGISTER ALL to see \"Cmder Here\" in the nomral R-click context menu.\nI believe that was your problem.\n. Is this the same with the output from dir as it is ls\nI'm wondering if it's clink being weird. If the above is different could you try right-click in the tab bar new console and choose the powershell one just to see if it has the same ls font behaviour.\n. commit 997bd5c24... has pulled in ls=ls --show-control-chars -F --color $* so I'm closing this fixed.\n.

You'd need our init scripts and whatever they require then just use the same task we've defined. I'm not sure what you'd gain by doing it separately though. . Tested this with a downloaded mini 1.3.2\n@cmderdev/trusted-contributors CMD task chokes on this, powershell is fine. will somebody who knows more than I on batch scripting fix this or add the wontfix label and close if it can't be done.\ninstalled path: C:\\temp\\cmder&mini\\Cmder.exe\n```cmd\n'C:\\temp\\cmder' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file.\nThe system cannot find the path specified.\nC:\\Users\\jbennett>%CMDER_ROOT%\n'C:\\temp\\cmder' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file.\n'mini' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file.\n``. The tasks have been changed a few times since this, please re-open if it still persists.. Hopefully the newer tools included will fix this as we update cmder dependencies.\n. Pretty sureInstall-Module PSReadLineonly works because you have the WMF5.0 preview installed. It only works on my W10 box here. Even then I get some date parse error from the package. Early days yet but live in hope :)\n. We can probably just register to that menu at the same time we register the folder r-click handler I'm sure.\n. All the shortcuts in win+X are hereC:\\Users\\jbennett\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WinX`\nThey have registry entries here for some reason HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\ShellCompatibility\\InboxApp\nYou can't add your own shortcut here as windows check the hash of these files before displaying them on the start menu. Same goes for just targeting an existing one.\nSomeone needs to find out how to add new hashes to this wherever the check list is because cmder won't be disabling the hash checking as described here to add new items. I personally won't be disabling that myself ever.\nI suspect if anyone does disable the hash checking you should disable windows defender or whatever it's called from scanning that file. Just like when editing your hosts file windows my try changing it back in future.\n. And the answer would be described here though it looks like Rafael Rivera redesigned the blog and I can't find any of this information anymore.\nWe could probably just do this directly instead of having to pull in hashlink for what I assume is a rarely used command.\n. I don't know why this is still getting traction,\nTo round off the discussion;\n\nCmder is a separate program, not cmd.exe and will not replace it.\nCmder by default wraps cmd.exe so replacing cmd.exe is a terrible idea.\nCmder wraps ConEmu that glues everything together. Hence the icon shenanigans.\nThere's some extra shortcuts in win+X that could exist but it's more invasive that we choose to be with cmder so it won't get added.\n\n2.5 years I think we'll put this one to bed. Make new issues for things other than the topic of \"Setting Cmder as default term opens ConEmu instead\"\nThank you @Maximus5 and everyone you're very patient.. @MartiUK I just tried 1.3.2 with cmder.exe /SINGLE N: and it just focuses the already open cmder with a new tab and doesn't change to the N drive. For clarity cmder.exe n: opened a new tab at n:. I think progress is focused the most in #420. Yeh you just need to grab the smaller 'mini' download that doesn't bundle git\n. Needs testing again with a new version, I've seen some change mentioning utf8 support but I can't find what commit that was.. For future people, The reason that worked is $() to powershell means a subexpression, basically \"process this repl first and put the output here\". Think of it as a whole new powershell.exe for that one line. It's different to () which would just run a single statement first like you would using in math equations. \nJust a fancy way of running one command and using that output for the next command with copy/paste or a variable. Which you need when you can't pipe things.. Sounds cool, would you mind chucking in a screenshot too please?\n. I guess nobody knew :(. I just checked this out. Works nice and doesn't enable quake mode by default which is probably for the best. We should add it. \nI've had some trouble with quake mode in the past but this doesn't replicate that. \nAside from this PR, Do you get a delay of maybe 100ms after the windows slides down but still can't type?\n. Cmder needs to stay able to run as a portable app so that means keeping out of the registry. That also avoids clobbering peoples existing Conemu registry configs I think.\nI don't see what there is to gain from using the registry. Have you any specific reason to need this?\n. Once you run cmder /register all to get the shortcuts and have cmder.exe available in your Path there's not much else to install.\n\nJust popping another question, that the ConEmu is now autorun on windows startsup, instead of Cmder, any idea it happens like this?\n\nThere's a conemu setting for this but we don't default it to on.. What no not what you were supposed to do hub. \n. I don't know where all these files between the branches are coming from. This should be 1 line. \n. I've tried messing with user and system env properties for HTTP_PROXY and to be honest I've never found a good way to do it and guarantee they change. \nI tried a powershell function with these [environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\"http_proxy\", $proxy, \"User\") and to unset \"http_proxy\", $null, \"User\"\nbut like I say, seemed unreliable to take effect. \n. Cmder 1.3.2, seems a dependency got fixed in all this time.\n```cmd\nC:\\Users\\jbennett          \n\u03bb dir | wc -l              \n29                           \nC:\\Users\\jbennett          \n\u03bb dir | find /v \"\" /c      \n29                         \n```. @Shoozza I suspect just for simplicity as we just ship the whole conemu download package in /vendor.\n. @MartiUK  Looks like you've merged and closed things this references are you happy to close his too?\n. rounding up another /single issue onto #420. I guess just closing pending further discussion on a new PR as referenced at the end of #368.\nMight I suggest doing this would need some kind of inheritance to be worked out. Cmder would already be user specific and added more user customisations since this. So you'll have to figure out a way of slotting in machine settings between user and vendor that cmder ships. Then decide if it's a different default user overrides or machine settings take priority. \nMaybe if you're changing a lot just fork cmder and change you own org settings in the vendor area and install your version. I don't think keeping up to date with cmder should have many problems. And if it does maybe that would expose better answers to above questions. First thing I can think of be careful with conemu.xml as it changes a load of date.time stamps on settings even though settings don't change. It makes diffs super noisy. . This can be close as 150215 got merged into development.\n. Couldn't reproduce in 1.3.2. Just adding some test cases I did;\nMy clone of bliker:master is at N:\\cmder with a full vendor build (i.e. includes msysgit)\n```\nC:\\Users\\jbennett\n\u03bb %CMDER_ROOT%\n'N:\\cmder' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file.\nC:\\Users\\jbennett\n\u03bb git p4\nfatal: git was built without support for git-core\\git-p4 (NO_PYTHON=YesPlease).\nC:\\Users\\jbennett\n\u03bb git-p4\n'git-p4' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file.\n```\nWith deleting /vendor/msysgit to use my locally system installed msysgit;\nC:\\Users\\jbennett.BHS.000\n\u03bb git p4\nbasename: too many arguments\nTry `basename --help' for more information.\nfatal: git was built without support for  (NO_PYTHON=YesPlease).\n. I suspect if this is even fixable it's conemu. Just because conemu is what's dealing with the display.\nI have had a number of windows get stuck on top of things or under each other that can only be rectified by emptying the desktop. It might just be a quirk of how it's being hidden.\nMaybe you can work around it toggling the options to minimize to taskbar or similar.\n. Afraid all we can do it hopefully point some help towards conemu about it.\n. @ragekit Just so you know, I think I did the same thing as you. I think you made your patch-1 branch from your fork of master then submitted the pull request to development. \nThe extra commits are the difference between master and development to get up to your patch-1.\nI think roughly the flow to do is;\n- Fetch bliker upstream;\n- checkout upstream/development;\n- commit/merge patch-1;\n- push origin;\n- create PR \n. Cmder is supposed to be pretty non-invasive so just jacking everyones context menu is a bit impolite. Personally I like there being no difference by default of the portable or installed versions.\nMaybe if the project had a few more settings to justify it there could be a list of settings functions for enable/disable features or just a .cmder config profile script.\nAlso, Cmder missing in explorer is issue 404 hehheh :)\n. One day I'll understand what git is going to do. Will remake without the tons of other commits.\n. If you've in powershell new-item -type file exampleName.\nIn cmd type NUL > file.txt.\nI think in the dev build you can make an alias with spaces in so in the next release you can do alias touch=\"type NUL > %1\"\n. And if you are using powershell, put this in you file at $profile\nfunction touch{\n    Param(\n        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]\n        [string]$name\n    )\n    if(-not (test-path $name)){\n        new-item -type file $name -force\n    } else {\n        Write-Warning \"$name exists\"\n    }\n}\nWe're working on making things like this much nicer.\n. I didn't know about the moderation. I'm just worried about replying on it and then finding packages we want aren't updated. Apparently it's a decentralised format so we could in the long run host our own packages we or anyone to host their own approved packages. \nI think a good idea would be to have cmder releases as a solid \"run this and start work\" set of packages and tweaks. We happen to use conemu and psGet. psGet seems to be using the chocolatey format. we might as well pull our stuff with that.\nPerhaps we approve what ships on vendor/sources.json and after that it's on the user. This way those PR's about ruby and node we could just say add those choc packages to your personal sources and cmder will use it. \nMaybe we wait and see what PS5.0 drops. it might just be for PS modules or MS might create a whole package ecosystem. I assume that'll be with W10.\nI'm familiar with fedora and with yum you can install a collection of packages like webserver and it'll grab apache php5 etc for you. I've been thinking of cmder a bit like that.\n. I Think you'll have to ask the conemu project about this one. It's not something our cmder parts specifically are doing anyway\n. Hi @UltCombo cmder isn't a fork, it's a project that's the front of our set of programs we've found make a nice console, one of those programs being conEmu. I find conemu quite thick on documentation (because it con do tons of stuff) so have a look on their site for all kinds of help. If you still can't get this feature I'm sure they wouldn't mind the request on github\nIt's not uncommon for it's author Maximus5 to be around our issue queue which is why we tag things about that project. \nPerhaps start here\nIf you work something cool out show us! we might add it.\n. This is some problem with git, with that in mind could you just try to use some git command from a shell that isn't cmder/conemu. Just maybe commands like git status and checkout a couple of branches and status there. \nIf git runs that fast it must be something in cmders prompt function trying to write the status line before returning. I've found having the git status line in the prompt does have a performance hit in the tenth of a second order you describe. Any prompt function that is not just a cmder thing. \n. When the git prompt adds to the end of that line the branch / numbers e.g [master 0 +1 0] it's just formatting its own call to git status.\nFrom what you describe I think you've got a slow git repository. You'd best find out how you could speed it up. I could just be sheer size. I'm sure there's some tweaks to make windows faster with git. \nTo immediately speed that up you could remove the git parts of the prompt function cmder is calling. \n. Learning some new stuff myself here, This first answer seems like some solid advice. Check the git manual first though to see what these commands really do to your repo. \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/4485059/git-bash-is-extremely-slow-in-windows-7-x64\n. I will try to add some kind of setting to flip this in the powershell side of the console for a future release. Probably not the next release though. At least git is faster now.\n. I've been watching this issue open with conemu for ages. It's a strange behaviour of a combination of settings. My current laptop isn't doing what you describe but I've had it in the past.\nSee for some discussion.\nThe quickest work around i've found is to disable quake mode from the settings in conemu. But I have quakemode on and this doesn't happen so it's a bit odd.\n. Do you mind telling me if powershell does that too?. Win7SP1x64 here. Moved onto the VCRUNTIME140.dll is missing after extracting the attached msvcp140.7z/dll\n. @skynetHopper if you run get-executionPolicy -list is it shown as remoteSigned?\nHave you both tried either right-clicking the powershell file in question and clicking button \"unblock file\"\nOr you can point the unblock-file command at the profile.ps1 file. If that works I'll have to look at doing that in a setup step.\nYou should be able to leave your executionPolicy as remotesigned.\n. You are correct. We are trying to find a balance between what we really need and not just changing global settings for users.\n. I think there's a way around it, I'm making a new vm to test this stuff from scratch. The execution policy is more like a bad default and a not feature than it is for security.\nWhat I don't want to is run the whole session in bypass.\n. I just wish we could force to run our own init/profile script and drop back to remoteSigned\nAt least launching the process with -bypass is just for you cmder session and not anything that run on the computer. You wouldn't get any warning about running a script explicitly as .\\fromInternet.ps1\nI thought about signing our own script but we'd still have the same problem but with managing the key instead of the exec policy. \n. If you've not changed your execution policy you'll still get that with\npowershell. The changes in later versions of cmder revert to using the old\ncmd.exe instead to avoid it.\nIf you're a powershell user you need to set your execution policy as\ndescribed. I and MS recommend remotesigned.\nSo from an admin prompt, \"Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\" then I think\nyou need to navigate into the cmder folder to run \"unblock-file *\"\nOn 8 December 2015 at 10:38, Martin Kemp notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n1.2.9?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/483#issuecomment-162844958.\n. @MartiUK The psReadline tool should be doing that.

I found the bug report for $PSScriptRoot so I'm seing how moving our PS code into a (airquotes) proper \"cmder\" module will work out. \n. I don't know if HOME is required here but the powershell side doesn't define it and for users on a network roaming profile (me) userprofile is not the correct path to my actual files.

If you're in a PowerShell console you must specify if the executable you want to launch from the current directory is indeed in the current directory with .\\. in cmd there's no difference.\nThis is to stop malicious projects just putting a virus in said folder and call it cd.exe to trick the user into running it when they navigate out.\n. You're right, the file is a cheap way of doing it. At least we can know the highest ver file wins.\nI thought maybe some clever powershell way to get the checked out branch/tag and build and store that value to return but finding that, wow.

PS adds some aliases to its way of doing things so that nix and cmd people aren't punished outright for trying PS. \n\nAs such dir and ls are just aliased to get-childItem which if I read from bash correctly; -a, List all entries including those starting with a dot . and -l, Use a long listing format powershell just does that all the time anyway.\nYou might find common nix commands aliased to powershell but using parameters is where that helpfulness breaks down. \nsee: get-alias, even more info with help alias.\nEither get used to some powershell, stick to cmd, or in your PS profile if you really want you can remove defined aliases like they're files mapped to the alias drive. rm alias:\\ls. I think that will keep looking down your path for ls.\nJust do rm alias:\\rm last ;)\n. How are you doing the per user? C++ is like Greek to me.\n@MartiUK \n. I should clarify. if anyone wants to use the PS functions for now you need to import the functions first.\n1. . $env:CMDER_ROOT\\scripts\\utils.ps1\n2. Register-Cmder\n. Thanks for your time.\n. Maybe https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/latest would be a better URL. I'll leave that call up to a more active maintainer I'm not sure how @MartiUK wants to tag releases. The powershell in 1.2 didn't sound like it went as smooth as I should have helped make it.\n. I think using a cmder profile would be good. Anyone who wants to pull in their own PS Profile should know they can just dot source it . $profile.currentuserAllHosts\nAlthough if you don't know powershell you won't have your own customized profile anyway.. hmm. Should cmder be it's own self contained little terminal or be a great baseline to add your own stuff onto that also happens to run portably. \nTough that it's not really I code problem. I vote use a cmder profile but keep in mind it's not a mandatory one. That's consistent with how cmd behaves and also doesn't have to worry about clobbering someone's main profile. At least until someone complains with a better/more informed use case. \n. I wasn't sure what it was but powershell wouldn't run with it so out it came :)\nHow'd that get in there I thought git would deal with all that. Are you writing PS in something that isn't the ISE? That complained about the character immediately. (Not using the ISE is perfectly fine by the way)\n. I have out aliased to out-file -encoding UTF8 haha. Don't start me on excel and csv's.\n. Ever given brackets ago @Stanzilla ?\nI only ask because I made the jump from sublime to brackets. Atom came out about a year later and I just haven't considered switching.\nOnly downside with not using the ISE is you're missing that sweet sweet intellisense\n. To my knowledge we have nothing to access that controls this. Only @bliker \n. This is a clink thing that's injected into CMD.\nIf you use the powershell console, tab behaves like you want.\nIf you want to also see a list use ctrl + space and you will get a table of candidates. You can use the arrow keys to pick a candidate in the table as well as just type it in.\nThat auto-complete table feature is because of PSReadLine.\n. Was that;\n1. cmder>cmd\n2. cmder>powershell\n3. cmder>cmd w/o injection\nor by native powershell did you mean a normal powershell.exe from win+R?\n. > Powershell aliases can only alias a single command with no arguments to a single probably shorter command so it is pointless to worry about converting doskey/sh aliases to Powershell. They just do not work right.\nCorrect and I agree but there's nothing to stop you just making a function in the PS profile that does the alias you require. You can even make a nice descriptive named function and alias that to type in.\ni.e I have:\n``` powershell\nfunction get-list{\n    get-childitem @args | format-wide -autosize\n}\nSet-Alias lsa get-list\n...other things\nCD to my projects folder at startup\nlsa -Directory\n```\nmore examples, albeit an old file now noteworthy: touch, swap-python or from my other file git-server\n. It looks like your $PSScriptRoot variable is empty what version of powershell are you on with $PSVersionTable\n. Yeh PS version 2. I think we found $PSscriptroot a 3.0 thing. either just replace it with a dot or install the new window management framework 4 or 5. \nI think I'll change it to a dot anyway since it's already specific to is execution path. it's fancier than it needs to be. I've only got a phone I can't use an editor till Monday,  who am @martyuk ?\n. Apparently you just use two fingers to scroll: http://conemu.github.io/en/TabletPC.html\nConEmu is used to wrap the conhost that Cmder layers our settings on top of. \n. Commits have landed to fix this but also we've had weird issues with the \"program files\" area before, In general don't but your own files in there, windows treats it a bit special with the permissions and odd things can not work. Just leave it for installers to use.\n. I would say if git's already installed use that. If someone gets cmder+git with git already I'd assume they made a mistake. Perhaps we make a config function to help you flip over the env settings to a portable git if for whatever reason a user might not want to use the installed one.\nIf we don't prefer the external version of packages we would need to start asking questions like \"Ignore external config files?\". I don't think anyone wants to have a .cmder/.gitconfig as well as their normal ones. Not by default anyway. I'm already not crazy about ignoring users PS Profiles but that's off topic.\n. I had no idea git-lfs supported windows. I don't think we'll be pulling in git-lfs as portable install in the large cmder so I don't see how we can add this support. Instead we should prefer external git.\nI see you can get git-lfs from choco install git-lfs.install so maybe it can be as simple as a startup command. \n. If you want it to run every time it goes in your startup user-profile cmd/ps1 for the console host you're choosing. \ncmder.exe pretty much just lets you start at a target folder. \n@MartiUK  I swear I've seen an issue about updating the launcher to pass commands into cmder, I must be miss-remembering. \nMaybe: #181 and #370\n. Further discussion (if any) on 370 I think is appropriate. Consider 457 a good workaround.. Bit of an extreme fix but ok. Sounded like the path git was found at wasn't the version either your or cmder were expecting. \n. Could certainly document this better but;\nThe .ps1 files in \"$ENV:CMDER_ROOT\\config\\profile.d\" will be dot sourced into your session each powershell process start. Code and the next bit.\n\"$env:CMDER_ROOT\\config\\user-profile.ps1\" is created upon launch, which contains hooks to modify the prompt. Otherwise everything else still loads just like you'd expect. template creation\nFix\nI think $CmderUserProfilePath should be leaked out of our profile script which would allow you to append to the end of it. \npowershell\n\"Set-PSReadlineOption -EditMode Emacs\" | out-file $CmderUserProfilePath -append\nThere may be an encoding issue. I find PS funny when writing files. Just fix it in a text editor in that case.\nReasoning\nCmder, being portable, didn't seem right to inherit user's profile settings. (I'm making a further assumption that many users, the first thing they might do is customize their own prompt. Then we'd start to clash).  \nBut that's a choice made long before all the above customization was added.. The community and Microsoft are already making that with psGet+chocolaty though. We won't do a better job on our own it's something we're all watching closely to tie in.\nYou were always supposed to be able to just add onto the vendor\\sources.json and re-run build.ps1 yourself to pull everything for your own cmder. It sounds like that's the user story that needs improving.\n. Oh the joys of clink. Needs updated as posted above. \n. theme, colours? Should be monokai.\nTry 1.3.0-pre for s if you still have the macro error.\n. This should be fixed in 1.3\n. Are they installed to a path found in $env:psmodulepath.split(';') ?. Thanks @daxgames for helping. @srm-soumya feel free to re-open or make new issues if it's not fixed.\n. I just can't find an example this fixes but join-path won't correct too many \\'s so in my opinion makes it more fragile to its inputs.\n. @Stanzilla  Might as well stay since it's on but it doesn't do anything. As long as nobody tries to think it needs escaping as \"\\/psmodules/\" will break. \n. What problem does this actually fix? join-path takes care of exactly this and my testing I can't seem to trip it up. Did you run into something?\n. I'm sorry @liftir but I can't quite pick out part of the help which states it needs to have a delimiter. \nFrom testing, if anything you want to leave out your own delimiters because PS seems to only add them, not fix an incorrect path with too many delimiters. see example 5.\n```\njoin-path \"a\" \"b\"\njoin-path \"a\" \"b/\"\njoin-path \"a.txt\" \"b\"\njoin-path \"\\a\\\" \"\\b\\\"\njoin-path \"c:/a//\" \"//b/\"\njoin-path \"a/\" \"/b/\"\na\\b\na\\b\\\na.txt\\b\n\\a\\b\\\nc:\\a\\\\b\\\na\\b\\\n``\n. Only done some cursory reading (because I'm tired of looking at the word \"single\" haha) but this sounds like it might be worth looking through #420 and friends to make sure various things are accounted for.. @Maximus5 any suggestions?\n. The tab name is changing because there's a snippet of code that takes thegit status` info to print in your repl the branch/staging state every line.\nIf it's still doing it can you post more info about the git repo and the console output. possibly your own git status output. \n. if the git tail.exe doesn't do it, the powershell way doesn't do it, then I suspect it's to do with how the windows console wants to eat input when there's a process running. \n. Is this ok in any cmd.exe or powershell.exe console? Just to rule out git itself.\n. In the ConEmu settings win + alt+ P under Main > Task bar there is a tick box \"Minimize on focus lose (not in Quake Style)\"\nYou don't have that ticked do you? I just downloaded the pre-release it's not a default of ours.\n. discuss more in the PR\n. Those look nice, I have no problem with this, it's @cmderdev/core 's baby.\n. You can at least run the png's through an optimizer to get like 90% off each one.\n. Referenced on PR #952 to focus discussion into one place where the change may be made.\n. I don't want to step on any toes but can we move discussion onto #952\n. centur:\n\nInvoke-Expression doesn't add much overhead compared to the direct function call. I quickly smoke measured it with Measure-Command before PR and saw that it adds about \n0.001 to 0.003 secs compared to direct invocation of the function which measured, with an empty function, to ~0.008)\n\nThis is super interesting I'll experiment this. I haven't perf tested this PR yet it's welcome to changes.\n. Those . .\\imports can get killed on the profile startup. They're only needed for W7 so we should really do some feature detection for that. Even so, PS still isn't an instant-on thing which I do find very annoying. But I pretty much never close PS.\nMy checkGit function in there should fend off posh-git as long as your startup dir isn't a git directory and needs it.\n@janschulz clink isn't injected at all for powershell it doesn't need it. That was my point behind the failed move to PS Default because we keep getting really weird issues because of clink.\n. I don't use cmd, it's nice to hear where we've had similar problems. Never sorry needed for jumping in. \n. Latest commits will require this posh-git PR landing and a module update.\nJust noticed Post-git now warn they don't support PS2.0 So this might be a bigger pain than we like. If PS2.0 is a big deal for us we'll have to have our own fork of Posh-Git.\n. PR has been merged in :) Just need a release to be wrapped up for whenever they do that. \n. Might as well tackle #528 while I'm at it. Brings PS more into line with cmd.\n. How do you poke CI to run again? That looks like some download fail. @MartiUK \n. Yes I've tested what I can think of without any issues. Be nice for more people to have a look now.\n. What have you got system-wize as well as anti-virus? Could something be trying to protect the process like EMET? What location are you running cmder from?\n. You should be using PS Remoting for your servers not using remote desktop with cmder on there. \n. Thankyou\n. @Henry-T It's always customizable, this patch is just the defaults. \n. I've not run it myself but I suspect you just want to add another task to conEmu for it and what you desire should be injected. \nConEmu settings -> Tasks -> Add it.\n. @MartiUK Does the \\ in at the end of the drive letter escape something stupid in the string in the launcher here? \n$env:CMDER_START is set as U:\"\n. I've just tried this in 1.3.0-pre and as soon as I remove the package.json I lose the prompt message. \nDo you think you could give me some steps you've found to reproduce it?\n. Affecting ctrl+space how? That's working perfectly well for me. \nI'm just wondering if the rest is related to using ctrl+alt I think conemu might be eating it. \n. Do you mean you have ran .\\cmder.exe /REGISTER USER and now see \"Cmder Here\" with our icon in the right click menu, not shift+right click menu? That \"cmder here\" option just opens cmd.exe without any colours?\n. I don't know how you are doing this.\nFrom default all I can see to set is Main > Task bar > Auto minimize to TSA doing that and using minimize naturally just moves it to the system tray. If I click close X it closes the whole program.\nTo put cmder in the system tray and leave everything running you then click the minimize _ button not close X\nIf you need further help, what other settings have you changed to get this behavior?\n. Settings > Main > Task Bar;\n  Auto minimize to TSA = False\n  Minimize on closing last tab = True\n  Hide to the TSA = True\nAnd you want to be right-clicking the closing X\n- minimize  = cmder sits on task bar\n- R-click X = cmder is minimized to TSA with currrent sessions open\n- left click X = cmder will close all tabs and go to the TSA. \nDownside is when opening cmder from the TSA again you will have conemu with no tabs open as the X closed them all.\n@Maximus5  Isn't there a way to have conemu always keep at least 1 certain tab task running. To auto open after close? Perhaps an option for X to close all but active as a shortcut. \n. Pointing more loose ends back to #420. you would set no_proxy just like you commented: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh272656(v=vs.120).aspx\nBut It's going to be up to applications to find and respect that settings. \nYou might want to make a function that sets the process env http_proxy to DIRECT so you can quickly flip between them.\n. What's D:\\? Do you have permission to create .exe files there? make any text file and rename it .exe does it work at the path d:\\cmder\\cmder\\vendor?\n. Is your anti-virus kicking in about those 3 files?\n. Can you delete the 3 existing exe's a copy them out manually, perhaps it's having trouble overwriting them.\n.

Obviously conemu isn't running is it? since you're trying to replace its files. \nYou wouldn't have lost your config if you just removed the 3 files I said. \n. I'm not sure I follow, these two lines describe the same things;\n\nIn previous versions you would highlight some text and that text would be copied to the clipboard.\nNow, you highlight some text and nothing happens. Then you right-click the text and it is automatically copied to the prompt.\n\nAs far as I can recall. Highlighting text IS the copy command and will go on your clipboard. Right-click is paste. I don't think this has ever changed.\nNormally windows cmd.exe or powershell.exe hosts, when \"quickedit mode\" is enabled. you get;\n1. Highlight\n2. right-click copy\n3. right-click paste\nIn short. Just highlight, that is on your clipboard already at that point.\n. I think the cmder.exe wrapped has many changes in its future from all the stuff i've pointed back to #420\nI can't really touch C++ so hopefully just getting all the related issues together will help those who can.. If the referenced issue doesn't answer it I don't think we've any clue, sorry. Perhaps a combination of install location, caching and permissions help light its load.\n. Settings > Keys & Macro > Mark/copy, untick \"Copy on Left Button Release\"\nSeems you have to restart cmder then it only woks the once also. Bit odd.\n. I wonder how that \" got there. What is your $env:username and if you ls c:\\users what's that folder named?\nFinally what the registry path set to for \"cmder here\" either tell me from regedit or with PS;\n1. New-PSDrive -Name HKCR -PSProvider Registry -Root HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT Add HKEY Class Root\n1. get-itemproperty \"HKCR:\\Directory\\Shell\\Cmder\\Command\"\n1. get-itemproperty \"HKCR:\\Directory\\Background\\Shell\\Cmder\\Command\"\n. Oh ok, so powershell just does this for you when you open it all the time (in cmder of course). I thought this must be from the \"CMDER Here\" context menu when your use cmder.exe /register\nSo I'm looking at the task setting in conemu here, what's your $env:userprofile ? \n. Have you tried leaving them as &quot; though? It might be to get around how conemu might parse that task.\n. Will you try PowerShell -new_console:d:%USERPROFILE% -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoLogo -NoProfile -NoExit -Command \"Invoke-Expression '. ''%ConEmuDir%\\..\\profile.ps1'''\"; please?\n. Not too sure about this one then, @MartiUK Can the launcher in some way be passing in $ENV:CMDER_START string with an extra quote?\n. Are you ok now? Feel free to re-open.\n. duplicate of #1218. As of 1.3.2 I can't reproduce. Tested a... \"aa...\" and \"a... including resizing the window. Must be newer clinks that fixed it.. Cmder 1.4 will let you customize the prompt in powershell which should offer you a mechanism to get what you're after.\nPowershell populates $LASTEXITCODE for you and there's also get-history whose members have StartExecutionTime,EndExecutionTime properties.\nTo change this right now have a look at the prompt function in profile.ps1 but any changes there will get clobbered next update.\n. Tested 1.3.2 and it's still doing it, But it's not overwriting anything and cls/clear do wipe everything. Hopefully a fix just comes in from conemu or clink updates in time.\npowershell doesn't do this so I presume clink is at fault.. git has not ls command that must be an alias you've created, without knowing what that alias is doing I can't offer anymore advice then it must be some clever history formatting. try running each part that alias is made up off to find if there's a slow piece. \n.

I see what's happened here, my branch was created from the latest in master not development. . That could possibly be a win, at the moment the whole console session is run with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass to get around the issue of loading our profile. Maybe we should use this trick for the profile as well and then cmder can leave the execution policy alone.. We'll work out a solution to #1280 and you'll be able to change everything.. Ditch cmd for powershell and you'll get something like this. Otherwise if clink haven't added that by now maybe they can't?. That would be a good question for the conemu devs. This will be from tools in Git-For-Windows so it'll get updated as a dependency when they do.. PrePrompt, CmderPrompt and PostPrompt where intended to be small hooks to easily modify the prompt. I guess if you know what you're doing we do indeed need a method to replace the whole prompt. \nThis needs further testing but I suspect if you move what you've already moved further down to line 178 you could leave #1282 out and simply allow something in profile.d/ to overwrite $prompt just before it's set to read-only.  Might need to specify the prompts to global: scopes but the dot-source should pull those files into this scope. Thus as long as anything in profile.d sets a prompt variable it'll be used instead.. Yeh I've tested what I said. If you just move the same lines you've already moved in this further down to line 178 after [scriptblock]$prompt before set-item -Path function:\\prompt...\nAny file in profile.d that exports $prompt will overwrite the cmder one. It must be a scriptblock type though or you'll get an error. Might be worth testing the type and writing a nicer error although the powershell one is pretty clear;\nCannot convert the \"test\" value of type \"System.String\" to type \"System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock\".\nAt C:\\f\\src\\cmder\\config\\profile.d\\prompt.ps1:1 char:1\n+ $prompt =  'test'\nIf you force-push this PR to update it I'll just merge it in. Otherwise I don't know my git-fu to do it myself but keep your credit.. I'll probably mess something up by not merging into development but we'll see.\nThanks you. There's some good room for a documentation and examples update if anyone watching add a PR.. ~~How are you assigning $prompt in the first place to make that if bypass the scriptblock prompt?~~\nNevermind this PR goes hand-in-hand with 1280. yes discuss on #1280 . I get this a lot too and I just use powershell.exe not cmder. I think it's just something node does if it fired off a lot of running jobs in child processes or they have large callbacks pending. Node needs to get a gap in the event queue to process the kill command ctrl-c makes.\nBut if anyone gets an actual answer I'd love to know too.. Does the powershell task lock up for you? It uses something else entirely to process/format the git status output so if powershell doesn't have a problem then it'll be something to do with clink. If they both have problems it could be conemu but I doubt it.. You'll need to check the path those process' are under is mentioning in the PATH env variable that cmder has in it.\nI think cmd is echo %PATH% but i know powershell is $env:Path.split(';') The path needs to be the folder with the executables in it, windows doesn't check those paths recursively. Only the first one found will get used too. (I'm sure you knew that just to narrow things down)\nWith powershell you can check the path scopes too if you are finding cmder doesn't have the same paths as cmd.exe or powershell.exe\nScope | command (powershell)\n--|--\nprocess | $env:Path.split(';')\nUser | [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path', 'user').split(';')\nComputer | [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path', 'machine').split(';')\nsidenode: How did you make the gif it's really nice?. Thanks, it must have overwritten PATH somehow like you said.. Lol why is it closed? Have you seen the post dates for someone to bring this up again?\nDoesn't conemu keep running in the system tray unless you exit everything from there? That's my guess I can't test from my phone and Chromebook. . %VARIABLE% Doesn't exist in powershell or the host program. \nFor env variables you want;\ntype | example | value\n-|-|-\nprocess | $env:tmp | C:\\Users\\Jack\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\nprocess | [environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('tmp', 'process') | C:\\Users\\Jack\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\nUser | [environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('tmp', 'user') | C:\\Users\\Jack\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\nmachine | [environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('tmp', 'machine') | C:\\WINDOWS\\TEMP. We'll have to do something about the clobbering because it can't be assumed people are updating powershell.. You'd think but there's a lot of people that would be migrating to powershell and may be using cmder, so anything that helps onboard people is a win. But that's not to say it couldn't be replaced with a warning like \"hey, your PS version X is old, consider updating to Y < wmf link >\". \nBut expecting updating powershell doesn't make cmder portable.\nI should think reading how PS loads module we should find a way to not clobber things. I just haven't had time to look and test.. docker stop $(dokcer ps -q -a) That's a powershell line are you using the powershell task?. You know when you type in the shell it then runs that command? $() to powershell creates a new shell  for that line and returns the output. So it runs that bit first. That's why it worked. \nLike maths 1+1 + (2 + 2) -> 1 + 1 + 4 -> 6\nI guess bash is where powershell got the concept from.\nIt's exactly the same as;\n$containers = docker ps -q -a\ndocker stop $containers\nalso just noticed the dokcer spelling mistake.. You just use the system proxy settings. your organisation should have set this. You may need to add environment variables HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY of the same settings.. Tested it on my vscode 1.17.2 and it works fine.\nAdding a note, VScode defaults to powershell these days and personally my systems have the execution policy as  remotesigned so I only need;\njson\n\"terminal.integrated.shellArgs.windows\": [\n    \"-noExit\",\n    \"-command\",\n    \"invoke-expression '. ''C:\\\\f\\\\src\\\\cmder\\\\vendor\\\\profile.ps1'''\"\n  ]\nThe string has strange escaping.. Looks great thanks for the contribution.. I'm just wondering if the git tag is available to use that might better. Regex parsing the readme just seems to be asking for trouble. \nCan't you take advantage of the inbuilt [version] data type instead of smushing strings together? They won't like words in the version string. Can't github tag the release as a pre-release rather than putting it in the version string?. Yeah without hotlinking it's fairly useless.\nYou can name that package key whatever you want if you set it, otherwise the script pulls the name and url extension together sets that as the package, and carries on. \n. It's bad practice to use the back tick to escape the carriage return, any white-space after the back tick will suddenly break the return and it's hard to tell.\nThe pipe can escape line endings anyway so the back tick is also redundant anyway. \n. Reading what & actually does here I might suggest to tidy this up givien & a list of strings to execute\n. I pulled out the code that imported everything all the time from our vendor\\psmodules in another commit (e811c60ab2433405c0cf12843f56eb2e16425b41)\nPosh-git needs a module manifest creating to behave with powershell's auto-loading behaviour. This checks if we have git and need the cmdlet only if we're actually in a git repository. \nAll in the name of speed. You don't need to wait for all the git stuff constantly especially if its not even used.\n. If that's to just run the profile.ps1 into the current session you want to dot source it:\n. \"$CmderUserProfilePath\"\nHonestly I'm not sure what & will do different but you'll see a lot of 'dot source' when looking at powershell examples so it would be more consistent. \n. You should call this Get-VersionString to keep to powershells naming convention.. ",
    "austinwagner": "Couldn't @bliker just sign the script to prevent needing to set the execution policy to anything lower than AllSigned?\n. You should be able to generate a cert yourself. It won't be trusted by default since it's not from a CA, but the user will be prompted when the script is run if they want to allow it along with an option to always trust it.\n. The init script just adds the cmder\\bin folder to the PATH. For you to be able to run Ruby, the executable would need to sit directly in cmder\\bin.\nThere should probably be a way to easily add new folders to Cmder's PATH because this folder will easily become a mess. There should probably be config file where you enter additional paths relative to the bin folder (or CMDER_ROOT?).\nHaving a script that searches subfolders of cmder\\bin for a file that directs it to the bin folder would be nice. It could just add the subfolder itself if the config doesn't exist. That would allow the folders to be renamed without needing to reconfigure and would require no configuration if you are just using the folders to organize the exes.\n. @MartiUK Is the suggestion @Jackbennett provided actually what you want? That would not give you the same functionality as as Cmder Here option, but instead just open Cmder at the default location.\nIn any case, I will look into adding \"Cmder Here\" to the launcher. I'll set it up to have options to automatically register and unregister Cmder with the shell menu.\n. It shouldn't be too hard to implement, though I am worried about the amount of time it will add to do the search if each subfolder contains many files or if there are a lot of extensions in PATHEXT.\n. If you're using the latest version, you will have Cmder.exe instead of Cmder.bat. You can pass a path as an argument to start in that directory.\n. @bdukes I've tested on Win 8.1 x64 (not elevated) and Win 7 x64 (elevated) and it starts at the path that I provide. Can you verify that the line @if defined CMDER_START cd /d \"%CMDER_START%\" is at the end of cmder/vendor/init.bat? If it is, could you also add @echo %CMDER_START% to the end of that script and see what it outputs when you start Cmder?\n. That would explain it. I forgot about powershell since I don't ever use it. \n. Actually it probably makes the most sense to just statically link against the CRT. However, the 2013 DLLs do not have to be installed because they are included in the release.\n. @RDeluxe Unfortunately the problem lies in the fact that it's not possible to get the App ID through the Windows API unless it has been explicitly set by the application. Windows seems to generate different App IDs depending on how the shortcut is created. I believe the only way to get the generated App ID would be to do what Taskbar Tweaker does and hook into Explorer.\n. I'm doing that so you can run the script again if you add subfolders to the\nbin folder and don't want to restart Cmder to pick up the change. There's\nnot really much harm in removing that loop though. It will just create\nduplicates in the variable.\n. ",

I think here is two options. First is set ~=%USERPROFILE% and something like cd %~%\\Documents will work then, but you will have to wrap tilda into %% always.

You're welcome! :) BTW, how do you think, when these changes from dev  will be landed to master\n. Hey @MartiUK ! Awesome feature!\n. Have a question to @MartiUK . Is Cmder executable should be checked into this repo as well as its sources? If so, i will add it to this PR in separate commit.\n. I can make it in this PR and add it to .gitignore as well.\n. Well, i don't see much value in specifying ONLY custom ConEmu config. Cmder is not just a ConEmu with custom config, it's a set of utilities and tools around it. And my intent is to allow to user have own customizations around Cmder.\nFor example, Cmder can be checked directly from this repo and with these changes you can have all of your customazations outside of local repo, and maybe even checked into another repository.\nAnother good thing is that you can have separate aliases and history for different users on different machines.\n\nI think you are missing a \\ after %CMDER_ROOT%\n\nDumb mistake. Fixed.\n\nJust curious, why changing %s into %S?\n\nHave no idea why, but %s doesn't worked correctly. It just pasted first symbol instead of the whole string. Unfortunately, i'm not very experienced in C++, but i'll try to sort out these format issues.\nNOTE: some docs about %s and %S behaviour in format functions here\n. @narnaud Fixed. String formatting issue is exists only in VS 2025 preview, so i changes format patterns back to %s.\n@MartiUK Do you want me to squash all these commits into one or at least reorganize them?\n. > would it be possible to also provide a %CMDER_CONFIG%\nSorry, @CumpsD but i can't get your point. There is already one %CMDER_CONFIG% defined. How would you define another one?\nTo solve your problem i see two options:\n1. Another variable (e.g %CONEMU_CONFIG%), but it looks too complicated. And if someone would like to have separate config for clink? Another var (%CLINK_CONFIG%)?\n2. Probably the best - each tool should accept, that if there is no configuration is found for it in %CMDER_CONFIG%, then it need to use configuration from %CMDER_ROOT%/config\n. Closing this as a stale. Will resend a new one after reworking/rethinking.\n. Displaying existing aliases is already implemented in development branch. See https://github.com/bliker/cmder/blob/development/bin/alias.bat#L42\n. :+1: \n. Try to play with font settings, especially 'Font charset'. Probably this could help.\n\nAlso there is a CHCP command which could help you to set up your console charset as well (try CHCP 65001 to set a Unicode code page for cmd.exe process)\n. Yep. Just tried again and it works.\nNote that im planning to push some minor stuff to my repo and then release a 0.1.0 version so you probably would need to change a link to archive before release.\n. @MartiUK. Looks lke i've done. I've updated a link to release archive, so all what you need it to merge this PR.\n. @JosephSilber, take a look at https://github.com/bliker/cmder/issues/435\n. @Keilan you can try to replace if...end block here: https://github.com/bliker/cmder/blob/master/config/git.lua#L35 with the following line\ncolor = colors.clean\nThis will decrease delays twice, but you will lose colored branch name depending on repo status.\n. @JanSchulz, do you have an idea about what might be the cause of these lags? Something that was changed since 1.2.9\n@Stanzilla, i think this is not related to clink-completions, since the git prompt is still handled by cmder.lua that is still a part of Cmder. Or am I missing something?\n. @Stanzilla, close please as development should contain clink-completions@0.2.1 already \n. @Stanzilla, you got me thinking about CHANGELOG, mine dont have one :smile: \n. Done.\n. @Stanzilla, fixed in https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/clink-completions/commit/1cea322bd6f579e8b8798381fcdd928a3869ce74\n. @Stanzilla, i saw this on one of my machines, but it doesn't repro right now. I updated ConEmu and git after that, so it might be an issue with one ot them.\n@mwhitis, could you please post your git version and location (git --version and where git in console) and ConEmu version (conemu /?)\n. @shiroming, this was fixed in upstream, the fix will be available in Cmder 1.3.0.\nAt this time you cant try to apply https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/clink-completions/commit/1cea322bd6f579e8b8798381fcdd928a3869ce74 manually to your npm_prompt.lua\n. Yup, everything is correct. Your package.json is missing name and version attributes. (probably because it is a templete and you need to add them manually). See package.json reference here\n. @MartiUK , @Stanzilla, this probably could be closed.\n. @adiachenko, actually i'm inclined to replace invalid_ -> no_. This would be more appropriate (and less obtrusive :smile: ), than invalid_ or  just empty strings (which would give you e.g. @0.0.1 - looks kinda weird). Or, probably remove npm package badge at all if there is neither package name nor version specified.\n. @jpruiz114, take a look at the 2nd comment on this thread and apply that change to your C:\\cmder/vendor/clink-completions/npm_prompt.lua\n. @Stanzilla, why clean cmder/vendor? I think first we need to ask @jpruiz114, which version he uses?\n@jpruiz114, you need to add changes to npm_prompt.lua only. In my patch i added them to npm.lua instead because at some point i decided to merge these two files into one. However latest public Cmder version (1.2.9) doesn't include this merge yet.\n. > It fixes the multiline bug\n@vvartivarian-nbcu, how is it fixes that? The problem is in the https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/config/cmder.lua#L139, which is a part of Cmder\n. @thekot, the issue exists already (https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/clink-completions/issues/36) and fixed :smile:\n. @arcanedev-maroc, @daxgames, This might happen because of outdated clink distribution. Mine is v0.4.6 [git:82fc65] and I don't see this problem. Could you please post your clink version here?\n. Also tried to upgrade to latest clink (v0.4.7 [git:dfc95a]) - no issues as well\n. I'll add my opinion: IMO if the user has Git already installed, Cmder shouldn't change user experience around Git in any way, i.e. 1) do not force user to use bundled Git instead of already installed one; 2) do not modify GIT_INSTALL_PATH, as this potentially may affect other tools/commands, launched from Cmder session.\nSo my proposal about detecting alghoritm is:\n1. Check if GIT_INSTALL_PATH is set and use that Git instalation \n2. If it doesn't - check if where git returns anything and use returned path as a Git installation \n3. If nothing returned - use bundled Git\n. @MartiUK, you meant this line?\n. It would be great if this will improve perfomance, but i recall that we've been relying on git already at some moment before #438 and there were some perf issues... Unfortunately, git on Windows is not so super-fast as on Nix machines :(\n. Made some timings, and the results are not very promising (the timings are in 1/100 sec, measurements are made for directories, placed on SSD):\n|  | Current | Using git rev-parse |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Non-git directory | 0 | 0.22 |\n| Git repo | 0.30 | 0.55 |\nSo IMO it's better to keep the current approach. Personally for me it's not very comfortable to wait ~0.5 sec each time before thr prompt updates.\nHere is the gist with git_prompt_filter function, that uses git rev-parse and prints nice results: https://gist.github.com/vladimir-kotikov/ef164c3baa8b80bd30b0\n. Just printouts, exactly the same as in the gist\n. Dupe of #753 and #689 and was fixed already in clink@0.4.6 (see https://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/352)\n. Dupe of #700\n. @jmiazga, does this happen only in this particular directory, or in every git repo?\nCould you please paste the output of git rev-parse --git-dir --is-inside-git-dir --is-bare-repository --is-inside-work-tree (@MartiUK, this is still a nice way to debug :smile: )\n. Hm, that's strange. Just checked and the content of config/cmder.lua from 1.2.9 is strictly equal to the one from 1.2.0. So it seems the only reason is the different git versions.\n. It will when commit appear in master branch. It has been merged into development yet.\n. :+1: And another one - we won't need anymore for these massive pre-release merges dev -> master :smile: \n. :+1: \n. Totally agree with @JanSchulz about \n\nbut on the other hand also see it as a duplication of e.g. chocolatey\n\nI'm curious, what is the benefits of using this feature instead of chocolatey? (which basically does the same thisngs from user perspective - installs stuff, adds it to the %PATH%...). Personally i don't like the idea of adding functionality that could be easily achieved using other well-known and wide spread tools.\n. Ok, so what is the usecase? If you have some environment, which you want to have synced on every machine you use, it's easier to set up it manually once than create a declarative way to install it when you need it.\nFrom the other side, if you want an ability to reproduce the environment on any machine, then it might be a good approach, but in this case IMO it is still better to reuse choco, plus some scripts to bind installed packages to Cmder.\nAlso, @daxgames, how do you plan to maintain these plugins, roll out updates, etc.?\n. @daxgames, sorry, I didn't want to criticize your approach so agressively.\nI'd love to have the functionality to easily set up my most-used tools to work with cmder, the only thing that concerns me it that using this approach we'll end up having Cmder directory really huge, since every plugin will install all stuff into vendor directory.\n. @MartiUK, just another idea about how this could be used by Cmder - add-cmderplugin might be a part of Cmder build/pack process - for example we could have Cmder core (the thing that called now Cmder mini) and additional functionality which is added to core/packed using this script.\n. Maybe chcp 65001?\n. This should be fixed in 0.2.2 which is a part of latest Cmder. Guys, could you please check the latest build before? \n. So, it works as expected with latest build?\nI just can confirm it WFM with completions@0.2.2\n. @c33s, i meant this build https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/artifacts which incledes completions@0.2.2 with the fix for git add\n. @Daniel15, you probably can fix it by either switching to 1.3.0-pre at https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/tag/v1.3.0-pre or getting a latest version of clink-completions and unzipping it to your Cmder/vendor directory\n. @davidcsi, this probably need to be implemented in ConEmu, similar to \"search\" feature, so you'd better ask @Maximus5 about that\n. @borekb, I could you please elaborate? You're seeing the error message when running Cmder from Onedrive directory? Or you see this on some particular machine and do not see it on other?\n. It works as intended - see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout\n\ngit checkout [-p|--patch] [<tree-ish>] [--] <pathspec>\u2026\u200b\nWhen  or --patch are given, git checkout does not switch branches. It updates the named paths in the working tree from the index file or from a named  (most often a commit).\n. Yup, fixed in https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/commit/75deb4f94544e299d2920b357bb5cbf0cf96c8ab\n. :arrow_up: 0.3.1 ;-)\n. Wooooohoooo! :)\n. This has been fixed in https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/clink-completions/pull/64 and released in 0.3.2, so hopefully will be available in next Cmder release.\n\n/cc @Stanzilla\n. @ByteCommander, I'm not quite sure I completely understand so just to clarify - are you running into this problem w/ clink-completions@0.3.2? Could you make sure your npm.lua is identical to one from 0.3.2 release. @Stanzilla np \ud83d\udc4d . /cc @Stanzilla @daxgames as the most active contributors nowadays. \ud83d\udc4d Feel free to do so. Let me know if you need anything from my side. \n. Not sure if it would work but I can add you guys as a maintainers so you can then transfer it to cmderdev yourself. Agree. Done in https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/cmder/commit/dba00b9175c5e90d7a28d562d8dc117f7516c46f\n. IMHO, since %_x% usage is not needed in arguments check (line 10) then it is better to move its definition to actual usage here.\n. Probably no need to replace %* with %_x% here because if  [\"%_x%\"] == [\"\"] then [\"%*\"] == [\"\"] will be true as well.\n. Double negation makes this check unreadable.

As per the initial request, this will never happen, unless cmd is open sourced (good luck) and the expansion rules changed. The recommended workaround is to stop using cmd and use powershell.\n. I'm closing this as I would prefer cmder to not force a package manager on the user, if you want to use chocolatey .etc, install that as you would normally.\n. @bliker Yes, I was wondering why you merged it, I have some more commits to pull, but very busy.\n. Most of them (the duplicates) do not work for me anyway, especially the\nperl scripts.\n On 2 Jan 2014 23:59, \"Samuel Vasko\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWell I wanted to work on it myself and I just about finished it.

This is definitely fixed in the latest version.\n. Austin, could this be used to allow right click > \"cmder here\" functionality on folders in Explorer? Currently ConEmu prevents you from using the cmder config xml in fast configuration with \"ConEmu Here/ConEmu Inside\"...\n\n\n. @Jackbennett Completely forgot about that, thanks.\n. Right now you'll need to install: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm\nand add the directory you installed it to, to your %PATH%. (Can't remember if it does this already)\nOR\nInstall the above package into your cmder/bin/ folder.\nI can have a look at this tonight but increasing the size of the install just for wget or even coreutils for everyone is probably not a good idea.\n. Does this still happen?\n. I have some more changes to come, hold fire for the moment.\n. You can do a pull request to the gitcleanup branch on my fork and it should add it to this pull request... I think.\n. I have some updates to push, preventing commands with '--'s to be deleted (breaking the commands in progress).\nOne last thing, there is another way to fix this problem. During the build, delete the exes and then have cmder use an extra aliases file removing the need for a complex batch file creation script.\n@bliker I'll make this as a separate pull request for you to ultimately decide.\n. Hi @AndreyUtka The next release should have a launcher included, you should be able to pin the launcher to your taskbar.\n. @AndreyUtka It's up to @bliker for the release time.\n. Issue is closed upstream.\n. Hi @gsbabil, does this still affect you on version 1.1.3?\n. @gsbabil May be a Win 8 specific problem since it works just fine on Win 7 64bit, will look at it tonight.\n. I've got some changes to be pushed to the xplauncher branch. In currently figuring out how to build specifically for xp .etc\n. For everyone who's affected by this please try the xplauncher branch.\n. @perlun it's currently in the development branch\n. I've used Visual C++ 2013 Express to build it and it was fine.\n. @benavern Did you compile it under DebugXP or ReleaseXP configuration?\n. @benavern Right sorry, I can try and get a pre-pre-XP Release up tonight (UK time) but I would prefer to not have any more binary files in the repo. And keep them only in releases.\n. @benavern Done, check the releases. Let me know how it goes.\n. Thanks for testing it out, I will close this issue as this will be in the next release. :+1: \n. Perfect, thanks!\n. I'll investigate this, I have the same issues and can be up to 10 seconds before I can do anything.\n. @sc0tt So this works for me.\nNow would we want this disabled to prevent this happening for new users (will not allow users to change cursor position with mouse click) or leave it enabled and put it in the readme?\n. This will be in the next release.\n. I'll volunteer if no one else is available to.\n. Thanks, I'll look after it. :thumbsup:\n. You can choose a startup directory for new tasks in the settings. Right here:\n\nAlthough cmder will always default to it's directory unless you change that in the task. (The new_console command)\n. One thing I can suggest is piping the command into a more command for example:\nthiscommandproducesmanylines.exe | more\nYour suggestion is probably something that needs to be added to ConEmu, best to ask there.\n. Would you be able to gist/pastebin your ConEmu.xml so I can replicate the exact conditions?\n. Do you get the same error when it's not in your dropbox folder? (on your Win8 PC)\n. Hi could you retry downloading cmder.7z and extract it to a folder on your desktop and let me know what happens?\n. Have you tried running cmder.exe as Administrator?\n. This is due to, as you found out after uninstalling clink, that cmder injects it already.\nSee init.bat:\n@\"%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\clink\\clink_x%architecture%.exe\" inject --quiet --profile \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\"\nI wouldn't support it but configure your own click using the same parameters.\n. What happens when you run straight from the exe?\n. Try changing https://github.com/bliker/cmder/blob/master/vendor/init.bat#L23\nfrom cygwin to xterm.\n. What happens when you use plink through the standard cmd.exe?\n. It's because putty reads UTF-8 just fine and plink (by itself) does not.\nAlso, is there a reason why you aren't using the built in ssh.exe? \n\nTry using just ssh in cmder.\n. Great Thanks.\n. Do we want this for 1.1.4 considering the xp build nuances?\n. Hey this is great! Can I add this to the wiki? I'll make sure to give credit where credit's due.\n. I'm not experiencing this, I've pinned cmder.exe from the 1.1.3 release.\n\n. @lowjoel From what I understand, Conemu retrieves the icon and config through CreateProcess. The STARTUPINFO and PROCESS_INFORMATION is passed through this as well. This hasn't changed since it was first commited by @austinwagner so using the launcher from #159 shouldn't have broken this.\nI'll have to look into why this is not working for some, I think it may be something to do with https://github.com/bliker/cmder/blob/master/launcher/src/CmderLauncher.cpp#L13\n. The only pattern I can see here is that you are all unzipping to Program Files / (x86), I don't receive this issue and I have it extracted to my desktop. hmm. Maybe permission issues? Are you changing the option in #251 also?\n. @Bujutsu This is how I've always done it.\n. Thanks!\n. Hi @fanGit, could you try again after unchecking Monospace?\n. Hi @mtz could you try downloading this: https://github.com/bliker/cmder/releases/tag/v1.1.4-xplauncher, overwrite cmder.exe and try again?\n. Settings > Keys & Macro > Mark/Copy > Text selection (Change Left Shift to )\n. Instead of telling you how to do it, here is the documentation: https://conemu.github.io/en/TableOfContents.html\n. Cheers.\n. If you aren't able to input it into clean conemu. Then it's an upstream problem, I was going to suggest it might be clink since that does take an Alt-$whatever combination for a few cases.\n. Sorry, this is likely due to how Parallels is virtualizing cmder. I would suggest looking up their support around flickering windows in coherence.\n. Have you tried unticking Auto size in combination with monospace on and off?\n. @DeathKing Does it happen to you when using standard conemu? https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/\n. @DeathKing No problem.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. @sweiss3 You can recover a -D'd branch using git fsck git fsck --full --no-reflogs --unreachable --lost-found and recreating the branch git checkout -b branch-name SHA\nSo I think autocompleting for -D shouldn't be an issue. Really people should be checking what they've typed in before you do a -d or -D anyway.\n. Have you tried stock conemu? https://conemu.codeplex.com/\n. I would suggest you create an issue with ConEmu: http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/issues/list\n. In your cmder/vendor/init.bat\nChange git_install_root to where your msysgit is located.\n. I see, I guess we can put it in the docs. Some people might not want this as default? I would rather it be a command to run rather than force it.\n. This is due to the init script not handling ampersands correctly:\nhttps://github.com/bliker/cmder/blob/master/vendor/init.bat#L27\nWe will probably need to change how we set up the PATH in the init script.\nFor now try adding a '^' before the '&' in you PATH, let me know if that works?\n. DelayedExpansion doesn't really work unfortunately, I would suggest wrapping directories with ampersands with double quotes.\n. This will be done for 1.2.\n. I've move the milestone to 1.3 for now.\n. @patricksnape What happenes when you run the tasks through a standard cmd.exe? or even running powershell in cmder?\n. Have you tried putting the publickey it in your %USERPROFILE%/.ssh folder?\n. If someone adds a pull request to add the file there shouldn't be a problem.\n. See the wiki page about integrating cygwin and thus zsh & tmux.\n. @mickaelandrieu I'm trying to keep cmder as a basic platform for people to add things onto it, I don't want to distribute anything other than the basics (cmd, powershell for example). As I put into the contributing.md, it might be useful for you and for what you're doing but for the other 1000s of people using cmder it will just be wasted space/download.\n. @mickaelandrieu I have recently made a guide on the wiki to integrate cygwin, you can use zsh + tmux through that?\n. While this might not be a good idea for @mridgers and clink itself, but, for cmder, where the users should only use x86 or AMD64 this wouldn't hurt.\n. Thanks :thumbsup: \n. Change this line:\nhttps://github.com/bliker/cmder/blob/master/vendor/init.bat#L17\nTo the location of your own install of clink and remove the clink install in the vendor folder.\n.

Hi @c4d3r thanks for using cmder, what version and what download (mini, full, 7z) are you using?\nThanks.\n. Thanks guys.\n. Have you tried the 7z?\n. Could all of you run clink in cmder and let me know if you get something similar to this:\n``\n\u03bb clink\nClink v0.4.2 [git:1111eb] Copyright (c) 2014 Martin Ridgers\nhttp://mridgers.github.io/clink`\nUsage:  \nVerbs:\n  inject   Injects Clink into a process.\n  autorun  Manage Clink's entry in cmd.exe's autorun.\n  set      Adjust Clink's settings.\n           (' --help' for more details).\n```\n. I'm not surprised it's to do with AV. Hopefully you guys can white list cmder from active virus scans.\n. @nivinj Clink doesn't support Win10, see #279.\n. I won't support the Chocolatey install since it has never worked correctly for me and it not maintained anymore.\nTry the 7z for 1.1.3 here: https://github.com/bliker/cmder/releases\n.

Could you create an issue here: https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/issues/list Thanks.\n. What happens when you unzip it to your documents or desktop, does it run correctly then?\n. Looks fine to me, thanks.\n. This is used from the build.ps1 script, are you running it from there?\n. Sorry man, I'm expecting more trouble for those who don't have %HOME% defined.\n. Alright, alright.\n. The dlls were rolled back for some reason, I'll re release asap.\n. Yeah, my fault. I'll fix ASAP.\n. The problem is deciding whether or not the user wants to actually start in the current directory or start in their %HOME%. \n. This isn't really needed, but thanks anyway.\n. If you look in the {cmd} task, you can see that the icon is set in the task parameters.\nAuto save/restore has only been enabled in the latest version but as you can see the parameters have not been carried over. I've created an issue here: http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/issues/detail?id=1697\n. I've updated the release binaries for 1.4.1.1, no need to re-release. A good reminder to stick to your gut feelings.\n. @narnaud If people want that then they can edit the {cmd} task within cmder.\n. Duplicate of #251.\n. This will be fixed in the next version, icons were being excluded in the pack script. See https://github.com/bliker/cmder/commit/e95127268ed71f2151356c72d31852b3fe4451fa\n. Coul you re-pull this into the development branch? thanks.\n. Hi, can you set monospace off in the settings and let me know how that goes?\n. Create an issue here: http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/wiki/Issues?tm=3\n. Have a go with standard conemu, if it doesn't work on that create an issue there.\n. Very interesting! Could you redo the pull request into cmder/development? That'll make it easier for others (including me) to make changes (if needed) before going into master.\n. I'll try to have a test of it tonight.\n. Could you re-pull this into the development branch? Thanks\n. You're both quick off the mark!\n@vitaminj This is indeed a clink issue, https://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/253\n. I'll close this once Clink has a new release, but if you really need cmder working on Win10 then use the build in https://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/253\n. Should be fixed in 1.2 release.\n. You'll probably need to do something like this:\n$CMDER_LOCATION\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu.exe /Icon \"$CMDER_LOCATION\\cmder\\icons\\cmder.ico\" /Title Cmder /LoadCfgFile \"$CMDER_LOCATION\\cmder\\config\\ConEmu.xml\"\nOR\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\" /k \"$CMDER_LOCATION\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\..\\init.bat\n. @mdesign83 It isn't technically running cmder in IntelliJ, just the initialisation scripts that cmder uses.\n. Did this start happening when you moved your Documents folder? I haven't moved mine and I don't have the error.\n. Could you redo the pull request into the development branch? Thanks.\n. Have a look at this: https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/wiki/AnsiEscapeCodes#Xterm_256_color_map\n. Because ~ being aliased to $HOME is a feature of bash, cmder runs cmd.exe or powershell which supports ~ .\n. Use %HOME% instead of tilde or use PowerShell (in cmder it's ALT + SHIFT + 2)\n. @brunobatista Unless Microsoft release the source code of cmd.exe or you switch to powershell or bash, no sorry.\n. Could you re-pull this into the development branch? Thanks.\n. This can be changed in the Keys & Macros section of the settings:\n\n. Good catch.\n. Could you re-pull this into development? Thanks.\n. You couldn't have known! I've rectified this by creating a CONTRIBUTING file in the master branch.\nI prefer all changes to be put into the development branch so I can test all the changes before I release a new version.\n. Not on my A-game today.\n. Thanks.\n. Thanks\n. My only suggestions is to try vim with cygwin or maybe try term=xterm-256color\n. Have you tried it in a standard cmd.exe? If it happens there then it's not an issue with cmder. Sorry.\n. This is a problem with msysgit's echo... I don't know why it doesn't handle quotes correctly.\n. While a good idea (I use vim powerline on my Linux PCs) I don't see this being good for everyone, I'd rather cmder be a good platform for people to use but not forcing things on people. Sorry!\nFor your font issues, you need to install patched fonts on windows: https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts\n. Have you set the font as cmder's default font?\n. I believe it's something to do with C:\\Users\\$USER\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WinX, I'm not too sure since I'm not using a Win 10 machine at the moment.\n. @Jackbennett The blog link worked fine for me, I can see the instructions there.\nIf a user wants to change it, they can do it themselves, we shouldn't go any further than what's sensible. Conemu can 'replace' conhost (i.e. hook whenever cmd is launched) but it's a global change, it doesn't change the default windows shell shortcuts that a lot of people use (and it shouldn't).\n. Thanks.\n. It looks like you were struggling to access the conemu update server, disabling the updater shouldn't be an issue since you get the updates with cmder updates.\n. Because it was merged into master by mistake, are you going to pull request it into the development branch?\n. Thanks.\n. cmd does not do command substitution, you could probably run that in powershell (Press ctrl + alt + 2 in cmder) just fine.\nIf you really want to use cmd do:\ngit diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD^^ > diff.txt\nSET /p DIFF=<diff.txt\ngit archive -o archive.zip HEAD^ %DIFF%\nDEL diff.txt\n. Sorry shift + alt + 2\n. Could you re-open this into the development branch? Thanks.\n. Do you have clink installed already?\n. The clink you have installed is conflicting with clink that's included with the full install.\nYou have two options:\nUninstall clink and use cmder as is.\nOr\n(I don't know if this will work)\nRemove the clink directory from the vendor folder and adjust this line in init.bat: \nhttps://github.com/bliker/cmder/blob/master/vendor/init.bat#L22\nto something like:\n:: Run clink\n@\"clink_x%architecture%.exe\" inject --quiet --profile \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\"\nIf clink is in your PATH already.\n. Clink is included with cmder already.\n. Does sshpass even have a Windows binary? Are you using cygwin?\n. Either way it's up to @denisvolokh on how to proceed with his issue.\n. Does this disable the borders for new users? Can you access the settings menu without having to use the kb shortcut?\n. Still asking to be merged into master!\n. That's better!\n. This will never happen, I suggest using PowerShell in cmder if you desperately want ~ aliased.\n. Create a shortcut of the exe and pin that.\n. Strange... Doesn't happen for me, have you added anything or changed any settings from the default?\n. Thanks.\n. If you have SVN installed and on your PATH it should work fine, SVN isn't distributed with cmder.\n. clear is already aliased to cls, if that's what you're trying to do?\n. If you type cls, it should work. If you type clear it should work the same as it is aliased to cls. You don't need to alias it again!\n. Have you tried running ssh with ssh -v or ssh -vvv and seeing the output?\n. This has been fixed in the latest version see #109 if you've re-enabled the left-click to move the cursor then I'm not surprised.\n.

There has been a few times where people have reported this and each time I have advised them to report this false postive to their AV provider, personally I use the built in Windows Defender on my Win 8.1 machine and I have no issues with cmder.\nIf you want to confirm its just you, try uploading the file that it flagged to Virus Total.\n. could you re-pull this into the development branch? thanks.\n. Maybe :tm:\nI need to look into other issues but if you find out what it is be sure to send off a pull request.\n. I'll look into that for the next release, the packignore file doesn't specify that the icons folder is to be ignored.\n. Thanks.\n. The latest clink version fixes this and I'm releasing a new version of cmder with clink very soon...\n. Could you pull this into the development branch? Thanks.\n. great thanks.\n. This has been fixed in the latest version but if you want to fix it yourself, untick this option:\nhttps://github.com/bliker/cmder/issues/109#issuecomment-31736141\n. I do not maintain the chocolatey version of cmder, my only suggestion is to try an official release here on GitHub and try using that.\n. By default msysgit uses %HOME%\\.ssh\nSo In your case that would be C:\\Users\\Willem\\.ssh\n. Just to clarify, the folder you have your keys in is C:\\Users\\Willem.ssh not C:\\Users\\Willem\\.ssh?\n. If you run ssh -v git@github.com where is it looking for the identity files? Mine for example says debug1: identity file /c/Users/Martin/.ssh/id_rsa type 1\n. @willemdh If you're trying to ssh to your boot2docker you need to specify the id file you want ssh to use i.e. ssh -i c:\\Users\\Willem\\.ssh\\id_boot2docker username@hostname\nto make ssh use it all the time add this into your .ssh/config file\nHost hostname\n  IdentityFile C:\\Users\\Willem\\.ssh\\id_boot2docker\n. @willemdh Ah, that's another way of doing it.\n. @Ciwan1859 Have you added the key to the ssh-agent?. Who told you to move the binary files into a bin folder?\n. @Limro That's for other binaries or programs you want to use, why would we ask you to move the cmder launcher binaries yourself?\n. @Limro The normal usecase is for you to have it anywhere you like but launching it using the launcher executable (cmder.exe), from what it sounds like you are opening up a powershell instance and then using that to run cmder. cmder is your terminal emulator/console/'dos prompt' as it runs cmd, powershell or whatever for you.\n. @Limro No problem :+1: \n. Probably best to have it in a location where you have permissions. I have it on the desktop for example, but have a shortcut to the cmder.exe in the taskbar.\n. what happens when you run git-p4?\n. oh-my-git requires sh which cmder doesn't distribute (as arguably this is for windows users), you can open cygwin with cmder which you could use to get the prompt.\n. You will have to find or rewrite oh-my-git to work with cmd or powershell.\n. time is usually builtin to bash or zsh, so msysgit doesn't include it.\n. You can try something like bash -c 'time cmd /C \"echo hello\"' although I can't figure out why cmd isn't terminating \n. @keradus I'd suggest running it with cygwin then, I've recently added a guide to the wiki here: https://github.com/bliker/cmder/wiki/Integrating-Cygwin\n. It's here and should appear when opening any pull request. https://github.com/bliker/cmder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n. :+1: Looks good to me Thanks.\n. Could you sort out your pull request, you're pulling in other commits.\n. Alright no problem. Thanks anyway.\n. This will be fixed in the next version.\n. @1ClickComputing Sorry but cmder is intended to be portable and standalone (or non-invasive as @Jackbennett said), so dropping registry entries by default into every PC is not an option.\n. LGTM thanks. :+1: \n. Thanks.\n. @sinrise What version are you running? do you have git already installed and on your PATH already?\n. @nihilon That's what I meant by having git already installed.\n. Just to be sure, are you running an exe you compiled yourself or the one included in the repo?\n. Could you write some documentation about your change, for new users?\n. Is there a need to include the computer name env variable in the filename? I guess the standard now is to have these user- files available.\n. Sounds good to me.\n. Have you run a build using build.ps1, and does it extract the file fine?\n. @vladimir-kotikov just commit your changes into your dev branch and let me know when it's ready to be pulled in.\n. Thanks.\n. There is an options in Settings > Startup to autosave/restore opened tabs.\n. If that isn't what you want, you can create your own task in setting and give it all the tabs you want and then start that task and in Startup options set that task as the startup.\n. This will be fixed in the next version, as we are using the latest version of conemu.\n. This has been fixed upstream for a long time now.\n. I've been weary about chocolatey, as previously they've had a complete lack of moderation and verification of packages (including cmder), the complete opposite strategy compared to how Linux distros handle their packages.\nIt seems that chocolatey is now working on moderation, I may consider it, but where will cmder fall into this, will we distribute just conemu + cmder tweaks and let choco handle everything else or shall we push for allowing optional vendors which we can look after in https://github.com/cmderdev/vendors?\nOr even a completely different option?\nEven in the Linux world there isn't just 1 package manager.\n. This is kind of where I'm going with the vendors repo, we have a base set of 3rd party packages and optional packages that can be added in by us or users after we verify they do indeed work. There's no reason we can't include the ability to have PS modules integrate these packages, especially as it seems to be just adding their own Env variables most of the time.\nThinking about it, chocolatey packages are available system wide once they're installed, meaning users would have already been able to access them through cmder anyway, which was part of the reason why I closed the original issue.\n. I don't know for certain what Git you have installed but try moving %SystemDrive%\\Strawberry\\perl\\bin further left before %git_install_root% as I have perl.exe in my globally installed git.\n. @Muzical84 No problem, I usually forget (I had to look it up again now) but Windows reads %PATH% left to right and uses whatever it finds first.\n. tmux doesn't exactly work in conemu, when using this method. Tmux is a bit finicky with what terminal it wants, especially if it's on a non-Unix system.\nTry setting up a new task except have it run\n C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\mintty.exe -i /Cygwin-Terminal.ico - (If you installed it in the default location)\nWhere it should work.\nIf you don't want to do that, may I suggest GNU Screen?\n. I'd hazard a guess that mysql is trying to spawn another cmd.exe window before running but I. I don't use mysql (at least on windows) is there a binary you can run that just runs the mysql command line tool by itself?\n. Settings > Startup > Auto save/restore opened tabs\n. This should be fixed in the development branch.\n. The next version should have support for ssh-agent, allowing you to remember the password. See #352 \n. Could you re-pull this into the development branch? Thanks.\n. You may be confusing msys, a part of mingw with msysgit, msysgit only contains enough of the msys utilities to allow git to function correctly on windows. If you want to get gcc working, I suggest installing mingw and see how that goes, you may need to mess around with your PATH env variable but it should work as soon as you install it, like if you were using standard cmd.\n. Try unchecking monospace see here https://github.com/bliker/cmder/issues/45\n. @arcanedev-maroc We're already using it, see the development branch.\n. @arcanedev-maroc 1.2.9 has git-for-windows. You can find some builds on appveyor, see here https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/1.0.119-development/artifacts for example but don't expect them to be fully functional and they may have bugs\n. What is $TERM set as when you ssh in? It should be xterm or similar.\nAlso, are you leaving the terminal alone (as in no input) for a while before it starts becoming garbled? Have a look at ssh keepalive in this case: https://sysadmincasts.com/episodes/39-cli-monday-how-to-keep-your-ssh-sessions-alive (Check the text below the video)\n. Are you having issues with the newest version?\n. Sorry, the only thing I can suggest is to set cmder as a trusted executable or something like that.\n. Thanks @RNiK and @erikhakansson for sending the reports.\n. I've just attached an archive with the dll in, could you try extracting that to your cmder directory?\n. c4873c6e5813e5c253ae32ba68123d2694b422ce I've reverted the VS2015 change.\n. @avimar @Stanzilla It will be uploaded in a few hours, just testing it on a lot of VMs.\n. @denisw There isn't much we can do unfortunately, overriding built in security protections isn't something I'm willing to do, even though I feel they're a bit heavy handed.\n. 1.2.9?\n. Some people have reported they needed to install both x86 and x64 redistributables to get it to work correctly.\n. You can switch back to cmd in Settings > Startup and changing {PowerShell} to {cmd}, I'm working on a history function for PowerShell right now.\n. I don't think the psreadline module is installed by default with cmder 1.2? Unless everyone has WMF5 installed, which I don't think is true.\nAnother check after the git check to let the user know about psreadline would suffice, I think.\n. In powershell or cmd?\n. The issue is that PowerShell 2 and below doesn't support $PSScriptRoot, I'm working on something that should let those with PS2 to work, though if you don't want to wait, install PowerShell 3 or above.\nOr switch to cmd through Setting > Startup > {PowerShell} to {cmd}\n. c15e29ecb30e450c295f08651f4446fc026ea2a2 Should fix this.\n@Jackbennett \n. Try the new archives I've uploaded. Thanks.\n. Duplicate of #482 \n. @Stanzilla I'm not dead or anything, just busy with work and my fianc\u00e9e is quite ill at the moment and needs care. Don't worry I will try to get a portable version up and running soon.\n. See #483.\n. I have made the decision to revert back to VC2013, since the re-distributable dlls are easily available to be packaged with the archives.\n. @Sabrethan Compiling it now\n. Duplicate of #482 .\n. That's really odd, I wonder if it's setting the background colour as well as the foreground color, I don't know my PHP but it looks like the offending code is here: https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh/blob/master/src/Psy/Output/ShellOutput.php#L198\nWhich uses symfony to set the colour: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/2.7/src/Symfony/Component/Console/Formatter/OutputFormatterStyle.php\nIs there a default background colour it's assuming is there? \n. @OlegGavrilov I'm looking into it, VC2015 doesn't look very portable, as there's no solid redistributable dlls I can find, I have made the decision to revert back to VC2013 for the time being since the dlls are easily found.\n. clink-completions only affects the completions, the replacement of {git} is handled in cmder.lua.\nFor why you're seeing {hg} I don't know, I'm running W7 SP1 and I can't see {hg} at all when in a git repo, did you overwrite an older version?\n. The PATH variable is actually in the config.xml, so I'll remove that, the Powershell one, I think references the last opened tab which in this case is the {PowerShell} task.\n. Have you changed any settings?\n. Duplicate of #483, check the last comment.\n. Could you re-pull this into development? Thanks.\n. @Maximus5 Should be 150513\n. this is fixed: https://github.com/bliker/cmder/commit/29d1378d7afaa7bd8f78bf7cb72e524ef9556fe0\n. Cmder, (specifically ConEmu) is a windows terminal emulator, when you use putty it deals with the POSIX command sequences correctly because it's designed to be used to ssh into a POSIX system.\nWhat I would suggest is, to save a configuration with all the correct settings in putty and load that like this:\nplink.exe -load $session -l $user_name -pw $password \nreplacing the parameters as needed\n. @coreyman the defaults, if they work for you.\n. Thanks.\n. Will be fixed in the next release, C++ re-distributable dlls will be included.\n. Have you asked AVG to add it to the global whitelist?\n. I'm sure they have.\n. You're not helping yourself by swearing all the time, you need to specify what exactly you were doing and what was happening when you were doing it. Try attaching screenshots.\n. If Google translate is accurate, I haven't removed the cmd task.\nYou can change the default task by going into Settings > Startup and changing {PowerShell} to \n{cmd}.\n. @umayr Add cygwin as per wiki and install fish shell?\n. @Stanzilla Would adding a space after the lambda solve this issue?\n. PRs are encouraged @Stanzilla as long as your changes don't break everything there's no reason why.\n. #772\n. Thanks.\n. Any reason why you've changed the optimization settings in the .vcxproj?\n. @DoCode Ah cool, just noticed this is being pulled into master, would it be possible to re-pull to development? Thanks\n. It'll put the entry in HKEY_CURRENT_USER if it's set to run with /USER\n. @rmorrin We're working on it, watch this space.\n. @DanielGGordon See @Maximus5's comment: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/628#issuecomment-143799317\n. Could you re-pull this into development please.\n. @pavelkouril Yes, please.\n. While large, this isn't as messy as it seems. It might need some manual merging when we get to it.\n. Does the same issue happen when running the same commands with cmd?\n. Same issue as #628 \n. @pavelkouril ANSI escape codes much like how colours are displayed do control the cursor position, if vim isn't reporting the codes correctly as in #628, then this would also be a similar issue.\n. 1. I believe only the .ico file is needed.\n2. The tmp folder can be safely ignored, this is for building only.\n. I have a better idea.\n. The big FAIL means it's worked YAY :tada: \n. Really squashed that one.\n. A Microsoft made application, that doesn't support UTF-8? Colour me surprised. :laughing: \n. I did those last few commits to martiuk-dev with vim... on my phone. Is that too far?\nI usually use vim on Linux or sublime text 3 on Qindows.\n. Yep, make sure your sftp application is on your PATH.\n. Thanks @DanielGGordon.\n@Alxandr,\nI'm not having this issue when running node under PS or cmd in an unmodified 1.2.9 build, ctrl + C is being sent straight away.\n. Is Settings > Startup > \"Auto save/restore opened tabs\" not enough?\n. Settings in ConEmu isn't up to me, opening an issue here: https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu could help.\nWe have our own wiki, but there isn't much there at the moment.\n. @DoCode CMDER_START is still not being set as of the latest development build.\n. What shell are you using?\n. This has been fixed in the latest pre-release version.\n. Duplicate of #553 \n. Settings > Main > Tab Bar then look at the Console settings and change it to how you want it to be.\n. Git-for-windows works fine out of the box for what most users need. You can contribute a guide in the wiki to replacing git-for-windows with a standard install of msys2 if you like?\n. This has been fixed in clink 0.4.6, which is already part of cmder.\n. Same for PowerShell as well really, should we keep the doskey syntax and write something to parse it for bash and Ps? Or have something completely different?\n. Use the latest pre-release as this does not require these dlls.\n. Why are you replacing cmd with bash? Is this something you think everyone is going to want?\n. @cmderdev/owners @cmderdev/trusted-contributors LGTM :+1:, any thoughts?\n. Would you be able to write some documentation up on your changes @daxgames? For new users.\n. @DanielGGordon run git status it should tell you what branch you're on. If you've checked out @daxgames's fork then you should run git checkout msys-bash.\n. @daxgames Any instructions needed in the readme. Any changes to key bindings I can put on the website.\n. Download the latest pre-release from here: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases\n. Only thing we can do is report that binary as legitimate to Microsoft, a lot more than just cmder uses msysgit.\n. Another thing you can do is use the latest pre-release as we use git-for-windows now rather than msysgit.\n. How does performance fluctuate, is it based on how you split the window or does it still grind to a crawl when atom is in it's own tab?\n. Done!\n. @vBm It won't happen again!\n. It worked perfectly.\n. You've got it set correctly, setting it to 1 auto-answers yes, but 2 auto-answers no.\nWithout seeing the gulp file there's no way I can help you with this, perhaps check how your gulpfile is starting the watch process, if it starts it in an extra cmd.exe it will auto answer this first cmd.exe but fail on the second one.\n. try running gulp like gulp watch < nul or use PowerShell :sunglasses:\n. You'll avoid the terminate batch job (Y/N)? prompts altogether. It's newer, and much more user friendly. The problem is Microsoft never updates it on your machine through windows update, so you can install the latest \"stable\" version here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40855\n. It's because shells like cmd and powershell don't handle the space in \"Program Files\" well. \nWhy is cmder in your Program Files? Extract it to your desktop or your $HOME, it'll work then.\nI've created an issue for you.\n. Any possibility of moving that last commit to a separate pull request? It has nothing to do with fixing the icons :smile: \n. Thanks.\n. We can't do anything about this, please report the false positive to your anti-virus vendor.\n. The code that looks for these should default to a standard profile if they're not found. Are you asking for a single file to do what they all do at once?\n. Oh right yeah :confounded:\n+1 to this.\n. Looks good to me, thanks!\n. We try to keep up to date, especially with ConEmu as it has a very rapid release cycle. I can see we're a version behind already in the development branch.\nI've had an idea for a dependency updater, but I haven't started any work on it.\n. Thanks.\n. The version of conemu you mention 150813c is behind what we are currently targeting in development, (151119 as of https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/commit/a3e2d7546d19d5cead20cc4783c1c7fc42624454). I would suggest this be closed unless you can reproduce it with that version.\n. @daxgames go for it\n. Have you tried raising this issue on their project page? https://github.com/git-for-windows/git\n. Try one of the builds here: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/1.0.117-development/artifacts This is built from the latest sources in the dev branch, and should include curl 7.45 from git-for-windows.\n. Yeah that's annoying, I suggest you open an issue on the git-for-windows page, curl needs to be compiled with SSPI.\nhttps://github.com/git-for-windows/MSYS2-packages/blob/master/curl/PKGBUILD This file doesn't have the required switch enabled for it to be built with SSPI support.\n. As @sekai92id said, be sure to uninstall clink as we already include it.\n. ls is aliased to --show-control-chars here : https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/development/vendor/aliases.example#L3\nYou should either delete that alias from $CMDER_ROOT/config/aliases or stop using unxutils.\n. How are you running it?\n. It's a false positive, please report this to your antivirus vendor.\n. IIRC this is because there is no history for conemu to use on first use, so it duplicates the prompt based on how you resize.\nIf you run some commands and try this again, you'll notice it'll use your history rather than repeating the prompt.\n. This has been fixed in clink 0.4.6, which is already part of cmder.\n. Have you tried installing the full version of cmder?\n. @thany Do you want to run the file every time or just the once?. Thanks, you're the first to recognise that :+1: \n. A lot of this is resolved in the CI builds, newer versions of completions in cmd and powershell are a lot faster.\nI'm hoping to have a pre-release available soon.\n. Can you confirm after whitelisting the exes in your antivirus?. or someone who can translate please?\n. You need to set your execution policy so you can run powershell scripts such as the profile script included with cmder.\n. Ah, sorry, run Unblock-File Profile.ps1. Windows sometimes blocks scripts downloaded from the internet.\n. I haven't made these changes yet, but it should fix most issues regarding /START.\n. The problem with cmder_here stems from the fact that the tasks do not use CMDER_START as an initial directory to work with. Which is part of this issue.\n. @JanSchulz See #803 also.\n. You need to add it to the init.bat or profile.ps1, when you add it to the task in the settings it will (as you said) open it in a separate tab and close as soon as it's done.\n. There's no reason why we can't just run the powershell profile script within init.bat.\n. @vladimir-kotikov Yeah, should cut down on the time to find a .git folder.\n. I'm currently busy with work and other commitments to work on cmder every day, if I do find a chunk of time to work on it I'll be sure to have a pre-release available.\n. Try adding double quotes \" before and after mysql in path.\n. I need to figure this out, a lot of contradicting PRs and changes.\n. Fair enough\n. Here: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/development/vendor/cmder.lua#L2\n. I've reverted the config changes, although I'll keep the launcher changes as they resolve some issues where CMDER_START isn't set in some instances.\n. Have you tried running what it says to run?\n. Babun is too large to be included unfortunately, cmder is already over 100MB with just git-for-windows.\nThere is a wiki topic on adding cygwin, I assume it's fairly similar to add Babun.\n. Are you using cygwin or bash included with cmder?\n. Ah okay, you're probably using the default cmd task.\nYes, netcat isn't included with git for windows.\nI'd look at integrating cygwin https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki/%5BWindows%5D-Integrating-Cygwin and installing/using netcat. Plus it's closer to a posix environment.\n. I've set the milestone to be 31st Jan, so expect it on or around that time.\n. cmd:\nbatch\ntitle HelloCmder\nPowerShell:\nPowerShell\n$host.ui.RawUI.WindowTitle = \"HelloCmder\"\nbash:\nbash\necho -ne '\\e]0;HelloCmder\\a'\nOnly the conemu version I'm using (151210) doesn't seem to rename the tabs, only when you right click the tab > rename it appears.\n. Settings > Main > Size & Pos > Check \"Auto save window size and position on exit\"\nThis should be set by default in the next version.\n. I can't reproduce this as I am not using the insider builds, could you report it to the clink repository?\n. Where have you installed cmder?\n. Try putting it on your desktop/user dir, permissions can mess things up\n. Run this: (git --version) -match '(?<ver>\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)+)'\nI've taken it directly from the posh-git checkversion script.\nDoes it return True? \nIf so you may have an older version of posh-git already installed, try reinstalling it with: \nUpdate-Module posh-git\nIf False let me know what git --version returns.\n. Does this build resolve your issues?\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/1.0.186-master/artifacts\n. This is somewhat fixed by the addition of cmder user profiles in the current dev branch, although my concern here is that $Profile is pretty much ignored.\nI think a change is required to dot-source $profile at some point in vendor/profile.ps1 although more issues may arise. posh-git already sources an example profile on install which will definitely break the default cmder prompt.\nFor now since (I assume) you're using 1.2.9 you can add that to vendor/profile.ps1 or (not recommended) dot source $profile on startup.\n. What version are you running?\n. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\nHash: SHA512\nI don't support the chocolatey package, I can only recommend you download a build from github and extract it to a location that your user can write to (Desktop for example).\nOn 25 February 2016 19:11:41 GMT+00:00, Carl-Erik Kopseng notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI am having the same problem.

I can confirm this only works with the cmd task at this time, I'll look into resolving this over the next few weeks.\n. Have you re-downloaded since disabling, as norton will have quarantined/deleted anything it deems a virus?\n. Have you aliased cmd -> cmder at any point?\n. Probably not, try deleting the @echo off at the top of init.bat and let me know how far it goes.\n. The '(1)' is probably what caused your issues.\n. IIRC it was clink this time around, only thing we can do is report the false positive and wait for the AV vendors to catch up.\n. Why not, just need to see it working.\n. @david-driscoll Can you resolve the conflicts, I'll review and potentially merge when that's done.\n. https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/windows-prerequisites.html\nLook at the section \"Maven in PATH.\"\n. Okay, what error are you getting? Since 'I cannot use maven in cmder' isn't descriptive enough.\n. You could also try running mvn.bat in cmder, it should work just fine.\n. You might need to add the new files to packignore, as they'll be included when cmder is packaged.\n. That would be a question for @bliker as he originally designed the logo, I can have a guess and say he probably saved it with a smaller colour depth i.e. 4bpp.\n. @JoshuaKGoldberg are you looking at reducing the size of the .ico files?\n. Will we need to include something to tell users to update posh-git @Jackbennett? I foresee people having broken git statuses if they haven't.\n. Okay to merge @Jackbennett ?\n. Strange, have you tried unzipping it to a folder not named _?\n. What version of cmder are you running?\n. @vladimir-kotikov \n. We have not and will not support the version in chocolatey. Please download the latest version on GitHub.\n. It\u2019s up to the package maintainer to package it for chocolatey, not us.\n\nMartin\n. We request the user to install it using psget on first run.\n. :+1: LGTM\n. 7-zip does not have the permissions to write those PEs, you are either running conemu/cmder at the same time or the permissions are broken. Whenever something like this happens, I suggest extracting cmder in a location your user can access, be it your user folder, your documents folder, or as I have always done it, onto your Desktop. Windows is 100% stupid with permissions, especially on the root of disks.\n. @kwokandy That's not what I was suggesting, but give it a try I guess.\n. Fixed in #1101 \n. @ogrishman The latest development builds are always here: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/artifacts\n. @ethanpil Yeah, it's in most documentation regarding batch scripting since Windows 2000.\n. Try using PowerShell.\n. The launcher sets CMDER_START to directory given as a /START argument or the current directory.\n. If you have created a shortcut, check what you have put after /START\n. What shell are you running?\n. Any issues when running it in PowerShell or cygwin/bash for windows?\n. Ah, it's for git-for-windows, see: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/vendor/init.bat#L40\nSet TERM to something else in %CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\user-profile.cmd\n. If you have to use cmd.\n. Fixed: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmderdev.github.io/commit/8391f5de260ddf802758950f3f37b9616ca47e5d\n. I don't think we've changed the hotkeys but you can see the defaults here: http://conemu.github.io/en/SplitScreen.html\n. Have a look at this issue: https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/356#issuecomment-138340001, unfortunately it's closed without an answer but the reporter mentioned reducing the size of the screen buffer.\n. Sorry Dax, I'll look into it more tomorrow.\n. It looks fine after a first glance, will need to check the launcher code more thoroughly.\n. @Stanzilla I've removed the one check that was preventing merges.\n. I think you should work on getting your installation of Windows back in order before saying it's an issue with cmder. Sorry.\n. We can't do anything about AV, you need to sort it with your AV vendor.\n. We use the vim included with git-for-windows, you should probably install your own version with python support.\n. Two Qs:\n- What version?\n- By default, it should remember the window position and size, did you change the setting?\n. Settings > Main > Size & Pos > Check \"Auto save window size and position on exit\"\n. Looks like there's a problem with 161009 and git, stay on 161002 for the time being.\n. What are you asking for?\nDoes it work? It sound like it is, do you want to know more about creating tasks? If so this is the best link.\n. You can either run the exe directly: C:\\<insert dirs here>\\make.exe [params]\nor\nmake sure the directory with your preferred make executable is earlier in your PATH environment variable.\n. @Stanzilla You should be able to make changes to master again.\n. I don't recommend extracting the archive to Program Files, extract it to your desktop or your documents.\n. I have always advised that cmd should never be put into 'Program Files' for the reasons @Jackbennett mentioned previously. Cmder is a portable tool and should be used like any other portable tool, left in the Downloads directory, on your Desktop or even on a USB drive, the work to allow Cmder to work with no issues in 'Program Files' is the same as creating an installer, a lot of work to make this portable tool, non-portable.. I'd give a cautious yes to go ahead, a simple attribution in a comment would be enough I feel.. Have you run ssh-add?. Thanks @acataluddi.. Are you extracting cmder into \"Program Files\" or other System protected directories?. Please understand that your pull request needs to make sense.. cmder.net is hosted through github pages and it does not support https with custom domains.. Don't store cmder in Program files, not only will you have this problem but you may end up with some issues with permissions, try again with it in your home directory or on your desktop.. @Stanzilla something for you to look at?. Please go ahead. The majority of outside contributors never followed the \"fork and make changes in the development branch\" so I'm fine with dropping it.\nI'd like to find some time into looking into automated GUI testing since I would think it would be more appropriate than just running the included scripts for consistency.. Yeah this looks good to me, is there nothing else to add @daxgames?. Are you 100% positive that the command prompt has not been disabled in group policy?. Were you using cmd before when using forward slashes? Did you do this tweak? https://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/395. Does this happen on a non-remote desktop session?. This is caused by your input language not being English, resulting in \"\u00fa\" being typed instead. You can edit the key combinations in the settings..

This has been a huge headache for me with Cmder for a long time - you should definitely submit a PR :+1: \n. Msysgit actually includes a script to authorize SSH keys with ssh-agent: Link. Try running start-ssh-agent from your prompt and some subsequent operations that require authorization.\n. Is there any plans to merge this? I have been using this with my own cmder install for some time without issue.\n. @flibitboat Try putting your colorscheme files in C:\\Users\\<NAME>\\vimfiles\\colors\n. Does this mean it is also impossible to redirect the output from a doskey to another command?\nSuppose I want to copy the output to the clipboard:\n\u03bb doskey text=echo copy this text to the clipboard\n\u03bb text | clip\ncopy this text to the clipboard\nThe output from the doskey is still displayed, and not redirected to clip.\n. This would be interesting, although is likely a feature for ConEmu rather than Cmder.\nEither way, I'd also like to see this!\n. What kind of script is it? If it's a regular shell script you should be able to use the following:\nshell\nsh ./myExecutable\nThis assumes you have the full version of cmder installed (with msysgit) or git's included Unix tools are accessible via your PATH.\n. @cm3  This works well for temporarily disabling aliases, as you mentioned.\nI was looking to use comments for organisational purposes:\n```\n:: convenience\nls=ls --color $\nlsa=ls -a --color $\npwd=cd\nclear=cls\n:: git shortcuts\ngs=git status $\ngd=git diff $\ngc=git commit $\ngca=git commit -a $\n...\n```\nUnfortunately, this shows an Invalid macro definition. message when Cmder starts.\n. I've had this issue as well - installed a patched version of Consolas but still seeing \u00b1 and \u00b0 in place of the Powerline symbols.\n. Interestingly, if we look at the contents of awk, it looks to be just a shell script that calls gawk.exe which (at least for me) works fine:\n``` bash\n\u03bb cat \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin\\awk\"\n!/bin/sh\nCopyright (C) 2002, Earnie Boyd\nmailto:earnie@users.sf.net\nThis file is part of MSYS\nhttp://www.mingw.org/msys.shtml\nFile: awk\ngawk \"$@\"\n```\nUsing sh awk does work on my end.\n. @span It's a strange one. Seems cmd.exe can't interpret how to run those files. Running awk from Git's included bash prompt works fine. The same is true with egrep which is just a wrapper for grep -E\nFor the time being, you can get around the issue by adding the following to cmder's aliases file\nsh\nawk=sh awk $*\nAdmittedly not the most elegant solution, but easier than retraining your brain your brain to type sh awk every time :-)\n. @vohof Interesting, what are the benefits of using a startup task over an alias?\n. @Daniel15 Just to confirm, in your previous screenshots are you using bash (Git for Windows) as your shell?\n. There was a similar issue some time ago, but I was under the impression it had been fixed. Either way, the solution that worked for me can be found here.\n. It's possible that the vim used by the full installation doesn't search in the same place for your .vimrc file. Try running :echo $MYVIMRC inside vim and noting the output.\n. @brentonklassen Did you install Git for Windows? If so, the issue is likely because the Unix tools have moved from Git's bin directory to usr\\bin. You'll need to update your path to account for this.\nUsing my installation as an example: C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin is required in my path.\n. Do you have Git for Windows installed in some non-default location? It's normally found in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git or similar.\nCmder should check for an existing msysgit directory, and add it to the path if found.\nIf for some reason that check isn't happening, you could try to add it to your path manually.\n. This is already being discussed over at #605!\n. @Stanzilla After a little fiddling around (it seems the newer vim loads files from .vim a la *nix systems instead of vimfiles) I managed to get your build set up.\nUnfortunately the situation has not improved: the same configuration works fine with the vim included in msysGit 1.9.5, but fails on Git for Windows' vim.\nCuriously, I tried running vim from git-bash.exe (included in vendor\\git-for-windows) which worked nicely:\n\nCould this mean that the problem lies somewhere within ConEmu/Cmder?\n. @variab1e Can you confirm what was fixed for yourself? Are you seeing the correct colours within vim now? I've tried with the latest ConEmu 'alpha' build and still have the same issue.\n. @variab1e Do you have everything as a portable Cmder install? It'd be awesome if you could post a version somewhere so I can test with my own vim configuration.\nIf not, I am happy to wait until Cmder updates to new releases of the relevant tools! :+1:\n. @variab1e Unfortunately I was still seeing the same problem with your modified Cmder install.\nHowever, I have noticed that replacing the vim executable in vendor\\git-for-windows\\usr\\bin with the 'Win32 console executable' from Vim's download page fixes the colours (but unfortunately introduces other issues). Presumably this is to do with the reason mentioned in Maximus5's comment.\n. @Maximus5 I only tested briefly, but noticed the following:\n- Cursor not displaying in both normal and insert mode\n- Ignoring syntax files in ~/vimfiles/syntax/ seems to be searching for them in the same folder as the executable (see below).\n  \n@variab1e Thanks, I'll be sure to try it out!\n. They should be stored in the ConEmu.xml file, looks like the the particular hotkey you are looking for is under the Multi.Close key.\nThere is an easier way to achieve what you want though; the dropdown next to the input allows you to select 'Delete' as one of the options, with the three on the far right allowing up to 3 modifier keys to be specified (one of which is the 'Win' key):\n\n. I have an alias for almost the exact same thing which works fine. Looks to be an issue with the way alias.bat works.\nAs a workaround, you can edit the alias file directly, it can be found at [CMDER PATH]\\config\\aliases.\n. > I have about a lot of aliases, mostly Git related, that make most Git commands 1-5 characters for both cmd and bash.\n@daxgames Sorry to hijack the thread, but how do you manage aliases for both cmd and bash on Windows? I currently switch between both frequently (from within cmder of course) and up until now have been duplicating aliases; once in config/aliases and once in a .aliases file in my home directory (which I source in .bashrc). I'd love to find a cleaner way of doing this!\n. @Stanzilla @daxgames I think it's important to allow users to use their installed version of Git if they have it. Certain dev tools also require Git to be installed in the default location, so sometimes the choice is not your own.\n. To those that have tried this, how is the experience? Does everything work as you would expect?\n. How about ConEmu keybindings? Does the shell 'swallow' these in the same way it does with Mintty currently?\n. @mbeaudru I don't have it installed on this machine to confirm, but have you tried checking your .bashrc? I believe Ubuntu includes a default one that has the following somewhere:\n#force_color_prompt=yes\nUncomment this line (remove the leading #) and then run source ~/.bashrc\n. ",

A last option is to use AutoHotkey\nIfWinActive ahk_class VirtualConsoleClass\n::~::D:/nicolas\nIfWinActive\nThis will replace ~ by whatever you want, as soon as you type anotther character ('/' or Enter):\ncd ~\n\n\nuser type '/', it becomes\ncd D:/nicolas/\n\n\nNote that it's working all the time in ConEmu, meaning it would work even if you ssh into another machine (whic seems plain wrong - I usually stop AutoHotKey aat this point)\n. +1 from me, I'm actually using it ;)\nTHanks\n. Note that I've tested all possible case, and it works as expected for me.\n. @vladimir-kotikov thanks for the review, fixed!\n. To be honest, it's working as I expect it to work and I don't plan to update this pull request - due to the lack of interest from the maintainer.\nClosing it\n. Closing, no interest\n. When reading at first, I thought it was only a way to specify your own ConEmu.xml file.\nBut actually, you are setting a new config directory. I was more expecting something in the line of setting %CMDER_CONFIG% to a new ConEmu.xml file.\nI see a potential issue with this: my use case would be to change the ConEmu.xml file, but keep all the config for clink, as well as the existing aliases and whenever Cmder is updated, enjoy update in those files as well.\nNote that I have another pull request going into the direction of user settings: https://github.com/bliker/cmder/pull/367\nIf Cmder goes this way, it would be nice in this case to add a comment to easily initialize it: just a batch file copying the config/* files from cmder, and setting the %CMDER_CONFIG% env variable.\n. As is, your patch doesn't work or me. Here is the diff to make it works:\n``` diff\n@@ -105,7 +105,7 @@ void StartCmder(std::wstring path, bool is_single_mode)\n        DWORD isSet = GetEnvironmentVariable(L\"CMDER_CONFIG\", cmderConfig, MAX_PATH);\n        if (!isSet)\n        {\n-               PathCombine(cmderConfig, exeDir, L\"config\\\");\n+               PathCombine(cmderConfig, exeDir, L\"config\");\n        }\n    PathCombine(cfgPath, cmderConfig, L\"ConEmu.xml\");\n\n@@ -120,7 +120,7 @@ void StartCmder(std::wstring path, bool is_single_mode)\n        }\n        else\n        {\n-               swprintf_s(args, L\"/Icon \\\"%S\\\" /Title Cmder /LoadCfgFile \\\"%S\\\"\", icoPath, cfgPath);\n+               swprintf_s(args, L\"/Icon \\\"%s\\\" /Title Cmder /LoadCfgFile \\\"%s\\\"\", icoPath, cfgPath);\n        }\n```\nThe \\ in the CMDER_CONFIG env variable prevent loading clink when it's not set by the user.\nThe %S doesn't work for me - I have no idea why the %s doesn't work for you, it should.\nAnd after putting more thoughts in this pull request, I think you got a point and I agree with you.\nSo +1 after fixing the code.\n.

Thank you so much. I was nearing my wit's end. For reference, this behavior of Terminal is documented here.\n. Given that this feature is \"well advertised\" everywhere (on the companion site, README), this should probably be on high priority. @MartiUK \n. The settings you are talking about are actually settings for ConEMU. ConEMU is the emulation layer, not the terminal itself. So when you are doing in reality is setting ConEMU as default (with its default terminal/FAR Manager setup).\nThe correct way to do this is to create a hard link to Cmder.exe file (or do some very clever hacks). That's possible only through the Windows registry. Look here for a good way to achieve this.\n. @wheelerlaw Even though Cmder is just great at what it does, I still wouldn't recommend linking/replacing cmd.exe with Cmder. A lot of things still don't work well with Cmder and terminal emulation. Permissions are another sore point. You wouldn't want cmd.exe missing from your toolbox in those circumstances.\n. @Maxmaxmaximus What do you really need to replace cmd.exe with Cmder? Applying to specific scenarios is much better, than messing with the registry or doing deep-linked changes.\n. Its extremely confusing when the main README.md states that the latest release is v1.2 and yet the v1.2 is marked pre-release and hence not fit for release. \n. @isimmons It may have worked, but removing all VCC redist versions before 2013 is definitely not the right way to go. Since each yearly update comes with new API features, other apps might not work. What I do is usually keep the latest redist of each yearly package. Yearly releases are backwards compatible and hence it makes sure that other stuff doesn't break.\nAttached an image for good reference.\n\n. Personally, I feel the best non-invasive way to achieve this is using the built-in Windows Task Scheduler. It provides a very easy to use interface to set up startup tasks, with customized parameters. \n. I think starting v1.2, you simply call agent. It is located in the bin folder. To run SSH always at startup, you'll need to tinker with /vendor/init.bat. Look at the Readme.md file for more information.\n. Transparency is actually handled by ConEmu. That kind of decoupling would be impossible IMHO.\n. Ref #501. @ruud00000 Don't open new issues if a relevant one already exists. Please search for your issue first in already open issues. This helps keep off duplicate issues.\n. Refer #501. Please close this.\n. @JoshuaKGoldberg How do I go about using these icons?\n. @JoshuaKGoldberg No. What I meant was that I know where the icons are (they are at cmder/icons/.), but ho do I use them for any tasks I may want to customize with an icon? \nI have a hunch it's done using the ConEmu settings page for Tasks.\n\n.

Can you guys try https://github.com/Stanzilla/cmder/releases/tag/1.2.6 please, it has updated Git and ConEmu versions which both claim to have vim fixes.\n. Can you guys try https://github.com/Stanzilla/cmder/releases/tag/1.2.6 please, it has updated Git and ConEmu versions which both claim to have vim fixes.\n. Nice investigation. Maybe @Maximus5 can chime in on this.\n. Can you try installing a recent release, for example https://github.com/Stanzilla/cmder/releases/tag/1.2.6 please?\n. Can you try installing a recent release, for example https://github.com/Stanzilla/cmder/releases/tag/1.2.6 please?\n. https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/227\n. https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/tag/v1.2.9\n. Try this please https://github.com/Stanzilla/cmder/releases/tag/1.2.6\n. useful how?\n. Still not our call, please make an issue over at ConEmu\n. @laurent22 this is not the ConEmu bugtracker though.. Which version did you download and install?\n. Can you try this one, please https://github.com/Stanzilla/cmder/releases/tag/1.2.6\n. The releases I tag are from the development branch, the others (even master) are not really worth checking out as they either are feature branches for pull requests or a complete mess (master) :)\n. Did it a bit different but it points to /releases/ now.\n. If you look at the current code you can see that those changes are already in there :)\n. Thanks, fixed!\n. We should probably start including the changelogs of the packages we bundle, in some way. \na) Only highlight the issues that were fixed that people reported to us? (Lots of work)\nb) just link to their changelogs\nc) quote it all\nWhat do you guys think?\n. @vladimir-kotikov chop chop then!\n. @JanSchulz agree, done.\n. Related to https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/505#issuecomment-148135474 then. Depends on how you look at being portable, I guess.\n. Yup, my answer was more aimed at pavel, and the defaults we set. \n. AH so that was what @Jackbennett removed here https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/commit/7ebfffc9da6c057485f79ec65d35226b14be0c05 :D\n. I actually use GitHub's Atom editor for almost anything\n. I always wanted to but was too lazy to switch from Sublime, now Atom has most of the features I wanted to try Brackets for as plugins...Atom is still pretty new but community and devs are great and pushing really hard to get stuff done and I love that, so I'm stuck there for now :D\n. Dupe of https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/553\n. Please use the latest version and test again.\n. Please test with the latest pre-release\n. https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases 1.2.9\n. Please don't use Gow, it's outdated and breaks the Unix tools that come with Git for Windows\n. sftp.exe comes with our package via Git for Windows so I guess your installation is broken, please get the latest pre-release.\n. @calclavia windows 10 insider build?. I'm on ConEmu 151015 and it also works fine for me!\n. Please download the latest pre-release from here https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases\n. Thanks!\n. Please get the latest pre release from here https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases\n. Get the latest pre-release from https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases\n. Yep, can reproduce, not yet sure what caused it though.\n. Yep, can reproduce, not yet sure what caused it though.\n. Did you test with clink 0.4.4?\nEdit: Ok I did, so I can blame clink now, great!\n. You can use this test build of clink to have the fix right now, we will make sure to include it in our next release: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hqbrpkf0dpmmizq/AADIJ4G5gjJ59JfFmr-3-Qc0a/20150923_1abb57/clink_DEV.zip?dl=0\nThanks for helping us find the issue and reporting it in the first place!\n. Dupe of https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/678\n. Our git for windows version ( @DanielGGordon dev branch has up to date version) is built using msys2, so you already have most (all?) of msys2 anyway.\n. Already fixed in dev, will be in the next release :)\n. Can you try removing the old folders completely before updating, please?\n. Our Lua interpreter is clink, so you might get lucky and have it fixed by using a newer test build of that. You can get that from here https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hqbrpkf0dpmmizq/AADIJ4G5gjJ59JfFmr-3-Qc0a/20150923_1abb57/clink_DEV.zip?dl=0\n. @vladimir-kotikov any idea?\n. What happens is that the launcher copies that file into the correct place so it does not get overwritten.\n. No idea but it works fine as is, why change it?\n. Guess this should still be open, sorry was on a closing spree :)\n. I don't even know if we want to keep the bat around, it's only used for Windows XP anyway, no?\n. I think it looks weird without the \\in the paths :/\n. Well actually it might be the better way to just remove the \\ from the variable, don't you think?\n. I would prefer dropping the slash from the variable.\n@cmderdev/trusted-contributors @cmderdev/owners any objections to changing the root variable to drop the slash like that?\nAlso @daxgames can we leave https://github.com/daxgames/cmder/commit/e56e00669113b9bad3d57b19a3623ebd445191b2 out of this PR, I don\nt really think we need your personal files in the .gitignore, I know it does not hurt either but yeah.\n. Nope, that's good. Can you squash please?\n. Great, thank you!\n. When you say fresh install, which version did you download?\n. Can you try the latest pre-release at https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases please?\n. No problem :)\n. check your cmder\\vendor dir, the only lua file in there should be clink.lua if you have any extra, delete those and try again.\n. @vladimir-kotikov because we changed around what is in there and when users upgrade by just copying the new files into the folder, some old stuff stays around and causes problems like the lambda not showing up because clink was called twice etc, that's why I like to make sure people only have the one lua file there that is actually used at the moment. But I guess it was not the case here.\n. Those are way too many unrelated changes for one PR, imo.\n. Ok from how I understood it, you wanted to add a new task for bash, but you renamed and changed the default one from cmd to bash?\n. looks ok to me\n. No, I changed it afterwards  but haven't committed it, yet.\n. Something must have changed about that in the november update for Win10, I'm getting this error for ShareX, too.\n. report it as false positive please\n. We already have that in https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/tree/development\n. @MartiUK @cmderdev/trusted-contributors  what do we want to be on the release notes? We should probably wait with releasing until there is a new clink release but maybe we can start drafting the notes already so it does not pile up.\nI'd suggest a section just for the vendor stuff that was bumped to the latest version but do we want to list their changelogs, too? Or just mention which Cmder issues have been fixed by including a newer version? Kinda annoying to track down.\n. Was the current way of trying to get the icon from the exe not working?\n. Makes sense\n. Yes pls\n. report it as a false positive please\n. cmder already comes with clink-completions 0.2.1 in the dev branch\n. @vvartivarian-nbcu See sources.json here https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/tree/development\n. Hrm is that really generic workaround or more like a Conda workaround?\n. You have to download from the releases page, not from the repo itself.  https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases\n. @delscorcho which version of cmder are you on?\n. Post your git, clink and conemu versions pls.\n. type git --version clink and conemu -?\n. Alright, can you download a test build from here and tell me if that works better, please. https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/artifacts\n. @SCLeoX install https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/tag/v1.3.0\n. Wouldn't git diff-files --no-ext-diff --quiet || git diff-index --no-ext-diff --quiet --cached HEAD be better then since we probably want indexed and unindexed?\n. English please\n. That's more of a ConEmu issue, please file a ticket over there: https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\n. Where did you download which file exactly?\n. Ah, I see. Please use the packages provided here https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases\nWhat you downloaded is the source code only.\n. Do we actually really need the package without git?\n. @wgv-sethlivingston type which git\n. @DRSDavidSoft @daxgames this is no longer needed, right? we already sped that up?. @MartiUK why not just merge this? Other PRs have to be rebased on that but this at least fixes the problem, no?\n. Yup, exactly, might also help filing a bug over there, too :)\n. Still not a Cmder issue.. Yup. Babun comes with waaay too much stuff that we already use and include\n. Well we recently added bash/mintty, does that help?\n. We are integrating the finished product, not the build environment\n. The whole thing has always been a mess but it is a bit better now with the new naming\n. https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/350\n. This is already gone in the next version, see the development branch.\n. wfm\n. Yeah it's a bad situation again @MartiUK you wanted to do a new pre-release or release \"soon\"? Want me to just do a pre-release now?\n. Nice find! If you don't mind, please file a bug over here, https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/clink-completions that's the thing we are using in cmder.\n. https://github.com/cmderdev/cmderdev.github.io. Yes!. Does it work if you disable Norton?\n. Nope, only the old aliases file.\n. Yup figured it out, I didn't have the example file at all, my fault!\n. Please report it as a false positive to your AV vendor.\n. Yup, the other branch, please\n. Not possible yet, will be available in a future insider build.\n. Yes Insider builds of Windows 10, will be in the next or the one after that.\n. Fixed in https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/commit/91f5c5379a5cf20fcadd2d90456818cc3b245b74. Please report it as a false positive.\n. https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/commit/07ed31c0a16b892b7c0ae77047894943a9f1bb80\n. Thanks!\n. @liftir @Jackbennett revert this then?\n. ok\n. This? https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/111\n. Can probably loop in @Maximus5 to confirm that\n. Okay, thanks for your input!\n. continue here https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/1609. Which version do you have installed?\n. Great to hear!\n. Which dir are you running cmder from?\n. fine by me, @cmderdev/trusted-contributors?\n. @JoshuaKGoldberg can you PR that into the development branch, please?\n. @Mansuro can you PR that into the development branch, please?\n. Please continue on the clink issue tracker then\n. 1.3.3 comes with the latest release which is the same as master though, did you maybe have old files left over that got loaded?. The site only links to GitHub but you can just use the releases page to make sure https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases. Merged. Thank you for that! :)\n. https://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/387\n. We had a few problems with os.execute which is why we switched away from it https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/749 https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/692\nDoes this help you maybe? https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/809#issuecomment-207203013 Maybe removing 2>nulis already good enough?\n. https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/commit/567889e69fb00d7a3f7f661b8552916cb7e03a3d found it, paging @janschulz \n. We are waiting for a new clink release where this is fixed https://github.com/mridgers/clink/commit/c1ae9938de8605d9aed64d1cb1df893acfd3eff7\nDupe of https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/968\n. Well if could still be something else, guess we'll have to wait and see. Or, if you want and can, compile a version of clink for yourself and test.\n. Please try with a clean installation, I cannot reproduce that here.\n. @chjiyun doing the same in the settings is a bit more convenient: \n\n. @vladimir-kotikov that's fixed already, right?\n. Good to know, guys! :)\n. Please try https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/tag/v1.3.0-pre\n. Can you do a 100% new installation, not overwriting anything. Just download https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/tag/v1.3.0-pre cmder.zip/7z and put it in a new folder and run it. The update prompt will always happen, the question is if the prompt itself looks fine, the lambda etc.\n. Can you do where ls and post the output, please?\n. Well that means you are using an external version of git and it's tools, can you check the version of it? git --version\n. Did you also update the included git version of cmder?\n. Well actually, download this https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/k9lhpgfxryqhpft7/artifacts/build/cmder.7z unpack it into a NEW folder and tell me if that is still slow.\n. That would be something to report over at https://github.com/git-for-windows/ then\n. ^ this. Does that fix all your complaints, @rakete?\n. @gunr2171 please update and post your clink version\n. Works for me, which version of cmder are you using?\n. Yeah it might be the path append/prepend change. \n. No, that's fine. Please upgrade to https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/tag/v1.3.0-pre\n. Works for me https://gfycat.com/SneakyElasticBushsqueaker\n. Uh i might be missing something, what is the problem in your vid?\n. Great to hear, already did that in the dev branch :)\n. Which clink version do you have? Just clink\n. All config is in the config dir, this is weird though. Haven't seen that error before.\n. Yeah, you have it in Program Files, that means, unless you run it as admin, it has no permission to generate the settings.\n. So either move it out of there, or run cmder.exe as admin\n. Well, try anyway. It might still bug out because of that. I suggest not having it in Program Files anyway.\n. Glad I could help and yeah we now generate the settings on the first start and that's not possible in Program Files, should probably note that somewhere\ncc @MartiUK @daxgames \n. Type clinkand tell me what it says\n. update https://github.com/mridgers/clink/releases/download/0.4.7/clink_0.4.7.zip\n. It will add itself to the Path on its own, yes. And you can just download this https://ci.appveyor.com/api/buildjobs/h150iq3w7d4fk0or/artifacts/build/cmder.7z and unpack it into a new folder and tell me if it still happens.\n. not sure about that, paging @vladimir-kotikov \n. Try updating manually from https://conemu.github.io/en/Downloads.html\n. Get something like LockHunter and inspect the files with it, it will tell you if any process is keeping a handle on them.\n. Hrm, green for clean, yellow for untracked files, red for untracked files and changes?\n. Yeah probably more sane\n. Looks like some of the master commits slipped into your PR\n. no, thank you :)\n. Thanks!\n. In which folder is your cmder installation?\n. Can you maybe screen record the process?\n. Report it as a false positive to Dr. Web\n. Stop using bad AntiVir software? :). Did you start cmder with cmder.bat or cmder.exe?\n. https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/clink-completions/pull/53\n. Did you maybe delete or not copy in https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/vendor/user-aliases.cmd.example?\n. Yeah you need to stop messing with the file structure on your own, I just tested it on a fresh folder and it works fine.\n. It uses it to generate the content of the real file, and yes I agree that the method is sub-optimal but better than what we had before. Maybe @daxgames will look into it again and maybe have the file generated without using a dummy file.\n. That went into master yeah, and I'm actually fine with that, not sure if I want to keep using the dev branch\n. Because it has nothing to do with cmder, it's a git problem.\n. Yeah that would be the only thing that could help, otherwise create a ticket over at git-for-windows\n. Might get a real fix soon https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/commit/78e2deea8ec1db4aea1e78432ae98dac7198f6a5. @Jin-Whu which other bug are you talking about?\n. Just downloaded it and it is there: http://i.imgur.com/BMTvRmO.png\n. +1 for parsing\n. @hacst @0x539 In vendor\\clink.lua\nline 206\nfor line in io.popen(\"git status --porcelain 2>nul\"):lines() do\nreplace that with\nfor line in io.popen(\"git status 2>nul\"):lines() do\ndoes that help?\n. @hacst https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/tag/1.3.1\n. Might be worth keeping in mind https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/commit/01d1dd8956e458b6c6a4cddc9a86133b4d50c25a\n. Might get a real fix soon https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/commit/78e2deea8ec1db4aea1e78432ae98dac7198f6a5. Oh neat\n. Oh neat\n. https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/901#issuecomment-237562623\n. Could be either clink or conemu, can you try filing an issue at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/ first, please?\n. Probably a clink issue then. It comes with the package and is used by default.. @janschulz do you still want to wait for a response to your clink issue or won't that change what is in this PR?\n. ConEmu update only updates ConEmu, if you want to get the latest version of the Cmder scripts/launcher you have to download a zip again.\n. Your settings are preserved, no worries\n. Try over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/ :)\n. I probably failed and uploaded the wrong file. Will fix with the next release. Sorry!\n. So basically https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/381 + a sualias like you are already using?\n. No, please change to master. @daxgames are you ok with this? I mean it's sort of a trivial change (at least the first commit) but you wrote the code in the first place.\nThanks for the PR, orionlee!\n. Thank you!\n. @Jackbennett \n. thank you!\n. Cmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu. @daxgames the checks here froze for whatever reason, can you push something to re-trigger them?\n. @MartiUK alright, we also need a decision on which branch to use going forward, still dev and master for releases or all master.\n. @lamarqua yes, a PR would be great\n. Fixed in 161009a https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/releases/tag/v16.10.09a\n. Fixed in 161009a https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/releases/tag/v16.10.09a\n. Try updating ConEmu to 161009a https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/releases/tag/v16.10.09a\n. No, sorry. I forgot to send my comment :( I meant to say that you have to file a bug over here: https://github.com/mridgers/clink. Which version of cmder are you running? Your ConEmu looks pretty old.\n. it's kinda hard for a compilation/pack to communicate it's own version properly, sadly.\n. as long as there is no proper version check for the whole cmder package, I don't see why we would disable the ConEmu updates. Usually the stable channel of it is actually quite stable.\n. I currently can't touch master because of some setting @MartiUK changed. Also waiting for a decision on which branch to use going forward.\n. @MartiUK cool, thank you! What branch to use for what going forward then? I remember talks where people suggested going with master for everything vs master/dev. Currently we accept PRs on both branches and it kinda is a mess.\n. Please go here https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/985. @borekb @daxgames one of you making a PR for that?. Do you also use SourceTree by chance? https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/SRCTREEWIN-6688. @christRescues try a dev version and tell me if it still happens, please! https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/artifacts. There is also this now https://github.com/AmrEldib/cmder-powerline-prompt. https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/849. Probably missing quotes somewhere again?. That's something the choco package maintainer has to fix.. https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/tag/v1.3.2. Yeah, sorry about that. Waiting for https://github.com/cmderdev/cmderdev.github.io/pull/9 to be merged by @MartiUK . thanks!. Continue here please https://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/409. Please report over at https://github.com/git-for-windows/. Please report that to the chocolatey package maintainers.. Please report that on the ConEmu issue tracker. Yeah should be. Will at to the wiki, thank you!. Because it's probably an upstream issue in clink. Are you sure you are on the latest version? Because we actively prevent that https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/vendor/clink.lua#L228. That's a feature request for ConEmu: https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu. Not our problem, sorry. Go to the ConEmu or clink bugtracker, they have a few issues open with Insider builds, https://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/431 for ex. Upstream issue. are you on some windows 10 insider build?. They broke that recently, you will have to wait for them to fix it.. Hey there,\nCmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\nThank you! :). This is currently labeled as a preview release, I only bump to stables, sorry. thanks!. Yup, nothing we can do here.. Please update to the latest version. want to make a PR?. I think it's ok, it's pretty generic.. cc @MartiUK though. \nCan't repo :(. Yup, can repro with SVN, thank you!. What is your folder name? You blanked it out in your screenshot.. So you don't even have % in your path, so it's a different issue. I can't repro with your paths.\n\n. I will take a proper look at both issues later.. @jkesselring can you test with https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/commit/e3cdf43afc88b514045e80e30689b6f35cbdc925 please?. \n\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 . thanks!. Hey there,\nCmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\nThank you! :). it's Win+Alt+Space and non configurable: https://conemu.github.io/en/KeyboardShortcuts.html. No idea, it's a Git issue, really.. I mean, it's been a year, a lot in our scripts has changed, especially to git handling, can you still repro?. We don't use any Perl scripts though, so probably not our fault. Thing is, we have to clear stale issues from time to time. Cmder is a collection of 3rd party software stiched together by our scripts. Most of the issues that come up are not Cmder's fault at all. So yeah. Update, test again, if it still happens, come back and open a new issue with us, or if you figured out which part is faulty, with that party.. Thanks!. Thanks!. Duplicate of https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/1346. It needs a solution for the problem mentioned in the comment above. Fixed in https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/commit/91f5c5379a5cf20fcadd2d90456818cc3b245b74. Usually @vladimir-kotikov does a PR to the project when he finished a new clink-completions release, so waiting for that.. @ByteCommander we bundle 0.3.2 though, so maybe you are just on an old release?. @Jackbennett since PS is no longer the default, can't we assume that people that switch to PS know what they are doing and take care of that?. @Jackbennett since PS is no longer the default, can't we assume that people that switch to PS know what they are doing and take care of that?. @pyranja nice, PR please. Cool, thanks!. Cool, thanks!. Hey there,\nCmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\nThank you! :). We use ConEmu for that, so you'd have to make a request over there.. Hey there,\nCmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\nThank you! :). That probably depends on your system locale? For me \necho %date:~10,4%-%date:~7,2%-%date:~4,2% \ngives -01-4. in both cmd and cmder.. That would certainly be a an option. @cmderdev/trusted-contributors thoughts?. Not quite, but almost, you commited merge conflicts here https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/1372/files#diff-159626d08a0475178d80ae25e9d36f17R91 and in init.bat. Not quite, but almost, you commited merge conflicts here https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/1372/files#diff-159626d08a0475178d80ae25e9d36f17R91 and in init.bat. I kinda wanted to wait for the Readline update PR dude to come back but I guess now is a good time as any.. @ZodmanPerth try one of those https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/1.0.475-master/artifacts. Hey there,\nCmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\nThank you! :). Thanks. Hey there,\nCmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\nThank you! :). Can you explain this a bit more?. Can you explain why this is needed, please?. Hey sorry about that, but this has conflicts now. Hey there,\nCmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\nThank you! :). Cmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu. Try with v1.3.5. Thank you!. Thanks!. Thanks!. Try making a report on the ConEmu project please. %GIT_INSTALL_ROOT% is not set at that time though :/. Yeah, we set it in init.bat. That would mean we have to change the file during the build process and make that way more complex, no?. Yeah agree. Why not build the problem into the error message? If it says \"CMDER Shell Initialization has Failed, are you trying to use bash in cmder_mini?\" Or something like that, it should be pretty clear?. How exactly did 1.3.5 do this? Because it's actually a regression. The latest ConEmu build (https://conemu.github.io/blog/2018/04/16/Build-180416.html) has an interesting bug fix:\nconemu#1513: Fix erroneously trimmed leading \" in commands  cmd /c \"-new_console script.bat argument\".\nmaybe that was the reason why I could not make it work before. Edit: nope.. Hey there,\nCmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\nThank you! :). @MartiUK could use CloudFlare though? https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/. Wrong repo though. Go here https://github.com/cmderdev/cmderdev.github.io. Because it still is a false positive. oops, didn't see the PR and did it manually, thanks anyway!. Hey there, can you check out if https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/commit/a8d32611a9b93cfb58f0318ae4b8041bc8a86c68 fixes it? Thanks!. Hey there, can you check out if https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/commit/a8d32611a9b93cfb58f0318ae4b8041bc8a86c68 fixes it? Thanks!. @adautoserpa So which version of ConEmu did you download and install? Because 1.3.3 actually comes with the latest alpha version. So if you downloaded the latest release version, you actually downgraded ConEmu and only delayed running into the problem. Yup makes sense, thank you for checking!\n@maximus5 Intended change or regression?. @vbm suggested using 39m because that's the default color of foreground at startup -> https://github.com/shiena/ansicolor/blob/master/README.md\nI'm inclined to leave it like that.. I think so, yeah. 1.3.4 is out now. @freiro I know, the PR updating the links has not been merged yet.. Report it as a false positive please. It is a false positive.. Do you mean the 1.3.3 release and if so, which zip?. Please report as a false positive. I think so. There will be people complaining and I thought about doing two editions but I don't think we should do that.. Let's try it: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/commit/124565f36aa091cdbf96d6140e9033f3a6e9a144. Hrmm I will take a look but no promises..

Any day now though.. @deadalnix you can just download a nightly build if it is urgent?. Well done!. Nope. Also Gow is super outdated and nobody should use it..

Looks good to me, what are the conflicts?. \"This branch cannot be rebased due to conflicts\"\n. Hrrm, weird squash and merge and merge commit work, just rebase does not want to. Aw well, I think for PRs like that a merge commit is good anyway.. Can you rebase the branch, please? Otherwise, I am still on vacation and will start testing on the 12th.. @daxgames no, your branch currently has conflicts with master so it cannot be merged via a rebase, you have to rebase your changes onto current master.. \n\ud83e\udd14 . @daxgames I think you just need to rebase onto master and then force push your branch, git is picky sometimes. When I did one, I used https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator with the following settings:\nuser=cmderdev\nproject=cmder\nunreleased=false\nissues=false\nbetween-tags=v1.3.4,v1.3.5\nsimple-list=true\ntoken=<snip>\nbut it was meh. we close so many issues that allowing them to be included in automation would be just spam, maybe just when they were closed as fixed?\nOtherwise we could use something like \n```bash\n!/bin/bash\nversion=$( git describe --tags --always )\ntag=$( git describe --tags --always --abbrev=0 )\nif [ \"$version\" = \"$tag\" ]; then # on a tag\n  current=\"$tag\"\n  previous=$( git describe --tags --abbrev=0 HEAD~ )\nelse\n  current=$( git log -1 --format=\"%H\" )\n  previous=\"$tag\"\nfi\ndate=$( git log -1 --date=short --format=\"%ad\" )\nurl=$( git remote get-url github | sed -e 's/^git@(.):/https:\\/\\/\\1\\//' -e 's/.git$//' )\ntitle='# '${url##/}\necho -ne \"$title\\n\\n## ${version} ($date)\\n\\nFull Changelog\\n\\n\" > \"CHANGELOG.md\"\ngit shortlog --no-merges --reverse \"$previous..$current\" | sed -e  '/^\\w/G' -e 's/^      /- /' >> \"CHANGELOG.md\"\ngit log --pretty=format:\"###%s\" \"$previous..$current\" | sed -e 's/^/    /g' -e 's/^ *$//g' -e 's/^    ###/- /g' -e 's/$/  /' >> \"CHANGELOG.md\"\necho >> \"CHANGELOG.md\"\n```. Oh sure, I was just always too lazy. Ideally one would write a meaningful entry with every release, especially the next one with your PR will solve a lot of issues so you might want to do that one yourself?. fixed. @MartiUK I think you are the only person with enough permissions to delete it btw.

Hey there,\nCmder uses ConEmu as term.... Hey there,\nCmder uses ConEmu as terminal emulator, if you are experiencing a problem with that, please open a bug over at https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu\nThank you! :). I guess you noticed that I have a template for my answers set up :D This is a better idea!. @daxgames https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/1.0.605-master/artifacts\nnote it's the cmder_mini package, so no git on board.. Ah, this maybe? https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/1497. Can we not run init.bat in the task before we want to open the actual console?. > The sub routines are now libs so we could write a smaller more targeted bash_init.bat that sets env vars that would then be available to the bash tasks and shell. If one is necessary for powershell maybe it gets written too.\nyeah that was my thinking. I haven't found out how to run a bat in a task yet though. Yeah that makes more sense, I was trying to chain bat calling and the actual task but that did not work out well.. Yeah that makes more sense, I was trying to chain bat calling and the actual task but that did not work out well.. I'd rather not switch from c++ at this point.. Still happening with https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/1739 merged btw. What exactly is the problem?. Yeah that's what I figured but there is no way to fix that if we don't change something during our build process so the package in _mini is actually different from the full one.. Also I guess this is a duplicate of https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/1497. @daxgames that's fixed, right?. Not sure about the reading from the changelog part but otherwise super cool!. So in most of my other projects, nightly version names are generated on the last tag name + a sequential number + a git hash + a release type. See here for example: https://www.wowace.com/projects/weakauras-2/files\nThat would work quite well here as well, I think. I'd probably say, hardcode the infos into the script and only use the hardcoded values when not in an AppVeyor environment?. Sounds good. meh, do we actually need that? If someone wants to compile without Git present, I don't think that will happen?. Okay, then how about hardcoding the name in your script since the name will actually never change and fall back \"version\" to \"dev\" if git is not present or not on AV. Yes. Hrm, I guess. What do @cmderdev/trusted-contributors think about the whole thing btw?. VERBOSE: successfully built Cmder v1.3.6-pre1.635! that doesn't look right :D. Oh I thought that was a mistake, but it's the appveyor build number. Hrm it is at a pretty useless value, too. Just git describe --tags then, without adding anything at the end. that will have the sequential number from describe and a pointer to the hash it was compiled from. what's win32's problem with g94e7?. but v1.3.6-pre1.635 worked?. meh, just leave it like that then, I guess.

Why do you add environment variables in the task? Also you did not add yarn to PATH, you made a new Yarn variable. Hey there! Can you do me a favor and try a dev build and tell me if it happens there as well? Thanks!\nDev builds: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/1.0.646-master/artifacts. So I like the content but I feel like our README is getting a bit too long, maybe we should split off more into the wiki and rather link to that from the sections. I think it would be best if you did it in one commit, so you don't add content here and remove it in the next one.. Hey there, not sure what you are asking, can you try again in English, please?. No, that is sadly how terminals work, sorry :/. Status?. Can you open the ConEmu settings inside of Cmder and take a screenshot please?\n\n. Okay, so can you try updating ConEmu, go to update, set \"preferred release type\" to \"latest\" and then copy the settings I have and see if this fixes anything?. @daxgames ready to merge or nah?. @daxgames had time to take a look yet? . @daxgames is your review still valid?. no, sorry..

The problem is that a shipped file is overwritten on the next update (at least if I copy the files over the current installation path). That was my motivation for this PR: init.bat has changes which result in a newer version and I have to redo my integration the next time I update. The \"create the new file, if it doesn't exist\" pattern prevents that..\n. Updated the created script to not print a message to the user. Also updated the readme  (how to enable the ssh agent).\n. It would probably be also good to do something similar for the PS init, but I don't know any PS :-(\n. @pavelkouril Yep, the PS version is more in line of #520: you need to add a env variable to point to you startup file. Not sure if that's more \"normal\" for PS?\n. You could change the vendor\\init.bat file to look at your git path:\n:: Check if msysgit is installed\n@if exist \"%ProgramFiles%\\Git\" (\n    set \"GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=%ProgramFiles%\\Git\"\n) else if exist \"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Git\" (\n    set \"GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Git\"\n) else if exist \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\" (\n    set \"GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\msysgit\"\n)\n-> replace @if exist \"%ProgramFiles%\\Git with @if exist \"c:\\DEV\\Git\n. The proper sulution would probably be to to change the default init.bat to run where git.exe and look at the results -> as long as git is in path this will work...\n. which version of git is installed next to it (I don't have docker installed)? If it is Git for Windows 2.x, then this is a duplicate of https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/610#issuecomment-134669653\n. Is $PROFILE a standard way to extend a powershell console environment (\"traditional powershell window\")?\n. There is a bit more to do :-( \nSee this PR: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/605\n. vendor\\init.bat got a comment at the top of the file not to change it. Maybe vendor/profile.ps1 should also get such a comment?\n. I installed cmdr in my dropbox and added some dirs in vendor, which I then added to the path in config/user_startup.cmd:\n@set \"PATH=%PATH%;%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\Aspell\\bin\"\n@set \"PATH=%PATH%;%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\GnuPG\\bin\"\n. Another way: I'm pretty sure that if you install a new environment with conda, the resulting dir is moveable. So you could add the complete dir into e.g. cmder/vendor and just set the path in the same way as would activate.bat <env>.\n. I think a nice addition would be \"recipes\": currently clink and git are downloaded during the build process. I think it would be nice if there would be more such recipes (and the downloader would be included in the build), so that\n- you can update git and clink even without updating cmder\n- you can add more tasks/...\nIntegration would only be a printout how to enable msys or other packages (add to path, add a new task to conemu...)...\n. I currently use config\\aliases_jasc and source that in my user_startup.bat file. AFAI understand it, the current aliases are examples, not things the user should have/ are needed by cmder. \nIMO: move the current config\\aliases file to vendor\\aliases.example and let vendor\\init.bat copy that to the config dir, if it does not exist. And then let doskey load it.\n. If #736 gets merged, only ConEmu.xml and settings are in there. Not sure how to handle them, if it should go the same way as #735/#736, then cmder.exe must do the copy. \nBut on the other hand, I've actually no idea how the ConEmu.xml file is handled (https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/695 and https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/427). And actually, after the changes in the new release, I don't think I have to do anything in this files, so I'm fine after these two PRs :-)\n. I'm against a cmder controlled alias file if you couldn't \"unalias\" any alias in it.\n. Current status (for cmd): Only the conemu.xml file is overwritten, everything else is generated on first start.\n. yep... seems I forgot to look at the dev branch and master still has the old behaviour... sorry...\nwhy is there still a https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/development/config/ConEmu.xml ?\n. ok, but this is missleading: the file in config is still around after copying, so I assume that this is the file which is used. Would it be possible to add a link to the new config file and remove the old one? Also, shouldn't the initial file be in vendor and not in config as it is now only used to populate the intial state (see also https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/694)?\n. but it will get you of bugreports ala this one or:\n- why is my manual change in the conemu config file not applied (changed in config, but the one in vendor/conemu already existed so not updated) -> config is the place where I look for the user customisations.\n- I lost my conemu changes when I updates (deleted vendor subdirs, got old/obsolete file from config again (if config was not overwritten) or the new default file (if config got overwritten) -> #694)\n. If you do this, it would be nice to get a \"cmd as admin\" task.\nBTW: you can push to the branch and it gets refelected in the PR: either push more commits or rebase(squash/fixup,...)/commit --amend and force push (git push -f).\n.

What does it mean that you \"cannot use the context menu\" anymore. Does it just start up in the wrong dir?\nIf it is the latter, it could be this line in init.bat:\n@if defined CMDER_START (\n    @cd /d \"%CMDER_START%\"\n) else (\n    @if \"%CD%\\\" == \"%CMDER_ROOT%\" (\n        @cd /d \"%HOME%\"\n    )\n)\nIf so, it might help to change it to:\n@if \"%CD%\\\" == \"%CMDER_ROOT%\" (\n   @if defined CMDER_START (\n       @cd /d \"%CMDER_START%\"\n    ) else (\n       @cd /d \"%HOME%\"\n    )\n)\n. If sublm is a alias, then you could also just quote the first path like I did here with notepad++:\nnote=\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\" \"$*\"\n. Closed by #737\n. damn, that was too fast... new PR incoming with the rest of the changes...\n. Any news on this?\n. The latest dev version (branch \"development\") uses/advertises the agent script from git directly. Please check if that works and if not it's probably best to report it there.\n. If you want to have upstream support for that, it's best to add this to the git-for-windows repo (aka here: https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/blob/master/mingw-w64-git/start-ssh-agent.cmd). The agent script is gone in cmder, so cmder cannot do anything about it...\nIf your setup is so uncommon (I've no idea, I just followed an online tutorial and it worked...) that it is easier to do it on your side with a line of code, then just do it in user-profile.cmd. :-)\n. I can also confirm that the extra-line bug is gone when using io.popen(). Will send a PR...\n. Ok, waiting for news on #736, as that would conflict with this PR...\n. I've a working solution which sets the prompt in my personal config\\cmder.lua (after #736). Part of it sets the prompt in lua if the current prompt does not include a {lamb} anymore.

Another argument for doing the complete prompt work in lua: if you start a new cmd in a comder window, the prompt is ugly:\n```\nc:\\data\\external\\conda-packages\\conda-build-wheel (master)\n\u03bb cmd\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]\nCopyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. Alle Rechte vorbehalten.\nc:\\data\\external\\conda-packages\\conda-build-wheel {git}{hg}\n{lamb} exit\nc:\\data\\external\\conda-packages\\conda-build-wheel (master)\n\u03bb\n```\n-> no replacements of {...} and the colors (not shown :-)) are also not right.\nThis is one of my private setups where I implemented the above workaorunds and temporary disabled the prompt call in vendor/init.bat:\n```\nFound ssh-agent at 7612\nFound ssh-agent socket at /tmp/ssh-Cj5OAwywjb7p/agent.7904\nC:\\Users\\jschulz\n\u03bb cmd\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]\nCopyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. Alle Rechte vorbehalten.\nC:\\Users\\jschulz>exit\nC:\\Users\\jschulz\n\u03bb\n```\nThe colors are still broken (at least the first prompt from cmder doe snot retain it's green), but the second cmdline (which is from cmd, does not has a line break) does not include cmder stuff...\n. Just for clarification: in my understanding, the fix in #1070 won't change the two cases reported above in the two screenshots of https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/764#issuecomment-163801058:\nThe fix in #1070 only parses the current directory which is displayed one line above the current prompt, but does nothing with the current typed in command nor the  problem that clink doesn't find a file. I suspect that a newer clink version fixes both \"by accident\". \n. cmder is also registered as \"C:\\Users\\jschulz\\Dropbox\\Programme\\cmder\\Cmder.exe\" \"%V\" but the startup requires /START https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/development/launcher/src/CmderLauncher.cpp#L290\n. Whatever, adding it also didn't make cmder start up in the directory I rightclicked.\n. Ok, I think it's ok not to have /START in the context menu integration, but I think that the path argument is ignored in https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/development/launcher/src/CmderLauncher.cpp#L155 So in the moment it looks like the right click integration is broken? At least it doesn't work on my computer :-(\n. What should the outcome be here? \n- cmder /START <dir> (right click \"cmder here\") -> should overwrite all settings?\n- the tasks can specify it's own startup path \n- if a user sets CMDER_START -> not sure what priority that should have?\nIt seems for PS, the path gets applied to a registry key which is then used to set the CWD. For cmd, this registry key is ignored and CMDER_START env variable is used (which is not set by cmder.exe).  shell doesn't seem to change anything...\nUnfortunately, the init.bat file always overwrites the current dir with the \"%HOME%\" if CMDER_START is not set.\nIMO:\n- if a path is set in cmder /START <path>, this path should overwrite everything\n- if a user specifies a CMDER_START environment variable, it should be applied\n- as a last measure, the set working dir (by the task) should be taken last.\n- all tasks should set a working directory (which they do? -new_console:d:%USERPROFILE%)\nIMO this could be done by letting cmder.exe setting/overwriting CMDER_START if  path is set. And get that implemented in all startup scripts.\n. tried to make https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/772#issuecomment-170615849 happen in #798\n. I also have git extras installed in the user installed location, so I would prefer if the logic prefers a user installed location.\n. BTW: this is from another project where the git install path was needed:\n```\n:: find a git.exe in path and use that as a default dir\nwhere /Q git.exe\nif errorlevel 1 goto :nogitfound\nfor /F \"delims=\" %%F in ('where git.exe') do (\n    set bindir=%%~dpF\n    rem break after the first, so that we get the first in path\n    goto :break\n)\ngoto :nogitfound\n:break\nrem remove the last slash\nSET bindir=%bindir:~0,-1%\nfor %%G in (\"%bindir%\") do set GIT_INSTALL_PATH=%%~dpG\n``\n. https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/865 implements the idea of https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/782#issuecomment-169622265 by @vladimir-kotikov \n. @t5k6 Could you download a version from that PR (go to #865, click on the appveyor link -> go to artifacts) and check if this works for you? I do hope that the github for windows version of git is recent enough to have a\\cmd\\git.exe...\n. @t5k6 can you give me your path (**cmd** andpath) and also if your Github for Windows dir has acmddir and abindir an incmdis git + start-ssh-agent and in bin is git and a bash.exe?\n. The file not found problem should be fixed in a later version, I added a commit to fix that...\n. @t5k6 You installed github for windows and it didn't add itself to the path? Is\"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\GitHub\\Portab~1\"` the default path?\nI don't really want to add a special case for this: IMO:\n- If a userhas git in cmd, it should be available in cmder\n- if a user does not add git to the path, cmder has no right to do so and should use the one from vendor...\nThe help text then becomes If a git.exe from \"git for Windows 2.x\" is in path, it will be used. If not, and you have downloaded a full cmder release, the git which is included with cmder is used. If you have a portable installation of git and want that used, either include <git_path>\\cmd in path (setx PATH=%PATH%;<git_path>\\cmd) or use the user_profile.cmd to add it (and maybe the unix tools in <gitpath>\\usr\\bin) to the path via set path=%path%;<git_path>\\cmd;<git_path>\\usr\\bin\n. @thomgit Can you show us where VC2015 installs git too?\nThe current (aka next release) version of the cmd init.bat script will let you overwrite these git in two ways:\n- put your own git into path in front of the VS2015 git\n- Set %GIT_INSTALL_ROOT% env variable (outside of cmders config files!) so that %GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%\\cmd\\git.exe exist.\nhttps://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/development/vendor/init.bat#L44\n. This is a variable which is used in init.bat, I think it is only used there. It is not set by git itself.\nIf you want to have a preview, try the builds available here: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/1.0.256-development/artifacts They contain the \"where is git\" changes.\n. IMO for most users, preferring the user installed version over the included one is a good idea. There are several ways to overwrite that:\n- Just set %GIT_INSTALL_ROOT% to the git base dir so that %GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%\\cmd\\git.exe exists (source) -> setx  \"GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\git-for-windows\"\n- just add the \"right\" git in front of the \"wrong\" git or even remove the wrong path in your user-profile.cmd: \nSET \"PATH=%PATH:C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\\;=%\"; \n:: maybe also remove the /usr/bin and /usr/share/vom stuff...\nset \"GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\git-for-windows\"; \nset \"PATH=%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%\\cmd;%PATH%\"; \nset \"PATH=%PATH%;%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%\\usr\\bin;%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%\\usr\\share\\vim\\vim74\"\n. Actually, the rebase hints and the info if I'm behind the remote are also nice... :-)\n. @vladimir-kotikov Can you tell how you did the timing? That would make a nice test how to evaluate changes to this functions... :-) \nOr was that just the printouts?\n. IMO this error only means that .history is not yet created. AFAIK, this file is written when cmder is closed (and only has the commands available which were in the last closed cmder session).\n. ok, I should have tested that first:\n\u03bb history\ncat: %CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\.history: No such file or directory\nLooks like https://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/344?\n. And duplicate of https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/684 -> should be fixed by a updated clink, which is included in one of the newer dev builds.\n. Verified that this is fixed by installing the latest dev versions via appveyor: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/1.0.138-development/artifacts\n. I use this in config/user-startup.cmd (needs the changes in the development branch -> see the appveyor artifacts)\n```\n:: add my own scripts\n@set \"PATH=%PATH%;%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\heimdall\"\n@set \"PATH=%PATH%;C:\\portabel\\sdk\\platform-tools\"\n:: add unix commands from existing git -> last to get the right gpg from above and not from git...\n@set \"PATH=%PATH%;%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%\\usr\\bin\\\"\n```\nBut this shouldn't be needed if msql is included in the path (-> if it is useable in a plain cmd, it should be useable in cmd, as we only add to the path).\nCan you give the output of path in both cmd and cmder? \nIn your case something more seems to be broken as {lamb} and {git} is not replaced with the right values.\n. Close?\n. In addition, this should also get a vendor default which is copied to the config dir if it doesn't not exist there... Not sure how to do that, the only place to do that would be the cmder startup itself or duplicate the check+copy in all startups (bash+powershell+cmd)\n. Ok, there is a problem here: clink since 4bfdf04d59dab80e1ce76d7125c546006273e188 is using vendor as profile dir, so .history and setting are created there and used form there :-(\n. Closed in #794\n. Just a note: the current setup is broken as it places the clink files (mainly history and settings) in vendor\\ and not in config\\ since https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/commit/4bfdf04d59dab80e1ce76d7125c546006273e188. IMO cmder should not be release with that, either that should be reverted or this PR (or something similar) should be used.\n. ping?\n. If you run the development branch, simple add a whatever.lua in config/ with the following content:\n``` lua\nfunction prompt_filter()\n    clink.prompt.value = string.gsub(clink.prompt.value, \"{lamb}\", \">\")\nend\nclink.prompt.register_filter(prompt_filter, 10)\n```\n. This doesn't yet work with bash... But on the other hand, on my system there isn't even a startup script run for bash.\n. This should work in the latest dev version: #798\nTo get a recent verison of cmder, go to https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/771 and then click on the \"details\" link in the CI services box at the bottom of the page. From there, go to the \"Artefacts\" tab, where you find downloads of the latest version of cmder... \nPlease report if that fixed your problem...\n. I don't understand the need for this. With https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/798, there are a few ways to startup:\n- cmder here in windows explorer: will call cmder.exe <path> and cmder.exe will set CMDER_START which will be picked up by init.bat or profile.ps1 and change to that dir\n- if a user specifies a CMDER_START this will take the same path as long as cmder.exe isn't called with a path/ /START (e.g. by \"cmder here\" or a commandline startup)\n- if no path is supplied (e.g. by starting it up by a shortcut or plain cmder.exe in the shell), the current task definition will ensure that the shells are started in USERPROFILE which IMO are exactly the right dir to start in.\nSo IMO we are ok with the \"start in the right dir\" problem. Or what is still missing (-> whats the to be solved problem in #772)?\nIMO always setting CMDER_START will result that the task definitions startup dir will be useless, which I find not so nice, as it is quite a big button in the conemu UI.\n. Just to make that clear: the above is currently happening for PS and cmd, but not for bash tasks. To make that happen as well, this could be applied:\ndiff\ndiff --git a/vendor/cmder.sh b/vendor/cmder.sh\nindex 4d1da3a..9e21e31 100644\n--- a/vendor/cmder.sh\n+++ b/vendor/cmder.sh\n@@ -51,3 +51,8 @@ fi\n if [ -f \"${HOME}/.bashrc\" ] ; then\n     . \"${HOME}/.bashrc\"\n fi\n+\n+if [ \"$CMDER_START\" != \"\" ] ; then\n+    CMDER_START=\"$(cygpath -u \"$CMDER_START\")\"\n+    cd \"${CMDER_START}\"\n+fi\n[should be checked by someone familiar with bash...]\n. See inline comments: IMO always setting CMDER_START is wrong. what is the usecase for that?\n. Try find --help. Find is coming from the git package and therefore as the unix style arguments, where --help is the one to ask for help and not /? which is used for windows commandline tools.\n. I think the problem is that nc isn't available in git for windows (at least on my system, there is no nc.exe)\n. This is probably https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/791 -> should be gone in one of the newer dev builds\n. A workaround could be git add -- file.\nI don't see this problem, git add file complets here.\n. Updated with the right URL for the badge...\n. Some day I will learn the Difference between batch and badge...  Sorry and thanks for the merge!\n. I don't have an empty line:\nFound ssh-agent at 1488\nFound ssh-agent socket at /tmp/ssh-30Wurb96xHr8/agent.7040\nC:\\Users\\jschulz\n\u03bb\nBut I do have such a line in the first startup of a console:\n```\nRemoving old ssh-agent sockets\nStarting ssh-agent:  done\nEnter passphrase for /c/Users/jschulz/.ssh/id_rsa:\nIdentity added: /c/Users/jschulz/.ssh/id_rsa (/c/Users/jschulz/.ssh/id_rsa)\nC:\\Users\\jschulz\n\u03bb\n```\n-> In my case that looks related to the ssh agent :-/ But if I remember that correctly, that was a problem with agent.exe and not start-ssh-agent.bat :-/\n. I really like the idea (I've several different portable software packages under %CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor), but on the other hand also see it as a duplication of e.g. chocolatey. I suspect that if this PR is included, things like \"how do I update a package?\", \"How do I submit a new package?\", \"How do I depend on a different plugin?\" and so on will follow.\nRe Msys2: I don't think it's good to mess with the bundled stuff in git for windows (which you can already include in the path, so you get ls, rm and such stuff), but I see the value of an independently installed msys2...\n. Ok, I implemented that in https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/865\n-> Unix commands are always added to the end of the PATH.\n. Updated and repushed\n. I tink mainly because using echo off would also set echo off in the following cmd session.\n. Hm, interesting, I really wonder why this comment is in the start-ssh-agent script:\n@REM Do not use \"echo off\" to not affect any child calls.\nhttps://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/blob/master/mingw-w64-git/start-ssh-agent.cmd#L1\n\"Calls in the script\" vs \"calls after the script exits and the cmd is available for user commands\"?\n. Hm, interesting, I really wonder why this comment is in the start-ssh-agent script:\n@REM Do not use \"echo off\" to not affect any child calls.\nhttps://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/blob/master/mingw-w64-git/start-ssh-agent.cmd#L1\n\"Calls in the script\" vs \"calls after the script exits and the cmd is available for user commands\"?\n. Just to make sure:\nrunning this script and then runing a batch file without echo off will echo the commands?\nI just tried to simulate that by calling echo off in the normal cmder windows and then a script, and it didn't work:\n```\nc:\\data\\external\\cmder (where_is_git)\n\u03bb test.cmd\nwhere /Q git.exe\nif errorlevel 1 goto :VENDORED_GIT\ngoto :EOF\nc:\\data\\external\\cmder (where_is_git)\n\u03bb echo off\nc:\\data\\external\\cmder (where_is_git)\n\u03bb test.cmd\nc:\\data\\external\\cmder (where_is_git)\n\u03bb\n```\n.

Can you try the latest prereleases (Link is in the readme), this should be fixed.\n. Get one here: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/branch/development/artifacts\n. Maybe add an issue template which then includes a link to the Builds?\n. I usually do this when I want something added to the path in a cmd task (assumes the latest build, NOT the latest release):\n- add a new dir somewhere (I usually use\\vendor\\name_of_package)\n- edit\\config\\user-profile.batand include a line ala@set \"PATH=%PATH%;%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\heimdall\"(depends where the binaries are in that dir, a lot of times it's in a subdirbin`\n- restart cmder\nI have cmder added to my dropbox, so this makes heimdal (android flasher) available on all my computers where I have access to my dropbox.\n. With \"fired up\" you mean you double clicked on cmder.exe?\n. > When trying to open another instance of Cmder Cmder.exe /single C:\\ the directory always defaults to %USERPROFILE%. Now this is because the directory is set for the new console from ConEmu. In this scenario what appears to be happening is that the Environment Variable CMDER_START on the original Cmder instance (which is a wrapper for ConEmu?) will not be changed or set when /single is called.\nSomehow this sounds like a bug and maybe it is easier to find out why in that case CMDER_START is not set?\n. Ok, do I understand that right, that if I start cmder via an icon, the conemu process has no CMDER_START env variable. When I then start another cmder /single C:, this sets CMDER_START in the current process and starts a new conemu (which also still has that set), but this will find another conemu already running and passes control to that instance, but that instance has no CMDER_START set, so the started new child cmd will also not have it?\nIf so we have to look for another way to do this...\nThe normal startup (as far as I thought when I worked on the launcher code for CMDER_START) should have all this properties (in decreasing priority: first condition satisfied will win):\n- If the user specifies any dir to cmder <path>, it should startup in that path\n- if the user has specified CMDER_START as env variable, it should startup there\n- If the user sets a startup parameter in the ConEmu task spec, it should startup there.\n- The normal startup without any parameter and nothing set should startup in %USERPROFILE%\n\nI unfortunately don't have VS2015 and and friends installed on this machine, so I will review this later tonight as well.\n\nYou can download the built cmder form appveyor -> just follow the link in the \"checks\" to appveyor and there to the artefacts.\n. > Using %CMDER_ROOT% in profile initialization scripts is bad idea - they would fail if user starts just a ConEmu.exe.\nHow should we work around that? The only thing I can think of is using ConEmuDir env var to compute CMDER_ROOT in each startup script...?\n. >  I just wonder how much value is the environment variable CMDER_START?\nI wouldn't mind if it is gone... But others have to decide this.\nWhat makes this issue interesting is that if both CMDER_START and CMDER_ROOT would go away, there is IMO not much reason to keep the launcher around compared to using conemu directly... The only thing would be the copying of conemu config files on different machines...\n. See #974 \n. What is the error message?\n. Ok, can you please still post the error message and also the path where you installed cmder in? I suspect that it as something to do with spaces in your path, but actually can't really understand the problem because it is just a echoed variable and not something which is used programmatically (like the if not exist \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\settings\" ( line).\n. > There was no error. \nNo error message at all when you opened a new cmder window? Also: what is the full path to your cmder install location (e.g. in my case: C:\\Users\\jschulz\\Dropbox\\Programme\\cmder\\Cmder.exe)?\n. Can you try this here: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/1.0.267-development/artifacts\n. Could you also do me a favor and remove the @echo off at the start of the failing init.bat and report the output here? I can't reproduce in a c:\\temp\\test test\\ dir :-(\n. Ok, I think I found the problem: if the path has parentheses in it, it fails: C:\\temp\\test (test) does not work in the old version and in the current version, it still gives an error somewhere:\nEnhancing PATH with unix commands from git [C:\\Program Files\\Git]\n\"\\config\\user-aliases.cmd\" kann syntaktisch an dieser Stelle nicht verarbeitet werden.\n. See https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/941 for more such changes...\n. Can you try this here: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/build/1.0.267-development/artifacts\n. This is against master... :-/\n. Now against branch development, for the one against master see https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/939\n. I tested both this version and the previous development version ins a c:\\temp\\test test\\ dir, and both were starting up fine... No idea what the problem was, but if this fixes it, and it works for the rest, too...\n. There is also the idea to set the prompt in the clink lua code. at least for teh cmd path, this prevents the problem that you get a garbeled prompt when you call a new cmd:\n```\nc:\\data\\external\\R\\IRkernel (envs)\n\u03bb cmd\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]\nCopyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.

Close and reopen or run git commit --amend followed by a git push -f\n. As far as I can see choco devs for cmder are not the same as the devs for cmder itself, so I think it's easiest to ask the choco devs to build new package instead of here. \nAnd thats possible happening here: https://chocolatey.org/packages/Cmder/1.3.0-beta\n.

See https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/974 for the PR, please test... :-)\n. A different way would be to use the hg way (read lines and see if there are any) with git status -s -uno.\n. @sveggiani the 2 is not part of the git command, but part of the redirection: in this case it means that the file handle 2 (stderr, which gets the error output) should be redirected to the special file NUL (aka \"into nowhere\"). In effect this means that error output should be hidden.\nSee here fore more info: https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/redirection.mspx?mfr=true\n.

If that works, then you can add the set ... call to <cmder>\\config\\user-profile.cmd or use https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/985#issuecomment-227387888 but do not use set LANG=zh_CN.UTF-8 but only LANG=zh_CN.UTF-8 (without the set)\n. Just FYI: the development version now appends the additional commands https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/development/vendor/init.bat#L46-L93 The additional commands are still included but e.g. find is not shadowed. \n. @rakete: At least I came to cmder with the opposite assumption: finally getting proper unix commands :-)\n. @rakete: At least I came to cmder with the opposite assumption: finally getting proper unix commands :-)\n.

The {hg} should be replaced in the last step of building the hg part of the prompt with nothing. So this suggests that clink (which does the replacements) fails to do that step, but as the git branch name is there, it fails after that step. \nWhat happens if you put hg status or hg branch in a terminal?\n~~And: are you on the latest developent version?~~ Ok, indentified 160724 as the current date :-)\n. Seems that the replacement code can't handle non-ascii chars?\n```\nc:\\temp\n\u03bb mkdir \u00fc\nc:\\temp\n\u03bb cd \u00fc\nc:\\temp\\\ufffd\n\u03bb\n```\nIt works fine in a plain cmd window:\nc:\\temp\\\u00fc>\n. We currently do this:\nlua\n    cwd = clink.get_cwd()\n    prompt = \"\\x1b[1;32;40m{cwd} {git}{hg} \\n\\x1b[1;30;40m{lamb} \\x1b[0m\"\n    new_value = string.gsub(prompt, \"{cwd}\", cwd)\n    clink.prompt.value = string.gsub(new_value, \"{lamb}\", \"\u03bb\")\nSo my reading is that we can't pass the output of clink.get_cwd() to clink.prompt.value?\nCC: @mridgers (clink maintainer)\n. I think it does (letting the cmd set the prompt and then handling it in clink works...), just that the string has to get encoded... No idea how that works :-/\n. So, a bit of debugging (to a ANSI encoded file) shows this:\ncwd(string): c:\\temp\\\u00fc\nprompt(string): c:\\temp\\\u00c3\u00bc> # before any changes in lua\nprompt(string): \u001b[1;32;40mc:\\temp\\\u00fc {git}{hg}  # after changes in lua\nIf I interpete http://stackoverflow.com/a/14981670/1380673 and the unicode code points right, then \n[updated] \n- the prompt is utf and probably need to set encoded unicode (\u00c3\u00bc interpreted as windows1252 is encoded as c3 bc, which translates to \u00fc when interpreted as a unicode codepoint)\n- get_cwd() returns the path in windows-125x variants (at least it seems so on my system)\n[Note, I have changed my codepage to utf8: chcp  65001 but the same debug output happens with chcp 850 which is the default in a regular cmd window]\nSo this looks like a problem in clink :-(\n. I've taken that upstream: https://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/415\n. I can't reproduce: on my system with clink.prompt.value = clink.get_cwd() (not the last ()!) exactly the same happens:\nc:\\temp\\\ufffd\n. Please try https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/1070 for a version which parses the original prompt.\n. What does this mean, can you show a screenshot?\n[It works here, so I need a bit more information :-)]\n. > The message at the top of window is posted on every new cmd window I open, the \"additional *.lua\" etc.\n@fehrm Do you have writing rights in c: \\cmder? \n. What I find interesting is that the clink output is above the \"generating clink config\". That lines are only there to notify the user that the following lines calls clink and does all the real work (if called for the first time)...\n-> https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/vendor/init.bat#L27-L34\nSo my next guess would be that clink is installed to inject itself in all cmd sessions and output comes from the cmder clink not being able to inject itself and so not generating the config files in <cmder>\\config and therefore showing the message the next time?\n@fehrm Do you have clink installed in addition to cmder?\n. As we currently do not use the original prompt, you have to add conda information yourself: \nAdd a file called <cmder dir>\\config\\<something>.lua with the following content:\n``` lua\n-- Find out current conda env\n -- @return {false|conda env name}\n\nfunction get_conda_env()\n    env_path = clink.get_env('CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV')\n    if env_path then\n        basen = basename(env_path)\n        return basen\n    end\n    return false\nend\n\n-- add conda env name\nfunction conda_prompt_filter()\n    -- add in conda env name\n    local conda_env = get_conda_env()\n    if conda_env then\n        clink.prompt.value = string.gsub(clink.prompt.value, \"{lamb}\", \"[\"..conda_env..\"] {lamb}\")\n    end\nend\nclink.prompt.register_filter(conda_prompt_filter, 20)\n```\n. Please try https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/1070 for a version which parses the original prompt.\n. See here: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/1056\nI think we should do that automatically...\n. Oups, sorry... No, don't change anything in vendor, only place a file in config. The conda example needs to be adjusted (conda is an alternative to virtualenv) . In some place it looks for an environment variable CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV and this needs to be replaced with whatever virtualenv uses for this purpose (probably VIRTUAL_ENV according to my reading of https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/blob/master/virtualenv_embedded/activate.bat#L2).\n. So, what should we do here? I think cmder will get a lot of complains about missing environment names. I can guess a few ways to prevent that:\n- Add the above functions and prompt filters -> these will need updating for more environment commands (i hear node also has one?)\n- parse the actual prompt (e.g. in a prompt filter at step 0). This means that such a filter explicitly relies on  the default prompt value and that all such environment commands will do it in a similar way (e.g. get the environment name as the thing between the brackets (...).\n- Put up a big FAQ about this and that users have to add such filters themselves...\nMy preference would be the parsing (I think the problem with the garbled unicode path names makes parsing needed anyway).\n. Please try https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/1070 for a version which parses the original prompt.\n. What happens when you run git status --porcelain in that dir (in a cmd window)? \nAlso, what happens if you change the function (in vendor\\clink.lua) back to \nlua\nfunction get_git_status()\n     local file = io.popen(\"git diff --quiet --ignore-submodules HEAD 2>nul\")\n     -- This will get a table with some return stuff\n     -- rc[3] will be the signal, 0 or 1\n     local rc = {file:close()}\n     return rc[3] == 0\n end\n[I'm completely guessing here :-( ]\n. cmder only documents what's already available in the git package. The file is included in the git-for-windows package from the mingw packages: https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/blob/master/mingw-w64-git/start-ssh-agent.cmd\nAs far as I understand that file, it simply does a ssh-add call. According to the docs, it only auto loads certain keyfiles:\n\nssh-add adds private key identities to the authentication agent, ssh-agent(1).  When run without arguments, it adds the files ~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa and ~/.ssh/identity.\n\nI guess one idea would be to copy the start-ssh-agent.cmd script to a user controlled place and change that line to also list all keyfiles ssh-add should load: @\"!SSH_ADD!\" ~/.ssh/key1 ~/.ssh/key2.\nOr do a manual ssh-add ~/.ssh/your-other-key ~/.ssh/yet-another-keyfile in one session and have it available in all other cmder sessions. \nOr change the start-ssh-agent script to add a way to add more than one keyfile and submit a PR there :-) \n. See https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/pull/18 for a PR adding it upstream... If that is accepted, you can set \"SSH_ADD_ADDITIONAL_KEYFILES=keyfile1_rsa,keyfile2_rsa2\" before the start-ssh-agent call and get you additional keys...\n. @svenluijten It would be nice if you could try that PR: simply save the complete file from https://github.com/janschulz/MINGW-packages/blob/ea4dad14da8e7ad60c7b2e7eaaef9e138b7da563/mingw-w64-git/start-ssh-agent.cmd in <cmder>\\bin, set the additional keyfiles, kill the ssh-agent and restart cmder (or start-ssh-agent).\n. It seems the new git version and in particular the included openssh version has some other means to get a solution working: https://github.com/git-for-windows/MINGW-packages/pull/18#issuecomment-242432602 \n. This is https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/1054\n. @Stanzilla IMO this is a nice shortterm fix for the problem. If there is a better way (=proper unicode support in clink) , I will add a new PR.\n. What does babun add? Git for win looks pretty \"out if upstreams repo\" to me (I once build it from source), so I'm a bit surprised that there should be something missing (apart from stuff which depends on a working python, e.g. hg support).\nI didn't actually know that there is another distribution of git for windows... :-) \n. This line (the profile part) should get all lua scripts in config getting executed.\nbat\n:: Run clink\n\"%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\clink\\clink_x%architecture%.exe\" inject --quiet --profile \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\" --scripts \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\"\n. Can you do the same in a normal CMD and do a 'set' before and after?. The latest version should parse the env directly from the PROMPT variable: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/vendor/clink.lua#L30-L36 You don't need any workarounds anymore.\nCan you check that you have a recent enough cmder version (and of vendor/clink.lua) and if not update your cmder installation? . Seems to be this:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11008520/putting-in-string-gsub-in-lua\nI tried a few ways to escape it, but I wasn't successfull :-/. I added the following functions and replaces all string.gsub by replace:\n```\nfunction explode(separator, str, withpattern)\n    if ( withpattern == nil ) then withpattern = false end\n    local ret = {}\n    local current_pos = 1\n    for i = 1, string.len( str ) do\n        local start_pos, end_pos = string.find( str, separator, current_pos, not withpattern )\n        if ( not start_pos ) then break end\n        ret[ i ] = string.sub( str, current_pos, start_pos - 1 )\n        current_pos = end_pos + 1\n    end\n    ret[ #ret + 1 ] = string.sub( str, current_pos )\n    return ret\nend\nfunction replace( str, tofind, toreplace )\n    local tbl = explode( tofind, str )\n    if ( tbl[ 1 ] ) then return table.concat( tbl, toreplace ) end\n    return str\nend\n```\nthe functions are from https://github.com/garrynewman/garrysmod/blob/master/garrysmod/lua/includes/extensions/string.lua, which have no license attached :-(. Do you want the functions which are upstream without a license? . I'm not anymore using windows, and so also do not use cmder, so I cannot do this PR anymore :-(. IMO the easiest way to handle keys is putting AddKeysToAgent yes into ~/.ssh/config and then specifying key locations there:\n```\nAddKeysToAgent yes\nHost github.com-js\n    HostName github.com\n    User git\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_janschulz\n[more hosts with different keys]\ndefault at the last position\nIdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_janschulz\n```\nThis results in a password question when you first use that key and then you are done for that key for this session.\n. At least for the cmd promt (no idea about bash), you wuld need to add you own lua file which duplicates https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/vendor/clink.lua#L20-L49 and then register it after the cmder supplied one (command like here: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/vendor/clink.lua#L315-L316, eg.g use 2). This looks like an oversight: the normal launcher does not use /LoadCfgFile anymore\n. s/FIS/THIS/\n. Someone should review the last two lines (settings and conemu.xml)... This is just my current understanding of this...\n. See also https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/427\n. IMO this could be changed to config/*, only two files are missing: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/694\n. IM this is still a bad change: init.bat will now always set the path to Home if cmder isn't started with a path. This means that startup path in the conemu config is completely useless now :-(\nThis also means that you can't do what's asked for in https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/203\n. Is it really needed to copy a utils files into the bin directory (which is as I understand it for user scripts) and not use it via  CMDER_ROOT?\n. Again, I don't think this should be installed into bin, because bin (the same as config) is under the user's control and therefore changes by the user should not be overwritten, but installing into bin would do this.\nOn the other hand, I don't see a better dir... The only way would be to put the script into a vendor/cmder dir, which the user then needs to call by absolute name or to add that dir to the path... \n. Ok, the readme doesn't say anything else than \"it will be in path\" and it already has the alias.bat in it... Still seems untidy (like the stuff in config until it got mostly reorganized), but ok... :-)\n. The \"bad\" thing is, that this gets installed, so updating a package is basically releasing a new version of cmder...\n. Maybe it makes sense to rename that as well?\n. Shouldn't this also do some test for the version and only complain if the same (or a higher) version number is already installed?\n. Sorry, I mean the sources-plugins.json file. If thats is included in the cmder installer, the included versions are then only up to date on the release day of cmder and later probably out of date :-(\n-> IMO this needs a path in the cloud which can change much more frequently...\n. The latter: config\\aliases\n. I'm actually not sure if this is a nice thing to keep the ...\\bin version: the problem is that if the user has added git to the path (via the git for windows installer), then bash is not found as the installer does not add bin to the path.\nIMO both version should result in the same apps visible in path... Not sure how to ensure that, probably by setting GIT_INSTALL_PATH and then unconditionally adding the bin path?\n. Typo?\n. Nice find, sorry for this problem!\n. s/alaises/aliases?\n. I actually like this output in the console...\n. LOG_DEBUG (and LOG_INFO)? \n. IMO this should be setable from outside the init.bat...\n. No, instead of verbose-output: I've never seen \"verbose_output\", but LOG_DEBUG is everywhere :-)\n. Nice, thanks!\n. ",

That key binding works with doskey, and from a cmder shell I see that 'doskey /history' is always empty. \nIt looks like this is because clink is handling the history and does not support F7 [1] or any other way of listing the history [2].\n[1] https://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/138\n[2] https://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/172\n. Ah, I had been wondering the same thing. Thanks @sc0tt !\n. This is a limitation of doskey, which provides the cmd.exe support for aliases (macros). You actually can't use a macro after && at all. \nFor example:\n\u03bb alias np=notepad.exe\n\u03bb cd C:\\Users && np\n'np' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\nwhereas this works fine without the macro:\n\u03bb cd C:\\Users && notepad.exe\nMacros only work as the first part of a command. See http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490894.aspx, specifically:\n\"To run a macro, type the macro name starting at the first position on the command line... You [also]  cannot run a doskey macro from a batch program.\"\n. Will do, thanks.\n. Any advice on dealing with pull requests and the development branch? Apparently my git-fu is lacking in this area and my pull request is picking up additional commits. \n. Never mind, think I sorted myself out. I've submitted a new pull request #304.\n. I recommend not changing the documented behavior of 'cd' with no switches (i.e. show the current directory). Why not use cd ~ for the \"go home\" command?\n. @fuzzyweapon I agreed with your concerns when I read this, but looking at the code this patch does not actually introduce p and h as commands outside the context of cd. The implementation is using cd /p and cd /h. \nAlso, seems like this variation of cd is reimplementing the existing pushd and popd commands. \n. I'm seeing this same problem with a fresh install of Cmder v1.2, I'm using the version of msysgit packaged with Cmder:\n```\n\u03bb set git\nGIT_INSTALL_ROOT=C:\\opt\\cmder\\vendor\\msysgit\n\u03bb where git\nC:\\opt\\cmder\\vendor\\msysgit\\bin\\git.exe\n\u03bb git --exec-path\nC:\\opt\\cmder\\vendor\\msysgit/libexec/git-core\n```\n. I compared that libexec\\git-core with my old cmder 1.1.4 installation, and basically all the commands are missing.\n(later)\nLooks like this was an intentional change, so maybe it is unrelated. Other git commands seem to work (log, status, branch, fetch, remote, etc). But pull does not:\n\u03bb git pull\ngit: 'pull' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.\nAdding that git-core dir to the path doesn't work, not does setting the exec-path explicitly (I thought perhaps the mixed slashes were an issue):\n\u03bb git --exec-path=C:\\opt\\cmder\\vendor\\msysgit\\libexec\\git-core pull\ngit: 'pull' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.\nMy suspicion here is that not all the files in libexec\\git-core should have been removed? With some trial and error I got a bit farther by copying files from my old cmder 1.1.4 git install, specifically:\n\u03bb ls\ngit-pull*  git-sh-i18n  git-sh-setup  git.exe*  mergetools/\nThat isn't quite enough, but now the pull works up until it tries to call merge:\n\u03bb git pull\nC:\\opt\\cmder\\vendor\\msysgit/libexec/git-core\\git-pull: line 321: exec: git-merge: not found\nfatal: 'pull' appears to be a git command, but we were not able to execute it. Maybe git-pull is broken?\n. An '&' is used to execute multiple commands. This:\nset foo = this & that\nis interpreted as two commands:\nset foo = this\nthat\nYou can get the right behavior like this, which might not be intuitive:\nset \"foo = this & that\"\n. The PATH fragment can be removed by finding this in the ConEmu.xml:\n<value name=\"CmdLineHistory\" type=\"multi\"><line data=.../></value>\nand remove the line element, i.e.\n<value name=\"CmdLineHistory\" type=\"multi\"/>\nThe other one will show the full command for whatever console you last created. I don't see a way to turn that off -- personally I'd like to just not have the previous item there, but guess that would be a ConEmu feature. \n. This may be the same issue as  #521.\n. Sorry for the noise -- accidentally created this against the wrong branch.\n. git svn is another command that doesn't work.\n. For a cmd shell, the git prompt magic is implemented with a lua script that registers a prompt handler with clink. \nIf you don't want it I believe you can comment out the clink.prompt.register_filter lines toward the end of your cmder/config/cmder.lua file.\n. You can copy the cmder shortcut to your Windows startup folder. On Windows 8 that would be:\nC:\\Users\\<User Profile folder name>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\n. Open the ConEmu Settings dialog (e.g. Win + Alt + P) and look for:\nMain - Task Bar - Auto minimize to TSA\nAlso you can edit the properties for your cmder shortcut and change the Run: option to start minimized.\n--EDIT--\nActually, changing the shortcut to run minimized doesn't seem to work. The ConEmu settings has Main - Size & Pos settings to let you position the window,  but I don't see an option to start minimized. ConEmu does support a command-line option to start minimized, but I don't see any way to pass that via Cmder.\n. A workaround to run cmder minimized.\nCreate a Cmder.bat in your root cmder folder, based on this: https://github.com/bliker/cmder/blob/master/Cmder.bat\nAdd /MIN to the arguments passed to ConEmu:\nstart %~dp0/vendor/conemu-maximus5/ConEmu.exe /MIN /Icon .....\nThen create a shortcut to your bat file and drop it in your startup folder. \nOne downside of this approach is there is a cmd.exe window that flashes briefly when the script runs, but it does provide the behavior you want when combined with the 'Auto minimize to TSA' setting. \nA potentially useful enhancement to Cmder would be to support a /MIN argument that gets passed through to ConEmu.\n. I suspect this is the same issue as #521.\n. The prompt for a cmd.exe shell running under Cmder is configured by the script cmder\\config\\cmder.lua. \nLua script configuration is a feature of clink (http://mridgers.github.io/clink/), which Cmder includes. I'm not sure powerline is possible here, since ultimately that lua script is just setting the Windows cmd.exe PROMPT variable. But you could ask over at the clink project, perhaps.\n. @AbdelrahmanHafez Whitespace is not relevant here -- with doskey macros you need to use $b as the pipe character, otherwise you are just piping the output of 'create an alias for ping -t 8.8.8.8' -- which is nothing. \nThat said, your example does not work for me either.  I just tried a few variations piping output to awk (e.g. even a simple echo) and can't get it to work in an alias. This may be a case where writing a simple bat file and putting it in your path is the way to go. \n. Yes. Open the Settings window and navigate to Keys & Macro. In the list of key bindings you will find a number of keys for working with split windows, prefixed with \"Split: \". \nWhat you are looking for is \"Split: Move splitter downward\" and related keys for moving the splitter in all directions. You can try the default key bindings or edit to set your own keys. \n. By default this is bound to Apps+F. \nYou can change the binding via the Settings dialog. Go to 'Keys & Macro' and look for the row for 'Find text in active console'. \n. No one else seeing this? I'm on Window 8.1 and can reproduce directly after extracting cmder.7z, with no config changes:\n```\nC:\\Users\\glucas\n\u03bb history\ncat: %CMDER_ROOT%\\config.history: No such file or directory\nC:\\Users\\glucas\n\u03bb cat %CMDER_ROOT%\\config.history\ncat: C:\\Users\\glucas\\cmder\\config.history: No such file or directory\nC:\\Users\\glucas\n\u03bb touch %CMDER_ROOT%\\config.history\nC:\\Users\\glucas\n\u03bb history\ncat: %CMDER_ROOT%\\config.history: No such file or directory\n```\n.

Yes, the the dev build of clink fixes the problem. Thanks!\n. +1, I'm seeing this as well. The 'current location line' is the prompt (as defined by the PROMPT environment variable), but not sure why resizing the window causes the prompt to be displayed multiple times.\n. The error indicates that ls is not on your PATH. Cmder includes an ls executable as part of the git distribution, which is added to the PATH by the default cmder\\vendor\\init.bat script.\nFrom my shell I can see that ls is on the path:\n\u03bb where ls\nC:\\opt\\cmder\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\usr\\bin\\ls.exe\n. There are a couple things you should investigate:\nWhat is currently on your cmder shell path? Use set PATH to see the semicolon-delimited list of path entries. Presumably there are entries there for cmder and some of its subdirectories. \nHave you installed some version of Git outside of cmder? \nDoes your cmder installation include git as it should? I've installed v.1.2.9 of cmder, is that what you have or do you have something older? In my case git is installed here: \ncmder/vendor/git-for-windows\nand the ls executable is \ncmder/vendor/git-for-windows/usr/bin/ls.exe\nEither something is wrong with your installation and you are missing those directories/files, or you have them but your PATH does not include the directory for some reason. If you do have the files you can try adding the directory containing ls.exe to your path from the shell, e.g. \nset PATH=C:\\cmder\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\usr\\bin;%PATH%\nThen try ls and see if it works. If so, you can copy that same line to your cmder/config/user-startup.cmd file to make the change permanent. (If you're on an older version of cmder you may not have the file and would have to put this somewhere else). \n. The 'where' command is showing you the results in the order they are in your PATH. So the ls.exe you don't want is being found first in your PATH. \nIt seems like you have Z:\\ as an entry in your PATH ahead of git. You could find where that is coming from and remove it, or you can add some commands to your cmder user_profile.cmd to make sure the git bin dir is added to the front of your PATH. . This is a duplicate of #684. There is a workaround described there.\n. I have the following alias to rename the current cmd tab:\ntitle=cmd /c RenameTab \"$*\"\n. I like this pattern for bat files etc:\n@echo off\n@if not \"%ECHO%\"==\"\" echo %ECHO%\nBy default echo is off, but it makes debugging easy as you can temporarily 'set ECHO=on' in your shell.\n. In my git-for-windows install the string \"cannot be used without a working tree\" occurs in two places, in  the git-sh-setup script under cmder/vendor/(etc). It's either a result of calling\ngit rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null\nwhich should be true, or \ngit rev-parse --is-bare-repository\nwhich should be false. \nLooks like git-stash sources git-sh-setup and then calls require_work_tree, which is the first case listed above.\nFor the folks having problems, does it make a difference if you try the git command from a cmd.exe shell vs a bash shell?

History is a clink feature -- there are a bunch of questions/feature requests related to history over at https://github.com/mridgers/clink.

'+')\n        clink.matches_are_files()\n        return true\n    end\nend\nThe one funny thing is the second bogus match to prevent a space being added, since the path may not actually be complete just by replacing the ~. For example:\n\u03bb cd ~\\b<TAB>\n\u03bb cd c:\\Users\\jdoe\\b<TAB>\n\u03bb cd c:\\Users\\jdoe\\bin\\\n. I've seen this problem before, but haven't had it in a while.

If you don't have C:\\Windows\\System32 on your PATH then you will probably have lots of issues.

You can try starting a cmd.exe shell directly and seeing what the PATH is there (set PATH), or check the Windows environment variables via the system properties dialog.. Any chance you have a .bash_profile as well?

The executable launcher in 1.1.4 fixes this problem.\n(The problem is caused by the fact that the old launcher was just a batch file that started the ConEmu executable, so it was that executable that got pinned.  With a real executable launcher, the proper thing gets pinned.)\n. That'll teach me to comment without double checking the numbers.  I was thinking of 1.1.2 which is the last version with the batch scripts.  This works perfectly for me in 1.1.3.\n. @dcominottim You can also try the modified launcher that I built for #159, and see if you still have a problem using that one.  You can get just that file from https://github.com/kohenkatz/cmder/raw/fix-context-menu/Cmder.exe\n. I have two Windows 8.1 computers, and this works properly on one of them but not the other.  I will try to see if I can compare them and figure out the difference.\n. @lowjoel I wonder if that is not the only issue - on both of my computers, Cmder is installed in C:\\Programs\\ because that is where I put all programs that are \"extract-and-drop\".  However, as mentioned, it works on one but not the other.\n. Here are my findings:\n- On the computer that works properly, the Inspector shows that the Pinned Icon points to C:\\Programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe and the running executable is the same.\n- On the other computer, the behavior is very weird:\n  - If the program is not pinned, then when I run it, the Inspector shows the correct path (same as above).  If I right-click and choose \"Pin\", the path in the Inspector stays the same but the plain ConEmu shortcut is pinned.  If I then unpin the incorrect shortcut again, the path in the Inspector changes to be blank.\n  - If I pin the program manually before I run it (by dragging from Windows Explorer onto the taskbar), then the Application ID of the pinned icon is {B07861F7-51BF-4106-B2A4-DA00BECC485C}\\Cmder.exe!  However, when I click it, the running application has the expected Application ID - C:\\Programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe - which causes a second icon to be created.\nThe only other place that I can find this GUID is in the Shortcut that was created when I did \"Pin to Start\" - it appears that dragging the program from Explorer just gets a copy of that shortcut.  Dumping the .lnk file using lnk-parser, I see that the field in the shortcut that sets contains this value is named System.AppUserModel.ID.  More testing shows that when I program is pinned to the Start Screen, Windows assigns it a GUID.  If the same program is then pinned to the Taskbar, Windows uses the same GUID for its App ID.\nUnpinning Cmder from the Start Screen, pinning it to the Taskbar, and then repinning it to the Start Screen has solved my problem.\n. @lowjoel No, I don't.  When you pin an executable to the Start Menu, Windows dynamically creates this GUID for the folder it is in.  If you unpin it and then pin it again, Windows will assign a new GUID instead of using the same one.  This is true for any executable in any folder - or, at least, for every single one that I have tested.\nThe issue is just that it then uses that for the pinned shortcut on the Taskbar too.\nThe proof, AFAIK, that it's not a special shell path is that you can't navigate to it by pasting that GUID in Windows Explorer's address bar.\n. @MartiUK Mine isn't in Program Files (x86), it's in C:\\Programs\\ which is a folder I created myself just to keep all of my extracted programs in one place.\n. @RDeluxe Check if you have the \"Special Folder Name\" problem that I had above.\n. @winston01 I'm not sure where you got the idea that the new release has no cmder.exe. The source files of the executable still exist in the Git repository, just not a built version of the executable.  If you check out the code from Git instead of downloading the release zip files, you will have to build the executable yourself.\n. @winston01 you have to compile the executable yourself when you are on the development branch.  Look in the launcher folder in the source for the code.\n. I'd guess that this is exactly the same underlying issue as #154.\n. Why was this reverted? Does it not work in some cases? If so, what cases?  Will it be reintroduced later on?\n. OK. I didn't see your comment on #256.  Since that was 14 days ago and the original submitter hasn't responded, I'll put in a new PR for development.\n. That's weird! Closing this one and I'll try again.\n. I'm not sure I understand your description of the issue. Can you do a fresh install of cmder and write down exactly the steps you take to reproduce this problem?\n. The issue here appears to have something to do with the Git prompt. I can reproduce it when I am inside a Git repo, but everything works normally when in a directory that is not a Git repo.\n@SOSANA Can you confirm that it works properly in another directory that isn't a Git repository?\n. I'm still not sure what you mean about the problem with the text color. As far as I know, the text you type is always supposed to be the same color.

I don't fully know the context of this issue, since the original line has changed. ### How to integrate Cmder with Android studio \u2013 related: #282 \nHere are the full steps to integrate Cmder perfectly with Android Studio:\n1. Assuming you have the latest version of Cmder, go to the installation directory and create a new file named cmder_shell.bat, with the following content:\n@cmd.exe /k %0\\..\\vendor\\init.bat\n1. Open settings in Android Studio (Ctrl+Alt+S) and type terminal in the search box\n2. In the Shell path, change cmd.exe to the following:\nC:\\path\\to\\cmder\\cmder_shell.bat (make sure to replace C:\\path\\to\\cmder to your installation directory, or it's better to define an environment variable instead.)\nAt any time, press ALT-F12 to run Android Studio's terminal with Cmder.\n\n\nWe have an this guide available in the wiki here:\n* https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki/Seamless-IntelliJ-based-Integration\n. @Stanzilla This is a real issue. Tested it out, not a problem of ConEmu or Clink. Any idea what causes it in Cmder?. @Stanzilla this seems so useful to have! Could you approve it?. Interesting. I believe Tmux + Clink + Cmder would make a great combination in Cmder.. Tested on several RDP instances, it doesn't look slow at all to me. If you use a VPS, it could have lower resources than expected, or have more CPU consumption.\nIf it's still slow for you, please disable some ticks at Experience tab of RDP, see if that helps.\n\n. @Stanzilla could you close this issue?. @andersamer Could you check and test again? If this issue is resolved, please close it.. @hackhowtofaq Is issue still relevant? I get -/0-/0 on both Command Prompt and cmder on my machine.\nTry this instead:\necho %date:~0,4%-%date:~5,2%-%date:~8,2%. @Stanzilla on the subject of branches, if the development isn't getting much activity and even seems to be obsolete, could you remove it? I was also confused when I first tried to make a PR.. @Maximus5 does ConEmu have a feature to color the tabs?. @Maximus5 should I recreate this issue at ConEmu repo?. @Stanzilla Add to the docs and close?. I believe a fix for #1564 in general would solve this issue and related unix flavored git problems.. Personally, I use Cygwin with Cmder, which provides a near-real implementation of Gnu's tools (unix commands) and an amazing Bash.\nYou can also use the vendored Git bash with Cmder, but it's less powerful.\nRunning Nano in Cygwin with Cmder:\n\nRunning VSCode with Cygwin on Cmder:\n\n. @Stanzilla @daxgames How about not specifying anything, and launch bash from user's %PATH%?\nI mean should the user have installed any other bash (WSL, msys2, Cygwin) without a Git, it should run that too.. @daxgames We should devise a plan on Cmder first launch:\n1) Cmder full: use the vendored git unchanged\n2) Cmder mini:\n    a) Git exists on any directory in path: modify ConEmu.xml to use that\n    b) No Git or Bash exist at all: remove the option from ConEmu.xml\nHow about it?. @Stanzilla not necessary on build time, it can be done on runtime. On each startup, if bash is not found in the predefined path, the item should disappear.\nI personally prefer not to have unnecessary changes between the full and minimal version, and keep the differences to a minimal.. @daxgames While documenting this issue in README is an acceptable alternative to fixing a problem that we're sure not a lot of people might occur, I think it's still a better solution to try and fix it IF a) the fix is easy and b) it doesn't break other parts of Cmder.\nRegarding in naming it cmder bash I'd say it would be an appropriate name because the way cmder currently handles it is by only calling vendored Git's bash.\nThis is acceptable behavior to many users of Cmder, and this issue can be closed. However, I'd like to ask to write a fix for it, by changing a small portion of Cmder logic: creating the ConEmu.xml based on user machine's configuration. That way a better (an easier) integration between Cmder and external shells installed on user's machine is guaranteed.\n I'd also like to write a logic for Cmder to check Git in `init.bat`. If no vendored or external Git is found, it should skip Git-related setups. \n. @Stanzilla that'd also make sense,\n\nif Git is not found don't initialize it\nif bash is selected but not found, show sensible error\non first launch if mini version, remove bash from tasks\n\nThat way we'd avoid this issue on fresh installs, and won't introduce breaking changes to previous installs by displaying an appropriate message.. @0ctothorp Is this issue fixed? I just tested on my machine and it duplicated without any issue.\n\n. @Stanzilla could you close the issue?. This is what I use to launch Bash from Cygwin in Cmder:\n(Obviously, you need to edit to suit your needs.)\n@echo off & cd /d %0\\..\nset PWD=%~1\nset CMDER_ROOT=C:\\development\\cmder\nset CYGWIN_ROOT=C:\\development\\cygwin\nset BASH_COMMAND=pushd \"%CYGWIN_ROOT%\" ^& \"%CYGWIN_ROOT%\\bin\\bash\" --login -i -c 'cd \"`cygpath -au '%PWD:\\=/%'`\"; exec bash' ^& popd\nset CONEMU_SWITCHES=-new_console:m:/mnt -new_console:a\nstart \"Cygwin Shell\" %CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu.exe /icon \"%CYGWIN_ROOT%\\bin\\mintty.exe\" /title Bash /loadcfgfile \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\ConEmu.xml\" /cmd cmd /c \"%BASH_COMMAND%\" %CONEMU_SWITCHES%\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/337#issuecomment-336660942\nTo show up in context menu when you Right-click:\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Directory\\Background\\shell\\bash_shell\\command\nSet (Default) to: \"C:\\path\\to\\cmder-bash.bat\" \"%v\"\n\n. @MartiUK done, #1658 . An issue with the space in directory path has been fixed in #1696. @MartiUK & @Stanzilla Could you please add this issue to the v1.4 release project (marked as ready)?\nI'd like to see this patch in the next major release. If this issue is still reproducible, please run the following:\n git --version\n where git\nand post the results here.. Choco/scoop/apt-cyg/sage are popular choices.. #1310 related?. @Stanzilla Do you approve this feature to be implemented? I already made a PR to @daxgames's branch (assuming my method is accepted.). @DmitriyK-CPKIO This feature has been implemented into cmder (nightly builds for now, it will be released once tested and verified to work correctly.)\nWe're also working on limiting the path depth (if it get's too long, it could possibly get truncated on Windows.) Could you specify usually how many directories you keep in the /bin directory?. Since this issue is related to how ConEmu works, a modification based on this would work (I use a variation of that myself).\nThe question is, whether the moderators approve of changing the default behavior in favor of tabs.\nPersonally I think using tabs is a much better solution, and a window per context menu is pointless.. @mew1033 Cmder launches ConEmu by calling it from the Cmder.exe binary.\nYou'll have to either compile Cmder.exe with this option built it, or modifying the Registry key for the context menu to run ConEmu with the switch directly.\nI went with the latter at the time of writing my comment.\n\n@daxgames Could you add this option to the launcher code?\ne.g. Cmder.exe /newtab %v could be used to open a new tab in ConEmu.. For future visitors, with the commits in #1665, there seems to be no need for the batch file mentioned in the above answer. This has been also stated here.\n\n. @tyler36 As discussed in #1861, I think this is due to a problem in PHP binaries for Windows. I don't think that the same issue will happen by using something like chalk for example.\nAs I can see in your screenshot, the Clink part of Cmder has color, but phpcs which calls PHP binaries don't have color output correctly.. @tyler36 Thanks for the follow-up! Another reason to update to the 7.2.x branch of PHP on Windows.. Thanks for posting the details and including screen shots. Please also issue where g++ and post the result here to see if any path in the %PATH% variable is interfering with the msys installation.. @Ekwy Please post the contents of main.cpp. Specifically, are the required header files included?\nPlease also test if the following compiles:\n```[C++]\ninclude \nint main()\n{\n  std::cout << \"Hello World!\" << std::endl;\n  return 0;\n}\n``. @Stanzilla I'm confused. This patch is approved but not merged yet?. @daxgames Added a full section regarding the changes inREADME.md. Could you confirm?. @daxgames Cygwin (or any unix falvored build of Git) returns something in the lines of:git version 2.15.0.1`.\nI tested it out before pushing it to master, and it was able to return and parse both the vendored and user binaries.\nWhat was the verboose output when you posted this? Is the issue fixed now?. @daxgames Great PR! One question though, does this remove the block where returned git version string is matched to verify its format?. @daxgames I reviewed your edits and tested it on my machine.\nAs you modified, the version comparing seems to also work perfectly on paths with spaces.\nAside from them, I also ran into an odd problem when executing init.bat /v:\nShould this happen?\n\n. @daxgames no, I launched everything from cmder/vendor directory. As I launched init.bat directly, it seems that cmder_root was not set. Which makes me think:\n\nIt should detect if the variable is not set, instead of setting it to the root of the drive\nIt should set the variable accordingly.\n\nThis only happened when I turned on the verbose mode with the /v switch, and not when I manually set the variable set verbose-output=1 in init.bat. that's what I was referring to, as odd :). @daxgames Personally, I think this fixes the problem.. BTW @daxgames for now, let's keep :enhance_path and :read_version in the init.bat under the subroutines section. We'll split them into the /bin in future PRs.. @daxgames Nice work then, actually! What branch are you committing these on?\nAlso, could you allow me to commit the lib_git.cmd so it keeps my handle in the history? Thanks! :). @daxgames - My test results:\n- Launching Cmder on an existing upgraded environment - PASS!\n- Launching Cmder in a new environment - PASS!\n- Calling init.bat from other Terminals than ConEmu - PASS!\n- Git version comparing - PASS!\n- Recursive Directory Path Enhancing - PASS!\n- Path Enhancing Depth Limit - PASS!\nLooks good to me! (P.S. I think /home argument should set both %HOME% and %USERPROFILE%, otherwise I don't see the indication.)\n@Stanzilla Please perform further (extensive) tests when you're back. Either way, this seems fine to merge, considering that this is a pre1 release. If releasing it uncovers any issues, we could fix them in the rc release.. @i-s-o I agree with some of the changes you mentioned. We'd appreciate if you made a PR!\n@daxgames Can you hold the merge before @i-s-o also confirms that the problems are fixed?. @daxgames This whole situation is so odd! I cloned the branch rather than downloading appveryor's builds, so I'm glad it was found before releasing. Thanks, @i-s-o!. @xelra Vote up for merging CmdEx into Cmder, alongside Clink!. There is a fork of Cmder called shark which appears to have an installer (untested by us).\nHowever, the beauty of Cmder is that it's completely portable. It doesn't really need an installer. :). @DaemonPhoenix42 What do you think about https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/1695#issuecomment-371367810 as a user?. Could you do echo %HOME% and echo %USERPROFILE%? I see a \" (quotation mark) at the end of your HOME variable.. Make sure C:\\Users\\ladis\\.ssh exists (mkdir .ssh) - from past experience, that's sometimes the problem.\nJust to be sure, please also issue where ssh. It could be another ssh installation interfering.. @ladislavsulc Hm this seems to be an chocolatey issue rather than cmder \u2013 you can confirm this if you get the same results by running the same command in cmd.exe rather than Cmder.\nIn addition to which ssh, please post ssh -V. You might have an outdated version of OpenSSH installed. The best practice is using Cmder with either Cygwin (which has ssh built in), or easier to use vendored Git with cmder.\nAlso, I like to mention that the screenshots are much appreciated :)\n. I like to mention that @MartiUK has already done an awesome job for writing a CONTRIBUTING.md at: cmder/CONTRIBUTING.md.\nSince it seems that every feature branch has its own name (@daxgames's great practice), I agree with @Stanzilla on dropping development, and sticking to the CONTRIBUTING.md's guide. Best practice to avoid confusion for newcomers like me!. @daxgames This seems reasonable, but against the \"Lib it\" branch. @daxgames @gucong3000 Also MinGW should only be added to path, if vendored Git is decided to be used by init.bat.. @daxgames You might want to squash and merge this, because of the sloppy commits.. Related issues: #1688 #1261 #104 \nAlso on another note, I know \u03bb is an iconic part of Cmder, but an option for the user to customize it would be nice.. @Stanzilla is this able to merge? I want to work on  another branch to customize the prompt character and color.. Subscribed!. Related issue - #1564. ## Running VS Code with Cygwin on Cmder\n. More info: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/12006. @GavinLi369 Please do a where vi.exe and post the screen shot here.. @GavinLi369 Thanks for the translation, please do this instead:\nwhere vim.exe\n. @GavinLi369 Okay, could you do this please?\nvim.exe --version. @GavinLi369, ok, so I can confirm that you are using the latest version from the Cmder's vendored Git.\nSome things to consider:\n- Does running E:\\Program Files\\cmder\\vendor\\git-for-windows\\usr\\bin\\vim.exe from Windows CMD.EXE result the same way?\n- Did you resize your Cmder window when you were in VIM?. @GavinLi369 Thanks for the result, I'm afraid to say that this is not an issue of Cmder, though we appreciate you reporting it.\nThis is most probably an issue related to the msys32's Git for windows installation of VIM, with which each of them may lay the problem.\nPersonally, I use the slightly less useful Nano editor on both Linux an windows, but I recommend opening an issue here to report this misbehavior of VIM on windows:\nhttps://github.com/vim/vim/issues\nThis would fix the problem for others as well, if the authors of VIM find it reproducible.\n(As always, it's recommended to look for closed issues first.)\nAnother option is to ignore this, and use an alias to clear screen after you exit VIM, which is personally my favorite. Like so: vi=vim $* ^& clear\nI hope this helps you. :). @Stanzilla, @MartiUK and @daxgames. Thoughts?. @Stanzilla Thanks! Also feel free to edit issue_template.md if anything else needs to be added there, though I tried to think of everything. :)\nI hope this makes you and the other maintainers' work a bit easier.. @daxgames I believe the best practice is to move as much as possible from the C++ launcher to init.bat, that way it would be more customizable.\nMy best best is to use the launcher as an interface for init.bat that only receives the arguments, and pass it directly to the init.bat.. Then running init.bat in each session should be considered (although it makes each session slightly slower, but I'm all for it.) Clink could be avoided for bash shells by I imagine it would be useful from the poweshell shells.\nAs discussed in #62, the launcher script was originally meant as a fix to #39, to be able to be pinned to the taskbar. So, I think doing a complete rewrite of it should be in order, while focusing more on the init.bat.\nAlso, setting the environmental variables are not the only way to pass arguments to init.bat (though it may be the best.) We could also use a separate config file as discussed in #1695 \u2013 I imagine the variables won't change that often and init.bat can generate the rest (I do know that some should be generated on fly.)\nI can work on the launcher script, even use some outline from @Maximus5's source code for ConEmu launcher. (I would also like to add DPI-awareness and Win32's TaskDialog API to the launcher's code, like what Maximus5 has currently written for ConEmu.)\nIn any case, we should consider first whether including init.bat in each session should be done or not. I vote for it to be done.. @daxgames We could also switch to C# as it's more versatile, though I'm not sure if that would be acceptable by adding yet another dependency (.NET) just for the sake of the launcher.. Yeah, I personally hate the extra dependencies as well. Since init.bat is now more modular, let's focus on targeting it for more shells than Cmd. However, let's make it all in one file, and not break it to bash_init.bat, ps_init.bat, etc. It could be elegantly done in one file using recent libs.\nI'll focus on a much cleaner launcher code, like you said it's not a priority but there are lots that can be improved in it.\n@Stanzilla Please keep this issue open for now until both points are addressed in future issues/PRs.. @daxgames :+1: something like init.bat -shell ps or init.bat -shell bash and by default, -shell cmd would be used. @BrianAllred, thanks for pointing this out, can CoreRT meet the following requirements IYO?\n\nsmall footprint & fast to load and execute\neasy syntax to develop (is it the same as C#?)\nhave GUI support as well\nzero to no dependencies for the final user\nsimple compilation toolchain to be integrated into AppVeyor ci\n\nIf so, it could be a nice replacement for the current C++ launcher.\n(Though I still prefer the native Win32 builds with Visual Studio.)\nOn another hand, (and sorry ahead for the long comment) as suggested here, it still needs the visual studio redistribute DLLs. Although I'm sure everyone has them (or could easily install them), someone has created a fork of Cmder embedding them, which is not recommendded.\nIt's still a valid reason to use compiled C++ launcher, because ConEmu (the underlying terminal emulator that Cmder uses) is built also with VS flavor of C++ with Win32 API.\nThe best scenario I think of is to always use rhe same build tools that ConEmu use to avoid multiple DLL required, and move as much as appreciate logic into init.bat, which makes Cmder universal with other underlying emulators.\nThe launcher works as a really nice way to add switches, pinned taskbar tasks and other windows functions that can not or should not be emulated with batch files.. @Stanzilla could you rename the issue title to \"Error on fresh mini install\"?. \nfix in #1730 preview:\n\n. @Stanzilla & @MartiUK \u2013 ready to merge.\n@Jackbennett Can you kindly have a look at my powershell scripts?\n@daxgames \u2013 thoughts on also adding Copyright year from README.me automatically?. @stanzilla thanks! I thought it was a stable and consistent way to do it. Any other constants to use?. @Stanzilla this is perfect! Notably becauss it also includes a build number. @Jackbennett any ideas how to incorporate this instead of regexing the Changelog?. @Jackbennett @Stanzilla It seems that using powershell scripts I can use AppVoyer's environment variables and/or the build worker APIs to get variables like the project name, type of compilation (can be used for copyright year), build number from AppVoyer, tag_name (contains version strings) and even whose commit is being built.\nHowever, we should also consider the fact that the build.ps1 should be able to be built also even without the use of CI tools such as AppVoyer, and thus there needs to be alternate methods of retrieving data on build time.\nOn the other hand, CHANGELOG.md being built automatically with github-changelog-generator is also almost guranteed to have a regular format.\nShould I alter the method to retrieve data from AppVoyer when available and attempt to extract them from CHANGELOG.md when AppVoyer is not available?. @Stanzilla Then you'd have to update them on each build.\nHow about hardcoding them in a .json file (like the one in sources/vedor.json) that you regularly update?\nAnd then only using the build number from the AppVeyor.. @Stanzilla even a better idea! We can use the already existing \"git tag\" defined in here:\nhttps://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/bcf8527f74b9081a26657bace451e89e25b2f3e8/scripts/pack.ps1#L51\nIt would work if it's a AppVeyor environment, or the repo has been cloned.\nOtherwise we could use a hardcoded value!. @Stanzilla please add a commit to the sources/vedor.json, or any .json file and define the following:\n[\n    \"name\": \"Cmder\",\n    \"version\": \"v1.3.6-pre1\",\n]\nI will rewrite my commits to read from that file if AppVeyor or Git is not available.. @Stanzilla It's technically possible to download a .zip file archive of the source and launch the build script from it. Currently, this builds a correct archive.\nIf the repo's not cloned using git clone, even if git is present, the git describe --abbrev=0 --tags won't work.\nSo, my guess is to either block the user from compiling a downloaded .zip file and throwing an error instead, and warn the user not to download a .zip file,\nor we can add a hardcoded .json with the package version.. @Stanzilla the name is already hardcoded:\n```\ndefine CMDER_PRODUCT_NAME_STR      \"Cmder\"\ndefine CMDER_FILE_DESCRIPTION_STR  \"Cmder: Lovely Console Emulator.\"\ndefine CMDER_INTERNAL_NAME_STR     \"Cmder\"\ndefine CMDER_ORIGINAL_FILENAME_STR \"Cmder.exe\"\ndefine CMDER_COMPANY_NAME_STR      \"Samuel Vasko\"\ndefine CMDER_COPYRIGHT_YEAR_STR    \"2016\"\n```\nI can fallback the version string to dev if git is not present, but what about the Win32's file version and product version? Should they be set to 0,0,0,0?\nPreview here: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/1729#issuecomment-376985428. @Stanzilla instead of 0.0.0.0, can I fallback to Changelog.md, considering it's a consistent file, and rare that a .zip file will be used?. @Stanzilla I implemented and tested the new logic. If all is good, you can merge it now.. @Stanzilla what should change in that?. Without --abbrev=0, that gives us: v1.3.6-pre1-40-g94e7, but Win32 doesn't like words like g94e7.\nI think the build number was useful as it's a unique and sequential number.\nAny other method to substitute AppVeyor's build number?. ### It simply only allows integers at the compiled version info:\n\n. @Stanzilla It translates to this: 1.3.6.1.635 which works, I'm not sure I can replace g94e7 to 947, for example. (g94e7 is a git hash.). Alright then. BTW @Jackbennett Do you approve? I also used the git tag as you suggested.\nLooking forward to merge when the commits are approved by all!. @br0wnie Sorry for the late answer.\n\u2022 As you've noticed, the -new_console:d:E:\\ should ONLY be used as a permanent starting directory, though it's appreciated that you read ConEmu documentation.\n\u2022 The line which defines %HOME% environment variable in init.bat does not specify where to launch Cmder, but rather it's Linux/Cygwin's variant of Windows's %USERPROFILE%, so that shouldn't be usually changed. (Though it's thoughtful of you to try it out!)\n\u2022 Now, most Terminals open in the user's home directory by default. That's why Cmder also opens in user profile. If you want to open Cmder in another directory, you have to use the /START argument which Cmder provides (it's documented in README file, if you're interested to read!)\nYou may create a new shortcut (or modify an existing one) to add the /START E:\\ argument.\nCheers!. @daxgames . I'm also interested in the history of Cmder!\nSome notes I'd like to mention: Cmder's very first commit was made on Jul 9, 2013, by @samvasko.\nHe started Cmder as a collection of configurations for ConEmu, and until a few later versions, Cmder did not have its own launcher.\nThe website (cmder.net) hasn't changed much from the creation of the project, as you can see the website's history at web.archive.org.\nAlso, don't be mistaken. ConEmu has much active development, in fact, our maintainers update Cmder's ConEmu to the latest version a couple of times each month:\nhttps://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/commits?author=Stanzilla\nMaximus, the ConEmu author patches bugs and adds new features to ConEmu each day. Cmder is built with the latest version of ConEmu each time it's released, and even new versions of Cmder are released when the underlying ConEmu is updated.\nAlso, there are key differences between Cmder and ConEmu. ConEmu is designed to work just as a terminal emulator, and it isn't expected to perform anything else than emulating the Console API of windows. Cmder, on the other hand, is designed as a powerful, beautiful and unified complete package consisting of Git, Clink and its own profile configuration (color schemes, tasty lambada prompt symbol, etc.) So, Cmder uses ConEmu (or any other Terminal emulators) to form the complete terminal.\nAlthough the original author meant Cmder to be used only with ConEmu, Cmder on VS Code and Cmder on on Hyper are still Cmder, even if those don't use ConEmu. There's even a fork of Cmder called Shark which provides Cmder with both ConEmu and Console2 as an alternative (though in my opinion ConEmu is superior to Console2 and ConsoleZ).\nI'd like to see a Cmder wikipedia page, though!. @DRSDavidSoft This should be added to the Wiki.. @stanzilla Couldn't agree more! Would you like me to separate the README.md into wiki and PR it, or should this be merged and I create a new PR?. @Stanzilla Is it approved?. ### P.S. 1\n@daxgames I can write a lib_arguments.bat to parse the arguments, If it's okay by you. It should parse these types of switches IMO:\n /switch\n --switch\n* -s and/or /s\nP.S. 2\n@xiazeyu On another note, we have a Wiki page explaining on how to integrate Cmder with VS Code, here: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki/Seamless-VS-Code-Integration\nIf you have something useful in your vsCode.bat, we'd appreciate posting it there.\nHere's also the wiki page for Sublime 3 integration: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki/Seamless-Sublime-Text-3-Integration. @daxgames Sure. I propose adding a simple wrapper to be used as argument handler, instead of find /i'ing and comparing the produced error level each time. Something like this:\n``\nREM placeuser-plugins.bat` functions here\n:exampleFunction\n    echo. Something is executed!\n    exit /b\n:anotherFunction\n    echo. Something else is being executed!\n    exit /b\nREM this section should be called from either init.bat or user-profile.bat\ncall :conditionalCall switchname1 exampleFunction\ncall :conditionalCall switchname2 anotherFunction\nREM this section goes into lib_args.bat or lib_base.bat, etc\n:conditionalCall \n    set arg_name=%1\n    set subroutine_name=%2\ncall :matchArgument %arg_name% %CMDER_FLAGS%\nif \"%ERRORLEVEL%\" == \"0\" call :%subroutine_name%\n\nexit /b\n\n```\nOf course, this is just an idea. If this doesn't make any sense, let's ommit it and stick to parsing arguments directly in user-profile.bat\nMy other main point (regarding documentation) is that this functionality (and how to use it with user-profile.bat) should be addressed in README.md.. @xiazeyu Glad to hear that, so I'll wait to see what you'll commit for the mentioned subroutines.\nAlso, could you make the README commit in this same PR?\nIf you need help, you can count on me. I think this functionality will be great in Cmder! :). @daxgames, thoughts?\n@xiazeyu I'm reviewing the PR, if everything's alright I'll ask @Stanzilla to merge it.\nThanks for the contribution, btw!. @xiazeyu Please have a look at my review; once you reply them I can make a PR to your branch to address them.\nSome additional points:\n- If the flags are not passed from the launcher (Cmder.exe), I'll write the required code to make it happen. I think it will be useful to have both launcher and init.bat able to set flags.\n    - Update: as @daxgames suggested, prefixed with /uflags. Possibly done in another PR.\n- A better suggestion for the title: \"Passing custom flags to Cmder and handling them in user-profile.cmd\"\n- Also, I think this feature deserves its own page in the Wiki, instead of a section in the VS Code. (I know you mainly use it in combination with VS Code, but it can also be used in combination with Sublime and other IDEs, Terminals.)\n- I think the more of the docs and help/usage be placed in the Wiki is the better.. @xiazeyu Thanks for the quick replies.\nI'll commit my suggested edits and then make a PR into your branch before this one is merged.\nMight I suggest making this new flag feature work when called from both init.bat and Cmder.exe to make it unified? Personally I only use init.bat, but that's for power users like you and me. The regular users will stick to Cmder.exe and I think adding your feature also to the main launcher will greatly benefit them.\nAlso, @daxgames, your thoughts please.. @daxgames \nRegarding the launcher arguments\nTo be clear, I didn't plan to throwing random arguments from the launcher to init.bat! I was certainly thinking of the prefixing idea, but TBH I was planning on calling it /initflags, but I like your /uflags idea better.\nOn the note that is it necessary or not, I would imagine as the launcher, it should be possible to pass any init.bat arguments using the launcher. The only argument is on how to do it. If you agree on prefixing it, I'd like to ask permission to add it to the launcher.\nRegarding the format\nI had planned on refactoring @xiazeyu's batch file to match the other libs (like you initially did), but considering the format and the nature of the file, I also agree with separating it from the other libs.\nMay I ask why cexec.cmd? What does that stand for?\nEDIT: Conditional Execution, found it.\nRegarding maintainability\nI made a note at the end of https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/1873#issuecomment-421656666\n\n@xiazeyu \nI noticed that @daxgames has already made some of the necessary changes in his PR, here: https://github.com/xiazeyu/cmder/pull/1.\nThere are still a couple of minor issues regarding the formatting that I have in mind; I will commit them and make a separate PR in your branch after you merge @daxgames's PR.. @daxgames I just hope those reservations are resolved by now, as I was also perplexed by the unmerged status of the previous one.. @Abbyjeet Please follow this guide for a new way to have Acrylic effect on Cmder.\nDemo\n. Hi @muyu66, thanks for your suggestion, but I don't think it'll be easy for the website to provide per-location mirrors.\nWhere do you propose the chinese mirror to be located? Are you able to set-up a mechanism to automatically fetch the latest releases from GitHub and provide checksum-perfect binaries?\nMaybe the links to per-country mirrors can be added to the Wiki, if the Cmder team agree.. Hi @AlBannaTechno,\nThis behaviour is related to the Clink binary. Please re-submit your issue here:\nhttps://github.com/mridgers/clink/issues/new\nThank you for understanding.. @furtivesock I think this issue is related to the way that PHP binaries on windows work; they don't usually return colors.\nCan you see if the colors work without integrating Cmder in VS Code?. @tjuyy Please elaborate.. Can you send the config file from here:\n1- Go to the Registry (Win + R \u2192 Enter RegEdit and click OK)\n2- Open the following: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Directory\\Background\\shell\n3- Find Cmder or cmder_shell, right-click \u2192 Export and save the file\n4- Attach the file with your next comment.. Nice work on fixing #1862, and thanks for completing #1695's discussion!. @daxgames @Stanzilla I need your opinion on some topics:\n\n\nI'd like to implement a \"check for updates\" feature.\n\n[ ] Cmder should only check for updates\n[ ] Cmder should be able to automatically update to a new version\n[ ] This feature should not be implemented.\n\n\n\nShould I add a confirmation dialog for:\n\n[ ] Ask the user before running /register and /unregister switches\n[ ] Warn and ask the user to fix %CMDER_ROOT% if it's set to an invalid value\n[ ] Ask the user to check for updates\n\n\n\nIf there is a \"do not as me again\" checkbox,\n\n[ ] It should be saved in a config file (#1695)\n[ ] It should be saved in the registry\n[ ] Other?. Thanks for your input, @daxgames.\nHere's my explanations:\n\n\n\nVariable detection\n\nI'm not sure how %cmder_root% could be wrong since it is based on the exe dir of the launcher exe. Not sure what you mean by discover and configure.\n\nThere could be possible reasons why the content of the variable may not have a correct value:\n- The directory has been moved (e.g. from Downloads to Desktop)\n- The mounting partition could change (e.g. the memory stick could change from E: to G:)\n- A previously defined variable could interfere (e.g. There's a system variable defined, but we need to set a user variable)\nThe plan is to check the content of the variable upon startup, and display the following message when an incorrect value is detected.\n| Variable warning | Variable warning (more details) |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\nBTW, one use of 'Do not ask me again' is here (the checkbox in the bottom.)\n\nCheck for updates\n\nI don't think there needs to be a check for update feature nor an auto update feature. Its a portable app you download, expand and copy it to the dir, it's just not necessary. This is probably the best idea of them all, while I think it's unnecessary and could be confusing since conemu already has this and it is often confused with a cmder updater users may like it.\n\nI understand, however I do still suggest a behaviour that matches the portable downloaded apps aspect. Just running a simple check for updates (and linking users to the update page where they can download themselves.) Simply put, if there is an update on GitHub releases, a simple message could be shown, asking the use if they'd like to open the download page.\n\nAs for the ConEmu feature, I think its Update.CheckOnStartup should be set to disabled in Cmder if it's not already. This will help prevent confusion.\nThe plan is to write a good update routine in the Cmder Launcher itself that takes care of compatibility check, configuration backups, and confirmations / notifications for the user.\n\nCommand-line confirmation\n\nWhy would you add a confirmation dialog for a command line switch the user typed, isn't that confirmation enough.\n\nHmm, you right about the user typed switches already being confirmations. The idea was to use the /register and /unregister in the unofficial setup scripts (i.e. 'Uninstall' would call `Cmder.exe /unregister) which would ask the user if they wanted to remove Cmder.\nI think my thinking was not valid. Those confirmation pages should go in those scripts directly, and calling any switches should perform the action silently.\n\nHow to store settings\n\nBtw what does a 'do not as me again box' do? Is it for the proposed features like check for update?\n\nAny dialog where the user may choose an action 'as always', including check for updates.\nNow, a follow up question: If I implement this, should I define separate flags for each routine (e.g. downloads, checks, etc), or should they all follow a single 'do not ask me again' directive?\n\n\nNo checkboxes, no registry settings, no more config files. [...] If you are storing additional config it should be in a file in %cmder_root%/config\n\nOuch! I mean I still agree that the location of the config should be in %cmder_root%/config, but I'm not sure on how to store the individual settings for the launcher. Do I use launcher.txt? launcher.ini? launcher.xml? (See https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/1695#issue-303264076)\nJust a thought though, if we are already modifying the Registry settings for the context menu, IMHO it means that it's very likely that the user is using Cmder in non-portable mode.\n\nThe 'version-*' file(s)\n\nActually I'd like the version file to be called version and contain the version instead of version-1.3.6.675 so that when someone upgrades they don't end up with multiple version files\n\n\ud83d\udc4d on the idea. I also dislike having multiple version-* files in the root directory after an update.\nHowever, actually the file's name is being read by the user to check for the version of Cmder, not its content in a text reader. I'd vote to use #1729's method instead of opening the file with an editor, which is easier and more consistent.\nI'd suggest either:\n\nGetting rid of the file completely and use Cmd.exe's properties to check for version instead\nWriting a simple routine to remove older version-* files in the root directory\n. @daxgames It's okay, I actually like your counter arguments.\n\n\n\nThe examples talk about the %CMDER_ROOT% variable which I still don't see how it could be wrong\n\nIMO, The one use case (moving it around when the context menu is registered) justifies the reason. \nHowever, if you don't see how it could be wrong, neither the user will. If the variable is really correct, the code will simply ignore and pass the warning; but if the variable is either changed or set incorrectly, a simple warning will pop up asking the user if they want Cmder to fix it. I see no UX harm in that.\n\n\nIt could become VERY annoying though to someone like me that has multiple copies of cmder installed for testing purposes.\n\nSolution: Do not ask me again :) (either ticking the checkbox, or a simple .ini line, whichever is the simplest).\nI have multiple copies of Cmder as well (I think for each branch that I'm working on, I have one)\nSo once (or if) this PR gets merged, the annoyance will be only be setting that 'Do not ask me again' flag once.\n\n\nMaybe I'm old school but xml is probably overkill to store a set of binary flags to save checkbox state. Ini file would probably suffice and I would do a separate flag for each checkbox.\n\nI agree with you, XML is actually overkill just to store some flags. I also prefer a .ini file to store them. (The .ini files also go really well with Win32 c++ programs!)\nThe main concern was scalability, if the launcher was ever to incorporate more features some day, but I'm already thinking against that.\n\n\nI prefer file storage to registry storage because at its core cmder is a portable app. \n\nCouldn't agree more. Portability is the #1 feature of Cmder.\n\nNow about the maintainability discussion\n\nMy biggest concern with your ideas is maintainability. Seems like a lot to add to an otherwise simple launcher. We barely support the launcher today because none of us are really c++ experts. You may know it but what if you get bored with the exciting world of contributing to cmder and decide your done.\nI have said before I am concerned with adding so much functionality to the launcher that it becomes difficult to maintain.\n\nI completely understand your point, I wouldn't want having a lot of unmanageable code added to my repo either. However, I should say that this launcher wouldn't have been possible if @austinwagner didn't made a PR, or if he did and @samvasko didn't approve it. Many contributors to any project come and go, and they build upon the project as they come.\nI don't consider myself a C++ expert. As you said, I just know how to do it. But it's against my nature to toy with something and get bored with it. I might stop contributing one day, but I won't leave a ton of unfinished, unmaintained code in the repo when I do it. Furthermore, that day isn't today. I can assure you I'll have interest in maintaining the features that I introduce for many more days to come.\nThe only issue that remains IMHO, is to decide what features to add, and which ones to drop. I won't introduce any unnecessary changes into the launcher code.\nSo, as long as we sort out the inevitable issues that arise with each new feature, I would ask that to be added to Cmder.. @rasoulian The same feature you are asking is already implemented in Gnu's calc.exe, I use it on a daily basis.\nYou can download it from here:\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/calc/2.11.10.1/calc-2.11.10.1.exe\n(In order to not conflict with Windows' own calc.exe, you may rename it to something like calcgnu.exe and call it from Cmder.)\n\n. @SmGG & @daxgames  \u2013 Sorry for the late response.\nI'd like to clear some up some information on the way both Cmder and VS Code. Hopefully this can also be used a future reference for similar problems.\nTL;DR: make sure you are on the latest version and also whether you get the same error message if you get the same error message when you launch the terminal directly (and not using the debug menu)\n\nI decided to write a complete explanation on how Cmder and VS Code work internally for future references.\nCmder is a software package\nA rather important thing to grasp on is that Cmder is not a stand-alone executable, but a collection of different software items that are packaged together in order to provide a complete terminal.\nFor the sake of simplicity, I break up the contents to the following:\n1. The console (terminal window)\n2. The internal shell\nWhenever Cmder.exe is launched, a new console window is created and loaded with the Cmder shell. \n\nThis is the typical window you see when you double-click on the Cmder.exe binary:\n\nCmder is packaged with ConEmu as the console window, and uses clink with some special configuration as the default shell.  The window you see in the above photo, is actually the packaged ConEmu that emulates the terminal in a window.\nAs @daxgames said, the Cmder.exe binary is just a launcher that opens the ConEmu with the Cmder shell.  (The main core of Cmder is a batch file located at vendor/init.bat which provides the actual shell.)\n\nHow the terminal in VS Code works\nThere are actually two different modes that the VS Code terminal operates in:\n1. integrated: The terminal is rendered inside the VS Code's window \u2013 (a.k.a the \"Seamless mode\" here)\n2. external: VS Code launches an external terminal.\nHow do they differ?\n\nIn the first mode, the Cmder's shell (consisting of clink and all the other goodies) are ran inside a frame in the VS Code window, hence the name \"integrated terminal\". This is referred to as the \"Seamless mode\" in the Cmder wiki and guides. (The default hotkey is Ctrl + ~.)\nAs the opposite, the \"external terminal\" mode will simply launch a new terminal window. (The default hotkey is Ctrl + Shift + C.)\n\nHere's a demo of the first mode:\n\nHere's the relevant configuration for both methods:\n```json\n    \"terminal.integrated.shell.windows\": \"cmd.exe\",\n    \"terminal.integrated.shellArgs.windows\": [\n        \"/k\", \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\init.bat\"\n    ],\n\"terminal.external.windowsExec\": \"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\cmder\\\\Cmder.exe\",\n\n```\nNow I'm not quite sure as to why @SmGG would like to use the external window method instead of the integrated method, but the above configuration should work just fine in this case.\nThere are a couple things I need to mention:\n\n\nMake sure you're using the latest version of Cmder. The code for Cmder.exe launcher is always being updated, and your issue might be fixed if you update. How to see which version you are using?\n\n\nTest running Cmder as the external terminal without using the debug option. (Ctrl + Shift + C) You should not get the following message:\n    > Failed to copy ConEmu.xml file to user-conemu.xml backup location!\n\nIf you are getting this message without using the debug menu, there is something wrong with the launcher code that we need to fix.\nIf this error message only appears with the debug menu, we need to consider adding this as a new functionality.\n\n\n\nAlways use the appropriate configuration for each method:\n\nthe integrated terminal method should only call the init.bat file to adjust the shell.\nthe external terminal should always call a terminal emulator (such as the ConEmu via Cmder.exe) to run.\n\n\n\n@daxgames, the \"terminal.external.windowsExecArgs\" thing that you suggested is not a valid VS Code settings option, and does not have any effect.\n. Not the best solution to the problem. \ud83d\udc4c Thank you for the observation @ericcornelissen, I updated the wiki!\n(The wiki is open to editing for anyone, so you can go ahead and edit it in the future if you see fit!). Either change -v to /v, or make init.bat accept -v and --git-install-root formatted arguments as well as /v and /git_install_root format.\n\n\nPersonally I vote for the latter.. With the removal of this section, invalid formatted return string is not caught.\nValid case: if user has any other executable in path accidentally named git.exe that won't return git version xxxxx on issuing git.exe --version on them.\nIMO, init.bat should also verify if the return string has git version in it.\n\n. Yes, my mistake. Should have used usebackq with that syntax to avoid paths with space in their name. Damn you, MS Windows!. What did you change for this case?. @daxgames Oh sorry, an invalid commit made its way to this branch. I'll make a new PR. @daxgames fixed in #1693. Sorry for sloppy git work. Thanks! What a weird convention.. is vsCode a batch file, or a subroutine? Why is it called here?. That sounded a bit unprofessional! I changed it.. What's this for?. Since the actual flag comparison should be done in /config/user-profile.cmd and not init.bat, I suggest not mentioning init.bat as the arguments handler; instead advertise user-profile.cmd as where the arguments are handled.. I'm not sure how the launcher (Cmder.exe) passes arguments to init.bat. Are you also launching Cmder with custom flags like this: Cmder.exe /noAutorun or just vendor\\init.bat /noAutorun?. Is using init.bat /startNotepad the only method, or does Cmder.exe /startNotepad also work?\nUPDATE: I suggest making Cmder.exe /uflags \"/startNotepad\" also work, possibly in another PR.. Since init.bat should be left unchanged by the users, I doubt they'll edit this file. In any case, we should discourage users from directly editing this file.. I'm curious, why do you call shift in a dedicated subroutine doShift?. ",

In order to see it, you should minimize Cmder's window.\n\n. That seems strange to me. 1.1.3 does have a \"true\" launcher in that it is a real executable launcher (Cmder.exe), and there are no batch files -- except for setting aliases and environment details. Have all the steps I mentioned been tested with the upcoming 1.1.4 version? (Also, when should its binaries be available?)\n.

When I type bash into cmder, it takes me to MINGW64, not to the new Linux subsystem. The bash command works correctly in a normal command prompt, however.\n. Everything works as expected within Cmder. The shell is still a beta and I've run into a couple quirks that I've reported back to Microsoft, but overall it's pretty seamless. As long as the bash command launches you into the subsystem instead of MINGW64, Cmder works great! (Outside of the arrows, which is a known bug.)\n.

Looking at the source of the launcher it looks like it's doing the right thing. Meh, I don't have time to debug this right now...\n. @MartiUK I've not used the taskbar management APIs recently, so my memory is kinda hazy; but in the launcher shouldn't the AppID be retrieved using GetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID instead of the current exe path?\n[edit: MSDN says that this only works if an explicit ID was set beforehand, and that there's no way to retrieve the system-assigned ID. possibly this is not working because my system has assigned some other ID to the launcher?]\n. @MartiUK hope you make progress on this... I'll see if I can somehow debug this too. Thing is, both the released version and the pre-release fix version doesn't work in this manner.\n. @MartiUK I've found the culprit.\nThis problem manifests because we are reverse-engineering Microsoft's AppID generation technique. Pinning EXE's generally result in the path stored as the AppID, but when the program pinned is in the Program Files folder, the KnownFolderID is used instead. Launcher is a 32-bit app, so placing it in Program Files (x86) on a x64 Windows install will use the 32-bit known folder ID.\nI have a patch which substitutes the path with Known Folder IDs. But if Cmder is put in the 64-bit Program Files folder on a x64 Windows install the same problem will manifest. Because to the 32-bit app, the 64-bit Program Files directory isn't special.\nIf I place Cmder in my user profile, with my patch, it'll break once again, because apparently Explorer doesn't substitute my user profile path with the Known Folder ID...\nI'll push a patch which fixes the Program Files problem. We need a better way of fixing this however.\n. @kohenkatz Can you do a taskbar inspection and share with us your findings? This fixes it on both my computers (I use the one with 7+ Taskbar Tweaker)\n. @kohenkatz You've got some custom folder defined as a special Shell path. I'm not sure how or who did that... My first version of the patch will fix it, but not the latest PR. This is because I'm not sure how Explorer decides which paths get shortened to a Known Folder path and which folders do not...\n@jacobch pinning the Launcher is the correct thing to do.\n. @kohenkatz I've tried this with various folders on both my machines, only known folders get assigned GUIDs (and always the same one)... this is indeed strange.\nPrograms outside a known folder get the full path.\n. As I've mentioned however, this breaks placing Cmder in Known Folders (e.g. user profile path) I need to implement a whitelist of sorts... but that feels hacky.\n. Okay, that should only apply the substitution to the Program Files folders. There's no way to get this to work properly if the user places the distribution in the 64-bit Program Files directory on 64-bit Windows, however, because of WoW64 emulation.\n. @jcheng31 this fix might interest you.\n.

The above \"workaround\" works fine as long as I keep cmder in my downloads directory, or on my desktop, or in a folder on my desktop. As soon as a move it to a directory other than my downloads folder or a folder located on my desktop (like my Program Files or Applications directory) then the workaround stops working.

Any help or explanations would be much appreciated.\n. @Stanzilla: Pardon my ignorance, given that this is a ConEmu issue, does that mean that we will have to wait for ConEmu to solve this problem and then update our version of Cmder in order to get the fix?

    "rakete": "I just wanted to mention that it is possible to use cmder with its own clink and still have the functionality where clink injects itself into every cmd as if it was installed globally.\nWhen clink is installed globally it creates two keys in the registry:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Command Processor\\AutoRun\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Command Processor\\AutoRun\nwith a string pointing to the clink.bat file that should be something like:\nC:\\Program Files\\cmder\\vendor\\clink\\clink.bat\nso that every time a cmd is opened, that clink.bat file is executed and injects clink. Now, I assume cmder prefers to run clink itself, and the problems discussed in this issue stem from having the globally installed clink inject itself into cmder before it can inject clink on its own. So, to get clink to inject into every cmd and have cmder still work correctly, all that needs to be done is to exclude cmder when automatically injecting clink.\nTo do that it is possible to check if the CMDER_ROOT variable is defined and then not inject clink if it is. You can probably just edit the clink.bat, but I choose to create my own bat with something like this:\n@echo off\nif not defined CMDER_ROOT (\n    \"c:\\Program Files\\cmder\\vendor\\clink\\clink_x64.exe\" inject --quiet --profile \"c:\\Program Files\\cmder\\vendor\\clink\\profile\"\n)\nand then put that into the AutoRun registry keys. This should give you clink injected into every cmd that is not cmder, like ConEmu or just plain cmd.exe, and still have cmder work correctly with clink.\n. I just had the same problem with 1.2.9 and clink 0.4.7, as okoetter described it, I could not auto-complete filenames and directories after something like 'git add'. This seemed to only affect git, other commands worked fine.\nThen I tested with 1.3.0-pre and with that version auto-completion works correctly.\n. Yes, appending the path would probably solve my problem.\nAlthough personally I would still say that it would be better to try to minimize any kind of modification of the users environment. There will always be the assumption on the users side that whatever is his PATH outside of cmder, will be the PATH inside of cmder.\nThere is also a maximum length of PATH that you might run into with this approach (varies between Windows versions, Windows 10 seems to finally address this problem), see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1880321/why-does-the-260-character-path-length-limit-exist-in-windows\n.

I like having both Cmder as a portable, and if the machine I have is using Babun, then I can use that with Cmder. I like Zsh a lot, which is not an option with cmd or Git Bash\n.

When i go to the task settings, I only see {cmd} and {CygWin bash}, yet this other option shows up. I deleted the <line> element.\n. Powershell is great if you know how to use powershell commands. It's more native to Windows than any of the bash/linux emulators like Cygwin/Babun/git Bash. It uses completely different commands to allow you to interact with windows from command line. If you don't know how to use Powershell (like me), and you aren't going to learn powershell commands, then it's useless for you. Take a look here for a little explanation:\nhttp://www.7tutorials.com/simple-questions-what-powershell-what-can-you-do-it\n. @UberGruber I think I had a similar thing. Have you looked at the 'Task Bar' menu under 'Main' in the settings? You might have the \"show all consoles\" button clicked or something\n. I assume this problem is non-existent on git bash (that does not come with cmder)\n. Hmm I downloaded the newest 1.2 build here: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/tag/v1.2\nAnd still I have this same error. Is that link for 1.2 not the updated build? I'm a bit new to using Github, so forgive me if I'm missing something really stupid.\n. Stanzilla, why not make a pull request on the current master branch to apply this fix? \n. What else needs to be changed here?\n. @Stanzilla I will test it today or tomorrow if it's ready. I think @MartiUK is pretty busy with some personal stuff. I think he wants to keep maintaining this project, but currently is having some trouble.\n. Hmm it looked like this two weeks ago:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150814165535/http://gooseberrycreative.com/cmder/\n. I have this problem when using {cmd}, and I also had this problem before trying out version 1.26 (Stan's)\n. @variab1e Which version? I am using the latest stable version. I am also having this problem when using my git bash task with the 1.4.1.1 build as well.\n. @Maximus5 you are right. So I tried using the most recent alpha version with cmder 1.1.4.1 and 1.26. Right now on 1.1.4.1 Cmder works just fine. However when I open Git Bash (Git 2.5 something) as one of my tasks, I still have the same problem.\nShould I use the latest 'preview' version instead?\n. So are we simply waiting for a Git update to fix this VIM issues, or is there something can be changed in Cmder/Conemu?\n. What version are you using? The pipe seems to work fine for me\nls | grep Desktop will return only the folder named 'Desktop'. So it might be something else, like using xargs\n. Hey Stan what about your development branch: https://github.com/Stanzilla/cmder/tree/development\n? Which one would you like people to test. I've pointed people (on https://gitter.im/bliker/cmder) to your link above.\n. I'm pretty sure I'm using 1.1.x, and CTRL + D actually closes my current window. \n. Vim on your phone? Lol that's hardcore dude\n. I am pretty sure this is expected behavior from Node. I tested this behavior on my remote web server and got the same thing. Not all programs handle ctrl + C the same way.\nSo I would say that this is a non-issue, and can be closed. @Stanzilla @MartiUK \n. I like the idea, but I think we would want to keep it out of Cmder, which\nwe are trying to keep minimal. Wiki says uncompressed size is 65 MB, that\nwould almost double the size of the Cmder download and size on disk.\nOn Thu, Oct 22, 2015, 7:41 AM TheAngryAvocado notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI've successfully made an alias with sublime text 3, following the wiki's\narticle.\nI am a daily user of Python too, and I was wondering, is there a way to\nintegrate portable Python like I did with sublime?

Isn't Cygwin incredibly large? I think the point is to keep this small. one thing I did notice is that the new build uses git 2.5.3, but the newest version is 2.6. We should probably update that before the next release, no? @MartiUK @Stanzilla \n. Having that 5th task available by default is great. I also renamed the 'cmd' task to 'Cmder' myself. I like the idea of having this as default. \n. Very nice.\n\nSo silly question, but how can I test out the dev branch? Normally I download the zipped file, extract - and it's ready. Do I just put all the files in a folder and that's all I need to do?\n. @daxgames\n```\nPS C:\\Users\\gordon\\workspace\\cmder\\scripts> .\\build.ps1 -verbose\nThe term '\\utils.ps1' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.

Cloned, checkout the branch, went into the scripts directory, and tried the command - getting that error. \n. \"This branch is up-to-date with the base branch\" \nWhat is the 'base branch'? Is that development in this case or master? It would be nice if github specified here what branch that is. A bit confused on what this means. Sorry for noob question.\n@MartiUK @daxgames \n. Ok I was looking through the git history and I got my answer. I can see that the development branch was pulled into the msys_bash branch - that's all I wanted to know. I could figure it out from the git log but I couldn't tell just by looking at this page.\n. Ok sweet I got it compile and running, although a few things I've noticed. \nI noticed the vim issues are gone (sweet!)\nThe mintty task has a black background, whereas others are more gray.\n~~My /etc/profile.d/git-prompt.sh no longer is executed - or at least the prompt that I've created in there does not work. I get the standard user@hostname prompt. Even if I try to do:\nsource /etc/profile.d/git-prompt.sh, I don't see a change in my prompt.~~\nNevermind that, I realized that the mintty task uses its own git home directory, therefor pointing to a different git-prompt.sh.\nctrl + v doesn't work for pasting into the mintty task.\nNormally with git bash, you can use ctrl + insert to copy, and shift + insert to paste.\nThe cmder icon is gone from the taskbar and the top of the window too.\nAll I see is the conemu window. But this could have to do with the fact that I already had Cmder installed elsewhere.\n. I'm currently using @daxgames' fork (which has been merged into development already) - and ctrl + shift + v pastes all lines for me. \nshift + insert pastes all lines as separate lines, including the enter command. \nI get this result from the Cmder task. Is this issue in the Powershell task?\n. Is there a way to un-map some of these commands from Mintty? Maybe it wouldn't be part of the Cmder build, but it would be nice to know how to do. I think Win + Alt + P would be a good one to not have go to Mintty. All it does is put ^[p in your terminal.\n. Very nice. i see you put in info about mintty. That is very helpful (or at least it was to me). And the example of adding solarized - awesome. \n. I personally have Babun configured as one of my tasks, and it works fairly well. However I might advise against bundling it with Cmder. Babun is still fairly large. Right now the zipped download is 272MB. That's too much to be adding to Cmder's download. \nAlthough we could consider an alternative download that would include Babun, but I'm not sure that's what we want.\n. That's interesting, because I've never seen this with Powershell. \nHere is how it could work if you used something like Babun or Cygwin:\nhttps://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k\nBut this requires zsh (a different shell)\nI have no idea how this could work with Powershell. I've only gotten something like this to work when running Babun (or on a non-Windows machine).\nI would suggest asking questions like these on the gitter channel. https://gitter.im/cmderdev/cmder.\nThemes like this also require downloading and installing special fonts from here. But a lot of the fonts don't work on Windows. \nFeel free to post on the Gitter channel if you want more info, I've been spending a lot of time trying to get this to work on Windows. \n. Would the Powerline patched fonts work? I use Deja Vu Sans Mono for Powerline to get some of those symbols (the important one is probably the filled triangle) working on Babun (but that uses the Mintty terminal).\n. They said it will be released as part of the summer 2016 build. Is there a way to get a hand on the beta version?\n. I could probably research this myself, but I'm lazy - is the new Bash available in Windows 10 yet? Or just the Insider build?\n. @rmorrin so that's what I was excited about. It doesn't need to use Mintty, so all the ConEmu binding should work. I have been using Mintty, so I don't even remember which bindings don't work when using ConEmu + Mintty. \nI know that ctrl + W to close a tab works now - but that does not work with Mintty (I think. I actually don't have it setup in front of me now).\n. @josephbergevin Can you show us your configuration on how you use zsh in cmder? I'm very curious. I have been able to use oh-my-zsh with Cygwin/babun, but I never got it working in the bash task. \n. @MadLittleMods posted a good link a few comments back. But I do agree with needing a readme or maybe just a new page on the wiki. \nAlthough I do believe there is still an issue with arrow keys when using vim :(\nKind of a deal breaker for me honestly. I guess if you are a vim pro, it wouldn't bother you. But I'm pretty far from not using arrow keys when I'm in insert mode. And unfortunately, Microsoft has put this issue on the backlog for now, so realistically I don't think we'll see a fix for at least 6+ months. What is the purpose of the new line? Why is this necessary?\n. ",

Therefore, Invalid macro definition. error occurs.\n;= is ignored in command script, and a row begin with ;= is interpreted as (pseudo-)comment Doskey macro.\n;= itself is just ignored in command script, and trailing commands are not ignored. Therefore, before goto:eof, command rem is needed for comment row. But after goto:eof, those rows are ignored in the first step (\"read as command script first\"), so there is no rem in ;= Add aliases below here.\nWhy ;= function as (pseudo-)comment?\nThis is alias assignment about ;.\nWhen you type ; in cmder, you'll see 'Add' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\noperable program or batch file. because ; is the alias of Add aliases below here now. For avoiding this, you can add an row with just ;=, no trailing comment.

    "aplocher": "I realize this is an old closed issue, but if you're like me, hitting WINKEY+R -> CMD.EXE ->[ENTER] is like a reflex to you.  There is a registry key that takes precedence over the %PATH% variable for certain things executed through Windows such as through the Run dialog (or any Windows Address bar, i.e., IE and Windows Explorer).  This is why several apps in Windows \"just work\" without needing to be in the %PATH%.\nI've been using this method for years, it's only caused problems once for a small insignificant Visual Studio extension (see below for details).\nWhenever I load up a new Windows box, I always add the following keys (add with Regedit or add this to a .reg file and run):\n```\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\App Paths\\cmd.exe]\n@=\"C:\\TEMP\\CMDER\\CMDER.EXE\"\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\App Paths\\np.exe]\n@=\"C:\\Program Files\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe\"\n```\n\n(note, the \"np\" one is insignificant to this post, but it's just a cool way to alias notepad++ that I thought I would share)\nThat reg key registers a virtual \"cmd.exe\" command that takes precedence over C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe and redirects to cmder.\nThe ONLY time I ever saw it have a problem was when a Visual Studio extension was launching \"cmd.exe\" and tried passing in standard Windows cmd.exe arguments, such as \"/k\" to run a command but leave the window open.  It would be nice if cmder.exe and/or conemu.exe had the same args available (or a small proxy app that mapped them over), because then it would truly be a flawless method (from my experience).\nSo this method should fix anything that uses the Address bar/Run dialog/whatever-internal-windows'y-way-of-resolving-a-command.  As far as the Start Menu icon, you can easily just create your own shortcut and replace the included one.  \n\nThe only other thing would be adding it to the beginning of your %PATH% so any bat files and commands from the console get mapped over, but THAT I haven't tested.  Probably dangerous if a bat file is using cmd.exe with any arguments.. ",

I downloaded the latest version of Cmder from Github and put it in my Dropbox account this time/\nC:\\Users\\Willem.ssh exists and has the correct keys in for the boot2docker vm as when I use the boot2docker start.sh script, I do not have to give any password.\nWhen I use Cmder to ssh to boot2docker\nssh docker@192.168.59.103\nIt keeps asking me for my password hence I still think Cmder / msysgit does not find %HOME%.ssh\nTried adding HOME environment variable to Windows, but it does not seem to help. \n\nAlso tried with HOME=C:\\Users\\Willem\\\nStill does not work.\nAny help to make this work is highly appreciated. I'm not sure how I could find out where things are going wrong.\n. Hey MartiUk,\nThe folder where my ssh keys are located is C:\\Users\\Willem.ssh\n.ssh is a folder, see this screenshot:\n\n. \u03bb ssh -v git@github.com\nOpenSSH_4.6p1, OpenSSL 0.9.8e 23 Feb 2007\ndebug1: Connecting to github.com [192.30.252.129] port 22.\ndebug1: Connection established.\ndebug1: identity file /c/Users/Willem/.ssh/identity type -1\ndebug1: identity file /c/Users/Willem/.ssh/id_rsa type -1\ndebug1: identity file /c/Users/Willem/.ssh/id_dsa type -1\ndebug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version libssh-0.6.0\ndebug1: no match: libssh-0.6.0\ndebug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0\ndebug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_4.6\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT received\ndebug1: kex: server->client aes128-cbc hmac-sha1 none\ndebug1: kex: client->server aes128-cbc hmac-sha1 none\ndebug1: sending SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT\ndebug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY\nThe authenticity of host 'github.com (192.30.252.129)' can't be established.\nRSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes\nWarning: Permanently added 'github.com,192.30.252.129' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.\ndebug1: ssh_rsa_verify: signature correct\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent\ndebug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST sent\ndebug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received\ndebug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey\ndebug1: Next authentication method: publickey\ndebug1: Trying private key: /c/Users/Willem/.ssh/identity\ndebug1: Trying private key: /c/Users/Willem/.ssh/id_rsa\ndebug1: Trying private key: /c/Users/Willem/.ssh/id_dsa\ndebug1: No more authentication methods to try.\nPermission denied (publickey).                                                               \nI hope this helps to identify the issue? When I connect to my boot2docker vm, it still asks for the password. ssh keys are in C:\\Users\\Willem.ssh\n. MartiUK, I got it working! It was some time ago I did this, so I though I'd generate new keys and try again. After doing the following when in the user folder:\nssh-keygen -t rsa\nssh-copy-id docker@192.168.59.103\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh docker@192.168.59.103 \"mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\nI can connect from Cmder to Boot3Docker without password. Thanks for the help and the patience!\n. Thanks Marti! And good job on the Cmder. I'm using it alot. THe only other issue I still have is this https://github.com/bliker/cmder/issues/379 \nAny ideas? :)\n. When I just put\nssh user@112.71.234.84\nit works, so it must be something in the ini.bat making it crash.. Anyway it's working now. Gonna close this up.\n. ",

Since this can be removed, maybe cmder could add these removes for msysgit tools in profile.ps1 file?That should work, right?

Yes, this is probably a good idea. \nIt will solve the \"wtf\" issues with \"ls in powershell isn't ls.exe\" etc., which people who just download cmder and don't know anything about PowerShell will stumble upon.\n. This happens also when I sometimes launch vim (bundled with Git for WIndows 2.5), do some git rebasing (that one uses vim), etc.\nNot all the time tho, just most of the time. If this could get somehow isolated and fixed, it would be great!\n. PowerShell wise, this is relevant to \"separate user startup file\" - https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/633\n. It's not an ENV variable - it's a standard PS variable. :)\nPS profile is a file that is automatically launched when you launch \"classic\" PowerShell. However, when using PS from cmder, the PS profile is skipped (and the profile.ps1 is used instead); that PR checks if user has his $PROFILE set, and if he does, it is launched after cmder's profile loads).\n. Another of the weird behavior (in PowerShell cmder) is after vim exits, it screws up the display of older entries and puts the input for new command at the top of terminal instead after last command (happens in like 80% of case).\n. http://www.howtogeek.com/50236/customizing-your-powershell-profile/\nhttp://www.computerperformance.co.uk/powershell/powershell_profile_ps1.htm\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.10.windowspowershell.aspx\nDefinitely looks like it.\n. @MartiUK Hmm, so should I open different PR with another branch?\n@Jackbennett So, what exactly should be changed? I'm sorry but my understanding of PS is kinda limited (I use it for basic scripting, mostly). If you either could explain what should be done differently (or prepare a more correct PR), it would be wonderful. :)\n. Ok, I just checked that and it does happen as well with cmd in cmder. Pure \"cmd.exe\" doesn't have this issue.\nAlso, I updated Git for Wndows to latest version (2.6.1), but it includes the same vim version and the error is still there.\n. Another update: I tried disabling the \"Quake style\" console, and the issue persists even with the \"classic\" look.\n. Is it really the same as #628? Sure, it is about vim, but that one is about weird colors, not about weird behavior after exiting?\n. Why not use the user profile though? Maybe @Jackbennett could say which option would be better?\n. Yeah, true, you just can launch the $profile from this user startup file. Don't know why this didn't occur to me. :)\n. ",

I opened Cmder and a standard windows Command Prompt and navigated to the same directory, results as follows:\nWindows Cmd: ~1 second delay before git status output appears, prompt reappears immediately\nCmder: ~1 second delay before git status output appears, plus a roughly 1 second delay before prompt reappears\nThis is consistent with the ls output, where windows cmd is instant, and with Cmder the output is instant but there is a ~1 second delay before the prompt reappears. It seems like Cmder is running the given command as expected, but then doing something else that is causing a delay. Is there some sort of update function called when in a git repo? That would make sense given that even a non-git command such as ls results in a delay coming from git.exe.\n. Thanks Jack, that is indeed the issue - applying the 3 settings mentioned in that SO question improved it quite a bit (I'd estimate the delay is down to 300-400ms from 1-1.5 seconds). I might look into removing the \"git status\" part of the prompt, as it is much more usable now, 300-400ms is still a bit much. Do you know if a setting exists for that?

If you wanted to remove duplicates, here's an example of a way to do that from the remote machine:\nsort -u ~/.ssh/authorized_keys -o ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\nYou could also add this to the ssh-copy-id alias.

(2, 3 & 4)\nAlso, what should I do now? How do you use vim?. @daxgames Thanks. So I just need to change cmder's colorscheme using the menu configs then in this way, vim would accept that setting?\n2- About .vimrc, when I enter :scriptnames in vim, it is showing me that it is loading something from this /etc/vimrc which I gather is the .vimrc file. No .vimrc file resides in my $home directory. Are you sure about this? Can you check which scripts are loaded at vim startup by :scriptnames command?\n3- People say it should print .vimrc directory\n4- Again, some say that in order for vim to have the ability to change colors, $TERM should be xterm to support multiple colors but it is set to cygwin now\n. @SuperSandro2000 How can I do that? There is a mintty shell but it's lacking bash aesthetics and it does not recognize pacman. @S-NA Based on your guides, I just selected \"Add/Refresh Default Tasks\" and somehow cmder detected many shells on my system (MSYS2-64, putty, ...). Now I just use ctrl+T and msys2 and I can use PACMAN there.\nSo I assume using this solution, packages are saved to the default MSYS2 dir.\nBut your solution seems better since it is portable AND used pacman as package manager.

Chec k the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\nAt line:1 char:1\n- e.\n- ~~\n  - CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (e.:String) [], CommandNotFoundException\n  - FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException\n. Well then...those are unfortunate news. The ability to add custom aliases (like that) seemed really sweet.\nWill try with PowerShell aliases and with this to make them permanent.\n. ",

    "darsain": "Since 1.2 cmder uses {PowerShell} instead of {cmd}. {PowerShell} uses vendor/profile.ps1 to set up the environment, and there is nothing that would load or manage config/aliases in any way.\nThe 1.2 update effectively removed support for aliases. Instead we have {PowerShell} build in aliases, which are way less powerful and not persistent (any alias set via Set-Alias command gets deleted when you close the session).\n. Yeah, I'm loading my own ps1 script with aliases myself. It's just not very user friendly, and those aliases are really dumb. AFAIK  there is no way how to make aliases that use parameters, or equivalent of $*.\n. I solved this by switching cmder back to {cmd}. Using powershell was unbelievable pain due to tons of other issues anyway.\n. Oh, saw that issue, but thought this was something else, as it doesn't perma-recall parts of history states, just corrupts the lambda. Anyway, thx for the info :)\n. Jesus, yeah! I also had .inputrc with meta settings in it, and after commenting them out the issue disappeared. Thx a lot! :) The specific settings in my case were:\n```\nAllow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like $'\\0123\\0456'\nset input-meta on\nset output-meta on\nset convert-meta off\n```\nI'm sure I copied that whole .inputrc file from someone elses dotfiles repo, but it wasn't causing issues until now. Is this something Clink people should fix?\n. Have a similar issue when trying to open Cmder in a specific directory, where passing any parameter to Cmder.exe has no effect when {cmd::Cmder as Admin} is set as a default task. It works fine for non-admin {cmd::Cmder} though.\nAny possible fix for this?\n. I'm gonna clarify further. I'm running Cmder 1.3.0.\nThere are 2 tasks.\n{cmd::Cmder}:\ncmd /k \"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\init.bat\"  -new_console:d:%USERPROFILE%\n{cmd::Cmder as Admin}:\n*cmd /k \"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\init.bat\"  -new_console:d:%USERPROFILE%\nThe tasks are identical, both including the init.bat script as you can see above.\nStarting in specified directory (passed to the Cmder.exe as 1st parameter) works for normal task, but  doesn't for Admin.\nI want to use Admin task as default, but can't because using Cmder without the configurable starting directory is too painful.\n.

Well, they say it's an RC4, they should be close to release a production ready version.\nHowever, since I've installed that version, all my utilities are coming from Cygwin because I only added git.exe to the Windows PATH and not everything else (personal choice). My Cmder task is using their custom init.bat which is looking for utilities under Program Files\\Git\\bin but on this version they are stored at Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin, and since Cygwin is on Windows path, it falls back to those.\nBut I tested ssh.exe from this Git version and it worked in the same way as ssh.exe from Cygwin, the borders on alsamixer are now properly rendered. grep also has support for color, which it didn't on the previous version.\nFor now, this works for me.

Crazy but fact, start time plummeted down to 1-2 seconds per console start (and profile.ps1 boot time for Powershell is 0.2 secs with posh-git disabled)\n. @arieljannai oh, I didn't realize I referenced to the question, not to the answer. \n\"Run NGEN on Posh binaries.\" is useful, I have it in my profile script for admin prompt.\nI also double-checked and re-enabled scheduler for NGENing my assemblies.\n. Cool, I like your way more than my proposed hack. I haven't put much thinking into side effects and robustness, just sought some ways to preserve my prompt customization outside of profile.ps1. Happy to pass this feature initiative to you.\nSide note - I played a bit with simple Stopwatch timing inside profile.ps1 and found that it's pretty slow, on my laptop it runs for almost 2 seconds - very noticeable for a fast and lightweight console. Removing some backward-compatibility bits and modules I shaved off more than a second from a console start time. It might be worth to do some testing and restructure it a bit - so an interested user can enable\\disable certain features (e.g. posh-git is the beast) from his own profile and improve PowerShell start experience.\nI wish someone who knows how these things are tied together would do the same for pre-posh scripts - because even with very lightweight configuration new console doesn't start immediately, start delay is very noticeable, and it's a painful experience on Windows.\n. @Jackbennett  disabling posh-git itself is a good step towards speeding up as it's slows down the profile boot time. I'd rather have some explicit way to load it (I have it anyway Import-Module posh-git) into a given console than to load it everywhere... Let's see how this PR goes through and then see how we can optimise other steps. \nHaving 3-10 seconds startup time for a new console is not a great experience. It might be a powershell fault by itself, but it's extremely sad\n. Check file vendor/profile.ps1 if you're using powershell as your main console.\nThe function of interest is around line 63 (Cmder mini)  - function checkGit($Path)\nand then it's invoked in line 113 in CmderPrompt script block like checkGit($pwd.ProviderPath)\nYou can override script blocks in your user profile file, which gets included into main profile so you will preserve your customizations between upgrades.\nOr for Cmd promp you need to look into clink.lua, but it's up to you to figure out how to fix it in lua, I don't use classic cmd prompt\n.

    "CollinChaffin": "@Stanzilla This is absurd that this issue after years is not only closed, but apparently was simply ignored.  It's backwards as stated above.  CMDer should ALWAYS be dealing with the USER'S CONFIG DIR copy of conemu.xml.  That is simple best practice and why there is a CONFIG folder to begin with.  If you want to copy it all over the planet, that's fine (but also makes zero sense because if the initial config is changed to CONFIG folder no copy ever has to happen) but on all my machines with the latest version YEARS after this issue was opened, closed, re-opened, etc., my conemu.xml in my USER folder is there, yes.  However, it is old and vanilla, unchanged with any of my changes, and conemu is configured (as it apparently has been for years) to still look in cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu.xml.\nSo, when I go to edit what I THINK should be my config (in the config folder) with an editor....not only does it not impact ANYTHING, but now it's DATA LOSS on upgrade - my customized one that gets changed with GUI config is wrongfully sitting in the vendor folder, BY ITSELF, just waiting TO BE LOST on next upgrade.  I know, because for me, this has now happened.  For me, no \"copy\" ever takes place.  I have only ONE xml file that is not default and it is in the vendor folder.  So, is this a side-effect of being a long-time user and being bitten by one of the above bugs, continued to upgrade, and just never had that magic \"copy back\" begin?\nWhen I open the GUI, IMO I should see my USER folder path xml in the \"Storage:\" bar and it's that's all everyone above has been asking for now for years.  If I change it myself now, how is that impacted by all this copying back and forth I've read occurs (sometimes) above?. @daxgames Hey Dax so sorry I didn't get back to this quicker I have confirmed everything seems good now however the one last piece I never did much with that I am trying to possibly work into my workflow with different machines is the use of the config\\conemu_%COMPUTERNAME%.xml vs the default user xml.  I'm sure it's just me missing it but where can I find more info and details specific to ensuring the %COMPUTER% version of Conemu's xml is always used specific to CMDer usage?  Thanks!\nEDIT:  I did catch up on PR#1109 for the basic info but if there is any additional info/docs you know of specific to it otherwise I'll just assume nothing much has changed since that PR merge.\nEDIT2: Also, as relates to the new PR#1109 behavior of %COMPUTERNAME%, I see cases where history file seems to be getting duplicated with \"-%COMPUTERNAME%.history\" vs \".history\"....is the history per machine log now handled correctly and what is that order of preference is is similar to the xml?\nEDIT3: Ok so I've gone through much of the CPP code and confirmed the xml behavior but still have not been able to confirm where in the code the history is handled and what that logic looks like for multi-user.. Thanks but I was specifically referring to the Conemu cmdhistory:\nhttps://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/master/src/ConEmu/CmdHistory.cpp\nIn addition to yes the clink history LOL I'm trying to determine how folks are really running CMDer in a shared multi-system environment and not clobbering their console history in addition to the config XML, which I did find/confirm in the CPP as to the order of preference when loading.\nWhen I've shared, I not only have found a \".history\" in the CMDer/conemu folder with my conemu history, but also a \"-SYSTEM.history\" and I'm trying to determine exactly which piece might be responsible it was not in the clink.lua but I have not yet checked the actual clink code.  Thanks!\nEDIT:  Note the TWO history files I have are in the CMDer\\Config folder which is why I asked if you happened to know.  From CONFIG\\Readme.md:\n.history: the current commandline history; autoupdated on close.\nEDIT2: If you can just help shorten my code search to tell me how your app moves .history into the CMDer\\config folder (I assume CMDer does, cannot think of any other app that knows about that folder unless buried in a LUA I missed).  Clink does denote two flavors of history depending on the console type flag shown here:\nhttps://github.com/mridgers/clink/blob/0e9734982dc5869d14c7b8f176cf966951674e39/readline/readline/histfile.c#L142\nSo I wonder if through backup a duplicated got flagged and renamed to -.history.....but for sake of multi-system sharing the cmd history really should be per system just like the config XML to avoid it being continually clobbered and/or appended to by multiple systems with shared folder access that renders the command history file junk as it's a mish-mosh of several systems history inter-mixed.. Okay so I think I've traced it all which does start obviously in CmderLauncher.cpp when initially it is determined whether operator is running under a \"CMDER_USER_CONFIG\" or not....from there it's all buried in those environment variables and the various init.bat/clink.lua/etc. and then yes, Clink does it's thing with it's hard-coded normal behavior once that location is passed in which is how it winds up there and also why it's getting clobbered and appended to with multi-use.  It almost seems like (unless I'm missing something) that there are actually more protections that would apply to a PER MACHINE shared usage when forcing CMDer/Conemu to use the \"CMDER_USER_CONFIG\" vs the machine-specific fallback config scenario where Conemu-%computername%.xml are used and one would think would be best suited for it.  However, IMO other than the XML config file, not much else sits in that config scenario as far as code to separate things like history, whereas forcing a \"user\" PER MACHINE run instead, has some additional unintentional safeguards in place due to the entire \"user\" profile path being passed to Clink and conemu via CMDER_USER_CONFIG, which then allows those 3rd party apps to keep the separate history.\nOr, is there a better way currently using the much more intuitive Conemu-%COMPUTERNAME%.xml` \"profile\" to ensure more than just that one XML remains unique per machine run?. Hey @daxgames sorry our last messages crossed I didn't even see yours until now.  I've been monitoring these last few commits to ignore the config folder and really appreciate you looking at this.  I wonder if it's really not as under-utilized a thing as you think, and maybe just not really under-reported/discussed.  The reason I say that is that remember, there really is no immediate \"issue\" here - no error, nothing truly broken from operations perspective.  The reason I was asking/reporting is that despite me having run CMDer in a shared cloud-sync folder between many different machines for quite some time now, I never had an issue - UNTIL recently when I desperately needed one specific set of command history from one specific session and in addition to finding the multiple named XML's and thinking cloud was just being annoying and duping them with \"-%computername%\" inserted (since it can do this), I also only then stumbled upon this history issue which is really just me trying to be proactive when I found all my sessions (at least clink) except one for some reason blended together which is obviously NOT a desired situation.\nAnd thanks I actually have gotten away with not having to run with any special switches but will look now more at the \"-c\" which I think I have seen and perhaps should have been using all along to ensure history desperation.  From reading the conemu and clink code (interesting) I certainly think regarding clink there is and will never be anything in place to prevent collision issues unless the user specifically takes action to ensure each clink session is in a separate profile space (which perhaps your \"-c\" can help address).\nIs the \"-c\" a switch you typically use?  I will tell you if you don't you should give it a shot this way since it allows having only a single fully portable copy of CMDer/conemu to configure/maintain all the tasks and code tweaks, patch/update, and backup not only to multiple local but the cloud giving separate full versioning history of each script/lua/xml.  On one hand right now without the \"-c\" is a double-edge sword because on the other hand right now, a cool side-effect is I can literally launch CMDer an hour later on a totally different machine, and hit up-arrow and run the same command I just ran on the first PC which I have gotten used enjoy so I'll have to test the \"-c\" but once I have the config/tasks in the XML updated on one, I still do like the idea of still having the ability to have unique XML config per machine, if necessary, so thanks! . Well I don't know because I am totally up to date on both CMDer and conemu (even running Alpha) with tcc v20 but clearly the issue is with the init.bat and one of the many called paths.  I actually think your prior edits were more accurate/helpful since I'm getting almost verbatim the same errors you were getting on your original post.. Okay so I have confirmed my initial thought above was actually correct and is the root cause.\nThis new code block is causing duplicated prompts:\nfor _,lua_module in ipairs(clink.find_files(cmder_config_dir..'*.lua')) do\n    -- Skip files that starts with _. This could be useful if some files should be ignored\n    if not string.match(lua_module, '^_.*') then\n        local filename = cmder_config_dir..lua_module\n        -- use dofile instead of require because require caches loaded modules\n        -- so config reloading using Alt-Q won't reload updated modules.\n        dofile(filename)\n    end\nend\nSimply block-commenting this out (for now) resolves all issues.  Since this block was just added and never present before, I would ask for clarification as to the reasoning for adding it now and I would be happy to help to come up with a solution for whatever that new need is, but it is clear as-is that it is adding duplicating read behavior that should probably be avoided in any case.. No, I have not the block above was added in the last couple commits here and is the cause of the issues.  I never edit any lua files outside of the CONFIG folder.  Upon upgrading to the last 2 commits (# above), those 2 new blocks appeared in the CLINK.LUA provided HERE in cmder.z.  I'll post in a min to show you exactly which commit they first appeared in - but they are the cause - not any edit I've made.  Unzipped new cmder.z from here - and broken until I spent hours to figure out why.. I'm confused the root cause is right there like I said when clink.lua was changed on commit even titled \"run user lua afer cmder lua\" e69e7f9b82a5bd002412a5f684d5a52c1997457b.\nPrior to that, the offending code that is causing duplicate loads is NOT there - I just re-confirmed.  Obviously, before that commit, user LUAs were ALREADY being loaded correctly from CONFIG folder - I know because we all place our LUAs there to load for years.  The issue here is that in adding this offending code commit, you did not remove the prior LUA load code (wherever the heck it is these batch/lua files are driving me nuts) and now you've added a SECOND call to loop through them and load user LUAs.  What I'm loading is irrelevant - the code is calling LUA loads twice and since you just said those blocks could be removed, it sounds like maybe you don't know why you added them in that commit?\nThe exact diff is right here showing it was added on Sept 1st:\n\nAnd if you pull repo on commit 08550751dadcc1a10b85447e4c1b04b55027c191 prior to it and unzip clink.lua, the offending blocks are not present.\n. Now I can help you easily figure out the best path because I'm guessing you were trying on Sept 1st in those code blocks to better ensure that USER luas were being properly loaded with some exceptions.  So, if I pull the repo in July prior to that commit, unzip ONLY that clink.lua and replace the broken one from the Sept 1st commit, the million dollar question is that will greatly help me from having to sit and step through LUA and batch files all day is - all my LUA files in the CONFIG folder are still ALL being loaded properly (and always were) - so in which file does the code reside that is loading CONFIG directory LUA files - since those 2 offending code blocks that also do LUA loading are now not present at all?\nEDIT:  Forgot to answer not that it matters since this affects much more than just that prompt, but yes, that is cmder-powerline-prompt.. I'm so sorry I missed this one I just pulled down the latest from appveyor to re-test and will update shortly!\nEDIT:  I'm late to the game but your #1884 fix I can confirm looks like it did resolve the issue.  Thanks so much for getting to it so quickly and I'm sorry if I came across argumentative sometimes I feel I'm not doing the best job of explaining so I tend to then throw too much info in. :). Awesome direction Dax!  I am anxious to test but I want to verify I'm testing it correctly for the scenarios you envision and not just my workflow.  In the scenario of multiple machines for instance all having shared access to a mapped D:\\Programs\\cmder as the cmder root which has the default cmder distribution structure including cmder\\config folder, would you envision each machine still running using this new switch as cmder.exe /s \"D:\\Programs\\CMDer\" where \"D:\\Programs\\CMDer\\config\\Conemu-%computername%.xml\" exists for each machine involved, or does this new switch require moving to a totally separate config folder setup like cmder.exe /s \"D:\\Programs\\CMDer_Configs\" where this path contains no binaries and strictly config data?\nSorry but as I previously indicated I currently run shared without any use of the /c switch with sheer luck and have just lived with the nuances so want to be sure I'm first of all using that switch properly as intended.. Ok excellent thanks for explanation testing now but one more question that I think I know the (probably unhappy) answer but I'll verify anyway.  So, in the above scenario did you consider what happens in the case where TESTUSER is the SAME non-domain (local wkstn) account being used on all three machines as an example using this switch?  You said it will auto-create the user folder, I assume it's based on userid?   On a shared mapped drive it still collides.  I have a really cool approach for you to consider as a solution.\nThe whole fallback to \"-machine.xml\" is clear was a different approach to avoid collision in multi-use but it is also not unreasonable to say if you are running a switch asking for a profile specific to a user or computer already, that you should be expected to know which you want hence the switch you used should only support one or the other.  So, /c OR /m they cannot be used together, usage is invisible to Conemu since you're calling it not other way around, and all prior usages are still supported with zero changes:\n````\n/c (or perhaps should this be /u for \"user\"?):\n%cmder_root%\\PROFILES\\%computername%-%userid%\\config\\user_conemu.xml\n/m (machine) (or perhaps should this be /c for computer?):\n%cmder_root%\\PROFILES\\%computername%-%userid%\\config\\conemu-%computername%.xml\n````\nThe above naming convensions for actual XML config files remains unchanged, only path is being added for profiles.\nThis common \"profile\" \"pick one or the other\" approach would in essence ensure that underlying Conemu remains totally ignorant to any of this, as you then in your code are simply passing the end path to Conemu's launch params and ensure that you could literally now log on to three different machines, all as local machine user TESTUSER, with CMDer installed on a mapped NAS drive U:, and it looks like this:\n````\nMachine #1:      TESTPC1\nUser #1:         TESTUSER\nCommandline:     U:\\programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe /c U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\nCMDer config:    U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC1-TESTUSER\\config\\user_conemu.xml\nConemu History:  U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC1-TESTUSER\\config.history\nMachine #2:      TESTPC2\nUser #2:         TESTUSER\nCommandline:     U:\\programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe /m U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\nCMDer config:    U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC2-TESTUSER\\config\\conemu-TESTPC2.xml\nConemu History:  U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC2-TESTUSER\\config.history\nMachine #1:      TESTPC3\nUser #1:         TESTUSER\nCommandline:     U:\\programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe\nCMDer config:    U:\\programs\\cmder\\config\\user_conemu.xml (conemu-TESTPC3.xml as fallback)\nConemu History:  U:\\programs\\cmder\\config.history\nBONUS SCENARIO:\n[Later logon to Machine #1 using same Windows profile, same USERID, but now with a different CMDer icon with /m vs /c, does this support it?]\nMachine #1:      TESTPC1\nUser #1:         TESTUSER\nCommandline:     U:\\programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe /m U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES    <--(NOTE THE SWITCH CHANGE TO /m)\nCMDer config:    U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC1-TESTUSER\\config\\conemu-TESTPC1.xml <--(Now using machine config)\nConemu History:  U:\\programs\\cmder\\PROFILES\\TESTPC1-TESTUSER\\config.history  <--(**But, still using MY history!)\n[Yes, as you can see it is simply run with a different USER-based config (desired result), and the same userid that ran earlier on this machine using MACHINE-specific /m hits UP-ARROW after using a totally different USER config, but still has his/her .history file THAT SHOULD ALWAYS be tied to what that USER is doing ON THAT MACHINE but considered different when moving machines (with new profile use)]\n````\nThis way, straight, simple, never any need to even code additional new fallbacks to %computername% config from user_conemu.xml because the user must decide when using either /c or /m if they want the config to be user or computer specific and it is much cleaner they no longer collide, and Conemu now can store all data history/etc. per user but can still easily fallback to prior behavior, if desired.  The big missing piece here causing collisions has always been the FOLDER used for all the different components, and this is a great chance to implement a true front-end of overall \"PROFILES\" that is missing today in Conemu/Clink but that will support a true shared NAS or similar single instance CMDer/Conemu install, while at the same time greatly enhancing the usability.\nThoughts?. Hey @daxgames so sorry I didn't reply sooner.  I totally misunderstood and do want to reconfirm (and in process of testing myself too) that your new /c behaves the way your latest example (using my sample scenarios) shows.  Namely, when you posted that first response above I think I just might have mis-read that it created d:\\programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe /c d:\\programs\\cmder\\config_user\\%username% and I read that IT was creating the actual username (and not via env variable) and you were simply indicating that with %username% (it was late, DOH!).\nSo, I think we were actually thinking pretty identically on this and perhaps you misread my scenario as I think it not only is exactly what the new /c does, but what the prior PR/users use cases with the cloud were which if I had to put it on a poster as a pretty huge selling point of CMDer over straight Conemu would be simply stated as:  \n\"Allows a user to maintain a single, portable installation of CMDer with Conemu that can then be placed into any flavor cloud sync folder of their choosing and configure command-lines on multiple machines to execute the exact same configuration, while still maintaining the minimal required unique data files such as system-specific initialization and command history to support the most common usage scenarios.\"\nAnd, since it appears that the new /c will allow the user to create the initial parent cmder root via environment variables before appending the config directory (my bad) I think it hits the nail on the head.  Lets leave this open just for a bit to do some final testing see if any tweaks are needed if that's okay?  Nice work!. Okay @daxgames so I've run this through it's paces pretty good now on a number of scenarios, ultimately with great success!  There is only one thing that if not now hopefully you can see the value in (although always easier said than done with coding it) which is the initial profile creation.  I think you agree since you've nicely added some decent initialization already that now this introduces a whole new level of not only scalability, but support/maintenance overhead.  Namely, this same abbreviated scenario we already discussed:\nTesting\nShortcut command-line:\nZ:\\Programs\\cmder\\cmder.exe /c Z:\\Programs\\cmder\\profiles\\%computername%-%username%\nProfile does not exist, post 1st run folder structure and config files looks like:\nZ:\\Programs\\cmder\\profiles\\COMPUTER1-TESTUSER\\\nZ:\\Programs\\cmder\\profiles\\COMPUTER1-TESTUSER\\bin (*EMPTY)\nZ:\\Programs\\cmder\\profiles\\COMPUTER1-TESTUSER\\config\nZ:\\Programs\\cmder\\profiles\\COMPUTER1-TESTUSER\\config\\profile.d (*EMPTY)\nZ:\\Programs\\cmder\\profiles\\COMPUTER1-TESTUSER\\config\\settings\nZ:\\Programs\\cmder\\profiles\\COMPUTER1-TESTUSER\\config\\.history\nZ:\\Programs\\cmder\\profiles\\COMPUTER1-TESTUSER\\config\\user_aliases.cmd\nZ:\\Programs\\cmder\\profiles\\COMPUTER1-TESTUSER\\config\\user_profile.cmd\nZ:\\Programs\\cmder\\profiles\\COMPUTER1-TESTUSER\\config\\user-ConEmu.xml\n\nObservations / Issues / Questions\n\n\nClink settings file created in new profile is being inherited from which default?  My pre-configured settings file in shared config is very different than the vanilla one being created for each new profile (detailed more below).\n\n\nMany other config files already present/configured in shared config (PoSH profile, etc.) seemingly ignored (and in essence abandoned from perspective of novice user) when new /c is used (detailed more below).\n\n\nNote the *EMPTY profile.d folder post 1st run.  However, the usual one and only prior shared config directory @ Z:\\Programs\\cmder\\config\\profile.d contains:\n\"downloadmp3.alias.ps1\"\n\"explorerHere.alias.ps1\"\n\"Get-ChildItem-Color.ps1\"\n\"gitStatus.alias.ps1\"\n\"goToFolder.alias.ps1\"\n\"goToFolder.config.example\"\n\"listNpmGlobalModules.alias.ps1\"\n\"ls.alias.ps1\"\n\"upOneLevel.alias.ps1\"\n\"word2md.alias.ps1\"\n\"alias.ps1.example\"\n\"chocolist.alias.ps1\"\n\"chocoUpgrade.alias.ps1\"\n\"downloadflac.alias.ps1\"\nSo, this might be intended but for strictly 1st run initialization of these new profiles I want you to consider setting the behavior to automatically copy the legacy shared config files, obviously only if the target profile does not already exist.  This also ensures that as a shared installtion scales, the adminsitrator has a supported (and friendly) method of simply staging the entire legacy %cmderroot%\\config one time - be it for a shared UNC install of 5000 users or a home user who wants to set up CMDer one time in a cloud sync folder and either way once the single config folder (which BTW the beauty is that it is still fully usable for initial setup and testing) and know that ANY newly created profiles with /c will now inherit.  Again - not my scenario think any network admin wanting to deploy CMDer in a corp env on UNC distribution points and/or DFS as it is it appears to me that as it is right now, you would need to pre-stage and pre-create every single profile folder yourself and then copy those config files which would be quite inefficient if CMDer could simply inherit upon 1st launch.\n\n\nAlso, as a secondary, I have not gone through all of the new code so I'll just ask to verify that all those profile.d files (and ANYTHING else in the PROFILE\\config*) under the /c use ONLY that new location's copy of XYZ and will NOT utilize the old legacy shared root for anything in that config or bin path(s), correct?\nAnd lastly, does this open up any caveats where even paths relative to %cmderroot% are being written into any config files that either 1. now break functions in general if running from this new profile location, and 2. prevent other means (scripting, etc.) of maintaining profile config files based off a single master copy?  Just a thought I believe the answer is no and I know you already thought about it once, but now that it's moving forward wanted to bounce it off of you before large implementations begin cropping up. :)\n\nOtherwise, overall this looks awesome!  Some of this could just be a matter of having to have solid documentation so any legacy users moving to profiles knows exactly what does NOT come over by default, and exactly what they are responsible for moving where (assuming you don't whip up the magic code to do it for them) :). One of the nicest things was to see the separate history (clink) working properly for the first time ever!  That itself will excite many.  Again, nice work!  Let me know what you think about the above and I'll be happy to continue any further testing!\nLOL and per your comment it is admittedly nice to interact with someone that is as detailed in their explanations as I am because I don't know about you but for me there is nothing worse than taking a bunch of time to write-up a ton of detail, even if in the form of a question, to then have the responder with whom you are interacting reply with all of a few words!\n. Ahh got it!  I did not realize that both the shared and user profiles were both executing.  I am testing more now but things are looking great we will just have to script some initial user profile setup but since the shared still does execute, it may not wind up being as necessary.. Sorry one quick question the only thing still not clear to me is that despite this message that mirrors what you said above:\nGenerating clink initial settings in \"Z:\\Programs\\cmder\\profiles\\TESTUSER\\config\\settings\"\nAdditional *.lua files in \"Z:\\Programs\\cmder\\profiles\\TESTUSER\\config\" are loaded on startup.\\\nCreating initial user_aliases store in \"Z:\\Programs\\cmder\\profiles\\TESTUSER\\config\\user_aliases.cmd\"...\n        1 file(s) copied.\nCreating user startup file: \"Z:\\Programs\\cmder\\profiles\\TESTUSER\\config\\user_profile.cmd\"\nAbove you said be careful that BOTH shared then the new profile user profiles would be loaded so don't duplicate, so I am unclear then as to why it is copying/creating what are duplicates to what is in shared?  I do init things usually in my tasks via separate scripts anyway so perhaps I'm premature in asking prior to just testing but is it that these appear as duplicates to my shared defaults simply because they ARE always vanilla defaults?\nAnd just to re-confirm for testing, ALL lua and user profile/alias' first execute the shared and then also execute ALL of the same via profiles so for instance a ENV variable named \"TESTVAR\" set in both user_profile.cmd in shared to \"ONE\" and then the same var set to \"TWO\" in profiles winds up after init being set to \"TWO\", correct?\n. Hey sorry absolutely testing looks great on this!  In fact I missed your message above and just checked hoping to find this enhancement merged into master seeing these last few commits.  Nobody knows about it but I guarantee once they do that I won't be the only one using this feature especially if they see how it can be combined with cloud storage as a careful fully portable install which is what I've been testing and this is the piece that's been missing.  Commit away!\nEDIT:  And FYI when introduced your recommendation of using:  <PATH TO CLOUD STORAGE>\\cmder\\cmder.exe /c <PATH TO CLOUD STORAGE>\\cmder\\profiles\\%computername%-%username% is what I've been actively using now (so what you might want to use as a recommended example) with zero issues on multiple systems, all syncing the (now separate) inits, configs, and clink histories real-time to all other systems all while maintaining a single master shared set of configs, and then all to the cloud for backup/distribution to all other systems..

    "thomthom": "My VS2015 installation ended up installing standalone git on my machine. This version doesn't include all the UNIX commands - and I wouldn't want them being available for my normal cmd console either.\nBut I do want them for my Cmder console. But as things are now where it checks for standalone Git first this setup won't work. I'm looking for a way to force cmder to always use vendor git - separate from my sans-UNIX-standalone-Git install. Is this currently possible, or would there need to be alternations to cmder?\n. It installed Git into ProgramFiles (the 64bit variant). I ended up temporarily disabling the lines in init.bat and that worked for now:\n:: Check if msysgit is installed\n:: @if exist \"%ProgramFiles%\\Git\" (\n::     set \"GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=%ProgramFiles%\\Git\"\n:: ) else if exist \"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Git\" (\n::     set \"GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Git\"\n:: ) else if exist \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\" (\n@if exist \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\" (\n    set \"GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\msysgit\"\n)\n@janschulz - with the changes you describe I'd then just add cmder's vendor git into the ENV: %GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%? And this is a ENV variable only cmder use? Or is this one used by Git itself to announce its location?\n. In my case I used cmder with git - then Visual Studio installed standalone git along with the ride for their installer - without all the UNIX commands. \nSo in my case the stand-alone git isn't what I wanted cmder to be using - and it was out of my control.\n. Never mind. Turns out I was in a folder with some longer filenames that I didn't see, and the default console size was just too small to display columns. \nThe moment I switched to another folder, or make the console larger it was all fine.\nUser-error - nothing to see here.\n. Same thing.\nIt also displayed an dialog that a newer stable version was available:\n\nI got the same thing when I downloaded from the website and installed. That time I updated. This time I skipped - to stay on that particular build mentioned in the previous post.\n. Any more info I can add?\n. When I updated I removed the old version first - and ran from a fresh clean extracted version.\nThe prompt itself looks fine. The only thing is the intermittent slow-down.\n. \u03bb where ls\nC:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\ls.exe\n. If I open a regular cmd from that dir and use ls I don't seem to experience any lag. Only from within cmder.\n. git version 2.7.0.windows.1\nI actually didn't install this manually - it got installed by another software, maybe Visual Studio.\nI would be fine having cmder use the version it bundle instead. There was going to be a ENV variable one could use, right? Has that made it into this latest version?\n. Updated to Git 2.9, again experience the lag. I'll try to force cmder to use the bundled version and see how that goes.\n. I made cmder load the git version that ships with cmder - but also this experience this lag. Any ideas to what I can do to debug further?\n. No - I only updated the stand-alone version. You want me to try to update the bundled version as well?\n(I might try to restore the original version I had - just to see if this relate to going from Win7 to Win10 - or updating cmder.)\n. Extracted into a completely new folder where cmder have never been located at - still the intermittent slow-down.\n. When I compare the old 1.1.x version it's fast. I never seem to see the intermittent slowness. I notice it has a folder named msysgit while 1.2.x+ have git-for-windows. Relevant?\n. I did an experiment - copied the vendor/msysgit from cmder 1.1 to the new version. And edited init.bat to use that folder for git - and then the slow down goes away. So it appear that the git-for-windows version shipped with cmder 1.2 and later doesn't play nice with my machine. (At least when running inside of cmder.) \n. The strange thing is - if I open a cmd in that folder where ls.exe is - I am not able to see the slow down. It appear to be a combination of cmder and git-for-windows.\n.

This may just be a case of intended use cases in documentation vs. actual traditional use cases, but it made me wonder if there was an intentional shift to the \"finished product\" (git-for-windows) when the transition was started within cmder. And if not I wanted to point it out in case there were tools that used to be in msysgit intended for its \"build environment\" that are now only in the SDK (which, I believe the SDK only came into being recently).\n.

If this is the case uncheck it and press Apply (if it ask you say to apply the change to all subfolders and files).\n.

Yes it's in the settings -> Keys & Macros\n(to open the setting it's in the menu opened by pressing the blue \"sandwich\" button on the bottom right corner)\n. Tried with the solution of #985 ?\n. Like this ?\n. I remember on 1.29 (haven't tested since) using ctrl+t or the green plus button caused the same thing to happens, but opening the menu next to the green button and choosing \"cmd as admin\" worked.\n. So I tried with an old version of 1.29 I had copied somewhere, didn't update conemu when asked, everything worked fine. Did the conemu update and now it doesn't work anymore in the normal way only with the sub-menu.\nDownloaded 1.3.1 (mini), refused the conemu update but the problem is already there.\nMy best guess is that it's due to changes in conemu that happened after the version released with 1.29\n. No even on the old version of 1.29 where the bug is not present, the checkbox already exist.\nI tried conemu on it's own (last version: 161022) and the problem is present there too. If you change the default task \"cmd\" by adding a * at it's start the same problem occurs (doesn't worked unless the new button is  checked but work in sub-menu). So it's a \"bug\" on conemu side. \nSo I've created an issue on the ConEmu github: https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/959\n. From the wiki: \"Open Cmder Here\" in context menu\nI'm not sure if this replace the cmd entry in the context menu.. Can you verify that you put the correct path in n the environment variable. Also try restarting your computer.. I'm just a user of cmder,  I don't know the rules for changing the wiki. But it's also a pretty standard thing on both Linux and windows that any modifications to an env variable require to restart the processes that use it. (Restarting the OS being the simplest option). @xnosx https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/. @Gelio you need to use \"where ls\" not \"which ls\" to know where the executable is located in windows.\nOn a pre-creator update with colors working this is what I have:\n\nSo this is not the source of the problem you have with colors.. Sure\n\nYou just need to have the folder where the nano executable is in the PATH environment variable. (and have restarted cmder after having modified the environnement variable)\nAs for where to obtain nano, you can either use the executable from the official website which probably use cygwin or look at other projets that try to properly port nano for windows. One example of such projects.. I don't know @MartiUK or @Stanzilla will probably be able to answer this.. Have you tried the solution from #985 ?. I'm able to get it to work with Xming. I need to have an environment variable called DISPLAY with value \"localhost:0.0\" (or to be more general what is written when you put your mouse over the xming tray icon)\nAnd they simply have Xming started before I open cmder.\nAlso depending on the server configuration I need to do ssh -XY instead of simply X to force it to use a non-trusted x11 server..

I really have no idea why I even have this file, I think it was something old dragged along since forever.\nQuestion remains though, why would Cmder/ConEmu/Clink even read this file?\n. @daxgames The problem appears to be failing to handle trailing slashes along with quotes.\nIt appears the /start argument is optional, as it will try to start in the first directory given, not sure if that's intentional.\nCompare, from the cmd prompt:\nCmder.exe /start \"g:\\temp\\Spaced Dir\\\" - fails and gives first the (wonky) \"Folder doses not exist\" error, then \"Unrecognized parameter\" error.\nCmder.exe \"g:\\temp\\Spaced Dir\\\" - fails and gives \"Unrecognized parameter\".\nCmder.exe /start \"g:\\temp\\Spaced Dir\" - works.\nCmder.exe \"g:\\temp\\Spaced Dir\" - works.\nCmder.exe g:\\temp - works.\nCmder.exe g:\\temp\\ - works.\nTC will however send the full directory with a trailing slash, this worked in 1.3.4.\n%windir% will not have a trailing slash.\nSo it's the combination of quotes and a trailing slash that makes it fail.\nAnd the help dialog doesn't really help...\n. > As you figured out in your last message by discovering '/start argument is optional', the help message tries to be helpful by already saying this. :-)\nYeah - it kind of makes more sense now that I know about it. I just thought it looked really foggy. The old dialog seemed a lot better. Of course at the time  I was struggling to just understand why the new version didn't seem to work at all with what I was giving it.\n\nWhat changes are you suggesting that would make it more helpful? Can you provide better wording?\n\nWell, the extra set of brackets outside makes it seem the OR applies to the whole /start argument (and that doesn't make much sense), I would suggest breaking it up into two lines. Or maybe like this:\n[/start [Start in Path]] | [Start in Path]\nor more readable\n/start [Start in Path] | [Start in Path]\nI.e. either of the options are valid.\n\nNot working with a trailing '\\\"' is definitely unexpected and I will look at it.\n\nThanks. Can't really ask for more than that \ud83d\ude04 \nOh and I've found a workaround for Total Commander, as I can just leave the arguments blank, and TC will set the current working directory correctly. Not sure why, but it works - maybe it doesn't apply the trailing slash.\nBut of course it would be good if Cmder could handle trailing slashes like one would expect.\nCheers!\n.

    "hacst": "Also having this issue. Windows 7 with cmder 1.3.0 and a locally installed git for windows 2.9.2 64bit. It seems to launch another git process that gets stuck every time you hit enter (maybe the identification of the dirty state?). Unfortunately that made the release completely unusable to me and I had to go back to my 1.2.9 version which doesn't show this issue.\n. @Stanzilla Unfortunately that didn't help. If I apply your patch I still see the issue.\nTo elaborate on my earlier description: When launching cmder 1.3.0 two git.exe processes are being started and (apparently) never exit. Each press of enter launches two new ones which also don't exit. This effect only occurs when the cwd is a git repository. In both cases (launch and pressing enter) no git processes linger if it isn't.\n. Now this is interesting. I was wondering why I couldn't reproduce what I described yesterday no matter whether I had applied @Stanzilla 's suggestion or not. No lingering git.exe processes at all. Then it occured to me that in the meantime a .gitignore was added because of the excessive amount of untracked files. Guess what: Dropping that gives me back the symptoms. To get a feel about the amount, here how many lines come out of git status --porcelain:\n```\n\ngit status --porcelain | wc -l\n282\n```\n\nThe command takes around half a second or so and leaves no lingering git.exe when executed in a cmd.exe outside of cmder.\ncmder behaves like I described yesterday. I also tried @janschulz 's replacement function but that didn't seem to change anything. \nRestoring the .gitignore leaves me with two lines from git status --procelain and the two git.exe's only flash up very quickly in the task manager and vanish again instantly when working with cmder.\nFor me the branch also shows as changed in cmder even though git status tells me there are no changes.\n. @arlinsandbulte 1.3.1? From what I can tell there is no such thing yet. Are there snapshot versions of cmder or sth.?\n. @Stanzilla ah. I see. I looked for the tag but because all previous ones had a \"v\" prefix (e.g. v1.3.0) 1.3.1 lacking that and being sorted to the bottom was unexpected.\n. I tried again with 1.3.1 today but the behavior hasn't changed. As soon as I have a repository with a sufficient amount of untracked files (by removing my .gitignore) two git.exe processes stick around and the .lock file is held open preventing me from most actions on the repository. Also I still get the branch name displayed as if the repository was dirty even if I restore the .gitignore and no git.exe's linger.\nHere is a small reproducer repository: cmder-linger-test.zip . It consists of nothing but an initialized git repo (no commits) with ~2k untracked (empty) files. As soon as I enter the repository cmder displays it as dirty (which is incorrect) and I get the lingering git.exes. If you rename the TEST.gitignore in the folder to .gitignore you'll see that the repo is still displayed as dirty by cmder (still incorrect) but no git.exe s linger and you can at least perform actions on the repo. Hope that helps.\n. I tried again with 1.3.1 today but the behavior hasn't changed.

Cmder is a set of tools including ConEmu that together is an enhanced version of the windows cmd shell and the init.bat is what handles loading those enhancements.\n\nI already know that, I am not stupid. I disabled it temporarily to see if that would make a difference on startup.\n\nFirst time launch is slower because some cfg files are initialized. Launch will always be SLIGHTLY slower because it is not vanilla cmd.exe but should not be impactful. Second launch on my system takes under a second.\n\nNot the case for me: it consistently takes ~5 seconds to launch. Once it is launched, creating a new cmd.exe shell (for example) in a tab or a window is quick. \nNote that I am not talking about the first launch after installation, but every launch of a new instance of cmder.exe.\nIt strikes me as a serious performance problem, since the launcher doesn't need that long to do its job and defers to ConEmu for the rest, and ConEmu launches quickly on its own. I'm willing to help investigate it however I can.\n. Precisions: my machine is an Core 2 Duo E8400 running Win7 Family SP1. Cmder is installed on an SSD. \nI'm gonna go ahead and see what I can understand on my own, but I'd appreciate any ideas about why this is so slow.\n. Found the problem:\nhttps://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/launcher/src/CmderLauncher.cpp#L172\nThe culprit \"non-answering\" process is akamai's netsession_win.exe. They don't offer it as stand-alone download - it's usually bundled with something else and I can't exactly remember what on my machine.\nUnfortunately there's little we can do against netsession_win.exe being slow to process its messages (AFAIK the process does process the message, but very slowly - around 2.2 seconds per SendMessageTimeout. I don't know why). But there are different approaches to solving that problem:\n1. Create the child ConEmu process before the SendMessageTimeouts. The child process inherits the parent's Environment block (as per MSDN) so this works.\n2. I'm not sure exactly why we need to broadcast an update everytime, even when no ConEmu window is open. So conditioning the SendMessageTimeout to the presence of a ConEmu top-level window could be one partial solution. (Using EnumWindow to list all top level windows.) Alas, the WM_SETTINGCHANGE message has to be broadcasted in case of update per MSDN's documentation.\n   2bis. Another solution would be to use SendMessageCallback which is asynchronous.\n3. Lowering the timeout value. 5 seconds seems arbitrarily high, setting to a lower value could help cut away some of the wait.\nI already implemented solution 1 (just rearranging the call to CreateProcess before the SendMessageTimeout) and it's much better for me. Please let me know if you want the pull request. I can also implement any other solution if necessary.\n.

But these options are not compatible with vim.. I found a very curios thing, a tricky temporal solution. After reading a file in vim, just try 'ctrl+z' to command console and return by typing 'exit' to previous file buffer in vim. Then.. mouse scrolling is perfectly working unless new file is buffered. \n1) Load a file\n2) Ctrl + Z\n3) exit\n4) Now you can move the prompt with mouse scroll temporarily. :)\nI am using console vim of Gvim 8.1 with 'set mouse=a in vimrc and the checked option - send mouse events to console'. \n. I think there are two ways. \n open tab without confirmation\n open window without confirmation\nFirst one is already given in hotkeys (type : Task or Macro : Alt+Shift+1~9) \nBut second one should be made manually as Macro .\nMacro is also a type of hotkey.

And by that I mean that new Cmder actually starts within specified \"Startup directory for new process\" and then it's working directory gets changed to whatever else.\nSo, in a task's command that starts cmder you can see something like -new_console:d:\"%USERPROFILE%\". According to -new_console's syntax, d flag is for changing working directory. Therefore for that command to not change directory just remove that switch and this issue will be fixed for you.. It has been in #1504, as you can see right above your message.. Do you have Internal CtrlTab option enabled? If yes, why not try setting hotkey to that User/Switch next console (and User/Switch previous console)?\n. One way to achieve that is to create a task that would launch different scripts in different tabs.\nFor example, it's able to create a simple task that just launches 3 cmds.\n\nSo with a bit of trial and error you can get what you want.. Isn't it how it should be? In your case git (and not the console per se) thinks that the rest of string including semicolon is parameters, which triggers an error. One normally run several commands with &&, no? Like git add -A && git commit --amend -no-edit && git push -f.. > I also did it with cmder on my old computer\nYou know, I kinda struggle to find any info about semicolon ever worked as commands delimiter in Windows's console.

If we forked the project and put the nano executable in the bin/ directory, and then rebuilt the application, is it correct that this would then automatically put nano in the PATH? Cmder looks almost perfect, but we're trying to figure out how tricky it would be to have a version that had nano installed off the bat. The other things we need, including git, look to already be included if we ask workshop attendees to install the larger version of Cmder.

I expected it to be called something like %cmder_git_root% if it was set by cmder.. @daxgames This is probably related to your last comment: I defined this GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\git-for-windows on my system, but cmder is still using the git installed by VS Community 2017. I worked around this by removing the VS2017-installed git from the %PATH%, but VS2017 updated git recently, and git is back in the %PATH% again, breaking cmder vendored git.. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, I have a few issues:\n\n\nAfter unzipping the latest cmder.7z from AppVeyor, running cmder.exe gives a bunch of error messages like:\nThe system cannot find the batch label specified - enhance_path_recursive\nThe system cannot find the batch label specified - enhance_path\nAFAICT, this is because the lines in init.bat are terminated by LF instead of CRLF.\n\n\nIf I have GIT_INSTALL_ROOT=C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\git-for-windows before I launch cmder.exe, then cmder can't find git.exe. The issue appears to be on line 186 of the init.bat:\ncall :enhance_path \"%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%\\usr\\bin\" append\nIt should be\ncall :enhance_path \"%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%\\bin\" append\n\n\nTrying to debug these issues, I had to go in and change init.bat to set debug-output=1. I think it would be better to have the option to control this also by an env. var. the way it is in the current release. I.e. on lines 10 and 11, instead of:\nset verbose-output=0\nset debug-output=0\nHaving this would be useful:\nif not defined verbose-output ( set verbose-output=0 )\nif not defined debug-output ( set debug-output=0 )\n. That didn't work for me because of the LF v. CRLF issue, so, I wanted to be able to see the debug output when I ran cmder.exe directly.. @DRSDavidSoft I will give it a try. This would be my first attempt at a PR (though, I've been following a couple of projects for a while now). . @daxgames init.bat's lines are terminated by LF (0x0A). It seems like because of that, cmd.exe's batch processor can't find the subroutines. I am getting these types of errors:\nThe system cannot find the batch label specified - enhance_path_recursive\nThe system cannot find the batch label specified - enhance_path. \n\n\n@daxgames, @DRSDavidSoft The way I read this, LF is not used as a token delimiter by the batch parser. Also, CALL scans the file on its own (i.e. while CRs are still intact), so the parser thinks that LF is simply the last character of the batch label.\nI'm going to test this again, though I have to figure out which appveyor build to use: I am guessing that I have to use the ones based on @daxgames's commits, because commits by others still have LF v. CRLF issue (at least until all the committers' .gittattributes gets updated as in https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/1665/commits/52db4449acf65b330ff4e0217e067c7500743242).

Couldn't the two share the same copy?\nAlso: If I call cmder from above described command line, it doesn't simply open a new Cmder tab in the current directory, but a new cmd.exe tab in the existing instance which then opens a new Cmder instance in the logged-in user's home directory. Not what I'd expect \u2013 but that seems to be caused by StExBar sending the entered command to cmd.exe explicitly: \"The edit box text is sent to the console (cmd.exe).\" So it would be nice if Cmder could stick to the directory it was started from\u00b9 (and to be able to have it captured by an existing window) :wink:\n\n\u00b9 yes, I know a hotkey can change there afterwards \u2013 but that sends me back to the intermediate cmd.exe tab unless that Cmder instance is completely closed.

This is the whole file:\n\nAnd this is the registry entry used to load them:\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Command Processor]\n\"AutoRun\"=\"%USERPROFILE%\\aliases.cmd\"\nThis appears correctly in regedit, btw.  If the file is absent, or empty, I have no problems with CMDer.  No errors and 'ls' works fine, too.\nI guess, right now, CMDer just isn't compatible with auto-running scripts via the command processor registry entries and this should be done via CMDer's own interface?\n. I can confirm that I was ballsing up CMDer's own alias system by having an existing persistent windows/cmd approach.  It's far easier just to edit the user-aliases.cmd file in the %CMDER_ROOT%/config folder.

    "xiazeyu": "@daxgames Sorry that I've missed init.bat's built-in command parser\nNow I've fixed it by using %CMDER_FLAGS% and added notes in user-profile.cmd\nBy the way, it seems that v1.3.5 isn't match current branch at all. Is that OK?. @daxgames @DRSDavidSoft I've optimize the comments about this feature, have a look plz.. @DRSDavidSoft \nI think document this function in README.md is a good idea.\nIn my vsCode.cmd, there's nothing but a call %cmder_root%/bin/vsCode/code.exe. I use cmder as an entry point of my working environment, so I'd better to have some commands to shell these editors with UI, not intergrade cmder into them, and that's what my vsCode.cmd for. Type vsCode, and I can shell vs cofe, and not interrupt my current console job.\nI think your wapper idea is excellent, that will make user-profile.cmd much better readable and clear. It's a good alternative to simple switch jobs(it can't replace those more complicated jobs which may process more than 1 argument eg. /setEnv development).\nI also think it will be too much complex if uder-profile.cmd has too much, and add more file may make it bloated.\nI will try if I can put this function into something like have.cmd, and it will just work similarly to the useage of alias.cmd. How ever automatically pass %CMDER_FLAGS% to have.cmd and **ability to call sub functions(like your :exampleFunction and :anotherFunction in user-profile.cmd) needs some research.. @DRSDavidSoft @daxgames @Stanzilla I've done my work, and have a look if this have something unexpected.\nI recommend to update the Wiki page when the PR is merged.. @daxgames See the latest commit.\nI agree with you to put these kind of scripts into vendor\\lib to prevent users to edit them.\n(My production environment is using v1.3.5 so I've missed your vendor\\lib change.)\nHowever, I think always using %flag_exists% xxx xxx is not that concise, maybe alias it or put it into %PATH% a better idea, since users don't use %lib_git% quite often, but %flag_exists% is directly used by users.\nI'm poor at naming functions, so I really think flag_exists is a better idea.. @DRSDavidSoft @daxgames @Stanzilla \nBy the way, is it possible to let me know when will the next stable version be released?. Instructions about Integration with vsCode have been migrated to https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki/Seamless-VS-Code-Integration. @daxgames I haven't found anything unexpected till now. I think there's a low possibility that this new feature would go wrong after configured correctly. . @daxgames Reasons are as follows:\nInfluenced global varibles:\n- %CMDER_USER_FLAGS% NEW\n- %flag_exists% NEW\n\nThis new feature has nothing to do with the kernal of cmder. It is designed to be executed optionally only in user-profiled.cmd. It won't be executed after user-profiled.cmd unless you call it in the terminal.\nThe only API it has changed is arguments passed to init.bat. flag_exists.cmd only parse single flags that can't be recognized by init.bat. Even if you passed arguments to init.bat accidentally, without the suitable %flag_exists% command, this function won't be executed. Even if you executed %flag_exists% accidentally, without the correct format, it will throw an error message, and won't do anything.\n\nSo the only problem it may have is flag_exists.cmd itself and the way user call it (or its configuration).\n\n\nflag_exists.cmd: I've been tested it for 2 months, and it showed no unexpection. Since the command of executing init.bat is a kind of fixed command, not dynamic ones, I don't think it will always have any strange cases this programmer cannot handle.\n\nUser configuration: because the useage of this feature is simple, and the only two unexpected behaviour are want to execute but won't work and don't want to execute but executed. In the worst situation, all these two problems can be solved simplely by not using this function. Moreover, it is easy to test configuration by run the program several times and change the configuration. Our document provided all kinds of examples, so it makes it easier to learn this new feature.\n\nThats all my explanations.. @daxgames @DRSDavidSoft I've found some problems.\nPlease see my comments on these later commits.. These concerns are just about some style issue, and since it can work, I don't think it matters a lot.. I passed to init.bat because I need to use it with no launcher in vsCode.\nthings like cmder.exe /cpp or cmder.exe /nodejs or  cmder.exe /python may be useful to those who need to initialize multi-environments but are to slow to start up.\nI don't know if Sublime also have internal terminal or othre things. Things like wiki(or documents) you can write as you want. Since I recently don't have a lot of time to dealing with such documents.(also not good at it).\nThanks for your idea and review anyway.. I'm totally agree with you.\nLook forward to your commits.. @daxgames I think your understanding is exactly the same with me.\nAbout pass args to init.bat or launcher: \n\n\nIf the flags are not passed from the launcher (Cmder.exe), I'll write the required code to make it happen. I think it will be useful to have both launcher and init.bat able to set flags.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/1758#issuecomment-421493343\nThis has nothing to do with the original design. It depends on you if you will add the function of  passing args by launcher. Since this is beyond by ability, if you think it too risky to add such function to launcher, just ignore the idea or mark it as a new feature and solve it in a later PR.\nAbout format: \nI think some of the difference exists because scripts in %cmder_root%\\vendor\\lib are mostly designed for init.bat, and not for the user. So it won't handling with args like \"/h\" and wrong syntax.\nIf you stick to it, you need to unite the format by yourself(sorry about that), since I can't get the rule of format(stylistic issues, comments style, best process flow as a lib).(It's think this solving this issue is not like using ESLint, which has a fixed rules to follow).\nThanks for your review and test anyway.. > Renamed %cmder_root%/vendor/lib/flag_exists.cmd to %cmder_root%/vendor/bin/cexec.cmd\n\n\nThis makes the file easily callable by its name since %cmder_root%/vendor/bin/ is added to the path\n\n\nDoes it mean that you can use cexec /startnotepad start notepad.exe instead of %cexec% /startnotepad start notepad.exe? Since this vendor/bin didn't occur in the current release, I'm not sure about this.\nAnyway, Is it a conflict or you wants to preserve both calling method for compatibility?\nIf cexec, I think it's better to create another script called ccall and remove the /setPath detection.\n. Need this feature too.. @DRSDavidSoft\nvsCode itself is an alias which I used to run vsCode.\nI put here just to show an realistic example, it can be replaced by anything.\nIt is possible that the user may feel confused with what it is, like you did, but I does'nt have a clear idea of what to write here yet.. Here's the strange point. If I use\nbatch\nendlocal\nset \"CMDER_USER_FLAG= \"\nsetlocal\nthe whole init.bat won't behave properly.. Migrate CMDER_FLAGS into global varible CMDER_USER_FLAGS. I'm not sure if this /setPath is good or the old one(add global varible %flag_exists% automatically) is better.. Also I'm not sure if %GIT_INSTALL_ROOT% goes wrong have something to do with this.\nI run echo %GIT_INSTALL_ROOT% and the output is !GIT_INSTALL_ROOT!. And I'm quite confused.. The original intention of this function is to handling different entries with different behaviors.\n/config/user-profile.cmd is one of the entry. The other entries (eg. vsCode) need to pass arguments to init.bat to get the specific environment with specific behavior.. I use vendor\\init.bat /noAutorun.\nit is actually Conemu called init.bat with arguments which have nothing to do with custom flags.\nThis section in README.md is Command Line Arguments for init.bat. So it has nothing to do with the launcher, that's why I put it here instead of Cmder.exe Command Line Arguments.. Cmder.exe /startNotepad DO NOT WORK.\nSee https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/1758#discussion_r217874087. Yeah, but I think it has nothing to do with this PR.\nIn my point of view, this PR just isn't a BREAK CHANGE.\nThey can find this new feature in CHANGELOG or README.md.\nWe just recommend them not to edit init.bat, if they modified init.bat, it's their responsibility to check carefully while upgrading.\nAbout we should discourage users from directly editing this file.. I don't think it has something to do with this PR.. https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/0d2e16c6536495c9ebc2466b3a15582a9aee45e3/vendor/bin/alias.cmd#L17\nhttps://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/1758/files/39f47870a339c99e7526920ec3e06b875db8890b#diff-6584be369e2738104e1069789ea6bfe4R29\nFor the detection of NOT, copied from your alias.cmd.. Since cases like vsCode, I need shell environment for internal terminal instead of a brand new cmder window, I pass to init.bat. For other cases, pass arguments to cmder.exe may be useful.. I'm not good at making titles. If you get what I meant, I'm happy if you can make it clear.. @daxgames Your understanding in https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/pull/1758#discussion_r217885586 is correct. But it's just the current design.\n@DRSDavidSoft suggests an further idea that args can be passed BOTH via init.bat and via cmder.exe(the launcher, he said he could have a try.), instead of only parse args passed to init.bat. \nWhich means passing arguments to the launcher is also a way to start from different entries. (instead of only by init.bat). ",

    "Tomalak": "Fixed with #1991.\ncc @daxgames @Stanzilla . Hi @daxgames, this error is can happen when string.gsub() is called with a raw replacement string, i.e. one that contains user input and can therefore contain rogue % characters. It's fixed by escaping % to %%.\nFor example here, where lambda comes from the user's environment and could contain virtually anything:\n```lua\n-- broken for any value of lambda that contains %\nstring.gsub(cmder_prompt, \"{lamb}\", lambda)\n-- fixed\nstring.gsub(cmder_prompt, \"{lamb}\", lambda:gsub(\"%%\", \"%%%%\"))\n```\nIt can't hurt to scrutinize all gsub() calls in clink.lua and add such escaping code - currently there seem to be only 9 such lines overall, and not all of them are even relevant.. @Stanzilla Done. #1991. It's not exactly the same thing. hg status shows new files (not added to the repository):\n```\n\nhg status\n? test.txt\n```\n\nwhereas hg id -ib does not:\n```\n\nhg id -ib\n000000000000 default\n```\n\nonly after including the file in the repo, the output changes:\n```\n\nhg add test.txt\nhg id -ib\n000000000000+ default\n```\n. Just to throw this in here (cc @Stanzilla)\n\nhg id -ib takes significantly longer than hg branch and hg status combined. \n```\nD:\\some\\repo default\n\u03bb hg branch --time\ndefault\ntime: real 0.016 secs (user 0.016+0.000 sys 0.000+0.000)\nD:\\some\\repo default\n\u03bb hg status --time\nM test.txt\ntime: real 0.037 secs (user 0.016+0.000 sys 0.016+0.000)\n```\nThat's a total of 0.053 seconds, as opposed to\nD:\\some\\repo default\n\u03bb hg id -ib --time\n6242b58ed6c7+ default\ntime: real 0.251 secs (user 0.156+0.000 sys 0.094+0.000)\nhg id -ib works, i.e. it gets the needed information, but it's awfully annoying to wait a 250ms-ish for every prompt. Maybe this isn't such a good way forward after all.. Okay, let's do some science. On my machine there currently are a total of 68 Mercurial repos of varying size and complexity, some small, some large, with subrepos and without, some clean, some with a couple of dirty files, some with a number of \"unknown\" files, too. (None of them has the order of 27,000 files, though I also believe that's not a typical use case.)\nSince hg id -ib does not show the state of \"unknown\" files, I'm using hg status -amrd (added, modified, removed, deleted) in order to produce comparable output and keep the file listing short, because this takes time, too.\nSo I ran hg branch --time, hg status -amrd --time and hg id --time against all of these repositories and graphed the reported \"real\" time values in Excel as a stacked bar chart:\n\nGreen on top is hg id -ib, red below that is hg branch, blue at the bottom is hg status -amrd.\nIts obvious that hg id -ib produces some huge outliers, whereas the performance of hg branch is pretty much constant through the board, and hg status is pretty low as well, but with some variance in the repos where there are modified files to report.\nOverall, the timings of hg branch and hg status combined generally lie beneath the 50 millisecond threshold, which I would consider perfectly tolerable. My example above was taken from one of the repos that are an outlier for hg id -ib, that wasn't intentional though.\nhg id -ib generally lies below or at the 50 ms threshold as well, but its performance is not as consistent. Also, committing any changes will bring hg status back to ~16ms, so the user has some control over it. On the other hand, hg id -ib seems to take its sweet time for complex repos no matter what state they are in.\n(FWIW, for this test I've used Mercurial version 4.3.1, 64bit, on an SSD.). ",

Huh. That's bizarre. So if I downloadcmder.zipand unzip it, and openCmder.exedirectly, it produces no errors. But as soon as I copy the contents of cmder.zip into my original cmder setup it gives me the errors.. Huh, it actually appears to be thevendorfolder thats causing the issue. Theconfig` directory has no effect.\nEDIT: specifically the conemu-maximus5 directory\nEDIT: specifically the ConEmu.xml config file. ~~Well, I figured it out. It had something to do with the XML.~~\nOne line:\nOld:\nxml\n<value name=\"ComSpec.Type\" type=\"hex\" data=\"00\"/>\nFix:\nxml\n<value name=\"ComSpec.Type\" type=\"hex\" data=\"03\"/>\nEDIT: Wait..............\nMy COMSPEC was set to cmd.exe. Changing the ComSpec.Type to 03 effectively made Cmder use cmd.exe. So scratch everything I said about it working for the default cmder setup...apparently it does not if I set my COMSPEC to \"C:\\Program Files\\JPSoft\\TCMD22\\tcc.exe\"\nAlso, it appears to actually work for TCC/LE, just not for TCC from Take Command\nThat is, it works for COMSPEC=\"C:\\Program Files\\JPSoft\\TCCLE14x64\\tcc.exe\", but not for  \"C:\\Program Files\\JPSoft\\TCMD22\\tcc.exe\".\nSo:\nWorks:  COMSPEC=\"C:\\Program Files\\JPSoft\\TCCLE14x64\\tcc.exe\"\nNot Work: COMSPEC=\"C:\\Program Files\\JPSoft\\TCMD22\\tcc.exe\" or COMSPEC=\"C:\\Program Files\\JPSoft\\TCMD23\\tcc.exe\". What seems to run without any errors with none of the cmder enhancements?\nIt seems to run with enhancements, without error, if I use TCC/LE as ComSpec. With full TCC, there are errors but there are working cmder enhancements, which is somewhat strange.\nThe error is \nshell\nTCC: Unknown command \"/c\" echo \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\Scripts;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu;C:\\Program\"\nTCC: Unknown command \"/c\" echo \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\Scripts;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu;C:\\Program\"\nTCC: Unknown command \"/c\" echo \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\Scripts;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu;C:\\Program\"\nTCC: Unknown command \"/c\" echo \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\Scripts;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu;C:\\Program\"\nTCC: Unknown command \"/c\" echo \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\Scripts;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu;C:\\Program\"\nTCC: Unknown command \"/c\" echo \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\Scripts;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu;C:\\Program\"\nTCC: Unknown command \"/c\" echo \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\Scripts;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu;C:\\Program\"\nTCC: Unknown command \"/c\" echo \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\Scripts;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu;C:\\Program\"\nTCC: Unknown command \"/c\" echo \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\bin;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\Scripts;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu;C:\\Program\"\nTCC: Unknown command \"/c\" echo \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\bin;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\Scripts;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu;C:\\Program\"\nTCC: Unknown command \"/c\" echo \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\bin;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\bin;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\Scripts;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu;C:\\Program\"\nTCC: Unknown command \"/c\" echo \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\bin;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\bin;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu\\Scripts;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5;C:\\tools\\cmder\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu;C:\\Program\"\nTCC: Unknown command \"/c\" type \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\config\\user_aliases.cmd\" \"\"\nCreating initial user_aliases store in \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\config\\user_aliases.cmd\"...\n        1 file(s) copied.\n        1 file(s) copied.\nUpdating old \"C:\\tools\\cmder\\config\\user_aliases.cmd\" to new format...\nIt causes C:\\tools\\cmder\\config\\user_aliases.cmd to be altered on each run:\nbatch\n;= @echo off\n;= rem Call DOSKEY and use this file as the macrofile\n;= %SystemRoot%\\system32\\doskey /listsize=1000 /macrofile=%0%\n;= rem In batch mode, jump to the end of the file\n;= goto:eof\n;= Add aliases below here\ne.=explorer .\ngl=git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate  $*\nls=ls --show-control-chars -F --color $*\npwd=cd\nclear=cls\nhistory=cat \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\.history\"\nunalias=alias /d $1\nvi=vim $*\ncmderr=cd /d \"%CMDER_ROOT%\"\nTwo runs later,\nbatch\n;= @echo off\n;= rem Call DOSKEY and use this file as the macrofile\n;= %SystemRoot%\\system32\\doskey /listsize=1000 /macrofile=%0%\n;= rem In batch mode, jump to the end of the file\n;= goto:eof\n;= Add aliases below here\ne.=explorer .\ngl=git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate  $*\nls=ls --show-control-chars -F --color $*\npwd=cd\nclear=cls\nhistory=cat \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\.history\"\nunalias=alias /d $1\nvi=vim $*\ncmderr=cd /d \"%CMDER_ROOT%\"\n;= @echo off\n;= rem Call DOSKEY and use this file as the macrofile\n;= %SystemRoot%\\system32\\doskey /listsize=1000 /macrofile=%0%\n;= rem In batch mode, jump to the end of the file\n;= goto:eof\n;= Add aliases below here\ne.=explorer .\ngl=git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate  $*\nls=ls --show-control-chars -F --color $*\npwd=cd\nclear=cls\nhistory=cat \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\.history\"\nunalias=alias /d $1\nvi=vim $*\ncmderr=cd /d \"%CMDER_ROOT%\"\n;= @echo off\n;= rem Call DOSKEY and use this file as the macrofile\n;= %SystemRoot%\\system32\\doskey /listsize=1000 /macrofile=%0%\n;= rem In batch mode, jump to the end of the file\n;= goto:eof\n;= Add aliases below here\ne.=explorer .\ngl=git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate  $*\nls=ls --show-control-chars -F --color $*\npwd=cd\nclear=cls\nhistory=cat \"%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\.history\"\nunalias=alias /d $1\nvi=vim $*\ncmderr=cd /d \"%CMDER_ROOT%\".

The error isn't raised during git detection, but is raised during git configuration (which is done when a git is supplied, or when a git is detected). See init.bat :CONFIGURE_GIT.\nThe reason the error is raised on my system (and Jorg's apparently), is that there is an env.exe in my path which does not automatically translates /usr/bin/locale to a locale.exe somewhere my path. My env.exe actually tries to execute /usr/bin/locale, and as /usr/bin/locale does not exist, it raises the error. The issue is really about that the script assumes env works like the git provided env, and that assumption is broken on some systems, and it causes an error that is hard for users to fix.\nWould you consider reopening the issue please? Would you take a PR with the fix I mentioned in the original description?. ",

I checked the lua script error.\nBecause lua is not a development language I am proficient in, so I try to google it.

At the beginning, the person in charge started to build a Chinese directory, such as \u4ee3\u7801\u7ba1\u7406, and then used English to build the project, so there is a Chinese path. \u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d\nSo the way I solved it for the first time is the same as this one.\nbranch = string.gsub(branch, \"%%\", \"%%%%\")\nThe program did not report an error, but the output text is as follows.\n\nI have a little obsessive-compulsive disorder, I don't think it is very good.

So I boldly fork it, modify and propose the merge application, so I don't need to manually modify the lua script for the next upgrade. As I said before, lua is not a development language that I am proficient in, so I hope you can check it out and make the correct changes.\nI hope to help you a little.\nFinally, cmder is really easy to use, ^_^.
