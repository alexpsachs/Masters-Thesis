    "dularion": "Yes, the purpose of this code is for self-hosting the application. Maybe one day in the future I can find a way to make something public out of this without getting into legal issues, but for now it is self-hosting only. \n. Good thinking! I could've added it on creation of the github project, but I missed that part. Do you know of any automated way I can add one to an existing repo? I'll also google it a bit and see what I come up with. \n. Added it now\n. Fixed in this issue: https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/2\n. Or is this maybe not enough? \n. I added a reference to the readme now, too. Thanks :) \n. Thats really cool! Yea, I need some help with it I think. Never developed to their API. Also, I need to buy a chromecast. But thats been overdue anyway :) \n. Anyone feel like donating one? :P \n. :D yeah Ill order one now. You convinced me \n. I bought one now and I am sort of stumped. if default html5 controls are enabled, chromecast for mobile adds a little chromecast symbol. Great, exactly what we want. But since I created a custom gui, I cant seem to find a way to speak to the api in regards to casting... I will have to do some more digging, but if any of you know of a way to enable the default html5 casting without using the default html5 video gui, I would be thankful! \n. Thanks! Will take a look. But just now another pragmatic solution hit me. That little button only seems to appear on mobile anyway (unless i'm doing something wrong on my local machine), so what about this: \nfor a mobile user... \n- the default html5 gui is used \n- the custom functionality (next video & episode browser) are added in a auto-hide top-bar. It anyway doesnt all fit in the bottom. \n- And that way, on mobile, I would have the default chrome cast button. \nWhat do you think? \n. I have the extension, the buttons still don't show up though. For instance here http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp the button appears in mobile, but does not appear in my chrome on mac (extension installed). \nRegarding UX: for a mobile phone I don't care too much about the UX tbh, maybe I should? That I why I would do that sacrifice. But only on mobile. \nThanks for the link to the resources. Will take a look at it. \n. Ok, so I added the basic html5 chromecast functionality now. To test it, you guys have to go on your local version (or my demo-page) on your mobile device and fullscreen a video. when you do, you should have the regular GUI of html5, with the chromecast button. But I (on my old samsung galaxy 3) have the issue, that it tries to connect with chromecast but cancels connection again after a view seconds. Can anyone reproduce this or does it work for you guys (hoping!) ? \n. For me it works with https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.twokit.castbrowser&hl=en\n. And same for iPhone. Works pretty well actually! But I'll add proper support later on. Does this work for you?\n. Its no demo, it's a private server hosting the app.\n. Yea, 1.6 is a bit on the old side. It uses the one that is set in your JAVA_HOME Variable. You should try to go for the latest stable jdk1.7.x. I use 1.8.0_40 actually, but that is not required. \n. Actually, I made a mistake .. I don't run it in 1.8.0_40.. i run it with 1.7.0_65. Seems like my IDE had a special setting that overrode my java version. Btw, I'm also running on OS X Yosemite. I'm sorry for the trouble and the wrong info. Would be so kind to try with 1.7.x and let me know if it worked? \n. Great! And sorry again for the info :P \n. You could try the following: \nRun the JVM with -XX:MaxHeapSize=256m (or any big number), and possibly -Xmx512m\nhere is a stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4401396/could-not-reserve-enough-space-for-object-heap\n. Sounds rad!! \nIt took be about 4 days to get this together. But the road-map is full of additional features that I want to add. Here is the list: \n- folder-crawling to discover files as an alternative to uploading them manually\n- Synchronized watching between 2 or more browsers (synchronized play/pause etc)\n- Video-conversion via ffmpeg through a cron-job for multiple html5-compatible formats\n- Functionality to add subtitles while viewing\n- Functionality to switch between multiple video-files (for instance for different video-quality)\n- Chromecast Support\n- Better iOS Support\n- (Maybe porting it over to NodeJS)\n. It's pretty likely that I'll do it eventually if the demand is great enough. The reason why I chose Grails is because I program so fast with it.. it would have taken me 4x as long to do the same in nodejs... and there are some things i wouldnt know how to do in nodejs which I would need to figure out first. But in all honesty, for someone who is good with nodejs it would be pretty easy, because all that is needed are several CRUD-REST endpoints for the different database commands... the rest is anyway done in AngularJS. \n. Ive opened a new issue https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/20 with the nodejs-port as a subject. I will close this one if that is ok?\n. only one way to find out :D \n. Yep! Fixed that 2 commits ago :) please pull & try again\n. Drag and drop em in :) The browser is only for already added files\n. from your file system onto the individual episode-boxes. you should see in the gif in my readme. \n. you can upload 7 at a time, all the others get queued.\n. That is not yet implemented, but I will add that asap :) \n. oh dang... is that a bug or is it really a storage issue on your end? \n. you can change the directory though, as long as you update the path in config.groovy (see readme for more detail) \n. yep. just make sure the application has read/write permissions to that new folder. By default, the app uses the path in the config.groovy (so /data/streama) and adds another folder inside of it, called upload. All files in it have hashed names, and those are the ones it looks for. So if you change the path to /bla in the config, then the files should be at like /bla/upload/XYZ.mp4\n. Yep, don't see a reason why they shouldnt. Unless there are permission restrictions to the linked files. \n. aww :( \n. I know the error in the middle. but it looks like it is restarting also ... is that true or doesnt it auto-restart due to the error? \n. ok, if it doesnt auto-restart then all this is, is a cosmetic error that I couldnt yet get rid off. The reason why your file isnt playing seems to be of a different nature: the file may not be html5 compatible. Could you try the following for me: could you open a new browser tab (empty is fine) and just drag the file in? if a video-player shows up, the file is html5-compatible. if the file gehts downloaded, its not. Please report back. \n. yeah.. \navi often uses an incompatible codec :( mp4 & mkv is the way to go ... In the future I will add an auto-conversion, so that when you add files it converts to the right formats, but i havent added it yet ... :( Might do that over the weekend now. \n. Btw, are you using chrome or firefox? \n. kk, good. more formats are compatible with chrome than with firefox :) \n. here is an overview of codecs & browsers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video#Browser_support \nI'll add that to the readme too \n. MPEG-4 is not the same as mp4, if that is what you mean. \"The adaptive bitrate streaming standard MPEG-DASH can be used in Web browsers via the HTML5 Media Source Extensions (MSE)[16] and JavaScript-based DASH players.\" I have not added those extensions. But I will look into it. The best format in my experience is h.264 (most mp4 and mkv files)\n. This is one of my files for example: \nhttp://grab.by/JftM\nI can see that the \"kind\" says MPEG-4 movie, but the important part is the codec further below. \n. x265 is pretty new afaik, not even sure if ffmpeg can convert it properly (which I would use to convert). I dont think its supported by chrome yet. \n. I just read the following: \"Both of these codecs are still a ways off from any sort of widespread adoption. The specs aren't even finalized, as far as I know.\"\n. Thats pretty awesome, I'll take a look if I can implement that without breaking regular viewing :P \n. I found this for another Debian User: \nI had the same problem in Debian with the latest version of Grails 2.4.3. I added the jdk tools.jar in classpath to get past the error.\nIn Debian I had to do\nexport CLASSPATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/lib/tools.jar\n. That is actually true. Will add it. \n. Is the problem solved for you now, @thesupergeek ?\n. hmm.. yea, it sounds to me too like it cannot connect. the application assumes a login to the db of username: root, no password. also, be sure to check that the db name is exactly \"streama\". also, is your mysql running on localhost? the application assumes as much. \n. If nothing works, try changing the connection info in the file grails-app/conf/DataSource.groovy. The one to change is the section for production, because run-war builds a production version of the app. \n. Yea, that one you can ignore. Its something about the default jquery that is built into grails that doesnt compile correctly. I will remove that one and add one installed via bower instead some time. thanks for pointing it out :) \n. No problem :) Glad you like the project anyway :) \n. Added different jQuery now. Hopefully it will work better now. Reopen please if the error still shows up for you. \n. That sounds interesting, but actually I don't know so much about NAS. How does the operating system see the storage? is it like a mounted drive? in that case it works great with it, because you can set the upload-location to anything you want that is recognizable by the system as a valid path. If it works differently, I guess I would have to implement some sort of API for this. \nRegarding the copying of the files: A file-crawler is in the works, meaning in a future update of streama you will be able to configure a file-system location that will be crawled by the application. Files will be found and recognized through a naming-convention and they will be added as shows/episodes/movies automatically. \n. The ability to store there is already available today, you just need to change the storage path configured in the config.groovy. I will make this setting more accessible through the interface soon. But for now you could change the value there, make sure tomcat has read/write permissions to your target folder, and you should be good to go \n. Oh you mean like that? Interesting.. I actually have no idea how to get something like that in place without first saving it on the server (requiring you to use bandwidth to transfer it there) and then from there uploading into the NAS.. and each time it plays a file also fetching from nas and routing through the server. But I know a guy who is really good with this kind of stuff. Maybe he has some ideas :) \n. Well in that case that functionally is already in place. Easier for me :)\n. Agreed! Sounds like a good plan!\n. I think what you are describing overlaps with another issue, too: https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/16\nThese two are getting mixed up a bit, what this issue was originally in reference to was linking to files via url, such as a file on googledrive. \n. yea, well.. this issue stems from a comment on reddit where a user asked for exactly that: linking in an external file via url, such as the ones he has on google drive. But I didn't make that very clear in the title... :P \n. for files on a drive without automatic crawling, I was going to program a file-browser. So the user can set another directory in the settings, which can then be used to browser files and folders in the application gui and select files from there. But maybe that is a stupid approach? \n. That could work.  I was thinking about a sort of File Browser also, with folders and files, that can be used to add files to episodes/movies. This could be step1. And then I would implement crawling files based on a naming convention and auto-generating the content. But the file browser might still be necessary at times due to some sort of failure in the mapping of the file name and content. \n. This issue has been adressed in this release: https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.2.3_beta\n. I like your idea @stonie08 but please make a separate issue for it :)\n. Ok, I have pushed a first try at h264 video conversion to this branch: https://github.com/dularion/streama/tree/videoConverter\nIf anyone feels like playing around with it, feel free! \n. Hmm, it cannot find the bash script in the project root for some reason. im calling it via './convertVideoH264.sh'. works locally. I'm gonna look into it. anyone have any ideas in the meantime? \n. I added it in git on purpose so people wouldnt have to install it :/ I looked at their license and it stated that it could be freely distributed. Why is it not good to add them you think? \nThe reasoning behind using handbrake instead of ffmpeg is that I saw more people referencing handbrake (in forums etc) when it comes to h264. Other than that no reasoning at all. I could do ffmpeg also, its really not important to me. as long as conversion works and the users are happy :P \n. Ok makes absolute sense. Will use ffmpeg instead and will remove the binary. Thanks for the info, learned something new :) \nBtw, since you seem to know a little bit about this stuff, do you know a good ffmpeg h264 execution for me? I tried the following, but there was no sound. Looking around for others now, but there are so many different options that people suggest... its a bit like a jungle. \nffmpeg -i input.avi -an -vcodec libx264 -crf 23 test.mp4\n. that sounds really fancy and interesting .. But this doesnt work with html5? \n. After reading this answer on stackoverflow http://stackoverflow.com/a/9477756/919459 it seems like the whole \"deprecated\" debate was because of poor wording, and that that is actually not the case \n. Thats a good idea. Will look into an api for that \n. I was thinking more of something like this http://subsmax.com/subtitles-api/ but I'll have to look into different ones and see which one works best \n. yep, makes sense. Thanks! \n. You can actually upload subtitles already! They have to be in vtt format. ( there are online converters for srt to vtt). For autofetching I agree with you, gotta keep that in mind.\n. Ok, in the next release, auto srt to vtt conversion is in place! If you want to try it already today, you can switch to branch \"next\" at your own risk :) It will be added to the rc soon though :) \n. Yea, But say for private use, or family use, if you put it up on a server, like https://streama.club, then maybe it gets interesting.. depends on how people use it, i guess :) \n. :+1: \n. I've only ever coded nodejs vanilla style. But I find that sort of tedious. Does anyone know a good MVC that would be suitable for a REST-application? \n. Also, do you guys use passport or is there a better authentication module out there for node? \n. @tegon I could always use the help :) For instance, it would be helpful if you could get a basic REST application running with a nice MVC and authentication in place. That already takes care of a big chunk. \n. I'm pro angularjs also, especially since v2 promises to deliver some really great improvements regarding performance.\n@dantheman213 I know Express and I really like it. Didn't know there was an MVC implementation of this, though. I thought of express more as a \"deliverer of content for nodejs\". But in the case of this app, I am not so interested in the \"View\"-part of MVC, but rather the Model and Controller part. In the past I always used to structure the apps MVC style with my best judgement, but I would really like some style guide. Your boilerplate does not really touch the subject of Models it seems like. \n. I also saw this: http://www.slant.co/topics/389/compare/~express-js_vs_sails-js_vs_meteor\nI think looking at the automatic JSON API, that sails.js may be interesting. what do you think? \n. And the part about Waterline ORM is really interesting, too \n. You want reactjs and ionic? ionic uses angular.. isnt that overkill? \n. Meteor.js seems very interesting though, will take a look at it\n. well, ionic made some very slick and great angular directives which also work on non-mobile. and the cordova is not a must, it is actually a separate library (cordova.js and ngCordova.js). But I agree that it doesnt quite seem to fit here. Especially since I already created an angular frontend, so no need to swap that out with another angular frontend imho. Switching to an entirely different frontend framework is a different story. \n. Actually I have quite a lot of experience working with unity and its 2d engine, and I agree with you in regards to the different platforms. But: creating interfaces in unity is a PAIN in the ass. also, working with http in it is no picnic either. There seems to be something like webview in unity, but that is not cross platform it seems, and I've never used it, so I don't know if it compares to the mobile webviews out there.\nI like your approach, and we should talk more about cross-platforming, but I for one will throw in the towel when it has to be unity, as it is so horrible to work with in some regards (from my experience). BUT: if more of you are interested in this, have at it! I would try to help as much as I can :) \n. FYI, I am currently working on a port to NodeJS with sails.js\n. Nope, will do it soon. still getting the basics going, reading a lot of documentation atm :)\n. Did you work in sails or another framework? \n. ah cool! I am still working on getting mine off the ground with the basic models needed in streama, so I will add a branch soon\n. Yea sorry! It's actually kind of difficult to try to maintain this version for the users who use it and also work on a completely different setup at the same time :P But I will try to make time asap\n. @tegon, how did you plan on handling authentication in your repo? I looked at your code now and didn't see an implementation of that. \n. ok, im working on authentication too, and was thinking about not using passport, but instead using the sails.js session & policy way, described in one of their tutorials. Will be interesting to compare later! \n. Thats great! I actually pushed my branch today, too. I took some of your models, I liked the way you implemented many-to-one. I also copied your code for inheritance, although I am thinking about merging movies and episodes into one larger video-model. I will keep on thinking about that, though. \nMy version contains authentication based on sails.js sessions and policies for the roles, all that works already. I also implemented theMovieDb and all it's API calls, so that is working smoothly. Now I am working on bootstrapping some values and later (hopefully tomorrow) I will implement the CRUD for the different content. Thanks for your hard work on your branch! It helped me get off the ground more quickly :) \n. oh wow, that is pretty awesome, that you have a fully functional version. But as I am using sails, maybe it is not a good idea to pull your changes into that branch, but instead create a different one? What are your thoughts? \n. Glad to hear it! \n. Hmmm, the issues pointed out here are really problematic: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3jw7fm/dont_use_sails_or_waterline/ \nThis will definitely influence this port. I will stop my current work on the branch until I find out more about the issues in the post. \n. I agree with all of you! It would be much easier to customize things if it ran in nodejs, but unfortunately I am working on bugfixes/features on the current version, and have a full time job and a baby, so I can't spend any extra time on the nodejs port right now. \nI was really enthusiastic and it started out great when I found sails.js but then I ran into some major issues with that framework and thus had to stop my work. I was still hoping that other people maybe want to contribute :) \n@dantheman213 I agree that Plex, being a project with multiple developers, financial backing and a lot more time in the business is much better than streama in pretty much every way. However, I think it is sad that you think, that this project got the stars without deserving them. If I misunderstood you, I'm sorry, but I think this project got the stars because people liked what they saw, thought it was a good idea, thought it was well executed and actually have forked it and have it running. \n. What do you mean about the lack of direction btw? It's all about video streaming last I checked. Pretty clear direction if you ask me. \n. I think the programming language behind the project has nothing to do with the conceptual direction of a project. The programming language is just the skeleton, its the rest that makes the application what it is to the users. The optimizations etc are lacking features, not lacking directions. But anyway. If you want to discuss this further we can take it in a separate issue thread :) \n. Well the thing is, that I started the port with sailsJs, which at the time just wasn't ready so I aborted. At the moment I am not focusing on the port, but I appreciate any and all contributions on the matter!. You seem to be using JDK6, is that correct? You can check by using echo $JAVA_HOME. for this JDK7 is required. \n. I think that link is incorrect.. for me (on mac) it has a /Contents/ inbetween. it looks like this\n/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_40.jdk/Contents/Home\n. I think thats great! was thinking about displaying their \"invitation-link\" that is sent out with the mail, since i don't store the password in the database, just the hash \n. I display it now as part of the user-management. If you copy-paste the link and navigate to it you can set the password. if you use incognito-mode you can even start their login-session afterward and try it out. \n. Reopen if you wish for more changes in that area. \n. Implemented in commit https://github.com/dularion/streama/commit/68cf2fb474226399e1558c3f1088aff6a49c7328\n. How did you test whether it is html5 compatible? did you do the quick-and-dirty test of opening a new browser tab and dragging it in, and seeing if the default player shows up? If the file downloads instead, its not compatible. \n. Hmmm.. What kind of javascript errors do you have? \n. Btw, others have used https://gist.github.com/ to send me stacktraces\n. does it work if you try to access it directly? \nhttp://localhost:8080/streama/file/serve/70b20bfb23310abff57417c290a3944ba8746a068ef5255a1d08ccd811522aa7.mp4\n. Ok, this is very strange idea, but: some people suggest that this may have to do with adblock? Do you have it running? and if so, could you disable it as a test? \n. Aha! That gets us closer to the issue :) go into grails-app/conf/Config.groovy and edit line 121 (or line 124, depending on how you run it. To be safe, just put the path in both)\nEdit: lines may be different since most recent commit. I mean the setting called grails.serverURL\n. I can add that url to the settings actually. In my most recent commit I added some base settings like the storage path and the api-key into the admin GUI. Ill add the base url right away :) \n. Added it now with commit https://github.com/dularion/streama/commit/e9545287f618b404ced61f8d6f3378aa999c5ce9\n. Is this issue closed? \n. Please reopen if problem persists\n. This is what someone else said who had a similar issue: \nIt turns out that this error was occurring because the app is running on a server behind a load balancer, which is attempting to cache files that pass through it. It's unable to cache the larger files as it has limited disk space, and the download fails.\nCould this apply for your situation? \n. Oh wait. I just read the beginning. Its the bug listed in known issues in the bottom of the readme file: \ngetOutputStream() has already been called for this response\nThis is merely cosmetic and nothing to worry about. The fact that your file does not play has most likely to do with the codec. Did you do the quick-and-dirty test of opening a new browser tab and dragging it in, and seeing if the default player shows up? If the file downloads instead, its not compatible.\n. What exactly do you mean? Does the browser-tab test show that the file is actually compatible, but streama doesnt get it? \n. So it is a codec issue then, if I understand you correctly. A quick fix is to use HandBrake for conversion to H.264. It is super high on my feature list to add automatic conversion in the future :) \n. oh.. :/ Thats unfortunate ... :( \n. True! Will get right on it \n. This has now been resolved with commit https://github.com/dularion/streama/commit/75f15824cb5ed4db3a9caf262a1cd125e89ccfcc.\nIMDB ids will now be fetched and saved when a movie or show are saved. \nTo update existing shows & movies, navigate to http://localhost:8080/streama/bulk/fetchImdbIdForAllMoviesAndShow\n. Please close this issue if everything worked out. \n. Do you have a longer stacktrace or is this it? also, could you echo out your JAVA_HOME for me? echo $JAVA_HOME\n. also, run java -XshowSettings:properties -version and paste it here \n. also, I found this: http://www.morkeleb.com/2009/04/04/grails-error-starting-suns-native2ascii/   maybe you have the same issue? \n. very true. I need to address this issue. But let me run something by you: I was thinking about using 2 roles, one called something like \"contributor\" and one called \"admin.\" both contributors and admins can upload files, edit shows and movies etc, but only admins can add & edit users and change the settings. What do you think? \n. :+1: \n. I'm not super happy with the name \"contributor\". Any ideas? \n. Much better :) \n. hehe true \n... hmmm\nMaybe contributor isnt so bad after all \n. \"Content Manager\" :+1: \n. All right, so with the last few commits I made the following adjustments: \n- added \"displayName\" for roles\n- added new Role \"Content Manager\"\n- server-side lockdown of several REST-endpoints, so that they are only accessible by certain roles\n- edit-dialog for users improved: added role-management\nAnd these are the basic rules for the two roles (I added this info to the GUI as well)\nUsers with the role Admin can edit Users & Settings. \nUsers with the role Content Manager can edit content. \nUsers with both rules have full rights.\nIt would be great if someone other than me tested all of this to see if it works (you might test differently from me and find some hidden bugs)\n. If anything is wrong with the roles, please create new issues. I will close this one\n. Thanks! will look into it\n. I cannot reproduce this unfortunately. Maybe it was fixed when I removed the baseURLs from the config file. You you check again? \n. nah, no hurry :) have fun at gamescom! \n. could you copy-paste the entire path where it looks for the video file? I have an installation where it runs under http://46.101.209.74:8080 (this is the demo page I am working on) and files are served from this url: \nhttp://46.101.209.74:8080/file/serve/1e809df97f60abbeaf3dc459e9431d6f0fe2015594585564a1ad6a2947aceb09.mp4\n. haha :D I am sure you are not! :) And shall no more bugs befall you! \n. so in your settings it says \"http://example.com:8080\", not \"http://example.com:8080/\"? could you go to the settings page and do a f5 to see if that is really the case? It might not have saved correctly \n. Thanks! Im looking to implement a lot more features in the future :) \n. Please reopen if problem comes up again. \n. Good idea! Just added trailers now, but some of them are such poor quality .. Will look into those! \n. Ok, I created it now :) http://dularion.github.io/streama/\nI also added it to the readme\n. :+1: for gitter.im! did not know about this \n. I added a gitter chatroom link to the readme now (under Roadmap). Not sure if anyone can join if I have to invite people? \n. I'd say so. OP? \n. I like it, though I am wondering: The typical approach is to send an email to the user and let him fill out a new password through a unique link. How could we recreate this for those that don't want to use a mail server? \n. Yea, you are right. I was only thinking about the password lost functionality. But of course, a simple change could be like you describe about. Password lost IS more complicated though.. \n. A complete profile Update & Password change is now included as of commit https://github.com/dularion/streama/commit/6b0cc6c40247d2c923c545b3608c91a7fe91a7e9\nAdded bonus: Users can now choose favoriteGenres. This paves the way for adding a category in the dashboard for \"Things you might like to watch\" \n. Reopen if the problem persists.\n. It just looks like that, it does not persist to the database. Its just angularJS fancyness getting in the way. I can take a look at it though\n. Where? What are you doing? \n. oh yea.. that is a springsecurity \"feature\", changing roles does not apply until you logout and back in. \n. yep, the two buttons is fixed, like 2 minutes ago \n. does it work if you log out and back in? \n. yea.. good idea. or forcing a logout. \n. fixed with https://github.com/dularion/streama/commit/8893cba44ce455c0027030595d7d7b322243799b\n. haha oops \nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/commit/3de424b1c2910c1eb04a3c4d8b578630b572d4ba\n. Added it. Thanks! \n. It gets auto-installed when installing tomcat7. Or didn't it, in your case? It did in all of my setups at least\n. Oh I get it now, Java gets auto-installed, but you need the JDK to create the war... hmmm. Ok, will add this line to the docu and reference you! \n. Please reopen if you believe that more info is required regarding JDK in the ubuntu tutorial. \n. :( Conversion coming soon! \n. Oh, that is new ... Do you see any JS errors or Server errors? \n. Ok, What browser are you using? What codec does the file have? Is it just one file or all files? If it does not affect all files, can you detect anything that the failing ones have in common? If you open the Dev Console and look at the network, what are the request-headers in the request right after you've used the srubber?  If all of these questions are a bit hard for you to answer (if you're not a frontend dev), are you willing to transfer one of the files to me that are giving you trouble? \n. I don't mean the save action, I mean playback. When scrubbing in the video, it should do several requests to the mp4 file, always with a Range header with an offset. \n. Ok\n. Willl try to get that fixed! \n. Okay, it's enabled now. Will do a quick test-push\n. Oh nvm, your pull-request did the trick. This is really cool! This is actually pretty motivating to write some tests. \n. I agree with all of the above, except for base_url as this is already part of the settings-configuration (so it works via values in the database, not any config file). \n. And for email from, smtp host and smtp port we could also use the db. the only thing that cant be in the db is the db connection itself. \n. i see..  but what if it is done, like the base_url, in a settings page that is part of the GUI? The db-connection will likely never change on one and the same server, but the \"from-email-address\" may very well change often. shouldn't that then be more easily accessible, for instance via the GUI? \n. Its grails that handles the writing of default-data, in a bootstrap.groovy. And for grails to run, the mysql has to be there anyway. So my suggestion would be to only put the most critical information in the external config which is required for grails to run. everything else can be handled by grails itself. And off the top of my head that would only be the db connection data. \n. But I don't want to overrule your judgement, I truly don't! I really like this dialogue, and am open to counter-arguments :) \n. agreed. Although, and now this is only my lack of docker experience, but doesnt the database reset every time you restart the docker image? That is, if the database only exists inside of docker. Or am I wrong? \n. Ah ok, yea.. that would be good. And necessary. \n. He may not be very active at the moment (busy with his day-job). if you want to suggest an alternative approach, feel free :) \n. It seems to be referring to a 500 error on the server. do you see any in the logs? \n. Ah yep. Could you try commenting out the try-catch wrapper around the response function? \nFor me these are lines 64, 73, 74, 75. That way you you will get the real error. \n. oh, haha. grails-app/controllers/FileController.groovy\n. yep, its cosmetic. thats why the try-catch is there. wanna get rid of it for real soon, but for now thats why the try-catch is there \n. catalina.out is the only relevant one. Also, I totally mixed up this issue with the other one you posted. So lets recap: You upload a file, in the frontend it shows you the blue overlay counting up to 100%. When it gets to 100% you get the error. does it then also disappear and the file was added? And at this point, you should not have the outputstream error, if anything, it should be something else. Something in UploadService.groovy.\n. nothing in the catalina? \n. hmmm.. this is so strange. What is your setup? how do you run the application? what operating system is it running on? \n. could you paste a ls -la for the upload directory so that I can see the permissions? \n. and: did the application create a subfolder called \"upload\" inside of the specified directory? \n. Since you had a playback error also, does that mean some files worked? in that case, is this one specific file? \n. hmmmm ... this is getting quite mysterious. Can we PM somehow? skype? \n. Please reopen if the error persists. \n. 403 - are you sure you are still logged in in the background? The session is sort of short, ticking \"remember me\" makes it much longer \n. can you paste the entire url? \n. yea, that should be fine. you just have to set it in the settings. Did you do that? \n. By default it gets populated with the /streama namespace, because that is most likely how most people will be running it. So if it differs, just change it there\n. :+1: \n. Does anyone have any experience with that? \n. I have not heard of it. But from it being js and the fact that its called \"node\"cast-js , can i presume that is is code specifically for a nodejs application? Currently this application is not written with nodejs, but it is in the works here https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/20\n. It sort of depends how the port goes. I am currently very optimistic, but 1) it might take some time, because I am getting to know the framework as i go, and 2) it might not work out in the same way as this app did. So in order to get it up and running soon-ish, the java library is not off the table imho. \n. Hmm.. did you by any chance edit the same movie in another browser tab while it was uploading? what happens in the upload-code is that I first fetch the movie from the db, then i process the uploaded file, and then I add it to the movie and save the movie. if the movie was updated between fetching the movie and saving the movie, then this error occurs. If you know how many times you actually edited/saved the movie, take a look into the database, table video. If the movie was only created and then the file was added, the version number should be 1. if it is higher than one, then something else was triggered that saved the movie. \n. hmmm.. i see what you mean. But if you navigated away from the upload I think it cuts the connection, because the upload is dependant on you staying on the page. Kind of like you wouldnt navigate away from a wetransfer upload. \n. please reopen if you have any more issues with this\n. I am not sure I quite understand -- Do you want me to to make my html5 video player design into its own library? \n. Ok, I'll see what I can do. Is there more interest for this from anyone else? \n. interesting. But wouldnt those links also just be regular http links? Like \namazon.drive/youruserid/file-xyz.mp4? \nOf course the issue of single-sign-on would have to be addressed. I am assuming you don't want to publicly share those files... correct? \n. is this related to https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/66? I was going to implement a file-browser in an upcoming release\n. But imagine the directory with your files was accessible through streama, and you could choose which files to attach to which media elements. In that case, no naming convention outside of streama would be broken, as streama would not rename any files that it not manually uploads somewhere. \n. Hi! So far I have not made any progress on this feature.  I've recently become a mother and so my time is a bit limited in these early weeks / months. But I'll try to get back to focusing on the project asap. Anyone who wants to implement this and throw me a pull request: feel free! :)\n. Yep! \n. Hi! I just tried, and I can login fine! Can you make sure not to have any spaces before or after? I will also take a look and see if there is a space somewhere in the website, so that this does not happen anymore. \n. Please reopen if this does not solve the issue\n. actually right this very moment I cannot login either. I am restarting the tomcat on the demo server to see if that resolves it. Last night i got some weird emails too, as though it had rebooted or something. Will check it out. \nEdit: yep! the database was completely gone for some reason. Maybe something in my backup-restore-trickery gone wrong. Anyway, fixed now. \n. Great fix, thanks! \n. Well, let's assume your routers IP address is something like 93.126.189.103, in that case you would reach streama via http://93.126.189.103:8080/streama. Now all you need to do, is set that url as your base url in the application. If you leave the base url at localhost, the application won't be able to serve the videos correctly. I think that should work. Let me know if it doesn't\n. ah ok :) thats what I meant above. Glad you got it working :) \n. I agree! But I've been struggling a bit with this. How would we get this to work with a self-hosted application? Would you on login to the app choose the url to the running self-hosted version of streama? \n. Cordova is NOT off the table, why would it be? It is awesome! \n@dcampogiani, no documentation, but this file is sort a list of endpoints & methods: https://github.com/dularion/streama/blob/master/grails-app/assets/javascripts/services/api-service.js\n. ah, you mean like that. You are of course right...  @dcampogiani, you are going to program natively? I personally prefer a cordova-approach, simply because everything is REST anyway, so it sort of makes sense to go for one-size-fits-all with web-technology (ie cordova). On the other hand, if @dcampogiani is willing to put his personal time into it, I sort of believe he should do what he is most comfortable with. But if you are just as comfortable with a cordova-style app, we should definitely talk about it imo!\n. Actually, I find ionic + ngcordova to be the most reliable mix for any hybrid mobile development. \n. Yea, well I have yet to figure out how to get spring security nicely working with REST. it tends to always do a redirect, which i find very very bad. I fonud this now, which seems promising: https://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-rest\n. http://alvarosanchez.github.io/grails-spring-security-rest/1.5.1/docs/guide/introduction.html\n. Ok so  I learned something yesterday. Apparently Chromecast only works for native apps currently. There is a Cordova plug in but it doesn't seem like it is being developed right now.  And for me that means that I will develop a native app (first ios, then android) that functions as a Chromecast remote. But don't let me stop you guys and your work! Just letting you know what my plan is. I will add links to the repositories here soon!\n. First app release is out, but this is still alpha status. anyone who wants to be invited to the closed beta later let me know with your email addr. https://github.com/dularion/streama-app/releases/tag/v0.0.1\n. yea, that is on purpose for constraint-issues. I just set a deleted-flag currently. I guess what I could do, is rename the username when this happens... The problem with deleting the entire user would be to also recursively delete their chosen favorite genres, their viewing-status etc.. From my work I am just used to never actually deleting records from the database, as this makes things undoable.. \n. as I said, I am used to it from work. If the whole deleting-action was a mistake and you want to undo, then you cannot do that if you actually delete all the records. It's a best-practice that I learned. But in the case of the unique username i see the issue. I could add a uuid to the end of the username on deleting.. \nI actually don't care much either way. I will mull it over and fix it, either by deleting the user and all associated records, or by adding a uuid to the username when deleting. \n. not a bad idea :) will go for that. \n. I am not sure I understand you correctly. Do you mean that we have one table, called user, containing among other the things the username with the uniqueness constraint, and another table with stores that same username and an id-reference to the user-table? and then once we delete the user, he gets flagged etc, the username is changed, but the original name stays stored in the other table? \nMy approach would have been to leave the username as is, and to append a uuid, so it would be something like user1@my-streama.com before delete, and after it would be user1@my-streama.com_9da548f2-40d3-4950-9c71-9485f4f97e0a that way, if you want to \"undelete\" you can simply rename the username to something that makes sense via for instance phpmyadmin. I mean, undeleting is sort of an edge case, but this way it would be possible. \nWhat would be the benefit of having an extra table like you are suggesting? \n. Didnt work in Linux?  Thats a shame! What Linux distribution did you use? What browser? \n. There was a \"browse for file\" button some time ago, but it didnt make much sense, as it only showed already uploaded files. instead, it will soon be replaced by this feature: https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/66\n. In the next version I will be adding an improved file-manager. You will still be able to simply drag-and-drop files as usual, but you can also open a more advanced file-manager. This will hopefully help new users find the upload functionality as well as not hinder \"power-users\". \n \n. hmm.. well I guess yes, since its all in one video file, you would simply create an episode record for both. although the episode_number, which is used for sorting etc, would be challenging for you to adjust correctly. Easiest would probably to see what the api does when you fetch all episode for a season. If it is an official double-episode, I am actually not sure how the api returns those values. But they probably got some way, and we could try mimicking that. Can you give me an example? What show/season/episode would be such a case? \n. Yea, sure. This can easily be done. although I wonder how complicated a documentation for that repo would get, as the ui is heavily dependant on the api calls. How would you suggest we do that? \n. I like your localstorage idea. Although localstorage is a tad limiting...  What about something like pouchdb? \n. I started docs for streama REST here: \nhttp://docs.streama.apiary.io/\nwill fill it with relevant data soon\n. Which you can reach from the dashboard? \n. Yea... that is actually a really important point. Thanks! \n. is it common practice to have them both in bower.json and package.json? I only had mine in bower.json\n. confirmed! Will look into it \n. It is nice to get help! Sometimes when you work on an application for a while you get sort of blind for all the bugs or you don't even test certain things anymore. So I am glad for any \"tester\" that is interested enough in the application to continue testing, even if bugs appear \n. Is this a related issue? also: can you give me an example? what non-existing site were you trying to reach and how come you tried to access a non-existing site? \n. I am not sure I can do that, that is something that grails does automatically. Maybe someone else here knows how \n. I had never heard of both of these services before. Interesting. I will look into this down the road. Thanks! \n. We are already on it, see this issue: https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/20\n. Looking forward to your contributions!! \n. Let me know if the approach suggested by @coxley is not what you had in mind. Until then, I will close this issue.\n. is this related to https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/66 ?\n. no DLNA support currently, there are some discussions regarding this though, see https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/58. Regarding lags: not sure how DLNA does it, but I am hosting streama remotely and 1080p works great, in my case it depends on my local download and the upload capacity of the server. But again, not sure how DLNA does it. \n. interesting! not quite sure if this maybe calls for a seperate branch of the application, or what do you think? Do you mean like a self-hosted spotify?\n. Yep, I agree with @jdollar. This seems to be JAVA_HOME path related. make sure not have it pointing to your JRE folder, and instead point it to your JDK folder. Also, keep in mind that after you change this, you need to open a new command prompt to run the app, otherwise the path may not update correctly. \n. Reopen if the problem persists.\n. Thanks for the good use-case! Didn't even come to my mind :) I will add this functionality soon! \n. Ok, I've added basic functionality for this now. When creating a new show, there is now a button \"add manually\", which will switch to a manual input form. Once created, a custom poster image can be uploaded and episodes can be added manually. Please let me know if this works for you guys and if you wish for any further enhancements to this feature. \n. please reopen if anything is still missing\n. Is this something that you would like for each of your users to choose, or do you want to do it globally? As in: your streama is in Portuguese. Or do you wish that each user can choose between different languages in his/her settings page?\n. Best would be h264 with AAC audio encoding. Thats what I always use, and it works great! WebM works great too, though I have not used it yet. And for firefox, you want ogg theora. \n. This should not be happening if you chose AAC and h264. Did you use the command line or handbrake GUI? AAC and h264 works for chrome.\n. Sorry for the late reply: I would love to enhance the documentation to include any slip-ups that users might have! I believe that this project and it's documentation should guide the user through the setup as good as possible. Thank you for your patience with the setup and thanks to everyone who helped with the issue! I will try to find the time to include this issue in the documentation, or you could do a pull request and include it that way (does that work with the wiki-pages?). \n. In your console I can see that the application is actually but running properly, you can see that there are errors and that the driver for the db connection exited with errors. To help you debug a full stacktrace is required.\n. Is this issue still open? \n. Reopen if the problem persists.\n. Yeah, a good point. I'll think about it\n. Cool! Will work on that then :)\n. I'm glad!\n. ok thats a cool idea! \n. Hm... I have never seen an error like this before. \nHow did you install grails? How are you running streama? with run-app or through tomcat? What version ubuntu are you running? or is a local machine? What version of java are you using? Try to give me as much information like that as possible, that way we can narrow it down (maybe).\nRegarding your question: I have no estimate currently... I've looked into both, and the file crawler is higher on my list than media conversion. The problem with media conversion is the fact that it has to happen async, and that I have to queue the files, otherwise it is too much load on any server.. Video conversion is quite heavy for any server, really. So I am still working on a plan for that. But of course I hope that I will get all of this into streama soon-ish! but it is very unlikely that that will happen before xmas this year. \n. @PhilW86, does the suggestion by @gkiko help? \n. Reopen if the problem persists.\n. Wow .. that looks pretty bad! how many episodes do you have for that show? It shouldnt be 200mb at least.. I've looked into performance there already, and I will do more, but that seems more like a bug than anything else. Does this happen with any other show? Is there anything specific for that show that is worth mentioning and might bring me closer to a bugfix? \n. Should be fixed! please let me know\n. That is currently not possible, but a good idea! I will add that to my feature list. \n. Is this potentially fixed with \"Add non-themoviedb shows #91\"? \n. all right! \n. First draft for this feature is in, committet to the \"beta\" branch. If you wanna test it out. \n. Could you paste a more complete stacktrace? For example via http://pastebin.com/\n. oh, are you running it as docker? I'm not sure if that works yet... got a lot of feedback that it may not work yet... and the co-dev who implemented docker has not been active again. \n. Reopen if the problem persists.\n. Hi! Have you taken a look at this? http://askubuntu.com/questions/487374/how-to-install-tomcat7-in-ubuntu-14-04-lts Maybe it helps... \n. But I've never had the issue you describe with simply installing tomcat through apt-get\n. This command may fix it: sudo apt-get install libtomcat7-java\n. can you walk me through your setup steps? Was it a completely clean Ubuntu when you started (something you get from aws or digitalocean) or was there stuff installed already? If so, what? \n. Reopen if the problem persists.\n. Hi!\nthis is currently a common issue because video conversion is still in development. please refer to this https://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/Video-Codecs-&-Conversion\n. did you try the little trick with the browser tab as described in the above link?\n. @gkiko, I doubt the grails version has anything to do with it.. I mean, if he got as far as uploading and viewing the file.. \nthe error occurs when the HTML5 video player can, for any reason, not play the video. that's why dragging the file in a new browser tab shows if it's a codec issue. also: my script only works for Chrome! not Firefox or any other browser. \n. can you open f12 (chrome debugger) and check if there are any console errors when opening the video?\n. Also, do you have a way to give us temporary access to the websites? Maybe by creating a user and later remove it again.. That way I could try to debug \n. Would your be willing to do a screen share session, for instance via hangout so that's I can try and debug together with you?\n. I might have reproduced the issue locally. It seems to have to do with large files, 1gb and above. I'll look into it and report back. \n. let me know if version 0.1.7.1 doesnt fix it\n. Did you make sure to include the https to your base path in your settings? Can you paste the url of a working page and the invite url ?\n. on your installation, go to Admin -> Settings. For me thats \nlocalhost:8080/streama/#/admin/settings\n. don't worry! did it fix the issue?\n. Closing until further notice\n. Sounds great! I will implement it :) \n. Oh good ticket! I will fix it asap :) \n. Oh that's strange! There seems to be a server error of some kind. Are there any server errors in the server log?\n. So sometimes the video loads and sometimes it doesnt? \n. A login wouldnt hurt to debug. maybe you can pm me via gitter (see project readme)\n. Hi! I just debugged your page with the login you PMed me, and for me the video plays in the player... Weird! I use chrome on my laptop (OSX) to play the video. What do you use? \n. i tried looking at the file on your server again but i guess you revoked the rights. Thats alright! but can you let me know if you uploaded a firefox friendly video with the right encoding? For reference https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/html5-audio-and-video-firefox\n. Yea ok, this is something Ive been struggling with a lot.. \nI will try around as soon as i can and get back to you.\n. So for anyone who is interested: \nEvery bit of research that I can find tells me, that the 2 main causes of this problem are (1) the server doesnt accept range headers and/or (2) the server doesnt send a proper mime type (content-type header) back. Now in my case, both of those things seem 100% correct, also if I compare to a video hosted by apache I can't spot any differences. \nthese are the headers from streama \n\nthese are the headers from apache \n\nany help is appreciated.. this is totally mind gobbling... \n. thanks   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0@lclc98 . hmm... the reason why this is set to something arbitrary is that this value is actually not used anywhere. Instead, the value added in the application settings is used. Or what is your intention behind changing this path?\n. OK sure :) \n. ok this is strange! I will clean up the code a bit to remove some of these compressions (as not all are needed) and then ill let you know!\n. Please check out the new grails3 releases. You can revert pretty far back without any major implications for the database. But it depends, how far back do you want to go? \n. the error getOutputStream() has already been called and the stacktrace that follows it is a known issue that does not have any implications on the application. So that one can be ignored. The connection reset one might have an impact though. \nYou gotta configure the tomcat to something like this: \nJAVA_OPTS=\"-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC\"\nor -Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m if your server hardware can handle it. just make sure to also up the permSize when playing around with these values. \n. oh! i know! \nif(file.extension == \".mp4\" || file.extension == \".mkv\" || file.extension == \".webm\" || file.extension == \".ogg\")\nits probably that line! what extension do your movies have?\n. Yep sure, that's optimization down the line, but I think for now it's just that he has an extension that isn't part of the list, ie that I overlooked \n. no i know, but i just added that quickly the other day because of the implementation of image upload. just didnt focus on it. good feedback though, when i find out what extension this user was using i will make a list out of it. \n. Ok! Will add m4v to the list and optimize the statement as suggested above. Sorry for the inconvenience!\n. awesome thanks!\n. I'm glad!\n. Cool! Will add it asap\n. Unfortunately, I don't want to get involved in torrenting and the like. For that reason I will not be implementing that feature at this point. However, I see that there is a need for this so I will soon be programming a file-crawler. With that, you will be able to aquire the video files any way you wish and place them in a particular folder and the application will automatically generate the movies and shows based on those files. \n.

Will that be satisfactory?\n. Ok wow, never thought about that! That requires a lot of changes as it's hooked into everything but I'll see what I can do! \n. Thank you for this! Very useful and good for the overall quality of the application!\n. Hi and thanks for the pull request!\nI like the changes you made very much, but I'm worried that the code as getting a little bloated now. I would prefer if all the mousetrap changes were extracted into an angular service instead. \nAlso, code like angular.element('#playerVolumeSlider .ui-slider-handle').blur(); should not be used and instead a more 'angular-y' way should be found. \nHowever, I'll accept the request and fix the above at a later point, or if you fix it in another pull request. Doesn't matter.\n. fixed the second part\n. Do you really mean that you should be able to delete movies from right inside of the dashboard? or do you mean the modal-popup in the dashboard?\n. Phew it's some time ago now. I'll look into the code and get  back to you . Huh? Isn't it the same pop-up? It's the manage files pop-up in movies... \n. Ah smart!\n. I'm not sure I agree 100%. What if the user wants to upload subtitles right when the video is done uploading?\n. Currently, the recommended movies dont show up at all. But I agree that this would be a useful enhancement. \n. fixed in v1.1. it actually works like this: \nif you got a season of a currently-running show, and themoviedb only has half of the season when you fetch it the first time, refetching it will fetch all the new episodes that were added since last time. And this behaviour works for me. Doesnt it for you? \n. I agree that the refetch should update episodes, too. I was a bit iffy about that at first because that might override custom episode data, but I think I can find a way around that somehow. But exactly how do you mean refetch deleted episodes? You have manually deleted some episode from a season and refetch won't add it again? I would expect that to work, so if it doesn't I'll look into it. \nI like your ideas for notifications and will implement them :)\n. I guess in the method where I check which episodes need to be fetched and which ones already are there I don't check for the deleted flag. Should be an easy fix. I'll look into it soon \n. Fixed\n. What exactly did you try to do? \n. Thank you for your kind and thoughtful feedback! I will improve the above asap :)\n. fixed :)\n. Hi, \n1. The reason why there is no registration is because it is invite-only at the moment. That is there to ensure maximum control over the (possibly copyright) content. Do you suggest that there should be a functionality whereby anyone can freely register? \n2. Subtitle-selector - do you mean when there are multiple subtitle files associated with one video? \n3. What do you mean  by subscription? As in payment-based user subscriptions? \n. See this issue for subscriptions https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/602. As it is right now, I will not be accepting this pull request into the master branch. I've written detailed comments above. Please resolve theses issues and submit again. \n. Hi!\nI know what the issue is and I will fix it asap tomorrow morning CET. Sorry for the inconvenience!\n. Ok it should be fixed now! Again, sorry for the inconvenience\n. Yea I've noticed this too, it started with the feature to click for play/pause. I'll look into it. Until then, if you don't care too much about the click feature I think by disabling it in your user profile the cursor should hide again. But either way I'll look into fixing it asap.\n. fixed it now!\n. Hi and thanks for your feedback! \n1. for me it updates. (See low quality gif: http://www.gfycat.com/QuestionableEasygoingAxolotl) How exactly have you noticed the issue?\n2. Yea thats default html5 video subtitle behavior. In a future update i plan to use srt and generate the subtitle output with code instead of relying on html5 subtitles. Then Ill be able to give it custom design, too. \n3. A lot of people have asked for this and it is definitely a top prio enhancement!\n. So wait, you created a movie via add manually and that breaks everything? In that case I have to check that out asap!\n. Should be fixed now!\n. Now it shouldn't be possible to create them without a name anymore \n. The request is ALMOST accepted, except for the potential breaking behaviour. I will make the necessary changes and commit it. Thanks!\n. have you checked the spam account?\n. Only via code at the moment, But this is a good feature to include in a future commit. \nUserController.groovy line 95 - 99\nedit: in order to add a from address here, just add it as from youremail@gmail.com\nmailService.sendMail {\n   to \"fred@g2one.com\"\n   from \"john@g2one.com\"\n   subject \"Hello John\"\n   body(view: \"/mail/userInvite\", model: [user: userInstance])\n}\n. But wait, I'm not sure if the file manager I implemented does what you want it to do...\n. Nope, not yet \n. Hi! \nThis is a problem with your mysql. It seems that you used the wrong credentials? By Default, the application asks for a mysql connection on localhost with username \"root\" and no password. What do you have? \n. I can send you my config file but it depends so heavily on your system setup that I'm not sure what good that will do.\nCan you please send a screenshot that shows your database setup, either from phpmyadmin, the console or some other means of visualizing your databases?\n. Ok thanks, I see that everything seems in order. If you look at the tables of the streama database, have any tables been created or is it empty?\n. Can you temporarily try to remove the password from the database? I suspect that the changes to the config file didn't work. \n. Well my datasource is this one: https://github.com/dularion/streama/blob/master/grails-app/conf/DataSource.groovy\n. How did you edit the datasource in the first place? \n. No, the h2.Driver is the wrong one. \nIt is this one that is used for you when running via run-war: \nproduction {\n    dataSource {\n      dbCreate = \"update\"\n      driverClassName = \"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\"\n      dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect\n      url = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/streama\"\n      username = \"root\"\n      password = \"\"\nNote the production closure. If you want to edit one, it is this one. \nAnd you do not need to download any .jar, it is all part of the package. \n. https://github.com/dularion/streama/blob/master/grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy\nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/blob/master/grails-app/conf/Config.groovy\nIf you suspect it's the slf4j maybe look here \nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/102\nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/13\n. Oh really? Damn. Will look into that asap \n. Partially fixed with latest commit \n. Fixed the message in the bottom right. But I can't reproduce the logout issue. It works for me. Can you check to make sure your base path is correct? \n. Pls reopen if problem persist in latest release . Not currently, no. Video ads you mean? For monetization purposes?\n. Ok that makes sense. But would you then need a system where views of the ads are tracked and counted somehow? And would you need different ads per content manager so that each can manage their own ads? And would they be displayed at random or do you need to decide which video gets which ad? And is an ad before playback enough or do you need to interrupt longer videos for ads as well? Basically: describe exactly what you need and I'll see what I can do. \n@gkiko, of course this is optional, so if no ads are configured the application would be ad free \n. Yes, you are totally right! I'll fix it asap \n. Hi! \nthis seems to be an issue with your mysql server somehow. check out this message in your stacktrace: \n\ncom.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: The last packet successfully received from the server was 42,218,935 milliseconds ago. The last packet sent successfully to the server was 42,218,935 milliseconds ago. is longer than the server configured value of 'wait_timeout'. You should consider either expiring and/or testing connection validity before use in your application, increasing the server configured values for client timeouts, or using the Connector/J connection property 'autoReconnect=true' to avoid this problem.\n\nmaybe \"autoReconnect=true\" works for you?\nI personally have a long-running instance of streama that has been running for approx 12 weeks without restart, and I don't have that issue... \nBtw, there should be no issue regarding oracleJDK or openjdk. I personally use openjdk. \nEDIT: I am now seeing that the grails production datasource has a validityQuery that it runs ever 15000 ms. see this block: \njmxEnabled = true\n initialSize = 5\n maxActive = 50\n minIdle = 5\n maxIdle = 25\n maxWait = 10000\n maxAge = 10 * 60000\n timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis = 5000\n minEvictableIdleTimeMillis = 60000\n validationQuery = \"SELECT 1\"\n validationQueryTimeout = 3\n validationInterval = 15000\n testOnBorrow = true\n testWhileIdle = true\n testOnReturn = false\n jdbcInterceptors = \"ConnectionState\"\n defaultTransactionIsolation = java.sql.Connection.TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED\nbut this only gets executed if you actually run the application in production mode. Did you make sure to run as run-war, not run-app? or even better: deploy to tomcat?\n. Are you running it via tomcat? if so, is the tomcat running under http://your-remote-server:8080? easy check is if http://your-remote-server:8080/manager leads you to your manager app. \nIf you are running with tomcat: do you have a ROOT.war in the webapps folder and did it auto-create the ROOT/ folder next to it? \n. Please post your stacktrace via http://pastebin.com/\n. would you mind trying out the new simpler setup with grails 3 ? just to see if that works for you ? https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.0.0\n. Are you using windows? Looks like the wrong java version. make sure your java version is 1.7 or higher. Check using java -version \n. Ah damn, was hoping for a straight forward solution :/ I'll have to try to recreate the issue on a remote server then. Will get to that soon ish and get back to you. \n. Would you mind trying out the new grails3 beta? \n. Unfortunately that isn't enough of a stacktrace.. Can you run it again with the flags --stacktrace --verbose and paste the resulting stacktrace in a pastebin? \n. From your logs it seems that hibernate has a problem creating the tables in the database. \nCan you check the following:\n1. Is mysql running?\n2. Are the login credentials correct? Default user root, no password\n3. If you didn't use root user, make sure that mysql user has writing privileges to the streama db \n4. Make sure the mysql db is created for localhost, not localhost IP or similar\nLet me know if any of that helps you \n. Oh boy.. It might very well be MariaDB. Never tried it with that. \nWhat do you mean by your last question?\n. What / means, it that the application will run on server root, meaning yourIpAddress:8080 . If it wouldnt run on root, it would be something like yourIpAddres:8080/streama. This depends on the name the .war file has in your tomcat webapps folder. \nHow exactly are you deploying streama? are you loading the war into the manager gui? \n. Can you check which tables have been created by the application? Maybe drop the streama database and recreate it and restart the application... \n. Can you tell me which steps you took to set it up?\n. would you mind trying out the new simpler setup with grails 3 ? just to see if that works for you ? https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.0.0\n. Ok so regarding the first thing, that's a bug! Thank you! I will look into that asap. But I'm a little strapped for time so might not get to it too soon \n. Regarding your second point, it depends on what you want to change.. The logo can be exchanged in the Index.gsp and color changes and other customizations require css knowledge. As the project used SCSS you might need to add that. I can in the future add a way to change branding and add custom CSS in the settings but right now you need to know some stuff to do it :( \n. It's best to leave it open for me, so I remember to do it ;) \n. Hi! Thanks for the offer. This is my Transaction Addresses: 17rCUEX6KYQ8ZM4w39ttEUL7SUDnGCpcWq\n. Thank you ! Ill get on it asap :) \n. Should work properly now! Let me know if it doesn't \n. Are you sure you pulled & restarted the application? I created the scenario as you described, created a user without any rights, had the same error and fixed the error for me. \n. This commit took care of it: https://github.com/dularion/streama/commit/01ece81bd6e152a0d574ad02969580450fa9193f\n. Do you mean you want a redirect in place for www to non-www? You can do that with an nginx or Apache hooked infront of the tomcat. Or what do you mean? You need the base url because with it the link in the email and some other stuff is created...\n. thanks for your contribution !\n. Looking good, thank you for your contribution!\n. Thank you for your contribution!\n. Oh yeah, you're absolutely right, no query to themoviedb should be made. In all honesty, I never intended for that feature to be used when no moviedb api key is added at all. I'll try to take a look at it soon, or have you done anything here already @gikko?\n. fixed in https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v0.3.2\n. Oh, the file manager is only meant for subtitles and video files. For a poster image there is a different functionality that is not yet implemented for regular videos. By adding generic videos you can see how this feature works. I could implement that for shows and movies too, if there is no poster image. Just let me know if that is what you're looking for. \n. Okay! I'll get on that then :) \n. Btw, do I understand correctly, you want this for each individual episode?\n. Thank you for your contribution!\n. fixed in branch Next. will soon be merged to master\n. good point! \n. Fixed with PR https://github.com/dularion/streama/pull/233. Oh sorry, this is something that I'll have to adjust in the docs! Thanks @z3ntu\n. What's your stacktrace?\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn 21 May 2016, at 03:33, eGolono notifications@github.com wrote:\nThanks for the quick response! I managed to get to the last few steps but unfortunately I'm only getting a blank screen after starting tomcat up. I did receive the INFORMATION: Server startup in X ms message .\nInitially, I realized that I forgot to add the password of the root account of mysql to the DataSource.groovy file. I went through the file and filled in the password in the two sections that mentioned mysql and its root account.\nI restarted the server and tried again but the blank page remains the same. After looking through the issues, I also tried adding /streama to the end of the URL but to no avail.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n. would you mind trying out the new simpler setup with grails 3 ? just to see if that works for you ? https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.0.0\n. That should be fine for now. If you're running into issues, however, then I can tinker around with a plugin that I found that wraps the war so that it can be run as a standalone service. The approach you're suggesting is yet untested with this version of the app. So you're my first beta tester for that \u263a\ufe0f\n. Yea, after you invite them, in the list of users, there is the unique link for them to use to set their password. You can just link that to them :)\n. Did you enable the users? (There's a checkbox)\n. Hm, this may be a grails 3 bug. I'll look into it and get back to you \n. fixed with release 1.0.1 \nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.0.1\n. For any future issues with this version, please create new issues :) \n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. What exactly do you mean by that? Did you change the base path in the settings? \n. It sounds like something is wrong with the settings. What is the error message that you see when you try to view it via url? \n. Can you open the developer console (f12) and try again and make a screenshot of the error message? Alternatively grant me temporary access to your installation \n. Thank you! Can you check if get any output in the server log?\n. You're welcome to try the BETA build with grails3\n. Thanks for your PR! \n. Thank you! \n. oh, good point! \n. I'd appreciate a PR for this :) \n. It would be optional with 1.0.11 . No plugin planned for now, but definitely something for the list! Until further notice you can mount your s3 with Ubuntu and then just reference the mounting path in the streama settings. \nRegarding port : I haven't tried this and I'm not at my pc right now, but try if adding SERVER_PORT=80 before or after the environment setting works for you. \n. Please reopen if this option doesnt work for you for some reason. \n. Yea, audio works great on mkv files, but unfortunately most times you only find mkv with ac2 audio encoding, which doesn't work in browsers. Make sure you use mkvs with aac audio encoding or use a program like handbrake to convert them.\n. fixed in branch Next, will soon be merged into master. \n. Thank you for wanting to contribute! \nFirst of all you'll need to make a fork. Then, in your forked version you need to make a copy of the file grails-app/assets/javascripts/translations/EN_us.js In the same directory and call it PT_br.js. Make all necessary translations there. \nIn line 5 of that file make sure to call the translation pt.\nThen head on over to /grails-app/assets/javascripts/translations/streama.translations.js and add the string 'pt' to the available languages array. \nIn the user profile it should now show up as selectable from a dropdown list. Choose it and test! If you find any parts that still need translating let me know. I chose to limit translations only to the Frontend of the application for now, the admin area is English. \nFinally, make a pull request so I can add it to master. \n. I've added a comprehensive Guide. I will link to it from the readme. thanks! \nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/Translating-the-app\n. Yeah I've been thinking about that too. While the video is loading, right?\n. Cool! Don't forget to PR :)\n. Possibly.. Can you post the stacktrace? If it's long use paste bin plz \n. This is a different issue. I had the same issue when running it from a different folder than where the .war file resides. But from your pastebin I can see that you do run it from the same directory. \nWhich Java version are you using? \nPlease use the other issue for continued communication on this\n. Thanks mate!\n. Yea I know why, it's because it's running the tests as though it's a grails 2 project. \n./grailsw: No such file or directory\n\nNot sure how to tell it to treat one branch differently ... Feel free to investigate!\n. Oh right!! True \ud83d\ude05 if you want you can try to adjust it \n. Thanks! Much obliged \n. Thanks for testing!\nI'll look into the first point, but regarding the second I need more information ... Don't show where? Do you have a log? What exactly is and isn't happening? Did you use the no-mysql environment or mysql? \n. awww.. what youre describing is a feature that isnt yet implemented :( I will try to get around to that soon, though... \n. hi, please try release 1.0.2! \nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.0.2\n. oh youre absolutely right. let me fix that real quick\n. updated the broken v1.0.2 now. sorry !\n. hm, weird! I'm not getting this.. ill try to deploy with h2 and see if that makes any difference... \n. that would be nice, yea! \n. you can PM me on gitter if you want\n. actually, i could reproduce using the .war, so no need for access!\n. all right, please try v1.0.3\nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/releases\n. argh... \n. i gotta check it out later then, gotta run\n. fixed!\n. Wow thank you!\nI'll be checking this out later and take a look at it locally before I merge but great work!!\n. I've played around with it a bit now and am suggesting a few tweaks:\n- as long as the setting for local video directory isn't filled in the tab should either not show up in the manage file modal or a little notice should be displayed for the users with a link to the settings page. \n- when choosing a file, the name is the entire file path. I'd split by / and only use the last item, or maybe easier with Java io file, use the file name only. \n- removing the file from the episode / movie actually deletes it from hard-drive. I think that functionality makes sense with uploaded files, but in the case of this feature I'd stop at removing it from db. \nEither I can fix these issues or you, you choose :) but I probably won't get to it soon as I'm swamped right now. \nGreat work!!! Thanks for your contribution! \n. Youre a machine!! \ud83d\udc4d \n. I had the same issue when running it from a different folder than where the .war file resides. But from your pastebin I can see that you do run it from the same directory. \nWhich Java version are you using? \n. Do you see anything in your stacktrace or browser console? \n. hopefully this fixes it https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.0.5\n. fixed in  v1.0.6\n. Oh sorry, referenced the wrong issue in the release. Will look into it soon!\n. hopefully this fixes it: https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.0.5\n. You mean per user per video? \n. Nothing like that implemented yet and not currently part of the roadmap but an interesting feature to keep in mind for future releases for sure. Shouldn't be too hard to implement either, depending on the level of granularity, eg what can be restricted? By Video Id? Genre? Tags? Does that mean you will want a role management system too? Or will there be a selection for 'available for roles...' In each video? Once that kind of stuff is decided this can be turned into a full fledged concept that could be implemented.\n. @lupoalberto12  the suggestion you posted has been implemented in version 1.6.0-RC10 using the profiles. check it out! . Im looking into that now. Will find out more soon. \n. fixed in  v1.0.6\n. Thanks, will look into it asap \n. fixed in  v1.0.6\n. True! Its not on the top of the list, but definitely a todo down the road. Thanks!. Cool! I can totally check that out when I get a chance. Alternatively I'd appreciate a pull request for an implementation of this :)\n. Smart! Will look into implementing this\n. Will be in v1.6.0. see https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.6.0-RC1. Ill look into it soon, I think I know what might be the cause \n. Unfortunately this is truly the case for any ios device, and I can't figure it out. I've tested the same video file served through Apache and served through grails3 and it works on Apache and not through grails. I've compared all the http headers and can't see any difference. I'm a bit stuck... Any help would be greatly appreciated!. thanks @lclc98 . This is not high on my todo list, because this only applies to non-api episodes, but I'd accept a pull request on this issue!. Hi! Yes is this something that has also come to my attention. However, it requires disabling the current authentication system and using an ajax only endpoint. This is definitely part of the roadmap, but until then, I am not sure there is a hotfix. . See this issue for subscriptions #602. Hi Phil!\nThanks for your kind words :) \nAbout the audio stream, that's something that I definitely want for the application too! Big Apparently there is support for multiple audioTracks for html5 videos, however, I haven't tested it yet... http://gingertech.net/2011/05/01/html5-multi-track-audio-or-video/\nIf it's as easy as described in the link then it should be a quick addon. It just needs a bit of angular logic to display the tracks in a menu and then disable/enable on click \n. For angularJS, check out the official angularJS homepage. they have a nice interactive tutorial. Alternatively, a guy called egghead makes amazing tutorials for AngularJS. Note that this project still uses angular 1, not 2. \nFor Grails, there is no tutorial that really goes through everything in this project, which is unfortunate. although the grails docs are pretty great. maybe they got some youtube vids too. When i got more time, I'll definitely create a learning tutorial series for grails and angular. \n. Hm.. so in 2013 some time development into the above solution stopped, so it was never implemented in Chrome it seems. So the way to do it would be to add audio tracks as mp3 and allow language switching that way. I guess that makes most sense, also it facilitates manually correcting audio sync issues. What do you think? . Yep this is indeed related to #272. I think we should try to first see if we can sync it with uploaded mp3s and then if that works reliably we can use a third party tool to extract the audio tracks. . That's awesome! Let me know if I can help . This topic is definitely on our radar still, we are just trying to figure out how to best do this. Subtitle extraction as suggested by @Albatrosicks  is also a good idea!. An LDAP integration would not be so difficult. Who else thinks this is an important feature? . Hi! \nnow with the executable war, you can just add the application as a service to systemctl. then, just rsync the file to your server, and restart the service. Example: \n```bash\n/etc/systemd/system/streama.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=streama\nAfter=syslog.target\n[Service]\nUser=streama\nExecStart=/data/streama/streama-0.1.war\nSuccessExitStatus=143\nConditionPathExists=/data/streama/streama-0.1.war\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nbash\njenkins\n./gradlew assemble\nssh user@yourserver.com 'sudo systemctl stop streama.service'\nrsync -vhP build/libs/workspace-0.1.war user@yourserver.com:/data/streama/streama-0.1.war\nssh user@yourserver.com 'sudo systemctl start streama.service'\n```\n. Hi! Thanks for these bug reports, I'll take a look :) \n. So i fixed it all except the Movie Internal Server Error bug and the password page. For the movie bug: I cant recreate it unfortunately. \nSteps I tried: \n- create movie\n- attach video file by drag and drop\n- reload page\nin that moment, I can still load the page no problem. Could you describe the steps to reproduce this? \n. https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.0.7. If we are talking about the v1.x then you need to use application.yml alongside the war file. See instructions here https://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/BETA---Grails-3\nYou can try this setting: \nyml\nenvironments:\n   production:\n      server:\n          port: 80. should be!. except: ymls are sensitive to tabs, so mind that you use the right format. Thank you for your generous contribution!! . Is this a duplicate of https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/66?. try again with 1.0.8 please and report back.. Hi, Unfortunately there is nothing like this at this point. I started in apiary but never get far enough to make it public. Any contribution on this part is appreciated :) . Can you try with v1.0.8?\nreopen pls if the problem persists. why not try 1.0.8?\n. setup is much easier. see here https://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/BETA--Streama-v1. Sure, but what do you connect them with? For this we need an auto-detect feature like in xbmc. But I think I have an idea... What if, via a file browser, could select something like 'scan this folder for naming patterns' and then it uses several regex patterns to fetch name / season number / episode number from the file names and then, in a modal dialog, displays the possible results and by confirming the modal you batch create all the matched meta data as well as attach all the files respectively...?. theres something like this under development. check https://github.com/dularion/streama/tree/v1.1_bulk_create. I am finally done! phew --- added the PR: https://github.com/dularion/streama/pull/425. Thank you so much! I've added it to the grails3 branch as well . This sounds pretty bad. Let me try to reproduce and get back to you. In the meantime, can anyone else confirm this?. Thank you for this, makes perfect sense! \nI'll add this asap :) . fixed in https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.0.9_1. yup sure :) \nthanks!. Manually merged! \nThank you for the contribution! \nOne note though, I am not sure I like the word \"Tafelansicht\", cant think of anything better either at the moment though. . Since these are many small changes, I'd appreciate another PR for this. Thanks for your help on this! Please be mindful to do a fresh fork or pull from the current status of the grails3 branch. Love the enthusiasm! :) . please try installing with https://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/Getting-started-with-v1 and reopen this if the problem persists. if so, please provide installation details, like jdk version, ubuntu version etc. . Oops. Will take a look later . Uploading fix in new release now\n. https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.0.9\n. hm something is still not right. will investigate further when i find the time. in the meantime, ill take v1.0.8 and 1.0.9 back offline. Try again now :) . The 1.0.8 is stable again I believe . please try https://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/Getting-started-with-v1 and reopen if it doesnt work . Yup! . This is interesting, would this be hosted on some transifex server then?. I'm not sure about the dockerfile as it was contributed from other devs, but have you tried executing the current 1.0.8? see https://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/Getting-started-with-v1. Thank you!. Hm this works for me, running by execution with openjdk8. \ncan you tell me what the output of the browser and server log are? also, is it maybe a permission issue? please go back into the settings and re-validate the local file directory. . That's not the error. Hm something is quite strange. Any way you could give me access to the application so I can debug?. Are you using admin or another user?. The server logs are below the output you sent me, the part about the application running. If there is nothing there, then it isn't an error, but something ujintentislly wrong in a piece of code. Only, I don't have the issue and I just deployed it last night with the current 1.0.8 . Could you look me up on gitter? We could chat about the issue . Great issue, with a gif and everything! fix included in next build :). I've noticed this too. This is already happening on restart of the app, in the Bootstrap.groovy but I agree that it should happen when adding movies and shows . Oh wait, I am not sure I am following. I thought you were talking about something else. How do you mean, parse? As in, it should appear for search results? . It is... I'll have to debug further . Sorry, not yet. but will get to it soon. Wonderful, thanks!\n. Thanks! \nFixed in upcoming v1.0.12. Hi, thanks for your feedback. Which browser and operating system is this?. thanks @ddannewitz . I think thats interesting, however, I think some ppl use this \"lack of security\" as a feature, to share admin logins etc. How do you and others feel about that? . issue #212  just addresses logging of user activity, but I agree that this could be interesting. maybe in conjuction with subscriptions and plans? #602 . Hi! \nCheck out this issue: https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/241. You're welcome to add what you've written here to the other issue . Hm, it works for me. Can you check the network tab in the console and see if something gets suppressed that looks like youtube? also,  is it for all movies or only this particular one? . Chrome developer tools (f12) and then among other tabs there's one called network. Keep it open and reload the page and see if you can see anything relating to YouTube (you can also search through all the requests). Also check the console in general for Javascript errors . Hm, I cannot reproduce this issue for the life of me :( any way you could give me temporary streama-content-manager access to this? \nEdit: if so, PM me on gitter. Unfortunately I still cannot reproduce is. Is anyone else experiencing this? \nI will close this issue until either you or someone else can help me track down this behaviour. What's ggts? Best is to use intellij IDEA and open the build.gradle file in the directory. That way you initialize everything with gradle. Then, on the right, in the list of gradle tasks you gotta choose application > build app (not 100% sure about the last step, will supply Screenshots shortly). Hi! Ive made a tutorial on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn9grcWbBFM&t=11s. Thank you for your post. There is already an open issue for this here https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/225 \nCan you please add your use case to that issue? Then I will close this as a duplicate . Agreed! See https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/241. I like it, branding, right?. I cannot reproduce this issue, can you tell me a bit more about it? How did you get it? what were you doing? which version did you use? which browser? . Closing for now, I think it might be resolved in one of the newer builds. please reopen if problem persists. Hi! \nThis is an interesting issue and a very clever solution. I've always set up streama on a remote server so I've never run into this problem, but I like your use case, it seems a logical one for the application, and so I'll do my best to come up with a solution. \nI think, maybe the whole idea of the base path is faulty. If you can access the application, then that is your base path right there. So it should be variable. It's a long time ago now so I don't remember why it was necessary for the video playback, but I'll look into it and let you know :) . Hi could you record a video/gif that shows this? . So in the 1.6.0 release, I've added support for this. I made it optional though, so the site-admin can choose whether or not the download button shows up. In the future I intend to group some of the player options together, but for now it works like this: \nIn the admin panel\n\nin the player\n\n. its up :) https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/releases/tag/v1.6.0-RC3\nfeel free to test it out and give me feedback if anything seems off . thank you :) ! . sounds good, lets reopen . Ok so ive added functionality that the downloaded file gets the original file name stored in the DB. this is done as per https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_download.asp. Hwoever, afaik this doesnt have full browser support. But let me know how it feels. you can test it out here https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/releases/tag/v1.6.0-RC4. \nBeware however that another change in the RC4 might break some stuff. Feel free to report any bugs you find on that front, I always appreciate when others help me test :) . Thanks mate :) . Hm, what collation does your database have?. There is a pre-release, if you want to test it . Oh good catch!. Added in the v1.0.20 prerelease. have you checked the sendmail logs? \n. Thanks! You are welcome to add it to the wiki of this project, that way it lasts longer than through an issue! . For the others, could you split this up into separate issues? These bulk issues are sort of hard to work off of and check for completion. . closed for duplication. report back if it doesnt work! . OMG that is fantastic!!!! thank you so much ! <3 . I think it may be fixed now, I had a similar exception. Please check again with v1.0.13. That isnt programmed currently, simply because of potential copyright issues. If people could just sign up and access your content, cant that get you in trouble? better to do invite-only. . Agreed!. What do you mean by \"default link\"? . I'm not sure I am following you.. can you give me an example with example urls just to clarify your issue?. will check it out\n. I can't reproduce this problem... The file manager works for me. Can you give me access to your installation so i can debug? . the issue is, as @gikko states, the heap space. Please view this guide for further reading: https://plumbr.eu/outofmemoryerror/java-heap-space\n. I totally agree with the above! Im also interested in developing a feature similar to steam, like \"invite to join\" and \"jump into game with..\" but with videos :) This is definitely part of the roadmap!. ah nothing at all. thanks so much! \n. Thanks mate!\n. Please reopen if there are any more questions/suggestions. True .. This is something I am still figuring out. Basically I need to redesign the session-ID handling, because currently the session is connected to the one movie/Episode only. But Seeing as I want a bigger friendship thing (see https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/304). Ill extract the last bit of your description as a separate issue. Yea, not sure what you mean @derbismarck . I think thats a cute idea, but nothing of immediate importance unless more people chime in. But anyone who would like to contribute this, feel free! . yes agreed! this is an oversight on my part . Fixed in the v2 rc, will cherry pick into the stable version soon and update!. Fixed in v1.0.14. tried to fix again in v1.0.15\n. cant reproduce any of this locally, so Im digging in the blind. will post another attempt to fix soon\n. lets see with v1.0.16 first, releasing now. :) \n. Hm this has nothing to do with the file type, the error lies somewhere else. What is the entire stacktrace? Please dont paste it directly here but instead use http://pastebin.ca/. Do you have a mail server configured?. something like postfix: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-setup-postfix-on-ubuntu-14-04. Fixed in v1.0.14. tried to fix it again. sorry. please post any further bugs with this here https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/311\n. v1.0.15\n. well I think when the Episode browser is open, the volume change logic should be disabled . Sure :) . will attempt to fix this, please let me know if it worked for you. closing in favor of  #321. closing in favor of  #321. Actually, its a mistake in the code, but I can make it optional through settings :) but first, i gotta fix the bug that causes this ;) . will have to check it out. thanks for reporting. \ud83d\udc4d \nwill fix in next release. There is a pre-release, if you want to test it . hm, I think the 1.0.17 release was an old version somehow. please try again, i reuploaded the .war\n. I think maybe because you had the broken .war in between, your uploaded logo is missing the IsPublic flag. Could you check in the database, in the table \"file\" if the requested image has the boolean isPublic set to true? alternatively, reupload the image. . is there any way I could look at the project? if so, PM me on gitter. So this seems to have to do with the trailing \"/\" at the end of the base url. I will look into it and publish a fix asap. There is a pre-release, if you want to test it . Can you do the typical html5-video check? see this section in the FAQs. this is an issue with the slider. It is already fixed in the current streama-video-player library and will be implemented in the main project in v2. please refer to after login bug #324. Added in the v1.0.20 prerelease. good idea :) . Added in the v1.0.20 prerelease. ok thanks, will look into it\n. Thanks!. There is a pre-release, if you want to test it . Thanks!. The path validation is fixed. For the other error, can you please send me the network request result when opening that modal? \nEdit: The server logs seem fine, those are just warnings. after the line \"Started Application ..\" there are no other logs, so its not a server error. . glad it worked now . Yes you are completely right in this. This is definitely one for the roadmap . are you building it yourself? . In order to build a proper war file you need to run \u2018gradle assemble\u2018 or if you don't have it installed then ./gradlew assemble. Oh thats very cool idea. Is it something you wish to set per movie/show or for the entire system? How does theMovieDb behave when the language is not available, do you know? does it default to english? . Which version of streama are you trying to run? Or: Did you compile it yourself? In which case, did you use gradle assemble? \nWhen you say: no console output, does the literally mean 0 output? That seems highly unlikely . Cool idea indeed. Will add it to the roadmap . Thanks for this pr, I just haven't gotten around to testing it. Might be able to do so soon. Otherwise, any of my competent co-developers wanna take a look? :) . Manually merged in v1.0.20. Thank you so much! . \ud83d\udc4d \n. closing in favor of https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/issues/678. Hi! You can enable ssl pretty easily with nginx or Apache infront. It's uncommon for an application to handle that sort of thing. There's a guide in the wiki about it too, I believe . Oh this is pretty critical. Thank you \n. so this is indeed an issue. The way I fixed it, actually, is by setting a redirect from http://somehost.domain to https://somehost.domain in nginx. That worked nicely in my case. Have you tried that? . Can I get access to your system / Setup? . So .. with access to your system, I redeployed the app using this guide and had no issues. \nFor anyone who stumbles upon this, here is what I did: \n\nive initialized a directory under /data/streama where the application.yml resides and the executable .war\nthen downloaded the application.yml and the .war and placed them there, and changed the ownership of everything to streama (you shouldnt deploy web apps as sudo, too much could go wrong)\n\nthen I installed byobu, its nice to use for running the application and also doing other stuff, unless you want to install it as a service, in which case you can follow this guide: https://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/Getting-started-with-v1#10-how-do-i-install-it-as-a-service\n\n\nthen in order to test locally, I used an ssh tunnel, like so: ssh streama@yourIP -L 8080:localhost:8080 -N which allowed me to just call http://localhost:8080/ in the browser to access\nof course, it works via http://yourIP:8080/ too. Hm, the question would then be: How does the file-browser behave? I guess it has a \"fake\" root directory, populated by all the folders that you added or something.. \nThis does not seem like a super easy feature, but definitely one for the roadmap. Until then, why not use linux linking to access files from other locations? . I agree with that. This will be added to the version shortly, as it was pointed out before. Added in the v1.0.20 prerelease. Hi! Thanks for reporting this. I am not sure I am following what you mean. What do you mean by recursive? the search-bar in the top only searched in the current directory. . Are you talking about the search input above? Do you want to be able to type something in there and it searches through the fs starting at the folder defined in the settings? This would be new functionality, but yeah, I can see the value \n.. I'll see what I can do . No you are absolutely rgiht! sorry for the confusion. Fixed in v1.0.21 now. Can you check in the v1.0.21 prerelease? . check the releases page https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases. Please reopen if problem persists. as @mongomay69 suggests, please try v1.0.21 again. Ive made some last minute adjustments to that release, as can be seen in the changelog. . This seems a very special problem. Here are a few things you can do to help: \nCheck to make sure to provide all the info listed here: \nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/How-to-report-a-bug\n\n\nAlso, does the error occur with all kinds of videos or just one / a few? \nAnd lastly, can I have either the file you are experiencing issues with or access to your system (login to streama and ssh). for credentials, you can write on gitter. . For what purpose exactly? . Ok so this feature requires a bit of work with the subtitles. Currently, the files attached to a movie or episode are split based on their extension as video files and subtitle files. Then, of all the subtitles, the first is used and immediately passed into the<video> tag. In order to have a subtitle-switcher, all subtitles should be loaded into the video and then set as active/inactive based on the selection. example: \njavascript\n<video id=\"video\" controls preload=\"metadata\">\n   <source src=\"video/sintel-short.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n   <track label=\"English\" kind=\"subtitles\" srclang=\"en\" src=\"captions/vtt/sintel-en.vtt\" default>\n   <track label=\"Deutsch\" kind=\"subtitles\" srclang=\"de\" src=\"captions/vtt/sintel-de.vtt\">\n   <track label=\"Espa\u00f1ol\" kind=\"subtitles\" srclang=\"es\" src=\"captions/vtt/sintel-es.vtt\">\n</video>\nBut for this we might need to add the label and the srclang as extra fields in theDataFile.groovy, so that they are editable. \nFinally, the video-player frontend needs to be adjusted to allow subtitle switching, currently there is just a toggle-button for on/off. \n\n Instead, the button needs to open a little popup (similar to the episode-selector)\n\nThe reason why we should add all subtitle tracks to the video is because mobile browsers use the native subtitle-picker in fullscreen mode. . fixed in v1.1. I cannot reproduce this unfortunately. How large is the file you are trying to upload? . Merged release to master. Somehow the japanese got tangled up in this PR; which is slightly confusing. But it looks good either way. Thanks! . oh no! there is not :D just a typo. Thanks mate! also for the other PRs!. @Nighoo is very right, so I cannot accept this PR. However, we can think about a second rollout for Postgresql? . you mean that you want to point to an external video file from within streama? That is already possible through the External URL feature. Or do you have something else in mind?\n\n. Thanks!. Can you post a gif or an mp4 of this behaviour? . Can reproduce! will fix in next release!. Is this fixed?  Seems to be on my end. Please reopen if im wrong. where would this setting be? globally for the admin or for each profile?. thanks!. Closed due to faulty commit (my fault). agreed! I have the situation that the mounted drive sometimes falls away and then it'd be nice if I found out about it from the users. I like the suggestions!\nAnd thanks for your kind words :) \nI like the idea of a suggestion thread, each suggestion should be its own comment then, right? otherwise voting doesnt quite work so well. You are welcome to kick one off! . Good idea! might not be so easy but I like the idea :) . Ugh.. WIll look into it. Maybe Ill remove the validation again -.-. oh .. I don't know a thing about Synology nas. Any way you can run it on a simple ubuntu / linux setup and hook in the nas as a mount or something? . Is there any way you can record this behaviour as a gif or an mp4? . Thanks for reporting this. Please refer to this issue: https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/239. Eu preciso de mais informa\u00e7\u00f5es, por favor. Que tipo de m\u00eddia \u00e9, um filme? Um v\u00eddeo gen\u00e9rico? Uma TVShow? Tamb\u00e9m, voc\u00ea adicionou manualmente ou usou o MovieDB?. Please look at this issue: https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/60. Hi guys, \nWell if I'm mentioned by name there is no way I'm not responding :) \nActually there is a way to run streama via ssl, but streama alone isn't quite capable. You use cloudflare for SSL? I guess that could work, but remember, then all traffic goes through cloud flare.. And we're talking videos here ... Not sure if you really want that. But anyway, in that case I guess all you need to do is change your port, and for that please check here:  https://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/Getting-started#8-how-do-i-change-the-port\nAlternatively, you could do it like me and hook an nginx or Apache in front that handles SSL and routes the requests. If you need more instructions let me know . This is truly something I've noticed too, and personally using the local file explorer helped me circumvent this issue: I just rsync my files into the designated 'local files' directory and then pick out the files from there rather than upload them via streama. That way I can organize stuff into folders, too.   \nRegarding the files uploaded by streama: the problem comes with duplicate names etc. If you were to attempt to upload two .srt files with the same name then the application wouldn't be able to upload the second because it doesn't know whether it's allowed to replace it or what. So then I'd either have to implement a non-duplication handling where files are suffixed with a counter, but that's also quite complex, or I just override the file. But what you see in the upload directory currently is a lot more solid than a file-name. It's a hash over the file content itself. Basically the string represents the file itself. So if you upload a file called 'episode 1.mp4' and there's already such a file for a completely different show then the hash for both files would be entirely different whereas the name wouldn't be. You know? . Hi,\nThis is a common problem. With HTML5 you need to watch both the video and the audio Codec. H264 and AAC work reliably. You could use something like handbrake to convert them.. What is the status here, can it be merged or is the limit an issue? . Wonderful! Thank you so much for your contribution! . This will be added to v1.2.2_beta. Can you attach a video of this behavior? \nCan you screenshot your database settings for the TV show table? Is the id set to Auto-increment there? Are you using h2 or mysql or another? The error on startup is irrelevant . Oh ok! this happens WITHOUT a tmdb key? then it is definitely narrowed down! . Ok Thanks, I will look into it. Keep that demo access up as long as possible, I might not get to it soon . I cant seem to be able to recreate this. Can you give me access to your hosted version? Alternatively, check if the problem persists  here: https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.2_beta. You need to rename it to application.yml . However, the error indicates that the problem lies elsewhere, namely that the database is already in use. . These are great features! Will implement asap\n. \n. Very correct! I will fix this. . in order for vlc to be able to play this file, vlc would need to authenticate with the streama login-credentials. I dont know if VLC is capable of this. Unfortunately, I don't currently know a way around the html5 video restrictions other than converting the files into the right format. . Well I'm glad you had hopes, unfortunately I'm 99% maintaining this project by myself, and I'm a mom of a toddler, went through a move from one country to another this past year and am a part owner of a software engineering company where I'm putting in overtime constantly. \nIf you have any suggestions how I could better manage my time, be my guest, but until then I'd appreciate some sympathy and understanding. I'm doing my best to test all releases fully and also all PRs because if things break in a release I have to respond quickly, at the same time I wanna accept the few PRs that this project gets swiftly, so as to not squash the motivation of the devs. \nDon't know what to tell ya mate, either help me out or wait till there's another alternative out there, or just stick around - slow and steady may win the race . Certainly! I'm welcoming any willing Co maintainers on board, only requirement is that they have made at least one PR so that I can check what they are capable of . also, patreon sounds great! \n. Oh this is great! Can you maybe add it as a wiki page? that way its more searchable. How do you mean, its own new window? do you want a page separate from the dashboard where you can see a media page? a little bit like the detail-page of the admin area, only for all users? . great! . In another application I am working on we are soon rolling out a migration system where upcoming migrations are added to a database table, and they are run through with a CRON job if they dont have to block startup, or at startup if they need to block. Then, when finished, they are marked as completed and never run again. That way, we dont bloat startup too much but still dont need to tell each user what migrations to run & when. What do you think? \n. Do you mean the back button inside the video playback? . Hm I cant seem to reproduce this currently. Can you maybe give me access to a reproducible case that I can debug? . Hm very strange. This sounds like an angular issue and maybe even memory issue. Can you check the following: While you test open the chrome task manager (probably chromium has it also?) under Tools > Task manager. And then once the problem occurs check CPU and memory for that tab. I think something makes the cpu usage skyrocket in that moment. . Fantastic! will merge and make a beta release now. @Jeronimo95 I think its cool that youre actively working on a fork - but how about instead you come on as a co-maintainer in the main project? . Let's chat on gitter . I actually have a reworked version of both, check here: https://github.com/dularion/streama/tree/master/design. but youre welcome to use either. hi! I am working on one :) https://github.com/dularion/streama-app. try using mysql, does that change anything? . the port is in use. that should mean that you didnt kill the application properly or that something else is using port 8080. Subtitles in movies already work, just upload:  \n\n. The other part is a duplicate of this: https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/225. 1: fixed (v1.4.1 RC2)\n2: fixed (v1.4.1 RC2)\n3. I dont quite understand this problem. what does \"You can add delete for TV shows\" mean?\n. All branches are v3 now, and the releases too :) . Oh very good point!. Hi, I will answer you in English as it is easier for me. Please use a tool like google translate if need be. \nCurrently you can actually use streama without themoviedb integration. just leave the API key out and you should be good to go. Whenever you enter data for a movie or show it is saved in your local database and any movies you upload are stored on your own server. Note that themoviedb does not change that behaviour, all it does is allow for movie/tv data to be fetched remotely, facilitating the input of movies and shows greatly! . That would be absolutely fantastic! I was thinking of implementing a node-js runner that uses idle system resources to convert files in the background and make them available to streama when rdy, otherwise they are queued. But immediate transcoding would be even better. Its just not something that I know very much about . I know what the issue is, I've had it before. Which branch did you use when u assembled the war-file? it was fixed in the latest beta, should be on master. . alternatively, what adjustments did you make to the application in order to run it? does it run using the latest beta release instead of using your custom build ? . oh unfortunately 1gb ram is not enough .. :( \n2gb at least afaik . > Sounds like it's doing the same check as what it does for the uploads folder. The local video folder probably only needs read access.\nagreed. its on the list for the next round of fixes. you can use the new bulk-add feature  for now. that works similar, except that you get some control over the matching of the files. let us know what u think . actually, grails and gradle are only required if you actually build out the application yourself. if you use a release version, all u need is java. Could you maybe give us some more info on how you are running it and what your process looks like?. Thanks for your input @Domush\nWe already have the option to add multiple regex searches, I am going to add a documentation for that shortly. \nAbout the feature \"Search TheMovieDB\" - I am not sure I am following: do you mean that the entire file hierarchy is crawled, recursively, for any matches?\nIn theory that shouldn't be a problem - in practice however tmdb has a limitation for searches per second, so you will run into limit-issues. \nBut any ideas for a workaround would be appreciated :) \n. I think it may run if you use mysql, because the internal H2 database is by design a RAM-based database, so it requires a lot of extra RAM to start up. try with MySQL and let us know!. mariaDB should be no problem, and openJDK shouldnt be a problem either. however, it simply states that it cannot connect for root@localhost with the given password, so it can establish communication, just cannot authenticate with those credentials. try to connect with those credentials via command-line: mysql -u root -p [password]\nalso, check your spaces before and after username and password, because whitespace could be a valid password character, so it might not trim. . Does this only happen with files over 2h? with files over 1h i do not have that issue, times like 1:44:23 appear correctly. hi! \nwould it be acceptable to have to add 1 video per language / Audio? extracting the audio and using mp3s is going to be a hassle to sync up correctly . thanks mate, can you add a PR ? . oh cool feature, they should maybe be imported together with the video actually . Thanks!. hi, \n1: it looks like your CSS didnt build correctly. did you use the release-version or a self-built version? \n2: it does display the language, you have to enter it tho in the manage-files dialog where u added the subs . oh damn, just tested it, youre right! \n. This will be auto-fixed in the next release, was just a style-rebuild issue it seems . Hi, in your log @bodems  i can see this line over and over: \nCaused by: java.net.UnknownHostException: streama_EN: hostname nor servname provided, or not known did you customize the war with streama_EN anywhere? . What did you change? . oh i see, \nuploadtypes:['video/h264', 'video/mp4', 'video/mpeg', 'video/quicktime', 'video/webm', 'video/x-ms-wm', 'video/x-ms-wmv',\n              'video/x-msvideo', 'image/bmp', 'image/gif', 'image/jpeg', 'image/pjpeg', 'image/png', 'image/svg+xml',\n              'image/x-icon', 'image/x-png', 'application/x-subrip', 'text/plain', 'text/vtt']. regarding the sound not playing, thats a common issue when files are h264 videoCodec but not AAC audiocodec. It is important that the files are BOTH at the same time. at least thats what always worked for me. Before uploading, there is a way to test this: open a new empty browser-tab and drag&drop your video file in. If it shows up in a player and there is sound, then it's a compatible format. If it downloads, it's incompatible for both. if it only plays the video, but without sound, the audio codec is incompatible.. yea this is an issue, sorry about that. hopefully fixing soon. check https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.4.1RC. Fixed in v0.1.0! (playstore release coming asap, usually takes a couple of hours) . This is cool! but why are you letting ppl download from a drive-document? feels a bit strange. Is that a differently compiled streama.war? . also, I'd like to invite you to write this as a wiki page here on streama-github :) . I dont think you need a custom streama, the streama in my releases is also executable, so you could just do the same with that, no? . > Dashboard doesn't scroll down \nwhich android device are you using? which streama version are you using on the server? . ive extracted the scrolling issue here https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/495. fixed in next release of the app. > Finally is the ere a way to convert the Stream H2 database to SQL easily?\nheres a short tutorial on this, : https://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/Getting-started#12-how-to-use-sql-instead-of-h3-as-a-datastore. wonderful!. Oh dang... Ok that makes sense. Wont be super easy tho. I agree with this ticket! I will add pagination in the next release . check https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.4.1RC. yep, can reproduce!. done. will be in 1.5.0. Doing some bugfixes right now, I can include this in the 1.4.1 release\n. check https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.4.1RC. I'll check it out for v1.4.1. Check https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.4.1RC2. Duplicate of this: https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/488\n. 1.4.1 isnt compatible with mobile yet, see release notes: https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.4.1RC . hm, thats no good! thanks for reporting. can I add you to my android beta testers? in that case, please give me your email address which you use on your phone to download apps in the playstore. Link to beta: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/dularion.streama. with the link above you can actually install it without me adding your email \n. Ok thats good to know. Can you PM me the actual server address with some throwaway username & password? you can use https://gitter.im/. as discussed on gitter, you need streama v1.3.0 or later. One solution is to use an external SMTP-server on port 465 or similar. Some hosters have this option. . can I add you to my android beta testers? in that case, please give me your email address which you use on your phone to download apps in the playstore. oh wait, ok. I just released it with \"Open Beta\". So you guys should be able to see it. its Release:  0.1.2. Link to beta: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/dularion.streama. seems like v1.4.1 RC3 fixes the issue of tv-shows, movies and generic Videos not loading. have a look. \nIf this is  not what is meant by \"can't scroll\", then please let me know! . Hi, I just released a new version for the app. Please check if its fixed there!. > Hi, the app is now displaying but only 30 in each section.   \nthis is kinda wanted behaviour. the only thing missing is the load-more. I can implement that fore mobile tho. I'll make an issue out of that . > Not a very happy bunny at the moment as I have a lot of content uploaded which has been working flawlessly on the Windows platform.\nwell damn. thats ofc not good. however, I actually didnt really mess around with the data in general. So i cant really see the connection, especially if you reverted back to an old version everything should be the same. \nif you wanted you could give me access to a throwaway account on your system and I could check it out. if so, hit me up on gitter.\n\nI am not sure if you are aware that on the Windows platform a directory is create -C:/users/name of user/appdata/local/temp/2/\n\nYea, my brother started coding on streama recently and then we noticed this too. tbh, these kinds of systems, like java applications with a web frontend etc, are usually not so well suited for windows. I mean, for development, sure. But as soon as you are talking about real hosting, then i would go with a virtual server somewhere like amazon servers or digital ocean or, for more control, an old tower PC with ubuntu installed. Windows tends to be kinda weird when it comes to a lot of hosting stuff, which is why it is commonly avoided for that task.   \nLastly, if you are using the app as much as your message indicates, please consider migrating your data over to mysql. With mysql you can more easily backup, recover and adjust your data. H2 is more of a temporary \"getting-started\" type of thing.. Ah i see the issue. the regex matches only files that either use \".\" or \"_\" as a delimiter, not \" \". ill provide instructions asap . Here you go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSuHf-HhSG8. Hi there, \nthanks for this error report! \nthe log u sent is great, I'll investigate :) . Ok there is one more thing i need from you. can you sent me the payload from the ajax request? \nTo obtain this, do this: \n1. Prepare matcher, so that the button \"Add all found matches\" gets enabled \n2. open the developer console, for Chrome this is done by hitting f12\n3. in the developer console, switch to the tab called \"Network\" and scroll all the way down \n4. now click \"Add all found matches\". A new entry in the network should appear, called \"/file/bulkAddMediaFromFile.json\". Click on it\n5. a detail page should open, in there, scroll all the way to the bottom and look at the payload. Please send me the entire payload. . Ah! I got it figured out! It seems to register a match, even if only the Show was found, not the associated episode. alright, will be fixed soon!\n. Hi, yea sorry. the internal server error will be fixed asap, I was very busy with work recently. . Closing in favor for #597 . yep good thought. Okay this is a cool idea. maybe it can be integrated into the upcoming \"report\" modal, where if a video cannot be played then you can report it to a content manager. and there i could add a download button for video and subs. You mean like perform SELECT and UPDATE queries manually, like in mysql? assuming your url is localhost:8080, u can visit something like phpmyadmin (but a lot fewer functionalities!) here: http://localhost:8080/dbconsole\nhere is the official guide: https://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/conf.html#databaseConsole. Thanks @Jeronimo95 ! . Thanks for reporting this! must've missed it. Will look into asap . There are merge conflicts! please resolve first. Can you please add issues in English? Otherwise the searchability of our issues kinda gets broken. So here is how you do it: \nUse the provided gradle wrapper in the root\nExecute it like ./gradlew assemble (That's for Unix terminal)\nFor Windows there should be a gradle.bat, there you can call gradle.bat assemble\nIt'll be created in build/libs/ or something similar\n  . Where do you suggest this info shows up? permanently in the page-header? as an email? or only when he visits the admin section? \nmaybe an icon in the header which leads to the settings page containing a bigger banner, with an explanation & a link to the github release. What do you think? . Fixed the second point by adding the current-time to the display (like in the webpage). Will be available in the next android release. What's wrong with the movie genre exactly?\nAnd what exactly is wrong with the timer? Can you send a screenshot and a description of the expected behavior?. Sorry, Ive had a major deadline at work and ive been a bit burned out. but ill get back to bug-fixing asap !. alrighty, should be fixed in new  0.1.7 release of the app! . Hi, what you're describing already exists! You need to configure a local directory in the settings, that can be used instead of uploading. And then a button will be added where you can add movies and shows from those files via regex name matching! I have a gif somewhere, I'll check . Here you go : https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.2.3_beta\nWe should add this info to the Readme . I can say that Java is very demanding for resources. However, once it runs, it runs solidly and is very secure. There was talk about porting it to nodejs, but until nodejs comes out with a solid framework I dont see that happening. But you are welcome to help improve this software! . Thanks!. Oh interesting! The code for the mobile app is actually just that: just a Frontend speaking to the existing server via api. The code for the app can be found here on github too, called streama-app. It's angular with ionic . What is the server output when this internal server error appears? please try to clear the server output before or (with a couple of empty lines) mark the time BEFORE u press the button, so that afterwards you only get the relevant log outputs. please use pastebin for the log. cant reproduce currently. Can you try recreating the issue on the new demo-server? http://94.130.181.211:8080/ username: \"demo-user\", password \"demo-user\". Oh cool! . Thanks. Fixed the part about --name, the environment variable I didnt change since you didnt seem certain. Docker is not my cup of tea ;) . Thanks for reporting this. I didnt quite fix the issue itself, but i fixed that the error message only outputs \"Error trying to save the user\" because the stacktrace you are showing is actually unrelated. \nSo in the new v1.5.2 release you will be able to at least see whats wrong and can report back . please try with this release: https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.5.2. haha oh well! then thats good news then :) . If the problem reappears let me know!. Thanks!. Thats unfortunately nothing thing can happen any time soon, because we use a certain version of grails, and that version of grails supports a certain version of gradle. Once we do a major grails update again, I'm sure the newer version for gradle will automatically work. In the mean time, I'd suggest not caring about the gradle version at all. Just use the built-in gradle wrapper. One example command is ./gradlew assemble. Here is the (new) readme section about this: https://github.com/dularion/streama/blob/master/README.md#accessing-existing-files. Ive now added this with https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/pull/669 except for the countdown..  also Its been added for the next videoSuggestion, which i now disabled autoplay for - didnt seem to fit there, it only really makes sense for episodes of the same show i believe. Or what do you think? . Ah ok, sure! . fixed in v1.6.0-RC5. You are right. here are a few examples: \nLocal Video File\n\nDirect upload (not the entire path, but the sha)\n\nExternal link (is actually required, but is very redundant)\n\nSo if I am not mistaken (correct me if I am) then the issue is really only for local files, right? \n. So ive drastrically reduced the data returned by the JSON now. this can potentially break the player in some cases, so pls guys help me test this before we add it to the next stable release. You can test it here https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/releases/tag/v1.6.0-RC4. related https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/498. So I have improved the error  handling in the above PR and it now ignores the error-causing episodes, so  theoretically the matcher can be run 2-3 times and all should be matched. however, I do want a queue as well, this is just a bubble-gum fix.. Alright! I added some basic API data caching! I hope this will fix the most obvious bugs with this! heres hoping :) will be in v1.6.0-RC1. see https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/v1.6.0-RC1. Some of the entries in there are actually for non-admins as well. I suggest maybe adding an extra property to each entry which assigns it to either admin, content manager or user and then depending on the roles the user has only the relevant points are shown. What do you think? . I will take a look at it now. ill check it out . I dont really use either, can you specify what you mean? \n. (i rephrased the title and first comment a bit). related https://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/231. I think that sounds like a cool idea, and some docs to go along with it. Also, maybe we can add a backend where users can dynamically create \"plans\" by checking and unchecking a couple of fixed features. . try redownloading the RC1, the .war i uploaded last night was broken. sorry! . Please refer to this doc: \nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/FAQs#8-how-do-i-change-the-port. check out the existing ionic app: https://github.com/dularion/streama-app - this is maybe an easier starting point for porting to the new angular and ionic. \nI dont have a lot of experience with using ionic for a full-fledged web-app (progressive web app), but it shouldnt be a big problem really. Its a lot of rework, though, not for the part of the application that is about watching content, that was easy and already done in the streama-app, but the content management & admin sections will be a lot of stuff to rewrite. just a heads up :) . No objections here :) \n. I believe this isnt relevant anymore. Ill close it . Cool idea :) . yea i will soon tho, maybe even today. No promises tho ;) . done in release RC7. @mcchan  i think there was a misunderstanding, the issue i believe was talking about the dashboard continue-watching section. hi there! \nso firstly, you can actually adjust the regex however you like :) you can chain a bunch of OR-regex-matchers which then goes through each one to find a match. All you need to do is adjust the application.yml, see an example here: https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/releases/tag/v1.2.3_beta\nsecondly, I think your idea is good to improve the default-matcher. Would you be willing to play around with the matcher a bit to find the sweet spot and then send me your regex? then I can add it to the default regex we use currently, so for future installations admins wont have to input any fancy regex-override anymore. . Oh ok, I tried to look at how KODI does it, and they use a single regex per type afaik. But maybe that has changed since the last time I checked. I guess we could implement something more complex, but before I do I think it would be interesting to see how far we can stretch this regex thing. What would be useful would be a list of names that currently dont match and that should match. If you could supply a first draft of such a list we can work on the regex together and see if we need to implement some code changes or if regex is enough . I'm now considering adding a list of regex for both shows and movies, so instead of having to build one gigantic regex, you can provide multiple alternative regex. Would that be a step in the right direction? . so now ive added multi-regex options to tvShows. Check out the new section in the sample application.yml \nhttps://github.com/streamaserver/streama/blob/master/docs/sample_application.yml . ok let me know! . should be fixed in 1.6.0-RC5 thanks to @mcchan1991 . Thank you! . sounds kinda cool, but the current way to do it is to mount your external drive using your OS and then let streama access it as though it really was a local drive. Or is there a disadvantage to that approach compared to WebDAV? . fixed in v1.6.0-RC5. Have you tried to map nginx to the 8080 port? It sounds to me like you used the application.yml to change the port to 80 but to do it properly you should use nginx or apache. Ok so then its not streama attaching the :80, because streama uses tomcat and tomcat only runs on 8080. if you didnt change anything, then it would never redirect to 80. I am assuming its something about your nginx config. care to paste it here using pastebin? . Thanks for this.. This is something I've known for a while and couldnt seem to fix properly - however, when using the mobile app on android it seems to work just fine. have you tried that? . Also the UI should be improved - if a selection of 40 files turns up 20 already matched files, 2 errors and 18 proper matches, the 20 already matched files should be deselected. . Should be improved in v1.6.0-RC5. fixed in next release . yes ok! ill add them back in. Not sure what you are saying - caching should be enabled with or without https, see screenshot: \n\nWhat exactly do you wish to improve? . Yes, you are correct. It should be case-insensitive. I'll add it to the regex execution . Yes! I like it :) . \n. @mcchan  i think there was a misunderstanding, the issue i believe was talking about the dashboard continue-watching section. The issue described originally is referring to the regular site, viewed in a browser, as can be seen by the address bar. For me the images display properly, @junnotpiper . What kind of content is this? manually added? or via tmdb? . agreed :) . Oh thanks for this :) currently we are all pretty busy but we will try to take a look asap . I dont know if it is the responsibility of the application to deal with this sort of thing - this sounds to me like you want something like nginx to route your requests and something like iptables / firewall to block certain ports / accesses. \nI like what you suggest, as it is in line with mysql disallowing non-localhost access or elasticsearch doing the same, but I feel like instead of each service providing that feature, it should be up to the operating system and other tools like iptables to restrict access in a global way. \nI am not opposed to the setting if we can find it... \nWe could probably hack it in using an interceptor... But I am not sure that is exactly what you want, either, because with a portscan it can still be found. \nAny suggestion would be greatly appreciated tho :) . sure thing, give it a go :) and thanks! . Cool :) . ah I like it - a message-box so to speak. Good idea :) . This is indeed bothersome.. i cant reproduce it for my personal streama server but in general we need to fix the genre issue and make the genre checks more null-safe. I would be OK with reopening this . Agreed :) lets document. Thanks @EMcCormack  for the help :) . here you go: https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/wiki/Streama-regex-Matcher-for-Batch-File-Adding. Yes! . thanks for that, ill check out RC8 and see what the cause is . alright, here u go :) try it out https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/releases/tag/v1.6.0-RC9. Ive added some comments - Please check those and get back to me before this can be merged. Ah now they showed up, i had to submit the review! . I fixed the continue-watching image with this https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/commit/9f92b714412c56705b9b9f5632a1f9b328b17add. This will be included as of release v1.6.0-RC10!. can you remove the files ProfileSpec.groovy & ProfileControllerSpec.groovy? Since no real tests are implemented there, only the default one, travis is failing. . I will review asap :) \n. Ok awesome! lets add it to streama :) . yay! great fix :) thanks! . I wasnt aware that this didnt work properly. What exactly was broken here? . Ok lets try. Approved. we now added a  missing setting in the application.yml, that might fix it. please let me know! . (should be in the next release, v1.6.1) - its on master-branch already. Ok so I looked at the code more closely and I think what we need is a new functionality, that takes the newest ViewingStatus entry for a tvShow, not by episode-number, but by lastUpdated of the actual viewingStatus object. That way, we get the most recent activity of a user on a TV-Show . see my comment in the issue . Thanks! . let me try it out locally and get back to you . we cant do that unfortunately, because each and ever one of you have different hosts, one might be called \"myvideos.org\" another maybe \"stream-videos.io\". so when the app comes from the play store it is kept \"generic\", i.e. nothing like that is prefilled and your users have to use your specific url. . thanks to @mcchan hopefully fixed in next release. cool, hope this works!. Oh cool, I didn't even know it worked at all with Java 9 \ud83d\ude0a. thanks to @mcchan hopefully fixed in next release. Several Points:\n- Directives should be placed in their own file and not inside of a controller file.\n- directives should not be suffixed with the word \"directive\" but instead prefixed with an app-specific token such as \"streama\" or something else. In this case I would call it videoTimeFormat or streamaVideoTimeFormat and then it is used as video-time-format. Just \"format-directive\" is bad practice and too generic. \nOtherwise good joob on this. \n. You committed too much formatting stuff! This is very bad practice and creates a lot of unnecessary \"changes\" to review. In case you use intellij IDEA, there is a editorconfig committed with it, which you can use. \nThese kinds of things should be cleaned up before committing. \n. There should be a space behind the ,  . This is also something that the editorconfig will take of for you. \n. You maybe did something wrong when merging the files? Because You removed some code logic that needs to be in place. Please undo this. \n. Again, you seem to have removed some of my code changes in a local merge. \n. Again, removed some of my stuff.... \n. Here too \n. What happened here? you created a whole new marshaller? And you removed a bunch of my marshallers? Why did you do this?  IF you do something this extreme, your commit messages should be much much much more verbose! \n. It is best practice to initialize new variables in the beginning of the file. \n. instead of checking and setting the currEpisode here, you should check it in the onCanPlay method as everything gets initialized there. \n. good work! \n. instead of using int, use Integer. int does not allow for NULL values and therefore they all get initialized with 0 which could potentially break the application. \n. Why did you remove that last sentence?\n. Thanks for this! Good catch \n. Interesting choice, although for easier debugging I actually use mysql locally. Maybe each contributor should set this as desired without pushing?\n. Oh oops, I thought it was the message about the synchronized playback.. Haha you're right of course \n. All right all right :) \n. Why do you remove on two conditions? is the ID not enough?. why do you stringify the deletionBulk?. This method should becalled \"addOrRemove....\". cool that you used the delete request type \ud83d\udc4d . interesting, we usually check if the element is in the list, and if so, remove it, otherwise add it, but I like this approach, too!. There is an easier way, if the params are passed normally, not stringified, then the request looks something like this: \nDELETE /file/removeMultipleFilesFromDisk?id=1&id=2&id=4\nand then in the controller, you can do \ndef ids = params.list('id')\n// ['1', '2', '4']\nand if you want it not as strings, then you can do \ndef ids = params.list('id').collect{it.toLong()}\n// [1, 2, 4]\n. and then here it would be the ids that you iterate, which makes things easier to name. instead of \"element\" you can call it \"id\" etc. . oh, dont use Ecmascript 6! that is not suppoted by a lot of browsers yet. Please use lodash's forEach instead. this remove can be simplified: .remove($scope.files, {id: id});. findById can be simplified to like so: File.get(id). actually, I would probably rename this array and the method that adds or removes it, Because I just realized, this is merely the selection. The selection itself has nothing to do with bulk-deletion. Think of it this way: you could also select 4, and then choose another action, like \"move to different harddrive\" or similar. So basically, this array and the method below is $scope.selectedFiles = [] and addOrRemoveFromSelection = function(){. ah, the reason why it wasnt on the right hand side is because you have your ng-repeat on the col-sm-8, which is bad practice. The col-sm-8 should wrap everything that should be on the right side, so please create a nesting div, and it is that div that you want to repeat over. did you adjust the existing buttons functionality? How exactly does it work? if the user does not choose a season number, it will fetch all? . maybe give user more clear instructions, for example that he can use 1-3 syntax. . maybe safer approach is to split by '-' and then use the resulting array pos 0 and 1, trim them, and then parse them. Consider if the user types \"1 - 5\"\n. avoid for loops, use lodash .forEach instead for legibility. . NEWEST_AIRED: 'Most Recently Aired'\nAlso, feel free to check the original here:  https://github.com/ManuGithubSteam/streama/blob/4bfc4e011b3b196e2ba41f1af2867ae8a1a06d01/grails-app/assets/javascripts/streama/translations/EN_us.js. You cant remove this part of the code, its important for the initial setup, but maybe query against another missing setting, like the upload directory? . ive never seen this assert syntax. what does it do exactly? . This isnt null-safe, json_similar might be null at this point. a way to be null-safe is to use ?between the ., like so: json_similar?.results. I'd prefer if the variable be named in camelCase instead of snake_case. Snake_case is only used for properties that are taken 1to1 from the API . again, u gotta be null-safe here. json_trailer or reults[0] might be null. use json_trailer?.results[0]?.key. the variable strList could be better named.. . this is a very large commit... the original commits were 5, I believe. why did you choose to make it all as one commit? . same here, avoid snake_case. why are you adding the option isApiMovie onto $scope.media?. you dont really need isApiMovie: false here, do you? because that is kind of the default.. . something isnt quite right here, or? . why are you outputting {{isApiMovie}} in the a-tag?. it should be alertify.error and angular.isDefined(mediaId) == false and angular.isDefined(mediaType) == false. this is a strange change and should have been reverted before committing. console.logs should generally be cleaned up before committing the changes. . in the end, this turned out not to be necessary if you remember. so it couldve been removed here. as can been seen in your commit message, you did 2 things in this commit. However, in this specific case it wouldve been pretty easy to separate those changes into 2 separate commits: in the first commit, titled with \"display correct error message for sendErrorReport\" you couldve included the files  modal-error-report-ctrl.js and modal--error-report.tpl.htm. in the second commit, titled \"check whether report was already sent\" you could've included the changes in VideoController.groovy. warning: preExistingReports is a detatched query at this point!. vm.selectedFiles?. sneaky. as u can see, the previous commit was slighly broken due to the copy-paste artifacts from the selectedFiles stuff. next time, when you have 2 consecutive commits, where one fixes the other, use \"Amend commit\". all of these changes should not have been included! please check for automatic formatting like that  before committing. sneaky change! why did you change respond reportsto return [reportList:reports]?. usually lastUpdated is automatically set, so you dont even have to set it here . if you arent 100% sure that commented out code can be removed, then please don't. sometimes developers leave code-blocks in place as a reminder for something or for reactivation later. sneaky change! this commit message only indicates towards the change on line 243. the rest is changed without addressing it in the commit message. Ideal solution: separate the commits. workaround solution: mention it in the commit message at least. . note: instead of starting commit messages with \"let you\", just start it with the text after. example\n'this commit will let you send episode data additionally to the video data'\n'this commit will send episode data additionally to the video data'\nThe first is harder to read without the prefix \"this commit will\", the second isnt, as it sounds more like an instruction. misspelled lstUpdated. warning! two times '$filter'?. code style: you shouldnt omit the {} even in a one-liner, otherwise its harder to extend later on. youre doing a lot of looping here - forEach inside of forEach. can this be improved somehow? . in your commit message you state \"make multiple report resolving only work with unresolved reports\" - but i think that change isnt included in this commit, but a previous commit, isnt it? . you can actually do this thing where u extend the whole object with new data. It looks like so: \nangular.extend(oldReport, response.data);\nthis way, angular wont lose its reference to the oldReport, and instead it will populate the data with the new data only. many unnecessary whitespace changes. please check all changes before committing. you left a duplicate of _report.gson in the video folder as well as the getErrorReports.gson. here u bind a method on the scope, called reportsForMovie, only to immediately execute that method and never use it again. on those cases, dont use the $scope. In a way, the angular $scope is a precious thing, that shouldnt be overused. the more you put onto the scope, the more angular has to work to render everything. In this case, this is a simple javascript helper method in which you request an API endpoint and THEN bind something on the scope (which is ofc ok!). So dont use $scope for the method itself. shouldve been removed when finalizing this commit. is it necessary to have vm.loadReports and vm.initialLoad  really on the vm? do you access these functions from the html templates? . it is best to add this kind of \"initialization\"-logic high up in the controller, before all the hoisted methods. see this  example: https://github.com/dularion/streama/blob/master/grails-app/assets/javascripts/streama/controllers/admin-movies-ctrl.js. sneaky change! why did you remove this again? in a previous commit you stated that this fixed a bug. why use  JSON.use instead of gsons?  . there is a lot of redundant code here. Here is a different approach: \n```groovy\nBoolean resolved = params.boolean('resolved')\nList resports = Report.where{\nif(resolved != null){\n resolved == resolved\n}\n}.list()\n```\nthis way, you \n- only have 1 where query for all 3 cases\n- you have a 1-to-1-matching for the param-name and the property to filter on (null equals \"all\" since the query is then not included, true equals \"resolved\", false equals \"unresolved\")\n- this where query is easily extendable with more filters & sorting\n- it is higher in performance, because your code basically says: get all reports from database, and THEN go through all and check the criteria inside of the findAll. my suggestion only fetches the relevant records from the db. . if you are on page 2, for example, and then you use one of the filter-buttons, then nothing gets shown, because internally it still sends the old offset of 15. This needs to be resettet to 0 when filtering. . same for sorting. those are the wrong gsons to remove, i think!. i actually really like the styling of these buttons, but here is my problem. \n\nImagine an untrained eye. The green check, without knowing that its a button, almost looks like its telling the user \"all is good here\", where the rest X sort of communicates \"something is bad here\". wheras in reality, you intended it to mean the exact opposite, the red X means, that it has been resolved. \nhere is my suggestion: make a column in this table specifically for showing the report status, i.e. something red for \"still a problem\" and something green for \"all good here, resolved already\". And then add a neutral action button in the very right with a text instead of icon, a text that says either \"mark as resolved\" or \"mark as unresolved\" or similar. That way the UI is a lot less \"clean\", but its also less confusing. . Lets talk about it tomorrow!\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Check _.intersectionBy using the 'id' property! \nhttps://lodash.com/docs/#intersectionBy. \ud83d\udc4d . Let me check and get back to you. All right! will explain in a workshop. I see! I'll show you :) . It is what we talked about in an earlier workshop. But I'll refresh it in a workshop . oki. the logic is: dateCreated AND lastUpdated are automatically set when first INSERTing the row, and lastUpdated is set on all subsequent updates.. in this case I dont even know what this was for. But its a good rule of thumb. Hm .. let me check!. Makes sense. As long as you keep it in mind itll be fine :) if you make a conscious decision to include \"let you\" from now on, then I'll trust that you put good thought into it :) . ```groovy\ndef index () {\n    Boolean resolved = params.boolean('resolved')\n    Long createdById = params.long('createdById')\n    String sort = params.sort\n    String order = params.order\n    Integer max = params.int('max', 30)\n    Integer offset = params.int('offset', 0)\ndef responseObj = [\n  reports: [],\n  count: 0\n]\n\nDetachedCriteria reportQuery = Report.where {\n  if (resolved != null) {\n    resolved == resolved\n  }\n  if (createdById != null) {\n    createdBy.id == createdById\n  }\n}\nresponseObj.reports = reportQuery.list(sort: sort, order: order, max: max, offset: offset)\nresponseObj.count = reportQuery.count()\n\nJSON.use('adminReports'){\n  render (responseObj as JSON)\n}\n\n}\n. fixed.\nvar lastResolvedReports = .intersectionBy(newReports, vm.reports, 'id');\n.forEach(lastResolvedReports, function(report){\n report.resolved = true;\n});\n.\n.forEach(newReports, function(newReport){\n  var vmReport = .find(vm.reports, {id: newReport.id});\n _.set(vmReport, 'resolved', true);\n});\n```. why did you add this? That would imply that you suggest there is an environment called \"mysql\"  which I dont really see as a proper environment . Ive removed this code on purpose because of the new directive - why did you add it back in? . hm Id prefer to use the directive - what was the problem here? . same here - can we find a way to fix it using the directive? . why remove this entire logic? I think it was good-ish - could be improved upon, but not removed imo\nEDIT: in RC9 I actually fixed it via a nullsafe usage in the marshaller, so no need to remove it here . good change . why remove this? . wait a second, this will literally reset the playback, correct? so a user will actually all of a sudden be transported to the beginning of the video. I believe in the issue you linked, the desire is simply that the continue_watching backend logic is reset, so that on next-time viewing it starts at the beginning, not right away in the middle of watching... .

Yep, using data volumes or data volume containers is the official approach to persisting data across multiple runs. \nVideo files MUST be on a mounted volume as the docker container layered file system (copy-on-write) isn't providing good read/write performances in most cases.\n\n@thomasleveil It doesn't actually have to be a mounted volume from the host. A volume itself should avoid UFS. Good point about r/w performance, I hadn't considered that.\n. ",

However, this article talks a bit about using Angular and the chromecast API. http://semanticmedia.byu.edu/2013/09/continuing-with-chromecast-embedding-youtube-into-custom-receivers.html\n. @dularion I believe for Chrome you must have the Chromecast extension installed.\nYes, I think that using the default GUI would be a good idea to allow that functionality but on the other hand you are losing some of the UX look/feel that you originally designed. \nGoogle has added a handful of examples on using the chromecast API. https://github.com/googlecast\n. I would definitely be in favor of switching to using a Node backend instead of Grails. I actually saw this repo today and was like I should fork and port to Node. So that would save me a lot of time. I do like Express but there are some other alternatives out there as well, Vanilla NodeJs, Restify, Hapi. \nFor frontend, I would vote staying with Angular and css framework of your choice (assuming bootstrap since that is what is included currently). I agree using Cordova would be a great choice once the app is more stable unless someone wants to issue PRs for it.\n.

Running something like Streama can keep your data to yourself.\nI have ran Plex and Emby. Although would like to give Streama a shot sometime soon.\n. @yusijs really the only thing that you need to do to play outside your home is the correct ports opened and your public IP.\nPlex simplifies this by storing your public IP and other media information on their servers. \n. :+1: @dularion great work!\n. :+1: For docker image\nI also agree with @thomasleveil. Mounted Volume and disposable containers running only the application code/binaries.\n. I'm not experienced with Docker either but its seems to me that it would store the database data outside the docker image? \nhttps://docs.docker.com/articles/dockerfile_best-practices/#volume-https-docs-docker-com-reference-builder-volume\nhttps://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#volume\n. I'm not a huge sideways scrolling fan. You can still vertically stack/scroll items with a lazy loader as well. I have done this in projects before.\n. Not that I'm particularly interested in it but I always am in favor of modular code. It would be a \"cool\" feature to allow users/devs to create their own \"skin\" and apply it. As well as, be able to use your html5 player outside of this app.\n:+1: for modularity\n. @dularion How does streama handle multi-episode files? \n. The closest one I can think of off the top of my head would be Avatar: The Last Airbender. The first 2 episodes aired back to back and there are next to no files where they are split apart. However, tvDB, shows them as two separate episodes.\n@admwx7 might be able to think of some others.\n. I think this relates closely with #63 and #60.\nI would be in favor of closing these issues and creating a generic \"link support\" issue. Where we can list all supported(requested) providers, features, and overall status.\n.

    "dantheman213": "Thanks for the info. How likely are you to port the project to NodeJS?\nWas there a reason to select Grails over NodeJS originally? How much effort would it take to port over the code?\n. Hmm, I'm more in favor of live transcoding. Or maybe have an option that will allow permanent conversion during off time. If you have a huge media 4TB+ of data then transcoding the whole thing can be very costly in terms of processing power and storage space.\nThis wasn't closed by the way so I'm closing the ticket and any further discussion should take place at:\nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/20\n. I think NodeJS would be great because you can combine other technologies like ExpressJS/Jade along with back end techs like Socket IO and FFMPEG  to get a robust media solution that can stream over the network. For the front end I think AngularJS is a great idea but if you're sufficiently skilled with jQuery you can get away with that + plugins for the front end UI.\n. @dularion I have a lot of experience with NodeJS. I would recommend using Express as the server MVC framework. Learn more about Express here:\nhttp://expressjs.com/\nI have created a NodeJS server starting point some time ago. Please check out my repo:\nhttps://github.com/dantheman213/nodejs-express-mvc-boilerplate-template\nThe project above is more of a starting point for a website but can be easily used as a REST server. Reading the documentation will help you get started.\nAs for authentication, PassportJS works great. You can find an example of local authentication here:\nhttp://passportjs.org/docs/authenticate\nI've also implemented a custom authentication login system with one of my web apps --it's not too difficult to accomplish!\n@Copytalky I'm sure ReactJS has its merits. I haven't used it before but I've had huge success with jQuery and AngularJS (before that backbone) with my web apps. But there are many good tools to get the job done!\n. @dularion Express contains all the elements for an MVC app by default. You have your init code, routes that match URLs to controllers, and then you have your models that will contain your data, and lastly Express comes with Jade by default to manage the views. All of this together provides the MVC framework for rapid application development of web apps and websites.\nYou don't need to use the 'View' aspect of Express though. When you init an action on a controller you can just do something like this:\n```\nrouter.get('/userlist', function(req, res) {\n    // server requested https://api.mysite.com/userlist\n    var users = [{UserId: 0, UserName: \"timmy\"}]; // use logic here to get your data to send\n    res.json(users);\n});\nmodule.exports = router;\n```\nAnd that's all there is to it, really.\n. @tegon I like how Express segments everything out. You just install middleware packages for stuff like HTTP auth, rewrite rules, or SSL, for example. But the benefit here is that you're not installing some huge monster web server.. you're just installing what you need for your project and you'll get a performance gain there.\n. Also Ionic is exclusively for mobile apps. It's wrapped with Apache Cordova so that you can cross deploy against mobile platforms.\n. This may sound crazy but I think that if you want to make a great alternative to options like Netflix or do-it-yourself paid services like Plex that you should create the front-end app using a gaming engine like Unity3D in order to write one code base but be able to deploy to everything!\nhttps://unity3d.com/\nUnity3D is free for open source projects and commercial products that generate revenue up to $100,000 annual gross income. It is a full fledged game studio that includes MonoDevelop for cross platform C# ( http://www.monodevelop.com/ ) and deploys to a plethora of platforms such as: Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Blackberry, OSX, Linux, Windows XP+, HTML5 browsers, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, PS Vita, Wii U and more.\nWith that type of deployment, I would use Unity as the client application and bite the bullet on the learning curve of Unity and figure out how to use its 2D engine. From there you can then generate interfaces, menus, stream video --everything could occur from within Unity.\nOn the server end, use NodeJS, Express (or another MVC style framework for REST implementation) Socket IO, and FFMPEG (video conversion, downgrading for lower bandwidth devices, etc).\nThis would allow for a robust solution and for nearly the same amount of development time, be able to deploy your video streaming application on every platform under the sun and reap the benefits of a network based server --especially if it could serve media securely over the Internet.\n. I definitely agree that it would be more difficult. And I have some experience with Unity as well and I know it's no picnic. But if I was to tackle a problem like this I also think the benefit of deploying to everything is appealing to me.\nI did find some good tutorials on generating interfaces within Unity. And with release 5 it may have become easier to do so!\nhttps://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/user-interface-ui\nThere are videos where a guy is literally walking you through creating a menu. \nHowever, doesn't have to be Unity --just a thought!\n. @admwx7 The idea would be to take the steeper learning curve but have the great ability to write code once and maintain one strict code base. Your idea suggests using alternative protocols and wrappers to target multiple platforms which takes extra work and will also deliver a poorer result. (e.g. cordova apps run like garbage on our older Android devices).\nAlso, DLNA is almost like a file server view. I don't want to browser folders of my media.. I could just setup a file share from the get go using NFS or SMB or something to do that. I want a pretty interface and logic which DLNA can't provide.\nI get that the logical idea here is to create an HTML5 app because of its RAD + multiple platforms qualities. But I think my idea has merit because it targets way more platforms and you're writing your code only once with no wrappers. \nFor example, I have a PlayStation 4 and I mainly use it as a dummy box to stream Netflix or Plex content. Many people use consoles to stream content so I think that part of having an appealing product is being able to target all these platforms. Netflix and Plex though have tons of resources and can create many version of their product for individual platforms. But as indie/open source developers we don't have that same luxury.\n. @admwx7 as far as I've seen DLNA is only a way for devices to see each other over the network and stream media to each other. There's not much more complexity than that. Embry offers a complex user interface for its standard app. Just because your device supports DLNA doesn't mean that's how it'll look on a device you're connecting to the server using that technology. I've attached what it looks like to connect to a DLNA server from a PS3.\n\nAlso, Apache Cordova builds native apps by wrapping a web view on the device and providing a layer to communicate to the OS APIs via Javascript. I've used it in conjunction with the Ionic library. Worked great but had big performance issues on non flagship devices that were even a year or two old.\n@Copytalky as this is a open source project and not a huge development team working for a multi million dollar company I think that it makes sense to use this tech or a similar tech in order to be able to accomplish much more then you're able to using convential means. \nI get that there is a big learning curve on the project but as a developer that should excite you! More fancy knowledge to slap on the CV. Personally, I get bored doing the same stuff all the time! Web apps were so 2010 lol. \nActually, I get why everyone wants to do a web app. I just feel like if you really want to compete with the other devices out there you gotta target consoles and other platforms too. And using a game engine may be a huge shortcut rather than developing a core and tons of wrappers or different versions of the same project. \n. @admwx7 Enable casting? What does that mean? Can you send a screenshot of this working? When I google \"DLNA specs\" or \"DLNA capabilities\" I don't see any such thing. In addition, when I look at screenshots of various DLNA servers being run on the client devices it looks like a file server.\nI'm pretty sure that's because the embedded DLNA clients in devices like the PS3, PS4, or Xbox are not capable of such a thing. My point here is that while DLNA is good for discovery and streaming (limited formats) it's not going to provide a robust client interface on something like a PS3. The truth is that you need a complex app and a more complex protocol than DLNA to provide a rich experience to your end user.\nPS. I have had a ton of experience with DLNA on both the PS3 and PS4. It was just awful. Because it's treated like a file share if you have a large TV Shows or Movies folder good luck navigating through it! Also, no meta data like picture, rating, show name, director, year released, actors, etc. Not to mention trying to seek through a video or wait for the server to be queried again when navigating into a sub folder. I ended up giving it up for self hosted Plex server.\n. Hmm, well I'm not convinced DLNA is capable of any such thing. It sounds like what you're doing is using an app that has its own separate database, protocol, etc is doing all the work and then initiating a DLNA stream on the target device with the media you want at the end... which isn't really what I thought we were discussing.\nAnyhow, an average user may choose to use their TV OS (Vizio, Samsung, or Android TV), console (Playstation/Xbox/Wii), or a web browser view, or their mobile or tablet device.\nThe point here is that in order to make an appealing product it makes sense to write the code once and deploy it to everything. You give no excuse to anyone not to use it because it is just so awesome! However, your suggestion is more to program for what you want specifically and I think that if you're going to create a project for people --you should do it right!\nI was just looking at Unity tutorials and they have amazing documentation and YouTube videos of people building projects from the ground up. The 2D documentation has everything needed. If you're familiar with C# and/or .NET programming than I think using Unity should be pretty straight forward since it uses C# and MonoDevelop (instead of .NET) to compile the code. \nI think there is definitely a learning curve to learning how the engine works and then make it behave in a non-standard way but if you're able to implement interfaces, perfect video streaming, and networking than why not take advantage? I mean games have to do all that stuff anyways, right?\n. @admwx7 you linked me to the Wikipedia page and it doesn't prove your point in any way. \nAlso, I know Plex has a Playstation app. I use it all the time :) \n. For anyone interested, I ended up creating a repository to experiment with the idea of using Unity as the client. You can find it here:\nhttps://github.com/dantheman213/ambrosia\nIf I have enough time it's something that I'm interested enough in to pursuing. Hopefully I can get enough of the project done to get some other devs interested!\n. Why ditch Plex? It is a better option for the foreseeable future.\n. It's not really a big deal. Even worst case scenario Plex got raided \nthey don't have proof you did anything wrong. You're allowed to share \nyour personal media however you want. As long as your Plex URL isn't \npublic for anyone to grab it I can't really see how you could be easily \nconvicted of anything even if Plex did go down. Besides for $5/mo you \nreally can't go wrong. Plex is a world apart from Streama. This project \njust got a bunch of stars because it was on the front page for a day. \nBefore that this project didn't have any serious development or \ndirection so there's no way an open source project like this has \nsuperseded a product like Plex.\nOn 4/18/16 6:41 AM, Michael Stramel wrote:\n\n@dantheman213 https://github.com/dantheman213 Plex stores \ninformation on their servers regarding your media library and in their \nToS states that they will comply with the government if asked to. \nRunning something like Streama can keep your data to yourself.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub \nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/20#issuecomment-211383485\n. @admwx7 I'll check it out.

    "phi0x": "I find this project to be really cool as well! I do have a few suggestions for changes. I feel that for maximum compatibility the project could be done in reactJS and nodeJS.

I'm pretty newb with react/nodejs so I can't fork this and really do much on my own but i thought I'd throw out some suggestions while the project is in it's early stage of development.\nAlso with the transcoding for html5 compatibility, I think if upon scanning a drive for media, it should find files and evaluate whether they're html5 stream compliant, if not add them to a queue for transcoding conversion. This could be a feature that the user sets up on initial setup, where it can be setup in two ways:\n- User just wants to have streama read media files and transcode live - not affecting original files\n- User wants to have streama read media files and convert them permanently to html5 compliant streaming formats.\nTypical users can likely get away with just transcoding live. However here's a few things most people don't consider:\n- power savings, I'm a huge advocate of saving power and to have a system always transcoding live would mean i'm having my machine process files over and over again potentially, when they should be processed once.\n- households that utilize streama for family use, aka 2-4+ people in a home utilizing streama at the same time. One household server that hosts all media content and has to transcode live so many streams would potentially be a bottleneck for a lot of people out there with low budget server systems, not to mention again the power usage would be quite high in comparison to if the user had transcoded all media files upon import.\nhope I've been helpful with my suggestions :) I'll keep monitoring the project and see what I can pitch in on.\n. I agree nodeJS is the way to go, reactJS is also something that should be highly considered for frontend/backend, it's used by Netflix and Facebook after-all.\n. I agree angularJS is great in many ways. I've had various discussions on IRC regarding scalability and performance with JS/PHP programmers and even some facebook members from the reactJS channel. At the end of the day for scalability and performance for our large project we've decided to go with reactJS/nodeJS/immutibleJS (https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/). Not to say AngularJS can't scale per say, but from the discussions I've seen and the case studies I've read previously, I found react and node are extremely powerful and easy to scale with. Streama from what I see wont be something that need's to really 'scale' large, at least for its intended purpose so honestly anything people are comfortable programming with/in is fine for this project I would think. I just thought I'd mention the frameworks/libraries/environments that I've been seeing getting a lot of attention lately with the larger scale company's/projects and that I've chosen for mine.\nAt the end of the day, the project should use what everyone feels comfortable using - as long as it gets the end result done.\nOnly other recommendation I have is do some resource tests for frontend, see how much load a browser utilizes and if it's resource hungry, try to find out what aspect of the project is causing it. Users that have laptops or mobile devices need streams that are as resource friendly as possible, if a browser is using 10-30% of the CPU to stream a show that's going to really put a damper on the usability factor. Servers tend to usually get the spotlight when it comes to resource tests, but thought I'd throw in that other factor for frontend tests seeing as this platform really is both frontend and backend based.\nEveryone's suggestion for Cordova seems really great too once the project is more stable like @stramel said.\n. Webkit was ripped apart by Netflix and converted to 'project gibbon' utilizing react as well for their cross platform compatibility. I'm not familiar with the difference between webkit/cordova but it seems webkit can be utilized across many platforms(PC, Mobile, consoles). Unity sounds like a cool idea but I agree that there's less coders out there that understand it and are willing to go the extra length to get into it.\n. From my understanding it would be 'ok' with Google. This is a open-sourced platform afterall. Not like a paid platform that's ripping google off by utilizing their google drive services. There are lots of apps out there as well which utilize google drive for backing up config data, syncing videos/photos/files etc, and those apps are sometimes paid ones.\nOther platforms like Emby utilize google drive for storing transcoded video files, the problem with that is you have to have an Emby server, store the video file, have Emby transcode it, have Emby then upload the transcodes to Google Drive. When I'm on the go I don't want to have a media server at home transcoding a media file then uploading to google drive, I see it as nailing two birds with one stone if you just upload your media to Google Drive and utilize their player for handling transcoding.\nIt would be really amazing to just be able to host a private cheap VPS that doesn't have to actually host the media files and just plays your hotlinked Google Drive media.\n. yeah you are right in the sense that you don't really need a VPS then. rather just something like a cordova based app platform that has a nice UI and allows you to connect to your google drive accounts and import the hotlinks.\n. @dantheman213 I believe what admwx7 was trying to portray before (correct me if I'm wrong), is that DLNA on the PS3/PS4 has no fancy interface, it is a file folder structure interface, however if you utilize the 'emby' app on your phone, and your PS3/PS4 is turned on and talking on your LAN, the DLNA media server (emby) will see the PS3/PS4 device, and on your mobile you can browse through the emby app all of your shows in the nice UI that you've wanted. Then when you find a show, you tell Emby to send the show to your PS3/PS4, the PS3/PS4 is listening on the network and gets the request from your Emby server on the LAN and starts streaming the show.\nwith @admwx7 last comment, it all clicked with what he was trying to explain before - seeing as I'm not as well versed with DLNA - I thought DLNA was rather a one way protocol in the sense that your PS3/PS4 can go onto a LAN and find a DLNA server like emby/plex/windows, and browse through the folders for your media, I didn't realize it has the capability of sending out requests from a DLNA server to devices and force them to stream content you've sent to that device via other devices aka mobile/PC.\nFor some people that may work just fine, they may rather use their mobile/tablet/PC to choose shows then send them to the PS3/PS4 etc. What @dantheman213 and some others want is a platform that scales it's UI across all devices. that one UI that's compatible across all devices can still have DLNA features.\nI will say that both options are great, @dantheman213 approach is going to be far more complicated/less coders out there that are willing to contribute, but has the biggest payoffs potentially.\nI'm not a great coder myself, I don't understand all the frameworks/libraries/platforms etc. and their best use cases, but I had figured from researching so much into react/flux(soon to be relay) and immutableJS along with webkit(rather utilize the gibbon netflix approach) and of course nodejs, would create the ultimate JS based multi platform scalable system with the largest developer base available out there in the open-source community.\nEveryone's entitled to their opinions, we have a lot of great options that have been presented and I don't necessarily see any options laid out that have full on road-blocks for cross platform scaling. What I do see is the idea being forked and people going their own ways due to not agreeing with technologies chosen for this project (which is ok!), it's not ideal to have people split off instead of contributing to one project, but to each their own.\nI'm a little worried personally about unity just because i'm not familiar at all with it, not a c#/.net programmer, nor have a lot of experience with the MVC model. I don't doubt that unity can complete this project - it's just how much work is it going to take to build? What is available in the unity world so that the project doesn't have to have every aspect built from scratch? is there a webkit/cordova style alternative SDK that will eliminate the need for a platform engine app to be built across all of these devices? etc.\nIf the building blocks are available in the unity world just like the building blocks are available in the JS world, then I see unity as a learning curve that developers will need to adapt to if they want to contribute to this project. But if tons of stuff has to be built for unity that already exists in the JS world, then  I see it has a detriment to the progress timeline of the project.\n. ",

Also add the Blender Foundation movies, which are (I think) free to host for this purpose. I think there are a few in 4k even - if you can spare the bandwidth. Look for \"Big Buck Bunny\" or \"Sintel\" among others.\n. I would in case of a non-deleting database have a separate table for mapping a username to an actual user, where this username mapping would be invalidated. Then you can create a new mapping for a second user with the same name, and if you then try to undelete the first you get the conflict. And then you can get creative with fixing it.\n. ",

One point - the interface should allow the use of different codepages, otherwise it'll be pretty useless for most non-English subtitles.\nFor the same reason, hopefully there will be an interface to 'assign' subtitles to each film/episode aside from autofetching.

    "gkiko": "The project is going to become really big and hard to maintain with all these supported storage types (AWS S3, Google Drive, etc)\nIt would be better if Streama only supported local file system. Consider that I need to include my Google Drive library. In that case I will write fuse module, that will mount the remote cloud storage into my local file system.\nSo Streama provides beautiful interface to display library and watch movies. Users wtire/reuse fuse modules to meet their needs.\n. @dularion any progress on NodeJs port?\nI desire contributing to your project. But at first I have to learn Grails 2.

Will post results\n. ### protocol fetures\nBest explanation of UPnP basic idea: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1705041/660408\nCling appears to be very generic and strict implementation of UPnP specification. It allows to describe UPnP services, make network requests and deserialise SOAP responses to java objects. While nodecast-js seems to be hiding a lot of protocol related code making it easier to use.\nPopcorn-Time and Wireshark revealed that media content is pulled from DMS(digital media server; we need to implement this) by DMR(digital media renderer; e.g. TV, PS3) which is controlled by DMC(digital media controller; we need to implement this).\n1 . Popcorn-Time(192.168.1.101; DMC+DMS) tells the TV(192.168.1.132) to pull video content from DMS\n```\nPOST /upnp/control/AVTransport HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: text/xml; charset=\"utf-8\"\nContent-Length: 987\nConnection: close\nSOAPACTION: \"urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:AVTransport:1#SetAVTransportURI\"\nHost: 192.168.1.132:52323\nxml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?\n0http://192.168.1.101:54723/<DIDL-Lite xmlns=\"urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0/DIDL-Lite/\" xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:upnp=\"urn:schemas-upnp-org:metadata-1-0/upnp/\" xmlns:dlna=\"urn:schemas-dlna-org:metadata-1-0/\" xmlns:sec=\"http://www.sec.co.kr/\" xmlns:xbmc=\"urn:schemas-xbmc-org:metadata-1-0/\"><item id=\"0\" parentID=\"-1\" restricted=\"1\"><dc:title>Popcorn Time Video</dc:title><res protocolInfo=\"http-get:*:video/mp4:*\">http://192.168.1.101:54723/</res><upnp:class>object.item.videoItem.movie</upnp:class></item></DIDL-Lite>\n```\n\nYou can see that DMC sent http://192.168.1.101:54723/.

I think that we need to implement only media controller. It may be possible to get along without the media server unless we provide media streaming.\nI would be happy if someone more experienced than me could indicate some materials to read about UPnP/DLNA :monkey:\n. It can be considered to be related issues. But there are several reasons \"centralized\" file storage could be better solution:\n1. Torrent file names are incompatible with streama convention: like [torrentname]eps1.0_hellofriend.avi[lang]. Renaming a file to meet streama needs will break seeding\n2. It's centralized and the directory structure can be altered for our needs\nTo be honest, we can still get by without hardlinks.\nPlex naming conventions\n. OK that sounds reasonable. So I have to map every file myself?\nAutodiscovery and manual mapping can be combined\n. I think apiary is a good place to start documenting streama api. It allows to use stub services while the real services are in development\n. @admwx7 as api user I need detailed description of parameters and response statuses. Also examples(curl, httpi) to reproduce requests would be nice :grin:\n. :+1:\n.

Agree. Mounting S3 on your file system is the most straightforward solution.\nYou can give it a try link\n. Do same steps cause the error?\n. Do you know why builds for grails 3 fail on travis ci? Should I investigate?\n. Both branches will have their own .travis.yml\n. I am going to create Dockerfile for streama from Grails base image. No need to run the app inside Tomcat container.\n. Here is new image on docker hub.\nIt takes ~5min on startup. I need more time to investigate. But it will do for proof of concept :whale: \n. I've changed docker image. Version travis-265 image includes single war file. This is different from previous two versions which had whole project with external dependencies as image layer.\n. Travis-ci uses gradle 2.13 which breaks streama artifact. So unless we fix the problem I'll manually generate and upload docker images. A correct way of doing it will be to link 2 docker containers with grails app and mysql. I tried it but couldn't find a way to read grails db connection parameters from system variables.. @calvinturbo this issue still active?\n. I try to trigger the event that causes exception but can't reproduce it. Can you describe step by step how to do it.\nAlso, I found that uploading video suffers from a lot of bugs :bug:\n. I'll mark this issue as duplicate of #217 \n. Hi, can you provide mode details, like your OS and Java version?\n. After some research I found out that the result of episode.getNextEpisode() is Objet type. So if we can type cast it to Episode that will solve compilation error.\nnextEpisode {id {((Episode)episode.getNextEpisode())?.id}}\nTravis builds are failing because of this problem.\nWhere is nextEpisode field returned? Can't check if the fix works correctly because I can't find api that returns json with nextEpisode field.\n. streama works for me as intended\nHow do you run the application? Do you use gradle to produce war and then upload to tomcat?\n. I followed your steps and the application works correctly. Is your mysql database running and configured correctly?\nIf you just want to experiment with the application I suggest that you take a look at docker image. Right now I'm working to automate the image build.\n. This is step 4 output INFO streama.Application - The following profiles are active: production and we require mysql in production environment\n. maybe try this java -jar -Dgrails.env=production-no-mysql streama-0.1.war\n.

Have you tried changing dataSource here https://github.com/dularion/streama/blob/master/grails-app/conf/application.yml#L15. Maybe this is what you are looking for. You need to change User class, add mapping properties and then compile the code. I don't know if it's possible to define mapping from application.yml. You tried this one? https://hub.docker.com/r/gkiko/streama/\nWhat command do you run?. @emresaracoglu \nContainer is attached to the bash session so you can see grails stack trace in your bash window.. @emresaracoglu What steps should I take to reproduce the bug?. @emresaracoglu Do not use whatever/streama image! It's 2 years old. Instead use gkiko/streama and report the stack trace if there is one. You will see it in you bash session. Also explain all the steps that led to the bug. Which docker image did you download? gkiko/streama?. Build pipeline creates the image and pushes it under gkiko/streama. Unfortunately, you can't connect external mysql to it. Current version uses in-memory database and files are stored in volatile storage. So restarting the container results in lost data.\n\nThe problem is that I can't find a way for Grails to read database connection strings from system variables. (Maybe I should ask on SO \ud83e\udd14 )\nNext thing to support is attached volumes so that video files won't be lost after container is restarted.. Quick googling reveals that H2 can also be used a production grade database. So I think we can give it a try. Not sure how performance will change though.\nNow mysql data source accepts environment variables, right? If yes then we can run database in separate container and link it with application container.. Isn't this package imported several lines below?!. 1. This method is very much like the saveAndInviteUser. Code duplication should be avoided(DRY).\n2. And it does more than one thing(SRP). Its name says that.\nI think that you can break both saveAndInviteUser and saveAndCreateUser methods into smaller pieces while eliminating duplicated lines. Write separate methods that creates and validates the user, saves the user and role in database and sends email.\nThis pseudocode will give you an idea on how to start\ndef createAccountWithEmail() {\n  User u = createUser()\n  if (u==null) {\n    return\n  }\n  createRole(u)\n  sendEmail(u)\n  u.save\n} \n@dularion what are your thought on this?. Duplicate of saveAndInviteUser. You can extract anonymous function to eliminate duplication. I think server shouldn't really care about customized error messages.\nYou can only pass username and to check against database records. Send HEAD or GET request and see if user does not exists return 404, if user is in db return 200. Based on server response you can show relevant message on client side.

It will still be used for the invite links, but for the video player it should just work with the relative URL.\n. This change is now merged with master and will be in the v1.5.0 release.. Added in 44a737721d80fba8a7627b5b60a2a757a56e9b73. So I think that the Edge browser will only support .mp4, since it's just a html5 browser. The video player app on the x1 will support the mkvs; but the browser will only support html5 formats. This probably won't be an issue when we implement video converting/transcoding in the future..

I agree. Keeping the migration stuff separate from the main application is a good way to go. Maybe a separate jar distributed with the release when a migration needs to happen. In the main app we just need to check if migration has been completed before we start any database related stuff..

Shouldn't need to, you can place an application.yml file next to the war and it will pickup settings from it.\ngrails:\n    mail:\n        default:\n            from: \"server@yourhost.com\"\nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/blob/master/docs/sample_application.yml. What's the output of java -version on your system?. If java 6 is your default, you'll probably need to run it with /path/to/java1.8/java -jar streama-[version].war I'm not sure where java is installed on macOS, have a look in\n /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/ or \n/Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/. Currently only HTML formats that your browser supports work. Video transcoding/conversion is on the todo list.. Can you post your streama.service?. User=[USER TO RUN APP] is that actually what it's set to? Or did you remove it for privacy?\nTake a look at this one:\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Streama Server\nAfter=syslog.target\nAfter=network.target\n[Service]\nUser=root\nType=simple\nWorkingDirectory=/data/streama/\nExecStart=/data/streama/streama.war\nTimeoutStartSec=120\nRestart=on-failure\nStandardOutput=syslog\nStandardError=syslog\nSyslogIdentifier=Streama\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\nYou probably want to change User=root to a less privileged user too.. User should be set to a real user, I suspect that's where the original issue lies.. A Kodi addon would be great. As far am I'm aware no one is working on one, if someone wants to, go ahead! . Awesome! Can't wait to see it in action. . That's awesome! Nice work. :). I've updated the page to link directly to the wiki for Windows,. I'm confused as to what the issue is. Can you provide more details of the issue?. In Settings set your Base URL to the .onion address you are accessing streama from.. Alright, I don't think TOR will work with the current implementation then. The good news is that I'm going to be changing the Base URL system which will fix this and similar issues (#334). Should hopefully be in the next version.. I'm not entirely sure what you're asking for. I think you want a list of all external links that do not work?. I think I'm on the same page. A file manager is on the roadmap. We should be able to make it check the links as well.. Update to Java 8. What operating system are you using?. sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre. Try this:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk\nIf that doesn't work try this:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer. You should be able to use sudo update-alternatives --config java to set default java. Duplicate of #70. This is in the next version.. It's not wrong, username & password: admin; i.e. both username and password is admin. But I agree that it's not as clear as the linux instructions, so I've updated it to match.. Follow step 8-10: https://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/Installing-as-a-service-from-Git-on-Ubuntu-16.04\nMake sure you update the lines \nWorkingDirectory=/data/streama/\nExecStart=/data/streama/streama.war\nto point to your streama install.. We don't currently have a instructions for 14.04 but you should just be able to create an Init script for streama. There are a lot of tutorials for this, one is below.\nhttps://mobiarch.wordpress.com/2014/05/16/creating-an-init-script-in-ubuntu-14-04/. ## Create a Fork\nClick the \"Fork\" button at the top of the page. Once you've done that, you can use your favorite git client to clone your repo or use the command line:\n```shell\nClone your fork to your local machine\ngit clone https://github.com/USERNAME/streama.git\n```\nDoing Your Work\nCreate a Branch\nWhenever you begin work on a new feature or bugfix, it's good to create a new branch. Not only is it proper git workflow, but it also keeps your changes organized and separated from the master branch.\nTo create a new branch and start working on it:\n```shell\nCheckout the master branch - you want your new branch to come from master\ngit checkout master\nCreate a new branch named newfeature (give your branch its own simple informative name)\ngit branch newfeature\nSwitch to your new branch\ngit checkout newfeature\n```\nNow, make whatever changes you want to.\nCommit the changes\n```shell\nCommit the changes\ngit commit -m \"New Feature\"\n```\nPush them to github\nshell\ngit push\nSubmitting a Pull Request\nOnce you've committed and pushed all of your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the pull request button. If you need to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to GitHub. Your pull request will automatically track the changes on your development branch and update.. Definitely a cool feature. Not sure when we'll be able to do it, but will keep it in mind.. Fixed. Fonts are now local.. Closing as not an issue & no response. . In settings, there's a setting for favico. What version are you on?. A version number would be more helpful but I'm going to assume v1.2.3_beta.\nCould you attach one or two files that don't work?.  I can not reproduce.\n\nDownload https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/download/v1.2.3_beta/streama-1.2.3_beta.war;\nRun;\nUpload video file;\nUpload \"star.srt\";\nNo errors are produced;\nTest playback with uploaded file, no errors are produced.\n\n\n. Closing as no response.. On-the-fly transcoding is something I've been thinking about for a while, but have been working on other issues.\nMy plan was to create a wrapper around FFMPEG to handle the transcoding. When the video player requests the file, return the transcode.. We could build the transcoder to do both pre-transcoding and live-transcoding. Then make it selectable for the user, by default live-transcoding the files so users don't have to think about it on a new install. We could have options like:\n\nNo Transcoding\nLive Transcoding\nTranscode Quality\nMax Simultaneous Streams\nTranscode on upload\nDelete files after transcode\nTranscode previously upload files\nTranscode local files folder\nOutput folder (Same location / Different location)\n\nThen the user would have the power to select what they wanted. For something like a small VPS - use the \"Transcode on upload\" or \"No Transcoding\". For a home server with a powerful CPU use \"Live Transcoding\".\nThe non-live options could be given a lower priority (or have selectable priority) so as to not kill other applications on the system (including streama).\nIf you take a look at the processes when running a Plex transcode it has the following options, which look similar to FFMPEG, I wouldn't be surprised if they were using it as a base.\n/usr/lib/plexmediaserver/Plex Transcoder\n-codec:0 h264 -codec:1 ac3 -noaccurate_seek -i \n/mnt/nas01/media/TV/Rick and Morty/Season 03/Rick and Morty S03E09 The ABC's of Beth.mkv\n-map0:0 -codec:0 copy -map0:1 -codec:1 aac -ar:148000 -channel_layout:1stereo -b:1256k -f segment\n-segment_format matroska -segment_format_options live=1 -segment_time 1 \n-segment_header_filenameheader -segment_start_number 0 \n-segment_list http://127.0.0.1:32400/video/:/transcode/session/ipq0ylx83ajhun6gkwiuaqsq/75278953-211e-4050-8834-dea2dde5b653/seglist\n-segment_list_type csv -segment_list_size 2147483647 -avoid_negative_ts disabled -map_metadata -1 \n-map_chapters -1 chunk -%05d -start_at_zero -copyts -y -nostats -loglevel quiet -loglevel_plex error\n-progressurl http://127.0.0.1:32400/video/:/transcode/session/ipq0ylx83ajhun6gkwiuaqsq/75278953-211e-4050-8834-dea2dde5b653/progress\nFrom this we can sort of tell that passing the video/segments/progress/etc back to Plex via http://127.0.0.1:32400/video/:/transcode/\nAs for system requirements it depends on how many streams the user wants to do at once. A Core 2 Duo 2.0 GHz should be able to do a single 720p transcode. I previously had a home server running a \nintel G1840 that could do two-three transcode playbacks.\nWe should make it as easy for the end-user as possible, I think a solution that is contained within streama would be best and make it the most flexible.. Yeah will definitely do that. If it's just the container that needs to be changed no sense to completely decode and reencode the data.. Nothing really \"new\" but I really want focus on figuring it out.\nI think what I'm going to try is to spawn an FFMPEG process to write a temp file in the correct format when the file is requested and can't be directly played by the device. That way we can support multiple devices and qualities and don't have to store the same video multiple times. You'll just need a few gigs of space to hold the temp file.. Okay so what I'm looking at at the moment is to integrate hls.js and use ffmpeg to generate a hls stream. This will be compatible with:\n\nChrome for Android 34+\nChrome for Desktop 34+\nFirefox for Android 41+\nFirefox for Desktop 42+\nIE11+ for Windows 8.1+\nEdge for Windows 10+\nOpera for Desktop\nVivaldi for Desktop\nSafari for Mac 8+ (beta)\n\nI also want to do detection for direct play videos - so we don't have to create a hls stream if we don't need to.\nWhen I have a working alpha I'll push it to a branch.. I know this is a very highly sought after feature. I had some tests I was working on back in March - nothing close to working. Unfortunately due to some bad hardware I don't have those anymore, not that they were incredibly useful.\nBetween work and personal issues I've haven't had the time or motivation to do much programming, let alone dive into this huge feature.\nI'm really sorry and I do hope to get back to working on streama much more. I have been doing some work on the documentation, something that streama is very lacking in; I hope to publish that this weekend.\nIf anyone wants to help with this feature specifically get in touch with me.. I haven't seen this before. I'll have a look into it when I get a chance, in the meantime if you have more info let us know.. Created wiki page. Sounds like it's doing the same check as what it does for the uploads folder. The local video folder probably only needs read access.. Like how Plex automatically scans your library folders for content? Should be possible.. From the error it looks like it can't find the settings table for some reason.\nAre you using the in-built h2 database or MySQL?. Closing as no response.. Good ideas. We'll keep them in mind for the future.. We don't have any solid answers on minimum requirements yet. That being said I think we have found that it dons't really run on less than 2gb RAM.. That's quite an odd issue. Streama should get this info from the files. Could you run FFprobe on the problem file and post the output?. Also what browser are you using and have you tried on others?. I just did a quick test with Firefox 56.0.1 on Arch Linux and it seems to be showing the correct running time, but the file I was using was only 21 mins long (I don't have full access to my media files where I am right now). Does it only happen with longer files?. Yeah it might be good to see a gif or something. I just tried with a file that was 1 hour 25 min and it was reporting the time correctly in Firefox 56.0.1 on Arch. . Not currently, no. Should be possible to implement, so a future enhancement.. I thought we might be able to have multiple audio tracks in the video container, but switching audio tracks is only directly supported by edge and safarit at the moment :disappointed:  https://caniuse.com/#feat=audiotracks\nWe might be able to support this post video transcoder update, By switching the audio track in the transcoder we can send a compatible stream to the browser.\nBeing able to upload extra audio tracks independently is definitely too much of a hassle though.\nFor the time being having a separate video file per language might be the only way to do it.. It needs theMovieDB API key to get the thumbnails automatically. If you manually create the movie you can edit it after the initial creation to upload the thumbnails. . I feel like more video players these days use f. Makes sense to me.. Sorry @jwcrawley can you please make a new pull but for the master branch.. Duplicate of #440 . You can enable anonymous access. Or are you thinking something more granular where you can say, mark a video as \"public\" and have it viewable by anyone?. It's an interesting idea. Not sure what the best way to implement it would be. Maybe just a flag on the video to mark it as public?. Are they direct links to HTML5 compatible files?. Are you sure that the external server is returning the file as an actual MP4, not as an HTML document? You said that \"it just happens with a specific server\" so it sounds as if that server is misconfigured.. @mazzucato Is this still an issue with 1.4.2?\n  . Try downloading a fresh copy of the streama.war from the releases and run it in its own folder (not directly from your downloads folder). Also for testing do not use an application.yml if you have one.. I can't replicate this. Also on Windows 10 x64, Java 1.8.0_151-b12.\nPlease provide what steps you take (from install to error).\nAlso, this is normal:\nERROR grails.boot.config.tools.ClassPathScanner - The application defines a Groovy source using the default package. Please move all Groovy sources into a package.. Alright yes, this is reproducible with those steps. We'll have to look into it.. Thanks for pointing that out. I'll post a new release when I get home this evening.. Hotfix released\nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/1.3.1_beta. So sorry. Not sure what happened to it... I've uploaded streama-1.3.1_beta_fix.war to the v1.3.1 release page, please give that a go.. Your movies might not be named how the default matcher expects. \nThe two defaults are \nMovie: /^(?<Name>.*)[_.]\\(\\d{4}\\).*/\nTvShow/Episode: /^(?<Name>.+)[._]S(?<Season>\\d{2})E(?<Episode>\\d{2,3}).*/ \nIn order to customize the regex, just add the regex in the bottom of the application.yml like so:\n```yml\nstreama:\n  regex:\n    movies: ^(?.)[_.](\\d{4}).\n    shows: ^(?.+)[._]S(?\\d{2})E(?\\d{2,3}).*\n``\n. Please post the error log from the server console.. Is that the everything in the log.txt file? It looks like that's only the end of it. \nPlease provide the log (via the method mazzucato shows) from when the server starts until after the issue has happened.. I can reproduce on v1.3.2.No signature of method: ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger.debug()` like issue #471. I'll fix it and post a hotfix.\nERROR org.grails.web.errors.GrailsExceptionResolver - MissingMethodException occurred when processing request: [POST] /file/upload.json\nNo signature of method: ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger.debug() is applicable for argument types: (streama.File) values: [streama.File : 1]\nPossible solutions: debug(java.lang.String), debug(java.lang.String, [Ljava.lang.Object;), debug(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object), debug(java.lang.String, java                                                                           .lang.Throwable), debug(org.slf4j.Marker, java.lang.String), debug(java.lang.String, java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object).

Fixed in: https://github.com/dularion/streama/releases/tag/1.3.3_beta. Your MKV File may not totally HTML5 compatible.\n\nUnfortunately, the application does not convert your videos for you (yet!). In order to get the videos working, you might have to convert them yourself. For compatible codecs, see HTML5 Video Browser Support\nIf your videos won't play, make sure that they are HTML5 compatible. A quick and easy test is to open a new empty browser-tab and drag&drop your video file in. If it shows up in a player, then it's a compatible format. If it downloads, it's incompatible.\n\nAs for not being able to upload MKVs, you probably need to add their MIME Type in your application.yml. For the default list see:\nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/blob/master/grails-app/conf/application.yml#L126\nYou already have an issue open regarding the thumbnails. (#455)\n. Closing as a dup of #487 and since this is fixed in 1.4.1 RC2.. I've made a wiki page for running as a service: https://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/Running-as-a-service-(autostart)-on-Ubuntu-15-or-higher. Can you post your server log?. This should work for windows:\n\nStop the Strema server.\nOpen a command prompt window in the folder where you're streama_[version].war is.\nRun java -jar streama_[version].war > log.txt.\nDo the action that causes the error in streama.\nUpload the log.txt so we can view it.. Closing as issues are resolved in 1.4.1 RC2.. We may have to implement some form of rate limiting for the API to keep it under 40req/10sec - especially when doing large operations.\n\nLooking at the code the second error is caused by the first error. Since TheMovieDB API call fails, its variable is null and then we try and get the ID from the null object.\nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/blob/35e542ff32be38669d652947032479b96d579b34/grails-app/services/streama/BulkCreateService.groovy#L175. Closing this in favor of #597. It should just be a matter of installing java, downloading streama, running streama.\nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/Getting-Started-(Windows). Your router may not support (or not be configured for) hairpin NAT.. @shaynethiessen Removing the base URL requirement is something we want to do in the near future.. If your router supports it, you might be able to set port 80 externally forwards to port 8080 internally.\nAlternately you could setup nginx to proxy port 80 and have your router just forward port 80.\nSome ISPs will block port 80 though.\n  . I haven't reproduced this yet. But I do agree, if the system is logging you out, but not telling you you're logged out, it's an issue.. I closed it because you changed the title to fixed.. I'll add video/x-matroska to upload types in the next version. application/octet-stream has already been added to the next version by @dularion.. Closing as fixed in 1.4.1 RC2.. You have to point your domain to your streama server. Probably will also have to setup nginx to have streama on port 80.\nClosing as this is not a streama issue.. Does it not work? I can't find anything in the grails mail docs that have anything specific to windows. Do you get any errors when you try and send?. Does it work using the IP address of the server?. This was discussed in #474\n\nregarding the sound not playing, thats a common issue when files are h264 videoCodec but not AAC audiocodec. It is important that the files are BOTH at the same time. at least thats what always worked for me. Before uploading, there is a way to test this: open a new empty browser-tab and drag&drop your video file in. If it shows up in a player and there is sound, then it's a compatible format. If it downloads, it's incompatible for both. if it only plays the video, but without sound, the audio codec is incompatible.  \n\n\u00a0\nPlease stop opening duplicate issues and in future please use the issue template.. Its seems the DB console does not work for some reason. I'm looking into it.\n\n. Okay, I've found the issue. The URL mappings were overriding the console. I've pushed a commit to master that fixes it (d30d5e528ebb987b6276b2a2a9cb9a910d22af46).\nIf you run in development mode the console is enabled by default. You can enable it in production by setting the below in your application yml:\nenvironments:\n    production:\n        grails:\n          dbconsole:\n            enabled: true\nYou should only be able to access it if you're logged in as an admin. I still wouldn't enable it in production unless necessary.. It depends on your environment and what you have set in your application.yml. \nBy default in production it should be:\nGeneric H2 (embedded)\nurl: jdbc:h2:./streama\nusername: root\n  . You can place an application.yml in the same location as the .war and it will read settings from it. See the sample_application.yml.. RE Conflict with style.css - move changes from style.css into an _reports.scss file as dularion/master now uses the scss-asset-pipeline.. Please don't open duplicate issues. I've replied on #503.. Duplicate of #298.\nThis isn't implemented. If people could just sign up and access your content, can't that get you in trouble? Better to do invite-only.\n  . I think maybe an update icon next to the admin button. Then in the admin area a header that's like \n\"An update is available! Go here to download.\". Good idea!. Will be in the next release :). Currently Streama video support is browser dependent. Video transcoding is something we want to implement, see #440.. Will be in the next version, thanks @mcchan1991. I'm going to create a new issue for extending it to show the next video with a thumbnail and countdown. iOS duplicate of #70. Smart TV duplicate of #75.. Any errors on the sever console or on the app?. I can reproduce this. We will look into it ASAP.. Currently Streama video support is browser dependent. Video transcoding is something we want to implement, see #440.. Thanks for the PR! Looking at the code the fix makes sense, I'll test the PR tonight and merge if it's all good. . PR merged. Not sure about TravisCI, looks like it didn't even run.\nThanks for the PR though! Works great. . Thanks for your input! I'm going to close this now because it's not really helpful and your tone comes across as little demeaning. :). Closing as no response.. We'd really appreciate if you'd use the template and provide a more detailed description of the issue.. Currently not. We may look at being able to add Live IPTV sources in the future but it's not a priority at this time. . What are the errors?. You can set a local directory and then use the bulk add files feature. This won't re-upload any items and use the files right from the set directory.. I just tested this on Windows 10 and can't seem to reproduce it.. Try running from the release .war file instead of building from source? If that works there may be something slightly wrong with your build process.. Agreed. Thanks for pointing that out. I've updated the section.. Thanks for this! It would be nice to extend it to show the next video with a countdown instead of immediately playing it.. Please stop making single issues for multiple problems.\n\nDuplicate of #516.\nMake its own issue.\nMake its own issue.\nA transcoding feature will be implemented, this has been discussed many times. See #440.\n\nPlease stop making single issues for multiple problems. And please give us as much detail as you can about issues.\n. I'm concerned about setting the h2 file to /data/streamadb; doing that will cause issues for people that run the .war without a app.yml.\nIs there a reason docker needs it to be set to /data/streamadb rather than a relative location?\n. This all looks okay to me. I think that having the mysql env is good since a lot of people use it for production, might be better to have an environment for it. That way people can run java -Dgrails.env=mysql -jar streama.war after setting env vars or by changing the app.yml.. I'm not quite sure what the cause of this is. Looks like the server is responding with a 403 error when loading the templates. Just to be clear you're running the .war on a tomcat server (rather than with the one embedded in the .war)? Does the issue occur if you run the .war directly? What do the server side logs say?  . https://github.com/dularion/streama-app. I've added a language select to the edit user modal. So in the next release you can change any users default language including the Anonymous user.\n\n. Glad you like Streama! And thanks for making one post per feature, that's really helpful.\nRelated movies on the detail screen should be possible.. Should be very simple to add. TheMovieDB api already provides this info.. It looks like TheMovieDB has \"collections\" ie for Star Wars the collection has all the movies in it. As long as we have the ability to get that from the API should be able to add it at some stage.. Defiantly possible. I'm thinking like a button next to episodes, shows, and movies that adds to your list. Then the player can just run thought that playlist.. This is mainly about the localFile having the full path streama uses, this is probably only needed to be sent for content manager pages. \nBut also, it does seem the player gets a lot of info it doesn't use, maybe we could trim the fat so requests only get the info that they need.. Try having just this in the application.yml\nenvironments:\n    production:\n        dataSource:\n            driverClassName:  'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'\n            url: jdbc:mysql://localhost/mytestve_Streama\n            username: ## your mysql username\n            password: ## you mysql password\nIf it still uses a H2 database then it mustn't be picking up the yml file, in that case id be looking at the tomcat server to see if it needs config files in another directory or something. I'm not really sure since I'm not really that experienced in tomcat deployments.. Closing no response.. Are you prefixing all your commit messages with emoji?? That is... fucking great lmao.. You have and old java version. Install Java 8.. Thanks!. This is a known issue (#480). But since this is a more concise report and uses the issue template I'll keep this one open.. This is really cool thanks! I'll give it a test hopefully in the next few days and merge if all good.. Would it be a better idea to implement a simple to use API so that admins can build their own payment/plan backend? \nOn streama's side we just expose some simple user create/edit/delete APIs. That way we don't have to support the payment backends ourselves (I'm more than happy to support an API, but I don't really want to deal with hundreds of \"fix my paypal\" or \"please support this very niche payment processor from my country\" issues). \nWe could definitely add some extra things for this like you suggested, like limit the amount of active devices used per user and certain features only be available for certain users.. How about user editable groups? That way from the API you could place people into pre-configured groups. And from the stream admin page you could use the groups too, so it's not API specific.\nStreama could ship with some default groups like we have now: Admin/Content editor/User.. @tipcircle Like I said previously: I don't think streama should be the one that actually integrates the payment processors. We would provide an API or Extention interface that would allow admins integrate whatever payment processor they want. That way you wouldn't be limited any particular payment processor.\n@benno1214 Good idea. We could have some more appearance customisation options in the settings menu.. Discord server : https://discord.gg/CJEHWX9. I can't reproduce with Mac OS X 10.12 16A323 and Safari 10.0 (12602.1.50.0.10). Thanks :). I do like this. I think we could also extend it to provide video transcoding functionality (both live and on upload). This seems like a really good starting point for all transcoding features, I was trying to work on that for a while but hit some roadblocks and also got busy.\nFFMPEG has the ability to send progress updates to a URL, we could use this, along with a domain class to provide progress in the UI.\nMaybe we can merge this into a branch and continue as a team effort?. https://github.com/streamaserver/streama-app. This. We don't really want to be maintaining extra code to mount storage when there are already existing solutions (eg fuse) that are far more robust.. Set your upload directory to an absolute path. EG: C:\\Streama\\upload and make sure the user the server is running as has write perms to this directory.\nThis happens because the path is not relative to the jar location, but to a java temp directory.. My suggestion would be to actually use the issue template and provide the error messages from the console and UI.. Somehow more useless than the last one.\n\nStop deleting the issue template.\nRead the issue template. Read it before you type anything.\nProvide the all the relevant info requested in the issue template. Including the stacktrace, which are the errors in the server console.. Closing because no info provided.\n\nIn future please follow the issue template and provide the error messages from the server/browser.. I don't think this is a good idea for streama, as mention in the article \"This was not an easy trade-off, because every Web site values the ability to contact their \u201ccustomers.\u201d\" We use the emails for invites, so it would be fairly pointless to hash those.\nYou don't even need to enter an email for creating a user manually.. Duplicate of #581. There is an app that might be better for you: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dularion.streama\nBut we still might look at this.. Just to be clear, are you saying that the issue in the screenshot is also happening on the android app and not just the phones browser?. This error means it can't read the file.\n\nDoes the video file exist?\nDoes Streama have permission to read the file?. I can't reproduce with Mac OS X 10.12 16A323 and Safari 10.0 (12602.1.50.0.10). Closed. Can't reproduce / no response.. A raspberry pi is generally too low power to run Streama.\nI've seen similar issues with it talking an very long time to start on other low power machines.\n\nWe generally recommend a modern CPU and 2gb ram. . It's my understanding that grails (the framework Streama is built on) is too heavy for low end systems. If anyone has insight into this it would be appreciated. . Yeah I'm working on some new docs. System requirements will be more prominent.. I've done some research and its looking like there might be a issue in grails that doesn't let it listen on a specific interface. There are some workarounds that we can implement into Streama but there is also the option of running the WAR on Tomcat and configuring Tomcat to only listen on the interface you want.. I think this is a grails issue - you should be able to set it to listen on a single interface, at the moment it binds to all of them. For now running in Tomcat is probably a good solution.. Are you using a proxy? If yes, does it work if you connect directly to streama?\nWhat does sudo systemctl status streama.service say?. We've discussed torrent/webtorrent before and it's just not something that's going to happen. #262, #124.. A stack trace with no other details is pretty useless. In future please actually read and use the issue template that is provided.. Shouldn't be too hard to do.. I highly doubt that this is an issue with Streama. It's more likely to be an issue with the video or the browser.\n\n\"Vlc does display visual artifacts when playing the file and getting to a position, where it should/could hang.\" \n\nThis leads me to believe that the issue is with the video and that VLC is just better at recovering.\nIf you can prove the issue is actually with Streama's implementation please re-open.. Please make one post per feature request, this makes them easier to track and is clearly stated in the issue template. User registration is duplicate of #298.\n. Could you elaborate more on this? I'm not really sure what you mean.. Did you create a database for Streama after installing MySQL?. Yes sorry. Did you add a TMDB API key? If not maybe it trying to access metadata that's not there. I'll test the steps to reproduce and see if I can recreate.. I've tested and can't seem to reproduce the issue on ubuntu or arch. Maybe it's an issue specific to something in openshift?. This should only be an issue on Windows systems yes? Either way we should probably return an error to the UI if there's an issue like this importing a folder or file. . You can customize RegEx the matcher uses (see the bottom of the sample application.yml). But you're right, this whole process needs better documentation.. Going to keep this open to remind me to do the documentation for this.. Thanks!. It is possible, HLS transcoding of media is something I would love to implement.\nClosed as duplicate of #440 . @dularion this looks like an issue relating to the next episode feature.

Googledrive might be a bad example since you can just link it to a folder on your OS using gsync.  An external FTP might be a better reference, but again you can alias that as a folder in Linux.  The only use case I can think of that you wouldn't be able to directly link or alias would be another streaming website.\n.

Unfortunately I can't link you to the actual specifications because they have them behind a \"members\" section on their site, but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance is what I hope to be a solid representation of it.  You'll find a section labeled \"Home Network Devices\" in which it defines Digital Media Renderer (DMR) which is your typical TV or console, and a Digital Media Controller (DMC), which would be streama here.  You navigate around in the pretty UI on your phone, or computer, select the TV show you wish to watch, select your DMR device, then press \"cast\", suddenly your console is playing the TV show you had selected.\n\nWhen it comes to selecting a tool for representing my media library, a mobile \"remote\" is my number 1 priority, followed by chromecast and DLNA support.  I will never use a native app on my xbone since I wouldn't want to install it to begin with, and I wouldn't want to waste all the time messing with my controller when my phone is so much more convenient.\nWhen I say mobile remote I don't always mean a native mobile app since 2 clicks into a responsive web UI is almost as easy as 1 click into a mobile app.\n. I literally linked you to a condensed version of the DLNA spec, and that's what I've been referring to all along, hence why I mentioned playing around with Emby and it's settings...but I created #64 to discuss this since we're flooding an unrelated ticket.\nIf you can think of anything in favor of one or the other then go for it, I can't at this point and need to get back to work anyway.

This has been touched on in #15 to an extent.  Though this would be a better solution than generic URL based third party linking.  However, at that point you're essentially just wrapping their API with a pretty skin, don't know Google's thoughts on that, might want to check into their licensing first.  It would play nicely with chromecast though I bet.\n. It sounds to me more like you just want the UI from streama connected to 1+ google accounts instead of having a backend that can stream to some device, whether it's the one that's viewing the UI or a chromecast or something along those lines.  At that point it would make more sense to create a LITE mobile version that would allow you to connect drive accounts that are stored on the device, then connects to drive and stores meta data about watched status back to drive, and would use an html5 player or connect to a chromecast to stream directly from drive.  Would remove the need for a VPS since everything would be run locally on your phone or streaming through drive.\n\nI haven't looked at Google's licensing for drive so I'm not going to claim knowledge of their T&C for usage and streaming from their platform, but my guess would be that the responsibility all falls on the user, not the developer as long as you're not trying to do anything malicious, just felt the need to mention that it's something to keep in mind when you're looking to interface with another service like that.\n. Would be pretty easy to have the UI save to local storage and the api at\nthe same time and fetch from both, api getting priority if it's configured,\nthen running mobile or desktop without a configured server back-end would\nprovide that same functionality without a lot of extra code.\nOn Mon, Aug 3, 2015, 6:26 PM worlddev notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nyeah you are right in the sense that you don't really need a VPS then.\nrather just something like a cordova based app platform that has a nice UI\nand allows you to connect to your google drive accounts and import the\nhotlinks.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/issues/60#issuecomment-127430502.\n. :+1: for modularity\n\nOn Tue, Aug 4, 2015, 12:05 PM Michael Stramel notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nNot that I'm particularly interested in it but I always am in favor of\nmodular code.

However, if you don't believe me, give emby a try, switched over from Plex ~ 3 months ago, relatively painless and doesn't require you to kill your plex server even!  You can use their \"Select a Player\" section to select DLNA devices to play directly to, as it's describe in the Wiki page I linked earlier.\n. The key is that you just turn your DLNA device on and make sure it's got DLNA turned on with a valid video player installed (in the case of xbone).  Pretty much if your console can search the server for media then it should be able to get media pushed to it through the DLNA protocol.  After that you just use the web interface or your mobile app to do all the controlling, which I'm not a fan of using a controller for navigation to begin with so it's preferable for me.\n. https://github.com/dantheman213/ambrosia\n\nIf you want to get in on the action\n.

(Amazon, Google Drive, MediaFire, Anything with a direct link to the file lol)\nYou should be able to just set the player SRC to point to the file. And then of course we need a tab instead of upload to say something like \"remote\" and just put a link there.. Hi,\nFor sites like OpenLoad and MP4Upload (These two sites are used the most) they require that you use their embedded video player because it plays ads in the video player, in exchange you get to host the video for free/unlimited with them.\nIf you could add a third option that would accept a HTML embed code for their video player or something of that sort that would work great! Here is an embed example of a video I have in my MP4 Upload account:\n<IFRAME SRC=\"https://www.mp4upload.com/embed-76gtlrahpmt1.html\" FRAMEBORDER=0 MARGINWIDTH=0 MARGINHEIGHT=0 SCROLLING=NO WIDTH=1920 HEIGHT=1080 allowfullscreen></IFRAME>. Sometimes, It is possible to play the file from within your custom video player directly but you would have to write a script to basically..\n\nGenerate a link request to the remote host (MP4 Upload)\nGrab the actual CDN Edge Server video link\nUse that as the SRC to play the video File\n\nThen that link will eventually expire, which is why it would have to generate a request each time the user clicks on that episode/video. It is quite a bit work, the same method is used above to pull a video straight from the Edge CDN server for Google Drive videos instead of actually embedding from Google Drive (which has limits) a-la something like this: http://api.getlinkdrive.com/\nBut again this is a lot more work, and it would most likely be easier to find a way to just allow a HTML player embed instead.. Any chance you can update this? :D. Actually, A pull request you have open already fixes this error. Woops.. I can confirm this as well, looks like the box container is missing or something.... ",

It is a \"nice to have\" feature, but I agree with @sylflo on the fact that Streama is often used in such small user groups that this is borderline unnecessary and will be most likely unused by most users. @Arjenlodder I'm experiencing the same issue ( #718 ). Could you please attach your full application.yml and tell me which version of Streama are you using? Are you running inside Docker? Are you using an external MySQL DB?. I will try to investigate this once I get hold of an Android. The first step would be to see what's going on with the HTTP traffic.\n@JochemTSR could you sent me the credentials via email?.

A prerequisite for this feature is to be able to externalise some essential parts of the streama configuration.\nThe Docker way of managing app settings is to use environment variables. The streama Grails application should somehow manage to read settings from the following environment variables:\n- [ ] DataSource.groovy related:\n  - MYSQL_HOST\n  - MYSQL_PORT \n  - MYSQL_DB \n  - MYSQL_USER\n  - MYSQL_PASSWORD\nI suppose there will be a need for other environment variables, but for now those are the one from the top of my head.\nOnce streama will be able to start from a war taking into account those environment variables, a Dockerfile will be easier to come up with.\n. > I agree with all of the above, except for base_url\nlist of variable updated\n. I do a bit of sysadmin as part of my job, and I find it more convenient to configure all environment related settings with just an external config file or environment variables. As a sysadmin I don't want to have to know some of the application internals to be able to have it set up correctly ; In other words, it is not convenient to have to figure out where in the database should a setting be set.\n. I agree drawing the line to tell apart settings which are system related from those that are application related can be tricky for some of those settings.\nAnyway, other thing to consider is the ease of implementation for the docker image. It is straight forward to come up with a docker image that manages all settings as environment variable. However if the docker image would be to write some data in a mysql database on first boot, that would start to be a mess (init shell script, wait for db to be up before updating, etc)\n. ok, todo list updated in 1st comment\n. Don't worry, we just have to agree on a starting point. We'll come up with a 1st docker image and once it starts to be used suggestions will pour ;)\n. Video files MUST be on a mounted volume as the docker container layered file system (copy-on-write) isn't providing good read/write performances in most cases.\nAlso, best practices encourage docker containers to be disposable. That implies docker containers must not persist data themselves, they are just holding the application code/binaries and running them along with conf (from environment or mounted conf file). This also complies with the 12 factor app manifesto.\n. For the database, it would be another container dedicated to provide the mysql service. The official mysql docker image gives instructions on how to persist the mysql data. \n. @lhw, maybe http://johnrellis.blogspot.fr/2010/11/grails-quick-tip-external-configs.html?m=1 could change that \n. I like the way @whatevercode implemented this with the docker section in DataSource.groovy\n. ",

Here is a first version I created a few hours ago https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/r0lhw/docker-streama/\nNo guide yet but you can link a mysql container into the streama container with the standard docker way. Don't forget to set STREAMA_DB_(NAME|USER|PASSWORD) or let it go to default.\nFor the upload space you obviously have to mount a data volume somewhere and reference it in the settings.\n. The only thing I don't really like about my version is that due to the config being compiled into the code it needs to compile the config on each start as the host/ip etc might change between starts. And I currently don't see a way around it if one doesn't want code in the config file.\nAs it stands I would prefer my setup as it can produce reproducible/automated builds and builds from source. I could change it to work with your change to the DataSource.groovy tomorrow.\n. @whatevercode already added an extra environment to the datasource which would allow for an ENV based config. I'll do a pull request later to change those names to the corresponding default ENVs and then the recompile wont be necessary anymore.\n. Mhm I tried updating my docker image too the new environment in DataSource and I also fails to create the tables, same as the @whatevercode image. Anything I am missing here? Shouldn't these frameworks try an automatic migration/creation of the tables?\nedit I also updated my master branch which still builds the config file on every startup. It works fine.

It would be amazing just to be able to hotlink the streamed videos (in varying qualities) from Google Drive directly to the HTML5 player, saving the bandwidth of the strema server..

Update: I'm using it on a t2.micro (1 core, 1GB of RAM): it's works like a charms.\nSo, do someone use it on a Raspberry Pi Mod 3?\nI would like bring it in local.\n@dularion: it's fantastic, good work!\nBye!.

    "jdollar": "@lach015 I would agree with @gkiko. It sounds like your java isn't setup correctly.\nWhat OS are you compiling from? Is it linux or windows? Do you have your JAVA_HOME setup and have it pointing to your jdk bin folder in your path? What happens when you run \"javac -version\" in your terminal/command prompt?\nPlease note from the grailsw files:\nLinux = TOOLS_JAR=\"$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar\"\nWindows = set TOOLS_JAR=%JAVA_HOME%\\lib\\tools.jar\nIf the JAVA_HOME isn't set as an environment variable properly you can see that error.\n. @the4ndy The java version you need would be the jdk.\nFor a quick overview you'll need to install a jdk (openjdk should be fine) then locate the installation directory. On my arch, debian and centos machine it is located at /usr/lib/jvm/INSTALLED JDK where INSTALLED JDK would be the jdk you just installed with apt-get install.\nafterwards you'll want to add this line to your .bashrc:\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/INSTALLED JDK\nThen to ensure those changes are populated to your current session:\n. .bashrc\nThat should be all you need to setup the JAVA_HOME on your ubuntu machine. You can also check out the wiki for this project on the Centos setup. It has a section similar to the above for installing the JAVA_HOME and it should translate over to ubuntu sans issues.\nI believe the default JAVA_HOME is only setup for Mac OSX (darwin machines) and cygwin. I don't believe the default gradle wrapper takes into account other versions. I'm not 100% sure if it would be possible to change that. Since it changes with the gradle versions it might not make sense to make any changes to that file.\nPS:\nI checked out the script in the wiki about the ubuntu install and the installed jdk location is: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_65/. You should be able set the following in your .bashrc in order to set your JAVA_HOME if you still used that script:\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_65/\nThen just reload the .bashrc. \n. I'm glad you were able to resolve the JAVA_HOME issues! :)\nFor the Issue relating to navigating to the streama instance I just have some general questions:\nWhen generating the war it is in the same fashion as the ubuntu wiki install where it is named ROOT.war placed in the tomcat webapp directory correct? I am guessing since you got the tail of the logs it is, but just to make sure. If it isn't named ROOT.war then localhost:8080 would not work. If it is something like streama.war and placed in the webapp directory it would be localhost:8080/streama for tomcat.\nYou mention the war is on a remote server, is the remote server the ubuntu machine? Are you trying to access the war that is on the remote machine from your desktop or from that remote machine? I ask because you mention using localhost:8080 to try and access the war, but if the war is on a remote machine then you would have to use the IP address of the machine with the port number. Most likely something like 192.168.XX.XX:8080. \nWhen you run nmap what ip are you hitting? localhost or the one for the remote server? Do you have a firewall running on the remote server? Iptables or firewalld?\n. Removed my comment on the database connection, because after thinking about the issue since the database should be on the same ubuntu machine it should be fine just having the root user for localhost. Was thinking the database was on a different machine and thus needed remote access to the root account. Misunderstanding on my part.\nThe blank page when navigating to the url could still be an issue with your streama instance connecting to the database. Do you have any errors on the server log that states anything relating to errors instantiating the session factory?\n. I'm 99% sure the issue is with the database. I believe there is another issue flying around with the docker image relating to it not correctly creating the database tables so I'm not entirely sure how stable to docker image is at the moment.\nIn the wiki instructions for ubuntu and centos on the mysql instance you have to create the streama database before anything\nCREATE DATABASE streama;\nI haven't seen any information relating to the docker file creating the database, but can you check the mysql server to see if it does indeed have a streama database? Otherwise you might have to create it yourself.\nThe default log for tomcat is under your tomcat installation/logs/catilina.out. Checking that file to see if there are any errors would be helpful as well.\n. --- lots of dots\n  --- it makes a lot of files uglierer\nMade me chuckle a little. :)\nRegarding the error, the relevant section from the catalina.out is:\ncom.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: Unknown database 'streama'\nI know your steps included:\n- run mysql> CREATE DATABASE streama;\nbut to double check if the database was created I would try logging into mysql and run the following to see if indeed the database was created:\nSHOW DATABASES;\nIf it was it should show the database streama in the results. Otherwise try rerunning your create database command while logged into mysql again. It shouldn't be an issue with the username/password for the mysql as it would normally detail that in the output. It just sounds like the database isn't there.\n. Very awesome to hear that the issue is resolved!\nSomeone else might have more to say on the documentation and where to incorporate details, but I would think now that you have gone through the steps and documented it fairly well it looks like you should have the best ideas of where the current process slipped you up. Out of anyone I would imagine you would have the best point of view on what you think the instructions might be lacking and any additions you feel necessary I am sure would help the documentation.\nFor the pull request I believe there are a few issues/enhancements on the project that might be worth tackling for the hacktoberfest (After seeing the link you shared I just signed up myself. I like a free shirt!). Might be able to find something there to contribute. Also I'm not entirely sure how active it is, but on the readme there is a badge for the glitter chat for this project. Someone more knowledgeable than I might be there to talk more about the project, its status and where help might be needed.\n. Researched a tiny bit into this issue and this link: https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/tomcat-users/201206.mbox/%3C4FD492E9.6040109@ice-sa.com%3E sounds similar and could potentially be caused by tomcat looking at the wrong installation directory using the Catalina variables.\nThis stack overflow explains the variables a little more in detail http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3090398/tomcat-catalina-base-and-catalina-home-variables\nFrom the link @dularion provided for installing tomcat7 the base and home variables are the same probably because it is for a server running a single instance. Those variables are also pointing at the share directory like your error above. Can you check the variables  CATALINA_BASE and CATALINA_HOME to see the locations they are pointing at? You are running a single instance of tomcat right? Then can you see where tomcat is installed to in order to see if it matches your variables to /usr/share/tomcat7 or if it was installed at /var/lib/tomcat7?\n. ",

    "edinhojorge": "Hi dularion, thanks for your response. \nI'm using as a home user, and didn't try other users, but I think that is better if each user can choose what is the best language, and have a default set as first one.\nJust to go a little deep, I think there are some points to consider:\n- When I do a search in other language, I normally use the movie title in that language. Sometimes the title changes even in the meaning, like \"Daddy's home\" is \"Pai em dose dupla\" (something like Father double dose), but there's no description in portuguese, only in english. Would be nice to have english as a fallback language when the description or some other relevant data is not found.\n- Maybe some local movies has only data from its native language, like french. It wold be nice if streama checks for the movie country and search for this description when the chosen language and english fail.\n- The fallback language could be a global set.\n- Labels/menus/streama could also be prepared to be translated as well.\nI know some of the implications and it is a large step to make all these points to work, and if streama can start with movie translation and searches, it would be great.\nBest regards,\nEder\n.

    "tnguyen14": "I just saw this https://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/Local-Streama-Setup#video-playback\nSo basically WebM and MP4?\n. @dularion thanks. So for the same video, I should have it be exported to different formats in order for it to work across browsers?\nAlso, how should the videos be organized in the data directory?\n. I think I was confused before. Streama will actually do the uploading and organizing itself of the videos, right? So it's not like I would be putting the videos somewhere and streama would read from it.\n. I just tried using Handbrake to encode a video to h264 and AAC for audio. Yet, when I upload the video to streama, I get this error:\nThere seems to be a problem adding the video-file to the player. This is most likely due to a codec-problem. Try converting it to a compatible HTML5 codec, remove the currently attached file and re-add it. If the codecs are fine, check the error log of the server.\nIs there any suggestion on what I could do?\n. I followed the guide you have here https://gist.github.com/dularion/6237d651c385d2552916, using the same command. I ended up with the same error as well..\n. I think #15 would address this.

    "the4ndy": "EDIT: I see a portion was added to the instructions about the JAVA_HOME issue. I ran the script as mentioned in the edit but got errors and I believe the reason is the unexplained other changes the author made...ie \"(along with some additions to ~/.bashrc)\"\nPlease share these changes, this is a most frustrating issue as the Java documentation is poor :(\n. Ok, I understand there is debate over if those instructions should be in your instructions....if its needed to be known to make your software work, it might be worth mentioning.....however, I will do what your suggest, uninstall and re-install Java.....can you be more specific though when you mention Java....is it the JDK, the javac, java, there are like many many java packages on my server. And i do not know where the problem could have arrised, I have tried from a fresh Ubunutu 14.04 image on multiple occasions and follow the instructions to the letter... :( I just dont know what i am doing wrong other than being given some incomplete instructions, which is fine, if you dont have the time or effort to be walking the noobs like me through install then so be it, but maybe i warning or a hey, you need to do this on your own, message.\n. You sir are a gentleman and a scholar. You have helped me greatly and I am indebted to you. I have resolved the JAVA_HOME issue and was able to successfully build my WAR file, i moved it to my remote server and restarted the tomcat7 service, tailed the log file, waited for the \"Server startup\" line and navigated to localhost:8080..however, i was greeted with a blank page :disappointed: A quick nmap scan of my server shows port 8080 open and the service Tomcat/Coyote running. I have spun up a whole new server and meticulously gone through the steps again, this time being able to resolve the JAVA_HOME issue much easier, but still ending up with the same result....any assistance with this is greatly appreciated. Thanks\n. i am performing all of the installation steps on a \"remote\" server. The server is only remote in that it is an Ubuntu VM on a server on my LAN. This is my local network to which I am the administrator and to be honest there are no interior firewall rules at all (only perimeter to which does not apply cause this is all done on the LAN). I am leaving it named ROOT.war as the instructions mention. the IP of the machine is at 10.0.0.7 in my case and has a statically set IP address. there are no firewall rules configured on the server outside of a standard Ubuntu 14.04 server install (which I believe is none, I have checked the ufw and it is disabled). Also, I have run the nmap from my machine on the LAN as well as from the localhost itself. \nIn an effort to avoid mistake in the couple steps it takes to deploy on a server, I have instead tried to use the docker images, and while my experience with Docker is limited, I have followed their instructions on installing their software and have confirmed via the metrics provided by Docker that my installation was successful and with no errors. I then install Tomcat and mysql-server (apt-get install tomcat7 msql-server) and i leave the root password blank. I then run the single docker command modified with root as the user and blank as the password (i have tried it with the defaults, and with the root password as \"password\" without quotes and even tried making a user \"streama\" with password \"password\"). I also have to add an additional tack \"-\" on to the -name=\"stream\" flag or else docker throws up errors. Ultimately, the end result is near identical, a blank website.\nThanks again for your help!\n. I am not an SQL guy, my DB knowledge is limited. However, I can say that I have tried the Docker setup both with creating my own DB and without, both have the same, blank page result. And when I create the DB, I am using the command mysql> CREATE DATABASE streama; which is taken straight from the installation instructions on this GitHub Repo. Other than that though I do not do any additional MySQL configuration (I am under the assumption that if it was needed it would be stated).\nI will cease trying the Docker builds for now and will give the remote installation another couple of trys. I will thoroughly examine the output of the catalina.out file and will post anything I find that may be the problem (or perhaps Ill share the whole output, it may be easier).\nThanks again for the help.\n. just did another fresh setup and documented my process thoroughly. In the end I got a pretty bad looking error in the log that is requested to be tailed. \nI have pasted the errors here: http://pastebin.com/SG3BqMLW\nand my step by step here: http://pastebin.com/Ubr6arnS\nHopefully this can shed some light on my mistake along the way. Again my sincerest thanks for your assistance. It goes much appreciated. \n. oh shit! it was the database, like you said, it wasnt there, and i am an idiot when it comes to databases\nthe trick was that you need to log in the mysql as the root user first\nmysql -u root -p\nit will prompt for password, in my case it was blank, so enter and move on\nthen you get the mysql> prompt\nfrom that prompt then type CREATE DATABASE streama;\nthen SHOW DATABASES; for good measures\npat yourself on the back and feel like a DB admin\nnow start tomcat and #BOOM it works!\nI intend to do a nice write up on getting this working, a supplement to the current install guide, a noob edition i guess you might call it....but I thought maybe I could just ask you guys if there is a proper way to incorporate more detail into the current instructions. I am not a github master, some direction on how to help out would be awesome.....and also, if there is a way I can get a \"pull request\" out it that would help me as I am working towards the Digital Ocean Hacktoberfest and need to get a number of those (https://www.digitalocean.com/company/blog/hacktoberfest-is-back/), if not, i still want to try and add some of the findings and information I discovered / was taught along the way into the instructions or documents of this project so that it can help others in the future. This project is AWESOME by the way. Thanks again!\n. it is an ubuntu server 14.04 VM so there is no GUI so i access it via another linux box on the same LAN at the URL 10.0.0.7:8080 I have tried in Chrome and Firefox. after a reboot of the machine i can \"connect\" to the server but the page that i get in my browser is empty, no source no nothing :(\n. Why does that IP not look right? My private LAN is on the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet and I have statically assigned 10.0.0.7 to my Ubuntu VM. I apologize if I did not make this clear before, this is being done entirely on my private LAN. I will tackle opening this server up to the web when the time comes. If the app does not run on a local network I can move ahead with giving it a live IP and making it web facing, just let me know. \nIs there any sort of Log or output I can provide that might help you discover what is going on? I have also tried accessing the web app via the localhost:8080 URL from the GUI-less server using a console based web browser (lynx) but it provides the same result, a blank page or timeout.\nCould there perhaps be some configuration needed in Tomcat that is preventing this from working? I install tomcat via apt-get install tomcat7 and follow any other instructions explicitly stated in the directions, but beyond that, I do not touch Tomcat or MySQL at all (as I am not certain if tinkering will break the app, though my plan is to tinker once the app works and see what custom settings I can apply without breaking the functionality of the app).\nAgain, my apologies for being difficult, you have been a great help. Thanks!\n. The issue I believe is that the database is not created. I do not know if I, the user, need to create the database or if docker creates it for me, that at least to me was not clear in the instructions and I am for sure a beginner at this. I intend to try to make my own sql db and then run the docker command and see if that works....i will report back with my findings. And i would very much like to help by improving the documentation / instructions for installing via docker (as well as via remote server).\n. ",

Hi Antonia,\nThank you for your reactivity. I tried the solution you gave but it didn't work. I think the issue I'am dealing with is not related to the video codec.

I've just quickly get some info from this repository.\n\"The problem is that I can't find a way for Grails to read database connection strings from system variables. \" As I've seen this app is based on spring-boot (grails is top on spring-boot).

There is a reason it should be relocated: /data is persistent volume in this case, so the DB is persistent too.\nWhen I wrote \"Production H2 file moved to another path (docker persist it). You should consider other options, like create docker profile.\" I realized it will broken current releases, that's why I said one should consider other options... now it looks like one will be me. Wait some minutes. :). You're right. mysql data source can be now configured with environment variables.\nJust for my 2 cents, I don't even use mysql for this purpose (when you say production grade I do not associate mysql :) ). postgresql or mariadb would be better choice, but NoSQL like MongoDB would be the best. I do not research what this application stores in db but I suppose it is something like settings and metadata for videos..

    "Flex101": "Possibly the same on the dashboard too, as you are likely to want to see the most recent additions first?\n. fixed the second part\nHi dularion. To what extent was this fixed?\nI just deleted a show (from the show's page in manage content) and none of the files were deleted.\nI had to delete them (over 100) via the File Manager, using the \"Only Non-Associated Files\" section.\nAm I doing it wrong?. I'm getting this message every time I view the dashboard with an account that doesn't have content manager permissions. Still appears with admin permissions.\n. I don't think it has anything to do with my database because some episode descriptions I have now have the angled quotations in them and Streama is displaying them fine. So I was wrong when I said Streama doesn't support the characters, it does. But something about the process of pulling the descriptions from TheMovieDB has changed, which now causes the angled quotations to be converted \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd along the way.. Looks much better in v1.0.19 (from the release page).\nHowever, I think the total number of episodes maybe including deleted episodes.\nI have a number of shows showing a few episodes too many - for example, showing 10/11 episodes uploaded when only 10 episodes exist.. The uploading of your own thumbnail for episodes is a duplication of issue #216\nThe red triangle issue on tv shows is a duplication of issue #285. Duplication of issue #285.

    "Shrinks99": "@dularion This issue can be closed!. Was this included in V1.1?. Those extra episodes should be fetched if I were to tell the program to\nfetch all seasons.  This happens when I re-fetch a single episode of a show\nfrom the movie database.  Furthermore the episode of Season 0 that is added is not a real \"Season 0\" episode for the show and it has no description and doesn't actually fetch anything from the database.\nThis is definitely a bug!. Sure, here's a video.\n. You need to set the base url to your internal ip in the Streama settings.  The base url is the url that you will use to access streama through, in your case it will most likely be 192.168.x.x .. > I think its how Streama indexes the files you add, sort of creates a internal link between the file and the database\nYeah, that's exactly how it works and it's definitely easier.  The only issue with it is that it results in poor file organization if somebody wanted to transfer their media elsewhere.. I figured it was done by file hashes.  If the program automatically renames things (and maybe also puts TV shows in to folders with seasons also organized by folders) duplicate file names shouldn't be a huge issue.  When content is uploaded check for duplicate items and add a 1 if there is a duplicate?  Using rsync and choosing the file rather than uploading it through the web interface makes a lot of sense with the current system but it's not the most user friendly and all.. Here's the file\n```\nDescription=streama\nAfter=syslog.target\n[Service]\nUser=[USER TO RUN APP]\nExecStart=/data/streama/streama.war\nSuccessExitStatus=143\nConditionPathExists=/data/streama/streama.war\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n``.User=[USER TO RUN APP]` is what it's actually set to.  I will try your config.. I suspect that is the problem with my config.  Interesting that it still works without an actual user but I'll change it to yours instead.. Will this transcoder support multiplexing video?  No need to actually transcode a file that is already in H264, sometimes an MKV container just needs to be changed over to an MP4.\nThis basically just takes way less time and CPU power while changing the file type and not reducing the video quality as far as I understand it.. You can set up a DDNS service and use one of the many free domans  on that site so that your server IP is constantly accessible from outside of your LAN.  Alternatively buy a cheap domain and do the same thing.. You can't.  I believe this will be amended in Streama 1.3 but you're stuck choosing one or the other until then.. This is already a feature: http://dularion.github.io/streama/#live-sync. Pull requests are not the place to leave feature requests, please see the issues tab for that.  Also format support is browser dependant.. Perhaps something like this?\n\nAll elements on hover:\n\n. This would be an interesting application for IPFS with the external server and the original server acting as both a gateway and a content host.. Looks nice, perhaps a few options could be given to users in the profile settings?. System requirements should probably be posted in readme.md.  I have no problem running it on a Pentium 4 and 2GB of RAM is probably a solid place to start at.. Streama uses your browser's video player with some additions to give it a nice front end.  IMO this is out of scope and the bug report would be better for the browser you are using, not Streama itself.. Perhaps the video player should be placed inside the main repo as a submodule?. ",
    "JanneNiemela": "I meant originally deleting from inside the dashboard, but now that you mention it, the modal popup could be actually a better option usability-wise. The movie icons might become too full of different buttons if a delete option was added there.\n. Hello,\nI meant the popup that appears when you click the \"Create new Movie\" -button. Adding video file- and subtitle options directly to this popup might make adding movies a bit faster. Currently the user has to fill in two different popups to upload a video, while they could be combined into a single form. \nA screenshot of the popup: http://imgur.com/mPdZpon\n. Good point. It's probably better if the current popup stays open.\nIf you plan to change the popup later on (for example by combining the movieDB info popup form with the file management popup), it might be better to close it (or minimize it) after the user presses the Save button. The user could select the video's information and subtitle settings before confirming the upload. This way the user could move on to next task while the video is uploading in the background.\n. ",

    "jsniemela": "Hey,\nIt does seem to work that way. I thought it would also re-fetch episodes that have been deleted from a season. Would that be a good addition? It might be a good idea to give some kind of a notification if the re-fetch is successful or not. Also it would be nice if it could automatically notify if there are new episodes available before the user clicks anything.\n. Yeah, that's what I meant. The only ways to add a deleted episode back into a season seems to be to delete the whole season and add it again or to add the episode manually. At first I thought this was what re-fetch was meant for. \n. This happens because the getFileSrc function in UploadService adds another forward slash. Currently the default Base URL already has a forward slash at the end, so it doesn't work.\n. Hey,\nWhenever I use \"Fetch all episodes for a season\", I see the loading animation, but the actual results don't appear until I click another link and then go back to the TV Shows page. It seems to work otherwise, but the page isn't updated after it's ready. \n. There's a new small bug with the update where it creates a \"season 0\" when fetching episodes for season 1. It doesn't seem to happen when adding a later season before the first one or if the show already has one of the later seasons added before season 1. Also, the page doesn't fully update when adding a later season, it only shows the \"re-fetch season\" and \"delete season\" buttons until switching to another page and back.\n. The idea is that you could drop a movie into the list of movies or episodes, which would open up the pop-up asking for the name/details. This would eliminate a couple of extra steps from the process and it seems intuitive to me.\n. It's still possible to create a broken video in Other videos by leaving the name empty, but I don't think it breaks the application anymore.\n. ",

Right ? If that is so, i'm not in favor of this. I choose streama because i can avoid client programs (like kodi)\nCould you elaborate more on your idea? \nTranscoding takes time but when your whole library is in the right format (which will take me like 3-6 months) then adding a few new films is not the problem anymore. So while i think the idea with many transcoding hosts is good for the initial conversation of the movies, i doubt it has any real use after your bulk of files is encoded in the right format. \nAfter all a decent machine can convert 5 movies in one day, so at least for me i don't see the application after the initial transcoding.\n.

    "srwareham": "Hi, I'm not a developer on this project, but I think I can confidently tell you what you are looking for is not going to be possible any time in the near future. \nFrom the little I have played around, streama seems to use the .webm container as an encoding target. This is done so that your browser can playback videos using the html5 video standard. There are a few choices for which container / codec formats are supported by the html5 implementation for most major web browsers but many of these are non-free. I have had the fortune of not needing to muck around in the legalities of such licenses, but it is quite possible that mp4, for example, cannot be supported by streama without acquiring an expensive license--certainly an unlikely eventuality for a (presumably) low-to-no budget open source project. It is also possible the developer, as many do, has a strong preference for \"free\" software and will not use non-free software when a free analog exists.\nThe reason this is relevant is because the webm container has very specific requirements for which codecs it supports. Specifically, it supports vorbis and opus for audio, and vp8 and vp9 for video. The less than ideal performance you are seeing is because the current implementations for encoding to vp8 and vp9 are not very fast. The only way for your conversion speed to increase would be for the core developers of the vp8 and vp9 codecs to devise a new implementation that is much more efficient (or for hardware makers to create hardware-accelerated implementations). Alternatively, the developer for this project could add support for other containers / codecs, but as mentioned above this is likely not possible.\nSpeculation: The original conversion speed you are seeing is likely an artifact of implementation details (by the encoding software used, not streama). That is to say that you are never actually processing frames at that speed, it likely is an inaccurate representation of encoding speed caused by funky measurements in the beginning, or by counting headers and low-overhead muxing as \"frames per second\" somehow.\nTL;DR: Restrictive licenses for standard containers necessitate the use of open alternatives. These open alternatives have not caught up in terms of encoding speed.\n. ",

That's great, thanks. I do agree that the whole base path config doesn't make complete sense to me, since to get onto Stream you are accessing that base path and you could just use that for all of the video playback URLs. But I haven't properly dived into the code so there might be a reason behind it. \nPlease keep me posted!.

Hi, \nI can't see your screenshots unfortunately. However, I can maybe guess what problem you're experiencing as I believe I had the same thing at first. When you change the IP address in the admin section, do you scroll back up to the top of the page and click on \"Save\"? Clicking on the check mark next to the Base Url field doesn't actually save the change, it just verifies that it's a valid Url. In order to save the change, make sure you scroll to the top of the page and Click on the Save button in the top right corner. . So even after saving your settings, the IP changes back to the default one? . Right, but since the videos that are initially available for viewing on your Streama were uploaded by yourself (i.e. the admin), don't you theoretically have the ownership rights on these videos? Of course we are talking about the ideal case here, but since you are the one who is making this content available (and you have access to the actual files since you're uploading them in some way) it would make sense that technically you would have secured all of the rights for these files. \nBut I'll keep an eye out on #262, that issue is interesting on its own. Beauty. Thanks for considering this and for all of your hard work in general. This is fantastic. \nIs this part of RC2, or will it be part of the official release? If the latter, do you have an idea of when that would be?. Awesome! I'll update tonight when I get home. \nI'll close the issue for now and re-open if anything is wrong. Thanks again! . Hey @dularion, \nThe feature is looking good. One (non-blocking) recommendation I would make is the naming of the downloaded file. Currently it just uses its DB ID as the name. What are your thoughts on maybe calling it either the movie/file name for movies/other videos, or Show S01E01 - Title for TV shows? There would need to be a check to make sure that illegal characters aren't included (One example that comes to mind is : would need to be replaced by something like -). \nAgain, not a huge deal if you want to keep it the way it currently is. If you are interested in changing, I can either re-open this issue or create a new one. Whatever works best!. I quickly tested it and it looks good! So far nothing has broken for me (keep in mind I have only tested local file links as this what I am currently using). The file names are working nicely for me (I'm on Chrome). \nI'll close this for now, and re-open if I have any problems with it. And I'll open another issue if I run into a bug on RC4. Thanks! . Confirmed it's fixed! Thank you!. Fantastic! This was something I had brought up back in January last year and I tried to solve by myself but did not have the necessary knowledge to understand what was going on. I checked your PR though, it seems so simple I can't believe I couldn't do figure it out... In any case, thank you!. Hi, \nSorry for the delay, I was trying different things on my end to try to fix it. \nMost of my videos are either avi which won't play in the player, or mkv, which will play but very often start skipping 2-3 minutes in. So I thought I would go through the (painful) process of converting them to mp4, which up until now didn't show any problems with the player (I had some videos that were mp4 by default and they seemed to work fine). \nI converted them using Handbrake, I pretty much used the standard settings. I've tried checking the \"Web Optimized\" box as well on Handbrake. It seems like every video coming out of Handbrake is experiencing this problem (I haven't tried all of them since there are hundreds of them, but I have tried maybe 5-10 of them and they consistently have the issue). \nHere's all of the extra info: \nsystem: Windows 10 (Version 1607)\nbrowser: Chrome (Version 56.0.2924.87)\nos: Windows\nother systems: Only tried on Chrome\nstreama: v1.0.21\nusing release: yes\nI've sent you some example files on Gitter.\nThanks! . I'm going to close this as this doesn't seem to be happening anymore. I believe that it was a problem with Chrome and not Streama. For future reference, I'm currently on v59.0.3071.115 of Chrome and haven't seen any playback problems (only tried mp4, have not verified with mkv). \nThanks. +1. This is also the case for the \"Recommended for You\" section. . RC10 fixes the thumbnails in the \"Continue Watching\" section, but the ones in the \"Recommendations for You\" are unfortunately still missing. . In the \"Hidden dash sections\" within the admin settings, do you have recommends? If so, remove that and save. . This is the original issue. After looking it up, it looks like the Recommendations section only shows up if you  have chosen a favorite genre (Profile icon in top right corner -> user settings -> Choose a genre that has at least 1 video associated to it). \nMake sure to refresh the browser once you do this. . Hm, I'm not sure what is happening then. Maybe @dularion can shed some light on why the recommended section isn't showing up?. Yeah, I don't believe GH sends emails for edited replies. Good to know that I'm not the only one!. This is great @fuji44, a fix I've been a big fan of! \nOne small bug I noticed: this breaks Streama for non-TV shows. An exception is thrown because movies don't have an episode selector! \nvendor.unminified.js:25497 TypeError: Cannot read property 'addEventListener' of null\n    at J (streama.unminified.js:7833)\n    at r (streama.unminified.js:7436)\n    at streama.unminified.js:7420\n    at vendor.unminified.js:23268\n    at vendor.unminified.js:27811\n    at r.$eval (vendor.unminified.js:29073)\n    at r.$digest (vendor.unminified.js:28889)\n    at r.$apply (vendor.unminified.js:29181)\n    at e (vendor.unminified.js:23561)\n    at v (vendor.unminified.js:23759)\nHere's the code in question: \n...\nvar playerMenu = document.querySelector('#player-menu-episode-selector');\nplayerMenu.addEventListener('mouseenter', function (event) {\n    isMouseWheelVolumeCtrlActive = false;\n});\n...\nI think this could be simply fixed with the following: \n...\nvar playerMenu = document.querySelector('#player-menu-episode-selector');\nif (playerMenu == null) {\n    return;\n}\nplayerMenu.addEventListener('mouseenter', function (event) {\n    isMouseWheelVolumeCtrlActive = false;\n});\n...\nI could submit a PR with this quick fix, I'll be honest though I have not been able to set up the dev environment (mostly because web development is not my area of expertise at all), so it'll be a change without much testing, which isn't great. . @Norwelian can you check if #707 describes your problem? If so this is because of a bug in #692, so you can temporarily revert to RC9 or earlier to fix the problem. . @wanderfyx Yes, no problems whatsoever with the playback (so far). . This is due to the new \"Trusted User\" setting that was introduced in #673. I had to go in and set all of my users to the trusted user role. \nOne note: I think it makes sense that as an admin you are automatically a trusted user. \nThere is another bug however that shows up when you delete a role: it deletes all of the roles. It was mentioned in the linked PR. . I'm using the latest version of Google Chrome. . ",

Thanks I'll definitely check all of them out! \n. I agree. Some of my movies do already have audio / video sync issues and if there was an option, as in vlc the f and g shortcut, to delay the audio stream, that would help in these cases. Can your player extract multiple audio streams into separate mp3s, or does the user upload the extracted audio streams ?

Maybe it is possible to select a whole folder and upload all playable movies ? I've done something like this in python.. I like the idea of scanning for regex patterns!

It should be [ Link name ](https://maker-tutorials.com/eigene-streaming-seite-wie-netflix-mit-streama-und-einem-raspberry-pi-3/). I would just use Dashboard. It is commonly used in German.. I would change it to \"Weiterschauen\".. Misspelling of \"Sesion\". Should be \"Session\" or in German: \"Sitzung\".\nI would also change \"Gib die ID an deine Freunde weiter um mit deinen Freunden synchron diesen Film zu schauen!\" to \"Diese ID kannst du weiterleiten um mit deinen Freunden den Film synchron zu genie\u00dfen!\". Missing period and syntax. My suggestion: \"Es gibt ein Problem mit dem Video. Es scheint als sei die dazugeh\u00f6rig Videodatei entfernt worden.\". Misspelling.

Change \"[...] benutzt [...]\" to \"[...] besuchst [...]\". @dularion 'Zuletzt angeschaut' translates to \"Last watched\". Is this the correct meaning here?  Same on line 78.. Translate \"Invite Button\" to \"Einladen Button\" and fix typo  \"Formuular\" to \"Formular\".. Wrong grammar. Should be: \"Deine Freunde werden \u00fcber Email benachrichtigt, dass du Sie eingeladen hast.\". You could change \"Video-Sessions\" to \"Videositzungen\" and \"Session\" to \"Sitzung\" for consistency. Also \"Videoplayer\" is misspelled. . Misspelling and I would change the sentence \"Du kannst diese zur Benachrichtigungswarteschalnge hinzuf\u00fcgen.

    "jwcrawley": "I did the standard Linux install. My only differences is I have my data directory in /opt/movies with appropriate permissions.\nI don't know if Tomcat is the standard used. I followed the guide here : https://github.com/dularion/streama/wiki/Local-Streama-Setup. I do, but it's a whole bunch of API call fails to that movie database. I've fixed that. \nLike I said, it's verifying the Base Path, but not saving it into MySQL. It's changing other content - I'm watching it from mysql console. . Since I directly modified the DB in the stated \"FIX\" localtion at my root comment, etherying is functioning normally.. I second this idea. \nI have this behind our network, and I would like this service available for anyone on my network. It's one less login/password to deal with. And frankly, Streama just works. \nIt would be a great boon to be able to turn off the authentication layer, and be a nice happy HTML5 player for anyone on our network. . Greetings, Dularion!\nDo you have any further progress on making a flag to ignore login? (Or perhaps a autologin=[user] )\nI've tried digging in this codebase, but I've no experience here, aside running it. But I have over 1.4TB of data being served through Streama :). Well, I found out the problem. The version I was using required MySQL, and had no option for the localDB files in the H2 database format. \nWhat happened was that I ran the newest version in the old location's place, creating some DB files that really had nothing in them.\nWhere my data really was, was in my MySQL instance in streama DB. Once I downloaded the application.yml, and added MySQL creds, everything populated appropriately.\nSo, to fix:\n\nDownload the application.yml to the streama location.\ncomment out the local DB option and uncomment the MySQL option, add MySQL login/password\nrestart Streama. Hey, thank you for accepting this! \n\nIve been going through hell and back with work, and didn't have a chance to fix this up :/ My apologies.\nAnd thank you again, @Jeronimo95 for getting this squared away :).

As it has the possibility of creation and management of several accounts I do not see interesting sharing of access even if it is for content management. https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/request-rate-limiting \nRequest Rate Limiting\nWe do enforce a small amount of rate limiting. Our current limits are 40 requests every 10 seconds and are limited by IP address, not API key. You can think of this is being burstable to 40 in a single second, or as an average of 4 requests/second. The timer will reset 10 seconds from your first request within the current 10 second \"bucket\". This means that if you trigger the limit you will have to wait up to 9 seconds before the timer resets but depending where you are within the 10 second window, it could be the very next second.\nYou can use the X-RateLimit headers that get returned with every request to keep track of your current limits. If you exceed the limit, you will receive a 429 HTTP status with a Retry-After header. As soon your cool down period expires, you are free to continue making requests.\nHere's an example of what the headers look like on a rate limited request:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nCache-Control: public, max-age=21600\nContent-Length: 11844\nContent-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8\nDate: Wed, 23 Nov 2016 16:31:18 GMT\nETag: 324450bbc4885ae02b0fc2e7f589374b\nServer: openresty\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 40\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 32\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1479918684\nConnection: keep-alive.

Well, I think its how Streama indexes the files you add, sort of creates a internal link between the file and the database somehow. It's probably possible to do it differently, but I think thats the reason for it.\nJust so Streama (system) knows what the heck file is for what series, and season and episode, even after a restart.\nThink it's easier to have Streama create it's own filenames, instead of forcing Streama to understand yours - something along those lines perhaps.\nI get your point though and it's probably something Streama may get in the future maybe, like an enhancement.. Yea of course, I fully see that, and agree - hopefully a future enhancement!. Seen it, I have it on every launch of Streama as the service.\nNo idea what it is, no idea how to fix it - but to me it aint causing issues.\nWould be cool with a reason and fix for it though. Clogs up my logs.. Not seen this issue before - Either permission issue, or conflict in Streama's file I'd imagine.\nGetting any errors? Any logfiles? What OS you got Streama on?\nI'd recommend a reinstall?\nStart from scratch. Ensure your PC - whatever you have Streama running on is updated, fully healthy and otherwise is good.. Right, so it's most likely the Port conflict.\nNow, my sample_application.yml file does not actually do anything. If I change any values in it - Say the port, save, restart Streama, the effects does not take place.\nStarts over and over on default port 8080 - regardless of what the .yml file say.\nAny suggestions?. And yes, the .yml file is right next to the streama.war file. For sure, in use.\nAs the files are synced across two nodes, both nodes would be \"Using\" the same files.\nTried to change the port anyway - Same error, so yes, whenever node01 is using the db, node02 can't.\nAnyway we can make it multi-use? Allow it to be read and written to at the same time?. Nvm, I answered my own question - MySQL solved that issue.. ",

I'm now getting a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/hibernate/dialect/PostgreSQL94Dialect error.. So I tried using dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect in my application.yml, and it seems to work. However, I'm getting ERROR org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaUpdate - HHH000388: Unsuccessful: create table user, which seems to be caused by the fact user is a reserved word for postgresql:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/22256124/cannot-create-a-database-table-named-user-in-postgresql\nAccording to the link, changing all references to the user table to \"user\" will work, but it's bad practice. Perhaps something like username could be used instead.. Turns out there was an unaccepted pull request that does what I need it to:\nhttps://github.com/dularion/streama/pull/368\nIt's a breaking change, so it makes sense it hasn't been accepted yet. There will need to be a migration script that checks for a user table and runs mysql -u steama -p pass -e \"RENAME TABLE 'user' TO 'users'\" or similar. There would need to be something similar for the Java H2 database. I suppose a pull request with migration scripts could get merged with #368 getting merged after.\nI've manually added what was in #368 to what I've git cloned and my steama-1.1.war runs just fine with the postgres database I made earlier.. Since interacting with h2 seems to require Java anyway, a database check and migration could be included in the startup of streama. I feel like that it might be a bit \"bloated\" to keep one time use code around, so keeping it around for a few versions then removing it could be a way to go. If anyone stays too long on an old pre-migration version, then they can use one of the versions that still have the migration code before upgrading to the latest version. I think Java can be used to interact with mysql/mariadb, so we could use either the bash script I wrote, or do the same thing in Java. I think using Java may be more suitable cross platform, since the bash script should only be suitable for Linux and I think MacOS and BSD. \nWe could just stick with the script method and write a batch script for Windows too. During the version check, it can check for which database is being used and either download the script for the OS in use, or run the h2 migration java code. I'm thinking it's probably possible to make the h2 migration stuff a separate java file, but I'd need to look into that a bit further on how that works.\nI like the idea of keeping the migration stuff separate from the main streama.war file as much as possible, and possibly download a script or a java file. We'd still need to include a means of checking the database on startup though if we want it to be more automatic. After the migration we could delete any leftover migration files since they aren't needed anymore.. That sounds good to me. I was toying with the idea of using systemd timers with that idea since some distros might not have a cron daemon installed by default, but have systemd. I think that would be a bit more tedious since creating the systemd timer and enabling it would require sudo, and as long as the streama user and permissions are set up correctly I don't think sudo would be necessary with a CRON job. We'll probably need to note somewhere in the streama setup guides and changelog that a cron daemon is a dependency if/when such a migration system is implemented.. I think so. It's the one that takes you back to the dashboard by default.\nedit: to be clearer. I don't mean the browser back button.. What I'm working with right now is slightly different to master. I originally noticed the problem in 1.1, though it still seems present in 1.2.1_beta.\nThe diff of my git stash:\n```\ndiff --git a/build.gradle b/build.gradle\nindex a517bf3..ddba7fa 100644\n--- a/build.gradle\n+++ b/build.gradle\n@@ -11,7 +11,7 @@ buildscript {\n         classpath \"com.bertramlabs.plugins:asset-pipeline-gradle:2.6.4\"\n //        classpath \"gradle.plugin.com.craigburke.gradle:karma-gradle:1.4.3\"\n //        classpath \"gradle.plugin.com.craigburke.gradle:bower-installer-gradle:2.5.1\"\n-        classpath \"org.grails.plugins:hibernate4:5.0.5\"\n+        classpath \"org.grails.plugins:hibernate4:6.0.3\"\n         classpath \"com.bertramlabs.plugins:asset-pipeline-gradle:2.8.2\"\n         classpath \"org.grails.plugins:views-gradle:1.0.12\"\n     }\n@@ -93,6 +93,10 @@ dependencies {\n     compile \"org.grails.plugins:mail:2.0.0.RC4\"\n     compile \"org.grails.plugins:grails-spring-websocket:2.3.0\"\n     runtime 'mysql:mysql-connector-java:5.1.36'\n+    compile group: 'org.postgresql', name: 'postgresql', version: '42.1.4'\n+    compile 'org.grails.plugins:postgresql-extensions:5.1.0'\n+    //compile 'org.hibernate:hibernate-core'\n+\n }\ntask wrapper(type: Wrapper) {\n@@ -139,4 +143,4 @@ assets {\n bootRun {\n     // local.config.location is just a random name.

I'm looking over log files to see if there is any clues there. Looking over the diff, the hibernate plugin is version 4:6.0.3. I'm going to revert that back to 4:5.0.5 to see if that changes anything.. I think the lag is a bit better after the 1.2.1_beta upgrade and reverting the change I did with the hibernate version. I am using Chromium for most of the troubleshooting. Firefox tends to be worse with the lag for some reason. I'm running Streama on a Debian 9 server, and accessing it on my desktop.\nThe more I test it, the more the reproducibility becomes inconsistent.\nHere are the steps I take in Chromium:\n\nfrom the Dashboard select and play a video\nhit the back (return to Dashboard) button immediately or wait a few seconds\nThen lag happens when trying to get back to the Dashboard. Sometimes when repeating for the same video, it only happens the first time. These last few tests it was happening consistently, then the lag stopped completely.\n. I'm getting 4.0 to maybe 15.0 for CPU at most while paused and clicking the back button and waiting on the lag. When playing a video it's around 30.0. Memory usage seems pretty normal as well. When monitoring my server's performance everything seems mostly normal. CPU and memory usage is low and well within limits, there are quite a few processes for Streama but that's probably fine. All I can think of is loading back up the dash is slow sometimes for some reason. I'm wondering if it's a database access lag more than anything since the one major thing that's different is that I'm using postgres instead of mysql.. Is there an example Apache conf file to access Streama from a URL? I'm beginning to think my current Apache conf for my Streama URL, or some other Apache config somewhere, is responsible for the lag/slow loading of the Dashboard.. I think I've narrowed it down to http 2. Commenting out the Protocols h2 http/1.1 line in my Apache config for Streama and restarting Apache eliminates any lag after hitting the back button. Getting back to the Dash is immediate. At first I thought it was DNS since testing Streama via the server IP instead of the URL eliminated the lag for me, but nothing I did with DNS seemed to do anything. There was another service on my server that had lots of trouble with http 2, so I tried that to see if that was also the case for Streama. Disabling http 2 for Streama revealed that was the problem.\n\nI suppose better http 2 support may be a good idea in future. Perhaps this is something good to add to the wiki as an advisement for the time being.. ",

For example, I've deployed ampache which performs simple audio transcoding with ffmpeg, and it's already bringing my VPS down to its knees... without proper GPU acceleration, it may not even be feasible to transcode 1 stream in real time. Amazon does propose GPU-accelerated instances that can be used, but the hosting price may not be what the final user expects, especially if the GPU instance is idle most of the time\n. @dularion what are the possibilities for technical integration?\nfor example, I have a poc (https://github.com/nherbaut/vhg-adaptation-worker) that runs async transcoding and dash chunking tasks that use a transcoding workflow implemented in python and working with with an amqp message broker to accommodate several parallel workers for scalability.\nI could wrap it up in a stand-alone docker microservice with a REST api and tell streama to process the transcoding depending on the current load of the system.  We also have the java connectors that can pilot the message brokers (we use spring btw)\nAnother option would be to have a 100% pure java code, relying on ffmpeg or gstreamer under the hood for transcoding\nLet me know what would work best. Please note that if we want to support adaptive streaming (DASH/HLS) to\nimpove users' quality of experience, it is necessary to down-scale the\nvideos to genereate low-def chunks.\nThis requires a transcoding pass.\n2017-09-29 3:43 GMT+02:00 Jeremy Ryan notifications@github.com:\n\nYeah will definitely do that.

    "f1reflyyyylmao": "I just noticed that the site referenced by @Jeronimo95 says that the feature can in fact be enabled in both firefox and chromium based browsers. As I'm very interested in it, would this be accepted as a feature of streama in the master branch? We could make it opt-in and provide explanation that it has to be enabled client-side on the administrator page or a similar location.. Maybe close this issue since it's resolved?. I don't have a discord account and, duo to their privacy policy I won't create one. Why don't you write your fix in the wiki or better create a pull request to fix it?. Just try to describe as good as you can what you did to make it work again. If you're uncomfortable with that I'm sure we can find a way to speak and I'll write it up if it works.. After upgrading to the newest streama version this issue is resolved for me, @jguerinet please verify if it works for you too. How can i make streama show the \"recommended for you\" section? It's not being displayed on my dash... No, my \"hidden dash sections\" is empty. However, i just noticed that i get a ton of sql errors because a foreign key restraint appears to fail, so there's probably something broken with my sql database. I'll delete the whole thing and report again when i managed to get it to run without errors. After resetting my database and re-adding some movies, theres still no section called \"recommended for you\". I didn't find anything about it in the docs either. Is there a place i can read about this feature?. After setting some favorite genres i still don't get any recommendations despite having some movies for most of them in my library\nEdit: It worked after restarting streama for some reason. Thumbnails don't show up for me as well, so I can now confirm the issue. I already fixed it in my reply, i guess github just didn't send another email to you? It works now and I can confirm that the thumbnails are missing.. @MimTiller Sorry, but what exactly did you do in your nginx server block to fix the issue? Mine looks like this\n```\nlocation /videos/ {\n                client_max_body_size 64g;\n                proxy_set_header Host $host;\n                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;\n                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n                #WebSocket Support\n                proxy_http_version 1.1;\n                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n                proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;\n            rewrite ^/videos/(.*)$ /$1 break;\n            proxy_pass http://192.168.178.201:8080;\n    }\n\nand I'm not sure what to do. If you explain to me whats wrong I'll go and change the docs, too. I added it to my streama location block like this\nproxy_set_header Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' https://image.tmdb.org;\";\nbut it still redirects to `mydomain.net/login/auth` instead of `mydomain.net/videos/login/auth` and media won't load on the machine that still has a valid login cookie from previous tries. Both statements work, i just tested it. Anyway, it doesn't throw any csp errors currently, which makes me think my server block is borked in other ways. The nginx docs suggest that one should drop the `rewrite` line and just add a slash to the end of the `proxy_pass` statement so nginx takes care of url replacement automatically. When I do that i can open streama on a computer thats already logged in by forcing it multiple times to the correct url. When i open streama that way it fails to load any of my media, even though a quick check by manually pasting the url to the resource (`mydomain.net/videos/file/serve/xxx.jpg`) shows the file just fine. The assets seem to load as well, so the yaml configuration seems to be correct. I changed two lines from my previous config:\nrewrite ^/videos/(.*)$ /$1 break;\nproxy_pass http://192.168.178.201:8080/;\n``\nNotice the pound symbol and added slash. Reverted theproxy_passandrewritestatements to their previous states, but changed theproxy_set_header Hostfrom$hostto$http_host. I think this might've been a problem because I don't host streama on the same machine as nginx itself. The redirections work now, but the links to files are still all wrong. Example: When I inspect a cover image bothng-srcandsrcpoint to/file/serve/###.jpginstead of/videos/file/serve/###.jpg. The streama logo has the same problem, it points to/assets/logo.pnginstead of/videos/assets/logo.png. I configured my application.yml as described in the docs, anyone got any ideas if nginx may be breaking this? My current approach is to use thesub_filtermodule to replace all occurances of/serve/file/` with the correct path, but I'm 99% sure thats a horrible idea. I'd be really glad about any input.\nAlso sorry for abusing the issue tracker for discussions.. ... I could do that, yeah, but ... I kinda broke it again without having commited the half-working version in my git repo. I'm very sorry, I'll post when i managed to get it running again. In the meantime it's probably a good idea to re-open this issue, as we both have problems with it.. I had this issue too, but I'm not sure how to replicate it either. I didn't cut any black bars with ffmpeg, although i did reencode the videos from h264 to webm. When the error occured i would exit fullscreen and re-enter it and eventually the bar would go black again. I'll report more information if i see it happening again.. Update: It just happened again for me. I was using firefox on windows to play a 4:3 episode on a 16:9 screen. The bar disappeared after i closed fullscreen to take a screenshot and didn't reappear after. I'm not sure if this is an issue with streama or firefox.... I have the same bug as described in the OP and can confirm with the following conditions:\nClient:\nArch linux x64 / Windows 10 x64\nFirefox stable & nightly\nServer: \nArch Linux x64 behind an nginx proxy\nOpenJDK Runtime build 1.8.0_192-b26\nStreama server 1.6.0-RC10\nThe file played is a .webm with vp8 video + vorbis cbr audio. I think it'd be better to check for this when we add a video to the player: \nThe player loads a video -> Checks if it's ~120s from the end (discussable, we should also check if it got a timestamp for the credits that we can use) -> If the time is over the threshold reset replay\nThis way the user can see what he already watched. . i forgot to move this to a new branch so i'll clean up and open it again. Sorry for any inconveniences.. +1 \nBut as long as this is not implemented you could work around this with this line\n$ for dir in *; do cd \"$dir\"; for file in *; do mv \"$file\" \"$dir$file\"; done; cd ..; done\nto prepend the season name to every file without much hassle. for dir in *: This loops over all files/directories in the current directory\ncd \"$dir\": Enter found entries with cd (change directory)\nfor file in *: Loop over all files in the directory that we just entered\nmv \"$file\" \"$dir$file\": Move (read: rename) the files we loop over\ndone; cd ..; done: exit the inner loop, exit the directory we're currently in (so we can enter the next one when the loop goes to the next item), exit the outer loop.\nThis works to rename files following the directory structure '/show/season/episode.webm'. Now, i started looking into this myself, but I got stuck where the api-service sents a get request to dash/listContinueWatching.json as i could't find the backend that assembles the answer to the request. I assume that's where the issue is, as the episode number is already in the href field of the anchor tag in the \"continue playing\" section and there are no further requests after the \"listContinueWathing.json\" where that number could load from as far as i can tell. The thing is, we already do this and then just ignore it because of the code I removed. I'm using streama without it for the last two weeks and it's working just fine.. This will not reset the playback when in the middle of watching, as the player only checks this when the file is opened. The issue I see with this is that someone could close an episode before the player opens the next one, so it gets reset the next time and the last episode is played again instead of jumping to the next episode. My proposed solution to this would be to check if watching the video we just opened was the last action the user did and not reset the playback if it is. I'm not sure where to get the data for that though.... ",

The search is now working.\nThe worst problem I have is that the videos now load very slowly on the normal web browser and I cannot upload videos, they just race past on the uploading and never process because no file has been uploaded. \nI have tried to go back to last version to correct this problem, now I have the same trouble with that version, so something has happened in the data base  which is H2 not SQL, or something else.\nNot a very happy bunny at the moment as I have a lot of content uploaded which has been working flawlessly on the Windows platform.\nI am not sure if you are aware that on the Windows platform a directory is create -C:/users/name of user/appdata/local/temp/2/ In this directory videos are duplicated with other settings. These videos need to be deleted after a while or the C: drive becomes full. I have attached the contents of the directory 2.\nfolder 2.txt\n. Hi \nI think I may have something strange going on with regard to the uploading etc in the Chrome browser and the PC. I am digging deeper to find out. I am still getting this problem with manually adding episode images. This info is in the log and the image is there. \nDEBUG grails.app.controllers.streama.FileController - FILE_IN_FS_NOT_FOUND\nThis only started to happen after updating to the latest version.. Since your update 1.5.2 yesterday, the problem has stopped.\nI will report back if I have the error again.. ",

    "jacobdu215": "IMO its better to run off a dedicated linux system, if not then maybe create a VM? It would create a nice isolated environment.. What's your hardware? If you get the main system running on SSD and then the media files into a different dir on separate drive should in theory allow you to speed things up. Or make an SSD as a cache drive? But yea your suggestion is good. This isnt an issue with the software. Most home routers have firewalls so no one can really access your system remotely. Now to get around this, you would need to port forward the ports related to streama, which is 8080 and if you switched to ports 80 and 443 for SSL and HTTP, you would port forward those. Just google how to port forward NAMEOFROUTER on google and it should come up with what you need. If it doesnt have your model its always similar. Then to access it, you would go to your external IP from outside your network. When you do, however, you need to change the access location in the streama settings. Once you do so, you do need to access from your external IP at all times even when under the same network. Hope this helps.. Yes or just google \"IP\" or \"what is my IP\". rowbawts, cant you just use your external IP while on your local network? It shouldnt affect performance really. . Click on the upload poster area? It should work. & If you have MovieDB API then it will grab both the image and the show/movie details and you'll also automatically be able to fetch episode information. Any updates on this issue?. Edit: Nevermind I just signed up... @dularion ok well just downloaded it and it wont validate an IP still. I entered http://xx.x.xx.xxx and its just stuck on \"Validating Domain...\". @dularion ok send you a message with my server details.

    "shaynethiessen": "Yes, you can find out what your public ip by going to https://www.whatismyip.com/\nIf you have a basic home internet plan, your public ip might not be static, so it will change occasionally.. @rowbawts I have that same problem here with my cheap ISP provided router. Sadly there is nothing that can be down about that unless you get a new router.\nIt would be great if Streama didn't require entering a base URL and instead automatically figured out the URL that was being used to access Streama.\n. I'm running Streama on Debian, using Firefox as my web browser. This happens after leaving Streama open in the browser, idle, for a few hours.. ",

Unfortunately I just deleted it off of my local storage but I tried playing it in mpv before that and it worked as intended, and thanks for the quick reply!\n\nVery interesting. Can you test that this only happens in streama? Try grabbing the video file Strema is playing and drag it into a new tab and play that in fullscreen.\n. I'm going to download it from the server and test, standby.\nDamn, if you find any other videos that cause this please try.\n\n.

I'm not sure this is caused by Streama.\nTry things like reinstalling Java, try 64bit java, reboot, enable Clean boot, etc. Your stack trace shows C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jdk1.8.0_181\\bin\\java.exe witch is very likely a 32 bit version of Java.\nThe last few commits only changed front end stuff so I'd be surprised if that was causing a heap corruption. You could also try rolling back to a previous commit and see if the issue is still present.\nClean boot (remember to switch back after troublshooting): https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows\n. Maybe it was running out of memory on 32bit or something like that. Not sure but glad its working now!. Currently this is the behaviour. Recursiveness is planned.. Please fill the issue template properly and create one issue per problem.. https://streamaserver.org/about/video-codecs/. Closed. Not an issue.. You can modify the Regex if its not right for your files.\nhttps://streamaserver.org/config/application.yml/. Unfortunately we don't have spanish instructions. You also have not provided any details as to  what you have tried or what is not working for you.. Like I said before you can modify the regex for your media. We're not going to do it for you.\nPlease don't repeatedly open issues.. Please fill the issue template properly and use english when reporting issues.\n. No detail in issue. We need some actual detail to be able to do anything, like is this the web browser on the tv or the android app, what's not appearing, what have you tried, etc.\nPlease read the issue template and fill it out fully or its not really helpful.. This has been a issue for ages, and I thought that someone had worked out how to fix it and it was in that nginx config in the docs.\n@dularion Any ideas on this?. This has been fixed in 382dfdb440a931dfc3ab2d87085be370b6b921a8.. Very interesting. Can you test that this only happens in streama? Try grabbing the video file Strema is playing and drag it into a new tab and play that in fullscreen.. Damn, if you find any other videos that cause this please try.. I'll try and recreate it sometime.. I agree, if the video doesn't fill the display it should have black around whatever side needs. Having one black and one grey is very weird.. The link we've been using everywhere is definitely valid - https://discordapp.com/invite/CJEHWX9. This has been fixed in 382dfdb440a931dfc3ab2d87085be370b6b921a8.. I've just made a PR that will fix this. Rather than adding a TvShow to Movie I'm checking if the property exists and setting a variable based on that.\nI just want @dularion to have a look at it first, it's pretty simple but there might be a better option.. Use Java 8. 1. Definitely don't just paste a stacktrace with a vauge title. \n2. Use the issue template filled out properly.\n3. You're probably not using java 8. \n. Duplicate of 440. Streama is intend for home and private streaming of your personal media library. The project is MIT licensed and you may use it for any purpose, but support for out-of-scope non-personal features such as advertising will not be provided.. Use java 8.

I'll describe my setup in hope for someone to reproduce it (or if someone gets me a hint, I may be able to have a look at the code myself).\nThis is the Dockerfile.\n```\nFROM alpine:latest\nENTRYPOINT [\"/entrypoint.sh\"]\nEXPOSE 8080\nARG SRC_VERSION=1.6.0-FINAL\nARG SRC_URL=https://github.com/streamaserver/streama/releases/download/v${SRC_VERSION}/streama-${SRC_VERSION}.war\nVOLUME /video\nRUN set -xe \\\n    && addgroup -g 82 -S abc \\\n    && adduser -u 82 -D -S -H -G abc abc\nRUN set -xe \\\n    && apk update \\\n    && apk upgrade \\\n    && apk add --no-cache --virtual=run-deps \\\n        supervisor openjdk8-jre-base \\\n    && apk add --no-cache --virtual=install-deps \\\n        curl \\\n    && apk del --progress --purge \\\n    && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*\nCOPY etc /etc\nWORKDIR /app\nRUN set -xe \\\n    && curl -L -o streama.war ${SRC_URL}\nCOPY application.yml .\nRUN set -xe \\\n    && chown -R abc:abc .\nCOPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh\nRUN chmod 540 /entrypoint.sh\n```\nThe entrypoint.sh just contains the following.\n```\nfind /video -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 0664\nfind /video -type d -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 0755\nchown -R abc:abc /video\nexec supervisord -c /etc/supervisor/supervisor.conf -n\n```\nFor the application.yml, it's pretty much as described in your docs.\n```\nenvironments:\n    production:\n        dataSource:\n            dbCreate: update\n            driverClassName: 'com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver'\n            url: jdbc:mysql://undisclosed/streama\n            username: undisclosed\n            password: undisclosed\n        server:\n            port: 8080\nstreama:\n    regex:\n        movies: ^(?.)[._ ](\\d{4}).\n        shows:\n            - ^(?.+)[._ ]S(?\\d{2})E(?\\d{2,3}).\n            - ^(?.+)._ x(?\\d{2,3}).\n```\nLastly, the etc/supervisor/supervisor.conf is configured to start streama.\n```\n[supervisord]\ndirectory=/\nnodaemon=true\nuser=root\npidfile=/tmp/supervisord.pid\nlogfile=/tmp/supervisord.log\nlogfile_maxbytes=20MB\nlogfile_backups=8\nloglevel=info\n[program:streama]\nuser=abc\ndirectory=/app\ncommand=java -jar streama.war\n```\nMariaDB has a user streama created and is successfully connected to obviously, otherwise the service would not work as described. Also, that user is given all permissions for the specified database.\nThis should be reproducible with an empty database. Just add a file to the volume and add it in streama. Without restarting the container/streama, one should not be able to watch the video. Once restarted, the database is updated (not sure what that means in terms of Grails), and the genre is added to the database entry. I've confirmed that it is indeed the missing genre that's causing the issues when trying to play the movie.. ",

    "Badidzetai": "Thanks for your answer, I will try to design a regex that fits my files on my own, and post a short explanation here if it is successful. \nTwo questions remain : \n *  Is it Java styled regex ?

I succeeded in writing a custom Regex for my needs, thanks for your help !\nFYI, with this name format, the regex to extract movie title is \n^(?<Name>.*?)\\[.*$ ?. Solved by building the container again, removing all cache from docker and docker-compose, and starting from scratch the container again. Thanks to all the streama team for the good work. ",

And it maybe helps if we knew the file (mkv, mp4?) and or format (codec etc) you are playing?. I reencoded a file to h264 with aac in mp4 format (max compat) and tested with localpath and upload. Localpath is fine, upload give internal error like DrEthan77 said. Funny part is the preview function works with the uploaded file, and the download on the preview player works as well.. ",

    "Norwelian": "Will do tomorrow first thing and update this.\nI already use Java 64 bit, the last version, but will try reinstalling it as well as another version.\nWhat do you mean by 'clean boot'?\nIt's kinda weird that this started happening just after git pull'ing yesterday. Before that, I had it running for 30 days straight without problems!\nThanks for the quick reply.. Well, you're right! \nSeems like, as I changed my system's PATH before, I didn't notice that now the default java of my system is 32 bit.\nThe issue is resolved using Java 64 bit.\nSorry for the inconvenience caused for being so dumb and not noticing it, and thanks for the quick and detailed answer.. Happens to me too. Update:\nWell, I noticed that when you right click in the player while it's showing the spinner/loading infinite icon (capture 1), the HTML5 typical video menu appears, then you can activate \"Show controls\" (capture 2), and play the video with the native controls correctly (even with subtitles)(capture 3).\nAlthough the video plays, the player keeps showing the spinner/loading icon on top of the video (capture 4), eventually showing the movie's info like when you have a video paused for a time (capture 5).\nI've attached some files to illustrate the explanation.\nThanks for your time.\n\n\n\n\n. I've digged into this a little bit, and it seems to be an error caused the following cascade of events:\nViewingStatusController tries creating a new ViewingStatusService, which, in turn, tries creating a new ViewingStatus. \nMovie does not have a TvShow show property, like Episode does, so it fails in this line, trying to access the TvShow show property of a Movie.\nA solution (I think) would be handling the type of the video being saved (movie or episode) and, in the case of it being a Movie, do something (that I don't know) to create the ViewingStatus without accessing the TvShow show property.\nSorry for the messy explanation, hope the links clarify it a little!. Fixed it temporarily by simply adding the property TvShow show to Movie.groovy.\nThis sets the Movie right in the continue-watching section, and simply sets the field tv_show_id to NULL in the viewing_status table of the DB.. Yeah, that's why I called it a \"temporary\" solution and didn't make it into a PR, 'cause I'm unable to do a better job at the moment in JS, but this does the trick neatly, and its more correct than adding a property to Movie that Movies shouldn't have.\nThanks for the PR!. I can reproduce it, but in my case, it restarts the episode from the beginning.\nWeird.. ",

    "EchoDev": "I'm fairly certain this has to do with the Content Security Policy. I'm on Apache2 but I had the same exact issue. Disabling \"Header set Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self';\"\" fixes the issue\nI'm sure it can be fixed properly with the correct CSP but I don't know enough to fix it atm.. You shouldn't disable CSP in your browser, that is a bad idea. \nAnyways this CSP seems to work. This is how it is configured for Apache2\nHeader set Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' https://image.tmdb.org;\"\nStuff like unsafe-inline makes your page less secure, but I doubt people want to attack your Streama server. The unsafe-inline could be removed if nonces were used or SHA256 of the scripts were calculated but that is kinda a lot of work. I might look into it later not sure.\nAlso I noticed Streama loads a font from Netflix servers, is it really needed? I didn't allow the font to load in the CSP config above so you can add it yourself if you want it.. Are you sure proxy_set_header can apply the CSP on Nginx?\nAlso what does your browser console say. If you get multiple CSP errors it probably didn't apply the CSP\nYou should try add_header instead of proxy_set_header. If you press the fullscreen button 5-10 times it happens you can reproduce the issue pretty easily.\nIf you press anywhere outside the window the grey bar disappears.. I don't think Streama supports playback of .avi files since your browser needs to support playback of it.\nIf you convert the file to h264 video with aac audio in a mp4 container it will work just fine. (This is easy to do with handbrake if you don't have experience with encoding videos). I made a small workaround for this issue. To use this workaround you need to use a mysql backend, I'm not sure how to edit the H2 backend that is selected by default.\nTo use this workaround you need to create 3 columns in the viewing_status table all three set to datatype INT and default NULL\nThe columns you need to create are: difference, tvshowprofileid and tempcount\nThen you need to set a crontab with the following command, make sure to edit the mysql username, password and database, rest should work fine\nmysql --user=mysqlusername --password=mysqlpassword --database=databasename --execute=\"UPDATE viewing_status SET difference = (runtime-current_play_time); UPDATE viewing_status SET tvshowprofileid = concat(user_id, tv_show_id); UPDATE viewing_status a INNER JOIN (  SELECT tvshowprofileid, COUNT(*) AS tempcount  FROM viewing_status GROUP BY tvshowprofileid ) b  ON a.tvshowprofileid = b.tvshowprofileid SET a.tempcount = b.tempcount; DELETE FROM viewing_status WHERE difference < 60 AND tempcount > 1; UPDATE viewing_status SET tempcount=NULL\"\nThis SQL query checks for the following:\n1. How large is the difference (in seconds) between the full runtime of an episode and where you left off\n2. It checks how many episodes of a specific show is registered in the viewing_status table\n3. If there are more than 1 episodes of a specific show is registered and the runtime left is less than 60 seconds it deletes the records\nThis basically makes it possible to rewatch episodes without have to manually skip back to the beginning but makes sure not to delete the record of the episode you are watching right now.. How long is your api key and where did you get your api key from?\nThe api key should be 32 characters long.. You shouldn't post your api key publicly. \nThe key looks correct tho, it has the proper length and should work. Make sure you paste it without spaces at the beginning and end.. @Norwelian did you test it with a tv show that has multiple episodes? Maybe it resets to the beginning because there is no new episode.\nAnyways, thanks for confirming the issue.. Try to use this\n```\nenvironments:\n     production:\n        dataSource:\n            dbCreate: update\n            driverClassName:  'com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver'\n            url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:----insert-port---/streamadb?useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&serverTimezone=UTC&useSSL=false\n            username: streamausername\n            password: streampass \n```.

    "Shretty": "Noted. Will remove console.logs before committing. I learned not do this (with vm) later from Poltto, at this point I think I was still quite unsure how the $scope worked. Not sure I understand completely. What reference does angular have to oldReport and why does it lose it? . Whoops, fixed!. Same as $scope earlier, fixed it now, also unbound selectedReports from the vm as it was only used inside the controller.. I think it actually behaves correctly for sorting atm. I'm looking into the filter buttons but I think it's not as simple as resetting the offset to 0, if I do that then it will behave wrong when I have multiple pages and change the filter (Say I'm on page 2, but reset the offset to 0, then it'll remain on page 2 showing the results of page 1).. Changed the offset to 0 now and always reset page to 1 when changing filters. Sorting should be behaving correctly though I believe. If not, let me know.. Haha this was during one of the earlier commits I believe right after I copied some lines from the file manager and forgot to change files to reports. Learned here that it can be easier to just write the code again yourself instead of copying.. Fixed and noted.\n  . I think what I meant here is that the checkbox didn't appear anymore when the report is already resolved. I agree though that this is a bit unclear. Was also a very large commit that should've been split into multiple smaller ones.. Yep, the initialLoad function was just to test something though, removed it soon after again I believe.. Well what I'm doing here is changing values from one array to values from the other array by comparing their ids. I currently don't know any way to do this other than with two loops, maybe there is some compare function that I don't know of that does this more efficiently?. Yep true, fixed now.. haha I think I very often added these in out of habit and removed them again before committing because I realized that they shouldn't be in the same commit, but here I forgot apparently :D. I usually do, not sure why I didn't in this case.. Noted.. Hm, not a conscious change. Sometimes the formatting was weirdly changed automatically by IntelliJ in places I didn't touch, might be one of those cases, not sure though.. I agree, I actually had the same exact idea you are proposing, but forgot to add it in, I was just gonna use the buttons I have but make them unclickable and put them in their own resolved column and add another column that reads resolve/unresolve based on whether it is currently resolved or not.. Fixed now. Could not however figure out how to remove the default button hover and focus behaviour.. I believe this caused problems for some reason. But those might have been due to needing to restart the application instead.. Hmm, I looked at this a bit now and I think I need some explanation here. Not sure what you're doing here exactly.. Because I wanted to send back the report and the count separately. I wasn't sure how to do this with gson.. Not sure what you mean. Is the comment supposed to reference something else?. Yep, I'm trying to commit more incrementally, I often just forgot to commit and then didn't add all the changes to the commit message. Will try to improve that!. Noted.. Puh, not sure tbh, think I was trying out some stuff and committed here without mentioning the change.. Don't I? I thought lastUpdated was automatically set when the report was created, but not when updated right? Otherwise dateCreated would also be updated here.. Huh, I believe that was a mistake on my part sorry, didn't mean to delete commented out code from you, must've thought that was from me somehow. Noted.. I think they weren't used anymore after this. That one change where I changed from gsons to json.use a bit above was the only case I used these gsons, so I removed them after changing to json.use. I think I removed these later? At least I can't find them in my current project.. Yep, committed too early here and only noticed the mistake a few commits later. Need to test better before committing.. Noted. I was often not sure in these cases because the commit doesn't directly send the episode data but rather lets you do it. In this case it still kinda makes sense but I believe there were cases where the sentence didn't make sense to me without 'let you'. But if this is okay, then I'll just leave the let you out from now on.. "
