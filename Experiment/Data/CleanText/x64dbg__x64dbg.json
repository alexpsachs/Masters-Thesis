GUI: fill with NOPs option in GUI (resolved issue #43)\n-> <>\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. hi,\nthanks for the report, would it be possible for you to provide an example of the crash? Is the target hiding the thread from debugger? http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/30815/An-Anti-Reverse-Engineering-Guide#ThreadHiding\nGreetings\nPS You can obviously also PM the target when its sensitive.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Yes, I'm using the DBH function to hide the debugger - but thats about it.\nThe target is the game called RAGE (x64 version), and its protection is SteamStub.\nThe place where it crashes, is in the actual \".text\" section decryption function.\n\nOriginal comment by: styx2007\n. You must use TitanHide (driver) to hide the debugger.\n\nOriginal comment by: Carbon Monoxide\n. Hi,\nCould you try 'bp NtSetInformationThread' and stepping on this one: http://rghost.net/53342175\nA friend of mine told me steam uses NtSetInformationThread as anti-debug trick to hide the thread from the debugger. This is a well-known anti-debug trick. You could try TitanHide to fix this anti-debug trick.\nWhen I step over the SYSCALL, the debugger puts a breakpoint in the next instruction. After the SYSCALL, the debugger will no longer receive debug events from the thread, so there will be a crash (on the target, not on x64_dbg).\nPlease tell me if the crash is in x64_dbg or in the executable you're debugging.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Seems you were right mate, it isnt the debugger thats crashing - its the damn game/test due to the NtSetInformationThread trick... Damn... I should have remembered this one...\n\nOriginal comment by: styx2007\n. No problem:)\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. This has something to do with LdrpDebugFlags and LdrpInitializeExecutionOptions. Visual Studio is able to handle missing DLLs correctly and raises a breakpoint exception.\nEdit:\nLdrpDebugFlags can be set manually by resolving the symbol address. It's a DWORD value with a bitmask for specific options. (Tested it myself)\n. I am working in this :-)\n\nOriginal comment by: David Reguera Garcia (Dreg)\n. Hey,\nWhats the problem? Spaces are to be removed, except when escaped (using \\ or when places within quotes. Try the command 'strlen' to see this behaviour.\nGreetings\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Ohh, my fault, didn't realize commands were delimited with commas instead of spaces.\ncmd a1, a2, a3, ...\n\nOriginal comment by: Nukem9\n.

Can't wait to see that added, thanks for working on it!\n- ejamesr\n\nOriginal comment by: ejamesr\n. how about YMM, ZMM register set\nAVX, AVX2, AVX512 command set?\ndetails to be read here  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions\n\nOriginal comment by: alex_b3\n. I need more time to code for 3dnow etc. But all FPU support its comming :-)\n\nOriginal comment by: David Reguera Garcia (Dreg)\n. x64_dbg will become a rocket science once it'll be familiar to that kind of bits...\nso far so good I know 0 debuggers support that all......\ncheers\n\nOriginal comment by: alex_b3\n. Yes to all, but especially xmm and ymm.  And here's my wish list for\ndisplay features for registers (I use FASM extensively, and need a better\ndebugger than WinDbg, which is barely adequate for 64-bit debugging):\n- Have a \"drill down\" feature for the registers. For example, display the\n  GP regs (rax, rbx, etc.; or eax, ebx, etc. for 32-bit code). But if I click\n  on the + next to it, then also show eax, ax, ah and al, etc.\n- For all displayed regs, show both signed and unsigned values (or make it\n  simple to switch between them).\n- Make it easy to switch between hex and decimal display.\n- The flags should always be displayed\nFor xmm/ymm/zmm regs: xmm is a subset of ymm, ymm is a subset of zmm.  But,\nwe sometimes think of them as separate.  So:\n- Show xmm, ymm, and zmm regs on separate lines with ability to drill down.\n  - For example, in 64-bit code, when I click on ymm, show drop-down with\n    all 32 regs.  Then let me see the data as bytes, words, dwords, etc., with\n    option for signed/unsigned, hex/decimal, float/integers/byte display formats\n- DO NOT close or modify the register display, let it remain as I set it;\n  let me save the format so it is \"remembered\" each time.\n- Bonus feature: allow me to change the display order. For example, I\n  always need the flags, so I'll put that on top; but since I don't normally\n  care about r12-r15, let me move those near the bottom.\nLook at Microsoft WinDbg - has lots of format options for memory display\n(this is good!), but lacks ability to change format of register display\n(but it allows me to change the order of the registers).\nThanks,\nejamesr\n\nOriginal comment by: ejamesr\n. Agree with your wishes. A lot of GUI work with this hehe.\n\nOriginal comment by: David Reguera Garcia (Dreg)\n. I am finishing the first -basic- FPU Support. but Microsoft says something like: Win64 process not support x87+MMX+3dnow in context switch, but the instruction works fine... I dont know what is best... keep the display of registers (ST0, MM0 ...)? (because the instructions and registers works fine) or not... :?\n\nOriginal comment by: David Reguera Garcia (Dreg)\n. The FPU registers are not used by Windows in Win64 (I'm not sure about\nMMX).  3dnow has been essentially dropped, no longer used.  But xmm (and\nymm and larger) regsiters are vital for Win64.  You can certainly show the\nother regs; if Win64 doesn't use them, they won't get trashed during\ncontext switches.\n\nOriginal comment by: ejamesr\n. Parsing 80-bit floats would just be the reverse operation of this function: https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/development/src/gui/Src/Utils/StringUtil.cpp#L38 (don't think anyone will need it though)\nXMM/YMM/ZMM registers are not a single full-width variable. They're calculated as multiple 8/16/32/64 bit variables (floats or integers) depending on what instruction is used. The user would need to choose the display mode. (Assuming torusrxx is doing this)\n. GUI: resolved issue #77 (find command)\n-> <>\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Issue #183 was marked as a duplicate of this issue.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Yes please!\n\nOriginal comment by: John Colvin\n. +1! :)\n\nOriginal comment by: Manu Evans\n. would you guys still vote for this if I say there would be no variable support, just the source lines and maybe some breakpointing/stepping inside the source? I don't plan to make a second visual studio, because this debugger aims at binary debugging without source.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. It would definitely lose a lot of impact, but certainly breakpoint and line stepping are of critical value. It wouldn't be a second VisualStudio, I think it would be a first one, or (finally) a decent debug solution for those who don't use VS :)\nThe trouble with Visual Studio is it's restrictions and marriage to Microsoft's proprietary toolchain and debuginfo format.\n\nOriginal comment by: Manu Evans\n. Yes, I agree with Manu Evans, it will not be a second VS, but it will attract more users and we will have a platform to implement what is missing in VS. for example you can't debug child processes in VS, patching the binary code, stack dump..etc \n\nOriginal comment by: naoufel El abidi\n. currently x64dbg can't debug child processes either :) anyways I'll soon start implementing this.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n.

Tested with testplugin, compiled from master.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. sorry, (again) forgot to update the plugin. Take a look at the master again now, I merged the v24 branch.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. I got it to work, thanks.\nThe reason it didn't work for me is that I tried to do the following:\n_plugin_menuaddentry(hMenu, MENU_DISASM, \"&Disassemble selection\");\n_plugin_menuaddentry(hMenuDisasm, MENU_DISASM, \"&Disassemble selection\");\ni.e. I tried to assign the same entry id for two menu items, because they execute the same action. But it seems like that's not supported.\nAlso, it would be nice to be able to add items to the menu directly, and not to the plugin's submenu, especially if there's only one item.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. Yeah..  I thought about doing the thing with the root menu, but it's really annoying to program,  especially because you could then modify other plugin menus... \n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. What OllyDbg 2 does for the plugins menu is that if there's only one menu item, it's used without the submenu. You might want to use that approach as well.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. working great!\n\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n.

Probably it has to do with a deadlock in TitanEngine code though.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. OK, how else could I assist in this issue?\ne.g. collecting logs, traces, debug data, etc\nthe most confusing thing with this target that even I'm starting to debug it (e.g. stopped on EP, then doing step (F8) execution and debugger just stopped to eat any of the debug command, so the only solution is to reopen it......\nThanks\n\nOriginal comment by: alex_b3\n. I'd also mention here very interesting facts:\n- when 1st copy of x64dbg stopped to respond on any debug commands (Pause, Step, even CTRL+F2 - WHY?)  I\"m running the second copy of x64dbg (not closing the 1st one) and that 2nd copy definitely has some influence from the 1st one - it hangs 100% on start of debugging.......\n  are there any options to enable traces/logs for TE?\n- if I load the target and staring to debug it it hangs on 10..20 executed instruction (either hang or  silent ignoring of the Debug commands), thats really annoying... I'd like to help here, but how?\n\nOriginal comment by: alex_b3\n. To find issues like deadlocks or threading errors I mostly use : \"Intel\u00ae Inspector XE 2013\" and it also allows to find Memory/Handle leaks. I would do some tests for you but I don\u00b4t have a complete debug build (which is needed for debug information and source code).\n\nOriginal comment by: AVJoKe\n. Hi all I\"m ready to put my time and efforts, just need a clear steps what todo Also, I was thinking about turning ON some kind of debug mode for Titan backend? please advice\n\nOriginal comment by: alex_b3\n. hey,\nfor you guys I will upload a release with all debug symbols needed for analysis, I had the issue a few times and it was hanging in TitanEngine in Global.Engine.Threading.cpp (the Mutex locks I failed to design). There were massive handle leaks (I forgot CloseHandle in the uninitializer of the class). According to Nukem x64_dbg still hang here, but I cannot reproduce it (not even with the exe alex_b3 uses). My testing environment was the 32-bit steam game Broforce, just run it in the debugger, play some and exit. The debugger would first hang (on GetContextThread), but later it didn't hang anymore.\nIn the past there were also issues with global variables being accessed from different threads (eg the SQLite database), these caused crashes, but they were fixed (I hope).\nGreetings and thanks for investigating!\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. ok, I checked it out again (this time not so tired as before) and I removed the locks on the TitanEngine context functions. When removing I noticed that I locked the \"DBGContext\" mutex before entering the function, so it looked like:\n__declspec(dllexport) bool TITCALL SetContextDataEx(HANDLE hActiveThread, DWORD IndexOfRegister, ULONG_PTR NewRegisterValue)\n{\n    MutexLocker lock(\"DBGContext\"); //the context is locked again here, this would cause the deadlock\n    //do the actual setting of the context (irrelevant for this example)\n}\n__declspec(dllexport) bool TITCALL SetContextData(DWORD IndexOfRegister, ULONG_PTR NewRegisterValue)\n{\n    MutexLocker lock(\"DBGContext\"); //the context is locked here\n    SetContextDataEx(hThread, IndexOfRegister, NewRegisterValue);\n}\nI'm really sorry about this, I removed the global variable DBGContext (why was it even global in the first place?) and I also removed the locks (the functions used in this code are not marked as thread-unsafe). Hopefully it fixes the issue.\nDownload the latest dev version (+ debug symbols): https://mega.co.nz/#!L0wAnARK!QJmGQwWj_3hPAbqwWFOb99a1bUm3uFlt8c8lmZj23Dg\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. mrexodia! the 1st smoke test shown that random hangs even during simple single step are gone! I\"m able to do the step into/over and I don't see any issues so far! Many thanks\n\nOriginal comment by: alex_b3\n. goodto hear that! I updated the link because i forgot to compile the latest version :)\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Thanks for the debug build! I did some tests and didn\u00b4t find any deadlock yet... but some leaks and data race conditions. Also while playing around with some performance benchmarking tools it pointed out that the current \"MutexLocker\" is kinda slow.\nI will have a look how I can export this stuff in a way that you can use the information to improve x64_dbg :).\n\nOriginal comment by: AVJoKe\n. AVJoKe: Here is a new TitanEngine. It uses critical sections and probably some more deadlocks were fixed (this time in the breakpoint functions): https://mega.co.nz/#!D0onQBrI!j2YTMASEF1jRd9v1OBSeViaiLh0wymtwITs6NCiYPio (includes debug symbols again)\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Something got wrong either on dev17 or on latest TE synopsis: after program loaded into x64, I can't F7/F8 - the app just runs and terminates.....

Well, using BridgeSettingGet can be made safe, but I'd have to allocate 65kb for it, which is both redundant and inefficient.\nWhat about e.g. disasmfast?\nIt's not clear from the source code what the limit is, but according to BeaEngine it's 15 bytes. But BeaEngine provides a parameter called SecurityBlock, why not use it? Instead I have to copy the data to a 15-bytes buffer just to be sure, which is, again, redundant and inefficient.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. Yep, the bridge API is actually for internal usage of x64dbg and at the time of writing these APIs I didn't think of safe parameters, from now on I will do this, but for the previous APIs you'd have to fit with their implicit size requirements.\nAs for disasmfast, the maximum size of an x86(_x64) instruction is 16 bytes (actually 15), so a buffer of 16 bytes will always be good.\nI agree with you, but I do not plan on breaking support with the older plugin API. I will add a new issue to provide a completely new plugin API, which takes size requirements in account.\nGreetings\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n.

Why do you try to be degrading? IDA patch format sucks for my purposes, because it uses file offsets instead of RVAs. If you want the format so bad, take a look at this plugin and create a pull request there or write your own plugin/conversion program.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Sorry if I sounded degrading. I was just sincerely wondering why do you use a strange format. I can't really feel how emotionally loaded a sentence possibly gets because it's not my native language.\n\nOriginal comment by: Dither\n. Hi,\nThe reason is that IDA uses file offsets instead of RVAs. Now I don't use the IDA format (OFFSET: OLD NEW) because it might create an illusion that the IDA files are actually compatible and they are not.\nLike I said, if you know any programming languages, it's quite easy to convert from/to the IDA format if you really need it.\nGreetings\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n.

Honestly I don't see the value of this, this is only an issue when you start building your own versions or when you start mixing versions. The latest release always has the latest versions of the libraries available. I could make some static text though, but that's useless.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Well there are plugins also. And there is no way currently for a plugin to demonstrate its version to user unless it implements some kind of dialog for it. And it can be important to know that you use some outdated module/plugin.\n\nOriginal comment by: Dither\n. see the log window for plugin versions.\n\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. I don't know. Some modules show versions, some not and have only static info about them (system), integer version numbers, no single place to look at all the information like authors/versions/etc. It's very confusing. Though it's not that critical but psychologically it is a good thing to have single organized About box instead of several places with the needed info.\n\nOriginal comment by: Dither\n. Plugins report their version to the debugger through a structure, so you really want I can create some plugin info dialog or something... And indeed versioning is confusing, because there is no standard. TitanEngine has no actual version (the one embedded in the resources is old), BeaEngine has a GetVersion API, but this doesn't really report the correct version, because it's updated. lz4 has no version, jansson has no version, XEDParse has no version.\nOnly Scylla has an actual version. I will keep the issue open though, maybe I will implement this some time.\nGreetings\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. what about using a the separate scylla exe on the x32dbg unpack session?

It's very handy when working with GUI programs, e.g. when you need to check how a variable changes when the mouse hovers over a specific element.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. alright, is 100 ms good enough? or 10?\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. OllyDbg uses one second, which is good enough most of the time, but sometimes a little bit too large.\nI'd say that 100 or 200 ms will do. 10 ms is unnecessarily low.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. done\n\nOriginal comment by: David Reguera Garcia (Dreg)\n.

Nobody expects from a simple edit box to handle an up button click, it's not a standard behavior.\nWhile not of a high priority, I think that ideally the goto dialog should use a combo box, like OllyDbg does. This would be self documenting.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. Yea, I use my own EditBox class (the same class as used in the command bar)\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n.

Seems like it would be nice to have a color for HANDLE along with the HWND idea.\n. yea, this is the desired behavior. If you want to clear all comments use the so-called autocomments (comments not created by a user):\n```\n!c++\nBRIDGE_IMPEXP bool DbgSetAutoCommentAt(duint addr, const char text);\nBRIDGE_IMPEXP void DbgClearAutoCommentRange(duint start, duint end);\nBRIDGE_IMPEXP bool DbgSetAutoLabelAt(duint addr, const char text);\nBRIDGE_IMPEXP void DbgClearAutoLabelRange(duint start, duint end);\n```\nThis is the behavior of the comment functions:\n```\n!c++\nbool commentset(uint addr, const char text, bool manual)\n{\n\n    if(!text) //NOTE: delete when there is no text\n        return commentdel(addr); //commentdel simply fails if there is no comment\n\n}\n```\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. I wasn't talking about the API, but about x64_dbg functionality. Click on an address which has no label, click ':', and then Enter. You will see an error message.

The exe can't be run because some dlls are missing (like lua51/tbb/steam_api.dll). Does it crash anywhere, or only in certain places?\n\nOriginal comment by: Nukem9\n. the information is too vague, please supply is with a more detailed guide\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. This is already what happens right now. The reason the thing crashes is that I didn't clear the plugin list, which basically means it will try to call plugins that are unloaded using FreeLibrary.\nThere will not be any plugindestroy function. It is 100% useless, except for the fact that plugins can add a dialog to ask if users want to quit. If you want to do operations on target stop (like exit stack analysis or something), use the CB_DEBUG* functions. If you need to complete something, do it in the plugstop function. The debugger will wait for your stuff to be completed.\nThis was fixed in bf8c69b475b94417dfb2a86cd761c82a202bc2c6. Right now, when I leave the MultiASM window open and close the debugger it will simply close the MultiASM window and exit without crashes.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. > when I leave the MultiASM window open and close the debugger it will simply close the MultiASM window and exit without crashes.\nI don't see how the commit you've linked fixes this issue. After all, the window procedure of multiasm is not called by x64_dbg, but by the system, so freeing the library right after calling plugstop still can cause a crash.\nAlso, I believe that introducing the plugindestroy callback function will lead to a cleaner, more correct API design. But in the end, it's your debugger and your choice. All I can say is that I'm reluctant to search for workarounds for crashes which are caused by this, while it works perfectly well with OllyDbg.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. The problem (which was an actual bug in x64_dbg) that was fixed by bf8c69b475b94417dfb2a86cd761c82a202bc2c6 had to do with when a global event message was sent to the event filter and then through CB_WINEVENTGLOBAL, the plugin callback processor would attempt to call the registered callback, even after plugstop was called, because the plugin list was not cleared. The commit ensured that the plugin list is cleared after plugstop, which means the CB_WINEVENTGLOBAL message would not be sent to freed plugins.\nIn your plugin you call PostMessage(WM_CLOSE);, which will not wait until the message was successfully processed. This means its a pure guess game if your window is closed before you return from plugstop. When the WM_CLOSE message is still being processed and at that moment the DLL is freed, it will generally crash. However, when you call SendMesssage(WM_CLOSE); instead, it will only return after you cleaned up your window, meaning you don't have to worry about random crashes.\nProbably the only reason it works correctly in OllyDbg is that there is some delay between ODBG_Pluginclose and ODBG_Plugindestroy.\nThe answer to this question is interesting regarding this matter:\n\nPostMessage (in \"pure windows programming\", aka win32 API) is asynchronous, i.e., to quote the docs:\n\nPlaces (posts) a message in the message queue associated with the thread that created the specified window and returns without waiting for the thread to process the message.\nTo post a message in the message queue associated with a thread, use the PostThreadMessage function.```\n\nSendMessage is synchronous, that is, again quoting:\n\nSends the specified message to a window or windows. The SendMessage function calls the window procedure for the specified window and does not return until the window procedure has processed the message.`\nTo send a message and return immediately, use the SendMessageCallback or SendNotifyMessage function. To post a message to a thread's message queue and return immediately, use the PostMessage or PostThreadMessage function.\n\n\nLike I said before, adding a plugdestroy message would just be:\nbool _dbg_exitsignal()\n{\n    if(!plugstop())\n        return false; //do not exit\n    //some other cleanup code\n    plugdestroy();\n    return true; //exit\n}\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. > The problem ... a global event message was sent to the event filter and then through CB_WINEVENTGLOBAL ...\nYeah, this bug was probably fixed by that commit, but not the bug of closing the debugger when the multiasm window is open.\n\nIn your plugin you call PostMessage(WM_CLOSE);, which will not wait ...\n\nSending WM_CLOSE won't wait either. I've just rechecked to make sure, and even if I use SendMesssage(WM_CLOSE);, the window procedure receives calls after SendMesssage returns.\n\nProbably the only reason it works correctly in OllyDbg is that there is some delay between ODBG_Pluginclose and ODBG_Plugindestroy.\n\nNo, there's no delay and no luck involved. I've tried to explain many times how OllyDbg manages this, but you don't seem to understand.\nODBG_Pluginclose is called early, right after you click on close. OllyDbg's main window still exists and shown, nothing was cleaned up, etc.\nODBG_Plugindestroy is called lately, after all GUI is finalized! The message loop is finalized as well, ALL the windows of the process are gone, so multiasm's windows procedure just CANNOT be called anymore. All is left for the process is to exit. You might want to look again at the five stages I written in the original bug report above.\n\nThe answer to this question is interesting regarding this matter:\n\nYes, but WM_CLOSE doesn't destroy the window right away. It just schedules a closing event.\n\nLike I said before, adding a plugdestroy message would just be:\n\nIt shouldn't be like that! That obviously won't help!\nIt should be more like this:\n```\nvoid main()\n{\n    // ...\nrun_GUI(); // <-- on_exit_button_click() gets called here\n\n// ...\n\nbefore_termination();\nexit_process();\n\n}\nbool on_exit_button_click()\n{\n    for(i=0; i<plugin_count; i++)\n        if(!plugstop(i))\n            return false; //do not exit\n    return true; //exit\n}\nvoid before_termination()\n{\n    for(i=0; i<plugin_count; i++)\n        plugdestroy(i);\n}\n```\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. ok, here is a small overview of what happens when I click the close button on the x64dbg window: \n```\n!c++\nvoid MainWindow::closeEvent(QCloseEvent* event)\n{\n    hide(); //hide main window from sight (not the same as deleting)\n    mCloseDialog->show(); //display 'Closing debugger...' dialog\n    mCloseDialog->setFocus(); //set focus to this dialog\n    CloseHandle(CreateThread(0, 0, closeThread, this, 0, 0)); //create closeThread\n    if(bClose) //bClose = false on dialog init\n        event->accept(); //accept event (close/destroy the main window)\n    else\n        event->ignore(); //ignore event (eg actually close the dialog) when bClose = false\n}\n```\nAfter the closeEvent, x64_dbg will spawn a thread that does the following:\n```\n!c++\nDWORD WINAPI MainWindow::closeThread(void ptr)\n{\n    static bool closing = false;\n    if(closing) \n        return 0;\n    closing = true; //ensure the thread doesn't run twice\n    DbgExit(); //call exit of the Dbg\n    MainWindow mainWindow = (MainWindow*)ptr; //get pointer to MainWindow class\n    mainWindow->bClose = true; //allow the function above this to actually close the dialog\n    mainWindow->close(); //call the closeEvent\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nthe DbgExit function looks (globally) like this:\n```\n!c++\nextern \"C\" DLL_EXPORT void _dbg_dbgexitsignal()\n{\n    cbStopDebug(0, 0); //stop debugging\n    scriptabort(); //abort running scripts\n    wait(WAITID_STOP); //after this, debugging stopped (wait for debugger to report it stopped)\n    pluginunload(); //unload plugins\n    TerminateThread(hCommandLoopThread, 0);\n    CloseHandle(hCommandLoopThread);\n    cmdfree(command_list);\n    varfree();\n    msgfreestack(gMsgStack);\n    if(memleaks())\n    {\n        char msg[256] = \"\";\n        sprintf(msg, \"%d memory leak(s) found!\\n\\nPlease send 'alloctrace.txt' to the authors of x64_dbg.\", memleaks());\n        MessageBoxA(0, msg, \"error\", MB_ICONERROR | MB_SYSTEMMODAL);\n    }\n    else\n        DeleteFileA(alloctrace);\n    CriticalSectionDeleteLocks();\n}\n```\npluginunload looks like so:\n```\n!c++\nvoid pluginunload()\n{\n    int pluginCount = (int)pluginList.size();\n    for(int i = pluginCount - 1; i > -1; i--)\n    {\n        PLUGSTOP stop = pluginList.at(i).plugstop;\n        if(stop)\n            stop(); //call plugstop\n        plugincmdunregisterall(pluginList.at(i).initStruct.pluginHandle); //unregister callbacks\n        FreeLibrary(pluginList.at(i).hPlugin); //actually unload the library\n        pluginList.erase(pluginList.begin() + i); //erase plugin from list to prevent calling callbacks in functions that do not exist\n    }\n    pluginCallbackList.clear(); //remove all callbacks\n    pluginMenuList.clear(); //clear menu list\n    GuiMenuClear(GUI_PLUGIN_MENU); //clear the plugin menu\n}\n```\nIt already works like you propose, except that you clean up your mess before the debugger is completely terminated (the GUI is still there while cleaning up though).\nBasically all that happens after the main window closed is:\n```\n!c++\nmConfiguration->save(); //save config on exit\nreturn result; //return result from MainWindow\n```\nEvent filters etc are not called after the close button was clicked, I just verified that. So I don't see where the bug is...\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Hmm, looks messy (and not too thread-safe). Why do you need an extra thread?\nreturn result from MainWindow - who receives it, and why can't you call plugindestroy there?\n\nEvent filters etc are not called after the close button was clicked, I just verified that. So I don't see where the bug is...\n\nThe bug is not with event filters, but with the dialog's window procedure, which is called by the system.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. fixed the thread-safety, although in practice you cannot click the close button fast enough to break it.\nnobody receives that, it's just the return from main(). After the MainWindow was initialized (eg it has a HWND) it will call some initialization functions in the DBG (eg load plugins) and then it will start the application (MainWindow). plugstop gets called before MainWindow is destroyed (try calling GetWindowText(GuiGetWindowHandle())) so everything should be fine window-wise.\nI also saw some interesting stuff about closing your dialog: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff381396(v=vs.85).aspx\nMaybe you could try calling DestroyWindow directly or try calling PostQuitMessage(0); inside WM_DESTROY, this ends the message loop (here they talk about as if that is mandatory).\nUnfortunately I cannot make the debugger crash on my system (not even with the video White uploaded at tuts4you). Do you have a good way of reproducing the crash (in the first post you say something about WinXP).\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. > it's just the return from main()\nSo is this the main thread? Does it wait for the closeThread to finish? If so, this looks like a perfect place for plugindestroy.\n\nMaybe you could try calling DestroyWindow directly\n\nThat complicates stuff, as there might be child dialogs, such as the find dialog (Ctrl+F), which shouldn't be destroyed directly.\n\nor try calling PostQuitMessage(0); inside WM_DESTROY, this ends the message loop\n\nThis is 100% wrong. It ends the message loop of the thread, which is managed by Qt, not by multiasm.\n\nin the first post you say something about WinXP\n\nThe bug with Windows XP, the one White reported, was about the event filter callback and was probably fixed. I don't have a way to reproduce the unfixed bug, which is about timing.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. the issue has been confirmed, needs fixing. The idea is to free the plugins somewhere before program termination, without adding any extra callbacks (extra callbacks = more complex plugin architecture)\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. oh, reproducing this on the dev build is (/was) very easy for me:\n1. install multiasm in the /plugins dir\n2. start x64_dbg\n3. open the multiasm window\n4. close x64_dbg\n5. crash (sometimes in a random stack, sometimes with the correct stack)\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. > >  In your plugin you call PostMessage(WM_CLOSE);, which will not wait ...\n\nSending WM_CLOSE won't wait either. I've just rechecked to make sure, and even if I use SendMesssage(WM_CLOSE);, the window procedure receives calls after SendMesssage returns.\n\nIn fact, I might have been wrong here. I've changed it to SendMessage, changed a couple of other stuff, and looks like the call is synchronous now.\nPlease try this version and tell me whether it's still crashing.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. Seems to work fine without crashing now.\n\nOriginal comment by: Nukem9\n. Okay, so can we call this issue resolved?\nTo be safe I might still implement an internal plugindestroy mechanism, but if the bug is solved that's just to prevent crashes like this from happening.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. I haven't tested this thoroughly, but if you are sure that the crash is gone, I guess that it can be closed.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. just tested it, issue appears to be resolved :)\nThanks everyone!\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. hi, we plan to let the gui pass utf8 strings and to convert this as late as pkssible to utf16 and then back to utf8 for internal use.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Good, and thank you guys all, for your hard and wonderful work. I'm also a c++ programmer. I will write plugin for x64_dbg.\n\nOriginal comment by: lynnux\n. hello guys, currently I'm porting x64dbg to UNICODE. Please notice that it's currently really hard to do because it requires converting all string operations to a UTF-8 class. This will probably take some time.\nNotice that the author of the thread should come to me so we can talk about some design ideas, for example using wchar_t everywhere will not work well, for example because the settings are going to be messed up.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Hi mrexodia. I agree with you that it may take long time to port x64dbg to UNICODE, so I have an idea that I write a plugin, which hook the functions in x64_dbg_bridge(poject name), like DbgCmdExec or BridgeSettingSet, and convert the utf-8 chars in parameters to the system default Windows ANSI code page chars, then it should be work without any further process. Because the all the communication between the gui and lower x64_dbg_dbg is through x64_dbg_bridge, and x64_dbg_bridge is not modified frequently, this maybe the quick and easiest way to let it work.\n\nOriginal comment by: lynnux\n. nope, thats a bad idea and it wont work fully. the command processor is just not utf8 compatible :)\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. aha, I also don't think it's a good idea. But until the official support come out, I should give it a try, it won't take long time. \nI've started a new plugin project to do this\n\nOriginal comment by: lynnux\n. whatever you want :) Currently im really busy with the uni and stuff... But\nwhen I have some time I will rewrite the command processor, from there it\nwill only take a few WinApiA() to WinApiW() replacements.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Rewriting the command processor isn't needed for unicode :) \nThis was done while on a train (aka 10 minutes of work): https://twitter.com/mrexodia/status/510080743251673089\nNow I just need to convert every WinAPI call to the UNICODE component for full unicode support (+ the GUI needs some work).\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. fully unicode now\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n.

I didnt add scrollbars there on purpose, its good like it is now :D\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. but then we need disable scroll bars always in the CPUInfoBox. If you agree with this I can do it.\n\nOriginal comment by: David Reguera Garcia (Dreg)\n. Dreg: it has always been like that before, the InfoBox is more for small information.\nAn idea could be to use our very small chrome scrollbar for this and compensate for the height (which is not very much). Also please use this scrollbar in the registry view, because currently it's very much scrollbar, which is a waste of space.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. done in my last pull request\n\nOriginal comment by: David Reguera Garcia (Dreg)\n. agree, very important and useful :-)\n\nOriginal comment by: David Reguera Garcia (Dreg)\n. I've experimented with that in the past, but it would generate a lot of fake crash reports :D\nGreetings\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Is it difficult to distinguish fake crashes from the real?\n\nOriginal comment by: Dither\n. Dither: my crashreport code reported every exception in the x64dbg process, about 99% of them were false-positives and it's impossible to determine if it was an actual crash, because an exception handler was registered. The only way of doing this would be to create a dedicated JIT debugger that dumps out useful information.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Are you sure sure the dedicated JIT is needed? In case of x64dbg registered as its own JIT debugger it could detect if its previous instance really crashed just from the fact that it's running in such mode.\n\nOriginal comment by: Dither\n. well we can add a new option menu to send crashdump when the debugger is attached itself (JIT) . It is easy.\n\nOriginal comment by: David Reguera Garcia (Dreg)\n. I think something along the lines of this:\n\n\nOriginal comment by: Dither\n. yep, I do agree, we can use some kind of JSON. We can add some useful info for us (the developers) for example: titanengine internal data, state etc. we can register an unhandled exception filter for crashes (I think this is better than JIT solution). Who want code this report stuff?. Note: We need a little infraestructure for this: a url to report using JSON or something like that. Also we need a way for developers to easy view and check the reports etc. Any suggestion or better method for this issue?\n\nOriginal comment by: David Reguera Garcia (Dreg)\n. Hi,\nPersonally I don't feel an advanced crash report thing with auto-uploading will help us much... There are far more important issues to take care of first.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. f5d408a187728262b8c51e3d3978af1808c6d1e0\n. well, if you want make a good code source documentation, paste here your coding style request about comments. It is important what kind of things we must comment, what is optional, what NEVER comment etc.. we can talk here about the code comments and if it is necessary we can change the coding style guide. I do agree with Doxygen :-)\n\nOriginal comment by: David Reguera Garcia (Dreg)\n. I think that basic JavaDoc-style method outlining (it can be done automatically within qtcreator and vs with corresponding plugins), description and inline comments for non-trivial pieces should suffice.\n\nOriginal comment by: Dither\n. i just pushed the doxygen branch, it was 100% auto-generated, but it's a start...\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Okay, there is a WIP list here.

If you need a more specific selection, write a small plugin that uses GuiSelectionSet.\nSeparators is a good idea, I will look into this.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n.

Good point, I'll do better in my next posts.\n\nOriginal comment by: ejamesr\n. DBG: resolved issue #211 (added a 'skip' command to skip the next instruction)\n-> <>\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. You are right about that it \"feels awkward\", but in my opinion x64_dbg is one of the few debuggers handling this thing correctly. Various debuggers handle INT3 commands as if they are breakpoints, meaning they swallow the exception, leaving the debugger open for detection mechanisms like:\n```\n!c++\nBOOL TestDebuggerSwallowsException()\n{\n    __try\n    {\n        RaiseException(STATUS_BREAKPOINT, 0, 0, 0);\n    }\n    __except(1)\n    {\n        return FALSE; //all good, debugger did not swallow the exception\n    }\n    return TRUE; //debugger detected\n}\n```\nAbove code inspired from: http://www.autosectools.com/anti-debugging-with-exceptions.pdf\nSimply ignoring exceptions is not supposed to happen, but to fix the awkwardness I added a command skip that simply sets the IP one instruction forward (in addition to swallowing the exception, so be careful using this).\nThe reason you had to repeat the process is first and second chance exceptions. First chance is before the exception is thrown at the debuggee. Second chance is after all possible handlers are called (could be none) and the application would normally crash. The skip command takes care of this for you.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Thank you, having the 'skip' command is certainly an improvement.\nI insert 'int3' commands at the points where I want my assembly-language\ncode to stop (this is in addition to any breakpoints I might set once the\ndebugger runs; in fact, this is the best way to set breakpoints at\nstrategic points in the code I'm debugging).  So, I prefer this be handled\nexactly as a breakpoint, because each int3 I insert actually is a\nbreakpoint.  It is not an error (as is almost every exception), it is by\ndesign.  I just want the program to stop at that point so I can inspect\nmemory, CPU flags, variables, etc.  Olydbg and Windbg handle this in the\nway that makes debugging flow smoothly, exactly as a manually-place\nbreakpoint would do.\nI have no experience with the detection methods you write about, so I can't\nspeak to that.  In any case, I look forward to testing the new version, thx!\n\nOriginal comment by: ejamesr\n. I assigned the skip command to the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F8. You can download the latest snapshots from http://snapshots.x64dbg.com\nThis will be all I can possibly do to ease your manual debugging habit.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n.

Honestly I dont see why they should be visible, you cannot attach to them as far as I know, not even with debug privileges (which are handled correctly).\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. IIRC only critical processes like CSRSS are protected. 'SearchIndexer.exe' runs as system and I can still attach to it with WinDbg. (Win 8.1)\n\nOriginal comment by: Nukem9\n. Hello,\nYou need to enable Debug Privilege before you can see all processes. If OpenProcess fails (because you don't have enough privileges for example) it will not show in the process list.\n\nThis is the code for getting the process list: https://bitbucket.org/mrexodia/x64_dbg/src/b150763bfb8d1a1397d5e893f963e869c01d0c0a/x64_dbg_dbg/debugger.cpp?at=master#cl-1787\nThis is the code that sets the debug privilege and opens the process: https://bitbucket.org/mrexodia/titanengine-update/src/2c886614afc9471fea26506b38903c70b2338d65/TitanEngine/Global.Engine.cpp#cl-2026\nHope this solves the issue. I thought you were talking about the process [System] which is just a dummy process IIRC.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. > Hope this solves the issue\nIt does, thanks for commenting on it.\n\nOriginal comment by: sdkf lkdjfl\n.

Do you have an executable to reproduce this?

I can reproduce it reliably with x64dbg, but it works normally on Ollydbg v2. No exe because it will only run on Steam if you own the game.\nI'll try to figure this out myself for now.\n\nOriginal comment by: Nukem9\n. The reason could be that exceptions are not marked as handled, they are\npassed to the debuggee.\nThis is to prevent people throwing DBGPRINT exceptions and then detecting\nthe debugger.\nA way would be to only show first chance exception debug strings, but I\nthink this information is not available (api is not transparent to the fact\ndebug events and RIP events are actually exceptions).\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. edit: you beat me anyway\nFound out why: http://maximumcrack.wordpress.com/2009/06/22/outputdebugstring-awesomeness/\n```\nOUTPUT_DEBUG_STRING_EVENT behaves just like an exception event, so that if you continue with DBG_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, it sends the event a second time, just like a second chance exception.\nRecently I\u2019ve been wondering why I got 2 debug string events for each call to OutputDebugString from the debuggee. I was looking for all sorts of weird solutions until I found out that returning DBG_CONTINUE did the trick.\n```\nhttps://bitbucket.org/mrexodia/titanengine-update/src/29f8973700c61a53f36f8f8247ea3ae3f909202a/TitanEngine/TitanEngine.Debugger.DebugLoop.cpp?at=master#cl-466\n\nOriginal comment by: Nukem9\n. indeed, but this was done with a reason.

I plan on making this using some sort of XML format first. This is done by Synalyze It! for Mac OSX, but we can borrow the XML format (https://gist.github.com/mrexodia/b21b429cdab57fa64e81 for example). I do plan on adding some sort of api for this too, so it would become possible to render custom data structures in your own plugins.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. I'm writing a plugin for ollydbg1.1 to do the same thing, using libclang for C/C++ struct/class parser. Not done yet, as now the main problem is the gui, not the pasering. I can share the code if you deside use libclang to implement.\n\nOriginal comment by: lynnux\n. would be great if you could send me your source!

All data is interpreted however you want to. I will keep the issue open, in case these binary templates are going to make it.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Should we close this and 'move' it to https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/175?\n. Except Windows does support tracing, however undocumented. DR7 bits are already set with hardware breakpoints, so this is no different.\ntl;dr\nNow, how do we access DebugCtl from usermode? It's simple, and Windows provides access to both BTF\nand LBR bits of DebugCtl via bits 8 and 9 of DR7. If interested, see KiRestoreDebugRegisterState.\n.

Hi,\nThanks for your report, I tried to reproduce your issue, but everything is working well on my side of the planet. Could you please make a screen recording that shows the bug and how to reproduce it in detail? Please show the results of bplist after deleting each hardware breakpoint and please also show the values of the debug registers, I suspect something is wrong with them.\nThe message You can only set 4 hardware breakpoints can only occur when DeleteHardwareBreakpoint failed. This should show up on your log.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. I will try to reproduce it again, sometimes the bug happens and sometimes not, I will see what extra information I can get, but I think the bug will eventually happen again. Is the information in the log window saved anywhere on the disk?\n\nOriginal comment by: Demonic Sword\n. It seems I cannot reproduce the issue again but I am sure it happened twice while analyzing user32.dll and explorer.exe. This issue can be ignored until someone is able to make it happen again.\n\nOriginal comment by: Demonic Sword\n. waiting for more information (or a successful reproduction of myself)\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. I confirm the bug, while executing my script for lARP64, x64_dbg hangs and says: \"You can only set 4 hardware breakpoints\". In the script I set/clear sometimes HWBPs but I always have max 2 HWBPs active at the same time (never reached 4), and the HWBP counter (looked at it with Cheat Engine 6.3) is set at the right value (2 = HWBPs active, not 4 as x64_dbg says). I can reproduce it with my script (horrible script for the moment but I need it to analyze in a straightforward way lARP64). I can try to use \"Enable/Disable HWBP\" command to test.\nSo I think it's not a \"counter\" problem for what I can say ;)\nIf you need something I can test and report to you as soon as I have time. You can contact me here or at tuts4you (we had some chats past year). Keep up the good work and don't worry about the bug for the moment, it happens in some corner case I think.\n\nOriginal comment by: Matteo Favaro\n. I can confirm and I think I can reproduce it.  \nPlace an hwbp somewhere, then:\nTest 1:\nrun, you break on it for the first time: in the list you can see your HWBP\nF7/sti/Step Into, you break on it for the second time (you didn't move): in the list your HWBP has disappeared\nF7/sti/Step Into, you are on the subsequent instruction, just how it should be: your HWBP is there again!!!\nNow you can issue a bphwc and set a new HWBP: the same slot will be used -> it has been effectively freed.\nTest 2:\nrun, you break on it for the first time: in the list you can see your HWBP\nnow issue a bphwc, or just right click->Remove Hardware, the important thing is that you ask x64dbg to clear the HWBP: the slot is now empty as expected\nF7/sti/Step Into, you break on it for the second time (you didn't move): in the list the slot is still empty -> good\nF7/sti/Step Into, you are on the subsequent instruction: slot still empty\nNow set a new hwbp: BOOM!!! The NEXT slot is used!!!  \nThe only loaded plugins when this has been tested were the default Scylla and MultiASM, no ScyllaHide in the way.\n(BTW by slot I mean the DRx register in the registers pane)\n(I'm sorry for the number of edits, gotta get used to MD's rules about linebreaks)\n\nOriginal comment by: SmilingWolf\n. Test confirmed, the bug is triggered in this way. I also managed to crash the debugger in this way :)\n\nOriginal comment by: Matteo Favaro\n. alright, I reopened the issue. I will check it out when I have more time.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. this bug was fixed in TitanEngine (https://bitbucket.org/mrexodia/titanengine-update/commits/3462c000e0c13d4153ee6547f9a5cd3573e04229)\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. this happens when you sort by name. probably this is because of qSort that cannot really know which one should come first\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n.

Me too. I'm using Avira. But I think Avira isn't the reason for this problem.\n\nOriginal comment by: Ji Young Shim\n. What do you think the reason is for the problem? After some testing with Dreg I managed to get a BSOD because of this problem. All working fine on my laptop (Win 8.1 x64) and also working on Dreg's pc.\nI traced the issue to a piece of code in x32_bridge.dll, but when I remove the code it will crash on a different place.\nI'm still working on this, but I already wasted a full day, don't really feel like continuing with tests.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Do you have a memory/info dump from the BSOD?\n\nOriginal comment by: Nukem9\n. Yea.. it's a crash in explorer. Something with MiRemoveVadCharges\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Have you found the reason of this problem & make a solve method for it yet, Mr. eXodia?\n\nOriginal comment by: Ji Young Shim\n. Nukem discovered this happens because VirtualProtect and VirtualQuery are called at the same time (it seems like a windows bug). There is nothing I can do right now.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Good job man. I'm waiting for a new upfate.\nAh, when do you make the function that mark begin-end of the sub-routine (like Analysis code function in the OllyDbg) ??\n\nOriginal comment by: Ji Young Shim\n. Analysis is currently very low on the agenda. Stability is the first thing. After that I will probably work on plugin support, but I don't know when I have more time.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. this is something we cannot fix. probably it will be fixed in a later update\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. have no idea where it went, i dont have it..\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n.

TitanEngine is compiled with SDK for previous window versions which had different debugging structures (and code do not differentiate them basing on OS - it just uses old ones). It won't even compile on Win8.1 SDK until you fix it manually in source. So it may be unstable on new systems as guys work mainly on archaic vs2010(the worst visual version ever created)/win7 environment and possibly aren't aware of such issues.\nTo sum up: use it on Win8+ at your own risk ;) However it works fine in most cases, at least for me.\n\nOriginal comment by: kampber\n. I don't really know what you're talking about. I developed x64_dbg on Windows 8.1 x64 with VS2010 (VS13 is the worst performing IDE I even encountered, especially with a few Addins installed). I never experienced any random crashes with TitanEngine. Could you point out specifically which structures you're talking about. As far as I'm aware Microsoft didn't change the DEBUG_EVENT structure since Windows 95.\nI'll try compiling everything with VS2013 later this evening, but currently there is only support for compiling with VS2010.\nTry the latest snapshot, it is fully tested on Win 8.1 x64.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Maybe I'm overreacting when talking about vs2010 but at time it was released it was not usable due to constant crashes, compatibility issues with SDKs and other things. Basically nobody used it in serious projects and simply skipped that version, but I suppose quite serious number of these could be already fixed and it is quite fine to use. If it is, then good for you.\nMain points:\nYou can develop it on newest windows, but if you use old SDK it doesn't really matter. Even if you use the latest SDK, vs2010 can (and unfortunately - often do) quietly use headers installed with it (the old ones) over these in SDK.\nI didn't experience any crashess too, I said only about compilation being based on old header files. Aand to answer the question, _FLOATING_SAVE_AREA structure no longer have Cr0NpxState member used in TitanEngine. If it compiles fine for you, then you are using old windows headers (aforementioned well-known issue with vs2010). \nEverything compiles fine on vs2013 with correct SDK headers (after little fixes on issues like this) so no need to waste your time if you don't plan to officially support it in near future. Just fix your headers :P\n\nOriginal comment by: kampber\n. Currently VS10 is stable indeed :) Anyways, thanks for pointing out the issue with Cr0NpxState. It looks like they renamed it to Spare0:\ntypedef struct _FLOATING_SAVE_AREA {\n    ULONG   ControlWord;\n    ULONG   StatusWord;\n    ULONG   TagWord;\n    ULONG   ErrorOffset;\n    ULONG   ErrorSelector;\n    ULONG   DataOffset;\n    ULONG   DataSelector;\n    UCHAR   RegisterArea[SIZE_OF_80387_REGISTERS];\n    ULONG   Spare0;\n} FLOATING_SAVE_AREA;\nI'll just remove the references to FLOATING_SAVE_AREA.Cr0NpxState we don't use the value anyway.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Great!\n\nOriginal comment by: kampber\n. issue was resolved\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. yara integrated :)\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Awsome\nWell done.\n\nOriginal comment by: storm_shadow\n. Hi, thanks for the report. It has been previously discussed in issue #247 (I think)\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. I'm not sure that it's the same issue. The linked issue mentions complete system hang and BSOD, while this one seems like a hang inside WaitForSingleObject.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. I could reproduce it again, and it seems like the debugger hangs in a call to SymFromAddr, which uses a critical section internally.\nThe MSDN documentation says the following:\n\nAll DbgHelp functions, such as this one, are single threaded. Therefore, calls from more than one thread to this function will likely result in unexpected behavior or memory corruption. To avoid this, you must synchronize all concurrent calls from more than one thread to this function.\n\nx64_dbg probably calls the DbgHelp functions from secondary threads too, which causes this behavior.\nIn general, while taking a brief look at the code of x64_dbg, I got the impression that it's not very thread-safe. Multithreading is very tricky in C++, every access to a global variable has to be synchronized, as well as every call to a third party (e.g. WinAPI) function which isn't designed to be thread safe.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. hm, i tried to be quite thread safe in general (mainly in stuff like module/label/breakpoint/whatever lists), but you're right. i never checked thread-safely for dbghelp functions. will add an issue for it.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. I think that it might be related to the goto dialog, which runs some code in separate threads.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. might be, i'll make wrappers for dbghelp functions real quick and you can test again after that.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. You're right as far as the critical section goes, but I've been trying to making synchronization better. Sym* functions are harder to do this with because of how they are used: multithreaded so the entire debugger doesn't lock up. Don't know of any good way to resolve this at the moment.\n\nOriginal comment by: Nukem9\n. I saw the commit, waiting for a snapshot/release :)\nThe issue doesn't always happen, so I won't be able to provide immediate feedback, but I'll keep an eye on it after updating.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. snapshot should be available in a few mins on http://snapshots.x64dbg.com\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. Does anyone know if this was resolved yet?\n\nOriginal comment by: Nukem9\n. I haven't encountered it with the new version. That doesn't guarantee that the issue is gone, but the deadlock was clearly inside the SymFromAddr function, so I assume that it's indeed fixed.\nI think the issue can be closed for now, and if I, or somebody else, will encounter it again, we can always reopen it.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. (See above message)\n\nOriginal comment by: Nukem9\n. there is no analysis in x64_dbg, so a command would be pointless\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. it's the desired behavior\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n.

Is its source code in the repository?\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. The DLL Loader source code is here it looks like the library is never even loaded, which would mean there was a problem in the library loader. Here is a loader with error reporting:\n```\n!c++\ninclude \nwchar_t szLibraryPath[512];\nint main()\n{\n    memset(szLibraryPath, 0, sizeof(szLibraryPath));\n    wchar_t szName[256] = L\"\";\n    wsprintfW(szName, L\"Global\\szLibraryName%X\", (unsigned int)GetCurrentProcessId());\n    HANDLE hMapFile = OpenFileMappingW(FILE_MAP_READ, false, szName);\n    if(hMapFile)\n    {\n        const wchar_t szLibraryPathMapping = (const wchar_t)MapViewOfFile(hMapFile, FILE_MAP_READ, 0, 0, sizeof(szLibraryPath));\n        if(szLibraryPathMapping)\n        {\n            lstrcpyW(szLibraryPath, szLibraryPathMapping);\n            UnmapViewOfFile(szLibraryPathMapping);\n        }\n        else\n            MessageBoxW(0, L\"MapViewOfFile failed!\", L\"Error\", MB_SYSTEMMODAL|MB_ICONERROR);\n        CloseHandle(hMapFile);\n        if(szLibraryPath[0])\n            return (LoadLibraryW(szLibraryPath) != NULL);\n        else\n            MessageBoxW(0, L\"szLibraryPath is empty!\", L\"Error\", MB_SYSTEMMODAL|MB_ICONERROR);\n    }\n    else\n        MessageBoxW(0, szName, L\"OpenFileMappingW failed!\", MB_SYSTEMMODAL|MB_ICONERROR);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. OpenFileMappingW fails with error 2, file not found.\nNow, while debugging x64_dbg, I see that a call to CreateFileMappingW (called from titanengine) fails with error 5, access denied. If I run x64_dbg with admin rights, it indeed seems to work.\nA couple of notes:\n- I believe that it can be fixed by changing L\"Global\\\\szLibraryName%X\" to L\"Local\\\\szLibraryName%X\", unless x64_dbg is expected to be able to debug libraries which are loaded in a different session. I don't think x64_dbg is designed for these kinds of stuff, and if it is, it should probably be optional, as the use case is much less common.\n- It would be much easier to spot the error if it would be written to the log.\n- It would be great if x64_dbg would show the GetLastError value somewhere near the registers, like OllyDbg does.\n\nOriginal comment by: RaMMicHaeL\n. Here is a fixed TitanEngine: http://ge.tt/api/1/files/9tKTsjD2/0/blob?download I started implementing getting the error code name from the value and then it should be very easy to add the last error to the register view. Will do it in my live stream tomorrow :)\nGlobal -> Local fix will be available in the next uploaded snapshot.\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. The fix works as expected, thanks.\n\nI started implementing getting the error code name from the value\n\nThe error number will be good enough for a start.

GUI: resolved issue #270 (crash when nothing is selected in the Yara dialog)\n-> <>\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. This is intentional. Programs with massive symbol lists that take various GBs of RAM will have terribly slow enumeration of the symbols making x64dbg unusable for far longer than needed on startup. I could make an option for this, but clicking the module shouldn't be too much of a hassle right?\n\nOriginal comment by: mrexodia\n. If its intentional, then thats ok, a clicking we shall go :D.

Commit fd92753 should have fixed this I think.\n\nOriginal comment by: Nukem9\n. Site links have been updated for a while now. Closed.\n. This happens because of jansson.dll using msvcr100.dll and x64dbg itself using msvcr120.dll.\nFILE* is incompatible:  https://bitbucket.org/mrexodia/x64_dbg/src/b0f06aeeb5eff1a4f41257ab8b6691fd0d2ab9c5/x64_dbg_dbg/addrinfo.cpp?at=master#cl-46\nI can't fix this (don't have access to snapshots to update Jansson)\n\nOriginal comment by: Nukem9\n. Thanks for your reply Nukem9,\nI tried something trivial which is simply compiling jansson.dll in VS 2013 so it would depend on msvcr120.dll,\nand it worked so the problem is partially solved (no more crashes) but another one came up,\nafter setting the required BPs and comments then restarting the process, both BPs and the comments are gone from the Disassembly window only .\nThe debugger still broke on the address and i can see all the BPs and the comments in their corresponding tabs,\nso the BPs are still there and effective.\nAnother thing is that at the bottom-left status bar (exactly after breaking) i got the error message: \"breakpoint reached not in list!\"\ni guess this is all because of the in-compatibility right?\n\nOriginal comment by: w k\n. It's probably the incompatibility with more dlls. I don't know which ones mrexodia recompiled with VS2013.\n\nOriginal comment by: Nukem9\n. Moved to GitHub, this no longer matters.\n. Seems to work fine now with the latest commit. Closing when someone else can confirm this.\n. *As a note, this happens because an INT3 is inserted in the middle of the command. (This isn't visible in the debugger, must be checked with an external memory viewer)\n. No issuer response. Considered to be fixed -> closed.\n. Is this considered done now? Also - is the number of dump tabs only limited to 5?\n. StackWalk64? It's single-threaded unfortunately, but I don't think it is used anywhere besides the GUI code.\n. https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/commit/ac9953fb7c873f9c512770668e691a4893b38d06\n. Technically fixed in https://github.com/Nukem9/x64dbg/commit/eda641f6a77e709b1623f0a731b9eb4231c40941, however the old code was axed....\n. Unable to reproduce (although I use Win8). Are you using the latest snapshot?\n. Weird. I'll install Windows 7 on a virtual machine later to check it.\n. It almost sounds like a threading issue. I know that a background thread runs when you type something (searching for symbols, might cause a lock), but i'm still unable to reproduce it. I've tried it many times now.\n. The only reason I can think of this happening is because of mValidateThread->terminate(); The thread might be running in the background, but then is terminated in the middle of a function, leaving random bugs.\nI still can't get it to crash (1 cpu core allocated, underclocked to 2.0GHz). @mrexodia any idea?\n. https://github.com/cppformat/cppformat\nConsider above link if this issue is ever actually referenced or implemented.\ndprintf(\"Delete hardware breakpoint failed: {0:fhex}\\n\", bp->addr);\n. Appears to be fixed. \n\n. Should be easy enough to fix with a call to SymUninitialize(). AFAIK it's only called when the debugger exits right now.\n. Is this still a problem? I haven't had an error like this in awhile.\n. I'm assuming these two things are related: https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/312#issuecomment-111004421\n. See https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/commit/aa46809c93c7f8416a162596f7d34af361ee79df\n. @elicn If you really wish to contribute I can set up a VM image. You just need a fast enough internet connection. I don't know of any website to upload a large file like that.\n. Thanks for the info!\n1.\n2147942408 translates to 0x80070008 - not enough storage is available to process this command. I don't know the exact reason for this right now.\n2.\nOne question (if you have time): if you open crashdump.cpp and go to this line in your own repository, do they match? Based on the generated .dmp files it should be impossible for them to even exist.\n. Yeah that was what I worried about. != should be == .....this is fixed in the newest commits.\n. Thanks. There's a Windows bug with the 0-byte dmp files I guess. Nothing I can do.\nHowever, I managed to reproduce an exception myself (it takes around 500 restarts)\n0:004> kb\nChildEBP RetAddr  Args to Child              \n00d3bdd0 750f43a1 00000000 00000000 00000000 USER32!NtUserWaitMessage+0xc\n00d3be18 750e4fcd 00000000 00000000 00000000 USER32!DialogBox2+0x13f\n00d3be48 750ef907 00000000 750ee3f0 00d3c090 USER32!InternalDialogBox+0x107\n00d3bf14 750ef06d 00d3c090 5517f630 00000000 USER32!SoftModalMessageBox+0xe2c\n00d3c078 7513781b 5517f630 25649f20 00000000 USER32!MessageBoxWorker+0x293\n00d3c0fc 7513777b 00000000 5517f630 25649f20 USER32!MessageBoxTimeoutW+0x6b\n00d3c130 751375bb 00000000 00d3c184 011c2168 USER32!MessageBoxTimeoutA+0x7b\n00d3c150 75137588 00000000 00d3c184 011c2168 USER32!MessageBoxExA+0x1b\n00d3c16c 011c1207 00000000 00d3c184 011c2168 USER32!MessageBoxA+0x18\n00d3c588 011c11a5 011c2254 8007001f 00000000 x32dbg!CrashDumpFatal+0x47 [e:\\projects\\x64_dbg\\x64_dbg_exe\\crashdump.cpp @ 40]\n00d3c9d0 011c127a 00d3c9f8 00d3ca2c 77286846 x32dbg!CrashDumpCreate+0x185 [e:\\projects\\x64_dbg\\x64_dbg_exe\\crashdump.cpp @ 87]\n00d3c9dc 77286846 00d3c9f8 00d3cb28 00d3cad8 x32dbg!CrashDumpVectoredHandler+0x1a [e:\\projects\\x64_dbg\\x64_dbg_exe\\crashdump.cpp @ 101]\n00d3ca2c 772ed8e1 00000000 00d3d000 00000000 ntdll!RtlpCallVectoredHandlers+0xba\n00d3cac0 772c09bf 00d3cad8 00d3cb28 00d3cad8 ntdll!RtlDispatchException+0x72\n00d3cac0 74f9b61d 00d3cad8 00d3cb28 00d3cad8 ntdll!KiUserExceptionDispatcher+0xf\n00d3cf94 53ab838f 00d3d000 00000000 00000002 msvcrt!memcpy+0x198\n00d3cfb0 53ab7332 00000000 00000000 00000000 dbghelp!ReadImageData+0x4c\n00d3d370 53ab6bc7 c3fd9543 7b5d4800 7b605bb8 dbghelp!ReadHeader+0x171\n00d3d3a8 53ab5afe c3fd9ea3 750c0000 00000000 dbghelp!imgReadLoaded+0xad\n00d3d848 53ab611c 76bd2170 00ae4740 00000000 dbghelp!modload+0x1a6\n00d3dcbc 53aafb3a 00000000 750c0000 00000000 dbghelp!LoadModule+0x309\n00d3dd18 507c22c8 00002964 00002afc 00ae4740 dbghelp!SymLoadModuleEx+0x45\n00d3dd50 507c6510 00002964 00002afc 00d3e6d4 x32dbg_50790000!SafeSymLoadModuleEx+0x38 [e:\\projects\\x64_dbg\\x64_dbg_dbg\\dbghelp_safe.cpp @ 76]\n00d3ede4 53c5e4c2 53cbb6dc 507c43e0 507c43e0 x32dbg_50790000!cbLoadDll+0x160 [e:\\projects\\x64_dbg\\x64_dbg_dbg\\debugger.cpp @ 839]\nWARNING: Stack unwind information not available.

I can't cause it to crash any longer. ba63ac30576c674ba6c3182fdec6fa3ce536e14f seems to have fixed it. Just waiting for your confirmation.\n. Is the game fullscreen? This might not be able to be fixed because of how Windows works.\n. Should be good to go. Thanks for all of that information.\n. Personally I'd merge this, but it is @mrexodia 's repo mainly and I don't know what he thinks of the changes.\n. We've never actually made the SDK to support other compilers. __declspec(dllexport) is Visual Studio only and not GCC. If you can get everything working that's great, but right now I can't do much to help (I don't know the replacements/differences).\n. If you added MS_VC_EXCEPTION to the ignored exceptions range, this might cause it to stop working also. I'm not sure if that has been changed since the last time I encountered it.\n. I thought about creating a separate plugin for SOS now that coreclr is open source. There still wouldn't be a way to name a thread without a plugin export.\n. Since .NET doesn't report thread names like the regular WinAPI does - closed. (Feature already implemented)\n. This will be fixed after https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/337 is implemented.\n. I like option 2 better. WriteProcessMemory/Flush then remove it from TitanEngine's database. Suspending threads can work except it would be incredibly slow or cause synchronization problems. (Not to mention a batch insert of breakpoints, i.e 10+ at once)\n. The newest snapshot isn't updated with each commit.\nNewest snapshot: July 14(?)\nFeature commit date: July 23\nAlso, why does it seem like everyone who posts a screenshot here has the same old Win7 theme?\n. It's not possible without the source. @mrexodia handles the build server (VPS afaik) and it doesn't automatically build anything.\nIf you really need the updated version I can compile it quickly and send it to you.\n. http://uppit.com/0wjh9wp3abg2/release.7z\n(Took longer than expected; forgot to reinstall VS2013/Qt32/Qt64)\n. The instruction assembling is another XEDParse bug, probably something to do with RIP-relativeness again.\n. See the bottom. (Unless if you are using an old version...?)\n\n. @mrexodia Since this is the 3rd(?) issue about this, even though it exists at the bottom, do you have any idea to make it more obvious?\n. QLineEdit::setPlaceholderText might be useful. Although it will just show faded gray \"Type here to filter results...\" text in the background (similar to what you find on some login pages).\n. https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg.github.io/commit/f706e41d422a71e8266ae7eeb00a3a1fb7a7b61e\nTechnically the issue doesn't apply to this repo. Closed anyway.\n. Nothing in the dump helps to determine the reason. My best guess is an integer overflow around x32dbg_e60000!_patchinrange looping forever (running on the GUI thread).\n. I have a feeling the problems are similar but the reasons behind it are different. Are you quickly pressing/spamming Ctrl+F2?\n. The thread is still running and alive at termination.\nhttps://bitbucket.org/titanengineupdate/titanengine-update/src/51208e22f3354be8aa4f9926b22cb683b174e431/TitanEngineLoaders/LibraryLoader/LibraryLoader.cpp?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default#LibraryLoader.cpp-22\nDllMain returns -> main() returns -> ExitProcess called, TestProcThread is still running (forcefully terminated)\n. This isn't within our control. It's a false positive most likely because of the imported functions used (Read/WriteProcessMemory), which are commonly in malware.\nAnyone will need to whitelist it manually.\n. The minidumps look like the result of a new exception status being used in OutputDebugStringW -> 0x4001000A (Windows 10, no results on google). I'll add it to the ignored exceptions for the minidump.\n. @TheAifam5 This isn't going to be fixed until my branch is merged or it is fixed in master.\n. @tr4ceflow just for reference, the old code is still in the 2 separate branches:\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/tree/flowgraph\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/tree/basic_analysis\n. *Assuming this is how the search is supposed to work: It only scans the entire range of a PE section. I.e if you are in .rdata it will only scan .rdata (or .text, .data, ....)\nYou can see the separated PE sections in the memory map view. They would need to be merged in the search function (I don't know what mrexodia will want to do)\n. x64dbg doesn't do automatic analysis yet. Symbols are probably being downloaded or used in the background. Try disabling symbols, then check the load time.\n. Invalid. User didn't have newest version.\n. What do you mean by \"it doesn't work\"\n. Probably better if this issue is closed and moved to GleeBug. x64dbg itself doesn't handle raw debug events.\n. Has been implemented (date unknown).\n. Should check if DEP is enabled on the process first: GetProcessDEPPolicy\n. http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qpixmap.html#grabWindow\nSignificantly easier to do this with Qt-only code and saving the file.\n. 0xCC is the breakpoint instruction, so TitanEngine is screwing up the command I guess. Less related to the debugger itself.\n. - was typing this, @wk-952 submitted before I did\nProblem 1:\n- You probably found a bug in XEDParse\nProblem 2/3:\n- My branch still uses BeaEngine, so Capstone is just being parsed differently when displayed (and can probably be fixed)\n. Fixed now with the merge?\n. https://github.com/x64dbg/XEDParse/issues/1\n. Should be fixed in https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/commit/0d17101ba87e9e4414a9af13d378e4653fe9bd3c. Nothing messes with the cursor anymore.\n. This would probably be easiest by doing if (DbgIsDebugging()) return; at this line. Headers would still be drawn, but no content (values) would be.\nDon't know of any other global ways to do that right now.\n. Just to clarify - he means to view the file offset itself, similar to a hex editor, not the relative virtual address.\nThe infobox is:\nMOUDLE[RVA] | SECTION:VA\nMaybe something like this could work:\nMODULE[RVA:FILE_OFFSET] | SECTION:VA\n. Given that it runs on a separate thread from everything else, I wouldn't be worried about it very much.\n. Yeah the branches are fine. I think having a master and development should be good enough.\n. Alternatively, string could be renamed to aSomeString, similar to IDA.\n__imp__ is a prefix to a pointer (i.e call dword ptr [__imp__GetCurrentProcess]). I don't think they should be filtered, but should be renamed.\n. Probably want to filter these too.\n\n. Possibly related to #427.\nFor your second question:\nAs it stands right now, there's no way to analyze dumps. The executable needs to be able to run (as far as CreateProcess is concerned).\n. Holding down Ctrl+F2 has been crashing since before the commit you have (at least in my branch). Same reason: Fault Module Name: StackHash_5e69\nIt's probably related, I'll try to figure out what the problem is.\nedit: just ran into a million other start/stop bugs now\n. ScyllaHide does hooking and modifies your program at runtime. If ScyllaHide does something wrong, you program crashes. Using antidebug is irrelevant.\nedit: do you mean \"Scylla\" or \"ScyllaHide\"? They're completely different.\n. If you do figure out the reason, please let us know. Chances are you won't be the last person to report this. Closed for now.\n. Duplicate: #443.\n. I remembered this repo today: https://github.com/zyantific/REtypedef\nIt would fit perfectly with the filter callback. Or use some kind of regex.\n. @wk-952 are you using x64dbg 24/7 or something? Very nice job finding all of these bugs.\n@mrexodia:\nExpression unchanged\nSigned only allows an optional negative and then numbers\nUnsigned only allows numbers\nNo idea if this was the original intent.\n. Duplicate of #254.\n. You forgot commandline.cpp/.h\n. @zwestfall same thing as #492 - you either need to compile it for qt5 or use that custom resolution. Qt4 doesn't support Hi-DPI natively.\n. It's because Xed itself also requires an explicit FPU operand, even though the instruction itself only uses one single operand.\ni.e\nfistp qword ptr ss:[esp] Real instruction. Not parsed correctly.\nfistp qword ptr ss:[esp], st0 Fake instruction. Parsed correctly to DF 3C 24\nI'll have to determine a way to make this automatic.\n. If you want to make a giant list from the IFORM enum, sure.\nIt's probably easier to just do if (strstr(xed_iform_to_string(iformType), \"_st0\"))\n. https://github.com/x64dbg/XEDParse/commit/d3f8d6fd5440624a4825c99e3bf4a4f519ad416a\nFixed in x64dbg when xedparse.dll is replaced.\n.

While this is a bug, it's still pretty funny. #454 is related.\n@mrexodia it seems like Qt4 doesn't have any support for Hi-DPI resolutions. QT_DEVICE_PIXEL_RATIO might be a workaround.\n(Similar issue, different project)\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/stellarium/+bug/1372781/comments/10\nfinal: Qt 5.3 has initial support of 4K monitors. I guess Qt 5.4 and, better, Qt 5.5 has more good support of 4K monitors.\nApparently you need build Stellarium from source code with Qt 5.4.1 or Qt 5.5.\n. Reason: it's inferred that cbCreateProcess will always be called. On attach a process is not created, so the function is never called. cbCreateProcess calls DbLoad.\nFix: Add DbLoad to threadAttachLoop.\n@wk-952 any idea how long this bug has existed? I don't think debugger attaching code has been modified in a long time. Seems like this bug was missed for a while.\n. There's no need to check where. I was just wondering if you knew or not. (I can check myself)\n. see: https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/commit/81117392ecd37e8dcc53b25326145d3cfaf39c9f\n. This will be working correctly when TitanEngine is replaced. https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/commit/2b03693bf67042c11e8293eea6acf5314903d52d is part of it.\n. mrexodia:\nShould x64dbg create a dbname.dd32.bak as a copy of the database before loading it in DbLoad()?\nAs far as the hanging part.......some kind of timeout could throw an exception after X seconds. Won't be necessary if the root cause is found.\nwk-952:\nTask manager should allow you to create a dump file, though I don't know if it's present in all windows versions. (The DMP from here should be kept/uploaded privately).\n\n. The idea is alright, but what is the purpose? Why not just use a launcher program or the Windows taskbar shortcuts?\n. Untested - I'm too lazy right now.\n. Probably something to do with capstone directly. VMX instructions are relatively \"unused\" and they don't always check all ring0 ones.\nSame for IDA 6.1 afaik.\n. x64dbg vs process hacker\napisetschema.dll silenty fails:\n\n\nRandomly mapped (MAP) dlls work:\n\n\nEvery other IMG map besides opera.exe fails:\n\n\nNotice that some of the memory protection constants are also broken. I have no idea what's going on.\n. Can't reproduce on windows 8. What OS version are you running?\n. \nor do you mean the syntax...?\n. Or in this matter, any function declared as __declspec(noreturn). exit/abort/RaiseException are a few others.\n. I don't know what you are talking about. 0x82 is not a valid starting opcode for any instruction.\n. I've seen a few typos/incorrect entries in Intel's manuals before. None of the specific instruction tables match:\n(pages)\nadd  95\nor   701\nadc  90\nsbb  1036\nand  121\nsub  1085\nxor  1271\ncmp  209\nI see 0x80/0x81/0x83 but not 0x82.... Unless I'm blind, google doesn't show anything either.\nDoes it execute? If you press F7 and single-step, does it work?\n. Fixed with the newest capstone version. \n\n. Everything, including config, is written to disk under the x64dbg folder. It should all be portable except for x96dbg.exe and JIT options in the menu.\n* Ignoring the Visual Studio 2013 redistributable install\n. It's not so much a bug....rather it's a regular C++ exception (throw) being caught by my handler instead of the runtime dll. I'll swap AddVectoredExceptionHandler for SetUnhandledExceptionFilter, which should fix it.\nnote for later: might not work on certain machines\n. Added code which should hopefully* work around that bug.\nMeanwhile at Microsoft:\n```\nRestart requirement\nYou must restart the computer after you apply this hotfix.\n```\n. It varies. Usually occurs when using F8 after starting a program:\nINT3 breakpoint \"entry breakpoint\" at x64dbg.WinMainCRTStartup (00007FF6FA7615F4)!\nProgram is already running\nProgram is already running\nProgram is already running\nProgram is already running\nProgram is already running\nProgram is already running\nProgram is already running\n. Threads tab -> right click -> Resume Thread\n?\n. How will this work? As soon as RIP moves to CreateProcessW+0x1, RCX/RDX/R8/R9 will be invalid as far as the debugger knows.\n. Can't reproduce. Crashdump says the fault was in std::map/CapstoneTokenizer.\n. Reproduced. This only happens when a process is created and not when manually suspending with Process Hacker->Suspend Process.\nReason: Process hasn't been initialized. PEB isn't initialized. Ldr isn't fully initialized.\n\n. #341\n. Checked with SkyrimSELauncher.exe. Was fixed sometime between Nov 2 and Nov 9 snapshots.\n. Patch dialog crash @ https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/development/src/gui/Src/Gui/PatchDialog.cpp#L50\nInvalid CRT function @ https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/development/src/dbg/_exports.cpp#L1070\nCRT is related to #731 because the string needs to be truncated.\n. It's not a bot, GitHub's issue tracker is (ironically) broken on certain browsers.\nIf you look at the html source:\nclass=\"form-control input-contrast comment-form-textarea js-comment-field js-improved-comment-field js-task-list-field js-quick-submit js-size-to-fit js-suggester-field js-quote-selection-target js-session-resumable\"\n              >IssueReport</textarea>\n. enable heap debugging and/or callstack traces\n. Could you please move/reopen this issue in the XEDParse repo?\n. So you need a feature to list all of the strings like IDA does, even unreferenced ones...Right now only addresses with a memory reference (dword ptr [0xDEADCODE]) will show up.\n. This fails because BpGet is using the address of the breakpoint only. The name is blank so it doesn't search for it. Module isn't loaded -> ModHashFromAddr fails.\n@ViRb3 if you really need to delete them, you can set a name for the breakpoints (then remove em). Otherwise you'll need to wait.\n. Isnt this default behavior? Explorer.exe exits when there's more than 1 instance?\n. Why is this a problem?\n. potentially related\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/755\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/514\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/635\nGetMappedFileName can get around these problems since it's a call to NtQueryVirtualMemory.\n. \n\n. I see what you mean. DllLoader64.exe runs and the 32-bit dll is never loaded. The process just exits, but there should be an error instead.\nThis file is a dotNET application.\nDatabase file: C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\snapshot_2016-10-24_23-38\\release\\x64\\db\\symsrv_test_noext32.dd64\nProcess Started: 00007FF634C80000 C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\snapshot_2016-10-24_23-38\\release\\x32\\DLLLoader64_253C.exe\nDLL Loaded: 00007FFCA84B0000 C:\\Windows\\System32\\ntdll.dll\nDLL Loaded: 00007FFCA8370000 C:\\Windows\\System32\\kernel32.dll\nDLL Loaded: 00007FFCA57A0000 C:\\Windows\\System32\\KernelBase.dll\nDLL Loaded: 00007FFCA62B0000 C:\\Windows\\System32\\user32.dll\nDLL Loaded: 00007FFCA7B90000 C:\\Windows\\System32\\gdi32.dll\nSystem breakpoint reached!\nBreakpoint at 00007FFCA8111040 set!\nDLL Loaded: 00007FFCA8110000 C:\\Windows\\System32\\imm32.dll\nBreakpoint at 00007FFCA6501160 set!\nDLL Loaded: 00007FFCA6500000 C:\\Windows\\System32\\msctf.dll\nBreakpoint at 00007FFCA5CF2790 set!\nDLL Loaded: 00007FFCA5CF0000 C:\\Windows\\System32\\msvcrt.dll\nINT3 breakpoint \"DllMain (msvcrt.dll)\" at <msvcrt.EntryPoint> (00007FFCA5CF2790)!\nINT3 breakpoint \"DllMain (msctf.dll)\" at <msctf.EntryPoint> (00007FFCA6501160)!\nINT3 breakpoint \"DllMain (imm32.dll)\" at <imm32.EntryPoint> (00007FFCA8111040)!\nProcess stopped with exit code 0x0\nSaving database to C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\snapshot_2016-10-24_23-38\\release\\x64\\db\\symsrv_test_noext32.dd64 0ms\nDebugging stopped!\n\n. dd_float128 was only used because I couldn't find any other simple big number math library.

My ideas was to create an internal symbol cache and in that way eliminate dbghelp symbol functions (mostly because they are slow as fuck). Then we could have various types of symbols load in this cache...\n\nThis can help: https://github.com/rainers/cv2pdb\n. @gargle256 no, for now you can use cv2pdb to get debug symbols with anything dwarf.. It does not? The exe is clean and only needs windows xp.. Ah okay, so just install Visual Studio and be done with it? You can do the conversions on any machine you want, after that you can copy the pdb/exe around and debug anywhere you need. Using cv2pdb is only a workaround until somebody decides to implement something better, which has not been done until now.. If you want to go be a dick, do it elsewhere.

Looking great! Please don't forget to run install.bat so your commits are auto-formatted. Also for expression parser performance you can store an ExpressionParser object from 07f18d44 directly in the BREAKPOINT structure. This saves tokenization and preprocessing the expression to RPN. To serialize you can use the new GetExpression().c_str().\n. Alright I'll run the formatter later in that case :+1: \n. Yeah that's true, probably better to leave it for now it can always be changed in the future.\n. Currently plugins have access to far more than they are supposed to. I worked on a rewrite for the communication interface (effectively making the bridge obsolete). This would solve issues like this (by simply making these structures unavailable to plugins).\nhttps://github.com/mrexodia/TemplateHacks\nThe amount of macro/template stuff makes me doubt this method though. It is far prettier (and adding a new message is far far easier) but it might be confusing especially if it bugs out.\n. Have been playing around a little bit with the conditional breakpoints (also made logging support format  strings), but I don't quite understand how logging is supposed to work. Should it log every time the breakpoint is hit or should it only log when the condition resolved to 1?\n. Ah makes sense! I pushed some small changes but I consider the issue closed. Thanks a lot, really appreciated!\n. I rewrote some of the conditional breakpoint code to drastically reduce the code size (all the logic is in one inline function now), could you please check if everything is still working as intended?\nI only changed the thing where logging was not executed if the breakpoint hit. I also added logging condition and command condition allowing people to log/execute a command under certain conditions (separately from the already implemented break condition).\n. You cannot directly at the moment. Eventually there will be a command built in that executes a script so you can then do that. For now you'll have to write a plugin that has a custom command that executes the commands you want to execute :+1: \n. Well if you set your break condition to 0 (never break) you can just write\n\"mov rsi, 2\" as command.\nOn Fri, 1 Jul 2016 at 13:34, MrIQZero notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThanks MrExodia, I'll look into custom plugins too, but for now here is\nwhat i want to do, when a hardware breakpoint is hit i want to do 2 things.\n1.

The prerequisite for any breakpoint is that you know where you want to break. If your question is: \"Where is EAX equal to 5?\" You can try conditional tracing, but this is very slow.\nIgnore the bplist command. The breakpoint tab is all you need..

Right, thought you were talking about the ret instruction. there is no way to detect if a call is going to return or not (this is called the halting problem). Therefore you should use 'StepInto' instead. Memory breakpoint on [esp] is possible, but it would break on a shitload of things, since you cannot memory breakpoint on less than 0x1000 bytes.\n.

It will be resolved by hiding the debugger in the PEB (use the dbh command).\nThe magic happens somewhere in ntdll.vDbgPrintExWithPrefixInternal in case somebody wants to research this.

Great work!\n\nI just checked, the call to ExHandlerGetSEH in stackcommentget is too much overhead (especially when there is more than 1 SEH entry). The main reason being that it is called ~20 times on each repaint. A possible solution is an unordered_map that gets populated in the updateSEHChainThread (making performance not matter) and then do lookups in this map in the stackcommentget function.\nThis requires a new SRW lock (threading.h). If you remove the part in stackcommentget I will accept the pull so people can have a dedicated SEH view to start with. Then the performance critical part can be updated later.\n. You will always need locks because the map can be accessed from multiple\nthreads. Anyway stackcommentget is called on every redraw (which happens a\nlot). See my previous comment for the location that is called when the\nstack is modified (in the thread you create). I will try to make a code\nexample later this evening.\nOn Tue, 5 Apr 2016 at 19:55, Avin notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI'm wondering why stackcommentget is called that often?

Thanks a lot for your work, but this pull request will not be accepted as is. There are definitely changes I like a lot in this however.

Just a quick comment. I didn't forget about this pull request but since I disagree with certain changes I have to manually merge the changes I want for which I don't have much time at the moment.\n. I added the unicode support for symbol loading, the other parts still have to be added manually.\n. Are you unable to load them or are you referring to strings not being recognized and such?\nI didn't add the changes related to code pages yet and I'm currently not working on it. I also have some concerns regarding performance of the getFontWidth function. These being called in richTextPainter will probably drastically decrease single step performance.\n. Today I implemented code page views in the HexDump. @polelf if this feature is okay for you, could you re-fork the project so I can merge your pull requests again? The rest of your changed should also be implemented.\n. The name UTF-16 is confusing and I will change it. The only reason it exists is to print extended ASCII XX 00 characters. If you want to print real UTF-16 you can use the Text/Hex -> Codepage... option and it will print the text per-row and properly.\nSee here:\n//This might produce invalid characters in variables-width encodings. This is currently ignored.\ncurData.text = desc.textCodec->toUnicode(QByteArray((const char*)wData, wBufferByteCount));\ncurData.text.replace('\\t', \"\\\\t\");\ncurData.text.replace('\\f', \"\\\\f\");\ncurData.text.replace('\\v', \"\\\\v\");\ncurData.text.replace('\\n', \"\\\\n\");\ncurData.text.replace('\\r', \"\\\\r\");\nrichText.push_back(curData);\nThe reason I don't want to change the ASCII/UTF-16 is that certain non-English characters have a variable width (or even different from the English characters), so it makes per-unit printing/selection a complete hell.\nI forgot to add the UTF-8 conversion in the HexEdit dialog and I will also add your change with the process handles.\n. I do not want to change the current views, but obviously we can add new views that fit your needs.\n. Added various features from this pull request in 424c69bc and 749d5262 \n. @polelf I like the CodePageDialog as a dialog. It now also saves the last selection so the difference with a menu is minor.\n. Closed since all features were merged in. Please open a new pull request if you have new features.\n. duplicate of #368 \n. your resolution seems to be pretty low. anyway the reason is that there is a fixed size for the last column (because comments can usually be in there).

Yes I know. I plan to implement more flexible memory breakpoints (and tracing) in GleeBug.\n\nMemory breakpoints will never be faster though. To set a memory breakpoint you need VirtualProtect (which is really slow), then VirtualProtect again on hit of the breakpoint (restore original protection), then single step with the trap flag and finally restoring the memory breakpoint with VirtualProtect. If you are going to break on every instruction you have three VirtualProtect calls overhead over the single step you would have done anyway.\nAs for coverage, it can be useful as supplementary data, but one path through your program is not enough to cover all branch decisions so it cannot be immediately discarded from analysis. I think it would be very interesting to see how many times certain instructions are executed to identify code/memory hotspots.\nOne feature that could be implemented with what is available right now is history debugging. This is just for every DebugUpdateGui storing some context and then allowing to view these contexts in the disassembler.\n.

Why not just store a struct per byte covered? It's not like we are low on memory these days. This would also allow it to be extended very easily.

I've also used the edit FPU dialog many times in the past\nwithout issues (though probably only in Windows 7). I guess I will have to\nbuy a new CPU now since you broke it. Thanks a lot guys.\nAnyway, the relevant call stack (caller at top) seems to be:\n\nx64dbg.dll!setfpuvalue(string, value)\nTitanEngine.dll!SetContextDataEx(hActiveThread, IndexOfRegister,\n  NewRegisterValue)\nTitanEngine.dll!_GetFullContextDataEx(hActiveThread,\n titcontext, avx)\nif (avx) TitanEngine.dll!GetAVXContext(hActiveThread,\ntitcontext)\nGetThreadContext\n(value of to be updated register is copied...)\n\n\nTitanEngine.dll!_SetFullContextDataEx(hActiveThread,\n titcontext, AVX_PRIORITY)\n(another GetThreadContext...)\nSetThreadContext\nif (AVX_PRIORITY)\nTitanEngine.dll!SetAVXContext(hActiveThread, titcontext)\nGetThreadContext\nSetThreadContext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can't see anything wrong with the TE code per se, but that's mostly\nbecause it's doing so much unnecessary work that it's hard to make out what\nis really going on. But it also doesn't help that the AVX/XSTATE API in\nWindows is nearly nonexistent apart from a single 10 year old MSDN page.\nIt seems to me that for this specific case (setting a single value, or\neven setting ymm0-ymm15 all at once) there should be no need to call both\nGetThreadContext and SetThreadContext more than once each. I get that\nSetContextDataEx is supposed to be a generic multipurpose function, but\nthis is still something that reeks strongly of doing it wrong to me. Not\nthat I have any better suggestions at the moment - I'll have to read up on\nthe XSTATE API (or lack thereof).

At the moment this is not supported, you can follow #368 for progress (although I consider it to be a less important feature so it might take a long time).\n. Thanks!\n. Another way would be to suspend all threads and only resume them when the pause breakpoint is it right?\n. Yes that's a good point. However I'm not sure a GUI is needed also this change seems weird to me. Basically you 'lie' to the user about which thread reached the breakpoint first. The hActiveThread is only for the GUI.\n. Whatever works best for you, I don't really use the pause feature so I prefer a simple solution like this. The whole point is to break the debuggee so you can interact with it right?\n.

I'm still looking into this. Recently there have been some performance issues with x64dbg and while I don't think this will have much impact I still want to isolate some issues before getting into the performance of code folding.\n. Merged, thanks a lot!\n. I tried getting that in Keystone: https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone/issues/11\n. This should be fixed now\n. This should be resolved now.\n. Here is another instance of this happening (it causes really awful lag too):\n\n. I have full control over all the calls to SymGetLineFromAddrW64 so no hooks are needed. But this is indeed the idea.  I have started implementing fast alternatives in symcache.cpp but I'm still thinking of a good way to populate that cache without completely lagging x64dbg on module load.\nThe issue lies in:\n\nAll DbgHelp functions, such as this one, are single threaded. Therefore, calls from more than one thread to this function will likely result in unexpected behavior or memory corruption. To avoid this, you must synchronize all concurrent calls from more than one thread to this function.\n\nMy current idea is to have a dedicated thread for dbghelp calls. Then on module load it calls DbgHelpThreadLoadModule which will immediately return and then populate the symbols in the background, putting them all in the cache at once to avoid any performance problems. I'm still thinking of downsides, but the only one I currently see is the additional complexity of managing an extra thread.. Ah that's a good one! In that case it'll signal the dbghelp thread that a\nsymbol enumeration was requested and if those symbols are still in progress\nit will refresh the symbol list as soon as it can. In practice this will be\njust a minor timing issue since the user is unlikely to immediately click\nthe symbol tab just after the module is loaded.\nOn Sun, 9 Apr 2017 at 03:11, fearless notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nOff the top of my head only thing i can think off is if someone clicked on\nsymbols tab and clicked a module and started searching for symbol names\nwhilst a background thread was still processing and caching and the\nbackground thread was delayed for some reason (bug/searching etc?)\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/747#issuecomment-292756599, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmaICQt-fvA8aBHeMlCakSn7wn1oFks5ruDBXgaJpZM4I0uLY\n.\n.

Great! I think we should make sure the plugin cannot screw up references. This could be done by setting a custom allocator before the plugin handling. The reference count increase should go automatically if you allocate a new json object you don't have to do it manually as far as I know...\n. Yes but yoy don't need to increase the reference count, it should be handled automatically if you set something in the root object.\n. Right... We can just backup the reference count maybe and hard crash if it gets changed?\n. It was also already fixed. The dump no longer saves the position. Did I push a bad fix or are you on an older snapshot?\n. Also this is not a duplicate report. This is the right place to report issues \n.

Yes, I looked into it, but it has certain issues (for example in the disasm its completely useless and only drains performance).

From the top of my head I have no idea. You can probably try a greedy algorithm that sorts the nodes by size and takes the highest and tries to find two other nodes that add to this value, then repeat. If an invalid tree was found (eg values dont equal), backtrack and try three nodes. Pretty damn slow, but might work. You might also start with the two smallest nodes, add them together and put a root above them but it's still slow.\n. Currently fooling around with it. Some observations so far:\n- The root always has to be the breakpoint with the biggest counter to include all breakpoints\n- Trees can be infinitely deep by adding themselves as their child\n- Nodes with 0 can be placed infinitely all over the tree\n- It might not be always possible to form this tree: 10, 2\n. duplicate of #789\n.

Just a quick train of thought, we can enable only saving branches and inferring the execution path from that. Obviously this will not work in non-modules or self-modifying code but it will greatly decrease the size of the data produced.\n. I don't agree with 'must'.

I think the reason for this is that selection takes priority over function collapsing.

Also allow to change the hotkey for the CPU to ESC\n. implemented commands for data instructions, see http://help.x64dbg.com/en/latest/commands/data/index.html\n. For me the symbols server has been super unstable and weird, see https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/35a31403-24f5-4552-8e3c-4c65f2b98c17/microsoft-symbol-server-is-slowbroken?forum=windbg perhaps there will be a statement there.\n\nAs for exports, x64dbg does not parse them in any way, it relies on dbghelp for the names of exports. If exports have symbols it will use that name instead of the export name. You can still access the export by using \"module:ExportName\" as x64dbg will try GetProcAddress on that module.\nI have noticed issues with undecorated symbols, but it appears that private symbols do not have the decorated form stored:\n\nAll symbols are presented in undecorated form.\nThis option has no effect on global or local symbols because they are stored undecorated. This option applies only to public symbols.\n\nSymbols are indeed treated as labels (and should be), you can find the exact code here, maybe you can see an error with dbghelp somewhere, the documentation for that is very poor.\nNow, there has been a change related to security with the symbol options. Per default, x64dbg does not allow dbghelp to read the debug information of the program, since the symbol path can go to a network share which dbghelp will happily attempt to load from without warning or option to disable. You can try calling SymSetOptions(SymGetOptions() & ~SYMOPT_IGNORE_CVREC) from a plugin to see if it makes any difference.\n. The documentation of SYMOPT_UNDNAME can be seen as calling UnDecorateSymbolName on every symbol during the loading and serving those names to SymFromAddr and SymEnum you lose all information about decorated symbols which is generally not what you want and also why x64dbg doesn't use that option.\nIf I load x64dbg in x64dbg and load its symbols you see something like this:\n\nThe 'decorated' symbol <lambda_47baab08f63abb0acad11aadbc274841>::operator() can be found plaintext in the PDB and is a private symbol (therefore there is no mangled name stored since external components don't have to see is and thus it doesn't need an external mangled name).\nI do have quite a lot of cases that don't have an undecorated form, one example: ??_7?$TaskThread_@P6AXXZ$$$V@@6B@\nMy guess is that the dbghelp version just doesn't support this, try updating it to the one shipped with the latest WinDbg:\n```\nundname ??7?$TaskThread@P6AXXZ$$$V@@6B@\nMicrosoft (R) C++ Name Undecorator\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\nUndecoration of :- \"??7?$TaskThread@P6AXXZ$$$V@@6B@\"\nis :- \"const TaskThread_::vftable'\"\n```\n. I did some more experimentation, turns out thatundnameuses__unDNameEx, which is also used byUnDecorateSymbolNameand if I manually call__unDNameExI don't get the same results areundname`. Gotta love undocumented shit!\n. No, like I mentioned, x64dbg uses SymFromAddr and does not (yet parse\nexport tables from the file). You could call apienumexports and set labels\nfor all of them...\nIt js really strange that SYM_UNDNAME undecorates the symbols correctly and\nthe manual undecoration function doesn't...\nOn Wed, 7 Sep 2016 at 19:53, webro666 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI've also done some more experimenting.

There are probably countless alternatives out there that provide better support and have all the functionality you need. Also open source is a nice thing.

Think about contributing!\n. @0x900x90 implemented this:\n``` c++\nvoid CPUDisassembly::copySelectionToFileSlot()\n{\n    QString fileName = QFileDialog::getOpenFileName(this, tr(\"Open File\"), \"\", tr(\"Text Files (*.txt)\"));\nif(fileName != \"\")\n{\n    QFile file(fileName);\n\n    if(!file.open(QIODevice::WriteOnly | QIODevice::Text))\n    {\n        QMessageBox::critical(this, tr(\"Error\"), tr(\"Could not open file\"));\n        return;\n    }\n\n            QTextStream stream(&file);\n    QList<Instruction_t> instBuffer;\n    prepareDataRange(getSelectionStart(), getSelectionEnd(), &instBuffer);\n    QString clipboard = \"\";\n    const int addressLen = getColumnWidth(0) / getCharWidth() - 1;\n    const int bytesLen = getColumnWidth(1) / getCharWidth() - 1;\n    const int disassemblyLen = getColumnWidth(2) / getCharWidth() - 1;\n\n    for(int i = 0; i < instBuffer.size(); i++)\n    {\n      if(i)\n        clipboard += \"\\r\\n\";\n      dsint cur_addr = rvaToVa(instBuffer.at(i).rva);\n      QString address = getAddrText(cur_addr, 0);\n      QString bytes;\n      for(int j = 0; j < instBuffer.at(i).dump.size(); j++)\n      {\n        if(j)\n            bytes += \" \";\n        bytes += QString(\"%1\").arg((unsigned char)(instBuffer.at(i).dump.at(j)), 2, 16, QChar('0')).toUpper();\n      }\n      QString disassembly;\n      for(const auto & token : instBuffer.at(i).tokens.tokens)\n        disassembly += token.text;\n      QString fullComment;\n      QString comment;\n      if(GetCommentFormat(cur_addr, comment))\n        fullComment = \" \" + comment;\n      clipboard += address.leftJustified(addressLen, QChar(' '), true);\n      if(copyBytes)\n        clipboard += \" | \" + bytes.leftJustified(bytesLen, QChar(' '), true);\n      clipboard += \" | \" + disassembly.leftJustified(disassemblyLen, QChar(' '), true) + \" |\" + fullComment;\n      if(clipboard.size()>4194304)\n      {\n        stream << clipboard;\n                    stream.flush();\n                    clipboard = \"\";\n      }\n    }\n    file.close();\n}\n\n}\n```\nBut it didn't get merged because it doesn't actually work for me. Basically there should be a context menu option in the disassembly Copy -> Selection to file that does the same as Copy -> Selection but then to a file.\n. Ah, missed that one, thanks!\n. Great, thanks!\n. It's completely arbitrary, but you could use sizeof(int)*32 \ud83d\ude00\n. I really don't see the point. You only use query operations on this structure and sizeof(s.name) will work fine...\n. I reproduced this, not sure where the issue is coming from.\n. It should be fixed in titanengine now. See https://bitbucket.org/titanengineupdate/titanengine-update/commits/806f81e1871d9911acf47f0c43030f9aafa1e862\n. This is a feature from OllyDbg:\n\nLock stack - disables automatical stack scrolling to the actual contents of ESP each time the execution is paused. Alternatively, press button \"Address\" in the bar. When scrolling is disabled, button changes to \"Locked\".\n\nSo basically it should not automatically scroll to ESP/RSP when for example stepping over push eax\n. @shamanas we also have various chat rooms (http://x64dbg.com/#contact)\n.

Another thing you can do is allow users to synchronize the window with an expression (use DbgValFromString). You can use dis.sel(), dump.sel() and stack.sel() as expression to get the current selection.\n\nYet another solution would be to add a command structupdate <addr> and users can bind the command structupdate dump.sel() to a hotkey to update the struct to the current dump address with a press of a button.\n. @lynnux I also implemented a plugin to receive click events.

A solution could be to fail if short was included in the instruction and the output was not 2 bytes.\n\nThere is an API for xrefs but it only allows queries per address right now, it's called DbgXrefGet the operations on that should be O(n) where n is the amount of xrefs on the requested address.\n. Most of your requests have been implemented @faltur. I will not add a C++ parser to x64dbg but I will later expose the type system to plugins so they can do it. Additionally there will be a type database (user in the program database and a system database for commonly used types).\nProgress so far:\nhttps://gist.github.com/mrexodia/e949ab26d5986a5fc1fa4944ac68147a\n\n\n. @a1ext could you elaborate on what you mean?

The visualization (mainly for functions) is in very basic stages. There is no argument recognition analysis so there isn't much to display.\nFor plugins we need a good API to enumerate and manipulate the structures but I'm still designing this.\n.

I tested bpm addr, 0, r on both x32 and x64 and they work as expected (break when an address in the page of addr is read).

A fix for this is underway right now.\n. Hi, while this solves the original issue partially it does not resolve it completely. The problem is that the amount of disassembly does not fit in memory. It should basically be put in a buffer and flushed to the file every 10 mb or so.\n. Yeah sorry about not making that clear.... I think it's easiest to implement this with a QTextStream and then call flush() that way it also works as expected on QString.\n. Okay looks good, thanks!\n. I think we should remove the doxygen because it's barely used...\n. How much memory do you have?\n. I'm currently working on a better implementation. It will first disassemble every instruction in a buffer but I'm replacing it with a lambda so it shouldn't take so much memory.\n. Okay, looks good!\n. Thanks a lot!\n. Duplicate \n.

Thanks! Should be fixed now.\n. Use the type system if you want that. See the blog post for more information.\n. I didn't actually ever test UD2 breakpoints. The implementation looks correct but since your use case is very specific you should probably insert some printfs in TitanEngine and see what behavior is actually observed in your case. Alternatively provide a simple, easy to reproduce example and someone will probably take a look at it.\n. I have just tried using UD2 breakpoints in a regular environment but they appear to be working correctly in that case...\n. Yes, read the manual.\n. Last time I tried the note loaded fine.\n. The notes fully support non-English characters in UTF8 but I will try to reproduce the bug. Thanks for these reproduction steps! The debuggee notes are stored in the debug database.

Notice that dots are not the actual representation of the character, they are only shown in place of non-printable characters and these non-ascii characters are inserted so it is easier to see the difference between dots (round dot for null characters and square for other nonprintables).\nAlso I'm open to discussion about what is better behavior and if the majority of people thinks dots/spaces are better than non-ascii characters I'll make that the default and a setting for the behavior I think is better.\n. For copying I think you are right and the direct ASCII characters should be copied. For displaying I think it works fine as it is but if more people think it should be changed I will.

The most trivial case mov reg32, dword ptr ds:[mem] might work, but I'm not sure if overloaded variations exist where equal memory sizes are important or not the general case.

This is half-expected behavior. If x64dbg cannot read a memory page it will change the protection to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE to read the page anyway. Probably a good solution is to only allow this change in page protection if the debuggee is not running.\n\nWhat seems strange is that the pages somehow get merged (meaning that x64dbg incorrectly restores the page protection) I will that that out further....

While I do agree with your point about this behavior being weird (it has annoyed me a few times as well), the only actual reason for the 'Autocomments on CIP' option is to speed up disassembly.

Your theme appears custom, it looks like this on a clean-ish Windows 7 x64 install with Windows classic enabled:\n\n. Sorry but I cannot provide backwards compatibility with old service packs because Qt probably doesn't support them. You can compile x64dbg with older versions of Qt to try to get it to work..

Please comment if this is still an issue.. Already supported. Right click on the register and choose \"highlight\" or you mean that clicking on the register text will trigger that option?. First enable the setting (otherwise you have to press H every time):\n\n\n. Nice \ud83d\ude00. Snowman is a separate project maintained by someone else.. Well that does mean that the latest update did not improve the situation.... @affelwafro could you provide the/an executable that reproduces this behaviour?. With OllyDbg v1.10 if I search for strings in winchm.exe (md5 AB53BDC9AEF61C6B431F816A39C30B26) it will find 3841 strings. When searching with the reverted (pre-23 december) string search it will find 4407 results (although admittedly some of them are false positives). I see nowhere near 28000 results.\n\nIt's a really old machine I'm using here (2x 1.06 GHz, 2GB RAM). x64dbg was not usable with WinXP on my machine.\n\nAlso about that, please create a separate issue if it is still a problem. XP is officially not supported but I occasionally test it in a VM and it appears to work fine.. Oh Olly 2 also seems to include the strings that are included directly in\nthe code. The first string for example isn't a reference but rather the\nstring data itself.\nOn Sun, 1 Jan 2017 at 16:44, affelwafro notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nKinda curious,\nI searched with OllyDbg v2.01 (can't see where OllyDbg v1.10 shows the\nnumber of found strings)\n[image: olly]\nhttps://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8084390/21581786/672d055e-d040-11e6-83bb-f46dde436dc0.PNG\nOn the bottom left corner it shows me the number of found strings.

Alright, so the issue appears to be that x64dbg will try to match string pointers before the actual strings. With extended ASCII UTF-16 lots of text is in the pointer range so I will try to find a workaround for that....

Okay, I did some final verifications and x64dbg finds almost all strings OllyDbg does (and much more ones that OllyDbg doesn't find). The only ones it does not find are:\n\n0055C4D8\n005606A0\n00595CFA\n00595D3A\n005A3866\n005AB2A4\n005C492E\n005C6472\n005C66BE\n005C8006\n005C8356\n005D0CB2\nFor which the only interesting one is 005A3866\n\nThe reason for this is that x64dbg linearly disassembles the executable to find string references and this part of code is mixed with data which means that 005A3866 is not disassembled. As you can see, the actual reference to the string is correctly detected when viewing the code.\nThe other undetected strings are some kind of Delphi string format (size,data) that I don't plan to support.\nJust for completeness sake, here are the string references that x64dbg finds but Olly doesn't (most of which are definitely false

Sorry about that, the fixed I pushed was inadequate. It has now been updated and the stack position will be [rsp+20] when the disassembly is on the call instruction. You can use this in conjunction with the checkbox mode on 'Calls' to only update the arguments widgets when on calls.\n\n\n. Unlocked means the widget updates when the disassembly updates (eg on stepping)\nLocked means the widget will not update (contents will stay the same even if you step)\nCalls means the widget will only update if the disassembly is on a call instruction.. Also it shows as valid information as it can. If not on a call it will take the return address in account for stack space, but registers are volatile so obviously it cannot keep those valid.. Use the symbol tab to view imports/exports for modules and you can use the find intermodular calls option to find called functions with a name.. Indeed you can use the search for intermodular calls for that as I\nmentioned.\nOn Fri, 6 Jan 2017 at 10:59, qartveli34 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nFrom the symbol tab I can get symbols but can not find references\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1410#issuecomment-270870239, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmStCvLnkcONXQqk-_2SrpdrLEROXks5rPhCGgaJpZM4LckHv\n.\n.

There is code mixed with data (a switch table in this case):\n\n\nWhat you can do is go to 18000DC84 in the x64dbg disassembly, hit D and enter the size 1c it should then disassemble everything correctly.. There are no plans to provide x64dbg without a GUI.\nFor detach+exit you could write a plugin that calls both commands. Or you could try appending the debug exit command (which doesn't exist as far as I know) with a ; eg detach;exitdebugger. My guess is that there is no waiting before the command is processed in the GUI. Can be fixed with a BridgeResult instance.. The scripting engine is unrelated. Commands are used for more things than\nthat.\nOn Thu, 2 Feb 2017 at 11:42, Paliha notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nthen not quite clear why in the scripting engine need these instructions,\nif the engine is not priority\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1416#issuecomment-276923921, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmQSzAN2bgOUrMktbNEZyWkKjRMHaks5rYbMAgaJpZM4Lg_IV\n.\n. Yeah that was the plan for the information column, but it was never added. I added the string formatting to asm if you have more commands please tell me.. String variables do actually exist, but all their functions are undocumented because it was never finished. It would be possible to add syntax to print the content of string variables with string formatting though.... @Paliha good point actually that rip+x should be converted to something else.... I added string formatting to the findasm command. As for the other part, I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.. There is no support for manipulating any of those windows, nor can you get\nwindow handles for them. This is by design and if you want to change\nsomething you can check out the source code and suggest changes...\nOn Mon, 6 Mar 2017 at 17:57, Paliha notifications@github.com wrote:\n\"I added string formatting to the findasm command\"\nSuper....)))\n\"As for the other part, I have absolutely no idea what you are talking\nabout.\"\nIn the lower left corner of the widget \"HexDump\".

Okay I added some of the functionality you requested. \n\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/commit/8e601c72bfe37f9f29b29b5ee0877a420764a2a1\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/commit/aaf610de547eb426db29a9d046f16166e257d288\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/commit/62d3ac7d177581adc12cb6886b54d45303ebc3c7\n. 1. The ref.addr command can and will only work on the last reference view because of design limitations.\nI opened issue #1494 for that. I only added ref.addr so you could accomplish what you wanted, but notice that using findasm for lots of matches is much faster than searching once every time...\n\nI don't really understand what you mean with the \"bookmarks\" though. Do you just mean the entries in the reference view or are you referring to the bookmark system in x64dbg?. Searching for all instructions is faster because you only have to read+allocate the complete memory page once :). I just tested this, but the function for enumHeaps is very, very, very slow on x64 (it takes minutes) and there seems to be no way to refresh a single view manually.\nPerhaps http://securityxploded.com/enumheaps.php will help.. I checked some more and it looks like the function that CreateToolhelp32Snapshot uses to take a snapshot of the heap uses some kind of RPC. This function is RtlQueryProcessDebugInformation it uses NtCreateThreadEx in the debuggee to call RtlpQueryProcessDebugInformationRemote so heap enumeration will never complete if the debuggee is paused.. I did some more testing and the official API appears to be completely broken. The Address field after enumeration is totally broken. It points vaguely inside heap blocks, but inside strings and it doesn't seem to be coherent at all.... That remote thread won't execute if the debuggee is in a paused state,\nthat's the main problem...\nOn Mon, 13 Feb 2017 at 06:01, Matthijs Lavrijsen notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nThat blog entry has the right idea; unfortunately he has some incomplete\ntype info which (for me at least) caused the heap enumeration to crash, and\nsince the code uses hardcoded pointer offsets instead of types, I don't\nreally feel like figuring out the cause.\nThe Process Hacker headers should help if you're interested in using the\nmethod from the blog with proper type info:\nRTL_HEAP_ENTRY\nhttps://github.com/processhacker2/processhacker2/blob/b443aa77ffd5072689f31d1a9e9d1799f8aad523/phnt/include/ntrtl.h#L3224\nRTL_HEAP_TAG\nhttps://github.com/processhacker2/processhacker2/blob/b443aa77ffd5072689f31d1a9e9d1799f8aad523/phnt/include/ntrtl.h#L3254\nRTL_HEAP_INFORMATION\nhttps://github.com/processhacker2/processhacker2/blob/b443aa77ffd5072689f31d1a9e9d1799f8aad523/phnt/include/ntrtl.h#L3264\n(DEBUG_HEAP_INFORMATION in the blog)\nRTL_PROCESS_HEAPS\nhttps://github.com/processhacker2/processhacker2/blob/b443aa77ffd5072689f31d1a9e9d1799f8aad523/phnt/include/ntrtl.h#L3281\n(blog: HeapInfo)\nRTL_DEBUG_INFORMATION\nhttps://github.com/processhacker2/processhacker2/blob/b443aa77ffd5072689f31d1a9e9d1799f8aad523/phnt/include/ntrtl.h#L3905\n(blog: DEBUG_BUFFER)\nThe following ntdll functions are needed:\nNTSYSAPI\nPRTL_DEBUG_INFORMATION\nNTAPIRtlCreateQueryDebugBuffer(\n  In_opt ULONG MaximumCommit,\n  In BOOLEAN UseEventPair\n);\nNTSYSAPI\nNTSTATUS\nNTAPIRtlDestroyQueryDebugBuffer(\n  In PRTL_DEBUG_INFORMATION Buffer\n);\nNTSYSAPI\nNTSTATUS\nNTAPIRtlQueryProcessDebugInformation(\n  In HANDLE UniqueProcessId,\n  In ULONG Flags,\n  Inout PRTL_DEBUG_INFORMATION Buffer\n);\nI would say using ntdll functions for heap enumeration is preferable to\nCreateToolhelp32Snapshot and co by far. They may be undocumented but at\nleast they work. (and are orders of magnitude faster.)\nRe: RtlpQueryProcessDebugInformationRemote and pausing: I know ntdll\nexpressly creates this thread using NtCreateThreadEx with\nTHREAD_CREATE_FLAGS_HIDE_FROM_DEBUGGER set in order to prevent these\nkinds of issues. Whether that is enough to prevent all problems I don't\nknow. I recall at least one instance when I found out a program was\ndeadlocked because of an RtlQueryProcessDebugInformation call that was\nissued by another process.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1417#issuecomment-279295052, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmQWV1h9Wv5hdEkn2e83iWQv5Im-zks5rb-OWgaJpZM4Lh4Df\n.\n. I looked at the heap structure and enumerating the heap blocks (the bigger\nchunks that contain nodes) is really easy. ProcessHacker uses this to show\nif a memory region is a heap. It's just the PEB member called ProcessHeaps\nand the number of addresses there is also in the PEB. However I cannot find\nany kind of logical structure there, done you have a link to more\ninformation on those?\nOn Mon, 13 Feb 2017 at 13:00, Matthijs Lavrijsen notifications@github.com\nwrote:\nYes, that's what I thought as well. THREAD_CREATE_FLAGS_HIDE_FROM_DEBUGGER\nis very powerful, to the point where a thread with the flag set may even be\nignored when a process suspend is issued (though don't quote me on this),\nbut it's not enough to start execution in a process that's already\nsuspended, which would be the case here. I know because I wrote an\nimplementation of NtCreateThreadEx for the XP kernel once, ironically\nwith the purpose of banning this flag altogether as a ScyllaHide-type hook,\nand I ended up having to special-case the ntdll debug heap query thread to\nessentially give it godmode powers to prevent issues with suspended\nthreads. (and processes, which from the kernel's POV are nothing more than\nprocesses containing only suspended threads, though it may lie and say each\nthread's individual suspend count is 0).\nThere's no reason why RtlpQueryProcessDebugInformationRemote couldn't be\nimplemented out-of-process using ReadProcessMemory however. You'd simply\nhave to calculate the offsets, basically like the guy in the blog already\ndid minus the crash, and then issue a ReadProcessMemory for each\nindividual node and block. It would be slower, but not by that much;\nNtReadVirtualMemory is very fast (it doesn't really care if the virtual\naddress you're reading is in your own process or another one after it has\nperformed the access checks). This would allow doing the enumeration in the\ndebugger while the debuggee is suspended. It might be preferable to do it\nthis way regardless since it removes the dependency on the ntdll imports.\nYou'd still be reliant on the undocumented heap node structure layout, but\nthat struct hasn't been changed in a looong time. I'm not saying I have a\ncopy of the leaked NT4 source from 1995 because that would be illegal, but\nif I did, I might find the exact same struct as the one linked above in\nthere.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1417#issuecomment-279368150, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmSs--atrXKNUnpNq7tJhp_M5nrIdks5rcEXlgaJpZM4Lh4Df\n.\n.

I need far more specific reproduction steps and details. Please provide a simple executable reproducing the issue, your OS version, x64dbg version and exact reproduction steps on how to reproduce the issue.. You use the option to swallow (not pass to the application) an exception once, it works as expected.\n\nIf you want to automatically pass exceptions to the application, use Shift+F9 or add exceptions in the settings dialog. You cannot swallow consecutive exceptions with an option built-into x64dbg. The reason for this is that this will not happen in normal application flow. If you want to do this anyway, write a plugin that automatically swallows the exceptions you want.. You cannot.

It should show 'Inactive' however I do plan to add support for deleting breakpoints that don't exist yet but at the moment I'm quite busy so I cannot.. I have no intention of fixing this. The reason is that the next you are trying to decode is not valid UTF-8 so the alignment messes up.. A first chance exception can be resumed by pressing run again. Probably the game has an exception handler.... Your log only shows one exception.. Closed because no further comments/information were given.. Thanks!.

Thanks! I close both issues because they are caused by ring0 so we cannot do much about them.. It sounds like a good idea to me, however I don't think it will be used by 99% of the people and breaking the titanengine api is something I want to avoid because of GleeBug. The InitDebug functions only create a process and set some variables. It should be easy enough to extend this to support creating the process in a different way (environment variables could then also be changed).\n\nYou can change the command line post-launch in the debug menu by the way.\nAs for the GUI, you are right that it might be a problem. Currently a process is created with a command but if you start using pointers and such for context it is rather clumsy to do it that way and a new api would have to be created. Creating the GUI itself should be trivial. From what I saw its only a few edit boxes and nothing custom.\nNot sure if I answered all your concerns/questions feel free to ping me..

Probably it has to do with the strings spanning multiple lines or something.. Try reading http://help.x64dbg.com and http://faq.x64dbg.com . Isn't that pid from thread implemented as a queryinformationthread call?\nI'll check the code out later...\nOn Mon, 20 Feb 2017 at 16:36, Matthijs Lavrijsen notifications@github.com\nwrote:\nI noticed threads were always being shown as being in the \"executive\" wait\nstate, which I found a bit silly because WrExecutive is normally reserved\nfor the kernel. Taking a look at the source I found ThreadGetWaitReason was\nactually unimplemented :P So that would explain it.\nThis is an implementation that uses\nNtQuerySystemInformation(SystemProcessInformation), the only possible way\nto get the thread wait reason.\nIt is monstrously inefficient because it gets info on all running\nprocesses AND all of their threads (even though we only need one piece of\ninfo on one thread). It could be made more efficient by at least caching\nthe results for the whole process so that ThreadGetWaitReason would only\nhave to be called once per process instead of for every thread. But that\nwould require some restructuring of how the thread info is queried right\nnow. There's also no reason to loop over the threads of processes we\nalready know aren't the debuggee, but I found no easy way to get the PID\nfrom the THREADALLINFO that ThreadGetList makes. There is\nGetProcessIdOfThread, but it isn't available on XP. Anyway, even with all\nthis I tested the performance and it came in at under 1 ms per call, so\nit's actually not too bad. Since the thread list only gets refreshed once\nper second it should be acceptable.\n\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1470\nCommit Summary\n\nImplement ThreadGetWaitReason\n\nFile Changes\n\nM src/dbg/thread.cpp\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1470/files#diff-0 (47)\nM src/dbg/undocumented.h\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1470/files#diff-1 (57)\n\nPatch Links:\n\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1470.patch\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1470.diff\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1470, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmUk3GvALGQnkUW140cCYQp_xm4Vbks5rebL_gaJpZM4MGUo-\n.\n. Hm, I'm rather concerned for performance. If this takes 1ms per call it would mean 1ms overhead per thread on each call to DebugUpdateGui (eg on every step/breakpoint), which will definitely add up when spamming stepping with some threads in the debuggee. The information about the WaitReason is definitely not critical so perhaps its indeed better to cache it and call it periodically.... Yeah that idea with the map sounds good, makes it pretty much constant and\nsmall too.\nOn Tue, 21 Feb 2017 at 21:14, Matthijs Lavrijsen notifications@github.com\nwrote:\nI said under 1 ms, not 1 ms :)\nI just profiled it with a high accuracy timer and it came in at 0.159 ms\nper call (this is on a Core i7 6700K). I expected the constant memory\nallocations to be a contributing factor, but 99.46% (!) of the time was\nused by NtQuerySystemInformation itself. It's a really expensive syscall.\nOne thing that could be done is change the signature of\nThreadGetWaitReason to ThreadGetWaitReason(std::unordered_map&) and call it once in ThreadGetList with the thread list so\nit could do all the thread ID comparisons in one go. If it could also have\nthe PID from somewhere that would be nice, but I wouldn't do an\nNtQueryInformationThread for it if it can be helped. I wouldn't bet money\non another added syscall being faster than just doing a few hundred integer\ncomparisons.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1470#issuecomment-281466362, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCma_WB3IM2JObR9ejAuyQvFnFZzcpks5re0WcgaJpZM4MGUo-\n.\n. Thanks!. Hm I didn't notice your commit was so recent, sorry if you still wanted to push something.... Yes, you can import/export the database from the file menu. You will have to manually change the module.. I am aware of the possible problems of the memory map cache. It is however quite necessary because ReadProcessMemory is a fairly slow operation. It is a good idea to insert the stack for new threads directly in the map though to prevent possible cache misses. The same could be done for DLLs that are loaded/unloaded.. I have added some code that inserts a dummy page on thread creation for the stack. It should probably also be done for modules too but I'm still thinking on how to properly handle that.. The XMM registers are not supposed to be displayed in the info box, I will\nadjust that.\n\nOn Wed, 22 Feb 2017 at 06:54 Tennn notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n[image: default]\nhttps://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16742566/23199008/5c2e149c-f906-11e6-95e9-87eaea97cc8e.png\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1476, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmSX_XTDaZ68vdlmAqo7eldldhNRVks5re82fgaJpZM4MIPNc\n.\n. duplicate of #1448. I think it's definitely a nice change, however it breaks the style of every other symbolic name in x64dbg ntdll.NtQueryInformationProcess+4C for example. It also doesn't respect the symbol undecoration setting or the symbol filter. I would suggest changing the stackinfo.cpp:getSymAddrName function instead (with some of the code from _exports.cpp:getLabel to handle the setting and the filter). That way this is also supported in the normal stack...\n\nEDIT: It appears to be already supported, but only for user-defined or analyzed functions. I will push support for symbol displacement (apparently forgot when implementing it originally). As for the call stack, dbghelp is making up a lot of garbage (both for the callstack and for the symbol displacement) but there isn't much to be done about that I guess.... The performance wouldn't change, because SymFromAddr is already called in getSymAddrName. As for the undecoration, perhaps it's a good idea to change the default?. Hm, so how would we go about parsing the names like windbg does? I definitely think the extended C++ definitions are too much. Perhaps https://bitbucket.org/Nukem9/demangle could help?. Hm those flags are rather interesting. It should reduce the footprint of demangled C++ functions in the disassembly/call stack. For the symbol enumeration we can still fully demangle them for completeness.\nAs for __imp, there is an option that filters out certain names: https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/development/src/dbg/_exports.cpp#L117\nAnd do you know if the isx86module() function makes any sense to use in x64dbg? I don't quite get what that check is supposed to do.... I recently saw an example of x32dbg itself, where the Main thread would have SetCurrentDirectory in the callstack after x32dbg is fully loaded. This function is called in the plugin initialization but obviously it returned way before that.... I just tried on x64dbg, but there everything appears to be working fine at the moment... It makes sense that it would be much better if dbghelp actually uses those unwind tables... I'm currently looking into some stuff related to SymFromAddr because the documentation is super weird. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680686(v=vs.85).aspx gives all possible flags, but I get 0x400000 as a flag, which is not listed there...\nHowever I manually did some stuff and it should be as you intended. The only 'problem' is that SymAddrFromName will not work with the undecorated names, but they didn't really before either so that isn't too much of a problem (especially demanglePE32ExternCFunc on C symbols could be seen as a problem but I'm not sure if anything can/should be done about it).\nOh, my tests for that hacky C-style string manipulation function:\n```c++\n// Example program\ninclude \ninclude \ninclude \n// https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/2ae7de27f7d9276e7bada445ea7576bbc4c83ae6/lib/DebugInfo/Symbolize/Symbolize.cpp#L427\n// Undo these various manglings for Win32 extern \"C\" functions:\n// cdecl       - _foo\n// stdcall     - _foo@12\n// fastcall    - @foo@12\n// vectorcall  - foo@@12\n// These are all different linkage names for 'foo'.\nstatic char demanglePE32ExternCFunc(char SymbolName)\n{\n    // Only do this for Win32\nifdef _WIN64\nreturn SymbolName;\n\nendif //_WIN64\n// Remove any '_' or '@' prefix.\nchar Front = SymbolName[0];\nif(Front == '_' || Front == '@')\n    SymbolName++;\n\n// Remove any '@[0-9]+' suffix.\nif(Front != '?')\n{\n    auto AtPos = strrchr(SymbolName, '@');\n    if(AtPos)\n    {\n        auto p = AtPos + 1;\n        while(*p && isdigit(*p))\n            p++;\n\n        // All characters after '@' were digits\n        if(!*p)\n            *AtPos = '\\0';\n    }\n}\n\n// Remove any ending '@' for vectorcall.\nauto len = strlen(SymbolName);\nif(len && SymbolName[len - 1] == '@')\n    SymbolName[len - 1] = '\\0';\n\nreturn SymbolName;\n\n}\nvoid testUnmangle(const char* x)\n{\n    std::cout << \"1: \" << x << std::endl;\n    char t[256] = \"\";\n    strcpy_s(t, x);\n    std::cout << \"2: \" << demanglePE32ExternCFunc(t) << std::endl;\n}\nint main()\n{\n    testUnmangle(\"_foo\");\n    testUnmangle(\"_foo@12\");\n    testUnmangle(\"@foo@12\");\n    testUnmangle(\"foo@@12\");\n    testUnmangle(\"_LdrpDoDebuggerBreak@0\");\n    getchar();\n}\n```. related to #1310 .

I attempted to reproduce the issue today with x32dbg in debug mode, but I couldn't reproduce it this time.

The weirdest thing is that after resuming the threads everything continue to work, except for user input.. Yeah, this issue is really hard to grasp.

Then I tried release, reproduced it again, then I removed snowman from release and it didn't happen for pretty long, but then it happened again. Now I have to kind of keep trying to reproduce it and it happens occasionally.

In my code (https://github.com/ax330d/hrdev/commit/1183077563ed1d833b7cb16b445d7cda25afd653#diff-5d2b7017ff23d706dc7b480a368dc400L225) this was due to timer (I don\u2019t remember much details, but user moved mouse on label, tooltip appeared and then GUI was frozen because in PyQt version timer somehow misbehaved).\nDid not post this on Github to not to flood with potentially useless comments.\nCheers,\nArthur.

Code:\n```c++\ninclude \nstatic HHOOK hHook;\nstatic LRESULT CALLBACK HookProc(int code, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)\n{\n    if(code < 0)\n        return CallNextHookEx(hHook, code, wParam, lParam);\n    switch(code)\n    {\n    case HC_ACTION:\n        break;\n    case HC_SYSMODALOFF:\n        break;\n    case HC_SYSMODALON:\n        break;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\nint CALLBACK WinMain(\n    In HINSTANCE hInstance,\n    In HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,\n    In LPSTR     lpCmdLine,\n    In int       nCmdShow\n)\n{\n    wchar_t msg[128];\n    hHook = SetWindowsHookExW(WH_JOURNALRECORD, HookProc, GetModuleHandle(nullptr), 0);\n    wsprintfW(msg, L\"%p, 0x%X\", hHook, GetLastError());\n    MessageBoxW(0, msg, L\"JournalHook\", 0);\n    UnhookWindowsHookEx(hHook);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nThis requires some special privileges, you have to sign the executable and place it somewhere in C:\\Program Files\n\nIf HookProc is written improperly (and it is because I have no clue what I'm doing) it will generally fully lock up your system requiring you to Ctrl+Alt+Del and sign out to forcefully uninstall the hook. Even when the hook is installed correctly, it will not prevent AttachThreadInput from hanging.\nThanks again,\nDuncan. You cannot. The debugger will only load files that start with CreateProcess. You could write a plugin that uses MapViewOfFile and WriteProcessMemory to insert another binary in memory and analyze it, but x64dbg is not a tool for static analysis.\nIf you want to load binary data in memory, you can try https://github.com/mrexodia/PasteFile . Thanks a lot, that's really appreciated!. That looks like a very good improvement already! Is the algorithm implemented from the binary ninja prototype called 'topsort'?. There is no support for comparing strings in the conditions at the moment (string support in expression function is planned eventually though). In the meantime take a look at this plugin: https://github.com/pastaCLS/cndsteroids. Tracing is a conditional expression so no that doesn't support strings. I\ndon't know about the watchdog to be honest. The AddWatch command has\nsupport for strings (\nhttp://help.x64dbg.com/en/latest/commands/watch-control/AddWatch.html) but\nI don't think watch supports being equal to a certain value. See\nhttp://help.x64dbg.com/en/latest/commands/watch-control/SetWatchdog.html for\nthe supported modes.\nOn Wed, 8 Mar 2017 at 16:40 ViR Dash notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nShould I also assume that Watchdog and Tracing don't support strings?\nThanks for the reference! :)\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1485#issuecomment-285075774, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmfzJH_BVulINPPJgwQXRDpab1Uzyks5rjsv5gaJpZM4MW6qo\n.\n. @kempy007 You can check out https://github.com/pastaCLS/cndsteroids, this can help you set conditional breakpoints.

Yeah I saw the issue before. The reason this happens is that Run to user code will actually execute the command TraceIntoConditional !mod.party(cip). Since the wow64 code is not associated with a module it will kinda fail there. I guess there are two possible solutions:\n\n\nChange the condition to explicitly mention the ljmp and ignore that\nChange to TraceOverConditional\nAdd the wow64 pages as modules\n\nDownsides:\n\nWill work with standard code but would fail if the syscalls are hooked (ScyllaHide)\nWon't work in certain cases (eg abnormal control flow in system structure)\nUndocumented so might be annoying.. The reason was the WOW64 layer. If the instruction executed is ljmp 33,XXXXXXXX to switch to 64 bit the stepping will be messed up for some reason... I made the requirements for the workaround less strict and TraceIntoConditional now works fine (it will terminate after 50k steps on clicking OK). I switched to TraceOverConditional because it's better in pretty much every way.\n\nThanks a lot,\nDuncan. Cool, thanks!. Can't we just add a parameter to DbgScriptLoad that specified if the script should be executed as soon as it's loaded?. I made DbgScriptLoad synchronous but I'm not sure if running the script immediately is what you want....

Definitely very interesting! Why is the this pointer needed in those\ntemplate classes though?\nOn Wed, 15 Mar 2017 at 19:03, Matthijs Lavrijsen notifications@github.com\nwrote:\nThis PR makes x64dbg compile and run using Clang/C2 from VS2017. The main\ngoal of this is to add Clang's impressive diagnostics and warnings for\nadditional compile time error checking. (There are a lot of warnings\ncurrently, but I've kept the changes to the minimum required to get the\nproject to compile.)\nSome notes:\n\nThe launcher (x96dbg.exe) still requires MSVC to compile due to the\n   ATL headers being... well, special. I haven't managed to get the project to\n   compile without modifying the ATL headers, which is probably going a bit\n   too far.\nThe GUI DLL also requires MSVC, but this is more due to Qt's build\n   system's lack of support for Clang/C2. It could probably be made to work\n   with enough violence (given that Qt does support Clang/LLVM on Windows),\n   but I'm not really interested in this.\nClang/C2 from VS2015 doesn't work, due to some MS header\n   deficiencies that seem to have been fixed in VS2017.\nClang with LLVM also works (as in: compiles). I tested this with the\n   Clang 5.0 alpha from SVN. I haven't even tried running the result though as\n   the MSVC and LLVM ABIs are binary incompatible. Getting this to run would\n   require compiling all dependencies including Qt with Clang/LLVM.\n\nMost of the changes are non-functional, such as added type casts and uses\nof 'this' in virtual template methods. There are some exceptions though:\n\ngetLastExceptionInfo() now returns EXCEPTION_DEBUG_INFO by reference\n   rather than by value. This is to get the following to work:\n\ngetLastExceptionInfo().ExceptionRecord.ExceptionCode = 0;\nTo be honest I'm not sure how this even compiles in MSVC. It's possible\nthat this only 'works' currently by modifying a local copy, i.e.\neffectively a no-op.\n\nfor(auto & i = windowsList.cbegin(); i != windowsList.cend(); i++):\n   I've changed this to simply auto (i.e. non-reference). I don't feel\n   bad for this as casting an rvalue to a reference this way is a nonstandard\n   MS construct.\nThe LOADEXPORT macro has been changed to print (in case of error)\n   export names as ANSI strings (with uppercase %S specifier) rather than\n   unicode. This is because I couldn't manage to get the Clang preprocessor to\n   create an L\"\" type string no matter what. This shouldn't be a problem\n   though as the export names are all already required to be ANSI as they are\n   passed to GetProcAddress.\n\nThere are also two changes to headers which are technically nonfunctional,\nbut not especially pretty:\n\nmemory.h is now laid out in the order function declarations -> #include\n   \"addrinfo.h\" -> extern/SimplePage declarations. This is because\n   including addrinfo.h causes serializablemap.h to be included, which in\n   turn depends on some function declarations from memory.h. This could\n   be fixed by moving extern std::map\n   memoryPages to addrinfo.h and including that separately where this\n   variable is needed.\nbridgemain.h similarly has an #include moved downwards (bridgelist.h).\n   This is because bridgelist.h depends on the preceding function\n   declarations.\n\n\nYou can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498\nCommit Summary\n\nInitial support for compiling with Clang/C2 from VS2017 (Clang 3.8+)\n\nFile Changes\n\nM src/bridge/bridgemain.cpp\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498/files#diff-0 (4)\nM src/bridge/bridgemain.h\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498/files#diff-1 (6)\nM src/dbg/TraceRecord.cpp\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498/files#diff-2 (2)\nM src/dbg/commands/cmd-general-purpose.cpp\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498/files#diff-3 (1)\nM src/dbg/commands/cmd-thread-control.cpp\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498/files#diff-4 (2)\nM src/dbg/debugger.cpp\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498/files#diff-5 (16)\nM src/dbg/debugger.h\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498/files#diff-6 (2)\nM src/dbg/expressionparser.cpp\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498/files#diff-7 (2)\nM src/dbg/handles.cpp\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498/files#diff-8 (4)\nM src/dbg/jit.cpp\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498/files#diff-9 (2)\nM src/dbg/memory.h\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498/files#diff-10 (36)\nM src/dbg/serializablemap.h\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498/files#diff-11 (25)\nM src/dbg/taskthread.h\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498/files#diff-12 (65)\nM src/dbg/watch.cpp\n   https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498/files#diff-13 (2)\n\nPatch Links:\n\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498.patch\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498.diff\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1498, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmQkNbDkoILVh8UmEmLMfEOusy27Rks5rmCfUgaJpZM4MeUXw\n.\n. Alright, thanks a lot! I hope the clang warning can improve the overall quality (you did already catch a few errors with these changes).. \ud83c\udf40 . Haha I don't think it's really that much disk space but sure.... If you use \"Game-Win64-xxx.exe\":$2C3213 it should work.. See here for the reason. This is a limitation in Windows. You can work around this by using gflags (#816) to automatically attach x32dbg to the TeamSpeak client.. I added a workaround/detection mechanism to not come in an infinite loop. This will notify you of the uiAccess=\"true\" status.. No it will never work. You would have to change x64dbg to have uiAccess=true, re-sign it with a valid certificate and place it in C:\\Program Files (where it doesn't have write access which means you cannot use it). Just attach to the process.. Yes @Mattiwatti I meant that we cannot change it in x64dbg permanently because uiAccess=true and not being signed+admin location doesn't work nicely. uiAccess=true alone doesn't elevate.... Yeah I was also thinking about a separate executable, but another downside of that is that the settings won't be kept so that will lead to even more confusion. \ud83d\ude04 \n\n@ioncodes if you want to debug the executable on launch #816 will handle that case.... If you know how to do it with dbghelp I'll be glad to include it. If you don't want queries to the remote server you can try to remove the symbol servers.. Currently the code (https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/development/src/dbg/symbolinfo.cpp#L173) calls SymSetSearchPath with the server you specify in the settings dialog.\nSRV*C:\\x64dbg\\bin\\x32\\symbols*http://whateverserver but I guess you could replace the server with another local path to search first to prioritize that. (like C:\\mysymbols*http://fallbackserver)\nYou can find more information on symbol search paths here: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee416588(v=vs.85).aspx\nThis code has nothing related to downloading symbols it only uses a trick to be able to get symbols from servers only when requested (because you don't want to be downloading stuff during normal operation). As for a subprocess I think that's overkill. As far as I know downloading symbols is not done on the UI thread and it shouldn't block UI operations as of very recently.... Thanks!. Thanks!. Thanks!. There are no plans to upgrade as of now. Qt doesn't even provide packages for VS2017.. Yeah I don't really see the point in switching. It only gives me extra\nhassle because I have to convert the build server and old Qt plugins\nprobably won't work anymore...\nOn Sun, 19 Mar 2017 at 13:21, mirh notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nAnd it isn't at least before\nhttp://lists.qt-project.org/pipermail/releasing/2017-February/004471.html\n5.9 https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-57086#changehistory-903436.\nThough, at least Vs 2015 should be well supported.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1506#issuecomment-287612770, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmXNPtDmxOAMnLCSug0_xpJeWc8eiks5rnR2vgaJpZM4Mhs6P\n.\n. @torusrxxx do you have a problem with upgrading to Visual Studio 2015?. The issue is that Visual Studio 2013 is deprecated and you can no longer download it. Visual Studio 2019 will also release soon, but hopefully they allow downloading of the v141 toolset like in Visual Studio 2017. Basically the reason is that it becomes really difficult to contribute. I don't think there are any real blockers. I will also update Qt to the latest version and test to see if there are no new performance issues introduced. I just asked you in case you have to download vs 2015 :). You can use the command imageinfo to get information about individual modules (including ASLR/DEP/SafeSEH). I don't think scanning should be part of x64dbg itself, but you could definitely write a plugin to do this.\n\nAnother implementation: https://forum.tuts4you.com/topic/30003-ollydbg-2x-ollyseh/?_fromLogin=1. I don't think that issue is related @gmastergreatee EDIT: nevermind\n@nihuai the unicode support in that dump is extended ascii only. Rendering Chinese characters is very expensive but you can enable it by using a code page -> utf16 dump.. That is correct. The unicode support is severely limited because of the way everything is drawn. The problem is where to cut the unicode string. Tell me if you have any suggestions on how to improve this.. The issue with selection is because of the font. Unicode characters don't have a maximum width from what I know so you cannot align them easily.... @nihuai \n\nI've found that a character in UTF-16 can be selected properly ONLY when the selection is started from the column of odd number and ended next column in the hexadecimal region\n\nIndeed that is the idea. Proper alignment is the responsibility of the user.\nAs for the selection. I don't think Visual Studio supports selecting the characters. It would technically be possible to implement selection with a variable-length column but perhaps some tricks can be done to properly align unicode characters so the current selection system works (clicking one UTF-16 character should highlight two in the hex dump).\nWhile I don't disagree with the rest of your points I don't currently have any plans implementing it. If you really need certain things for unicode support I am willing to merge them in, otherwise you will have to write a plugin or something that exactly does what you need.\nSorry, misclicked the open/close a few times. I will keep the issue open in case somebody is interested in improving this behavior.. Needs more information to reproduce.. This doesn't look like a bug. You copy the disassembly with hex constants without prefix (see issue #614) and then paste it in an assembler that takes decimal input. If you want to assemble with hexadecimal as default you should use XEDParse instead..

I just tried this on xp 64 and the user experience is (still) awful. It almost never registers the new EIP correctly when stepping slowly.. All the 'bugs' you found are not bugs but expected behavior. For the imports I changed the behavior to make sense more, for the references it will only find references in the currently open disasm section. If you want to find references to an import address in a specific section, follow import in dump (this will go to the IAT address), follow the section in disasm and then use Ctrl+R from the dump.\nAlternatively, copy the IAT address (from symbols), right click in cpu -> search for -> all modules -> constant -> enter address -> it will find all references in all modules. (or use the command findref iataddr, cip, 0, 2). Currently you can do the same by right clicking on the import and selecting\nthe \"follow in dump\" option.

Good idea!. The problem lies with dbghelp.dll from Microsoft. I think you will experience the same with windbg. You can try to delete the PDB and everything should be faster or maybe try to strip down the PDB to a smaller size.... considered a duplicate of #747 . well I don't think indentation should be added here by default, perhaps a checkbox?. I only added this for Delphi @Chandlr. @Chandlr the problem is that if I add the themes directly to x64dbg that I have to maintain them for new features.... Ah, probably the refactor from @torusrxxx removed this functionality.... \ud83d\udc4d . All this functionality has already been implemented in the latest version.. Okay I missed that, thanks!.

This has been fixed somewhere.. 1. Yes this was commented out by accident I believe. I restored this functionality for Search for -> Current Region -> Find command\n2. This feature has now been added, it will only work on the 'current' reference view (the last one created) and the hotkeys are Ctrl+K (previous) and Ctrl+L (next).\n3. The find command will find all occurrences and show them in the reference view so you can use the new feature from 3 to do this now.. If you open a new issue it says: Before submitting an issue, make sure it has not already been reported.\n\n614 #1187. Then it's an issue with the plugin not with x64dbg. Anyway you should update ScyllaHide to the version from github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide perhaps that works.. No the link is not broken. Just try clicking it and you'll see it takes you to the correct page.. Interesting, maybe the github Markdown parser was updated and had a regression. It's cleaner to not uses spaces inside urls though so I'll merge it.. Thanks!. Ehm, Github totally fucked up the merge and I have no idea where it went.... @mrfearless so could you reproduce the issue?. I just tried on Windows 8.1 x64 (Parallels VM), @fenderluvr you experience the issue on XP 64 only?. Just tried this and it happens with any executable you debug on Windows XP 64. It does not hang immediately however, you have to step first. Can you confirm this also happens when doing init x32dbg.exe and then stepping @fenderluvr ?. I believe I have found and fixed the issue (learning for exams is really\nboring apparently), I will test some more and push a fix.

No, making the lock exclusive was fixing another problem (which would actually never manifest on XP since there is no distinction between shared and exclusive locks there). The thing that actually fixed it was releasing the lock before the wait function was called :).

Okay @fenderluvr I have looked into the issue and everything should be working fine in the next snapshot (20 minutes or so).. Unhandled exception filter is a well known anti debug trick. You can send the pictures to x64dbg@googlegroups.com. If you press ok, will scylla work as expected?. Okay so the reason is that Scylla doesn't expect newer versions of Windows when checking for the OS version. This is exposed just now because of #1490 which turns on support for newer versions of Windows. It can be fixed in Scylla quite easily which I'm doing right now but I leave this information here just in case.. @Hypophrenia until the next release comes out you can use https://mega.nz/#!HlJznDJZ!Lzn6C2GhL-IU52Vtlvjuz7wMB8ogQCSzvkwJPIM8nHQ.

Ah okay, I'm not sure if we should add that before doing the long double editor.. Try to implement it @flarejune, you can get started in CPUDump.cpp:370 and add a special case for floating point there...\n\nAn alternative option is to extend the WordEditDialog to have an extra item for short float, float and double but this is probably not a great idea since it will only cause confusion..

Alright, so I reproduced the issue. Setting the command line from the Debug -> Change command line will correctly work up to 32kb. It will correctly save the commandline in the database too, but it will not correctly restore it. To work around it, use the Debug -> Change command line option after you started the debuggee and everything should work fine.. Try with this application, it's a small test: https://transfer.sh/4GBBA/CommandLineTest.exe\n\nCode:\n```c++\ninclude \ninclude \nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n    printf(\"argc: %d, argv:\\n\", argc);\n    for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++)\n        printf(\"  %d:\\\"%s\\\"\\n\", strlen(argv[i]), argv[i]);\n    getchar();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nI will remove this memset because it's useless and should be replaced with *commandLine = '\\0';.

Yeah that is exactly the reason I don't want to work on this. It requires a massive overhaul of the code or some kind of hacked, custom sprintf for basically something I wouldn't even use.\n\nA better approach could be to simply highlight the redundant parts of the address in a different color which makes sure you don't lose any information while making things clearer at the same time and it is intuitive to integrate in the codebase.. I agree with the Actions -> part (it is on my long list of things to do), but I definitely do not agree with putting the variations as separate strings, because this doesn't work in many languages where the order of words is different than English or where the conjugation depends on the context.\nRegardless as the main developer/maintainer of this project I know which things require a massive overhaul and which things can be seen as 'enhancement' and require minimal effort to pull off. If you are interested in helping you should take a look at http://easy.x64dbg.com to get started with small things so you can get to know the codebase better and not judge from a perspective of someone who doesn't know anything about the code.\n.

No response was given, comment if you have consistent reproduction steps from a clean environment with the latest version @forkoz .. I'm currently quite busy but I will try to check it today.. I did review the code and it looks good, however I have to do more extensive testing to see how this works performance-wise. There is also the reservation of memory usage, so perhaps we should disable this per default until more testing has been done?. A feature like this won't be supported by x64dbg directly, however it is really easy to do by replacing TitanEngine.\n\nI wrote this proof of concept in 3 hours (most of the time spent to fix a bug in GleeBug), you can try it out and feel free to extend it. I can give you commit access or you can send pull requests: https://github.com/mrexodia/StaticEngine\nRight now it only supports attaching to an existing process, but it's definitely possible (and quite easy with the GleeBug PE module) to statically load (map) a file and browse strings etc. It would also be possible to do something like xdbg and have SEH debugging without changing (much) of x64dbg.. I think asmjit and keystone can also support this, but I didn't implement the callback. What happens if you assemble call mybuffer?. Keystone was deactivated so the issue is no longer relevant I believe.... Looking good, thanks!. Thanks!.

The launcher has now been improved:\n\n. Please provide more information including all the relevant code and exactly what you are assembling.. Scyllahide has this feature.. It depends, you could check the code and see how big this feature is to add. If it's small and self-contained it shouldn't be a problem to add.. No. Those settings are not safe. You can ignore them separately by pressing the button to add the last exception.. It appears to be related to type analysis. The database says:\njson\n{\n\"encodemaps\": [\n  {\n   \"module\": \"empty.exe\",\n   \"address\": \"0x1000\",\n   \"manual\": false,\n   \"data\": \"00{2A4}1113131100{D58}\"\n  }\n ]\n}\nRemoving this (or doing right click -> analysis -> remove analysis type analysis from module) will fix the issue. You can also select the range where this goes wrong and press 'U' to remove the problem on a small scale so you can continue with your project.\nDid you manually add byte/dword/etc type analysis here?. Okay, should be fixed now. Thanks for your concise report!. > In either case, I don't see why type analysis would mess up the disassembler. Or rather, why it should.\nYou don't have to see it, but it was related and I fixed it. The type analysis allows you to display bytes in the disassembler in a different way (db E8 for example) and there was a logical mistake which made certain types of code behave incorrectly.\n\nAlso, another issue I'm having\n\nYou're right, It is another issue.\nHowever both commands work as expected just parsing the structs won't show them in the struct tab. You have to use the visit struct option and enter the struct type name (the one you give to AddStruct). It will then lay the struct over the memory and allow you to view members. See http://blog.x64dbg.com (somewhere in the weekly digests) for more information.. duplicate of #1540 . It's already supported.. This is most likely related to script parsing. I think ; might be used to indicate a comment as well.... Thanks!. You have to call the function xanal first. However another way would be to DbgCmdExecDirect(\"reffind 402000\") and then use the ref.get(index) and ref.count() expression functions with DbgValFromString.\nEDIT: nevermind, data references are not added in the xref list.. @extremecoders-re you have a memory leak (you have to call BridgeFree). This code is easier:\npython\nx64dbg.DbgCmdExecDirect(\"reffind 402000\");\nxrefs = [x64dbg.DbgValFromString(\"ref.addr(%s)\" % hex(x) for x in range(0, x64dbg.DbgValFromString(\"ref.count()\"))]. It indeed does, except on calls and rep instructions. Please provide more details as lined out in the issue template.. Good catch!. Because I want to.. It was indeed decided about 4 years ago, before x64dbg went public. There is no real good reasoning for it (the order isn't even alphabetical) and you are welcome to send a pull request to change the order \ud83d\udc4d . @ThunderCls you might wanna take a look at this. From what I can tell the titles of the windows in the taskbar are somehow not shown in the attach dialog.... It indeed appears to have been fixed!\n. you can, just drag the address column.. there is no way to display a label instead of the address.. note that the label is also displayed in the infobox under the disassembly.. Nice, Thanks!. This is the default behavior for first chance exceptions. You can do it by\neither running again so you get a second chance exception, use the \"skip\nnext instruction\" option, use the \"con\" command after setting eip or\nfinally change the default exception handling behavior in settings, which\nis built for manual breakpoint instructions you want to use as breakpoints.\nOn Thu, 8 Jun 2017 at 23:49, Bartosz W\u00f3jcik notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n\nPut int3 (CC) in your code\nLoad it into x64dbg\nF9\nException is catched at int3 (int3 stepping disabled in options)\nMove current EIP right after the int3 (\"CTRL + * star\" keyboard\n   shortcut)\nPress F8 or F7 to run instruction right next to int3\nBUG -> x64dbg returns to the int3 instruction, EIP is restored back\n   to int3 even if it was manually changed to the instruction next to it\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1614, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmYU2dfvfH03Ly7dMJ28U_Auv2VS7ks5sCGxvgaJpZM4N0qln\n.\n. The logic is that olly swallows the exception and thus behaves incorrectly\nwith regards to the exception handlers it calls and then exposing anti\ndebug tricks. I cannot control what windows does with eip after I set the\ncontext. If you want this behavior it can be turned on in settings. You can\nalso register an exception breakpoint on 80000003 and call the \"con\"\ncommand if you want it for a specific application.\n\nAs for the \"d\" command, just write a plugin that registers your command.

There is nothing I can do here. I found various references to fstenv being used as anti-debug/anti-vm trick but I couldn't find any in-depth information as to why this internal FPU context gets corrupted.\n\nBest you can do is write a plugin that is triggered on every step (CB_PAUSEDEBUG) and then warns the user and prompts for the action to take, however this might only work in very limited cases where the last FPU instruction is obvious.\nFrom what I tried, modifying the context while on/after the last FPU instruction corrupts the context.... It's related to the architecture of your operating system. Windows 32 bit works fine. Looks good! . Thanks again @ntfshard I fixed some more undefined behavior based on your cppcheck!. Snowman is a separate project that has been integrated to x64dbg, it has no support for XMM (although you could go about adding it to here: https://github.com/yegord/snowman).\nDo you have a minidump for that crash? Generally x64dbg only saves the database on exit or if you use the dbsave command manually. Probably you could write a small plugin to automatically comment the xmm stuff based on the opcode and the operands.\nBasically what you want is taint analysis, which is not implemented in x64dbg, you can use the highlighting mode (press H) and click an xmm register to help you view things, but there is no automated tool that does this.. @ShiningKnightLight can you send the text of the function when copied with Ctrl+C?

Currently on holiday so I'll merge this when I'm back (in a few days).... @Georgeto could you explain what problem this fixes exactly?. Okay, thanks for the explanation!. Probably a bug in Windows again.. I think it was issue #1418 or #1814. Actually #1481 you should try windbg or ollydbg to confirm of course . Right now it's not feasible to integrate this as a feature, however it is very possible to add a new debug engine by replacing Titanengine (see GleeBug for a practical example on how this works). With some work you can combine this replacement with a plugin to add windbg integration.... It's out of scope for x64dbg to have multiple architectures, but integration of unicorn as an emulator isn't a bad idea.. It's very doable indeed but there is no effort gonna come from me to implement this directly. If you need some kind of plugin sdk functionality feel free to ask though.. This is a duplicate of #580 . This error means that x64dbg couldn't successfully call CreateProcess. Usually this means the executable won't run on Windows. Does it run when executing from explorer?. I think x64dbg could improve here by checking the subsystem and printing a better error when it isn't GUI/Console.. Hm, very interesting @Mattiwatti (ping @xarkes). I guess this would be akin to #1463 ?. Thanks a lot, I merged the TitanEngine PR (should soon be in x64dbg). How would we go about supporting this transparently from x64dbg? (Eg not break DLL debugging).. I don't think this feature is in scope for x64dbg itself.... Open a separate issue.. The command bar already has a history, just use the arrows.. @freesoft0000 open separate issues for separate questions/bugs.\n\nOtherwise it is unmaintainable for me.. Thanks!. Thanks bro!. You can use ESC but you have to wait until the search is finished.\nPerformance of the filter cannot actually be improved, perhaps it's possible to delay searching until the user has finished typing though.\nSimilarly to breakpoints I have no intention of supporting multiple selection.\nYou can use RegEx to do more advanced search.. Could you give a screenshot for each of these problems and please provide ways to reproduce the last issue. There is no high DPI support in x64dbg because I don't have a high DPI monitor.. I added this to the GUI main function (but I cannot test it because I don't have a high DPI display). Those articles are useless to be because I don't have a high dpi monitor...

I have no intention of supporting multiple selections. There is no use for it.. I think it's better to implement this as an option 'Export Settings' that simply clears the settings related to user data. Perhaps even with a separate program.. I tested myself, I searched all strings for SaveSettings, but a breakpoint there and open/close the menu. The mouse disappeared but after I pressed F9 the game resumed normally...\nNo ScyllaHide or anything. I did notice a second chance crash on exit though, but that's likely because the unhandled exception filters are not executed.... Scyllahide should bypass this if you attach to the process on time.

I won't change the way patterns are searched, you can however write your own conversion tools (plugin).. You can find some more related discussion here: https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1281. As for some more explanation, the feature is searching for bytes. Obviously a different feature could be added to search for words/dwords but changing the existing feature isn't a good idea in my opinion.. There is also this pluin: https://github.com/codecat/ClawSearch. VS2015 is not supported. See here\nNotice: It is important to install the exact versions of the tools mentioned hereafter (special exception for Visual Studio 2013, for which you can also use the Professional or Enterprise editions). Don't come complaining if you didn't install the correct versions of the tools.. Solution (probably): delete all Qt DLLs from x64dbg bin directory.. Ehm?. Well, it should be possible to make such a thing...\n\nAs for IDA integration, you can use labeless to sync. Adding TitanEngine to IDA would be pointless.. I started development over here.. I don't think downloading all symbols is relevant for a context menu in the CPU view. The option should only be to download symbols for the current module (if there is any)....

You could check with Procmon if it tries to load Qt from a different location. No, probably you didn't properly overwrite the Qt DLLs. Try deleting the platform directory and Qt5*.dll files..

The sourceforge snapshots are daily (will probably be uploaded soon), github releases are always builds of the latest commit. Open in the x64dbgpy repository please.. python.x64dbg.com. It's not a bug. Delphi likes putting zero bytes between functions. Use \"b\" to set the correct type in disassembly.. which snapshot?. Which x64dbg version (snapshot) was the crash on? Also, do you have a different interface language?. Also the BreakModule plugin is built into x64dbg.... I disagree. This kind of functionality would be very brittle and easily cause all kinds of issues. There are various solutions, a plugin perhaps or adding another input device that is used for stepping?. There is no support and there probably won't be any either. If you want to debug a linux executable you can use a linux debugger (r2, gdb).. Good chance the contents of edi,edx are not the same in ollydbg and x64dbg at that crash?\nUse a clean ollydbg as well (eg no anti-anti-debug plugins) to test..

There is no reason to analyze all the functions so that's why it's disabled. You can read extensive reasons on the radare2 blog http://radare.today/posts/analysis-by-default/\n\nThe question is, why do you want analysis? And also if there is a bug with analysis, what is the bug exactly?. I think this is the expected behavior. If the process terminates, the debugee will close in x64dbg.

Impressive that nobody has found this so far! So thanks :1st_place_medal: \nAnyway what @mrfearless is saying is true, calling DbgGetProcessId doesn't make any sense before CBINITDEBUG is called, because there is no debuggee (it will also return 0 now).. I fixed the conflicts and it should compile again now.... The dialog doesn't go to a relative offset. It goes to the file offset\n\nFor me to reproduce your issue I need the binary you are debugging. If you want to go to a relative offset in the current module just use :$1234 will go to mod.base(dis.sel())+0x1234. Yeah, the file offset -> rva conversion is tricky and is being rewritten. You are doing it in ntdll though and not the hello world executable.\nAlso what are you trying to do with file offset if you don't know what it means?. >  For example in this case I thought I only wanted to do a simple sum of to hex values (base value + offset).\nYou should definitely re-read my first comment.\n\nBtw, tried to compile the x64dbg, but man this is tricky ;P (the fact that I'm using VS2017 doesn't help). Have you considered at least moving GUI part to VS solution, so you don't have to use 2 IDEs to compile it? There is a Qt plugin for all recent VS versions.\n\nVS2017 is not supported, just follow the steps here. You can use the Qt plugin yourself because it just opens the .pro file in Visual Studio as far as I know.... Yeah file offset definitely doesn't do what you want.

The ctrl+g action depends on the current view (highlighted with a small black border around it).. For some reason I never responded to this, but as for a shortcut to mod.base(dump.sel()) + x you can use :$x (relevant help section).. You know you can use the symbols view right?. @torusrxxx perhaps we can cache only exported functions and just include those in the dialog like olly?. I think this feature can be merged in after the conflicts are resolved and a setting has been added to disable it.... Very nice!. Hm, I just checked and it bugs out pretty hard if you use the down arrow to navigate the suggestions:\n. I fixed the problem I mentioned above.. Thanks!. Wine is not supported, but I created a branch that should make it work fine https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/commit/16d89ee6983fdaae014660830c6b20af787bdcac. Did you try the \u201cwine\u201d branch that removes the concurrency dependency? (Oh and one of the newer wine versions is supposed to support this without modifications).. Latest snapshot should be here in a few minutes: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mrexodia/x64dbg/build/1.0.338/artifacts. It looks good, however I think this will also allow multi-selection in the script view for example there is the mIsMultiSelctionAllowed variable to check this (with a nice typo lol). Thanks!. Should be easy to adjust @justanotheranonymoususer, for me personally I have no preference, but things like sublime text use ctrl+home/end to go to the beginning/end of the file.. Alright, just open a pull request with what you think makes sense \ud83d\udc4d . You can use the Github web editor and wait for appveyor to build your snapshot zip for the pull request as well \ud83d\ude09. Alright, no problem. Can I help with installing visual studio/qt or whatever @justanotheranonymoususer ?. @Atvaark was this intended? https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=x64dbg&open=AV8bl8YtVLHgQ8g1xlkd&resolved=false&severities=BLOCKER%2CCRITICAL%2CMAJOR%2CMINOR&sinceLeakPeriod=true&types=BUG\n. If removing them is the fix I'll do it real quick tomorrow or whatever.... Thanks!. Nice!. will be quite hard because it's hardcoded in a bunch of places.... the PR is outdated and the refactor will probably be done in a new pr anyway \ud83d\ude0a. ping @athre0z . Thanks!. https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/c5c3358c529c37988991d998bbbe9b2147fa6af4/src/dbg/commands/cmd-searching.cpp#L548. I think this could be a fun idea, although I don't really see the use case apart from \"ida does it\". Uncheck this option:\n. Display scaling: 125%. I cannot reproduce the issue anymore, even though I did it like 5 times in a row just now...\nEDIT: reproduced again and there was this same thread in x64dbgpy, called from plugunload this time the RPC error is STATUS_OBJECT_TYPE_MISMATCH. Potentially related to #1793. Hm this might very well be fixed with the latest TitanEngine that went around closing all kinds of handles it shouldn't.... Hm, crap did you get that exception on exit or randomly while debugging?. It could be a double CloseHandle again but I have really no clue where this time. Probably I should do another CloseHandle hook and trace that or get some intel tool to do it for me.... For me I did x32dbg debugs x32dbg debugs x32dbg, then I used the second layer to force restart x32dbg and it crashed with EXCEPTION_INVALID_HANDLE in dbghelp -> SafeSymCleanup -> debugLoopFunction\nPerhaps dbghelp closes the file handle automagically if you give it in SymLoadModule?. . Ehm @Mattiwatti I think you used the wrong TitanEngine version because this is exactly the bug I described (and fixed) here. The TitanEngine that x64dbg uses is in the x64dbg branch \ud83d\ude04 . Nevermiind, I did fix the issue and updated the deps repository with this fix, but I didn't actually commit and push to TitanEngine \ud83d\ude15 . I think this will be automatically fixed with #1820 since dbghelp is fully removed there. However it should also be fixed in TitanEngine I think.... Hm, I don't think the varset has to be there actually... I only introduced that because the initial idea of x64dbg was to make a TitanEngine prototyping commandline app and it was used in a few commands back then, perhaps it can just be set to 0 or even removed entirely..\nIt is correct that no handle has to be passed to plugins before the cbCreateProcess so closing fdProcessInfo->hProcess and replacing it with the one from cbCreateProcess seems like a good approach to me.. Perhaps try to add another parameter and see if it works?\nOn Sat, 14 Oct 2017 at 15:46, nihuai notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThe function call fails.\nThe prompt requires a third parameter.\nBut python scripts have only two parameters.\n[image: image]\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22935890/31576156-fe8e0a6a-b127-11e7-8367-99e317ad53ea.png\n[image: image]\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22935890/31576184-79b580ec-b128-11e7-8de9-cd200c52ff27.png\n[image: image]\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22935890/31576227-02e60be8-b129-11e7-9791-11a00e5148ba.png\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1760, or mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmeb9dLqRBdfDJJvrELwLpumdU4Euks5ssLtKgaJpZM4P5YqP\n.\n. try _x64dbg.Find(data, len(data), pattern)\n\nI agree that without documentation it is hard but there was no time to write documentation for this branch.

Currently the border of the dump is flashed \ud83d\ude04 flashing the background is a good idea though!. Thanks! I will try to integrate it soon.. Oh yeah you\u2019re right I forgot to remove the flag \ud83d\ude05. Okay fixed that part, perhaps we should open a new issue for displaying the address label/symbol if one exists?.

I think if you have 'Symbol' to be the same as now, 'Symbol (undecorated)' can be 'DLL + symbol' perhaps? Right now the sorting on that is useless anyway...\n\nYour idea could also work by adding the DLL to the 'Type' column but that doesn't feel very clean either. We can also change the behavior to be the same as olly and if people want to find all imports from a specific DLL they can just type 'kernel32' in the search to filter all the other things out.. Hm, the demangler could be great. Thanks!. No updates. The source of the symbol view was refactored so it should be quite possible to do something like this.... I don't see the difference between OllyDbg and x64dbg? For Olly it goes to the next window (whatever that means), in x64dbg it goes to the next tab (exactly like chrome).\nAnother idea is to maybe steal Ctrl+Shift+P from sublime text (something like this: https://github.com/TheCrazyT/x64dbg-plugin-quickaccess) and allow people to search the view they want by name.. Perhaps @Atvaark has an opinion on this since he/she implemented Ctrl+Tab in the first place \ud83d\ude04 . Will be closed when #1807 is merged. I'm not sure about this change and I have to do some testing before I can merge it.... Thanks!. Hm, one of my messages got lost in Github's email (@support):\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t do any shortcuts with Alt... I think if we change the behaviour it should replace Ctrl+Tab. Also that idea for the dump sounds useful! I was thinking of changing the double click so a menu pops up with various options where to follow it.... Thanks!

Hm I have to remove that file some day, the translator has support for files from multiple sources...\n\nBut I will update it. Thanks!. Sorry for the wasted time, but x64dbg is not run by a company so adding it to version info makes no sense.

Thanks!. @torusrxxx next time please 'rebase and merge' to keep the history clean.... You can also press Alt+Insert.... Hm, for that you can also bind a hotkey to copy -> file offset \ud83d\ude04 . I don't think the pr has to be closed. I was just giving alternatives to this, if the text is selected when the dialog opens I don't have anything against this.... Thanks!. http://translate.x64dbg.com/project/x64dbg/hu#. Currently the translation to Hungarian is at 0% so there is no interface translation yet. If you click on x64dbg.ts you can login with Github and translate the English strings to Hungarian. Every few days these will be packaged in the x64dbg_hu.qm files and added to the snapshots. You can find an introduction to Crowdin here.. I cannot get that because I don't speak Hungarian. The translations are done by the community, I only provide the English version.. Your branch was not up to date with master so there was a merge conflict which caused AppVeyor to fail. I fixed the conflict and it should start building now.... Thanks!. I think this should be easy to fix by using something like std::signbit to detect the sign in the case of zero.. We use QString::number() \ud83d\ude04 \n\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/development/src/gui/Src/Gui/EditFloatRegister.cpp#L360. We can use QString::sprintf but if the printing fails the parsing also probably fails.. \ud83d\udc4d . What other debuggers did you try that have a graph view?\nWithout the executable I cannot really know if this is a bug on my side or just you having 2gb of memory and running out when trying to graph something.... Thanks,\nWhich function should I graph?. A yes, I already ran upx -d run.exe and graphed the function at 0x401000 and it is lagging really hard but didn't crash (thanks I'll look into that as well). Graphing at the entry point indeed runs out of memory!. No, exactly the same happened on my computer, it used far too much memory for the size of the function!. Required fix left to do to close this issue: somehow limit the graph analysis to the current section or automatically detect when a lot of 0000000000000000 bytes are being rendered and fold them.. fixes #747. Little document with an overview of the progress: https://hackmd.io/IYEwxiAcBGCmAsBaAnCAjAM0fEBmXikssATIfLicMMcQKwBsQA==. The current approach doesn\u2019t scale because it uses too much memory and it\nuses dbghelp which freezes on new symbol versions. The current approach is\nalso very memory hungry (about 3x the size of the symbol file just on load\nand more if you view the symbols).\nOn Fri, 11 May 2018 at 17:18, justanotheranonymoususer \nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWhat's the high level goal?

Commands are comma separated. But just go in debug -> change command line. We discussed this briefly in the chat and I think a good solution is to have a nasty popup the first (few?) times you try to enter a command that asks you if you know how they work. Do you think this would have prevented your issue @zhgong007 ?. @yo05 at least read the topic.... Moved to https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbgpy/issues/22. Thanks!. Maybe interesting: https://github.com/Kelvinhack/kHypervisor. That\u2019s correct. There is no support for strings in the x64dbg command line.... Yes. You can find what the mov command does and does not support here.. For this issue to be useful, provide a proof of concept with reproduction steps. This is like screaming on Twitter that you had dinner.. Yeah, which executable at which address?. Yes I know what patching is, thank you :)\n\nInformation I need:\n\nLink to a download of the executable you patched\nAddress of the jnz you patched (00401234)\n\nI want to see the error myself otherwise I cannot solve it.. ?. I suspect this is a bug in vmware, not x64dbg. Similarly to wine I don\u2019t plan to support simulated environments.... I think I talked about this with @ThunderCls and implemented a prototype, but it caused too much hassle to be nice. Did you try detaching the graph tab?. Plugins should handle this during plugstop, there is no way for me to tell that there is a return address to an unloaded module in a thread somewhere.... What kind of address list are you talking about? You can edit the breakpoint condition to something like eip != 0x12345678 to ignore the breakpoint on a specific address.. Tracing will stop as soon as a breakpoint is reached.. duplicate of https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/931\nedit: it is pretty tricky to implement given the current implementation of the expression evaluator and it needs some special casing for short circuit operations to work... You can find the current implementation here.. this can be done as a plugin, not a core feature of x64dbg. Confirmed this bug and working on a fix now.. A fix is pending ~on my local branch~, for now you can try replacing your x64 TitanEngine.dll with this one.. Oh and thanks for your great reproduction steps!. \ud83d\udc4d . Does the debugger crash?

You can record a trace (albeit a little clunky at times) and see the executed instructions. You can also use trace record to highlight the graph/disassembly.. It is not an issue, just the c++ app throwing exceptions and handling them (for example because it cannot connect to a website or any other error state).

The best way to improve the report is find a reliable way to make it happen, preferably on video because it might just happen on your system.\nAs a temporary workaround you can use this plugin to automatically save your patches: https://github.com/x64dbg/AutoExportPatches. > I may unplug this plugin to see anything changes.\nDefinitely try to reproduce this without plugins, it could be a plugin that does something weird to cause this...\n\nYes, I found this plug-in allready just didn't figure out jet how it works, thanks.\n\nBasically it saves your patches when you stop debugging on call dbsave, the patches will automatically be restored when you restart the process too..

You will not see anything in your audit log, but your credentials were used in a Github API call to subscribe to this repo.. @FickoDeLux I can confirm this happening. At the moment the sizes of the columns are not reset when you change the fonts, but this could be implemented by adding logic in the various updateFonts() functions.. What do you want to save?. Your breakpoints, comments, labels, etc will be saved automatically when you close the debuggee. If you want to save your modifications to the program (patches) you can do as stated above.. Definitely agree with the latter change, not sure about the first one yet because it will clutter the menus.... Oh sounds good to me then :) I also think a listbox is more appropriate indeed, the dialog blocks other operation anyway so might as well make it bigger.... I think #1820 will solve this issue.... ```\ndefine WEAK_ACQUIRE() Lock __lock(true); if(!__lock.success) return 0;\n```\n\nit would be nice if I could have this mutex, but if not, that's fine too.\n\nThat is indeed the idea, if the critical section cannot be acquired the function will fail (eg the symbol for that address will not be displayed). This mostly happens during module loading, but if reverting this indeed fixes this issue I think it's good to do before #1820 is merged (since the whole of dbghelp will be removed with that).. @lynnux could you test with this fix?. @Zareli the best you can do is \ud83d\ude4f Github fixes whatever this is..

It\u2019s difficult to say without the standard Windows color scheme, but the left one looks alright to me or is that not what you mean?. I'm really sorry about that... The issue has been fixed now and I made a new plugin available (DbGit) that you can use to automatically add the databases to a git repo created in the db folder.

Could you explain more? What is the difference between ascii mode and normal mode?. > \\<torusrxxx> it supports relocation and patches. The only thing to do is that relocation underline will also underline the space after the pointer.. @torusrxxx are the bytes supposed to be not added to the HTML clipboard?. Looks vert good!\n\n. Yes, the s format string function tries to heuristically determine whether the bytes at the address are part of a string and what encoding it is (utf16 vs ansi). You can use a plugin like EasyDump to have a command for logging strings for which you know the encoding. You can also use the _plugin_registerformatfunction to write your own type of formatting, feel free to ask if you have questions about how to do that.. Could you give examples of the 30% it doesn't list?\nThe s format specifier uses the same heuristic as the disassembly view, you can find the code here. The point is to not list every one or two character byte sequence that by chance can also be interpreted as an ASCII string. In short: you are using the wrong tool for the job.. > But if I'm logging a value as a string, it's because I know it's a string, not because I have an idea that it may sometimes be a string.\nThat's why I said you are using the wrong tool for the job :) The s format string might not do what you expect but the behavior is what it is...\n\nA lot that were 20-30 characters of pure ASCII characters\n\nSo if you find those again, post them here so the heuristics can be improved. In the meantime just write a simple plugin to format the data exactly the way you need it or wait for someone to do it for you :smile: . Thanks, I reproduced the errors with many strings under 11 characters long, could you post the exact string of 38 characters long that this failed on (and your memory map).\nIn the meantime you can use the plugin I whipped together https://github.com/mrexodia/LogString\nLog syntax is \"{ascii@address}\". That bug with the long string is likely fix now. You can use the LogString plugin (also updated) to treat anything as ASCII and log it verbatim.... There are two different 'views' of the memory map in x64dbg:\n\nShow memory pages as they were allocated (original allocation base + size), the only exception is for module sections which are also shown as they appear in the header (this is the default view)\nShow memory pages as they are in memory (probably equivalent to Cheat Engine).\n\nYou can switch views by using the 'Switch View' menu option in the memory map. Note however that this has the side effect of changing how much data you can scroll through when you go to an address in the disassembly or dump. It also changes what 'current region' means in the various search functions.. There is a settings file and databases per debuggee.. Databases are saved and loaded automatically, you don\u2019t have to do anything.. Your first issue is a duplicate of #1874 \nThe second thing you mention is a duplicate of #498\nWhen you created this issue you should have seen:\n\nBefore submitting an issue, make sure it has not already been reported.. As a solution in the meantime you can construct the command that launches your application with the desired command line and working directory and add it as a favourite:\n\nInitDebug \"C:\\program.exe\", \"-argument -argument\", \"C:\\workingdir\". So what would be stored in a project file? You mention command line, that is stored (minus that issue). Currently the databases store your labels comments breakpoints, what else do you want? The databases (similar to ida idb) are stored in the \u201cdb\u201d folder. You can import/export the database from the file menu if you want to share it with your peers (or just copy the relevant file from the db folder).\nAs for program settings, I assume you mean the x64dbg options (x64dbg.ini)? This you can also share with your peers (in fact the whole x64dbg directory is portable, nothing is hidden).\nThe plugin system is more than rich enough to implement a more advanced system that suits your needs better.... Who is Arpit Jain and why do they get special thanks?. Could you try if the same happens on the dbghelp refactor branch? https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mrexodia/x64dbg/build/1.0.433/artifacts. I did reproduce the hang and it indeed happens inside dbghelp.dll. As a workaround you could try replacing dbghelp.dll with the latest version from WinDbg.\nThe error you saw is interesting, for me it just says it didn't load any symbols for the PDB (probably my globally registered DIA instance isn't updated yet). I think this is also the same issue as this one https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/4631/dia-sdk-still-doesnt-support-debugfastlink.html. This is indeed a strange behavior.

However, here is an overview of the options:\nx32dbg.exe <filename>\nx32dbg.exe -p <pid>\nx32dbg.exe <filename> <command line>\nx32dbg.exe <filename> <command line> <working directory>\nx32dbg.exe -a <pid> -e <event>\nx32dbg.exe -p <pid> -e <event>\nx32dbg.exe -p <pid> -tid <tid>\nThe important part is that you have to escape your command line arguments if you want to use x32dbg directly, for example:\nx32dbg.exe \"C:\\Program Files\\Test\\Test.exe\" \"arg1 \"\"arg2 with spaces\"\"\" \"C:\\Program Files\\Test\"\nWill effectively run:\ncd \"C:\\Program Files\\Test\"\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Test\\Test.exe\" arg1 \"arg2 with spaces\"\nx96dbg\nThe intention for x96dbg is to handle the escaping for you. To achieve the same as the previous example you can do:\ncd \"C:\\Program Files\\Test\"\nC:\\x64dbg\\x96dbg.exe \"C:\\Program Files\\Test\\Test.exe\" arg1 \"arg2 with spaces\"\nTest\nI wrote my own test program:\n```\ninclude \ninclude \nint wmain(int argc, wchar_t* argv[])\n{\n    wprintf(L\"GetCommandLineW():\\n%s\\n\", GetCommandLineW());\n    wchar_t dir[MAX_PATH];\n    GetCurrentDirectoryW(MAX_PATH, dir);\n    wprintf(L\"GetCurrentDirectoryW():\\n%s\\n\", dir);\n    wprintf(L\"argc: %d\\n\", argc);\n    for(int i = 0; i < argc; i++)\n        wprintf(L\"argv[%d]:\\n%s\\n\", i, argv[i]);\n    system(\"pause\");\n}\n```\nI tested again to make sure and everything is working as expected. Your command line usage of x32dbg.exe is just wrong. The first happens to work, but the one with the arguments does nothing. Just use x96dbg.exe instead..

We use the \u201cx64dbg\u201d branch.. As for your second question, you can use the switch condition to only step in when the instruction doesn\u2019t go to another module or memory region. See the tracing documentation for more information http://help.x64dbg.com/en/latest/introduction/ConditionalTracing.html. Does that actually work? Perhaps it would be a good idea to implement detection of button holding to improve the speed.. Yes, x64dbg will use CreateProcess to start the process before it is able to debug it. With the default configuration it should stop at the system entry breakpoint before any code in the executable is executed, but after you press run, pretty much anything can happen.... This is not a support forum for reverse engineering. Try elsewhere.. duplicate. You can use the log string \u201c{i:cip}\u201d to log a single instruction if that\u2019s what you mean.\n\nAs for the Google group, I saw the email but I\u2019m really busy moving these days :) in general Github is a better place to post though.... Thanks! Sorry for the long time without word, I've been very busy with moving and work recently :)\nHope you are doing okay!. Ehm?. It is definitely possible to do, however x64dbg wasn't really designed to do source debugging so it might be easier to just use a normal text editor.. I manually merged this pull request. I removed the commit for customizing the header background because it was impossible to look good. The border color also has to be defined, it should be possible to do based on the text color and background color but I'm not sure how (#1953). It doesn\u2019t look like a bug in x64dbg to me. If you find a hello world-style executable to reproduce this on without anti debug it would be a different story.. Adding the exception to the list only automatically presses the run button for you, so it would still throw the last chance exception. duplicate. The short answer is that you cannot. It\u2019s not implemented yet.. I don\u2019t need this functionality so I won\u2019t add it.

Generally use the version from GitHub that has a signed binary, it shouldn\u2019t contain possible malicious code.. Settings -> GUI -> Show ASCII/Unicode in address dump mode. @blaquee is correct.

Windbg is adding the image base of the module, I think this would be a better solution. But generally this case is very narrow and almost never happens..

Good to know it works :)\n\nThe other issue you mention is #1942. I have no use case for this so I don\u2019t have much interest in fixing that at the moment. This issue appears to be solved.. I tested this on Windows 8.1 and it was working, but on Windows 10 I had some trouble, I will investigate it further.... Hi, I found a minimal executable that should reproduce the issue I was having:\n```\ninclude \nint main()\n{\n    auto pid = GetCurrentProcessId();\n    auto hp = OpenProcess(PROCESS_TERMINATE, FALSE, pid);\n    TerminateProcess(hp, 0);\n}\n```\nGetProcessId requires PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION, but duplicating with the same access won't grant it in this case.. I think a clean fix would be to re-duplicate the handle with query privileges once we see it\u2019s a process or thread handle. This should be undetectedable and pretty clean (DuplicateHandle has a parameter for access). Maybe today I will try something if I have some time.... What version are you using? Check if the process cookie option is enabled and disable it.. Was your issue resolved or did you close it by accident?. I don\u2019t know. If you think that is fine behavior it is okay for me :)\nprobably people expect it to match olly, so if that\u2019s the case I\u2019m all for\nit.\nI held off merging because I thought you wanted to update the merge request\nto address the issue with the swapping.

They are not directly part of the x64dbg repository because it uses Visual Studio 2010 to compile and I don't want to have that as a requirement. The idea for a very long time now has been to replace TitanEngine with GleeBug, but there are some blocking issues there that nobody has resolved so far.\n\nIt will require some additional effort to preserve backwards-compatibility in DbgGetRegDumpEx, but apart from that I don't think there will be many issues (just that you have to copy pasta the new headers and make sure everything stays compatible with Windows XP/Visual Studio 2010).\nOne thing that might be possible is to replace TitanEngine with a minimal version of TitanEngine that allows x64dbg to work. This would likely increase performance and it would be no problem to include that code directly in x64dbg.. Agreed! The branch was not 100% polished, but I wanted to get the functionality out the door so people can use it and report any issues they find.. Should be fixed.. Thanks!. ?. duplicate of #1942 . Adding issues multiple times is only going to make it less likely someone will look at it.. Currently there is no such thing. There are also no releases, so it\u2019s a difficult thing to do in a meaningful way.\nReading the commits is not too bad. There should be links to the closed issues there.... One idea was to do something like https://x64dbg.com/blog/beamer to highlight important new changes as they happen, but I didn't have time to do much with that so far.... You can run your code in a separate thread, and use the following structure:\n```c++\nDWORD WINAPI MyThread(PVOID data)\n{\n//do long work\n}\nvoid cbMenuSomething() //plugin callback for menu/command\n{\n    auto hThread = CreateThread(..., MyThread, data, ...);\n    bool finished = false;\n    while(!finished)\n    {\n        auto res = WaitForSingleObject(hThread, 100);\n        switch(res) {\n        case WAIT_OBJECT_0: finished = true; break;\n        case WAIT_TIMEOUT: GuiProcessEvents(); break;\n        default: //weird state, probably best to bail\n        finished = true; break;\n    }\n}\n```. Yes this behavior was changed. There will be only one callback on a step.. Why?\nOn Thu, 12 Jul 2018 at 16:56, maskelihileci notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nCould you add this feature to the settings as changeable?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1984#issuecomment-404541215, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmWIA9Q2mvIORQM-Ukof2NSdSDLU8ks5uF2OIgaJpZM4VM8Oc\n.\n. You should report when x64dbg crashes or freezes so those issues can be addressed. If you want to save the database you can use the dbsave command. You can add this as a favorite command if you want access to this quickly.. This is likely because of the new export table parsing.. Yeah I forgot to add the exports as a source for the autocomplete is all. Will try to find some time tomorrow:). Yes, I have a prepared cache for exports sorted by name, just have to query it when doing the autocomplete... currently my focus is stability, a new source view and swapping TitanEngine with GleeBug. There is slow progress, but this time things are actually working properly.\n\n@torusrxxx if I don\u2019t catch you on the chat, I found a buffer overflow when tracing \u201cnop;fxsave [esp]\u201d. I assume this is because fxsave has a memory operand bigger than the trace buffer? Another issue I found is when you have the bytes \u201c90FFFF\u201d (instruction->invalid instruction) and it will crash because IsNop requires a valid disassembly, I\u2019m working on both, but if you have an easy fix I\u2019m interested:). I already have stored all symbols+exports both sorted by rva and by name. Currently only the symbols are being used, the exports need a similar function to query autocomplete for a prefix.\nBecause the limit is 20 we can just sort the list in the gui before displaying it to not care about these problems.\nIn the long term my goal is to completely refactor the system and have proper autocompletion with addr,name pairs and a dialog like ollydbg2.. You can close the tabs you don\u2019t need.. An entry point of zero is actually valid (there are some examples in the corkami repository). I think a proper fix would be to move setting the entry breakpoint to the system breakpoint callback.. There is a misunderstanding here \ud83d\ude00\nCurrently the entry breakpoint is set on the cbCreateProcess debug event callback, which fucks the loader because the MZ signature is changed (the loader isn\u2019t executing yet at this point)\nI proposed to move setting of the entry breakpoint to the cbSystemBreakpoint debug even callback :). Oh and when an executable has a zero entry point it will start executing on the MZ signature as if it was code. Some special crafted pe file can then put a jmp right after that and transfer to the real entry point without making the PE file invalid. For DLLs it\u2019s not possible to have a zero entry point.. I just checked and it appears that you cannot set a breakpoint on the PE header even when doing it from the system breakpoint callback. Probably the only possibility is to fall back to hardware breakpoints if an entry point of zero is detected.\nSample (not malware): entry0_.zip\n. Yeah I observed some very strange behavior in x32dbg too. I disabled the entry breakpoint to not make everything crash, then from the system breakpoint I put a hardware breakpoint on execute on the entry point. It stopped, but when I started stepping the execution resumed and I saw the message box.\nPerhaps a good idea is to throw a big fat message box in the user's face and not care about this too much?. Sorry but these kind of changes don\u2019t really have a purpose and only cause the blame to be shifted to you without making any actual changes to the files so I\u2019m closing the pull requests with just whitespace changes.. I dealt with this issue on my local branch. My current format is \u201cOrdinal#1234\u201d for the label. Any objections?. Local branch. This code is not yet in any release.. Yes, just search a bit in the other issues.. Yes, the star means you have to relaunch the app. Feel free to send a pull request to add the label you want.. If you have an instruction you can always click on it and look in the info box under the disassembly to see the register value.. Looks nice! I think it would be nice to keep some kind of original behavior with Ctrl+arrows though \nMaybe\nCtrl + up: scroll up one line without changing selection\nCtrl + down: scroll down one line without changing selection\nCtrl + left: first visible address - 1 without changing selection\nCtrl + right: first visible address + 1 without changing selection\nWhat do you think?. @justanotheranonymoususer my idea would be to allow using ctrl + left / right to move the view a single byte left/right. would this address your issue?. I tested and it appears to work very nicely @torusrxxx . Feel free to merge :). There is x64dbgida which supports labels and comments, but no function analysis so far.... There is no lack of function analysis. Whenever I need a function to be analyzed I simply press A at the beginning of the function.. This request is out of scope for x64dbg. You can write a plugin to export/import what you need.. Thanks, I merged both pull requests!. Nice catch, thanks!. Shouldn\u2019t matter right? They are binary compatible so both versions will work.. okay I will leave the issue open and take a look, thanks :). confirmed. Thanks!. Thanks!. This should be fixed now. I don't think this is a commonly-used feature. Feel free to implement it as a plugin and share on plugins.x64dbg.com. Yes, I think it is a good idea to refactor this.. I tested on my local machine and confirmed that stepping after a hardware breakpoint will resume execution. I cannot reproduce any issues with hardware breakpoints not triggering though.. To solve this issue: remove yara from x64dbg.. There is no way for x64dbg to know that your function is __declspec(noreturn), so it cannot assume an int3 is the end of a function.. It was closed because x64dbg doesn\u2019t know what noreturn is and thus cannot assume that int3 is the end of the function.\nOften there are int3 instructions in real code (asserts, anti debug tricks) so we cannot say \u201cit\u2019s an int3, so the flow ends here\u201d. This is why the behavior right now is as-expected.\nIt would be possible to add a data type \u201cterminal instruction\u201d and allow users/analysis to mark the int3. We can turn the issue into that and reopen it if you want.\nIf you have another problem, please open a new issue on github so it\u2019s easier to track for someone who would like to fix it :). This might also have been fixed, I didn't try yet. Feel free to try with the latest release if I don't get to it in time.. Just tried and I couldn't reproduce the problem anymore.. Yes, around 10 times I\u2019d guess \ud83d\ude00 probably it should be in the FAQ by now.\nThe answer is: there is no solution to the scrolling problem because of the\nway x86 works.\nOn Mon, 3 Sep 2018 at 21:12, twifty notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHas this already been reported or something?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/2018#issuecomment-418179447, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmZRw3PPY3JTqD3udnnewpYiyutMvks5uXX8jgaJpZM4WX5cS\n.\n. when loading the database x64dbg will try to restore any breakpoints you previously set. perhaps this is causing some weird behavior for you?.

Closed as duplicate of #1513 this is a much requested feature, but I don't use it so nothing is happening. To support memory breakpoints we have to switch to GleeBug.. I would definitely say this is out of scope. A plugin could definitely implement this though.. Remove all skins and plugins and try again.. Thanks for your report..

Looks good, but what was the motivation for Ctrl+L? I never saw it before.... Thanks!. Thanks!. Looks good, thanks!. Thanks, it appears to be working good in the references and symbols view!. Hey,\nI do like your idea of allocating a string as a value, but I don't think this is a very safe idea. Because now passing something like matchstrA([esp+4], 123) will crash x64dbg. In the strmatch plugin I did I have a separate command to allocate strings in a pool. Perhaps a similar thing could be done here?\nAnother solution would be to properly support strings in expressions, but that will require a rewrite that won't be pretty.... Perhaps you could add special support for the dummy snowman? (Maybe that the dll is loaded dynamically) And special treatment for qt so it\u2019s a complete solution . Right now it gives the impression that deps for debug will be ready, but not really.... Thanks!. Hmm, I vaguely remember finding and fixing this in some other context,\ntotally forgot about it.

There was some issue with the build process, it should be building correctly now!. I think it\u2019s good to have a way to filter instructions directly in the trace view. This could help us implement for example viewing all instructions in the current function. Or some kind of taint analysis and only show the relevant instructions.\n\nThe downside of the reference view is that it\u2019s not very dynamic and that if we extend the trace view to show more information about the currently selected instruction we won\u2019t have these features.\nMy only possible concern is how it deals with memory usage and performance with big traces, but I think it will be fine.... Yes but it is easy to test and we need to start somewhere in my opinion.\nOn Wed, 31 Oct 2018 at 16:15, Torusrxxx notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nFiltering instructions just by mnemonic, as it is in the pull request, is\nnot very helpful.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/2057#issuecomment-434725058, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACWCmQXlmb5myXrc0ZhabaIe-JGHu3Mvks5uqb6dgaJpZM4YB1pr\n.\n.

WriteProcessMemory will call VirtualProtect for you, you don't need to have write access.. In general x64dbg cannot smell another program is doing something (it doesn't have a kernel driver). There some heuristics (like time passing, or certain debug events) that cause the memory map to re-populate. This is a costly operation, so it cannot be done every millisecond...\n\nAlso you have to take into account that x64dbg generally displays pages with their allocation size (except the pe sections, which have special treatment). You can right click -> switch view to see a more 'realistic' (but generally harder to read) memory map.. You can find the source code here: https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/development/src/dbg/memory.cpp#L27\nProtection is the 'current' protection (depending on your memory map view this can be wrong, see source code for details). Initial is the protection that was passed to VirtualAlloc.. Hey, long time no see ^^\nCurrently the command doesn\u2019t take a variable because there isn\u2019t really a way to know how to convert the variable to a byte pattern (variables don\u2019t have a size).... I don\u2019t want to support xedparse anymore, but you can open an issue on the repo. github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide. Thanks!. You can google for \u201cuiAccess true\u201d and find for example http://techsupt.winbatch.com/webcgi/webbatch.exe?techsupt/nftechsupt.web+WinBatch/Vista+UiAccess~TRUE~and~Protected~Locations.txt\nThis tells you that in order to gain the uiAccess=true privilege you have to sign the application (x64dbg.exe) with a valid digital signature and place it in a secure location. Don\u2019t forget to set this flag in the manifest of x64dbg too.\nIf you follow these steps you will be able to debug other applications that require this privilege.\nThere are also some ideas out there to attach to such a process with the debug privilege enabled, but I honestly doubt that\u2019d work.. Yes, this is expected and documented behavior. You can use quotes to prevent this.. Feel free to create a style sheet for this.. Thanks for your fixes! I will try to incorporate them in the new version.... I ported your fixes to the latest TitanEngine, but unfortunately using a timeout of 1ms will slow down tracing to 500 steps per second...

In my opinion it is not needed to deal with this. The only useful thing I can think of is to run x64dbg as admin from a folder that only admins can write to and then create the debuggee process without elevation. This would also prevent the child from getting a handle to the parent process iirc.\n\nA separate db folder might be useful in some minor cases, but it is a headache for portable use..

I was thinking about the cleanup too, but probably it's good enough to just clear the exports/imports/whatever. Also another issue I see how is that I call vector.reserve with exportDir->NumberOfFunctions, so that could take up a good chunk of memory and cause a DoS too, ooops.. That malware is actually triggering an out of bounds read by setting the number of exports to be very large. Is there some guarantee on data having to be inside the export directory for those RVAs in there?\nAdding checks certainly won\u2019t hurt (as long as that massive casting isn\u2019t triggering some UB), but like you said, probably a good idea to do a generic try/except just in case.. Sorry for the delay, been really busy recently.... Personally I would not use this feature. Generally you're not using the command line to do things like stepping, since there are hotkeys. However like you said, it would be easy to implement so a pull request with setting wouldn't be rejected. On the other hand, the code related to autocomplete/history of the command bar is pretty hacky already so the implementation shouldn't make that even worse \ud83d\ude04 . The script commands are not meant to behave like asm commands, just look like them (for example they also don't update the flags in the native context either for obvious reasons). If you want to write a 32 bit value to rcx you probably should just write rcx = 0x12345 \ud83d\ude42\nThere is some documentation, but this behavior has been like this since the very first release (before I knew what x64 does to 32 bit registers honestly) so I'm reluctant to change it. Feel free to update the documentation to clarify this: https://github.com/x64dbg/docs/blob/master/introduction/Input.md\nIf you'd like to add your own script handler you can do so with GuiRegisterScriptLanguage. You could quite easily use this to have a repl-like interface that emulates asm instructions in the native context..

The WINVER is defined as 0x0501 because x64dbg should be compiled with Windows XP headers.\n. This timer might be too long. It might be worth to change this to something similar as the TaskThread you implemented. The semantics I would prefer are like 2000ms when idle and an immediate wake up as soon as an update is required.\n. This is the include that gives the warnings. If you remove it everything works as desired (without modifying _global.h).\n. Just a quick thing I wanted to change. We should give the TaskThread an identifier and then store/load their timeout in the settings.ini this way you can easily customize how heavily you care about GUI updates. Setting the default to 100 milliseconds gave me instant GUI updates when spamming buttons, but nice skips (as desired) while holding the button.\n\nThere is also a bug where the first GUI update would not be registered correctly (it didn't change the CIP).

This is incorrect, it will log two newlines.\n. But doesn't matter I will change it back after merging.\n. Actually you don't have to use fromUtf8 since that's the default option in Qt5 and in Qt4 we use QTextCodec::setCodecForCStrings()\n. You forgot to change this back\n. I removed this optimization I don't think it will hurt performance though. Nor will it improve the performance.\n. If you have time, we are in need of code reviews or the whole code \ud83d\ude04 \n. This will take at least 1ms on every selection change. I think it's better to have DbgSelChanged(int hWindow, duint addr) and if plugins need the size (almost never) they can query it manually...\n. This isn't actually a translatable thing. module:EntryPoint is a pseudo label you can use to get the entry point.\n. This is also incorrect. The if statement should fall through so other types can be queried at the same time and also allow plugins to use CB_ADDRINFO.\n. Oh yeah you're right I misread the context, sorry.\n. I think this behavior is better, but it should then replace Follow in Memory Map with Follow DWORD in Memory Map and also check if that DWORD is a valid memory address before adding it to the menu.\n. I changed this previously it's more natural to have a space there.\n. This return was added with good reason because it will drain performance if it's not there. The cache will be updated eventually and then it will correctly retrieve a callstack.. I think it might be a better idea to copy/paste the getSymbolicName function or make it static because instantiating a DisassemblerGraphView might lead to unpredictable issues.. The default tab changed with this. Apart from that it looks great!. All looks good, except that clipMsg is not translated, however this is inconsistent with the other views where no status bar message is snown.... For me the copy notification has no use but you could add it in Bridge::CopyToClipboard I guess.... This will not translate it \ud83d\ude04 The correct way is tr(\"The data has been copied to clipboard.\\n\").toUtf8().constData(). There is a function called ModBaseFromName for this purpose or is this used for another reason? I would suggest using the module base directly instead though because multiple modules with the same name might be loaded.... Shouldn't this be called after checking for fs and such? Because this could read from unknown memory right?. This action should be created with makeShortcutAction in CPUDump.cpp not over here.. Don't use this. use std::sort with a lambda.. This shouldn't be uppercase.. These shouldn't be uppercase either.. The cast to QObject* is not needed and also dangerous.. this can be simplified to wVA = duint(text.toULongLong(&isaddr, 16)); for both architectures. Is this required?. Same here?. I think this should be replaced with #pragma comment(lib, \"ntdll_x86.lib\"). Could you give more details about this bug?. If this to not load modules that don't have a name?. Could you explain the bug?. This has been added into x64dbg:\n\n```c++\nint ThreadSuspendAll()\n{\n    // SuspendThread does not modify any internal variables\n    SHARED_ACQUIRE(LockThreads);\nint count = 0;\nfor(auto & entry : threadList)\n{\n    if(SuspendThread(entry.second.Handle) != -1)\n        count++;\n    else\n        dprintf(QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP(\"DBG\", \"Failed to suspend thread 0x%X...\\n\"), entry.second.ThreadId);\n}\n\nreturn count;\n\n}\n``. Could you explain this hardcoded 428 process id?. I think it should be possible to write a plugin that hooksTitanOpenProcessand calls this instead.... The connect can just be removed since it's no longer relevant once this is merged.. I remember there was a reason why thisUpdateCheckerwas stored on the heap. I think it's a good idea to replace this with anAboutDialog*to make sure no weird bugs are introduced.. No, idea... Could just be Visual Studio trolling. thecommandLineis declared aschar commandLine[MAX_SETTING_SIZE];so this is correct.. You can useArchValue(tr(\"EIP\"), tr(\"RIP\"))here. nvm it's more consistent now I'll just change it after the merge. this will fall though, I did the lambda because it's clearer.... This should be implemented as a signal instead of letting theReferenceViewknow about theQTabWidgetparent.... Minor nitpick here :). If you use DWORD here just likeLASTERRORit will not display theffffffff....` . The main issue with this is that any plugins using this structure will break so I'd rather not do that...\nA solution for this is to let the plugin pass the buffer size so we can make sure no buffers are being overwritten but it's a bit too late for that now \ud83d\ude22 . Same here, plugins will break with this change if you change this structure.... I think DbgGetRegDumpEx would be the better solution. Internally we can change _dbg_getregdump to take an additional size_t bufferSize like you suggested to keep the change as small as possible.... The diff is extremely unclear, this is the only line you added right?. Good point!. The high part of NTSTATUS codes are usually set to something like 0xFFFFFFFFC0000005 so this check would say the code is invalid while it is actually valid.... Why are these changes made?. This is not really a property you can depend on and it would only work on the English version.... The QObject parameter for this is not needed because you can capture this (see later comment).. This would then become:\nc++\nwColDesc.columnSwitch = [this]()\n{\n    this->setView(ViewAddressUnicode);\n};. Make sure to run format.bat before you commit (will go automatically if you run install.bat). I think it's better to add two new views ViewAddressAscii and ViewAddressUnicode in addition to the normal ViewAddress.\nAlso please add new enums to the end (because users of old versions will now get a different dump view when they open this updated x64dbg).. Probably it's better to rename this to toggleAutoDisassemblyFollowSelectionSlot to follow the convention of the other slots.... I was talking about this cast... If you use matchstrA(rsp, 123) it will be (char*)123 or did I miss something?. I know it\u2019s the wrong way to use it, but if you use it wrong anyway because of a mistake, will it crash?. The cast probably won\u2019t compile and if it does will still crash at runtime :)\nThe only solution here is to create a global string pool and let the patstr be the index in this pool.... ",

Fast resume: If condition is not satisfied and this flag is set, no any GUI/Plugin/Logging is performed, and the debugger just proceed as quickly as possible. If this is not set, user text will be logged(but no system's default log) and the plugin is invoked. Condition \"0\" is recognised as a shortcut directly in breakpoint handler, enabling higher-performance tracing.\n4. Hit counter. There's a counter counting the number of hits. This is unconditional.\n5. It's posssible to specify a command that will be executed when the condition is satisfied.\n6.

I'm worrying about inserting a non-trivally constructable object into BREAKPOINT. BREAKPOINT is often copied and memset'ed.\n. We need to versionify BRIDGEBP and any other plugin-related structure so that we can do anything in the future while keeping backward-compatibility.\n. logging is useful only if condition is 0. If it were 1, the debugger halts and you have access to everything.\n. It's currently not possible to do it, however you have some workaround. You can use \"bpgoto\" feature to direct the program to some patch area, make some comparison there and then let it trigger a second breakpoint if your counter reaches the value.\nSuch flexible feature as you described will be enabled in the upcoming script controllable conditional breakpoint with which you can write a script to evaluate the break condition.\n. implemented in #1243\n.

I've added a comment noting such problem in bridgemain.h. Will come back as soon as the bridge functions be improved.\n. Besides the problems in bridge, I use the internationalization mechanism come together with Qt. However the dbg have no interaction with Qt. So all texts in dbg will go through bridge to get their translations, which is problematic.\n. Some one have to test the translation branch recently merged. I find it not work after reinstalling snapshots from GitHub. I forgot to upload some files I've changed.\n. No, you don't need a system with Chinese locale. You can rename the x64dbg_zh_CN.qm into x64dbg_(locale).qm . It will trick x64dbg into thinking you've installed the translation for your current locale. I'm wondering if it's even nessesary to provide language in preferences.\n. all done\n. appendRegister() produces compiler warning......\n. It was supposed to work by disassembling the current instruction before, though I have changed my mind and decided to implement it by defining a new type of memory breakpoint. It should work with previous restrictions removed.\nBut I have to fix another issue right now. If you're using a translated version of x64dbg and reordering tabs, it produces dozens of message boxes, which is very disturbing.\n. When testing current memory breakpoint capability I found memory breakpoint doesn't work. code is:\nresume:\nADD R11,1\nMOV RDI,table\nMOVZX RAX,R11B\nLEA RAX,QWORD PTR DS:[RAX+RDI]\nXCHG RAX,RDI\nMOV AL,BYTE PTR DS:[RDI]\nADD AL,1\nMOV BYTE PTR DS:[RDI],AL\nMOV RAX,QWORD PTR DS:[table]\nJMP resume\ntable:\nNOP...(256)\napply a memory breakpoint to all these and see it.\n. Oh no! Olly's memory breakpoint can be set to any buffer. Olly will bypass false hits automatically.\n. I'll defer the work until both memory breakpoint solution and disassemble solution are compared further.\nTrace record data is useful not only in UI, but also in analysising. You can first run a \"coverage\" run,labelling every executable instructions and during analysising or next run, simply treat all instructions not executed before as junk bytes. I won't forget it.\n. Trace record is not going to be intended for identifying hot spots. I will store a bit for every byte at most. If you want to identify hot spots then breakpoint counter is waiting for you.\n. I have decided to implement this feature by disassemble approach, in the GUI. Every byte will be given a bit indicating whether it has been executed or not. When stepping in, all bytes covered by the current instruction will be marked. This takes 512 bytes every page. For a typical 20MB VMProtect'ed executable, the memory footprint will be around 2.5MB. Can be extended so every byte takes 8bit or 16bit, but that will not be implemented first. This works best with currently unimplemented \"Animate into\" operation.\n. How to store and load large amounts of binary data such as the trace record to and from the database?\n. I've finished TraceRecordManager class, however I'm facing difficulties in connecting it to the stepping event and fetching current instruction. Moving it into DBG now.\n. The code in DBG is freezed now. Currently implemented feature: 3 types of trace record, and a framework enabling future expanding.\nThe single-bit mode records whether the byte have been executed.\nThe byte mode includes a 6-bit hit counter and 2-bit byte type. Byte type records if the byte was an instruction heading, body, or tailing, or overlapped. An overlapped byte is the byte interpreted as differing instructions. If any byte of the current instruction overlaps with another one then the entire instruction is considered overlapped.\nThe word mode increases the hit counter to 14 bits.\nThere is an instruction counter counting number of instructions stepped, but that's currently unused. It will be recorded in future modes.\n. Trace record can be enabled on 4096-byte buffer. Each buffer can have different modes.\n. I've change the code to use that. Working on database load/store now.\n\n. So what is the correct way of reporting these issues? I just dislike message boxes followed by message boxes.\n. I'll replace these message boxes with Retry/Cancel message boxes. If cancel is hit then no message boxes will show and the error is not reported.\n. Message boxes are equipped with Retry/Cancel button now.\n. Hit count is decimal.\nBytes is correct. 0x00000003 is stored in little endian as 03 00 00 00 in memory.\n. I used hex originally but returned to decimal when I made the pull request. Breakpoint counter is intended for performance analysis, not for machine-readable, and it's assumed to be resetted only. Using decimal is more convenient in this case. You're not supposed to edit it to an arbitary value.\nBytes box should match byte order exactly with memory location, because registers can be read and write from memory. If you want big-endian then you can use Expression box.\n. No. These objects are created with new operators, not with some methods provided by Qt, so Qt probably won't help. And I remembered have commited a commit called \"delete wMenu\" ebaf188 . It works, without any consequences like memory have been freed twice would have had.\nBesides this, I found the menu system so wired. I have finished Trace Record feature #654 . However I'm currently facing difficulty adding a menu into the disassembly view. The project really needs restructuring.\n. I'm not very familiar with Qt, though. If there is anything wrong with my ideas please forgive me.\n. Yes, Qt have object tree feature. I'm going to check if there is any object without a parent is created or any parent is not deleted.\n. While most QObjects are deleted when parent is deleted, in reality some parents may never be deleted until the application terminates. The main window and the views are among those parents. When a context menu is built, it is held in memory until their parents are deleted(which is at the application termination time). This is in fact just like a memory leak. I'll add \"delete wMenu\" whenever I spot such condition.\nI'm going to run xxxdbg in a low-memory virtual machine and instead of stopping debug and saving db, I just suspend the entire OS and save it on disk. These context menus are going to be an issue when you debug continuously for months without restarting.\n. So you want to select part of source line. That's indeed not possible with x64dbg, But you open your source file in a text editor and then copy it anyway.. The hit counter is recorded, however is not displayed in the GUI, nor is there any way to read them out except reading the database. That will be done in subsequent pull requests. My local branch is really outdated.\n. Trace record is crashing when the instruction crosses page boundary.\n. So I'll add these functions in the middle of DBGFUNCTIONS to avoid conflicting. This feature have to be tested. I've just fixed an crashing condition within it.\n. Leave the icon as is. An icon will be finally added.\n. It seems the conflicts may origin from GUI.\n. I don't know what to do now. May be it can only be merged manually. Thanks, @mrexodia.\n. Can I reinstall the latest branch from development now?\n. I'm going to sleep now.\n. You may minimize the window as a workaround, so that all the GUI drawing will not happen, speeding up the plugin.\n. I forgot to give a native name to those dump windows, causing the crash.\n. I'd like to leave this issue as a reminder. I would like to introduce this feature as a core feature instead of as a plugin.\n. Finished.

Welcome to try out my new exporter plugin at https://github.com/torusrxxx/x64dbgpatchexporter\n. A \"monkey\" feature is also good. A \"monkey\" feeds the function with random arguments so any potential vulunability will be exposed quickly.\n. I think so. The feature proposed in this issue can be implemented in script\nalready. I suggest instead of implementing it we instead provide a \"script\nlibrary/market\" where some useful script are provided. And is it possible\nto get a random value in script?\n. This could be useful when calculating something after patching some code.\nProposed implementation:\n**command**:call mydll:myfunction, stdcall, 1, 2, 3Store the previous registers context, put some guard zeros on the stack, then put the arguments on the stack and registers, other registers are zeroed. Then put current RIP on the stack and set a software breakpoint on RIP and continue execution at called function. When the function returns it will stop at the breakpoint, and the registers are restored to previous context, RAX,RDX are stored in$resultand$result2`.\nAn alternative way is to use zero as the return address, and capture that exception then restore the context.\ncalling conventions:\nx86: stdcall, cdecl, fastcall, thiscall\namd64: stdcall\n. Copy the text representation of the stack view.\n. I will add it soon for customer satisfactory.\nThere have been few contributers contributing. I just worked full time for a few days and I becomes one of the top contributers. I need the best debugger to work with. I used to rely on precompiled software and writing private plugins, but I now contribute to an open-source project and do not have to complain. So if you want new feature, do it yourself and contribute back is probably the most efficient way. And instead of writing plugins I add these features directly into the core. I'll be enjoying my custom-made debugger next month with every feature I want.\n. Isn't it available in \"Symbols\" tab?\n. So we just add a mudule called \"All modules\" and that's it.\n. In Olly, there is a blinking text in the status bar telling you how many\ndebug events are processed per second, so you know how fast is the progress.\n. Waiting for a new compile guide and video.\n. No. Only when translation needs update will lupdate.bat run.\n. The only difference is that the register view can scroll down more, revealing the content behind. And some space behind DRX.\n. \n. Different systems have different default font sizes.\n. I have re-applied it in the PR.\n. This PR is for \"copy text representation of stack\" feature, not register height fix.\n. repull it now\n. I have built it successfully.VS2013 professional.\n. I know what's happening. I'll pull a fix now.\n. You should clean and rebuild the entire project.\n. I just want DB/DD. These pseudo-instructions are easy to implement in XEDParse.\n. capstone_wrapper update is required for this pull request to work.\n. dotNET is not supported. It's best to analysis these files with Microsoft's\nIL disassembler.\n. dotNET is a x86 PE file which contains additional dotNET-specific headers. It will automatically switch to the native instruction set(x86-64 or IA64) upon boot. I'm not very clear about how they boot.\n. I know what's happening. I have fixed it on my local branch.\n. The problem with dump window will be resolved in pull request #730.\n. I think I have committed all the files now.\n\n. I am going to push commits for #368 (Save column widths).\n. OK, it is ready to merge now.\n. I want this style:\n\n. EB00 is not really a jump. It is merely a junk instruction.\n. There's a x86 to IR converter in Snowman. Will that be useful?\n. Selection backwards without \"shift\" key pressed works fine now. It treats the whole folded section as a single instruction.\n. Different potential contributers have different todo lists. Documentation\nseems like a very good start point.\n. Maybe you can set up a different repository for the documentation and register it at readdocs.org, then I'll help you migrate the documentation there. Adding a feature without writing documentation for it usually lead to chaos if it doesn't work in the future.\n. Something is wrong with the project configuration. There are zero repositories owned by the team.\n. I think setting window title to the executable name is better because the user can then rename the executable, enabling custom-style obfuscation.\nUsing a handle viewer with this feature on I found the following windows:\n[Title: (Main window)] [Class name: Qt5QWindowIcon]\n\n[Title: MHTabWidgetClasWindow] [Class name: Qt5QWindowIcon]\n[Title: (null)] [Class name: Qt5QWindowIcon]\n[Title: statusBarWindow] [Class name: Qt5QWindowIcon]\n[Title: (null)] [Class name: Qt5QWindowIcon]\n[Title: menuBarWindow] [Class name: Qt5QWindowIcon]\n\n[Title: (executable name)] [Class name: Qt5QWindowIcon]\n[Title: (executable name)] [Class name: Qt5QWindowPopupDropShadowSaveBits]\n[Title: (executable name)] [Class name: Qt5QWindowPopupDropShadowSaveBits]\nSo you can see without this feature FindWindow will be able to find a window named x64dbg\n. In fact you cannot write a plugin to do it. When the plugin callback is invoked, the debugger is not in paused state. Something must be changed in the dbg.\n. We are in a system module now, so there is probably no tricky code. And we can then let the program run instead of single stepping, and rely on DEP feature on the processor serving as a hardware breakpoint.\n. I'm going to sleep now.\n. These issues have been fixed.\n. The current icon (recent-files) for \"run until user code\" is just a place\nholder waiting to be replaced by a dedicated icon...\n. We're giving a single root object to every plugins. As far as I know the\nplugin callback dispatcher just  call every callback with the same\nparameter.\n. So if the plugin just creates its own object and append that object to the\nroot without json_decref(root), everything is fine. But if it invokes\njson_decref(root), then everything is wrong.\n. And some plugins just change the root parameter, so that all subsequent\nplugins will load/save data from a different storage. These issues are\nreally plugin bugs. We can just document the issue in the documentation and\nleave the debugging work to the plugin developers.\n. We needn't do anything. We just need to test if the pluginsdk can be built\nand used. The debugger can be built.\n. I have changed my mind. I just want to check the watchdog all the times. Maybe we can add it an option instead of a command. So although this patch works, it's better deferred until the watch view is implemented, and finalize the watch view design then.\n. It can be closed. I'll push another (probably large) pull request after\ninstruction undo and watch view finalize.\n. For strings these are supported. Are all of these formats, such as \"Base64, Deflate, Gzip, Integer List, Float List\" within scope of x64dbg?. Because you can always use an address as its label, this feature is not useful.. New menu entries:\n- [x] Increase 8(size of a pointer)\n- [x] Decrease 8(size of a pointer)\n- [x] Push\n- [x] Pop\n- [x] Create New Thread Here\n- [x] Browse in Explorer (Modules)\n. New menu entries:\n- [x] Animate into\n- [x] Animate over\n- [x] Animate command\n. confirmed on 32bit release.\n. This problem can be resolved by reverting capstone to an earlier version.\n. For full trace record support you need graph-based compression which is\neven more powerful. It's not uncommon to produce gigabytes of data during a\nfull trace record.\n. The reason for using small pages is to allow per-page trane record setting.\nModes for execution is different from modes for memory access. The user\nwant to set appropiate mode. Per-page trace record mode setting will be\nre-enabled after memory tracing be added.\n. Proposed data to be recorded by the trace:\n-  RIP or EIP\n-  Code Bytes(Optional; Can be enabled by the user to disambigulate code in self-modifying code)\n-  Memory Data(When the instruction references a memory location)\n-  Registers Data(Record once every N instructions)\n-  Branch Destination and Source(Optional; Can be inferred from RIP change)\n-  Thread Name(Optional; Tracing can be single-threaded)\nUnlike trace record, these data will not be stored per-byte, but will stored in another global storage. We can add some index in the trace record to allow easy access to these data from disassembler.\nIt is the data compression algorithm that blocks the development. This algorithm should recognize every code re-execute and store these data only once, and pack the huge amount of data in the tightest possible and also extendable format. We can also export these data uncompressed.\n. Launcher doesn't need to be updated very frequently. Last update was months\nago...\n. As far as I know there is no such framework except LoadString\n. Can you configure the build server so that it won't push any releases if\nany component of the program fails to compile?\n. Nope, I have some executables which intentionally exits from its main thread and runs on a secondary thread.\n. From https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686722(v=vs.85).aspx\nHow Processes are Terminated\n- A process executes until one of the following events occurs:\n- Any thread of the process calls the ExitProcess function. Note that some implementation of the C run-time library (CRT) call ExitProcess if the primary thread of the process returns.\n- The last thread of the process terminates.\n- Any thread calls the TerminateProcess function with a handle to the process.\n- For console processes, the default console control handler calls ExitProcess when the console receives a CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK signal.\n- The user shuts down the system or logs off.\n. I'll push the implementation of \"wide mode\" here if I have enough time. Display unicode string is not performance impacting. Ollydbg does it quite well, and every other hex editor, and every software can display them well. It will impact performance only if you want to get the width of every character, but we will not do it here.\n. It seems modern browsers, word processors and even multi-line text boxes\ncache the painted bitmap, and when it needs redraw, only the dirty area is\nrendered(other area is fetched from the cache). Qt supports this technology\nin \"QStaticText\". If used properly it may resolve the performance issue.\n. If you view it in another aspect, things aren't so difficult. Most tokens\nare just \"rax\", \"mov\" and so. If we cache them, then lots of slower\n\"drawText\" will be replaced with faster \"drawStaticText\".\n. further work abandoned.\n. Yes. But this feature is too insignificant to become a standalone plugin.\n. Maybe some day I will create a \"x64dbg easy\" plugin that collects all these\ntiny features together. Do you know any algorithm to do such analysis\nefficiently among thousands of breakpoints?\n. It does not really fit in the definition of knapsack problem. The hit counters must sum up exactly equal to the parent node, instead of less and equal.\n. To those who still do not get the idea yet:\nYou debug the following virtualized program:\n```\nfunction main() // <-breakpoint1\n{\nsubroutine_1();\nif(condition)\nsubroutine_2();\nelse\nsubroutine_3();\nsubroutine_4();\n}\nfunction subroutine_1() // <-breakpoint2\n{\nsubroutine_5();\n}\nfunction subroutine_2() // <-breakpoint3\n{\n}\nfunction subroutine_3() // <-breakpoint4\n{\nsubroutine_5();\n}\nfunction subroutine_4() // <-breakpoint5\n{\nsubroutine_5();\n}\nfunction subroutine_5() // <-breakpoint6\n{\n}\nfunction subroutine_6() // <-breakpoint7\n{\n}\n```\nYou run main() four times, then you probably get the hit counters:\nbreakpoint1 : 4\nbreakpoint2 : 4\nbreakpoint3 : 3\nbreakpoint4 : 1\nbreakpoint5 : 4\nbreakpoint6 : 9\nbreakpoint7 : 0\nWe can guess the probable control flow. There are many breakpoints executed 4 times, so these breakpoints are executed sequentially probably. And we can see breakpoint3+breakpoint4 is 4 times, so it is possible that they are a pair of statements in a \"if-else\" statement. breakpoint6 is executed 9 times, and 9=4+4+1, so it is possible that breakpoint6 is executed twice in the main control flow, and executed once more in subroutine_3. breakpoint7 is not executed, so it is not in the control flow. A possible graph is given below:\nbreakpoint6 -> (breakpoint1->breakpoint3+breakpoint4)+breakpoint2+breakpoint4\nUnder pratical condition, it is usually the case the graph must have many roots, because there is no subroutine that is called in all control flow branches. Nodes with zero hit count can be ignored. Nodes with equal hit count can be assumed to be executed one after another, so they can be graphed as a list instead of a tree. A node cannot be the child of itself. Child node may be used many times because it is possible to call the same subroutine many times.\nThe graph should be read bottom-up. The least executed functions are the main control flow. Then they calls their parents, then the parents call their parents. The root is the most frequently called subroutine.\n. Yes, it will be better to add more information. This analysis is intended to be a very cheap yet useful dynamic analysis.\n. Given the exponential computational complexity, I think it is out of scope now. For more info, view https://csgrid.org/csg/subset_sum/. No. It will get lost quickly if you step over several obfuscated loops with\nindirect calls or jumps. We must record it per byte.\n. I will implement software-based branch record with trace record framework\nafter I finish debugging my executables. This is a separate trace mode and\nthe first variable-length trace mode. It will consider all branch\ninstructions, calls/rets and exceptions as branch. It will record branch\ndestinations and percentage.\n. Could you please take a look at this pull request and tell me if it is okay to merge? I think this pull request is more complete than 2c3eb1ec47ab90d6de302e4. It introduces an option controlling whether to record data during a trace so that tracing can speed up if trace record is not needed. I like to make separate pull requests for each feature I want to introduce so probably no more commits will come here.\n. That's too bad\n. Notice the slight misalignment of the bolded down jump arrow.\n. I have come up with an idea about a new appearance. Just drew a sketch on mspaint:\n\n. Can this issue be closed now, jvoisin?\n. We should not use \"run\", \"erun\", \"sti\" or anything like that inside a breakpoint handler. It is going to produce problems. Use the condition to resume the debuggee.\n. You can already use \"crackme.exe.#1000\" in the go to dialog and it is remembered.\n. It compiles now.\n. In my opinion, unlike in a IDE, in a disassembler folding a function is not useful. There are just too many functions, so even if you folds all functions, you still cannot view the outline of the program. We are probably not viewing functions being folded for most times.\n. I dislike some modifications of it. I want to know how many events are passed precisely. So I cannot accept any modifications of the result of dbggetdbgevents. I would rather like \"%1 events in %2 ms\".\n. # Usages of event counters:\n1. As a general purpose counter: When there are many events bursting out in a second, you can count it with events counter.\n   When the program starts you may notice there are many debug events. Most of these events are DLL load events. If the program loads within one or two seconds, you can directly watch the events counter and roughly know how many DLLs the program uses. Similarly, if the program outputs some debug strings, you can count the number of strings from the event counter. This usage requires an exact counter.\n2. As a tool to watch the state of the program: Well-designed \"animate into\" operation should maintain a very steady stepping rate. If there are any extra debug events, you know something unexpected is happening, and probably stop stepping immediately. This usage does not require an exact counter.\n. Don't have to output only one variable in dbggetdbgevents! You can change the signature of dbggetdbgevents to void dbggetdbgevents(uint* events, uint* milliseconds) and output both the raw eventsSinceLastQuery and the timeDiffMs. Then you can write any logic in the GUI. If you feel you don't have time to add an option for switching between different counter modes it is still acceptable, because it's very easy to add one.\n.

You cannot do it directly. You can write a launcher that start the process with CREATE_SUSPENDED and start x64dbg to debug it though. The launcher might not work due to #635 .\n. You are wrong. Please read https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684179(v=vs.85).aspx carefully.\n. I have looked through the Qt documentation. QLocalSocket provides named pipe support. This implies QFile is not intended for accessing named pipes.\n. fopen seems to support named pipe. I have never tested it though, only writing to a text file is tested.\n. Does this issue still persist?\n. The plugin can now use GuiAddInfoLine() inside callback CB_SELCHANGED to add the items.\n.

In bool vardel(const char* Name, bool DelSystem) function, it does some weird and dangerous logic to delete a variable.

Assumed to be fixed.\n. I checked the source. It calls and only calls GuiAddRecentFile when it successfully bootstraps. So, we just remove the unnecessary MRU code and it just work better and resolves #915 !\n. The indexes of these widgets, columns and tabs are going to be highly volatile during rapid development process. We may break these indexes everytime a new feature is introduced.

I don't think users will try to install bug fixes and highlight plugins\nwith it. This plugin should still support many plugins, especially the\nplugins that do unpacking. This plugin also helps people rewrite their\nplugins to be really compatible with x64dbg by providing examples and stub\nfunctions.\n.

It can only print gradients up to screen size. That's acceptable.\n. #1060\n. There are more call stack frames in the new version.. Deleting ini won't take effect immediately.\n. The MxCsr register cannot be modified even on a very old release.\n. If the dotNET executable is set to \"AnyCPU\", you must use x64dbg on 64-bit Windows, or use x32dbg on 32-bit Windows. If the dotNET executable is set to \"x86\" or \"x64\", you must use the right version of x64dbg.\n. I remember that any named variable must not be optimized by return value\noptimization according to the standard.\n. Seems like a invalid pointer dereference\n. Selection change is infrequent. It can only be changed in a mouse release\nevent or mouse move event, which has a minimum delay of 1/30 seconds.\n. Other documentation is available on x64dbg website.. The user no longer has to restart x64dbg now.\n. I know what's the problem. You're debugging a .NET DLL. x64dbg will pass\nvalidation if the .NET header data section is not NULL. It doesn't check\nfor actual architecture for the .NET file. If you try a non-dotNET DLL it\nshould work fine.\n. x64dbg thinks it to be a dotNET file. It says \"This file is a dotNET\napplication.\" That might be the problem.\n. This problem is fixed by not checking .NET for DLL files.\n. It is because the feature to save the layout is not fully implemented yet.\n. use https://github.com/torusrxxx/ExtraInfo\n. You will need to evaluate what is old base first.\n. No I mean it should support the expression functions so I can filter the\nuntraced references out.\n. Yes I've bind them to \"5\" and \"6\".\n. Done. Supported. It is possible to use \"%PID%\" as an argument in the command line. Refer to\nthe documentation.\n. - Added Variables View (varlist)\n- Use the same shortcut for graph refresh as in other views\n- Changed to \"Follow DWORD in Memory Map\"\n- Show size of stack call frame in call stack view\n. Oh I don't want to update \"capstone_wrapper\"\n. github says I have committed something to \"capstone_wrapper\" in this pull request, but it is a mistake if I really do.\n. Yes I don't want to update it now because there are some modifications to it to make the tracer working.\n. You can use references view. There is a list for modules. You can enter the\nname of the module to search, and right click on it and follow in memory\nmap to view the sections of it.\n. I'm afraid part of this issue won't be added soon. Code folding feature\nsaves each range in a tree. It does not allow overlapping ranges to be\nfolded. The code folding line is drawn only if the code segment is added in\nthe tree. Therefore, you either have to register the range of the entire\nfunction in the tree, thus do not allow people fold two functions, or keep\nit as what it behaves today.\nAs for selecting the first instruction hides the checkbox. Folding of the\nentire selection is always prioritised. If the selection has only one\ninstruction then the checkbox is hidden because folding a single\ninstruction is a silly operation.\n. It is also common in Visual Studio code. Visual Studio tend to put function\naddresses in registers if it is used multiple times.\n. Perhaps a help message in the registers view on this segment register?\n. There should be a global routine shared by DBG and GUI and plugins to\nconvert an address to its symbolic name or label, in a uniform way. I think\n_dbg_addrinfoget with flag_label is suitable for this role.\n. Add a new button in attach dialog to find the process of a window.. A fix is pushed immediately after this branch is merged to get \"attach to hidden process\" really working.. 1. Please add all the files you newly created to x64dbg_translations.pro\nregardless of whether it needs to be translated.\n2. Please specify a parent for all the breakpoint tables in order to let Qt\nmanage the memory for you.\n3. \"bpaddr\" is in fact a local variable. Please do not add it as a member.\n4.  The actual class layout of BreakpointsViewTable is not needed in\nBreakpointsView.h. Please consider declaring it as a class forward\ndefinition instead of using #include and only use #include in the\nBreakpointsView.cpp. x64dbg is a large project that takes long time to\ncompile. Dependency hurts compiling performance.\n5. Please do not write a function inside the header unless it is going to\nbe inlined.\n6.

Ollydbg has the feature not to show the module name if it is within the same module.. Thanks for your report. In fact x64dbg is weak at string searching,\nespecially for non-English applications.

This pull request now only includes the windows view and the fix for #1424.. Do you know whether RtlQueryProcessDebugInformation would work if the user\nwants to browse the heap when the debuggee is paused? If it doesn't we must\nre-implement this function in x64dbg or GleeBug with ReadProcessMemory,\nwhich is very hard to do.\n. Thanks for your generous contribution. I will enable the heaps view as soon as possible.. Yes, PID there is currently always in hex.. You will be able to do so soon after #1473 is integrated.. Although the feature is completed, there's no timetable to release it\nbecause no one is working on it currently. You might need to wait for\nanother year or start contributing.\n. Is this issue fixed by #1965?. He is trying to debug a game with a DRM solution in Ring 0. A driver dedicated to circumvent the DRM is a better solution..

Are you sure that the debuggee does not make use of any anti-debugging\ntechnique?\n. I mean, we can add an option to run the script when the script is loaded\nfrom the favourite menu or script tab, but plugins should be able to\ncontrol their behaviour without affecting the user setting.\n. I don't see the point upgrading to Visual Studio 2015.. Ok. Are there any blockers of upgrading? Qt 5.11 doesn't support 2013 anymore.. Yes, you can upgrade x64dbg to use Visual Studio 2015.. This code may recurse indefinitely if the pointers have a cyclic reference\npattern.\n. Yes, the debugger simply resumes if it is a read access.. As the processor only supports 00-execute,01-write-only,10-read/write,11-read/write except instruction fetch, this issue can be renamed to read-only hardware breakpoint.. Probable cause:\ncbStepInto called\u2192cbDebugRunInternal called\u2192WAITID_RUN unlocked\u2192stepping, before the debuggee actually stepped\u2192cbStepInto called\u2192cbDebugRunInternal called\u2192dbgisrunning() is true.

We can sunset breakpoint name by converting it into a label when breakpoint name is provided in edit breakpoint dialog & commands.. since #1661 (July 27) you can enter a decimal number with decimal point in the edit floating point number register dialog..

Adds \"delete\" menu to labels, bookmarks, variables, etc.. Add history in graph.\nFollow parent or children of a block.. Wishlist for the first version is cleared.. Thanks for reporting, should be fixed now.. Due to performance issues, there is a maximum count of 20 auto-complete entries.. Very slow when loaded x64gui.pdb (36MB) and typed a symbol in it. The user has to type a space first to stop auto-complete.. There is no such data structure exist in x64dbg core. Also, we cannot store\ngigabytes of symbol information in memory.\n. There is one thing that this code can improve. Qt calls multiple times data() and then DbgSymAutoComplete() and then SymEnumSymbols(). I tried to cache the results for the same text but recieved segment faults, so the code is what it is.. Press arrow keys \u2192 textbox changes(selects a suggestion or a history record?) \u2192 candidates changes \u2192 qcompleter messed up. x64dbg cannot debug a folder, so that shouldn't be an issue. MAX_PATH * 3 is a safe choice since a 4-byte UTF8 character is encoded as 2 UTF16 characters.. Code for this feature already exists in x64dbg. See source code for info\nbox or former ExtraInfo plugin.\n. The problem can be greatly reduced by setting process affinity(use single core).. We can disable autocomments for this particular instruction \u201cmov edi,\nedi\u201d.It appears in system modules frequently and doesn\u2019t have any meaning.\n. Usage: {winerror@5} will display ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED:(description in your language). I don't think FormatMessage supports NTSTATUS.. So can we add a new {ntstatus@C0000005} format function or extend winerror to allow one more argument which accepts a module name like ntdll.dll? I don't think many DLLs support this operation..

Some other places use WordEditDialog to input buffer length. It would confuse users if they can input a string in it.. Hex stream is already available in copy menu. Probably we don't need to duplicate it here? And I have an idea to combine hex editor, multiline string editor and data copy dialog into a dialog with tabs. Is it a good idea?. \nI designed a new Data Copy dialog and Hex Editor, but the thick border makes it less appealling to me. Any advice?. The new dialog on the left is less compact than original one on the right due to additional border and margin. You can try out at https://github.com/torusrxxx/x64dbg/tree/patch00000089. \nIt feels better now and I have removed the old data copy dialog.\n. \u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u8981\u7528\u9017\u53f7\u5206\u5f00\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u3002\n. \u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u5b58\u5230\u539f\u6765\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u4fdd\u5b58\u4e3a\u65b0\u6587\u4ef6\u3002. Conditional breakpoint doesn't allow any stepping in the plugin callback or\nbreakpoint command.\n. add quotes please. example: log \"{mem;100@cip}\". What visual effect do you expect?. My original idea is that the user define a DLL breakpoint with his command to execute, and set break condition to \"0\". Almost nobody would use such a feature to execute a command on specific event even if it is implemented, both because there are so many events, making configuration complicated, as well as its usefulness is less than a DLL breakpoint.. Instead of adding more and more options, introducing a log filtering system might be a better solution?. I think there will be following log types, each can be disabled\nindividually:\nBreakpoint log\nException log(and ignored exception log)\nDLL log\nThread log\nUser log(output of log/printstack commands)\nPlugin log,for all plugins. Plugins can have their own log filtering system\nif needed.\nError log(such as those when entered command is not found)\nOther log can't be disabled.\nA further filtering by regular expression can be applied to user,breakpoint\nand plugin log.A log matched by a regular expression can be ignored or\nx64dbg only accept them.\n. Doing this would also mean assemblers should support such notation.\nHowever, this is not the case. So, this feature is probably not suitable\nfor x64dbg.\n. Copy your selection and paste in log.\n. Fixed in pull request 1947.\n. I support the idea to add number suffix to duplicated DLL.\n. I left out it when writing the handles view due to concerns of\ncompatibility between different versions of operating system (type numbers\nare different).\n. This assumes the type name \"Process\" and \"Thread\" is consistent across Windows versions (seems true). Process names can be retrieved with \"GetModuleBaseName\" (not done yet). For Windows 10, \"GetThreadDescription\" might be interesting.. How do you think to fix this problem? If the debuggee doesn't open a\nprocess with query privileges, its access is very limited, and it is very\nlikely the debuggee already knows its PID in its memory. I don't want to\nfix this bug as almost all process operations require query privilege. A\nhandle without query privilege can't be useful for viral transmission.\n. closes #1086\n. When x87SW_TOP is modified, ST(X) is not swapped, instead x87rX is swapped. This behaviour is also observed in current releases, so is it a problem anymore?. I'll test it to see if there is anything wrong. There are a few updates to this patch.. FSAVE instruction saves each ST(x) register to destination, and FRSTOR instruction loads each ST(x) register from memory. It doesn't import and export in x87rx. So the swapping behaviour is a normal phenomenon, not a problem.. This patch appears to be working. You can try it when the program has used some of x87 register stack, not when it is empty.. If there is no data in database, CBLOADDB won't be called (src/dbg/database.cpp:260) because there is no data to read. This is also the case when you debug a new executable. CBSAVEDB will be called all the times to save plugin data, but if no plugin stores any data, next time CBLOADDB won't be called either.. I'm not sure if such a cache system will be useful to anyone else, making it worth extra development effort and memory requirement. Why do you want to search for a string that you already know in the first place?. So you are not changing the content of a string, but instead changing the string you are searching when typing it. We can make x64dbg cancel ongoing search and search for new string instead.. It would take developers 5 minutes to add it, but no one has yet come up with an idea how and where this float editor will apear.. In Ollydbg the user can only edit a float value when dump is in float mode, and edit a double value when dump is in double mode. The user cannot edit edit a double value in stack but can edit a float value.. The method used in Ollydbg doesn't work directly in x64dbg because the stack size is 32-bit or 64-bit, and the user might want to edit double value in x86 or edit float value in x64.. duplicate of #1550. Could you give an example image?. Export and other \"x64dbg-defined\" exports (\"OptionalHeader.EntryPoint\") is not added to symbol cache, causing the issue. The solution is to add them regardless of whether PDB has been loaded or not.. mrexodia's intent is to add these export names into the symbol cache, not just into SymAutoComplete. I would like to always add these exports, if there is not a same symbol at the same address already.. bpm\u4e0d\u8981\u52a0\u65b9\u62ec\u53f7\uff0c\u52a0\u65b9\u62ec\u53f7\u4ee3\u8868\u5148\u4ee5\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u9488\u4ece\u91cc\u9762\u8bfb\u53d6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5730\u5740\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002. Hi, guy. There is a \"commithash.txt\" file in each release of x64dbg, which you can check against commit history on Github.. There is a problem with \"first visible address \u00b1 1\" in floating number view. In development version of x64dbg, when you press \u21d4 keys, the floating point numbers change into something meaningless, instead of displaying a next number. Therefore, I decide to shift a \"word size\" instead.. To make it clear: if(IsArgumentsLessThan(argc, 2)) already checks the number of arguments. The real cause is Yara.. By doing this you have a risk to run the rest of program if the loop breaks, but I think this feature is nevertheless useful.. cmd-debug-control.cpp:39\nEvaluate the breakpoint location. If the breakpoint location would be the same as EIP, step once first(or run for a second time from the temporary breakpoint).. Child windows are followed and enumerated.\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/da913f7cdc53f7d01293885f6706aaead14b2903/src/dbg/handles.cpp#L227. A possible problem of the code is that when the debuggee creates a child window under a parent window which the debuggee doesn't own (ridiculous but not impossible). In this case that top level window will be dropped at first EnumWindows scan, and then this child window of debuggee is missed..

Could you explain why you think this feature would be helpful to most users, and what's your next thing to add into your instruction filter dialog? At a first glance I don't find a use case for it that is better than simply put these instructions into a references view.. Filtering instructions just by mnemonic, as it is in the pull request, is\nnot very helpful.\n. Isn't other more interesting and easier filtering a better way to start, such as filter by user/system attribute? Basically I don't want to add a feature that almost nobody uses and we have to maintain it.. This feature is useful in some cases and even more useful if it can be combined with other filters. I'm just waiting for one more filter so that other contributors can see how to add a filter.. Nice. Reproduce it by:\u2460follow its operand in dump\u2461modify its operand and see the infobox is updated\u2462press \"Ctrl+Backspace\" to undo the change and see the infobox is not updated.\nThe dump has a periodic update event but the infobox doesn't, but it is expected that you can manually update it by clicking on the instruction.. You can make all executables in x64dbg folders read-only to prevent malware\nfrom infecting them, if that's what you needed.\n. If the malware actually removes the readonly flag and infects your x64dbg installations, then your documents, browser, email, operating system and everything else might already be infected and you will need to clean up the system anyway. x64dbg itself doesn't need to be secured. The biggest usecase I see for a separate db folder and install folder is to allow x64dbg be run from a shared (read-only) network location and allow database files be cleaned very easily. This is a useful usecase although nobody is working on it. It should be easy to add such an option.. An application that automatically puts itself \"Topmost\" is always annoying, as it can hide your window, and even worse when it opens a modal dialog and makes the main window topmost, you can't input and finish your dialog and the application is essentially deadlocked. Therefore it might not be a good choice to always make \"topmost\" option permanent. Though we can add a setting in the settings dialog (x64dbg doesn't put itself back topmost when settings dialog is open now).. Oh no. When I'm digging into the source, it turns out that DbgDisasmFastAt calls into disasm_fast.cpp:bool disasmfast(const unsigned char* data, duint addr, BASIC_INSTRUCTION_INFO* basicinfo), where there is a Capstone object created to disassemble the instruction. Besides, that function doesn't handle the corner case where address is near the end of the page, and finally the returned boolean flag is dropped in the call chain.\n. So the current code reads the current instruction, handles the corner case correctly, and without using that buffer it just calls the same routine which is not aware of close-to-page-end condition. A boring code duplication and waste.\n. Okay, I don't know the difference between the two functions before...\n. This is for surrogates. Do you know the details of UTF-16 encoding? Maybe you want to look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16\n. No, updateFonts is a virtual function which is already overridden. AbstractTableView::updateFonts calls its setFont which conflicts with current font.\n. Probably I can move that into AbstractTableView as a separate function, but not in updateFonts because there is another setFont to set the font for generic table views there.\n. I have changed AbstractTableView a lot on my local branch. A new \"Edit Columns\u201d dialog is introduced to allow users to reorder/hide columns in a table view. That have to be pushed together with this pull request now. Just wait a moment please.\n. This command is trace record oriented. Condition is often set to \"0\".\n. I'm using memicmp. It is case-insensitive.\n. May be it should be, but I think it is useless. Modern processor cache coherence protocol already guarantees that an aligned word read/write is atomic.\n. But it is not possible to get the script-controlled condition if async execution mode is used.\n. In fact we shouldn't allow these commands to execute here. We have introduced script-controlled condition, so there is no need for such commands.\n. There isn't any ready-made script file that make use of script command to pause now. If we introduce script-controlled break condition earlier, then less people will make these script files. We should tell them to use \"breakpointcondition\" instead of such commands.\n. coz DBG_SETTINGS_UPDATED is not triggered when the application initializes so the bTraceRecordEnabledDuringTrace is not initialized. This line of code initializes it.\n. then just print the CIP is enough\n. Well I can introduce an option\n. I think we can disable history recording during an automated trace.\n. if there are too many debug events then it is dropped\n. race condition when reading out the value. Use an interlocked function to read instead.\n. In fact it is also used in the thread creation time, that's why I want locale-dependent date formatting.\n. In fact I have not observed a significant performance loss. After all there is only a few lines in the CPUStack that need to repaint.\n. Yes, it needs more fine tuning. Also the race condition is a major concern\nthat could lead to crash. By the way, could you check the previous PR so we\ncan get rid of those irrelavant diffs?\n. Because I believe TitanEngine needs to be informed of the new thread.\n. Sometimes the argument is a small integer.\n. If you suspend all the threads and click \"run\", the debugger would enter a \"running\" state but no thread actually runs.\n. Oh, if I create a thread and then suspend the main thread and run, TitanEngine's ThreaderIsAnyThreadActive still returns false. This code has to be removed or TitanEngine has to be fixed.\n. The debugging engine can use this information to improve ThreaderIsAnyThreadActive implementation so it won't return false when a new thread is about to be created.\n. We are already improving titanengine by writing an alternative of it. And since this code is shorter than CreateRemoteThread and provides a chance for the engine to recieve the information, why shouldn't we use it? ThreaderCreateRemoteThread should be very easy to add in gleebug.\n. remove this debug output\n. Please keep 32-bit code and 64-bit code the same\n. Not all characters between 31 and 255 are printable.\n. Since every string in DBG is encoded with UTF-8, this cast will likely result in invalid UTF-8 encoding.\n. I don't think getLabel() has anything to do with _dbg_addrinfoget(). Returning true here won't terminate _dbg_addrinfoget().\n. It is inconsistent with the next string\n. So I changed it.\n. It is because updating the setting in the GUI (and then clearing the cache via stackupdatesettings()) will empty the call stack view. Any way to update but not to empty that view?. Please use tr() function whenever you want to show a string.. Please select carefully between SimpleWarningBox and SimpleErrorBox. Use tr() function here. The usage of DbgXrefGet is incorrect and will cause memory leak. The ExtraInfo plugin has been updated to fix it. Please use the newer version of ExtraInfo.. We should use user-configurable font whenever possible.. It is probably you have not included the header for info box yet.. Because the UI has changed to prevent user from setting items per line to 0.. Where is this message box used?. ",

Even let's say that I use the search feature to filter just those MessageBox functions, but still I have to click on all of them to set the bps, at least it's needed a menu option to set/unset those 30 bps with just one click, maybe \"Set breakpoint on every command\", \"Remove breakpoint on every command\" and \"Toggle breakpoint on import\" for a certain API. Again, this is just a small suggestion to make things with this dbg a little easier and faster.\nGreetings\n. Ok you can mark it as a duplicate of the issue #160 then, and if you have some time left to add the option to set de bp directly on the import of the API through the reference, to prevent the user of having to press enter twice, one over the reference, the other one on the code to go to the import and then finally press f2, why are you gonna do all that job, if you can have all of that done by a simple mouse click ;p xD\n. Can be taken the xml files of api monitor to create de json? How is this matter going?\n. What about my first question?...What is exactly needed for implementing this feature?...Maybe we could help..\n. This feature is not working at all as for the 11/06/2016 Snapshot\n. Let's see if I can come up with something ;)\n. The QSplitters are the ones I'm mostly referring to here. Also, once the tabs management stuff (closing/adding) is working, it would be great to save/recall them as well.\n. When you have those two options selected x64dbg is supposed to save the width of the columns and the positions of the tabs...well...it doesn't do it. Right after you close the debugger and open it again it is all as default again\n. To be even more specific, if you close/open or arrange your top tabs and then you close x64dbg, when you execute it once again, all the tabs are gonna appear misplaced and even those previously closed are still there. Also there are some frames layouts like the stack, that are not saved.\n. \n. I know, but this specific option is supposed to Load/Save the Tabs order, or at least that's what it says it does, but what I'm pointing out is that it doesn't do it at all. \n. Ok, I did some other tests and apparently the tabs order saving does work, the thing is with closed tabs, when you close some tabs and change some places then when the debugger is restarted all the tabs are gonna be there again, and that's why is so confusing....anyways...I know the whole \"layout backup\" thing is not fully implemented yet, so if you will this can be closed\n. \n. +1. Thanks @torusrxxx, I'll check those points. @mrexodia feel free to keep just what you think it's worthy or nothing if that's the case, np whatsoever ;). @mudlord the first feature I guess it could be helpful, but for the second one, I don't really see any good use for that\n. Something went wrong with this files....I'm making a new PR. This is the correct PR. Oh great, thanks then ;). Actually ARG 5 should start at [rsp+0x20]\n1st arg -> RCX -> [RSP+0] / [RBP+16]\n2nd arg -> RDX -> [RSP+0x8] / [RBP+24]\n3rd arg -> R8 -> [RSP+0x10] / [RBP+32]\n4th arg -> R9 -> [RSP+0x18] / [RBP+40]\n5th arg -> [RSP+0x20] / [RBP+48]\n6th arg -> [RSP+0x28] / [RBP+56]\n...... https://github.com/ThunderCls/xLCB. @mrexodia I think he wants to translate those odbgscript commands to a x64dbg's script engine equivalent. Thanks for your comments @torusrxxx I'll update my pr as soon as possible. Fixes done!. Ok this PR went all messed up, I'm making a new push...sorry about that. Thank you for merging \ud83d\udc4d. It could be added another couple fields to save window height/width as well. Sorry, I'm not sure of understanding what you mean, do you want to be able to make patches on memory? Before committing on the physical file?, if so, you can do that in x64dbg since....always I believe.. I'm assuming you're executing the launcher, if so, it will just try to create a couple entries in the Windows registry for shortcuts and icons and that stuff, but it's not required for proper use of the debugger, just run x32dbg.exe or x64dbg.exe directly depending on the platform you want to debug and you're good to go. Ok, there was a syncing issue when calling the windows listing function and updating the GUI, a fix will be pushed soon enough \ud83d\udc4d . Sure @mrexodia, I just don't understand the nature of the bug, or even what\u00b4s the unexpected behavior here.. Well that's what GetWindowText gives out, if you guys have any other idea, I'm all ears and willing to change it. Ok, I think I found a workaround for this, it's just a matter of using GetWindow(..., GW_OWNER)/IsWindowVisible(...) to access explicitly to the correct \"main window\" of the given process and not just the foreground window. Doing this will also decrease the amount of titles of certain processes that don't comply with these two above conditions\n\nI'll push a fix as soon as I can if this is the desired behavior. Done!. A project to implement OllyDbg plugin SDK (ollydbg plugins compatibility with x64dbg) was started some time ago in order to allow this: \nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/OllyDbg. Most of those conversion features already exist in x64dbg, tho not all of them in the same place, I mean in the Data Copy dialog.\n\nHex Dump - you have almost the same feature with the \"copy\" menu inside the dump dialog\nPrintable Text - you have \"String/Unicode\" in the copy dialog\nHex Stream - I just added it\nRaw Binary - you have the \"Binary/Save to a File\" option inside the dump dialog\nEscaped String - you have \"C-Style String\" in the copy dialog\n\nAnyways I also changed the combo for a list....way better now! I guess that's all.. PR update coming up, don't merge yet. Ok I guess now its done!...you can merge whenever you want. +1\nIt sounds fancy.. Well I should take that QMessageBox include out, also not sure if I should keep the hex stream or not since this feature in the copy menu adds spaces after every pair of digits and sometimes that could be a bummer. Other than that, yeah I guess it is ready.. I guess you're right, so the thing would be to just drop off this feature or to make it consistent...which one would it be?. So dumb of me, right? thanks...ready. The compiler complains about this being without a cast\n\n. You're right, done!. Of course, I just forgot to get rid of it. debugging purposes...I forgot to take it out xD. ",

    "RaMMicHaeL": "Nice, thanks!\n. An OllyDbg 2 plugin implementation:\nhttp://rammichael.com/dumpaddresscolor\nI must say that it works pretty well.\nI'm not sure that x64dbg has the API to implement it. Does it?\n. Simply IsWindow + GetWindowThreadProcessId :)\n. I'm not sure that it's going to work well, because of false positives. For example, I opened a test process, and called CreateMutexW(0, 0, 0) multiple times. What I got was:\n0x14C, 0x150, 0x154, 0x158, ...\nThe 0x14C value, for example, can easily be a size of a buffer, and not a Mutex.\nIt's different with window handles, which are global, and designed to be more or less unique.\n. Nice! How do I enable these?\nI downloaded the new build, but I see the 7F/FF/IsPrint colors instead (which are not so helpful, if you ask me, especially in disassembly).. I could reproduce it again.\nIt hangs in the call to AcquireSRWLockExclusive now, which was added as the fix.\n\nStack trace:\nAddress           To                From              Comment

This commit looks relevant: https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/commit/53fd990c83a5b407643344f2b81c97b3ee6e9dc3\nWill try it when a snapshot is available.\n. It's being shown as an unconditional jump now. It should be conditional, such as je/jne and friends, and unlike jmp.\n. I have encountered a similar issue: after stopping the debugged executable (Alt+F2), the file is still locked.\n. You can use GitHub for releases.\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/releases\n. I got confused because what you see in the list is not what you see when editing the command. For example, the constants are prefixed with 0x when editing commands. What's the reason for that? Multiline Ultimate Assembler is not designed for this, and it works incorrectly in some cases.\nAbout the buggy command, the behavior seems inconsistent: if you click space on the command above (cmp ..., which is 66 81 78 18 0B 02), and then press enter, it seems to be re-assembled correctly. On the other hand, if you choose another command, press space, enter the command above (cmp ...), and press enter, you see an incorrect command.\n...OK, while writing this, I found out the reason: if the command wasn't changed, it's not being re-assembled. It's enough to add a space at the end of it, and the bug can be seen. I think that this is confusing, and the command should always be re-assembled. If the bytes change as a result, that's not always a bug; some commands have more than one representation.\nIn general, I tried to play with a block of code and Multiline Ultimate Assembler, and saw several issues. Here are some of them:\n- and rsp, 0xfffffffffffffff0 is assembled as 48 81 E4 F0 FF FF FF, while it can be as short as 48 83 E4 F0.\n- movabs r8, 1 is assembled as mov r8, 1. Should be 49 B8 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00.\n  Edit: turns out this is correct, as mov and movabs are the same thing. This command assembles incorrectly, though: mov r8, 123456789, the immediate is truncated.\nIf you want to stress-test XEDParse, you can disassemble blocks of code with Multiline Ultimate Assembler, and then re-assemble them. The result should be the same, or very similar. It works very well with Ollydbg, unfortunately not as well with x64dbg.\n. Thanks, I'll check it out when I have the chance.\nI see that the new engine treats numeric literals as decimal numbers.\ne.g. add eax, 60 is assembled as add eax, 0x3c.\nThis breaks Multiline Ultimate Assembler in several places, as it assumes that literals are hexadecimal.\nIs there a setting for Keystone to preserve the old behavior?\n. It can be implemented by double clicking the register name in the registers window, like OllyDbg 2 does it. This way, a register of a specific size can still be highlighted using Ctrl+H, like it works now.\n. I ended up implementing it in Multiline Ultimate Assembler. It turned out to be easier than I expected. As my plugin is probably the only consumer for this issue, you might want to close it :)\nYou can download the new version of the plugin here. It works much better with x64dbg now. Currently, the most visible issue is probably the fact that commands of the form and rsp, 0xfffffffffffffff0 assemble in a longer version than necessary, which causes all of the assembly to shift down. This can be worked around by replacing the command with the following in the plugin:\n\"\\x48\\x83\\xE4\\xF0\" ;; and rsp, 0xfffffffffffffff0\nBut in general, many blocks re-assemble cleanly, which is great.\n. > tools cannot add user made labels\nThey can use the DbgSetLabelAt API (versus DbgSetAutoLabelAt), can't they?\nI don't know what's the difference for labels, but for comments, the auto ones are gray, and I believe that comments that are set by Multiline Ultimate Assembler has to be black, because they are not auto-generated or something. The user wrote them.\n. Was the hotkey added? I only see Ctrl+Shift+A for a single function.\n. > adding a menu option in the dump/disasm/stack\nIs it already possible with the SDK?\n. I've mixed it up. For some reason, I though that hotkeys were implemented, and menus weren't, but it's the other way around.\nSo, it looks like I can implement the hotkeys with the filter API. Should I do that, instead of waiting for a cleaner hotkeys API?\n. Handling WM_KEYUP in CBWINEVENT works. On the other hand, it seems like CBWINEVENTGLOBAL stopped working. You can verify it with the existing multiasm version - hotkeys, such as Ctrl+T to create a new tab, don't work.\n. That worked, thanks. What about the following?\n- Keystone and asmjit don't support short jumps, which should be limited to 2 bytes. Works with XEDParse.\n- Is there an API for getting the xref analysis information? It can be used for the Disasm external jumps/calls option.\nI'm looking at fixing as much as possible and roll out a release of a new version of the plugin.\n. I have released a new version of multiasm (download, changelog), mostly x64db-centric.\nKeyboard hotkeys were added, as well as xref support.\n\nA solution could be to fail if short was included in the instruction and the output was not 2 bytes.\n\nThat should work. As x64dbg already strips the string, it would probably be a very simple addition :)\n. For asmjit, I've created an issue: https://github.com/asmjit/asmtk/issues/4\n. You can do this as a temporary solution, until https://github.com/asmjit/asmjit/issues/138 is properly solved.\nFrankly, I don't know what are the advantages of asmjit over Keystone, or vice versa. They both seem like high quality projects, and Keystone seems to work pretty well with Multiline Ultimate Assembler.\nFor XEDParse, there are still commands which it doesn't support. For example, a command which I found in a short testing session: mov edx, dword ptr [0x7ffe0330]\n. Here's what I see...\n\n. It's fairly easy to find these kinds of issues: disassemble a large block with Multiline Ultimate Assembler, and then assemble it back. Here's another one: and rax, 0xfffffffffffff000\n. It works perfectly, thanks!\nOne additional thing that I'm not sure whether it should be fixed in the debugger or in the plugin:\nSome commands, especially which use addressing, disassemble differently in the plugin. For example:\n\nThe plugin uses the DisasmFast function. Is that what it should be using?\n. I guess that it would be best to make the hacks and the customization (such as uppercase disasm) available to plugins, too.\n. I didn't find that one.\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=GuiDisasmGet&type=Code\n. OK, so my suggestion still applies. I think that plugins should be able to get the same disasm that the user gets when pressing space (which is with the hack, and with case customization, but without labels and such). If that's not going to happen, I might copy the hack to the plugin one day, but this solution is not very elegant.\n. > You can do this as a temporary solution, until asmjit/asmjit#138 is properly solved.\nThe issue was fixed in asmjit, so you can revert the hack once you update the asmjit version.\n. Seems to be fixed now. @torusrxxx thanks! Please claim your bounty :). @torusrxxx actually, there's one little thing that's missing: if you follow a jump or a call, and click on '-', you don't go back to the jump or the call (as in the regular CPU view), but to a previous, unrelevant command in the graph. I can create a video if my description is not clear.. Great, thanks! It would be also great to have support disassembly history in graph. I tried to put a small bounty on it on bountysource.com, but for some reason I couldn't find the issue.. As far as I understand, it returns the address to set the breakpoint on.\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/58825d4522f06986e09ab17b141204a66e68dd15/src/gui/Src/Gui/BreakpointMenu.h#L12. > Should I make a pull request for this?\nYeah, why not... I could do it too, but I don't have a development environment for x64dbg, so I won't be able to verify the change.\nAbout the feature in general, first of all thanks :) I used it a bit, and there are two downsides compared to the original mode that I noticed:\n\nWhen you zoom out to overview (Shift+Z) you can't know where you came from. In the original mode there's the square that indicates the location.\nZooming out and moving around the graph is slow when the text is visible but scaled down.

Gets RTTI information for a selection of dwords in the dump/stack/ or in a register\nI'm sure you're familiar, but I consulted this for how to get the RTTI object name: http://blog.quarkslab.com/visual-c-rtti-inspection.html\n\nThis is super handy if an exe has been compiled with RTTI, the plugin will spit out all the RTTI information of the class name in the log and autolabel the addresses as well if you want it to.  Although, there's a small problem with it as seen at ebp.\nIn Olly you could create a t_memory structure and access t_memory->type to check if it was in a specific segment.\nFollowup question: How can I check if an address is in a specific segment?  :)\n2.\nThe plugin makes available a hotkey press to automate the action \"Follow in Dump\".  I'm constantly following dwords in the dump to see if they're ptrs to objects I'm looking for.  (I do this maybe 200 times a session).  Right-clicking the stack and selecting my plugin's hMenu then doing \"Follow in Dump\" is tiresome which is why I want the last active \"Focus window\" so I can GuiGetSelection() on the correct window to know what I clicked on, currently without a separate hotkey for the dump, this is impossible.\nAlso, Olly's plugin interface included a shortcut key exposed function that made it really easy to register hotkeys with olly plugins.  I'm using CBWINEVENTGLOBAL to do all of my GetAsyncKeyState's for my hotkeys, is there a better way?  \nThanks for reading.  Cheers!\n. Yes @codecat if you email me I'll send them to you.  Eventually when I clean up the code I'll post it publicly.  . Thanks @mrexodia you're awesome.  Also, the Favorites menu that allowed me to bind keyboard shortcuts to commands fixed the other question I had in this thread.  :D. @mrexodia Hey Exodia, I see I completely missed your message from over a year ago.  Jesus.  \nWhat I was writing at this time was a plugin so I could select a dword in dump and press CTRL+G to do \"Follow dword in dump\", it's clearly functionality we do a lot and I wanted just to hotkey it.  \nI ended up accomplishing this with a CBGLOBALWINEVENT (I believe this is what it was) so I could detect the hotkey.\nIs the api plugin-hotkey example documented?  I'll grab the latest plugin full sdk and take a look.  \nI'll cleanup the RTTI code (which is messy as hell because of the need to use DbgMemRead (or a function named similarly) and have to read fields and pointers off explicitly rather than just casting it as something like a \nRTTI_t* pRtti;\nI couldn't find another way around it, just reading single values using DbgMemRead() and putting it in a struct manually (really ugly looking code).\nIf you're still on telegram, I'll drop by there for clarity on these things.\nThanks a ton,\nMoon. Nope, I'm blind.  Thank you.\n.

The number of tabs is set to be 5, can be increased or an option could be added to settings to decide how many dump tabs to show.\n. The problem is that you set the Trap flag before calling the hardware callback and if the user deleted breakpoint and the callback returns, the trap flag is still set but debug registers are cleared which makes it think the debuggee throws the exception\n. As there is already this option in the bottom status bar when there is a selection in dump window, how about having it show the content of where the Pointer is pointing when hovering over a pointer ? \n. Both are working here, but imo having to press ctrl + backspace is not intuitive, and not really that convenient.\n. Found the fix, internally the breakpoint is reset everytime it's hit, and in the reset if, it does this : \nif(ResetBPX == true)\n// Reset SW BPX Code \nelse if(ResetHwBPX == true)\n// Reset HW BPX Code\nelse if(ResetMemBPX == true)\n// Reset MEM BPX Code\nwhen it should be 3 If, so it sets back all breakpoints, not only one of them\n.

There is no more need to explicitely call repaints, so it's almost like before (except the calls to update instead of repaint() on the viewport which makes it faster than before), so it should be fine now.

Would be able to narrow it down to x64dbg or a plugin resource exhaustion issue perhaps.\n. \nIve a plugin called APIInfo that does a basic version of the above - mainly just some api calls and the parameters - (no values of paramters tho) -  only for 32bit x64dbg at the mo. Maybe that will help you for the time being: https://bitbucket.org/mrfearless/x64dbg-plugin-sdk-for-masm/downloads/APIInfo.dp32\n. Could be a shell extension issue, maybe one takes longer than normal to load up, causing a hang in the explorer part, which in turn causes x64dbg to freak out. Could be worth checking out what extensions are installed with ShellExView: http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html - i recall having a problem with a mkv shell extension years ago that caused explorer to hang/crash regardless of file i clicked on. Once i disabled it, all worked fine. Maybe load ShellExView up, disable a few, see if that helps, try an few more disabled then try again etc etc. Only other thing it might be is low disk space.\n. If its the currently selected rows or row, is it possible to get the coords of the left most column relative to screen, and then a getwindowrect for the selected highlight (the grey bar), enumerate that for all selected rows adding the rect.bottom to the previous result till you have the area to 'grab' - if that possible then you might be able to get the dc for the main window and create a compatible bitmap and bitblt that into the new in memory bitmap - then once you have that you could export it as a bmp at least. Or use an open source lib to generate a png from the captured in memory bitmap. Maybe?\n. I downloaded the snapshot and tried the same - file->open, and x64dbg.exe does crash for me as well. It seems to have created the minidump folder and filled it with dump files.\nx32dbg.exe seems to work fine. \nI then checked the version i had installed (in another location) and the x64dbg.exe from Jan 19th also crashes and fills the mindump folder with dump files\n\n. I done some searching and think this might related to an issue with QFileDialog getopenfilename with windows 7 x64, i tried disabling all shell extensions with nirsoft's ShellExView, just to be sure its not an issue with a shell extension, but still same issue with x64dbg.exe. I might try it in a bare bones vm of win7 x64, see if it helps me figure out if its to do with some software installed on my machine.\n. I take it that the might not work on certain machines is related to this: Exceptions that are thrown from an application that runs in a 64-bit version of Windows are ignored (https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/976038)\n. Pr00bit, I compiled the latest development release last night from Nukem9's commit and checked the file open on x64dbg.exe - it is working. The latest snapshot has this fix: https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/releases/download/snapshot/snapshot_2016-02-16_10-56.7z\n. Im guessing its related to the Visual C++ Runtimes. Probably need to re-download and re-install them: Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 (VC++ 12.0) https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784\nIt should come with both 32 and 64bit versions, both need to be installed if your on a 64bit os if you are going to use x64dbg.exe (and/or the 32bit version for x32dbg.exe, which you say is working anyhow)\nOnly other link i found that is kindof related is this one (referring to older vc++ runtimes), but the method to install is still valid, and you might have to try this approach if your vc++12 (= vs2013) runtimes arent installed correctly: http://www.bitdefender.com/support/how-to-solve-error-message-%22the-application-was-unable-to-start-correctly-%280x000007b%29-click-ok-to-close-the-application%22-1106.html\n. Also if you adding in this to the x96dbg.exe, maybe also add in an Icon string under the 'Debug With x64dbg' shell command:\nexefile->shell->Debug with x64dbg\nIcon REG_SZ \"M:\\x64dbg\\x96dbg.exe\",0\nWhich is like this in regedit:\n\nThen when a user right clicks on an exe or dll in explorer they see the x96dbg icon in the menu item:\n\n. Here is the crash eventlog info:\nFaulting application name: x32dbg.exe, version: 0.0.2.5, time stamp: 0x56c39a02\nFaulting module name: x32dbg.dll, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x56c39a47\nException code: 0xc0000409\nFault offset: 0x0006b420\nFaulting process id: 0x748\nFaulting application start time: 0x01d16cf4c0a0e445\nFaulting application path: M:\\x64dbg\\x32\\x32dbg.exe\nFaulting module path: M:\\x64dbg\\x32\\x32dbg.dll\nReport Id: ff963f91-d8e7-11e5-81c1-08626648b163\n. Decided to see what each structure item is as it was being loaded for the plugin, noticed the hwndDlg isnt consistent. Menu handles seem consistent up to MenuTest3 showing appropriate increment for hMenuDisasm, hMenuDump and hMenuStack, from MenuTest4, only the hMenuDump and hMenuStack seem correct, and MenuTest5 none are correct (except hwndDlg?) and causes crash.\nNot sure why hwndDlg would change as its just getting this from GuiGetWindowHandle()\n\n. Problem fixed. I created 5 x plugins via visual studio to test and it worked with them, so realised problem was with my sdk / code. After checking some code, realised that the pluginit, plugstop and plugsetup prototypes were not defined as 'C', was using STDCALL. Changed that and recompiled all test plugins and other plugins and seen issue was fixed. Updated my SDK to reflect newest snapshot release and those fixes for my code: https://bitbucket.org/mrfearless/x64dbg-plugin-sdk-for-masm\n. User genuine asked me try adding #define UNICODE at top of file and recompile. Seemed to compile fine and new x96dbg.exe was made.\n. There is a refresh option already - F5 to refresh or right click on process listview for menu that shows refresh. But maybe a button saying \"Refresh Process List\" (maybe bottom left on dialog) would help to highlight this option.\n. uservar = addr[ess] [dump] [stack] [disasm]\n(defaulting to disasm if empty)\nso basically a command that has optionally one parameter, that can be assigned to a user defined variable\nOr if only looking to define variables then perhaps:\n'addr' for selected disasm address\n'stack' for selected stack address\n'dump' is already a command, so something else for that, maybe 'hexdump' or prefix all three with a specific identifier: #addr, #stack, #dump or @addr, @stack, @dump\n. how about some type of alias option, that you can change the represented module name to a friendly alias (and it propagates the changes in the cpu display window to show alias instead) and that when you hover over with a mouse shows in a tooltip the full name of the module?\n. Attached is a sample exe compiled with debug information and pdb file (and WinBif.asm) included.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/3lfvqso16n4x8i7/WinBif_with_pdb.rar?dl=0\nThis is from the may 16th snapshot:\n\nAnd this from the 24th snapshot:\n\nBoth using the same exe and pdb file. If i leave the WinBif.asm (source file) in x32 folder, them it works opening and debugging the exe from any location.\n. Might be the linker is set to use /DEBUG:FASTLINK, which i think will create obj files differently, that are only usable from within visual studio, and as such the pdb files would likely be different perhaps. Otherwise the pdb file is corrupt or not in the current folder where the exe is.\nAlso I too miss the source code view. I know there was a lot of work done to implement msdia for symbols (instead of using the older dbghelp), and that meant the source code view would have to wait to be re-introduced with the all the changes it would require to handle the symbols as processed from msdia. All good things come to those that wait :). Wonder if its possible to use minhook or something similar to redirect that SymGetLineFromAddrW64 to a better version that doesnt lag - could be worth looking at how wine or reactos or something else implements it: https://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-patches/2006-May/026451.html. Off the top of my head only thing i can think off is if someone clicked on symbols tab and clicked a module and started searching for symbol names whilst a background thread was still processing and caching and the background thread was delayed for some reason (bug/searching etc?). Sounds like one of my older plugins. I had a plugin called APIComments that was an early version of what is now called APIInfo plugin. Ive since updated the plugins and the code i used to create them as the earlier version had a few errors. If it is this plugin i would suggest deleting it and download the APIInfo one to see if that helps: https://bitbucket.org/mrfearless/x64dbg-plugin-sdk-for-masm/downloads\n. Could do this with a plugin, via CBSYSTEMBREAKPOINT and CBATTACH call _plugin_startscript for script 'registered' to a specific exe. Or would it be better to integrate this functionality directly into the x64dbg codebase?\n. I could adjust an existing plugin i have to do this i think, but if its something to integrate directly into code there is probably no point in me doing that. Ill wait and see what direction this might go before doing anything.\n. So i started creating a plugin to do this, but ran into a few small issues.\nI have a test script located at: M:\\x64dbg\\scripts\\test.txt\nIf i load a file to debug and use the command bar to use:\nscriptload \"M:\\x64dbg\\scripts\\test.txt\"\nIt loads the script fine.\nWhen using the plugin i use the following code (after detecting if it matches a module that has a script associated to be auto executed - info is stored in an ini file for the plugin):\nInvoke DbgScriptLoad, Addr szNewScriptFilename\nszNewScriptFilename contains the string \"M:\\x64dbg\\scripts\\test.txt\" (without quotes)\nOn an older codebase build i got CreateFile error - now that the code is using the filehelper.cpp i get the FileHelper::ReadAllText failed... message (ive downloaded and compiled from the most recent commit)\nI modified the simplescript.cpp like so to check the string i was passing is correct:\n```\nstatic bool scriptcreatelinemap(const char* filename)\n{\nchar message[256] = \"\";\nsprintf(message, \"FileHelper::ReadAllText... %s \", filename);\nGuiScriptError(0, message);\n\nString filedata;\nif(!FileHelper::ReadAllText(filename, filedata))\n{\n    char message[256] = \"\";\n    sprintf(message, \"FileHelper::ReadAllText failed... %s \", filename);\n    GuiScriptError(0, message);\n    //GuiScriptError(0, \"FileHelper::ReadAllText failed...\");\n    return false;\n}\n\n```\nSo i get a messagebox beforehand (using commandbar or via plugin) to verify filename is same as the test string: \"M:\\x64dbg\\scripts\\test.txt\"\ncommandbar version works, but plugin then comes back with the FileHelper::ReadAllText failed message (i modified it slightly as well just to verify string is correct as well)\nI also get an error if trying to call Invoke DbgScriptRun, 0 - error says Debugger must be paused to run a script!\nI tried using the _plugin_debugpause function but that does pause the debugger and wont continue with the other commands in the plugin if issued before DbgScriptLoad and/or DbgScriptRun\nSo im not sure why the CreateFile is failing to open the file. Unless it is to do with a thread that should be running (or not running) for the scriptload (DbgScriptLoad) to work.\nI can upload the test plugin source and binary if required.\n. Yes I thought that as well.\n. Might be handy to also expose certain default paths for plugins (and/or scripts) to use:\nCould be default variables obtained via a function call or a structure passed back or something like that?\nx64dbg_ini - stores a path to x32dbg.ini/x64dbg.ini for example m:\\x64dbg\\x32\\x32dbg.ini\nx64dbg_root_folder - stores path to root folder containing exe - m:\\x64dbg\\x64\\\nx64dbg_plugins_folder - stores path to plugins folder: m:\\x64dbg\\x32\\plugins\\\nx64dbg_db_folder - stores path to db folder: m:\\x64dbg\\x64\\db\\\nMaybe a _plugin_getpaths function that returns a structure with the path information populated for some locations that might be required.\n.

Probably have to define the format it is required in, fields required, what to name them etc, and group by module: user32.dll, kernel32.dll perhaps?\nmaybe something like:\n{\n    \"Module\": \"User32.dll\",\n    \"API\": [\n      {\n        \"Name\": \"SendMessageA\",\n        \"Parameters\": 4,\n        \"1\": \"HWND hWnd\",\n        \"2\": \"UINT Msg\",\n        \"3\": \"WPARAM wParam\",\n        \"4\": \"LPARAM lParam\",\n        \"ApiString\": \"SendMessageA(HWND hWnd, UINT Msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"Name\": \"SendMessageW\",\n        \"Parameters\": 4,\n        \"1\": \"HWND hWnd\",\n        \"2\": \"UINT Msg\",\n        \"3\": \"WPARAM wParam\",\n        \"4\": \"LPARAM lParam\",\n        \"ApiString\": \"SendMessageW(HWND hWnd, UINT Msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);\"\n      },\n    ]\n}\nI had a tool i created for my APIInfo plugin that converted win8.1 SDK files to individual .ini files, grouped by module name (user32.api, kernel32.api etc etc) and outputted them like so:\n[SendMessageA]\n1=HWND hWnd\n2=UINT Msg\n3=WPARAM wParam\n4=LPARAM lParam\nParamCount=4\n@=SendMessageA(HWND hWnd, UINT Msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);\n[SendMessageW]\n1=HWND hWnd\n2=UINT Msg\n3=WPARAM wParam\n4=LPARAM lParam\nParamCount=4\n@=SendMessageW(HWND hWnd, UINT Msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);\nIf i know the format required i could convert these over to a JSON format for use.\n. I had a similar issue with x64 debugging and found the issue was with Actual Windows Manager - which always seemed to load a aimemb64.dll into the target process regardless of exclusions etc. \nI would get an exception error when it was just about to create a dialog (CreateDialogParamIndirect would always throw up the exception and the call stack showed a return from a aimemb64 module) \nOnce i quit running that utility (for purposes of debugging x64 programs) it solved the issue. \nSo as mrexodia has said disable any tools and utilities that may have hooks that might be interfering. \nOne way to figure out which tool/utility/program is causing the issue, is to have a look at the modules loaded for the program you are debugging via process explorer / process hacker (run it without debugging first) - look for any third party dlls and take note of them. Close down those third party utilities, stop the services/drivers that are related to those dll's if possible, and see if that helps you in a process of elimination to figure out the culprit.\nTools like msconfig and autoruns by system internals could be useful to see what programs and tools are running on your system and to disable them from running at startup - which might help you as well. \nHope that helps or points you in the right direction\n. Currently looking for something similar. \nThe existing functions pluginload, loads all plugins, and the pluginunload unloads them all. \nIdeally there might be a few additional function, or rename of the existing ones: pluginload -> pluginloadall (or pluginsload), pluginunload -> pluginunloadall (or pluginsunload), thereby allowing for pluginload and pluginunload to be for a single plugin - parameter for the unload function could be the plugin handle. Parameter for loading the plugin.dp32/dp64 filename?\nPlus probably need a plugin enumerate function, to loop through plugins, get handles, and plugin.dp32/dp64 filenames and possible plugin name string etc etc.\nI was looking at the possibility of extracting xdbgpy update from the zip into the folders, but if the plugin (and other files related to it) are in use, then access is denied. If i can get the handle of the xdbgpy plugin, i could unload it, extract zip overwriting existing x64dbgpy plugin and its files, then load up the plugin again. \nAnyhow its food for thought.\n. Some example code (poorly written by me) but to give an idea of what these extra functions might be: http://pastebin.com/ppNcCSPM\n. Noticed an issue with plugload, if you type plugload and press enter (without specifying a plugin name) it shows that it cant find x.dp32, where x can be a random letter or non-printable character each time the command is entered on the command bar:\n\n. Exception Code 0xE06D7363\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/185294\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100730-00/?p=13273\nI suppose the obvious stuff could be checked to see if its affecting the closing and crashing of x64dbg:\n- anti-virus or other third party programs using hooks that might be causing the crashes?\n- disable plugins to see if one of them is the issue - move them to another folder temporarily\n- should have generated a dump file, stored in the x32\\x64 / minidump folder - which might have more info on the crash. Or maybe system crash dumps might be located in the dump folder (folder value is stored here: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows Error Reporting\\LocalDumps)\n. Ive a plugin that might help, but cant guarantee it will:\nhttps://github.com/mrfearless/AutoCmdLine-Plugin-x86\nhttps://github.com/mrfearless/AutoCmdLine-Plugin-x64\n. Probably be useful to create a hidden tool popup dialog/window, that is shown when the mouse is over the call/jmp and hidden again when it is moved away.\nPossibly create it with an instance of your cpu window grid listview thing, which will have address, instructions etc. \nPlus an arrow top or bottom to show where this code is (above or below) in relation to where we are now. Also another possible feature to add to this is mousewheel up/down increases or decrease this 'tooltip' dialog height (from a default size) to show or hide more disassembly.\n. PLUG_CB_INITDEBUG has a szFileName field - the name of the file being debugged.\nFor getting a module base you could try something like\ncpp\n    duint entry = GetContextData(UE_CIP);\n    char modname[MAX_MODULE_SIZE] = \"\";\n    DbgGetModuleAt(entry, modname);\n    duint base = DbgModBaseFromName(modname)\nMy c coding isnt great, so some of that might be off slightly, in assembler x86 (which i use) it is:\nnasm\n    Invoke GetContextData, UE_CIP\n    mov entry, eax\n    Invoke DbgGetModuleAt, entry, Addr modname\n    Invoke DbgModBaseFromName, Addr modname\n    mov base, eax\nGetContextData is defined in TitanEngine.h which is included in the pluginsdk folder.\nor you could try via the DbgFunctions ModNameFromAddr call:\ncpp\n    duint base;\n    char modname[MAX_MODULE_SIZE] = \"\";\n    DbgFunctions()->ModNameFromAddr(sel.start, modname, true);\n    base = DbgFunctions()->ModBaseFromName(modname);\nTo get current address (from cpu view) you can use GuiSelectionGet\ncpp\n    SELECTIONDATA sel;\n    GuiSelectionGet(GUI_DISASSEMBLY, &sel);\nAgain apologies if my c coding isn't correct, but hopefully it will point you in the right direction\n. Yes true, an export option might be more practical then - export to originalfilename_patched.ext ?\n. Yes, although i didnt notice that option before, could be an option to still have a prominent menu item for exporting - which can go straight to the patch file save as dialog option, bypassing the patch dialog entirely and just showing file save as dialog.\n. Already in x64dbg under patches\n. Thank you. I'll hopefully get a chance to look at it Sunday onwards when I'm free.\n. Somewhat related to #917 and a plugin im developing, that will be able to save screenshots to png, jpg or bmp for cpu disasm or whichever tab view is active - including graph\n. Could use the extra space beside the dump for something like the checksum option that hex workshop has for checksums\n\n\nAnd could be an option to outsource that stuff to a plugin, which if loaded calls a function to display this 'extra' widget beside the dump for this purpose, adding in right click menus to generate checksums / crypto hashes for selection/entire file, which are then shown on the right in the new 'crypto' widget.\n. Same thing would occur when debugging a program that I've recompiled during testing, mainly because the bytes would change - due to additions I've made to the code or commenting out code before recompiling. \nI would just delete the db for the particular file as well\n. ok\n. Also a list of programs running in memory might be useful to see if any are injecting their own .dlls - anti-virus or multi-monitor support programs for example.. I get a SEC_ERROR_EXPIRED_CERTIFICATE when trying to download the sample. Press F9 to run from system breakpoint. Of if that doesnt work, uncheck the system breakpoint checkbox in Options->Preferences->Events. Check the Entry breakpoint at least.\nProbably worth checking the TLS Callbacks checkbox for this exe as it uses them - as evidenced with viewing it in CFF Explorer and x32dbg will break on the TLS callback as well if this option is checked.\nI can get to entry break point ok (if break on system breakpoint isnt checked) and/or the TLS function (if TLS Callbacks is checked). I'm using windows 7 64bit and it didn't appear to be hung and the ui wasn't locked for me.. Maybe some icon like:  or \nlarger icon (32x32): . No plugins needed, you can change bytes directly to try out commands, either by directly editing the raw bytes or by using assembler commands. Here is an example with editing directly binary, changing a JNE (x075) instruction to a JMP (0xEB) one :\n\nHere is using the assemble option (press space to assemble or choose menu item assemble) to change JNE to JMP:\n\n. Click on the msvbvm60.dll in the left column to show symbols for that dll\nYou can use this plugin: https://github.com/ThunderCls/xAnalyzer to show function parameters. Yes it does appear to hang or crash if used in pluginit or plugsetup. If used in the CBINITDEBUG callback it works ok, which makes sense as DbgGetProcessId will return the process id of the target app being debugged, whereas with pluginit and plugsetup there isnt a target process initiated yet.. what folder is x64dbg being executed from? and where are you dumping the .bin file to? and what OS are you using? any AV products? could be OS or AV preventing writing. Also when you downloaded the snapshot was it unblocked (right click, properties, unblock file that was downloaded from internet). Not sure if its possible with the qt widgets, but maybe flash the border of the dump, alternate colors red-black-red-black for 1 second if follow dump=true, or the background of the dump tab itself (red background, white text / normal background, normal text). Company name info for #1787 but only for x64dbg (excluding x32gui.dll and x64gui.dll - not sure how to add version info to the Qt stuff) \nAlso other dll's belong to other open source like capstone.dll, yara etc - should we add meta info for them?\nI did add a version manifest to x32_bridge.dll and x64_bridge.dll (compatibilty dlls) but dont think they got added to the dependency @deps folder\nEdit: i see deps is a seperate repo, will add them to that. Is it in the x32\\plugins (x64\\plugins for .dp64) folder?\nHas it been unblocked from internet download (win7 shows an unblock button on right click->properties dialog with a msg \"this file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer\" - might be different settings for win10 or different way of handling this) . tried out the release, here is the issues or things I observed:\n\nCTRL+1 / CTRL+2 brings up popup window, if I release CTRL button it auto selects first selection.\nCTRL+ESC (keeping CTRL held down) does escape popup window but also brings up windows menu - so maybe losing focus is really the reason it closes without doing a selection.\nCTRL+2 on a line bring up popup window. Escape popup window without making selection. Select a new dump tab. CTRL+2 now shows popup window that is blank.\n\nMousewheel doesnt move selection bar up/down.\n. requires a few things for that, either:\n\n\nAuthor of plugin makes an update function in their own plugin\nor\n\nA standardized plugin update api with information supplied to plugin by plugin author:\nfull url to plugin version text file to compare version no with of plugin with plugin text file\nfull url to plugin's .dp32 / .dp64 file \n\nOther potential work required or issues to be addressed:\n For some plugins updating will require restart as opposed to the hot unload/load of them (depends on plugin)\n Some plugins may require additional files to be downloaded for them to work and be placed in specific folders (xAnalyzer for example would require the .api and .api.h files in the api_def folder) so a seperate zip or archive for downloading and logic to handle this plugin update might be necessary in some cases (depending on plugin).\n Plugin api has to take in account new plugin files (downloaded to a temp folder?) to copy into plugins folder\n Plugin api backup of older plugin files before replacing?\n* Security of plugins: signed and/or verified by someone?, hostile takeover/redirect of original plugin location and replaced with file names as plugin that is malware/randomsware/cryptominer/etc\nI think @mrexodia has a work in progress document related to this and future development of the plugin api in general\n. Plugins can receive callbacks for DLL load and unload (CBLOADDLL and CBUNLOADDLL), thread start and end (CBCREATETHREAD and CBEXITTHREAD) and system breakpoints (CBSYSTEMBREAKPOINT) for others events and for also a callback for debug string output (CBOUTPUTDEBUGSTRING). So possible to issue commands from within these callbacks using DbgCmdExec and DbgCmdExecDirect.\nThere isnt a way to tie a script to execute on specific events as far as i know, just globally and/or for start of debuggee (Options-Set Initialization Script). I wouldn't expect it to work with popup menus, just the plugins main menu entries. You can add similar menu items to the popup disasm menu for appearance, but not for hotkey usage as far as im aware.\nThe registered hotkey will then push a call to the plugin menu item, as if the user clicked that menu option, and will call the plugins CBMENUENTRY for processing as normal.\nOr optionally register some custom commands and allow user to specify the hotkey they wish with the favourites dialog (Favourites->Command tab-Add), specifying the command and the shortcut key to use - assuming it doesnt conflict with an existing key of course.. I remember mentioning this issue as well in telegram when i was looking at doing stuff with hashes, its a catch22, as the CBLOADDB and CBSAVEDB are only called if there is data already in the user database, but with no data in it, there is no way to get the json object to then later add data to it, or to read data - to compare for example.. Yes just copy the folder to another place. Run the x96dbg.exe and choose setup. ",
    "codygray": "I just grabbed the latest version of x64dbg, saw this strange option in settings, and clicked on the link. (I know, I know, what was I thinking?) Language like this has absolutely no place in a quality piece of software.\n\nTake as much offence as you like, but try to keep it nice. Comments like yours are destructive for the open source community and they are not welcome here.\n\nDuncan, I honestly don't understand your attitude here. You are accusing others of being not \"nice\" and \"destructive [to] the open source community\" (which may all be well and true; that is not the point), but then you turn around and put verbiage like \"cocksucker\" in a prominent place in your software's user interface. It is clearly not a cultural misunderstanding where you don't realize the term is offensive; you grant as much where you say that sdcode can \"take as much offence as [(s)he] likes\". Please understand that other people are likely to take offense just looking at your software, and that inserting these kinds of slurs is far more toxic for the open source community (or, indeed, any community) than some bickering on a bug-tracker forum.\nIf you want to state your case, and even argue for it vehemently with strong language, be my guest. It worked well for Linus; your mileage may vary. But please reconsider where you are drawing the line. If you are going to put the option into the UI, use neutral language. If you feel so strongly that it should not go there, then just exercise your discretion not to put it in.\n. ",

(to allow for easy MASM/NASM formatting)\nAnd notification if copying jumps which reach outside the selected region to be copied?. Resuming it instantly gets me to the next exception and finally after some of them it results the game to crash which doesnt happen if its not being debugged with x64dbg. (Also doesnt happen when debugging with cheat engine though).. 1. I am using only SwissArmyKnife Plugin mainly for finding addresses or functions with signatures.\n2. \n Stack, seems pretty empty tho. LOL\n3.  Logs window.\n4. I am not using any AV software, except microsofts windows defender. I noticed yesterday that when Team Viewer is running, it injects in any process a dll, but i made sure for now that this doesnt happen. So no, basically there should not be another process injecting any code into the games process.\nGame is free to play xD\nWhat i can do tho is, what i just noticed is, to install game on my laptop and try if it happens there too..

Be mindful of call conventions when you edit the function. I can't remember what call convention Borland C++ uses, which seems to be used in your case. I think its something to do with EAX. What if you do it wrong though and miss a spot? I don't know what version to use to edit a function. Or what assembler to use, or what disassembler to use to read it with.. Okay. Just seems like a not so thoughtful decision. \n\nHaving them in the proper order (like other debuggers) has the upside that you can use it for reference when switching single bits using the Binary Edit feature, looking at what's what on the stack after a PUSHA etc.. it works fine also if I open it with x64dbg instead of x32dbg..

Yes, it work as expected in single step. Also ida pro, ollydbg v1 and v2 show 0x82 op. in normal way.\n. For example: just try instuction via opcodes 82 3D 01 00 40 00 5A\n\nIt will work as expected, and compare 'Z' from 'MZ' sign in some classic 0x400000 image based exe\n. Yes, latest. This is very strange but I can't reproduce bug in same file and at same conditions. But believe me in previous test run labels placed only at 2nd attempt.\n. Scyllahide plugin are ok because nothing changed in settings between \"good\" snapshot and \"bad\".\nUnfortunately I can not give more information and all the other 99% of the targets work well as expected. I was trying to find all code changes for March but there are lot of changes in HWBP handling and I need time to understand what changed and what it means. If I find the reason for this bug I'll report it.\n. probably same issue as https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/988\n.

    "mrgreywater": "I propose that it should be compiled with the /MT flag which statically links the necessary msvc libraries. This way the requirement to install any Visual C++ Redistributable is gone. (This will result in a larger binary, but I don't really think anyone cares)\n. I always thought it was forbidden to distribute those individual Microsoft DLL's, but I guess I am wrong in this case. Adding the DLL's would be a good idea.\n. Debugged a little myself, the reason is that it only checks the page for PAGE_EXECUTE, but doesn't check for the flags PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE or PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY.\nReplace the Line 364 in stackinfo.cpp with \nreturn (pageInfo.mbi.Protect & (PAGE_EXECUTE | PAGE_EXECUTE_READ | PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE | PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY)) != 0; \nto fix it. I might can create a pull request, but it would be easier if somebody with repo right could push the fix themselves.\n. This will most likely also happen with VC12 with debug heap. Release mode will probably work in most cases, as the memory is deliberately initialized with values different from 0 in debug mode.\n. This line is removing the zero termination: https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/master/x64_dbg_dbg/memory.cpp#L436\nedit: Exerpt MSDN to strcpy_s: \n\nThe debug versions of these functions first fill the buffer with 0xFD. To disable this behavior, use _CrtSetDebugFillThreshold.\n\nThe memset at the beginning in the function therefore doesn't help in the debug build\nReplacing the linked line with \ncpp\nstrcpy_s(Rights + 4, RIGHTS_STRING_SIZE - 4, ((Protect & PAGE_GUARD) == PAGE_GUARD) ? \"G\" : \"-\");\nwould do it. (the memset could then be removed)\n. I checked it with both vc12 and vc14 in vs15, so it should be fine.\n. ",
    "wk-952": "I think i found the faulty modules,\nit is \"x32_dbg.dll\" and \"x64_dbg.dll\"\nafter replacing both with the ones included in \"snapshot_96\" at sourceforge\neverything magically worked without problems,\nno need to recompile jansson.dll in VS2013 (no crashes occur),\nBPs and comments are reserved after restarting / detaching the process and the\nerror message \"breakpoint reached not in list!\" is no longer displayed.\nI don't have experience in programming so i don't know exactly which part in the source\ncode that has changed since \"snapshot_96\" and caused this issue,\nalso the \"snapshot_2015-04-06_11-57\" which is the one exactly before the last snapshot at sourceforge has this issue too.\nI hope this helps\n. Thank you so much mrexodia,\nI've cloned and recompiled everything from the beginning (x64dbg and all its dependencies) in VS2013,\nand all the issues stated here are gone, i'm also now able to use my old database again.\nSo thank you again mrexodia and Nukem9.\nOne last thing i want to point out to, i couldn't compile TitanEngine in VS2013\nso i used the one from the latest snapshot at sourceforge,\n-when compiling as \"Release|Win32\" i get the error message:\n\" error C2039: 'Cr0NpxState' : is not a member of '_FLOATING_SAVE_AREA' \"\nin the file: Global.Engine.Context.cpp\nat lines: 96 and 194\nand the warning: \"warning C4996: 'GetVersionExW': was declared deprecated\"\nin the file: Global.Engine.Hider.cpp\nat line: 17\n-and when compiling as \"Release|x64\" i get the error message:\n\" error C1047: The object or library file 'scylla_wrapper_x64.lib' was created with an older compiler than other objects; rebuild old objects and libraries \"\nand the 2 warnings:\n1) \" warning C4530: C++ exception handler used, but unwind semantics are not enabled. Specify /EHsc \"\n   in the file: \\include\\xlocale\n   at line: 337\n2) the same warning about 'GetVersionExW' when compiling as win32\n. Oh i guess there is another problem...\nall plug-ins are no longer working (StaticAnalysis, ScyllaHide, OllyDumpEx_X64Dbg)\nexcept Scylla that comes pre-installed with the debugger\n. No words can describe my appreciation for all your work, thank you.\nI guess this issue can be closed now since everything is solved.\n. any updates concerning this issue?\n. This file contains a simple crackMe from Lena151's tutorials\nalong with the database file from x64dbg.\nPlease try to debug this application using the provided database file\nwith (snapshot_2015-04-17_03-42) from SourceForge and see if it will work for you.\nhttp://rghost.net/private/86jKWwRjL/99a8dc2eb9fa0fb005ffbef4d5e1e712\npassword: asd123zxc\n. I've downloaded and re-compiled the project and yes the issue is gone now,\nthank you very much.\n. i tried that now, i've removed all the plugins, the databases and my custom UI settings\n(colors and instructions spaces), so a completely clean installation,\nthen i loaded an application and placed a BP with a comment and tried again the restarting session,\nbut the same result :( after exactly 52 restarts the BP and the comment are gone,\nthis time the difference is that the debugger didn't crash,\nso before closing it i added another BP and a comment and restarted the process (restart # 53)\nand as i expected both the BP and the comment are gone.\ni've actually tried the last 2 steps multiple times (i reached restart # 64) to make sure that any BPs and comments after that will always be deleted, and unfortunately yes that happens.\nEDIT: another thing, i tried it now again and on restart # 52,\nafter the BP and the comment are gone, i kept restarting 4 or 5 more times, then i opened\nthe \"db\" folder and found the database file that corresponds to the application being\ndebugged still has all the information about the BP and the comment,\nso i closed the debugger but immediately the \".dd32\" file got deleted\n. I'll try it today or tomorrow with the build before the latest one from sourceforge (with and without plugins) to see if this issue was only introduced in the latest build or not.\nwish you all the luck in your exams.\nEDIT: unfortunately yes, it occurs with (snapshot_2015-05-08_04-36) too.\n. tried it now,\nand the issue is still persistent :(\n. reached restart attempt number 116 and no crashes happened :+1: \nbut may i ask, what freeze ?!\ni didn't have any freezes even after restart number 116 and when i closed the debugger it didn't hang\n. No, it was fixed, reached 77 restart attempts and there seems to be no problem.\nThank you very much, you can close this issue if you want.\n. i've compiled the project but after multiple\ncalculations unfortunately the same result :(\n\nProblem Event Name:    APPCRASH\n  Application Name: x32dbg.exe\n  Application Version:  0.0.2.5\n  Application Timestamp:    55725575\n  Fault Module Name:    StackHash_3dd6\n  Fault Module Version: 6.3.9600.17114\n  Fault Module Timestamp:   53648f36\n  Exception Code:   c0000374\n  Exception Offset: PCH_E5_FROM_ntdll+0x0003D2EC\n\nEDIT: another attempt using (snapshot_2015-05-25_12-07) :\n\nProblem Event Name: APPCRASH\n  Application Name: x32dbg.exe\n  Application Version:  0.0.2.5\n  Application Timestamp:    556507f5\n  Fault Module Name:    QtCore4.dll\n  Fault Module Version: 4.8.6.0\n  Fault Module Timestamp:   551407ff\n  Exception Code:   c0000005\n  Exception Offset: 000c9095\n  OS Version:   6.3.9600.2.0.0.256.4\n\nthis time the faulty module was \"QtCore4.dll\" !\ni think there is a fast way to reproduce this issue:\n1) after loading an application in the debugger open the calculator and\n    type: [esp + 2]\n2) start typing some random operations very fast after the [esp + 2] part,\n    for example: [esp + 2] then + 2 - a + c - 4 + 1 - 9 + b + c\nwithin 5 - 10 seconds the debugger will crash\n. ok, i've set x64dbg as the JIT debugger and loaded the application again,\nthen opened the calculator and only typed [esp]\nand immediately it crashed, so i selected \"Debug the program\" and x64dbg laoded\nup to debug itself.\nVery sorry to ask, but could you please tell me how to dump the callstack with symbols?\ni'll keep everything as it is until your response, thanks in advance.\n. ok :)\njust to be sure, the main thread should be selected right?\nEDIT:\nhttp://rghost.net/private/7MLslzpkQ/cbbd7d14d63d3c9f886a917c9c9a1e8b\n. sure of course, i'll do it now and reproduce the issue\nEDIT:\nby the way, i'm trying to debug this game to make the CPU player never win (never touch the ball) :)\nhttp://www.ragdollsoft.com/stealball/\n. Good !\nthis is another attempt with symbols (it took very long to reproduce)\nhttp://rghost.net/private/6vn29yGDH/93bcf6acf32315cfa14232dc6a0d8d63\n. :+1: \namazing!, thank you so much for your hard work\n. actually a new issue is introduced, now instead of crashing,\nthe calculator stops calculating expressions as shown in picture\n\n. i've just compiled the project,\nand the calculator is now unusable after the first session of operations.\nhow to reproduce this:\n1) load any application and open the calculator\n2) type any number of operations and close the calculator.\n3) open the calculator again for the second time\nit becomes completely unresponsive to your input,\nexactly as shown in the above picture\n. yep :)\nspent 15 minutes randomly typing expressions,\nwhile closing and opening the calculator and no crashes occurred.\nThank you so much.\n. after compiling the project with the latest commits,\nthe GOTO option doesn't seem to be working at all now.\n. Thank you very much\n. Call Stack table, got it by luck:\nhttp://rghost.net/private/6QVHCSk9P/d0c15be5fba914ac4679cd578ed5e3f4\nHere is also a screenshot of the disassembly window from the JIT debugger x64dbg:\n\n. still the same :(\n. ok, i found an easy way to debug x64dbg (why didn't i think of this earlier!)\ni opened x64dbg and loaded up a game with it (let's call it game debugger),\nthen i opened another instance of x64dbg and attached the game debugger (JIT debugger).\nAfter that everything was easy, at restart 18 exactly, the game debugger broke and the JIT debugger\nreported an access violation error, now it was easy to copy the call stack table, so here it is:\nhttp://rghost.net/private/7GdmZDrYT/bdb2ccc530fa9237922c6744fb210dc5\nand also a screenshot of the disassembly window from the JIT debugger at crash:\n\n. It now happens at restart number 74,\nalso now it doesn't only crash, but also the debugging data gets lost,\nand as mentioned in the first post, the files of ScyllaHide plugin could not be loaded,\nso the same effects as in issue #303.\nFor your convenience i removed the symbols folder and tried again, and i was able to restart the application 84 times with no problems,\nthen i restored the symbols folder and manually compiled the project after adding line # 726 from this commit da6b666 , and this time i reached restart # 100 with no errors or crashes while the symbols are present.\n. not exactly, but it's around this range [73, 76] so for me it's not hard to reproduce,\ni'll re-compile the project again with those latest 8 commits (the ones done about 3 hours ago)\nthen if it happened again i'll upload the callstack and the information thrown after crash if it's different.\nAbout the new crashdump feature, could you please tell me how should i do it ? so i can upload it as well with the callstack\nEDIT: and by the way thank you and Nukem and everyone involved for this amazing project\n. Okay, here is what happened in the past 2 hours:\n- First it's worth mentioning that now after crashing, no debugging data is lost.\n-Attempt 1:\nAfter 73 -74 restarts i got the error: \"MiniDumpWriteDump failed. Error: 2147942408\"\nhad to press ok about 6 times or more for that error.\nWhen the debugger crashed it didn't give me the chance to debug it (no \"Debug this application\" option), but the minidump folder wasn't empty! so i included that in the archive.\nEDIT: also in this attempt things got a little bit funky (pictures included in the archive).\n-Attempt 2:\nExactly as attempt 1, but this time after crash i had the option to debug the application (x64dbg),\nand wonder what happened when i pressed \"Debug this application\" ....\nas mentioned in the first post: \" x64dbg is loaded up to debug itself but it immediately says 'debugging stopped!' \", and again the minidump folder had some files in it (although \"MiniDumpWriteDump\" error occurred again).\n-Attempt 3:\nThis is the interesting one, i did what i mentioned in the 5th post to be able to catch the error when it happens so i can dump the callstack since this was the only way i could do it.\nThere was a problem here first:\n1- open the JIT debugger and the game debugger.\n2- attach the game debugger to the JIT debugger.\n3- load any game/app in the game debugger.\n4- you immediately get a dumping error: \"Failed to open file path 'xxx' while generating crash dump\" (where 'xxx' is the full path to the dump file).\nI guess because the JIT and the game debuggers (who's in fact x64dbg opened twice from the same location) are trying to access the same dump file, so i copied x64dbg (game dbg) to another location, this time when i reproduced the issue and the error occurred, the JIT dbg broke/paused and i could copy the stackcall table.\n- Between each attempt i removed the minidump folder to make sure it's a clean try with its own dumps.\n- In the last attempt the JIT dbg didn't give the \"MiniDumpWriteDump\" error, but the game dbg did.\n- OS: Windows 8.1 Enterprise 64-bit.\nhttp://rghost.net/private/7pTnsthrC/e2d97320247ea6b5de1bfb702f987cdd\npassword: asd123\n. I don't clone to my repository, i always download the master branch as a zip file\nhere's what i see in the crashdump.cpp.\nI'll upload later today all the symbols i have along with the build i recompiled.\n\n. oh crap!, ok no problem i'll do attempt 3 again (very sorry)\n. It's even worse, i didn't find any dump files in the JIT dbg, and the dump files in the game dbg were 0 byte files!, but anyway here is the callstack again with pics at crash time and at DumpWrite error:\nhttp://rghost.net/private/86VmCdQgh/40091aa4c335b0a422f2bd4bd30159f1\npassword: asd123\nThose are the symbols for x32 that i use:\nhttp://rghost.net/private/6S8RRL4L4/3440b5807168148b13236099c8c7fba0\n. i'll try it now and edit this post correspondingly.\nEDIT: yep :)\nreached 110 restarts with symbols present and no problems, i'll try later today more restart attempts but you can close this issue already if you want.\nThank you everyone so much.\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Thanks for the info, didn't know about that.\n. No i didn't mean that the commit itself was the problem,\nbut just to give you information about the build i used, sorry for any misunderstandings\ni caused.\n. i'll try to find a reliable reproduction steps later today (not home right now)\nbut i guess it happens every time whenever you debug an application.\nedit: sorry please see comment after update \n. You can debug x96dbg.exe\nthen select Search for -> String references\nand you can clearly see that the strings are eaten from the end\n- it doesn't have to be the last char, it could be the last 2 or 3 ones as seen in the OP pics\n\n. found it, this was introduced since commit: f041498\nbuilding with any previous commit is fine.\n. Thank you mrexodia\n. sorry if i'm not getting this right but their existence in the executable file is certain,\ni mean they have a consistent file offset and VA (at least in many cases),\nfor example in diablo2oo2's patcher you could explicitly define the file offset or the VA of the\nbyte and apply the required patch to it even if it's a null byte.\nCould their be for example a feature/option where you could apply a patch\nnot by its address but relative to another one ?\nso for example instead of the address of the null byte, it would be the address of the last\nvalid instruction + a certain offset, that way the debugger has a raw address representation + a user explicitly-defined offset.\n. sure, the following is just nonsense but to show the issue:\n1- degug x96dbg.exe, you should land at address 00802E64\n2- at the next instruction @ 00802E69 (which is a jmp) assemble the following:\nJMP 00803501  // 00803501 is the beginning of a null bytes sequence\n3- @ 00803501 assemble the following instructions:\nPUSH EAX\nPOP EAX\nJMP 00802E6E\n4- try to save the patches\n5- you'll get (2/10 patches applied!)\ni think this is a bug because i tried it on the first crackme from lena's tutorials\nand all the patches were applied\n. So you mean those null bytes could have physical existence and a certain disk offset (could be viewed with HxD) but not VA or vice versa ?\nIf so then please feel free to close here.\n. i've sent you an e-mail (the one at your profile page) with more details on this issue, please check it out.\n. This is going to be long, so please bear with me.\nI want to give you more details because i feel that i didn't give you enough\nhelpful information in my last e-mail and my previous post was nearly completely useless,\nalso because i found another issue in the 64-bit version of the debugger which i guess is related\nto the parser:\n1- First, please download this simple \"hello world\" application (source code and debugging data are\nof course included), if you want to compile it manually do a \"Debug|x64\" build:\nhttp://rghost.net/private/7szD5ZRzf/f257a2f116857734a7420603bba91396\npassword: asd123zxc\n2- Open the exe file with HxD (or any hex editor) and look at the disk offset: AB54,\nyou'll clearly see a sequence of null bytes. (this step is just to make sure\nthat they exist)\n3- Start debugging the exe file and reach the null-bytes sequence @ RVA: B754 (offset from image base), then assemble the following:\npush rax // opcode: 50\npop rax // opcode: 58\ntry to save the patches and it will fail.\n4- Again open the exe file with HxD and reach the disk offset AB54, then manually\ntype the opcodes: 50 58 and save.\n5- Debug the exe file and reach the null-bytes sequence again,\nthis time you can clearly see the instructions:\npush rax\npop rax\n- This of course applies to the 32-bit version of the debugger.\n- I've also included the patched exe file along with the original one\n. ... continued from above\nNow to the new bug:\n1- Again start debugging the exe file and reach the first line of the \"main()\" function,\nthat should be @ RVA: 23E0\nIf that doesn't help, here are the opcodes of the \"main()\" if you want to search for it as a pattern:\n{ 40 57 48 83 EC 20 48 8B FC B9 08 00 00 00 B8 CC CC CC CC F3 AB 48 8D 15 64 A6 00 00 48 8B 0D 1D FD 00 00 E8 06 ED FF FF 33 C0 48 83 C4 20 5F C3 }\n2- Now the 7th line/instruction (@ RVA: 23F5) should be:\nlea rdx, qword ptr ds:[7FF699A7CA60] // mov the address of \"Hello World \\n\" to RDX\nassemble the following on that line:\nmov qword ptr ds:[7FF7F672CA60], 0\nunfortunately what gets assembled is:\nmov qword ptr ds:[7FF7F672CA64], 0 // notice the increased 4 bytes\n3- So now we know that with the instruction 'mov qword ptr [address]' the address gets\nincreased by 4, let's assemble again but this time we'll remove 4 from the address:\nmov qword ptr ds:[7FF7F672CA5C], 0\nwhat gets assembled is:\nmov qword ptr ds:[7FF7F672CA60], 0\n- This also applies to other forms of 'mov xxx ptr [address]',\n  for example: 'mov byte ptr [address]' increases the address by 1\n- This does not apply to the 32-bit version of the debugger,\n  it's perfectly fine at this point.\n- Other instructions like the one mentioned earlier: 'lea , qword ptr [address]'\n  works fine, so it's somehow related to 'mov' instructions only, but of course i'm not sure\n  if there are any other instructions where this scenario would apply.\n. More info regarding this,\nwith the new implementation of File-offset <---> VA conversion, It seems that the debugger\ncould correctly convert the disk-offset of those null bytes to its corresponding VA and\nproperly follow that VA in the CPU/disassem. window using Ctrl + Shift + G (yaaay!)\nbut obviously not the opposite :( .\nPic:\n\nEDIT:\n- Notice how the VA that corresponds to the target file-offset is properly selected in the\n  CPU window.\n- Also notice how the conversion failed in the details window\n  (so i guess the conversion in the details window is VA --> file-offset ?)\n. I couldn't build TitanEngine on Visual Studio 2013 to try it out,\nif you have any free time, could you please release a build of it with the new fix ?\ni'm very passionate to try it out.\n. Working perfectly in x32 and x64.\nThank you so much for all your work.\n. This is solved, the only problem now is that when Keep Size is selected you have to highlight the chars you want to replace (overwrite mode is no automatically toggled) which could be simply solved by pressing Insert on the keyboard (manually toggle overwrite mode).\nThanks @Atvaark.\n. The menu item Copy -> RVA, along with displaying the RVA in the info box (can be copied also from there) are more than enough.\n\nThanks.\n. There is also a similar behavior in the pattern search window (actually in every \"Search for\" --> < option > ), it's only looking in the currently selected section.\nIf this issue here is solved I assume this behavior will be fixed in all parts of the debugger, right ?\nor is this totally different and I should create a new issue with it ?\n. Yes! please, if you can make such an option that would allow searching in multiple (or better all)\nsections, that would be a very great enhancement to the debugger.\nIf possible, could this be also implemented in all options of the \"Search for\" and\n\"Find references to\" menus ?\nPlease don't hesitate to implement this option, i really encourage you to do it.\n. @mrexodia since now you have the ability to search for anything in the current region (PE section), the whole module or even all modules, could you please implement searching in the whole module for references too?\nIt's currently the only option that supports searching in the current region only. Thanks in advance.\nEDIT: yes i do understand that it's nearly just a constant search, which itself (search for constant) is already available as an option in the whole module search menu.\n. Very nice, thanks :+1: \n. It does ignore spaces, see the leading spaces and the cursor at the end of the expression in those pics:\n\n\nevery expression parser in the debugger ignores spaces perfectly fine nearly everywhere.\n. Couldn't reproduce this again, not even on the application that triggered this issue.\nI'll re-open this when I find a proper way to reproduce it.\n. Seems to be solved :+1: .\n. It's the same issue of following/going to an address near the end of a PE section ( #243 and #401 ).\nIn the video he tried following a certain address in the dump window but it didn't scroll down properly, so I assume it's near the bottom.\n. If possible, could you also please add \"copy address\" (normal VA) in the dump window,\nit's already implemented in the disassem window but when selecting a certain byte in the dump window I can't copy it's address.\nSorry if this is already implemented.\n. About this address alignment mismatch, i face it more often too (also with olly),\nif by chance a call / jump instruction pointed to an address in the middle of a misaligned code\nand you stepped-in this instruction, the disassem window will be forced to display the correct\ncode/allignment, but once you scroll up/down the misaligned code will appear again.\nSo my question would be: is there any workaround for it ? anything we can do about it ?\ni've been roaming the internet since i was using olly (almost a year ago) for any brief\nexplanation/workaround, but my lack of knowledge didn't get me anywhere.\nYou don't have to answer this in details or anything, just a simple yes or no answer is\nfair enough for me, or if you could, please link me a website where i can start reading about it.\nI would be very grateful to you for any answer.\n. Also forgot to mention that when i built the whole project with Nukem9's fork ( with this commit: https://github.com/Nukem9/x64dbg/commit/e19196781cadb5fdb6e0f65b655a63625c0377da ), this issue was not present\n. Which snapshot do you mean ?\ni used the one on jenkins (snapshot_2015-10-28_05-28.7z)\n. I manually compiled Nukem's branch (just to test it and see what's fixed, since he didn't make the commits here) at the time this https://github.com/Nukem9/x64dbg/commit/e19196781cadb5fdb6e0f65b655a63625c0377da was the last commit made (using .lib files from here),\nand when i tested it against this issue, the debugger was working properly with no signs of wrong instruction-assembling/parsing.\nSo what i meant is that maybe you could merge his branch, since also he fixed the issue of the scrolling,\nso i suppose there are no extra work to be done (considering both issues) if you merged his branch or used his code.\n. Not 100% because as mentioned in the first post, this was an old issue (before switching to capstone) that i mentioned briefly in another issue and Nukem suggested that it's a XEDParse issue,\nbut it definitely became more messed up after capstone (previously problems 2 and 3 were not present).\n. i'm using this commit https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/commit/81377dd4b009262515782d32b3851ef5400b9fb0 (snapshot_2015-10-29_11-55) and issue 2 (parsing) is ~~partially solved since the analysis engine of the debugger is still analyzing the wrong address (check EDIT 4 below).~~\n(this is fixed now, see EDIT 6)\nAs for issue 1 (manual assembling) some instructions would be assembled correctly as:\nlea xxx, qword ptr [address] and mov xxx, qword ptr [address] (both will be assembled as expected)\nbut other instructions won't, like add qword ptr [address], xxx\n\nalso the above-mentioned 'mov' instruction would fail if the operands were swapped\ni.e the immediate-address pointer is the first arg of the instruction like mov qword ptr [address], xxx\n\nIssue 3 isn't solved, but i guess it's not a big deal or of importance as compared to the other 2.\nEDIT: i didn't try the last build of XEDParse that was released a couple of days ago, should i replace the current one with it and test again ?\n~~EDIT 2: oh wait, i didn't see this new commit to the debugger, i'll try with it now (i apologize very much)\nEDIT 3: aah, it's just an error message fix, i guess there is no need to re-build then :(\nalso about the new snapshot (snapshot_2015-11-07_04-08) is there anything new in it other than\nthe error message fix that i should try ?~~\n~~EDIT 4: also here's a pic of the above-mentioned wrong address analysis:\n~~\nEDIT 5: ~~yeaah, the same issues with the new snapshot (snapshot_2015-11-07_04-08).~~\non the other hand, congratulations on signing the release :+1: \nEDIT  6: after this commit https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/commit/a1ec3e75b185d904fe0dfd9ec54a834463999421 the analysis is fixed, so issue 2 is completely fixed :+1: \n. yep, noticed that issue 1 was a combination after the above tests,\none last thing i just noticed now,\nassembling mov <byte> ptr [address], xxx will add <1> to the address\nassembling mov <word> ptr [address], xxx will add <2> to the address\nassembling mov <dword>/<qword> ptr [address], xxx will add <4> to the address,\nwhile add/sub <byte>/<word>/<dword>/<qword> ptr [address], xxx will increase the address by 1\ni'm not sure if this would help in any way, but at least consider them in your tests\n. no, this is still not fixed\n\nEDIT: please check my previous comment (the one before Nukem's)\nif those instructions get assembled correctly, you can consider here solved.\n. Oh, right, i missed the point of keeping the results list in focus.\nSorry about that, i'll close here then since it's invalid.\n. Small update: this bug is related to TitanEngine as you mentioned, replacing it with GleeGug solves the problem.\nReproduced on snapshot 9/Nov/2016.\n. I might have some useful information regarding specifically the issue shown in this vid,\nactually i wanted to open an issue for this to point it out but wasn't sure about it.\nXEDParse is not actually the issue, it's perfectly fine at this point!\nSince - i guess - capstone commits or before that by just a little, you introduced some sort of a\nconfusion, the short description of it would be:\ninstructions with pointer-operands referencing the stack (dword ptr SS:[esp]), will always display SS as DS.\nSo instructions like this:\ncmp/mov/add dword ptr SS: [esp + xxx], xxx will always be displayed as:\ncmp/mov/add dword ptr DS: [esp + xxx], xxx, but in fact they're still using SS\nand this is where the confusion came from.\nMoreover, you decided to hide DS from the \"Assemble at ..\" window whenever it's used.\n*Explanation:\nIn the old build, the instruction was shown as:\nmov dword ptr SS:[ebp - 428], 0 (displays SS correctly as expected)\nso when he pressed space, the stack segment register SS was already typed in\nthe \"Assemble at...\" window   --->   no problem\nbut in the new build (after the confusion was introduced), the instruction was shown as:\nmov dword ptr DS:[ebp - 428], 0 (not displaying SS but it's actually using it)\nso this time when he pressed space, DS was being used (and of course hidden from\nthe \"Assemble at ...\" window), and he actually assembled the new instruction with DS\nwhile the original one was using SS (but not displaying it).\nThis is why the new instruction had a different size, and of course to compensate the difference\none byte from the next instruction was eaten and the rest of it was filled with NOPs\nYou can reproduce this very easily actually:\n1) Type something like: mov dword ptr SS:[esp - 20], 4,\n   It will be displayed as: mov dword ptr DS:[esp - 20], 4 (wrong)\n   and will have the opcode: C7 44 24 E0 04 00 00 00 (8 bytes)\n2) Type: mov dword ptr DS:[esp - 20], 4,\n   It will be displayed as: mov dword ptr DS:[esp - 20], 4 (correct)\n   and will have the opcode: 3E C7 44 24 E0 04 00 00 00 (9 bytes)\n- In the latest build, If you replaced the current version of XEDParse with a very old one\n  you'll still face this issue, that's why i told you above that it's not a XEDParse issue.\n. Ah, forgot to mention that if the referenced register was anything other than esp and ebp,\nDS and SS seems to be displaying correctly.\nAs a quick example, this: mov dword ptr SS: [eax + 5], 9 will display SS correctly.\n. I tried rebuilding in reverse order from the latest commit then going backwards,\nbut eventually gave up at 5e9a330 .\nThe last known commit that doesn't have this issue is 3de99ea and there are 4 commits between\nthe above mentioned 2 commits, so if none of this information is helpful i'll gladly continue building\nthe remaining 4 commits tomorrow to tell you which one specifically is the problem.\n. Just to clarify, i didn't mean holding or spam-pressing Ctrl + F2, i'm already aware of that issue\nsince a very long time ago (almost a year).\nThe above mentioned issue involves restarting the debugger instantaneously,\nbut this one is a little bit different, you have to stop the application at least once and when it's stopped\nyou can wait any amount of time you want, after that the next restart is guaranteed to crash the debugger.\n. Did you mean those 2 old issues ( #303 or #323 ), in which the debugger would crash after a certain\nnumber of restarts ?\nIf yes, then that's not what i meant, in this new issue you can restart as much as you want as long\nas the stop button (Alt + F2) is not pressed at least once (that's actually why i didn't notice it before,\nsince i always restarted the target application without having to stop/ terminate it).\n. This is fixed now :+1: \n. Solved, thanks Nukem.\n. In the old build i had, i didn't notice that it's not only a \"search for constant\" issue,\npretty much everything that involved the \"Edit\" dialogue box had this issue (for example changing registers), but now it's solved. Thanks :+1: .\n@Nukem9 yeah nearly 3-4 hours a day, i'm very interested in and love this project.\nOn the other hand, i seriously hope i'm not bothering you or @mrexodia that much, i'm really just trying to help.\n. Thank you so much! :+1: \n. Added more links to the first post\n@mrexodia\nI've sent you an e-mail with better details about this.\n. After building with the latest commit in development branch, the same scenario\nproduces another error :(\ninfo thrown after crash:\nProblem signature:\n  Problem Event Name:   BEX\n  Application Name: x32dbg.exe\n  Application Version:  0.0.2.5\n  Application Timestamp:    56716c20\n  Fault Module Name:    MSVCR120.dll\n  Fault Module Version: 12.0.21005.1\n  Fault Module Timestamp:   524f7ce6\n  Exception Offset: 000a46a9\n  Exception Code:   c0000409\n  Exception Data:   00000005\n  OS Version:   6.3.9600.2.0.0.256.4\nerror msg:\nLast chance exception on XXXXXXXX (C0000409, STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN)!\npic:\n\n. Can't re-open here due to permissions.\n. I've set the debugger to break on DLL entry and it seems to be crashing\nwhen loading chrome.exe, this is the log tab exactly on crash:\nTLS Callbacks: 1\n1 invalid TLS callback addresses...\nDLL Loaded: 06490000 C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\nMoreover, there seems to be a rare situation when breaking on DLL entry is enabled\nin which the CRT error message gets stuck in an infinite loop if the debugger crashed at dll loading.\nHere's a pic:\n\n(jeez! luckily i had the task manager opened in the background, otherwise it would've been a total mess)\n. yep, sorry for the delay, was uploading them:\nhttp://www78.zippyshare.com/v/FkgXiyO8/file.html\n. Solved :+1: \n. http://www89.zippyshare.com/v/33vinua4/file.html\n. If that might cause problems in the future, then there's no need to ignore these exceptions.\nIf generating the minidump files in the debugger location won't cause any problems,\nthen that would be fair enough, if not then please feel free to close here.\nSeriously, there's no need to to ignore these exceptions if that might cause any problems later,\nas i said in the first post it's not a big deal nor a critical thing, but just annoying by time,\nnothing more than that.\n. This is the minidump of the rare case in which if you selected the Desktop directly\n(without right-clicking), a minidump file will be generated.\nNote: This is reproduced with snapshot snapshot_2015-12-16_11-58.\nhttp://www46.zippyshare.com/v/jA5FG81w/file.html\nPlease, if ignoring exceptions from this one too might cause problems in the future, just ignore this post.\n. It seems that the default menu item was just changed from \"Selection\" to \"Function\",\nsince pressing Shift + F5 (which corresponds to \"Selection\") will have the proper desired effect in Snowman tab.\n. Yes, if you selected a block of instructions and then pressed Shift + F5, everything will work as expected.\nEDIT: just a gui problem i guess.\n. introduced on commit 087362d,\ndecompileMenu->addAction(makeShortcutAction(\"Selection\", SLOT(decompileSelectionSlot()), \"ActionDecompileSelection\"), [this](QMenu*)\n    {\n        return DbgFunctionGet(rvaToVa(getInitialSelection()), 0, 0);\n    });\n    decompileMenu->addAction(makeShortcutAction(\"Function\", SLOT(decompileFunctionSlot()), \"ActionDecompileFunction\"));\nshould be swapped like this i guess:\ndecompileMenu->addAction(makeShortcutAction(\"Selection\", SLOT(decompileSelectionSlot()), \"ActionDecompileSelection\"));\n    decompileMenu->addAction(makeShortcutAction(\"Function\", SLOT(decompileFunctionSlot()), \"ActionDecompileFunction\"), [this](QMenu*)\n    {\n        return DbgFunctionGet(rvaToVa(getInitialSelection()), 0, 0);\n    });\n. Another thing, if you searched for strings/patterns/calls, you also can't do anything (even closing the debugger) until it finishes (but at least switching to the CPU tab won't hang it),\nso i guess it's just how the debugger works and not a rare situation or anything.\nClosing here since i guess it's useless/invalid.\n. There is another problem here related to patched programs:\n-Case 1:\n1. Debug any program, then place a SW BP anywhere.\n2. Change the instruction on which the BP is placed (so that the original bytes get changed).\n3. Restart the application.\n4. The BP stays as it is (correct).\n-Case 2 (placing a BP after patching):\n1. Debug any program.\n2. Change any instruction then place a SW BP on it.\n3. Restart the application.\n4. The BP gets disabled (wrong).\nThis happens since of course the bytes after patching are the ones that get recorded,\nso on the next restart (when all the patches are lost) the original bytes are read and compared\nagainst the patch bytes ---> which will always be a mismatch.\nHere's when it gets really annoying, assume you have the application XXX.exe,\nyou've placed some SW BPs on that application, then after that you made some patches,\nand eventually saved it back to the file.\nIf you debugged the patched file, all your SW BPs will be disabled (case 2),\nI know you did this to eliminate errors, for example in case the application structure changed\n(because of a new version maybe) and the BPs become misplaced which will of course\ncause exceptions, but what about this situation ?\nEven if you recorded the original bytes before patching, the above-mentioned scenario\nof debugging the patched file will also fail\nEDIT: can't re-open here due to permissions\n. Well, honestly i can't think of a proper solution,\nbut if you could do the following, it may suit all the situations:\n-Solution 1:\n1) First thing try not to record the patch bytes, instead record the original ones, because chances of debugging the patched file is less than that of debugging the original one.\n(also if by mistake someone patched then added a BP, it will be disabled on the next restart)\n2) When the application is loaded, check all the BPs and flag the mismatched ones,\nif any mismatches found, then throw a warning to the user asking whether he likes to keep those\nBPs or disable them.\n- This way, at the end of the execution (when a stop signal is sent), there won't be any need\n  to check for bytes again i guess, and it will please everyone.\n- You can then make an option in the Misc.tab in the preferences to ignore mismatches\n  by default, so it won't be annoying for people who know that the application structure is the same.\n-Solution 2:\nJust get rid of this check!\nSeriously, was this needed ?!\nif you already knew the bad consequences of this check, why did you implement it ?\n. Thank you so much @Herz3h .\n. I tried 2 things, first using snapshot_2015-12-20_05-03 and it has this issue,\nthen i manually compiled the project with the latest commit in the development branch and\nit also has this issue too.\nAre there any other snapshots/builds that i missed ?\n. @Herz3h \nIt's solved after your commit, thanks.\nJust one last thing concerning the search textbox (not related to this issue),\ncould you please consider making it possible in the future so that highlighting a text then\npressing Backspace/Delete would actually delete it ?\n. Thank you, much appreciated.\n. also when building the project manually as \"Release|Win32\" you'll get this error:\nerror C3861: 'GetProcessDEPPolicy': identifier not found    \\src\\dbg\\assemble.cpp   164 1   x64_dbg_dbg\n. I guess there is a problem here:\ninstead of sbb eax, eax, i tried to assemble xor eax, eax and i got this message!\n\nusing snapshot_2016-01-07_01-41.7z\n@mrexodia sent you an e-mail with more details.\nEDIT: fixed after 2836108 , thanks\n. Totally forgot how the coloring works, sorry.\nNeeds more fixing:\n1. Do the steps from 1) till 4) again.\n2. The previously-deselected bytes won't be ticked (yaay!) \n3. Now close the patches window and re-open it again, guess what happens :smile: \nMerry Christmas to you btw and everyone here.\n. any chance you would add this coloring option to the dump window ?\n\n. Have you tried it on a single or dual core CPU ?\nWindows API calls are instantaneous, but for example extremely long call names like this\n(call to apphelp.dll):\ncall dword ptr ds:[<&unsigned int __stdcall DWM8AND16BitHook_GetPaletteEntries(struct HPALETTE__ *,unsigned int,unsigned int,struct tagPALETTEENTRY *)>]\nwould trigger this issue easily.\nThis seems to happen when Undecorate Symbol Names is selected,\nwhen i deselected this option it took nearly no time.\nOn the other hand, yea sub_xxx labels created when defining functions Shift + F are\nlisted too, thought that's a new feature xD\n. Not valid anymore.\n. Functions and labels removal has been implemented by xLCB plugin, I guess this could be closed now.. Yea sure, the qword memory address 1402ED1C0 contains the unicode string Key,\nthis string is properly displayed by the analysis in the comments section but in the details\nwindow it's not, so my suggestion was if you could implement this analysis in the details window.\nOddly in the second pic. when RAX and RBX were pointing to address 2FF870 which\ncontains the unicode string 555asdzxc#!@#, the analysis in the comments section\nas expected displayed it correctly, but also in the details window.\nSo now i'm not sure if the analysis in the details window is analyzing addresses in registers\nonly or it is it analyzing all addresses but for some weird reason it didn't do that in the 1st pic.\n. Oh never mind i'm dumb :+1: \nFound my mistake.\n. The address 1402ED1CO contains the bytes 790065004B (corresponds to unicode  K.e.y), so the analysis displayed this in the comments section:\n1402ED1CO:L\"Key\"\nbut the analysis in the details window displayed this:\nqword [1402ED1CO]=790065004B (no mention of L\"Key\")\nso I was asking if you could implement analysis in the details windows, but I totally forgot that the analysis is done on the result of the ptr as if it's an address itself, i.e. 790065004B\nand since those bytes are not the address of anything, nothing should be displayed.\n. No sorry, but i do have a very old build x64_dbg v0.24 (2-20) that doesn't seem\nto have this issue.\nEDIT: i'm downloading older snapshots to see when was this introduced.\n. Fixed, thank you very much.\n. So when the debugger hangs and can't be closed normally, all i have to do is generate a dump file from the taskmanager right ?\n@mrexodia as Nukem said, they should be uploaded privately, so could i just send you those dumps directly to your e-mail, or is there anywhere else to upload them privately ?\n. @mrexodia i would really appreciate any response from you to the above 2 questions please.\n. Yeah sure of course, from time to time while debugging i invoke the dbsave command.\nWhat i meant in the very first post is that the debugger will sometimes becomes completely unresponsive (you can't do anything except closing it from TaskManager).\nSo i was asking whether you can somehow make a thread (running in the background for example) that has one and only one purpose; if the debugger stayed in the hanging state for a certain period of time, it would throw a message to the user asking him whether he wants to generate minidump files with the necessary info and close the debugger, or not.\nA very close example to what am i talking about is in Cheat Engine, let's say you did an initial scan of type unknown initial value and you got millions of results, then to refine those results you searched for the 2nd time for unchanged value, if you attempted to cancel this 2nd scan, Cheat Engine may hang and becomes unresponsive.\nAt this point you get an option to force terminate the scan process so that Cheat Engine becomes responsive again.\nEDIT:\nJust to make myself clear, i'm not in any way trying to nag you about this, i just wanted to tell what was inside my head that seemed as a solution to me whenever this happened.\n. It works very fine!, thanks\n. Still the same.\n. Thanks a lot\n. Windows 8.1 Enterprise v6.3.9600 (64-bit).\nI've downloaded snapshot_2016-01-25_01-04.7z again just now and extracted it in a different\nlocation than the usual one i use, so it's a clean build without any plugins, custom settings or anything,\nand i can confirm to you this issue occurs.\n. Info thrown after crash:\nProblem signature:\n  Problem Event Name:   APPCRASH\n  Application Name: x32dbg.exe\n  Application Version:  0.0.2.5\n  Application Timestamp:    56c39a02\n  Fault Module Name:    capstone.dll\n  Fault Module Version: 0.0.0.0\n  Fault Module Timestamp:   56b0e11f\n  Exception Code:   c0000005\n  Exception Offset: 000a2c5b\n  OS Version:   6.3.9600.2.0.0.256.4\nsometimes the faulty module is ntdll.\npic:\n\nDump files:\nhttp://rghost.net/private/6Vpm25T4n/737e6e512cef5ceb38524df7ccf34616\nReproduced with latest snapshot.\n. Can't reproduce this anymore.\n. I managed to trigger this issue again today, but no as described in the first post.\nWhen it happened, i tried to close the debugger but it crashed and luckily generated a dump file.\nThe dump file:\nhttp://rgho.st/private/6gzyLcGrp/54373c183e97833ab4648235d0171328\npassword: asd123\n. Not yet actually, here's another way using the latest snapshot\n- Use a clean installation of the debugger, so everything is set to the default\n1. Debug x96dbg.exe\n2. You should land on the system breakpoint (log says System breakpoint reached!)\n   \n3. Select Options -> Preferences -> then select DLL Load\n4. Press F9 or Shift + F9, and you should land on a RET instruction,\n   (log says DLL Loaded: XXXXXXXX C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\imm32.dll).\n   \n5. Press stop\nAt this point the debugee won't stop, nor any input will be accepted, and you can only close it\n. This is insane, turns out the problem was some kind of conflict with Kaspersky,\nif Kaspersky is not loaded during account login (the protection is paused during OS boot-up), then everything is fine.\nBut if it's protection is resumed later on, then this issue occurs.\nIf it was again paused (or completely terminated), it won't matter, the issue will still be persistent.\n@mrexodia I guess this issue is somehow \"offtopic\" since it's not the debugger's fault, feel free to close here if you want.\n. #### Tested on the following OS-es:\n- Windows 8 Enterprise x64\n- Windows 8.1 Enterprise x64\n- Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB x64 (without Anniversary Update)\n- Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB x64 (with Anniversary Update)\nTested on the following Kaspersky products:\n\nKaspersky Internet Security (many versions, can't of course remember which, but it doesn't matter since this issue has been forever!)\nKaspersky Total Security v17.0.0.611(a)\nKaspersky modules/settings that needs to be turned on:\nI have no idea!, but i guess the default Kaspersky setup will do the job!. I'll setup a VM later and see if disabling/enabling certain components will make a difference and edit this post correspondingly.\n\nExact steps to reproduce this issue:\n\nThe issue seems to be only valid for x32dbg.exe (32-bit version of the debugger).\nMake sure Kaspersky is running.\nUse a clean installation of the debugger.\nOpen x32dbg.exe (no need to run as admin) then from the upper menu bar select Tools ---> Preferences\nIn the Events tab  select DLL Load and hit Save\n\nSelect File ---> Open (or just hit F3) and locate x96dbg.exe (should be in the root directory of the debugger)\nYou should land on the system function ntdll.RtlUserThreadStart (the log should say \"DLL Loaded: xxxxxxxx C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\ntdll.dll\")\n   \nPress F9 once to run the debugger (the log should say \"DLL Loaded: xxxxxxxx C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\kernel32.dll\")\nTry pressing Stop or Restart\nThe debugger will just do nothing!\n\nHow to workaround this issue:\nA. Disable Kaspersky's auto startup from the settings and pause the protection\n\n\nB. Restart the computer\nC. Again repeat steps from 1 - 6\nD. The debugger will Stop/Restart normally\n. another 2 examples:\ncmp dword ptr [eax], 0x1E00 ---> cmp dword ptr [eax], 0\ncmp dword ptr [eax], 0x1E0 ---> cmp dword ptr [eax], 0xFFFFFFE0\nEDIT:\nalso cmp dword ptr [eax], 0x1F00 ---> cmp dword ptr [eax], 0\nactually the immediates 1E??, 1F??, and  7??\nwill always be truncated to ?? until ?? = 7F,\nthen it flips to -ve values as shown in the 1st post.\nso: \ncmp dword ptr [eax], 0x1E00 ---> cmp dword ptr [eax], 0\ncmp dword ptr [eax], 0x1E01 ---> cmp dword ptr [eax], 1\ncmp dword ptr [eax], 0x1E7F ---> cmp dword ptr [eax], 7F\ncmp dword ptr [eax], 0x1E80 ---> cmp dword ptr [eax], FFFFFF80\ncmp dword ptr [eax], 0x1E99 ---> cmp dword ptr [eax], FFFFFF99\netc...\n. As of the introduction of Keystone, this issue is now related to XEDParse only.\n. Most of it is solved, but  the following cases are still failing:\ncmp dword ptr ds:[eax], 0x80 ---> cmp dword ptr ds:[eax], FFFFFF80\ncmp dword ptr ds:[eax], 0x8F ---> cmp dword ptr ds:[eax], FFFFFF8F\ncmp dword ptr ds:[eax], 0x90 ---> cmp dword ptr ds:[eax], FFFFFF90\ncmp dword ptr ds:[eax], 0x9F ---> cmp dword ptr ds:[eax], FFFFFF9F\nSo basically the whole range of 0x80 and 0x90 \n. Completely off-topic:\nCould you please add the new version of XEDParse to the future snapshots ?\nYou're still providing the old one with the immediate-address pointer issue.\n. Original post updated, some of the cases are solved.\n. Original post updated again, some of the cases are related to XEDParse only, while the others are related to Keystone only.\n. Did you mean that there will be future commits for this ?\nBecause i've tried version 1.0.26 of XEDParse just now and still the same.\n. I guess it's safe to close here now, since XEDParse's issue is solved.\nAs for Keystone this was already reported, i made a reference to this issue from there.\nThank you very much for all your work.\n. The Keystone issue was solved too if you want to update.\nJust a reminder for you.\n. I found a scenario to reliably reproduce this, but i know you're not gonna like it:\n1) Debug any application.\n2) Spam pressing Ctrl + F2\n3) When the debugger crashes / hangs, close it and re-open it again\n4) Load the same application, and you'll see that the db file is now gone!\n- Notice that this was not happening previously, spam-restarting the debugger was just crashing/freezing it, but now it additionally results in db save failure.\n- Also this is not how i reproduced this issue in the first place, as mentioned in the 1st post\n  it kept happening randomly, so the above steps just to show you a way to reproduce it\n  and not how i actually had this issue.\nPlease take a look at those 2 logs, captured after spam-restarting:\nNotice the failure of SymEnumerateModules64()\nA 64-bit application: 00007FF60C5CF740 = entrypoint\n```\n// ------------------- last 'normal' restart -------------------\nProcess stopped with exit code 0x0\nSaving database...109ms\nDebugging stopped!\n// ------------- spam-restarting began from here -------------\nDatabase file: E:\\Programs\\x64dbg\\x64\\db\\XXX.exe.dd64\nLoading commandline...\nDatabase file: E:\\Programs\\x64dbg\\x64\\db\\XXX.exe.dd64\nLoading commandline...\nProcess Started: 00007FF60BEE0000 D:\\Installed\\xxx_xxx\\XXX.exe\nLoading database...0ms\nProcess Started: 00007FF60BEE0000 D:\\Installed\\xxx_xxx\\XXX.exe\nLoading database...Breakpoint at 00007FF60C5CF740 set!\n16ms\nSaving database...SymEnumerateModules64 failed!        // <<<------ failure ---------\nMemRead failed on breakpoint address00007FF60C5CF5B6!  // <<<------ failure ---------\n93ms\nDebugging stopped!\nDatabase file: E:\\Programs\\x64dbg\\x64\\db\\XXX.exe.dd64\nDatabase file: E:\\Programs\\x64dbg\\x64\\db\\XXX.exe.dd64\nLoading commandline...\nLoading commandline...\nProcess Started: 00007FF60BEE0000 D:\\Installed\\xxx_xxx\\XXX.exe\nLoading database...Process Started: 00007FF60BEE0000 D:\\Installed\\xxx_xxx\\XXX.exe\n15ms\nLoading database...0ms\nBreakpoint at 00007FF60C5CF740 set!\nCould not set breakpoint 00007FF60C5CF5B6!

I haven't used the debugger thoroughly since that issue, just some very short debugging times (because of studying and exams).\nI was planning to start testing it again next week when I completely finish.\nI do have a request though, there seems to be a lot of fixes/features being implementation lately, when you do have a very stable snapshot, could you please leave me a note here during this week ?\nI don't want to test this issue on every snapshot being pushed everyday.\n. Notes for self.\nTest 1:  pass\n- snapshot used: snapshot_2016-06-03_10-27.7z,\n  corresponds to commit: cb05961 (GUI: fixed copy selection).\n- Time spent debugging: ~4.5 hours, continuous. (add at least 3 more hours to next ones).\n- Crashes: none.\n- Errors: 2; {note 2 (probably critical), note 4}.\n- Plugins: the usual except ScyllaHide (add it in the next ones).\n- Other notes: \n1. xref increases db file insanely (300 KB to 45 MB)\n2. multiple restarts (around 50-70) makes the debugger stuck at Thread XXXX created, Entry: XXXXXXXX.\n   Solution: restart once more or stop debugee (no crashes or errors).\n3. number of restarts: ~300 (inaccurate, actual number is much bigger).\n4. spamming Ctrl + F2 won't cause any corruption to the db file nor will it crash the debugger, but makes it stuck in a Running mode for the number of presses until they're consumed (consume this number by terminating/restarting the debugee).\n\nTest 2:  pass\n- snapshot used: same as above.\n- Time spent debugging: ~10 hours, non-continuous. \n- Crashes: none.\n- Errors: none.\n- Plugins: the usual.\n- Other notes: test DX games next time\n\nTest 3:  pass\n- snapshot used: same as above.\n- Time spent debugging: ~3 hours, continuous. \n- Crashes: none.\n- Errors: none.\n- Plugins: the usual.\n- Other notes: very short session, shouldn't be taken into consideration.\n\nTest 4 & 5:  pass\n- snapshot used: snapshot_2016-06-03_10-27.7z + snapshot_2016-06-10_03-48.7z.\n- Time spent debugging: > 10 hours, non-continuous;\n  ~8: snapshot_2016-06-03_10-27.7z + ~2: snapshot_2016-06-10_03-48.7z + ~4-5: in-between snapshots.\n- Crashes: none.\n- Errors: note 2 from Test 1.\n- Plugins: the usual.\n- Other notes: on snapshot_2016-06-10_03-48.7z, pausing isn't possible.\n  Solution: manually switch to main thread, even if it's selected.\n\nTest 6:  pass\n- snapshot used: snapshot_2016-06-10_03-48.7z.\n- Time spent debugging: ~8 hours, non-continuous.\n- Crashes: none.\n- Errors: cannot pause debugee.\n- Plugins: the usual.\n\n// Starting from 17 / 6 / 2016\nTest 7:  pass\n- snapshot used: snapshot_2016-06-15_02-16.7z.\n- Time spent debugging: ~10 hours, continuous (yaaay!).\n- Crashes: none.\n- Errors: crash after long time (invalid param. passed to CRT func.) but no db loss.\n- Plugins: the usual.\n\nTest 9-10-11-12:  pass\n- snapshot used: snapshot_2016-07-12_xx-xx.7z.\n- Time spent debugging: over 48 hours.\n- Crashes: none.\n- Errors: none.\n- Plugins: the usual.\n\nTest 13:  pass\n- snapshot used: snapshot_2017-01-04_03-16.7z.\n- Time spent debugging: 5 hours.\n- Crashes: none.\n- Errors: occasional \"Couldn't allocate memory\".\n- Plugins: the usual.\n. @mrexodia During the past 2 days, along with 2 of my friends, we were debugging various applications for a total of ~50 hours and no db corruption/loss occurred, also i tried the old game i mentioned in the 1st post and also no db corruption happened.\nStill, there are many tests that should be done.\nBefore we continue the tests, I do have a question please.\nSince this commit cb05961 GUI: fixed copy selection, was there any changes to the database handling ?\nor in other words, was there any commit made after this commit that could affect database handling directly or indirectly ?\nSorry if i'm nagging you a lot about this.\n. Cannot be reproduced anymore.\nWill re-open here if anything new comes up.\n. Probably related to https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/539#issuecomment-225508525, the instruction cmp dword ptr ds:[eax], 0xFB when assembled with XEDParse will produce this error\n\n. Similar to #539\n. If i'm not mistaken, what you're asking about is in the \"frequently asked questions\" section in the wiki, it's the first question.\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions\n. Ouch!, the link  to the file says: \"Not Found\"\ni guess it needs a re-upload.\n. All is good here too,\nsorry i wrote this yesterday quickly and rushed-off because i was already late for an appointment.\n. Alright, even though that contradicts with what he said above.\n. Thank you so much.\n. The reset button is now working and the hit command is executed when FastResume is enabled.\nThank you.\nI'll ask later on gitter about this new flag.\n. Sure, the hits counter is decimal and hence why I mentioned it here, its text box treats input as hexadecimal which is a little bit confusing.\nAs for the edit dialogue box, it makes no sense to reverse the bytes order because this specific dialogue box is used when editing registers not mem locations, mem locations have a different dialogue box.\nSo if I typed for example 0x33, the register's value will be 0x00000033\n. Easter Egg:\nWhen you extract the .7z file, there should be 2 folders: pluginsdk and release,\nrename the release folder to x64dbg v0.25_dev_build and the help file won't open !!!\nIn other words, if the root folder of the debugger (that contains the x96dbg.exe) is named x64dbg v0.25_dev_build, the help file won't open, and unfortunately that's my case :smile: \nAny ideas why ??\n. Can't re-open here because of the permissions.\n. What ? you mean right click -> properties -> unlock ?\nIf yes, then i've actually disabled this Windows feature from the local group policy a long time ago.\n. It's already unlocked for me,\nif the root folder is named anything then it opens, else if it's called x64dbg v0.25_dev_build then it doesn't open\n\n. Oh wait, if the path contains spaces then this issue occurs.\nnot only x64dbg v0.25_dev_build, just anything with spaces.\n. Is this related to 1bff3d5 ?\n. Sorry, i didn't actually see the commits before posting this\n. I have some other questions please,\nwhen i press Ctrl + G and type __ImageBase it doesn't resolve correctly,\nalso typing bubble_sort.main doesn't resolve.\nAm i doing something wrong ? i'm sure at least __ImageBase used to work in the past (when it was called IMbase)\n. This is considered an invalid issue now, since the commit was reverted.\n. Similar to #511 (explained there by mrexodia)\n@torusrxxx there are similar behaviors, take a look here for example #673 (comment).\nIf you're interested, here's the application from that issue:\nhttp://rgho.st/private/6hWXt2T2x/2279bee8d448c7b62cd5c49c2c86a8ba\n. @mrexodia I wanted to start testing the debugger again today regarding the db issue,\nso despite this GUI bug, is it ok to use this snapshot for testing or should i wait ?\n. I tried this issue now on snapshot_2016-06-06_06-15 and it it's partially solved (although the first post didn't describe the following).\nThis is a picture in which all fonts are set to 12: (all is good)\n\nThis is another picture with all fonts set to 6: (all is good too)\n\nAlso changing the resolution of the monitor doesn't cause any issues, but there is still one problem with HexDump.\nIf the font of the HexDump and General Tables are different, then the HexDump will be completely messed up, take a look at this picture:\n\n- Using Win10 x64\n- No DPI scaling or custom fonts are applied to Windows.\n. I completely suck at explanations and also not sure if the following is helpful in any way, so please bear with me.\n1. The debugger cannot pause a process if the currently active thread is anything other than Main\n2. The debug action Pause doesn't always auto-switch to the Main thread, sometimes pressing Pause will auto-switch to the Main thread and sometimes it won't.\nI guess this explains why sometimes pausing a debugee will throw the message Error setting breakpoint at xxx (SetBPX), also as mentioned in the 1st post when this happens, switching to the Main manually will solve the issue which verifies the problem of the pause action.\n\nAnother thing (maybe off-topic) that adds to the problem is the instability/weirdness of the Threads tab,\nsee how (supposedly) the Main is the active thread (as told by the title bar), but in the Threads tab thread 6 is the active one\n\nThis actually creates a problem when the following scenario happened (the other way around):\n1. Title bar says thread xxx is active (anything other than Main)\n2. Threads tab says that Main is active\nThe problem here is that i can't switch manually to the Main thread since it's already active in the Threads tab.\nSo when the message Error setting breakpoint at xxx (SetBPX) is thrown (after attempting to pause) i have to switch to any thread then back to Main.\nEDIT: apologies for the headache if non of this was helpfull. \n. For later reference, when this happens do the following:\n1. Switch to main thread //\n2. Press pause\n3. Give focus to debugee //\n4. done!. Forgot to mention that it dynamically updates the status, but only when Keep Size is selected.\nIt's been like that forever, nothing new, this is just an enhancement request.\n. Thank you so much.\n. It seems that the patches window issue is triggered when re-enabling the patches\n1. Debug anything\n2. Change any instruction at any section, then press Ctrl + P to open the patches dialogue\n3. Disable the patches by deselecting them\n4. Again re-enable the patches and the debugger will crash\nSometimes you have to repeat steps 3 & 4 multiple times to trigger the issue.\n. @Treetippayanipa you okay there buddy ?\n. I guess, take a look at #760 (comment)\n. It seems that on the 64-bit version of the debugger, all instructions are assumed to be using DS segment register even if they're not, hence, the segment register opcode is ignored (or at least that's how it seems to be).\nOld snapshot from 6/15: (correct)\n\nLatest snapshot: (wrong)\n\nsee the highlighted instruction, and also this one cmpxchg qword ptr ds:[7FF7AB8DC6C0], rbx,\nin the old it had the opcodes F0 48 0F B1 1D 36 86 00 00\nwhile in the build it became 48 0F B1 1D 36 86 00 00 and the byte F0 was ignored.\n. Oh!, that makes sense then.\nThank you.\n. It would be very irritating if you have to open every required tab at startup.\nAlternatively there is an option to save tabs order, what i do is just arrange them to suit my needs and put the least used ones at the very end/right, so whenever i open the debugger they'll always be like that.\n. @mrexodia i thought they had different meanings !\nisn't the red ones v indicate that this instruction will branch, while the black ones > indicate that there are references to this instruction ?!\n. Thank you very much.\n. similar to #434\n. Confirmed here too, some examples:\n1. msvcrt.dll:_waccess  vs  msvcr120.dll:_waccess\n\n2. msvcrt.dll:_wctype  vs  msvcr120.dll:_wctype\n\n3. _LNan_C  vs  msvcr120._LNan_C  vs  msvcr120.dll:_LNan_C\n\n. I can confirm this on Win10 x64, searching for references in memory map while debugging notepad.exe (doesn't matter if paused or not) will throw EXCEPTION_GUARD_PAGE and sometimes along with it STATUS_USER_CALLBACK.\nThis seems to be only happening with notepad.exe, never had this problem with any other application.\nlog:\n```\n1 occurrences found in 641ms\nFirst chance exception on 262976B6 (80000001, EXCEPTION_GUARD_PAGE)!\nDebugString: \"\\n\\n  Unhandled exception 0x80000001, hit in \\\"C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\notepad.exe\\\":\\n\\n\"\nDebugString: \"  enter .exr 0000000004ACD230 for the exception record\\n\"\nDebugString: \"   enter .cxr 0000000004ACCD40 for the context\\n\"\nDebugString: \"  then kb to get the faulting stack\\n\\n\"\nLast chance exception on 262976B6 (C000041D, STATUS_USER_CALLBACK)!\n```\nWill the minidump files be of any help for this ?\n. This is the information given by exinfo:\n```\nEXCEPTION_DEBUG_INFO:\n           dwFirstChance: 1\n           ExceptionCode: 80000001 (EXCEPTION_GUARD_PAGE)\n          ExceptionFlags: 00000000\n        ExceptionAddress: 262976B6\n        NumberParameters: 2\nExceptionInformation[00]: 00000000\nExceptionInformation[01]: 04EDFD22\n```\nTried a couple of other applications now and it happened with them too, so not only notepad.\nI actually meant manually generating those minidumps (Help --> Generate crash dump), here they are anyway just in case they're of any help.\nhttp://rgho.st/private/6l66z9Zc4/f6b6d7d8bc367217e1006c23e382f59f\n. I tried following both, ExceptionAddress wasn't anything valid, but ExceptionInformation[01] was pointing to a memory map that had the following info (the address is different here because that's another test):\n```\nAddress=04E05000\nSize=0000B000\nAllocation Type=PRV\nCurrent Protection=-RW-G\nAllocation Protection=-RW--\n```\n. This is pic from the memory map tab (i don't see the word stack):\n\nEDIT: by the way, this the very top of the page, i can't scroll up any more\n. @bobcfgxp and @dooley71 could you guys please verify whether you were debugging\nC:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\notepad.exe (32-bit version of notepad)\nor\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe  (64-bit version of notepad)\nbecause this seems to be happening for me with the 32-bit version only\n. By the way, this has been fixed almost 7 months ago, if OP wants to confirm.. I guess variable names like aaa, bbb, ccc, ddd, eee, fff\nare not accepted because it seems that the variable name is being resolved into a hex number.\nIn other words, var $eee, 123 and var $fff, 123 are exactly similar to something like this:\nvar $456, 123\nvar $789, 123\nwhich of course are not valid variable names since they're all numbers, hence eee and fff are not valid variable names.\nI don't think it's a weakness in the expression parser though, think of a situation like this:\nvar $qqq\nmov qqq, 123\nthat would work fine, but if variable names with hex numbers were accepted then it would be confusing to the debugger:\nvar $fff\nmov fff, 123\n@mrexodia i guess a solution to this would be restricting the dollar sign $ before var names, that way instructions like mov $fff, 123 would be accepted since the user has explicitly marked the token fff as a var name.\nEDIT: another thing i noticed on x64dgb.exe, after issuing vardel $asd, 123 you'll get the message deleted variable \"$asd\", but if you tried querying the value of $asd you'll get it as if the var wasn't deleted.\n. Thank you very much for all your work.\n. I know i'm going to sound really stupid but here's what i did, after downloading the .zip file you provided, i extracted it then copy/past-ed TitanEngine.dll (the 64-bit version from \"release\" folder) and replaced the original one .\nUpon opening x64dbg.exe, i got the error message: procedure entry point GetTEBLocation can't be located in x64dbg.dll followed by another one Error loading library \"x64gui.dll\"\nEDIT: even though the export GetTEBLocation does actually exist in x64dbg.dll\n\n. Never mind, i manually recompiled the GleeBug repository and it worked.\nIssue #877 is solved when i replaced TitanEngine with GleeBug :+1: \nbut this one still persists, although the target must be running now for this issue to occur.\n. Original post updated, this seems to be happening only with 32-bit applications, 64-bit applications are fine.\nThis statement also applies to issue #877 .\nEDIT: Notice the last line in this log snippet\n1 occurrences found in 656ms\nFirst chance exception on 964E76B6 (80000001, EXCEPTION_GUARD_PAGE)!\nDebugString: \"\\n\\n *** Unhandled exception 0x80000001, hit in \\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\SysWOW64\\\\notepad.exe\\\":\\n\\n\"\nDebugString: \" *** enter .exr 000000000017D2E0 for the exception record\\n\"\nDebugString: \" ***  enter .cxr 000000000017CDF0 for the context\\n\"\nDebugString: \" *** then kb to get the faulting stack\\n\\n\"\nLast chance exception on 964E76B6 (C000041D, STATUS_USER_CALLBACK)!\nDbgMemRead with invalid boundaries!\nThis last line was printed/logged when i did the following (on the 32-bit version of notepad):\n1. Follow the steps 1 ---> 3 from the first post\n2. Bring the debugee to foreground so that issue #877 is triggered (sometimes it just triggers immediately)\n3. Press F9 to continue normal execution (don't press Shift + F9 or else you may get an access violation error)\n4. While the debugee is running, go to the references tab where the search results are displayed then follow any result in the disassembler\n. After PR #1406 this issue and #877 are both fixed.\nThanks a ton @changeofpace.. Are those of any help ?\nWow64DisableWow64FsRedirection function (msdn)\nWow64RevertWow64FsRedirection function (msdn)\nAfter checking if the system is 64-bit, then i guess you can disable redirection.\n. I tried it on snapshot from 26/8 and it's still redirecting.\n. - OS: Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB x64 (version 1607, aka Anniversary Update). Main OS\n- OS: Windows 8.1 Enterprise x64. Virtual machine\n- Snapshot: snapshot_2016-08-26_01-46\nHere's what i did:\n1. Go to \"C:\\Windows\\System32\"\n2. Right click on notepad.exe then select Debug with x64dbg.\n3. You'll see that x32dbg.exe is started instead of x64dbg.exe and\nthe notepad.exe from SysWOW64 is loaded in it.\nEDIT: The antivirus software (Kaspersky) was turned off.\nEDIT 2: All the debugger executables x32dbg.exe, x64dbg.exe and x96dbg.exe are set to run as admin.\n. Found the problem, the function static arch GetFileArchitecture(const TCHAR* szFileName) is always returning 2 (x32), i debugged x96dbg.exe and manually changed the return value to 3 (x64) and the redirection was successfully disabled.\n. One more thing that may help, the function GetFileArchitecture() returns 2 (x32) because it relies on the windows function CreateFile(), which itself seems to be depending on redirection.\nFrom the msdn page Wow64DisableWow64FsRedirection function\n\n... To avoid these problems, disable file system redirection immediately before calls to specific file I/O functions (such as CreateFile) that must not be redirected, and re-enable file system redirection immediately afterward using Wow64RevertWow64FsRedirection.\n\nTo verify this try CreateFile() on an executable file that doesn't exist in the folder SysWOW64, example \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\acu.exe\". You'll see that it returns 0xFFFFFFFF.\n. Github doesn't allow this permission because the repository owner @mrexodia closed it himself.\n. The redirection is successfully disabled now. Thanks :+1:\n~~But if the application doesn't exist in SysWOW64 the problem will still persist,\nare you sick of me yet :smile: \nI'm not sure why does that happen, but even when the redirection is disabled,\nthe check if(pnth->FileHeader.Machine == IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_I386) in the function GetFileArchitecture() will return true.\nEDIT: try debugging \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\acu.exe\"~~\nNever mind about that, thanks anyway.\n. I was referring to the binary file acu.exe, it seems to be only visible in the explorer, when i tried to debug it i got the file not found error, it's not even visible in the open file dialogue (F3).\nBut anyway, aside from that application, everything works perfectly now, even if the target doesn't have an equivalent 32-bit version, its 64-bit version will be loaded correctly in x64dbg.exe.\n. Another question please, by design, we can't follow Imports, right ?\nI mean if the application xxx.exe for example calls kernel32.TerminateProcess, then i typed xxx.TerminateProcess or xxx.exe:TerminateProcess it won't resolve to its location in the imports table ?\n. Thank you so much :+1: \n. There's one thing though, you seem to be also using single quotes ' as a text wrapper, that actually will cause problems with modules whose names contain single quotes.\nFor example you can't do that\n\"yyy's xxx.exe\":EntryPoint\n. The new view looks really good especially with large amount of breakpoints,\nthe side-by-side stacked info in the Summary column makes it easier to keep track of the details for each breakpoint.\nThanks a ton!\nOne thing though, if you pressed on any column ex: Summary, Hit, etc... this GUI bug will occur:\n\nI know you don't like this, but I didn't want to open a complete new issue for this tiny bug.\nAgain thanks for all the work.. @Chandlr \nIt's not actually a bug, the string address is indeed stored in 0x1373094 (mine was 0x223094, generally the address of the string is stored in RVA 0x3094). But the instruction is actually accessing EBP + 0x1373094 so the debugger is trying analyze the string pointed-to by EBP + 0x1373094 not only 0x1373094.\nAnd since at the entry-point of the application (before stepping) the EBP register contains some values, you won't of course see the desired string.\nTo verify this yourself, at the entry-point of the application set EBP to 0,\nso that the debugger tries to analyze the string point-to by 0 + 0x1373094\n\n(hint: set EBP to 4 to see the bad boy's message!)\nOr you can make use of the \"dynamic comments\" feature of the debugger to always see strings pointed-to by RVA 0x3094 (good boy) and RVA 0x3094 + 4 (bad boy).\nAdd the following as comments to the instructions:\nstring at RVA (0x3094) = {s:[(:$0x3094)]}\nstring at RVA (0x3094 + 4) = {s:[(:$0x3094+4)]}\n\n. This seems to be just a display issue, it happens when the precision in the FPU control word (x87CW_PC) is set to 3 (Real10) or 1 (Not Used) (the instruction fninit sets precision to 3).\n\nAfter manually setting the precision to 2 (Real8) or 0 (Real4) it was displayed correctly (the program must be restarted to see the effect)\n\nBut the value was displayed correctly in the dump window either way.\n. Alright then, i was asking because one feature that was really good about Jenkins was that you could see which snapshot corresponds to which commits (also downloading pre-compiled files).\n@Chandlr Thanks for pointing out that plugin, didn't know about it.\n. Last snapshot that doesn't have this issue: snapshot_2016-09-07_06-08,\non this snapshot, breakpoints with mismatching bytes are simply disabled without any hangs.\nThe issue was introduced on: snapshot_2016-09-07_03-46,\nwhose commithash.txt is: a0ef9a0d9c2704791f5e315f678543e6a5f9bf4d\n. Thanks a lot.\n. Can't reproduce this on snapshot_2016-09-09_10-06, here's what i did:\n1. Using an old build snapshot_2015_2_20 i debugged x96dbg.exe that comes with snapshot_2016-09-09_10-06 and placed exactly 3 software breakpoints at RVAs 0x4FF4, 0x502D and 0x507C\n2. Copied the db file from snapshot_2015_2_20 to snapshot_2016-09-09_10-06 and again debugged x96dbg.exe, but the debugger didn't hang/crash.\n@MrIQZero assuming you're using snapshot_2016-09-09_10-06, could you try this db file, it's created using snapshot_2015_2_20, change extension to .dd32\nx96dbg.exe.txt\n. @MrIQZero you mentioned that you're using snapshot from sep_8_2016, is that right ?\nbecause that one had an issue with db files, see this #1066 .\nThe latest one is sep_9_2016\n\n. @Mark-Joy when this happens try the following:\n1. Go to Threads tab\n2. Right click on any thread other than Main\n3. Select Switch Thread\n4. Again go to Threads tab \n5. This time right click on the Main Thread and select Switch Thread\nSometimes i face this problem too, but i was never able to recreate it on purpose.\n. @mrexodia i loaded the application and entered fake serial/info so that the error message would show up.\nThis is what the debugger showed at first:\n\n\nAfter doing the steps i mentioned above:\n\n\n. Thanks\n. Thanks!\n. @ViRb3 Do you have any antivirus ?\nIf yes, try completely disabling it (and also disable it's startup with the system), reboot the OS and see if it's still persists.\nI had the exact same issue and it was because of Kaspersky, see issue #516 \n. If i'm not mistaken, what you're asking for is called cross references analysis,\nwhich basically displays all sources targeting a certain branch (all jmp/call/jnz/jae/etc... targeting a certain address).\nIf this is true, then luckily this has been implemented a long time ago, type analx in the command bar to invoke it.\nThis is the normal analysis done by x64dbg:\n\n3 lines for 3 jmps, each targeting the same destination, but as you said if we scroll up/down those lines will disappear, also clicking on the destination won't tell you who is jmp-ing to here.\nThis is the cross references analysis (after typing analx):\n\n1 line connecting all sources together, selecting the target will tell you all the sources, also if you scroll up/down it won't disappear.\nNotice how the red line points to each source (each jmp) by a small dash.\nAnother thing that's very useful in the cross references analysis is that you could select a certain destination then press x to see all the sources targeting it:\n\nyou could then double-click on any source to follow it in the CPU tab\nThere are other analysis types if you're interested, this is the official documentation for them:\nhttp://x64dbg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/analysis/\nVery sorry if none of that is what you were asking for :smile: \n. I totally forgot about #379, basically this request is a duplicate of it, very sorry about that.\n. This one is still not implemented, all other search types have section / module / all modules options except this one, which was the original request of #379\n. There's a workaround for this:\n1- Copy the desired/required address to clipboard\n2- Right click in the Disassembly view -> Search for -> Current Module -> Constant -> paste the address\nI guess you can close this now if you want.. ~~It seems that toggling doesn't work if current value is negative.~~\nnevermind that, it's random\n. Fun fact: The toggle option for registers (and this bug) existed since snapshots form 2014 \nI guess this option was really unused a lot :smile: .\n. It will only be updated if the next instruction caused the current page to be scrolled.\nEDIT: Also check the title bar, something wrong with it.\nIt won't display full info after pressing Numapd -, only module name. You must then use Numpad + to reach the current instruction so it would display full info again, anything else won't work.\nbefore pressing Numapd -\n\nafter pressing Numapd -\n\n. Alright, thanks.\nI haven't been getting all notifications lately.\n. Yeah this is getting really annoying to me, i'll contact them today.\n. Thank you.\n. @mrexodia Do you mean #1009 ?\n. Thank you.\n. The Latest snapshot whose performance is natural/fast: snapshot_2016-11-18_18-21\ncommithash.txt: b5b76310d47cf00f64475d8db661cbda56bc8759\nThe first snapshot whose performance is affected/slow: snapshot_2016-11-20_22-01\ncommithash.txt: 6b1c60d18c3574c35e2561a26ff90aacd4c3614e\n. I didn't actually mean that those specifically are the faulty commits, just stating what's inside commithash.txt in case that helps to determine which commits (between both) could be the cause.\nAnyway it's the same reason as #516 :disappointed: , the difference here is that kaspersky doesn't have to be disabled during OS startup to solve the issue.\nWhen it's turned off: events/s = 20-30 (both snapshots).\nWhen it's turned on: events/s = 19-28 on snapshot_2016-11-18_18-21,\nand 9-12 on snapshot_2016-11-20_22-01 (and the new ones).\nI never noticed this before because i was using builds from October most of the time, which (as every other builds before them) don't have this problem, it only became obvious when i started using the latest snapshots consistently a couple of days ago.\nVery sorry about this misleading/useless issue.. With GleeBug (stepping-over x32dbg.exe):\n\n\nkaspersky off;\nevents/s = 22-30 on both snapshots (and latest ones).\n\n\nkaspresky on:\nevents/s = 19-25 on both snapshots\nDefinitely better than 9 events/s. . @mrexodia 10 months ago when this issue occurred i had a Core i3 processor (2 cores, 4 threads), the issue was definitely reproduce-able with the above-mentioned snapshot_2016-11-20_22-01,\nnow i have a Core i7 processor (4 cores, 8 threads) and the issue is no longer reproduce-able even with snapshot_2016-11-20_22-01.\nThe events/second (when debugging x32dbg.exe )is now consistent at 30-31 with all snapshots.\n\n\nThe processor might have been the problem, or may be one of Kaspersky's updates had solved the problem, but i guess it's worth mentioning that i haven't changed it's version 17.0.0.611 since that time.\nFeel completely free to close this issue, it's no longer relevant/reproduce-able, if i found a way to trigger it again i'll leave a comment here. Thanks for the continued support.. @hulucc I tried your unpackme with the VMProtect profile and it ran fine.\nAlthough, it couldn't be dumped with Scylla.\n\nOEP seems to be at RVA 0x1253\n. Can i nag you a little bit more about this ?\nThe focus will still be reset (to the first item in the modules list) on the following actions:\n1. Select any module other than the 1st one, then (de)select a patch group.\nNow the 1st module will be selected.\n2. Pressing (De)Select All or Restore Selected will also reset the selected module.\n3. Pick Groups now works, but after clicking Toggle once, the patches window will steal the focus.\nAlso after that, the selected module will be reset.. Thank you.. Seems to be fixed in latest snapshot snapshot_2017-01-19_21-26. Here's a 64-bit version of the application, try the same steps and this issue won't be triggered\nhello_world_tst3_x64.txt\n. Number 2 seemed fair enough for me, also as you said this wow64 code isn't associated with a module, so based on that i did try the following as a stop condition for the TraceIntoConditional:\n!mod.party(cip) && mod.base(cip) && mod.entry(cip)\nsince both mod.base(cip) and mod.entry(cip) always returns 0 in this case.\nIt worked in some cases, but in others it didn't; sometimes even the user code would be completely bypassed.\nTo demonstrate this,\n1. Download this hello_world app (same one as above but with a MessageBox) and pause the debugger when the message box is displayed\n2. In the command bar type:\nTraceIntoConditional !mod.party(cip) && mod.base(cip) && mod.entry(cip)\nthen press ok in the message box\n3. The dubugee will be terminated even though there are still some code after the call to MessageBoxA()\n4. Again debug this app but this time use TraceOverConditional instead of TraceIntoConditional\nand the debugger will pause at the proper code as expected.\nAm i doing something wrong ?\n. Thank you.. Oh, sorry for this duplicate, didn't read the mentioned issue before opening this one.. Scylla for some reason can't enumerate the APIs of one of the loaded modules from memory (i would blame it on lib.dll provided in the zip file), setting Scylla to read APIs from disk will workaround this issue.\nBefore debugging the application open Scylla -> Misc -> Options -> tick the option Read APIs always from disk (slower!)\nor edit Scylla.ini and change the following parameter:\nAPIS_ALWAYS_FROM_DISK=1\nTo prove that lib.dll is the reason:\n\nMake sure break on System Breakpoint is selected in the debugger options\nMake sure Read APIs always from disk (slower!) is not selected in Scylla options\nOpen x32dbg.exe -> press F3 and select lib.dll\nWhen you land at the system breakpoint go to the Symbols tab, and you'll notice that lib.dll is not loaded yet\nOpen Scylla and it won't crash\nNow run the debugger (F9) to reach the entrypoint of the dll (so that it's loaded),\nthen try to open Scylla and it'll crash\n\nRepeat those steps again but select/mark Read APIs always from disk (slower!) in Scylla options and no crashes will occur.. Adding more info to this issue:\nScylla fails here: ApiReader.cpp#L59, the function ApiReader::isModuleLoadedInOwnProcess() should return true but in this case it's returning false.\nThe reason is that lib.dll is not registered/stored in the std::vector ProcessAccessHelp::ownModuleList which seems to be only manipulated here: Scylla.cpp by ProcessAccessHelp::getProcessModules().\nHope these info help in resolving the issue.\n. In the blog post, the function address was 0xF7770000, and EIP was 0xF7770003\nwhich means that the result (pushed EIP) was at +3 offset from the function beginning,\nthat implies that the recorded/pushed EIP was the one pointing at the instruction ftst (last executed FPU instruction).\nWhen i tried it i got the same result too, see this pic:\n\nrecorded/pushed EIP (0x00141014) - function beginning (0x00141011) = +3\nTaking a look at some references like:\nhttp://x86.renejeschke.de/html/file_module_x86_id_119.html\nor\nhttp://www.nacad.ufrj.br/online/intel/vtune/users_guide/mergedProjects/analyzer_ec/mergedProjects/reference_olh/mergedProjects/instructions/instruct32_hh/vc120.htm\nor\nhttp://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/devel/assembly/ia32_isaA.pdf (page 334 of 580)\nEDIT: how the hell could i forget that!, you can also right click the instruction and select Help on mnemonic\n\nThe saved image reflects the state of the FPU after all floating-point instructions preceding the FSTENV/FNSTENV instruction in the instruction stream have been executed.\n\nIf i do understand correctly, that means that the address of the last executed FPU instruction would be the one recorded/pushed.\nTo verify that:\n\nSo it seems working as expected, but if that's not true could you please post the addresses you got vs. what was expected ?\n. You mean like StepInto vs. StepOver ?, because for me both have the same results.\nThis is what i get, Control/Status/Tag words along with EIP seem to be pushed correctly:\n\nThis is a sided by side pic with OllyDbg (both debuggers push the same values on the stack):\n\n. @n0way0ut This looks like a valid .Net app, use something like dnSpy to debug it.\n\n. Cheat Engine uses Hardware breakpoints by default,\n\nWhile x64dbg uses INT3 breakpoints by default,\nto use Hardware breakpoints right click on the instruction -> Breakpoint -> Set Hardware on Execution\n\n.

Why not a plugin? A plugin seems more appropriate for this task.\n. Many many Ollydbg plugins make strong assumptions about the debugger being Olly, e.g. patch specific addresses of memory. Thus, I don't think that it's worth it. Even if you will be able to recreate all or most of the API, it won't be enough for most plugins.\n. These are checkboxes, so just removing the \"Toggle\" word is enough.\nOn the other hand, there's a problematic menu in the memory map:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kSv8Sat.png\n.

I'd say that it would be also useful to show addresses here, near the menu entries:\n\nAnd that's nitpicking, but I'd do the formatting the other way around, i.e.: rax=12345678 (label). Good to know.

Yes, but it's not as quick as Ctrl+G, and I need to to select all of the modules and stuff. Olly's (2) goto dialog is nice.... Olly includes everything, not only exported functions. Why ctrl+home and not just home? I'd also expect shift+home and shift+end, shift+pgup, shift+pgdn.. A file is different than a list. In a file, home/end go to the start/end of line. In the list there is no caret, so it's not relevant. Compare it to the system lists, you can even see it in explorer by switching to details view.. Maybe one day, when I install visual studio.... I tried... don't really know how to do page up and page down. @Atvaark can this be used in the references view?. What's the high level goal? What's wrong with the current code/approach?. I thought about it as a snowman replacement, if they implement 64-bit soon at least. I see this issue too. I set about 10000 breakpoints, and it was hanging for several hours. Left the PC running through the night, came back and it was unfrozen, so it's not a deadlock.\nCan we not refresh the GUI for every bp, but only when all are added?. I didn't have the cookie option.

Yep. Since it's the less common scenario, maybe make ctrl+arrow move a word, and ctrl+alt+arrow move a byte.. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4190703\n. CreateFile -> fopen.\n. sprintf_s? Also, tabs to spaces.\n. That's not how Olly does this. It uses the data contents, not the section name.\n.

Should it be reopened?. @mrexodia Didn't know about that. It would be great to do so, I'll change it.. There is no anti-debugging in the file. If it's not related to x64dbg, why OllyDbg succeeds?. In x64dbg there are no handles, but it should, at least a mutex was opened, while OllyDbg identifies opened handles. So I'm not totally convinced there is no problem in x64dbg.. I didn't say that this is a bug in x64dbg. This issue was opened because another debugger succeeds in doing the same operation, on the same system. So, I thought it is helpful to question this situation, also question why x64dbg doesn't show the (other) opened handles..

Hello Mr Exodia !\nthanks a lot for your answer. I'm currently reading thoroughly the whole manual.\nBut in spite of this, I still don't understand the \"mind\" of the conditionnal breakpoint as implemented in x32dbg : \nlook, I tried of course your suggestion on the \"calc.exe\" program, but then the memory-location is invalid and I get the answer \"Erreur de param\u00e9trage du point d'arr\u00eat en 0040000!

What didn't I catch well ?\nWhat do you suggest ?\nBy the way, I have another question about 'bplist' : \nI set many librarian breakpoint and it worked fine ; I can see all of them in the breakpoint window as you can see here : \n\nbut the 'bplist' command shows only the first one ; I know it must be something stupid I didn't catch, but here I'm stuck ;D ...\n\nThanks for taking a few minutes to answer me...\nHave a nice day ...\n. Hello again and thanks for your answer.\nWell, in fact, thanks to your answer, I realized that I asked my question in a wrong way.\nMy question should rather have been, not \"Where is EAX equal to 1 ?\", but instead \"When is EAX equal to 1 ?\"\n...and to be even more accurate, \"What instructions set EAX equal to 1 ?\"\n--> what I wanted is x32dbg to break exactly after (or even before) the instruction has set EAX to 1, so that I can identify it.\nTo give you examples of what I mean, remember the SoftIce command \"bpx eip if eax = 1\", or \"bpx eip if eax >= 1ff && eax <= 300\"\nThis is exactly what I was searching in x32dbg.\nYou gave me the idea to use TraceIntoConditional which is about equivalent. I will manage with it.\nNow, if you can advise me an equivalent x32dbg command to the SoftIce \"bpx eip if eax = 1\", please let me know.\nThe fact is that with softIce, in the \"bpx eip if eax = 1\", the eip arg was parametric and not constant, which is not the case in x32dbg, unless I mistake...\nAnyway, thanks a lot again for your help ;D\nHave a nice day..\n.

Ollydbg generally can handle this issue, but I can't test it, since I'm not being able to run the game with Olly attached to this game - probably due to a security detection.\n. Thanks for the reply, mrexodia. I solved the problem by using the windowed mode, as you have suggested.\n. mrexodia, please, add the \"Follow DWORD in Dump\". When selecting a sequence of bytes in the dump window (eg: 4 bytes), the user may want to follow it in the dump window (very useful for looking the content of vtables). Currently it only shows the \"Follow DWORD in Disassembler\" option.\n. Yes, I'm using  the snapshot_2015-07-14_02-09, and it doesn't have the context menu inside the dump window (only in the Disasm, Registers and Stack windows). \nLook at the image below, I've selected 4 bytes in the dump window, which is a pointer to a vtable, but it doesn't give me the option to follow it in that window (only in the Disassembler).\n\n.

I would really appreciate it!\n. Thank you very much Nukem! I gonna test it right now.\n. This problem also occurs inside Disasm window when using copy-paste sometimes. I was able to simulate this bug in the following way:\n1-open your target and choose an address (can be any addr)\n2-open the \"Go to expression\" window (CTRL+G), enter the address into it, and then OK (the first time it will work fine)\n3-now copy the address to the clipboard, select other addr in the Disasm window (just for testing the Go to expression function), press CTRL+G, and paste the addr using either the CTRL+V keys or the mouse right-click. This time the OK button will become disabled.\n. MrExodia, I'd like to ask you to reopen this issue because the problem stills persists, at least with a specific target. When I try to load HeroesOfTheStorm.exe (from Heroes of the Storm game), passing the DLLs directory to the InitDebug command, the debugger loads only the system DLLs and terminates the process with the following message:\n\"Process stopped with exit code 0xC0000135\" \nI have tested it with the \"Break on System breakpoint\" and \"Break on Entry\" options checked. This problem also occurs if I don't pass any arguments to the InitDebug command (just the exe file path).\nI'm using the following command line:\nInitDebug \"C:\\Games\\Heroes of the Storm\\Versions\\Base39709\\HeroesOfTheStorm.exe\" \"-sso=1 -launch -uid heroes\" \"C:\\Games\\Heroes of the Storm\\Support\"\nThis runs the 32bit version of the game.\nAs I said before, using Ollydbg201 it works fine. Please, test it by yourself to verify I'm not lying.\n. Good, thanks for the info.\n. ",

The plugin  work like this: \nPopup a window to show the class/struct information. Information in window will be updated by every mouse'click in cpu, memory or stack window.

This new code has thie effect: when filter empty, del char can get back to previous selected line.. @mrexodia , I found  a bug, \nin symbols view default:\n\nif sort by Type:\n\nThis will not function well, after some debug, I think the reason is the last line:\nmSearchList->reloadData();\nmCurList->setSingleSelection(i) cause to select a line, but reloadData cause a new sort, which can change the view.\nbtw : This only affect sorting by Type, sort by Address or Sybmol are just OK\nSolution: could we reloadData before setSingleSelection? . @mrexodia thank you very much! \nI finally know how x64dbg work if press 'ENTER' in import table, it just only dump in memory view but not change the address in disassembler view. \nAnd CTRL+R only search  for the current region in disassembler view, that cause I thaught is a bug is because I goto IAT address  in disassembler view and then press CTRL+R,  of course it can not get any result because the address is in '.idata' section which only have import table data.\nSo, very sorry for the misunderstanding!\nCould you rollback the change for 'ENTER' press action in import table, because after compiled the latest code, when press 'ENTER' will cause disassembler view turn to the import address. Previously, if I want the 'ENTER' action in CTRL+N like ollydbg, I can just press ENTER in x64dbg, then CTRL+R, bug now need more step.\ntwo little more suggestion:\n1. the tittle in References like 'Constant:004546477 (Region global.exe)'  can have more detail, we can take the section name from memory map, for example:'Constant:004546477 in global.exe(.text)', or 'Constant:004546477 in global.exe(.idata)'\n2. the focused window in CPU view can have more thicker border like in ollydbg, if possible, can have a config color for border. If I press 'ENTER' in import table, I can know which window I focused in.\n. I figure out how CTRL+R works in ollydbg\nThere are two kind of address:\n1. address belong to a section, whose type is IMG, it's in a module\n2. address belong to a section, whose type is PRV or MAP, it's in a heap or map.\nif press CTRL+R on the 1st address, ollydbg will only search in region of module '.text', which it's think is the code region, no matter where located in disassembler view\nif press CTRL+R on the 2nd address, it will search in the region showed in disassembler view\nI think this is reasonable, I feel comfortable about this, and never thought how it implemented until this post. I think, normally, there may not have many references cross modules on a address. A address usually only mean something to the module which it's belong to.\nHowever, on 1st address, ollydbg seem only search the first '.text' section, I don't know if there would have more section like '.text', an easy decision is to search all section belong to the same module.. @mrexodia, really appreciate your work! I found a code bug relate to the shortcut, see the comment in your commit.\n. @Mattiwatti yes, actually, it's called directly by _SetWindowsHookEx. I downloaded the lastest  x64dbg release, it now can find the correct result, may be fixed by some recent commit. \nVery sorry for the trouble!. @mrexodia , you may miss using IMAGE_ORDINAL to get the ordinal value:\ncurrent:\n\nin IDA:\n\nby the way, it would be better if showing the name of the ordinal function when it has a name, you can display it at 'Symbol (undecorated)'  column.\n. @mrexodia , it's may not easy to handle this, right now is just fine. I tested IDA, if common.dll not exsit will show:\n\nif there exsits common.dll:\n\nright now in x64dbg, the first column has a hint:\n\nthe only fault is that it can't be searched by filter. ok, I close the issure due to dumplicate #1764. @mrexodia , that's strange. I tested Shift+F4 in ollydbg, it still got error, but the error is single step event at the line below the original condition breakpoint.\n. but if I want to sort by dll name, mean while not missing the function sorting by function name. yes, you can have 'DLL + symbol' like in ollydbg, just implment as you wish :)\nOne more feature request: if 'Symbol (undecorated)'  can unmangle the symbols of gcc functions, that would be awesome.. @mrexodia ,  a new demangler library from avast https://github.com/avast-tl/demangler, there are more useful library in https://github.com/avast-tl, such as pdbparser etc.\n. Yes, currently x64dbg goes the way like chrome, but in ollydbg Ctrl+Tab goto previous popuped window(like the detached window inx64dbg) in history stack. Consider the scenario: I press CTRL+R on a address in CPU, it turns into reference view, if I can't find any useful information, then I should go back, in olly it's just Ctrl+Tab, in x64dbg there has a shortcut for CPU view is Alt+C. But if the previous view is not CPU view, then I should recall where the view I come from, and trigger the corresponding shortcut?. Should close now, implement at pull 1807. wait... maybe I should assign shortcut and to this, so user can cutomize the shortcuts.\n\nupdate: done in d1fd020. In recent commit, I  rename HistoryViewsPopupWindow to MultiItemsSelectWindow, the idea is that:\nI wish there would have some shortcuts for \"Follow in Dump/Disassembler/Stack/MemoryMap\", but usaully it will have more than one choice to select:\n\nSo it's can't to select one without mouse. My idea is binding a shortcut like  to \"Follow in Dump\", when press , it popup a window like:\n\nto choose one entry you don't need mouse, only continue to press  it will goto next entry, and you can bind  to go back. same idea can apply to other \"Follow in ...\"\n. Don't know which way people like, my init implement is to replace CTRL+TAB, but they can coexist now.  In private, I will bind CTRL+TAB to this.\nDouble click may encounter a problem that which target it will follow, my idea is that CTRL+1 to follow in disassembler, CTRL+2 to  follow in dump, CTRL+3 to follow in stack, no matter where you locate at.  Of course you can place all options in one menu, but it's may not straight forward, need people to think about which entry he/she should choose. --however, my idea sometime will also need people to choose, just lack some entries, but I can fix the entry, for example, CTRL+1 to follow in disassembler, the first entry is '[address]', the second is 'address', if [address] is invalid, it's still show and do nothing if seleceted.. @mrexodia , Alt+Insert is copy address, this is copy file offset. OK, close the pull, I just like the way it works in IDA. New shortcut binding may have more burden of memory.. Yes it's auto selected, I've already tested. . I got crash once, by attaching to the crash process, I found that the xAnalyzer cause the crash, after some check, I think when x64dbg close, it will unload all plugins, but if the plugin have extra thread or registed callbacks and not well handled when unloading, it will crash.... The source of data is the same as the right menu, but seems have bug like showed in the gif.. \u5b9e\u7528\u662f\u786c\u9053\u7406\u554a\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709StrongOD\u90a3\u6837\u7684\u5feb\u6377\u952e\uff0c\u67e5\u770b\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u76f4\u90fd\u662f\u9f20\u6807\u53f3\u952e\u83dc\u5355\u5f88\u4e0d\u65b9\u4fbf\u7684. \u8fd9\u4e2a\u8ddf\u65b0\u7248CTRL+TAB\u5207\u6362\u662f\u4e00\u6837\u7684\uff0c\u4e00\u677e\u624b\u7a97\u53e3\u5c31\u6ca1\u6709\u4e86\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c31\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5230\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9009\u4e2d\u9879\u4e86\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5c31\u4e0d\u8981\u677eCTRL\uff0c\u7ee7\u7eed\u63091/2\u3002\n\u83dc\u5355\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u4e3a\u6ca1\u6709\u6309CTRL\u53ea\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5230\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9879\u3002\n\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5checkout\u8fd9\u4e2abranch\u8bd5\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\u3002.

And an exclusive lock around accessing the DB then?\n. make it more exclusive. lol. j/k\n. weird, it usually does fix it for me when I commit. \n. Yea it seems like it would be an easy addition using their property sheets. so what should I do? recommit or something?\n. yea, so what happened was when I tested the code in a stand alone project I had Unicode character set defined in the project, so when I copied it over I also enabled it on x96 project, which broke compatibility with the rest of the code. Going to revise the code with no Character Set defined.\n. I tried this with latest snapshot and I can't seem to reproduce, are you using the latest build?\n. I thought I added this feature already its #533. In Memory Map view, you can right click any memory region and select \"Dump Memory To File\"\n. Could you provide this executable?\n. nice! i didnt think to look there! thx @RaMMicHaeL \n. For the Ctrl+G option (Go To Expression)? \n. perhaps just curstack, curdisasm, cursel\n. Yea I mean, visually its an eye sore when the name is kept that long and you have to expand the view to see the API calls.

I'll look around, if I find it I'll report and close.\n. Hi, yes, might be also related with #507 . International characters don't seem to be properly supported yet. There is room for improvements there and much needed PRs for it :)\n. perhaps using the current systems locale to determine the code page change?\n. Nice! looking forward to testing this merge out\n. Hmm so I just tried to fix this with what seems to be the most logical approach. Adding a check for DbgIsDebugging in the Attach signal, and calling Detach if true, but that didn't work..is there some underlying behavior I'm not seeing here?\n. Ok, discussed with mrexodia, this is the intended behavior. Use Detach option to detach from process.\n. This issue can be closed now.\n. For your original post, I just downloaded that executable and followed your steps and it went to main fine.\n\nFor the second issue, I'll get back to you on that one.\n. Actually, nvm. Testing on an old build.\n. I fixed the original issue, but the second comment still seems to not work. Although typing \"main\" gets you to main directly. __ImageBase doesn't work.\n. Could you change the title to reflect the feature you want. Like \"Animate Into Feature\"\n. This will really be a good one!\n. This issue is resolved now. Can be closed.\n. If this works, I'd like to get it done for the Settings Dialog as well. Might help with the hi DPI displays\n. So no matter how many bytes you select it will always only allow one byte modifications?\n. Fill Data seems to have a similar constraint, where even if you decide to fill more than one byte of data (and Keep size is not selected), it will only fill the first byte you entered.\n. This is not fixed. Just used latest snapshot and having the highlighting issues.\nAlso the Registers view still suffers from the clipping of the addresses.\n\n. I always use the github snapshot\n. This issue is fixed now. Can it be closed?\n. What processes have you tried debugging? Which snapshot are you using? and can you provide any publicly available samples to test this on? \nAlso what OS?\n. I'll check this today and comment/close with response\n. Perhaps an option to just load plugins on demand? Unload/Reload? \n. This has now been implemented. Test it out with commands plugload and plugunload\n. hmm, I like this idea. Will put it on my todo for the weekend.\n. Something that works similar to IDA's popup would be cool. Scrollable + a hotkey to jump to destination while popup is open would be neat. Although [Enter] takes you there anyways now.\n. Do we want this to be the default behavior for the loader? I think I can add/test this tonight in the loader.\n. Impossible. Could you outline your exact steps for me. And details about system? \n. Ah, ok then I'll review this function for accuracy. Thank you for testing!\n. @wk-952 If the application doesn't have an equivalent 32-bit version, there is nothing to redirect to. Is that what you were referring to? Is everything working ok now?\n. I just tested this and it seems to work fine.\n. Was this addressed in that patch #1162 ?\n. Which views does this affect?\n. Should it be just a label, or label and address like the other recent PR i submitted? label (dst_address) ?. @torusrxxx do you really think it's necessary to make this a setting? \nI ask because I wonder under what condition a user wouldn't want to see a label in these context menu's if its available. \nMy idea is to extend the definition of getSymbolicName  to allow developers to pass flags to control the output format of the string. What were your thoughts on the setting? is it just (show symbols/labels checkbox?). So, this is what I am thinking so far, chime in if anything looks wrong.\n/*\n * SYM_DEFAULT =  'addr <module.label>' if module/label exist else its addr\n * SYM_NOMODULE = addr <label>\n * SYM_NOLABEL = addr <module (.addr?) >\n * SYM_ADDRONLY = addr\n * SYM_NOADDR = <module.label> only, if module doesnt exist <addr.label>,\n * if label doesnt exist <module.addr>\n * */\nThis seems to cover most of the cases just discussed. The function will become \nQString getSymbolicName(duint addr, unsigned int flags). Go to the Options and disable System Breakpoint.\n. Could you provide some more information on your setup? OS, x64dbg version. Also maybe your application is exiting after you press F9? Check the Call stack Tab when it breaks on that Leave to see what has happened up to that point\n. For issue #983 \n. You can do that in the dump view\n. This is a job for a plugin that registers the breakpoint callback perhaps.\n. Alternatively, if you want to force it to show in CPU, change that memory pages protection to executable and it should work that way\n. So I took a look at this and this isn't an issue with x64dbg, but rather the behavior of Explorer.exe.\nThe same behavior can be seen using OllyDbg.\nIn short, if Explorer.exe is already running, the new explorer.exe will call a function named StartExplorerWindow using ShellExecute and the verb \"opennewwindow\", this spawns a new explorer Window and then it exits the Explorer.exe process.\nThere are also some checks made in the registry before this happens which lead me to believe there is a way around this. This could be worth a try: \nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc144064(v=vs.85).aspx\nSo it is just spawning a new process using ShellExecute and then exiting, which is why you're seeing the new Explorer Window but the debugger is reporting the process terminating.\n. If you want to see this behavior yourself, You can:\n1.  Download Symbols for explorer under the debugger\n2. Go to Symbols Tab and Search for the StartExplorerWindow Export and set a BP\n3. Run Debugger.\n. Yea this is well suited for a plugin. @lynnux if there is anything you would like to have implemented for the pluginsdk let it be heard, I have had recent interest in making it better. I have a similar idea for a plugin that resembles an Olly plugin where you can \"decode address as\" a Windows Structure, so if you know for example a pointer is to be treated as a PEB then you can view it as such...etc..\n. Did you confirm that it was the AV? @ViRb3\n. :) \n. Hi, could you explain the steps you took to reproduce the issue?\n. So I want to add this feature, you have any suggestions on what default hotkeys would make sense?\nShould it support all the views or just maybe the most commonly used ones (opinion based).\nH - Hex\nT - TExt\nI - Integer\nF - Float\nA - Address\nHowever as you know there are several subviews for each of those. Should the hotkey just toggle the 'first' ones? or should pressing H multiple times cycle through each Hex view?. Is this really necessary if the Goto dialog invoked from the Dump view has the same effect?. Looks like it exists:\n_plugin_menuentrysetvisible(int pluginHandle, int hEntry, bool visible);. What is installagent.exe?. 1. Are you using any plugins? Which ones.\n2. When it crashes inside the debugger, can you see what the Call Stack looks like? (Call Stack Tab) Show us\n3. Check the Logs window as well for possible more information\n4. Any AV software running? Or any program that could be injecting code into the process.\nUnfortunately I dont have the game so there is little I can do with the information provided.. Is Usermodule = main executable in this case?. I believe scrolling in and out of the area would refresh the view.. Not enough information. Could you provide us with information on how to reproduce this crash. Whats the target application? what did you do? when did it crash?\n. Looks like the crash occurs in dgbhelp.dll. Would you be able to generate a usermode crash dump file? Or some stack trace. The report still doesnt provide enough information to work with.. Is that line related to the currently selected line?. @justanotheranonymoususer see if the recent PR accomplished your request. then close if so, thanks.. Ok. np. This also occurs if you just detach the tab and try to follow in dump 1 as well. I'll take a look at this, I think I know why.. Wasnt this fixed recently by @torusrxxx ?\n. Looks like what you're POC'ing is something malware does very often called Process Hollowing, but usually after NtUnMapViewOfSection is called, the hollowed memory is replaced with some malicious binary code, then it continues execution. (which explains the violation when you try to continue notepad). I've had trouble with this technique with x64dbg as well, but I dont try to attach after the process has been unmapped, Im already usually in a debugging session when it occurs. It is interesting that Windbg recovers, I wonder if its using some kind of file on disk loading.. Oh nevermind, I think I see what WinDBG is doing. When the break-in fails, it suspends the process (threads) then it tries again.\n\nWARNING: Break-in timed out, suspending.\n         This is usually caused by another thread holding the loader lock\n\nThat message makes it evident.\nMore information form the Googles.\n\nWhen you attempt to attach a debugger to a running application,\nthe debugger will first attempt to create a special purpose remote thread\nin the target process, and the remote thread will call DebugBreak();\nIf the loader lock is held in the remote process, then the creation of the\nthread\ncannot complete, because the thread-init code requires the loader lock\nto walk the list of the loaded dlls inorder to call DllMain(THREAD_ATTACH)\nfor all the Dlls that requested thread notifications.\nIf the remote thread creation failed, or it delayed too much,\nthe debugger resorts to suspendoing all the running threads.\n. That's not a bad option as well.. Im working on a fix for this. Should be done in a day or so after some testing. I'll need someone to test on 32bit OS if I dont install a VM by then. Why did you close the issue if the problem was not resolved?\n. Sounds like theres some anti-debug being used by the game, in which case you'll need to identify what it is and possibly write a plugin to circumvent it. CE's VEH debugger utilizes Vectored Exception handlers as a replacement for conventional breakpoints, if that gets around the game my first guess would be to see if the game utilizes any thread based Strutured Exception handlers to see if you're using any debuggers (second pass to their SEH and if its a breakpoint exception would be a prime way to see).\n\nAlso did u try playing with the other breakpoint options in x32dbg? besides int3, there is long int3 and UD2.\n. Hi, thanks for taking this issue on! I do believe Symbols for all Modules isn't necessary for the CPU Tab. \nIf you want to remove the ambiguity, then might I offer the solution of building the menu item dynamically to include the name of the currently debugged module. So it would be: \n\"Download Symbol for [ X ]\" where X is filled in during Context Menu painting. @mrexodia this is possible under the new menuBuilder right?. Hmm not sure what youre going through but I just tested this and it broke just fine on CreateThread API. Try updating your x64dbg version to latest.\n. Isnt this fixed by @torusrxxx PR?\n. Not sure if its a bug, but just go to the DLL and 'Download Symbols for this module' and it will resolve the Hello Export.. What version of x64dbg are you using @toffler . You could also use the xanalyzer plugin that offers the ability to do a module wide analysis . Does this break the context menu?. hold on merge, i noticed its not complete yet.\n. yea, I think it falls under 'feature relevant' data. As in, if I'm looking up the xrefs of a function I'd like to know at a glance who's calling it, without having to click each item to then scroll up to the function prologue to figure it out (that quickly becomes a pain for a large number of xrefs). with IDA's view I can see directly who's calling it and navigate directly to the point of interest.. Sure you can. https://x64dbg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/debug-control/InitDebug.html. I wouldn't hold my breath on that. Are you seeing discrepancies in the function analysis of x64dbg vs IDA? You can define these through the debugger manually too. Also, the plugin https://github.com/ThunderCls/xAnalyzer provides additional analysis that might fit your needs.. You could always patch the Entrypoint of the Service executable (to EBFE) and make sure to adjust the timeout value in the registry and attempt to attach to the stalled Service entrypoint. Its a hack and it'll depend on how early the Service starts after system boot.. Try Simon Says.. You could minimize the space taken by putting the checkbox for 'Keep Size' back to the left, it was fine in that position and can be in the same row as the buttons. Otherwise Im ok with the tabbed views\n. Can you elaborate what you want to accomplish here?\n. I agree with a log filtering system. This way it can also be exposed to plugins.\n. I like this idea, it seems like something that can be done with a plugin too. @mrexodia can output be formatted in the log window?\n. You need to add that exception to the exception list. When a NET program is loaded and the CLR environment is started, it invokes that Exception (its a harmless exception) and debuggers should ignore it.\nRef: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/bca092d4-d2b5-49ef-8bbc-cbce2c67aa89/net-40-firstchance-exception-0x04242420?forum=clr\n. Yea, that last exception just seems like some other error occurred within the .NET runtime. But I didn't check the program he attached.. The mov edi, edi instruction is considered a no operation instruction would be my best guess for this.\nThe instruction is simply a placeholder for hot patching API's in Windows and served no real purpose.. Write a small program that loads the dll and calls the export you intend to debug, place a breakpoint on that export and then debug it, The program would essentially call LoadLibrary and GetProcAdress() for the export you intend to use.\n. When you say function analysis, what are you referring to exactly? just symbols and labels? since youre already doing your work across IDA and x64dbg, perhaps labeless plugin might work for you also? https://github.com/a1ext/labeless. You could try and run a few of the corkami samples through it and see if any of the 'legal malformed' PE's crash the parser somehow. https://github.com/corkami/pocs. Thanks for sharing, thats quite an interesting use of the core debugger to create a headless debugging capability.. This change should be removed.. ",

The invalid BSs still show up in the list and deleting them hasn't been fixed in the latest snapshot.\n. Found the issues.\n\nThe Qt documentation said that the 'x' character in a mask means Any character permitted but not required.. But I must have read over that blank characters are removed from masked inputs after every change. And there was also an off by one error when editing an uneven amount of bytes.\nThis means that a custom QLineEdit is needed to fix both errors in #367. \nYou should open that issue again.\n(The jumping to the end of the text box error can still be fixed with this:)\n```\nvoid HexEditDialog::on_lineEditAscii_textEdited(const QString & arg1)\n{\n    Q_UNUSED(arg1);\n    int cursorPosition = ui->lineEditAscii->cursorPosition();\n    on_btnAscii2Hex_clicked();\n    ui->lineEditAscii->setCursorPosition(cursorPosition);\n}\nvoid HexEditDialog::on_lineEditUnicode_textEdited(const QString & arg1)\n{\n    Q_UNUSED(arg1);\n    int cursorPosition = ui->lineEditUnicode->cursorPosition();\n    on_btnUnicode2Hex_clicked();\n    ui->lineEditUnicode->setCursorPosition(cursorPosition);\n}\n```\n. Yeah, that should do it.\nThis is the interface for the QLineEdit I'm working on now. I have also moved all the text handing from the HexEditDialog into the new widget.\nSee: HexEditDialog.cpp\n```\nclass HexLineEdit : public QLineEdit\n{\n    Q_OBJECT\npublic:\n    enum class Encoding\n    {\n        Ascii,\n        Unicode\n    };\nexplicit HexLineEdit(QWidget *parent = 0);\n~HexLineEdit();\n\nvoid keyPressEvent(QKeyEvent* event);\n\nvoid setData(const QByteArray & data);\nQByteArray data();\n\nvoid setEncoding(const Encoding encoding);\nEncoding encoding();\n\nvoid setKeepSize(const bool enabled);\nbool keepSize();\n\nvoid setOverwriteMode(bool overwriteMode);\nbool overwriteMode();\n\nsignals:\n    void dataEdited();\nprivate slots:\n    void updateStyle();\n    void updateData(const QString & arg1);\nprivate:\n    Ui::HexLineEdit *ui;\nQByteArray mData;\nEncoding mEncoding;\nbool mKeepSize;\nbool mOverwriteMode;\nint mMaxLength;\n\n};\n```\nGot any remarks? I haven't worked with Qt before so I might have missed something.\n~~Now I only have to figure out how to overwrite the keyPressEvent handler correctly, so that I can toggle between insert mode and overwrite mode.~~\nEdit:\nGot it working so far. The only issue I found so far is that there is no visualization of when the line edit is in overwrite mode. The base paintEvent handler looks quite complicated. I doubt I can implement this with my Qt knowledge.\nI pushed the changes to my fork:\nhttps://github.com/Atvaark/x64dbg/commit/b77f701d50701b57103a2f3146d5e27ffde3e268\n. Text editors visualize the mode they are in.\nIn insert mode a blinking beam will be displayed and an in overwrite mode either a blinking line or a blinking rectangle is used to display which character will be overwritten next.\n. I also looked at this a few hours ago and came up with the same solution.\n1.\nYou can also call refreshSearchList in the on_checkBoxRegex_toggled function.\n2.\nI noticed that when a search text is entered and the refresh button is clicked the process list doesn't even refresh.\nOpen notepad and enter 'notepad' in the text box.\n\nClose notepad and click refresh.\n\nYou have to clear the text, hit refresh and reenter the text right now. Does using changing mCurList to mList in AttachDialog::refresh() fix that issue?\n. You mean you can't reproduce the 2nd issue I mentioned? \nI didn't test it with your changes in AttachDialog::refresh(). Replacing mCurList with mList probably fixes that issue. I can test your changes later but I'm sure it works correctly now.\n. Yeah it's possible.\nRestoring a tab will add it back at the rightmost position on the bar. (Just like when you close  the window of a detached tab).\nMaybe we could insert the detached/closed tabs in same position they previously were in (if possible). e. g. Visual Studio tries to restore hidden windows that way.\n. It shouldn't. But the context menu will show actions that work with multiple selected rows (e. g. disable breakpoints) and with single rows (e. g. edit breakpoint).\nThe single row actions will target the last selected row.. > Are the self assignments in expandUp and expandDown intended? They may cause warnings with certain compiler flags or static analysis tools\nThanks for noticing. I pushed a fix that shouldn't cause any compiler warnings.. I pushed the fix for mIsMultiSelectionAllowed.. That wasn't intended, since that warning was mentioned above. I thought I pushed the fix for that.\nWould you mind removing the two lines or should I create another PR?. Go ahead, Removing the two lines will fix these issues.. I don't think so, since the reference view doesn't derive from StdTable, but from StdSearchListView.. ScyllaHide should suit your needs.. That's the hotkey to clear the screen in many command line terminals. Via the clear/cls command.\nBut I also know some programs that use ctrl-x to clear lists (fiddler and process monitor for example).. ",
    "MulleDK19": "I second this.... .exe and DB: db.zip\nNop the instructions at 1400012A4 then try to assemble MOV RBP,RSP at 1400012A5 (don't forget to install the db). I only tried analyzing, which did not help.\nIn either case, I don't see why type analysis would mess up the disassembler. Or rather, why it should.\nAlso, another issue I'm having, which I'm not sure if is because I'm doing something wrong or is a bug, but the Structs tab doesn't work at all. Neither Parse Header nor the AddStruct command. Nothing ever shows up in the tab despite it saying \"Types parsed\".. @mrexodia Not a dup, and still broken. You can't go to an address in a dump windows unless they're attached. Going to an expression in a detached dump will go to the expression in the active attached dump. If all dumps are detached, the entire application crashes.. Surely a bug shouldn't be worked around with a plugin.\nThe s format specifier is next to useless because it won't list 30% of strings. Even some strings longer than 1 character are still shown as ???.\nIt should at the very least assume ASCII if determination fails.. But if I'm logging a value as a string, it's because I know it's a string, not because I have an idea that it may sometimes be a string.\nIn my case I was logging operator names, of which quite a number of them are one character. A lot that were 20-30 characters of pure ASCII characters were logged as ??? as well.. So what is the point of s if not to log strings? It's quite useless for anything, except for figuring out how bad the heuristics are.. Just ran the breakpoints again. My number was wrong. It fails on 61.9% of the strings. 1628 out of 2628 fails. Strings such as \"min\", \"max\" and \"atan2\". The longest string it fails on is 38 characters long, consisting purely of a-Z.. leaderboardRequestRowsGlobalAroundUser, address was 0x000000000bb237d0.\n000000000B9C0000  0000000000200000                                                                                                              PRV    -RW--        -RW--.

It looks very similar to \"Dark Theme\" \nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/wiki/Color-Schemes\na cool idea would be a combobox with diffrent themes .. too much work ? :x. @mrexodia No just allow others to add a .ini with the theme color and the combobox would see the .ini if thats possible.. cant think of how myself :x. Confirmed bug. Iam using same build now and same issue everytime.\nWell you can for example run Scylla which apparently is not a plugin, sorry my bad.\nBut having that running while closing x64dbg itself will make it crash.\ni can include a sample plugin iam coding on.\nInternetSandbox.zip\ngoto settings plugins->InternetSandbox->Settings and a form will show\nwhen its open, close x64dbg itself not the form.\n. Form close during \"DLL_PROCESS_DETACH\" fixes the bug, but Scylla still has the \"bug\"\ni might have spoken about this bug before with @mrexodia . Iam guessing @mrexodia would want a sample where this is happening :). ",

    "Mattiwatti": "Where are you people getting these magical NtQueryInformationProcess's that return a cookie for any HANDLE other than NtCurrentProcess? I have Windows 7 and even with debug privileges and a PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS handle I can't query the cookie of another process.\nI checked in IDA to be sure, and not only does the handle need to be to the current process, it literally has to be (HANDLE)0xFFFFFFFF. Any other value gives STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER (0xC000000D), even if it is a valid (non-pseudo) handle to your own process. I checked ReactOS since the comment in MemDecodePointer references it, and they have the same implementation:\nC++\nif (((ProcessInformationClass == ProcessCookie) ||\n    (ProcessInformationClass == ProcessImageInformation)) &&\n    (ProcessHandle != NtCurrentProcess()))\n{\n    /*\n     * Retrieving the process cookie is only allowed for the calling process\n     * itself!

Disassembly of ntoskrnl.exe shows that you can now do it if you have 0x20 = PROCESS_VM_WRITE access. I don't have Windows 8 to try so I can't say what happens there, but it definitely doesn't work for me on 7.\n. Well on my Windows 7 VM I got around it by simply patching ntoskrnl.exe to always set the cookie to a constant 0 regardless of who is calling the function. Of course this is insane, but that VM has so many kernel patches by now that there is no concept of security left anymore anyway. Amazingly enough this works totally fine: not only does the OS boot, I tried running some protected unpackmes and none of them noticed this strange implementation of EncodePointer. On XP I got the same result which is even funnier because RtlEncode/DecodePointer on XP is simply ptr ^= cookie.\nAnyway, I'm guessing the above approach is a bit extreme for most people, so I tried doing the same thing in ScyllaHide (it already has an NtQueryInformationProcess hook) and that seems to work perfectly fine also, though I only tried it on a dummy VEH program. Though you might run into issues if early system DLLs (ntdll, kernel32) store encoded pointers before ScyllaHide hooks the syscall and then try to decode and reuse them later. I don't know if they do this.\nUnfortunately, short of hooking NtQIP or patching the kernel it doesn't seem like there are many other options. Anything related to SEH/VEH goes through [Rtl]Decode/EncodePointer, and those are just wrappers for NTQIP anyway. One alternative might be to create the target process suspended and use CreateRemoteThread/NtCreateThreadEx to obtain the cookie from ntdll remotely before resuming the main thread. But... that doesn't actually sound better at all, does it? Eurgh.\nIf your target allows for it I would stick to just adding some assembly with Multimate to retrieve the cookie at process start and then jmp back to OEP. But I can't think of any way to do it by only changing the pointer decode function in x64dbg.\n. The cookie in KUSER_SHARED_DATA is a different one; it's system-wide and used by Rtl[Encode/Decode]SystemPointer. The SEH/VEH cookie is per-process. Both cookies are write-once and set by the kernel, but the per-process cookie can only be queried by the process that owns it.. Having looked at this problem some more, there seem to be some convenient aspects to the way ntdll does process initialization that might make this solvable:\n- The earliest code that runs in every user mode process is the LdrInitializeThunk APC, which (eventually after some basic checks) ends up in the real initializer LdrpInitializeProcess. (LdrpInitializeProcess is also the function that calls LdrpDoDebuggerBreak, the 'system breakpoint', but that happens much later).\n- The very first thing LdrpInitializeProcess does is call RtlSetUnhandledExceptionFilter with an argument of... 0. This is what RtlSetUnhandledExceptionFilter looks like:\nasm\nRtlSetUnhandledExceptionFilter proc near\nsub     rsp, 28h\ncall    RtlEncodePointer\nmov     cs:RtlpUnhandledExceptionFilter, rax\nadd     rsp, 28h\nretn\n- You can probably see where this is going. RtlpUnhandledExceptionFilter now contains a value that was encoded with a known input, so we can get the cookie back from this.\nI think it should be possible to automate this retrieval in the debugger engine, so that the cookie value will always be known without a need for hooking or injection. It's also more reliable because there is no chance for DLL initializers to install exception filters before the hook is in place.. OK, this bug is killing me....\n\nI tried this on my regular Windows 7 installation: no repro, as expected from @mrexodia's findings, I could modify both the high and low parts of ymm0-15 fine.\nI then tried it in a Windows 10 RS4 VM, and the bug immediately reproduced. Still no surprises so far, Windows 10 is an OS that's broken beyond repair and this sort of thing is more the rule than the exception.\n...But after I switched back to Windows 7, I discovered that the bug was still occurring there, even though it worked fine before! Rebooting doesn't help, nor does disabling VT-x/VT-d in the BIOS, flashing the entire BIOS from scratch, wiping the CMOS, or even reinstalling Windows.\n\nThe CPU is a Core i7 6700K (Skylake), and the hypervisor used is VirtualBox. I've also used the edit FPU dialog many times in the past without issues (though probably only in Windows 7). I guess I will have to buy a new CPU now since you broke it. Thanks a lot guys.\nAnyway, the relevant call stack (caller at top) seems to be:\n- x64dbg.dll!setfpuvalue(string, value)\n  - TitanEngine.dll!SetContextDataEx(hActiveThread, IndexOfRegister, NewRegisterValue)\n    - TitanEngine.dll!_GetFullContextDataEx(hActiveThread, titcontext, avx)\n      - if (avx) TitanEngine.dll!GetAVXContext(hActiveThread, titcontext)\n        - GetThreadContext\n    - (value of to be updated register is copied...)\n    - TitanEngine.dll!_SetFullContextDataEx(hActiveThread, titcontext, AVX_PRIORITY)\n      - (another GetThreadContext...)\n      - SetThreadContext\n      - if (AVX_PRIORITY) TitanEngine.dll!SetAVXContext(hActiveThread, titcontext)\n        - GetThreadContext\n        - SetThreadContext\nI can't see anything wrong with the TE code per se, but that's mostly because it's doing so much unnecessary work that it's hard to make out what is really going on. But it also doesn't help that the AVX/XSTATE API in Windows is nearly nonexistent apart from a single 10 year old MSDN page.\nIt seems to me that for this specific case (setting a single value, or even setting ymm0-ymm15 all at once) there should be no need to call both GetThreadContext and SetThreadContext more than once each. I get that SetContextDataEx is supposed to be a generic multipurpose function, but this is still something that reeks strongly of doing it wrong to me. Not that I have any better suggestions at the moment - I'll have to read up on the XSTATE API (or lack thereof). And you'll be hearing from my lawyer about that 6700K.. It is definitely possible that it is an Intel specific bug. Using AVX correctly (meaning, making your code faster with it, and not slower) on Intel CPUs is actually pretty difficult for a bunch of reasons:\n- Mixing legacy SSE code and 256/512 bit AVX instructions has a severe performance penalty on mainstream Intel CPUs (Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, Broadwell) because the CPU needs to switch the register file to a different state (a complete tragic description of these states and their transitions can be found in 13.2 of Agner Fog's optimization guide). The movd xmm1, eax in the OP is an example where this would happen. Changing this to vmovd would significantly improve performance if this was some performance critical piece of code, for no obvious reason at all to the programmer. But wait! There's a simple fix! If you simply issue vzeroupper or vzeroall after finishing AVX execution, the penalty won't be incurred. But wait! On the Knight's Landing platform these instructions cost 36 clock cycles, so definitely don't do it there. On Skylake on the other hand it is not costly, but neither is the SSE/AVX transition anymore. So you can skip it on Skylake if you want. Simple stuff right?\n- In order to save power, CPUs that support 256 or 512 bit operations actually run at half of their potential most of the time by turning off the upper execution unit bits, so a 256 bit operation will become two sequential 128 bit operations, making AVX much slower. This penalty goes away after a 'warm up' period, after which the CPU decides that hey, maybe this guy actually really needs the performance, and it enables full 256/512 bit operations for a while.\n- In kernel mode, you have to manually XSAVE before starting any AVX execution and XRESTOR afterwards, in order not to automatically zero the upper part of future expansions to AVX, like the zmm registers that were added in AVX512. This alone makes it hardly worth it to even bother at all. This is not specific to Intel by the way, but it does suck.\n- Unaligned memory access (vmovups) is much slower than aligned access (vmovaps) on pre-Nehalem CPUs, but there is almost no difference between the two on newer architectures.\n- 'AVX512' is not really actually a thing, because it consists of many subsets of loosely related instructions that are all supported by some CPU, but no CPU supports all of them. Quoting Agner Fog again (13.3, emphasis mine):\n\nThere are several additional extensions to AVX512. All processors with AVX512 have some\nof these extensions, but no processor so far has them all (writing in 2018). The known and\nplanned extensions to AVX512 are the following:\n - AVX512F. Foundation. All AVX512 processors have this. Includes operations on 32-\nbit and 64-bit integers, float and double in 512-bit vectors, including masked\noperations.\n - AVX512VL. Includes the same operations on 128-bit and 256-bit vectors, including\nmasked operations and 32 vector registers.\n - AVX512BW. Operations on 8-bit and 16-bit integers in 512-bit vectors.\n - AVX512DQ. Multiplication and conversion instructions with 64-bit integers. Various\nother instructions on float and double.\n - AVX512ER. Fast reciprocal, reciprocal square root, and exponential function.\nPrecise on float; approximate on double.\n - AVX512CD. Conflict detection. Find duplicate elements in a vector.\n - AVX512PF. Prefetch instructions with gather/scatter logic.\n - AVX512VBMI. Permutation and shift with 8-bit granularity.\n - AVX512IFMA. Fused multiply-and-add on 52-bit integers.\n - AVX512_4VNNIW. Iterated dot product on 16-bit integers.\n - AVX512_4FMAPS. Iterated fused multiply-and-add, single precision\n\nIntel added about as many instruction sets to x86 as the total number of individual instructions I can memorize on a good day. And then gave them all the same name without equipping CPUs with them equally. Bizarre. I imagine compiler developers are really fucking loving this too. Edit: searching for LLVM commits whose message contains 'AVX512' gives 2502 results. Lol.\nAs for what (if anything) did actually happen to my CPU I'll probably never find out. I would say it is highly unlikely that something actually changed in the hardware somehow due to executing some specific sequence of instructions. I'd much sooner suspect some bug in the kernel (IMO the chance of these existing is pretty high if you look at the list above...) - but the problem with this explanation is that I was running a VM at the time, so how could it have affected my machine? Really odd. Not that it's actually an issue (apart from this bug in x64dbg which I definitely didn't have before). I compile all my software (including x64dbg, LLVM and VirtualBox itself) with /arch:AVX2 and the CPU is overclocked to 5 GHz, so if there actually was a problem I think I would have noticed by now :smile:. Personal opinion: I don't care what the specific address is, the disassembly view only shows the symbolic name and I'm fine with that too. If I really need the address for some reason I can still always choose to follow the name in either view and copy it from there.\nIn this specific case (screenshot above) I wouldn't even mind if the order of the two entries was reversed, since it is very rare that I want to view the IAT address rather than the call target. Pressing ENTER while standing on this line will also go to the call target (in the CPU view, not dump). But this would probably lead to inconsistent/confusing behaviour compared with other instructions that have a 'follow' menu entry.. Heh, yes, the info box is basically exactly what I'm looking for, except under the mouse pointer. The difference is small (a hover vs hover + click), but the tooltip preview way still just seems to work much faster for me.\n. That blog entry has the right idea; unfortunately he has some incomplete type info which (for me at least) caused the heap enumeration to crash, and since the code uses hardcoded pointer offsets instead of types, I don't really feel like figuring out the cause.\nThe Process Hacker headers should help if you're interested in using the method from the blog with proper type info:\nRTL_HEAP_ENTRY\nRTL_HEAP_TAG\nRTL_HEAP_INFORMATION (DEBUG_HEAP_INFORMATION in the blog)\nRTL_PROCESS_HEAPS (blog: HeapInfo)\nRTL_DEBUG_INFORMATION (blog: DEBUG_BUFFER)\nThe following ntdll functions are needed:\n```C++\nNTSYSAPI\nPRTL_DEBUG_INFORMATION\nNTAPI\nRtlCreateQueryDebugBuffer(\n    In_opt ULONG MaximumCommit,\n    In BOOLEAN UseEventPair\n);\nNTSYSAPI\nNTSTATUS\nNTAPI\nRtlDestroyQueryDebugBuffer(\n    In PRTL_DEBUG_INFORMATION Buffer\n);\nNTSYSAPI\nNTSTATUS\nNTAPI\nRtlQueryProcessDebugInformation(\n    In HANDLE UniqueProcessId,\n    In ULONG Flags,\n    Inout PRTL_DEBUG_INFORMATION Buffer\n);\n```\nI would say using ntdll functions for heap enumeration is preferable to CreateToolhelp32Snapshot and co by far. They may be undocumented but at least they work. (and are orders of magnitude faster.)\nRe: RtlpQueryProcessDebugInformationRemote and pausing: I know ntdll expressly creates this thread using NtCreateThreadEx with THREAD_CREATE_FLAGS_HIDE_FROM_DEBUGGER set in order to prevent these kinds of issues. Whether that is enough to prevent all problems I don't know. I recall at least one instance when I found out a program was deadlocked because of an RtlQueryProcessDebugInformation call that was issued by another process.. Yes, that's what I thought as well. THREAD_CREATE_FLAGS_HIDE_FROM_DEBUGGER is very powerful, to the point where a thread with the flag set may even be ignored when a process suspend is issued (though don't quote me on this), but it's not enough to start execution in a process that's already suspended, which would be the case here. I know because I wrote an implementation of NtCreateThreadEx for the XP kernel once, ironically with the purpose of banning this flag altogether as a ScyllaHide-type hook, and I ended up having to special-case the ntdll debug heap query thread to essentially give it godmode powers to prevent issues with suspended threads. (and processes, which from the kernel's POV are nothing more than processes containing only suspended threads, though it may lie and say each thread's individual suspend count is 0).\nThere's no reason why RtlpQueryProcessDebugInformationRemote couldn't be implemented out-of-process using ReadProcessMemory however. You'd simply have to calculate the offsets, basically like the guy in the blog already did minus the crash, and then issue a ReadProcessMemory for each individual node and block. It would be slower, but not by that much; NtReadVirtualMemory is very fast (it doesn't really care if the virtual address you're reading is in your own process or another one after it has performed the access checks). This would allow doing the enumeration in the debugger while the debuggee is suspended. It might be preferable to do it this way regardless since it removes the dependency on the ntdll imports. You'd still be reliant on the undocumented heap node structure layout, but that struct hasn't been changed in a looong time. I'm not saying I have a copy of the leaked NT4 source from 1995 because that would be illegal, but if I did, I might find the exact same struct as the one linked above in there.. Sure. A ProcessHeap in the PEB is what's returned from RtlCreateHeap:\n```C++\ntypedef struct _RTL_HEAP_PARAMETERS\n{\n    ULONG Length;\n    SIZE_T SegmentReserve;\n    SIZE_T SegmentCommit;\n    SIZE_T DeCommitFreeBlockThreshold;\n    SIZE_T DeCommitTotalFreeThreshold;\n    SIZE_T MaximumAllocationSize;\n    SIZE_T VirtualMemoryThreshold;\n    SIZE_T InitialCommit;\n    SIZE_T InitialReserve;\n    PRTL_HEAP_COMMIT_ROUTINE CommitRoutine;\n    SIZE_T Reserved[2];\n} RTL_HEAP_PARAMETERS, *PRTL_HEAP_PARAMETERS;\nNTSYSAPI\nPVOID\nNTAPI\nRtlCreateHeap(\n    In ULONG Flags,\n    In_opt PVOID HeapBase,\n    In_opt SIZE_T ReserveSize,\n    In_opt SIZE_T CommitSize,\n    In_opt PVOID Lock,\n    In_opt PRTL_HEAP_PARAMETERS Parameters\n    );\n``\nYou can ignoreCommitRoutineAFAIK since it's normally set to a function that doesxor eax,eax, retn`.\nThe fact that RtlCreateHeap returns PVOID is telling though; I wouldn't be so sure the internal layout of the struct that is returned is unchanged between OS versions. Your best would probably be starting with this:\n_HEAP as defined in ReactOS\nand going from there to see if the definition is still correct. Fortunately it looks like you'll only need the first couple of fields which are least likely to have changed.\nRelevant sources:\nRtlCreateHeap\n...which ends up calling...\nRtlpInitializeHeap. I just realised the code in the blog entry was based on 32 bit disassembly, so it's no wonder my attempt to run it failed, since I compiled as 64 bit which wouldn't mesh well with the hardcoded offsets. (NB: ReactOS headers are prone to this too: there are often ULONG fields that should be ULONG_PTR or SIZE_T, but this isn't so easy to find out when you're disassembling 32 bit code.)\nI recompiled as 32 bit and it worked. Some notes:\n- RtlQueryProcessDebugInformation works even when the debuggee is paused.\n- The results from the two methods are not 100% identical: compare CreateToolhelp32Snapshot output and RtlQueryProcessDebugInformation output (diff). The extra blocks CreateToolhelp32Snapshot found all looked like valid entries to me. Don't know what's up with that.\n- As expected, the RtlQueryProcessDebugInformation method is many times faster (basically instant). CreateToolhelp32Snapshot stalled x64dbg for a good second even though I was only running calc.exe.. If you are interested in bringing back the heaps view later, here is a version of the heap block enumeration code from the blog that uses the PH types I posted above:\n```C++\nbool GetFirstHeapBlock(PRTL_HEAP_INFORMATION curHeapNode, HEAPINFO *hb)\n{\n  PRTL_HEAP_ENTRY entry = curHeapNode->Entries;\nwhile ((entry->Flags & 2) == 2)\n  {\n    hb->index++;\n    hb->addr = (duint)((unsigned char*)entry->FirstBlock + curHeapNode->EntryOverhead);\n    entry = entry + 1;\n    hb->size = entry->Size;\n  }\n// Update the flags\n  if ((entry->Flags & 0xF1) != 0 || (entry->Flags & 0x200) != 0)\n    hb->flags = 1;\n  else if ((entry->Flags & 0x20) != 0)\n    hb->flags = 4;\n  else if ((entry->Flags & 0x100) != 0)\n    hb->flags = 2;\nreturn true;\n}\nbool GetNextHeapBlock(PRTL_HEAP_INFORMATION curHeapNode, HEAPINFO *hb)\n{\n  // Make it point to next block address entry\n  hb->index++;\n  PRTL_HEAP_ENTRY entry = (PRTL_HEAP_ENTRY)(curHeapNode->Entries + hb->index);\n  if (entry == NULL)\n    return false;\nif ((entry->Flags & 2) == 2)\n  {\n    do\n    {\n      // New address = current block address + overhead\n      hb->addr = (duint)((unsigned char*)entry->FirstBlock + curHeapNode->EntryOverhead);\n  // If all the blocks have been enumerated, exit\n  if (hb->index > curHeapNode->NumberOfEntries)\n    return false;\n\n  hb->index++;\n  hb->size = entry->Size;\n} while ((entry->Flags & 2) == 2);\n\n}\n  else\n  {\n    // New address = previous address + previous block size\n    hb->addr = (duint)(hb->addr + hb->size);\n    hb->size = entry->Size;\n  }\n// Update the flags\n  if ((entry->Flags & 0xF1) != 0 || (entry->Flags & 0x200) != 0)\n    hb->flags = 1;\n  else if ((entry->Flags & 0x20) != 0)\n    hb->flags = 4;\n  else if ((entry->Flags & 0x100) != 0)\n    hb->flags = 2;\nreturn true;\n}\nbool HandlesEnumHeaps(std::vector & heapList)\n{\n  typedef PRTL_DEBUG_INFORMATION(NTAPI RTLCREATEDEBUGBUFFER)(ULONG MaximumCommit, BOOLEAN UseEventPair);\n  typedef NTSTATUS(NTAPI RTLQUERYPROCESSDEBUGINFORMATION)(HANDLE UniqueProcessId, ULONG Flags, PRTL_DEBUG_INFORMATION Buffer);\n  typedef NTSTATUS(NTAPI *RTLDESTROYQUERYDEBUGBUFFER)(PRTL_DEBUG_INFORMATION Buffer);\n  static auto RtlCreateQueryDebugBuffer =\n    (RTLCREATEDEBUGBUFFER)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandleW(L\"ntdll.dll\"), \"RtlCreateQueryDebugBuffer\");\n  static auto RtlQueryProcessDebugInformation =\n    (RTLQUERYPROCESSDEBUGINFORMATION)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandleW(L\"ntdll.dll\"), \"RtlQueryProcessDebugInformation\");\n  static auto RtlDestroyQueryDebugBuffer =\n    (RTLDESTROYQUERYDEBUGBUFFER)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandleW(L\"ntdll.dll\"), \"RtlDestroyQueryDebugBuffer\");\n  if (RtlCreateQueryDebugBuffer == NULL || RtlQueryProcessDebugInformation == NULL || RtlDestroyQueryDebugBuffer == NULL)\n    return false;\n// Create debug buffer\n  PRTL_DEBUG_INFORMATION debugInfo = RtlCreateQueryDebugBuffer(0, FALSE);\n  if (debugInfo == NULL)\n    return false;\n// Get process heap data\n  NTSTATUS status = RtlQueryProcessDebugInformation((HANDLE)fdProcessInfo->dwProcessId, /PDI_HEAPS | PDI_HEAP_BLOCKS/ 0x14, debugInfo);\n  if (status < 0 || debugInfo->Heaps == NULL)\n    return false;\n// Go through each of the heap nodes\n  PRTL_HEAP_INFORMATION heapNodes = debugInfo->Heaps->Heaps;\n  HEAPINFO hb;\n  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < debugInfo->Heaps->NumberOfHeaps; i++)\n  {\n    // Enumerate all blocks within this heap node\n    memset(&hb, 0, sizeof(hb));\n    if (GetFirstHeapBlock(&heapNodes[i], &hb))\n    {\n      do\n      {\n        heapList.push_back(hb);\n      } while (GetNextHeapBlock(&heapNodes[i], &hb));\n    }\n  }\nRtlDestroyQueryDebugBuffer(debugInfo);\n  return true;\n}\n``\nSince the hardcoded offsets are gone, this now works on 64 bit. Unfortunately the output is still close to but not exactly the same as that ofCreateToolhelp32Snapshot. I've narrowed this down to blocks following LF32_FREE blocks with size 0 (they cause the rest of the blocks in the node to be skipped), but haven't been able to fix it.. Yes, contrary to what I expected this works when the debuggee is paused. It's the power ofNtCreateThreadExwithTHREAD_CREATE_FLAGS_HIDE_FROM_DEBUGGER.. Ah, of course I found the \"change command line\" menu option right after posting this issue. IMO it doesn't really belong in the debug menu though since it's a property of the process startup, not execution. (Not technically true since you can change the command line in the PEB during execution which x64dbg does, but most programs will receive a copy of this command line which the CRT makes so it can callmain(argc, argv)with the proper arguments.) Also you still have to launch the program at least once with no parameters before you can set them, assuming you're using the 'Open' button from the GUI and notinitdbg` or launching x96dbg.exe with a command line set directly. Honestly my suggestion would be to just remove this button completely, the Debug menu is large enough as it is.\nI'm OK with leaving the TitanEngine API intact, I was merely wondering if it would be a problem to break it. The InitDebug family of functions can simply forward to the new one. (Please help me think of a better name than InitDebugExEx or InitDebugEx2 though...)\nChanging the environment variables is a good suggestion and easy to do. This would close #947, and if the environment variables are made to inherit from the parent process by default it could also close #948.\nMy would-be API currently looks like this:\nC++\nNTSTATUS\nNTAPI\nPsCreateProcess(\n  _Out_ PHANDLE ProcessHandle,\n  _Out_ PHANDLE ThreadHandle,\n  _Out_opt_ PCLIENT_ID ClientId,\n  _Out_opt_ PPEB *RemotePebAddress,\n  _In_ PUNICODE_STRING ImagePath,\n  _In_ PUNICODE_STRING CommandLine,\n  _In_ PUNICODE_STRING WorkingDirectory,\n  _In_ ULONG ProcessFlags,\n  _In_ ULONG ThreadFlags,\n  _In_opt_ PVOID Environment,\n  _In_opt_ HANDLE ParentProcess,\n  _In_opt_ HANDLE Token,\n  _In_opt_ ULONG SessionId,\n  _In_opt_ PVOID DebugPort,\n  _In_opt_ ULONG NtGlobalFlag,\n  _In_ BOOLEAN NotifyCsr\n  );\nAs you can see it's very much NT-style, not Win32, so it's not possible to just replace calls to CreateProcess with this. However most of the arguments are either optional or trivially convertible, so it would be pretty easy to change InitDebug and co to use this. The biggest difference is the return value which is an NTSTATUS, and I'd really rather keep it that way because the various native calls involved all return NTSTATUS. It is trivial to convert an NTSTATUS to a Win32 error for use with SetLastError, but the other way around doesn't work so well and much of the error information is lost doing this.\nI haven't looked into this much, but I believe the DebugPort parameter could be used to implement debugging of child processes to close #792.\nMy preferred approach would be to leave this API basically as is and put it in a separate module (say TitanEngine.Debugger.Launch.cpp) since the implementation is fairly big and the function itself doesn't really need to be aware of any debugging being done. The various InitDebug functions including the to-be-added new one can then just call this with ProcessFlags = DEBUG_PROCESS | DEBUG_ONLY_THIS_PROCESS like they already do with CreateProcess now.. Yeah, GetProcessIdOfThread == NtQueryInformationThread(ThreadBasicInformation). I can add it if you want, I just figured there should be some way to get the PID that I'm not seeing, since it's pretty relevant information for a debugger.. I said under 1 ms, not 1 ms :)\nI just profiled it with a high accuracy timer and it came in at 0.159 ms per call (this is on a Core i7 6700K). I expected the constant memory allocations to be a contributing factor, but 99.46% (!) of the time was used by NtQuerySystemInformation itself. It's a really expensive syscall.\nOne thing that could be done is change the signature of ThreadGetWaitReason to ThreadGetWaitReason(std::unordered_map<DWORD, THREADINFO>&) and call it once in ThreadGetList with the thread list so it could do all the thread ID comparisons in one go. If it could also have the PID from somewhere that would be nice, but I wouldn't do an NtQueryInformationThread for it if it can be helped. I wouldn't bet money on another added syscall being faster than just doing a few hundred integer comparisons.. No that's fine, it's (hopefully) working as intended now. I did change the unordered_map& to a THREADLIST*, since that contains both the thread count and the actual struct to put the wait reasons in. This one isn't gonna end up on my C++ hall of fame, what with the triple nested loops (one of which is a while (true)) but I blame MS for that for the terrible design of NtQuerySystemInformation.\nBtw, there is a new ThreadSystemThreadInformation class for NtQueryInformationThread now which should return 1 thread struct instead of N process structs * M thread structs for the entire system. But it requires Windows 10, so I'll pass on that one.. I did consider changing getSymAddrName, but I saw there was an open issue re: performance problems with dbghelp's SymFromAddr which would probably be called a lot this way, no? Though I have no issue with it otherwise of course. Same for the symbolic name styles.\nRe: symbol undecoration: I had it set to the default used throughout the rest of x64dbg, but it was resulting in some ridiculously long comments that were giving me a horizontal scrollbar and/or getting truncated because of the maximum buffer length. Hence why I changed it to the shortest possible.\nThe stack in the screenshot above was generated with RtlVirtualUnwind by the way, not dbghelp as I'm not a fan of it either. Unfortunately RtlVirtualUnwind is only available on x64 due to how SEH information is stored.... Oh yes, that's right. I was getting it mixed up with ModNameFromAddr which is called all the time in DebugUpdateGui, but that function doesn't involve dbghelp unless source debugging is enabled.\nI'd definitely be in favour of changing the default for C++ unmangling to something less verbose. But it's hard to say what a good default is, because what's useful information depends on the context. I'd say a simple ClassName::FuncName would actually be sufficient in most cases though.\n- Calling convention: this can occasionally be useful depending on what you're debugging. But normally it's simple enough to tell from the call site what the calling convention is. I also wouldn't care much for seeing it in the call stack view. It's more useful in the disassembly.\n- private,protected,public,virtual,static, ... all of these can be done away with if you ask me. They are high level language constructs that are relevant when programming in C++ or whatever language, but not at the instruction level.\n- Parameter types: can be useful, but if there are a lot of them it becomes unreadable quickly. (That's why I like xAnalyzer, it neatly separates them by line). Not sure about this one.\nFWIW, WinDbg agrees with my naming scheme ;) Sample undname output:\nNTSTATUS __stdcall LRPC_CASSOCIATION::AlpcSendWaitReceivePort(ulong,_PORT_MESSAGE *,_ALPC_MESSAGE_ATTRIBUTES *,_PORT_MESSAGE *,unsigned __int64 *,_ALPC_MESSAGE_ATTRIBUTES *,_LARGE_INTEGER *)\nBecomes:\nkd> u fffff880`0110d0b0\n    msrpc!LRPC_CASSOCIATION::AlpcSendWaitReceivePort\nRe: stack walks and dbghelp's crappiness: I was hoping Clang/LLVM would be able to do this. I know their MSVC compatibility has gotten very good recently, and that includes support for exception handling which must mean they can unwind stack frames properly. But I haven't been able to find anything on using the LLVM APIs to do this programmatically. So either it's well hidden or it's only meant for runtime exception handling and not debugging/call stack analysis. Shame, because I used LLVM for some simple analysis and name demangling once and it was really easy to install and use given how much it can do (like static analysis - IMO it would be pretty awesome to be able to use Clang/LLVM's static analysis from the debugger).. Yeah, that looks like it should work. Another alternative is what LLVM-Symbolize does in LLVMSymbolizer::DemangleName(), which looks like a pretty elegant solution to me. Basically it really comes down to\nC++\nif (name[0] == '?') // Mangled C++ name\n  return UnDecorateSymbolName(name, VARIOUS_FLAGS); // <-- dbghelp\nif (isx86Module())\n  return demanglePE32ExternCFunc(name); // <-- defined in the same .cpp\nreturn name;\nThe only real difference I see at a first glance is __imp stuff, I'm not sure if LLVM deals with that.\nIt probably wouldn't be a bad idea to compile a list of garbage names that can come out of various linkers (not only MSVC's, though that one is probably most important), see what the Demangle() output is for each and adjust accordingly.\nAs for the pull request, I believe (sans the demangling) df0c75ac03d1dcb9721e2e40116ce30f6d923bb7 already did most of the work for me. My only suggestion would be to change the \"return to x from y\" to simply \"y\". That would make it a lot more readable IMO since atm each name is listed twice. (This is only for the call stack view tab, the CPU call stack should probably keep it to better distinguish stack frames from values that happen to be a function pointer.). isx86module() means 'PE is IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_I386'. extern C functions don't get the extra decorations (underscores etc) on x64 AFAIK.. Oh yeah, I took a look at what LLVM does to print stacktraces, but that didn't give me much hope. They have two methods (which one is used by default I don't know):\n- StackWalk64 using dbghelp, which is exactly what x64dbg does\n- A wrapper function for RtlCaptureStackBackTrace (which is a wrapper for RtlWalkFrameChain which in turn is a wrapper for RtlVirtualUnwind at least on x64, I don't know how it is handled on x86.)\nThe problem with the RtlCaptureStackBackTrace method is that it needs to be done in the context of the thread for which you are requesting the stack. This makes it impossible to do on another thread from user mode. For the stack in the screenshot I used a kernel driver that injects an APC in the target thread, walks its frame chain and then copies back the results (hence why there is a kernel stack portion...)\nDo you have an example for me where dbghelp produces a bogus stacktrace? I can use RtlWalkFrameChain/RtlVirtualUnwind to see if it makes a difference. It might be that dbghelp also uses these calls under the hood. In that case it wouldn't really matter anyway.. Only on 32 bit, not 64? Best would be a reproducable bogus stacktrace on x64, since my hack driver uses RtlVirtualUnwind which is x64 only. I can call RtlCaptureStackBackTrace but that only gives you a Rip/Eip chain, no stack pointers.\nIf the bogus stacks only manifest on 32 bit, then that would most likely be explained by the differences in SEH, for which x64 has static unwind tables baked into the PE. If it also happens on x64 it's worth checking out if RtlVirtualUnwind does a better job there.. 0x00400000 = SYMFLAG_PUBLIC_CODE.\nThese ones seem to be missing from MSDN:\n```\ndefine SYMFLAG_NULL                0x00080000\ndefine SYMFLAG_FUNC_NO_RETURN      0x00100000\ndefine SYMFLAG_SYNTHETIC_ZEROBASE  0x00200000\ndefine SYMFLAG_PUBLIC_CODE         0x00400000\n```\nI'm getting this from the Windows SDK dbghelp.h.. Try the following:\n- Windows key + R, type services.msc and hit enter\n- Go to 'Windows Font Cache Service'\n- Set it to disabled and stop it.. As a followup, here is the guilty stacktrace:\n\n(this is the x32dbg.exe main thread)\nFor some reason win32k.sys keeps looking something up in the font cache infinitely. (But it's not stuck doing it, because PeekMessage does return.) However what the actual underlying cause is I don't know. win32k.sys is well known for being a buggy piece of shit, but there could also be something else at play.\nI actually had some trouble reproducing the stacktrace after disabling the font cache, because even after re-enabling it I could still set the breakpoint and step. I had to reboot to get it to hang again.\nEdit: I made a new stacktrace after fixing my symbols, because the offsets were fishy. So now it looks like it doesn't have anything to do with the font cache at all - even though disabling it did fix the problem for me. Huh?!. The CPU utilization does seem to be pretty random; when I get a hang with a stacktrace like above I have one fully utilized core, but I can also produce hangs in win32k.sys!xxxRealSleepEx (or whatever the name is) where it really does seem to be blocking on something and the CPU utilization is 0.\nSome other interesting stuff:\n- WinDbg is also affected by this! Furthermore it doesn't matter if you use the X86 or the X64 version (the X64 version of WinDbg is the only debugger I know that can debug Wow64); both will hang just like x32dbg does.\n- I managed to fish out an... interesting... stacktrace from the debuggee thread with 13506 stack frames:\n0, smokeweed.exe!KiDeliverApc+0x1e3\n1, smokeweed.exe!KiCommitThreadWait+0x3dd\n2,

byondcore.dll!DungPager::Login+0x1 actually aren't abnormal for a debugged thread, but mfc120.dll seems to need to dispatch a LOT of messages.... The process definitely seems to be using some anti-debug protections: the attach breakpoint gets overwritten to cause an AV, and there are various pages containing syscall stubs that syscalls get routed through via exception handlers (mfc120.dll involved? My bet is yes.) On an x86 OS it will simply patch KiFastSystemCall to intercept all syscalls. This gave me a nice BSOD when the AFD device was ZwClosed incorrectly. Perhaps they should stick to writing user mode code.\nAnyway, anti-debug isn't new, the question is how are they managing to deadlock debuggers this way? I gave it a quick look in a kernel debugger but nothing stood out: there are no pending IRPs or ALPC messages, and the ERESOURCE win32k is trying to get does eventually get acquired exclusively without shared waiters.. I noticed that too, I have one thread with a start address of Qt5Core.dll!QThreadPrivate::start calling it, but it doesn't seem to actually be doing anything (it's blocking in WaitForMultipleObjects indefinitely). In any case I don't think Qt is to blame as WinDbg is also affected.\nbyond.exe does call SendMessage/DispatchMessage/PeekMessage from multiple threads (the ones that start in mshtml.dll), which seems like a very dumb thing to do, but I don't see how that could affect the event loop of the debugger. Even assuming some global shared resource (win32k.sys does have many of those), suspending the thread that owns the resource should result in a session-wide deadlock, which isn't the case because only the debugger process locks up.\nI tried deadlock detection with the driver verifier but it turned up nothing, other than locks -v showing that the ERESOURCE x32dbg.exe is acquiring has 11K waiters... but they are all exclusive. There would only be a deadlock if the resource was held shared and someone then tried to acquire it exclusively.. Hmm, nothing in there that I can see. STATUS_BREAKPOINT is certainly odd, but the stack traces are unfortunately useless...\nJust to make sure, this is a dump of ida.exe crashing while running with WinDbg as the debugger engine? I might try if I can reproduce, but I doubt I'll have more luck.\nI tried a clean x86 installation of Windows 10 yesterday because I got tired of Wow64 crap in the stacktraces. Same for Qt really, so I chose WinDbg as the victim debugger because it has a GUI from 1985 and most definitely only 1 window thread. The only reproducible interesting finding was this:\n\n(Just to be clear, this is a separate LdrGetProcedureAddress from the ones before it, it did this every time right before hanging, long after already having loaded)\nNot sure if this is really meaningful or just a red herring though. But one theory could be that:\n- byond.exe registers for a callback message using TrackMouseEvent to know when the mouse enters or leaves its window (or even the login button area)\n- Some process (CSRSS? dwm.exe?) is meant to deliver this message to byond.exe but can't, because all its threads are frozen by the debugger\n- The debugger is somehow blocked on the above\nWho knows though. Another thing I found was dwm.exe creating two ghost windows (one for windbg.exe, one for byond.exe), but terminating the dwm thread and the ghost windows didn't help and I also couldn't reproduce it.. After spending much more time on this than I reasonably should have, I believe I have finally isolated the cause, namely the following sequence of calls:\n\nThe purpose of the first three should be obvious. After retrieving the current thread ID and that of the foreground window, the exe calls AttachThreadInput, which (quoting MSDN, because you cannot make this up) \"attaches or detaches the input processing mechanism of one thread to that of another thread.\" This is probably the dumbest function I have ever seen in the entire Win32 API, and I have seen a lot of them.\nSince the foreground window will often be the debugger window (or any other fucking window, because it's a PC and Windows has had multitasking since the early 90s), this will bind the input processing of the debugger to the thread that owns the byond.exe main window. When a breakpoint hits, this thread predictably stops responding to all input events and the debugger cannot progress because its input is no longer being processed.\nSince NtUserGetForegroundWindow is only called infrequently, I applied the following fairly harmless patch:\n\nSince it probably isn't immediately obvious from the name, all this does is make the function exactly the same as GetActiveWindow. In other words, this makes byond.exe think it is the foreground window even when it isn't. I would have preferred to simply return FALSE from AttachThreadInput, but the app didn't seem to like that. If you need accurate NtUserGetForeground behaviour you can probably think of a better patch.\nAnyway, with this patch applied I can no longer reproduce the hang with any debugger on any version of Windows. Hopefully it's the same for you guys.\nI guess technically this is a win32k.sys bug, in that AttachThreadInput should be cancelled upon suspension of the thread processing the input, because this will always block the second thread. But the real solution would be to remove the API from Windows and fire whoever came up with it.. Glad it worked!\nIt's funny Raymond Chen shares my feelings re: AttachThreadInput. He usually spends much of his time defending (or explaining the reason for) quirky Windows behaviour that in hindsight was actually implemented for pretty good reasons. He has a The Old New Thing book full of these things that is really interesting to read. But in this case it seems we can all agree that this API was bad from idea to concept to implementation.\nBy the way, this is a bit off topic, but since I spent a lot of time with a kernel debugger attached throughout this, here are some anti-debugging techniques I found used by this exe that you may want to be aware of @Maktm:\n- Two different timers (a winmm.dll realtime priority thread and NtQueryPerformanceCounter) to check for inconsistencies\n- Kernel debugger checks (NtQuerySystemInformation)\n- Debug port/debug flags checks (NtQueryInformationProcess)\n- Standard IsDebuggerPresent/PEB checks\n- Heap flags checks\n- NtClose(0xINVALID)\n- NtAllocateVirtualMemory with the MEM_WRITE_WATCH flag followed by constant NtQueryVirtualMemory calls to check the region for SW BPs\n- NtGetContextThread for HW BPs\n- C++ exceptions/console CTRL+C exceptions (I actually think these were the reason for exposing the bug - the app triggers an exception, forcing you to press SHIFT+F9 in the debugger, and then immediately checks the foreground window)\n- Code in executable pages that is later 'downgraded' to RW or R only or just freed. There are also many DLLs with exactly 1 private page which indicates they were written to, but I don't know of a good tool to check what was modified exactly.\n- Constant use of SEH to transfer execution control. Combined with frame pointer optimizations this makes the stack trace often completely useless. I found running gflags.exe /i byond.exe +ust (explanation) to help somewhat with this. The stack is still useless but you can fish out more interesting info because ntdll is constantly walking the frames. gflags.exe /i byond.exe +sls is also good - a lot of spam at startup, but the app makes heavy use of GetProcAddress so you can see what it is trying to do.\nSince I have a pretty heavily modified kernel (or rootkit if you prefer) that is sort of a combination of ScyllaHide and TitanHide, I actually have the ability to circumvent all of these. It was the fact that this didn't matter at all which lead me to believe this bug (probably) isn't an anti-debug measure, but that the programmers of the app are just stupid.. Keep in mind that they use a lot of heavyweight libraries (DirectX, mshtml, jscript9) that may be doing their own thing for their own reasons, so not all of these are necessarily from byond.exe/byondcore.dll itself. But there are too many of these checks for it to be a coincidence.\n\nBtw, what do you mean by\n\nSince I have a pretty heavily modified kernel (or rootkit if you prefer)\n\n\nMy ntoskrnl.exe isn't exactly vanilla: a lot of the system calls that are known to be used for anti-debugging are modified to notify me through the kernel debugger when an application flagged as 'bad' is doing something questionable. For example, here is a kernel debugger log of the exe from startup until hitting the login breakpoint. (Ignore the NULL addresses for NtWriteVirtualMemory, that's a bug I need to fix...). Clang is more picky about wanting fully qualified types (though I'm not sure why this affects templates in particular - maybe someone with knowledge of the C++ standard could chime in). Initially I was working around this as follows:\nC++\ntemplate <class U, class V>\nstruct Derived : Base<V>\n{\n  typedef Base<V> Base;\n}\nand then calling each method in the inheritance chain with Base::Func(). (The typedef is optional, but usually makes it more readable.) This got especially bad in serializablemap.h though where there are many small structs in a deep inheritance chain, so you end up with something like Base::Base::Base::Func(). Looking at that I thought I must be doing it wrong, so I tried simply calling it as a member function which worked. I assume MSVC applies the this-> under the hood. I don't think any pointers are actually dereferenced for either compiler though (at least not here), since the inheritance chain can be resolved at compile time.. Happy St Patrick's day!\nWhen the bug comes back, can someone turn on PNG compression for the 64x64 and 128x128 icons? I once had a coworker who would have literally murdered me for wasting so much disk space.\n\n. Of course, but you have to admit it looks funny ;) Over 50% saved! What will science think of next?. This should be quite easy to do, assuming Windows accepts self-signed certificates for uiAccess='true' applications. The way I do this is having two certificates: one self-signed root CA certificate placed in the trusted root store (this one is never actually used except to create the second certificate), and one certificate issued by the root CA (this one does not need to be installed anywhere). I've been signing executables this way for years now and it has always works fine (drivers are another story - compare signtool verify /v /ca filename.exe with signtool verify /v /kp filename.sys).\n1. Sign x64dbg.exe or x32dbg.exe with the code signing certificate:\nsigntool sign /v /ph /fd sha256 /s My /n \"MyCertName\" /sha1 \"MyCertSha1Hash\" /tr \"http://sha256timestamp.ws.symantec.com/sha256/timestamp\" /td sha256 x64dbg.exe\n2. 'Install' x64dbg in C:\\Program Files by copying over the bin\\x32 or bin\\x64 directory to e.g. C:\\Program Files\\x64dbg.\nEdit: forgot step 0: obviously add uiAccess='true' to x64dbg as well as @mrexodia said, otherwise the whole thing is pointless.. @mrexodia: wouldn't the write access issue be solved by setting `requireAdministrator=true' as well? I mean, you're already giving a UAC prompt anyway.. Yes, that's true. You need quite a lot of pieces together to make the whole thing work...\nIt could be 'solved' by making a x64dbg_admin.exe (or _uiaccess.exe...) which is equivalent to the normal exe except having <requestedExecutionLevel level='requireAdministrator' uiAccess='true' />. Since x64dbg is normally digitally signed (unless you are building from source), that would solve some of the issues. You'd still need to put x64dbg in Program Files however. But I don't really think the added confusion of having two separate .exe files would help very much, especially since 99% of users won't encounter this scenario. (But it might wrongly make people think they need the second .exe to debug programs as administrator, which is false.)\nI found this random snippet (have not tested) on https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsdesktop/en-US/4d2e1358-af95-4f4f-b239-68ec7e2525a9/uiaccess-in-manifest-files?forum=windowssecurity:\n\"Regardless of the state of the uiAccess flag, your application will always be able to send messages/drive input to windows of applications running at privilege levels equal to or less than your own privilege level.\"\nSo potentially it would be possible to create a non-admin user, run TeamSpeak as that with right click -> run as, and then debug it. But then we're back to the original response, which is to just launch the exe first and then attach, which is by far the easiest solution anyway.. Btw, I just remembered it is possible to have an external manifest, i.e. x64dbg.exe.manifest. (removing the current one from the PE resource section). I'm not sure if this approach would work however, since it seems rather weak from a security POV to have the application's manifest editable by anyone...\nOTOH, I do remember a case where I had an application that depended on a 2 MB Armadillo DLL for licensing stuff, but they didn't actually need it (in the API/programming sense) and none of the binaries were linked against it, so instead they added it as a 'dependentAssembly' in an external .manifest file. I circumvented this complicated DRM scheme by deleting the .manifest file, which worked...\nEdit: some issues to be aware of when using the external .manifest approach. I have a 2012 R2 VM but can't reproduce. I tried a snapshot from a few months ago as well in case it was fixed recently, but same result.\nI doubt the Scylla message has anything to do with it, that's just Scylla being paranoid because it doesn't recognise Server 2012 R2.. I can't reproduce this issue, but I did notice the PDB in the zip is a 'partial' PDB (from the dumb /DEBUG:FASTLINK switch that was made the default in VS2017). dbghelp.dll 10.0.15063.0 sees this and tells you it can't use the PDB file. dbghelp 8.1 (which comes with x64dbg releases) doesn't recognise this type of crippled PDB.. \nThis is the only correct value of this field.. It's easy to change the default behaviour for this if you want to. But if the default was to ignore exceptions after changing EIP, programs would behave differently when being debugged than when not being debugged. This would lead to other bug reports due to unexpected breakages (much more vague ones than this, because the different behaviour would likely only manifest in some other place). And second it would expose an easy anti-debug weakness as @mrexodia said.. The call chain is different for me, it goes SetWindowsHookExW -> SetWindowsHookExAW -> _SetWindowsHookEx -> NtUserSetWindowsHookEx. But CTRL+R does give me _SetWindowsHookEx when I stand on NtUserSetWindowsHookEx, all the way back to SetWindowsHookExA/SetWindowsHookExW.. Re: the idea of using CSRSS as a trampoline to duplicate kernel mode protected DRM process handles mentioned on IRC: that won't work. The same mechanism that is responsible for notifying kernel mode drivers of NtOpenProcess calls (ObRegisterCallbacks) can be used in the same way for NtDuplicateObject (= DuplicateHandle), or in fact any system call involving a handle that the driver wants to monitor. That is apart from the fact that opening a useable handle to CSRSS itself is no longer possible since Windows 8.1, even with debug privileges enabled like in this PR. I wrote PPLKiller because of this. It should already be linked in the wiki, but it's not exactly a solution for everyone since it runs in kernel mode. Generally speaking, trying to circumvent any sort of kernel mode restriction from user mode is going to be a very big waste of time.. How about something like this?\n```C++\nifndef _NTDLL_H\ndefine _NTDLL_H\npragma once\nifndef DBG_WANT_UNDOCUMENTED_APIS\npragma message(\"Careful! ntdll.h is included but DBG_WANT_UNDOCUMENTED_APIS is not defined.\")\nendif\n```\nThe only part I don't like is using #pragma message as I believe it's nonstandard, but MSVC doesn't support #warning which better states the intent. Or even #error could be used, I think it's standard C and it's not like the error would be hard to fix if you do need ntdll.h.. @blaquee Yep, you're right, process hollowing is exactly what the original executable did/does. Although it was written by myself with no malicious intent (no more than the usual anyway.) That said I did manage to get a 100/100 'malicious' score with it on hybrid-analysis. Ah, anti-virus companies, will they ever learn...\nThe problem my executable has is the following: if I unmap the original image from the child process, things tend to go poorly (though this seems to be somewhat random - it does occasionally work), even if the original image base and the new one are in no way near each other address-wise. On the other hand, attaching a debugger to a suspended process none of whose threads have ran yet wil have side effects due to the DbgUiRemoteBreakin thread ntdll starts (due to it now being the first thread to run in the process). I'm not sure if this problem can really be solved, though WinDbg does have a good recovery considering the messed up state of the process. Maybe I can do something with WriteProcessMemory to set ghetto breakpoints without use of a debugger.\n@mrexodia Do you mean DbgChild? Or are Dreg and Drew two different similarly named people? (as that's the only child process debug plugin I could find.) I took a look at it, and wow that is a complex plugin o.O I hope nobody tells him about NtCreateProcess and NtCreateProcessEx for his sake or it will be a full fledged OS soon :P. Small update on this: it is in fact possible to get the process back into an attachable state after unmapping the original executable. However this does require relocating the replacement image to the base address the original image was loaded at. After adding code to handle the relocation, the 'hollow' executable can now host MATLAB and Photoshop, and x64dbg can attach with no issue. So the key seems to be that any replacement code must have the same base address as the SEC_IMAGE the kernel created the original process with. SetThreadContext doesn't help against this, so manual relocation is needed.. First clue it's a Windows bug: WinDbg is affected too.\nSecond clue: Windows 7 works fine.\nI wonder which component could possibly be responsible? The file which, if you type its name into Google, is followed by the suggestions 'BSOD' first and 'exploit' second? Surely not that one?. winload.exe has subsystem type IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_WINDOWS_BOOT_APPLICATION, it can't be started with CreateProcess. It is the boot application responsible for loading the kernel and HAL and not a 'normal' Windows EXE file. That said, you can still debug it in x64dbg if you want to, you just need to change the subsystem type to 0x3 (console) and the MajorOperatingSystemVersion/MajorImageVersion/MajorSubsystemVersion fields to something like 6.0 instead of 1.0.\nIf you're looking for rootkits in there I don't think you will find any though, the exe in your zip has a valid SHA256 signature from Microsoft and matches the file on my Windows 10 VM.. How about just making x64dbg able to debug processes of any subsystem instead? :)\nAlmost all of the restrictions on what executable images you are allowed to run are only imposed by CreateProcess. I just tested this by adding an InitNonWin32Debug API to TitanEngine that uses the native API instead of CreateProcess, and this allowed to me to debug native subsystem executables (csrss.exe/smss.exe), driver images, EFI boot loaders and even DLLs! (meaning the DLL is the actual process image and there is no 'loader' executable).\nHere's bootmgfw.efi running with no modifications. Note it is of subsystem IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_EFI_APPLICATION, has a MajorOperatingSystem value of 0 and is in fact a DLL according to its file characteristics.\n. Yes, pretty much, at least in that the TitanEngine function for this would be using NtCreateUserProcess and a bunch of other native APIs to bypass the CreateProcess restrictions.\nI have sort of lost hope that #1463 will ever become a reality, at least for launching regular console/GUI processes. The problem is that other than creating the kernel process and initial thread, CreateProcess is also responsible for notifying the session's csrss.exe of the new process. This is done through an LPC request (additionally accompanied by an array of pointers that has to be allocated in a shared section) containing three different flags fields, a handle to the file backing the newly created process, all sorts of details such as the machine type and PEB address (two in the case of WoW64) that CSRSS could easily query for itself, and even inane stuff like the VA and size of the manifest if one is present, because SxS runs inside CSRSS! If you get even a single part of this wrong you simply receive an error status like STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER, and good luck debugging it because attaching a debugger to your session's CSRSS locks up the system.\nDespite all this I do actually have code that can start regular processes this way on Windows 7/8/10, but not on XP and only on x64, and Jupiter probably has to be in the right phase too or something. Since MS seems to change the size and layout of the message struct with every OS update as well, maintaining all this would be a nightmare.\nNote that all of this only relates to telling CSRSS about the process. The actual process and thread creation part is (relatively) easy, and CSRSS doesn't need to be aware of a process for it to be able to run. The process will be heavily restricted in what it can do though, because any sort of user interaction (mouse/keyboard input, creating a console, showing anything on the screen...) requires a connection to the CSRSS LPC port. Thus you would be limited to DbgPrint or else something like named pipes for IPC to communicate with the outside world.\nThe function I added to TitanEngine is a lot more modest; in fact it has exactly the same signature as InitDebugW. The idea is that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for InitDebugW when CreateProcess fails, to retry the process create. Something like:\nC++\nif ((processInfo = InitDebugW(path, cmdLine, dir)) == NULL)\n{\n  // check if the error matches known BS ones from CreateProcess, and if so, retry\n  if (isBogusStatus(GetLastError())\n    processInfo = InitNonWin32DebugW(path, cmdLine, dir);\n}\nThis sidesteps the CSRSS problem (which isn't very relevant here, because CSRSS actually checks the subsystem anyway and rejects the connection if the process isn't CLI or GUI), while still allowing starting and debugging processes of any subsystem type.. I've created a PR in the TitanEngine repository to add the above API: https://bitbucket.org/titanengineupdate/titanengine-update/pull-requests/12\nAfter some more testing I was surprised to find out that many 'regular' (CLI/GUI) processes also work perfectly fine when launched this way. It turns out there is a CsrLazyProcessRegister function in csrsrv.dll that will still do some of the work for you if you didn't send an LPC request on process creation. It still rejects images with subsystems other than CLI or GUI though. This would actually have been a fatal flaw (ntdll!LdrpInitializeProcess terminates the process if it can't connect to CSR), but ntdll actually skips the connection attempt when it sees the subsystem is not CLI or GUI, because it thinks that must mean the process is csrss.exe. Funny.. I would leave the existing initial behaviour as is, meaning this:\nC++\n//start the process\nif(bFileIsDll)\n  fdProcessInfo = (PROCESS_INFORMATION*)InitDLLDebugW(gInitExe.c_str(), false, gInitCmd.c_str(), gInitDir.c_str(), 0);\nelse\n  fdProcessInfo = (PROCESS_INFORMATION*)InitDebugW(gInitExe.c_str(), gInitCmd.c_str(), gInitDir.c_str());\nThis will simply work in 99% of cases, so no need to change it.\nIf the call fails, we can filter by error code. GetLastError() results from CreateProcess can be divided into two categories: bullshit and non-bullshit. Non-bullshit errors are real errors returned by the kernel (meaning NtCreateUserProcess fails, e.g. when you try to create a protected process from a non-protected process). Bullshit errors are all errors set by kernel32 for some other reason after the process has already been successfully created. After setting such an error, kernel32 terminates the process and makes it look like it was never there.\nIncomplete list of bullshit errors:\n- ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED Most likely a real error, but can be a process create deny from either one of the hilariously dumb \"AppCertDlls\" or \"WinSafer\" checks (which can be caused by malware)\n- ERROR_GEN_FAILURE Possible return value of \"AppCertDlls\" check if the check itself fails. Yes really.\n- ERROR_NO_MORE_FILES I don't even know how this happens\n- ERROR_PROC_NOT_FOUND Misleading - comes from \"BasepCheckWinSaferRestrictions\" and doesn't have anything to do with missing imports\n- ERROR_CHILD_NOT_COMPLETE Subsystem not CLI/GUI\n- ERROR_BAD_EXE_FORMAT Image version mismatch, or the file is a DLL. Can also be a legitimately invalid exe of course\n- ERROR_CANCELLED VERY misleading error set if \"BasepCheckBadapp\" returns STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED. Almost seems to be on purpose\n- ERROR_ACCESS_DISABLED_WEBBLADE Hilariously bad security check done in user mode after the process has already been created\n- ERROR_ACCESS_DISABLED_WEBBLADE_TAMPER Variant of same\nSxS bullshit errors:\n- ERROR_FILENAME_EXCED_RANGE [sic]\n- ERROR_RESOURCE_DATA_NOT_FOUND\n- ERROR_RESOURCE_TYPE_NOT_FOUND\n- ERROR_RESOURCE_NAME_NOT_FOUND\n- ERROR_RESOURCE_LANG_NOT_FOUND\n- ERROR_MUI_FILE_NOT_FOUND\n- The entire ERROR_SXS_* range (>= 14000, <= 14110)\nThere is one exception: ERROR_ELEVATION_REQUIRED really means what it says and using NtCreateUserProcess won't help. I think the reason this error isn't returned by the kernel is because it requires parsing the XML manifest.\nUnfortunately as you can see the intersection of the sets of real and bullshit errors is non-zero (especially ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED is likely to be real). But in most cases this should be accurate.\nIf the error code is one of the above, we can log the first error and retry the process create attempt with InitNativeDebugW. If that fails too, the error was real so no need to log it again. If it succeeds, we should probably add a warning to the log that the process was created natively and that it may have unexpected issues or just not run at all.. Re: DLL debugging: there is something to be said for using NtCreateUserProcess for DLL debugging instead of the current loader behaviour. This way the process is actually the DLL and not a container. However this would require changing the entry point, since DLLs normally expect to start in\nint DllMain(HINSTANCE Module, ULONG FwdReason, PCONTEXT Reserved);\nwhereas NtCreateUserProcess will give\nNTSTATUS NtProcessStartup(PPEB Peb);\nThis could be worked around: start the process, allocate and write a small loader stub in it, make the stub call DllMain with the module base (obtainable from the PEB), FwdReason = DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, and NULL for the reserved parameter since no one uses it anyway, and finally use NtSetContextThread to change the entry point of the thread before resuming it.\nOf course this is a giant hack, but so is using a loader program whose only purpose is to call LoadLibrary. Maybe the DLL debugging behaviour could be added as an option in the settings?. Since I'm a rebel I have always stubbornly ignored the advice in the wiki, and it has been possible to compile x64dbg with VS2015 for as long as I can remember, as well as with VS2017 and even Clang/C2 3.8 (with some fixes) when those came out. So I'm going to out on a limb and say your Qt binaries don't match the x64dbg binaries you have compiled.\nIf you lifted the Qt DLLs from the release distribution, this will never work because those DLLs are compiled with VS2013. You'll have to compile Qt from source (this is a nightmare by the way). If you did already compile Qt from source, my guess would be that an accidental mismatch still slipped in, it's possible with Qt's 10000 configuration options. At the very least your QMAKESPEC (= compiler) and Windows SDK version should match the ones you're using to compile x64dbg.. Wow, that's a kinder response than I would have given to this report @mrexodia.. Looking at the dump file, the crash is pretty clearly caused by a plugin and not x32dbg:\n0:017> kb\n # ChildEBP RetAddr  Args to Child              \n00 0a7df874 09f49944 0eedfade 00000001 00000007 KERNELBASE!RaiseException+0x62\nWARNING: Stack unwind information not available.

Thanks! I'll verify the fix and close the issue as soon as the PR gets merged. (Not doubting the fix works - it's just that any git command involving more than fetch or pull, especially with more than one remote, tends to somehow destroy my hard drive. I swear it's not me that's incompentent, it's git.). I tried this myself expecting it not to reproduce, but I actually got the same results, and (same as you) inconsistently. The code being debugged doesn't seem to matter, I tried it with a\nasm\nnop\nxor eax,eax\nret\nexecutable and could still reproduce the error. Same for x64dbgpy or no x64dbpy.\nThe correct stacktrace is this:\nRPCRT4!ReceiveMessage+0x210\nRPCRT4!LRPC_CASSOCIATION::IoCompleted+0x53\nRPCRT4!LrpcIoComplete+0x58\nntdll!TppAlpcpExecuteCallback+0x2b8\nntdll!TppWorkerThread+0x772\nKERNEL32!BaseThreadInitThunk+0x1d\nntdll!RtlUserThreadStart+0x38\nwhere the top frame may or may not be present depending on the Windows version used (and offsets will differ of course). But after looking at the disassembly I'm pretty sure this will reproduce on Windows 7 too. The status is definitely STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE. This is actually a very common return value from NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort when you are calling it from multiple threads that are queued blocking on NtRemoveIoCompletion with an I/O completion port handle that has been associated with an ALPC port (this is what rpcrt4 does using ntdll!TppWorkerThread). If you have 8 threads running in such an NtRemoveIoCompletion -> NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort loop, and NtClose either the IOCP or the ALPC port handle, all 8 threads will exit immediately. The first thread to call NtAlpcSendWaitReceivePort 'wins' the connection closed message, the remaining 7 will receive STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE since the ALPC port has been closed. (If you really want to you can send 8 'exit thread' commands using NtSetIoCompletion with a magic value, but the NtClose method is simpler and less error prone). It can also happen when you reply to a message using a port handle that has just been closed on the other side, but that's not applicable here.\nSo I'm surprised that this is an error at all. But it definitely does seem to be real error somewhere: on a checked build of Windows, this will actually trigger two asserts per thread. The first is in ReceiveMessage, with a super helpful assertion message:\n&ast&ast&ast Assertion failed: 0\n&ast&ast&ast Source File: minio\\rpc\\runtime\\shared\\sharedutil.cxx, line 230\nThe second is slightly better:\n&ast&ast&ast Assertion failed: !\"Wrong API invoked by caller or internal error\"\n&ast&ast&ast Source File: minio\\rpc\\runtime\\mtrt\\lpassoc.cxx, line 2363\nRPC_ statuses are bollocks. Converting an NTSTATUS to a Win32 error is a capital sin, like converting a PNG to JPEG or a FLAC to MP3.. I just tried this with a pull + recompile of the latest TitanEngine and this particular EXCEPTION_INVALID_HANDLE (in rpcrt4.dll) does indeed seem to be gone. I'm now getting a different one but it seems to be completely unrelated. Or actually, two different ones?\nWin 8.1 checked:\nkernelbase!CloseHandle+36\nx64dbg!'DebugUpdateGuiAsync'::'2'::'dynamic atexit destructor for 'DebugUpdateGuiTask''+76\nucrtbase!_o__execute_onexit_table+D3\nucrtbase!_register_onexit_function+E7\nucrtbase!_execcute_onexit_table+3E\nx64dbg!dllmain_crt_process_detach+4E\nx64dbg!dllmain_dispatch+C0\nntdll!LdrpCallInitRoutine+69\nntdll!LdrShutdownProcess+2B9\nntdll!RtlExitUserProcess+1A6\nkernel32!ExitProcessImplementation+12\nucrtbase!exit+F4\nucrtbase!exit+7B\nx64dbg!__scrt_common_main_seh+129\nkernel32!BaseThreadInitThunk+1D\nntdll!RtlUserThreadStart+38\nWin 7 FRE:\n(huuuuuge stracktrace, all of it in Qt)\nC++\nbool QFSFileEnginePrivate::nativeClose()\n{\n  // ...\n  if ((fileHandle == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE || !::CloseHandle(fileHandle))) { // <-- exception occurs here\n      q->setError(QFile::UnspecifiedError, qt_error_string());\n      ok = false;\n  }\n}\nThere are some differences in environment (first stacktrace has some plugins enabled, second one does not and is with x64dbg compiled in debug mode) but these look like unrelated exceptions to me. And neither is the same as the one in the original bug, I can't reproduce that one anymore.. For both, I first debugged x64dbg itself, and then in x64dbg debugged a nop.exe application, then closed x64dbg. First one is x64dbg debugging x64dbg, second one is Visual Studio.. I don't see how the second one can be anything but a Qt bug to be honest, the last frame related to x64dbg or plugin code is\nC++\nint result = application.exec();\nin main.cpp. All the rest is Qt.. Visual Studio wasn't done giving me exceptions it seems. After continuing I now get the first one on Win 7 too: (screenshot because lazy)\n. I can't reproduce that one :P Though your hypothesis is plausible, god knows what dbghelp does in the background.. OK, instead of hooking I tried using a VM to cheat:\n1. Make a snapshot of a VM with x64dbg debugging x64dbg debugging calc.exe.\n2. Find the value of the handle that is causing the EXCEPTION_INVALID_HANDLE by closing the second x64dbg. (If there is no crash you have to start over and make a new snapshot - I got lucky on the first attempt :P)\n3. Roll back the VM and set a conditional breakpoint on CloseHandle/NtClose where arg.get(0) is equal to the handle value causing the exception.\nThe culprit (after undoing compiler inlining...) seems to be TitanEngine:\nC++\nfor(int i = 0; i < libcount; i++)\n{\n    if(hListLibrary.at(i).hFile != (HANDLE) - 1)\n    {\n        if(hListLibrary.at(i).hFileMappingView != NULL)\n        {\n            UnmapViewOfFile(hListLibrary.at(i).hFileMappingView);\n            EngineCloseHandle(hListLibrary.at(i).hFileMapping);\n        }\n        EngineCloseHandle(hListLibrary.at(i).hFile); // <-- this is closing a semaphore!\n    }\n}\nI double checked in the handle view and the handle being closed really is the TaskThread semaphore. (The actual exception of course occurs later when the TaskThread destructor runs.) Why/how? Well, I dunno, that's for another time.... Ahh that explains! Yes, I do always use the source version from the repository because why do things the easy way? :smile:\nEdit: though now I'm confused how the original exception magically disappeared. Hhmm.... Have you been able to reproduce this recently (the original bug I mean)? Just to state the obvious, updating TE again to include the latest commit fixed the issue we got sidetracked on. But what's weird is that already before that I could no longer reproduce the original rpcrt4.dll exception. Did John Carmack fix it in his sleep or something? /ponder. I ran into the SafeSymCleanup crash as well yesterday while I was having fun with ScyllaHide#46. This one wasn't that hard to figure out IMO :P\n\nThe problem is that x32dbg.exe has two handles to the debuggee process (one received from CreateProcess by TitanEngine, one received from the kernel in the debug loop when CREATE_PROCESS_DEBUG_EVENT occurs). If you close x32dbg while the debugee is running, the process is terminated before SafeSymCleanup is called with the first handle.\nI think there just shouldn't be a duplicate process (and thread) handle to begin with, that just seems like asking for trouble. Unfortunately the process handle is used quite a few times indebugLoopFunction before DebugLoop() is called. So I don't know if the process and thread handles in fdProcessInfo can just be closed at that point.\nAs for fixing the bug, one simple fix would be to simply not call SafeSymCleanup if the process is terminated. Though the reverse order is obviously less hacky. (but I don't know if it's easy to achieve, maybe in cbExitProcess?). Yeah, ideally the first process and thread handle should be closed ASAP. hProcess would then be set to the handle received in CREATE_PROCESS_DEBUG_EVENT when that occurs. The issue is that there are quite a few lines in debugLoopFunction that have a (legitimate) use for the process handle, e.g. checking if the process is Wow64, so we can't just close the handles in TitanEngine right after CreateProcess. There's also\nC++\nvarset(\"$hp\", (duint)fdProcessInfo->hProcess, true);\nwhich I don't know if it can be delayed until later (preferably it would only be done once the second 'proper' handle is received).\nIf the varset can be delayed until later, I think it should be possible to do the rest of the stuff as normal, and then just after the CB_ATTACH plugin callback is called, CloseHandle both handles and set them to NULL. cbCreateProcess would then be responsible for setting hProcess to the correct handle when it is received. (I'm correctly saying plugins don't receive the process handle before CREATE_PROCESS_DEBUG_EVENT happens, right? only the PID as far as I can see.). OK, I created a PR for this and removed the varset (well, moved it to cbCreateProcess). Meanwhile the SafeSymCleanup crash should also be fixed while we wait for dbghelp to be killed off.. D'oh! Now I feel stupid. I've always had the address column set to the exact minimum width required to contain an address.\nI'd still prefer the autocomment not overwrite the symbol name (or otherwise be appended to it); with the address column expanded it feels like a lot of screen real estate is being wasted because most addresses do not have associated symbol names.. Hm, I dunno about tooltips... having them is definitely an improvement over no tooltips, but the address column isn't the first place I'd look for something like this. Of course, after you've seen the tooltip once you'll know where it is so maybe it's not such a big deal. Maybe it could be done in combination with the same mini-arrows that already exist for jump instructions (but pointing sideways)?\n761E79F2 >\nThat way you still have the breadcrumb hint for more info but without the address bar taking up 2-3 times the normal width. It also prevents you from hovering over addresses needlessly because you can immediately see whether or not there will be a tooltip for it.. Offtopic/pointless comment, but maybe there is someone out there thinking \"wait, why do these functions do mov edi,edi in the first place?\" The answer is: they are padding bytes in order to support hotpatching. Microsoft invested millions and tons of developer time making almost every function in Windows (including the kernel) hotpatchable around... Windows XP/2003(?) times. So in theory you shouldn't have to reboot every time Windows Update updates flash player or some stupid DLL that's used by IE. But the grand total of updates that has actually made use of this functionality in reality is about 3.. OK, I've rebased this on top of the DbgGetRegDumpEx commit with some changes to use REGDUMP_V2, and it Works For Me (TM).. Re: GetFileSize: ideally GetFileSizeEx should always be used instead, but this function isn't available on XP. A more universal fix would be\nC++\nIO_STATUS_BLOCK IoStatusBlock;\nFILE_STANDARD_INFORMATION FileInfo;\nNTSTATUS Status = NtQueryInformationFile(FileHandle, &IoStatusBlock, &FileInfo, sizeof(FileInfo), FileStandardInformation);\nAnyway, above is a bit of a side track, since what the code is really doing is asking NtCreateSection for a SEC_COMMIT section that is backed by the pagefile, which is definitely not what you want since it concerns a specific DLL (file) load event. If hFile is INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE, CreateFileMapping should never be called and an error should be returned instead. GetFileSize being a terrible API might exacerbate the problem though because as MSDN says, it can return garbage values that would explain the high pagefile usage.. AFAIK kernel32.dll and ntdll.dll are the only DLLs containing any useful message tables for use with FormatMessageW. The ntdll ones should be queryable in the exact same way as the kernel32 ones. So IMO {winerror@xx} + {ntstatus@xx} is the best choice since I don't think there is a point to passing module names other than those two.. Not sure about the .mui strings. I think that's all done automatically, but I don't have any way to know for sure. Does anyone have a non-English (or at the very least not en-US) Windows installation to try this?\n```C++\ninclude \"ntdll/ntdll.h\"\ndefine MESSAGE_RESOURCE_UNICODE 0x1\nint main(int, wchar_t**)\n{\n  UNICODE_STRING NtdllName = RTL_CONSTANT_STRING(L\"ntdll.dll\");\n  PVOID Ntdll;\n  NTSTATUS Status = LdrGetDllHandle(nullptr, nullptr, &NtdllName, &Ntdll);\n  if (!NT_SUCCESS(Status))\n    return -1;\nconst NTSTATUS ErrorStatus = STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION;\n  PMESSAGE_RESOURCE_ENTRY Entry;\n  Status = RtlFindMessage(Ntdll,\n                        LDR_FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM_MESSAGE_TABLE,\n                        MAKELANGID(LANG_ENGLISH, SUBLANG_ENGLISH_US),\n                        ErrorStatus,\n                        &Entry);\n  if (!NT_SUCCESS(Status))\n    return -1;\nif ((Entry->Flags & MESSAGE_RESOURCE_UNICODE) != 0)\n    printf(\"%ls\\n\", (const wchar_t)Entry->Text);\n  else\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", (const char)Entry->Text);\nreturn 0;\n}\n``\n(obviously changing the arguments toMAKELANGID` as necessary)\nOn my en-US installation this returns an entry with MESSAGE_RESOURCE_UNICODE set and the text\nThe instruction at 0x%08lx referenced memory at 0x%08lx. The memory could not be %s.\nIf I change the language to MAKELANGID(LANG_ENGLISH, SUBLANG_ENGLISH_UK) I get STATUS_RESOURCE_LANG_NOT_FOUND.. Thanks. Is that with MAKELANGID(LANG_CHINESE, SUBLANG_CHINESE_SIMPLIFIED) (which I think is the correct one for zh-CN, correct, me if I'm wrong) or the one above? If it is for zh-CN, then I don't know what's up there, I would expect it to return Chinese text or an error if the lang ID is incorrect, not English.... Forgot to ask, since the text for STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION is a rather... famous... ;) When you get this error from Windows itself, is it in English or Chinese? My dad has a Dutch version of Windows installed and I have occasionally (rarely) seen English messages/blurbs in it.. It looks like MAKELANGID(LANG_NEUTRAL, SUBLANG_DEFAULT) already does the right thing automatically then. The only issue I see is if someone is using e.g. a Spanish version of Windows but has x64dbg explicitly set to en-US. That will affect the rest of the UI language but not the output of RtlFindMessage. Not sure if this is really a big deal though, I expect other programs will have the same issue with system messages.\nIt might be worth passing MAKELANGID(LANG_ENGLISH, SUBLANG_ENGLISH_US) if the UI has been set to en-US instead of the system default? I expect that will be by far the most common language for people who do override the system default, but that's just my gut feeling. Why doesn't x64dbg collect tons of 'anonymous' user data in the background like Windows 10 does? Then we'd know for sure. It's 2017 guys, jeez.. That's an interesting DLL you've got there...\nIt's definitely not true that Snowman doesn't work on DLLs, but I can reproduce the bug with your DLL. At first I thought it was because of the DllCharacteristics being set to big endian (??), but that wasn't it. So then I tried setting the VirtualSizes of the DLL sections to non-zero values (using the values obtained by VirtualAddress of the next section - VirtualAddress of the section, rounded up to SectionAlignment == 0x1000), and that seems to have fixed it (though it probably broke the DLL if an obfuscator is the reason for the zero-sized sections). SMACKW32.zip if you want to try it.\nSo I think the title can at least be narrowed down to 'Snowman doesn't work on executables with PE sections with a virtual size of 0'. Even that is probably exaggerated though, my guess is that it only happens if the section the code you're trying to decompile is in has size 0.. Debugging services is a PITA as they can't be launched the normal way through CreateProcess for several reasons, which is what it sounds like you're trying to do. See Debugging a Service Application for MS documentation on this (naturally focused on WinDbg, but much of it applies to x64dbg too). How painful it's going to be depends mostly on how early you want to start debugging the service. It's a lot easier to attach to a running process. Especially for svchost.exe services I would stay away from Image File Execution Options to 'auto-attach' a debugger, that's a nice way to make your system unbootable if you do it wrong.\nWith WinDbg you can do windbg -psn LicenseManager to isolate one service from others running in the same process and then attach. You'll still be debugging a running service though; if you need control from the first instruction the best way is a kernel debugger.. Check out #1863, pretty sure you're having the same issue.. This is just a guess, but this may be caused by the obnoxious /DEBUG:FASTLINK setting which was made the default in VS2017. See https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/10/05/faster-c-build-cycle-in-vs-15-with-debugfastlink/ for info. To get a non-crippled PDB, you need to either set 'Generate Debug Info' to /DEBUG:FULL or set 'Generate Full Program Database File' to true (they do the exact same thing - brilliant UX design).\nI'm pretty sure dbghelp.dll from the newer Windows 10 SDKs will recognise these PDBs (I don't know if it can get useful info from them, but at least it shouldn't crash). The downside is no more XP support.. I know this is a closed (edit: not closed, just dead) issue and OP seems to be MIA, but in case he does come back: besides x64dbg plugins, make sure to check out the loaded DLLs before and after opening the 'open file' dialog too.\n\nBut since it happens on file dialogs and we presume is not an OS bug, can happen only if something\nhooking this dialogs.\n\nDepending on your definition of 'OS bug' I'd say it actually is an OS bug, because IFileDialog (which Qt uses under the hood) automatically sends out a notification to load shell plugins that you can register for to provide all sorts of 'shell functionality'. You can test this by viewing the loaded DLLs of a new notepad.exe process in Process Explorer and then manually going to File -> Open. On my system this increases the loaded DLL count from 30 to 110, and memory usage from 2 to 16 MB. I obviously don't have 80 plugins installed, but due to the recursive nature of DLL loading this sort of thing blows up pretty fast.\nYou could see this both as DLL injection and, since the DLLs do not get unloaded afterwards, a type of memory leak (you can't 'leak more' by opening more dialogs, but you also can't free the original memory.) winui/shell/appshellintegration under the SDK samples has some examples of this (e.g. thumbnail preview handlers, icon overlays, drag and drop handlers and so on), but I don't know if there is any setting to modify or block this behaviour in a general way (each of these handler types has its own COM GUID).\nEven the following\nC++\nSetSearchPathMode(BASE_SEARCH_PATH_ENABLE_SAFE_SEARCHMODE | BASE_SEARCH_PATH_PERMANENT);\nSetDefaultDllDirectories(LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_SYSTEM32);\nwill not prevent these DLLs from being loaded since they are registered with their absolute paths.\nIn the past I've resorted to hooking my own process's LdrLoadDll to apply some heuristics and return STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED for these types of DLLs after not being able to find any way to stop this from happening. All 3 major browsers load these plugins too and I'm pretty sure they would block them if they could for security reasons alone.. The RTL_CRITICAL_SECTION being a global is not an issue in this case; it's not deleted until the process exits. So that part is OK.\nWhat's strange to me however is the STRONG_ACQUIRE/WEAK_ACQUIRE divide. It seems to me that if you need a critical section for thread safety (definitely the case with dbghelp) that you always want STRONG_ACQUIRE. WEAK_ACQUIRE to me is like saying 'it would be nice if I could have this mutex, but if not, that's fine too'. In that case you might as well not attempt synchronization in the first place since there are no guarantees this way.\nI spent some time debugging this and the crash conditions were always as follows:\n- The main thread is holding a weak lock for SafeSymFromAddr and is in its destructor at ntdll!RtlLeaveCriticalSection -> ntdll!RtlpUnWaitCriticalSection\n- The threadDebugLoop thread is simultaneously trying to obtain a strong lock for SafeSymLoadModuleExW and is in its ctor at ntdll!RtlEnterCriticalSection -> ntdll!RtlpWaitCriticalSection.\nSo this is exactly the same as in the OP. Do note SafeSymFromAddr is by far the most frequently called 'weak acquire' function, so it's possible that if you try this long enough you'll see other functions too.\nThe above in itself shouldn't be an issue AFAICT. The threadDebugLoop thread should simply block until the main thread is done releasing the critical section. And this seems to be supported by the fact that the crash doesn't happen on x64 (at least on my machine). So the kinda annoying conclusion is that I have no idea WTF is really going on. Nevertheless the following change fixes the issue completely for me:\nC++\nBOOL\nSafeSymFromAddr(\n    __in HANDLE hProcess,\n    __in DWORD64 Address,\n    __out_opt PDWORD64 Displacement,\n    __inout PSYMBOL_INFO Symbol\n)\n{\n    -WEAK_ACQUIRE();\n    +STRONG_ACQUIRE();\n    return SymFromAddr(hProcess, Address, Displacement, Symbol);\n}\nI can similarly replace all WEAK_ACQUIREs with guaranteed ones with no ill effect. The commit that added these macros mentions fixing a freeze on attach, but I can't reproduce that. A deadlock in a critical section is really a pathological case IMO since they can be recursively acquired. You typically need to do something pretty bad like terminate a thread while it's holding a critical section to manage to get a deadlock.. Oh yeah, I forgot about the return 0 part. With WEAK_ACQUIRE the function simply returns silently, which the calling code is built to handle. So there's nothing really wrong with it per se, but it does introduce nondeterminism.\nMy best guess is SymFromAddr having some internal side effect and it being (not) called can somehow affect dbghelp behaviour later on. Only on 32 bit of course. Good old dbghelp.. Sorry for the necro, and this isn't exactly a high priority issue anyway, but I read this and I thought it was funny (sorry), so I tried it and got the following error message in the log:\n\nAttach to process failed! GetLastError() = ERROR_IS_SUBSTED: An attempt was made to use a JOIN or SUBST command on a drive that has already been substituted.\n\nThat's literally worse than no error IMO :stuck_out_tongue: \nThe NTSTATUS version is much better:\n\nAttach to process failed! GetLastStatusValue() = STATUS_PORT_ALREADY_SET: An attempt to set a process's DebugPort or ExceptionPort was made, but a port already exists in the process or an attempt to set a file's CompletionPort made, but a port was already set in the file or an attempt to set an ALPC port's associated completion port was made, but it is already set.\n\nTo 'really' fix this, it would also be possible to do NtQIP with ProcessDebugPort (returns 0xFFFFFFFF if process is being debugged). However that requires a process handle and most of that initialization stuff is in TitanEngine. Eh.... You can go to the Symbols tab and select msvcrt.dll from there. Assuming you have PDBs loaded it will show all functions on the right panel (if not, it should still show strcmp as that is an export) and you can view disassembly/set a breakpoint that way.\nI agree with you about the issue btw, I've noticed this a few times with functions that are implemented in different system DLLs under the same name. The CTRL+G dialog seems to know that there are e.g. 3 strcmp's available, but it doesn't say which item in the dropdown belongs to which DLL. Also it seems to take me to the same DLL every time regardless of which one I pick.. What do you mean by \"modify its binary file\"? x64dbg can do this too, here are the steps:\n- Copy x64dbg.exe to asdf.exe.\n- Run asdf.exe and use it to debug asdf.exe.\n- Make your patch, and save it (here comes the genius part)... on top of x64dbg.exe, since that is the exact same file you just copied!\n- You now have a modified version of x64dbg and are on your way to riches and glory.\nI don't speak Chinese, so I don't know what the error message in your screenshot is saying. But the only way I can interpret this thread is as \"why can't I overwrite this executable that is simultaneously running in not in one but two different processes at the same time?\". The answer is: you can't, and in this particular case (screenshot above) you double-can't. Every executable image (including drivers and DLLs) is backed by a reference counted kernel section object, whose refcount will only reach zero after process termination/image unload. Until then, you don't get to write to the file, end of story (*).\n(*) There are some loopholes if you really want to do it, like starting a thread in heap memory, unmapping the image section and then overwriting the original file. I guess that technically counts, even though you killed the process? I dunno.. This is caused by the SetCurrentDirectoryW call in _dbg_dbginit here: x64dbg.cpp@686. The call makes it so that x64dbg.exe, if it exists in C:\\Path\\To\\x64dbg.exe, will always have working directory C:\\Path\\To even if launched from a different directory.\nI'm not sure why that call is there, but SetCurrentDirectoryW is often used to 'fix' DLL loading in cases where SetDllDirectory or AddDllDirectory would be more appropriate (plugin_loader.cpp is an example of this, although it restores the original directory afterwards so you're not as likely to notice). At least on my system this call can be removed with no issue though (and fixes this one), so it's possible that whatever caused it to be added is no longer relevant.. You don't need Python or x64dbgpy to reproduce this though:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\System32>dir calc.exe\n\n Directory of C:\\Windows\\System32\n14-07-2009  03:38           918.528 calc.exe\nC:\\Windows\\System32>C:\\Dev\\x64dbg\\bin\\x64\\x64dbg.exe calc.exe\n```\n(gives 'file does not exist!')\nC:\\Dev\\x64dbg\\bin\\x64>x64dbg.exe x64dbg.exe\n(works)\nAs for init x64dbg.exe, you can just add your x64dbg dir to PATH if you want that to work, no?\nIMO the expected behaviour would be for the first command to work based on System32 being the current directory.. git log returned some interesting results but ultimately pointed me all the way back to 'first commit' :stuck_out_tongue: It was SetCurrentDirectoryA(dir) there, ha.\nThere are a few APIs that do similar-ish but not exactly the same things that can be used to change DLL load behaviour:\n- SetDefaultDllDirectories - it's recommended to call this with LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_SYSTEM32 only in order to prevent DLL preloading attacks, however you need to call LoadLibraryEx with the correct flags to override the search path after this for any DLLs/plugins in the x64dbg dir and the plugins subdir. This entire function and the LoadLibraryEx flags LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_SYSTEM32, LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_USER_DIRS and others are not supported on XP. So this one is probably N/A for now.\n- AddDllDirectory/RemoveDllDirectory: similar, you need to call LoadLibraryEx with LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_USER_DIRS for this to work and neither of these function exists on XP. This is a shame because it seems like the best option to me (add the x64dbg directory, and then add the plugins directory).\n- SetSearchPathMode: this actually only affects SearchPath and the flags are pretty useless (disable, enable or enable | permanent). Windows 7 required, or KB959426 on XP/2003/Vista.\n- SetDllDirectory: same as Add/RemoveDllDirectory, except this only supports one DLL directory. If you set a directory using this, it disables safe DLL search mode for the duration. You can remove the directory again by calling SetDllDirectory(L\"\"), or restore the default search order with SetDllDirectory(NULL). Erm... interesting API design? I'm pretty sure the second is the correct choice since it seems like the only way to restore safe DLL search mode. Despite only supporting one directory it does seem like this should work since the application directory is added to the DLL search path too regardless of the current directory.\nIn order to test SetDllDirectory I set up some files follows:\n- plugin.dll in C:\\PluginDir using static imports from plugin-dep.dll (think x64dbg.dll) and plugin-dep2.dll (think some other DLL the plugin needs that would normally be also be under /plugins). plugin-dep2.dll in the same directory.\n- program.exe and plugin-dep.dll in C:\\ExeDir. program.exe calls SetDllDirectoryW(L\"C:\\\\PluginDir\"); LoadLibraryW(L\"plugin.dll\").\n- Call program.exe from a totally different directory, e.g. C:\\Users\\Matti.\nThis works for me on Windows XP, 7 and 10, so I think plugin loading should work correctly with this. The only drawback is that it requires setting _WIN32_WINNT to 0x0502 (this is 0x0501 for 32 bit atm) even though XP x86 has supported it since SP1. Alternatively GetProcAddress works too.\nAs for init x64dbg.exe... I can't really see a good way to make this work without adding some sort of special-case hack :/ I mentioned PATH, but even if you add the x64dbg directory to that you still have to find the file manually using SearchPath (whose behaviour is affected by registry settings, so probably not a good idea, and someone could also hijack the file you're looking for similar to a DLL preloading attack). Bleh... any ideas?\nTo OP: I forgot to mention this, but init also has a 3 argument version (file, commandline, directory), so as a workaround you can do this if you have the full exe path:\npython\nimport os\nos.system('C:\\\\Tools\\\\x64dbg\\\\release\\\\x32\\\\x32dbg.exe C:\\\\Path\\\\To\\\\prog.exe \"\" ' + os.getcwd()). I don't really care about the 0 entry point thing, sorry.\nI was more interested in the double mapped ntdll breakpoints misbehaving since a lot of protectors are remapping ntdll nowadays. So I rewrote your sample code a bit since I didn't understand the issue at first:\nCode here\n32/64 bit EXEs + PDBs\nHow to reproduce:\n- Run the sample exe and let it reach the EP, then set a BP on NtClose.\n- Press F9\n- The breakpoint will hit in the original ntdll.dll (e.g. at 0x076DA9990 for me).\n- Press F9\n- The same breakpoint will hit again, but at a completely different address, since the second call is to NtClose in the remapped DLL (e.g. 0x3B9990 for me).\nBoth calls will work since as far as the kernel is concerned there is no difference between a DLL and a SEC_IMAGE mapping. In fact, mapping a section image will cause the debugger to receive a LOAD_DLL_DEBUG_INFO event, which probably isn't helping. So how come Process Hacker is able to tell the difference?\n\n...By walking the ntdll loader entry list out-of-process. See PhpEnumProcessModules for the DLLs-only enumeration which is gross enough, and PhpEnumProcessModulesCallback for the truly sickening abomination that also includes mapped files and sections. Note that both of these functions are OS-dependent since the size and members of LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY change with every Windows release.\nI'm guessing the breakpoint identifiers are (at least partially) name-based (and/or with an RVA from the module) to prevent the breakpoints list from being wiped due to relocations? If so that makes sense and seems more important to me than fixing this.\nThe load order of an image is not very useful to distinguish between duplicate DLLs since this load order can be easily manipulated by the debuggee. The 'WinDbg way' is another not-so-hot option: WinDbg simply concatenates the base address to any duplicate module names. Of course, WinDbg doesn't actually bother saving breakpoints anyway...\nI think, as a compromise, (since these 'double mapped' faux images are usually system DLL files) the \\KnownDlls object directory could actually be quite useful. The DLLs contained in this directory are system DLLs that receive the same virtual address in all processes and are only subject to ASLR on the next reboot. smss.exe maps a global section view for each entry in \\KnownDlls as part of the initial session initialization.\n\nSo, it is trivial to determine for a given section mapping whether it (1) has a known DLL name, and if so, (2) whether it has the canonical address of the DLL by comparing it to the \\KnownDlls section handle. We still can't store the DLL base itself as it will change on the next boot, but we can query and store the 'KnownDll-ness' (yes/no) property as part of the breakpoint ID, I think?\nSo possible proposal for at least fixing the POC behaviour:\n- Breakpoint 1, with say, ID { name = ntdll.NtClose } in the example would become breakpoint { name = ntdll.NtClose, KnownDll = true }\n- Breakpoint 2 with duplicate ID { name = ntdll.NtClose } would become { name = ntdll.NtClose, KnownDll = false }\n(I'm assuming symbol names for IDs here, but the same principle applies if the BP identifier is something like the DLL name plus the breakpoint RVA.). Alright alright. Your first PE now runs for me with the above PR applied.. The problem with adding the image base to the module name (unless this name is only used for display/GUI purposes) is that it would break any user breakpoints and patches upon the next start (due to ASLR), no? That said, for display purposes having the base address appended does seem useful.\nIf we make the PE malicious enough this seems like a problem that is not solvable in the general case IMO:\n1. Genuine ntdll.dll gets loaded\n2. Process loads a pseudorandom number (say, between 10 and 30) of ntdll.dlls based on some internal algorithm and maps them as SEC_IMAGE. Note that you can specify a preferred load address, which, assuming the requested address range is not already taken, will work. This 'ASLR-ness' could also be randomized for each module, making some load at the requested base address, and others at a random one.\n3. The process now has X versions of ntdll.dll to choose from (and also to compare memory between to check for hooks/patches).\nIn the face of a PE that does something like the above, do you see any possible way to store the relocation and patch info to the database in a way that is still valid after restarting the executable?. The behaviour I observe is this:\n- If you have the PDB for user32.dll, everything works as before.\n- If you don't have the PDB for user32.dll, some entries do get filled in the dropdown list, but not all. E.g. I get MessageBoxW but not MessageBoxA.\n- Even if you don't have the PDB, if you correctly type the full name (so MessageBoxA and not MessageBox like in the screenshot), the dialog will accept the input even if it doesn't show the function in the dropdown.\nSo it doesn't seem like some fundamental issue with the export name parsing but to me looks like some minor bug with filling in the autocomplete dropdown list entries. I don't know where that happens though.... > An entry point of zero is actually valid (there are some examples in the corkami repository)\nI know, that's what I said ;)\nIMO an entry breakpoint for an image with no entry is nonsensical. Surely there must be an entry before there can be an entry breakpoint? Changing it to the system BP is basically changing the meaning of 'entry breakpoint' to 'system breakpoint' for 0.01% of images. I think it would confuse people more that the behaviour is inconsistent than that it would help anyone. If I want a system breakpoint, I just check the checkbox for that in the options.\nThe 'no-op' fix is also consistent with how the other breakpoint settings work. If I have 'TLS callbacks' checked, but the image doesn't have TLS callbacks, does x64dbg set a BP on the call to LdrpCallTlsInitializers as a replacement instead? No, that wouldn't make any sense.. Ahh, I see. Yes, in that case setting the entry breakpoint 'as late as possible' would have been a good fix. Shame it doesn't work then :/\nWinDbg has something interesting to say about your sample when I tried setting a hardware breakpoint:\n\n0:000> ba e 1 entry0\n    ^ Unable to set breakpoint error\nThe system resets thread contexts after the process\nbreakpoint so hardware breakpoints cannot be set.\nGo to the executable's entry point and set it then.\n\nSo it sounds like the create process callback is the only possible moment to do this?. FWIW, dumpbin does Ordinal 1234, IDA does mfc42_1234. Normally I'd prefer the IDA format because of database compatibility and such, but putting the module name in the export name seems very redundant IMO.\nI prefer Ordinal1234 (so no space, underscore or hash), simply because it's impossible to mistype that way.. This is probably going to be borderline useless given my abysmal knowledge of Win32 GUI programming, but... of the two decent 'window spy' tools I know, one (your Spy++) uses DLL injection to set a hook, and the other (Process Hacker's Window Explorer) uses a fairly convoluted method involving a shared section but which does seem to avoid straight out DLL injection. (NB: I linked to an older commit on purpose as the current PH codebase is completely broken on my machine and this file seems to have been removed as well...). The PH DLL runs in two separate 'modes' (client or server) depending on the process context and these communicate with each other to post/retrieve info on the window proc addresses and such.\nSo compared to this, the x64dbg approach suddenly seems rather tame. Not that I'm complaining :laughing: I'm not sure what the advantage of a hook DLL would be over simply enumerating windows out-of-process; maybe someone can tell me why these tools go to such lengths to enumerate other processs windows this way, no doubt there's a reason for it. But I think any solution requiring either DLL injection or section mapping would more likely fall into plugin territory than x64dbg core functionality.\nOP, is it possible for you to post a small sample app (preferably not malware - if malware, please let me know in advance so I'll use my Windows 10 box) with some steps to reproduce? I'm not 100% clear on what order the process -> window creation is supposed to go, which process owns what window, and which process I should be debugging.. @mrexodia And that in turn was why I was wondering why all these 'specialized'/'good' (admittedly, N = 2) window inspectors that give accurate results seem to need a hook DLL :stuck_out_tongue: (not a rhetorical question, I have no idea.)\nping @reliasn. try/except may very well be how the real loader handles it too... both the UM and KM loader are full of blocks like that. Though I don't have the magical ability to say which blocks require it and which don't. Possibly just one, possibly all of them...\nI haven't got x64dbg on hand here, which directory was it that RtlImageDirectoryEntryToData was giving the bogus results for?. OK, I found the cause, it was a fairly straightforward dirSize > imageSize case and the directory pointer was being dereferenced without checking if that was the case. Essentially the same thing that was already fixed for the debug directory previously. Made a PR.\nI do still get this though, but only when debugging from VS, and if I ignore the AVs everything works fine:\n\nNo problems when debugging the exe straight or debugging x32dbg and then debugging the exe in the second instance.\nI can't download the malware sample from VirusTotal btw, any chance you could check that? I tried downloading it in two different browsers but I just get forwarded to the homepage.. Oh yeah, w.r.t. try/except... according to my 'sources' if you catch my drift, ntdll does indeed wrap access to at least the export directory in LdrpGetProcedureAddress in a try, but only with a finally to do some cleanup. So in this case it would return an uninitialized NTSTATUS value! Keep in mind that my, erm, guesses re: this, are from very old Windows versions so this is likely fixed by now. But yeah, try/except doesn't seem such a bad idea.. I checked out the malware sample; it is indeed quite insidious and I added the range checks in the second commit to fix it. Note that the sample runs OK without the last check added, but it would still be possible to make a PE that exploits the unchecked addressOfNames[i] so I added it as well for good measure.\nThe number of exports itself should be fine I think: it does trigger a 10MB allocation for the vector but that's it. There should still probably be an upper bound on the number of exports though (and imports), but I don't know what. Time to dig up the good ole' PE spec... always assuming it's in the spec, of course...\nvoid* -> ULONG_PTR is always well-defined AFAIK since ULONG_PTR is defined to be an unsigned integral of pointer size. The overflow check is also well-defined because it uses unsigned overflow, not signed overflow which is indeed UB.. Following up - I checked the PE spec and didn't find any mention of a size restriction for either the import or export directories. Even corkami's files don't have something that test this (surprisingly). So I think that 'assume the worst' applies here, i.e. 2^32.\nI'm not too worried about a huge import directory - it would of course be possible to kill x64dbg this way, but in the same way you would also kill the loader meaning the image would never load. For the export directory though, there is something to be said for placing a limit on the number of exports, because the loader doesn't normally parse export directories (unless another file imports from $evil_file). What would be a sensible value do you think?. Adding to this: this is a blog post that uses the unwind data to find an unexported function, but the concept can be easily adapted to something more generically useful such as making use of the RUNTIME_FUNCTION and UNWIND_INFO data to obtain the start and end addresses of e.g. the function EIP is currently in to show the function scope.\n(archive.org link because the site seems to be down) https://web.archive.org/web/20180409202525/https://kbdsmoke.me/obtaining-unexported-function-addresses-using-exceptions/. No, there are two alternatives:\n- #include <ntstatus.h>\n#include \"cmd-analysis.h\n// all other includes\n- // all includes\n#undef WIN32_NO_STATUS\n#include <ntstatus.h>\nSame for the other .cpp. I think the second option (#undef followed by #include) is pretty ugly. I chose this over the first option because that way the file's own header would still be first. But any of the three works.. Ugh, really? :P I can do it of course, but personally I hate the pragma because it conflates compilation and linking and makes any file a potential source of linker dependencies (which you then have to find). Whereas with the .vcxproj version you only have to look in the project properties to see all required .lib files in one place.. Yep, that's what I was afraid of. If only LASTERROR had 4 more bytes of padding before name :(\nWhat do you suggest to do about this? It is of course possible to add a new bridge export only to retrieve the last status value, but I think we can all agree that would be pretty horrible :P Possibly worse: leave the public header unchanged but secretly give the register view the bigger struct anyway because it knows about the status value. Ergh.\n@justanotheranonymoususer's approach sounds like the only reasonable long term solution to me. E.g. BRIDGE_IMPEXP bool DbgGetRegDumpEx(REGDUMP* regdump, size_t bufferSize); where bufferSize is sizeof(REGDUMP), but this value would of course depend on the plugin SDK version used.\nI can also see other reasons for doing this besides adding the last status value: if AVX512 support is added in the future, REGISTERCONTEXT will need to be expanded with the zmm registers, which also affects the size of REGDUMP.. Yep. I simply removed this field for now since it isn't used in the threads view (unlike LastError).. Indeed! I think I'll refrain from asking why this is... fixed regardless.. Hmm, so you would suggest keeping one _dbg_getregdump internally (with an added bufferSize parameter) that is used by both DbgGetRegDump and DbgGetRegDumpEx? Just making sure as it's probably easier if I submit that change as a separate PR.. ",

This is a bug caused by moduleBase added twice, Sorry I didn't do many test. It should be fixed by now.\nAnd I also changed definition in addrinfo.h so that it won't get an C3848 error in release mode.\n. Log should also support grouping like Debug, Script, Plugin and level like Info, Warning and Error so that we can filter log messages. But this requires all call to dputs and dprintf changed.\n. Added set breakpoint on every command and set breakpoint on every api in reference view\nThis operation is extremely slow (several minutes for a module with 10000 calls). That's again because ui is updated every time bp command is executed.\n\n. I think analysis hint and structure view should be added to disasm engine, just like ollydbg and IDA.  And the Instruction_t and QBeaEngine for drawing GUI should be an abstract class, so it can be changed dynamically to debug vm code like IL or from a virtualizing obfuscator.\n. I can work on this once I finish other parts. The snowman IR is useful but the library must be changed to support symbolic execution. I think backtrace and symbolic execution won't be much code, only expression defination, translater and several algorithms.\n. I fixed the bug in dbg message function and uses Memory template to allocate memory.\nI also added temp code list support for encode mapping, addresses in the list will always be decoded as code and any other address that conflicts with it will be decoded as data.\nCurrently CIP is added to the list and if instruction in CIP is branch its target is also added.\nThese screenshots shows the effect of code list.\nI write this test program with junk code at rva 0x1a, without analysis, it's wrongly decoded as call instruction.\n\nAfter CIP points to that address, it's correctly decoded.\n\n. I think we need apis for both local setting storage and global setting storage.\n. This is also useful in implementing wildcard in command finding.\n. MASM supports xmmword and oword, c++ have __m128, __m128d and __m128i. Currently display name can be changed to long or short, there is a map in the QBeaEngine.cpp and I already added a option for it. Maybe we can add more options.\n. This database can be generated using clang with headers.\n. Currently the indicator has the same meaning as ollydbg, > means jump reference, $ means call reference, . means analyzed(inside a known function).  By the time this part was written, encodemap is not implemented, . indicator should be set if the current instruction has analysis info (encode type other than enc_unknown).\n. I know, maybe I'll resolve overlapping problem later. There could be gaps between basic blocks, especially in control flow obfuscated executable.\n. Yes, it's a work in progress, I plan to add simd instruction as well, but it takes a lot of time to look up the manuals. The list is not all FPU opcodes, it's just opcode that accept float oprands.\n. BpGet  and PatchEnum always get galled when debugging is being stopped.\n. ",

Hi, \nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1713#issuecomment-327461865 maybe the theme is similar, try to do as stated in the topic, before this, make a copy of your debugger archive, so that you can repeat the experiment and find the error.. Is it possible to make a QListView scroll smoothly?\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/2016323/qt4-is-it-possible-to-make-a-qlistview-scroll-smoothly\n\nFor a vertical scroll bar connected to a list view, scroll arrows typically move the current position one \"line\" up or down, and adjust the position of the slider by a small amount. I believe line in this case it is an icon's height. You can adjust items height by installing and item delegate (setItemDelegate) and overriding its sizeHint method. Though this would not help you to solve this problem. What you could try is to create a QListView descendant and override its updateGeometries method. There you can setup the vertical scrollbar step to the value you want, I guess 1 or 2 for this task. Below is an example of the custom listview:\n\n```\nclass TestListView : public QListView\n{\nQ_OBJECT\npublic:\n    explicit TestListView(QWidget *parent = 0);\nprotected:\n    virtual void updateGeometries();\n};\nTestListView::TestListView(QWidget *parent) :\n    QListView(parent)\n{\n    //???\n}\nvoid TestListView::updateGeometries()\n{\n    QListView::updateGeometries();\n    verticalScrollBar()->setSingleStep(2);\n}\n```\nhope this helps, regards.

    "jdavidberger": "I like the idea, but I think just using hit counts might be an intractable problem under most circumstances. Also, as far as I can tell, any sort of looping would be an issue. \nI think if you add a little more information though, you can get some very interesting analysis for relatively cheap. In particular, I'm thinking keep track of which breakpoint was hit directly before another breakpoint. Something as simple as \nhitGraph[thisBPId][lastBPId]++; \nlastBPId = thisBPId;\nwould give you a graph that you could almost just analyze visually. On top of that you could throw some generic graph algorithms at it to maybe get some automated analysis. I'm thinking you could pretty easily sort out chunks which were part of a loop -- it'd look like a subgraph with one entry point, relatively few exit points, and a ton of inter-connectivity in between.\n. I don't think this is purely a result of continuing in a breakpoint, I think this has a small chance to hit whenever there is a state transition from paused to running. \nI think continues in breakpoints should be handled though; albeit maybe with performance caveats. The case here was running arbitrary logic from a plugin command which included some runs. I can maybe move that to condition logic, but it isn't clear how you'd do something like run to return in this way. \n. I'll look into the API for the async stuff. But I think the access should still be guarded, no? \n. If that is what is wanted UI-wise, I'd consider removing the clear behavior from dbggetdbgevents altogether, and let the widget itself handle the logic by tracking time between updates and subtracting off the last call from dbggetdbgevents. This would also open the door to maybe being able to configure that display to be in hertz, or the %1 events in %2 ms status. \n. Sure, but at no point do you have an exact counter right now -- it is clearing itself, and at some points is doing so within 50ms of the last time it cleared based on what the internal timings of the message queue was. \nHere is what I see as the possible ways to go with this, let me know which you want and I'll change it to match:\n1. Modify getdbgevents to remove the clearing behavior, and let the UI display both 'total events' which is clearable by the user, and possibly events in hertz. This would have benefit of being able to remove the interlock on that variable; and would allow other UI elements to use dbggetdbgevents -- currently they can't because two clients calling dbggetdbgevents would clear the event counter and each would get roughly half the information. \n2. Revert out all the dbgevent changes. I don't think this is the best approach long term, but I think there is other useful stuff in this PR and I don't want to hold it up for what boils down to a minor UI change. \n. Fixed the dbggetdbgevents functionality. You can now click the time wasted widget and it will swap between view modes; although these still only work when events are coming in. Default is to show delta from last time displayed, plus the # of ms since then. \n. I believe everything is resolved now; and it should be ready to merge in. \n. Seems like a toolchain difference. Mine was setting WINVER to 0x601. Since we want to target 501 explicitly, this code is likely the wrong approach. I verified this by turning on 'Show includes' and there were no headers before _global.h in compilation units which displayed the warning.\nNot sure why you aren't seeing the redef warning; probably it is just a minor difference in toolchain versions or something. How do you feel about something like this:\n```\nifdef WINVER // Overwrite WINVER if toolchain gives us a default\nundef WINVER\nendif\ndefine WINVER 0x0501\n```\nwhich squashes the warning and applies the right WINVER. \n. I agree something like TaskThread might be nice here. I didn't realize memMapThreadCounter was externally visible and reset, so I mistakenly thought that sleep(1000) wouldn't change any behavior. \nNow that I have a better understanding of the code, I'll replace it with a TaskThread which has the desired semantics. \n. Even moving that around I get this kind of thing: https://gist.github.com/jdavidberger/d6b93ffed5195a7ad6139f5d907fc278 in other compilation units. cl is giving a version as Version 18.00.40629 for x86 and VS2013 version 12.0.40629.00 update 5 for what its worth. \nThis does bring up though that apparently InitializeConditionVariable isn't available on XP. I'll reimplement TaskThread with a semaphore and fix the header order. \n. I'm not terribly happy with this implementation, but I figured the options were: \n- Make everything require the userdata invocation. This would break existing uses of Register, and in doing so making call sites that didn't need a user data pointer to be uglier\n- Make Function an interface and have two subclasses. Downside here is we'd have to change the map to point to a pointer of that interface; and manage some dynamic allocations. \n- Tagged unions for the CB function; however VS2013 doesn't let you do C++11 union stuff and C++03 doesn't let you do unions on complex types like std::function. \n- Wrap functions without a user data arg in a function that takes in the CBEXPRESSIONFUNCTION as it's user data function. Seemed unnecessarily maze like though; and I'm not actually sure if you could find a good way to cast CBEXPRESSIONFUNCTION to void*.  \nIn the end I just tried to keep it simple and easy to follow through the code. \n.

CD00 is the least significant bits of mantissa, not exponent. I'll try to debug it.\n. I tried to input (extended)5.1, i.e. 4001A333333333333333. StringUtil.cpp:128 calls\n    dd_real dd_mantissa(mantissa);\nwhich extracts the mantissa A333333333333333 correctly, but the dd_real constructor converts it to x[0]=43E4666666666666, x[1]=43C1999999999A, in decimal 1.175979934698984e+19 and 2.536427310135064e+18. The sum of these two is 1.4296226657124905e+19, which is not equal to the mantissa*2^63=1.1759799346989838e+19. So this is incorrect.\nThe constructor reads\n    dd_real(unsigned long long h)\n    {\n        x[0] = static_cast<double>(h);\n        x[1] = static_cast<double>(h - static_cast<unsigned long long>(x[0]));\n    }\nThe problem is caused by an overflow of FISTP (which is always a signed operation) in the static_cast<unsigned long long>. Here it doesn't return the truncated unsigned mantissa e.g. A333333333330000, but saturated signed 8000000000000000 and sets FPU IA exception.\nThen the result of the dd_real division and multiplication by exponent is 6.2, not 5.1\nI'm very surprised how this can work for most numbers, but probably the string conversion at the end of ToLongDoubleString somehow makes it up for the error.\nI'd seriously consider using a different extended precision library.\n. A trick that might work (sacrificing 1 bit of precision) is taking \ndd_real dd_mantissa(mantissa>>1);\nand then adding 1 to the exponent\ndd_real exp = pow2_fast(exponent - EXP_BIAS +1, &exp10);\n. I like the idea of using a small library. According to my research, possible alternatives would be\n1. a newer version of dd_real in David Bailey's QD\n2. quad_float in Victor Shoup's NTL library\n3. SCSLib (??)\nThen there's of course the two big guys: GMP mpf and MPFR, a little cumbersome for this task I agree, but much more supported and well-tested.\nAbout inline assembly, I also wouldn't consider it an option, but for different reasons. Converting IEEE extended to string, and also the other way round to support decimal input - a feature not yet available in x32dbg - is no easy job... Coding the stuff separately for x86 and x64 is probably not the biggest problem there. (I wouldn't bother trying it in SSE2.)\n. That pretty much constraints it to float128 or inline assembly... QD is close, but still not a single cpp.\nDid you try the shift 1 hack?\n. What about this one?\nhttps://github.com/rkennedy/exact-float\ndepends on boost\n. Yeah, I meant coding something similar in C++ from scratch. But my C++ is horrible. I can do it in C.\nSo you essentially took QD's dd_real and condensed it? \nqd_real precision is not required.\n. I absolutely agree.

    "webro666": "Since I've always worked with msdia instead of dbghelp, I just ran some tests and observed the following with dbghelp (at least on my system):\ncalling SymSetOptions without SYMOPT_UNDNAME will make undecorated names unavailable, no matter what. UnDecorateSymbolName will not give you any undecorated names.\ncalling SymSetOptions with SYMOPT_UNDNAME will undecorate all names automatically (decorated names will be lost). No need to call UnDecorateSymbolName in this case.\nMSDN also states: \"To use undecorated symbols, call the SymSetOptions function with the SYMOPT_UNDNAME option.\"\nSo, whatever is going on here, UnDecorateSymbolName is completely useless. If you specify SYMOPT_UNDNAME, you get undecorated symbols by default (meaning, you don't have to call it to get the undecorated name), if you don't specify SYMOPT_UNDNAME it will simply do nothing.\nAnd about the exports problem, I observed the following:\nIf you let dbghelp find the corresponding .pdb file, it will just read symbols out of the pdb file and totally ignore the export table in the corresponding module. So if the .pdb file does not have export table symbols, you won't get any export table symbols.\nIf you don't let dbghelp find the .pdb file, it will read imports and exports from the module.\nSo, to fix undecorated symbols, you would probably have to specify SYMOPT_UNDNAME within SymSetOptions (if undecoration is set in engine options).\nAnd to fix the exports problem, you would have to manually extract information from the export table in addition to getting symbols from dbghelp, if the .pdb does not store any export information.\nI'm not sure, if I'm the only one with this strange behaviour..\n. I've also done some more experimenting. I downloaded the latest debugging tools, copied all related files to the x64dbg directory where the exe resides, but I can't get undecorating to work. Public symbols in the form of _SymbolName@XX will not get undecorated without specifying SYMOPT_UNDNAME, no matter what params I specify in UnDecorateSymbolName. But that's not too big of a deal, because I will just go ahead and specify SYMOPT_UNDNAME and take the loss of decorated names.\nBut the fact, that exported api functions are not displayed in the CPU and Symbols windows is really kind of annoying.\nSo I tried to get a quick \"hacky\" workaround going like this:\nIn symbolinfo.cpp add the line\nSymEnumExports(Base, EnumCallback, UserData);\nto the end of the SymEnum function.\nSymEnumExports looks like this (as I said, just a quick \"hacky\" version):\nvoid SymEnumExports(duint Base, CBSYMBOLENUM EnumCallback, void* UserData)\n{\nSYMBOLINFO symbol;\nmemset(&symbol, 0, sizeof(SYMBOLINFO));\nsymbol.isImported = false;\napienumexports(Base, [&](duint base, const char *mod, const char* name, duint addr)\n{\nsymbol.addr = addr;\nsymbol.decoratedSymbol = (char *)name;\nsymbol.undecoratedSymbol = (char *)name;\nEnumCallback(&symbol, UserData);\n});\n}\nIt now shows exported functions in the Symbols window, but the CPU window still doesn't recognize exports :(\n.

Now I'm unable to open the tab again because there is no entry for \"Trace\" window in \"View\" menu..

    "alexnask": "I'm gonna take a shot at this one.\n. @mrexodia What exactly is the intended behavior?\nThe fact that you cannot reselect is because of this code:\nc++\n// CPUStack.cpp:425\n    // This sets the first visible row to be selected when stack is frozen, so that we can scroll the stack without it being reset to first selection\n    if(bStackFrozen && rowOffset == 0)\n        setSingleSelection(wRva);\n(Which is right at the beginning of CPUStack::paintContent)\nRemoving these lines fixes the selection but I'm not sure if it should do something else in addition?\n. @mrexodia Ok, I'll test it out and get back to you, thanks for the quick answer :)\n. This is true when you are returning different variables, for example:  \n``` c++\nQString foo_func() {\n    QString foo = get_some_foo();\n    if (some_condition) {\n        process(foo);\n        return foo;\n    }\nQString bar = get_bar();\n// or 'return get_bar();'\nreturn bar;\n\n}\n```\nThis technique is commonly referred to as NRVO (named return value optimization).  \nSee here for relevant parts of the standard and an example given by it.  \n(It also make sense if you consider that, at least with the Win64 calling convention, returning structs really means passing a struct pointer in and modifying it, which means you can elide creating the local function object directly and write into the passed struct)\n. Could be modified to allow the plugin to provide an alternative instead of just filtering it (although I don't know if this is already achievable and it would probably be cleaner in another callback processed after the filtering happens).\n. @mrexodia\nAh, gotcha, I didn't get that from the issue.\nI will implement it in a bit!\n. Flushing after every instruction is probably a bit too wasteful but I couldn't find any convenient way of querying the write buffer's current size on the Qt docs (and keeping a bytes_written counter around seems a bit too clunky) and it seems to work (tested with 303K instructions, it took a bit but worked after all :P)\n. @0x900x90\nI looked at your code and wanted to get rid of duplication since copySelectionToFileSlot was basically copy pasted, so I initially just went with returning a QString.  \nPerhaps building a QString in the function and committing it to the stream in 4Mb chunks is a good way to avoid duplication as well as too many flushes.\nI may modify the code tomorrow and do it that way :)\n. @0x900x90\nHuh, weird, I used it to copy a whole program (~300K instructions) without problems, I'll try to reproduce it.\n. @0x900x90\nI'm flushing the data after every instruction in my code, that's why I'm surprised (I suppose QTextStream doesn't release the write buffer memory after a flush for some reason?)  \nAccording to Qt docs: \"If you call flush(), QTextStream will empty all data from its write buffer into the device and call flush() on the device.\", so I really don't know why this would consume a lot of memory.\n. I don't see how txt could be the issue, I will try to reproduce this myself if @mrexodia has no time.\n(Probably tomorrow morning but I could take a shot in a couple of hours too)\n. Shouldn't the compiler already be able to perform return value optimization here, since the function exclusively returns 'addrText'?  \nIn fact, I believe explicitly moving here can actually hurt performance (see here and here).\n. The difference is probably negligible for a small QString, you are right.\nIt just caught my eye and I was just wondering if there was a legitimate reason for the move.\n. I'm actually setting up all the compilation tools you require (since I usually work with gcc and I haven't touched Qt in a while) to tackle a couple of bugs :P\nIf I see anything along the way that looks like it could be better, I will be writing it down (and I will open a PR).\nI don't think there will be much though, the code looks nice from the limited amount I've seen up to now :)\n.

That is the breakpoints correctly stop execution upon every\ninvocation.\nI would be very glad to send you (privately) the software that is causing\nthe problem, but it is meant to work with a proprietary monitoring device\nconnected through USB (as a HID class). In fact my debugging involves\n(trying) to make some sense out of the data that is sent over the HID\nreport data, and captured with Wireshark, to (hope-fully/lessly) port it to\nAndroid.\nBest Regards\n\ngiordano\n.

    "merces": "Hi!\nThe default behavior for hexa/ASCII dumpers is to print a dot for non-ASCII characters. I think people are used to it and used to look for a 2E byte in order to distinguish a real dot from this condition. If you keep it as default, the hexa/ASCII dump output will be compatible with others. For example:\n```\n$ hd -n32 /bin/ls\n00000000  7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.ELF............|\n00000010  02 00 03 00 01 00 00 00  b4 c1 04 08 34 00 00 00  |............4...|\n00000020\n$ xxd -l 32 /bin/ls\n0000000: 7f45 4c46 0101 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000  .ELF............\n0000010: 0200 0300 0100 0000 b4c1 0408 3400 0000  ............4...\n```\nOn Windows, Hex Workshop for instance, follows the same pattern. While others prefer not to call it ASCII and shows UNICODE characters and replace dots by empty spaces for for non-printable characters but I've never seen diamonds or circles.\nApart from that, if you output a non-ASCII character in a ASCII dump (the column title says \"ASCII\"), it is not correct as @10miles pointed out, so it'd be good to either rename it or keep it pure ASCII.\nPS.: Another feature to consider would be an UNICODE column, but that's another discussion. \n.

",
    "skillax": "Reproduced on Win 8.1 Pro x64 with build 2017-02-05 using the ScyllaHide Themida x86 profile and only adding Exception 0xC0000096 to the Exception-list (otherwise the unpackme won't run properly --> anti-debugging); after closing the unpackme, the unpackme window disappears, but the main thread of the unpackme seems still active and unresponsive; x64dbg times out with 'Debuggee unresponsive after 10s). In the x64Dbg statusbar is says 'Running | Cleaning up wait objects...'.   The x64Dbg GUI thread is still responsive, but you can't for example restart or stop the debuggee, nor close the Debugger itself normally.\nIt happens in Olly too (with the same ScyllaHide plugin + settings); so I guess it's anti-debug... but Olly asks if you want to terminate the unresponsive process, and clicking yes will kill the hanging thread and leave Olly operational.  Perhaps that would be a nice enhancement for x64Dbg too in this case ?  \nPS: If it is anti-debug, it might be interesting to bugreport it to ScyllaHide as well (as a potential improvement), as to investigate the cause and potentially have a 'workaround/fix' implemented.\n. I've noticed this too. The last 'working' build is 2016-12-29; the 2017-01-02 build and all afterwards create corrupted dump files. Tested on Win 8.1 x64 on multiple unprotected and non-packed x86 targets (to ensure it was no human error).   I ran all the different snapshots 'virgin' as they are downloaded, not overwriting my existing x64dbg and not changing any of the default x64dbg or Scylla settings before dumping (I did verify if all the settings were the same too).\nAfter dumping the executables fail with the message \"The application has failed to start because it's side-by-side configuration is corrupt\".  Trying to load the dumped executables into x64dbg fails with \"CreateProcess failed: ERROR_SXS_CANT_GEN_ACTCX\" as well (= same error).\nI ran sxstrace.exe on those corrupted executables (built-in Windows tool) and the raw error is something like 'Cannot read Manifest file. Invalid XML on line 0'.   When using the 2016-12-29 snapshot, dumping works just fine.    The most obvious and visible indicator:  the corrupted dumps of these non-protected test-targets don't show their icon in Windows Explorer. \nAlso tried all kinds of settings within Scylla, including running x64dbg as admin; but it doesn't make a difference.  You can download my test-set to compare the results yourself here: https://we.tl/JSjVDsWho1\nThe test.exe is the original executable (it's the free and unprotected NirLauncher.exe tool simply renamed), test_dumped_2016-12-29.exe is the working dump and test_dumped_2017-01-02.exe is the 'corrupted' dump. To reproduce manually, simply load test.exe and straight away at EP start Scylla. Within the Scylla screen just hit [IAT AutoSearch] and [Get Imports] and finally [Dump], not doing anything else ...  I'm pretty confident it's some newly introduced bug :). Probably related to https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1425\nYou're using the 2017-01-19 release, which is about the last build affected by this; could you please retry with the latest 2017-02-05 version ? I'll bet that one works :). That's due to the exe-file having 'install' (or 'setup' or even 'launch') in it's filename; rename the file to test.exe and please test again, I'll bet it works fine :)  This is Windows behaviour by design (inserting SHIMs), not a x64Dbg issue.  kernel32.GetProcAddress gets screwed up as well ..... There's a mention of 'Thread created' in your log (TLS callback ?); it's likely the app is actually changing memory-page access-rights. Goto the 012D3710 address in Disassembly and check what memory address it's trying to access; if it's not 00000000 but a real address, look it up in the Memory Map tab and check it's access rights; it's probably missing R and/or X; try adding those permissions and then resume ....

TitanEngine provides RemoteLoadLibrary but it does not work at all. \nSo I said If I can use the DbgCmdExec, I can be able to send command to the debugger programmatically. So I did.

For searching in the Current Module I've added Ctrl+Shift+F and Ctrl+Shift+B, but in most IDEs Ctrl+Shift+F is find in files, which in x64dbg might correspond to either find in current module or find in all modules.. I have checked if it's possible to use QString::number or the underlying QLocale to make Qt do this conversion correctly, but from QLocaleData::doubleToString's source code I can see that they deliberately strip the negative sign from 0.\nI'll fix it by using the existing STL-based ToFloatString/ToDoubleString functions on the GUI side and send a PR shortly.. I have worked on this issue a bit, and might have a PR ready by tomorrow. I can add the export names to the list in SymAutoComplete but there are a few open questions that we need to figure out.\nShould it only add the exports to the list when there are no symbols loaded for the module, or should it add them always?\nOn my local build using VS 2017 _MessageBoxA@16 doesn't get undecorated to MessageBoxA, so adding the exports always is useful in my case.\nIf we are adding the exports always, should we try to handle ordering issues e.g for prefix 'A' eypoers Ax1, Ax2, ... will always come before Aa1, Aa2 symbols?  This already happens more or less due to concatenating lists from different modules.. As far as I can see there is no simple way to truly merge the exports into the symbol cache with the current architecture. It would require either implementing a SymbolSourceBase derived class that is capable of merging different symbol sources, or some redesign of the symbol handling architecture. Both seem to be too big of a task and changeset for simply adding exports to the autocomplete list.\nI agree with @mrexodia that this fix should be a relatively simple prefix search, similar to the one already implemented in SymbolSourceDIA::findSymbolsByPrefix, and that we should do a refactor later, making the autocomplete smarter in the process.\nI already have a working implementation in my local repo, but it only uses linear search yet. To fully take advantage of the presorted vector<size_t> exportsByName, and use a binary search I might need to modify it to store const char*-s or name + index pairs, so that I can use std::lower_bound to search for a prefix that does not have  an index in exports.. > To make it clear: if(IsArgumentsLessThan(argc, 2)) already checks the number of arguments. The real cause is Yara.\nThis only checks that the yara command was given at least one argument, but the cause of the crash is that x64dbg uses the second argument at argv[2], which is only valid if argc > 2. By adding checks before argv[2] usages and some default values for the argc == 2 case, I was able to get the yara command working with only one argument.\n\nTo solve this issue: remove yara from x64dbg.\n\nDo you mean remove it from the 64 bit version, or remove it entirely from x64dbg? Could you elaborate on why do you think yara should be removed? (I don't use it personally, but some might find it useful)\n. I've checked it and it's a bug that was introduced with the Capstone->Zydis transition.\nThe code in Zydis::RegInfo treats ZydisOperandAction as a flag, however it's an enum with continuous values from 0 to 7. The code in question:\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/fba7af6bcd28381c4edd68f709a134f40befc9a4/src/zydis_wrapper/zydis_wrapper.cpp#L876-L879\nI'm working on a fix for this.. I've checked this crash and it happens due to a bogus Debug Directory size in the PE headers. The sample contains a Debug Directory with the size 0xfffff000 which causes the while loop in ReadDebugDirectory to overrun the mapped file and crash.\nIt can be reproduced on a non-malware 32-bit sample (e.g. calc.exe) by using CFF Explorer to modify it's Debug Directory entry's size to 0xfffff000 and the entry's base address so it points to a valid address that's not a supported entry (e.g. to a random position after the original entries).\nI have a fix for this and will send a PR shortly. PE reading doesn't seem very robust at the moment, there could be similar crashes with other malicious PE files. @mrexodia, do you have any suggestions on how to review and exercise this part of the code?\nI was thinking of trying to setup AFL and/or libFuzzer for fuzzing this part of the code, and trying to find a collection of malformed PE files that could serve as further testcases..

So your \"commit\" is the code change that I'm asking about.  -Cheers. Ok, it look like you made the lock exclusive.  I have dug into this debugger's code so it's a bit of an assumption based on the code change.  :). Ah, ok.  I will go back and take a closer look.  Thx!. Ok, yes, I see it.  I'm going to test in a few.... Uhm...  This change AVs all over the place (c0000005) at every step.  This happens using an 32bit exe.  :|. So this is very strange.  Using something simple like HxD.exe (hex editor) has no issues.  However, using Roboauth.exe or Produkey.exe (sysinternals) AVs.  The debugger doesn't crash, but weird behavior persists.. Going to build a quick win32 app and retest.. Alright, well not so simple.  Building a quick Windows app with VC2017 isn't recognized on Windows XP as a valid windows app (of course, I guess - stupid MS).  Anway, I only see this problem on WinXPx64 (where I do my RE stuff), sooo I guess I'll use a different debugger when I run into this issue (losing interest, sry).  Nice work on this debugger though.  I'll keep watching/using.  . Yea, XP is old as dirt (but less OS hassles, as I'm sure you know).  Changing the build properties causes more head aches.  Maybe I'll just find an old SDK with EXEs that have less dependencies (ugh).  Anyway, thanks for looking looking at this and I'll check out your link.. Indeed, everything does work 'fine' with that - nice.. Hmmm...  Well, maybe I was lazy.  I copy over the x32 bin dir into the debugger DIR, thinking this will just updated files.  Yes, so it works - sort of.  The titanengine.dll is very small compared to the DLL that comes with the x64DBG download.  I get past the UI hang, but then any real debugging starts, the debugger crashes.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong.  :(. Looks like string search on module was causing the crash.  Happened twice, but seems to be working better now.. Will do.  :).

    "GuardianArchangelJohn": "It's a bit of a big function, and it splits in a lot of places, it's the Quaternion.eulerangles function from Unity3D (converts from Quaternions to Euler angles). I wanted to check it to see what the underlying math does because a lot of people are confused on its function as is. Most of the time devs just accept it and use Unity's functions, and that's fine until you start interacting with hardware that sends or receives rotational coordinates like an IMU and it's in a different coordinate system like Nautical where Z is up vs. in Unity and most OpenGL-based software where the default viewport sets Y to up by default. In many cases, it's just simply a matter of rotating on the X axis by 90 degrees, but maybe I have situations where I want to just work in Quaternions and not even mess with Euler altogether, it would be great to know all the underlying math.\nBasically, I just wanted to understand the math and know why it's a bit different than other more widely known Euler to Quaternion and vice versa conversion functions.\nLuckily I can build an EXE with PDB symbols directly from Unity and debug it. Mathematically, it looks sound, unless your rotation pitch angle is 90 or 270 degrees, then they have some weird logic going on, and some of it I found out yesterday is happening outside of the function (in this case, when X = 90 or 270 and you convert to Quaternions, it looks like it multiplies the X/Y/Z/W by -1, but it doesn't happen until sometime after the Euler -> Quaternion function and before the Quaternion -> Euler function).\nWhat I went and did was go back through and comment and just export the DB often just in case of crash. Unfortunately I don't think I have the minidump, if I can repro again I'll try and find it.\nHere's the Euler to Quaternion function, this one's pretty straight forward: \nhttps://pastebin.com/ikW8c4AT\nHere's the Quaternion to Euler function, this one I've commented a lot, it's the trouble function:\nhttps://pastebin.com/AGVa3Pxc\nI kind of figured that was the case on Snowman, but wanted to check. I'll start looking into taint analysis, I figured maybe a plugin will need to be developed. In the comments you'll see I tried to kind of work out what it's doing mathematically and keep tabs on the formulas. Looks like the majority of it is checking out so far, except for whenever X = 90 | 270 and you have other positive Y/Z angles. Then I realized that say your Euler to Quaternion gives you something like (0.7, 0, 0, 0.7), whenever X is 90 or 270 it would come into the function like (-0.7, -0, -0, -0.7), so I'm thinking the problem is upstream, but that doesn't make any sense if you have a standard mathematical function that you're reusing in several places in code why you would alter the variables prior to entering the function, so surely I must have made a mistake somewhere in my comments, but haven't been able to track it down yet..

The 0x is suppressed through the last argument you pass to ZydisPrintHexS in the displacement formatter hook here.

Thanks @mrexodia for pointing the reasons :)\nThere is no bug with analysis AFAIK. I just found this way of disasm very strange because I never see it done this way. I come from a IDA background and one thing I always found very useful with IDA is the analysis capabilities it have but now I understand the motivation behind what you did in x64dbg.\n. @mrexodia I mean some kind of feature that prevents a bp from hitting at some addresses. I was looking for some plugin that could present some alternative to the conditional break box as it is not that practical in my case as I have a bp that hits in very much different addresses.. Hi @stonedreamforest I'll take a look at this plugin. However in the github page I didn't find nowhere saying it imports function analysis to x64dbg. It only says that it sync function names. Do you use this plugin? Thanks.. Yes, but what I need is the function analysis data as function start/end, etc. You know if this plugins imports it?. I see,\nWhat you do to cope with the lack of function analysis in the dbg?. Ye, I do that too @mrexodia but I found that this approach is slowing the analysis process as I have to keep constantly going from the dbg to IDA to make some static analysis and then get back to the dbg. Things would be much faster if at the very least I could export the functions start/end from IDA to the x64dbg.\nWell, thanks for the answer. I'll code the plugin as soon as I get some free time and share here in case someone is falling in that too.. @blaquee What I'm saying about function analysis is just the basics (that slows down a little bit some reversing sessions). If I could import things like functions prototype and create the functions boundaries (start/end virtual adresses) that would do the job. Other things like local variable names would be awesome to have too. The labeless plugin does not do such things as far as I know (I remember to check it out in the past).. ",

I'd rather not install VS2013 again (I think I still have a few traces of it left somewhere ;P), and I was hoping that upgrading solutions to the newer toolset/vs would work, but it looks like apart from small problems (like missing proper win sdk include/lib folders) there were also a lot of errors regarding c++ conformance, so I just abandoned the idea. \nAnyway, thanks for the help.. @mrexodia hm mem.base(dis.sel())+X doesn't seem to do what exactly I want.\nI want to be able to move/scroll to/go to the address in the current dump (selected from memory map) at the offset relative to its beginning/base address.\nmem.base(dis.sel()) gives me the address of ntdll, while I have 1.exe dump open.\nBtw, in this particular case 1.exe:$1234 seems to calculate the dress that I want, but\n  1) I'm not sure how would that translate for other memory map dumps (like \".text\" section)\n  2) This doesn't scroll the dump view, so it's a bit useless for me (at least if there is no way to view the current address in the dump view).\n\nI just use vs2017 with the vs2013 compiler.\n\nHm. After a bit of struggling and installing some additional old windows SDKs+ MFC I've managed to build x64dbg.\nBut I had to fix some C++ conformance issues along the way. I'll submit the PR with them shortly.. @mrexodia well, I think that 1.exe:$1234 stuff worked fine for me, i.e. it calculated the desired address from offset, BUT - it didn't move/scroll the memory dump I was viewing. \nBasically, I want to be able to navigate memory dump view using something like Go To -> File Offset, but instead of the file offset it'd be RVA.\nBecause so far, none of the commands had any effect on dump widget. Or maybe I'm using them wrong.. @mrexodia welp. Now I feel like an idiot. For some reason it didn't appear that the same comands/expression I wrote in the command line would work in a Ctrl+G dialog. Well, it's much better now! Would be even nicer, if there was a shortcut to Go To mod.base(dump.sel()) + x (i.e. got to the offset of the currently examined module in the dump view), though not sure how helpful that would be for anyone else =). @mrexodia what is the rationale for the revert?\nIf it's because of https://forum.tuts4you.com/topic/39851-is-it-a-bug/?tab=comments#comment-192434\nI think I know what is the issue: I forgot to change (or rather just overlooked):\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/f0fd4b7acfac7e93346d27054c3abce56549fa38/src/gui/Src/Gui/TabWidget.cpp#L14\nIt should become const QPoint &. I've fixed this in https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/pull/1744 and confirmed that tab detaching now works again.\nBtw, this problem would be caught/non-existent if the project used new C++11 style for connects (which binds and checks for slot existence at compile time).\nAlso, I see no reason for signal to have a non-const reference as it's arg (pretty sure that QPoint can even be passed by-value without any perf impact, since it's just 8 bytes (2 ints)): https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/21d2d1c4e00ee77e975c9d84972f418d3de4d9d3/src/gui/Src/Gui/TabBar.h#L25. Also, path can be longer than legacy MAX_PATH, though not sure if it's easily fixable.. ",

By the way, I looked for the latest changelogs (version 2.22) of wine-devel and it seems they're (constantly) adding concurrency related code, which makes me wonder which branch is this one that removed concurrency.\nPS: I'm on wine 2.21 staging branch.. Indeed I have to praise you for the quick response and I have to admit I've never seen anyone fix a bug so quickly. \nIt seems to be working right now, I'll keep you up if any crashes pop up.. By the way, what has been changed to make it work again in wine?. Damn, how dumb I am.

    "twifty": "Any updates on this?. Why was this closed? A problem clearly exists in the rendering of the graph.\nHow about giving users an option to right click and remove the unwanted part of the graph? Or allow us select exactly which lines should be included.\nCurrently any function which uses vector allocate/resize inline methods will cause the next, completely unrelated, function to be included in the graph. This greatly increases the graph size and makes it extremely difficult to follow code flow.\nA quick fix, for anybody experiencing the same problem, replace the first int 3 with a ret.\nThis leads me to the second problem with rendering the graph. Changes within the CPU view (assembly/comments) are not reflected within the graph. One must switch to the graph view and add an empty comment to force it to be re-rendered.. Has this already been reported or something?. I'll close this since it does appear to be a corrupt database. However, I should mention the problem is repeatable. It seems related to changing the instruction on the main entry point. If I instead patch the second instruction, it works as intended.. I haven't tried to reproduce the problem since. It was a combination of changing the entry point instruction, having a breakpoint set on that line and having a label set on the line. I don't know how or why windows update broke things, but it was working perfectly fine for weeks before.. Fair enough. How about an option to toggle 'right click select'?. ",

You\ncan imagine his surprise when while he was describing what he had had for\nbreakfast that morning, Andre walked up and thumped him in the neck,\nsending him down \u201cfor the count\u201d in the parlance of our time.\nWhile it was universally agreed that the boy had violated the spirit of the\ngame, officials were unable to find any actual rule that punching violated,\nand were forced to let the victory stand.\nThis upset caused an uproar in the boxing community large enough to spill\nover into local newspapers, and stirred the interest of many outsiders to\ncome see what the fuss was about. The newcomers were enthralled to engage\nin these borderline barbaric displays of human strength and skill, and the\nrest is history \u2013 after a few spoilsport schoolmoms single-minded about\nsafety added the padded gloves, of course.\nToday\u2019s boxing enthusiasts fantasise about the newcomer that would rock the\nring the way Filipe did.\nClassification of the modern ruleset has essentially locked the punching\nstrategy into place; but it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the fantasy. Young\nscholars with big dreams often enter the ring with their crazy new trick,\nusually a variant of hypnosis. And though they\u2019ve achieved the occasional\nvictory, none of the gimmicks have been robust enough to make it to the\nbig-time.\nThe real wonder, though, is that Andre Filipe\u2019s original vision of boxing\nis still around. Gentlemen\u2019s boxing clubs can be found in cities all over\nthe world; you can visit one most any day of the week and see two erudite\ngentlemen exchanging pleasantries in the ring.\nMost people only come to watch a few hours of a match, and then leave. But\nevery once in a while you\u2019ll find amongst your elders a stout fellow, a\ndie-hard fan, who perhaps witnessed that historic battle between Filipe and\nBishop, who for love of the sport must stay to witness the last glorious\nseconds of wakefulness slip away, only to return to fight again another day.\nOn Fri, Jan 12, 2018 at 11:19 AM, Caleb LaFeve notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nIs no one aware you can't unsubscribe by saying unsubscribe?\nOn Jan 12, 2018 12:37 PM, \"sbovay\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nUnsubscribe\nOn Jan 12, 2018 11:04 AM, \"luistong\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nUnsubscribe\nSent from my iPhone\nOn Jan 12, 2018, at 7:47 AM, Philip Krauss notifications@github.com<\nmailto:notifications@github.com> wrote:\nUnsubscribe!\nOn Jan 12, 2018 10:44 AM, \"Duncan Ogilvie\" notifications@github.com<\nmailto:notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n@lynnux https://github.com/lynnux could you test with this fix?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1863#issuecomment-357271546\n,\nor mute\nthe thread\n<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AFm1HUODC5Drji-\nwFWFZ22RzvP0kLXoIks5tJ33YgaJpZM4RUAVI\n.\n\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/\nx64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1863#issuecomment-357273596, or mute the thread<\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAmPQNRRXAzj81g_\n0qv5kHKcjA6rJ0Ozks5tJ35-gaJpZM4RUAVI>.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1863#issuecomment-357274371,\nor mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-\nauth/AYvcTjO_Wu2mJq7k07csEJMd_lAiBG61ks5tJ4IQgaJpZM4RUAVI\n.\n\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1863#issuecomment-357279326,\nor mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/\nAR5BKwrd1iPHWeGXYeMusIQHcSESh5Nvks5tJ5WqgaJpZM4RUAVI\n.\n\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/issues/1863#issuecomment-357315482, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AEPKXLRjR2JjFH37GJGTsTh01zW-XFzaks5tJ6-WgaJpZM4RUAVI\n.\n\n\n-- \nAlo Gray\nMobile: 415-321-9955\n.

OK, great, how about using this brand new stuff - XSTATE_AVX512_ZMM\neg:  https://abi-laboratory.pro/compatibility/Windows_8.1_to_Windows_10_1511_10586.494/x86_64/headers_diff/ntdll.dll/diff.html\n. I've one more idea - if you don't mind\nhow about the debugger will scan CPU that it's running on (using cpuid command I guess) and in case there is no avx/avx512 support - debugger will hide showing ymm/zmm registers (as they are quite long in size!)\nwhat you say?\n. @mrexodia  I\"d like to push this issue forward and I've some questions to you.\nAs far as I see x64dbg uses TitanEngine module to communicate with/control/etc the CPU, one of the comm flow is to get/set registers. Now I\"m a bit stucked as I did not find TitanEngine sources in your repository, just compiled bits. Ideally it'd be present  here as a git submodule, or, 2nd option - as a separate dir with full sources.\nIn my understanding I need to extend context structures from both sides - the debugger (REGISTERCONTEXT) and titan engine (TITAN_ENGINE_CONTEXT_t) + corresponding APIs (eg: GetFullContextDataEx(), SetFullContextDataEx(), etc)\nI envision there need to be added a set of new APIs to handle AVX512/ZMM (analogy as it was done right now for Get/SetAVXContext(), right?)\nPlease let me know how could one start updating TitaneEngine side.\nThe debugger side is clear for me.\n.

    "raiseman": "At first I thought porting Cutter graph (in its original form) might be a good idea. But if you try to compare zooming process Cutter vs IDA, you will definitely choose IDA.\nCutter's graph sticks to border. It simply does not allow zooming/moving to wherever you want. This is particularly visible on large horizontally/vertically oriented graphs.\nSo my goal was to implement something similar to IDA. \nAnd I think I did it, at some point it is even better :)\nNew mode is fully compatible with old calculations. Changes did not affect block coords, edges etc. \nAnd for those who might prefer old-style mode - it is an option, so you can always uncheck it.\nI tested it some time and had not found any bugs (as of the last commit)\nIt would be nice if someone tested it on large graph, say > 10k nodes.\nRegarding todo list: base functionality is done, there are some todos left in code but I think it is not that important.\nIcons from Fugue\n . Just noticed that graph breakpoints are broken since that commit.. (have not updated some time) \nEasy fix is to rollback from\nreturn zoomActionHelper() != 0;\nto\nreturn zoomActionHelper();\nat line 2145\nActually, I had no any warnings for that part of the code... (QtCreator 4.7.2) \nFurthermore, this code (before zoom mode has been introduced): https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/blob/5162450ff37d823d1713ba7da3ed310bf52817f5/src/gui/Src/Gui/DisassemblerGraphView.cpp#L1665\nhad the same functionality\n. Yes. It returns the address.\nShould I make a pull request for this? If no one sees any bugs left in zoom mode I would remove \"beta\" from gui option. . I think Shift+Z can be improved by adding a highlighting of selected block (like IDA does)\nAs for graph slowing down, the issue requires more in-depth analysis...
