    "younes0": "\nThis Repo is under active development and has strong sponsors such as Browserstack.\nIt makes sense to merge Desktop Browser & Mobile Agent utilities  \n\nSo I say yes...\n. ",
    "jenssegers": "Done :)\n. You are correct :)\n. What is your user agent?\n. I get OS X when I run:\nAgent::platform('Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0');\n. That is pretty weird indeed, can't really think of something that would cause this.\n. Probably removed from the original library. Try getUserAgent, if not check out https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect\n. Mobile Detect does not have browser versions, so that might be difficult I think.\n. MobileDetect recently added a version method. You can get the browser version like this:\n$browser = Agent::browser();\n$version = Agent::version($browser);\nI can't guarantee it will always return the correct result but it seems to work for Chrome.\n. I just added some additional properties to detect versions of operating systems and browser that are not included in MobileDetect.\n. The 1.0.0 version does not include mobile-detect.\n. 1.0.0 was ported from CodeIgniter, the versions above use the newer Mobile Detect library (https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect).\n. The bindShared issue was fixed in the current release.\n. $detect->isMobile() also returns true for tablets, so it's basically just !$detect->isMobile(). Don't know if I should be making a method for that?\n. Can you do a pull request?\n. Try suggesting this at https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect, which is the main library that powers the laravel agent.\n. Can you show me the user agent string?\n. It seems that Mobiledetect parses Safari Mobile to 'Safari': https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect/blob/master/Mobile_Detect.php#L406\nWhy do you want it to be parsed differently?\n. Would it be an option to check Agent::isMobile()? I don't really want to break Mobiledetect behavior. I would advise you to suggest this feature to the original Mobiledetect repository: https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect\n. You can use getUserAgent\n. Coveralls doesn't work in HHVM?\n. Try this:\nUserAgent::is('IE');\n. Windows 7 is actually Windows NT 6.1, which is also displayed in the user agent string.\n. Are you willing to do a pull request? Otherwise I will try to add it this weekend.\n. There you go :)\n. When it goes public, I will. Taylor keeps breaking too much stuff during the beta :)\n. There's a PR with more bots #28, I'll take a look into it.\n. Dropped it in the last commit. I don't think it is even needed in L4.\n. Done\n. Example user agent?\n. Isn't MSIE 7.0 Internet Explorer 7? That's one weird user agent string.\n. Apparently Trident/5.0 means that it's coming from an IE9 browser. It's a bit of an edge case actually. To fix this I would have to add custom code for IE only, which I would rather not do of course :)\nIn case of IE, you could try to check for:\nAgent::version('Trident');\nThis will return 5 in this case. To get the actual IE number, you need to add 4 to it.\n. Should be fixed now.\n. The latest version is now using jaybizzle/crawler-detect to do better robot detection.. Did you forgot a ~ for the mobiledetect version?\n. Merged, thanks!\n. You are not using the correct namespace. If you have added it to the alias list, then you should use \\Agent or use Agent;\n. Fixed on dev-master :)\n. The list of potential robot names could get quite large, I don't know it it would be the best solution. Might be even better of Mobiledetect could solve this in their code base.\n. I would definitely love to hear their take on this matter.\n. I saw that MobileDetect implemented a couple of new robots, is it enough to close this issue?\n. That should not be detected as google bot.\n. What is Edge's user agent?\n. Agent directly extends the original MobileDetect class, so it should be available on both. It is also tested here: https://github.com/jenssegers/agent/blob/master/tests/AgentTest.php\n. What is the error message that you are getting?\n. Added, thanks for the suggestion!\n. Did you test this on Laravel 4 and 5?\n. That's a weird user agent, is that the stock Safari browser?\n. iPad is also mobile. Check $agent->isTablet() first.\n. Could you use ^2.6.8 instead? :)\nMight be handy to have the prefer-lowest test running on travis as well.\n. Oh wait, it should have been ^2.6.9 no?\n. Looks like this version is still failing though: https://travis-ci.org/jenssegers/agent/jobs/114512804\n. 2.7.6 should do it.\n. You could do ->isiOS().\n. This library inherits all helper methods from http://mobiledetect.net\n. Would you mind adding the as 1 entry 'Yandex', and additional tests? :)\n. Can you try Agent::browser()?\n. We could integrate that library into this one to provide better bot detection. What do you think @JayBizzle ?. This is actually an issue with the original MobileDetect library. Can you open an issue there?\n. Can you provide the user agent string?\n. @tooblue Added your UA to a test, and everything seems to be ok. \nhttps://github.com/jenssegers/agent/commit/c31032a041c2021343a279bce96e478468d59e80. If the user agent variable is null, mobile detect will use the current user agent from the request.\n. This is indeed the server's up address. This also somewhat out of the scope of this package.\n. Not so sure if I see the advantage in having an interface here.. I don't think this method is available in older Laravel versions.. Tagged new release. Should be ok now.. This was recently tagged.. Can you send me the user agent?. Mobiledetect also groups all Opera browsers, not sure if we want to divert too much from their detection in this case.. This sounds good!. Yeah this makes sense. It shouldn't depend on it just because I provide a service provider for it.. Great stuff!. I added your user agent to the test in https://github.com/jenssegers/agent/commit/deabb66d2fb6de930514edfa643a815c5729a2ba. As far as I know symfony/psr-http-message-bridge is not used in this library.. @ayumihamsaki composer.lock only makes sense for projects. You should scan your project with this as a dependency.. Any chance you would be up for a pull request to contribute?. For mobile devices, agent uses https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect. It would be best to create the issue over there and it will be automatically be included in agent \ud83d\udc4c . This package is built to be framework-agnostic, recommending the Facade would only benifit Laravel users. If you want to use the Agent class in tests, it's better to inject a mock for it.. Thanks!. Can you delete this comment? Might be better to put a general comment above this variable because this applies to other entries as well.\n. ",
