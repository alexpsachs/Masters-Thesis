Can I close https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/issues/363?\n. Hi @askannon,\nIs this still an issue after #1300?. Thanks for clarifying @askannon! \nWe'll look into this, but to set expectations, metadata updates are the priority for us to ensure the data is fresh.. Sorry this has been sitting here a while!\nIt's better tracked as an issue since we'll need to change it in several places. I'll close and track in #1757. Thanks for taking a stab at the PR!. Fixed in release 7.0.11.\n. LGTM too.\nAgreed with davinci that we're happy to commit this as-is, the comments may be addressed later if desired.\n@jias0001 please take a look, feel free to merge if no changes required.\n. @jias0001 said it looks fine. Merging :)\n. Fixed in release 7.0.11.\n. I'll close this as the fix needs to be different and we're tracking the issue at #791.. Fixed in release 7.0.11.\n. Hello!\nThe file you have changed is actually a test file. It only includes some regions that we're testing.\nThe implementation does contain Israel: https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/java/libphonenumber/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/CountryCodeToRegionCodeMap.java\nIf you meant to add a test (see @dlyongemallo's comment), please re-open.\n. I'm closing as this issue is infeasible for us to fix at this point. Please re-open if you respond so we pick up on it.. Thanks! Could you merge the latest from master? Then I can merge this.. I removed the protection on master briefly so I can merge this without you need to update your branch.\nI'll close and re-open to get the checks going.. Thanks @dpocock!\nFixing this issue, #828, and #830 may require us changing other systems that depend on this library, which we can't do overnight. It's not our top priority to look into this at the moment. Please bear with us and feel free to contribute a patch to your own fork. I'll keep the PRs open to revisit when we have some free cycles.\n. Hi and sorry for the late turnaround,\nWould you mind filing an issue describing what the problem is that this PR attempts to fix?. I'm closing as this issue is infeasible for us to fix at this point. Please re-open if you respond so we pick up on it.. Please remove tools/java/cpp-build/target/cpp-build-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar, the contents don't change as a result of adding tools/java/java-build/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/BuildMetadataProtoFromXml.java. Sorry I hadn't seen this before.\n. FTR I will reiterate on this to make SingleFileMetadataSourceImpl.java consistent with MultiFileMetadataSourceImpl.java. It's blocked on some other changes which is why I asked Miruna to go ahead with this.\n. Also FWIW the contents of tools/java/cpp-build/target/cpp-build-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar did not change in this commit/PR.\n. Also java/libphonenumber/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/data/PhoneNumberMetadataProtoFile needed to be updated since the metadata changed between generating it for this commit and merging the PR - I did this separately at https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/eb82ee3557fe53b8211f39189438b23fde875dc8\n. I'll send another PR - I'll keep the single file for testing.\n. PhoneNumberMetadataProtoFile, the single file with all regions' phone number metadata, has \"PhoneNumberMetadataProto\" as a prefix, which is what MultiFileMetadataSourceImpl looks for.\nSo I renamed PhoneNumberMetadataProtoFile to SingleFilePhoneNumberMetadataProto.\nPhoneNumberMetadataProtoForTestingFile, the single file with all regions' test metadata, has \"PhoneNumberMetadataProtoForTesting\" as a prefix, which is what TestMetadataTestCase looks for. So I renamed PhoneNumberMetadataProtoForTestingFile to SingleFilePhoneNumberMetadataProtoForTesting.\nThe test metadata is currently not in use, I'm planning an upcoming change to do that.\n. PhoneNumberUtilTest.java changes to follow. These are too many so I want that reviewed separately (see https://github.com/keghani/libphonenumber/commit/0484ebc4cc5f7fe0e13f259b3858483fa58cc957#diff-206c4c9b4bb42e21665fe5c33c2e6beb for how many).\n. Compilation error - I'll send another PR.\n. JAR diffs at ~keghani/GitHub_diffs/53b9fd2/ - protobuf files were all removed.\n. Obsolete\n. Released in 7.2.2\n. Please regenerate checked-in jar files (java-build and cpp-build; anything else?) before making more changes.\n. Closing until I can clarify how this affects other dependencies.\n. Merging, but I still want to discuss above points.\n. Should do removal of the conditional in the existing (regular proto) code to ensure tests pass and metadata doesn't change.\n. Did you mean by googlei18n/libphonenumber#884 ?\n. Still need to merge though and update js metadata etc.\n. That's strange, this should definitely result in JAR changes, this file is included in the java-build JAR.\nThen please run all ant rules and maven to ensure everything compiles, tests pass, and there's no diff in metadata.\n. We investigated this and there is a diff in the JAR file but it's in the non-public implementation of the .class file so doesn't show up in pkgdiff.\n@dlyongemallo please include the JARs and other generated files in this PR.\n. Did you cherry-pick #883 or #884?\n. Thanks! That makes sense. 883 tried to do in nanoproto what we decided to do first in master with 884 and follow up with this. The description for ed306d1 said 884 and since that's the PR we merged (and abandoned 883) that's what I used in the description when merging.\n. @jias0001 @andyst FYI\n. Duplicate of #853. This will be in the next release.\n. And... introduces extra garbage. Will retry.\n. Released in 7.2.3\n. Hi @penmetsaa !\nI updated the release notes here:\n- Your comment above\n- java/release_notes.txt\nPlease check and if they're fine for you merge yourself. Everything else looks good to me.\n. P.S. I only added the last point.\n. I'll wait until 7.2.3 is complete before merging this.\n. Tested a clone of dlyongemallo:master, this works.\nPlease fix indentation then I'll merge.\n. Thanks! I'll review after completing the release.\n. Please remove deleted files from this PR - we'll run build.xml for the next release and update all files in one go.\n. Also - let's do another PR to ensure that obsolete short / phone number metadata files are also deleted.\n. When testing this I also get these 2 files:\njava/carrier/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/carrier/data/config\njava/geocoder/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/geocoding/data/config\nIs this expected? Are they to be checked in?\nEdit: Yes, apparently https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/java/carrier/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/carrier/data/config got updated during a recent release. All the more reason not to do our own updates here, let the process handle everything in one go to have a consistent state.\n. Thanks!\n. Released and verified in 7.2.4\n. @penmetsaa FYI\n. Looks good to me - please update release notes, then I'll merge.\n. I updated the release notes to get rid of \"Pending changes\".\n. @andyst @lararennie FYI\n. Thanks @lararennie! I brought \"Other code changes\" right after \"Backwards-incompatible changes\" + moved non-metadata changes to the top. Noted that any future backwards-incompatible changes should update the most significant release number.\n. cc @dlyongemallo \n. To squash - git commit -a --amend\nThis actually is 2 commits but 1 PR :) It's better though in general in my opinion since we can see the diff if you change anything later (so we don't review what was already done).\n. LGTM\n. Thanks @pappacena! I'd like to solve a number of other regions in one go, and keep the C++ and JS APIs consistent. It's a bit involved so hard to review as a PR, but I'll give it a shot myself sometime this week. I filed #990.\n. Thanks for your support @pappacena :)\nI'm working with the team to get this out in the next release. Thanks for your patience!\nIndonesia turned out not to be relevant for this change anymore, but I'm adding Argentina and Mexico.\nI'm going to close this pull request and track the issue at #990.\n. Hi again,\nJust to set expectations - this is unlikely to be in the next release as I have less time than usual given the Easter holidays. I'm targeting the one after. Many thanks for your patience.\n. Also update the comment above please :)\n. Thanks Aravind! LG\n. Thanks!\n. Looks great, thanks! I left some comments but feel free to iterate on them.

In general looks good, but I want to patch it in and do some release dry runs once the build is resolved, on my machine - to make sure you didn't do local setup to get some minor bug to work - which I did once :)\n. I'll take a look next week given upcoming holidays and deadlines.\n. Actually why include the jar files? They're not generated with these poms.\n. Yeah I got that diff too when doing the Maven hierarchy fix (https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1160), it's the new getExampleNumber API and isNumberGeographical. Let's do them separately (even separately from the Maven hierarchy fix) after this.\n. Also should we add this to the pending changes? It doesn't affect the code, it's just a test for us, right?\n. I ran a test in another branch (https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commit/69ada95b369ce601e2602359c26765b04d833cba). Running mvn package from java/ results in no changes to tracked files (and none to Phonemetadata.java).\nCan you try mvn package in a clean setup from java/? We should not be changing Phonemetadata.java, I wonder if this will come up for you every time.\n. Running mvn package from root with these pom.xml file changes also gives me no changes in Phonemetadata.java (only in the checked-in jar files and some untracked files, as expected).\nprotoc --version gives libprotoc 2.6.1, but this may be different than your 2.6.1 (I think installed from sources).\nwhich protoc gives /usr/bin/protoc\nWhat do you have under ~/.m2/repository/com/google/protobuf/protobuf-java/? I have just one directory, 2.6.1.\n. Can we limit the scope here to the 4 pom.xml files? The changes there by themselves don't cause the changes in the jars or Phonemetadata.java. We can investigate that in https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1172 and https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1170.\nThe pom.xml files by themselves look good for merging.\n. Thanks, LG :)\n. Hi @gjasny,\nAre you interested in / able to help us get this PR merged in the foreseeable future?\nSorry Windows hasn't seen much love lately, but we don't actively maintain Windows builds and couldn't test such a PR.\nIf someone else in the open-source community (@ginggs?

Thanks for taking a look at #442 @marado!\nThis task is unfortunately much bigger than one file as @lararennie mentioned at #442.\nMoreover PhoneNumberUtil.java does not support short numbers. This is also mentioned in our FAQ at Why does PhoneNumberUtil return false for valid short numbers?\nWe can't accept a pull request for #442 as there is significant work and testing involved for such a change, and reviewing it would be almost as much work as doing it ourselves. We can't prioritize this right now as metadata updates are prioritized over code changes, except for bug fixes; and we have quite a significant backlog.\nI'll close this PR as we're tracking the issue already. As @lararennie mentioned in the issue, you're welcome to build your own solution on top of PhoneNumberMatcher.java until we have the cycles to pick this up.\n. Unfortunately we can't accept pull requests for large coding tasks at this time. The testing and the domain knowledge not to break existing use cases is rather large and we don't have the bandwidth to look into it right now. And we approach adding new API methods with caution and consideration as such methods cannot lightly be removed, so we can't just add a new functionality either.

This PR doesn't change that, blacklist is the same. I don't have historical context into documenting that in GitHub.. Jar diffs in this PR (from master) look as expected, but I still get some more diffs when I build locally. Maybe because some changes happened since they were created? (Maybe even in master that we brought back in?)\nNone of the metadata changes as a result of this though, so I'll merge. I might send something separately..

Great, thanks!. Needs further discussion, closing for now.. I suspect some of the .class diffs are because I compiled with Java 7.\nBut others are actual changes, e.g. descHasData (also seen in the .java changes).\nThe metadata file changes are because the metadata was re-generated after the build tools jar was re-generated (with it), then they end up in the jar when we build it again. It's not used in the jar but is in the same directory as a resource the jar uses (Phonemetadata.java), so just a side-effect of how we build right now.. Done.. No worries! I thought about that too, I think it's because by the end of the initialization's try block it's definitely initialized since it couldn't fail on that line. So whether or not it gets to that catch, it's still in scope? Don't know enough about JS much less its compiler, but seems feasible.. Please see the release description. We had given a heads up for this change months ago, and sent a reminder last week too.. Thanks for the pull request @voronaam!\nThis is unfortunately not enough. As @lararennie mentioned at #467, we need to research if people are using commas to \"wait\", and we need to have a signal so that we don't allow commas when detecting numbers in text. We can't prioritize working on or reviewing this anytime soon, thanks for understanding.. E.g. whether some users (internationally) use this notation to indicate 2 separate numbers - see @lararennie's question at #467. We don't want to make a change in the library that would work for some users but break others.. Diffs: ~keghani/GitHub_diffs/PR1708/. (please ignore the JS build.xml file commits, they're due to b/37535483 but not affecting anyone else right now...)\nIf you squash the PR they won't show up in master :). Yes, I'd like it merged because upcoming changes will do actual changes to the build tools and I'd like the diff then to reflect no distracting info.. I think we have to keep the Google copyright.\nIt's not a problem though, we can still implement this on our side I think with the ITU doc - it's a public doc, so shouldn't be a problem.\nWould you mind filing an issue just for us to implement the doc then? You don't need a CLA in that case.\nSorry for the back and forth, it's not a great experience to have you prepare the PR and have to wait to go the issue route :( For future ref you can always check the latest way to do things in the contribution guidelines.. Hi @gapatterson,\n@lararennie left a comment about multiple locations which still needs to be resolved. See one of the \"outdated diff\"s above.\nAlso please don't squash commits so we can clearly see the diff rather than having to re-review the file every time. We will squash when we merge into master. . Thanks for iterating @gapatterson!\n\nThe en file is really granular now and it's a lot of work to review and double-check for not as much value. I prefer we go with the ITU doc for this PR, and increase the scope and granularity in followup iterations.\nWould be great if we could keep es around the same size as en. I think the es size now is reasonable. en is ~43000 mappings, es ~400.\nMultiple areas should be resolved the same way everywhere, also between en and es. Currently it looks like es is doing something different. We already have other geocoding files where we made a decision about multiple locations, see en/1.txt. We shouldn't make the Mexico geocoding have such different rules about which state/city we mention.\n\nThe English file is in all-caps in some places which is not consistent with other geocoding files we have. Also the delimiters are not standard. For an example of how we use delimiters, see en/1.txt. So:\n\nIf you're saying just the state, it would be\n    Pueblo\nIf it's 2 cities in a state, then it's\n    Ajalpan/Calipan, PUE\nWhen there are more than 2 states I wouldn't mention the cities at that point, this is unlikely to be useful when for example I'm getting a call and want to see where it's from:\n    Ajalpan/Calipan PUE, Cuicatlan/Huautla de Jimenez/Teotitlan del Camino OAX\nI would rather see this as a user:\n    Pueblo/Oaxaca. Yes, from a quick look that looks great!\nShould I review? Or did you want to make more changes before that?. Thanks @gapatterson!\nI'm out for a few days and the release will happen in the meantime so I'll look at this afterwards to avoid sync issues for you. Thanks for understanding!. Thanks @gapatterson! Almost there, just these issues left.\nIf you don't have time to address them that's fine, I'm happy to merge this and make the changes afterwards:\n\n\n\nen file has 5259 but es has this split into 52591-52596, 52599. We probably want the en file to do it like es?\n\nen file has 5269 but es has this split into 52694-52698. Same thoughts.\nI think you missed a slash in en for 52765, it doesn't match the structure of the es line:\n    en: 52765|Alamo Temapache/Alazan Potrero Del Llano, VER\n    es: 52765|\u00c1lamo Temapache/Alaz\u00e1n/Potrero del Llano, VER\n\nThere is QROO in both files, did you mean QRO?\n\n\n52427: en says Quintana Roo, es says QRO, should be consistent.\n\n52867: en says Tamaulipas, es says TAMPS, should be consistent.\n\nThanks so much for doing this!\n. Actually you're all set! You resolved everything I had pointed out :)\nI'll merge this then. Thanks a lot for sticking with it!. Thanks! Please link to an issue with a clear description of what this intends to fix. See the PR contribution guidelines.. Do these instructions not work for them?\nWhere did \"the user\" report this?\nI'm not sure how to verify that this will solve their problem, and not break other people's setup.. Is olesyaksyon@ from https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/issues/1864 your user?\nUsing Google Translate, from the snippet of the issue you shared, I can't tell that it's an issue with our file rather than the user's setup. We should have a series of commands that would reproduce the issue on their setup before we consider changing what appears to be working for other users.. She said on that issue that she's got it working now.. Thanks for confirming @olesyaksyon!\nWe don't want to require that anything be built from source. Released dependencies are more stable and I still don't see an issue with anyone not being able to build our libraries, so I'm going to close this.\nIf there are issues, please file an issue as mentioned in our contribution guidelines, describing clearly how to reproduce it. If it's something to do with our scripts or setup then we'd love to fix it. If it's to do with people's setup we will try to provide support as long as we can see how to reproduce it.\nFor personal preferences you can always make your own fork and maintain your own CMakeLists.txt the way you prefer.. Re-opened to re-kick off CLA checks.... You can revert like so (from the branch):\ngit reset --hard 75f90bb\ngit push --force. Please change to\n  http://www.viestintavirasto.fi/attachments/maaraykset/Regulation_32.pdf [2015-04-15]\nas that's what I'm using to verify and we can both agree on that source.\n. Change \"mobile/service/national\" to \"mobile/nationwide\" to minimize confusion between this and document.\n. According to page 24 this should also be expanded to include 35891 through 35898.\n. remove blank line\n. I know it's supposed to do the same thing, but I would prefer this stay the way it was, to be sure that this change is not going to affect clients. Tests should still pass. @dlyongemallo thoughts?\n. Why protected? Can't this be private?\n. Also, looks like the name if left over from a previous class definition? Did you mean multiFileMetadataSource?\n. delete blank line\n. I don't know whether they're in use.\n. Are you sure the default PhoneNumberDesc is null? Or is it a PhoneNumberDesc with all the fields set to their defaults?\n. I would add\nhasEmergency(PhoneMetadata metadata) {\n        PhoneNumberDesc emergency = metadata.emergency;\n        return !emergency.national_number_pattern.equals(\"\") ||\n               !emergency.possible_number_pattern.equals(\"\") ||\n               !emergency.example_number.equals(\"\");\n    }\nAnother candidate for NanoUtils.java :)\n. Put the declaration of in inside the try, to make consistent with MultiFileMetadataSourceImpl.java.\n. Technically, this is not a list. I'm willing to let it go.\n. ditto\n. Please pull out these into a helper:\nexactlySameAs(PhoneNumberDesc, PhoneNumberDesc)\n. Different from other \"has\" checks - I'd prefer !intlFormat.format.equals(\"\")\n. Ditto\n. Move to new helper method copyGeneralDesc(...).\nAlso, why don't you copy when empty? It shouldn't matter.\n. Interesting - did this need to be .toString() before?\n. I'm surprised this ever worked - protos should never return null if I remember correctly.\nIn this case, it should be the empty PhoneNumberDesc, non?\n. Ditto\n. \"Also\" doesn't mean anything anymore.\n. Should have a helper function that takes care of the CodedOutputByteBufferNano; e.g.:\nwritePhoneMetadataCollection(PhoneMetadataCollection, OutputStream);\n. Should not be UPPER_CASE; should probably be final though.\n. Ditto on UPPER_CASE and final; you don't need to change this though, we should pull it out to NanoUtils instead (as a true constant).\n. Should have a helper function that takes care of the CodedOutputByteBufferNano; e.g.:\nwritePhoneMetadataCollection(PhoneMetadataCollection, ObjectOutputStream);\n. Ditto on taking out into a separate function\n. \"single\" here is confusing - is it one collection, or a single file for all regions?\nEdit: I know it's meant to be one collection, but it's confusing given the other terminology for \"single\".\nWhy change from outMetadataCollection?\n. The reason I want this to do the check the other way  is because we're conceptually checking for \"hazzness\", and all places where we do that should be consistent.\nAnyway, I don't think this is relevant anymore as I want to encapsulate hazzers into the util class. Let's talk about it.\n. extra space before source\n. Note to self: TODO here\n. What time zone is this supposed to be? UTC? I wonder why it's not in epoch seconds.\nIs it necessary? I'm wondering how we would maintain it and what the risk is of doing it wrong.\n. Thanks for moving this out of java/pom.xml :)\n. Fun fact: we have junit-4.8.1.jar under java/lib. I wonder what Maven is using, and who is using the one under java/lib.\n. The maven-jar-plugin changes are not related to the fix, but a cleanup.\norg.apache.maven.plugins is still the groupId, it's an implicit default.\n. indentation\n. s/fix/Fix\n. Also please add \"Code changes:\" between \"Pending changes\" and the bullet (to distinguish from Metadata changes)\n. This applies to particularly to - remove first to\n. s/doesn't/hasn't\nor\ns/supported/support\n. This should be updated to include the pending changes\n. Bold instead of italic? To be consistent with the rest (can be a separate patch)\n. Again with the Tip:\n. I don't understand \"To make a number dialable\" - presumably this is going from E.164 to national format? Isn't E.164 diallable inside the country too?\n. I think at the negative of this, given in some places you actually can't have prefixes of numbers, there's \"If I can dial a number then it's safe to store it\" or similar, re. canonicalization/truncation/uniqueness.\nCan be a separate patch.\n. We wrapped https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/master/FAQ.md at 80 characters, should keep it consistent.\n. Ah, I just saw the next one. Ignore this comment :)\n. I think it was 15 FYI. No need to change though, you say \"things like\"\n. I'm not actually sure that vanity numbers are understood everywhere. I hadn't seem them til I lived in the States. I wonder if some readers won't understand 1-800-MICROSOFT. Maybe have a footer explaning that this would dial 1-800-648767638?\n. This doesn't seem to have been changed automatically. It was in https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1031/commits/96051cb910f3e2e598b8c705767e7ad9a500d2d6\nDo you need the manual changes? Otherwise you can remove them from your branch before sending a pull request. @dlyongemallo can explain how to do this.\n. Done\n. Sounds good, please go ahead with\ncom.google.i18n.phonenumbers.repackaged.com.google.protobuf\nAlso please indent 2 spaces to the right, then I can merge this. Many thanks!\n. Ah, you're right. I lost my thread of thought due to the line wrapping :) Looks good!\nI'll merge and patch this within a week at the latest. I want to release it separately from the metadata release this week, as 7.4.0 - and we have a public holiday coming up so may not be this week.\n. If you want to have it on multiple lines, please split like so:\n...\n<pattern>com.google.protobuf</pattern>\n<shadedPattern>\n  com.google.i18n.phonenumbers.repackaged.com.google.protobuf\n</shadedPattern>\n...\nIt could also be on a single line, I had just misread it earlier.\n. @lararennie Can we change this back to what was automatically generated?\n55_pt was actually new this time (it was removed in a recent release): https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commits/master/java/geocoder/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/geocoding/data/55_pt\nAnd we've always included the entire 1xxx numbers according to the file names - see libphonenumber-7.1.1 release notes for example.\n. Please delete trailing space on line 6 (also elsewhere in this file if applicable)\n. Please delete extra line 8\n. Please add blank line above line 15\n. The date is actually 2015-01-13 (it says Communication of 13.I.2015)\n. This is Nimroz in the ITU doc\n. Wikipedia doesn't have any extra information not found in the ITU doc, please remove this\n. 2016 (also in the other files)\n. Also please remove trailing spaces (at ends of lines) in this file\n. Missing a hash\n. Please also clean trailing spaces\n. Delete extra line 14\n. Please insert a blank line above line 17\n. Ah you're right! I missed that there are several communications in that document. Please keep this date :)\nSome mobile numbers are actually geocoded (e.g. in the United States), but that's not the case here.\n. Added line numbers for everything (edited comments) - does that make sense?\n. Thanks for bringing this up!\nThis is Nimruz in the latest release of CLDR (http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/29/supplemental/territory_subdivisions.html) so let's go with that.\n. Line 1: Please add a space after the hash\n. Line 23 and the following Irancell lines still have trailing spaces, please remove\n. Please break line 16 after the URL, it's too long.\nAlso please keep \"page\" lowercase as it's not a new sentence, and \"page 2 and above\" is not clear and may be read as \"page 1 and 2\". You don't need to mention the page though, we don't usually do this. Example possibilities:\n```\nhttps://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/02/02/T02020000010002PDFE.pdf\nstarting page 2 [2008-08-28]\n```\nor\n```\nhttps://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/02/02/T02020000010002PDFE.pdf\n[2008-08-28]\n```\n. This class is not hand-generated.\nDid you generate the changes? Or were these added manually?\n. Also I can't leave a comment on the jar files - we need to regenerate them before merging (to get the latest from the master merges), and squash the commits.\n. Ah, that's good (that it was auto-generated) :)\nI'll patch it in and see if I get the same output.\n. Re. dependence on PhoneNumberUtil, I don't know the background, but this is indeed what's being generated. Thanks for bringing it up, filed b/29532528.\nSounds good not to add to pending changes. I'll update and ping for another look.\n. Apparently this artifact moved.\n. These are just the version numbers my setup was using by default I suppose, I don't have a strong preference if you want different versions. This works.\n. More background on this change at https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1191\n. forkMode is deprecated, was giving some ambiguous warning about how this is incompatible with the default version of some other flag we're not even setting.\n. Unused\n. Unused\n. There is currently a PR (https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1206) requesting to change this to Ucom.\nLet's hold on reviewing this until that question is resolved to keep the English/Armenian/Russian metadata for Armenia consistent.\n. Please provide evidence that this change took place.\nTo contribute evidence please see our contribution guidelines.\n. Sorry for the trouble, I just realized we have AM geocoding in Armenian - wrongly under language code \"am\"!\nWould you mind instead moving https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/resources/geocoding/am/374.txt and editing it?\n. Unblocking this review - @mhamlet shared evidence that Orange ranges now belong to Ucom: http://www.orange.com/en/Press-and-medias/press-releases-2016/press-releases-2015/Orange-signs-an-agreement-with-Ucom-for-the-sale-of-100-of-its-shares-in-Orange-Armenia (thanks @mhamlet!)\n@armleo please update the Orange ranges to Ucom.\n. Please make this 2016\n. Please change to \"# Translated manually from en/374.txt.\" to be consistent with https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/resources/geocoding/ru/374.txt - we track sources at the en/ files.\n. typo?\n. Sure. Note that there's no \"hy\" folder currently, you'll have to create it. Thanks!\n. (I meant in master - there's definitely an \"hy\" folder in your branch :) Sorry for the confusion!)\n. FYI lines 15 and 16 still need to change before I can merge this.\n. Please delete line 16 with the Wikipedia link and add a period at the end of line 15.\nSee https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/resources/geocoding/ru/374.txt - we want to be consistent with that.\n. This is not new though - it was always limited to providing the stream. Not sure how much I can change, it's a public interface: https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/java/libphonenumber/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/MetadataLoader.java\nIts javadoc explains that it's about providing a stream. You're right though, it's an unfortunate name, I had to double-read all the methods to understand when changing the code (loadMetadataFromFile, loadMetadata, loadMetadataAndCloseInput).\n. I see we already changed this in the English file! Nice catch, thanks :)\n. The English file is still saying Aygezard for this, and I don't get results for \"\u0531\u0575\u0563\u0565\u057e\u0561\u0566\" on a Google search.\nPlease provide more information about this change, such as online or local information about Aygevaz and that this is the name preferred over Aygezard (see our contribution guidelines).\n. Google Search results seem to suggest that \u0531\u0575\u0576\u0569\u0561\u057a is more common (I get 180,000 results for \u0531\u0575\u0576\u0569\u0561\u057a vs. 60,000 for \u0531\u0575\u0576\u0569\u0561\u0583). Also I'm personally only familiar with \u0531\u0575\u0576\u0569\u0561\u057a :) This is also the name in Maps: https://goo.gl/maps/oGtt5UCLsXo\n. Why add \"\u0577\u0580\u057b\u0561\u0576\"? Is it to be consistent with the English use of \"region\" for these ranges?\nDoes the use of \"\u0577\u0580\u057b\u0561\u0576\" make a difference to a local person? How about using \"Ashotsk region\" instead of \"Ashotsk\" in English, would they mean different things? If not, maybe we remove \"region\" from the English file.\n. Also here (same question about region - and below)\n. Yes! But not here, if all succeeds we need the InputStream open to continue. Re-organized the try-blocks.\n. Done. Except in the single file impl, here we expect it to happen since the Maven jar doesn't package the single file :) No one should be using that unless they're packaging their own build.\n. This works when I change to MetadataManager! Done\n. Defined in MetadataManager, added comments (long-term I'll move all this logic there, doesn't make sense to have 3 extra files just for the regular loading).\n. Defined in MetadataManager, added comments\n. ois.close() also closes source. But if ois is null (as in if the ObjectInputStream initialization failed) then we want to attempt closing source independently.\n. I believe @dlyongemallo wrote the numbers this way to signify that 1024 bytes is a Kb, so this is 16 Kb (power-of-2 ceiling of the largest per-region binary metadata file with room for growth), and the other is 256 Kb (power-of-2 ceiling of the single binary metadata file containing all regions' metadata, with room for growth - we don't support clients using this - it's experimental - and we don't ship this file to Maven Central).\n. s/Chin/China :)\n. These 2 should come right after void TrimUnwantedEndChars(string* number) const;\n?\n. Hmm, this is different from in PhoneNumberUtilTest.java. There GB_MOBILE has 7912345678 for the national number.\nAlso shouldn't PhoneNumberUtilTest.java be updated with these changes?\n. I see, thanks!\n. Move this test to the test method testing GetLengthOfGeographicalAreaCode :)\nAnd add a test for GetLengthOfNationalDestinationCode for China with comment:\n// A mobile number from China is geographical, but does not have an area code:\n  // however it still can be considered to have a national destination code.\n. This is still calling GetLengthOfGeographicalAreaCode, should change to GetLengthOfNationalDestinationCode?\n. Nice, did you generate this following these instructions? I'm excited to hear they worked for someone other than me :)?\n. (and were readable/understandable)\n. No strong opinions - but we usually use '-' instead of '*' (release notes aren't meant to be markdown although they do end up in PR descriptions). See https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/642590c597a49b526e632dc90770fc74b8a794ea/java/pending_code_changes.txt\nOptional\n. Also the release notes end up without a blank line between different types of sections, although this is also confusing for the PR description :) https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/642590c597a49b526e632dc90770fc74b8a794ea/java/release_notes.txt\nb/28013360\nJust FYI. We should fix at some point.\n. Let's remove \"Pending\", from above too.\nIn this file we make it as easy as possible to merge automatically during the release.\nThe file is already called \"pending\", here we make it just \"Code changes\" and \"Metadata changes\". That part currently does not merge automatically into the release notes (b/31174165).\n. It's Phonemetadata.java with a lowercase 'm'.\nAlso, please leave a space before the '-' to be consistent with release notes:\nnomarkdown\nCode changes:\n - Phonemetadata.java...\nAlso below.\n. Actually was Phonemetadata.java changed in this PR? I don't see it anymore :S\n. Why don't we want the closing ] at the end of the previous line?\n. Please add version number here and other plugins as well to keep the Maven build hermetic.\n. The -P travis ensures that the travis profile is invoked from the pom.xml file [1][2], which I configured not to build the cpp-build module.\nThis command will run by default during the \"install\" phase by Travis, without the -P travis though by default [3][4]. I explicitly added it in this file to add the argument.\nDo you think I should add a comment in this file? I think I can do that with a #.\n[1] http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8304110/skip-a-submodule-during-a-maven-build\n[2] http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html\n[3] https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/java#Dependency-Management\n[4] https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build#The-Build-Lifecycle\n. Actually I made a mistake about the Maven version - I had thought that it was getting protoc from the protobuf-java dependency but it's not (that's used for the runtime dependencies, not to generate the files).\nChanged the comments, I'll push the changes momentarily.\n. Done (commit coming up)\n. BuildMetadataFromXml.java refers to this method, so it needs to have the same name as the generated file for the C++ build. Are you asking about making the names in this file consistent long-term?\n. To answer your question - I don't know which is more \"modern\", no clue at which proto version this file was first created :)\n. This was written like this earlier (in 7.1.1). Do we really want to change it in this effort? I'm wary of making side fixes generally and more so in such large diffs.\n. No strong opinions from me, do you want us to :)? I would guess not, since I'm not the author and could not e.g. answer someone asking how this file was generated, e.g. at which version to run protoc to know what new methods should look like.\n. cl/131812609 :)\nIf you prefer I can change this here later. It's just more consistent with the file name constant and other names in this file.\n. (I didn't want to sneak in side changes here, this was the way it was before but for some reason was renamed in summer of 2015).\n. I decided to do it in this commit but - I actually don't know how it was compiled!\nWorth figuring this out and having it be consistent with the protobuf-java version in the C++ build tools if possible. I'll track separately.\n. What do you mean? Which file is it based off?\nI mentioned in the commit that it's \"almost what it was in 7.1.1\", do you mean phonemetada.proto? I didn't generate it from that, I just rolled back and added new API by hand (mentioned in commit).\n. Can do as part of the larger cleanup of C++ build tools and figuring out how to compile everything.\nb/31538828\n. I see :) Updated commit description.\n. Not blocking this PR, but - why write the functions we don't call?\n. Did you mean to get rid of the first assignment?\nI don't know JS so unsure what's going on otherwise :S\n. Here too\n. Here too\n. Feels like these lines could fit more?\n. Formatting is inconsistent with current release notes (blank line, one dash, space before dash, align wrapped lines). Should be more like:\nnomarkdown\nBuild changes:\n - OSGi ...\nCode changes:\n - Formatting, ...\n   guide\n - Removal ...\n   PhoneNumberTo...\n. I think we should mention JS possible lengths.\nIMO we don't need to mention the internal changes like style fixes and private method removal.\n. But can if you want :)\n. Good point :)\n. LGTM :)\n. Optional: remove blank line\n. Flagging as possibly needing to change due to offline discussion\n. Also below...\n. Please indent wrapped line to start at the same lace as \"Using\".\n. What impact does this have on the versioning scheme? Could argue for x.0.0 or x.y.z - what did we do for regular numbers?\n. Ack, thanks!\n. Done\n. Please add line after this for assertEquals(\"\", metadata.getGeneralDesc().getExampleNumber());\n. I would be explicit about whether we're talking about the XML or proto or both for each restriction, since they don't have the same rules.\n. I don't see a commit in master with an IR change since the last release? https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commits/master\nIf it's a pending pull request let's not merge until this PR is in. I say this PR is priority, and we merge it before any other open PRs at this point; since it'd be a pain to sync with the base branch this otherwise.\nIn case I'm missing something and there is an IR change:\nWe'll have to merge this manually anyway, but it's less likely to be missed or have formatting errors by the merger if it's last (after code changes) since that's where the rest of the metadata changes will show.\nAnd since you're using the proper format anyway, optionally add a ':' after changes :)\n. (a) MetadataSource and all 2 of its implementations (1, 2) are non-public so even when we say public PhoneNumberUtil.createInstance(MetadataSource) public usage cannot pass anything to this method. FWIW I put this in the pending changes too.\n(b) Clients can call getInstance(), which under the hood will (the first time) do the same as calling createInstance(new MultiFileMetadataSourceImpl(DEFAULT_METADATA_LOADER)) - (any time after that it will use the already created instance). The alternative would be to use their own loader, which they can do via createInstance(MetadataLoader), or to specify SingleFileMetadataSourceImpl, which they programmatically cannot do, and which we don't support anyway (no jars with single file right now).\n. To clarify that last point, the second \"alternative\" is actually not possible right now, even with this method signature staying public. I'm not saying it wouldn't be good to have it public, or that it's not useful for clients, but it's not usable so the signature shouldn't say public.\n. Was this automatic?. Yep, looks like it.\nIn the first commit it was v8.0.1, then the second commit made it HEAD. This looks expected, and the file ended up at https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/releases/tag/v8.0.1 with the v8.0.1 tag on this line.\n==> No blockers for merging @kkeshava :). please make region_dialing_from (to be consistent with other files). Not Done?. string&. (and const). This doesn't linkify properly on some editors, please use https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%AA_%D7%98%D7%9C%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C instead.. Please remove extra line\n(I see we also have an extra line at the end of the English file for 972.txt, I'll remove that too unless you want to do that in this PR).. Shouldn't this be \u05ea\u05dc \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d1? In the English file we only say Tel Aviv.. It's fine to have it be longer in this case, we have that in some other files too, e.g. https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/resources/geocoding/iw/82.txt\nThanks!. I could link to https://github.com/orgs/googlei18n/teams/libphonenumber but we don't update the 2 lists concurrently so adding it here would just be a statement we couldn't uphold. E.g. not everyone in that list reads the supporting docs.. Done. I don't know about a policy. I was paraphrasing best as I could from jungshik's explanations, I still don't have VS so don't appreciate the nuances :) I updated the language, WDYT?. CLDR?. Can it not be 001 here?. CLDR? (for region). again, CLDR. or 001?. oh I see, sorry for the noise!. can this and the next one be 001?. should we update this every release?. Please remove the (pg-libphonenumber) part to be consistent with other lines (we don't repeat the name of the repo). Should this have a phase and goals, and a classifier in the configuration, to be consistent with the execution below?. Weird that this increased by 3. I see only 2 new regions: TA and +882 (just wondering). Oh never mind - I see the 25 became 27 so that's fine.. (It's a load factor thing). Yes it's weird :). I don't understand what this means.. I didn't know this! Done. (coming up). Find the version you care about inside the top-level element in the corresponding pom.xml file.\nOR\nFind the version you care about in the corresponding pom.xml file inside the top-level element.\n?\nI guess the second IIUC. Makes sense, thanks! Updated :). This is what we've said when explaining that timezone metadata is auto-generated: https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/issues/1265, https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/issues/1131, https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/issues/1133\nIt's different for timezone metadata (and maybe certain regions' geocoding) than any other bugs, because it's about making an automatic fix that fixes the issues and doesn't change anything else. So the \"fix\" is to the process, not the metadata; and it has to be generic, not about the given issue.. Done. Done. :). Done. Done.

Between the GitHub release and the demo update it would say the new number but not be updated yet.\nI still don't see why anyone would want the number on the README page when it's incorrect some of the time, and they need to know the caveat about it being off from the release. I think the only potential improvement over not having anything there would be to explicitly say the demo was updated, so I put that other language in.. Done. Done. Done.\nNew language:\nCaveat: We do not provide data about the current carrier of a phone number, only\nthe original carrier who is assigned the corresponding range. Read about [number\nportability](FAQ.md#what-is-mobile-number-portability).. Updated whole section..

Fredrik's comment was on an outdated version of the file, I changed it. This is what he had suggested and if IIUC he doesn't think this one's unobvious - what he didn't think I should do was save the previous value of errno and set back to it if I come back with 0, which is what I had at commit 53642bf\nMaybe let's discuss this in person. I'm happy with implementing it any way since you both know more here, but I'd like to understand it.. 1.

If so, the title should be more descriptive than \"Update FAQ.md\".\nThere already is a direct link to the M2M section:\nhttps://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/FAQ.md#what-about-m2m-machine-to-machine-numbers\nYour suggested syntax won't work, as you can see here:\nhttps://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/2dd50472f61bbdc9ed483d960e27ddec0a10fc7b/FAQ.md#what-about-m2m-machine-to-machine-numbers-m2m_faq\nI'm not sure where you got this idea from? \nYou could do something like this:\n### What about M2M (machine to machine) numbers?<a name=\"m2m_faq\"></a>\nBut then you'll end up with two hyperlinks to the section header.\n. This seems wrong to me. 962 is Jordan, so I expected Amman rather than Riyadh here.\n. Put the same comment (\"It is assumed...\") here. Also, while you're at it, you might as well swap the order to put the other one first (since this one calls that one).\n. weird spacing/indentation\n. I wasn't going to mention this, but since Keghani mentioned it in the other file, remove this extra newline too.\n. Weird alignment.\n. It's fine either way.\n. This was garbled.\n. Is the interior \"==\" supposed to be \"||\"? Or \"&&\"?\nIf it's indeed meant to be \"==\" (i.e., they are both null or both non-null), there should be a comment to that effect, or the logic rewritten to make that clear.\n. Discussed in person: this is supposed to check that one and only one of them is non-null.\n. Slightly inconsistent with MultiFileMetadataSourceImpl.java here: there, loadMetadataAndCloseInput takes in an ObjectInputStream already. It doesn't matter too much since these are private, but it'd be nice if they were consistent.\n. Would it make sense to rename the other rule too, e.g., to \"build-multi-file-phone-metadata\"? And then have a comment above them both that exactly one of them should be used? (Same comment re: test targets.)\n. Okay, let's leave it then.\n. This is an array. The elements must be copied.\n. The default value for emergency is indeed null here.\n. Actually, the default value is null. See the nano/Phonemetadata.java file line 426 below.\n. Actually, I can inline it inside the call to loadMetadataAndCloseInput.\n. I think it's fine. Conceptually, it's still a list, just implemented as an array. The array object is just called \"metadata\" in the nanoproto, which is confusing.\n. Also defaulted to null.\n. Okay.\n. Okay.\nWhat about existing calls to \"isEmpty()\", like line 144 above?\n. Okay.\n. As you can see in the lines immediately above, these are already strings, so it wasn't necessary. I think it was necessary at some point in the past, but hasn't been for a while.\n. Done.\n. As discussed, this is used by maven to check against, e.g., ~/.m2/repository/com/google/protobuf/protobuf-java/2.6.1/protobuf-java-2.6.1.jar.lastUpdated - to determine whether a local version is newer or older than the one checked into our repo.\n. There are some path issues with the junit that's checked in. We should fix that.\n. Misaligned. But so is the same message in 7.0.8 down below. The script that generates this needs to be fixed, but don't worry about it for now.\n. Won't it be more confusing if short number info shows for some numbers but not others? Okay, I can wrap this in a test for validity.\n. As long as it's not garbage collected, I think. Why?\n. Done.\n. As discussed, I added another warning here. @roes \n. This was by design. It was intended to display the input plus the error.\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nKilling the request would remove the information about the error which is currently displayed.\n. Done.\n. I didn't want to add a GWT or Guava dependency. There's already a dependency on org.apache.commons.\n. The error string comes from a fixed set of strings, btw, so there's no danger of something unexpected there.\n. As discussed, also escaped the exception message since it's output to HTML. In fact, added escaping even to output of libphonenumber when the result is printed to HTML.\n. This shouldn't need escaping since it's an integer.\n. I've moved the exception below.\n. Good point.\n. Done.\n. @hagbard - Any opinion on this link? @roes thinks we should remove it since it'll already be in the URL.\n. I can't make it relative as it has to work from github. (That is, unless we don't link back from the github issue.)\n. This is linking from a github issue back to the demo result page for the number which the issue is about. That should be really useful for us.\n. I think your above comment is actually about this link? I'll remove it.\n. I've changed the code to use Locale throughout.\n. done\n. Done.\n. Sure. But the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md are not wrapped at 80, so it's inconsistent either way.\n. Done.\n. Done.\n. I'll have to research how vanity numbers work in non-English-speaking countries.\n. Okay, I edited in the example from that PR.\n. GitHub handles it fine. Some systems have trouble, though. For example, my vim preview only highlights the part up to the newline in the preview. It's not a problem, I'll wrap it to be consistent.\n. Edited the explanation.\n. Revised the whole thing.\n. Done.\n. okay.\n. Done.\n. Done.\n. ",

It's easier to prioritize work which is aligned with primary use-cases of the library and so far there has been little demand for this functionality in JavaScript.\nIf you need this functionality now, I'd suggest to arrange it (for now) in a way to keep the functionality in separate files rather than touching phonenumberutil.js (i.e. moving the new bits related to matching which are in phonenumberutil.js over to phonenumbermatcher.js. That way you can have this functionality in a Github fork / your own code base without needing to maintain patches to libphonenumber.\nWe'll reevaluate the situation in a few months.

We even represent ranges defined as being \"Mostly land-line\" in this\n+way.\n+\n+### What about M2M (machine to machine) numbers?\n+\n+libphonenumber does not support M2M numbers at the moment, but might in the\n+future.\n+\n+One of the reasons libphonenumber doesn't supported M2M so far is because no one\n\ns/doesn't/hasn't\nor\ns/supported/support\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/987/files#r54739072.\n. This doesn't look right to me.\nWe can't replace \"USE_BOOST\" check with \"USE_BOOST OR BUILD_GEOCODER\" when the check is guarding includes for Boost headers.\n. - The latest published documents can also be hopelessly out of date (e.g. over 10 years old).\n- For many countries the information published through the ITU is very incomplete.\n\nShould we also talk about Switzerland? Switzerland doesn't publish their numbering plan in the format recommended by the ITU. ITU is based in Geneva, Switzerland.\n. s/as-is as  entered by the user/as entered by the user/ no?\n. I take this back. In this context this is doing the right thing. My initial reading was wrong.\n. This code needs to continue to work without Boost.\nPlease follow the pattern in https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/cpp/src/phonenumbers/base/memory/scoped_ptr.h to use Boost \"#if defined(I18N_PHONENUMBERS_USE_BOOST)\" and fall back to the current code based on dirent.h.\n. Can you make it right-aligned? It's very nice as a status for us, but it's not what most clients want to see first.\n. s/this affects porters/this may affect ports/\n. Can you summarize again the rationale why\n a) we can make this public method private without this being considered a backwards-incompatible API change?\n b) clients of our library only need access to createInstance(MetadataLoader) but not createInstance(MetadataSource)?\n. Never mind. I see you summarize this in the release notes. Thanks.\n. I'd go with porters (bold / embedded title) instead of porters (italic). s/possible_length/possible_length_local/ ?. add / remove non matches / for the boolean parameter? We have that in Java and had it in one of the call sites in JS too.. s/API in PhoneNumberUtil public./in PhoneNumberUtil public in Java API./\nAnd I'd mention that the method was added to JS too.. Maybe put the first sentence / part of each bullet into bold.\n The country has a single country calling code.\n The country still exists.\n The country has some phone numbers in use that can be ascribed to it.\n It has an assigned region code.. s/ISO/CLDR/\nKosovo still doesn't have an ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code, but CLDR assigned the private-use code XK.. So adding  and dropping the  did the trick?\nThanks for figuring that out!. s/js/JavaScript/ or JS. Is this TODO / note no longer needed? ant compile works now?. I'd reorder them to be most significant change first.. @GoogleJacob first time I see you comment on this project. What's your interest in / relationship with this change / pull-request?\nAlso, regarding this comment and the other comment, what do you mean? It's a bit cryptic. Please elaborate.. Please revert this back to reusing DIGITS rather than writing \"\\p{Nd}\". Please use DIGITS instead of writing \"\\p{Nd}\". Please reference the standards (URL?) which mention comma and semicolon for this purpose.. Instead of extensionPattern I'd call it capturingExtnDigits because the comment below explains that there are three regular expressions involved and arguably those are \"extension patterns\" too (e.g. RFC3966_EXTN_PREFIX).. typo seimcolon -> semicolon. @voronaam: Please ignore GoogleJacob's comments (unless we hear back).. Please add sentence-ending period.. I'd remove \"possibly\" because we are ignoring them (whether or not they're present).. Performance: Each time we compare 2 phone numbers which have extensions, we'd hit this code where uncompiled regular expressions are used.\nI think we should go with:\nString firstSanitized = firstExtension.replace(',', '').replace(';', '');. The Javadoc above should mention what happens with differences in control-characters (comma & semicolon) in the extensions.\nBefore addressing this, let's figure out the semantics. For that, please see my comment on testIsNumberMatchMatches.. Please exercise the allowed pattern a bit more.\n(both allowed and disallowed)\n\ntest which shows what happens where there's a trailing comma or semicolon.\nmultiple control characters in a row (but not at the end)\nextension starting with a control character\n\"92-3\" and \"91.0\" i.e. what happens if it's another punctuation character appears in the extension. SHORT_NSN_MATCH doesn't seem quite right, but maybe it is the best here.\n\nWe could return EXACT_MATCH if we specify that such differences are ignored. But most users of EXACT_MATCH may depend on exact equivalence of the PhoneNumber object / formatted result.\nIt's not worth introducing a new enum value for differences in the commands in the extension.\nAnother alternative would be if the parse(...) method drops the command characters. I.e. the extension as stored in the resulting PhoneNumber object would never include command characters.\n\n\nWhat do you think of that option? I probably haven't thought this through.\n\n\nSHORT_NSN_MATCH seems reasonable. What do you think?. Optional: Maybe drop \"GitHub\". Please revert the change on this line. Github uses a Java class, not a proto.. The list is sorted alphabetically. Please add your name after Alexandru / before Andr\u00e1s.\n\n\nThanks.. Inconsistent indentation. Your change makes this private function public. This doesn't look like it should be part of the public API surface of PhoneNumberUtil though (same for the new matchesPrefix method).\nCan we make this \"@Package\" private?. 1. Please don't change / touch more lines than needed. (no need to revert changes like line 452 now though since I started the review already)\n2. Please don't change a perfectly good comment. We want trailing periods (sentences), please don't remove them (line 455).. Mixing shortnumber metadata and standard metadata in the same .xml file is probably not a good idea. We never do that in prod metadata and I'm not aware of a precedent in tests. I think it'd lead to confusion and might break later on if assumptions change.\nProbably best to have another file for ShortNumberMetadataForGoldenTests.xml and expected_shortnumbermetadata.js. This should be \"@package\" private, no?. Indentation of comments is of\n   * \ninstead of\n  * \nfor the following method too.. Please copy the comment from the .java version.. Still to do.. Why make INPUT_FILE_NAME a constant but not expected_shortnumbermetadata.js? I'd make that a constant too.\nE.g.\nGOLDEN_INPUT_FILE_NAME\nGOLDEN_OUTPUT_FILE_NAME. Please include 2 lines as suggested.\nMissing the first line:\nCode changes:\n(we group changes e.g. into Code changes and Build changes, for this change here we just highlight the former). BTW: It looks like shortnumberinfo_test.js is not in any test target yet.\nI think we need to add it to . Let's move this right above the method and make it a constant:\nprivate static NEW_ISSUE_URL = .... Indentation. ",
    "lararennie": "Superseded by https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1459. @vbauer:\nFor the specific use-cases that you mention:\n1) Get all country codes (CountryCodeToRegionCodeMap.getCountryCodeToRegionCodeMap().keySet() -- what do you use this for? We could theoretically provide a method e.g. getValidCountryCallingCodes() to return a set of all the valid ones if there's a need for this? This would include global network calling codes e.g. +800 -> would you want that or not?\n2) Get region codes by country code (I think we can do it via PhoneNumberUtils#getRegionCodesForCountryCode, so it would be ok, but we can minimize memory usage a little bit, if we use CountryCodeToRegionCodeMap directly without PhoneNumberUtils). -- Do you do something other than just parse the number? Is that why you need this? Maybe an image of your widget would help here?\n3) Retrieve CountryCodeToRegionCodeMap.getCountryCodeToRegionCodeMap() and send this information from server-side to client side (via GWT RPC). It is necessary for our UI components. -- What do you do with this?\nGiven the current API, what we'd expect users to do is call getSupportedRegions (and optionally getSupportedGlobalNetworkCallingCodes as well), and then use this to build a custom map of the data they want, keyed off whatever they want. (E.g. you could imagine building a map of calling code to a \"country\" object that contains an image link to a flag and the name(s) of the countries to show on hover). Does this not work for your use-case? I wouldn't think the region-codes themselves are something you want to show to users directly in your UI.\n. Thanks so much for your contribution!!\n.

In general happy with the idea, although we don't commit to having this always working if it becomes to difficult in future.\n\nHow have you tested this?\n. I think dropping geocoding for now is sensible. Best to have something that works for the average use-case.\n. Thanks for this! I won't merge today because we might be doing a new release that we want to only have one change in it; if we don't do that, I'll merge; or if we do, I'll merge this after that happens (sometime next week).\n. 8 commits to try and break them up: they don't touch the same files with the exception of the proto file where I fixed a comment, so you can review them independently if you like.\nI checked in generated files because otherwise our next release won't say what files have actually had metadata changes; it'll look like all of them have. The ones that actually changed due to previous possible length errors I have mentioned in the pending code changes so they can be merged at that time.\n. Sounds good to squash, as long as people can still see the code changes (it won't allow me to diff this commit as a whole properly because there are too many files, but there must be a way to override this.)\n. They did change, and so did Phonemetadata.java. Where are you looking? it says it won't display all the 529 files in the list because it's too many.

Checked, worked for me :)\n. One issue we have is that # is frequently written in phone numbers not for dialling, but to indicate an extension suffix, e.g. 1-800 543-1234#677 -> doesn't mean dial the#, it means 677 is an extension. Or there is the variant with that at the end. Also people provide phone numbers like \"PH#886-2-25450000\" and this # is also not for dialling, it is just saying \"number\".

Interesting stuff :)\nSo, we're checking above \"if (metadata != null)\"; we only proceed with loading if metadata isn't already in the map.\nSo by the time we get to the last line in this method, if oldValue isn't null then we had at least 2 threads go through the loading, and one thread \"won\" and their loaded object is in the map. The reasons we return that object rather than the one this thread loaded are:\n(1) We want to honor the \"load that won\"\n(2) Idiomatically, we want getMultiFileMetadata to return the same object to anyone who passes in the same key and map, not just \"objects that are equal\"; and indeed, an object that's in the map\n(3) We want the object/s that didn't get into the map to be promptly garbage collected.\nFWIW: What I said earlier about possibly returning to the thread early due to the return value already being computed does not apply here, but might with double locking IUUC.

Re CLA: I personally don't know why the CLA makes you think this, but I am not a lawyer, so I will see if I can find someone to ask.. I haven't had any response from them yet, so I don't even have a contact :/. Right, they say:\n\"Please confirm that the ordinary Apache 2 license header should be used, and that the header proposed by the contributor is not required or requested under the terms of our CLA. \"\nI am asking them if there is a contact address I can give you to pass on to your legal team.. Sorting off?\n. What's the life of this servlet? once per request?\n. Do we want to do this every time, or only if it isn't a valid number at all? Will we/should we have numbers that are both? Too much output can be confusing. You could instead of this just above have a bit where if it's invalid, put this possible/valid short number info.\n. I would put code changes and \"backwards incompatible code changes\" beside each other. (Also: next time we should make this v8.0 if there are such changes.)\n. By prefix, do you mean national destination code (or \"area code\" for geographical numbers)?\nMaybe a better title would be \"There is only one sequence of digits that reaches a single end-point\"? Although that isn't so readable by normal people. Maybe: \"There is only one area code or national destination code for a given phone number at a given time\"? Or \"Phone numbers have only one area code or national destination code at a given time\"?\n. I'd start off saying \"It is common during transition periods for countries to support both old and new ways of dialling a phone number.\" And then you can add the Iceland example.\n. Do we have any concrete tips on what this means for programmers - i.e. what they should/shouldn't do because of this?\n. I think it is actually fair it gives you some idea. If they have an American phone number, statistically speaking, it's more likely that they are in the US than somewhere else, and that they speak English.\nI get your point though that it shouldn't be assumed that it is accurate.\nWould you be happier with this more definite sentence instead: \"The country or area code of a phone number indicates the user's location, time-zone or preferred language.\"\nWe could also add \"place of residence\" to the list.\n. Remove And.\nAlso add a point that there are many people who choose to have a mobile phone number that is registered to another country, e.g. people in Liechtenstein may have a Swiss mobile number, if many of their contacts are in Switzerland.\n(It's not just travellers.)\n. We try and make concrete suggestions where we can for what programmers should do because of this, so a tip we could say here is that programmers should therefore make sure not to disallow users from signing up with a phone number from another country, and should be very careful when using methods like isValidNumberForRegion.\n. I'm not sure how I understand how this assumption could cause programmers to make mistakes: what could they be doing wrong if they wrongly assume this?\n. Perhaps also worth mentioning that in some countries, not only fixed-line phones can be associated with geographical area codes. For users outside the Americas, this can be surprising that they are at all issued that way.\n. I think this is a good point, and a good thing to start with. We should probably though make the \"An individual has only one phone number\" come straight after it, and move the \"Phone numbers that are valid today\" one down to after \"Phone numbers cannot be re-used\".\nIf you would like to do the reordering, feel free to do so and upload another patch, otherwise we'll do a separate PR with this new falsehood and the reordering in it.\n. home -> fixed-line\nWe should separate the info from the \"tip\" part, like we did above with \"Each country has only one country calling code\".\n. s/texts/text\n. We should probably add the corollary: that \"Only mobile phones can receive text messages\" which is also not true.\n. Maybe \"Replace XXX in the commands below with the appropriate version number:\"\n. This is a good one! Maybe we should order it after \"To make a number dialable, you only need to change the prefix\" since it's also about dialling prefixes?\nAlso, perhaps substitute \"domestic numbers\" with \"numbers formatted for domestic usage\" and change \"The leading zero\" to \"A leading zero\" since there may not be one?\n. a) missing a trailing bracket\nb) optional: could mention that Italy had a plan to change this, but it hasn't eventuated.\nc) could add a \"Tip\" that people should use the library's parse and format numbers to handle this correctly.\n. If you can just fix the alignment here and remove the extra spaces after \"calling\" we can just merge this in directly. Thanks!\n. Ah I see, so the actual prefix changed. Can you add this example into the text?\n. Okay, so we could add something like:\nTip: During transition periods, make sure that both forms of a number are supported for look-up by phone number. If sending messages/dialling affected numbers, both the new and old prefix may need to be tried. Depending on the type of transition, you may need to contact affected customers and ask them to update their number. \n. hypens -> hyphens.\n. I think we need a specific example here to make it clear that it wasn't just a new digit in front (comments on that PR).\n. Should we wrap them like you did the other titles, or have too-long titles? Have forgotten if both \"work\" but we should be consistent. I feel like line-length was ignored for titles because they don't always work otherwise?\n. Well, it is optional. You can replace it with the IDD. I don't think that this answer is adequate.\n. The area code bit makes it sound like you can at least work out which country they are in. I would say \"There are many reasons for someone to have a phone number issued by a state or region other than where they reside or hold citizenship.\nThese reasons include, but are not limited to:\n- Moving within a country. In countries with phone number portability you may retain your number when moving, even if it is a fixed-line number and even if it has an area code. (example bla)\n- Moving to another country. In this case you probably can't keep a fixed-line, but you could keep your mobile phone.\n- Having many customers from a neighbouring country.\n- Wanting cheaper calling rates. (e.g. voip, people travelling around Europe)\n- etc etc \nNote that geographical area codes are assigned in some countries to mobile phones.\n. I like the tip :)\n. Another tip: Make sure you allow numbers to be entered in international format if you have a widget (e.g. allow the + sign) so people can sign up with an international contact number.\n. even if it is a fixed-line number -> even in some cases if ....\n. can you give an example of what it would look like with the + or with the IDD\n. Maybe: phone numbers -> phone numbers in international format?\n. 55 (pt) doesn't seem to be new? 1548 and 1743 aren't country calling codes, so drop them from here.\nChange it to 55 (en, pt) below and add 1 (en).\n. No, but it's not about the binary file, it's about the text file, and that\nwas already there (not new). It just didn't generate the binary file before\nbecause they were identical.\nI think with the 1xxx we have oscillated back and forth.\n2016-05-04 14:20 GMT+02:00 Keghani Kouzoujian notifications@github.com:\n\nIn java/release_notes.txt\nhttps://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1102#discussion_r62028953\n:\n\n@@ -1,3 +1,14 @@\n+May 03, 2016: libphonenumber-7.3.2\n+Metadata changes:\n- - Updated phone metadata for region code(s):\n-   AU, BR, ET, IN, KH, ML, NO, SB, TJ, US\n- - Updated short number metadata for region code(s): CA, ML, US\n- - New geocoding data for country calling code(s):\n\n@lararennie https://github.com/lararennie Can we change this back to\nwhat was automatically generated?\n55_pt was actually new this time (it was removed in a recent release):\nhttps://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/commits/master/java/geocoder/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/geocoding/data/55_pt\nAnd we've always included the entire 1xxx numbers according to the file\nnames - see libphonenumber-7.1.1 release notes for example.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1102/files/a3691f42228b7603a4014c392a95ecb0b7f452ba#r62028953\n. Thanks!\n\na) We need the file to have a copyright header, like all the other geocoding files in this directory\nb) What about a Spanish variant, since that is the local language? Although we can add this ourselves if you don't have familiarity with Mexico/are busy.\nc) +5255 should be in the middle, the file isn't ordered by prefix length, but numerically, so it should go after line 311.\nd) Where does this data come from? This needs to be in the header too.\n. Not just La Paz?\n. (durango) seems a bit unnecessary, we prefer shorter names if possible\n. same here. In general, can we remove all the info in brackets?\n. (same for all the names with a comma in them: I think it'll look much better to the user if they see a number being reported in \"La Placename\" rather than \"Placename, La\". Same for El etc.)\n. This was Mexico City in your older version?\n. Xalapa-Enriquez?\n. It should be clear whether the \"en\" or \"es\" file is the \"master\" one, and which one is a copy of the other with some translation changes.\nAlso where the translations come from.\n. s/For/To\n. So it seems there are four cities in the ITU doc. There are a couple of ways of dealing with this:\na) List all of them:\n52274|Vicente Camalote/Tierra Blanca/Temascal/Acatlan de Perez Figueroa, OAX\nDownside: we end up with some pretty long descriptions.\nb) Go into more detail: if possible. E.g. 522741 maybe is Tierra Blanca only. But this info isn't in the ITU doc. Maybe it's the other website, I don't know?\nc) Something like Tierra Blanca Region, OAX to indicate that this is that town and a couple of towns nearby.\nWe get bugs reported if we say \"Place A\" and it's actually \"Place B\" nearby...\nI imagine, looking at the ITU doc, that this applies to more than a few places.\n. Ok, seems it would be \n52274|Vicente Camalote OAX/Tierra Blanca VER/Temascal OAX/Acatlan de Perez Figueroa, OAX\nWhich is even worse...\n. What is \"Clave inegi\" in their table?\n. I think more detail is probably possible from their numbering plan. If we can go an extra digit (or two if need be) this would be great.\n. I think you need the state codes (JAL etc) since some of these places are pretty small and exist in multiple states e.g. Allende (NL and COAH).\n. Title-casing is I presume done automatically by you? I think we need a search-replace to fix \"De\" and \"La\" to  \"de\" and \"la\" where they aren't at the start of a name, to make it look more user-friendly.\n. Yes, the jars need to be regenerated.\nThis class: no idea why there is a change. This happened because I ran mvn clean and mvn build.... nothing to do with my cl, but maybe to do with the protoc version I have on my computer.\n. I am surprised that these depend on PhoneNumberUtil at all; it's a bit of a circular dependency, is it not? However I believe you - I remember having problems with this in the past. We should look at removing it...\nQuestion though: do we want to update pending_code_changes.txt when we update these jars? they aren't really part of the project, they are just a tool to build the metadata. I don't think anyone is using these (or any other) methods through these jars: and indeed they shouldn't be..!\n. not 2013, but 2016?\n. Where did the translations come from? We have an en file which comes from here, but the Chinese names of the carriers presumably come from somewhere else?\n. Same here: need a comment about where the translations come from, rather than this note about 86170 which is more relevant in the source file (in this case en)\n. One wikipedia page?\nJust say something like this:\nTranslations of en/852.txt from  and in some cases the\ncarrier's own home page.\n2016-06-30 9:38 GMT+02:00 Felix Yan notifications@github.com:\n\nIn resources/carrier/zh_CN/852.txt\nhttps://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1181#discussion_r69084905\n:\n\n@@ -0,0 +1,282 @@\n+# Copyright (C) 2013 The Libphonenumber Authors\n+\n+# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n+# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n+# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n+\n+# http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n+\n+# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n+# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n+# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n+# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n+# limitations under the License.\n+\n+# Prefixes from http://www.ofca.gov.hk/mobile/en/industry_focus/telecommunications/portability/numbering/index.html\n\nMost of the translations came from Wikipedia, and a few others are from\ntheir own homepage.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1181/files/e64c1cfad1b8d757ad0ff422b477dec5bd63ab49#r69084905,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/AIjis4ldQvQInb9EArOVi8x8uFVeb91Sks5qQ3JbgaJpZM4JA2sK\n.\n. Yes, I think the URL is fine, but the date should be changed.\n\nDo we not change any prefixes now based on the other site?\n. slightly risky to have this as a line number but I don't know a better way :)\n. Can you add a comment where these came from?\n. In the file, not here :)\n. The reason I ask is that we have Crnogorski Telekom in the ITU doc (https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/02/02/T02020000DA0002PDFE.pdf).\nThe other thing is we have Mtel in the ITU doc, not m:tel.\n. Thanks for the explanation! Can you add this comment as a reason why we aren't using ITU, plus the link to wikipedia as a comment at the top of the file?\n. So it seems source is only closed if there is an IOException? Should it not be closed in a finally block?\n. Add a comment about why this should never happen (that we only load things based on the expectation that they are present, by checking the map of available data first).\n. PhoneNumberMatcher? I am confused that the PhoneNumberMatcher class has the short number metadata at all?\n. You could define it at class level as a private final int constant.\nAlso do you know why it is this size, 16 *1024?\n. same here re making it a constant\n. How do you mean the size of the metadata? what does the 16 represent, what does the 1024 represent? Similarly below: why 256? It looks like a calculation but I'm confused what it is calculating.\n. I don't understand this comment. If they shouldn't be using it, why is the code here?\n. why do we only close source() if ois != null? don't we promise always to do it?\n. Just wondering: would these be better as full-width ASCII digits instead of normal? Same with the slash on the line below: if you are keeping a normal slash, we would usually tend not to have white-space around it. However we could have a full-width slash instead to give more space?\n. There are some recent changes to the en file, https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1260 - can you add them too? Thanks!\n. Yes, technically I meant Unicode FW digits, not ASCII. I meant, for the ASCII 1-9 digits.\nOn smart-phones, where this might be used, I expect the font issues to be resolved, but I don't feel strongly about this.\n. Re the slash: I think the full-width one looks better than white-space, slash, white-space, but I'm happy to just replace it with a normal slash.\n. Technically the file should be sorted: this was an error in the English one. I'm fixing that, so I'm happy to fix yours at the same time: or you can fix the 86.txt files now if you feel like it.\n. Done :)\n. No, because they have to be public now so the geocoder can use them. If the geocoder didn't exist they could be private.\n. Yes and yes done :)\n. Think I've done this :)\n. Good catch...!\n. Now that 62X are all Cell C you can collapse these to 2762 -> but I can do that for you since this has taken a while to review. Thanks for your contribution!\n. Done\n. Done\n. I tried to, but they sadly didn't quite work: they added some extra protoc comments that I removed, put it in the wrong dir, and didn't have \"nano\" in the output path; so I did some manual editing based on the currently-checked in file and moved it into the right dir. I tried first playing with the command but the docs are hopeless so gave up.\n. Merge them together. I just put them here because as Keghani said we don't have a place to put them, and I didn't think the script would automatically notice them since I actually updated all the files with my proto change. You can do it just here editing it in the UI if you want to, or you can manually edit in your client and then do git commit java/release_notes.txt and then git push.\n.

This is autogenerated. I don't know how it decides to line-break.\n. This excludes the PhoneNumberToTimeZonesMapper: is this intentional?\n. We only have resource files in the data folder; same above - is this intended to cover them? but they don't have a \"package\" per se?\n. What do these lines do?\n. I wouldn't say necessarily \"add needed functionality\" because that doesn't solve the problem of it potentially getting out of sync.. Also depending on a maven release might be fine if we specified the version and said the C++ one had to be the same. I would state the problem and leave it open in the TODO how we are going to solve it.\n. Comment here why the cpp-build is missing from this?\n. Yes, if it works :)\n. can we change this back to alternateFormatData? same below for shortNumberMetadata; alternatively, make sure you make the same changes in our copy.\n. indentation looks 2 too far?\n. class file -> source file? maybe say \"how\" it was compiled?\n. do we want to update the copyright? : D \n. so most methods in this file are Size, not Count: which do we want to do? which is the more \"modern\" way?\n. Yes, if the generated file has Count then we should probably at some point switch them all over :)\n. I guess we can say it's the same copyright year, since we are resurrecting an old file. Maybe say in the commit which file it is based off.\n. Sure a separate commit. But probably worth changing.\n. I mean the Phonemetadata.java file that was there before we deleted it for nano.\n. To reduce diffs with auto-generated js file. This file is the same as what protoc would generate now, just checked in.\n. I just copied from the generated file :) I think it's to make it less verbose at line 2192, it's just doing an alias.\n. The method removal is for porters, to prompt them to do the same. The style fixes are in case they see tons of stuff changed and want to check it doesn't affect them :)\n. Done\n. would load -> loads?\n. Possible alternative titles:\n\"Phone numbers can be stored as numeric data types\"\n\"Phone numbers can be treated as normal numbers\"\n\nPositioning:\nI would put this after the \"Users will only store phone numbers\" one, since it is related in that if a user isn't storing a phone number then you really shouldn't treat it like a number.\n. nit: in -> as?\n(also, ints are too small :) but we probably don't want to get into that.)\n. The last sentence should link to the falsehood we already have - A leading zero in numbers formatted for domestic usage can always be discarded when dialing from abroad\nAlso you should say \"Moreover, a phone number may contain other diallable characters (see Phone numbers contain only digits) or an extension portion, dialled after waiting for a tone.\nWithout these points, I think people could think that storing the number in E164 format would work, since no phone number country calling code starts with a 0, and the + can be assumed.\n. We could also have the same tip here as line 173.\n. I wish we could link easily to other parts of the doc; not sure how to do this though, so instead we could put the bit to see in italics just to make it read a bit better.\n. I see your point too, so ... okay :)\n. I would do x.y.z because it's like a metadata change: no one can or should change code because of it.\n. Changed all places (I think)\n. The other one isn't really needed, since it's actually a hyperlink (the xkcd one); but I don't care so to end the back and forth I will just accept this :)\n. This should be the same as the C++ test, where you added a 1 in front of the a as well in the inputNumber.\n. Would be good to add what this affects, e.g. \"numbers with # in them will no longer have formatting applied in formatInOriginalFormat, and normalizeDiallableCharsOnly now retains the # symbol.\n. This file is actually not part of the change, it was here in error.. Can you add a link to the wikipedia URL here?. Can you make this just 9054? It seems wikipedia and your other source agree that all the 54 numbers are vodafone.. What about these prefixes? Should we not add them too?\nKKTC Telsim 54285, 54286, 54287, 54288\nKuzey K\u0131br\u0131s Turkcell   53383, 53384, 53385, 53386, 53387. Seems the name is T\u00fcrk Telekom, both on the wikipedia page and on their own website.\nEven the English page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BCrk_Telekom. I think 9050|Turk Telekom is fine; there are no other competing prefixes, and we already validate numbers beginning with e.g. 504 as mobile, so they would otherwise be omitted.\nSame below for: 9055|Turk Telekom\nThe wikipedia page says also somewhere else that 50x and 55x will be Turk Telekom.. Sure. We are a bit inconsistent since we don't do it in the next method in Java either (convertAlphaCharactersInNumber) but oh well.. I really feel we should move this file up a level since it looks like it only applies to Java changes and that's how I use it, but it would be more useful if we also mentioned JS etc..... Fixed line length to make lint happy while here.. Can you use a new sentence for this? it gets a bit hard to read. I'd do it after the bullet points as \"N.B. Use an email address associated with the GitHub username you used to filed the corresponding issue\" (but still in bold).. Should we mention something about who the core libphonenumber team is, i.e. that it is restricted to Google employees?\n. We only have them in comments, because we made it explicitly not break, so I would say \"your compilation will have warnings when ....\"\nFrom what I remember, we also made the comments the // kind -> / style risks breakage because you need the / to be correctly detected.\nUnless there are files elsewhere where it matters, e.g. in the geocoding source code which was contributed so I don't know so well, or we changed policy at some point?. No, because it is the user's region code: if you don't know, you could do ZZ.. This is because you can't pass in a proper language tag, so it's actually the breaking up of a BCP 47 language tag, which does use the ISO codes for region, not CLDR. In practice we use it only for zh-TW vs zh-CN.. Same. You wouldn't, as a user, provide 001: you'd use the appropriate method to get info for non-geographical entities (maybe there is an exception but I can't think of it). Nope, minus REGION_CODE_FOR_NON_GEO_ENTITY. \nI guess in the NANPA one it could be, we will just say \"no\" as we would if you passed in \"lara\" or \"null\" :). Actually it auto-completes to the latest it seems. updated.. Optional: should we say if you want the geocoder or carrier jar, that you also need the prefixmapper jar?. Add \"inside the top-level  element\" perhaps.. Weirdly, it also finds the other xml files because they also have a p, an o and an m in the title :) Guess it doesn't matter.. I meant the top-level element called \"version\" because there are many \"version\" elements in the file.. Indeed, it works, even though the visibility issues haven't been resolved. If it stops working, I also know how to fix it - by moving the flags that care about visibility into the demo rule only, not the test rule.. Actually, I guess we still need to ask the type of the number.. annoucement -> announcement. Google -> Google's. Done. This last part isn't true: because I don't think (at least anymore) that you have cases where ABCDEF is assigned to fixed-line and 9 ABCDEF is assigned to mobile. It's just that it doesn't work without the additional digits.... Moreoever -> moreover. We need to go into more detail here I think. Add an extra sentence? We should say \"For instance, since SMS messages can be sent in Argentina from a mobile phone without a prefix, the user may not supply the mobile prefix.\" And also cover the fact that \"Our metadata is currently not fine-grained enough to detect when a user has omitted the mobile prefix, so we rely on a mobile prefix being present to correctly identify the type of phone number.\"\nThis part is the most important thing, and should go at the start.. Hmm, we don't aim to anonymize them. And it's not about our tests, it's about the example number we have in the API, no?\nWhy not:\n\"We supply example numbers as part of the library API. While we aim to have numbers that are either explicitly allocated by the country as a test number, or look fictitious (e.g. 1234567) we also need these numbers to validate correctly. This means we sometimes have numbers that do connect to a real person. If we by chance have .....\". except -> accept. We should mention that the timezone returned is the canonical ID from CLDR (and link to CLDR), not a localised name (or any other identifier) - and then below in the \"contributing\" part we can mention that IDs in CLDR don't change (or whatever Mark said that time we raised the bug).. Maybe instead: How to implement support?. TYPE_MOBILE -> MOBILE as well. Indentation off in line 41 and 41.. It is unfortunate (I now notice) that we use regexp elsewhere in our filenames and regex here.... anyway!! :). same here re indentation. None of these methods need to be on the class? they can be just in the anonymous namespace above.. 1671 -> 1. Fixed.. Not protos, objects. Changed the whole thing :). It is here, see the next line 3027. It is just here as a parameter comment, which we don't have in C++. Here at line 3991.. If we refer to master\n(https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/java/libphonenumber/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/PhoneNumberUtil.java)\nthen it'll always be up to date; on the other hand the line number will change...\nI think probably best to have the \"master\" not the specific version, and tell people to search for parse?. Sorry if I missed this before, but we don't do {@link} in C++;\nMethod names should have capital 'I' too. I'd mention \"short number info\" libraries, or mention the class or file.. You need to remove this \"internal statistics data\" line then, based on the conversation you're having, where you say it comes from ITU.. This tells me that it is the city Teotitl\u00e1n del Camino, which is in two states, OAX and PUE: I assume this is not intended? If it is in two states, just name both of them, in full.. It looks like you have a third case: where there are only two, you list both, and the state? or not?. This file is not in English. While it's fine to contribute the es file (and indeed that's great!) it has to be in the es folder, as es/52.txt.\nIdeally you'd do both es and en.. I think Pueblo/Oaxaca is the best you can do.\nAlternatively you could do Ajalpan/Calipan PUE, Cuicatlan/Huautla de Jimenez/Teotitlan del Camino OAX\nbut it's not concise.\nThird option: list the municipalities only, not the poblacion; e.g. Calipan is in Coxcatlan.\nFourth option: use the Mexican detailed information and add more prefixes:\nhttps://sns.ift.org.mx:8081/sns-frontend/planes-numeracion/descarga-publica.xhtml\nBut I don't know what the \"serie\" column is, not sure if you can just do NIR + first digit of numeracion inicial, NIR + first digit of numeracion final, and all in between....\nAnyway it has more detailed data, but requires more processing. We do have something that could help compress it afterwards: http://libphonenumber-combine-geodata.appspot.com/ - but it can be a bit overaggressive.. This is a List, which was introduced in Java 1.2, at which time isEmpty was already there?\nthe isEmpty on string was indeed introduced in Java 1.6, so that we should avoid.\nWas this an accidental \"fix\"? I notice PhoneNumberUtil uses isEmpty on lists, and that isn't listed here?. This is the demo, which requires appengine, and I don't think you can run that without using java 7 anyway?. same as previous comment. and here. We changed this already at head to compare to empty string.. For consistency, we could change this to check it's not the empty string, like we did for the region code comparison. Or otherwise, change it there to the length check.. Okay with the change, but in that case, you need to remove line 144 since it's not used anymore.. same qn here and below about lists. Happy for more detail, but:\n- KB not KiloBytes\n- wrap at 80 chars\n- what does \"genuine\" or \"all-in-one\" mean here? Does this add anything? I as a user am more confused now than before.. This issue still hasn't been solved, no?. What kinds of API changes? I'm not sure we want to.. Should we require them to file a separate issue too?. an issue \"instead\". Or for an API change, they could email the discussion list.. I would prefer an explicit mapping here, because your project may have a shorter lifetime than this one, who knows :) it's not so big?\nAlso if someone else contributes at any point, they may want to add a mapping.. and don't forget trailing full stop. 95?!\nI guess we should still do it, they are only comments and will be stripped when built anyway, and it's good to verify them in one place.. you don't mention the project now. Also I think it's fair to still reference your project in the way you did at line 18.. Yep I agree I think JT is better.. remove extra blank line :). I guess the Java demo is relevant to anyone who wants to contribute eg a PR for geocoding and test it's working, or if they want to test behaviour at a particular version. Not just porters. Maybe for porters and contributors?. UAN, pager, voicemail too now. Guessing -> guesses. Remove \"input\". \"periodically\" sounds not very often. Do you just want to say after every release?. Is generated -> was originally generated. Maybe we should just remove offline in the title. Our whole lib is offline.. To original carriers? Maybe a caveat on portability is worthwhile. Validation: metadata? Or validation or formatting?. This comment about sources we should move to the contribution guidelines for PRs?. Grammarly.com backs me up here :)\n\"Many people wonder whether to use a space before and after slashes in a sentence. The answer is typically no on both fronts. Spaces before slashes should be avoided. \"\nSlashes can be followed by space if it is to break up several short-lines in a poem etc.. Hi,\nWe need this issue to be solved before we can accept this.\nIt would also be much easier to review if you don't squash your commits each time: at the moment, there is only one commit, there should be about 20. Then we can see the diffs, and restrict our review to them. We will squash on merge at the end, don't worry!. #unsupported_region would be better I think.. can't for C++, there is a comment on the method why it has to even live in another class in C++.. This is metadata \"for testing\", so I changed it so the unit tests pass. yep fixed.. Done (was a tab somehow). ",

Regarding item 3, it's more of a note instead of a question.\nI'll make the changes, and update shortly (might be tomorrow).\nAs for the compression, do you have a link to that online tool? I'm slightly concerned that I compressed too hard. I sanity checked some ranges by hand, and they appear okay.. Updated Hutchison to Three and added a comment about how the data was generated.\nI've also rebased to upstream's master.\n. Last comments addressed.. Updated with latest Ofcom data. You've tagged v8.9.0 with changes from this branch, but they don't actually contain the metadata changes that are in master.. You've tagged v8.9.0 with changes from this branch, but they don't actually contain the metadata changes that are in master.. @hagbard That's fair enough.\nThe data itself comes from a machine readable format supplied by Ofcom (spreadsheet). I just have some basic PHP that converts it into the format for the metadata files, and deals with renaming companies & compressing the data.\nThe data in the merge request is compressed as far as it can safely go based on the current Ofcom allocations.\nIn your example of Core Communications, the shortened 447744 shouldn't be used, as Core Communications have only been allocated 2-9 (not 0 or 1).\nIn @penmetsaa's example above, Three has been compressed, because they have been allocated all the other ranges apart from the others specified.\n\n44742|Three\n447420|Orange\n447421|Orange\n447422|Orange\n447423|Vodafone\n447424|Lycamobile\n447425|Vodafone\n. > The 0/1 ranges just aren't valid so we don't care what we return for them.\n\nThey validate as valid numbers though: http://libphonenumber.appspot.com/phonenumberparser?number=%2B447744012345.\nThis would be fine, but would require the metadata to be much more accurate than it is now (actual allocated numbers instead of possibly allocated numbers).\nAccording to Ofcom they try to publish data every Wednesday. Carrier Updates certainly aren't that important to be updated so frequently, but if the metadata is being mixed with the compression mentioned above, then that's sure to cause problems.\nKeeping with this same number range as an example 77440 is currently not allocated, and currently does not report a carrier. It does however validate as a valid number. If the carrier data was compressed to just '7744': Carrier, and another CP was allocated 77440, then incorrect carrier information would start being shown.\nMy gmail address is the same as my GitHub username.. > The 0/1 ranges just aren't valid so we don't care what we return for them.\nThey validate as valid numbers though: http://libphonenumber.appspot.com/phonenumberparser?number=%2B447744012345.\nThis would be fine, but would require the metadata to be much more accurate than it is now (actual allocated numbers instead of possibly allocated numbers).\nAccording to Ofcom they try to publish data every Wednesday.

Hi,\nThanks for providing all the details we need!\nWe've need some more time for concluding requirement and possible solution. Please be advised that validation updates are top priority and considering our backlog we may take a while to get to this.. Hi,\nWe can not accept non-Latin-script characters as preferredExtnPrefix as it may not work well for all global users and the library does not support language-specific formatting at this point. Libphonenumber uses this value for all formattings of the phone number. See our demo results.\nPlease refer this FAQ to check our policy for formatting changes.\nAs we are presently not able to parse this character sequence (, \u0434\u043e\u0431.) as extension and considering input as NOT_A_NUMBER. We will add support to this extension so that we parse the phone number and extension correctly, similar to above demo result.

Closing this PR as it includes bad formatting changes for KZ region.. This is older one.. Sure. I made same update in #2322.\nThanks so much for your contribution.. This is failing because GPG key signature verification failed. May be because SSH keys are not configured in the new dev machine. I will check on this further, could you please approve this PR(?) i.e to check whether we can merge it for time being. Anyway all the relevant tests are passing which are run through release scripts.. Anyway we do not want to merge it until we fix the issue i.e we will mostly send a new PR because we can not update these things in already created PR.. Oh ok. Anyway we can not merge this PR because it needs all check to run successfully. We will close this PR and create new one. Thanks :). Closing the PR as it looks like temporarily only travis is not able to verify the public key.\nIt is able to verify now :)\nhttps://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/2328. Closing the PR as it looks like temporarily only travis is not able to verify the public key.\nIt is able to verify now :)\nhttps://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/2328. Hi Keghani,\nDone with the change.\n. Thanks for pointing this out.\nDone in new commit.\nhttps://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1204/commits/e5920a415c9dbdb1ab42c1ef9a6ae2f5583302da\n. Done Lara. PTAL\n. Done Keghani.. Hi Andy,\nWe already have b/29441689 to fix this.\nPlease let me know if this is OK.. A comment about the rebranding would be good here.\nE.g. \"Ooredoo used to be known as Nedjma.\" \nPlease add it before this line and add line break after that.. We do accept only the mobile ranges in carrier file. 700 and 800 ranges belong to Alpha Technologies. As per information in http://www.alphatechnologieslimited.com/, this is not a mobile carrier.. Please take a loot at first comment. 700 is supported as UAN and 800 is supported as toll-free. If you think that these are mobile ranges, please raise an issue and share any official evidence you may have. See our guidelines.. As complete 704 range is assigned to Visafone as per ITU doc. https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/02/02/T020200009C0001PDFE.pdf, we need not to be elaborative when mentioning carrier.. @ifiok,\nTrue. However the link of NCC website in ITU is broken. We found that in few cases NCC webpage is incomplete. Ex: 707 are mentioned as \"For Withdrawal\", we found working numbers at: https://www.naijatechguide.com/2008/10/reltel-rebrands-to-zoom-mobile-launches.html \nSo we do support ranges case by case.. Oh Sorry. My bad. Reverted this change now. PTAL.. It looks like all 9981 are assigned to Shatel as per Wikipedia. Their official page says whole 998 is assigned to them. So could you please change this to \"98998|Shatel Mobile\"?http://www.shatel.ir/news/%D8%B3%DB%8C%D9%85%E2%80%8C%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C%E2%80%8C-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%B4%E2%80%8C%D8%B4/. Range is 9990 as per Wikipedia. In their logo the brand is mentioned in caps. So could you please change this to \"989990|LOTUSTEL\"?. Range is 9991 as per Wikipedia but this will overlap with below range 99914. Please provide any supporting evidence with right range details here.. In their logo, the brand is mentioned with only starting letter in caps. So could you please change this to 9899914|Azartel. Please remove + sign for all new entries. It is not needed as per parsing done by the library.. Please remove (Full MVNO) and (Light MVNO) texts as only carrier name needed to be mentioned here. Responded to https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/69520068. Please take a look.. And also similar changes need to be done in carrier file in Farsi. Could you please update this one as well?https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/master/resources/carrier/fa/98.txt. Yah true. Forgot about that. Thanks :). Thanks for all the details. 99810 sounds good in that case.. Thanks :). Thanks :). Going ahead with range details mentioned in ITU doc sounds good to me.. Thanks :). Please move this one line above so that it is in right order (i.e above \"9899999|SamanTel\"). Please move this one line above so that it is in right order (i.e above \"9899810|Shatel Mobile\"). Please move this one line above so that it is in right order (i.e above \"9899810\" entry). Please move this one line above so that it is in right order (i.e above \"9899999\" entry). Isn't it Anarestan? http://www.anarestan.com/en/about/\nhttps://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C_%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%81%D9%86_%D8%AF%D8%B1_%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86#.D9.84.D9.88.D8.AA.D9.88.D8.B3.E2.80.8C.D8.AA.D9.84_LOTUSTEL\nPlease change if you agree on this.. Thanks for providing the details. \nAs you confirmed it is Anarestan, not Ansarestan (which is mentioned in the file). Can you please update this so that I can provide the final approval?. Could you please remove all these comments and just place below ones. The other ones are not needed.\n# Source: https://e-agencija.aek.mk/aek-crm-portal/Pages/Public/PublicFreeSeries/PublicFreeSeries\n# Mapped ranges at 3-4 digit granularity level for easier maintenance.. Thanks so much for sharing the official page: https://e-agencija.aek.mk/aek-crm-portal/Pages/Public/PublicFreeSeries/PublicFreeSeries\nAs the info is available, could you please increase detail (granularity) to one more digit here?\nSomething like:\n389702|T-Mobile\n389703|T-Mobile\n389704|T-Mobile\n389705|T-Mobile\n389706|T-Mobile\n389707|T-Mobile\n389708|T-Mobile\n389709|T-Mobile\nSame is the case for 38971 and 38972. Could you please increase the granularity here as well i.e to mention only 75[2-9].\n389753|Vip\n389754|Vip\n389755|Vip\n389756|Vip\n389757|Vip\n389758|Vip\n389759|Vip\nSame is the case for 38976 and 38978 ranges.. Expand this generic entry also as below. \n389772|Vip\n3897739|Vip\n389774|Vip\n389775|Vip\n389776|Vip\n389777|Vip\n389778|Vip\n389779|Vip\nNote: In 773 range only 7739 is assigned. So increasing granularity till 4 digit makes sense here.. Similarly, instead of generic this entry add one digit more detail here i.e add\n389792|Lycamobile\n389793|Lycamobile. As mentioned in above comment we can increase detail till 3 to 4 digits for easier maintenance. Not increasing details till 5 digits even-though the data is available in official source.. We do nota maintain all this info here. Could you please replace all these new lines with below line.\n```\nSource: https://www.hakom.hr/default.aspx?id=817\nbonbon is a virtual network operator. https://www.bonbon.hr/\n```\nThe actual carrier mapping updates looks good to me.. Timezone test data need not to be updated for all the new inclusions. So please revert changes to this file.. We already have TimeZone entry for Vatican City \"3906698|Europe/Vatican\"\nhttps://github.com/bigfoot90/libphonenumber/blob/a0a998eb7f18792de8a6ef9dec85da979e745cb5/resources/timezones/map_data.txt#L2921\nDemo result: http://libphonenumber.appspot.com/phonenumberparser?number=%2B39+06+698+12345.\nPlease revert changes to this file.\n. Geocoding test data need not to be updated for all the new inclusions. So please revert changes to this file.. Please move this entry one step below (i.e below entry \"3906|Rome\") so that it is in order.. Same case here. Please move this entry one step below so that it is in order.. Thanks so much for the info Mathias.\nThen this might be the reason why we are using only ASCII-safe characters in source code and not using them directly \u0434\u043e\u0431. Sounds good to me make the changes in the same patch. I can test it for you if needed.\nNote: I pulled these changes for testing. All tests passed.. Done. Thanks for catching this :). Looks like lifecell in Ukrainian is \u041b\u0430\u0439\u0444\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043b?\nhttps://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifecell\nIf this is good can we update all lifecell entries?. Similar case here. Is it \"\u041f\u0456\u043f\u043b\u041d\u0435\u0442\"?\nhttps://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEOPLEnet\n. Please change the year to 2018. What about this one?. ",

I edited this list by MS Notepad.\nAnd as result, notepad changed the Persian Yeh char with Arabic yeh char! This problem is one of problems in non standard applications which aren't compatible with Persian standard Unicode chars.\nAs result, github thinked i changed All of the lines!!! Because many lines contaning Persian.yeh char.\nI edited the 98.txt with github online editor and fixed that problem.\nNow if you look at Files changed section, you can understand what things are changed.\nChanges which I applied to file are:\nI only removed duplicate lines related to North Khorasan province. This changes also applied to English file by me. If you look at my pool request for Iran geocode, you will understand I removed only \"North Khorasan\" duplicate lines. \"North Khorasan\" is one of Iran's provinces(states) and have only one code, two lines and codes in 98.txt file are duplicate.\nThese changes are based on latest itu document(For more info look at my pool request Iran geocode)\n.

Hi @lararennie \nNow I sorted the list. I think it's ready to go.\n. Hi @lararennie \nIf you look at official latest itu doc for iran, then you will see there is not any 57 and 64 NDC. Now 57 and 64 haven't any usability. North Khorasan have only one NDC which is 58.\nUsing 57 and 64 was for migration process from old numbering plan to new numbering plan. You shouldn't accept any number with prefix 57 and 64. I think by https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1185 and https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/1155 (merged), now libphonenumber don't accept these prefixes.\n. Unfortunately, I don't know anything about how those sections(Like Line 12113 and 12114) working? Why I should change them? What is relation between those lines and acceptation of 57 and 64 NDCs? I couldn't find 57 or 64 in those lines! As result, please change them your self.\nBut Please describe the structure and meaning of codes between  tags line by line. This descriptions will help to me for better understanding and better contribution in feature.\n```\n\n       (?:\n\n\n         1[137]|\n\n\n         2[13-68]|\n\n\n         3[1458]|\n\n\n         4[145]|\n\n\n         5[146-8]|\n\n\n         6[146]|\n\n\n         7[1467]|\n\n\n         8[13467]\n\n\n       )\\d{8}\n\n\n     </nationalNumberPattern>\n\n```\nThanks.\n. @lararennie Thank you for your very good description about the meaning of codes between nationalNumberPattern tags. I understood the meaning of them completely!\nI Updated that file based on your request. As result I think now libphonenumber don't accept 57 and 64.\nPlease check changes and if it's ok, merge the changes.\n. I forgot to say IR-MCI also added 98991 also and i added it to list.\n. In Addition, you can see https://www.itu.int/oth/T0202000066/en and download latest version of itu document about numbering plan in iran. Direct link of it(Posted on 2017-11-14): https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/02/02/T02020000660007MSWE.docx\nIn additon, i added name of operator to this official document only and you can get it from \nIran(AddedOperaorsByMe)-2017-11-14.pdf\nWhy i added name of operators? As you knwo, unfortunately in itu documents, name of operators are not included.\n. If you want to remove prateses like (full MVNO) and (Light MVNO), please fix this isse in first step:\nhttps://issuetracker.google.com/issues/69520068. I'm sorry for typing...\nI corrected Ansarestan to Anarestan.\nThank for your exterme attention @penmetsaa \n. Can i help about that few minor updates @penmetsaa ?\nI remembering about there was a number formatting check file that we edited it when we added some numbers to carriers of Iran before now. If we should edit that file again for adding and supporting MVNOs and new mobile phone number prefixes? Is it few minor update that you mentoined?. > The bad news is that it appears that one or more commits were authored by someone other than the pull request submitter. We need to confirm that all authors are ok with their commits being contributed to this project.\nIt seems other than pull request submitter(Me) is you(@penmetsaa). Although i'm not sure. Because you're a verfied contributtor. Look at this screenshot and check commits tab again... The red cross sign is on your commit also, not mine.\n\n. I updated the branch. But it seems there is a problem yet, while main PR(Related to this PR) approved easily without problem.\n\ncla/google \u2014 CLAs are signed, but unable to verify author consent \n\nWhat is this message?. 2015-01-13 is for Mobile networks, not for fixed lines.\nPlease look at Page 2(It's for fixed lines) you will see 2008-Viii-28 which means 2008-08-28.\nGeocoding is based on fixed lines, not mobile networks!\nWhat is your opinion?\n. Yes. On ITU Doc is Nimroz! But my mother language is Perisan(Like Dari), and I know it should be Nimrooz or Nimruz. \nFor More info look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimruz_Province\nI think it should be Nimrooz or Nimruz.\nWhat is your opinion?\n. Please describe point of it. For example line x, after or before x\n. Please describe line of it. Number of line?\n. Please write number of line. For example, please say add balnk line above line xx\n. It's because if you look at Wikipedia page, really 9991(ApTel) and Azartel(99914) are two brands of one company(Named Negin Tel). Negin Tel gave 9991 from CRA(Regulatory) and divided it to two brands (Aptel=9991) and Azartel(99914). It means they forked Azartel (With 99914) from their Main brand(Aptel=9991).\nIf you look at numbering plan file(From ITU), you will not see 99914 while you can see it on Azartel website! It's because it's internal branding in Negin Tel. (Website: http://www.negintel.com/index.html)\nIt's because Azartel branding focused on only three provinces in Iran(East Azerbaijan Province, Azerbaijan Province and Ardabil Province).\nReally i should change it to like it:\n99911=ApTel\n99912=ApTel\n99913=ApTel\n99914=Azartel\n99915=ApTel\n99916=ApTel\n99917=ApTel\n99918=ApTel\n99919=ApTel\nBut for now, i only added 99911 only from Aptel and 99914 from Azartel. Because Azartel Started working with 99914 and ApTel currently registering for 99911 only. Altough all of 9991(Based on ITU Docs) and other news are for NeginTel. But I'm not sure about future status of ther phone numbers. For example, if Azartel brand developed, maybe company(NeginTel) want to give 99914 to 99919 to Azartel and 99911 to 99913 to ApTel or even create new brands for other numbers. If any changes happened=I will add that changes to libphonenumber.\nIt's not possible that we slect NeginTel for all of 9991 numbers. Because users and poeple know them as ApTel and Azartel. They don't know NeginTel.\nEvidince=Azartel and Aptel websites and check their number range. In addition, you can check wikipedia and Numbering Plan(My Numbering Plan).\nIn addition, it's NeginTel website that verifying really NeginTel is MVNO. But NeginTel's Brands are ApTel and Azartel\nPay attention: In iran, because companies law, in most of cases, companies are working with their brands not with their names!. I edited it.. I edited it.. OK. I removed them.. If you look at Numbering Plan File(Mine=ITU+Operators List or Directly from ITU), you will see 99810 instead of 998.\nIn addition, shatel mobile shows only numbers starting with 99810 when you want to register for a new number.\nYou can check from here: https://my.shatelmobile.ir/shatelclients/wicket/page?3 (You can change language to English if it was Persian, by click on UK flag in page)\nBut as you saw, the news in their official website saying 998. It's because they aquired licence of 99810 for start of working, but they will add to range(They will aquire licence from regulatory) if for more numbers in 998.\nIt's an advertsing technique for them that anouncing 998 from first step. We should look at reallities, not advertisings. One of important reallities is ITU document that showing 99810 and onother one is registeration system in their offiicial website that registering for 99810 number for now.\nIf they accquired all of 998 or started to registration of 9982 or 9983, i will add it to libphone number in future.\nWe should keep libphonenumber synced with current status not pllaned status of operators. \n. I doesn't use any + sign. It's github system when i edit a line, it shows it with - and red color and + and green color.\nAnd when i add any line, github shows it as + with green color.\nI added fa lolcale in here https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/pull/2028. The site that you mentoined, is anarestan's official website. (www.anarstan.com/en/about)\nBut Anarestan isn't only an MVNO. It's a company that working on mobile and children, teens and students(Wide from Sepecial sim cards for children via Anarestan MVNO to Building an Android Market that is for Children and Teacher and Students) to special mobile internet for children(Bad contents for children blocked). In addition, anarestan offering mobile apps that are for mobile based elearning for students and schools.\nAll of these products are working under anarestan.\nNote: That link you mentoined from wikipedia, is for LOTUSTEL(+9899900) not anarestan.\nYou can visit this page about anarestan sim cards(Anarestan MVNO):\nhttp://www.anarestan.com/en/service/anarestans-sim-card/\nAnarestan simcards in first steps was prepaid IR-MCI simcards with special services via anarestan(For students) with prefix numbers of IR-MCI. But when iranian regulatory announced for MVNOs, anarestan also requsted to founding it's own MVNO and currently delivering anarestan simcards with it's own MVNO brand and prefix number(+989944) not IR-MCI.\nFor more services and products from anarestan, you can check it's website's services menu. .

Please revert this?. 976 86 is Unitel we have IR 21 doc for that. 976 85 is mentioned only in crc.gov.mn. And for 83xx which is assigned to G-Mobile, this is not mentioned even in the latest IR 21 doc so we can't make it generic. We need official evidence to do so.. No problem, then we can ignore that :). The document https://www.g-mobile.mn/en/ns/51.html is more than 3 years old, we are unable to translate it as it is in image format. We need evidence that we can understand. \nIt seems like 53\\d{6} used to be mobile, renumbered to 83{6}, then 53\\d{6} was made available to fixed-line, but we are not sure of it. Apart from that, even a document evidencing that a renumbering from 53\\d{6} to 83\\d{6} happened does not mean that 83\\d{6} is completely assigned. . The doc doesn't fit our evidence guidelines. We request you to file a separate validation issue for 53\\d}6} migrating to 83\\d{6} range.\nWe will push this PR with other changes that you have made, so please revert 97683|G-Mobile.

We can't accept it without evidence.. 2202 is given as Gonz\u00e1lez Cat\u00e1n , Viceroy of the Pine in wikipedia. La Matanza is not mentioned anywhere in the whole doc.. We had 2221 as Ver\u00f3nica. But you have changed it to Magdalena/Punta Indioa. Could you help us understand why it should be these two only? Why not any other area listed like Ver\u00f3nica or \u00c1lvarez Jonte etc?. Again this is given as Glew, Guernica.. Let's keep the geocoding mapping consistent to max 4 digit granularity. As mentioned by you Cachar\u00ed and Chillar belong to Azul so no need of these entries. 542281|Azul, Buenos Aires will suffice.  . As mentioned above, let's keep the geocoding mapping consistent to max 4 digit granularity. 54249|Tandil, Buenos Aires will suffice.  . 261 should be Mendoza, Mendoza right? Could you please change it. I noticed that the sheet mentions Capital in many places. Can you please change it everywhere?. 2225 should be San Vicente/Alejandro Korn? I see Alejandro Korn is highlighted in Wiki. Please do the same changes as mentioned in English version of the file.

No, this file was there before only, it was created back in 2013 for the first time. You are now just making few changes :). One last correction and then we are good to go :)\nAs per https://www.lifecell.ua/en/about_lifecell/main/ it should be in lower case so can you change 'Lifecell' to 'lifecell'. Hi,\nChanging the line number would not work as it could change again in future. So it is better to always use permalink. Could you please copy paste the below link.\nhttps://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/blob/39b0f4a71a94637407adea4cbda73348b3fb2ce9/java/libphonenumber/src/com/google/i18n/phonenumbers/PhoneNumberUtil.java#L3500. Unleashed is the company and we prefer the brand names instead. As mentioned in the comment above prefix 456 seems to be assigned to JIM Mobile only https://jimmobile.be/nl/contact/ so 456 should be JIM Mobile rather than Unleashed.. Unleashed website https://unleashed.be/ still says that it has 3 brands 'Mobile Vikings, JIM Mobile and Stievie.'. ",

    "yinzara": "I used the  wrong user to submit the commit. Need to recreate.. I've requested to join but do not have the ability to post.\nThe issue is not with the overloading of the methods.  The issue is with compatibility of the library with code compiled against older versions.\nIn my specific example, I have a production application that uses the libphonenumber library running 8.6.0 and uses the 'parse' method of PhoneNumberUtil.  I get a report that we are rejecting a specific phone number as invalid. I see that the change that would make that number valid is in libphonenumber 8.8.2 metadata.   I replace my libphonenumber-8.6.0.jar with libphonenumber-8.8.2.jar.  I restart my application and it crashes because when it attempts to call the original \"parse\" method of PhoneNumberUtil because the method does not exist (as it was compiled against the prior version which took in a String and the new version takes in a CharSequence).\nI am in a regulated environment where recompiling my application will require approval from a regulatory board and cost my company time and resources (and means a delay of at least a month).  I do not need approval when changing public versions of libraries.  Because of this, I have no option but to keep the original 8.6.0 version of the library or recompile my application and go through regulatory approval again.\nBecause the method signatures changed (even though they changed to an interface that the concrete class implements), code compiled against the original methods will be unable to upgrade to a version of the library without recompiling their library against the newer APIs.\nThis discourages users of the library from upgrading from prior version of the library as it requires them to recompile their applications and not be backwardly compatible.. I've put together an example to demonstrate my point.\nSee:\nhttps://github.com/yinzara/libphonenumber-exp\nIf you run \"./compile.sh\" that will compile Example.java using libphonenumber-8.6.0.jar\nYou can then \"./run-old.sh 7025251231\" and see it correctly validates the number using libphonenumber-8.6.0.jar.\nYou can then \"./run-new.sh 7025251231\" and see it throws a NoSuchMethodException because the 'parse' method that takes a String no longer exists.\nThis means anyone upgrading from libphonenumber-8.6.0 and lower to libphonenumber-8.7.0 and higher will need to recompile their applications first (and some may not even have the original source code).\nMy pull request will make the library compatible without requiring dependent libraries to recompile.. While I understand your perspective, \"good practice\" is exactly that, a suggested practice.  \nWith a library as widely used as libphonenumber, the authors should strive to be backwards and forwards compatible with all changes so that people using the library have the greatest flexibility especially when most changes to the library are metadata about the validity and structure of phone numbers (which implies the library needs to be regularly updated to keep up to date with current metadata).  This a central tenant of the java programming language (i.e. version compatibility).\nMany times the library that compiled against libphonenumber is one that the user has no control of (i.e. another third party library that uses libphonenumber in which you utilize that library).   The change made in 8.7.0 is a \"breaking change\" that causes all prior versions of the library to be incompatible with future versions.   My pull request adds less than 1k to the size of the library and allows for the library to be backward and forward compatible with prior and future versions.\nThere are already a number of issues filed in different issue trackers on the web in which this problem has occurred outside of my use case:\nhttps://github.com/fbsamples/account-kit-samples-for-android/issues/16\nhttps://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/issues/3320 \nI would like a consensus by the community as to reject or accept this patch beyond a single contributor.\nI have created a forum post requesting more discussion on the matter.\n. I have added an additional example in the above Git repo:\nhttps://github.com/yinzara/libphonenumber-exp\nIn this example \"awesome-shared-library\" is an hypothetical shared java library controlled by another organization (whether it be another company not providing you the source or an open source project you do not control).   It depends on libphonenumber-8.6.0.  It uses libphonenumber to validate numbers passed to it before providing it's \"awesome\" functionality to the user of the library.\n\"my-app\" is a very simple example java library with only a test case in which it depends on libphonenumber-8.8.12 (because it needs the updated metadata because of a change in some phone number regions) and calls a hypothetical \"doAwesome\" method with an example phone number.\nThe test case fails because of a runtime MethodNotFoundException.  It it uncorrectable unless the person who provides the \"awesome-shared-library\" is willing (and still available) to update the library to the newer version and provide an updated compilation.\nWith this pull request, this issue could have been completely avoided and the library be fully forward and backward compatible.\n.

What comments should I still follow up on? For me, this PR is ready to merge. If it isn't, please tell me what's missing.. As stated in the commit message, Unleashed will very soon (probably this month) start distributing 456-prefixed phone numbers for Mobile Vikings too. A similar mention to that on JIM's contact page can be found on this FAQ page:\n\nThe short number for voicemail remains the same at 1933. If you want to call your voicemail from abroad, bear in mind that the number now is +32 456 19 19 33 instead of +32 486 19 33 33.\n\nSince the same prefix will be used for new onboardings for both brands (and MV is the bigger one, by the way), it is wrong to call it JIM Mobile. It would be fine to list \"JIM Mobile/Mobile Vikings\" if you think \"Unleashed\" is inappropriate.. Also as stated in the commit message, Stievie is not a mobile carrier (it's a tv app, as explained on https://unleashed.be/brands/) and has nothing to do with phone numbers at all.
