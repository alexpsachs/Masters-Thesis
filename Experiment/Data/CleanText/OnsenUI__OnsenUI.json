By the way, we searched for the app in Japan's Google Play, but it's not there.\nWe can find the web version but it say it's not compatible with our Nexus 7 device.\n. great!\n. +1\n. in my case i used \nindex.html\n<body ng-controller=\"AppCtrl\">\n    <ons-screen page=\"initial_page.html\"></ons-screen>\n</body>\ninitial_page.html\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\ncontroller\n```\nmyApp.controller('AppCtrl', function($scope) {\n    $scope.user = {\n        loggedIn: false;\n    }\n$scope.login = function(){\n    $scope.user.loggedIn = true;\n};\n\n$scope.logout = function(){\n    $scope.user.loggedIn = false;\n}\n\n});\n```\ni hope this help your use case.\n. I am thinking of compiling the content of screen page against screen parent's scope.

Great!! Make sense!\n\nBTW, I saw that on the onseenui-screen branch you added watchers for the page in the onsScreen, which I'm already using in the current project.

Oh i see.\nIn that case, you are dealing with vertical layout.\nWhat you can do is use display: table as done in this stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/a/12242226/271669\nor you can use percentage height. eg. give 40% to the map, and 60% to the list as in this plunkr http://plnkr.co/edit/zLDryv?p=preview\n. @tiptronic all the comments and issues help make Onsen UI better.\n. @tiptronic you need to modify the code for now.\nHere is the related issue. https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/21\n. We need to integrate it to another system which doesn't support bower yet.\nSo we have to include everything there.\nWe are working on that.\n. we have angular-js specified in bower dependency but not yet for topcoat and font-awesome.\nDo you have any use-case that is not being supported by current onsenui bower?\n. just pushed version 1.0.4 to bower and now it's just its own self.\n.

This is new spec:\nI separate Navigator Toolbar and Custom Navigator Toolbar.\nNavigator toolbar\n```\n\n\n// left buttons\n$scope.myLeftButtons = [\n    {\n        content: '',\n        onTap: onHomeButtonTapped         \n    },\n    {\n        content: 'Edit',\n        onTap: onEditButtonTapped\n    }\n];\n// right buttons\n$scope.myRightButtons = [\n    {\n        content: 'Done',\n        onTap: onDoneButtonTapped         \n    },\n    {\n        content: '',\n        onTap: onAddButtonTapped\n    }\n];\n// title\n$scope.myTitle = \"Page 1\";\n// back button\n$scope.myBackButton = {\n    content: '',\n    onTap: onBackButtonTapped\n};\n$scope.shouldHideBackButton = false;\n```\nAPI\ntoolbar\nvar toolbar = ons.$get('#toolbar1');\nleft buttons / right buttons\nvar leftButtons = toolbar.leftButtons;\nvar leftButton1 = leftButtons[0];\nleftButton1.content = '<i class=\"fa fa-add\"></i>';\nleftButton1.onTap = onAddButtonTapped;\ntitle\ntoolbar.title = \"New Tittle\";\nback button\ntoolbar.backButton.content =\"New Back Button\";\ntoolbar.backButton.onTap = onNewBackButtonTapped;\nCustom Navigator Toolbar\n```\n\n\n LEFT CONTENT HERE \n\n<div class=\"center\">\n    <!-- CENTER CONTENT HERE -->\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"right\">\n    <!-- RIGHT CONTENT HERE -->\n</div>\n\n\n```\nAPI\ntoolbar\nvar toolbar2 = ons.$get('toolbar2');\nleft\ntoolbar2.setLeftContent('<span ng-click=\"onDoneClicked()\">Done</span>');\ncenter\ntoolbar2.setCenterContent('<img src=\"logo.png\"></img>');\nright\ntoolbar2.setRightContent('<ons-button type=\"quiet\" ng-click=\"onAddButtonClicked()\"><i class=\"fa fa-add\"></i></ons-button><ons-button type=\"quiet\" ng-click=\"onEditButtonClicked()\">Edit</ons-button>');\n. How do I set toolbar button items without angularJS scope for ons-navigator-toolbar?\n-> i can try check if the function is in the scope or not. if not it will call the non-angular js function.\nAnd why do you separate Navigator Toolbar and Custom Navigator Toolbar? Navigator Toolbar is not for custom?\n-> Good question! thinking about that, may be we dont need Custom Navigator Toolbar at all. If I make the title attribute to accept html text, we dont need the custom version.\n. @bricous fixed! thank you for the issue!\n. You can patch this by adding these lines to your css file.\n.onsen_navigator-back-label {\n    text-overflow: ellipsis;\n    white-space: nowrap;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    text-decoration: none;\n}\n. @bricous thanks for the report. we will look into that.\n.

You can have an array to track page changes.\n. @ttantawy: did you include cordova.js?\nbackbutton event is fired by cordova.\n. @anshulgithub let's discuss it here #122\n. added in 33750b2\n. @marqu3z awesome!! :beer: \n. Again, great work @marqu3z!\n. sorry for late reply. you can bind it to a model.\nIn this case the level model is set to 'one' and the radio value also 'one'. ng-model do the binding of the two!\n<ons-radio-button ng-init=\"level='one'\" ng-model=\"level\" value=\"one\">\n. it's for developer to easily test the code.\nIt can also be used to quickly create prototype.\n. Not now. but we are highly considering it.\n. thanks for reporting.\nthere is a workaround, just change the ng-init true value to a string type:\n<ons-checkbox ng-init=\"checked='true'\" ng-model=\"checked\">Test</ons-checkbox> {{checked}}\n. try max-slide-distance\n<ons-sliding-menu max-slide-distance=\"60%\">\n. current version doesn't recalculate the width when the orientation change. it's a nice to have it recalculate automatically.\n.

I compiled source code with phonegap cloud.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/96\n.\n. @magic-overflow it could be that you load the css files after your javascript files. try to put your css files above(on the head). it's also recommended that you use the local copy. not the one on your server or CDN.\n. @magic-overflow : css should also be above the body tag. it's best to keep them in the head\n. @evoratec could you make a plunker based on this template?\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/yDqnLaYub9kcJ7Gi71LR?p=info\n\nit helps make it faster to solve the issue.\n. Could you give more info about what you want to do?\nI guess you want this?\nhttp://blog.revolunet.com/angular-carousel/\n. @gtsopour it would be nice if you can clear this point:\nSo what you want is something like angular-carousel but with responsive behavior. Am I right?\n. angular-carousel supports responsive as i tested it.\nYou can test it with this plnkr.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/1CAun3?p=preview\n. Yes you can. we encourage you to do so. It renders faster because it doesn't need to do the compilation.\n. @yinjun622 it works. Please see this plunkr for example. http://plnkr.co/edit/1CAun3?p=preview\n.

Could you create a plunker with sliding menu and navigator code.\nI created a template plunker to start with.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/yDqnLaYub9kcJ7Gi71LR?p=info\n. @roboncode you should separate the tabbar from page1.html\nhere is the plunker\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/xP1Inj?p=preview\n. Hi @gtsopour,\nYou need to create another navigator for about.html\nabout_navigator.html\n<ons-navigator\n  page=\"about.html\"\n  left-button-icon=\"fa fa-lg fa-bars\"\n  on-left-button-click=\"ons.slidingMenu.toggleMenu()\">\n</ons-navigator>\nmenu.html\n<ons-page>\n    <ul class=\"topcoat-list\">\n        <ons-list-item\n            ng-click=\"ons.slidingMenu.toggleMenu(); \n            ons.slidingMenu.setAbovePage('about_navigator.html')\">\n            About\n        </ons-list-item>\n    </ul>\n</ons-page>\nHere is the plunker\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/rj5txzuasZZFiX7cfjB6?p=preview\n. @gtsopour thanks for the plunkr.\nHaving looked at your code, I would prefer to use separate navigator for each section of the menu. The reason for that is each navigator has its own page stack. You will get correct page stack handling when you push/pop pages.\n. @gtsopour you are welcome!\n. custom element does not play well with other directives, you should wrap ons-icon with a div or span and use ng-show there.\n. :+1: \n. @svrooij Thanks for the great idea!\nGreat to have in our templates.\n. @HagaiPipko the link is fixed!\nThanks for reporting.\n. @manviny you may need to put the code in the controller and wait for the page to be initialized before calling the map code.\nHere is the plunker.\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/ATRsIL?p=preview\n. You need to give a height to the list so that it scrolls when its content is bigger than its height.\n.list {\n   height: 94%\n}\n. @gtsopour it's not compatible for the current version. We are planing for the next major version. That being said, you can still combine them and use the css component. \n. @spidfire You can get the params via:\nons.navigator.getCurrentPage().options.params\n. Both are based on AngularJS and rely heavily on directives.\nOnsen UI has more detailed animation esp that of the Navigator.\n. @moxyplus  looks nice! could you sign the CLA?\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ldg4_QReI2hC12HvF1OuDhW1QromvXat6kA4Uhdsw2M/viewform\n. @ram-you Thanks for your suggestion. It's now taller.\nBest Regards.\n. @moxyplus great work!\nIt would be nice if you could checkout the dev branch, and do the pull request from your dev branch to this project dev branch instead of master.\nThis pull request is fine. I merge it to dev by hand. It would make things easier if you can make it dev branch.\nAnyway, big thanks for your excellent contributions.\n:beers: \n. This could be wrong path reference.\nIf you have Android 4.4 (Kit Kat) you can use remote debug to check the error message.\nIf you prefer a simpler way, online IDE monaca supports Onsen UI and you can test project on your mobile with their app Monaca Debugger.\n. The next version will not have topcoat prefix.\nHowever, migrating Stylus to SASS or LESS will stay at least for the next version.\nCurrently Stylus serves us well. We will consider switching if it provides enough pros.\n. The list take full height which is discussed here: #40 \nFor now, you can put a bottom margin.\nons-list > .scroller-wrapper {\n  margin-bottom: 44px;\n}\nHere is the plunker:\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/D2PBF8?p=preview\n. @anshul28 Yes, it's possible. Ideally, navigator should tell a page when it's being shown or removed. The show event is not implemented but the removed/destroyed is implemented.\nSo you can listen to $destroy event on other pages. and tell the navigator to hide it.\nHere is the plunker\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/PNcD5X?p=preview\n. The navigator take 400ms to finish the animation. You can try putting\na setTimeout()\nfor the broadcast.\nOn Thursday, May 22, 2014, anshulgithub notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nOk, but as you can see on plunker, when you click on page2 for a part of\nsecond top navigation bar is show.

    "masahirotanaka": "Any workarounds?\n. Hi all, I'm Masa somewhat participating in Onsen UI development. Thank you guys for the requests to tWindows support, and I realized there are so many demands.\nIn short: Yes, we would like to support Windows (or Internet Explorer to be precise)\nHowever since Onsen UI is a WebKit (or Blink) optimized product, we need to solve quite a few fundamental problems. Also, when it comes to the development of the Windows Store Apps, not only the CSS but some JavaScript codes like eval needs to be replaced.\nI first like to try Onsen UI running on Spartan, and on the latest Windows Phone 8.1, to see how much effort would be necessary to support those platforms. Unfortunately we're in Japan where there's no Windows Phone sold in this country, @sebastianbk offer is so appreciated.\nIf anybody knows, does Windows 10 (and Windows 10 Phone) run on Spartan engine for both Website and the Store app? Appreciated if some of you guys can join us and work on together for supporting Windows platforms.\n. Just for a quick update, we are digging into the problems occurring on Windows devices. Will start pushing IE supported code to another branch.\n. Hi guys,\nWe finished supporting Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 (so-called Windows Universal). It is already on the master branch.\nOur team have done some tests based on the basic scenarios, and they are already passing. But since our test cases are limited, it is really appreciated if you guys take a look at the latest master branch and report us issues if you find any.\nThank you!\n. Hi, thanks for getting in touch.\nUnfortunately we cannot provide a automatic way to convert your app for 1.1.0.\nDisplayed a blank screen tend to be the reason that Onsen UI cannot be loaded properly, or have no component in the page. Please take a look at the guide and see if you need to fix the source code.\nIf you have any specific questions, we are happy to help you out.\n. Hi Tincoboekestijn,\nJust wanted to know if you have noticed our last message.\nWould be great if you could open the form below and submit to us.\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/13e_me1JPJeG9PUJdnLxv2jEk5QPmFkZZft7Flm-gXSA/viewform\nThanks!\n. Hi,\nThanks for the feedbacks. We will try to improve the problem by replacing content after the page loading finish (currently the content is replaced right after the user taps a tab item).\n. Thanks guys. We will consider including pull-to-refresh in the future version.\n. Thanks for the report. Let us see the CSS again.\n. Hi @gtsopour and @mdjamal,\nOnsen UI will also support Cordova keyboard plugin in 1.2. Hope that helps solving the issue.\n. Hi @nehulagr and @gtsopour,\nWe are going to support carousel component in 1.2. Please stay tuned.\n. Thanks. Further ticket will be migrated to #177.\n. Hi @Hirbod,\nWhich pattern are you looking for?\nWe put patterns in GitHub over here: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/tree/master/css-components/www/patterns Appreciated if you could tell me which was beneficial to you.\n. Hi again,\nIs this the one?\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/ac088c7a9bae4da38125d7f2c09958727bf8be4f/css-components/www/patterns/profile.html\n. Hi again,\nHere are two more options from the archive.\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/onsen-css-components/blob/a16395ad2409c22bea2548db1290ad32b46abce7/www/patterns/facebook_like_profile.html\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/onsen-css-components/blob/a16395ad2409c22bea2548db1290ad32b46abce7/www/patterns/facebook-card.html\nThey are using CSS styling but not using Onsen directives, but hope this is the one you are asking for!\n. Thanks. What phone and Android version is this? Also is this running on Chrome, or what browser?\n. I have setup Amazon CloudFront (CDN server) for onsen.io domain. I will switch the DNS once it confirmed to work fine. \n@Hirbod, would you please check the following Website, and see if the speed increases:\nhttp://d3cttgs8lm47oc.cloudfront.net\n. Cool. We will also consider migrating components website once they are ready too!\n. Hi @Hirbod,\nHere is the CloudFront hosted components site.\nhttp://d1335n1ec8jhjp.cloudfront.net/patterns\nI've already made it available from components.onsen.io, so it will be switched once the DNS record changes. Hope it also improved the performance from your network.\n. Thanks @Hirbod! We'll put somewhere about this in the doc. . Thanks for the issue report. It is likely a problem of QuickStart template that it forgets to include Cordova.js. Our blog post mentions we will update  Cordova version on our remote build server, but that does not affect your local environment. Therefore, we will fix the template to include Cordova.js to solve your issues. Thanks! \n. Nice!\n:+1: \n. That's a super nice idea. fran++;\n. Thanks. Great work @frankdiox!\nI like all of your decisions mentioned above.\nI just would like to know if you also will work on the items we discussed earlier, like adding effect attribute. I noted them down on the URL below, so please also take a look at it and see if you want to include some of the enhancements.\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/1125\n. Thanks :+1: \n. @frankdiox ++\n. Thanks for the report @jonathandotchin. We'll take a look.\n. @frankdiox @argelius Looks like this is a issue with Windows Phone (Edge?) environment. If it can be fixed rather quickly that's appreciated.\n. @frankdiox Thanks. Some suggestions:\n1. I think we can only support Windows Phone 10+.\n2. Did we still support Android 4.0.2? I thought we support 4.1 and onwards.\n3. Can you change the first \"Onsen UI\" (H1) to \"Onsen UI - HTML5 Hybrid Mobile App Framework\"\n4. The Monaca piece looks good. Can you add the following information:\n   To use Monaca CLI:\n$ [sudo] npm -g install monaca\n   $ monaca create helloworld # And choose the starter template\n   $ monaca preview # Preview on the browser\n   $ monaca debug # Preview on the real device\n5. \"How to manually build this project\" section can be shorter: It's for high-end users so I think it's enough if we just describe what command to use\n. Sure. Looks good! :+1: \n. Hi! Thanks for trying to use Onsen UI with Meteor.\nIf that's not too complex, we might be able to solve the issue. Please stay tuned!\n. Yes, I think this is a good way for reporting issue.

As the conclusion in the meeting, let's go with (1).. Thanks @anatoo. We should have done this before.... I think it a way too big change that affects all users prevent upgrading. Let discuss formatting css class names when we do a major version update. . Sorry I just found out this PR.\nLGTM, would you go ahead and merge this? @puku0x . Sure thing. Since they are on a vacation now, I assigned @asial-matagawa for merge request.. Cool! Closing the issue.. Sorry that it did't worked out. Since Onsen UI is based on Web Components, and requires many tweaks to support Vue and other VDOM frameworks, sometimes you feel easier to use other solutions that natively supports newer frameworks. I'm going to close this issue since this is not a bug.\n@KettleCooked Yes we support Onsen but we put a bit higher priority if the user access to our official support window. Currently we are facing to deal with the trial & error for sustainable open source support.. Thanks! I can't access to your gitlab snippets. Can you give us access to it?. One way is to visit the following page and configure the default parameters.\nhttps://onsen.io/theme-roller/\nPlease replace the CSS with the generated code.\nWe don't recommend to override from the external css files.. Thanks!\nIf you want to compress CSS, you could either\n\nManually compress CSS: https://csscompressor.com/\nUse Grunt or Gulp to automate the job: https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglifycss\nUse Webpack, Parcel and the like to import CSS\n\nHope some of the solutions above works out for you.. I think this is not yet supported. I'll tag it as Enhancement and we'll take a look at this in the next major or minor.\nThanks for the report!. Update. We're working on this, so should be ready soon.. I think you're referring to Overscroll Behavior.\nPlease check this page: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/overscroll-behavior\nIf you want a pull-to-refresh component,  component should be what you want: https://onsen.io/v2/api/js/ons-pull-hook.html. Thanks! Let us double-check using the actual device.. Right. We will fix this and release by today or tomorrow.. Looks like gulp-protractor has updated to 4.1.1, so this issue should has been solved now.\nI'm asking @emccorson to double check.. ",

Implemented on v1.1.0. Closing.\n. Closing.\n. Fixed #40. \"ons-list\" does not have take full height on \"dev\" branch.\n. Implemented on \"dev\" branch.\nWe can put anything on navigation bar like below.\n```\n\n\nhoge\nTitle\nLabel\n\nPage1\n\n```\n. Fixed on https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/0780e40acaa53099e99bf6ef9b4ac9434c7d13d0\n. Implemented on \"dev\" branch.\nWe can put anything on navigation bar like below.\n```\n\n\nhoge\nTitle\nLabel\n\nPage1\n\n```\n. How can I update toolbar items? \nCan you propose ons.navigator's new API for that like the following?\n```\n// in Angular.js scope\nons.navigator.leftSection = '?';\nons.navigator.title = '?';\n// in JavaScript global scope\nmyNavigator.updateLeftSection(???);\nmyNavigator.updateTitle = 'My Title';\n```\nother TODO:\n- Back button customization\n  - label, icon, visibility...\n  - hook to tap back button\n  - updating back button behavior after navigator's pushPage.\n. How do I set toolbar button items without angularJS scope for ons-navigator-toolbar?\nAnd why do you separate  Navigator Toolbar and Custom Navigator Toolbar? Navigator Toolbar is not for custom?\n. Added support for type=\"submit\" on \"dev\" branch.\n. We decided to remove topcoat themes, and use Onsen CSS Components(components.onsenui.io) in v1.1 release.\n. Implemented on \"dev\" branch.\nOnsen UI has predefined template feature like below:\n<script type=\"text/ons-template\" id=\"page1.html\">\n   <!-- template page code here -->\n</script>\nor\n<script type=\"text/ng-template\" id=\"page1.html\">\n   <!-- template page code here -->\n</script>\n. Fixed: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/529871c852217e432bf38a29aedb271fe8dd75ea\n. Added support to android back-button on ons-navigator and ons-sliding-menu on v1.1.1.\n. Implemented on \"dev\" branch.\nOnsen UI is now checking iOS7 without Cordova device plugin.\n. On version 1.1, ons-list element is no longer to take full height.\n. Hi @Glitchbone,\nCan you show your code that reproduce this bug?\nI tried ng-click on ons-tabbar-item element, but it just work properly.\n. Hi @lsale,\nIf ons-navigator element does not exists, $rootScope.ons.navigator object is undefined.\nPut ons-navigator element to use ons.navigator object.\n. Hi @lextiz,\nThank you for reporting.\nThis bug's cause is probably because ons-list has position: absolute; style to make full-screen.\nIn next v1.1 release, you can choose full-screen list or inline list.\n. Use normal html elements instead of ons-list & ons-scroller elements.\n<ul rn-carousel class=\"image\">\n    <div class=\"topcoat-list\"><ul class=\"topcoat-list__container\">\n      <li class=\"topcoat-list__item\">foo</li>\n    </ul></div>\n    <div class=\"topcoat-list\"><ul class=\"topcoat-list__container\">\n      <li class=\"topcoat-list__item\">bar</li>\n    </ul></div>\n  </ul>\nIt will just works.\n. Hi @LizMyers,\nCurrently ons-search-input element does not have X button to clear text.\nWe will consider to add it.\n. Hi @MarkusPoparkus,\nThank you for reporting.\nCan you share any reproducible code?\n. Thank you for the issue. \nIt is a bug on split-view. We will fix it.\n. We are now rewriting ons-navigator element code to get more flexibility for v1.1.\nOn v1.1, you can react controller on clicking navigation bar item.\n. We will release before the month is out.\nYou can just declare navigation bar items to change the items per individual page on v1.1.\nThe following code will work.\nindex.html:\n```\n\n\n\nTitle\nRight Items\n\nContent text\n\n\n\n```\npage1.html:\n```\n\n\nTitle\nDifference Items\n\nContent text\n\n```\n. Current Onsen UI version is v1.0.4.\nWait for v1.1 release, or check out \"dev\" branch if you want to try now.\n. We released v1.1. You can just put html element in ons-toolbar element and add event listeners.\nSee an example: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/aHmGL\n. Hi @warpech,\nCurrently, Onsen UI is actually not custom elements but just Angular.js directives.\nWe are considering Polymer or x-tags or other solution, but this plan is still in the air.\n. We are rewriting \"ons-navigator\" code in \"dev\" branch for version 1.1.\nIn v1.1, you can customize navigation-bar title in the template file, also put an image on the bar title.\n. In version 1.1.0, you can just put html elements to customize navigation-bar title. \nSee actual code: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/aHmGL\n. Hi @vladipus,\nThanks for your suggestion. We consider to add ons-bottom-toolbar-item in future release.\nCurrent workaround is here:\n<ons-bottom-toolbar>\n    <div style=\"line-height: 44px\">FooBar</div>\n</ons-bottom-toolbar>\n. Hi @evoratec,\nWhat you said as \"ionic framework has solved this problem\" is \"ion-infinite-scroll\"?\n. Hi @felaozhiyong,\nCan you share your code?\n. Where is ng-controller attribute that use \"noticeAdvancedCtrl\"? Share your code on jsfiddle.net.\n. Hi @dev20881,\nOnsen UI does not support Windows Phone platforms.\n. Onsen UI is not tested on Windows Phone. Because we don't have any Windows Phone devices.\nCurrently we are writing code for iOS and Android platform.\nIf Onsen UI could provide full UI components and works completely on both platforms, next we will start to write code for Windows Phone platform.\n. We have no plan to support windows phone platform.\n. Merged. Thank you for the pull request.\n. Hi @AndrewKovalenko,\nI just forget about CLA.

Probably,  ons-navigator's css transform occurred this blurry rendering.\n. Hello @jpuerto, \nCurrently, we have no plan to support AMD load on Onsen UI.\nI don't merge this pull request.\n. Hello @AndrewKovalenko,\nWe are developing for version 1.1 on \"dev\" branch, and on \"dev\" branch, the feature that display view in navigator title is already implemented. Please check out dev branch.\n. We have no plan to accept template string for presentPage() or pushPage().\nIn dev1.1, you can use $templateCache to declare page. Just try it.\n<script type=\"text/ng-template\" id=\"page2.html\">\n  ...\n</script>\nor \n<script type=\"text/ons-template\" id=\"page2.html\">\n  ...\n</script>\n. Hi @trazek,\nYou know, Onsen UI use FastClick library to remove tap delay. Your app's tap delay is strange behavior.\nPlease write more details like device, OS version, live code or else.\n. Hi @beavermml ,\nWe release Onsen UI v1.1.0. Your problem is reproducible on v1.1.0?\n.

Thank you for this reporting.\nFixed on: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/9fab15a309d094b33545df36656a3591f920057d\n. Thank you for this reporting, we will fix this issue on version 1.1.1 by adding new ons-navigator's method.\n. Hi @JoaoSaleiro,\nIn v1.1.1, we added new ons-navigator's method to solve this problem.\nYou can use insertPage() method to adds a page into any level in the page stack.\nExample code is here: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/fhdjg\nDetails: http://onsenui.io/guide/overview.html#Managingpagestacks\n. Hi @webeau,\nYou can just ignore \"options.css is required\" error. This does not break sliding-menu behavior.\nThis error is fixed on master branch: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/a6d64f97aa00e49fb676134f8cc3c4deaa3da125\n. This is probably a bug. \nAngular controllers should run after dom attached.\nWe will fix it.\n. Maybe dup of #157. We will fix this problem.\n. Hi @OpenNoob,\nWe are now updating monaca's project template for Onsen UI v1.1.\nProject template update is coming soon.\n. Hi @Nataraj32,\n\" 'webkitRequestAnimationFrame' is vendor-specific. Please use the standard 'requestAnimationFrame' instead.\" \nYou can just ignore this error message. This error does not break sliding-menu behavior.\nAnd can you share your code that produce second problem about setAbovepage()?\n. Thank you for this reporting. This is a bug. \nThe composition of ons-tabbar and ons-sliding-menu should work properly. We will fix it.\n. Hi @OpenNoob ,\nI tried your code, but menu's methods works properly.\nPlease share codepen that reproduce this bug and your device.\n. Hi @gtsopour,\nMaster/Detail example works properly on my latest build without $timeout.\nI pushed new build on https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/5967168993d224769bb3971ca855a5dfc0c7c5d0.\nCould you try master/detail example again?\n. @gtsopour \nI confirmed that ons-navigator's page scope does not work properly on your example.\nThank you again for this reporting. I'm going to fix this problem.\n. Hi, \"ons-page\" is scrollable on v1.1.0.\nYou can just use ons-page without ons-scroller.\n. Hi @arzanardi,\nThank you for this reporting.\nI confirmed that ons-navigator has dom leak.\nProbably, this issues is not caused by ng-animate, because ons-navigator implementation does not use ng-animate. \nWe will fix this problem. \n. Fixed on 90457078a6d6612afe3a626db7e481ba8f00a911.\n. Hi @gtsopour,\n\"ons-back-button\" do popPage in current \"ons-navigator\" element.\nWrap a page contain \"ons-back-button\" in \"ons-navigator\".\n. I've created simple example use sliding-menu and navigator.\nCodepen is here: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/CAmjb\n. Hi @trippo80,\nThank you for this reporting. We will fix this problem.\n. You are welcome :)\n. Hi @khoshrou, \nYou can use ons-navigator's pushPage() instead of ons-screen's presentPage(). And you can also use same animation of presentPage() by animation option like below.\nons.navigator.pushPage('page.html', {animation: 'lift'});\ncodepen is here: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/IFquK\n. @khoshrou \nComposition of ons-navigator and ons-split-view should work properly.\nAnd also you can combine any ons-* components. \nIf some components combo does not work properly, just report it.\n\nPS. Seems the link for Download 1.1.1 on your home page is wrong. It downloads one of your templates.\n\nThanks for reporting. But it's not wrong link.\n. Yes,  Onsen UI project template include complete cordova project. \nBecause Onsen UI is built for cordova/phonegap unlike the jQuery mobile.\nBut we provide another way to install Onsen UI library.\nIf you want to get Onsen UI library only, use bower like below.\n$ bower install onsenui\n. You can get Onsen UI library only with bower.\nbower is not acceptable for you? If not acceptable, why?\n. I know that including Cordova directory might be the bottleneck when the directory structure will be changed in the future, as you say.\nHowever this is also related to our marketing plan and the problem is not a quite simple one. \nSo I will discuss with the team, and consider to it.\nThank you.\n. Currently, Onsen UI has no plan to support IE and firefox.\nBecause this framework is built for mobile application.\nSo I do nothing now for this problem.\nBut your pull request to fix this issue is welcome.\n. This issue is dup of #165.\nFixed already on master branch.\n. More information is required.\nCould you provide some example code or description or else?\n. More information is required.\nCould you provide some example code or description or else?\n. @gtsopour, @siegfriedbolz \nI tried to reproduce a bug about checkboxes and radio buttons on iOS7 device and Mobile Safari, but those work properly.\nCould you provide live code and iOS version?\n. You can use 'postchange' event on ons-tabbar.\nExample code is here: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/FqJjt\n<ons-tabbar> overview: http://onsenui.io/guide/overview.html#UsingTabBar\n. Hi @jastakhova,\nThis issues is maybe dup of #165 and I fixed already on master branch.\nCould you try with current build?\n. Hi @khoshrou,\nWhat can I do to support RTL languages? \nPlease write more details.\n. Currently we have no plan to support RTL languages.\nSo I don't want to implement those features for the time being.\nIf you want RTL support, just implement by yourself.\nYour pull-request is welcome anytime.\n. Hi @aliv,\nUse ng-include in you case like below.\n```\n\n\n  ...\n\n\n  <ons-toolbar><div class=\"center\">\n    foobar\n  </div></ons-toolbar>      \n\n```\n. Use ons-toolbar without wrapping in ons-navigator.\nExample is here: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/cldmz\n. I understood what is your use case.\nCurrently Onsen UI does not provide a formal way for that.\nThank you for this request.\nI consider to add a way to do that.\n. Hi @nokturnal,\nThank you for this reporting. \n\"ons-modal\" should display itself on top of current \"ons-page\" and \"ons-toolbar\".\nWe will fix this problem.\n. Merged. Thank you for this pull request!\n. Hi @paulobarbosa1,\nI want more information about your problem.\nCould you share the code that reproduce this problem?\n. Thank you for this reporting. We will fix this problem.\n. Thank you for this reporting. We will fix this problem.\n. Hi @ssone,\nThank you for this reporting. I'm going to fix this problem.\n. Hi @rafaellop ,\n\nWhich version of the template (git or guide) do you recommend for a new app and why the versions differ?\n\nProject template files in git repo is development version for v1.1.2 that is not released.\nWebsite provide project templates for v1.1.1.\nIf you like to use stable version, just use website's distribution.\n\nBy the way I'd like to ask if the future versions of templates will contain ionic fonts (ionicons)?\n\nYes, next release will start to support ionicons on \"ons-icon\" element.\n. > the side menu template if filled with many list items, starts to lag. I mean that the menu slide out is not smooth and sometimes even impossible.\nI don't know what is bottle neck on your app.\nCould you share living code and your device's OS? Please write more details.\n\ndo you as the developers recommend using bindonce for additional speeding up your lists or is a similar feature already implemented?\n\nCurrently Onsen UI does not provided feature on speeding up \"ons-list\".\n. Hi @nokturnal,\nThis is probably duplicate of #165.\nCould you try with fixed onsenui.js?\nFixed onsenui.js is here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/ceda0c06954332ea0b117d66401a2ced3d67e111/build/js/onsenui.js\n. Hi @rafaellop,\nFramework that generator use is v1.0.4 and it's old. \nThat problem is fixed. Try with v1.1.1.\nWe does not touched that generator and it seem to be not maintained.\n\nThis is a good idea for starters to have a yo command for quick app framework with base configruation and grunt.\n\nYes, It's good idea and I'm loving automation with gulp/grunt.\nCurrently we does not have official yeoman generator, but we will provide solution like that.\n. Oh, thank you this reporting. We will fix this problem. \nWhat is your android version?\n. Closing. Because reproducing this bug failed on v1.1.2-dev.\n. Hi @rafaellop,\nThank you this reporting.\nThat document section is wrong. \"ons-bottom-toolbar\" component does not have same functionality as the \"ons-toolbar\" component.\nThe \"ons-bottom-toolbar\" is just container for layout on bottom. Your screen shot is not wrong. \nWe will fix this docs problem.\n. > No API just own CSS?\nYes, because we does not think specific use cases on \"ons-bottom-toolbar\" unlike \"ons-toolbar\".\nIf you want to put a label like above, write as below.\n<ons-bottom-toolbar>\n  <div class=\"bottom-bar__line-height\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Bottom toolbar</div>\n</ons-bottom-toolbar>\nCodepen is here: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/jwHih\n. \"page\" class elements is just container.\nUse \"page--*__content\" class to set up page's background as below.\n.page--dark-bg__content {\n  background-color: #333;\n}\n. Thank you for this reporting. We will fix this problem.\n. Hi @aliv,\nWhat is your actual problem? \nIf you want to get current page's DOM element, use \"myNavigator.getCurrentPage().element[0]\".\n. Oh I misunderstood your problem, but this behavior is not a bug.\nI'm going to explain about this behavior.\n\"resetToPage()\" method does support \"animation\" option as below.\nnavi.resetToPage('page.html', {animation: 'slide'});\nAnd in order to support \"animation\" option, navigator view must take the sequences as below on \"resetToPage()\":\n1. add new page to page stack\n2. fire \"pageinit\" event \n3. transition animation done\n4. remove all old pages from stack\nThus the behavior is expected result in your example code.\nIf you want to get current ons-page element in \"pageinit\" event listener,\nrefer \"this\" variable instead of using $('#foobar\").\nExample code: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/yrAmC\n. Hi @Eligow ,\n\nConsole logs \"undefined\".\n\nThis is not a bug, but expected result.\nOn \"prepush\" event, the \"ons-navigator\" does not push a page object on the page stack. \nIf you want to get new page's object,  use \"postpush\" event.\n. Hi @dsonet,\nHammer 2.0 has BC break and it break some components behavior. Thus I didn't update Hammer at present.\nI don't know about new version FastClick, so I'm willing to check FastClick.\nAnd we consider to use bower for FastClick and Hammer on next version.\n. Hi @sandeep-agarwal,\nI checked your plnkr, but it seem to works properly.\nCould you provide more informations about your browser or screenshots or anything else to confirm this problem?\n. Hmm... \nPage2 always renders property bottom-toolbar contents on my environments(Chrome version 36.0.1985.143 and MacOS X).\nIs there JavaScript errors on your environments? Open web inspector's console to confirm that there is some errors.\n. I know what you mean, but all components on Onsen UI does not have the rule that human changing must to not fire events.\nFor instance, \"onsNavigator.pushPage()\" fire \"prepush\" and \"postpush\" events and \"onsTabbar.setActiveTab()\" fire \"prechange\" and \"postchange\" events.\nThus I'm not willing to change this components' behavior.\n. Currently it's not possible.\nI will add the event property to detect human change or not on next release.\n. I changed \"triggeredBy\" property name to \"isInteractive\" on https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/e12afef0a526455d77449a65c2a889eed3587c6a.\nI'm not a native speaker of English.\nAs the result of talking a native speaker about this naming, I decided to change this property name.\n. Hi @siegfriedbolz,\nDid you try '<activity android:windowSoftInputMode=\"stateVisible|adjustPan\" . . . >' settings on AndroidManifest.xml?\nYou can specify the soft keyboard behavior with this settings.\nhttp://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#wsoft\n. On corodva-android, \"showkeyboard\" and \"hidekeyboard\" event is fired when the soft keyboard show/hide.\nYou should refine layout in order to show input fields by listening the events.\nThe example for listening keyboard events is here: \nons.ready(function() {\n  document.addEventListener('hidekeyboard', function() { ... }, false);\n  document.addEventListener('showkeyboard', function() { ... }, false);\n});\n. Hi @Tyga76 ,\nDid you run your code without running web server?\nOnsen UI use ajax to retrieve templates.\nIf you run on local file system, requesting with ajax on local file system fail for security reason.\n. I tried to reproduce, but it's seem to work.\nCould you provide more information or your code to reproduce your problem?\n. Great job!\nCould you fill in the contributor agreement form?\nI will merge your pull request after that.\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/13e_me1JPJeG9PUJdnLxv2jEk5QPmFkZZft7Flm-gXSA/viewform\n. Thank you for this reporting. \nWe will fix this problem.\n. hmm....\nWhat is your Android version?\n. Hi @Figedi,\nYour feature request is justified.\nWe consider to add new API to deal with multiple platform on ons-if-platform.\n. Yes! \nWe have plan to implement toolbar variant like Android action bar.\nBut next release does not have it. Probably I will implement it after some months.\n. On android, ons-navigator already provide optimized animation for android.\nAndroid: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/framework/views/simpleSlideTransitionAnimator.js\niOS and other browser: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/framework/views/iosSlideTransitionAnimator.js\nI want to confirm whether if I should fix this issue or not.\nCould you provide more information about this problem or living code on codepen?\n. Hmm....\nI can see \"ons-icon\" render ionicons properly with Chrome and other browsers on this example: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/xAhvg \nCould you provide more information about your environments?\n. Ok, I confirmed this problem on firefox. \nI will fix this problem.\n. Closing.\n. Thank you for this reporting.\nI'm going to fix this typo.\n. Hi @Hirbod,\nYou should nest \"ons-sliding-menu\" element to make a both-side sliding-menu. \nCodepen is here: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/qHeJx\n. I want to reproduce this problem. \nCould you provide more information about your environment or mobile device or browser version?\n. Onsen UI have no api to enable scroll bars.\nBut you can write css manually for rendering scroll bar. \nExample is here: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/mgGwa\n. I don't confirm this problem, because Onsen UI doesn't support android firefox browser.\n. Hi @vnguyen972,\nThis github issues is for reporting a bug about Onsen UI.\nIf you want to have support, you should post to Stackoverflow with 'onsen-ui' tag.\n. Yes, I will add pull-to-refresh component, but implementing is after some months.\n. I tried to confirm this problem, but it seem to work properly.\nCould you provide screenshots and your environments and code for reproducing this issue?\n. I confirmed this problem. Thank you for this reporting.\nI will fix this problem.\n. rgba(#666, 0.5) is invalid expression.\nYou should write rgba(104, 104, 104, 0.5) instead of rgba(#666, 0.5).\nSee w3c spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/\n. You are welcome.\n. Thank you for this reporting, we will fix this problem.\n. Fixed on v1.1.5-dev. Closed.\n. When keyboard is shown, you can use \"tabbar.setTabbarVisibility(false)\" to hide tabbar manually.\nTo detect keyboard, you should use cordova keyboard plugin or other plugins.\n. Onsen UI use AngularJS directives to implement custom-elements.\nIt's currently impossible to get rid of AngularJS from Onsen UI.\n. If you use Onsen UI for developing your apps, you should use v1.1.3.\nDeveloper team use \"master\" branch for active development. It may have some bug and broken code.\n. Hi @irxground ,\nI released v1.1.4 a moment ago. This version is fixed for this issue.\nUse bower to install v1.1.4 because Onsen UI's website is not updated yet for v1.1.4.\nbower install onsenui\n. What do you mean by \"slider\"? \nIf you mean sliding-menu or drawer-menu, you can use \"ons-sliding-menu\" elements.\nBut if you mean components like carousel, you must wait for implementation of that.\n. \"ons-navigator.popPge()\" method has no such options.\nUse \"ons-navigator.getPage()[n].destory()\" and \"ons-navigator.popPage()\".\nAn example is here: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/Exqze\n. I confirmed that blinking screen on iOS8 and your code. We will fix this problem.\n. Fixed on  https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/d656a4351fbb88b409cacab4cb454dc3af79fcb3\n. Hi @alangularte,\nThis place is not a support forum, but for bug reporting.\nYou should post to stackoverflow with 'onsen-ui' tag.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/onsen-ui\n. Merged. Thank you for this pull request.\n. Hi,\nI tried but failed to reproduce this problem on iOS8 simulator.\nCould you provide whole source code or your iOS version?\n. Can you provide screenshots?\n. Ok, thanks for this reporting. \nWe will fix this problem.\n. Hi @kvdv, \nYou can't use data-binding with \"ons-template\" elements. \nIf you want to put templates dynamically, you should $templateCache as the below.\njs\nangular.module('onsen').run(function($templateCache) {\n  $templateCache.put('foo.html', '<ons-page>...</ons-page>');\n});\n. oops, I mistakenly closed this issue. Reopened.\n. Hi,\nIf you want to execute some code on loading sub page with ons-navigator, \nyou should use \"pageinit\" event as the below.\nAn example is here: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/oHLta\n. Merged. Thank you for this pull request!\n. Hi,\nI want to confirm this problem.\nCould you provide whole code to reproduce this split-view bug and some screenshots?\n. Could you provide some code to reproduce this problem on codepen?\n. Good job! This pull request is merged.\n. By the way, when you want to change spec, you should discuss or request review with proposing more better spec.\nIf its difficult to discuss in Japanese, you can discuss with Tanaka-san in English.\n. Hi @trungdq88 ,\n\nIs it right that OnsenUI does not support this feature yet?\n\nCurrently Onsen UI does not support that features.\nBut alert box and dialog box components will be implemented on next v1.2.0.\n\nAnd how do I create one?, for example I want to create new tag  what works with others existing components.\n\nOnsen UI's components is implemented as AngularJS directives.\nIn order to create your own custom tag, just declare directives like the following code.\njs\nangular.module('onsen').directive('onsMyCustomComponent', function() {\n  return {\n    link: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n});\nIf you want to know about directives, see this document: https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$compile\n. Onsen UI does not have that feature that popPage() on swipe-left.\nI received several requests for this feature, so we will discuss whether if we should implement this feature.\nBut it has not been decided to implement this feature now.\n. Currently ons-sliding-menu type is not dynamic.\nWhat is your case that needed dynamic change of animation type?\n. Ok, I will add this feature for changing sliding-menu type dynamically.\n. Great! \nYour pull request is merged.\n. Good job!\nCould you fill in the contributor agreement form?\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/13e_me1JPJeG9PUJdnLxv2jEk5QPmFkZZft7Flm-gXSA/viewform\nI will merge your pull request after that.\n. Hi @mozillamonks,\nJust wanted to know if you have noticed our last message.\nWould be great if you could open the form below and submit to us.\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/13e_me1JPJeG9PUJdnLxv2jEk5QPmFkZZft7Flm-gXSA/viewform\nThanks!\n. @mozillamonks \nOh, this is my mistake. I pasted incorrect URL.\nI'm sorry. Could you resubmit the following form?\nhttps://docs.google.com/a/asial.co.jp/forms/d/1ldg4_QReI2hC12HvF1OuDhW1QromvXat6kA4Uhdsw2M/viewform\n. Hi @nainglinaung ,\nWhat do you mean by \"ons-switch doesn't work\"? \nI created ons-switch example codepen to confirm your problem.\nhttp://codepen.io/onsen/pen/oftha\nBut it seem that ons-switch works properly.\nCould you provide more information about your device and code to confirm this problem?\n. Merged.\n. Thank you for this reporting.\nWe will fix this problem.\n. Don't put \"ons-tabbar\" elements in ons-page.\nYou should use \"ons-tabbar\" like the following code.\n``` html\n\n\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n...\n\n```\n. Hi @eppak,\nYou can use ons.slidingMenu.setSwipable(swipable) method to set swipable or not.\nThis method is not documented in website, but this is document's failure.\n. Hi @GalawynRM,\nIn v1.2, splitView.toggle() will be just removed.\nUse \"ng-if\" to switch ons-sliding-menu and ons-split-view instead of using mimic of sliding-menu.\n. Hi @gevictorfr ,\nYou should use \"ng-swipeleft\" and \"ng-swiperight\" instead of \"ng-dragleft\" and \"ng-dragright\".\n\"drag*\" event may be fired on every touch event.\n. Currently Onsen UI does not swipable table cell feature.\nBut in next v1.2.0, we will add a feature to support carousel and swipable table cell.\n. Thanks for this reporting.\nWe will fix this problem.\n. Question: Does ons.bootstrap(['depModuleName']) work properly?\nIf I passed only one parameters, it seem to \"name == deps\".\nhttps://github.com/argelius/OnsenUI/blob/aed89fd7e2af762eb734977cf703d86f88bf820f/framework/js/onsen.js#L96-L105\n. Merged.\n. Merged. Gread job!\n. Good job! Merged. \n. Thanks for your works! Merged.\n. Merged.\n. Currently Onsen UI does not support scroll position indicator.\nIn order to show scroll indicator, you must implement to simulcation scroll indicator with JavaScript. Because mobile browser does not support scrollbar styling or scroll position indicator.\nWe will consider to add such a feature on next version.\n. Hi @20pro ,\nI created \"ons-tabbar\" example codepen but it seem that \"ons-tabbar\" work properly in \"ons-navigator\".\nCould you provide more information to confirm your problem?\nCodepen is here: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/EHDbg\n. Request: Write warning message when ons-keyboard-active or ons-keyboard-inactive or ons.softwareKeyboard event listeners is used but keyboard plugin is not found.\nDetails: https://redmine.asial.biz/projects/onsenui/wiki/Ons-keyboard-active_v120\n. Merged.\n. Merged.\n. Merged. Good job!\n. Request: BackButtonView, BottomToolbarView, ButtonView, ListView, ListHeaderView, ListItemView, ToolbarButtonView has same code but separate own classes. Make these classes to one generic view class.\n. Good! Merged.\n. Yes, we will submit Onsen UI to PropertyCross.\n. Merged. Thanks!\n. Merged. Thanks! \n. Currently we have no such tool. But we are developing Onsen CLI tool like ionic command and we will release that.\n. Hi @olliekav ,\nYou can add your custom animation on ons-navigator.\nI created an example for custom transition animation: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/dlhwy\nThis example use just simple slide animation without ons-toolbar animating.\n. Request: Could you confirm no DOM leak with web inspector? You added $onsen.removeModifierMethods() but I think it still has DOM leaks.\n. Hi @eppak,\nIt seem that retained focus occur this problem.\nWould you like to remove focus manually on hiding modal?\nProbably you can remove focus by the following code.\ndocument.activeElement.blur()\n. Is this example what you want?\nhttp://codepen.io/onsen/pen/CfnrG\n. Request: Update CHANGELOG.md for ons-alert-dialog.\n. Good job! Merged!\n. Thank you for this reporting. We will fix this issue.\n. We already pushed release tags for v1.1.3 and v1.1.4. \nAnd \"bower info\" command also output v1.1.4 and v1.1.3 as available versions.\n```\n$ bower info onsenui\n...\nAvailable versions:\n  - 1.1.4\n  - 1.1.3\n  - 1.1.2\n  - 1.1.1\n  - 1.1.0\n  - 1.0.4\n  - 1.0.3\n  - 1.0.2\n  - 1.0.1\n  - 1.0.0\n  - 0.7.0\n  - 0.6.0\n```\n. \"ons-bottom-toolbar\" element is just container for bottom toolbar. \nIf you want to align toolbar items, you should write css for that.\n. This problem is known issues. Fixed on https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/a315a53734bbff79822250b81e61678e9ca52361.\n. Hi @olliekav,\nWhat advice should I do about Onsen UI?\nIf you want to add your custom animation, use \"NavigatorView.addTransitionAnimator()\" as the below.\nangular.module('onsen').run(function(NavigatorView, NavigatorTransitionAnimator) {\n  var YourCustomAnimator = NavigatorTransitionAnimator.extend({ ... });\n  NavigatorView.registerTransitionAnimator('custom-slide', new YourCustomAnimator());\n});\n. Question: How do I set up popover's width and height?\n. Merged. Good work!\n. Request: Fix ons-navigator inside ons-dialog that show unneeded status-bar fill padding on cordova+ iOS7. Add \"no-status-bar-fill\" attribute.\nhttp://gyazo.com/c48b1c864817ea3c3dc2fda046cb7507\n. Request: Implement getDeviceBackButtonHandler() method.\n. Merged. Great work!\n. Merged. Great job! \n.

Thanks @zumbrunnen ! I've merged it.\n. @argelius Thanks!\n. Looks good to me!\n\n. Hi @Sakura777,\nTry ng-disabled directive like following code:\n<ons-pull-hook ng-disabled=\"!ons.platform.isIOS()\">\n   ...\n</ons-pull-hook>\n. Hi @Sakura777 ,\nIs this bug report? We use GitHub Issues as bug tracking system not support forum on Onsen UI project.\nYou should post on stackoverflow with \"onsenui\" tag.\n. Hi @d3orn,\nI realized that the error is raised from code that babel generated.\nif (typeof superClass !== 'function' && superClass !== null) {\n        throw new TypeError('Super expression must either be null or a function, not ' + typeof superClass);\n    }\nI wrote some code like the following with es6 class feature.\nclass BottomToolbarElement extends HTMLElement {\n    ...\n  }\nIn safari, HTMLElement is not callable constructor. And babel raise an exception if super class is not a function.\nThanks for your reporting. I'm going to fix this problem.\n. How about introducing \"ons-scope\" attribute?\nIf \"ons-scope\" attribute is presented, the children components is assigned on DOM's scope that have \"ons-scope\" attribute.\n<div ons-scope>\n  <ons-carousel var=\"carousel\">\n    ...\n  </ons-carousel>\n</div>\n. Hi @FragCoder,\nThank you for your reporting.\nWe will fix this problem.\n. @FragCoder \nI tested on Windows Phone 8.1 but can't reproduce. And browser has MutationObserver.\nWhat version of Windows Phone are you using?\n. Hi @wozzup,\nWe are developing Onsen UI for Cordova/PhoneGap app. \nAnd React Native can't run on Cordova.\nThus we will never replace Angular to React Native.\nIf you mean that Onsen UI should be on not only Angular but also React.js, we will examine about it.\n. @argelius Thanks!\n. Question: Page life cycle events can work with ons-split-view or ons-sliding-menu or other components except ons-navigator and ons-tabbar in this implementation?\n. \"hide\" and \"show\" event are not triggered on \"ons-sliding-menu\" or \"ons-split-view\" or using only \"ons-page\"? I think that this behavior confuse and annoy end-developers. I don't want to add this behavior on next release.\n. I cannot prefigure this behavior.  When I read the spec, I think page lifecycle events must be triggered like the diagram below and CSS display property is not related always.\ncreate\n   \u2193\n show\n  \u2191 \u2193\n hide\n   \u2193\n destroy\n. @andipavllo Looks good to me! It's OK.\n. @argelius I initially implemented with removeChild and appendChild instead of innerHTML. But it caused angular directive error on \"demo/navigator\" with iOS and Chrome. Does your implementation work on demo?\n. If there is no problem, your implementation is better.\n. Good! Merged it.\n. Thanks!\n. Ok, I'm going to investigate and fix this issue.\n. Fixed on https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/9476878e0af8d533fd8a9b195b40a86dfbe225a0.\n. @argelius Nice work! Thanks!\n. @frankdiox \nregisterAnimator() is not methods for component object.\nFor instance, OnsNavigatorElement.regsiterAnimator() is available, but $scope.myNavigator.registerAnimator() is not available on the code below.\n<script>\n    angular.module('myApp').controller('AppController', function($scope) {\n      $scope.myNavigator.registerAnimator(); // ???\n    });\n  </script>\n<body ng-controller=\"AppController\">    \n  <ons-navigator var=\"myNavigator\">\n    <ons-page>\n      <ons-toolbar>\n        <div class=\"center\">Navigator</div>\n      </ons-toolbar>\n    </ons-page>\n  </ons-navigator>\nYou should move doc comments for these methods.\n. @frankdiox It's OK to just remove them for now because api-docs generation is not available now on core/elements.\n. @argelius Looks good to me. Just merge it.\n. Question: This ons-fab rendering is affected by ons-navigator's transition animation? \n. I see.\n. Looks good to me.\n. It looks good to me. Great work!\n.

Several yeas ago, I added this line(margin-top: -1px) to fix a display issue on iOS. But I don't remember the details.\nProbably its issue is about 0.5px toolbar border on iOS and this margin fix flickering toolbar's border on animating ons-navigator transition.\nI think it's OK to remove this line if there is no problem on iOS.\n. Fixed on \"fix-905\" branch. This branch is merged on to master branch.\n. Thanks for merge!\n. It's OK.\n. :thumbsup:\n. @andipavllo Thanks for reporting. I will investigate this issues.\n. @andipavllo \n\nVery poor overall performance, laggy animations and interaction (for example during an ons-button click).\n\nI can't get this performance problem on Nexus7 Android 5.1.1. But I removed some possibilities of performance bottleneck for ons-splitter-side's interaction and animation just in case. Can you check for this problem on your android device?\n\nAfter opening an ons-splitter-side it's possible to close it by clicking/touching the external area. This behaviour works fine if just one ons-splitter-side has been set as swipeable but gets randomly bugged when there are two ons-splitter-side elements (always the second toggled element gets bugged, no error messages are displayed).\n\nI fixed.\n\nAn ons-splitter-side element with swipeable and collapse=\"landscape\" attributes gets bugged. The element gets toggled by default in portrait mode and it's not possible to close it anymore (tried with touch action and internal functions). It collapses as it should when the orientation gets changed.\nit's not possible to close it anymore\n\nIn \"portrait\" screen orientation, it should be correct behavior. \"ons-splitter-side\" elements on \"split\" mode should show self always.\n. @andipavllo Thanks for making video. Ok, I continue to improve this performance issue.\n. @andipavllo I optimized ons-splitter-side's animation again on \"fix-915\" branch. Could you confirm the performance again? \n. @andipavllo Please test on \"fix-915\" branch. Yesterday I pushed several commits on \"fix-915\" branch and that all commits is not merged on master branch. \n. @andipavllo Thanks for testing. hmm... I can't figure out why the performance is poor on your android device.\n. :thumbsup:\n. @argelius  Thanks! I can't find any problems so I will merge this.\n. @argelius  Merge this changes if there is no problems.\n. :+1: \n. @argelius It's good! I don't have any objections.\n. It's done.\n. @argelius Thanks. I cant find any problems. Merged.\n. @argelius \nhmm... \"alert-dialog--material-title--one\" class name looks strange.\nCould you fix this naming as you say?\n. Merged.\n. It's looks good to me. :+1: \n. Implemented on https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/937 and merged this changes.\n. @argelius Great work! Thanks!\nMerged.\n. @argelius Good! I can't find any problems. I will merge.\n. @argelius Nice work! I think it's necessary too.\nMerged.\n. @alexeygolev Good! Merged.\n. @argelius Nice work! Merged.\n. @argelius Good! Merged.\n. @argelius Ok! Merged.\n. @argelius Thanks for this report. Ok, I will investigate this problem on next week.\n. @frankdiox @argelius Thanks!\n. I'll fix this issue.\n. I'm going to fix this problem.\n. I have investigated this problem and realized that pure css component can't implements range thumb growing when dragging on Android. \nThere is same problem on MDL's slider components(http://www.getmdl.io/components/#sliders-section).\nThis feature is implemented on Angular Material's \"md-slider\" directive(https://material.angularjs.org/latest/demo/slider) but this is not pure css.\nTo solve this problem, I think we should create custom elements. \nAny thoughts?\n. Ok, Thanks!\n. @frankdiox It should use \"material\" modifier instead of \"android\" modifier(.alert-dialog-*--android) on Onsen UI v2 and android device. In ons-alert-dialog, current implementation add \"android\" modifier automatically. I think ons-alert-dialog and other components(e.g. ons-toolbar) should add \"material\" modifier automatically instead of \"android\" modifier on android device.\n. @argelius I agree your opinion.\nI think var attribute is not necessary on onsenui.js. Because on Onsen UI v2 all components are just DOM elements and basically other frameworks have a its own way to refer DOM elements.\n. I never revive \"var\" attribute on onsenui.js. But I think it's necessary to announce that \"var\" attribute is no longer available for jQuery user.\n. :+1: \nIt's good to have a way to assign popPage() options such as ons-back-button attributes and pushPage() method's options.\n. Could you write proposal spec shortly? When andreas and I agree its proposal, it's OK to implement.\nI personally think it's good to have \"refresh-on-pop\" and \"cancel-if-running\" and \"on-transition-end\" attributes.\n. :+1: \n. @Linko91 thanks for the issue report. We will investigate this problem.\nWhat device are you using?\nDoes the problem occur on this example(http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/VvVaZv)?\n. @frankdiox So could you implements this?\n. Done.\n. :+1: \n. @argelius OK. Thanks!\n. :+1: \n. It's good to have.\n. I think it's OK to have. But I don't know why we should implements auto-grow feature on v2.0. Is this feature so important than other unimplemented material design components? \n. OK. It looks good to me!\n. @argelius :+1: \n. @frankdiox Thanks for this report. \nProbably I had broken something on the navigator's animation. I will fix this problem.\n. @argelius Good!\n. As a result of investigating the example of ons-lazy-repeat(examples/lazy_repeat_element/index.html), the bottleneck seems to be to ons-list-item.\nA case of using 'ons-list-item':\n\nA case of using 'div':\n\nWhen ons-lazy-repeat have simple div elements instead of ons-list-item elements, it's very fast.\n. Closing. Feel free to reopen this issue.\n. @argelius It almost looks good to me.\nThere is only one thing. I think changes of import path is not needed. You should add 'core/src' to module path.\n\n. @argelius It's great! :+1: \n. :+1: \n. Oops, It seems that I have added in progress tag by mistake.\n. Hello @DILEEP-YADAV,\nThank for your reporting, we will investigate this problem.\n\nWhat is the benefit of 2.0 version?\n\nWe are aiming to be the Onsen UI to framework agnostic on 2.0.\nIn 2.0, developers will be able to use favorite framework such like React, Angular2 or jQuery.\n. @philolo1 OK, I will write the doc comment for \"toggle\" method.\n. @argelius I think we should remove DOM tree mutation on only initialization. It's OK that have ons-navigator's pushPage or other methods that mutate DOM.\n. @philolo1 @argelius Oh it's good! But the all attributes is not available when an element is created by document.createElement() and Angular2 use document.createElement().\n. \u3042\u3068\u540d\u524d\u304c\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u826f\u304f\u306a\u3044\u6c17\u304c\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\n'_compiled' is not good name in this use case.\n. @frankdiox '_compiled' attribute is not available on using createElement(). And what was worse, Angular2 set all attributes after an element is attached.\nRelated: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/1261\n. :+1: \n. > I also removed the _compiled attribute.\nOK. Thanks! \n. I looked this changes but I don't want to merge. \nHonestly I can't understand why this refactored code is better than past code.\nI think that it become unnecessarily complicated and lower maintenancebility.\n@argelius What do you think about this changes?\n. @frankdiox I'm OK that we create simple animation utility that make animation easily. But I don't think that current animator architecture has big problem.\n. Looks good to me. :+1:\n. \ud83d\udc4d \nI like 2 and dislike 3.\n. @fran I'm sure that this is not about fixing a bug. This is a thing to animate toolbars that have different background colors.\n. @fran Probably it was broken in someday. If your changes fixed, that would be nice.\n. @argelius OK. I updated related code on ons-pull-hook and it works now. \n. @argelius What about setting a page loader that do nothing?\nonsTab.pageLoader = new ons.PageLoader(({page, parent}, done) => {\n  done({element: document.createElement('div'), unload: () => {}});\n});\n. hmm...\nDo you set \"page\" attribute on ons-tab? \nI think you should not page attribute or property because it cause page-loader's load.\n. @argelius Supporting <ons-tab> without page attribute is OK to me. \u554f\u984c\u7121\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\n. > I think creating the page element and attaching it to the DOM should be separated in two different steps.\nI agree your opinion, but it is simply impossible in Angular2. I struggled to just create element that bound Angular2 component without attaching but I could not find the way a few months ago. I think we should fix this problem in other ways.\n. @frankdiox I think replacing should be in defaultPageLoader. How about the following code?\n```\n// Default implementation for global PageLoader.\nfunction loadPage({page, parent, params = {}, replace = false}, done) {\n  internal.getPageHTMLAsync(page).then(html => {\nif (replace) {\n  util.propagateAction(parent, '_destroy');\n  parent.innerHTML = '';\n} \nconst element = util.createElement(html.trim());\nparent.appendChild(element);\n\ndone({\n  element: element,\n  unload: () => element.remove()\n});\n\n});\n}\n``\n. It's OK to me.\n. I already removed doc comments ofpushComponent()andpopComponent(). Probably it is website issue. @argelius @frankdiox Could you check that?\n. @IliaSky Thank you for reporting. Ok, I will investigate this problem.\n. Yes, this problem can't be reproduced in current master branch.\n. It looks no problems to me.\n. this._decompose(enterPage)\u3060\u3051\u3092\u9045\u5ef6\u3055\u305b\u308b\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3001\u305d\u308c\u4ee5\u964d\u306e\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u5168\u90e8\u9045\u5ef6\u3055\u305b\u306a\u3044\u3068\u58ca\u308c\u305d\u3046\u306a\u6c17\u304c\u3059\u308b\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304c\u305d\u308c\u306f\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u306a\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304b? \n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. @frankdiox Thanks for the feedback.

However user developers may think Onsen UI is just broken when seeons-navigatorexample. Also it should be fixed.\n. @argelius I had a mistake. Examples does not loadedcordova.jsand the status bar filling is fixed after adding script tag to loadcorodva.js. \nNext I will fixons-navigatorexample issue.\n. I just fixedons-navigator` example issue on this commit: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/b2ff3c71298e7392c691554d670079e05b5a3158\n. @fran It looks good to me. Thanks!\n\nAs a side idea, perhaps we can create ons.createElement('content') that internally calls:\nlet el = document.createElement('ons-element')\nel.setAttribute( -attributes- );\ninnerHTML(el, content)\ncontentReady(el);\n\nGood idea.  You should implement this.\n. Oh that's right :sweat: Let's leave it as it is on createElement.\n. Documentation, tutorials and kitchen sink is updated now.\n. @frankdiox Tanaka-san said to use codepen until interactive tutorials are ready.\n. @frankdiox Oh, I see. I thought that tutorials is not ready because some tutorials have no tutorial contents. \n@argelius Sorry, would you revert this pull-request changes?\n. @argelius arigato!\n. I investigated and realized that this is webpack issue: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2945.\n\nWorkaround: export const __esModule = true; in entry module.\n\nI putted this line in angular2-onsenui.ts and it works on AoT compilation. I will create pull-request that fix this issue.\n. This is not webpack issue. It was my misunderstanding. I'm still investigating what cause this problem.\n. Fixed in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/1626.\n. @fran What you're saying is reasonable. Let me think about it for a while.\n. @killzoner Great! Thanks for creating this pull-request!\n. @argelius It's OK to make deprecated. \n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Looks good to me \ud83d\udc4d \n. @fran It should be OK.\n. @vjoomens @argelius Ok, I'm going to fix this problem.\n. @frankdiox Nice work!\n\n@anatoo Is there any way to get pageComponentRef just from a DOM element? Looks like before there was AppViewManager to do this but it was removed after beta.16. \n\nI investigated the way previously but probably there is nothing.\n\nI'm just temporarily saving pageComponentRef within the element in order to destroy it afterwards.\n\nI think we should use WeakSet instead of saving directly within element.\n. Oh, my bad. I mean WeakMap not WeakSet.\nIt should be fine to use WeakMap in TypeScript because there is WeakMap type declaration  in bindings/angular2/typings/globals/es6-shim/index.d.ts.\n. @claudioc Sorry, I just mistook issue number. That commit(66eeb48) fix #1654 not this issue.\n. I will close this pull-request because I merged vue2 branch to master branch.. @asial-matagawa \n\u30b0\u30c3\u30b8\u30e7\u30d6\u3067\u3059\uff01\nif (['local_chrome'].indexOf(window.browser) != -1)\n\u4e00\u70b9\u3060\u3051\u305f\u3060\u306e\u898b\u6804\u3048\u306e\u8a71\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u3053\u306e\u66f8\u304d\u65b9\u3063\u3066\u3082\u3046\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u5225\u306e\u66f8\u304d\u65b9\u306b\u3067\u304d\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304b? \n\u9577\u3005\u3057\u3044\u306e\u3068\u30d6\u30e9\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u3084\u30a4\u30f3\u30c7\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u7121\u3044\u306e\u3082\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002. \ud83d\udc4d \n\u81ea\u5206\u3082\u305d\u308c\u304c\u3044\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059. This is not bug and correct behavior. Because Angular 2 set my-class value to class attribute after creating <ons-button> element and add \"button\" to classList property.\nWe must change spec of \"class\" attribute behavior to fix this problem.. @argelius @asial-matagawa Could you merge this changes if there is no problem?. @wahid Thanks for reporting. I will investigate this problem.. @argelius Thanks! I will fix this problem.. I agree with you. I'll update peerDependencies.. @asial-matagawa Thanks! I will investigate this problem.. @nodefish Thanks for reporting. It seems that FastClick occur this behavior. We will fix the problem.. @corneyl Thanks for reporting. Okay, we will try to fix this problem.. @frankdiox I read all your changes and tried lazy-repeat examples on several browsers. It looks good approach to me. Great work! \nJust one thing,  I thought the scrolling performance is a bit poor when I tried on mobile Safari. So I profiled on chrome devtools and it seems that some forced layouts cause this problem. \n\nCould you try to improve scroll performance on lazy-repeat?. @frankdiox I checked on mobile Safari and it seems that the scroll performance is improved. Good!\nBut the lazy-repeat behavior is still unstable on Safari and mobile Safari. I recorded that on webm: lazy-repeat.webm.zip.\nCould you try to fix this unstable behavior?. @frankdiox OK.. @frankdiox Great work! I will merge this changes.. @aahmyu Thanks for reporting. But I don't intend to investigate this problem because it seems to be intel xdk problem not Onsen UI. If the debugger fail for some application code, it's debugger's bug.. @airamrguez Thanks for reporting!  We will fix this problem.. @taku845 I tried \"fade\" animation but it works. Could you provide actual code that reproduce this problem?. @sylvain-hamel Thanks for reporting. We will investigate this problem.. @sylvain-hamel Oh sorry for delay, I'm going to fix this problem.. Fixed.. Closing this issue. If you have questions about Onsen UI, you should visit https://community.onsen.io or https://stackoverflow.com/tags/onsen-ui.. @zinner Thanks for reporting. I will investigate this problem.. @zmkn Do you import OnsenModule? It seems that your code does not include OnsenModule importing.. Ok, could you share whole code not screenshots that reproduce your problem?. @zmkn Thanks! We will investigate this problem.. Hi @ivaylopivanov, what do you mean bylazy loading? Do you want to load lazily onsenui.js or Angular 2 framework or both?. Oh, I see. \n\nAny suggestions on how to accomplish the lazy loading and the menu in more elegant way?\n\nSorry, I have no idea for that. Currently we have no plans to support lazy modules because Onsen UI is built for Cordova apps.. @ivaylopivanov I closed it because I can not just help you about how to implement lazy modules. if you are doing feature request, you can reopen this issue.. @18601673727 Thanks for reporting, could you provide reproducible whole code that include related code for react-router?. keepPage options is removed on v2.. @sukima Oh that's right, currently ons-input doesn't handle some dynamic attributes. So it's just ons-input's problem not contentReady or setImmediate problem.. @frankdiox Thanks. Nice work!. \n. @misterjunio It's OK. I will port these stylus variables to less components.

Hi @botezatpv, thanks for reporting. Could you provide actual code that reproduce this problem on this sandbox? \n. @puku0x Thanks! I will review this PR.. @frandiox I think it's fine to use absolute.. @asial-matagawa It seem to be broken. I will take a look.. @puku0x @asial-matagawa This is expected appearance. ons-list-header is originally implemented as a list category header.\nIn 2.0.x, ons-list-header is suddenly changed by other developers, so I just restored to original appearance in 2.2.0.. @puku0x Sorry for the delayed response because I am part-time developer for Onsen UI.\n\nIf you have time, could you consider providing both styles of header ? (Like Ionic's ion-list-header and ion-item-divider, for instance)\n\nOk, it's should be fine. I will propose new components for that to Onsen UI team.. @airamrguez Sorry for the delay. Thanks!\n@frandiox @misterjunio @asial-matagawa This changes seems to be fine. I will merge this changes to master branch. Let me know if there is a problem.. @frandiox Yes, it should be outside ons-list. . @frandiox \nI have an opinion about the method name.\nI think we should prefer ons.openActionSheet() or ons.createActionSheet() not ons.actionSheet() because actionSheet isn't a verb unlike confirm and alert and prompt.. @frandiox \n\nI think ons.createActionSheet could be confusing because we are using ons.createDialog, ons.createAlertDialog and ons.createPopover for something different. \n\nCertainly. Then I prefer ons.openActionSheet(). ons.actionSheet() seems to be inconsistent because we are already using verb for naming method like createDialog().. @frandiox I don't know why but I will investigate this problem at tomorrow or next week.. @misterjunio Thanks!. @frandiox \n\nPreset modifiers: success, warning, error, info, etc. (changing background and text color). @anatoo What do you think about providing these modifiers?\n\nIt should be OK to have. But they are not absolutely necessary at now. I prefer to have no preset modifiers at the start.. @asial-matagawa What's the problem? Please tell me more.. @asial-matagawa I fixed on #1999.. How about using native solutions?  For instance, we can use touch-action: manipulation. \nIt should be OK for newer versions of Android and iOS.. For older versions, we can use FastClick as before.. I investigated about this problem and touch-action: manipulation and so on.\nAndroid\nIn Android4.4+ WebView and browser, we can remove click delay by setting viewport properly(user-scalable=no,width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1). It's the same on newer versions.\nSo we can drop FastClick and it does not needed touch-action CSS property in Android platform.\niOS\ntouch-action is introduced in iOS9.3. In iOS, things are a bit complicated.\n\nUIWebView: UIWebView on iOS11 can parse touch-action CSS property, but that has no effect. Viewport settings also have no effect. So we have to use FastClick always on UIWebView. \nWKWebView: We can use touch-action: manipulation or viewport settings if it's supported. Otherwise we have to use FastClick.\nSafari: We can use touch-action: manipulation if it's supported. Otherwise we have to use FastClick.\niOS9.3: But if the web page is launched from the home screen and have <meta name=\"apple-mobile-web-app-capable\" content=\"yes\">, the page is loaded by UIWebView and touch-action: manipulation and viewport settings to remove click delay has no effect. So we have to use FastClick in this case.\n\nConclusion\nIn most cases, we can use touch-action: manipulation and viewport settings to remove click delay.\nOn Android, it's OK to set viewport correctly. On iOS, we can use touch-action: manipulation and viewport settings that remove click delay if it's supported. But on UIWebView, we have to use FastClick as before.\n@asial-matagawa @frandiox How do you think? If there are no problems, I will try to implement these logic.\n. Ok I will create pull-request that fix this problems.\n@asial-matagawa FYI: By the way, if FastClick cause a trouble in some cases, I think there is no needs to use fastClick.destroy(). You can just add needsclick to class attribute on the target element that have troubles. needsclick value disable FastClick on the target element. \nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/core/src/vendor/FastClick%401.0.6%2Bmod/fastclick.js#L253. @asial-matagawa Oh... \ud83d\ude07. @misterjunio  In that type=file or type=image cases, can it be just input elements instead of ons-input?. I can't reproduce this problem on my environment.\n@asial-matagawa Could you fix demo link?. OK. But it seem to be fine.\n\nMy safari version: 10.1 (12603.1.30.0.34). @asial-matagawa Thanks!. @Leva7 Thanks for the reporting. We will fix this problem.. @frandiox Got it. It should be OK.. I prefer (1) @frandiox 's suggestion.. @misterjunio Thanks! I merged.. @frandiox It's OK to me.. \ud83d\udc4d . @asial-matagawa I referred iOS 10.3.2 and Android 6.0.1.  OK, I'm going to adjust again.. I have no objection.. @frandiox Good work!\n\nDo you remember what is the margin-top: -1px for exactly?\n\nIn days of old, I added this line for appearances of ons-toolbar on running iOS \"slide\" animation. But I forgot about the details. It's OK to remove if you confirm the animation is fine.. @frandiox Oh sorry, I just made a mistake. I removed that css.. @frandiox If you say about ons-range or ons-checkbox or ons-radio-button, No. These components have effects on :focus and :active.\n\nhttps://material.io/guidelines/components/selection-controls.html#selection-controls-checkbox\n. I think It's weird a little. But I would like to add ripple effects on focus for now.\nIf many users complain this behavior after this feature is released, I will make a plan.. @frandiox Ok, I'm going to fix.. @frandiox \n\nif you tap the track on iOS (tested v10.3.2) the range won't update its value.\n\nDo you think that range's value should be updated when you tap the track in iOS?\nI tested default <input type=\"range\"> in iOS, but range's value doesn't be updated on tap the track. . @frandiox I see. I confirmed that native slider UI doesn't update itself on tap the track, so I intent to fix the Android issue when have a time.. @misterjunio Ok, I will take a look today.. @misterjunio I had take a look while ago, but I also can't get why. So I added dirty fix.. @frandiox No and not planned. This previewer already has CSS live inject on changing css files. So I think that isn't needed.. @frandiox Ok, I will take a look.. @asial-matagawa Oh sorry, I fixed.. @frandiox Yes, it's OK.. @jalkoby Thanks! Merged.. >Suppress auto status bar fill for iPhone X\n\nStatus bar is replaced with top safe area in iPhone X.\nWe have to suppress auto status bar fill running on iPhone X.\n\nDo you say about mock status bar? I think status bar fill is needed for top padding on iPhone X.. @frandiox @sbaechler Ok, I will make easier to override these css properties.. @asial-matagawa @frandiox What's going on?. > var el;\nThis line is needed?\n. You should not put internal utility methods on this \"ons\" object.\nBecause \"ons\" global object is facade for end user.\nMove this methods to \"$ons\" object. See this file: framework/services/onsen.js\n. In this time, ons-page may not be attached on DOM tree.\nFire init event at the same timing with fireActualPageInitEvent().\nSee details: https://github.com/argelius/OnsenUI/blob/master/framework/directives/page.js#L74\n.

I've added a simple (and maybe ugly) ability to cache pages in Sliding Menu, by adding the code below to scope.ons.slidingMenu.setAbovePage:\n``` javascript\n  scope.ons.slidingMenu.setAbovePage = function (pageUrl) {\n              if (this.currentPageUrl === pageUrl) {\n                // same page -> ignore\n                return;\n              }\n          if (pageUrl) {\n\n            var cachedPage = this.cachedPages[pageUrl];\n            if (!cachedPage) {\n\n              $http({\n                url: pageUrl,\n                method: \"GET\"\n              }).error(function (e) {\n                    console.error(e);\n                  }).success(function (data, status, headers, config) {\n\n                    var templateHTML = angular.element(data.trim());\n                    var pageElement = angular.element('<div></div>');\n                    pageElement.addClass('page');\n                    pageElement[0].style.opacity = 0;\n                    var pageContent = $compile(templateHTML)(scope);\n                    pageElement.append(pageContent);\n                    this.$abovePage.append(pageElement);\n\n                    this.cachedPages[config.url] = pageElement;\n                    // prevent black flash\n                    setTimeout(function () {\n                      pageElement[0].style.opacity = 1;\n                      if (this.currentPageElement) {\n                      //  this.currentPageElement.remove();\n                        this.currentPageElement.addClass('hiddenView');\n                      }\n                      this.currentPageElement = pageElement;\n                    }.bind(this), 0);\n\n                    this.currentPageUrl = pageUrl;\n                  }.bind(this));\n\n            } else {\n\n      // We opt for the cached version of the page\n      //        this.$abovePage.append(cachedPage);\n              cachedPage.removeClass('hiddenView');\n\n\n              setTimeout(function () {\n                cachedPage[0].style.opacity = 1;\n\n                if (this.currentPageElement) {\n                  //this.currentPageElement.remove();\n                  this.currentPageElement.addClass('hiddenView');\n\n                }\n                this.currentPageElement = cachedPage;\n              }.bind(this), 0);\n\n              this.currentPageUrl = pageUrl;\n\n\n            }\n          } else {\n            throw new Error('cannot set undefined page');\n          }\n        }.bind(this);\n\n```\ncss\ncss\n.hiddenView {\n    display: none;\n}\nI'm not removing the page from the dom, but instead hiding it. If the page is removed (instead of hidden), attached bindings stop working (for example, if the page has an ons-navigator-toolbar, click on buttons will not work if you open a cached page). \nThe dom gets bigger, but on the other hand, we just want to cache pages to where we navigate often, so there's a perceived performance increase.\n. Hey @kruyvanna , I guess you'll like this: our app built with OnsenUI is now available in App Store and Google Play:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/en/app/boonzi-personal-finance/id808920979\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boonzi.mobile\nThe fix I proposed in this issue is working just fine in this app, along with the changes you did in the navigation branch. :)\n. Hey @kruyvanna, sorry for the late answer.\nWe're spamming this Github issue - here goes my email: joao [dot] saleiro [at] webfuel [dot] pt \n:)\nDrop me an email, I'll be glad to provide any info you need !\n. Actually, this seems to be a characteristic of Angular Directives when transcluding automatically (transclude: true). So I would advise warning about this on the docs, and proposing a recommended approach.\n. By the way, my second option doesn't work as expected. If you use\nhtml\n<ons-page > \n<div ng-controller=\"MyCtrl\">\n</div>\n</ons-page>\nwhen the inner div is transcluded, the scope of MyCtrl is not immediately applied.\n. This also applies to other components, being the ons-navigator the most problematic one.\nImagine the following case with a ons-navigator:\n``` html\n\n</ons-navigator>\n\n```\ndecideTheAction() is a method in a Controller. For decideTheAction to exist, since it can't be set in ons-navigator directly, it needs to be in a div before the ons-navigator. Unfortunately, in that case the controller won't be able to access \"$scope.ons.navigator\".\nSo, the current approach makes it a bit harder to implement more complex navigations. \nA workaround (for this specific case) could be something like: \non-left-button-click=\"ons.navigator.pushPage(getThePageURL())\"\n. This is actually becoming quite problematic, and making me reconsider onsenUI. \nImagine, for example, the following use case:\nhtml\n<body ng-controller=\"AppCtrl\">\n    <ons-screen page=\"connected.html\"></ons-screen>\n</body>\nAppCtrl needs to perform some logic to decide what to show to the user at start. The problem is that AppCtrl doesn't have access to ons.screen , so it cannot call, for example, presentPage.\nThis could be solved if one could do:\nhtml\n<body ng-controller=\"AppCtrl\">\n    <ons-screen page=\"connected.html\" ng-controller=\"MyScreenCtrl\"></ons-screen>\n</body>\nThen, both controllers could talk, and MyScreenCtrl would have access to ons.screen .\nSo far, I haven't yet found an easy and clean solution for this.\nThe dirty hack, for now, consists in putting  the following code in the link() function of onsScreen directive:\nscope.$parent.ons = scope.ons;\n. That was my first try, but it didn't (and doesn't work), because initial_page.html doesn't have access to the AppCtrl scope! See below:\nindex.html\nhtml\n<body ng-controller=\"AppCtrl\">\n    <ons-screen page=\"start.html\"></ons-screen>\n</body>\nAppCtrl.html\nhtml\nmyApp.controller('AppCtrl', function ($scope) {\n  $scope.myVar = \"Test\";\n});\nstart.html\nhtml\n<div style=\"color: #ffffff\">    \n    {{myVar}}\n</div>\nstart.html should show \"Test\". But it's empty. \nIf I debug it with the console, doing a:\nangular.element($0).scope();\nwhile having the div in start.html selected, the scope() that appears doesn't have myVar.\nUsing AngularJS extension for chrome, I can see that I have three scopes. start.html has it's own scope, that is created by ons-screen. That scope is not inheriting from AppCtrl.\nAlso, the generated HTML shows a class=\"ng-isolate-scope\" in < ons-screen >.\nI was using AngularJS 1.2.12 and switched to the 1.2.10 bundled with onsen just to check. The issue maintains.\nI don't see anything wrong with my code: it's simply that elements generated after a directive get their own scope, without inheritance to the previous scope.\n. It's weird that your code works, since the ons-screen directive has it's own scope, and has transclude false. When this happens, the supposed behavior is:\n\"scope: { ... } - the directive creates a new isolate/isolated scope. It does not prototypically inherit the parent scope.  \"\nSee more at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17900201/how-to-access-parent-scope-from-within-a-custom-directive-with-own-scope-in-an\nAnd here's the contents of the directive:\n``` javascript\ndirectives.directive('onsScreen', function(ONSEN_CONSTANTS, $http, $compile) {\n    return {\n        restrict: 'E',\n        replace: false,\n        transclude: false,\n        scope: {\n            page: '@'\n        },\n\n```\nThis leads into my current issue with Onsen that is making it hard to architect a simple app with a somewhat complex navigation.\n. I confirm the branch works fine for this test case.\nIn start.html I get \"Test\", so it's binding correctly. Nicely done :)\nWill this be merged?\n. Great! :+1: \nI'm doing some tests with the changes you did in the screen_scope branch. \n\"ons\" is now available in the $parent scope, but there's a little catch.\nIf you call ons.screen.presentPage on the parent scope immediately, an error will happen. This is because compilation and linking is not immediate. To fix it, calls to \"presentPage\" need to be wrapped in a $timeout 0, to ensure that the call is run on the next cycle.\nNot working:\njavascript\nb.controller('AppCtrl', function ($scope) {\n  $scope.ons.screen.presentPage('start_welcome.html');\n}\nWorking:\njavascript\nb.controller('AppCtrl', function ($scope, $timeout) {\n  $timeout(function () {\n    $scope.ons.screen.presentPage('start_welcome.html');\n  }, 0);\n}\nOn a side note, I want to say thank you not only for your great work, but also for being on top of these issues. :)\n. onsNavigator still has this issue, since it's scope is not compiled with it's parent scope:\nonsNavigator (not working):\nlink: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n                            [...]\n            scope.ons = scope.ons || {};\n            scope.ons.navigator = scope.ons.navigator || {};\nonsScreen (working):\nlink: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n            var screenItems = [];\n            scope.$parent.ons = scope.$parent.ons || {};\n            scope.$parent.ons.screen = scope.$parent.ons.screen || {};\n. Now that you ask, it would probably be hard to implement in the way I suggested because it would lead to a race condition hard do solve.\nAn alternative could be to use just one property (page) that could receive either a string (a pageURL) or an object (with properties explaining how to show the page).  Example:\nHTML\n<ons-screen page=\"{{page}}\"></ons-screen>\nJavascript to show a new page using default method (resetToPage):\napp.controller('AppCtrl', function($scope) {\n    $scope.navigate = function() {\n         $scope.page = 'myPage.html'\n      }  \n});\nJavascript to show a new page using push:\napp.controller('AppCtrl', function($scope) {\n    $scope.navigate = function() {\n            $scope.page = {url: 'myPage.html', method: 'push'};\n      }  \n});\nJavascript to pop/dismiss page:\napp.controller('AppCtrl', function($scope) {\n    $scope.navigate = function() {\n           $scope.page = {method: 'pop'};\n      }  \n});\nAnd so one. The object could be extended to receive, for example a \"transition\" property.\nIf all navigators can simply bind to properties, then a centralized NavigationService would take care of the full application state without knowing about and needing instances of ons.navigators .\nBTW, I saw that on the onseenui-screen branch you added watchers for the page in the onsScreen, which I'm already using in the current project. Such a simple change, and it simplified so much the navigation architecture.\n. Great work!\nI'm already trying the navigation_binding branch, and here's a small issue: now page expects an object. So the below code won't work:\n<ons-navigator\n        left-button-icon=\"fa fa-bars\"          \n        right-button-icon=\"fa fa-lg fa-plus\"\n        page=\"page1.html\">\n</ons-navigator>\nTo make it work, it needs a change from page=\"page1.html\" to page=\" 'page1.html' \". \nWhile I prefer it to expect an object so it can bind to a model, it breaks compatibility with previous approach.\n. I've refactored my existing code to use the navigation_binding branch.\nIt looks really amazing so far, with better separation of concerns.\nSo far, apart from the previous issue, I've found just one issue:\nChanges to page are not applied immediately. By some reason, I need to call $scope.$apply() for it to work. I'm not sure if this is an issue, or something in my code. But my code is a pretty simple controller, with one method described below and one object\n``` javascript\n// ons-navigator is binded to $scope.page, and $scope.pages is a list of page definitions\n  $scope.openAdd = function () {\n    $scope.page = $scope.pages.add;\n    $scope.$apply();\n  }\n```\n. Btw, here's how my code looks now (simplified example). I really, really like this approach.\nSo far, I have the Navigation logic inside a Controller, but I'll later refactor it to one (or several) centralized Service(s), that will take care of making navigation decisions for all navigators.\n``` javascript\nb.controller('NavigatorCtrl', function ($scope, $timeout) {\n$scope.pages = {\n    list: {\n      url: 'list.html',\n      method: 'push',\n      options: {\n        title: 'Page1',\n        leftButtonIcon: \"fa fa-bars\",\n        rightButtonIcon: \"fa fa-lg fa-plus\",\n        onRightButtonClick: \"openAdd()\"\n      }\n    },\n    add: {\n      url: 'add.html',\n      method: 'push',\n      options: {\n        title: 'Add',\n        leftButtonIcon: \"fa fa-bars\",\n        onLeftButtonClick: \"goback()\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n$scope.page = $scope.pages.list;\n$scope.openAdd = function () {\n    $scope.page = $scope.pages.add;\n    $scope.$apply();\n  }\n$scope.goback = function () {\n$scope.list.method = \"pop\";\n$scope.page = $scope.pages.list;\n// One could simply do $scope.page = { method: 'pop'}; , but I want my $scope.page object to be as close to reality as possible\n\n$scope.$apply();\n\n}\n});\n```\nThe only thing I'm not 100% comfortable with, is what happens to $scope.page object after a pop (see my comment in the code). A way to workaround it, would be to change ons-navigator to expect an object with a slightly more complex format:\njavascript\n    $scope.page: {\n      method: 'pop',\n      page: {\n          url: 'add.html',\n          options: {\n              title: 'Add',\n              leftButtonIcon: \"fa fa-bars\",\n              onLeftButtonClick: \"goback()\"\n       }\n     }\nThis way I could have a \"pages\" object with the definition for all pages, that is not dependent to the \"method\". \nThe above controller would change to:\njavascript\n $scope.goback = function () {\n    $scope.page = {method: \"pop\", $scope.pages.list}\n}\n. Here's another issue: with this syntax, the options.onRightButtonClick should expect a reference to a function and not a String. In other words:\nInstead of:\nonRightButtonClick: \"openAdd()\"\nwe should have:\nonRightButtonClick: openAdd\n. I have made a small change to  onRightButtonClicked and onLeftButtonClicked to add support for functions (instead of strings) inside the right/left button click callback.\nHere's the final function:\n``` javascript\n         onLeftButtonClicked: function () {\n            console.log('left button clicked');\n            var onLeftButtonClick = this.getCurrentNavigatorItem().options.onLeftButtonClick;\n        if (onLeftButtonClick) {\n\n          // These two lines are new. If we have a function, we simply call it instead of parsing it\n          if (onLeftButtonClick && {}.toString.call(onLeftButtonClick) === '[object Function]') {\n            onLeftButtonClick();\n\n\n          } else {\n\n            var onLeftButtonClickFn = $parse(onLeftButtonClick);\n            if (onLeftButtonClick.indexOf('ons.navigator.') >= 0) {\n              onLeftButtonClickFn(scope);\n            } else {\n              onLeftButtonClickFn(scope.$parent);\n            }\n          }\n        } else {\n          if (this.canPopPage()) {\n            scope.ons.navigator.popPage();\n          }\n        }\n      },\n\n```\nThis change improves greatly the flexibility of ons-navigator. Now, instead of using:\njavascript\n  add: {\n      url: 'page1.html',\n      method: 'push',\n      options: {\n        onLeftButtonClick: \"goback()\"\n      }\n    }\nwe can now use:\njavascript\n  add: {\n      url: 'page1.html',\n      method: 'push',\n      options: {\n        onLeftButtonClick: goback\n      }\n    }\nThe difference, is that for the first case ons-navigator will look for goback() inside the controller that holds ons-navigator. In the second case, goback() can be defined anywhere. Thanks to this, now it's pretty simply to write a Service that takes care of all navigation, and can be injected anywhere. Other Controllers don't need to know or access the navigator. \nI'll paste here a sample of my Service when it's finished.\n. In the changes I made above to ons-navigator, it's missing a scope.$apply() after the onLeftButtonClick().\nSo:\nif (onLeftButtonClick && {}.toString.call(onLeftButtonClick) === '[object Function]') {\n              onLeftButtonClick();\n              scope.$apply()\n}\n. As promised, here's how I'm coding my NavigationService. It looks really great, since I can inject the service anywhere, and easily manage navigation. \nNavigationService.js\n``` javascript\napp.service('NavigationService', function ($translate) {\nvar $public = this;\n$public.openAdd = function () {\n    previousPage = $public.page;\n    $public.page = pages.add;\n  }\n$public.goback = function () {\n    if (previousPage) {\n      previousPage.method = 'pop';\n      $public.page = previousPage;\n    }\n  }\nthis.openMenu = function () {\n    // TODO: I still have to find a way to fix this, since in this service we don't have a reference to the slidingMenu. Maybe the slidingMenu should also expose a bindable property for the state of the menu\n    //ons.slidingMenu.toggleMenu();\n  }\npages = {\n    list: {\n      url: 'transactions_list.html',\n      method: 'push',\n      options: {\n        title: $translate('TRANSACTIONS'),\n        leftButtonIcon: \"fa fa-bars\",\n        rightButtonIcon: \"fa fa-lg fa-plus\",\n        onRightButtonClick: $public.openAdd,\n        onLeftButtonClick: $public.openMenu\n      }\n    },\n    add: {\n      url: 'transactions_add.html',\n      method: 'push',\n      options: {\n        title: $translate('NEW_TRANSACTION'),\n        onLeftButtonClick: $public.goback\n      }\n    },\n    chooseBankAccount: {\n      url: 'transactions_add_chooseBankAccount.html',\n      method: 'push',\n      options: {\n        title: $translate('SELECT_ACCOUNT'),\n        onLeftButtonClick: $public.goback\n      }\n    }\n  }\nvar previousPage = null;\n  $public.page = pages.list;\n});\n```\nNavigator1.html\n``` html\n\n\n```\nNavigatorCtrl.js\njavascript\napp.controller('NavigatorCtrl', function ($scope, NavigationService) {\n  $scope.NavigationService = NavigationService;\n});\nIf at any moment I need, for example, to navigate to the add page I simply:\n1- Inject the NavigationService\n2- Call NavigationService.openAdd()\nI can easily extend the logic of the NavigationService to evaluate stuff, intercept navigation, etc.\nAnd so on :)\nThanks for all the work put in onseenui. I hope this approach is applied to the rest of the components, so they can all bind to properties and react to Model changes.\n. @kruyvanna , about the pull requests: Github is completely new to me and I have a tight deadline for the current project that needs to be closed in a couple of days. Yes, I'm going full on with the onsenui-branch in a project that will enter soon in production :o) \nWhen this project is finished I'll dig a bit on Github and learn how to do pull requests, to simplify contributions. In the meantime hope you don't mind if I keep making suggestions using the comments in issues :)\n. For reference purposes, my NavigationService had an issue: for a page stack bigger than two pages, it was not going back. So here's the change I did. \nThis is not that important for onsenui, but in case someone wants to follow my approach, here's my code:\n``` javascript\napp.service('NavigationService', function ($translate) {\nvar $public = this;\n$public.openAdd = function () {\n    push(pages.add);\n  }\n$public.openSelectAccount = function () {\n    push(pages.selectAccount);\n  }\nfunction push(page) {\n    page.method = 'push';\n    $public.page = page;\n    pageStack.push(page);\n  }\n$public.pop = function () {\n    // Cannot pop the first page\n    if (pageStack.length < 2)\n      return;\npageStack.pop();\nvar prevPage = pageStack[pageStack.length - 1];\nprevPage.method = 'pop';\n$public.page = prevPage;\n\n}\nthis.openMenu = function () {\n    // TODO: I still have to find a way to fix this, since in this service we don't have a reference to the slidingMenu. Maybe the slidingMenu should also expose\n    // a bindable property for toggling ???\n    //ons.slidingMenu.toggleMenu();\n  }\nvar pages = {\n    list: {\n      url: 'transactions_list.html',\n      method: 'push',\n      options: {\n        title: $translate('TRANSACTIONS'),\n        leftButtonIcon: \"fa fa-bars\",\n        rightButtonIcon: \"fa fa-lg fa-plus\",\n        onRightButtonClick: $public.openAdd,\n        onLeftButtonClick: $public.openMenu\n      }\n    },\n    add: {\n      url: 'transactions_add.html',\n      method: 'push',\n      options: {\n        title: $translate('NEW_TRANSACTION'),\n        onLeftButtonClick: $public.pop\n      }\n    },\n    selectAccount: {\n      url: 'transactions_account_select.html',\n      method: 'push',\n      options: {\n        title: $translate('SELECT_ACCOUNT'),\n        onLeftButtonClick: $public.pop\n      }\n    }\n  }\n$public.page = pages.list;\n  var pageStack = [$public.page];\n});\n```\n.

    "argelius": "Works.\n. @111crb111 \nYou can describe the states and how to transition with ui-router. Onsen UI doesn't use URL routing but navigates from one page to another programmatically using the custom elements. \nI made a simple example using <ons-navigator> but you can extend this to use <ons-sliding-menu>, <ons-tabbar> or any combination of them.\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/WveKKO\nI use the onEnter() and onExit() methods to define the state transitions:\n``` javascript\nons.bootstrap(['ui.router']).config(function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {\n  $urlRouterProvider.otherwise(\"/page1\");\n$stateProvider\n  .state('page1', {\n    url: \"/page1\"\n  })\n  .state('page2', {\n    parent: 'page1',\n    onEnter: function($rootScope) {\n      $rootScope.navi.pushPage('page2.html');\n    },\n    onExit: function($rootScope) {\n        $rootScope.navi.popPage();\n    }\n  })\n  .state('page3', {\n    parent: 'page2',\n    onEnter: function($rootScope) {\n      $rootScope.navi.pushPage('page3.html');\n    },\n    onExit: function($rootScope) {\n      $rootScope.navi.popPage();\n    }\n  })\n});\n```\nThis will set up the finite state machine so we can now use ui-sref links in our view:\n``` html\n\n\n\nSimple Navigation\n\n\n\n\n        Push Page\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 2\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n  <br />\n  <ons-button modifier=\"light\" ui-sref=\"page3\">\n    Push Page\n  </ons-button>\n  <ons-button modifier=\"light\" ui-sref=\"^\">\n    Pop Page\n  </ons-button>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 3\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n  <br />\n  <ons-button modifier=\"light\" ui-sref=\"^\">\n    Pop Page\n  </ons-button>\n  <ons-button modifier=\"light\" ui-sref=\"page1\">\n    Back to top\n  </ons-button>\n</div>\n\n\n\n``\n. Great! I'm actually thinking about adding native support forui-router. We can't usengRoutebecause it only works will URLs butui-router` is perfect since we can define state transitions.\nI'll also investigate the new router but I think the ui-router is enough for our needs.\n. @byhoratiss You can do something similar to what I did with navigator and define the state transitions with the slidingMenu.setMainPage() method.\nThere is no builtin integration between the sliding menu and the router right now but we will add it in an upcoming version. \n.

Great!\nActually I think you can remove the setImmediate() call and just use setTimeout.\nYeah, there will be some graphical glitches with some Android devices. Even if we test with one Android 4.4 device, other devices might have different behavior even if it's the same Android version since they have different hardware and the maker might do some changes as well.\n. Thanks for pointing this out!\nWe will fix it in the upcoming release.\nIn the meantime you can add the following CSS rule:\ncss\n.modal__content {\n white-space: normal;\n}\n.

This seems to be a duplicate of issue #228. That bug has been resolved and will be fixed in the next released.\n. Hi!\nI don't think this is needed. You can already do this with the 'postpush' event. The event object contains two page objects: leavePage and enterPage and they have a name property.\nExample:\njavascript\nappNavigator.on('postpush', function(event) {\n  alert('You came from ' + event.leavePage.name);\n});\nHere's an example pen:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/CEwId\n. Hello,\nThanks for reporting!\nI'm having trouble reproducing this.

Thanks for reporting!\nHow did you use the ng-bind-html directive? Are you just using it on a div of the page you are pushing?\nDoes the error go away if you remove ng-bind-html?\n. Hello, \nWhat version of angular-sanitize.js are you using? I get the same error using an old version.\n. Hi,\nYou should put the ng-submit attribute on the form tag.\nYou should ask these types of questions on Stack Overflow. GitHub is for bug reports and feature requests.\n. Hi,\nThis thread answers your question: \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/20087627/how-to-create-separate-angularjs-controller-files\nPlease ask questions like this on Stack Overflow.\n. Hi,\nDoes it not move when you swipe? Could you please provide a code sample that fails?\n. I've tried it both in the simulator and on a real device without any issues. Could you please paste a minimal example that fails?\nOr could you try this simple example? This works fine for me on iOS6 and up. Did you use any attributes on the <ons-carousel> tag?\nhtml\n  <body>\n    <ons-page>\n      <ons-carousel style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px;\">\n        <ons-carousel-item>\n          <div style=\"height: 100%; background-color: red;\">A</div>\n        </ons-carousel-item>\n        <ons-carousel-item>\n          <div style=\"height: 100%; background-color: green;\">B</div>\n        </ons-carousel-item>\n      </ons-carousel>\n    </ons-page>\n  </body>\n. Hi,\nI don't get the error after patching cordova.js. Did you apply the patch?\nWe use navigator.userAgent to determine what kind of device it is. The message you get is just a warning and it should go away if you apply the patch you sent.\n. Hi,\nPlease ask questions like this on Stack Overflow and use the onsen-ui tag. GitHub is for bug reports and feature requests.\n. Sorry,\nI see what you mean now, the toolbar inside the navigator is one pixel over the other. It will be fixed in the latest version.\nIt's been fixed in 1.2.0-beta, so you can try that if you like.\n. Hi,\nThanks for pointing this out! We will fix it.\n. Fixed in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/d05b655b717559d76ebb88b060731a3bb8c93de8.\n. Thanks! I saw that it was incorrect in the sliding menu template so I've changed it. Are there any other places where it still says \"swipeable\"?\n. Oh, I see!\nThe GitHub pages are not up-to-date. We'll add a redirect to the website.\nEDIT: They now redirect to the website.\n. Hello,\nFor native Android apps the toolbar title is not in the complete center, it's to the left. We decided to emulate this behavior.\nYou can override it by using the fixed-style attribute:\nhtml\n<ons-toolbar fixed-style>\n  <div class=\"center\">Center</div>\n</ons-toolbar>\n. Btw, long titles breaking layouts is a bug so we'll fix that. Thanks for reporting!\nThe following CSS rule should fix it in the meantime:\ncss\n.navigation-bar--android__center {\n  max-width: 50%;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  text-overflow: ellipsis;\n}\n. Thanks, yeah I just added max-width: 50%; to avoid the layout from breaking for Android.\nHowever, I'm not sure if it's nice to add ellipsis by default. Maybe it's better to have an \"ellipsis\" modifier for the navigation bar. As of now the CSS rules will have to be added manually to trim the title.\nWe'll keep this in mind.\n. I understand what you mean, but without overflow: hidden you can have longer titles. That's the reason why I'm reluctant to add it. :)\nWith overflow: hidden it will cut every title at 50% toolbar width.\n. Hi Hirbod,\nThe website and the theme roller will be updated shortly.\n. Thanks for reporting!\nWe will fix this.\n. Hi,\nPlease ask questions like this on Stack Overflow and tag it onsen-ui. GitHub should only be used for bug reports and feature requests.\nYou should be able to do <ons-switch ng-model=\"foo\"></ons-switch>.\n. Ah, I understand. Sorry about that.\nYes this is a bug. The directive sets the value to false.\n. Thanks,\nThe problem with ng-model is that it sets the model value based on if the checked attribute is present or not, so there is a conflict.\nIf you initialize the values in a setImmediate() call it will work, but it looks a bit strange since the animations will fire.\njavascript\nsetImmediate(function() {\n  $scope.$apply(function() { $scope.switchState = true; });\n});\n. Thanks for reporting!\nYes,  I agree that you shouldn't be able to click objects in the background when the menu is active.\n. Yes, I agree it would be nice and would emulate native behavior. We'll definitely add an option to close the menu by clicking outside of it.\n. Thanks for testing the dev-branch @Hirbod, it's really appreciated! :)\nI'll take a look at this.\n. Sorry for breaking this. Fixed in: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/ccee88439556985fda8acb25c506d8b25dabc51e\nThe current behavior is that it will close when tapping outside the open menu as well as blocking pointer events on the main page while the menu is open.\n@Hirbod Feel free to confirm this behavior.\n. Sorry, we have not decided on a date. However, I can safely say it won't be released in the next few days. If I would hazard a guess I think it will be done in around two weeks from now.\nHowever, if you think the master branch is stable enough and you feel brave enough you can use that :)\nIf you find anything else that's broken in the master branch I'll try to fix it as soon as possible, the master branch is supposed to be quite stable.\n. I made an example but couldn't reproduce the bug with resetToPage(). What's your structure? Do you have a navigator on the main page of the sliding menu where you do resetToPage() ?\n<ons-rol align=\"center\"> hasn't been changed so I don't think it's related.\n. Run\nbash\ngulp build\nin css-components directory and then in project root to build the onsen-css-components.css, onsenui.css and onsenui.js files.\n. I see, that's really strange. Is this behavior only present on iOS or does it happen if you run in a browser as well?\nI can't reproduce this. Do you have any idea what might trigger it? I've tried with a navigator as you said but with no issues.\n. I see, seems it triggers the tap event when you click that button. \nChanged the implementation a bit so it removes the tap handler when the menu is closed and binds it after it's been opened. This should be safe.\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/b42b8a17ed1d44ba87f14aebf0606c7d0d9fb08e\nDoes this fix it for you? All my examples work fine after this change.\n. Sorry, I didn't forget about it. :)\nWill look at this as well but I think the fix is similar to the one for https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/422 so I'll do those together.\n. Hi,\nIt's better to ask this kind of questions on StackOverflow. Please use GitHub for feature requests and bug reports only.\nYou can tag your questions with onsen-ui on StackOverflow.\n. Thanks for reporting, we'll fix this!\n. ngDisabled now works with both <ons-button> and <ons-toolbar-button>.\n. Sorry for the new documentation being a bit late, it will be up shortly.\nAlso, as @Hirbod says you should be able to hide the popover with popover.hide().\n. @samaphp Actually the documentation is already done and we're updating it soon. \nBut of course, if you have any corrections or enhancements you'd like to make you're welcome to contribute.\n. @kountouretis Can you please paste the code that isn't working?\n. Hi,\nThanks for reporting. I can only reproduce this in Firefox, are you using Firefox or are you getting it in another browser as well?\n. Ah, I'm using the same version but sadly can't reproduce it. What OS are you using?\nI see that when you start typing the underbar disappears so the element shrinks by one pixel vertically, this is incorrect behavior so we'll fix it. However, I don't get any flickering.\n. Ok, I get the same bug. Thanks a lot for reporting! \n. Hi @zrero !\nActually you edited the automatically generated file. \nYou should edit this file:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/framework/js/notification.js\nAnd also please follow the code standards:\n- Two-space indentation\n- Space between if and parenthesis.\nI'll look at it when you've updated your pull request.\nThanks!\n. Hello!\nActually the indentation and spaces are still a bit off. I've updated the README to describe how to contribute, please take a look:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/README.md#how-to-contribute\nAlso, you don't have to open a new pull request when you make a change. Just make new commits to this repository. \nIf you like you can merge several commits into one:\nhttps://ariejan.net/2011/07/05/git-squash-your-latests-commits-into-one/\nbut that isn't a requirement. It can be good to squash into one commit if you're just fixing style in one of them.\nAlso please write a description what the pull request fixes and how. And also how this behavior is better.\n. Thanks for the bug report!\n. Hi,\nThe line on the bottom is a gradient used as a delimiter between the navigation bar and the content.\nFor devices with high resolution we use background-image and a gradient for the delimiter and for other devices we use border-bottom.\nSomething like this should work to override it in both cases:\ncss\n.navigation-bar {\n  border-bottom: none;\n  background-size: 0px 0px;\n  -webkit-background-size: 0px 0px;\n}\nWe won't add a way to do this in the coming version, but maybe later.\nEDIT:\nYou can also configure the navigation bar border color to be the same as your background. Just change \"Border color\" under \"Toolbar\" at:\nhttp://components.onsen.io/\n. Thanks for the suggestion we'll look into implementing this.\n. Hello,\nI can't reproduce this with iOS 8.1 simulator.\n. Hello! \nThanks for reporting! We'll look at this bug.\n. Hello @f1consulting !\nI've tried a couple of Android devices without issues. Both 4.0 and 4.4 works fine.\nWhat version of Android are you using? I'd also like to know the device model.\n. Hello @woyehenni!\nThanks for the fixes. Since you've contributed code, could you please make a pull request with these changes?\nWe recently extended the section about how to contribute:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/README.md#how-to-contribute\nPlease fork the repository, make the changes, test it and then make a pull request. Also describe the changes you've done and why.\nThanks!\n. Thanks for reporting, we'll take a look at this.\n. @bricous, Could you please paste a small sample that reproduces this?\nI tried it on iOS 8.1 and the page wasn't scrollable when I removed the status bar fill.\n. Hi @joshhunt!\nWhich demo are are you referring to?\nIs it this one?\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/demo/navigator_sliding-menu/index.html\nThat demo works fine when I try it.\n. Hi!\nPlease ask questions about how to use Onsen UI on Stack Overflow. GitHub is for bug reports and feature requests.\nTag you question with onsen-ui.\n. Great!\nI'm closing this since it doesn't seem to be a bug in Onsen UI.\n. Sorry for closing the other issue, I thought it was a duplicate.\nI haven't been able to reproduce this issue on any device I have available.\nCould you please paste a minimal example that reproduces this bug.\nAlso, please state what iOS version and what device you're using.\n. Hi @tranduyhung ! Thanks for reporting.\nThat's really strange. The page with the list still exists in the background so I see no reason why it would scroll up. I tried your code on both an actual device and in the emulator without any issues. I'll try with some other devices as well.\n. Was able to reproduce it on Android 4.0 while it works fine on Android 4.4.\n. Seems like there's something broken. I'm trying to manually reset the scroll after popping a page by using element.scrollTop = originalScroll which works fine on Android 4.4 (where is isn't needed) but on Android 4.0 scrollTop doesn't have any visible effect.\n. Thanks a lot! Merged.\n. Hello,\nIn what way does it not work?\n. Thanks!\nI found a bug where it didn't work sometimes on Android. We were using window.innerWidth to check the width but that is sometimes not updated after orientationchange, now it's been changed to use screen.width for Android which works better.\nBefore we we're checking every time the size changed but now it only checks when it switches from portrait to landscape. For desktop that would be when width / height passes 1.0 which may or may not be when the width is less than 500px. That depends on how high the window is.\nAre you using split view for a desktop application?\n. Yes, those methods have been deprecated since there was a collision with the sliding menu component. \nThanks! I've removed them from the Codepen example and from the demo.\nI agree that the behavior on PC is strange so we'll change it so it recalculates on the 'resize' event. That way it will work as expected on desktop browsers as well.\n. The latest version is 1.2.1, you can download it from http://onsen.io\nYou can also do\nbash\nbower install onsenui#1.2.1\n. What version of Chrome do you use? When I try the example you pasted earlier it works fine in desktop Chrome v39.\n. The split view will collapse when the screen is small but the swipe functionality as been removed in an earlier version. If you want to have a swipeable menu check out <ons-sliding-menu>.\nWe will implement a component that combines the split view with the sliding menu. Sorry about the confusion!\n. Yes, if you want to use the latest version. The functionality overlapped with sliding menu so the feature was removed.\n. Thanks for reporting!\nYou did it correctly. The callback parameter is missing. \n. There are some examples on codepen:\nhttp://codepen.io/onsen/pen/xbbzOQ\n. Hello!\nYeah, I agree it's a nice feature. We'll definitely implement it.\nYou can add this behavior with just a few lines of code:\n``` javascript\nons.ready(function() {\n  slidingMenu.on('postopen', function() {\n    var main = slidingMenu._element[0].\n      querySelector('.onsen-sliding-menu__main').children[0],\n        el = angular.element(main);\nel.on('click', function() {\n  slidingMenu.close();\n  el.off('click');\n})\n\n});\n});\n```\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/PwPKRy\nThere's already an issue about this so I'll close this one.\n. You need to use \nCODE HERE\nWhen you add code.\nYour sliding menu is called app.slidingMenu, just change the variable in my example from slidingMenu to app.slidingMenu and it should work.\n. Thanks for reporting!\nWe've had other users report that the carousel is choppy for some devices. What device are you using?\nAlso, I agree the sliding menu should not be opened when swiping the carousel.\n. Thanks for reporting, we'll take a look at this.\n. Thanks @vandinhchuong !\nThis would be a nice enhancement so we'll consider implementing it.\nAs of now you could probably be able to recreate this behavior by tracking the current page and then pushing it when the tab is opened. \nI made a quick (and dirty) example:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/KwdRGK\nIt will flicker when the tab is opened since it instantly switches the page.\nThis will only work for one navigator, if you have navigators in several tabs you would have to write something more sophisticated :)\n. What version are you using? \n<ons-screen> has been deprecated and has been removed in the latest version of Onsen UI.\n. Just replace it with the code it was loading. For a navigator you can use the page attribute if you want to load from a template.\n. @alenb You can use the page attribute of the <ons-navigator> component.\nhtml\n<ons-navigator title=\"Navigator\" var=\"myNavigator\" page=\"main.html\"></ons-navigator>\nSimple example:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/OMPLwz\n. Thanks for reporting!\nDoes this behavior happen in a specific browser or device?\nCan you reproduce it on this page?\nhttp://codepen.io/onsen/pen/yrhtv\n. EDIT: After some discussion we decided to change default behavior so it will ignore pushPage() and popPage() if it's already popping or pushing. \n. Thanks @Hirbod ,\nI will consider reverting this commit. \nThe previous behavior before was probably safer. When calling pushPage() I guess it's best to push to the stack regardless of what state it's in so the behavior is predictable. \nThe problem with pushing the same page twice may be annoying but is easily fixed and doesn't really break anything.\n. I reverted this. The old behavior seems safer and as @Hirbod said it can be solved pretty easily with some higher level code.\n. Yes, we'll consider that for the next version. I think we'll keep the previous behavior for 1.2.2 since it's due soon.\nThe problem is that it introduces state to the navigator so we need to be a bit careful how we implement this the next time around.\n. Hi @dojoVader !\nYes, it's an Angular service so you can change it if you like.\nHowever, if you've discovered a bug please report it and we will try to fix it. If you've solved it yourself, please feel free to open a pull request.\n. @dojoVader \nThanks for the code. However, I think if pushPage() is called twice it should push two pages.\nWhat browser, device, OS, etc. are you using? Does a button click result in two click events?\nWhat version of Onsen UI are you using? In the latest version we put a blocking mask on top of the navigator while animating to prevent it from being clicked twice.\n. Thanks @dojoVader!\nWe released the  1.3.0-beta today, so if you want to try it you can install it with\nbash\n$ bower install onsenui#1.3.0-beta\nIt contains the fix for navigator.\n. Thanks Hirbod,\nI've merged the PR now since we've removed the agreement requirement.\n. Thanks for reporting!\nWe'll check this out.\n. Hi @gcphost \nThanks for the report!\nIt will scroll to the closest border, so you will have to scroll half the width (or height) of the item.\nWe will consider making it a configurable ratio instead.\n. Added auto-scroll-ratio attribute and methods.\n. Hello @gcphost !\nGlad that you like it. Thanks for your suggestions, the callback for overscroll looks like a good idea so I think we'll implement it.\nWe'll also consider the transition.\n. Thanks for the suggestion.\nActually I don't think we'll add an option to reverse the CSS file, the class names might change and when we add features new classes are added to the CSS. \nWe will consider adding an option to save the current state.\n. Btw, when you download the custom theme there is a stylus file called custom-theme.stylus. If you want to rebuild the theme you can use that file.\nPlease look at the Gulpfile in the project templates to see how it is compiled.\n. Hello,\nThis seems to be an issue with Cordova so I'm closing it. If you think Onsen is causing deviceready not to fire please feel free to reply.\n. Hello,\nYes, they are just example images. You can not recreate them using only Onsen components. You will need to write some CSS to get the same look.\n. Hello,\nThanks for the report. \nWe'll remove the isDraggable() and setDraggable() methods since they don't do anything and they aren't described in the documentation.\nAlso, sorry about the swipeable attribute. We will implement that as well. This means that <ons-carousel> tags must add the swipeable attribute if they don't already have it when updating to the next version.\n. Thanks for reporting.\nThis looks like unexpected behavior. We'll change it so it doesn't scroll the carousel when scrolling the list.\n. It looks like you're using 1.1.4, is that correct?\nI don't think this is a bug, but I could be wrong. You have a modal that you're running the show() method on, but the modal has already been destroyed. Do you have a modal that is shown while the data is loading? \n. Yes, it looks like the crash is due to the show() method being called after the modal has been destroyed.\n. You could put it outside the template, so it doesn't get destroyed.\n. Yes, <ons-page> gets destroyed when you pop a page together with anything inside it. You can put the modal on the top level, inside the <body>.\n. Thanks for reporting @bricous !\nYes, there are some issues with the touch events an the carousel when using it in conjunction with other components. We'll take a look at how we can solve it.\nI'm closing this, since there already is a similar issue.\n. Thanks Cara!\nI've merged the Readme.\n. Thanks for reporting, we will change the links.\nRegarding the editor, we can try updating it to a newer version the next time we deploy the components website.\n. Thanks, that sounds like a bug.\nYou could listen for the ons-carousel:init event.\njavascript\n  document.addEventListener('ons-carousel:init', function(ev) {\n    var carousel = ev.component;\n    carousel.on('postchange', function() {\n      // do something.\n    });\n  });\n. As of now I think you need to listen for the event in your controller, then you can assign it to your $scope. You could wrap it in a service to make it feel more AngularJS.\nThe carousel variable is created inside a setImmediate callback so it's slightly delayed. That's the reason why the variable is null. We will try to fix that.\n. Hello,\nPlease ask questions like this on Stack Overflow and tag them onsen-ui. Also please provide some code so we can help you easier.\nGitHub is for bug reports and feature suggestions.\n. @murliatdure \nYes, you can use them together. Could you make a Codepen example that shows the issue?\n. Added height: 100% to popover__content.\n. Yeah, you can do something like:\n``` css\n.navigation-bar {\n  height: 100px;\n}\nons-toolbar ~ .page__content {\n  top: 100px;\n}\n```\nBtw, you should ask questions about how to use Onsen UI on Stack Overflow.\n. Thanks @benbvs. We'll look into this.\n. Thanks a lot for the suggestions @Hirbod !\nWe will probably not add all of those features since the API would be very large. What do you consider the most important?\nWe're planning on adding these:\n- Configurable auto-scroll ratio. Both a method and an attribute\n- Overscroll events\nI'll comment on some of them:\n- We might consider making duration and timing configurable for the scroll animations.\n- Auto play and pause - Is this needed? Seems like it's very easy to do manually by just adding an interval. \n- Why do you need the start delay and animation delay? Is that also related to auto play?\nI agree that a wrapping carousel would be nice, but I'm not really sure how it would work when the carousel isn't full screen. We'll consider that one.\n. Thanks for reporting! We'll check it out.\n. We're actually planning to add infinite scroll and pull to refresh next version. I'd like to say yes, but unfortunately there's no hidden API. :)\n. Oh, I  misunderstood. I though you meant like an infinite list. We'll be adding infinite list with lazy loading in the next version.\n. All right. I think this use case is covered by the lazy loader so I'm closing this.\n. Thanks @Hirbod, we will update the icons to 2.0.\n. Updated to 2.0.1.\n. Accidentally commited generated files.\n. @anatoo, I added auto-refresh attribute.\n. Just put the code inside the callback.\njavascript\nons.notification.alert({\n  message: \"Something terrible will happen!\",\n  callback: function() {\n    // do something terrible.\n  }\n});\n. That's not possible. In order to stop and wait for user input we will have to run some code and while code is running we can't get user input so it's not possible to do a synchronous alert dialog in JavaScript. JavaScript is not multi-threaded so we can't listen for input while doing other things.\nBtw, why can't you put the code inside the callback? It will execute after the dialog has been closed.\n. Please ask questions about programming on Stack Overflow. GItHub is for bug reports and feature requests.\nThe builtin window.alert and window.confirm stop JavaScript execution. It's not possible to do that with just JavaScript since it's single-threaded.\n. Glad you like it! :)\nIt's possible but quite tricky. You can register custom transitions:\n``` javascript\nangular.module('app').run(function(MyTransition, NavigatorView) {\n  NavigatorView.registerTransitionAnimator('custom', new MyTransition())\n})\n.factory('MyTransition', function(NavigatorTransitionAnimator) {\n  var MyTransition = NavigatorTransitionAnimator.extend({ \n    push: function(enterPage, leavePage, callback) {\n      // Do animation here.\n      callback();\n    },\npop: function(enterPage, leavePage, callback) {\n  /// Do animation here.\n  callback();\n}\n\n});\nreturn MyTransition;\n});\n```\nPlease look at https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/framework/views/liftTransitionAnimator.js for a sample. You could just copy the service in that file and replace the duration with something longer. I think we'll rewrite the transitions so they're easier to extend.\n. Please ask questions about programming on Stack Overflow. The GitHub issues is mainly for big reports and feature requests.\n. As I said, please ask this kind of questions on Stack Overflow. \nAlso, remember to supply code to show what you've tried already so people can understand why it's not working.\n. Thanks @khoshrou !\nYes, there are some issues with carousel when used in conjunction with other components. We will address these in the next release.\n. Added overflow-x: auto (or overflow-y depending on if it's a vertical or horizontal carousel).\nThanks, @khoshrou !\n. There is a method called navigator.resetToPage(page, options). You can do\njavascript\nnavigator.resetToPage('home.html', { animation: 'default' });\nHowever, I found an issue where it doesn't remove the back button so we'll look at that.\n. Thanks for reporting, we'll have a look at this. Seems like it tries to access the attribute after the element has been destroyed.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Solving this bug also solved a memory leak which is nice. :+1: \n. Thanks for reporting, @Hirbod !\n. Hi, since ons.createPopover is a global function the popover is not attached to the DOM of the controller. You need to create an event handler for the $destroy event:\n``` javacript\nangular.module('myApp').controller('MyController', function($scope) {\n  ons.ready(function() {\n    ons.createPopover('popover.html').then(function(popover) {\n      $scope.popover = popover;\n    });\n  });\n$scope.$on('$destroy', $scope.popover.destroy);\n});\n```\nThe z-index bug has been fixed.\n. Thanks @Hirbod ,\nIs it possible for you to create a minimal example that reproduces the blink bug?\n. Merry Christmas, @Hirbod !\nI'm Swedish so I celebrated Christmas yesterday. You celebrate on the 24th in Germany as well, right?\nI'll see if I can reproduce it. I'm a bit busy so maybe not today but in the coming days.\n. Hello @khoshrou \nWe are aware there are some graphical glitches on Android 2.3. We're sorry about that but we don't have any plans to fix all those glitches since 2.3 is getting very old.\n. I'm not sure. Maybe the :active pseudo-class doesn't work in Android 2.3 WebView. This is the CSS that is specific to the tappable list items:\n``` css\n.list__item--tappable {\n  transition: background-color 0.2s linear;\n}\n.list__item--tappable:active {\n  background-color: var-list-item-active-background-color;\n  transition: none;\n}\n.list__item--tappable:hover {\n  transition: none;\n}\n```\nIf you find a way to fix it without JavaScript please make a pull request and I will merge the code.\n. Hello @andrejguran \nThis is not a bug. The title is left aligned on Android to simulate native behavior. You can disable this by using\nhtml\n<ons-toolbar fixed-style>\n ...\n</ons-toolbar>\n. Thanks for reporting, @jonasfj !\nWe'll consider adding this feature.\n. Hello @khoshrou !\nI'm unable to reproduce this. How do you show the alert dialogs?\nIt works well in this example:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/VYmQJz\n. Oh I see, it's because they both share the same variable name since it's the same dialog. Can you make them into two different dialogs? Or maybe use the ons.notification methods?\n. I don't think it's a bug. We haven't intended several copies of the same dialog to be showed simultaneously.\nMaybe you can write your own show() function that keeps track if it's already displayed or maybe an \"Error queue\" that displays the errors in turn after they've been confirmed.\n. Did you change the var attribute? If so, I believe it's a bug.\n. Thanks @prodigga, we'll keep making Onsen UI better.\nWe'll take a look at this.\n. Fixed.\n. @87260280 \nHi, <script> tags in templates will not be evaluated. The browser doesn't evaluate scripts when they are added to the DOM and OnsenUI doesn't run eval on it.\nI don't think there is any situation where you need to put script tags in your template tags. Just write your JavaScript in a js file and import it in your index.html.\n. I haven't looked through all the code, but you have a tab bar inside a navigator. Everything inside the navigator will be removed when you push a page to it. You should put the tab bar on the higher lever and use navigators for the tab pages.\n. Hi @wshark6!\nI tried your code but didn't get the error message. Is it possible for you to upload your failing code somewhere so I can have a look at it? \nIt may be some other reason why it doesn't parse the second template.\n. Sure, please send it to\njavascript\nconsole.log('andreas.argeli.us'.replace(/\\./, '@'));\n. Please ask questions about using Onsen UI on Stack Overflow and tag the question 'onsen-ui'.\nThis page is for bug reports and feature requests+suggestions.\nYou can use CSS to remove the back button.\ncss\nons-back-button i {\n  display: none !important;\n}\n. Work's fine when I try it. When the button is disabled it doesn't listen to pointer events. Do you feel this is incorrect behavior? If so, please explain what behavior you would expect.\n. That's strange. What browser are you using?\nIt just adds a disabled attribute to the button which has CSS like this:\ncss\nons-button[disabled] {\n  pointer-events: none;\n}\nso it sounds like some kind of browser bug.\n. I tried it in iOS8 and didn't have any trouble. Do you get this behavior on both the simulator and the actual device?\nI used the following simple test:\n``` html\n<!doctype html>\n\n\n\nMy App \n\n \n \n \n\n\n    var module = angular.module('app', ['onsen'])</p>\n<pre><code>.controller('DisabledController', function($scope) {\n  $scope.$watch('disabled', function(value) {\n    $scope.button.setDisabled(value);\n  });\n\n  $scope.doSomething = function() {\n    alert(\"something\");\n  };\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n\n\n\n\nDisabled button test\n\n\nDo something\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n``\n. This is very strange. I'm unable to reproduce this behavior in the simulator.\n. Only dorefresh()insidesetImmediate().\n. We've had requests about this previously and I agree it would be a nice feature.\n. I agree it should have the same features as.\n.now supportsdisabledattribute as well asngDisabled` directive.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ,\nI'll check it out!\n. Opening the keyboard triggered a resize event while the carousel was hidden (no width), so there were some calculations that were incorrect so it always scrolled to the left-most position.\n. Could you please elaborate?\n. I see, that'd be a nice nice feature.\n. Hello,\nWhat about using ng-controller on the <ons-navigator> tag?\n\n\nIf you do that the model will be shared among the navigator pages.\n@senju\u3000\u3055\u3093\n<ons-navigator>\u306bng-controller=\"MainController\"\u3092\u4ed8\u3051\u308c\u3070\u3044\u304b\u304c\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\uff1f\u305d\u3046\u3059\u308b\u3068\u3001\u30ca\u30d3\u30b2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u306f\u540c\u3058\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u3092\u5171\u6709\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u4e0b\u624b\u306a\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3067\u7533\u3057\u8a33\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002 \n. No problem. Glad you solved it :)\n. Thanks!\nI reopened the other issue so I'll close this one. I'll do some extensive testing of this so the behavior is as expected.\n. Thanks, @khoshrou !\nWe will try with some Android tablets and see how it can be improved.\n. @zhuangperola \nThanks for the request. We've had some requests previously about upgrading to Hammer 2 and we'll do it in an upcoming version.\nUnfortunately, the features for 1.2.2 are frozen right now, but we'll definitely try to add it for 1.2.3.\n. No problem. Closing this since there already is an issue about this.\n. Hi,\nThere already are some utility methods like: ons.notification.alert, ons.notification.prompt and ons.notification.confirm.\nHere's some example usage:\nhttp://codepen.io/onsen/pen/Qwwxyp\nThe functions are all described in the documentation:\nhttp://onsen.io/guide/overview.html#UsingAlert\nAlso, if you have questions about how to use Onsen UI, please feel free to write a question on Stack Overflow and tag it with the \"onsen-ui\" tag.\n. Thanks @zhuangperola !\nActually I think this is the same as this issue:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/389\nThat bug has been fixed and in the next version it will work as expected so I'm closing this issue.\n. No problem. Glad it helped! :)\n. Thanks for reporting!\nYou can actually register animators for your navigator. There is a service called NavigatorView.\nIf you inject the service you can do:\njavascript\nNavigatorView.registerTransitionAnimator('myAnimator', MyVeryOwnAnimator);\nAnd to create your own animator you can do:\n``` javascript\nmodule.factory('MyVeryOwnAnimator', function(NavigatorTransitionAnimator) {\n  var MyVeryOwnAnimator = NavigatorTransitionAnimator.extend({\n    // write your animation code here.\n  });\nreturn MyVeryOwnAnimator;\n});\n```\nTo do a RTL animator you could look at the following code and just change it so the animation is mirrored:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/framework/views/simpleSlideTransitionAnimator.js\n. That sounds like a bug. Could you give an example that reproduces this behavior?\nBy the way, is this in 1.2.1? We are aware there's a bug like this in the current master branch but it will be fixed before release.\n. Ok, I managed to break something when I added a feature to the sliding menu. If you go back a couple of commits or checkout the 1.2.1 tag it should work.\n. Thank you! That's really nice to hear :)\n. Thanks Cara!\n. Hello @bheijns !\nLooks like the logo should be pushed 20px (height of the status bar) down on iOS 7 and iOS8. Onsen UI does this by default but maybe there's some conflict.\nUnfortunately I don't know about the ads on the bottom. Do they just cover the WebView at the bottom? In that case I guess you could use \"margin-bottom: {AD_HEIGHT}px\" and push up the tabbar.\n. Thanks Cara!\n. Thanks for reporting @bristolfairy !\nLooks like we need to recalculate position for DOM tree changes.\n. Popover will now listen for DOM tree changes.\n. @anatoo \u3055\u3093\u3001\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\uff01merge\u3044\u305f\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\n. Thanks @Hirbod ,\nWe'll look at this. It shouldn't be possible to touch elements behind the modal so it sounds like a bug.\n. Actually I'm unable to scroll background both when using ons-modal and ons.notification. Is this for a specific device or do you always get this behavior?\n. Thanks, actually tried in Android. Will try iOS as well.\niOS  simulator takes  so long to boot :)\n. Managed to reproduce it on iOS. Thanks!\nYeah, Android emulator is even slower. I have a Mac Mini so it takes more than one minute to start the iOS simulator while Android sim takes 5 minutes. ><\n. Scrolling content inside modal seems to work fine on all devices I tried. Both using <ons-scroller> and a normal block element. What kind of content did you put in the scroller?\nScrolling the background is a bug though so we'll fix that.\n. Fixed for sliding menu and modal. Dialog and alert dialog will require some refactoring.\n. Hello @atakayama ,\nThanks for the pull request!\nBefore I merge this, could you please provide an example where hideTabs doesn't work? \nIt seems to work fine in this example:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/xbXLjZ\n. I see it now!\nThanks for the fix! I'll merge this.\n. I just realized the change was made in onsenui.js. That file is actually automatically generated, please make changes in the framework directory if you make another pull request.\nI've moved the change to the correct place.\n. Thanks @hyyan ,\nWe will consider this. It will probably not be resolved in the next version but we will definitely look at it in an upcoming version.\n. @anatoo, thank you for looking at the code and making the translations.\nI changed to an `$evalAsync'  call instead and it works well.\n. Merged.\n. Do you mean to handle events? \nLike this:\nhtml\n<ons-navigator pop-page=\"doSomething($event)\">\n</ons-navigator>\n. Oh, I see. \nI agree that this would be quite nice. We'll consider implementing this. :+1: \n. Hi @ram-you !\nThanks for the suggestion. Actually we discussed this recently and will probably implement a subset of the material design spec.\nThere is already an issue about this so I'm closing this one.\n. Hi @brunopgalvao !\nWhat do you mean by \"overscroll\"? Does it only happen when you scroll the page?\nCould you make a runnable example that reproduces this?\n. Hi @Wouter33 !\nThanks for the suggestion. \nActually we've just implemented this so it will be available in the next version.\nIt will only load a handful of items into the DOM at a time. \nI believe there's already an issue about this so I'm closing this.\n. @Wouter33 We have not decided on a date yet but I believe it will take between one and two weeks from today.\nWe have to test on several devices before releases so it takes some time.\n. @Wouter33 It's on this branch: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/tree/lazy-repeat\nIt's not merged yet so there might be some bugs. Also, there's an issue with iOS where it won't render until the intertial scroll has come to a complete stop, so even if the elements are added to the DOM it takes some time for them to show up.\n. Thanks for trying it. :)\nGreat that it's working well. Please report if you have any issues.\nOne way to solve your problem is to use <ons-list-item> for the headers as well but add some class to them so you can style them.\nI'll try to think of a nicer way.\n. Thanks @Wouter33 !\nThat sounds like a nice feature. We'll consider adding it.\nIn the meanwhile if you want that behavior you can easily implement it yourself. I made a small example:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/zxPowB\n. @anatoo \nI changed so it will re-render the content every time it's updated so it can be used with ons-pull-hook. \nIn the Chrome CPU profiler i get 80% idle time so it seems fast enough.\n. \u3069\u3046\u3082\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\n. It should work fine for any element as long as you know their height.\n. Thanks @Hirbod,\nThere has been some confusion about the text alignment of the toolbar title. We'll improve this to make it more intuitive.\nBtw, I believe you can add modifier=\"android\" to get left-aligned titles in the current version.\n. Could you clarify and give a code example?\nIt sounds like you're having trouble with Cordova rather than Onsen UI.\n. @Hirbod We would not like to use the ons.* variables anymore since they're prone to some strange behavior. Also they've not been mentioned in the docs for several versions.\n. I'm really sorry about that @Hirbod,\nSince it was an undocumented feature and it has some side effects we decided to get rid of it. I understand that some people we're using it but I think that's an even better reason to remove it since we don't want to keep supporting undocumented features.\nI guess it would have been better to remove it when going from 1.1 to 1.2. Sorry about the trouble.\n. Thanks @JcDenton86 !\nIs it lagging if you use Crosswalk as your WebView?\n. Ok, \nIs the DOM on the page you're pushing very large? Can you estimate how many items are being animated?\nIf the DOM on the animated page is very complex it might be possible to display some of the elements after the animation has been finished.\n. I don't think passing the object would be a problem. The DOM doesn't seem to be large either. The image could be the problem. Is the animation still slow if you skip the hirez image? \nMaybe you can load that a bit later. Actually you don't need a timeout, you can listen for the postpush/postpop events:\njavascript\n$scope.navi.on('postpush', function() {\n  // Do something cool here.\n});\n. Thanks,\nYeah. The event handler will not start a new $digest cycle. Maybe we can change it so that the digest cycle is started automatically after the callbacks are executed.\n. Great! But this is Crosswalk, right?\n. Thanks @Hirbod,\nI'll change the iOS version detection. It can be done without user agent.\nI think we can detect Android without user agent as well.\n. Hi!\nPlease try $scope.$evalAsync instead.\n. It doesn't support the normal ngRepeat syntax with filters, but you should be able to achieve sorting by writing a delegate object that supports it.\nThanks for trying out the new feature by the way. It's really appreciated. :)\n. I see,\nActually I just made a change so it will re-render the list on every $digest loop. Maybe it works better now.\nPlease see this example:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/radBRB\nOf course if the list is super big it might be a bit slow but if the list is not too big you should be able to sort it in JavaScript.\n. Thanks @JcDenton86 \nAre you using iOS or Android? Please tell me what device you're using and what OS version.\n. I was unable to reproduce this on Android 5 running on a Nexus 7.\nCould you please provide some code that reproduces this issue? Closing this in the meanwhile.\n. Are you using the dev version of Onsen UI?\nPlease try adding the attribute auto-refresh to your carousel. It will auto-refresh if the number of DOM elements changes (e.g. a carousel item is added or removed from the carousel).\n. Great!\nWe'll make some tests. If it's not too performance demanding we might put it on by default.\n. Thanks @Hirbod,\nI'll try to address these points next week. \nOf course, you're always welcome to make a pull request :)\n. Thanks for all the testing @Hirbod,\nIssue with small carousel has been fixed in:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/c1b5ecd1ce99b0bcf0d9e131e6ff0842deff9323\nThere was a bug where it wrapped around when the total width of all the items was smaller than the width of the carousel container.\n. Thanks @Hirbod,\nI'll see If I can find a 4.3 device for testing. \nIs it possible to run Crosswalk for you project?\n. Thanks @Hirbod!\nI haven't been able to confirm this bug yet but if you feel your fix works well you're welcome to make a pull request. Do you think it's possible to make a fix that doesn't rely on device detection?\n. Thanks @Hirbod!\nI see no reason for this overlap either. Removed the margin.\n. You can use ngInclude, since Onsen UI is built on top of AngularJS all Angular features are available:\nhttps://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngInclude\n. In what way doesn't it work? Is the HTML not included at all?\n. Oh, you should do\nhtml\n<div ng-include=\"'main.html'\"></div>\nIt's an Anglular expression, so it will be evaluated.\nUpdated your Codepen: http://codepen.io/argelius/pen/zxReOe\n. I believe this is correct. The align attribute is for vertical alignment. If you want to center the text you can use text-align: center;.\nI'll fix the box-align issue.\n. Added non-vendor specific \"box-align\". \nClosing this but feel free to open if you think I am in error.\n. As I said it's for vertical alignment. For centering text just do text-align: center;.\n. Thanks for the video @Hirbod!\nI'll take a look at and see if I can reproduce it.\nIs it possible for you to maybe make an example that fails? It would be nice to see if it fails on other platforms than Mobile Safari and what might cause it. Looks like the drag event is interrupted in some way.\nHere is a simple example using ons-pull-hook if you'd like to fork it.\nhttp://codepen.io/andipavllo/pen/jEZrdr\n. By the way, I see no reason why <ons-pull-hook> should not be used with <ons-scroller> so I changed it to allow both tags:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/a0f31c2dbc6dfc743a8a566e9813da70dcceaf0c\nDoes this fix your issues? \n. Thanks @Hirbod,\nYou mean that the dialog should be attached to the DOM of the controller that created it? I'll consider how to implement this. Maybe we will need to add an extra argument to createDialog() to implement this behavior.\nOr maybe we'll add another method that's works better when calling from inside a controller.\nSorry, I don't have any fast solution other than attaching the methods to the scope of a controller that is attached to the body tag since all dialogs will be children to that.\n. Yes, passing the scope as an argument would probably be the best option. \nAnother option would be to allow putting the <ons-dialog> tag inside the tag with the controller that controls it. A problem with this is that you maybe want to be able to show the same dialog in several different places.\n. By the way,\nHave you considered putting your authentication code in a service instead of using scope methods? In that case you can just inject it in the dialog's controller.\nI tend to avoid using the scope for complex operations like this.\n. No, sorry. Since it isn't attached as a child in the DOM I think there's no nice way to do that.\nYou can always to something like this to get the \"parent\" scope:\njavascript\n$scope.fauxParentScope = angular.element(document.querySelector('.element-with-controller')).scope();\nNot very nice though :)\n. Yes, you should only run createDialog once. Did I write an example like that? If so, I will fix it.\nIn the demo it's like this:\n``` javascript\napp.controller('MyCtrl', function($scope) { \n  $scope.data = { \n    name: '', \n    description: '', \n  }; \nons.createDialog('dialog.html').then(function(dialog) { \n    $scope.dialog = dialog; \n  }); \n$scope.show = function() { \n    $scope.dialog.show(); \n  }; \n});\n``\n. Thanks! I've fixed the example. Will take a look at thedestroy()` method as well.\nEDIT: The destroy() method works fine when I try it. Seems like the loginDialog doesn't exist when the event handler is fired.\n. Great!\nI'll take another look at the destroy() method and see what's going on there.\nThanks for all the feedback! The examples I make are often a bit simple compared to real use cases so it's good to see how it works in a bigger app.\n. ons.createDialog now accepts an options object where you can specify options.parentScope.\n. Yes, that would be nice. \nWe will refactor the animation classes so it will be easier to tweak duration and timing.\n. Hi @ankurvr7003 !\nCould you please provide code that reproduces this issue?\n. Sure,\nPlease send the code to: \njavascript\nconsole.log('andreas.argeli.us'.replace('.', '@'));\n. Hi @ankurvr7003 !\nSorry, we haven't been able to reproduce this bug yet.\n. Did you notice which component caused it?\n. That's interesting.\nSo, it's just a normal <select> tag and without it it works fine?\n. Looks like it's related to this: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/9128\n. Also, for the second issue I'd like some more information. Does this happen with all templates or only when you use createDialog?\n. Yes, there was another user that had a similar problem. He said that if he made several templates only every second template worked. So if he had three templates the first and the third worked while the second one didn't.\nCan you confirm if this is the same issue? Do they work if you put a dummy template between them?\n. Thanks! It would be nice to see exactly what triggers this bug. \nThe user with a similar bug had a quite complicated app so it was hard to identify the cause.\n. Thanks @andipavllo !\nI'll take a look at this and see if I can fix it.\n. Thanks @andipavllo !\n. The carousel disappears when it's parent element is translated.\n. Have you confirmed that all JavaScript files are loaded correctly and there are no JavaScript errors? Does it show fine if you use a simple page like:\n```\n\n\nTitle\n\nSome text\n\n```\n. I think you want to have the tab bar outside the page element. \n. Could you try to make a minimal example by removing stuff until the bug doesn't occur anymore?\n. I'm happy you were able to find the problem! :+1: \n. Thanks @Hirbod !\n. I've looked at this and I think it's better to just define a height of the dialog. \nIf we change the height of the dialog based on what's in the navigator the dialog will change height when a page is pushed which I don't think is very nice.\n. Thanks for reporting @DennisXH !\nWe will take a look at this. Could you please paste the whole code that reproduces this? Does it happen on all iOS devices or only on iPhone 5?\n. Happy you solved it! :)\n. Are you using Crosswalk as your WebView?\nIf not, I would recommend trying that. Crosswalk only supports Android 4.0\nand later though.\n2015/02/24 1:08 \"syrakozz\" notifications@github.com:\n\nthe project in android is slower than iphone,\nis there any recomendattion about android minimum device specification\nthat i must support,\nor is there any tips for making the android perform fast like ios does\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/461.\n. Thanks @JcDenton86 !\n\nWe're actually planning on implementing some parts of the Material Design spec. \n. Hi,\nWe remove event handlers when elements are destroyed so not removing them shouldn't cause a memory leak. It doesn't hurt though.\n. off(eventName, callback) will remove a callback so that callback will never execute.\nExample:\n``` javascript\nvar cb = function() {\n  console.log('Hi, there!');\n};\n// Add event handler.\n$scope.navigator.on('postpush', cb);\n$scope.$on('$destroy', function() {\n  // Remove the event handler.\n  $scope.navigator.off('postpush', cb);\n});\n```\n. Thanks for reporting @gtsopour ! We will look into this.\n. @gtsopour \nI've made a change that fixes this bug. If you'd like to try it you can use the latest build version:\nhttp://onsen.io/download.html#latest-build\n. Yes, I think this is the best way to do it. There will however be two menus in DOM so if you make any DOM changes you will have to make them to both.\nWe're planning on adding a component that works both like a split view and a sliding menu.\n. Hi!\nIt has already been created and merged into master. \nIt's called <ons-splitter> and will be released with Onsen UI 2.0.\n. Hi @amir-s !\nYes, it's documented in this file:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/framework/directives/splitter.js\n. Thanks @bricuous!\nI agree that would be nice.\n. Thanks @EverlastingFire , I'll check it out!\n. @EverlastingFire \nThe issue has been fixed now. Thanks for including the failing example as well. It's very helpful.\nIt will be fixed in the next release but if you want to use it straight away you can build from source or download the latest build here:\nhttp://onsen.io/download.html#latest-build\n. Thanks for reporting @tunacoder !\nWe'll look into this.\n. Yes, please add a screenshot here if it's not too much trouble.\n. Thanks a lot @tunacoder!\nThis has been fixed now.\n. Thanks @nakomi!\nRight now there's no good way to do this because of the absolute positioning. You can try using position: relative for the container though if you want some content above the list.\n. Thanks! We'll try to think of some way to make it easier to use.\nI'm reopening this if that's OK.\n. Thanks @sandeep-agarwal !\nWe'll take a look at this issue.\nDo you get this issue when you run it as a Cordova app as well?\n. There are some methods to change modifiers: http://onsen.io/guide/overview.html#UsingModifier\nYou can make your own modifiers using CSS. Just look at how the chevron modifier has been implemented.\n. Thanks @tormahiri !\nYes, we've been getting a lot of requests for RTL support lately. We'll consider adding it. \nHowever, we don't have anyone on the team that speaks a language with RTL writing so we would need someone to test it.\nI'm closing this issue since there is already one on this topic.\n. Thanks @JcDenton86 !\nThere is a bug where the pull hook is not destroyed correctly when it's removed from the DOM. It will be fixed in the next release.\nWe have introduced continuous builds so can always download the latest version here:\nhttp://onsen.io/download.html#latest-build\nThis version contains the latest bug fixes but might be a bit unstable. Right now it should be fairly stable since we've only done some bug fixes since the last release.\n. Hi @joshhunt !\nThanks for the feedback! We'd like to add something like the iOS action sheet at some point.\nActually ons.notification.confirm supports more than two options:\njavascript\nons.notification.confirm({\n  message: \"What do you want to do?\",\n  buttonLabels: [\n    'Action 1',\n    'Action 2',\n    'Cancel'\n  ],\n  primaryButtonIndex: 2\n});\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/PwyPvp\nMaybe it's not clear enough in the docs.\n. No problem!\nBut it seems like the docs never mention that it's possible to use more than two buttons so we'll make it clearer in the next release. Thanks! :)\n. Thanks for reporting @MikaelLind !\nWe'll try to solve the flickering.\n. Unfortunately not at the moment but I think we'll release it pretty soon.\n. @MikaelLind \nI've tried it both on an iOS device and in the simulator without any issues.\nWhat device and iOS version were you using? Also, what kind of content were you displaying on the page?\n. Tack @MikaelLind !\nNo, I don't think that should be an issue. I'll make some more tests this week.\nIs the list just text or are there images? Are you using any 3d (or non-3d) transforms on the content?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks @andipavllo !\nMerged.\n. Thanks @shingo-kumagai !\n. Thanks @WaseemSiddiqui !\nThis looks like a bug so we'll fix it. Seems like the exact same event is triggered twice.\n. Looks like the inner elements were compiled twice. \nIt's been fixed now.\n. Thanks @rettier!\nThis bug was already fixed in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/93613dbd64272df9ed4d72c75b24b838863b9618\nWe will make a new release shortly with this fix.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\nI'll merge this now.\n. Thanks a lot @marcel-dancak !\nWe will take a look at this. Feel free to open a pull request if you like.\n. That's really appreciated, thanks! :+1: \n. Thanks @marcel-dancak ! I've merged it.\n. Thanks @andipavllo !\nPlease do some tests to see if this works well with Windows Phone tomorrow.\n. @andipavllo Please also confirm that it works well on Android and iOS\n. Thanks @marcel-dancak !\n. Also added for createPopover and createAlertDialog.\n@anatoo\u3055\u3093\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306e\u30c9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u66f8\u3044\u3066\u304f\u308c\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f\u3042\u3068\u3001\u4f55\u304b\u304a\u304b\u3057\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3089\u6559\u3048\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\n. Thanks @Cadmos !\nWe will address this issue as soon as we can.\n. @Cadmos What is the value of your collapse property?\n. This should be fixed now.\n. Hi @zhuangperola !\nCould you please provide some code that reproduces this? Does it happen on all devices or just some?\nIn this example it works fine: http://codepen.io/onsen/pen/jEWBGJ\n. Thanks for the info! I think I'll be able to reproduce it now.\n. I think I misunderstood what you meant. Could you please describe the problem again and supply an example. Screenshots would also be helpful.\n. Thanks @danjarvis ! We'll fix this\n. @andipavllo Looks good. Please add the comment and I will merge.\n. Sure, you can use JavaScript to scroll to the top by setting scrollTop = 0 for the .page__content element.We will consider a way to make this simpler.\n. What about using the $anchorScroll service and putting an invisible element at the top of the list?\nIn controller:\njavascript\n$scope.scrollToTop = function() {\n  $location.hash('top');\n  $anchorScroll();\n};\nExample:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/jERZwa\n. Hi @kalevieino !\nWe'll take a look at this. Thanks!\n. Thanks @Trexology !\nI'm sorry for letting a stupid bug like that slip through :)\nWe will fix this. In the meanwhile, please also add the no-reload attribute.\n. Great you were able to solve it @d3orn ! :)\nIf you don't mind I will actually open this again since I think it should be possible to scroll even in an <ons-page> element.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Hi @wozzup !\nI don't think Angular 1.x is dead just yet. :)\nAngular 2 is still in Alpha and currently only Chrome supports the Web Components API (that I know of).\nWe're actively discussing the future of Onsen UI and one of the paths we might take is making it available for react.js . We haven't decided yet but you might see an announcement in the coming weeks.\n. Hi @Sakura777!\nPlease make a minimal code example and we will check it out.\nYou can fork one of our codepen examples:\nhttp://codepen.io/onsen/\n. Thanks @danjarvis !\nWe'll fix this. Since it's only an issue in the horizontal direction we will add overflow-x rule. I'll also ask why the change was made in the first place but it was a long time ago so there's a chance he's forgotten :)\n. @danjarvis I moved this issue:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/552\nWe will fix it now.\n. @anatoo\u3055\u3093\n\u307e\u3060\u3067\u304d\u3066\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u3053\u306e\u3084\u308a\u65b9\u3067\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\u304b\uff1f\nvar pageScope = this._scope.$parent.$new();\n\u306f\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002$parent\u3060\u3068\u4f7f\u3044\u306b\u304f\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3046\u306e\u3067\u3001this._scope.$new()\u306b\u3057\u305f\u3051\u3069\u3001\u306a\u3093\u3067$parent\u306b\u3057\u305f\u304b\u5206\u304b\u308a\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f\n. http://onsen.io/reference/ons-loading-placeholder.html\n. Merged. Good job!\n. Thanks for reporting, @d3orn ! We've fixed the issue\n. Actually this fix broke the behavior on iOS so I'm opening this again.\n. Hi! Do you mean that the keyboard covers the text input?\nThere are plugins that listen to keyboard events. If you listen for the keyboard opening you can then scroll to the selected element.\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugins-keyboard\nWe've integrated this plugin, so if you use it you can do\nons.softwareKeyboard.on('show', fn);\nor\nons.softwareKeyboard.on('hide', fn);\n. Hi @ironson !\nWhat version of Onsen UI are you using?\nIt works fine when I try it here:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/yywjwP\n. Thanks @seanchas116 ! Looks great.\n. Thanks @zumbrunnen !\nDidn't realize the repo URL was incorrect. That was embarrassing ;)\n. @frankdiox, could you also write an e2e test for the loading placeholder?\n. Thanks @salztorte !\nCould you create a simple example that reproduces this issue?\n. Hi @Kianp !\nWe're using Hammer for touch events in Onsen UI so it's already loaded, however it's an older version so it looks like the one you're using isn't compatible.\nDoes it work well if you remove your Hammer import?\nWe will upgrade to the latest version of Hammer pretty soon.\n. Looks good!\n. Thanks @andipavllo !\n. Thanks for the pull request @d3orn !\nWill check it out tomorrow.\n. Thanks @d3orn !\nI tried it and it works fine. Will merge it but I added a simple test for element removal as well so I'll merge my own branch. Closing this.\n. That's great! :)\n. Thanks for reporting @WaseemSiddiqui !\nWe will investigate this. Definitely sounds like unwanted behavior.\n. @WaseemSiddiqui \nThese two issues have been addressed now. Scrolling the detail page will not trigger render on the infinite list and now we cause a $digest loop when the page is popped even if it's popped with the hardware back button.\n. Hi! You need to create an ons-tabbar as well for your tabs.\nThis is a simple example:\nhttp://codepen.io/onsen/pen/pGuDL\n. Looks great! Let's write all components as custom elements :)\n. The first time the sliding menu is opened by dragging the menu is transparent (only the shadow is visible).\nThis happens when using it with tab bar but not when used separately.\n. Thanks @nutti!\n. So you want several tab bars on every page?\nThe custom element is manly for page navigation so this won't work, but you can of course use just the CSS.\nPlease see the component page for information:\nhttp://onsen.io/\u2026images/index/feature-custom-elements.png\n. Thanks @konpyu !\n. Thanks @iVanPan ! We'll investigate this\n. @anatoo I've added the translations and updated the changelog.\n. Great! ES6 rocks!\n. @Hirbod \nIt's been fixed by this commit:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/c3e54adc124fe4797b2044d279ea7444edea2738\n. Thanks @lambdafu !\nWe will take a look at this issue.\n. Thanks @d3orn ! I will take a look at this now.\n. Looks great! Merged.\nThanks for all these fixes @d3orn ! :)\n. I cleaned up your code:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/jEoRKP\nYou need to put the tabbar inside the sliding menu main page and the reason why you got a lot of tab bars was that you were opening the page with the tab bar with one of your tabs.\n. Thanks! I'll take a look at this.\n. Actually I was unable to reproduce this. The template on the website works fine without errors when I tried it.\nWhat device / browser are you running? Where did you download the template?\n. Thanks @OpenNoob ! I will try it again.\n. @OpenNoob \nI'm using the same Chrome version but I don't get the error. Could you paste the complete stack trace?\n. Thanks @OpenNoob !\nThat's strange. Could you also please click the (index):1 and paste what it says?\n. That's strange. I don't think it has anything to do with Onsen UI though so I'm closing this. Please open it again if you think otherwise.\n. Thanks for these fixes, @Hirbod !\n. Sorry, it's been relabelled as a bug now :)\nWill take a look at it soon.\n. Ok! I'll merge it! :)\n. Hi @Sakura777 ,\nThere is currently no support for reordering list elements with drag&drop.\n. That's a good idea! This won't break compatibility and still can write code like this.\nI also think you should be able to use ons-scope directive directly on the element:\n<ons-carousel ons-scope var=\"carousel\">\n ...\n</ons-carousel>\nSo when using var attribute it will search parents until it finds ons-scope or reaches the root node. If it doesn't find ons-scope it will assign to $rootScope.\n. That's interesting. Do you know what browser it's running? If it's IE11 it should have MutationObserver already. We will investigate this.\n. @FragCoder I will close this. Please open again if you feel this is a bug.\n. Thanks @danjarvis !\nWill take a look at these changes now.\n. Thanks! Merged.\n. That's a good idea, we will add it :)\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! Also please update CHANGELOG.md\n@anatoo\u3055\u3093\u3001\u6642\u9593\u306e\u3042\u308b\u3068\u304d\u306b\u7ffb\u8a33\u3092\u304a\u9858\u3044\u3057\u307e\u3059\uff01\n.

Please also update CHANGELOG.md\n. Thansk @jsoref ! Will merge these changes now.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! I've merged this now.\n. Hi @d3orn!\nWe'll take a look at it. I think there is an issue with <ons-template> since we started using the Web Components API.\n. Hi @d3orn !\nThe reason why it isn't working is that the Web Component's createdCallback method is executed after the AngularJS directive.\nDirective: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/framework/directives/template.js\nWeb component: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/core/elements/ons-template.es6\nI'm not really sure where the bug is, but the Web Component should execute first since it's a low level API.\n. @d3orn \nI tried to solve this in a nice way but discovered some pretty big inconsistencies.\n- AngularJS directives are compiled before Custom Elements when using the CustomElements.js polyfill.\n- When using angular.bootstrap() or (ons.bootstrap()) the order is reversed.\n- document.registerElement is a lower level API (at least that's my feeling) so I think it should execute before Angular directives.\n- Even worse, in the native implementation in Google Chrome the timing is random (!!!) so there's no way to know which one comes first...\nSeems like this is fixed in Canary but right now it doesn't work very well. I've reverted it somewhat so in the case where the Custom Element hasn't been executed yet it will do like it did before. This solution is far from optimal thouch... :(\n. You can use the $templateCache service directly.\nDo $templateCache.put('page.html', htmlContent). I'll see why it doesn't work on Android tomorrow. \nSorry for the inconvenience, we're making a lot of big changes right now so things are bound to break. :)\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\nCould you add this to <ons-if-platform> as well?\n. @frankdiox \nLooks great! Merging.\n. Thanks @viniciusvelasco ! We'll take a look at this.\nIn the meanwhile, could you try using the following rule?\ntouch-action: 'pan-y';\n. @viniciusvelasco @digitsinmotion \nThis has been fixed in the latest development version. If you like please verify that it works now.\n. Looks great @frankdiox!\nPlease add docs as well! After that is done I will merge.\n. Merging this now.\n. Thanks!\nLooks like you solved it so I'm closing this!\n. Hi @shaulhadar !\nWe're prioritizing some other things right now, so I'm not sure if and when we will make it.\n. Hi @kuniakisuzuki !\nThe cancelable parameter works as intended when I tried it on Android.\nWe'll consider changing the behavior when cancelable is false.\n. That's strange. With just the code above it displays two icons?\nThe tag in your code is not closed but I don't think that's the problem.\nOn what device and what browser is this happening?\n. Hi @nehulagr!\nIt should be enabled by default on iOS 7 and iOS 8. What device are you using?\n. I'm glad you were able to solve it! :)\n. Hi!\nons.navigator has been deprecated but if you use the var attribute you should be able to use the window.navi object.\n. Thanks @happyi ,\nI've confirmed that there still is an issue with this.\n. @happyi It's been fixed now.\n. Hi @JcDenton86 !\nYou've missed closing a <ons-template> tag and an <ons-page> tag. It works fine when they're closed:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/JddEzZ\n. This had some unclosed tags as well.\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/GJJWKV\n. It shouldn't be any difference using separate files from using templates. Just name the files the same as the templates in the example above and it should work.\nhttp://plnkr.co/ supports separate files so you can make an example there if it doesn't work out.\n. No problem! If you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask! :)\n. @aneesv \nSorry for the late reply. I was on vacation until yesterday. We will investigate this.\n. @ramingar Are you using Crosswalk or native WebView?\n. Thanks @ramingar ! We will investigate this.\n. @ramingar: This has been fixed in the master branch. We will also release a new patch version with this fix (1.3.7).\nCould you try it out and see if it works as expected?\n. @mohkharma @shaulhadar @abdoljabbar\nWe're also interested in supporting RTL, but none of us can read any RTL language so we would need some help to implement this.\n. Hi @zhipeng-jia ! Thanks for the feedback.\nI think this works as expected. If you have ng-model=\"somevar\" in a ancestor scope it will change all its descendant scopes as well. However, if you use ng-model=\"somevar\" in a descendant scope it will not change its ancestor scopes.\nIf you want it to change please use an object instead. You can do something like ng-model=\"data.newNickname\" and it will work.\nIf you still think there is a problem  please create a codepen example that reproduces the issue.\n. I've updated your example:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/mJeada\nIf you use an object and bind the parameters to it it will work fine.\n. No problem! I think it can be confusing as well :)\n. Thanks @yujilow1220 !\nWe will investigate this.\n. This is a bit broad. Please make a more specific issue that we can address.\n. @andipavllo Can you explain this and give an example?\n. I need  an example that reproduces the issue.\n. @andipavllo Could you fix the tests so they always pass?\n. @andipavllo Carousel tests seem to work fine. Please fix the sliding menu tests, only the first one is working.\n. @andipavllo Can you resolve conflicts please?\n. Thanks! Will merge now\n. Hi! Do you mean popping to the first page?\nYou can use navigator.resetToPage('page.html') to reset to a specific page. The page stack will be removed.\n. Hi @gtsopour !\nCan you please explain in more detail? What component are you talking about?\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks! We'll look into this.\n@oransel Could you make an example on Codepen and describe the expected behavior? \n. @oransel This has been fixed now. Thanks for the bug report.\n. @anatoo: Thanks! I will review it later today!\n. @anatoo I can't find any problems. Merging.\n. @JcDenton86 That's a good idea! We'll consider this.\n. Since you already wrote the code, please feel free to submit a pull request\n:)\n2015/05/14 20:14 \"JcDenton86\" notifications@github.com:\n\nBased on the assumption that an Android mobile device has the word Mobile\nin the user agent string while an Android tablet doesn't, I created two\nfunctions that return true or false accordingly.\nisAndroidPhone: function isAndroidPhone() {\n      return /Mobile/i.test(navigator.userAgent);\n   },\nisAndroidTablet: function isAndroidTablet() {\n     return !/Mobile/i.test(navigator.userAgent);\n   },\nThat's how I am doing it right now (until you add it in Onsen)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/653#issuecomment-102005675.\n. Thanks @paulhovey !\n\nActually we have no plans to support FireOS right now. Right now we are focusing on iOS, Android and Windows Phones.\nOf course we would appreciate pull requests that fix issues on FireOS.\n. Thanks @anatoo ! I couldn't find anything strange so I'm merging this.\n. Thank you @dsuket ! I will fix this.\n. @dsuket This has been fixed now. Thanks for reporting!\n. @frankdiox Is this done?\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks @anatoo !\nLooks good! I couldn't find anything and it works fine.\n. @frankdiox This PR has gone stale. Can you please resolve the conflicts?\nAlso, is this finished? In that case I will merge.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! Will merge now.\n. Thanks @PrabhdeepSingh ! We will fix this bug.\n. Hi @danish-jamil !\nWe will add scroll bars in a later version. It's not planned in the next version but maybe the one after that. I will close this issue since there is already one about scroll bars.\n. Thanks for reporting @andreupifarre. We will investigate this.\n. Hi @manishparakhiya !\nCould you please make an example on Codepen that reproduces this bug?\n. @andipavllo Can you please resolve conflicts? When that is done I will merge.\n. Hi @zack24q !\nYou need to define function in your delegate object. Please check the docs.\n. Thanks! This looks like a bug. I will fix it.\n. Thanks @zack24q ! It should only execute once for every item so we will investigate this issue.\n. Hi @filipefreitas82 !\nThe issue in your post was due to a bug. It has been fixed so it should work in the next version.\n. Hi @filipefreitas82 ! I think this happens because of a bug in the native implementation of Web Components in Chrome.\nAre you using Chrome?\nBefore loading onsenui.js, please try adding the following code in a script tag:\njavascript\ndocument.registerElement = undefined;\nThis will override the native implementation and instead use a polyfill to implement the Custom Element API.\nActually, right now there are some bugs in Chrome that makes custom elements incompatible with AngularJS. We will probably add this line by default until we are happy with the native implementation.\n. Hi! \n@DILEEP-YADAV You can use <ons-navigator> instead to get the same effect. Please check the docs.\n. Thanks @DILEEP-YADAV !\nWe will try making the docs better. Please tell us where it's incorrect and we will fix it. Also, since this is an open source project please feel free to fix it yourself.\nThe docs are generated from comments in the framework/ directory.\nYou can also change the guide in the website repo:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/onsen.io\n. Hi @Asit1989 !\nI don't really understand what you are trying to do. Do you want the text size to automatically decrease if the content is more than one line? This is not supported so you would need to write some code if you want to do this.\n. Thanks @andipavllo !\n. Merged. Thanks @andipavllo !\n. @andipavllo This closes #688, right?\n. @frankdiox Looks great! Could you also add this to the Changelog?\n. Thanks! Will merge now.\nEDIT: Just kidding. Please fix conflicts @frankdiox .\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Hi @0505gonzalez !\nThe previous behavior was a bit strange so now it will be disabled if it has the disabled attribute regardless of its value. So now you can use ng-disabled instead:\n<ons-button ng-disabled=\"!isFormFilledIn\">Sign in</ons-button>\nSorry about the breakage but I believe this is a more consistent behavior. If you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask.\n. @andipavllo Is there some way you can extend this test to see if Hammer has been correctly initialized?\n. @frankdiox Please add this to the Changelog\n. \n. Hi @boxbag !\nSorry for the late reply. Did you change the codepen? The button is clickable for me.\nI will close this issue, but if you feel there is a bug please open it again with more information.\n. @andipavllo This file has tabs. Please fix.\n. Thanks @andipavllo !\n. Looks good!\n. Thanks @zack24q ! We will check this out. \nIf this solves the bug, don't hesitate to create a PR with the changes.\n. @andipavllo Please fix the issues in the comments.\n. @anatoo\u3055\u3093\u3001\u304a\u6642\u9593\u306e\u3042\u308b\u3068\u304d\u306b\u3053\u306ePR\u3092\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\n<ons-switch>\u3067<input type=\"checkbox\">\u3068\u540c\u3058\u52d5\u4f5c\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u305f\u3068\u3048\u3070\nvar switch = document.querySelector('ons-switch');\nswitch.checked = true;\n\u3092\u51fa\u304d\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\n. @andipavllo Looks great!

I'm really sorry for the late reply.\nYes, it looks like the element isn't displayed because of the translation. I will try to fix this.\n. Hi again @zumbrunnen !\nActually I don't think this is an issue. You should put the pull hook inside the tabbar page and it will work fine.\nI forked the example and made a simple change:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/VLyQmG\n. @andipavllo Please also test the createdCallback code. It should test if the content is correctly assigned to el.template and that the nodes are removed from the DOM.\n.

Thanks @frankdiox !\nGreat job @zack24q ! Merged.\n. Hi @zhuangperola !\nPlease try adding the following rule:\ncss\nons-list-item[disabled] {\n  pointer-events: none;\n}\n. Hi @zhuangperola !\nYes, I agree there should be a disabled attribute so I added it in this commit:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/3d2aa0b3a76ba1f0f724bae61ef50ac7f6005a5c\nThanks for pointing it out :)\n. @salztorte @andreupifarre \nIt seems like this behavior is only present on Mobile Safari. @andreupifarre are you using iOS?\nI've added an lock-on-drag attribute to <ons-list-item>. Please check it out. If there's no problem we will merge it shortly.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. I'll check it out!\n. It fails on iOS. I will investigate this.\nI still think we need to do something different than copying innerHTML since createdCallback will be called far too many times for nested elements.\n. @anatoo This implementation works.\n. Thanks @andipavllo !\n. Looks great! Thanks @frankdiox \n. Looks great! Merged.\n. Hi @filipefreitas82 ! Thanks for reporting.\nI just tried with the latest build and wasn't able to reproduce this issue. Could you please create an example on Codepen?\n. Thanks @filipefreitas82 !\nLooks like it isn't related to <ons-lazy-repeat>. This would happen for a normal list item as well.\nThe problem is that two click events are generated, one for the checkbox and one for the label. You can fix it by catching and stopping propagation for the checkbox event:\nhtml\n<input ng-click=\"$event.stopPropagation()\" ...\nI forked an updated your Codepen example:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/OVzdWY\n. Hi @ta2xeo !\nWe've updated the polyfill to a newer version. Can you test the master branch again and see if it works?\n. Hi @ta2xeo !\nSorry for the delay. I've added a CustomEvent polyfill now. Does it work for you now?\n. Thanks @ta2xeo !\n. Thanks @zhuangperola ! We'll take a look at this.\n. I will close this now. @zhuangperola If you can create a small example that reproduces this please send a link and reopen the issue.\n. @frankdiox Can you solve conflicts?\n. @frankdiox I'll check it out now.\n. @frankdiox Works great!\n. Can you also test the active attribute?\n. Oh, I see. Yeah, maybe it's better to test it in the ons-tab spec.\n. @andipavllo Tabbar also has 'reactive' event\n. Thanks @andipavllo ! I've merged this now.\n. Looks good!\n. @Wouter33 @salztorte \nWe agree that this is not desirable behavior. We will change it so they will be highlighten on \"tap\" instead of just when you touch them.\n.

Thanks!\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! Merged.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Hi @ablegao !\nThere is an internal element called .ons-scroller__content. Try getting the scroll value from that one instead.\njavascript\nvar scroll = document.querySelector('#scroll_msg > .ons-scroller__content').scrollTop;\nI made a simple example: http://codepen.io/argelius/pen/gpvGvE\n. Thanks @condorman !\nWe'll take a look at this.\n. @condorman \nI'm closing this since it looks like it's only an issue in the emulator. If it occurs in physical devices as well please reopen it.\n. Glad you were able to solve it! (:\n. Thanks @andipavllo !\n. @frankdiox Can you solve the conflicts?\n. @anatoo Thanks! Looks great!\n. Thanks @leoxy520 ! We'll check this out.\n. @frankdiox Sorry, commented in a strange place.\nCan you add a unit test for this method?\n. @anatoo Thanks!\nI will review it as soon as I can!\n. @anatoo Looks great! Merged.\n. Hi @DeonKuhn !\nI don't really understand what the problem is. Is one of the examples not working anymore?\nCould you please create an example on Codepen that reproduces this?\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks @knight9999!\nWe will fix this.\n. @andipavllo Please commit the fix only.\n. Thanks @andipavllo!\n. Hi @murliatdure !\nCould you please a Codepen example reproducing this issue?\nYou can fork one of our examples here: http://codepen.io/onsen/\n. Hi!\nRight now there is no way to replace the delegate object. However, I think you can modify your delegate to account for the filtering.\nI made a super simple example:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/VLdGxZ\nYou can search the list of countries with the text input at the bottom.\n. @Wouter33 We'll add a way to recalculate the height since currently it's hard to use with dynamic lists that have variable height items like headers.\n. @Wouter33 @filipefreitas82 \nI made some tests with recalculating the heights when the number of items change. I did some profiling and realized that as long as the method that calculates the heights is reasonably simple there won't be any performance issue.\nThe user would have to scroll pretty far down in order for it to be slow.\nIt's implemented in this branch:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/tree/release-1.3.8\nAn example with dynamic list and variable height elements (+cute cats!):\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/OVBdmM\nI will run some more tests and if I don't find any big performance issues I will release this tomorrow.\nOne caveat: This will only work if the number of items change is changed.\n. @marianoarga \nThe branch does not exist anymore so the example stopped working. I have updated to the latest version now:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/OVBdmM\nIn this example lazy repeat is used with variable height and dynamic updates.\n. We're currently implementing Material Design. Stay tuned for updates! :)\n. Hi @DILEEP-YADAV !\nWe're currently implementing Material Design for Onsen UI. Please keep an eye on the master branch. We will also announce it on our blog.\n. Thanks @anatoo! Will merge now.\n. Hi @ThatoMokhomong !\nThanks! We're actually currently implementing Material Design. Stay tuned :)\nFor the tabs, you can put them on top with the position=\"top\" attribute. If you use that attribute only on Android devices you should get the desired effect.\n. Hi @murliatdure !\nThere already is an infinite scroll component: ons-lazy-repeat.\n. Hi @murliatdure !\nPlease ask questions like this on Stack Overflow and provide a code example.\n. Hi! The style is slightly different for Android and iOS. Is that what you mean.\nA dialog with rounded corner doesn't fit well into an Android app.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks a lot! This fix landed in\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/e50b4c497bbb3ffb1676c5f3c97821e3dac48118\n. https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/910\n. Hi @carlbaubau !\nCurrently, on the master branch we are using a modified version of Hammer. This is based on an older version that has hold instead of press so the <ons-gesture-detector> will not work with press.\nWe have renamed the Hammer object in order to avoid conflicts if another version is loaded.\nIf you want to use Hammer 2 with Onsen UI 1.3.x you need to rename the variable. However, we will release a version with a renamed Hammer object shortly.\n. Thank you @frankdiox !\n. Hi @murliatdure !\nCan you please create an example that reproduces this? It looks like the navigator element is destroyed.\n. Hi @amirmamaghani !\nCan you try moving the template tags outside of the <ons-page> tag?\n. Thanks @amirmamaghani !\nCould you please create an example on Codepen? I'll try to see why it fails.\n. Why do you need the templates inside the navigator?\n. Hi @aneesv !\nWe removed it since it was an undocumented feature. We might decide to reimplement it in the future.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to implement using a directive:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/mJQJyY\n```\nangular.module('app', [])\n  .directive('infiniteScroll', function() {\n    return {\n      restrict: 'A',\n      link: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n        var content = element[0].querySelector('.page__content');\n    content.addEventListener('scroll', function() {\n      if (content.scrollTop + 50 > content.scrollHeight - content.offsetHeight) {\n        scope.$evalAsync(attrs.infiniteScroll);\n      }\n    });\n  }\n};\n\n});\n```\n. Thank you @frankdiox !\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Hi @bahrinb ! Can you please create an example that reproduces this issue?\n. Thank you @frankdiox !\n. Thanks @andipavllo !\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. I agree. This feature is very important for all apps with an input element at the bottom bar.\nWe will definitely add it :)\n. We would love to support Meteor but none of us has any experience with it. Right now we are focusing on React and Angular2 but it might happen in the future :)\n. I'll close this and make a new one.\n. Created new PR: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/876\n. Thanks @mork80 @john156 !\nThis sounds like a serious bug. We will try to find it but actually we don't have access to a S6 device right now.\nIf you guys are able to find the CSS that triggers this we would love to get a pull request! :)\nBy the way, are you running Crosswalk?\n. @anatoo: \u4fee\u6b63\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u306e\u3067\u30de\u30fc\u30b8\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Agree this looks better since we have a lot of them.\n. Thanks a lot for the fix @Hirbod ! This is really helpful. :)\nSince it's a significant performance boost I will implement this as soon as I have time.\n. Hi!\nYou can use ons.platform.isIOS(). It's using User-agent sniffing though so if the User-agent string is spoofed it will return the incorrect value.\nIt's using this code:\nreturn /iPhone|iPad|iPod/i.test(navigator.userAgent);\n. Thanks a lot!\nYou mean white screen during inertial scroll, right? I'd love to find a way to fix that. The iOS WebView doesn't seem to do any rendering during the inertial scrolling (probably to ensure a smooth scroll animation). I've tried to find a way to force rendering during scrolling but didn't have any success.\nThe only way I found was to emulate scrolling but we like to use the native scrolling if possible.\n. That's a great speed improvement. Will definitely add the debouncing.\nAlso thanks for the tip about the device plugin. We will change ons.platform methods to use that and only fall back to user-agent if it's not present.\n. Hi @yesman99 !\nSorry for the delay. I was on vacation. The reason why this happens is that the <ons-pull-hook> overrides the default scroll behavior.\nIf you stop propagation of the touchmove event at the <ons-scroller> element you should be able to scroll it in both directions.\nYou can do something like this if you still want to be able to use the pull hook when the <ons-scroller> is at the top scroll position:\njavascript\nons.ready(function() {\n  document.querySelector('#scroller > .ons-scroller__content');\n    .addEventListener('touchmove', function(event) {\n      if (scroller.scrollTop > 0) {\n        event.stopPropagation();\n      }\n    });\n});\n. @yesman99 I'm glad you were able to solve it! :)\n. Thanks @ramingar !\nIt should definitely just count the direct descendants. I have fixed this and it will be included in the next release.\n. Thanks @tunacoder ! We will investigate this issue.\n. @tunacoder: I've released a new version where the ons.notification.* functions work even if debug info is disabled.\nPlease try it out. I will close this but if you're still having issues please open this again.\n. Moved to the main repo: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/881\n. @jackchuka Thanks! I made some changes.\nI will merge this if you don't have any more changes to make.\n. https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/893\n. https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/892\n. https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/886\n. https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/889\n. @Hirbod Sorry for the late reply. I have been on vacation the last two weeks.\nI ran some tests with iOS 8.4 without any issues so I will close this.\n. https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/883\n. https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/933\n. https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/932\n. Thanks @dineshprodapt ! \n@frankdiox That fix is to prevent scrolling the page while the transition animation is running on iOS.\nI have changed so it only stops touchmove since that's the one that causes the scrolling. If there's no trouble we can include this in the next release.\n. Thanks @pancitjef !\nIt seems like if the animation is delayed it's possible to push two pages. We will try to fix this. In the meanwhile, you can do something like this:\n<ons-navigator ng-init=\"pushing = false\" ons-prepush=\"pushing = true\" ons-postpush=\"pushing = false\">\nAnd on the button you can disable the button so it's not possible to click it twice:\n<ons-button\n  ng-click=\"myNavigator.pushPage('page2.html');\"\n  ng-disabled=\"pushing\">\n  Push Page 2\n</ons-button>\n. This bug also affected <ons-tabbar>.

Should it bring the page closest to the top?\nMaybe not a common scenario but they might push the same template page but with different content. Should we also support navigator.bringToTop(index) where index is an integer?\n. Thanks for reporting @c58 !\nThis looks like a bug. We will investigate it.\n. @logicweb Thanks for the screenshot!

Thank you @anatoo!\nI will review <ons-splitter> and this PR on Monday.\n. Thanks @anatoo and @frankdiox !\nI found no problems so I will merge this now.\n. Thanks @Hirbod ! I will close this issue as well.\n@c58 Please open it again if the problem persists. However, I think this is also related to broken ~ behavior.\n. @c58 Thanks for the fix! Could you please provide a simple example that reproduces this bug so I can confirm it before merging?\n. Thanks a lot @c58 ! I will take a look at this.\n. Thanks for this fix @c58 !\nSorry for being late. We had a holiday this week but I'm back now. Will take a look at this tomorrow or early next week.\n. Thanks @c58 ! I've solved this in a slightly different way. Could you please verify that the flickering is gone?\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/6c0dca0c57cba93ef3b96acd01885b3892a1d019\n. Thanks @c58 ! I will open this again.\n. Thanks @synapse !\nWe will investigate this. It would be great if you could supply a source code example that reproduces this bug.\n. Hi! I can not find the discussion about this bug anymore. Could you paste an example of the bug that this solves?\nIf there is no problem I will merge tomorrow.\n. I made some tests on iOS7 and iOS8 without any trouble. Will merge this.\n. Thanks for the suggestion @JcDenton86 ! The Snackbar is definitely an important component.\nActually the Snackbar has been implemented in a separate branch. It's still work in progress but will be merged pretty soon\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/850\n. There were some issues with the implementation so we decided to remake it. It will probably be added in 2.1.0.\n. Thanks a lot @astanecki !\nThis applies to some other docs as well so I will update those later as well.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! Will take a look at this.\n. Thanks @anatoo! I have confirmed this so I will merge it.\nI agree this is better and it will not break backwards compatibility.\n. @frankdiox I couldn't find any problems so I will merge this.\n. Thanks @anatoo! Looks great. I can't find any problems so I will merge it now.\n. @sofish We have made a new repo for bower now.\n. @anatoo I will merge this if there is no problem\n. Thanks @anatoo !\n. Thanks!\n. Hi @davidwahl !\nThanks for the fix :)\nWe could implement this for the fullscreen carousel since it makes sense that the items that are not shown are hidden.\n. @andipavllo Reassigned to you\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! Let's use this for the next release. I think we also need to tag old versions in this repo. Can you do that?\nAlso, could you add some documentation for this to README.md?\n. @frankdiox Please put the documentation in this repo but also write a README.md in the other repo.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Hi @eljavidelomas !\nCan you make a small example that reproduces this?\nHow are you using the carousel? Is it a full screen carousel?\n. Thanks @Hirbod !\nI will investigate the behavior on iOS.\n. Thanks @anatoo! I changed the english message a bit. Will merge now.\n. Thanks @anatoo!\n. Thanks @anatoo!\nI will merge this now.\n. Hi @igordelorenzi !\nWhat version of Onsen UI are you using? I have tried this in Chrome 45 but could not reproduce it.\nCan you create an example on Codepen that reproduces this issue? Does it happen on other versions of Chrome or just 45?\n. Hi @lkaragol !\nThanks for pointing this out. The ROADMAP.md file is very out of date.\nActually we have started publishing upcoming features in the blog so I will remove the file and the link to it. We will keep announcing new features and publish the current roadmap in the blog.\n. Hi!\nIn what way is it not working? Does it not display at all? Does it work without loading Onsen UI?\nCould you try using Crosswalk instead of the native WebView?\n. Thanks @danfador !\nDoes this only happen when you have loaded Onsen UI?\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks! :+1: \n. This looks good. I have no objections! :+1: \n. @anatoo: Please merge this if there is no problems.\n. Thanks @anatoo!\n. Implemented the design and fixed the ons.notification.* methods.\n@anatoo\nI'm not sure about the classnames:\nRight now it's like this:\nalert-dialog--material-title--one\nBut I think this is better:\nalert-dialog-title--material--one\nOr even this:\nalert-dialog--material__title--one\n. @anatoo I changed the class names.\nPlease merge if there are no problems.\n. Looks good! Merged.\n. Ok! I will implement like this.\n. @andipavllo Sure, go ahead.\n. @anatoo Please merge this if there are no problems.\n. Thanks @maooson ! :)\nThat's a good idea! We will consider adding this in a later version.\n. @andipavllo Can you please write an example that reproduces this?\n. @salztorte Super sorry for the late reply.\nI looked at this today and it seems like there is an issue if you put overflow: hidden; on the container element.\nCan you try adding overflow: visible; to the container?\nSo if you have a <ons-list> with ons-lazy-repeat you can do something like this:\ncss\nons-list[ons-lazy-repeat] {\n  overflow: visible;\n}\n. I will release a better fix soon.\n. @anatoo Looks great! Merged.\n. Can you check again? It doesn't work on master for me.\n. @andipavllo I have fixed this now so please ignore it.\n. @anatoo \ngulp build will now generate:\n- onsenui.js - Web Components\n- angular-onsenui.js Angular bindings\nand minified versions of both.\nI have updated all the places where the files are imported: demos, protractor tests and patterns.\nPlease merge if there are no problems.\n. Thanks @anatoo!\n. Thanks! :)\n. Hi @Hirbod !\nI would love to fix this bug but I can't find any way to reproduce it. I've made some sample apps with tabs, navigators, menus but to no avail.\nHowever, looking at the behavior of your app I can at least guess what's going on.\nI need to know some things. Can you inspect the page and see what rules are in place?\nI want to know the top value of the .page__content class and its paddingTop value.\nThere are three rules that should affect the element:\n``` css\n.page__status-bar-fill ~ ons-toolbar ~ .page__content {\n    top: 64px;\n    padding-top: 0px;\n}\n.page__status-bar-fill ~ .page__content {\n    padding-top: 20px;\n}\nons-toolbar ~ .page__content {\n    top: 44px;\n}\n```\nIt looks like when your bug is triggered the first two rules are not working while the third one is, since it's still pushed down 44px.\nLet's try patching it by using adjacent sibling selectors instead:\n```\n.page__status-bar-fill + ons-toolbar + .page__background + .page__content {\n  top: 64px;\n  padding-top: 0px;\n}\n.page__status-bar-fill + .page__background + .page__content {\n  padding-top: 20px;\n}\n```\nCould you please try these rules? If they work fine I will add them and release a new version since this is a pretty big deal.\n. @Hirbod Sorry for the slow response time. Just woke up a few hours ago. :)\nSince the adjacent sibling selectors seem to work, I will release a version that implements these changes.\n. @Hirbod: I will change the other ~ selectors as well. Thanks a lot for the assistance! :)\n. @frankdiox: Does this not cause a memory leak?\n. @frankdiox Ok. Are you working on fixing the memory leak?\nIf not, please create an issue so we know how to reproduce it.\n. Thanks @andipavllo !\nCan you also remove the methods that don't exist? E.g. show() does not exist for splitter. Please try all the derived methods so they work fine.\n. Looks good! Thanks @andipavllo \n. Thanks @andipavllo !\n. @anatoo: Could you take a look at this when you have time?\n. Thanks @anatoo!\n. I will redo this later.\n. Hi @Hirbod !\nI think this is a good idea. \nBy \"max visible items\" I take it you mean that if there are currently 5 items displayed, it should slide to the next 5 items (if they exist, otherwise to the maximum index)?\n. Thanks a lot @Hirbod !\nSorry for the late response. CodePen changed something on their side. It should be working now (or in 15 minutes since CloudFront cache must be updatet).\n. @Hirbod @andipavllo I will take a look at this.\n. @Hirbod: I have merged a fix. It's a bit different from your proposed fix but I don't want to add the transform except when absolutely necessary to avoid issues with transformed children.\n. Thanks @andipavllo !\n. Thanks @anatoo. I can take a look at this.\n. @anatoo I broke something when updating dependencies. I have fixed it now.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! Please work on solving these bugs since it should work in these browsers as well.\n. @frankdiox Sorry for not replying to this. I forgot.\nI think this has been fixed in 23d737ceb8f26e0dfa8db9006578aaf6ed6504b2\n. I'll take a look at this.\n. @frankdiox I think this is fixed now. Can you verify?\n. @frankdiox Actually I was unable to reproduce the pageinit error. What browser and what version are you running?\n. Thanks for reporting @pressentir !\nWe will investigate this bug.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks @anatoo! I will take a look at this.\n. Thanks for reporting! We will fix this.\n. Thanks @leocaseiro ! We will take a look.\n. @frankdiox Can you take a look at this?\n. Thanks a lot @jondavidjohn !\nI have fixed the promise polyfill as well as some other scripts where module.exports was changed.\nI released a new version (2.0.0-alpha.7) and tried with the following script:\n``` javascript\nvar onsen = require('onsenui/js/onsenui');\nonsen.ready(function() {\n  onsen.notification.alert({message: 'Onsen UI works with browserify!'});\n});\n```\nAnd browserified with:\nbash\n$ browserify main.js -o bundle.js -d\nwhich worked fine when I ran it in the browser.\nThere are still some issues with polluting the global scope that I will address later. It will require a pretty (very) large refactor but I will do it in the coming days.\nBy the way, we have renamed some files: ons-core.js has been renamed to onsenui.js while we have split the AngularJS code from onsenui.js into angular-onsenui.js.\nPlease report any other issues you might find! It's really appreciated :)\n. I have closed this, but please feel free to open it again.\n. Hi @Saurabh995 !\nThat's really weird. Is it possible for you to create an example that reproduces this? Preferably on codepen.io but just pasting a runnable example here works as well.\nI need to check if some classes or CSS rules changed when the date picker was displayed. Maybe there is a transform working?\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Hi @jondavidjohn !\nSorry for the late reply. It's true that the list tags will do some DOM manipulation when they are added since they are Web Components. However, I didn't have any trouble integrating them with React.\nWould it be possible for you to create a simple example that reproduces this error?\n. Thanks a lot @jondavidjohn ! I will take a look a this either today or tomorrow.\n. I'm really sorry for being late. I was travelling last week so I wasn't able to do a lot of work.\nThanks a lot for your investigation. We will keep working on React support and we want Onsen UI 2.0 to play nicely with React when we release the stable version.\n. Thanks for the report @githubkyo !\nCan you explain exactly what you mean. Can you create an example on codepen that reproduces this?\n. @d3orn \nCan you try overriding with the following rules?\n```\n.page__status-bar-fill + ons-toolbar + .page__background + .page__content {\n  top: 64px;\n  padding-top: 0px;\n}\n.page__status-bar-fill + .page__background + .page__content {\n  padding-top: 20px;\n}\n``\n. That's great! :+1: \n. Thanks @anatoo ! Looks good\n. It's easy to just add anoverflow-y: scroll` rule so I don't think this is an issue.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\nCan you also add this to the Changelog.\nI think you can also detect iOS version with this plugin so can you add that as well: https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.0.0/cordova/device/device.version.html\n. Yes, testing this in Chrome is hard. You could mock the plugin though. I will merge it anyway. Thanks :)\n. Looks great! Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks for testing this @Hirbod !\nIf there's no way to make it performant with translate3d on iOS, I guess we need to remake it.\nIt will probably not happen right now but we can add it in the next minor version. I think in that case we will not replace this component but instead make a new one and deprecate this one.\n. I can take a look at this.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks @anatoo ! Looks like we must implement it in JavaScript.\n. It can be reproduced in this sample. Ripple effect for the child elements is broken.\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/demo/ripple/index.html\n. Thanks for reporting @tachu ! We will fix this.\n@frankdiox Can you take a look at this? You maybe need to update the tags.\n. Looks good! Thanks!\n. I tested building with Crosswalk and it's still super slow. I think this has very high priority so I will start working on it today.\n. Hi @d3orn !\nWe have added a material toolbar with a shadow. We will make it react to scroll since that is the native behaviour. Unfortunately that can't be done in pure CSS so we need to do it with JavaScript.\nAbout your problem. The thing you're seeing is probably the semi-transparent mask making the shadow darker than it usually is.\nTry using the simpleslide animation instead for an animation without a mask. Unfortunately there is no easy way to hide the mask since it doesn't have a class name so we can't hide it with CSS.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! These looks great. I made some small changes. Mainly I updated the material icons to latest version and used them instead.\n. Thanks @anatoo!\n. Thanks @anatoo! I will merge this now.\n. It should only include one of them.\n. I removed the automatic \"android\" modifier. I didn't add the \"material\" modifier. However, I think there should be a way to automatically get a Material layout on Android.\n. Thanks @andipavllo !\n. Yes, please release a patch to fix this bug @frankdiox .\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! Works great.\n. Hi @Bjoern3003 !\nWhat device are you running? Are you running as a Cordova application or a website?\n. Thanks @andipavllo ! Will merge and deploy website again.\n. Thanks @frankdiox! I think this looks good.\n. Hi @eidorianyeo ! Thanks for the report.\nCan you provide some code that reproduces this issue?\n. Hi @eidorianyeo @kenprice!\nI've been busy the last two weeks. I will check out this bug as soon as I have time. Probably early next week since I'm travelling.\n. Ok, that's good.\n. Thanks @d3orn ! We will investigate this.\n. @andipavllo Can you investigate this and release a patch if you solve it?\n. Hi @luposlip! Thanks a lot for trying out the beta. It's really appreciated :)\nActually we made a decision to create the <ons-splitter> element to replace the <ons-sliding-menu> as well as the <ons-spli-view> elements. Right now there are some features missing that exist for the sliding menu. We will work on adding these missing features.\nIs it possible for you to use <ons-splitter> in your app? If you're having some trouble using it, please report it and we can work together to fix it.\nThe reason we created the <ons-splitter> is to solve some issues users were having. The two biggest issues were:\n- Using both <ons-split-view> and <ons-sliding-menu> in the same app.\n- Having menus on both the left and right side.\nIf the demand is high, we will considering releasing a sliding menu component that is not dependent on Angular. However, we prefer improving the <ons-splitter> to make it as good as possible.\n. @jgauna @luposlip \nI made a super simple example.\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/vLEBPZ\nThe menu is toggled by selecting the <ons-splitter-side> element and calling the toggle() method:\njavascript\nconst toggleMenu = () => {\n  document.getElementById('menu').toggle();\n};\nhtml\n<ons-toolbar-button \n  onclick=\"toggleMenu()\" \n  modifier=\"material\">\n  <ons-icon icon=\"md-menu\"></ons-icon>\n</ons-toolbar-button>\n. @luposlip We made some components for React:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/react-onsenui\nHave you tried them out? There is a side menu in this app: http://onsenui.github.io/react-onsenui-kitchensink/demo.html\n. Is the var attribute necessary? Both React and Angular2 have ways to access to components and for jQuery I think it's more natural to just select:\n$('#menu')[0].open()\nThe var attribute will pollute the global scope. If we're going to use it I think it's better to attach to ons.something.varname.\nWhat do you think @anatoo?\n. I agree that it's not necessary so I will close this PR.\n. I think this looks good!\n. @luposlip @frankdiox I removed the reference to the source map.\n. Hi @fabricelepro !\nWe're actually not supporting the Android 2.3 WebView. We try to support Android from 4.0 and later and recommend using the Crosswalk library. All animations will be a lot smoother in Crosswalk.\nCordova performance is extremely flaky in the Android 2.3 webview and Crosswalk is only supported from Android 4.0 and later. If there is just some unsupported JavaScript code we might release a patch for it. Don't expect smooth performance though. :)\nYou're welcome to submit a PR that solves the issue or we will take a look at it when we have time.\n. Looking at your error I think it might be an issue with the CustomElements.js polyfill.\n. Thanks for the report! We will investigate it.\n. Thanks @luposlip ! We will investigate this. Seems like it doesn't detect the platform correctly.\n. @luposlip By the way, does this happen on a real device? Maybe the version is not detected correctly because it's running in the simulator.\n. Thanks @d3orn !\nReturning a promise with shouldStatusBarFill() makes sense if we need to wait for deviceready. Looking forward to the PR :)\n. I agree!\n. @anatoo I agree that we should remove the android modifier.\n. @anatoo @frankdiox I like it! :)\nAlso, I think we should have promises for ons.notification methods.\n. I agree with this!\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks @d3orn !\nI will remake the layout of the the material toolbar to make it more close to the spec. I also noticed there is a problem with the size of the buttons. I will add some padding to the buttons to make the clickable area larger and also add active class.\n. @d3orn I have rewritten the CSS for the material toolbar so it's more consistent with the Material Design spec.\nNow there will always be at least 72px to the left of the center element and I've also changed the size of the buttons and added some styles for the :active pseudo-class so it reacts on touch.\nBy the way, you will automatically get a material icon for the back button if you use <ons-back-button> inside a material toolbar so there's no need to add the icon.\n. @anatoo Looks good! Merged.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! Looks good\n. @anatoo \nI made some minor changes to the styles. Also I removed the ons-icon--ion class since it makes it very hard to center the icons vertically.\nI also removed this inline style:\n<ons-icon icon=\"ion-cloud\" style=\"font-size: 28px; line-height: 34px; vertical-align: top;\"></ons-icon>\nsince this didn't work for Material Icons.\nI will merge if you are OK with these changes.\n. Hi @gazxm \nCan you please provide some code that reproduces this behavior?\n. @d3orn I think it's fixed now :)\n. @frankdiox Can you also write tests that confirm that the regression is fixed? I mean, test that the attribute actually works for some element.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! Can you fix the conflict?\n. This looks good. I will review it and merge if there's no problems. I made a new branch and opened a new PR so I will close this one.\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/1081\n. Hi @DILEEP-YADAV !\nWe are not currently working on a tool like this and it's not something we currently have planned.\n. Thanks @snito ! Looks great! :)\n. This fix landed in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/f12221c6026ff20c38d4039dd27d79a02d0fe762\n. We have made scrollbars visible on all browsers by default now so I will close this.\n. @anatoo This solves an issue where the iframes on the CSS components page will be displayed incorrectly because the CSS is loaded in the incorrect order.\nI will just merge it since I don't think it will break anything.\n. @d3orn I've merged your fixed and also made some tests. I had to also change som CSS to make the status bar filling work nicely with material tabs and toolbar.\n. Thanks for reporting @jondavidjohn ! We will investigate this behavior.\n. @letmejustfixthatohitsbroken We are working on them right now. Hopefully we'll have them done in a few weeks. :)\n. Thanks @d3orn !\nI have confirmed this bug. We haven't tested Material Design extensively on iOS since it's mainly for Android. Sorry about that.\nOf course it should render nicely on iOS as well so I will take a look at this.\n. Thanks for reporting @aliv !\nWe will investigate this behavior.\n. Hi @istvano !\nYou can use both Onsen UI and Onsen UI 2.0 to make mobile web pages. We test it on Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Recently we're also trying to support IE/Edge better.\nIf you have any issues on a modern desktop browser, please report them.\n. Hi @kountouretis !\nThere is no built-in feature like this. However, you can put those buttons yourself and wire them up with the carousel.\n. Hi @kountouretis !\nI don't really understand what you mean. Can you provide an example? You need to hide the popover manually with popover.hide(). When you don't need it anymore you can destroy it with popover.destroy().\n. @kountouretis I made a simple example where you can click a button inside the popover to close it.\n``` html\n\nShow\n\n\n\n    I am a popover! :)\n    Hide\n\n\n```\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/OMPLrQ\n. I read your issue again. Are you assuming that the popover will close automatically when you navigate to another page?\nThere is no such feature so you need to hide it manually. Also you need to destroy it when the page that spawned it is destroyed to avoid memory leaks.\nTo close the popover and navigate to another page you can do: \nhtml\n<button onclick=\"popover.hide(); myNavigator.pushPage('page.html');\">\n. @kountouretis You only need to include onsenui.css, onsenui.js and onsen-css-components.css to use the popover.\nI made a simple example using only pure JavaScript and no AngularJS:\nhttp://codepen.io/argelius/pen/zrxxop\nHTML\n``` html\nShow\n\n    I am a popover! :)\n<ons-button onclick=\"popover.hide()\">Hide</ons-button>\n\n\n```\nJavaScript\njs\nwindow.popover = document.getElementById('popover');\n. Can you put your failing code on Codepen?\nAlso, you need to tell us what errors you get, otherwise it will be hard to debug.\n. @kountouretis I don't really understand. Is the code I wrote not working? In that case I need to know what device you are running it on.\n. @kountouretis In that case I don't have any idea what is happening. Do you get any JavaScript errors?\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! I tried it and it seems to work well. I think this is a good tradeoff since we can't increase the hitbox in the x-directiono.\n. @frankdiox Looks good! Will merge now. :+1: \n. I think this is a good idea! :+1: \n. I think this is a good idea! :+1: \n. Yes, maybe we can add this in a later version. I will remove it from the milestone.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Looks good! Can you also add tests for this?\n. Thanks @d3orn !\nCould you verify if the functions are defined or if they are not called? It looks like they should be called since it's fixed by just replacing them.\n. @anatoo I will merge this if there is no problem.\n. Thanks @anatoo !\n. @andipavllo This breaks the behavior if you're only using the CSS components. Please don't remove the :active pseudoclass from the CSS components.\n. @andipavllo I will merge this today since were actually removing the tappable modifier.\n. @andipavllo I have added the \"tappable\" attribute as we discussed in the meeting. This attribute will work nice on iOS. I restored the \"tappable\" modifier so there is still an option if you only use the CSS.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. This looks like a bug. We will take a look.\n@d3orn Your bug reports are highly appreciated! Keep them coming :)\n. Do you mean something like <div ons-ripple></div> ?\nI think that would be good to have as an Angular directive since it makes it easier to use the ripple element in Angular.\n. Sounds great! Please create a PR when you've finished it :+1: \n. @frankdiox Looks great!\n. Thanks @anatoo! This is great :)\nI will look at it tomorrow\n. @anatoo Works great! The code is a lot nicer now :)\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! Can you please solve the conflicts?\n. Thanks @frankdiox!\n. Hi @Hirbod ! \nI can investigate this behavior. Looks like the listener is not correctly removed.\n. Looks great!\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Looks great! Thanks @anatoo :+1: \n. Thanks @bozzmob !\nWe're having an outage right now. Working on fixing it.\n. @bozzmob It has been fixed now. You should be able to access the site in a ~10 minutes. Again, thanks a lot for reporting :)\n. I will do this! :)\n. @themikem @frankdiox \nI agree that we should add padding on the left for lists without the inner divs. There is no way we can add the short borders in this case but you can get long borders using longdivider modifier.\nWe will fix this before releasing the next beta.\nExpanding the left, right, center concept to the headers also sounds good but will probably not happen in this version.\nThe top padding on the headers should default to something that looks like list headers in native apps. In the case you want to change it I think it's better to set it manually since Onsen UI can't anticipate what everyone needs.\n. @themikem \nTo use the inset list you need to also tell the items that the list is inset:\n<div class=\"list list--inset\">\n  <div class=\"list__item list--inset__item\">Item</div>\n</div>\nIf you define it like this there will be no double border.\n. @themikem Making the inset modifier only apply to the list is a good idea. We will consider this. Only problem is the header on the top of the first item so it might be overkill to require list--inset__item on all items.\nFor the headers in your example they are quite different from the normal list headers so I think it might be a better idea to implement them as a separate class.\n. This looks great! I will review it now\n. @anatoo The refresh method doesn't seem to work right now. I made a simple example with a list. When I modify the list and run refresh() the DOM is not re-rendered.\n. @anatoo Sorry for being late. This works fine now so I will merge.\n. @frankdiox I think this is OK, even if it might remove styles added by the user. There is no real use-case where styles needs to be added inline to the <ons-page> element.\n. Yes, I've long been wanting to improve the <ons-lazy-repeat>. Please try to optimize it.\n. Thanks @frankdiox!\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! :+1: \n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks! :+1: \n. Thanks @anatoo !\n. We will not include this in the current version. Possibly in 2.0.1\n. I will close this since we have been unable to reproduce the issue.\n. Thanks @zkorp! I will investigate this.\n. @zkorp I ran your code but couldn't reproduce the bug.\nHow are you running the app? Are you running it in a browser or as a hybrid app? What Android/iOS version are you running?\n. @zkorp That's super strange. I'd really like to debug this but I need your help.\nCan you write the following in the console when the bug has happened?\nconsole.log(ons._internal.isEnabledAutoStatusBarFill(), ons.platform.isWebView(), ons.platform.isIOS7above())\nWhat is the output? \nCan you also check if the window.cordova variable is defined?\n. Thanks @zkorp !\nI think this is only an issue when you emulate iPhone in Chrome. I will close it but feel free to open it again if you feel it needs to be fixed.\n. @wildtang You probably need to write some bindings so that Vue.js reacts correctly when the page is pushed. You can take a look at the bindings for Angular for some inspiration.\nYou need to rewrite the navigator's link function in order to get pushPage to work correctly.\nwindow.OnsNavigatorElement.rewritables.link = function(element, target, callback) {\n  // Do some Vue.js stuff here...\n  callback(target);\n}\n. @wildtang I agree that this is not something that can be solved by the Vue.js. Some bindings must be implemented to make it work.\nThat's why I suggested looking at the AngularJS bindings to get inspiration. Also @frankdiox wrote some super simple code to link Onsen UI 2.0 with Knockout.js:\nhttp://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/RrrXbV\n. @anatoo What do you think about this?\nI think this bundle is a lot better than the one produced by browserify.\n. Thanks @anatoo! I will restore those those imports\n. @anatoo I have restored the import paths. I wrote a simple plugin for Rollup to make it work since it doesn't support module import paths by default.\nIf there's no problem I will merge these changes.\n. Thanks @andipavllo ! I will fix this and release a new version.\n. Hi @danjarvis !\nI'm unable to reproduce this issue in the current master branch. What version are you using?\n. I want to merge this but I see you use ~ selectors. There is a bug in the iOS9 Webview that breaks the behavior of the ~ selector so we can't use it. Is it possible for you to implement this using only + selectors?\n. @pvsong @juspriet We will investigate this behavior.\nCan you give me information on how to reproduce this. Does it happen in a simple app using only a list with pull hook or do you need some special conditions?\nPlease provide all information that you think could be usesul, such as sample code and under what conditions it happens.\n. Thanks @pvsong !\n. I think this has been solved. Please reopen if you're still having issues.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\nWhen you have time, please fix this in 1.3.* and release a new version. Also please fix it in 2.0 if it's also an issue there.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! :)\n. Thank you @frankdiox ! Looks good.\n. If you're using Angular there shouldn't be any difference in Onsen UI 2.0.\n. I will close this for now. Please feel free to open it if you think it's necessary.\n. @cither1 No problem! If you have any other issues, don't hesitate to ask! :)\n. Thanks @IliaSky !\nCan you please also add this to the Changelog?\n. Looks good! Thanks @IliaSky :)\n. I think this looks good :)\n. @frankdiox I think these decisions are sound. I will review this later.\nThere one more thing I want you to do.\nI want the ons.notification.* methods to a promises as well.\nWould be great if you could do \njavascript\nons.notification.confirm('Are your ready to rumble?')\n  .then(\n    function() {\n      ons.notification.alert('Let\\'s do it!');\n    },\n    function() {\n      ons.notification.alert('Oh well.');\n    }\n  );\nThis would be in another PR though.\n. @frankdiox Great! :+1: \n. I like option 1! :)\n. Thanks @bdedardel ! :)\n@frankdiox Also mentioned this and I think he will fix it soon.\n. @frankdiox Codepen loads JS at the end of the body. Can you reproduce it if you move the imports?\n. I believe it is because the Angular code is executed before the Web Components.\n. Oh! I guess the document.registerElement('ons-template', ...) must happen before everything else.\n. Should be working fine now. It was using the global ons._deviceBackButtonDispatcher variable instead of importing it using es6 imports.\n. @frankdiox Actually, I tried master branch after the merge but I'm still having the same issue.\n. Thanks!\n. I like these names better! Thanks :)\n. I think we also need to write tests for all components to verify that they will \"survive\" an operation like this. This means that we can not add anything in the createdCallback which is not encoded in the HTML. \nWe can't add properties or event listeners to the elements but we can change style and add elements since that will be properly encoded in the string.\n. Let's discuss <ons-navigator> next meeting. I think in this case we might be able to handle it when wrapping it in the framework in question.\nI think if we will find other issues while writing Angular 2 and React.js bindings but I think this particular issue solves some of these problems.\n. Great fix! :+1: \n. Thanks @frankdiox !\nJust checked it. Looks great :+1: \n. Thanks @frankdiox ! Looks great :)\n. Thanks @leocaseiro!\nI merged your PR so I will close this.\n. :fish: \n. Thanks @frankdiox! Actually I've been wanting to make this the default behavior so maybe we can discuss this after I come back. I will not merge it now.\nI see no reason why the tabs should not be pre-loaded, it just causes issues like the one you mentioned.\n. @frankdiox \nI talked to @philolo1 about this and I think it might be good if we actually remove the persistent attribute and make preloading the tabs default behavior.\nIt will make it possible to make swiping tabs and it also makes it a lot easier to write bindings for frameworks.\nWhat do you think? Maybe you or @philolo1 can change this PR to do this.\n. Thank you @frankdiox :heart:\n. I just tested this. Works great :+1: \n. Thank you @IliaSky! Makes sense to always have this enabled if it's added by the animator anyway. I will merge this.\n. Thanks @anatoo ! I wasn't able to look at this while in America.\nIt works great so I will merge it now.\n. @IliaSky @corneyl We had a previous report about something similar on Android 4.1. Looks like the browser on 4.1 in some cases have a broken implementation of flexbox... :|\n. @corneyl Great! :)\nAutotprefixer is important because older browsers only support the old version of flexbox.\n. Thanks @IliaSky ! I will make some reviews.\n. @IliaSky The animation looks great! I will do some additional review later.\nI hope to make this component performant since there could be an issue if the developer creates a large list with an <ons-ripple> element attached to each item.\nMaybe you can move some code to the touch event listeners since they will only be called when you touch the element as opposed to doing a lot of work in the initialization phase.\nHave you verified that the animation works well on some older devices? It doesn't have to work great on older Android WebViews but it should be performant on Crosswalk even if the CPU is pretty slow.\n. Thanks @IliaSky ! It looks like the initialization is a lot faster now.\nI agree that GestureDetector is the main bottleneck. There is a large memory overhead since it has to create an instance for each ons-ripple element.\nI tried on my phone with ~100 ripple without problem. When I approach ~300 elements the animations starts to stutter but it's still working. We might revisit this element later to make it faster.\n. @IliaSky By the way, I replaced some comparisons (==) with strict comparison (===) since JavaScript does some strange conversions when you use ==.\n. I will merge this now. Great job!\n. @frankdiox Great! I will merge this :+1: \n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks @anatoo ! This looks a lot better\n. Looks great @frankdiox ! :+1: \n. @IliaSky Is this implementation finished? In that case I will test it and merge it\n. Thanks @IliaSky ! Works great.\nI changed the ripple effect to a box shadow so it doesn't cover the thumb element. I also added a 100ms transition to make it feel nicer.\nActually, I don't really like that it's not activated on hold. It doesn't feel responsive. The native switch will show the ripple as soon as you press the switch. Polymer also does this:\nhttps://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/paper-toggle-button?view=demo:demo/index.html&active=paper-toggle-button\nI will merge this, but when you have time can you please see if you can improve this.\n. @philolo1 I want to merge this. Can you add this to the Changelog and also reword the commit message to make it consistent with other commits?\n. Hi @AlexF12004Roma !\nCan you please paste the code that triggers this error?\n. Can you add this to the Changelog and reword message?\n. Thanks @IliaSky !\nIs this PR finished?\n. This is great! :+1: \n. Hi @billouboq !\nI think there was just some documentation changes. The docs are written as comments to the source, so we need to tag a new version in order to redeploy the docs.\n. Thanks @IliaSky ! Looks good.\n. @IliaSky Can you take a look at this when you have time?\n. Thanks @IliaSky !\nActually the reason why we want the CSS to be usable without the JS library is that it can be used independently. There are users that only use the CSS and write all the JS themselves and we want them to be able to do that.\nThis makes sense because the JS is dependent on the CSS, but if the CSS is dependent on the JS we would get a mutual dependency.\n. Thanks @IliaSky ! Works great now.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! :+1: \n. Thanks @frankdiox ! :+1: \n. @IliaSky I just tested this. Works really well.\nI added so it runs updateScrollbar also when the window is resized. On a mobile device this will only happen when the orientation is changed or when the keyboard is shown so I don't think there will be any performance issues.\n. Thanks @IliaSky !\n. I think it makes sense to add one.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks @philolo1 ! Looks great :+1: \n. Thanks @philolo1!\n. Thanks @IliaSky ! Looks great :)\n. @IliaSky Can you ask someone to check the Japanese translations? I think they don't say the same as the English docs.\nI will merge this when the translations have been fixed.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! Looks good :)\n. Great :+1: \n. Thanks @philolo1 !\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! I will take a look at it tomorrow.\n. Thanks @IliaSky ! :+1: \n. Thanks @anatoo !\nAlso @philolo1 is having some major issues making bindings for React.\nI think we should let the frameworks do all the DOM manipulation. I will try to write some React code today and tomorrow and see if I can figure how we can wrap the <ons-navigator> in a better way and what changes needs to be made.\nBasically for things like managing the page stack och the navigator the frameworks must handle removing and adding the DOM elements but I think we should still leverage the core library for the animations.\n. @anatoo: Oh, I thought there was also a problem when the components make manipulations after init.\nAs @philolo1 is saying, this is already possible by adding _compiled attributed.\n. Thanks!\n. I agree :)\n. This removes the target attribute and attaches event listeners to parent instead of the element itself.\nIt also fixes a bug where the _onRelease method was not called if the user drags outside the element while the animation is running. I added listeners for mouseout and touchleave to cover all cases.\n. @frankdiox You can merge this if it's OK\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! :)\n. Thanks!\n. @philolo1 Please wait, I will take a look at it today.\n. @philolo1 I guess we don't need this anymore so I will close it.\n. @frankdiox Looks good! Can you also add it to the changelog?\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! :+1: \n. Thanks!\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! :+1: \n. Thanks @philolo1 ! :+1: \n. Thanks @frankdiox ! :+1: \n. @philolo1 I will close this now since we merged it to nav_mod.\n. Looks great! Thanks :+1: \n. @frankdiox Thanks for the feedback!\nrewritables.link doesn't make sense in React, neither does pageHTML. React deals with JSX, not HTML. All frameworks we are targeting have their own templating systems so I think we can just leverage those.\nI removed a bunch of code to make it more simple. Things like  triggering events can be put in _pushPage() so they happen regardless of the framework used.\nWe can hook up the Angular bindings to use this instead of rewritables.link as well so I don't know if the link function is necessary at all.\nOne thing I think is nice with this approach is that we can initialize the navigator with any number of pages which can make routing possible and also server side rendering (haven't tried so I'm not sure).\n. @IliaSky This PR is stale. Can you resolve the conflicts?\n. Thanks @IliaSky !\n. Thanks @IliaSky !\n. Thanks! :+1: \n. Thanks @IliaSky !\n. Thanks @IliaSky !\n. @IliaSky I agree that we should remove <ons-scrollbar> since it we will never be able to make it work nicely on iOS and the native scrollbar should be enough.\n. I think this is good :)\n. Great! :+1: \n. I think this is enough! Thanks :+1: \n. Thanks for the fixes! :+1: \n. I merged this into nav_mod instead.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! :+1: \n. Thanks @frankdiox ! Looks good :+1: \n. I'm not familiar with Summernote so unfortunately I can't help you.\nIf you figure out how to fix it please open a PR.\n. @philolo1 It looks like this branch has diverged from master and there are some conflicts. Can you see if you can merge master into this tomorrow and solve the conflicts?\n. I'm merging!\n. Thanks @anatoo!\n. Thanks for reporting @ryanfields ! We will take a look at this.\n. Since we release React components I will close this. Please take a look at this page\n. @anatoo\u3055\u3093\u3001\u9045\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u4eca\u304b\u3089\u898b\u3066\u307f\u307e\u3059\uff01\n. @anatoo It works fine. I also tried it with some React examples and there was no problem.\nThanks! Will merge now :+1: \n. Thank you @anatoo! :+1: \n. Thanks for the fix @zyberspace ! Really appreciated :+1: \n. @puku0x : Thanks for reporting. We will take another look at it.\n. Thanks @claudioc ! I think it's a good idea to expose the FastClick object for those who need it.\nThis fix landed in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/8566bd8d14398f6e7f864ae28437a4498bd61052\n. @ginevive It looks like something goes wrong when it's initialized with icon=\"{{path.link.icon}}\", you can solve this by using ng-attr-icon=\"{{path.link.icon}}\" instead.\nDoes that work?\nI believe we can make the code you wrote work as well so I will keep this open.\n. Thanks @anatoo ! I tried it and it works fine :+1: \n. Thanks! I wasn't sure if this was still used. :+1: \n. Thanks @anatoo ! I works fine :+1: \n. Thanks @andipavllo ! I will merge this.\n1.3.15 has already been released. If you want to release a new verision, please release 1.3.16.\n. Thanks for reporting @prophetzoli ! Can you supply some code that reproduces this error?\nI will try myself. The old version of flexbox is supposed to work on Android 4.1 but there may be some inconsistencies.\n. @prophetzoli By the way. Is using Crosswalk an option? There probably won't be any trouble like this if you're using Crosswalk.\n. @prophetzoli I have verified that this happens in Android 4.1 WebView. Remote debugging is not supported in this WebView so solving the issue might take some time since we need to use trial and error.\n. Thanks for doing this @IliaSky ! :+1: \n. Thanks for reporting @wishbooks ! Do you get any errors in the console?\n. I will close this since we are unable to reproduce it.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! :+1: \n. Thanks @anatoo ! Looks good :+1: \n. Looks good! Thanks :+1: \n. Thanks @masahirotanaka !\nThe <ons-splitter-content> was in the wrong category so I moved it. Looks good now.\n. I'm closing this\n. Thanks @philolo1 ! :)\n. Thanks @anatoo! :+1: \n. @masahirotanaka Thanks! :+1: \n. Looks like these lines are not needed anymore so I will just remove them.\n. Thanks for reporting @ThomasLochbrunner !\nI reproduced it. Looks like it's not handling resizing correctly. We will fix this issue.\nPlease let us know if you have any other issues :+1: \n. This will definitely be looked at next week. Sorry for the delay\n. @bdedardel navigator.topPage is a property, not a method. Did you update both onsenui.js and angular-onsenui.js ?\nThe topPage property works fine when I try to access it.\n. @bdedardel Glad you were able to solve it :+1: \n. @philolo1 Thanks! Looks good :+1: \n. @Maximvdw I tried reproducing this but wasn't successful. Can you post a small example app that triggers this error?\n. This was probably also fixed with #1415 so I will close it.\n. Thanks for reporting @brampauwelyn !\nWe will take a look at this\n. @brampauwelyn I tried to run your code in the latest release 2.0.0-rc.4 and it works fine. Maybe it isn't an issue anymore.\nCan you try again in the latest version?\nEDIT: I understand now what you mean. The background color was not visible. I will take another look\n. @brampauwelyn There was some code that set the height dynamically causing the issue. It should be fixed now.\nWe will release a new version with this fix pretty soon\n. @aarbar Probably the <ons-pull-hook> element is not attached to the DOM when you try to access it.\nThe <ons-template> will just consume all the content and remove it. It will be inserted when used somewhere in the page.\nMaybe you can use event delegation:\njQuery:\n$(document).on('changestate', '#pull-hook', function() {\n  // do something here...\n});\nor you can add the event listener when the page is initialized.\nI will close this since I don't think it's an issue. Please feel free to open again if you feel otherwise.\n. @aarbar I hope you will be able to solve it! Please ask again if you run into some other issues :+1: \n. Thanks @anatoo ! Looks good :+1: \n. @anatoo Thanks! I will merge this now\n. @anatoo Looks great. I also removed the _compiled attribute.\n. @anatoo Looks good! Will merge now\n. @anatoo Thank you! Looks great!\n. I am also unable to reproduce this.\n@EFCniux @biji Could you create a small example on Codepen that reproduces this?\nMaybe you can use this tutorial as a starting point and export to Codepen:\nhttp://tutorial.onsen.io/?framework=angular1&category=Getting%20started&module=Data%20binding\nI tried changing the placeholder to an Angular string interpolation but it worked fine.\n. Closing this since we are unable to reproduce. Please reopen if you are having the same problem.\n. Referenced the wrong issue :)\n. Thanks @Legolaser!\nWe will take a look at this issue.\n. I will take a look at this issue now\n. @Legolaser This has been fixed now. Thanks for the bug report! :+1: \n@frankdiox Looks like we need to do DOM mutations in attachedCallback otherwise the timing is incorrect for Angular. But this was only triggered with Sliding menu so I honestly don't know exactly why this happened.\n. @anatoo Thanks!\n. @Maximvdw The Theme Roller has not been updated for the new version yet. I think we will update it pretty soon.\nSorry for the inconvenience!\n. I will close this for now.\n. @frankdiox Thanks! Will do it tomorrow :+1: \n. Great!\n. @frankdiox Looks like a good idea :)\nI wonder if it breaks something. I can test it tomorrow\n. Thank you @vineshhpatel ! I have verified that this happens in v2 as well.\nWe will take a look it this.\n. @munsterlander \nHi!\nThanks for reporting. Actually this is intentional, we don't add any special padding to the bottom toolbar since there are lots of different ways to populate it and we don't want to try anticipating what the developer wants to use it for.\nI will close this for now but maybe we should add some clarification to the docs.\n. @frankdiox Can you take a look at this when you have time?\nMaybe there is a difference with native web components and the polyfill?\n. @MortezaT Thank you for reporting!\nCan you add some more info on how to reproduce this? I tried it in Chrome 50 without any problem.\nCan you paste the whole index.html that triggers this error?\n. Thanks a lot @MortezaT and @vjoomens !\nYour samples were very helpful. This has been fixed now and will work in the next version.\n. @MortezaT It has been fixed but not released yet. It will be released next week.\n. Thanks! Looks great\n. Since it looks like this is fixed I will close this issue :)\n. @frankdiox Thanks! But I'm wondering what you mean by ng-repeat not working. It's working fine for me and I tested it on several devices before releasing.\nIn what way is it not working?\n. @frankdiox Does this happen for the examples in the repo? I can take a look again but I am also using Chrome 50 so I'm wondering what the difference between our environments is..\n. @frankdiox Thanks! I wll take a look at it\n. @frankdiox Ok! I will merge this.\nHowever, I am a bit concerned by the following condition:\njavascript\nif (scope.$last) { ... }\nIt feels like this could also happen for directives other than ng-repeat that do something similar.\n. @anatoo \n\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30de\u30fc\u30b8\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u306b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u5468\u308a\u306e\u5909\u66f4\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3001@anatoo\u3055\u3093\u306b\u898b\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3046\u307b\u3046\u304c\u3044\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n@IliaSky \nI've been thinking about this and decided not to merge it. At least not in the current form.\nThere are several reasons for this. One is that this is a rewrite rather than a refactor and I don't want to make such a big change at this point since we are currently in RC.\nBig changes like this need to be preceded by some discussion and it's important that we all agree on the changes before we start implementing. Maybe this is a fault on mine since I heard that you were working on changes to the animations but I wasn't fully aware of the scope.\nPreviously when adding new features and making big changes we always start by writing a spec where everyone can chip in and provide feedback. I think this is very important since it avoids situations like this where someone has spent a lot of time making changes but we are unable to merge them.\n. Looking at the animators resulting from these changes I agree that they are shorter but maybe some things are a bit overkill.\nThere are some helper functions like fade.in, translate, etc. that I think are hiding what's actually going on. I think specifying the actual CSS rules is easier to understand.\nI also don't like that the names of the keys are used to get the DOM elements. I find that unintuitive.\n. @dndoanh @tfutada Very sorry for the late reply!\nIs this bug still present in the latest RC version?\n. @IliaSky When you have time can you take a look at this?\n. @frankdiox If I understand this correctly it can be used to pass data to the previous page with popPage()?\nMaybe we can merge this for the next version.\n. Thanks @frankdiox \n. @IliaSky Do you know what's the reason for this delay? I'm guessing this delay can make it feel unresponsive\n. Maybe @frankdiox's phone was slow :)\n. What do you think @frankdiox ? Should we remove the delay?\n. Thanks for reporting @ming-k !\nWe will take a look at these issues\n. @IliaSky @ming-k \nI also noticed the scrollable toolbar in Firefox when there is a back button.\n. Thanks @philolo1 !\nI did some debugging. It turns out that the reason for the bug was that <ons-splitter-side> element has a private property called _width but it was not set yet.\nHowever, the attribute width is defined so I changed the implementation of the <ons-splitter-side> slightly instead since I think it's better than using setImmediate.\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/1443/files\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. I think it looks good :+1: \n. @gjkr Thank you for the bug report! We will take a look at this.\n. @frankdiox Thanks! Looks good.\nCan you also add it to the Changelog?\n. Thanks! :)\n. Great! :+1: \n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thank you @anatoo ! I can take a look at this.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !! :tada:\n. Thanks @matoilic ! I will merge this.\n. @elvisqi Wow, this is amazing! :)\nWe have actually been thinking about adding Vue.js support so maybe we can cooperate.\n. Thank you @anatoo!\nI fixed a small regression in the Angular1 bindings. Will merge now.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! :+1: \n. Thank you @airamrguez !\nWe will take a look. Probably we need to stop propagation at the switch.\n. Thank you @iamjay !\nWe will take a look at this PR. Probably we also need to add a case for checkbox and radio buttons since they don' emit the input event.\n. @iamjay I will merge this now since it solves the problem. We will take a look at the radio buttons and checkboxes later.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! I will release now :)\n. Thanks @philolo1 ! Looks like we have a test for this event so we will need to change that as well.\n. Thanks @philolo1!\n. Thanks @masahirotanaka !\n. Thanks @greenkeeperio-bot ! I hope you didn't break anything.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! I made some changes and will merge this now.\n. @frankdiox @anatoo I tried this and it looks very similar to the native animation.\nI think we should merge it.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! This animation is great :doge:\n. Thanks @joeblew99 !\nWe also want to add a date picker, both for iOS and Material Design. We will need to discuss it but it's definitely something that can be added for the next version together with some other components.\n. @munsterlander Yes, that's what I usually do but depending on the version of Android it will look different and there is no way to style it.\n. Looks great!\n. Thank you @ruaanvds ! Looks like the var attribute has not been implemented for <ons-speed-dial>.\nWe will fix it!\n. @ruaanvds You can run the methods directly on the DOM element.\n. @ruaanvds Great that you were able to solve it! :)\nWe will support the var attribute from the next version.\n. @frankdiox I prefer 2 over 3 since exporting the whole util object would export a bunch of functions that are very specific and not useful to the user. I think option 2 is generally cleaner and also consistent with things like ons.platform and ons.notification.\n. Let's go with option 2!\nDoes anyone have any idea about what we should call the object? Is ons.modifier OK?\nI think these method names are good for adding and removing modifiers:\nons.modifier.add(el, modifier);\nons.modifier.remove(el, modifier);\nI can't really think of a good name to check for existance.\nMaybe like this:\nons.modifier.exists(el, modifier);\n. Thanks! Let's investigate that problem. I agree that it's quite annoying\n. @IliaSky I asked in the other issue for some more information.\n. I will close this since we are unable to reproduce it.\n. @rtholmes This is a good suggestion. Most modern browsers already support injecting and removing styles by adding and removing tags from <head>. You could probably implement this yourself with just a few of lines of code.\nIt's also possible to disable and enable stylesheets with the documents.styleSheets[idx].disabled property.\nSo basically I don't think this needs to be implemented in the core library, especially since we don't know how the stylesheets are being loaded.\n. @jamesst20 Thanks for reporting!\nThe reason why it's scrolling with the page is that it's inside the <ons-page> element. Can you move it outside the element?\nSince it's a modal dialog that covers the whole screen you can normally attach it directly to the body without any problem. Only difference is that the semi-transparent mask will also cover the toolbar but that is normally preferred behavior.\nI will close this but please feel free to open it again if you are still having trouble. Thanks!\n. I hope it works out!\n. Thanks @anatoo !\nIt looks good. I think we should also use this template loading API for the Angular1 bindings since they are not loading templates correctly from the Angular $templateCache service.\n. Thanks!\n. @tommy0311 Does this happen only when using Meteor? It doesn't happen when I run it in Mobile Safari.\n. @tommy0311 Does it also happen for you if you open the app in Safari on the real device?\n. @jakwarrior @IliaSky I agree. It looks like the device is generating two events in Chrome. Maybe we can try updating the version of Hammer that is bundled in Onsen UI.\nHowever, there is no way for us to verify that it has been fixed since we don't have access to a Surface device.\n. Looks like webpack is not used to build the package. I will close this and see if I can figure out how to do this correctly.\n. Thanks @copleykj ! I will take a look at this\n. @frankdiox I will close this for now :)\n. Thanks @frankdiox !!!\n. @dnish: I was unable to reproduce this issue. Can you provide some simple code that we can try?\nI've tried on iOS 9.3 both as a Cordova app and in Mobile Safari.\n. Great @MyG494 !\nI will close this issue for now.\n. @erikcw Thanks for reporting!\nI tried this and it looks like it keeps attaching and detaching the element if you put two modals in the page.\nWe will take a look at this and fix it.\n. @thisar Can you try updating to the latest version?\n. @SharkChips Thanks for reporting!\nThe div that you are seeing is the semitransparent mask that is faded in while the animation is running. It only exists during the animation and is removed after.\nLooks like we need to filter the pages property to only include <ons-page> elements. We will fix this.\n. Seems to work fine, so I will merge it.\n. Thanks @anatoo! I will take a look at it\n. @meisam3322 I don't use RequireJS personally so I'm not sure.\nThis kind of question is better suited for the forum so I will close it.\n. Thanks for reporting @aminch ! That is very strange. Maybe the babel polyfill overrides something.\nWe will take a look at this.\n. Thank you @danielearwicker !\nWe will definitely fix this. The file was originally made to get source code completion in editors but we will update it to support module systems as well.\nPersonally I don't have much experience with Typescript but I will take this opportunity to learn :)\n. Thanks @munsterlander !\n. Thanks @anatoo! I think it looks good\n. @erikcw Thanks!\nI have fixed this. However, for the AngularJS directive the refresh() method is exposed in a slightly different way since we are not using the <ons-lazy-repeat> element.\nThe refresh() method is attached to the delegate object dynamically so you can do something like:\n$scope.InfiniteScrollDelegate.refresh();\nThis will be available in the next release.\n. I think @frankdiox's suggestion looks good and it isn't a big change from what we currently have.\n. @anatoo Thanks! Looks good so I will merge now.\n. @anatoo I made some changes to the <ons-pull-hook> so it doesn't create the .scroll element anymore. Can you verify that this still works?\n. Thanks @anatoo! I will merge this now.\n. @anatoo Good idea! I will try this\n. Actually this is still causing an error:\nVM3262:23001 Uncaught Error: Invalid state: page element must be a \"ons-page\" element.\n. @frankdiox: I will merge this if there are no problems.\n. Thanks! :+1: \n. I don't really want to do this since we would have to add a custom click event listener to every button that submits the parent form. Better to just let the user add their own click event handler for the cases where they want to submit a form.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. @qifuren1985 Yes, I think the easiest way is just top remove the pages manually from the stack. Another option might be to use two navigators.\nI will close this for now.\n. @anatoo Thanks! I will merge now\n. @frankdiox Yes, I think so.\nI guess we should add the update method as a parameter to the options object.\n. I will close this.\n. @svdoever \nThank you for all the great feedback. We also want to make the documentation better.\nIt looks like there is a bug on the React documentation. We will take a look at that.\nIf you want to contribute to the docs you can make a PR to the website repo. Most of the docs are located in this directory:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/onsen.io/tree/master/src/documents_en/v2/docs\nAlso, the reference is generated from comments in the source code. For the React components it looks like this:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/react-onsenui/blob/master/src/components/AlertDialog.jsx\n. @beebase\nI am on my phone right now so I can't write a long response.\nBasically the implementation of renderPage is up to the developer. It takes a route object and renders a page.\nHere is an example of how it could look:\nhttps://github.com/argelius/react-onsenui-redux-weather/blob/master/components/App.js\nIn this app no custom props are passed to the pages but you could add something like route.props and use the spread operator:\nconst renderPage = (route, navigator) => (\n  <route.component key={route.key} ...route.props navigator={navigator} />\n);\nI hope this was helpful! If not please tell me and I will clarify.\n. @curtispatrick84 Thanks for reporting! I was unable to reproduce this myself. \nPlease ping me again when you have made a Codepen example. :+1: \n. @dnish Instead of adding a click handler to every button you could make a new component that wraps the Onsen Button component and adds the feedback on click.\nI will close this since I don't think we will implement this.\n. Thank you for reporting @gnokit ! I will take a look at this next week\n. @gnokit Sure sorry for the long delay. This has been fixed now.\n. Looks great. I like the services for creating modals and dialog! :+1: \nI will merge this but as I mentioned in the comments the directives parameter of the @Component decorator has been deprecated and will be removed in the next RC version.\nI think we should update so we are compatible with RC5+ and ignore previous versions since they are not compatible with eachother.\n. @munsterlander I will take a look at this. Is this happening even if you don't have the float attribute?\n. @schonmann Does it work correctly if you use the default template?\n. Looks great! :+1: \n. Thank you @asial-matagawa !\nCan you please also add this fix to the Changelog?\n. :+1:\n. @asial-matagawa Can you resolve the conflict? I think there is a conflict in CHANGELOG.md so you need to merge latest master branch into your branch.\nPlease comment here when you are finished so I get a notification :+1: \n. @asial-matagawa You removed some lines from the Changelog:\nCurrent changelog on master has these lines:\n```\nv2.0.0-rc.18\n\n\nangular1: Use the $templateCache service.\nons-splitter: Fix #1537.\nons-navigator: Provides animators and allows to extend them.\n```\n. @asial-matagawa No problem! Looks good now :+1: \n. Thanks @rgins16 ! We will take a look at this.\n. @rgins16 I took a look at the code and it looks like the docs for the \"fade\" animator is a mistake. There is only two default animators for iOS and Android + a simple slide animation.\n\nWe will consider adding a simple fade animator for the dialogs as well.\nThe delay parameter currently doesn't work for the none animator. We will fix this but I think it's not only for the dialog, it's probably the case for other components as well that that you can't put a delay on the none animator.\nI will close this for now.\n. @jitu-git Sorry for the late reply. Can you provide some steps to reproduce this bug?\nI will close this for now but please feel free to open again if you feel it's a bug in Onsen UI.\n. Thank you @anatoo ! I will take a look at this later today. I think I can merge today.\n. Looks great! :+1: \nSorry for the delay...\n. Thanks @puku0x ! We will take a look at this issue.\n. I will merge this now.\n. @munsterlander Thanks!\nThese are still WIP so there are some things missing and we might change some APIs.\n. @ilovezy Sorry for the late reply. We will take a look at this.\n. @ilovezy I am unable to reproduce this. Can you please provide some steps to reproduce it? \nAre you running in Cordova? Can you show some very simple code that reproduces this bug?\n. I will close this for now but please feel free to open it if you can provide a way to reproduce the issue.\n. @anatoo Looks good!\n. Hi @hadjloo !\nIt looks like you converted the less file for the website. The Onsen UI components are written in Stylus and you can find them here: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/tree/master/css-components/components-src/stylus/components\nDoes the mixin also support Stylus?\n. @hadjloo Thanks for the PR. I will take a look when I have time.\nBtw, does this take flexbox into account? We use flex-index in some places to force the order of the layout.\n. Thanks @anatoo !\n. Thanks @anatoo! I have added translations so I will merge now.\n. @alegauss Thanks! I think this might be a problem with the documentation. I will fix it.\nYou can not pass options like this in the tabbar at this point. \n. Thanks @anatoo !\n. @juspriet Can you create a simple example that reproduces this bug?\n. @juspriet @munsterlander \nMaybe it's related to this issue: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/1552\nHowever, in this case an error was thrown.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !\n. @frankdiox \nons._util.createElement uses this helper function now... I think we should just expose it as ons.createElement.\nActually this was always an issue with the previous polyfill since they were never upgraded instantly when using the polyfill.\n. Thanks @asial-matagawa ! Great solution. I will merge this now.\n. Thank you @asial-matagawa !\nDo you have time to look at this issue tomorrow?\n. @asial-matagawa Thank you! :+1: \n. @asial-matagawa Thanks! So it looks like it's a bug in the polyfill\nI can also take a look at this tomorrow since it's reproducible in Chrome\n. Maybe we can make a patch for the polyfill, I think that's better than trying to patch the problem in Onsen UI\n. This has been fixed now.\n. @nodefish We are aiming to release on Friday this week. You can build from source manually if you want to use it right now.\n. @anatoo Thank you for testing!\nThe status bar filling needs to be fixed before releasing, I was not aware of it failing\n. By the way, I don't think the undefined in the first example is a bug. I think it's just how the example is written.\n. @anatoo That's true, let's fix the example\n. Thanks @anatoo!\n. Will close this for now. I will take a look at the list border today\n. @vjoomens Does this happen in split view or sliding menu?\nCan you provide a simple example that reproduces this?\n. @vjoomens I think I figured out what's happening. Will fix later. On my phone now so I can't write code\n. @vjoomens Sorry for the delay. I had a high fever so I was out of action for a few days. This has been resolved now and should work in the next version.\n. Thanks @frankdiox !!\n. @copleykj Hi! It's still generating themes for 1.3.\nWe will update the Theme Roller to the latest version soon.\n. @jakwarrior @FruityXXL I will take a look at this issue. Sorry for the delay.\n. Sorry for the delay. This issue has been resolved now.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! Sorry for breaking this... :sweat: \n. @rgins16 Thanks for reporting! We will take a look at this issue.\n. @leventkaragol We will take a look at this.\n@asial-matagawa Can you take a look at this issue?\n. @J261 Can you provide information how  to reproduce this?\n. Closing this now. Not enough information to proceed.\nPlease feel to open it again if you can provide steps to reproduce.\n. This has been fixed now.\n. @gotenxds I will close this since it seems like it's only an issue in the Chrome DevTools.\nAlso, I am unable to reproduce it in Chrome myself.\n. @ctc Thanks for reporting!\nThis has been fixed now and will be released with the next version. In the meanwhile you can just do something like $scope.$evalAsync() after creating the dialog to refresh the view.\n. Thanks @anatoo !\n. @anatoo I have reverted this now.\n. Thanks @anatoo!\n. Thanks @anatoo!\n. I will close this for now. Please feel free to open this again if this is still an issue.\n. @anatoo Maybe we can map the element methods to component methods like we do in Angular 1.\n. Thanks @pinpikokun ! We will take a look at this issue.\n. @SharkChips @munsterlander I think this works as expected. As @munsterlander mentioned IDs are unique so there should only be one element for every ID.\nIf you inspect the DOM, pushing to nav2 will actually push a page to the navigator that is at the bottom of the page stack since it's the first element with the nav2 ID. That's the reason why you can't see it.\nI will close this now but feel free to open if you believe it's a bug.\n. @bdedardel I am unable to reproduce this error (blank page). Can you create a Codepen example where it fails?\nThe error message is due to the content of the template being compiled by Angular. We will try to fix this error message.\n. @bdedardel I can still not reproduce this. I tried with both Chrome and Firefox.\nCan you create a minimal example that reproduces this?\n. @bdedardel Is it possible to create a minimal example that reproduces this? This example contains a lot of code that I don't think is related to the issue.\n. @co3k This looks great!\nI've pushed the branch and made a new PR:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/1635\nWill merge it soon.\nJust one thing: There is no need to update the generated files.\n. @anatoo Can you take a look at this when you have time?\n. @asial-matagawa Can you take a look at this Safari issue when you have time?\n. @asial-matagawa Thanks!\n. Thanks for reporting @bdedardel ! I will take a look at this now.\n. @bdedardel I think this is related to this: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/1584\nThis has been fixed in this PR: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/1634\nHopefully we can merge and release this pretty soon.\n. Thanks @co3k !\n. @rancor1223 Thanks for reporting!\nI will take a look at this issue.\n. @pinpikokun Thanks for reporting! We will take a look at this\n@asial-matagawa Can you take a look at this iOS issue?\n. @Wieltje I've made a fix for this and it will be released with the next version.\nIn the meantime you can use this CSS to fix it:\ncss\nons-alert-dialog {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  bottom: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  z-index: 2\n}\n. @Wieltje Thanks for the quick response. I will investigate this as well.\n. @Wieltje Actually this doesn't happen when I tried it. I was using an Android 6.0.1 device, what version are you using?\nIf you inspect the DOM you can see that the element itself is removed, so this sounds like a bug in Android rather than a bug in Onsen UI.\nMaybe you can try something like this:\njavascript\nons.notification.prompt('Hello!', {cancelable: true})\n  .then(function() {\n    if ('getSelection' in window) {\n      window.getSelection().removeAllRanges();\n    }\n  });\n. You can reset the alignment with:\n.ons-icon--ion {\n  line-height: initial;\n  vertical-align: initial;\n}\nI don't think we can remove this rule because it would cause icons to display incorrectly in a lot of apps.\nAbout the size of the icons in the toolbar buttons, I think we can adjust them to be consistent regardless of the icon pack used. You can use size attribute to change it manually.\n. Thank you, @Wieltje!\nI will try to reproduce this but haven't been successful yet.\n. Thanks @asial-matagawa !\n. @asial-matagawa That code block causes flickering on iOS so I think we should only run it on Android.\n. @asial-matagawa I will close this for now since I know that the code within that block causes issues in iOS sometimes. I think it maybe is dependant on the content of the page.\n. Thanks @asial-matagawa ! Looks great. I will merge this now.\n. @nodefish The toolbar is still supposed to be hoisted so I don't really know what is going on here. Maybe it's because how riot is rendering the HTML.\nYou can try rendering the toolbar with the .page__background and .page__content instead of letting Onsen do it. Onsen will only create those elements if they don't already exist.\n. @nodefish The DOM structure of the page will not change so you can safely render the elements like this.\nWe will investigate why the hoisting broke in this case. We changed how it works to make it more efficient but it looks like the change broke something in your case.\n. @frankdiox This looks good and it doesn't break anything. I will merge now.\n. Thanks for reporting @milanjaros !\n. @vjoomens I have verified this issue, it looks like it only happens in Safari.\n@anatoo Can you take a look at this issue when you have time?\n. @rgins16 The popover needs a target attribute for the show(target) method.\nI have improved the error message to make it more clear.\n. @vjoomens Thanks for reporting!\n@asial-matagawa Can you please investigate this issue? It looks like it only happens when the switch is inside a sliding menu.\n. Thanks @asial-matagawa !\n. Thank you @asial-matagawa ! I will merge this now.\n. Let's do this. Shrinkwrap makes it very hard to keep packages up-to-date\n. @milkisevil Thanks for reporting. This has been fixed.\nI have also added tests and we will add more tests for the Angular 2 bindings.\n. Thanks @asial-matagawa!\nLooks like it works fine on Linux as well so I will merge this.\n. Thanks @Humeira !\nThere are some other things we would also like to change when updating to Vue 2. We will use your commits as base for a bigger PR.\n. @Humeira Thanks!\nIf you could help with the migration that would be very appreciated. I will also start doing migration pretty soon but I think we can do it in parallel.\n. I've created a new branch from your commits so I will open a new PR. Please make PRs to that branch instead if you make any changes.\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/1674\nNext week I will create a list of changes that need to be made for the Vue 2 bindings. If you have any suggestions, please let me know. The current Vue 1 bindings are very simple and I want to create something more powerful for Vue 2.\n. Thanks @frankdiox ! :rocket: \n. @asial-matagawa I think that test is for the angular1 bindings.\n. @frankdiox I think it looks good!\n. Thanks @echojc ! I will merge this.\n. Thanks!\n. I think this fix is fine.\n. Thanks! Looks great\n. I don't think we should encourage adding event handlers as attributes.\n. @botezatpv Hi!\nThere is a \"segment\" component. You can find it on this page:\nhttp://components.onsen.io/\nWe are not planning to make it into a Web Component at this time so I will close this issue.\n. Thanks @anatoo!\n. @robcaldecott We don't have it at this time but we are planning to add it.\nMaybe you can use this one: https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select\n. @robcaldecott Yes, we would probably style a native select since the user would get nice behavior on iOS and Android devices.\n. We are planning on adding an <ons-select> element to the core so I will close this issue.. Thanks @anatoo !\n. Thanks @asial-matagawa ! This structure makes a lot more sense.\n. Thanks @asial-matagawa !\n. Thanks @asial-matagawa ! Are you willing to maintain this file so it doesn't get outdated?\n. @ghprod Hi! Thanks for reporting.\nI am not really sure why this is happening. This is the code for pages which is used by topPage and the code for topPage itself. Looking at this code I can not see how topPage could return anything other than the last page in the stack.\njs\nget topPage() {\n  return this.pages[this.pages.length - 1] || null;\n}\njs\nget pages() {\n  return util\n    .arrayFrom(this.children)\n    .filter(n => n.tagName === 'ONS-PAGE');\n}\nIs it possible for you to create a simple example that reproduces this?. @ghprod Thanks for the prompt reply!\nA Codepen example would be really appreciated :+1: . @ghprod Please use unpkg: https://unpkg.com/onsenui@2.0.4\nYou can get CSS files there as well:\nhttps://unpkg.com/onsenui@2.0.4/css/. @FREEZX Thank you for the PR! It's really appreciated. A select component is something that we would like to add.\nI think there are some issues with this implementation. I will try to list them here.\n- Firstly, I think it is broken because it will not display the currently selected item.\nhtml\n<div class=\"selected-option\">\n  Selected <!-- It always displays select, we need to use the native select element to display the correct value. -->\n</div>\n- The structure is too complicated, this requires the developer to create a lot of elements. I think it can be simplified so you don't need to use so many DIVs. It should be possible to just style the <select> element itself.\n- There is no need to commit the generated files. Please only commit the .styl files since that makes it easier to read the diff.\nI think a select component should look almost exactly like a normal text input in Material Design but with a caret icon. There is an example here: https://material.google.com/components/menus.html#menus-behavior\n. I will close this issue. Please open an issue in https://github.com/monaca/monaca-cli if you are still having trouble.. @donskifarrell Hi!\nI think this is an issue in PhantomJS: https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/11958\nIt looks like it's not possible to access the children property for SVG elements in PhantomJS. Maybe you can try adding the shim suggested in the issue.. Thanks @frankdiox!\n. Thanks @asial-matagawa! Looks great\n. @outerman Does it cause any problems? I've seen this before and I think it's a bug in Chromium rather than a bug in Onsen UI.\n. I will close this for now since I think it's a Chromium bug.. Thanks @asial-matagawa !

Seems like this is not used, so importing it will increase the file size.\n. Since <ons-ripple> can be used lots of times in the same page (especially in lists) I think we should avoid doing appendChild to the DOM. You could try using document.createDocumentFragment() instead and attach that.\nI don't know how big the performance win is but I believe it's important that the initialization of this element is very performant.\n.

This might be true for all elements, but there seems to be an issue in Chrome where the detachedCallback is called before createdCallback some times. :(\nCreating ~100 elements and detaching I managed to get it happen ~30% of the time...\nIt looks like conditionally initializing this._gestureDetector in attachedCallback will solve that problem.\nI will try to create a simple example and file a bug report to Chromium.

This is not necessary anymore. tagName is always uppercase on modern browsers.\n. I'm a bit concerned how this would work in Angular 2 and React. Maybe those frameworks will add the attribute later...\nWe need to test this.\n. Is this to ensure the order?\n. I think this parameter has been deprecated in favor of NgModule, maybe we should update the examples to work with the latest RC version.\n. I like this API :)\n:+1: \n. It didn't work when I was creating a normal constructor. Probably because of this:\nhttps://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element#upgrading-the-constructor-context\n. @frankdiox Thanks! Good catch. I will remove the line.\n. We can do this instead: \nhttps://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element#skipping-the-caveat-through-extends\nSo we use init method instead of constructor but we can use this.\nWhich do you prefer? I actually prefer the using init method since we need less code and can use this variable.\n. @frankdiox Yes, I don't think that is supported. We already extend BaseElement so I think we can add the ugly constructor there and then use init in the other components.\n. Yes, I will refactor it. Thanks for the feedback! :+1: \n. @anatoo I have refactored it now.\n. @anatoo The v1 polyfill maps connectedCallback -> attachedCallback so the helper still works even if it references attachedCallback:\n\n. Is there another way to pass these variables to Karma instead of changing process.env? I feel you should not change process.env inside a program since they are defined in the shell.\n.

Hi, the code works perfect, but I think that would be even better if in stead of exit, first cheek if it is possible dismissPage, and once you are on the index.hml, exit. That last step, is provably simple, but is impossible for my skills:\nvar myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['onsen.directives']);   \nmyApp.run(function($rootScope){\n    document.addEventListener(\"backbutton\", function (e) {\n        if ($rootScope.ons.navigator.getPages().length > 1) {\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $rootScope.ons.navigator.popPage();\n        } else {\n            $rootScope.ons.screen.dismissPage();\n        }\n    }, false);\n});\n. Seriously, anyone else need that back button first make popPage, then dismissPage and just on the index exit? Maybe Im a noob and I\u00b4m missing something when I made my project, but for me is a must that should be include on the OnsenUI code.\n. I lost several hours and I\u00b4m still unable to solve it correctly. The big problem with my previous code is that if you cant close it on the index.html, you have to use the home button instead, not big deal, but when you open again, the back button take you out the app, not even close it, so it happens over and over until you manually close the app. Not good.\nThis was solved in part with the following code, I dont know how, provably for the true at the end. Now you still have to use home button, but when you open again the app, the back button just return to previous position you had the first time you open. So much better, but still a bug. I just know some html, so you provably can understand why this happen better than me.\nThis is my code:\n```\nvar myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['onsen.directives']); \nmyApp.run(function($rootScope){\n    document.addEventListener(\"backbutton\", function (e) {\n        if ($rootScope.ons.navigator.getPages().length > 1) {\n            e.preventDefault();\n            $rootScope.ons.navigator.popPage();\n        } else {\n            $rootScope.ons.screen.dismissPage();\n        }\n        if ($rootScope.ons.navigator.getCurrentPage().pageUrl / \"index.html\") {\n            e.preventDefault();\n            navigator.app.exitApp();\n        }\n}, false);\n\n});\n```\n. @argelius: Just asking: Did you decide in which upcoming version you want to add this feature?

Hi @Hirbod,\nI had been tackling the same problem, although my program had only one ons-navigator.\nMy bug was caused by ons-toolbar put in the same hierarchy as ons-navigator.\nI put the toolbar in upper hierarchy (the same as ons-tabbar), and the program worked fine.\nIf you use ons-toolbar with navigator, this might help you in some way.\n. I forgot to say that you need to modify css of .tab-bar__content or some elements if you put any elements out of ons-tabbar.\n. ons-toolbar (.navigation-bar) 's height is defined as 44px by default, so this will work.\n\n.tab-bar__content{\n  top: 44px;\n}\n\nPlus you may have to keep extra 20px height for iOS status bar area.\nSo something like below or more styling will be needed.\n\n.navigation-bar, .navigation-bar__item, .navigation-bar__left, .navigation-bar__right, .navigation-bar__center{\n  height: 64px;\n}\n\n. Ah, this will be needed, too.\n\n.page{\n  top: 64px;\n}\n\n. About page initialization, I have a solution. You can use angular's run block and ng-if directive.\nangular.module('app', ['onsen'])\n.run(function($rootScope){\n  var obj = {};\n  /* some initializing prosess */\n  $rootScope.someData = obj;\n});\n\n\n<ons-page ng-if=\"! someData\">\n  Contents During Initialization\n</ons-page>\n<ons-tabbar ng-if=\"someData\" animation=\"fade\" keepPage=\"true\" var=\"roottab\">\n        <ons-tab page=\"neighbor.html\" label=\"\" active=\"true\">\n            <ons-icon icon=\"ion-map\" class=\"tab-icon\"></ons-icon>\n        </ons-tab>\n        <ons-tab page=\"gossip.html\" label=\"\">\n            <ons-icon icon=\"ion-planet\" class=\"tab-icon\"></ons-icon>\n        </ons-tab>\n        <ons-tab page=\"chatrooms.html\" label=\"\">\n            <div class=\"notification reply-notification\"></div>\n            <ons-icon icon=\"ion-chatbubbles\" class=\"tab-icon\"></ons-icon>\n        </ons-tab>\n        <ons-tab page=\"tab-news.html\" label=\"\">\n            <div class=\"notification earth-notification\"></div>\n            <ons-icon icon=\"ion-earth\" class=\"tab-icon\"></ons-icon>\n        </ons-tab>\n</ons-tabbar>\n\n$rootScope.someData should be an object, instead of a primitive, that assures the initialization has completed, because of the nature of prototype chain. I usually assign user data of the app to it.\n. Hi @Hirbod,\nI think I finally found the cause. What caused the blink were nested <ons-page>s, I suppose. After long struggling, I found my code had nested <ons-page>s. Then I straightened my DOM structure, removing the nest, and the ugly blink bug finally dissapeared. OnsenUI doesn't seem to allow nested <ons-page>s after all. Your code apparently has nested <ons-page>s, so try removing it.

This also happens after doing a 'popPage' from an 'ons-page' with a sliding-menu and opening the keyboard, so perhaps it's not related to 'ons-split-view'.\nMinimum project for testing here:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/2uzqze596tyw7zi/MaxSlideDistance-bug-minimum.zip?dl=0\n. This feature was added in v1.3.0.\n. This was addressed in #620\n. @0505gonzalez No, it's been added to 1.3.3-dev: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n. This should be fixed after the windows-support we added last week, but we will test it more in this week.\n. Sorry but we are not testing Windows Phone 8.0, only Windows Universal (8.1). If you are still interested in W8.0, maybe this will be helpfull: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/247\n. We merged a windows-support branch last week taking care of this. Thank you.\n. Have you downloaded the latest build from the link provided in the readme?\nhttp://onsen.io/download.html#latest-build\nThe directory \"build\" on Github is not updated every day. Please tell me if your problems continue with the version of that link.\n. Well, the problem of the dynamic content is not actually related to OnsenUI. Windows Phone adds some security to the DOM manipulation so you need to add that shim (winstore-jscompat.js) before doing anything in order to develop your app. I thought it was enough to add it before you initialize your angular app, but perhaps it's necessary to include it before angular library as well.\nAnyway, Windows 8.1 support is not finished yet, so you may find some other problems :/\n. Done!\n. @jsoref Thank you very much for all of these fixes! We will check them and merge :+1: \n. #1179\n. Hey George, how is it going :)\nThat's the normal way to do it with the sliding menu pattern. Do you have any problem with that?\nRegarding the navigator error,  always needs an  as a child, otherwise it will throw that error.\n. Let's continue this conversation in #648  since it seems to be the same issue.\n. @gtsopour Are you using \"navigator.pushPage('settingPage')\" or something similar? After using that your 'home' page will remain in the page-stack of the navigator (what you call 'cache'), so after using \"navigator.popPage()\" your 'home' page won't be refreshed directly. Perhaps you want to use \"navigator.resetToPage('home')\" instead, so the whole page-stack is cleared and starts again.\n. There is no \"animation\" option for menu.setMainPage(). If you want to have transition animations you need to use \"ons-navigator\" as well. You can combine navigator and sliding menu if you want. I've made a quick example: http://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/rVxgzZ\nHope that helps :)\nEdit:\nThis usage is not standard for the Sliding Menu and the \"slide\" animation CSS looks a bit buggy though. You can close the menu at the same time using \"menu.closeMenu()\".\n. \"setMainPage()\" has no animation at all, that's why is not working. Check out again the link I posted before and tell me if that's what you want: http://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/rVxgzZ\nYou cannot go to \"navigator\" directly, \"navigator\" is not a page. The main page in this example is called \"onepage.html\", so you have to go there.\n. @JcDenton86 thanks!\nHowever, I think there is some mistake there since Tablet method is exactly the same than Phone method. Check it please :)\n. @JcDenton86 Ohh sorry, I was looking for a more specific way to detect tablets (like reading 'tablet' in the user-agent) and did not see the '!' mark. Looks like this is the only way to detect tablets right now...\nProbably it will be reviewed next week :)\n. @JcDenton86 I have modified a couple of things and merged your commits in #660\nThanks!\n. I cannot reproduce the problem. It's working as usual: http://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/QbEgwO\nCould you please provide an example where it does not work? Thanks!\n. @argelius Yes, I think so!\n. This is fixed in #670\n. @argelius It is finished, yes.\n. Thanks @PrabhdeepSingh ! It was actually a spelling error in isIOS7above method. \"Above\" should be lowercase!\n. @danish-jamil Could you please provide code, error logs or anything where we can see the problem?  Thanks.\n. @andreupifarre I am not able to reproduce this error. Could you provide a full example where this happens and the platform that you use? I've tried with the information provided in SOF but still I cannot see it.\n. @argelius Changelog modified!\n. @argelius done!\n. I think the only problem there is that Angular does not detect the value changes. Perhaps this could be useful to understand why: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15424144/4468962\nAnyway, you can simply use Carousel's postchange event to make a change in the scope and Angular will update it: http://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/WvRxww\n. Finished!\n. init and destroy events depend only on the page itself so they should work with any other element. hide and show are triggered only from Navigator and Tabbar. I think Sliding Menu does not \"hide\" the pages with display: none, it just takes the menu out of the visible screen, so it won't fire any event. Is there any other element that applies 'display: none' or 'display: block'?\n. Perhaps I haven't explained it well. It all happens in \"ons-page-element\", but only when CSS display is set to \"none\". Split-view and Sliding-menu don't set display to \"none\", they just take the page out of the screen. We can also fire \"hide\" and \"show\" events in those cases, but we just didn't speak about them in the specs.\n. show and hide events has been postponed: #725\n. @PrabhdeepSingh Thanks for reporting! We will investigate this.\n. The functions were just moved to CustomElements and looks like for some reason it is loaded after Angular so the functions are not created on time :(\nThis has been fixed in this branch. \nThanks @PrabhdeepSingh !\n. Hello @AndikaR ! Your first row is actually displayed under the search bar. You are using the CSS for the toolbar and search bar but you are not reducing the space of the page content. This will make it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29673755/onsen-multiline-toolbar/29689371#29689371\nHope it helps!\n. Thanks @zack24q !\nHave you encountered any bug related to undefined value in event variable? I believe in that case it should crash in line 470 before reaching your fix. Could you provide an example to reproduce the bug?\n. @zack24q I am sorry but after hundreds of tries in different browsers I haven't been able to get the error message in your Codepen :(\nCan you give me more details about how to reproduce it? Thanks!\n. @zack24q Finally I got the error! I've made another pull request with your changes, but I modified them a little bit. We are also using a specifing commit message format now. Check it out here: #719\nThanks!\n. It creates the module but does not assign to any variable. Other demos do the same.\n. It's actually a bit hard to decide, but I think it should be fix, yes :)\n. I think this is finished now!\n. @andreupifarre You can clone this branch with:\ngit clone https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI.git -b lock-on-drag-attribute\nAnd then follow the rest of the guide: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI#how-to-build\n. @kkirsche Our bower.json has been completely changed in some recent PRs and we don't have the version field anymore. I'm closing this now. Thank you anyway! :)\n. @zhuangperola Thanks! Which version of Onsen UI are you using?\n. @zhuangperola After several tests I haven't been able to find any memory leak related to ons-dialog. Perhaps you had something in your code that was affecting? Thanks anyway!\n. @zhuangperola Thanks for that code, I am trying with this now. I think I tried with a different configuration before so it's possible that I find the leak now!\n. @zhuangperola Finally it appeared! Thank you very much for you help! We have released a new version with this fix: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/1.3.4/CHANGELOG.md\nClosing this now, thanks!\n. Release example here: https://github.com/frankdiox/OnsenUI/tree/1.4.6\nbower install https://github.com/frankdiox/OnsenUI.git#1.4.6\n. @argelius I think you wanted to modify the release script to adapt it to bash or something, right?\n. Hello @filipefreitas82 !\nIt's true that there is no setSide() function available but you can emulate that functionality with two different menus. You just need to set \"swipeable = true\" in one of them at a time. I made a quick example here:\nhttp://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/Ejbvem\nTell me if that works for you :)\n. This may have conflicts with #752\n. @anatoo Oh! I didn't know we changed them in the development branch. I think before it was a normal method. Should I write it in core/elements then? Although I think the web page doesn't get docs from there yet.\n. @anatoo Ok, I reverted the commits and there are no registerAnimators anymore. Thanks!\n. @zhuangperola Thanks for reporting!\nI have tried this in 1.3.2, 1.3.4 and master branch but I haven't got any error in the console. The popover is well destroyed every time. I am using Chrome. Any other information you think it's relevant?\n$scope.create = function(e) {\n    ons.createPopover(\"popover.html\", {parentScope: $scope}).then(function (popover) {\n        popover.show(e);\n        popover.once('posthide', function () {\n            $timeout(function () {\n                popover.destroy();\n            });\n        });\n    });\n};\n. @zhuangperola Thanks again, now I got it. It's an easy fix actually :)\n. @zhuangperola The popover element has been adapted to CustomElements in master branch and this is not happening anymore. If you want to use 1.3.4 or older you can find the fix here #754\nThanks!\n. @Mi5i Oh! Looks like we forgot to add it to Onsen 1. Thanks for reporting!\n@andipavllo  Can you fix this?\n. @argelius Oh! With the new popover element this fix is not needed anymore. Closing this!\n. @leoxy520 Thanks for reporting! Visual Studio Gallery contains Onsen UI 1.3.0 right now and that bug was fixed in v1.3.2. We will update VSG asap!\n. @leoxy520 We updated yesterday the Onsen UI version of Visual Studio Gallery to 1.3.4, so it should be fixed now!\n. We just modified bower.json to support tag-based releases. You can check this PR for more information: #736\nIf you want to check the old bower.json file, you can find it in the last release: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/tree/1.3.4\n. @PrabhdeepSingh I don't see any flickering in the Sliding Menu with 1.3.4. This is the last example I made and looks right to me: http://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/Ejbvem\nAbout selecting the item, well, if you don't want to check the current page with Onsen UI methods just save the current sate in a variable and change CSS depending on that.\n. Does it only happen with 1.3.4? It would be very helpful if you can reproduce it on Codepen as you said in the original comment.\n. 1.3.3 should be the same, try with 1.3.2 or 1.3.0 better if you can :)\n. OK @PrabhdeepSingh ! We will investigate this. Thanks!\n. This will be merged in #796 \n. The problem was using wp8 platform instead of windows universal  as explained here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/31596226/4468962\n. Oh yes, I thought it was the same than in SOF. Anyway, Onsen UI does not support IE11like that, only Windows Universal Apps. Probably this is not the only problem that happens on IE11.\n. @agustinsaldias Sorry, right now we are focusing in supporting more common platforms and adding new features to the framework. There is no plan to test IE11 so far since it already works as Windows Universal App. However, if you do further research and find fixes for IE11 that are compatible with the rest we will be happy to accept a PR. In that case, feel free to ask any doubt that comes up!\nThanks!\n. @argelius I think it's fixed now.\n. @anatoo @argelius before addressing the AngularJS bindings, what do you think about this?\n. @anatoo @argelius I added angular directives for the events. I'm not sure if this is the way you wanted it. \nA page lifecycle event can be seen from the own page or from any parent component:\n<ons-navigator ... ons-hide=\"doSomethingElse($event)\">\n  <ons-page ... ons-hide=\"doSomething($event)\">\n     ...\n  </ons-page>\n</ons-navigator>\nAlso like this $scope.myNavigator.on('hide', listener);.\nThere was a \"destroy\" directive registered in some components, but I think we were not firing any \"destroy\" event before. I used that one for page's destroy.\nWe need Japanese translation in framework/directives/page.js for the events.\n. @3zzy  Those errors are due to a bug in Chrome related to CustomElements implementation. You can add document.registerElement = undefined; at the beginning of core/vendor/CustomElements.js to force using the polyfill.\n. @3zzy You are allowed to use jQuery or Angular also with Onsen 1.x. The demos are made with AngularJS but they are just that, demos.\nPlus, master branch is not \"Onsen 2.0\" yet. We are porting the elements to WebComponents and preparing everything.\n. Onsen UI 1.x is based internally on AngularJS to create the elements but it is not compulsory to use AngularJS in actual apps, you can use jQuery or pure JavaScript instead. Onsen 2.0 will be based on WebComponents instead of AngularJS, and of course it's not necessary to use AngularJS in apps either.\nThe reason why you see so much AngularJS in master branch is that we are providing AngularJS directives and stuff for those who want to use AngularJS (like we will provide in the future for Angular 2.0 and hopefully other frameworks), but you can just ignore those and use jQuery or pure JavaScript instead as I mentioned before.\n. @dineshprodapt thanks for pointing that out! Workaround here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/32217357/4468962\nLooks like this is the reason (included in 1.3.0): https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/core/lib/navigator-page.es6#L43\n@argelius @anatoo what do you think about that?\n. @JoaoSaleiro Hello! I think I know where your problem is.\nDo you have primitive values in $scope.data[index]? Because those are copied \"by value\" and not \"by reference\" in JavaScript, as I'm sure you know. So basically I guess you are updating the internal object $scope.data but the view cannot be updated since nothing changes there (and there is no scroll so LazyRepeat does not trigger the update). The immediate workaround is to use objects instead of primitive values, so everything will be updated at the same time.\nI have made an example here where you can modify a specific item or change the whole array: http://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/epOyPR\nI think those are the two different possibilities you may face.\nAnyway I think LazyRepeat is not tested to change the whole array, so maybe there will be other issues related. Check if it works for you.\nDoes this fix it or there is something else?\nGood luck with the release :)\nEdit:\nIndeed I have found a CSS bug when swaping the array. Even though elements are displayed, the \"height\" style of the ons-list does not change and needs to be updated manually:\ndocument.getElementById('myList').setAttribute('style', \n'height:' + ($scope.MyDelegate.countItems() * $scope.MyDelegate.calculateItemHeight()) + 'px');\nI modified the previous example.\n. @radiocat Hello! This has been asked many times before. Please search in SOF, issues here or just check the docs. Last attribute here: http://onsen.io/reference/ons-toolbar.html#attributes\n. I can confirm the flickering.\nIn sliding menu: http://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/VvLNpK\nIn tabbar: http://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/EVjzag\nWe will try to fix it!\n. @ryokanoshoh Looks like <ons-carousel-cover> has pointer-events: none;, so it can never be the target of mouse events. This is automatically inherited by its children, like the button you have inside. It is set like this because  <ons-carousel-cover> is a layer over the whole carousel element, what means that is also over  <ons-carousel-item>s and it would avoid clicks on them otherwise.\nThe easiest workaround is preventing the mentioned inheritance by just adding pointer-events: auto; to the button or anything inside <ons-carousel-cover>.\nYou can play with pointer-events value (none and auto) here: http://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/gaaLbK\nCheck the CSS for .cover-label and ons-carousel-cover. Notice the onmousedown=\"event.stopPropagation()\" in the button, perhaps that's useful for you.\n@argelius Do you think we should change this somehow?\n. @ryokanoshoh You are welcome :)\nPerhaps we can add this:\nons-carousel-cover > * {\n  pointer-events: auto;\n}\n. This can be now implemented combining slidingMenu/ splitter and navigator with navigator.bringPageTop().\n. @argelius Change tabs here and add the -1px to page__content: http://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/EVjzag\nI don't know if that -1px was fixing something else, I didn't find anything so perhaps it's not necessary for Onsen 2.0.\n. Closing old issue: this was implemented as ons-toast and ons.notification.toast :+1: . @bdedardel Hello! I think you misunderstood the purpose of ons.ready(). This is triggered only once at the beginning of the application. It is not supposed to be fired by setMainPage() or any other method. You cannot initialize pages that are not created from the beginning there.\nI suggest you to use pageinit event for that purpose. More info in the docs: http://onsen.io/guide/overview.html#Pageinitevent\n. @sofish Yes, thanks for reminding. We tried to change the repo structure and add ignored files to bower.json, but looks like bower still downloads everything and a specific repo is needed for bower.\n. @argelius I uploaded all the old versions after 1.1.0. Before that OnsenUI didn't even use Gulp, so this script won't work.\nWhere do you want the documentation, in OnsenUI/README.md or OnsenUI-dist/README.md?\n. @argelius We need to change now bower and npm to point to OnsenUI-dist. Can you do that?\n. There is already ons.createElement that can be used to create modals or any other component :+1: . @argelius The memory leak was in master before this PR. This fixes another error but does not fix the leak.\nEdit: actually the leak is lowered by this fix.\n. @argelius I just reported it. The memory leak is much lower after this fix but there is still something else creating it.\n. The error says that carousel variable does not exist. Have you included var=\"carousel\" in your ons-carousel HTML? And if you did, is that ons-carousel in your index.html? Because otherwise it won't be created by the time ons.ready is executed.\n. @argelius The error thrown in demo/icon/index.html is related to a show event fired from ons-navigator. It works well in Chrome but is broken in IE, Edge and Firefox. If I add document.registerElement = undefined; it also breaks in Chrome. Do you think it's a problem with the polyfill?\n. @argelius Yes, it's fixed :) Thanks!\n. @argelius Yes, memory leak fixed :) The only thing that remains is the pageinit error, but since it's going to be deprecated I guess it's not very important. Thanks!\n. @argelius Chrome Version 46.0.2490.80 m\nYou have to modify the demo and use none for tabbar animation.\n. @leocaseiro @argelius This was actually fixed in 0dc6cf0, but looks like wasn't updated in the website.\n. @leocaseiro Are you copying login.css content in your app? That file is changed in Onsen 2: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/css-components/www/patterns/login.css\nCheck that the CSS in your app is like that.\nNotice that it is just a pattern example, it's not related to OnsenUI core.\n. Oops! Thank you @gunar ! :)\n. @argelius You mean isIOS7above method, right? I just changed it.\nBtw, I don't think we can add test for this, so Coveralls will fail.\n. @boxbag We have changed the distribution repository from OnsenUI to OnsenUI-dist because we had to fix and update few stuff. Now it's not as heavy as before and the directory structure is simpler. I think you just need to update the path to include onsenui.js and the other files :)\n. Hello @dieunt \nThere is no specific component for that but probably you can use ons-popover like this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/27141353/4468962\n. @argelius Thanks for reporting. Your OnsenUI-dist local folder had old files from the previous versions. I just added rm * if OnsenUI-dist folder already exists.\n. Looks like we didn't update to the new bower.json in 1.3.12. The other releases were fine. I fixed 1.3.12 so it should work now :)\n. Looks like box-shadow property in .alert-dialog and .alert-dialog--material is slowing down the performance, specially the blur effect.\n. The problem is the combination of box-shadow and border-radius. That slows down the alert for Material and Flat designs.\n. Oh, I didn't know we had MD icons already included! Thanks @argelius \n. @anatoo If the device is Android and has modifier=\"material\" it uses .alert-dialog-*--android and also .alert-dialog-*--material. Material overwrites almost everything that Android includes, except a border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; located in .alert-dialog-title--android. Do you think this is OK? Shouldn't it include only one of them?\nIt can be fixed with border-bottom: 0 in .alert-dialog-title--material if we still want to include both classes.\n. @cither1 Thanks for reporting! Looks like the pages destruction in resetToPage() is out of Angular's digest cycle.\nThis is not applicable to Onsen UI 2.0 but I think we can release a new 1.x version to fix this. What do you think, @argelius ?\nAdding self._scope.$digest(); before navigator.js#L602 fixes this.\n. @cither1 We just released 1.3.13 with this fixed. Try it out please!\n. @tinocosta84 Could you please elaborate it a bit? Is it the only button that disappears? Have you tried changing it somehow until it appears again? It's hard to figure out why it happens without an example or more information.\n. I tested it yesterday and the problems I found were related to the tests themselves. Like not passing a real JSON as a parameter.\n. This was closed in #1073\n. @d3orn Thanks for reporting! I'd like to take a look at it. Could you please link to a simple example in Codepen or jsfiddle? Also, which version of Onsen UI do you use?\n. Hello @boustanihani ! Currently there are no plans for a Datepicker, unfortunately. We are focusing on improving Onsen UI main components to have a robust framework and enhance user experience. Since you can find many datepickers for jQuery, Angular or any other framework you choose, implementing one in Onsen UI is not a priority right now.\nBut as always, this is open source so if we receive a PR from the community we will love to review it :)\n. Certainly it's easy to access to the components with jQuery, querySelector or anything, I just thought it's a bit weird having them in the global scope only if we use Angular. In any case I guess we need docs to specify that var attribute and some other things are only for Angular. Closing this now, thanks!\n. @argelius @anatoo I'd like to bring this topic again. I know this is not really necessary anymore but there will be users porting their apps from 1.x to 2.0 just because they want to get rid of AngularJS. For backward compatibility purposes, do you think we should add this as a possibility? We can do as @argelius suggests and attach variables to ons object or anything else. We should also inform this is for backward compatibility and it's not recommended if you don't use AngularJS.\n. Which way do you think it's better? I just implemented getter/setter in ons-back-button so it's possible to do it like this: document.querySelector('ons-back-button').options = { ... }. With this I think it's not necessary to add an option to navi.pushPage(...), but what about the HTML attributes? options=\"myObject\", options=\"JSON\" or refresh=\"true\" onTransitionEnd=\"myFunction\" etc.?\n. @anatoo @argelius We need to pass the options object to ons-back-button somehow. I think we need at least 1 way to do it programmatically and 1 way directly in the HTML of the button:\n- Programmatically: backButtonElement.options = { ... }. I think this is better than passing the object with pushPage since it can be added on init event or page controller and is coherent with web components. Since there is a pointer to the back button in navigator-page-object it's also possible to do myNavigator.getCurrentPage().backButton.options = { ... }.\n- HTML: we can have 1 attribute per option: animation, animationOptions, onTransitionEnd and  refresh. Proposed attribute names: animation, animation-options, on-transition-end, refresh.\nAttributes have priority over object modifications.\n. @luposlip Thanks for reporting this bug, we will investigate it!\n. @luposlip Thanks for reporting! That file is not included in Onsen UI 2.0, I can only find a reference to that file in CSS-components patterns. When is that error thrown in your app? \n. Hello @luposlip ! This is working for me with pure JavaScript in Chrome:\njavascript\n  <script>\n    var myNavigator;\n    ons.ready(function() {\n      myNavigator = document.querySelector('ons-navigator');\n      myNavigator.addEventListener('postpush', function(event) {\n        console.log(event);\n      });\n    });\n  </script>\n<ons-button onclick=\"myNavigator.pushPage('page1.html')\">\n    Push Page\n</ons-button>\nI guess you do something similar. Can you provide a failing example so we can test it?\nThanks!\n. @michaeleparkour Thanks for reporting! I can confirm this, we will fix it asap!\n. Hello @fabricelepro ! I guess you created a new \"Onsen 2.0 Quick Start\" project in Monaca. I have tried the live preview in the browser and in a device with Monaca Debugger and both work fine. Have you modified anything? Also, which device are you using?\n. @cSteusloff Hello! In short, currently there is no autocomplete for VS2015. Truth is that we implemented a working version of autocomplete few months ago, but we found some problems/ limitations and had to stop that project for a while. Probably we will continue it but I cannot say any date yet.\nIn case you have experience with IntelliSense extensions or related stuff, any help would be really welcome!\n. This is fixed in https://github.com/OnsenUI/onsenui2-quickstart/pull/4\n. That's like ons-list-item with modifier=\"material\", we don't include ripple effect either. Perhaps we can include ons-ripple directly when modifier=\"material\" is specified unless it has ripple=\"false\" attribute?\n. I think this is a very good idea!\n. @anatoo Yes I can try. Let's see what @argelius thinks about it first anyway :)\n. @argelius Done!\n. @argelius Conflict solved.\n. @PhilTheNet Thanks for reporting! Are you using Universal Applications or WP8? It should work in Universal Apps, if not we have to fix it. With WP8 there were some security issues with icons.\n. @PhilTheNet I have found some information about that error here: http://www.marinbezhanov.com/web-development/16/how-to-embed-webfonts-properly-and-how-to-solve-the-ambiguous-css3111-font-face-encountered-unknown-error/\nIt is just related to the fonts in IE. Since it is working with the real Sliding Menu template for VS2015 I think we don't need to worry about this. Closing this for now, ping if you need anything else.\n. @kountouretis Something like this was asked few days ago: http://stackoverflow.com/a/34057158/4468962\n. http://tutorial.onsen.io \n. @argelius done();\n. @d3orn Thanks for the report! Right now you can use no-reload attribute to skip reloading page and animation. If you still want to reload the page on click without animation you can do it on reactive event.\nWe will change this to make no-reload the default behavior since seems more logic for mobile apps.\n. @d3orn Oh, but Lazy Repeat in Onsen UI 1.x already works in any div: http://onsen.io/guide/overview.html#LazyRepeatInHTML\nSince in Onsen UI 2.0 we won't have Angular directives or \"CustomAttributes\" we need to implement Lazy Repeat as a CustomElement (as happens with ons-ripple). Probably it will look something like this:\n<ons-lazy-repeat ... >\n   <div> ... </div>\n</ons-lazy-repeat>\n. @Hirbod Thanks, we will check that. Meanwhile you can find some information about this in SOF: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28766130/how-to-handle-hardware-back-button-on-ons-dialog/32200011#32200011\n. @matikun86 This was already fixed in master branch but thanks for pointing it out again so we don't forget to include it in the next release!\n. @Hirbod I just answered this in SOF: http://stackoverflow.com/a/34280311/4468962\n. @mayand Thanks for reporting! It works fine in my Nexus 4 both in Chrome and webview as a Cordova app. Also I cannot see any problem in Onsen UI preview web page (you mean this one?). I am using Android 5.1.1. What's your version?\n. @mayand I'm closing this since I cannot reproduce that error. Please open it again if you can provide some sort of example.\n. @masahirotanaka @argelius What about <ons-if> element instead of ons-if-platform? We can add attributes platform, orientation or anything else we need. Or is platform totally enough?\n. @anatoo Thanks!\n. @anatoo I think @argelius implemented something similar for material design in #1105 . It is probably the same but just changing margins and paddings.\n. @themikem  I think you are looking for modifier=\"longdivider\".\n. @themikem I'm not sure what you mean, I can see \"indentation\" without specifying any extra div: http://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/Mypapv\nWhat's the behavior you'd expect?\n. @themikem Oh! Now I see what you mean, you were speaking about the CSS only version without using the web components. Of course the components will create divs internally to fit the CSS.\nWe will probably add this and try to fix the header border problem, thanks! :)\n. @Hirbod Thanks a lot for all of this information! We will think about it :)\n. @vinkvin popPage is supposed to be the default behavior when the navigator stack is not empty so you should not need to add custom code for that. Are you loading cordova.js?\n. @argelius dialog-container already has height: inherit. Isn't that enough?\n. @danjarvis 1.3.15 just changes things in the website, OnsenUI itself is exactly the same than in 1.3.14 so we haven't release it in the distribution repo.\n. @argelius Conflict resolved.\n. @argelius This is done. I have decided the following:\n- Navigator methods resolve to new Navigator Page Object.\n- Tabbar methods resolve to new page element.\n- Splitter-content's \"load\" resolves to new page element.\n- Splitter-side's \"load\" resolves to new page element.\n- Splitter-side open/close/toggle methods resolve to the affected splitter-side element.\n- Carousel methods resolve to carousel element.\n- Alert methods resolve to alert element.\n- Dialog methods resolve to dialog element.\n- Popover methods resolve to popover element.\n- Modal methods resolve to modal element.\nAny suggestion about it?\n. @argelius Yeah that's also implemented. Ons.notification methods return the element itself.\n. @IliaSky I like it, but since the scrollbar should also be available for ons-page (and maybe any other div) perhaps it's better to have it as a new component (option 1). Since it's already listening for scroll perhaps it could also throw a custom event when it's near the bottom or some position configurable by the user.\n. @argelius Yes I checked this the other day, but I'm actually a bit confused. There is a double back-button only using Chrome in Codepen: http://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/mVXLZR\nI'm not able to reproduce the error in a local environment though...\n. @argelius Exactly, that's why. If I load it at the end then I also get two back-buttons in my local environment!\n. @argelius It works if we replace ons-template with script type=\"text/ons-template\". Looks like this is not a trivial problem :sweat_smile: \n. But there is no Angular code, it\u00b4s just Web Components in that example.\n. Yes, I think since ons-template is a component a bit special it's better to import it before the others.\n. Looks like this has been fixed but the issue wasn't closed.\n. @argelius Please reassign it to me when you finish the example.\n. @argelius With the current implementation there would be a small side effect. Page's hide event would be fired right before the tabbar animation starts rather than at the end. We can always look for ons-fab descendants and hide only those elements instead of hiding the whole page before the animation. What do you think it's better?\n. Also, currently ons-fab is animated when entering only persistent pages that already exist. If it's a new page it will be shown by default without animation. We can also change it to be always hidden by default. Its show method is actually triggered when the parent page is initialized (due to the propagation API) so it would work without further modifications.\n. @argelius It works when you use any animation in the tabbar but not with 'none'. The reason is that animit is async but when the animation is 'none' it just runs the callback synchronously without calling animit. A simple timeout in TabbarNoneAnimator fixes it.\nWith 'none' animation in the tabbar the ons-fab of course won't display its hiding animation since the tab is hidden instantly.\n. @argelius There is another problem. What if the copied element is, let's say, an ons-navigator that already contains some pages. The new element would have pages in the DOM but its this._pages property would be empty. Should we recreate all the internal properties?\n. @argelius The DOM shouldn't be modified anymore after the last PR, but as we mentioned before, there are still problems regarding internal variables that will be gone when copied. Most of the issues have an easy fix. For example, ons-page saves a boolean variable _isShown that could be stored as an HTML attribute instead without troubles. There are some bigger problems, though, with navigator's page stack, lazy-repeat's delegate and templates (and perhaps some others). Should I fix those issues in another PR?\n. @argelius Added to the changelog!\n. @argelius In that case there is no possibility of lazy-load, rigth? I think that's how it should be, actually. I can do it :)\n. @argelius @philolo1 I think it's done!\n. @philolo1 loadPage method creates a non-persistent page that must be removed after changing tabs. That attribute just marks the pages created with loadPage. I used the same name than an internal variable, perhaps I should rename it to _non-persistent.\n. @philolo1  I fixed an old bug in the last commit and made some refactoring. _remove-element attribute is not needed anymore.\n. The previous bug made it compulsory to mark the page with an attribute, otherwise some pages woudln't be removed from the DOM. But it's fixed now :sweat_smile: \n. @masahirotanaka Thanks!\nYes yes, I implemented all of this considering that issue, so I'm using effect attribute. Therefore, we can now add ripple effect by just adding effect=\"ripple\" to \"rippeable\" components :sweat_smile: \nI was thinking that maybe we could make tappable also a type of effect instead of an attribute since I guess nobody will want tappable + ripple.\nI will also try to make a new MD default animation for ons-navigator since the current one is for iOS.\n. @argelius @masahirotanaka I think this is finished now unless you want to modify or add something else.\nI added two new navigator animators that are a bit more similar to MD ones. I'm not specially good with animit so please check if you like them.\nI also added ons-if component as we mentioned in #1125 . platform attribute is only usable at the beginning (createdCallback) but orientation can be updated. I guess at some point we could add ons-if plugin=\" \" or something like that?\nAnyway, I will wait for your feedback before making any further change :)\nP.S: This looks amazing when changing between iPhone and Google Nexus in the device mode of Chrome Dev Tools :smile: \n. Should ons-tabbar have position=\"top\" by default on Android with the auto styling? I think it would be nice but there is a problem: ons-toolbar would be displayed below ons-tabbar if they include it inside the pages and not as a sibling of the tabbar...\n. @argelius @masahirotanaka This is finished. In the end we are using ripple attribute instead of effect=\"ripple\" as we discussed. Also, this adds position=\"auto\" for the tabbar so the position depends on the platform.\n. @RezaRahmati Can you be more specific? What does not work exactly? I just tested 4.2 and the only problem I've seen so far is a wrong transition effect in ons-input and ons-switch, what looks like a minor issue. Components like navigator or splitter seem to work as intended.\n. @RezaRahmati Thanks for the images. Is this all related to ons-sliding-menu, then? Or are you using ons-splitter?\nWhat kind of styles are you applying in the menu? Is it just background-color?\n. @RezaRahmati Thanks! I'll try that when I have some free time :)\n. @EddyVerbruggen Hi! I recently made a simple app with two implementations, AngularJS and vanilla JS. Check it out here: https://github.com/frankdiox/OnsenUI-Material-Tabbar/tree/js-implementation\nThe link to the demo is actually using the AngularJS version, but you can checkout the JS branch and try it yourself :)\n. This will be merged in #1231\n. @argelius @philolo1 I'm doing this in another PR with some other stuff, can you please wait? Same goes for #1207\n. This will be merged in #1231\n. @philolo1 Push and pop animations are created when the page is pushed. If you push a page without animation then it will pop without animation unless you specify something else. By default replacePage has 'slide' animation if I'm not wrong, so you will get a 'slide' pop animation as well by default. I think that's the desired behavior.\n. @c58 In beta.7 you will be able to do <ons-input type=\"checkbox\"></ons-input> :)\n. @argelius Much wow such doge\n. @anatoo Perhaps every element could \"export\" its final DOM scheme or \"templateSource\" without actually compiling. I mean, something like what ons-dialog has:\nconst templateSource = util.createElement(`\n  <div>\n    <div class=\"dialog-mask\"></div>\n    <div class=\"dialog\">\n      <div class=\"dialog-container\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n`);\nBindings can get that and compile it in their own way. This way we don't need to maintain schemes in all the bindings, only in the core.\nIn case there is no bindings then it will be compiled normally by the core. As @argelius was saying this evening, we can have some toggle for that or just rewrite some \"compile\" method from the bindings.\n. @sukima Thanks for spending some time with this! I don't have too much time now but perhaps this could be helpful.\nWe made ons-input before having bindings so I agree on the API not being the best for this purpose. \nAnyway, if I'm not wrong the _compile function it's run after being attached to the DOM because of contentReady function. contentReady was implemented for compatibility with the bindings and it basically delays the compilation until the element gets some content (ons-input doesn't have content) or the function is called again. In this case, it is called again from connectedCallback so basically it's compiled after that. Just try to set type attribute before anything else since other attributes may force contentReady as well (like 'modifier' or 'placeholder').\nYou can ignore the content-left attribute since it's not very useful and probably will be removed.\nHope this helps! I will close this issue since it's quite old and the core was already modified to make the DOM mutation \"optional\". Please open a new issue for any other question :). @argelius swipe-target-width=\"50px\" would make the splitter to open only if dragged from the border but once it's open I think the expected behavior should be ignore that attribute.\n. @argelius Done! I also modified the setter to apply default values when the user change the whole options object.\n. @bheijns Hello! Sorry for the late reply. The splitter navigation pattern is not directly compatible with back-button since it's not pushing/popping pages. If you want this kind of flow in your app it should be done with a ons-navigator. In your case you should the splitter as the parent component and then the navigator as a second component directly inside ons-splitter-content. From ons-splitter-side you need to call navigator methods for pushing pages instead of splitter's load.\nI'd recommend you to write this kind of questions in the forum since we use Github issues mostly for bug reports.\n. @argelius It looks like a good approach but there is something I'm not sure if I'm understanding. In this case React is not using rewritables.link, right? More like skipping pushPage and calling _pushPage directly. In that case we would need to implement all the options checks and pageHTML stuff also in React again.\nIsn't it possible to move all the troublesome code inside rewritables.link? For example, if link receives the necessary data to create the element and also to append it to the DOM. In this case it could get templateHTML instead of element, but I'm not sure if React could use templateHTML to create a page component. Is that possible?\n. @prophetzoli Thanks for reporting!\n. @argelius This will be fixed in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/1305\n. @argelius Thanks!\n. I can see ons-input without any problem. Please add some more information about your issue.\n. @claudioc It's been renamed to placeholder, actually. Same effect.\n. @claudioc Oh! You want it to float? Then add float attribute :) . It was the default behavior before but now it requires that attribute.\n. @costa974 @munsterlander Onsen 2 core is standalone, it doesn't require AngularJS extension for anything.\nIt's true that in the docs you can find something like \"Only available for AngularJS\", but these are just  some extra directives that basically allow OnsenUI to be more suitable for Angular developers. For example, you can handle events with attributes ons-postpush, ons-change, etc. where you can use Angular $scope directly. Or you can assign a component to a variable with var attribute. However, we think that Vanilla JS/ jQuery developers have different ways to achieve the same result without this syntactic sugar. document.getElementById instead of using var attribute;document.addEventListener` instead of attribute handlers, etc.\nons-if is a new core component, what means it does not require Angular. For Angular we had ons-if-platform and ons-if-orientation directives.\nI know all of this is a bit confusing, hopefully it will all be clarified when the new docs are released :)\n. @kirantpatil Thanks. That's already fixed in beta.8. I'm closing this now, open it again if you still get errors.\n. @munsterlander Navigator has been changed internally to make it more general for React and Angular2. This is not an issue related to the promises but to other changes. However, I think this is now the expected behavior. Before, we were using a \"doorlock\" that made a pushPage wait for the previous one to end before running. Now we removed that and it simply alerts that there is another action running (it's not queued).\nIf I didn't understand wrong, you need to push multiple pages to go back to a saved state, right? Perhaps you can push the last page and insertPage to the stack. Or use pushPage().then(...) to chain actions without animation.\nWould this work for you?\n. This also fixes problems with ons-page properties like the new page.options and page.name when using ons-navigator. Otherwise those properties wouldn't be available on page init event.\n. @kanakoubukata ons-speed-dial does not create an internal ons-fab automatically anymore. From beta.9 you have to provide the ons-fab:\n<ons-speed-dial position=\"left bottom\" direction=\"right\">\n        <ons-fab>\n          <ons-icon icon=\"md-car\"></ons-icon>\n        </ons-fab>\n        <ons-speed-dial-item>C</ons-speed-dial-item>\n        <ons-speed-dial-item>B</ons-speed-dial-item>\n        <ons-speed-dial-item>A</ons-speed-dial-item>\n      </ons-speed-dial>\n. There is also a material category now that groups all the material specific components: fab, speed-dial and ripple.\n. var a = document.createElement('ons-input'); a.value = 'hoge';\na.value // hoge\n<ons-input value=\"hoge\">\n  <label class=\"text-input__container\">\n    <input class=\"text-input\" value=\"hoge\">\n    <span class=\"_helper text-input__label text-input__label--active\" style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.498039);\"></span>\n    <span class=\"input-label\"></span>\n  </label>\n</ons-input>\nThis works under normal conditions as of today, maybe something changed in the core and it was fixed. Closing this for now.\n. @bdedardel As @IliaSky mentioned, the correct way to get the parameters is with page.data property. This requires to pass the parameters in a data object like this: myNavigator.pushPage('page.html', { data: { ... }, animation: 'lift', animationOptions: { ... } }. Looks like we made a mistake when writing that part of the docs in Angular 1, we'll fix it :)\n. @IliaSky :+1: \n. @argelius Nevermind, this could get the toolbar of a splitter side element or some similar problems. For now we can just manually move the toolbar to the top level I guess.\n. @corneyl Hi! Sorry but I can't see any problem here. That's rc.4.\n. @Maximvdw @argelius Moving the discussion here from the forum:\n@Fran-Diox said:\n\n@Maxim-Van-de-Wynckel Hello! I don't get any error with pullHook in AngularJS. I just updated the example because we slightly changed the API recently in the beta. It should be loader.state now instead of loader.getCurrentState(). This example works. Can you try it?\nBy the way, if you use the auto styling you don't need to specify modifier=\"material\" and ons-ripple, they will be added automatically on Android (ripple is added to the list item if it is tappable on iOS).\n. @IliaSky No problem. This is working well in IE/Edge :)\n. @EFCniux Thanks for the report. Unfortunately I cannot reproduce it. It's working here: https://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/qZvPxo?editors=101\n\nModifiers shouldn't affect the placeholder. Any other information?\n. @alegauss Hi! I think what you want to do here can be achieved with page's infinite scroll. Check out ng-infinite-scroll attribute or onInfiniteScroll property.\nWe don't plan to support something like this for lazy-repeat for now since this component was made for a different purpose. I'm closing this for now.\n. Has anyone tried using ons-splitter instead of ons-sliding-menu?\n. @argelius Looks like this is related to CustomElements implementation. It works perfectly with the polyfill...\nWith the native implementation I could fix the first error but not the second... document.registerElement = undefined; and everything works like a charm... not sure what to do about this :confused: \n. @luposlip Hi! I don't think that's the way to use ons-tabbar: http://tutorial.onsen.io/?framework=vanilla&category=Reference&module=tabbar\nThe list that you want should be inside tab1.html or tab2.html.\n. @argelius @khuongcomputer I only have Android 5.1.1 here and cannot reproduce this issue. I made this pen but I'm not sure if this is the right way to reproduce it. @khuongcomputer next time please provide a working example so we can skip this step.\nIn any case, bringPageTop relies on pushPage for the first push. If the page already exists then it just bubbles to the top, what should not fire init event. However, this event should be fired always for resetToPage.\n. @khuongcomputer I tried that one and still works. I guess it does not happen in Android 5.1.1.\nLet's see if @IliaSky has time to test this with iOS 9.2.\n. @Maximvdw Thanks for the report but maybe this is not working on purpose. I think transparent toolbars are not common in Material Design. Anyway, for now you can just overwrite the CSS with background-color: transparent and change also the font color to black or something visible (it's white by default) in left/center/right children. If you need to remove the shadow, you have modifier=\"noshadow\" available (and working :)).\n. @bdedardel @Maximvdw Yes, I think that's fixed in rc6. Please try it :)\n. @argelius Hmmm, in Chrome 50 at least all the items were displayed with left: 0% so only the last one was visible. With this change it updates all the items.\n. @argelius I have modified the first example to be something like this:\n```\n  \n\nBack\nFullscreen\n\n<ons-carousel initial-index=\"2\" swipeable overscrollable auto-scroll fullscreen auto-scroll-ratio=\"0.2\" animation-options=\"{duration: 0.1}\" var=\"carousel\">\n<ons-carousel-item ng-repeat=\"item in ['gray', '#085078', '#373B44', '#D38312']\" ng-style=\"{backgroundColor: item}\">\n  <div class=\"item-label\">{{item}}</div>\n</ons-carousel-item>\n</ons-carousel>\n\n<ons-bottom-toolbar>\n  <div style=\"float:right\" ng-click=\"carousel.next()\">\n    <ons-button modifier=\"quiet\">Next</ons-button>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"float:left\" ng-click=\"carousel.prev()\">\n    <ons-button modifier=\"quiet\">Prev</ons-button>\n  </div>\n</ons-bottom-toolbar>\n\n\n```\nThis also happens for non fullscreen carousels.\n. Actually I tried it in Firefox as well and had the same behavior. Maybe the code is wrong somehow?\n. @argelius This was just reported in the forums as well: https://community.onsen.io/topic/458/onsen2-carousel-seems-to-have-problem-with-ng-repeat\n. @anatoo Do you think we should maintain the animators as they are right now? Or do you have any idea about how you want them?\nCurrently I think users out of Onsen UI team cannot make their own animators in an easy way. And even for us, when we want to implement a new animator we just copy-paste 150 lines of code from an old animator and modify 3 or 4 values.\n. @bdedardel Hello! I would understand this error for rc.5, but I think this should be fixed in rc.6. I cannot see any problem with {refresh: true}: https://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/wWwYog?editors=101\nWe'll probably add data for popPage as well.\n. @bdedardel Yes, I modified the example and saw it. It's weird, I'll take a look and see why that happens. Anyway, you are getting an event object that has the real page as event.target, so maybe you can use that instead for now.\n. @IliaSky Thanks for looking at it! Yes, I imagined it was related to the DOM not being ready. I would also say that this is kind of normal behavior because init event is not related to ons-navigator, but to ons-page, and thus it has no idea about navi.topPage or anything else. \nTo be more specific, init event is fired when the page is attached to the DOM. The difference between the 2 cases you mention, @bdedardel , is that pushPage attaches the new page directly at the top but popPage with refresh needs to attach the refreshed page before the top page.\n@bdedardel As we mentioned before, you are getting the page object as event.target in the page's init event and that's the normal way to use it. If you want to use navi.topPage for some reason then you need to use navigator's postpop event or page's show event, although those are not the best place to initialize a page.\n. @argelius Yes, that's the purpose. There were 2 or 3 users who asked for this in the forums or issues. Since it feels more like completing the page.data object feature than adding something new I thought we could include it now. But nevermind, it's also fine for the next version.\n. @pa-de-solminihac If I'm not mistaken, we don't provide AngularJS in a normal installation with bower, npm or jspm. For example, you can see the files you get for rc.6 here.\nWe have a version of AngularJS in the main repo for our own testing and examples, but you can download and use another version if you want. While it's true that we haven't tested newer versions as much as 1.4.3, we have checked breaking changes even for 1.5.5 and didn't find anything to fix so far. We are actually using 1.5.5 in the interactive tutorial without troubles.\nI guess we will update it at some point but this should not affect anyone, so I'm closing this. Thanks for the suggestion anyway!\n. @pa-de-solminihac That's because the version you install is Onsen UI 1.3.14, which is based on AngularJS. \nI was speaking about Onsen UI 2 (sorry if I didn't specify!), what is still a release candidate and you need to specify the version with bower install onsenui#2.0.0-rc.7 to install it.\n. @argelius yeah I don't mind removing it. I checked it many times with different combinations and thought that there was a small delay while showing the mask, at least for md-lift. I don't remember adding delay for md-fade, though. Just remove, it's fine :)\n. @IliaSky Thanks for the feedback!\nAbout ons.util.createElement part 3 when would actually creating a single element from html be beneficial and the right approach?. To-Do app, adding a new task could be like creating a single element that could be appended not only at the end of the list, but also somewhere at the middle (if it's for example an alphabetical ordered list). Maybe this is not the best example but I believe there could exist some usecase. Anyway, I don't really have a strong opinion on this since it's not that important.\n@munsterlander Don't hesitate to share your opinion about all of this!\n. @DidiYordanov Can you check if this works with #1451 ? It works now in Edge so it should also work in Windows 10 and probably the other browsers.\n. @argelius I always forget it :)\n. @SharkChips Thanks for the detailed report. I was able to reproduce it in the interactive tutorial. We'll check it!\n. @masahirotanaka This works on Microsoft Edge. You can open this tutorial with Edge. I guess the window emulator has something different?\n. @jonathandotchin We tested it yesterday again and we could reproduce your exact problems only when choosing windows 8.1 as target version. With Windows 10.0 it worked without troubles :/\n. @rogervila If you use ons-splitter you can set side=\"right\". Few stuff like ons-back-button cannot be reverted right now, but probably it's not hard to make it manually.\n. It's still the same, side=\"right\" if I don't remember wrong. It should be in the docs. \nYou have a migration guide here if you want to start using Onsen UI 2.\n. @untsamphan We recently included onsenui.d.ts in the release but looks like it has some issues. I guess if you remove the typings entry from package.json it will work as before.\nIf you want to check the new typings we'd appreciate your feedback :)\n. @nuthinking Thanks! We recently changed the web and looks like we had some dead links here. We will probably rewrite the readme anyway :)\n. @masahirotanaka I kept the old version for the support and project build. I guess it's better if @argelius checks that part.\n. @argelius Thansk. Anything to modify about 5. \"How to manually build this project\" section can be shorter: It's for high-end users so I think it's enough if we just describe what command to use?\n. @badbod99 Can Crosswalk + native datepicker be an option for you?. @corneyl Thanks! This makes sense, we'll check it :)\n. @awajda I'm not sure if I get what you mean. Are the pages reset after loading? Is there any flickering? If you have issues both with and without tabbar, probably the real problem is in the navigator. However I cannot think about anything else with this information :/\nAnyway, we are now focused in version 2.0. It's release candidate and I think is better for production than 1.x right now, specially after we release rc.15.\nWe made a migration guide recently, check it out if you are interested.\n. @argelius We actually don't have bindings for ons-speed-dial. I guess we should add them now that it has open and close events.\n. I think I slightly prefer 3 since util would also contain createElement and maybe other methods.\nMaybe 2 is also fine if we can do import { createElement, modfierList } from 'onsenui'; and we don't export other methods.\n. @argelius What about contains? Like classList.\n. @argelius Thanks! It loos good. I just noticed a problem with the bindings in general, not only these ones. When controllers are fired, var attribute has not created the variable. It works with timeout 0. Any idea?\n. @rogervila I don't think there is any feature like that in v1.3.14. Those are just CSS components (without any logic) so looks like Chrome assumes you want to click them but Safari does not assume the same. If you want to trigger the checkbox always you need to add an event listener as @munsterlander says.\nIn v2, however, we do have a way to do this easier. If you are interested in migrating to v2, we have a guide for you.\nI'm closing this now, feel free to comment or open it again.\n. @cyclops24 Hey! Thanks for trying out Onsen UI. Some quick thoughts here:\nons.platform.select only works at the beginning of the app. Obviously we don't expect to change platform during the app execution :sweat_smile: \nTherefore, you should call ons.platform.select right after importing onsenui, not on button click event.\nIf what you want to do is some kind of OnsenUI+Meteor showcase application (like this), then you can use another function called ons.forcePlatformStyling('android'). This is not documented as is intended for internal usage and can be changed at any moment. This also needs ons.platform.select to be called at the very beginning with any value.\n. @cyclops24 Hello! Probably the fonts are not loaded. Try to import them here: https://github.com/MeteorDemoApps/OnsenUI2JS-demo/blob/be29cd85d9bd75983c3eb680851a12e3eb382330/imports/ui/layouts/app-body.js\nI think it should be something like:\nimport 'onsenui/css/font_awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css';\nimport 'onsenui/css/ionicons/css/ionicons.min.css';\nimport 'onsenui/css/material-design-iconic-font/css/material-design-iconic-font.min.css';\nAt least if you have the whole onsenui package in the same directory.\n. @cyclops24 Finally I got some time to check it. This problem is due to the way Meteor imports CSS when you write it in a JavaScript file. They simply copy the content of the file you import into a <style></style> tag in the <head> of index.html. However, they don't resolve the imports inside that file! Even if you manually include the icons CSS manually it won't work because those files also import the fonts at the same time, and that's not resolved by Meteor.\nI've set up a simple application using React Onsen UI and Meteor 1.4 (it's actually their ToDo app tutorial with React) working in this repo: https://github.com/frankdiox/OnsenUI-Meteor-ToDo\nHeroku link here.\nThe workaround is simple, just copy the fonts to the public folder in Meteor and it will be able to import them in client side.\n. @Drozdin Hello! Tabs where lazy in Onsen 1, what means that they were initialized only when you clicked on them the first time. This could cause delay the first time you see those pages. In Onsen 2 all the tabs are persistent and are loaded at the beginning. This behavior now triggers all your angular controllers at the start. There is no possible lazy load for tabs anymore.\nHowever, you possibly can move part of your code to tabbar's postchange event or page's show event (in angular you can use ons-postchange and ons-show attribute handlers).\nFeel free to open this again if you have further doubts.\n. @argelius @philolo1 Do you think d302145 is enough to fix #1510?\nI really think we need to change the API of _pushPage. Perhaps we can provide the update or run function as a parameter in options for pushPage and fallback to the core one if it's not provided...\nAnd please, let's use Volkswagen for the e2e tests...\n. @argelius @philolo1 I give up about e2e. I seriously vote for using Volkswagen :dog2:\n. @anatoo But that just put the leaving page toolbar transparent instantly, without any fade. With the changes it now fades.\n. @MyG494 What's the Onsen UI version in the template you are using? This should be fixed in the last versions at least for Angular1. Not sure about React, though.\n. @bladeSk Thanks for the report. Looks like this bug was introduced in rc.5. The problem is not about the initial page, it actually happens when there is no animation. We'll fix this :)\n. @argelius After the last changes this keeps 'none' animator synchronous and just fires show event asynchronously.\n. Right now creating a new animator is done like this (in ES5). I think we should also have a extend method to make this easier.\nFor the core API, perhaps we can move the element classes to ons object instead of window:\n- ons.OnsNavigatorElement.registerAnimator\n- ons.OnsNavigatorElement.animators.iOSSlide\n- var customAnimator = ons.OnsNavigatorElement.animators.iOSSlide.extend({ constructor: ..., push: ..., pop: ...})\nFor ES6 imports:\n- import { OnsNavigatorElement } from 'onsenui';\n- OnsNavigatorElement.animators.iOSslide\n- OnsNavigatorElement.registerElement\nMaybe we can drop Ons prefix.\nThe common use case is to change 1 or maybe 2 animations, so I guess it's not necessary to put all the animators together in only one object, although it's also a possibility.\n. Have you checked the tutorial for this? \n. @anatoo Looks good, thanks :smile: \n. I don't have a strong opinion on this. In case we implement it I guess it should be optional with type=\"submit\" or type=\"button\" as the normal HTML5 buttons. Too bad that we cannot extend HTMLButtonElement in CustomElements :sweat_smile: \n. @jvillamor-visp-net Looks like there's a problem with the import timing. Try this:\njavascript\nwindow.ons = require('onsenui/js/onsenui');\nrequire('onsenui/js/angular-onsenui');\n. @jvillamor-visp-net I think you can safely ignore that warning. Looks like Meteor is including jQuery and Angular also includes its own jqLite. If you know a way to change the dependency order in Meteor you can try to load AngularJS before jQuery.\nI don't think we need to release a meteor package since using NPM seems to be enough.\nBy the way, there is a OnsenUI-Meteor application here, although it's made with React instead of AngularJS.\nClosing this for now, feel free to open it again if you encounter any other issue.\n. @anatoo Yes, I think it's better to modify the default ones instead of adding a new one. I just changed it.\n. @qifuren1985 @IliaSky Just one quick note, you must remove pages using navi.children instead of navi.pages. The first one is the real HTMLCollection, but the second one is just a normal array that cannot modify the DOM.\nEdit: Actually if you do navi.pages[2].remove() with the index it should be fine as well.\n. @argelius Great! I guess we still need to unify pushPage and _pushPage or pass the update function to pushPage in options, right?\n. @gotenxds Are you using the latest version? There is no pushComponent anymore: #1517\n. @gotenxds Thanks for pointing it out. @anatoo Can you update that? Not sure if what changed was the name or something else.\n. @bado57 ons-template is just a template (surprisingly), it's not a component or instance of component. That implies its content is not attached to the DOM and you cannot simply get it with getElementById. I'm not sure how is the flow of your application, but putting ons-navigator inside ons-template means you have an ons-splitter or ons-tabbar loading it, right? If that's not the case then you don't need ons-template there.\nAlso, as @munsterlander pointed out, you are mixing Vanilla JS and AngularJS stuff. This is a JS pullhook and this is the AngularJS one. Hope it helps!\n. @anatoo Can we close this issue?\n. It's been merged so I'm closing this now. The website will be updated soon :smile: \nThanks guys!\n. @anatoo Great! Just one thing, instead of codepen-template maybe it can be called umd-template or something like that? I mean it's not really related to Codepen, right?\n. Continues in #1814. @argelius Great! Do we support Android 4+ again after this? \ud83d\ude05 \nJust one concern... Should we now expose some kind of ons.createElement('<ons-> ... </ons->') that uses this polyfill internally?\n. @argelius  Yes, I think that's fine.\n. @asial-matagawa The link to the community was a different issue and it was fixed in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/1540\n. @xemox I think there are many good points in v2, personally. We changed the API with the version change. There is a migration guide in the docs.\n. @rgins16 That makes sense, we should implement options.inputType or something simmilar :)\nIn the meantime you can create your own ons-alert-dialog with that input.\n. Thanks @kanakoubukata ! I just made a PR to fix this.\n. I got a working version of this proposed createElement but unfortunately there's something I didn't think about. Some components are not using contentReady (because they don't need content) so they are compiled directly before I set the attributes. So unless we want to implement attributesReady I guess we should forget about this version of createElement \ud83d\ude05\nDo you have any suggestion for this?\nAnother secondary problem is that it's not possible to correctly parse HTML/XLM with RegExp and detect errors.\n. @erikanthonywall @Meloncon Thanks for reporting! We will check this as soon as we can, but right now we are traveling to London for Angular Connect event.\n. I just came back to Tokyo and will try to reproduce this tomorrow!\n. In any case, this is likely to be related to the CustomElements polyfill update. We didn't change too much since  rc.16 or rc.17 except that so you can probably use that version for now. The changelog is here.\n. The app in the repo is already using rc.17 and actually that release only modifies type definitions, so rc.17 works. I got the error only with 2.0.0 right when I do import ons from 'onsenui'.\nLooks like Blaze is running something under the hood and it breaks. There is a related question here without Onsen UI: stackoverflow - meteor forum\nI'm not sure if this is something fixable on this side. I will try find some solution anyway.\n. @erikanthonywall @Meloncon @robort @kaiyes Looks like this issue is related to Blaze (yes, it runs somehow under React). Maybe there is something in the new polyfill that Blaze doesn't like, but it is not an issue in Onsen UI core library. If you want to use Blaze then rc.17 is compatible.\nIf you don't need Blaze because you use React for example, then simply run this:\nmeteor remove blaze-html-templates\nmeteor add static-html\nThat fixes this issue for me with onsenui@2.0.0 and react-onsenui@1.0.0. Perhaps you will need to try meteor run more than once after that.\nMore info here: https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/5580\n. Fixed in e74c931 .. @anatoo @argelius Aren't we using the interactive tutorial for this instead?\n. @anatoo Yes but it is ready already since you implemented the tutorials. It's even in the webpage: https://onsen.io/v2/docs/angular2/ons-navigator.html\nWe only need to specify the tutorial in the componens that has a different URL from the vanilla tutorials. For example, ons-alert-dialog (it shows ons-dialog instead). The rest are automatically converted, we do something like --> hoge.replace('vanilla', 'angular2');, so if they are under Reference category and has the same ID it works.\nWell, we can specify it in all of them if we want as well.\n. @HugoGiraudel Thanks for reporting. This was already fixed in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/1596\nIt will be released in 2.0.1, probably next week.\n. @gotenxds I guess you are trying to call methods from the directive instead of the native element. Can you have a look at this (the second example) and try again?\n. @anatoo @asial-matagawa Related to this issue, there are other problems in docs like pushPage. It says page, options.page or options.pageHTML are string and say to use ons-template. This is directly taken from the core library so I think it should be overwritten by Angular2 docs.. @argelius Looks good, thanks!\n. @corneyl Thanks for reporting. material modifier was overwriting transparent modifier, we just fixed that. However, I don't think transparent modifier is what you are looking for. It sets the background to transparent but it also removes the box-shadow. And the toolbar-buttons are white by default so you wouldn't see anything. I think this modifier is only useful if you want to have an image as the page background, like this.\nFor your case you can modify the stylus files or just apply some custom CSS in your app:\n.navigation-bar--material {\n    background-color: #fff;\n  }\n  .back-button--material,\n  .toolbar-button--material,\n  .navigation-bar--material__left,\n  .navigation-bar--material__center,\n  .navigation-bar--material__right {\n    color: #888;\n  }\n  .toolbar-button--material:active,\n  .back-button--material:active{\n    background-color: rgba(200,200,200,0.15);\n  }\nSomething like that should work.\n. @bdedardel Hey, thanks for reporting! Internally ons-toolbar is moved around to fix scolling issues. Basically, the final structure is like this:\n```\n\n...\n\n     form\n     ...\n  \n\n```\nThe toolbar must be separated from the content. Closing this now since there's nothing to fix :)\n. @argelius Thanks!\n. @argelius Thanks!\n. @frosdqy Thanks for reporting. It's been fixed already and will be available for 2.0.3.\nIf you want to use 2.0.2 I think you can just wrap your init code in a timeout:\ndocument.addEventListener('init', function(event) {\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    event.page.data\n  }, 0);\n});\n. @nodefish @argelius Actually this behavior changed somewhere during RC. Some versions ago everything was wrapped inside page__content and the toolbar was hoisted. That was kind of absurd because the toolbar was moved twice when it could just remain on its original position. That's basically the change, the toolbar and other elements like ons-fab, ons-modal, etc. don't move from the original position.\nSo yeah, it should only be wrapped by ons-page, nothing else :/\n<ons-page>\n  <ons-toolbar></ons-toolbar>\n  <div class=\"content\">\n     This will become \".page__content\"\n  </div>\n</ons-page>\n. As explained in previous answers, this is now the correct behavior. Elements like Toolbar, Fab, etc. are not moved from its original position (so there's no need for hoisting them afterward). Page's content div can be created beforehand with .page__content class or simply .content (the other class will be added automatically).. @anatoo Can you check commit a2a12a4 ? I need to do that to make it work with the previous commits in Angular 2. Do you think that can be a problem? It's doing the same as ons-input.\n. @anatoo \n\nI think we should use WeakSet instead of saving directly within element.\n\nI guess you mean WeakMap. I actually thought about using that so I can use the pageElement as a key, but I didn't know if we can combine it with TypeScript and without polyfills. Do you think it's fine?\n. Example for this error: https://community.onsen.io/topic/1106/ripple-attribute-does-not-work-on-safari. @dohomi Even thought it would be nice, it doesn't really depend on this branch. These are just bindings/wrappers for the core library. I think we would need to change many things in the core to make SSR possible (I haven't seen many examples of Custom Elements + SSR so far). Apart from that, the main focus is still mobile apps rather than mobile websites.. @Nyarum \u3048\u3063\u3068\u3002\u3002\u3002This was released 2 weeks ago (alpha.0). I know it might be a bit confusing since this PR is not merged, but it was released from here (currently solving CSS conflicts in master branch). More info on the website.. @toramanlis Thanks for reporting!\n. @Wieltje It's a property, not an attribute:\ndocument.querySelector('ons-back-button').onClick = function() {\n      alert('onClick event overridden');\n    };\n@argelius What do you think about considering onclick attribute as well?\n. @paulg446 The item is added but the styles are not correct. Simply call carousel's refresh() method after adding an element to fix that. For example: document.querySelector('ons-carousel').refresh();.\n. @FREEZX Hey! Sorry for the late reply. I think this is now the correct approach, thanks. Right now we don't have a way to document CSS classes so I'd like to make a component that uses this internally with autostyling feature. We will address this when we finish some other stuff we are doing :). @FREEZX Hey! We made an ons-select component with your Stylus code. I've merged it into another branch and will be released soon. Therefore, I'm closing this now. Thanks!. @nodefish Do you mean you'd like to have something like 'init:pageID' event names? Is there any limitation with the current approach?\nI think adding a listener to every element could be troublesome (especially speaking about pages in a navigator). It's simpler to just set the listener in the navigator itself or the document and then filter by ID or something else.\nSame for the other events, if you just want a listener to be triggered by a specific tabbar, then add the listener to that tabbar instead of the document. You can also stop propagation there so the event does not bubble.\nI guess it could be possible to fire both init and init:pageID (for example) at the same time and let the developer choose, but I don't see it as a necessary feature/fix. What do you think, @argelius ?\n. @nodefish Sorry for the late reply. I'll try to answer here:\n\nfor ons-page: in theory, what I'm saying is the event name could still be init but the listener would be definable on the ons-page itself - key word being definable. And then if you want to centralize all pages' init events on the navigator which I agree is a good practice, then you would define the handler on navigator and the events would bubble up from ons-page. However, I don't have a problem personally with ons-page being like this. It's more of a \"devil's advocate\" question involving events overall.\n\nons-page is a template (just a string) until it is actually created, so there is no way to set a handler before that. The only possibility would be to pass a \"controller\" or \"initializer\"  function to things like pushPage or setting an attribute in the template that points to a global function (<ons-page init=\"window.fn\">. I don't like too much any of those solutions and I don't really see why that could be better than using bubbling events as we have always done in HTML/JS. The only thing you need to know is that event object contains the target element that originally fired the event, so you can check its ID, tag name or use the element itself directly.\n\nI'm not 100% sure if a code change or a documentation change is what I want to suggest. I just recall being a bit confused when I had more than 1 ons-tabbar in my app (nested), and I wanted an event handler for only the outer one. It wasn't a huge problem to fix it (just use event.target.id in a switch statement), but it seemed to work a bit differently than I expected.\n\nI think in all the examples of init event with more than 1 page we check event.target.id. For the other components it should be similar. I guess you can also do something like event.stopPropagation() in the inner tabbar.\n\nAs far as I know, bubbling should only happen if both the nested element and its parent have handlers registered for that event, and yet I only assigned a handler in one of them (outermost one in my case). I guess now, thinking about this, that even if I didn't specify a handler in both elements, Onsen UI probably adds handlers to all ons- elements behind the scenes, and these events bubble.\n\nI think bubbling should always happen, otherwise the components need to be aware of all their parents/children and we don't want to have this kind of dependency. They should be completely independent from each other in general. In normal HTML/JS, events bubble regardless the parents/children so I don't really see the need of changing this. Also, Onsen UI is not adding listeners for the common exposed events, only for inner stuff.\n\nWhat if you have different kinds of elements which use the same event names? For example, if we have an ons-carousel nested inside an ons-tabbar page: both of them have a postchange event, so if the ons-carousel fires postchange by default and it bubbles up (just like my previous example's inner tabbar, for which I did not define a handler, fires and bubbles up prechange) , would that fire the tabbar postchange event? That seems a bit messy.\n\nI agree on the fact that having similar event names for different components is not very nice (I guess it's late to change that due to BC). However, this is again handled exactly in the same way: by checking the event object. I mean, we expect developers to use that object like in any normal event, it's not just a \"trick\" (these are \"normal\" events as well).\nIf you think any particular item in the docs is unclear after this, please indicate it or open a PR. Thanks!. @expertsa I made a small example. Can you check if this works with Onsen UI 2.0.4? If it doesn't, which device and OS version are you using?\nAlso, ons-sliding-menu is there for backward compatibility reasons. The new component for the menu is ons-splitter.. @keijiodagawa I can reproduce it in 2.0.4 but looks like it's already fixed in 2.0.5 (master branch right now). We will try to release soon.. @keijiodagawa ng-show has nothing to do with Onsen UI. It works the same way using only AngularJS: https://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/eBedzv\nDid you mean ons-show?. @asial-matagawa I cannot actually reproduce the behavior in my Chrome 54.0.2840.100. In any case, can you try with <ons-list-item><div class=\"center\">{{content}}</div></ons-list-item>? That's the way it should be used although I'm not completely sure if it affects.. @asial-matagawa Onsen UI core creates <div class=\"center\"> automatically if the user doesn't provide it, like in the toolbar. I guess there's a conflict with AngularJS in that situation. I think we should promote writing this divs like we do in the toolbar to avoid DOM manipulation. We already have this information in the overview guide and also in ons-list-item reference page. The only place where it's not updated is in the tutorial. I guess it was made like that for simplicity. We can of course try to fix it for the old use case but still I think we should try to avoid DOM manipulation by including this divs in our examples and docs.. @keijiodagawa @asial-matagawa It's just like ons-toolbar. This is also possible:\n<ons-list-item ng-repeat=\"(key, row) in value\">\n    <div class=\"left\">({{key}})</div>\n    <div class=\"center\">{{row.name}}</div>\n    <div class=\"right\">({{row.memo.test1}})</div>\n</ons-list-item>. @argelius Just one thing. What about the redux navigator PR in the other repo?. @asial-matagawa This should be fixed after the last refactoring. The problem, as you know, is that Zone.js breaks the tab's loaded promise somehow. In any case, I think it should be working now.. @asial-matagawa Could you try with master branch? I made a refactor of pageLoader that hasn't been released yet #1671 \nangular2-onsenui@1.0.0-rc.3 might need the changes I made in master branch but they are not released.. @asial-matagawa I made the refactor 4 weeks ago and it included changes to the core and also angular2 bindings. looks like angular2-onsenui@1.0.0-rc.3 was released 3 weeks ago but the core is still the same. I think this must be the problem. #1727 could also be related.. This should be fixed in core v2.2.0 and #1855 . @argelius Thank you! The issues have been fixed :)\n. @asial-matagawa Should we merge this now?\n. @asial-matagawa Thanks!. @asial-matagawa This is not an ons-back-button. It's an ons-toolbar-button with an ons-icon and text inside it. It does not contain the necessary CSS to be aligned and it doesn't work with the slide-ios animation either.\nI guess it's used in this way to add a custom \"onclick\", but the ons-back-button already has an onClick and even options properties to overwrite its behavior. Perhaps it could be a bit hard to use in AngularJS since it's a DOM property. Maybe we should add a directive like ng-ons-click or whatever.\nIn any case, I don't think we can consider this as a bug.... @asial-matagawa It's documented in the ons-back-button reference. The only problem is that there is not specific directive in Angular so it is necessary to get the DOM element and modify the prop. I think we should add an attribute for this in AngularJS. React or Vue don't have any problem since they can modify props easily. I'm not sure about Angular2 either.. @danbeck Thanks for reporting. I think this bug is probably due to the fact that the tab pages are added with display: none, so when the carousel tries to calculate its initial position the width is 0. Perhaps we should try with visibility: hidden instead since this way it wouldn't collapse.\nEdit: I just tried in the core lib and it does not happen. Perhaps is something different related to React components.. @anatoo Thanks for the fix and prettifying the if-else :). @anatoo @asial-matagawa Thansk for the fixes! I was already checking but for some reason the changelog.md made the tests fail. Rebuilding now.\n . Fixed in #1852 . @anatoo Thanks! Yeah sure, I haven't slowly tested performance or memory leaks yet, I'll do that before merging :). @anatoo I think the reflows are now gone. At least in Chrome browser I cannot see any related problem anymore. Only with Angular1 bindings I can see some reflows due to Angular itself invalidating the layout. In any case, this also happened in the old implementation of lazy repeat so it shouldn't be a problem.\nCould you please check it on mobile Safari once again? Thanks!\n. @anatoo Oh I see, thanks! I guess I should wait until I'm in the office to test this in Safari.... @anatoo I've tested this in MacOS Safari and iOS Safari and can't break it anymore. And no reflows, I think it should be good to go :slightly_smiling_face: \n. @pvnr0082t Thanks!\n@asial-matagawa Was Onsen UI fully working with CDNJS? I remember there was some issue but I don't remember what happened with it.. @asalgueiro  I found this issue after fixing it :sweat_smile: Thanks for reporting anyway.. @anatoo Thanks! :+1: . @koheiokazaki This is similar to this post. It's just a rejected promise. Maybe we should catch it in back button and just print a warning or something instead.. @asial-matagawa I believe this happens because the automatic styling is actually working properly. It removes tappable modifier and adds ripple attribute. disable-auto-styling attribute should avoid this.. @zineer You are mixing JS and CSS versions (2.0.5 and latest, respectively). Simply use the latest version for JS as well or specify \"2.0.5\" in the CDN URL for the CSS.. @ivaylopivanov Did you include cordova.js?. @matoilic Thanks a lot! I will test this on Monday and merge it!. @asial-matagawa thanks!. @misterjunio Thanks! I merged this branch into vue2-test so I'm closing this PR.. @asial-matagawa The background color should go in <div class=\"background\" style=\"...\"> instead of <div=\"content\">, but I guess it should keep the !important anyway.. Looks like the problem with Vue.js bindings and ons-input was related to the way Vue's v-model directive internally works with non native inputs. Nothing to do with ons-input implementation but in any case I guess it would be better to refactor it a bit.. @sukima We decided to split ons-input into different components: ons-checkbox, ons-radio, etc. There are no more attributes that modify the compilation. Now it should work well in Ember since the components are quite simple. It will be released in 2.4.0 in a few days (already in master branch) :+1: . @TheSegfault That's probably because the page is not ready by the time you print it. Try to use $timeout(..., 0); just to check it. The page will be ready on init event, so you could use ons-init handler. It would be nice if the controller runs once the page is ready, like in v1 I think.\n@puku0x What's the terrible bug? Also, pushedOptions is not documented because it could be removed, that's why data is there. Isn't it enough?. @puku0x The bug with ons-template is due to the fact that Codepen inserts the external files at the bottom of the BODY rather than in the HEAD. We fixed this some time ago but perhaps something has changed in Chrome and it's broken again.\nAbout the other issues, it's all related to what I answered to the original post. It's a timing issue, you are saving something into vm.title that doesn't exist in that moment. If you use ons-init handler you can make sure everything is there.We should delay the controller somehow until the page is ready, though. I fixed everything here: https://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/ZLrzvN  (and its using data instead of pushedOptions). @puku0x Glad I could help! :)\nBy the way, you can use event.target to get the actual page instead of using navi.topPage as well.. From next release (probably 2.3.0), this behavior will be changed back to 2.0.4 :). @nodefish I believe the animation was made like that on purpose. The whole previous page moves upwards, not only the toolbar. To be honest I haven't seen it with colored iOS status bar. In any case, since 2.0.5 it's quite easy to make new animations or extend existing ones, so you can simply make your own lift animation if you don't like the current one. Probably it's easier to extend lift-md and modify the background mask.. @nodefish Oh, maybe we should check how's the native one then. I haven't seen many \"lift\" animations in iOS actually so I'm not sure about it. I'm opening this again as a reminder :). @misterjunio Looks great, thanks!. @asial-matagawa Perhaps we should check that the parent is document.body? This way we show the warning if the template is not located in index.html under <body> tag directly. I think that's the desired behavior.\nAlso, I think we should test the native <template> tag and see if we can use it instead of <ons-template>.... @asial-matagawa Looks like it still fails in Safari. Can you have a look at it?. @asial-matagawa Thanks! In any case, as I mentioned the other day, perhaps we should look into native template and deprecate ons-template. Looks like @anatoo also thinks alike :). @madagon Hi! ons-template should not be nested in any component! Use it directly in the body of index.html, nowhere else. #1802\nI think that will solve the issue. Otherwise, please try Crosswalk plugin :)\n. @madagon Hmm... Did you try it this way?\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n<ons-tabbar>\n    <ons-tab page=\"tab1.html\" label=\"Tab1\" icon=\"pencil-square-o\" active=\"true\"></ons-tab>\n    <ons-tab page=\"tab2.html\" label=\"Tab2\" icon=\"film\"></ons-tab>\n</ons-tabbar>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nWhen I said\n\nshould not be nested in any component! Use it directly in the body of index.html\n\nI actually meant it :sweat_smile: . Move your ons-template to the body tag or otherwise create your pages in separate files without ons-template tag. If it doesn't work this way, then we should worry about it.\nAnd I mentioned Crosswalk because officially we only support Android 4.4+, and 4.0+ with Crosswalk.\nAnyway, glad it works now :)\n. @misterjunio Thanks a lot! Few things:\n  - Do you think we need var attribute in ons-select for AngularJS? We have it for ons-switch but not for ons-input. Basically, var avoids the need of accessing the DOM element (what should not be necessary in AngularJS). If you think ng-model and ng-repeat is enough then it's fine.\n  - Could you add docs in directives/ons-select.js? All the other components documents on, off, once, etc.\n  - Could you modify the core ons-select and add support for an existing select element inside ons-select? This would allow users to use ng-options if they really want it, among other things. This can be done in a different PR if you prefer, I don't mind.. @misterjunio Yes, I think either of these two templates should be valid:\n<ons-select>\n  <option></option>\n  <option></option>\n</ons-select>\n<ons-select>\n  <select>\n    <option></option>\n    <option></option>\n  </select>\n</ons-select>\nSo instead of creating the select element always, just check first if it exists and use it instead (and only set the ID if it's created).. @misterjunio Great! I think you need to push the docs and changelog, though :sweat_smile: \n. @misterjunio :+1: :+1: :hotsprings: \n. #1837. @drwelby Hi! It's not necessary to manually import the icons. onsenui.css file is already importing them. If you installed onsenui and react-onsenui with NPM, this should be enough:\nimport 'onsenui/css/onsenui.css';\nimport 'onsenui/css/onsen-css-components.css';\nI just tried it with create-react-app and npm start. It shows the icons as expected with a code like this:\nimport { Icon } from 'react-onsenui';\n...\n <Icon icon=\"md-face\" />`\nnpm run build places the icons in /build/static/media/... and in the generated CSS I can see something like this src:url(/static/media/ionicons.19e65b89.eot);. I guess that's fine.. @anatoo @asial-matagawa @misterjunio @masahirotanaka I'm testing a new way to report issues. This is an issue generated from the tutorial app. We should redirect users to the tutorial app if they want to report a bug so they can reproduce the error there first. It gets the latest released version so we ensure the bug wasn't already fixed in new versions.\nThis generated issue has a link to the tutorial that only works when the issue has been created, not when it's still a template.\nOpinions?. @misterjunio Maybe just writing Select template in the title instead of Select tutorial is enough... I think it's easier if they start from an existing template than from a specific empty page to report bugs. But yeah, it could be confusing.... ;_;. I've mentioned about this several times so I completely agree.\n\nWhy did we add ons-template?\n\nI guess Android < 4.4 and IE have something to do with it: http://caniuse.com/#feat=template\nWe can use a polyfill for those versions if it's completely necessary, although we don't officially support them anymore.\nFurthermore, I've tested it and looks like possible to do:\n<template>\n  elements here\n  <script>\n     code here\n  </script>\n</template>\nI think that could be very nice in some situations. Many users are confused because <script> tag doesn't work in <ons-template> or separate files.\n. Implemented in master branch. <script> tags are supported through page life-cycle hooks :+1: . @BusinessLoader We'll do this and probably provide ons.preload([...]) as well :+1: \n. This is implemented in master branch. It does not \"keep alive\" the elements, but caches the template to avoid extra XHR requests :+1: . @caiobalthazar Oops, thanks!. @BusinessLoader Thanks!\n@anatoo Do you think we can do something with this now that we are refactoring the CSS?. @Seraphims PhantomJS does not implement recent web APIs so it's not possible to test things like Web Components with it. If you want to try a headless browser, try the new headless chrome. It is supported in Karma since v2.1.0. We are using it for unit tests in Onsen UI core.. @misterjunio Thanks! Just minor things:\n1. Please use the strict equality operator (===) instead of == just to be consistent with the styles.\n2. type=\"NUMBER\" will not meet the equality because of the letter case but it will still be considered as a number input. You can either use toLowerCase method or even better, just check the type property instead of the attribute if it's available. If the attribute type is omitted, getAttribute returns null but the property type falls back to its default value text.\n```\n\n\n\n$('input').type\n\"number\"\n$('input').getAttribute('type')\n\"NUMBER\"\n```\n\n\nBy the way, if you add something like Closes #issueNumber or Fixes #issueNumber in the commit message it will automatically close that issue.. @misterjunio Thanks!. @misterjunio Thanks! Can you make a quick unit-test for this feat? We don't want it to disappear again.... @misterjunio Thanks!. Implemented in #1916. @sdmgeek What is your use case? Do you just want to run the previous page's controller (Angular controller) again? I think that can be done in a page lifecycle event such as show.. @sdmgeek options.refresh is just removing the parent page and creating it again. I guess you are calling some function on init event, so you just need to call the same function on show, hide, prepop events or override the ons-back-button behavior (with onClick dom property) in order to pass a callback. I think it would be enough with any of these possibilities.. @sdmgeek pageElement._destroy(); pageElement.remove(); is probably enough. You can do that and then insert it again but the idea is that you update the parent page before popping. I think you mean prepop event. You can simply get the navigator and access to the previous page with navigator.pages[navigator.pages.length - 2] or something similar.. Even though ons-template is not deprecated, template is already supported and we can keep the other one for backward compatibility. Its implementation is quite small. Also, navigator.removePage is already implemented. Closing this.. @asial-matagawa stage-3 should be safe to use and it includes transform-object-rest-spread, yes.\nBy the way, Angular2 bindings only use es2015 but I didn't want to modify that. You guys can update it if you want.. @anatoo Awesome, thanks!. @anatoo What do you think about this?. @anatoo we are going to test now and I guess you forgot to merge this, right? :+1: . @francesco-strazzullo Hi, thanks for the PR! This is just the \"master\" handler, which is always navigator.app.exitApp(), so you could set it back by just writing that line. I think what you really want to set is a handler for some specific component like Navigator, Dialog, Page, etc. Am I wrong?\nFor example, this is the core ons-page which have a onDeviceBackButton property. More info about components handlers here.\nLooks like there is no device back button handler prop in React Components so I think that's the place where we should fix this. We should have a prop onDeviceBackButton or something similar in the React components.\nCould you try to modify that instead (bindings/react/src/components)? Otherwise, if you can access the DOM element (with refs) you can set the property there as a quick dirty fix.\n. @francesco-strazzullo Thanks! A couple of things: I think we don't need 72652b5 anymore, right? Also, according to React docs:\n\nReact doesn't call componentWillReceiveProps with initial props during mounting. It only calls this method if some of component's props may update.\n\nTherefore, I guess it doesn't take the initial value. Am I wrong? We are setting a similar prop in componentDidMount for PullHook. I guess that means it is \"init only\" value, but that's probably fine. Can you have a look at this?\nThanks a lot!. @francesco-strazzullo Thanks! I'll do this for the other components as well before I forget :). @matoilic Thanks a lot! I'm OK with this, I'd just like to ping @anatoo first.. @rgins16 Thanks for reporting. I'm curious, did you have any problem with the \"Report an issue\" button in the tutorial app? There's no need to create a Codepen.\nAbout the issue itself, I'll investigate what happened in 2.0.5 to make this change but, in any case, the correct way to do this in v2 is using page lifecycle events. You can easily wait for it with ons-init handler. Simply add <ons-page ons-init=\"event = $event.target.data.event\"> to your second page and it'll work normally.. @rgins16 The problem in the code is that Angular controller runs before the new page is ready. That means that, by the time you access to myNavigator.topPage.data, nothing exists yet. It would work by using a $timeout as well, but to make sure everything is ready you can just use page lifecycle events (check also the \"event handling\" section).\nTherefore, instead of doing:\n```\n\n.controller(..., function($scope) {\n  // init data\n// custom functionality\n});\n```\nJust do:\n```\n\n.controller(..., function($scope) {\n  $scope.initData = function(event) {\n    // init data (event.target is the new page)\n  };\n// custom functionality\n});\n```\n. @anatoo Thanks for the fix! :+1: \n. @misterjunio That Lazy Repeat example looks exactly like the old one before I modified it :sweat_smile: \nThe change I made is for checking that Lazy Repeat works with dynamic heights. Do you think we don't need that?. @misterjunio Don't worry! I know it's ugly code but it's useful for testing :sweat_smile: \n. @asial-matagawa Thanks! :+1: . @rgins16 Oh, I think @misterjunio is already looking at this, don't worry :)\nFor the next time, if possible please do use https://tutorial.onsen.io/ and hit Report an issue. We will get a working example with the code.. @rgins16 Yes, it's really useful to provide a minimum app where the issue is reproduced. In order to do that, you can choose a similar template in the tutorial app (navigator/tabbar/splitter/dialogs...) and modify it until the issue is visible. Then, you can report it directly from there and we will get a link to it.. @airamrguez Thanks for the PR! Is this also an issue in other components that support device back button (dialogs, splitter...)?. @asial-matagawa Some more fixes. Looks like the toolbar's zIndex was updated at some point but the fab's wasn't. Also, when popping pages in the navigator, the FAB/SpeedDial disappears suddenly without animation. It should be done asynchronously.\nI removed 2 broken tests because I think they don't make sense, the show/hide should be tested in another way.. @asial-matagawa It only depended on ons-page and its lifecycle. Anyway, I added an extra show that also fixes the animation so it doesn't directly depend on the page anymore for this. Should be fine now.. @asial-matagawa Thanks! Is there any reason why we should have both polyfill and polyfill/vendor? Isn't it enough with polyfills/ for example?. I don't think it makes any difference, we don't really need to separate them. But anyway, I guess it's not that important. Thanks!. This only occurs with md- icons. I guess this was originally prepared for fa- and ion- ones. The .zmdi class ni material icons overwrites the font-size from this feature.. @asial-matagawa That's great, thanks! Hopefully everything will be more consistent from now :sweat_smile: \nHowever, even though this PR is meant to fix issues, I think we should be a bit careful with this. Perhaps we can release the other master branch fixes in 2.2.1 and release this alone in 2.2.2 or even in 2.3.0. What do you think?. @asial-matagawa Thanks!\nDoes this contain everything from master? I guess we can directly merge master into production if that's the case.. @asial-matagawa I see, then we don't need to check it right now. It doesn't happen in Cordova apps anyway.. @puku0x Just put it at the tabbar level, not inside its pages. Example here. I think position: absolute does not fix it in the desired way since it would be located inside the page content, not over the tabbar.. @puku0x Oh, I didn't know it was used like that in a native app. Let's see what @anatoo thinks about it. Perhaps is fine to use absolute then if it doesn't break anything.. My mistake, this is actually working well. I just called private _popPage instead of popPage.. @misterjunio Thanks!!. @rgins16 Thanks for reporting! I believe this issue is the same as #1871 . To be honest, the new lazyRepeat refresh was made to update the currently rendered items when their content change. I see now that some developers also use it to remove rendered items so we'll try to support this use case :+1: \n. @rgins16 Thanks for the input. I think you can achieve what you want by simply wrapping everything in a div. Check this pen. It could also be done with CSS, but right now LazyRepeat do not support margins so the scroll could break. Hope the example helps.. @yarysh Thanks a lot for the PR!\n@asial-matagawa @misterjunio Can any of you macboys have a look at this? :stuck_out_tongue: . @Chozzle Oops, looks like a wild bug. We'll fix it, thanks for reporting \ud83d\ude05 . This was fixed a while ago in 2.3.0 :+1: . @rgins16 I believe this is not an Onsen UI issue. Angular's $watch by default only tracks the reference of complex data like Object or Array, not the properties. If you want to do a \"deep watch\", including object properties, pass a third argument to $watch with true value, as described in their docs, although it might not be very performant. Otherwise, have a look at $watchGroup or $watchCollection. Hope it helps!. @asial-matagawa True, I just moved that and also testing to contributing.md. Merging this now :)\n. @GoaGit react-onsenui@1.2.0 was released the same day that onsenui@2.2.0 was released. Have you tried updating react-onsenui?. ons-list-item has no real connection to ons-list, so it could be renamed to ons-item or just be used as ons-list-item inside anything else (like in ons-card). Maybe it should apply \"nodivider\" by default and provide \"shortdivider\" modifier instead of the current situation.... We have never tried to support this so I'd be surprised if it just works :P\nThe main focus of Onsen UI is hybrid apps, where I think server rendering is not that useful. Therefore, it is not on the roadmap for now.. @asial-matagawa Basically, we have long comments for show, hide, onDeviceBackButton, visible, cancelable, etc. repeated in 4 components (5 with action sheet). What I mean with \"docs inheritance\" is to provide a way to put all of these common docs in BaseDialog file and get them from there.. @asial-matagawa Please have a quick look at this. It is trying to simplify the dialogs methods. Perhaps we can remove them if we implement ons.createElement.. @airamrguez @misterjunio  I think I found the issue. Not sure why but the yarn.lock file in this PR had some URLs changed to an IP, and this IP was timing out. I will revert the revert :D\n-react@^15.4.2:\n -  version \"15.4.2\"\n -  resolved \"https://registry.yarnpkg.com/react/-/react-15.4.2.tgz#41f7991b26185392ba9bae96c8889e7e018397ef\"\n +react@^15.5.3:\n +  version \"15.5.3\"\n +  resolved \"http://192.168.1.199:4873/react/-/react-15.5.3.tgz#84055382c025dec4e3b902bb61a8697cc79c1258\". @airamrguez And by the way, thanks for also updating react-hot-loader :)\nI'll try to have a look at the other PRs soon.. @asial-matagawa That's why I removed that side effect from ons.createElement. It returns the new element and does not attach it. For attaching the element I mentioned ons.portal instead.. @misterjunio @asial-matagawa This use case could work without problems: var myItem = ons.createElement('<ons-list-item>...</ons-list-item>');. However, if we pass a path to an external file, it cannot be done synchronously. Therefore, we can return a promise if the first parameter is a path. What do you think? This is some kind of \"overloaded\" function.. I guess that would make ons.createElement('<ons-list-item>...</ons-list-item>') kind of useless since the good thing there is that it behaves like document.createElement and is synchronous. That's my opinion at least, but maybe it's better. Let's see what @misterjunio thinks about.. @airamrguez @anatoo I think this PR is making status-bar-fill attribute to be present in more than 1 page, which is wrong for nested pages.\nfindParent only checks the first parent and returns null if it's not a modal (most of the times). It doesn't check further ancestors to see if status-bar-fill is there.\nCan we remove this?. @airamrguez Thanks. Just removing the negation ! or the whole thing works well, but I'm not sure what's necessary to keep the modal fix.. @airamrguez hasAPageControlChild is there to fix another situation (#1340), and that regex would get too complex because pages can be inside divs, body or dynamically added wrappers.\nCan you confirm that this is the situation you want to keep? https://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/jGBZay?editors=0010\nThat works in 2.6.0 and still works when I remove , e => !e.nodeName.match(/ons-modal/i) for the code. I guess it should be fine.. @airamrguez Yes, that's one of the things I was fixing but then I got the problem with the modal thing and I came to this PR :sweat_smile: \nI'll check that code tomorrow and try to find a solution :+1: . @airamrguez Fixed in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/2194/commits/0b4006a6821c273c331adcdb9e8e8183e10afe2b#diff-52c49156be6687c4b5dfefe178df4972R187\nThe child pages were filling the status bar before the parent page. I tried your codepen with this version and everything works :+1: . @airamrguez My bad, I added another fix after that which prevents modal pages from getting status-bar-fill. However, I think this is now the correct behavior for the core.\nThe problem after this is the way React bindings create ons-modal. It is placed in a .page__extra div inside the page itself instead of using a \"portal\" like all the other dialogs. I've changed this in my local version and now the modal can be used normally without renderModal function. The only problem is that onShow and onHide would be renamed to onPostShow and onPostHide like all the other dialogs (and also onPreShow and onPreHide would be available). What do you think about that change for react-onsenui@1.7.0? --- Commit here: 2fae27b\nBtw, I'm so glad I implemented ons.mockStatusBar, don't want to imagine testing all of this on iOS :sweat_smile: . @airamrguez Yes, I've been checking the new portal API and will replace the old one when I get some time :+1: . @airamrguez I've implemented Dialogs with ReactDOM.createPortal new API, but I've found a problem. A dialog could be unmounted while showing (pop a page that contains a toast, for example), which would make it disappear without any animation. Currently it's possible to delay the dialog unmount with code like this, but I don't know any alternative when using createPortal. Do you have any idea? The commit is this a2c0e6e. @airamrguez Thanks for the code! I'll try to come back to this later this week when I have some time, right now I need to focus on something else. Basically I think this is the same issue https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10826\nWhen a page is unmounted (parent component), the dialog (child component) will also be unmounted synchronously even if its DOM node is not rendered inside the parent. I guess this could be tricked in some way, like rendering null and just creating/destroying the dialog asynchronously.. @airamrguez I think the situation I described is kind of similar to what happens in your codepen when clicking on \"Pop page from modal\". Modal starts fading out but at some point the page animation finishes and removes the modal element. As a result, the modal animation ends abruptly.\nI think we'll need to stick to unstable_renderIntoContainer for now :/\n. @rgins16 Hmm... You have 3 pages, you get 3 init events. That's the expected behavior.\nons-init is a simple event listener, it doesn't care if the event is fired by the element itself or a child. If you need to filter, check $event object. Something like this works:\n$scope.init = function($event){\n      if ($event.currentTarget === $event.target) {\n        console.log('init');\n      }\n    };\n. I've been checking this and looks like a bug in UIWebView. I've made a fix and now it should stop scrolling when touching the mask, which is enough for push and reveal animations.\nHowever, with overlay animation and when the splitter side is not scrollable, touchmove events somehow passes through the splitter-side and go to the splitter-content. Side and content are sibling elements so the event is not exactly bubbling, it just ignores the top element (the side). I think there's no easy fix for this :sweat: \nThis does not happen with the more recent WKWebView.. From v2.9.0, ons.forceUIWebViewScrollFix() should prevent this behavior with overlay animation but it might affect the momentum scroll. Another way to fix it:\ndocument.querySelector('ons-splitter-side').addEventListener('touchmove', function(e) { e.cancelable && e.preventDefault(); });\nThis should only be applied if the splitter is not scrollable!. Thanks!. @asial-matagawa I think the test coverage was also failing due to a Rollup issue.. @anatoo Is this supposed to be used outside ons-list? Can it be included inside as well?. I remembered about #1870 when making the animations, should be fine :sweat_smile: . I added ons.actionSheet({ buttons: [...], title: '...'}); method. I guess there's no problem with this either.. @misterjunio @asial-matagawa I think this is done. It includes all the bindings except Angular2. I uploaded examples in case you want to check.. @anatoo I think ons.createActionSheet could be confusing because we are using ons.createDialog, ons.createAlertDialog and ons.createPopover for something different. ons.openActionSheet could be fine but I guess simply ons.actionSheet is still understandable. Maybe we should go with something different like ons.requestAction or ons.notification.action?\n@asial-matagawa @misterjunio What do you think?. So the name has been decided: ons.openActionSheet :+1: \n. @anatoo Do you know why this happens on Firefox? This might be related: https://community.onsen.io/topic/1397/proxiway-a-geo-fencing-based-app-designed-using-onsenui/3. Use icon names from here: https://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/icons.html\nI think you're looking for md-collection-music.. @asial-matagawa Oh, probably there is an error in the docs comments. I saw this but actually forgot about it. Thanks for checking!. Oh, I see, good catch :)\n. @misterjunio Thanks!. @cyciopes Thanks for reporting, I just fixed it :). @asial-matagawa Yes, I think it is better to use the components as they are, without factories. Now, there is a problem in doing it in this way: If the dialog is included in a page that is a child of another page that contains a toolbar (for example, in the case of a Tabbar where the inner pages don't have a toolbar, but the parent has), the mask won't be displayed over this toolbar.\nThere are two ways to deal with that. One is obviously placing the dialog at a high level so it always shows on top of the toolbars, but it might be hard some times to pass down a reference to show/hide the dialog from a deep place (not sure about this, perhaps it's easy in Angular2).\nAnother way is to implement some kind of \"portal\" functionality and automatically move the dialogs to the body. In React there is something called ReactDOM.unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer that basically allows it. React bindings are using it.\nSame for Vue bindings. I just implemented a \"portal\" mixin that all the dialogs use.\nI'm not an expert but I guess Angular2 must have a way to deal with this as well.\nPinging @erisu here.. @asial-matagawa :+1: \nIs ons object and ons.notification available to use?. @asial-matagawa Yes, that makes sense :+1: :+1: . Updates:\n\nSometimes a timeout won't be necessary when buttons like \"Undo\" or \"Accept\" are provided, so I think it is easier to manually provide a timeout only when needed than overwriting an existing behavior. It is also hard to find a proper default timeout that works for most cases (4, 5 seconds?). Therefore, I'd prefer to have no timeout by default. Also, I think the timeout can be implemented only for ons.notification.toast method, not for the element's show.\nons.notification.toast implemented.\nRegarding @misterjunio 's input, I think notifications can come from the server at a \"random\" timing so perhaps we can provide this option in order to queue the notifications and follow the specs.\nLet's skip this then, but I'd like to write a blog post or something about how to create simple modifiers for ons-toast.\n\nIf there's no other feedback I'll proceed in this way :+1: \n. @asial-matagawa Good catch.\nAfter fixing that CSS issue I think this is done. I implemented components for React and Vue, not for Angular2 since I guess we are deprecating factories (#1976). However, onsNotification.toast(...) should still work in Angular2.. @asial-matagawa Only with literals? That's interesting... What if we do of [...array] :sweat_smile: . @asial-matagawa Yep, that's the same code, I guess we can merge this and release tomorrow :). @anatoo Looks good, thanks!. @puku0x Thanks for reporting and providing code! This bug was a hard one :sweat_smile:\nIt will be out in the next release. This also fixes another glitch for Android :+1: . @Hirbod I can believe it, it was hard to find a solution :sweat_smile: Enjoy the gin :party_parrot:. @misterjunio Perhaps we should implement some caching in the Navigator in order to detach the first children automatically when they are not needed. It can be done by attaching/detaching pages accordingly on prepop and postpush I think.. @misterjunio  If there are 7 pages for example, chances are that we don't need the first 4-5 pages since the normal action is popping 1 page. If resetToPage or anything like that is used, then it can reattach the pages.. @pmitoraj Onsen UI detects ons-fab and other elements that are included in the page's content and moves them to a fixed area. The problem here is that, since it is inside ons-if, it cannot find the ons-fab directly in the page's content and doesn't move it to the fixed area.\nYou can directly tell Onsen UI what is the page's content by providing a div.content:\n```html\n\n\nLists\n\n Scrollable content \n\n<ons-list>\n  <ons-lazy-repeat id=\"infinite-list\"></ons-lazy-repeat>\n</ons-list>\n\n\n Everything outside .content is fixed \n\n\n\n\n\n\n``. There is also [HammerTime](https://github.com/hammerjs/hammer-time), which \"\"polyfills\"\"touch-action`. However, it has to be added to the style attribute so I'm not sure if we can use it.. @anatoo Thanks! I think it's fine to do that, yes. iOS makes everything so complex :sweat_smile: \n@asial-matagawa I think WKWebView can be used in Cordova since iOS 9. It was bugged in iOS 8 if I don't remember wrong.... @asial-matagawa Thanks for all the information!\nI like option 2-a as well but I don't see what's the critical problem :thinking: . @misterjunio \u30aa\u30d6\u30ea\u30ac\u30c9\uff01. @asial-matagawa Thanks for the PR!\nA user suggested adding navigator.removePage if we remove options.refresh, what I think it could be fine. What do you think about that? It simply calls pageLoader.unload(pageElement) or pageElement._delete().. @asial-matagawa I mean that, if we deprecate options.refresh, perhaps we should provide removePage in the same release so it is easier for some users to update. I think it is a very easy to implement method. I don't mind if we postpone it but perhaps we should also postpone this PR then?. @asial-matagawa Thanks!. > +5 \u22124,392 \nFeels good :smile: \nI think it should be enough, thanks :+1: . @asial-matagawa Thanks!\nMaybe we can include some information in the readme or other file describing which polyfills are included and which ones could be necessary for other browsers?. @asial-matagawa Thanks a lot for the research! I think including setImmediate.js twice is not a big issue since it is a small polyfill (3KB minified). Does this finally enable tree shaking for the components? (Maybe only in React?). @asial-matagawa Actually, I think we were using init just due to some fix related to WebReflection's polyfill. Now that we changed to the other polyfill maybe we can use constructor. Do you think it is possible?. @asial-matagawa Oh, I think we should only create a new animator if the animation type changed. I want to make a small refactor of that animator when I get some free time anyway. I'll try to have a look at it soon.. I don't mind having checkbox, radio and text together in ons-input like until now (they have the same DOM). We could make ons-search-input in a different component.\nOtherwise, if you really want to split them, I'd say ons-checkbox, ons-radio, ons-input and ons-search/ons-search-input.\n. @asial-matagawa Yes, I think providing the transpiled code would be better :+1: . @asial-matagawa pageElement's real scrollTop will always be 0, so I don't think it's very interesting. In the past, for example, we were mapping pageElement's style attribute to .page__background for the same reason. Do you think it is acceptable or still prefer pageElement.content?. @asial-matagawa I will merge this now. In any case, this is just for internal use so we can change it later.. @t2thec I think you are looking for .page__content selector. In any case, after this was released you can do it directly in the page element (not documented): pageElement.scrollTop. Hope it helps!. @tehg00se First of all, please try to update to a recent version of onsenui and vue-onsenui. Methods API is deprecated since alpha.1.\nI the new API a modal can be shown with :visible=\"modalVisible\". This simply sets display: table or display: none to the modal. If you want to use a Vue transition, I think you can use something like :visible=\"true\" v-show=\"modalVisible\" and toggle modalVisible boolean variable.. @Leva7 Thanks for reporting. This is actually a problem in the docs. The timeout only works for ons.notification.toast. For a custom component you can use setTimeout normally:\nmyToast.show().then(function() {\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    myToast.hide();\n  }, 1000);\n});. @asial-matagawa I found that issue, it's something different. This is related to a visibility = 'hidden' after the menu is closed. That is necessary because if there are 2 menus with reveal animation, both of them could be visible under some circumstances when swiping one side...\nI'll find a different workaround for that :sweat_smile: . @asial-matagawa I've removed visibility property and the glitch should be gone now. Instead, I'm changing the z-index property of the splitterSides, so the visible one will be displayed over the hidden one. In order to do that I had to adjust all the splitter z-index (content, mask, etc).\nI cannot see glitches on Firefox or Chrome 58 anymore :)\n. @asial-matagawa Thanks!. @cyciopes Yes, it does. It tries to pre-calculate the height of the items by loading the first item and unloading it at the beginning. If you provide calculateItemHeight function it won't do this. This function should return an approximate value of the items height, it doesn't need to be 100% accurate.\nApart from that, I think initializing the lazy repeat to 0 items is quite uncommon. Can't you wait to initialize it  until you have something to display?\nAlso, instead of ons.ready, which only happens once in the app, you might prefer using page's init event.\nFeel free to open this again if you have anything else to add :). Ah! So that was it! I know officially the said v59, but I was surprised it was working on my machine with v58. Thanks for checking!. @asial-matagawa @misterjunio Can any of you test all of this on Safari and update Angular2 bindings? I will implement soon the other bindings.. @misterjunio @asial-matagawa I think React + Vue + Angular1 bindings are also finished :)\n. I noticed that we had some DOM elements in ons-input related to something deprecated. I've simplified the DOM elements and the code in general in 6da261e . It shouldn't break anything but it's better if we can test it.\n. @anatoo I've simplified ons-switch in c167bf5 , but it has some minor differences. The checked attribute is not updated to the inner input, for example. I don't think this was necessary but we can still undo the commit if you think it was important. Native inputs do not react on checked attribute changes so I didn't see the point. Now ons-switch should behave like ons-checkbox and be easier to maintain... hopefully :sweat_smile: . @asial-matagawa This is not related to Vue, right? I think it's also wrong in the core.. @humblecoder It's not possible to resolve to 2 different values, we have to choose one.\nHowever, I'm thinking about a work around. The OK button must always be the last one in the buttonLabels array, so we can resolve to the input value only if that button index was pressed. Otherwise, null (it's canceled). This wouldn't modify the API and would allow having \"Cancel\" and \"OK\" buttons. @asial-matagawa @misterjunio What do you think about that? 601b00726ff47f7d7fb2c94ed8355ad18c88c315. I'd personally prefer to return 1 single value to be consistent with the other notifications rather than returning objects or arrays :/\nWe can also leave it as is only with \"OK\" button since it is already possible to create custom ons-alert-dialogs.. @misterjunio Actually, there is a primaryButtonIndex property, we can use that as well.. @misterjunio We cannot resolve to -1 in a prompt when canceled because the user can also write -1 :/\nThe primary button is the OK button. I guess other buttons won't need to resolve to the input content.. @asial-matagawa @misterjunio Actually, I just thought about something:\n```\n\n\n    Content\n<script>\n   var page = document.getElementById('p1'); // or myNavigator.topPage;\n   page.initHook = function() {\n       // init page!\n   };\n   page.showHook = ...\n</script>\n\n\n\n```\nThen we can run initHook at the same time as the init event is fired. What do you think about it?. @misterjunio Yes yes, I just added \"hook\" to make it explicit. I'll open a specs issue and we can decide there. Thanks for testing!. This is finished according to #2056 specs. Changes on this should be easy to make.. @misterjunio Thanks for testing!. @asial-matagawa We always limited the number of nodes in a template to 1 (only 1 ons-page), that's why I wrote the script tag inside ons-page, which works well. If we want to change this, it will also affect the old ons-template and could create issues.\nIf we keep the limitation of having only 1 element in templates, ons-page can deal with script tags easily: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/2053/commits/91f792263a6fb46061d3e65b309312270455cfaf#diff-52c49156be6687c4b5dfefe178df4972R157\nIt can be removed during the constructor and attached later on. This was the first approach I tried but then I thought that using hooks would be better since we continue using the same concept (init, show, hide...). Also, it's probably safer since we make sure timing issues won't occur in any platform.\n@anatoo @misterjunio @asial-matagawa What do you prefer, hooks or implementing some code to delay the script tags?. @asial-matagawa I see what you mean now. I agree this is quite good from the user perspective, but the real difference is just 1 line (the wrapper). For this, we need to do some \"magic\" like modifying the script content and stuff, which means the feature depends more on Onsen UI core than on the browser. Also, I think it's a bit troublesome to get the current page because we cannot rely on an ID. We should perhaps add a hash attribute to the page or something like that.\nFollowing that idea, maybe we can just inject a closure, bind \"this\" to the page and delay the script like in the commit I posted before. It would be nice to use: <script>this.querySelector('ons-toolbar .center').innerHTML = 'Title';</script>\nHowever, I think I'd prefer to explicitly declare the hooks and avoid more magic (the hooks already bind \"this\" to the page). Also, in most of the cases, they can just use myNavigator.topPage to get the page: <script>myNavigator.topPage.onInit = function() { this.querySelector(...).innerHTML = 'Title'; }</script>\nIt's a tradeoff, let's discuss it @anatoo @misterjunio @asial-matagawa \n. Thanks!\nTherefore, this is all already implemented in #2053 :+1: . @misterjunio Can you quickly test this on Android 5.5 or so when you have some time? Here I only have 5.1.1 :sweat_smile: . @misterjunio I guess it would need some kind of _isRunning like the navigator animations, but it's very unlikely that this happens in a real app anyway. Thanks for testing!. @Leva7 Toasts are more versatile and can be displayed in different positions. However, I think Action Sheet (iOS) and Bottom Sheet (Android) always look the same. Thus, the provided animations are only that. Perhaps it's better to improve the animation performance instead of creating extra animations. Could you please report the device where it has low framerate?\nAlso, creating a custom animation is very simple, there is a guide here.. Fixed in master branch :+1: . @misterjunio Thanks!. @Wieltje Hi! Great to see somone using KO :)\nWow, that's super weird. Can you try with the latest 2.4.0 version of Onsen UI? It was released an hour ago and it changed a bit something related to separate files. Not sure if it will fix it but let's try that first. I could not reproduce this issue in vanilla JS but I'd be surprised if it's something KO-specific.... @renanbandeira Hi! I'm not sure what's the issue that we need to fix here. Modals work in this way, they use a \"portal\" feature to be rendered on top of everything else. I think this is something that Enzyme should take care of:\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/536\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/252. @renanbandeira Sure, no problem, just that we cannot fix this since it's related to how Enzyme works :sweat_smile: \nAlso, looks like the will support this behavior after React Fiber is out.. @rgins16 Thanks for reporting! It also happens to ons-input. The DOM changed a bit in 2.4.0 and looks like a specific CSS property is not applied.\nFor now you can do something like this:\nons-input > input, ons-search-input > input {\n  width: 100%;\n}\nI think that should fix it.. @ericbehughes You were using alpha.0 there? We already have rc.0 and it is working. Check it here: http://tutorial.onsen.io/?framework=vue&category=reference&module=range. @misterjunio I thought the autostyling should remove transparent but it actually doesn't. https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/core/src/ons/autostyle.js#L24\nPerhaps it should remove it, I don't know how is a transparent input in MD...\nAlso, now that I think about it, transparent modifier doesn't make sense right now because it's the default style on iOS.... @misterjunio I removed transparent. Originally, the default input was different and the transparent modifier made sense, but not anymore.. @porchdog Thanks for the PR! We'll check it soon :+1: . @anatoo What do you think about this animation? I've fixed the style issues in another branch.. @porchdog Thanks, this will be merged in #2097. @rgins16 Do you have any custom styles changing opacity and visibility applied to the pages? There is a change in 2.4.0 where the pages in tabbar use visibility: hidden instead of display: none, but that shouldn't break anything.. @rgins16 Thanks for the input, I found a similar issue occurring with ons-switch because it applies some transition animations. I'll try to revert the visibility: hidden commit and release 2.4.2.. @rgins16 This should be fixed in 2.4.2, already released :+1: . @luatnd For now, I guess the only way is to grab the DOM element and access the pullDistance property. Perhaps we should implement a hook onPull that runs whenever the pull hook is dragged...\nAlso, you can have icons and other stuff there, not only text. Check for example the pull hook of this app (it's in Vue).\n@asial-matagawa What do you think about that?\n. @ceskomira90 You are supplying page attribute to set an initial page, and at the same time you are including an inner page inside the navigator. Choose one of the two, not both. If you want to do replace it afterwards, you'll want to use page attribute and <template>.. @ceskomira90 Yes, like it's shown in the tutorial. Since 2.4.0 you can use <template>, which is native to the browser, instead of <ons-template>.. @ceskomira90 Well, if you don't put the tabbar inside login.html template, then naturally it won't appear when you create an instance of login.html template.\nI don't really understand the pattern you want to make. Do you always want to have a visible tabbar in your app? Or only when the login page is shown? I'd recommend you reading Onsen UI guide and checking examples. ToDo app tutorial might help.. @ceskomira90 In your first example, ons-tabbar and ons-navigator are siblings and that's not possible or, at least, we haven't made any example/test like that. They must have a parent-child relation like in your \"workaround\" (that's the right way of structuring the components).\nBy the way, <template> elements are meant to be in index.html. It might work like you did but we haven't tested it in that way :P. @italomaia It's here: https://github.com/monaca-templates/onsenui-v2-vue-tabbar/blob/master/src/App.vue#L11\nLooks like we forgot to update that template. As @misterjunio says it's enough with :index.sync=\"activeIndex\" and completely removing @update. That's why we changed all the events from update to update:propName, to support the new sync modifier.. It's been already fixed :)\n. Not sure why this was open until now. It needs some reproduction, code or something at least.. @Wieltje Hi! I've looked at how Knockout.js implements the checked binding and looks like they are using click event instead of change, I'm not sure why they do that. There is no click event when ons-switch is dragged and thus the model is not updated. I think this is something that should be fixed in KO, not in ons-switch.\nAs a workaround, try to use the event binding instead (data-bind=\"event: { change: updateSwitch }\") and manually apply the new value to the switch. Hope this helps!. @asial-matagawa @anatoo This animation shows the scrollbar. I think the only way to avoid it is to apply overflow: hidden to <body> or change the DOM structure of ons-modal. I guess the first solution is simpler, do you have any objection?. @anatoo Thanks! I couldn't see any issue in the examples we have so I'll merge this.. @rgins16 Thanks for reporting!\n@anatoo This CSS is causing the issue:\n.list-item--longdivider.list-item--chevron:before {\n    border: none;\n    background-image: none;\n}\nI guess that's wrong or is there any reason to have that?. @anatoo No problem, thanks! :smile: . @italomaia Yep, I'm actually using it for the main version of the kitchensink app. What do you exactly mean with adding Vuex to default vuex template? What's the default vuex template? Do you mean Monaca CLI templates or vue-cordova-webpack for Vue CLI?. @italomaia I will add Vuex option when I have some time since it makes sense to be used with Onsen UI for UI state management. Otherwise, feel free to make a PR to the other repo :). @italomaia I added Vuex option to vue-cordova-webpack template in https://github.com/OnsenUI/vue-cordova-webpack/commit/02b11f39ddffb03dea1c1164578209d476250e0c :+1: \nI'll add it now to vue-pwa-webpack.. More info about swiping bugs in #2107.. @asial-matagawa Thanks, I'll do the same for React then.. Bugs like the one reported in #604 should now be fixed for all the components.. I'm merging this into the other PR to continue with the bindings.. @CrankedCode Hi, thanks for reporting! The ons-icon inside ons-tab was adding fa- prefix automatically to your class. This will be fixed in v2.5.0 :+1: . @CrankedCode Sorry, I was wrong, this won't be fixed in 2.5.0. We will just remove those docs.. @anatoo Looks great, thanks! Just one thing, the ripple stays visible until you click outside it. Perhaps we should use :active instead of :focus?. @anatoo I see. It feels weird for me to have it activated all the time after pressing it :confused: \nI think many users will ask for a way to deactivate ripple effect on checkboxes and radios.... @raphox Thanks! The isWebView() method is also exposed in $ons.platform.isWebView(), but I guess this change is fine. The docs for $ons are currently showing the original ons object, we need to filter those methods :sweat_smile: \nI think the rest of the methods are not very important since they are used to deal with DOM elements.. @raphox forcePlatformStyling is just for changing the platform in demos. You can use $ons.platform.select('android') instead.. @anatoo Good job! The only difference I can notice is that in MD, it doesn't have any effect when the back-button is pressed anymore. I think it's not very important, though :+1: . @anatoo Looks good, thanks!. @Lenndev I don't think we can fix this from Onsen UI side. It is likely an issue in your build system. You'll need to configure gulp-css-importer and all the rest to find the paths correctly. A template for Vue CLI with Webpack is provided here (run vue init OnsenUI/vue-cordova-webpack).. @anatoo To be honest I'm not sure what's the expected behavior on iOS, I just know how Chrome behaves :sweat_smile:\nIf native ranges only update on drag then there is nothing to fix on iOS. I guess the Android issue is a real bug but perhaps is not that important either.. @misterjunio Thanks for sharing! A few thoughts:\n\nPerhaps only one of <button> or class=\"button\" should be necessary. I think ons-toast accepts any of them.\nI'd prefer tabbar-id rather than tabbar attribute to make it more specific.\nIn the tabbar we have an active-index attribute. Perhaps we should use the same name for the segment instead of active-button. It is also more specific since it expects an actual index.\nchange is a native event for inputs so I think we should avoid using it. Tabbar and carousel fire postchange instead, perhaps we could use that. . @anatoo @asial-matagawa Anything to add?. @frosdqy Hi! This doesn't look like a bug, explanation here: You cannot have the same ID twice in the DOM because you'll only get the first match with document.querySelector('#page2'). Basically, you are setting onInit and onShow always on the same page (the first one). Try to use a class selector and get the last one. Or, alternatively if you are always using ons-navigator, document.querySelector('#myNavigator').topPage.onInit..... @Songkeys Thanks for reporting! It's actually not a problem in React, but in the ons-range custom element. The focus doesn't consider min and max attributes. @anatoo Can you have a look at it? I guess the second input needs to get those attributes as well.. @airamrguez Hi! Thanks for the PR. I was checking the Navigator in React and thought that there's no need to change anything (apart from swipeable propType, which I forgot) since it has a postpop event handler with some logic. Is the page stack inconsistent or anything after swiping?. @airamrguez I've checked this again before releasing v1.5.1 but I saw again that swipePop is not strictly necessary for a basic usage. What kind of issue does your wrapper fix and how would swipePop  prop help you better than onPrePop event (prepop)?\nI'll wait for this information before merging and releasing the current changes.\n. @airamrguez Thanks a lot for taking time to write this. I might be wrong but I think all of that can be achieved also with the core events (props in React). For example, onPrePop prop gets an event that contains routes: { poppingRoute: {}, routes: [...] }. Same for onPostPop but it contains poppedRoute instead of poppingRoute. And I guess event.routes.routes.length can be used for the navigation depth?\n\nAs for the Navigator is already running animation. error, I think it shouldn't happen anymore in recent versions since there is a transparent mask during animations which takes extra clicks (so it shouldn't be possible to click on back buttons). It might perhaps happen with the device back button, but it should be possible to catch errors with this.popPage().catch(...) anyway since it returns a promise.\nI guess we can still add swipePop if you think it's necessary for this use case. It should be completely optional, though. . @pashute Thanks! It should be updated in a while :)\n. @pashute Hi! Please post these questions in the Monaca Tools section of the forum, it will be answered there :+1: \nI think the Cloud IDE does not support Webpack right now. The support probably refers to Monaca CLI and LocalKit.. The error is just a small change in the latest version, just use swipeable instead of isSwipeable. Everything else is working (after adding a click handler to the toolbar button): https://codesandbox.io/s/x20wnr01mp. @rolbr Thanks for making this demo! I've found an issue in the code. Your evil-tabbar is truly evil because it includes ons-tab custom elemnet instead of v-ons-tab Vue component :P\nDue to this, page attribute is loading <ons-page> custom element instead of <v-ons-page> Vue component. A quick fix is as follows:\nVue.component('evil-tabbar', {\n  template: `\n  <v-ons-tabbar position=\"auto\">\n    <template slot=\"pages\">\n      <home-page></home-page>\n      <settings-page></settings-page>\n    </template>\n    <v-ons-tab icon=\"ion-home\" active></v-ons-tab>\n    <v-ons-tab icon=\"ion-ios-settings\"></v-ons-tab>\n  </v-ons-tabbar>\n  `,\n  components: {homePage, settingsPage}\n});\nCodepen here. There is also another syntax for v-ons-tabbar using :tabs prop instead of slot=\"pages\", see this tut.\nOnce it is fixed, I cannot see the Carousel issue anymore. If you remove overscrollable attribute and are at index 0, the drag event will be used by the Splitter since the Carousel cannot consume it.. @rolbr I just tried that Codepen with :tabs prop and still works well, so I guess we can close this issue for now. Feel free to open it again (or a new one) if you can reproduce what happens in your local environment :+1: . @atgfr82 Hi! _checkItemHeight is only called if calculateItemHeight is not provided in the delegate object. Therefore, you can simply provide that function and it should work well. _checkItemHeight is just rendering the first item and measuring its height, so you can directly provide the height manually in the mentioned calculateItemHeight function (by default is 44px for iOS and 48px for Android).\nMoreover, if you update Onsen UI version to 2.2.0+ (recommended 2.5.1+), that function will only be used to get an intuitive height. The real item height can be dynamic (different for every item).\nI'll change it toitem.element && item.element.remove() or something similar but in any case, this won't be released right now.\nClosing this but feel free to open it again if you have anything to add.. @misterjunio Doesn't sound very good but I think it's easy to understand and nobody will use it in a different context...\nI always forget including new methods in the d.ts :sweat: . @asial-matagawa Thanks for the input. document.currentScript is actually supported in all the browsers officially supported by Onsen UI. I just added the fallback for those who risk and try to use Android 4 without crosswalk, so I think we shouldn't worry too much about it.\nThis is why I prefer to call it ons.getScriptPage(), because it is obvious that it should only be used for the script tags. Therefore, returning null seems enough when there is no page. What do you think?\n. @asial-matagawa \n\ndocument.scripts[document.scripts.length - 1] does not return null\n\nYes, but /ons-page/i.test(getCS().parentElement.tagName) will likely fail so the final result will still be null. I'll try to document this enough in the guide as well so nobody uses it outside script tags anyway.. @misterjunio @airamrguez Thanks!. @baixiaoyu2997 Have a look at Vue guide. In a template, auto-scroll-ratio is the correct syntax.. @marcusvbp Hi, thanks for sharing! The v-ons-select component simply relies on ons-select custom element and it must be like that. Therefore, if we implement or improve something like this, it must be done in a custom element, not in a Vue component.\nThat said, this element is actually a simple select that displays a native drop-down in iOS and Android. It might look too simple in desktop Chrome, for example, but looks fine on devices. Therefore, I think for now we'll stick to the current ons-select style, but thanks a lot for making this and sharing it.\nWe'll make a list of resources made by the community and we can probably add your gist :+1: \n. @ableabhijeet Hi! I'm confused. You are reporting a bug using Vue and Onsen UI but you are not including Vue bindings (vue-onsenui package). On top of that, you have errors in the code such as using incorrect ids for your elements. Here is your code fixed. If you are new to Vue or Onsen UI, have a look at the guide.. @ableabhijeet You expect your component to render two tabs and indeed your component is rendering two tabs :sweat_smile: Check the link I gave you in my last comment.. @ableabhijeet Then the issue is in the other component or in the way you include one inside another, not in this code :sweat_smile: . @ableabhijeet Sure, take a look at the kitchensink app. The tabbar is not the \"top\" component so I guess it works as an example.\nThis new approach that you took is a bit wrong, a page cannot be inside a tab. The tab is just a button. Have a look at the tabbar tutorial and check the last page of the explanation, there is an alternative syntax kind of similar to what you tried here.. @ableabhijeet That's made with a plain scroll event listener in JavaScript. In Onsen UI, the scrollable elements are the page content elements. You can provide your own content element as explained in the docs. After that, you can add a listener with <div class=\"content\" @scroll=\"doSomething()\">.. @ericbehughes Well, we actually consider noshadow modifier to be a fix for the ugly shadow between toolbar and tab bar. There is no parameter to remove this \"fix\" so the only solution is to manually remove the modifier:\nhtml\n<v-ons-toolbar ref=\"toolbar\">\njavascript\n  mounted() {\n    const modifier = this.$refs.toolbar.$el.getAttribute('modifier');\n    this.$refs.toolbar.$el.setAttribute('modifier', modifier.replace('noshadow', ''));\n  }\nI'd like to implement a new syntax for modifier prop similar to Vue classes: :modifier=\"{noshadow: false, ...}\", but that will take some time.. @barckq Thanks for reporting. I've spent quite a lot of time debugging this on the last development version but couldn't find any flickering. I tried iOS 10.3.2 and UIWebView as well :/\nWe enforce that \"useless\" page there just to normalize the structure and ensure that we can call internal APIs implemented in ons-page that might not be implemented in ons-navigator. You can of course remove it in your custom version if it works for you.\nIf you want to try out the latest development version, you can download it here. Make sure you also copy the CSS, not only the JS.. @Rudloff Hi! Have a look at Browser and device support section in the guide. Android 4.2 is not supported without Crosswalk or, at least, a bunch of polyfills.. @mr-unicoder In short, there is no RTL support as for now. We might implement it after some other features that have priority but it's not sure yet.. @anatoo Thanks, looks great!\nAre you going to implement a tool for changing colors from the previewer and then downloading it? Or that is not planned?. @ulf1 I think that syntax is actually not equivalent to the one used in the example:\n\n<script src=\"react-onsenui.js\"></script>, then use window.Ons\nvar Ons = require('react-onsenui.js');\nimport * as Ons from 'react-onsenui.js\n\nI think any of those 3 should work.. @zeroliu Thanks for reporting! This is an issue in Onsen UI core.\n@anatoo This was introduced in onsenui@2.4.0, css-components: Refined the appearance of list-item--chevron.. Can I ask you to have a look at it?. @baixiaoyu2997 \nloadMore(done) {\n            let that = this;\n            if (that.start == \"-1\") return;\n            this.loadList(undefined, done);\n        },\nYou also need to call done() when that.start == \"-1\" (right now it's just returning).\n. @anatoo Thanks!. @mr-unicoder For questions, please use the forum or Stack Overflow.. @guywald1 Are you using setState to change the value? Otherwise, I think React won't update the component. I just tried with the latest version and looks like it works well. Please provide a small example reproducing this (you can start from here).. @asial-matagawa Did you test that this is fixed? The bug I fixed was actually different and I'm not completely sure it works for this.. @vunnysher You can hit the Improve this button at the top of the page and fix it if you want :). @vunnysher No problem, thanks!. @TiagoDanin No, no plan for now. We'll consider it if the market share changes. Right now Windows 10 Mobile usage is pretty low, less than 1% or so :/. @winshitoo So what's the issue? :confused: . @keijiodagawa Thanks for reporting, it's been fixed in 6e9d6d0\n. @ableabhijeet Hi, thanks for reporting! How are you triggering the first destroy? I'm running this.$destroy() on Home page and looks like all the tabs are correctly destroyed even when using keep-alive for the tabs. Could you provide a small example in tutorial.onsen.io , codepen, fiddle or a GitHub repo?. @ableabhijeet Glad to read that. We can close this I guess :). @gogodigimo Thanks for reporting. Does this code work for you? It works at least in desktop browsers.. Yep, reference here. \ud83d\udc4d . @aspick Thanks for reporting! I noticed this in Vue and made a fix yesterday. It's in a PR already and will be released next week. I'll make sure it also works in React.\nFor now you can add material--flat modifier when ons.platform.isAndroid() is true.. @jimmy-frank I'm not sure I understand what you mean, please elaborate a bit more. Also, please try to use the latest version of Onsen UI, 2.0.0 is quite old already.. @baixiaoyu2997 That would only work if you provide <div class=\"page__content\">...</div> yourself. Otherwise, when Vue creates the random attributes to simulate scoped CSS, it won't find any .page__content. So no, it's not a bug :sweat_smile: \nFull version would be:\n```\n\n...\n\n    Content here\n  \n\n```\nYou can also use div class=\"content\"  and style .content instead of .page__content.. @emj365 Tips? About what?yarn add babel-eslint -Dwas enough to fix this.. @emj365 No no, it's already fixed. Check the message from Github on top of these comments:frandiox closed this in 026d125 19 minutes ago. Commit here: 026d125. @asial-matagawa Sincereact-onsenuihaseslintas dev depency it should also havebabel-eslintand don't rely on the parent directories :+1: . @emj365 Thanks! They are already rendered incomponentDidMountand pushPage-like methods, it's true :). @airamrguez Oh, I didn't know about that PR. I guess we should revert this change :/\nI'm too used to Vue.js where there is no need to take care of issues like this :sweat_smile: . @italomaia I don't see any issue there. The pattern is passed to the innerelement and it works. You can select it withinput:validorinput:invalid.. @italomaia You simply need to load a template in the dropdown first :+1: . @Hirbod Are you perhaps using an old CSS version? I believe that rule was removed. Thecover-contentshould just addpadding-topinstead.. @Hirbod I guess you have a customonsen-css-components.css. Try updating onlyonsenui.cssfile, this changes should be there.. @Hirbod Is that background image in.page__content? It should be in.page__backgroundinstead. The latter doesn't have any padding.. @Hirbod I just tried that and it works well :confused: \nCan you check which rule is setting that padding? In the latest version only.page__contentshould havepadding-top: 44px.... @Hirbod Hmmm... This looks alright I think https://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/yomWpx?editors=1010. @Hirbod Oh I see, thanks for the clarification. About the padding, I think normally we don't want the content to be under the toolbar in the initial state, only when we scroll down. Also, for a user it's probably easier to addpadding-top: 0than adding different values for iOS and Android to change this behavior, so let's keep it like that for now :+1: . @recoilnetworks Where is theexamplesfolder in that repo? I think it is not provided in the releases. The examples are in the main repo and they work well when runninggulp serve`.\nIn any case, those examples are used for some quick testing. You can find better examples at https://tutorial.onsen.io. @recoilnetworks Oh, I've found the link you said. Looks like it has a weird behavior, it links to a place but downloads something wrong. Please go to this link https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI-dist/releases/latest  and hit Source code (zip) at the end. That will download the real Onsen UI release. It does not contains examples so you can check the interactive tutorial I mentioned before instead.. @recoilnetworks If you want to run the examples in the main repo, you can check the dev guide here: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup\nHope it helps!. @GinjiBan Thanks for taking the time in debugging and reporting. As described in the readme and docs, we don't officially support IE nor test it. Also, I just changed ons-tabbar completely and doesn't even have animators anymore. The new version will be released probably tomorrow so I think there is no point in trying to fix this now :/. @benny-medflyt Hi! The example that you see in both components is the same and correspond to Navigator component. The other one, RouterNavigator, does the same thing but with a different API. You can see an example here. This one is stateless and can be used with Redux for example.. @LucNaterop I answered you on Gitter and SO. You just need to wrap the navigator inside a page and it will work.\nBy the way, when you report an issue from tutorial.onsen.io you don't need to manually modify the \"Demo link\", it will work once you submit the issue :). @rynomad Thanks! Did this happen in your app?. @jimmy-frank Thanks for reporting! For now, you can use ons-template instead of template in that specific page (move it to index.html and use ons-template if you have it now in a separate file). This will be fixed in the next minor version :+1: . This was fixed two days ago in d297dbf :+1: . @Hirbod Thanks, we'll take a look at this soon :+1: . @anatoo Good job! Can we merge this right before releasing 2.7.0? Otherwise, we might need to revert the changes again for releasing minor versions.. Fixed in 89ae527. @rgins16 It was a syntax error in the css. Explained in #2200\nIt will be out in the next release :+1: . @Hirbod Hi! That implies that the pull hook would enter action state without preaction first, right? Not a huge deal but perhaps there's another way to do what you want. Have you tried the onPull property? I think you can do the same and perhaps even more with it.. @Hirbod It's a DOM property, document.querySelector('ons-pull-hook').onPull = function() {};. There is an example (with Vue) here.\nI'm not 100% sure if you can use it for your specific usecase though. I'll consider with the team about removing the th >= this.height, although this is not a normal ons-pull-hook use case I guess.. @Hirbod Merged in master!\n@PeaFull No events at the very beginning, only onPull will be called. In 2.8.3 you can access onPull like $scope.myPullHook.onPull (and seeting <ons-pull-hook var=\"myPullHook\">, of course). Keep in mind that directives in AngularJS are linked to their scope in a specific order parent > child, so the parent controller might run before $scope.myPullHook is set. You can wait for page's init event to ensure the $scope is populated.. Thanks for reporting! I think the fix will be release today.. @sbaechler Hi! Please try to reproduce the issue as specified in the issue template. You can start from here: http://tutorial.onsen.io/?framework=react&category=reference&module=splitter\nI just tried quickly removing collapse and it looks like working well :/. @mr-unicoder For now you can use the following code instead of plain <ons-input>:\n<ons-input>\n  <input type=\"text\" class=\"text-input\">\n  <span class=\"text-input__label\"></span>\n</ons-input>\nAnd then add the ngModel and ngModelOptions to the native input.. No idea about this, perhaps you can try asking on the forum or, maybe better, on Stackoverflow.\nGitHub issues are specifically for bugs on Onsen UI, and this doesn't look like it :confused: . @bringmethecode We certainly should update it. However, this is a breaking change for most apps using md icons because all the class names would be changed. For example, md-edit should be renamed to md-pencil and so on. I guess it's not something we can do for a minor version :/\nSame for SVG, we cannot do it without huge breaking changes :sweat_smile: . @bringmethecode In v2.8.0 you can remove default icon fonts by including onsenui-core.css instead of onsenui.core. Therefore, you can use your own icon packs and we don't make any breaking change :)\nMore info.. @LukasDrgon Thanks, I added a new CDN section to the readme.\n. @pashute Just update onsenui and vue-onsenui dependencies :+1: . @baixiaoyu2997 As suggested in the issue template, can you please make a small example reproducing this problem?. @baixiaoyu2997 I just tried removing <custom-toolbar> in the kitchensink app and couldn't see any error.\nAlso, you said \n\ni have <v-ons-toolbar> in my page,but still show me the \"toolbar._getToolbarLeftItemsElement is not a function\",\n\nBut I can't see any toolbar in your code. Is it inside <index-header>? It must be the root component if that's the case (<template><v-ons-toolbar>...</v-ons-toolbar></template>).. @baixiaoyu2997 I'm a bit confused, I can't see that error but I see others related to vuex and vue-router. They are not included in the app source so I cannot debug it further :/. No, a v-ons-toolbar shouldn't be necessary. I've checked once again and I'm still unable to get that error. I know it only happens with iOS slide animation since that's the only place where these functions are used but still, I'm not able to see the error. That toolbar variable becomes a dummy toolbar element when your page doesn't contain an actual toolbar, so all the functions should exist...\n. @baixiaoyu2997 Can you try with the latest development version (onsenui.js)? I made a small change that might fix the issue.. :frowning: \nI guess using incognito mode without plugins is actually good for developing :sweat_smile: . @andrey-tsaplin Thanks a lot for the explanation! That makes sense indeed. It's weird that an extension is overriding document.createElement, that can obviously create unexpected behavior hard to debug.... @Rudloff Looks like this only happens on Firefox when the template is located in a separate file :confused: . @Ralpharoo Thanks for reporting it with so much information, it was easy to debug thanks to that :) Looks like 898536e is enough.\nThis indeed looks like a bug on iOS, I saw something similar in #1949. @Ralpharoo Same as in the splitter side, then. The only solution I can think right now is making the modal scrollable somehow (maybe by 1 pixel, or have another transparent scrollable element behind), so it takes the scroll and does not pass it magically to another random element. However, I'm quite busy right now with other stuff so this might take some time.\nPRs are also welcome, of course :+1: . @Ralpharoo I've checked this for a while and I think there is no definite fix. After the last patch, it should be fine in iOS Safari and WKWebView. In UIWebView, however, it only prevents scrolling on dialog masks. I had to remove the fix for ons-modal because it would prevent scrolling modals that should have a scrollable content as well.\nThere is a new ons.forceUIWebViewScrollFix() that applies the same patches for WKWebView to UIWebView but you will need to check if this works for your app. It could stop momentum scroll if a dialog is displayed before the scroll finished.\nAlso, now Onsen UI adds .ons-ios-scroll class to document.body whenever a dialog or splitter are open so you can apply custom CSS fixes if necessary. :+1: \n. @rancor1223 This is not really tested in ons-tabbar but I just fixed the issue I saw when doing this anyway. However, beware that ons-tabbar DOM structure changed in 2.6.0. If you are going to attach new tabs asynchronously, make sure you grab the real .tabbar element (var tabbar = document.querySelector('ons-tabbar .tabbar') and append the tabs before the last element (which is the material design border): tabbar.insertBefore(tab, tabbar.lastElementChild);.. @otak1222 Hi! This is not a bug. Carousel's event is bubbling so the Tabbar's handler is also called. Maybe you can try something like this:\nfunction(event) {\n  if (event.target === event.currentTarget) {\n    // run code\n  }\n}\nThat ensures the event target is the same element that has the listener :+1: . @anatoo What do you think?. @Ralpharoo Oh, we changed to CircleCI v2 recently, I guess the link must be changed...\nAs a workaround, check this and take the first url.. 479a5587840d3e748c7b84abb9ef39c5636260cf. @KrewKracer Lazy repeat wasn't really made for filtering lists and allowing empty lists but I guess we can easily fix that. Thanks for the report, I'll check it soon.. @pashute This is the only source code repository of Onsen UI so I think there is no need to change anything in the readme. Check changelog, released versions or Git tags to see any specific Onsen UI version.. @pashute I just answered your question on Stack Overflow. For the next time, please post this kind of thing in our forum instead. GitHub should only have real issues.. @pashute I don't think so. We cannot explain how to use plain CSS, HTML and JavaScript for every single situation. What I just did was checking the DOM and changing CSS rules. The docs show how to make a custom theme easily if you don't want to do this manually.\nApart from this, it would be nice if you can mark the SOF question as answered.. @uk-taniyama Looks like it breaks when the libs are included after all the content (Codepen puts them at the end). If you place them in <head> or at the beginning of <body> it works also in Firefox.. @hugofelp Hi! Thanks a lot for the issue report and PR. I'll try to have a look at this next week when I have some time!. @hugofelp Thanks for the fix! I can't see any problem with this change :). @treecon The appearance of the switch depends on its actual value, so it is not possible to modify its appearance before the value is updated -- unless we add a bunch of JavaScript to do something that CSS does in 1 line (input:checked CSS selector).\nAlso, I think there is no change event at all while you are dragging, only when releasing on the opposite side. If we delay the event then it would not be synchronous with the actual value and things like double clicking on the switch would become weird. Is there any specific scenario where you need this?. @asial-matagawa As suspected, this was an issue in Chrome iframes. It should be fixed in 2.9.2 (a95d7e2) :+1: . @baixiaoyu2997 Hi! I think it's easier if you just toggle the content with v-show. Have a look at this first.\nThen, you can probably do:\n```html\n\n\n\n\n    Placeholder\n  \n\n```\n. @Henry0126 Any chance that you can reproduce this issue here and hit Report an issue? Otherwise, it's going to be hard to reproduce... That is using the latest version (2.7.2 at the moment).. @anuragnagarkota ons-navigator is completely independent of URLs, therefore there is nothing that connects it with browser history. You can read the URL at the beginning of the app and set the current stack with resetToPage and insertPage methods. Unfortunately, there is no declarative way to do this.. Added in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/2315 :+1: (onsenui@2.9.0). @otak1222 Thanks for reporting. For now you can run $scope.myTabbar._element[0]._onRefresh() to fix the issue after showing the tabbar :+1: . @Ralpharoo Definitely! We'll have a look at it. Lately, Fastclick is giving us some issues. Related #2000 . @asial-matagawa You are more familiar with that PR, can you please have a look at it?. @airamrguez That's unfortunate :/ Under what conditions do you see the flickering? The original issue was with a tabbar inside a small dialog.... @zabojad This is just due to the peer dependency in react-onsenui. It \"requires\" react@15 because it mostly tested with that version. However, it should work well with react@16 as well so you can ignore that for now.. @asial-matagawa since the very beginning we have specified that import ons from 'onsenui' is not necessary:\n\n// JS import\nimport Vue from 'vue';\nimport VueOnsen from 'vue-onsenui'; // This already imports 'onsenui'\nVue.use(VueOnsen);\n\nTherefore, I don't think this can be considered a breaking change?\n\nCould you fix this problem when you can work on Onsen UI?\n\nIt's intended to be like this, not an error. In order to support ESM, every component must import its corresponding Custom Element. If we go back to using onsenui instead of onsenui/esm internally, Custom Elements would be imported twice (and that throws errors).\nEdit: I just noticed that the Monaca templates do import onsenui at the very beginning... :sweat: . @s-nel Thanks for the PR and testing! I think the changes are fine and confirm it works on FF :+1: \nFixes #1860 . @zabojad I was checking it just now. Give me a few minutes :sweat_smile: . @zabojad Thanks! I'll add it to the changelog.. The WeakMap issue was already fixed in #2263 . @zabojad Hi, thanks for the PR! I was thinking about this after reading your question in the forum and came up with a possible solution. Your PR works in many cases but not in all of them because some components are made of plain span and div. Therefore, rather than hardcoding a list of elements, let's do it in three steps:\n\nI think every /^ons-/i.test(event.target.tagName) can be ignored.\nAny event.target.hasAttribute('prevent-tap') can also be ignored (attribute manually specified by the user).\nIf there is any element between event.target and this (the ons-list-item itself) in the DOM tree that fulfills any of the previous statements, it should also be ignored:\n\njavascript\nutil.findParent(\n  event.target,\n  parent => /^ons-/i.test(parent.tagName) || parent.hasAttribute('prevent-tap'),\n  parent => parent === this\n);\nWhat do you think about that?\nCC @asial-matagawa . @zabojad It's enough but I guess most of the times the attribute will be added to ons-button, ons-switch, ons-radio or ons-checkbox, so checking the tagName can be convenient. A simple event.target.tagName.indexOf('ONS-') === 0 would also do the trick and is a bit faster than a regex.\nIf we only want to check the attribute, the second argument for util.findParent can be a DOM query like '[prevent-tap]' instead of a function. Anyway, let's wait for more feedback.. @zabojad Yes, please modify it :)\nIt would also be nice to have test cases for this in ons-list-item.spec.js :+1: . @zabojad Thanks for the changes! I've modified it a little bit in #2280 . Already merged :). @foubei Hi! Do you mean you want to run Onsen UI inside a webview in Weex?. @oarsheo I think I know the problem. Your app is including Onsen UI twice (and trying to overwrite onInit, etc).\nFrom vue-onsenui 2.4.0 to 2.4.2, it includes onsenui/esm instead of onsenui (different modules), so you should not manually include onsenui in your app. In Vue apps there is no need of including onsenui manually since it's done by vue-onsenui. You can use this.$ons instead of ons object, if that's what you need.\nThis will be restored in 2.4.3 and there will be a proper warning when Onsen UI is included twice (already in master branch). However, as I said before, there is still no need to manually include onsenui.. @mishoboss I think I've seen this before. You can try leaving it blank and setting the attribute later with JavaScript as a workaround.. @mishoboss Not sure, but it's probably fixable somewhere in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/core/src/elements/ons-splitter-side.js\nI'm now busy with another task so I don't have much time for debugging. PRs welcome!. @medianeclick This is not an actual bug. Tabs were not prepared to be dynamic and contain {{ }} in page attribute. You can try ng-attr-page instead to fix the errors but it will probably not load the page correctly. Maybe we can give support to ng-attr-page by allowing lazy loading of page attribute... We'll have a look at it.. @darkylmnx You need to configure font loaders in Webpack. There are templates with this done for you: vue init OnsenUI/vue-cordova-webpack or vue init OnsenUI/vue-pwa-webpack. You can use one of them or just check how they are configured.. @badpunman Oh, I see. Looks like they added Postcss loader in recent updates.\nI was confused with a different issue, I remember I had to add something like this to the templates to make the icons work on Cordova.\nIn any case, looks like a resolving issue. It's probably fixable by changing some configuration in postcss-loader.... @Ralpharoo For the reveal animation, you can add something like this to your app (>= 2.9.0):\n```css\n.ons-ios-scroll ons-tabbar .page:not([shown]) > .page__content {\n  overflow-y: hidden;\n}\n```\nThat will prevent hidden pages in ons-tabbar to scroll when the splitter is open :+1: . @zabojad Thanks again for another PR! I believe, however, this should be implemented by modifying the behavior of existing methods (through options object) instead of creating new methods. Especially considering this one is quite long and will need maintenance. Also, we use top nomenclature to refer to the exact opposite concept in bringPageTop, so it should be called something like popHome or something like that.\nIn any case, I've made a quick implementation of resetToPage with options.pop in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/5855145dc93cf1a83a1202fee01255986ad39946 . Can you implement an option like this in React bindings' resetPageStack method? I think it should set the new stack + the old topPage, then call popPage method instead of pushPage. Ping me if you need any help :). @zabojad The original creators left long ago. React bindings are basically community driven + me reviewing and refactoring/implementing small features. I think somebody will take care of this from January/February, hopefully :). @pzanitti Thanks for reporting! The carousel implementation has changed a lot recently to improve performance and to share code with the new swiping tabbar.\nThe reason of this issue is that the carousel needs to measure some stuff during its first rendering: item size, initial scroll, etc. If the carousel is hidden with display:none then all of these values will be 0 or NaN.\nThe commit where I closed this issue (d7a2b03) doesn't actually fix this completely but prevents error state. After displaying the carousel again, you will need to run something like document.querySelector('ons-carousel').refresh() to fix the carousel. I believe we cannot do this automatically because of Custom Elements API limitations. Vue is toggling element.style.display DOM property with v-show and we have no way of knowing when this happens. If they used element.setAttribute('style', ...) then we could use attributeChangedCallback but, unfortunately, this is not possible with DOM properties (unless we do dirty property override).\nHowever, there's another solution. If you use v-if instead of v-show, the carousel will be able to setup properly on its first rendering. In order to use v-if, you need to wrap you content in <div class=\"content\">...</div> (more about this here).\n```\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n```\nIf you need to toggle it afterwards, then you can use a v-show normally. Just avoid it during the first rendering (or call the element's refresh method).. For the record, I tried something like this 07f859b6e76ab75732c3898a20647dccb136b3f3 and works in Chrome and Firefox. However, style properties are not configurable in Safari and crashes :disappointed: . @jmigual Hi! Thanks for the PR. This is something we want to add but I believe it's a bit more complex than this.\nWe still support some old browsers like Safari for iOS 8 and Android 4.4.4 and those do not support an object as the third parameter of addEventListener. Therefore, it will be considered as true boolean parameter. Also, the one in ons-pull-hook is specifically calling preventDefault so it cannot be passive.\nWe'll try to address this issue in a few weeks.. @randnetdd I think this is the same issue as #2278 but using Angular.js instead of Vue. For now, you can try with ng-if instead of ng-hide. I'll try to check what has changed between these versions and see if we can make it work like before.. @zabojad Hey! I made a comment on a commit, didn't you see it?. @zabojad Hmm, maybe I'm the only one who can see it :sweat_smile: \n\n@zabojad Doesn't this (this.pages = routes.map(renderPage)) need to be called for options.pop as well? I guess that's why you moved var renderPage to the top?. >I think the React bindings might need some refactoring / rewriting to match both React programming good practices as well as OnSenUI components implementation...\nFor now, I can put back down this line which should not have gone up. We can discuss the general implementation of the react bindings in another thread... What do you think?\n\n@zabojad Yes, I agree, it needs refactoring. I already did some but not enough. Feel free to open a new issue/PR and suggest modifications :+1: . It's actually supported in master branch: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/bindings/react/CHANGELOG.md\nI think we'll release soon.. @msaelices Thanks for reporting! I'm aware of this issue. It was working properly before but it was changed to fix React-Redux time travel at some point -- which is not a big reason in my opinion. I'd like to change this back soon.. @msaelices Thanks!. @msolovyov That's visual fix in 2.8.3. Tappable is not triggered by ons-* elements inside ons-list-item anymore. To be honest, we didn't think about ons-col and ons-row. Perhaps we should allow those 2. In any case, do you really need ons-row there? List items are already split into left, center and right parts.. @msolovyov I don't think it's possible in 2.8.3 but I guess we will change it for the next release. Until then, you can apply a quick patch in your root Vue component:\nbeforeCreate() {\n    this.$ons.elements.ListItem.prototype.isExcludedTarget = () => false;\n  }. @jiangbophd Thanks for reporting! I'd need to debug this but I think it is possible to improve scrolling performance when the list is not at the top. It will take some time, though.\n  . This should have somewhat improved in the lastest core release 2.9.0 :+1: . @RamiAlmofleh I guess you need to update your Onsen UI version? Toast was introduced in 2.3.0. @iliran11 Hi! Not sure why that happened. Can you try yarn install --pure-lockfile in onsenui, onsenui/css-components and onsenui/bindings/react? :confused: . @bdedardel It must be something else, yes. The tabs are still and will be horizontal. You can have a look at this example.. @FREEZX Hi! Looks awesome! I'm not an expert in Mithril (actually I just learned it now in 20 min) but I'll try to give you some feedback.\nEverything so far looks reasonable but I find the controllers (NavigatorController and SplitterController) a bit confusing for the end user. For example, the navigator has the Navigator component itself, a pageStack which seems to be read-only for the user (after creation) and then NavigatorController for passing a delegate to child pages. Perhaps I misunderstood something. Am I wrong?\nAs a suggestion, perhaps you can provide Navigator.createPageStack([ initialPages ]), which returns an array with overridden methods to allow calling redraw or update after push/pop/slice/etc. Some kind of reactivity. I guess this might not be very \"Mithril-like\", but it's just a suggestion for the API. Otherwise, perhaps the Navigator component itself could be passed down to the pages directly instead of a NavigatorController? I just feel there are too many entities, but maybe it's just my impression.\nAlso, do you think it's possible to plug Mithril's router with ons-navigator? I'm not sure if the router is configurable enough for that...\nA bit unrelated to the code but it would be great if we can use Rollup in all the bindings instead of Webpack. This is not a requirement, just something nice to have.\nIf you continue with the bindings we can make you a member of the repo so you can freely contribute to both Mithril bindings and the core if necessary :+1: \n. @paulossm I could not reproduce this issue so please make a small example in http://tutorial.onsen.io/?framework=react&category=reference&module=splitter and hit Report an issue button :+1: . @johnkmzhou Hi! I think there is no outline modifier in the material design specs. Therefore, autostyling is removing outline automatically for Android. This could be avoided by adding disable-auto-styling attribute but looks like it doesn't work properly with React/Vue bindings. I'll leave this open as a reminder for this bug :+1: . @johnkmzhou It actually works well when adding disable-auto-styling before modifier attribute: <Ons.Button disable-auto-styling style={{margin: '6px'}} modifier='outline'>Outline</Ons.Button>.. @LucNaterop Maybe we can add some kind of elementRef prop to set the ref in the actual Custom Element and expose it. From there, you could access the inner input by using a DOM property like element.input or element.select. @zabojad Thoughts?. @RyoidenshiAokigahara Hi! Thanks for reporting. I guess you meant something like this https://github.com/OnsenUI/tutorial/commit/251a272dddcb5c5ba39f00e07131a6cc6c53f646\nFor the next time, you can directly hit the \"Improve this\" button and modify it :). @wang-jiali No. It's not an easy task with Web Components but it's somewhere in the roadmap.. @zabojad Hi! Thanks for the PR again. I have a doubt about this. Does defaultValue work as well as a prop? I thought it was only useful as an attribute on native input elements, like <input defaultValue={...}>.\nAlso, could you please add it to Select, Checkbox and Radio (defaultChecked for the last 2) as well for the sake of completeness? Thanks!. @zabojad Hi! I think changing node.value and node.checked is the correct way, yes :+1: I'm not sure if there is another way to let React manage the input in this case. Just two things, I've seen a var p = ... that you probably forgot to remove and also a propType defaultvalue (with v lowercase). Could you change that? Thanks!. @zabojad Yep, thanks!. @asialgearoid Thanks!\n. @emccorson Thanks!. @asialgearoid That's true. I thought we were saying somewhere to run ons.fastClick.destroy() so they would need window.FastClick to attach it again. However, now that I think about it again, perhaps it was an issue related to ons.GestureDetector and not ons.fastClick. Nevermind, I think it's fine like this. Thanks!. @asialgearoid Whenever you have time, could you please have a quick look at this? I've added the passive option to every event that needs it except when we actually need to prevent default behavior for fixing bugs on iOS. I've been checking iOS Safari 11 and I believe it works well. I think UIWebView and Safari <= 9 don't support passive listeners so it shouldn't change anything.\n. @Ralpharoo You can try it with the latest development build :). @Ralpharoo Can't see flickerings anymore after the last commit :). @asialgearoid Yep, I agree we should support dev env as well, thanks!. @cmcampione Hi! Angular2 styles prop is scoped CSS, whereas modifiers are meant to be global (so they can be reused in every toast element). This is not something we need to fix on our side, it's just how scoped CSS is supposed to work. You can inline CSS with <style> tag in your component like they explain here and it will work.\nNothing to fix :+1: . @priand Hi! As the readme of OnsenUI/react-onsenui says: This package has been moved to the main Onsen UI repository.. So yes, OnsenUI/OnsenUI/bindings/react is the current code. Now, have a look at the changelog: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/bindings/react/CHANGELOG.md\nonInfiniteScroll is the only change in master branch since the last release, hence the difference with the last version of NPM. We will release a new version for everything probably next week. If you want something 'now', then check the latest development build: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI#get-onsen-ui :+1: . @asialgearoid Actually I tested that in both iOS UIWebView and Safari, and it was working well. I thought it would scroll to the top but it did not. Maybe we should test it further.... Continues in #2328 . @Ralpharoo  e8dd108 actually only fixes this bug if the active tab is the first one (index 0). I could fix it for the other indexes but it was creating another random flickering. I guess this is the most common scenario so let's close this for now :+1: . @Ralpharoo 2.9.0 already contains this fix, and 2.9.1 didn't modify anything important for this. I think the only important change in master branch was made in #2316 fix. Do you think that is affecting the flickering?\nPerhaps we should provide a way to specify if the toolbar should be animated or not if this improves pushing pages in some situations.. @Ralpharoo I've added a new static attribute for the toolbar (for 2.9.2) which will skip navigator animations and thus improve performance. I think the root of this issue is that a tab bar is loading multiple pages at the same time, not only one. Adding a push animation to that might be too much in some situations. Maybe we can try to modify the way pages are loaded and delay hidden pages until animations are finished... That will take some time, though :/. @Ralpharoo Thanks for giving it a try! Did you see any flickering after that? The concept is similar but I'd like to do it in a different way without getting the navigator inside tab or tabbar. There is a _show hook that should be called right after animations so I think we can use that. I'll try to have a look at it this week :+1: . @Ralpharoo Hey, I think something like this commit e89459658e22056fb162c490d2c35cfdd5f27653 should do the lazy load. However, it might not remove the flickering :/. @Eyrum Hi! Your Splitter is a child of Navigator so whenever you change Navigator's content, the Splitter will be affected. If you always want a Splitter in your app, the you should move it to your root component and make it a parent of the Navigator. There's an example in the tutorial app: http://tutorial.onsen.io/?framework=react&category=common%20patterns&module=splitter_navigator. @laelbe I guess this is for the options.defaultValue. Makes sense, thanks!. @Hirbod Well, swipe-to-pop is only meant to be used with slide animation. You would need to remove swipeable attribute if you sometimes push a page with a different animation. Something like this could work:\njs\nmyNavigator.addEventListener('postpush', function(event) {\n  if (event.enterPage.pushedOptions.animation === 'lift') {\n    myNavigator.removeAttribute('swipeable');\n  }\n});\nmyNavigator.addEventListener('postpop', function(event) {\n  if (event.enterPage.pushedOptions.animation !== 'lift') {\n    myNavigator.setAttribute('swipeable', '');\n  }\n});\nI guess we could add some code to the core to avoid this situation. @Hirbod \n\nI guess we could add some code to the core to avoid this situation\n\nMeans that I actually agree. Until anything like \"flick to dismiss\" is implemented we can just prevent it.. As said in #2333, it is not meant to work with other animations. We can continue the discussion there since I think this issue does not add anything new :+1: . @Thibaud-M I guess there is something in the project setup breaking this because we didn't make any change to the CSS recently :thinking:\nYou could also use onsenui-core.css instead (doesn't include fonts) and import the fonts you need manually in your project.. @asial-matagawa Any idea?. @sbusch Hi, thanks for all the research! I purposely implemented this only for vanilla JS and Angular users since I believe React and Vue users have already enough control over the page stack. I think in React it's possible to use resetPageStack with options.pop to achieve the same result. Can you check if this works for you?. @sbusch Did it work?. @sbusch Looks good, thanks!. @sbusch I was thinking that, while this works, wouldn't it be better the camel case version readOnly? https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#all-supported-html-attributes. @sbusch Thanks!. Looks like I can only reproduce these issues when running inside an iframe (like in the playground). @qqt2018 Did you see this problem in your actual app or just in the playground example?. https://onsen.io/v2/guide/theming.html#cross-platform-styling-autostyling. @burka Thanks for the fix! I actually think updating classes is not necessary anymore. In recent versions, the core elements restore their own class when needed so I think we could remove this logic from the React side.... @laelbe Hi, thanks for the PR! Could you please submit a small example where the issue can be seen? Also, I think we cannot use this.closest since it is not supported on iOS 8.. @Jake21x You can just use the same name attribute in your radio buttons to group them, just like native <input type=\"radio\">. Please reopen with a description if what you want is actually different from this.. @AntonGame Hi! I just tried it on my Android 8.0 and it still works as usual. Are you forking/downloading master branch, running yarn, running npm run build and then generating your app? You will also need to include <script src=\"cordova.js\"></script> in your index.html, although this shouldn't be the source of your issue...\nFor quick development, I highly recommend using Monaca CLI with Monaca Debugger in their free versions. You can get the preview on your phone in a matter of seconds.. @AntonGame Cordova and Monaca use the device's webview, so it should be the same unless you are importing a different webview somehow. Do you get any error? Perhaps some files are not included or something else. I'd suggest starting with more basic examples and see if they work in your environment.. @ubill Hi! No, the data-v attribute is added by Vue for scoped css or something else. The list item is actually unrelated to the inputs. The click is propagated to the inputs thanks to the native <label> element and its for attribute. Maybe you can check if it works with native HTML elments, something like:\n<label for=\"checkbox-0\">click here</label><input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"checkbox-0\">. @renanbandeira Hi, thanks for the PR! Could you please check what is calling _setSwiping in your situation (error stack trace)? Perhaps there is a listener that is not being removed or something similar that we should fix instead of just adding an if statement.. @LEinfeldt Hi! This is not a real bug, it's just that both tabbar and carousel throw events with similar names. Events bubble up and you are basically setting the index for both events. You can check something like event.target === event.currentTarget to ensure that the event is fired by the current component \ud83d\udc4d . @elshobokshy You are not supposed to have more than one template in your single file components :sweat_smile: . You are mixing there some syntax, I'd recommend starting with Vue official guide.. @markhats Can you provide a repro? Otherwise, it's hard for us to debug.. @kswedberg This is just an issue in the docs, the methods shouldn't be there since they don't make sense in Vue. Perhaps we could add forceUIWebViewScrollFix, which was added in the last core release, but that's it :sweat_smile: . You can still use $ons._ons.forceUIWebViewScrollFix() but I guess it doesn't help either. UIWebView has scrolling issues hard to debug :/. You can test on iOS Safari browser since it already uses WKWebView. Overall it should be better but it might add other issues related to XHR requests or something else.. @snazzypants Looks like there are no props for that in React bindings. You can simply use the core methods: document.querySelector('ons-speed-dial').hideItems() :+1: . Missing Japanese translation.\n. I guess this kind of thing is not necessary anymore, right?\nif (this._watchedAttributes.indexOf(name) !== -1)\n. In that case we are forced to always extend the same element, right? We cannot do extend HTMLLabelElement, for example. Not sure if this is well supported in the polyfill anyway.\n. Nice catch :)\n. That was fixed in my local branch, I forgot to push.. :scream: . If it's already a page it returns itself, so I thought \"innerPage\" could be misleading. What do you think?. We are already using topPage for the Navigator so I think using the same API makes sense. It is not documented for Splitter or Tabbar so we can change it at any time without problems. We could even document it since it could be useful sometimes.... Well, it is basically the \"next page to check\".. I forgot we had that utility :sweat_smile: \n. @asialgearoid It's internal so I guess it's not an issue :sweat_smile: . It is just for debugging in the future.. @asialgearoid I don't think so, the pull-hook flickering issue is not related to the overflow: hidden thing on iOS. This one was also necessary for Android, it's a different issue from the iOS page scroll flickering. Actually I could not reproduce it in my Android 7 but I remember seeing the issue in older versions some time ago, so it's safer to keep it.. That's correct, instead of prevent-tap they should just remove tappable from ons-list-item. I'll try to make that more readable, thanks!. ",

I am using \"ui-router\" with OnSen, and it works great, here is some example code...\n\nHere is an example of what it looks like...\nbootstrap.js\n```\nangular.module('myApp').config(function ($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {\n$stateProvider\n.state('dashboard', {\n    url: '/dashboard',\n    templateUrl: 'dashboard.html',\n    options: {\n        canSwipe: true\n    }\n})\n\n...\n\n.state('help', {\n    url: '/help',\n    templateUrl: 'help.html',\n    options: {\n        canSwipe: true\n    }\n});\n\n// if none of the above states are matched, use this as the fallback\n$urlRouterProvider.otherwise('/dashboard');\n\n});\n```\nMainCtrl.js\n```\n$scope.$on('$stateChangeSuccess', function(event, toState, toParams, fromState, fromParams){\n    switch (toParams.action) {\n        case 'push':\n            $scope.ons.navigator.pushPage(app.state.current.templateUrl);\n            break;\n        default:\n            if ($scope.ons.splitView) {\n                $scope.ons.splitView.setMainPage(toState.templateUrl);\n            }\n    }\n$timeout(function () {\n    if ($scope.ons.splitView) {\n        $scope.ons.splitView.close();\n    }\n}, 100);\n\n$scope.state = $state.current;\n\n});\n```\n. I have used both in projects and OnsenUI currently has a better and more mature architecture. Performance is quite noticeable between the two when testing on Android devices; on the iPhone, they seem to be the same both performing very smoothly. I think one of the key attributors to performance / UX is OnsenUI takes advantage of native scrolling where it can and only adds custom scrolling if needed. Forms work well in OnsenUI where with Ionic, it takes a bit more work to get them to work properly. Lastly, I like the split view option in OnsenUI to better support tablet devices. At the time of writing Ionic just released beta 4.\n. ",

    "reqshark": "@roboncode that example is interesting to me because it's linking UI-Router state to some of the inside page state logic from onsenui.js. \nPassing a templateUrl available from one of the UI-Router callbacks/arguments is one way to connect them. \nIt could be implemented from the other direction, with Onsenui directive notifying ui-router of a state chagne since ui-router is flexible toward ad-hoc URL changes.\nIs the pageUrl (template) passed to onsenui directives in the HTML markup the one thing we can count on to pass as a reliable object both frameworks aknowledge?  Or are there more things? That's probably the one safe thing always shared between them. \nThe desire to link their state knowledge is motivated by Onsenui's state changes having been implemented independently from ngRouting, or ui-router for that matter, like when binding the PageUrl, its own $scope compilation calls receive/interpret and append template data. Exposing template data in a directive gives us that easy logic of pointing at page templates in HTML attributes, a nice markup solution like UI-Router's named ui-view. I guess that's what Misko means by \"the declarative nature.\"\nIntroducing ui-router view changes are probably going to be nested in child scopes/controllers since onsenui often manages the viewport, which is like the entire screen. Having that in the background shouldn't prevent nested $scopes or state changes from happening (the case in which we might not want to pass state knowledge to/from onsenui and keep some template data isolated to ui-router)\nDespite that, my gut feeling is that registering pageURL changes taking place in Onsen during $rootScope run/configure stage of UI-Router could lend us a nicer merge of all the benefits. That might be a better to way to have shared state among ui-view managed state control with the native style mobile UI provided, without having to issue ons internal property functions at the controller level.\n.

Hi,\nare there any news about supporting Windows Phones in the near future?\nWe are planning to use OnsenUI cross-platform including Windows Phones. So, it's crucial if OnsenUI is working on Windows Phone 8.1\n. Actually there is a problem with your orientation detection:\n``` javascript\nfunction getLandscapeOrPortraitFromInteger(orientation) {\n            if (orientation === undefined ) {\n              return window.innerWidth > window.innerHeight ? 'landscape' : 'portrait';\n            }\n        if (orientation == 90 || orientation == -90) {\n          return 'landscape';\n        }\n\n        if (orientation === 0 || orientation == 180) {\n          return 'portrait';\n        }\n      }\n\n```\nThe orientation 0 does not mean portrait mode for all devices. My Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 is generally in landscape mode at 0 degrees. \nThe solution might be returning \nreturn window.innerWidth > window.innerHeight ? 'landscape' : 'portrait';\nin all cases. This works for me.\n. Hi,\nthis problem still exists in onsen-ui 1.1.3 - 2014-09-12\n. It's Android 4.4.4 (Cyanogen Mod)\nSamsung Tab: GT-P5110\n. ",

Hi @argelius !\nThank you for your fast reply!!\nI investigated this problem furthermore after creating this incident (I think you know the 'deal') and I guess your right with the conflict.\nThe DIV tho 'logo' (which is plain text) had a padding top of -15px and we never taught about the fact that Onsen UI has integrated functionality for this.

I will play around with this but I guess we did not adjust this by ourselves so it's from the Onsen UI core and thus it's a bug (I believe).\nFor the AdMob problem:\nI guess your solution will work (document.body.style.padding/margin Bottom: -50px;) and we tried and tested this but it doesn't work smooth and at the way we want it.\nWe will change our ads to the system of 'Leadbolt' (can I name this here?) from which you can include the ads inline by javascript. Since AdMob works outside the webview more incidents are expected in the future so we don't want to take this risk.\nAgain, thank you for your answers.\n. Problem with the AdMob ads is still going on...\nWhen I try to modify margin bottom of the page or specific onsen elements (such like the ons-tabbar) it actually looks great.

You are right! @argelius it would be perfect if you could combine it with this plugin: http://www.tricedesigns.com/2013/10/08/status-tapscroll-to-top-in-phonegap-apps-on-ios/\n. @Hirbod @argelius The \"statusTap\" event of org.apache.cordova.statusbar seems to work fine for iOS8 as found in: http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/touch-top-of-ios-status-bar-to-scroll-back-to-top/5647/4 \nTested it myself and the event works. Together with @argelius his snippet i created a global method for this. The only problem is that when a list is being scrolled and the statusbar is tapped when the scrolling isn't yet finished, it finishes after the scroll to top is completed, causing the list not to be scrolled to the top. \nAny idea if i can \"cancel\" the current scroll in some way? \n. Thanks @salztorte. Since Onsen already has a touch library included i prefer to do it with that one. Anybody an idea? \np.s.: I think we should have a fix for this and disable it by default, it's not really diserable behavior. \n. Thanks @argelius. Makes sense for a search indeed. \nFor some other filters we can't always filter the available variables in the scope and we would like to \"rebuild\" the data array. That goes well in your example if we replace the scope array. \nOnly thing is that we're using the height calculation to insert headers into the list. When we replace the data array the heights don't get updated and the heights from the headers are wrong and vice versa. \nAny idea on that?\n. @filipefreitas82 iOS does not fully support position: fixed. What you can do is put the search box at the beginning of the page and under that an ons-scroll element that contains the list. Now you can set the height of the ons-scroll element to the remaining height which causes the search bar to be always visible. \n. @argelius, any idea on replacing the data entry and keeping the heights correct for the new items? \n. Thanks @argelius! Looking forward to it!\n. ",
    "gogodigimo": "Great to hear, Masahirotanaka. Thanks for all your efforts!\n. I'm was experiencing the same issues as before - but then, I found that adding the viewport metatag fixed almost everything:\n< meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no\" >\nHowever, I'm still not seeing the ion font icons working with Windows Phone after transitioning to the latest version.\n. I'm experiencing this as well.\n. Thanks for the quick response, @asial-matagawa . \nHere is a good example of what I am experiencing:\n<ons-template` id=\"homepage.html\">\n        <ons-page>\n            <div class=\"hero-div-container\">\n                <div class=\"hero-div\">\n                    <div><img class=\"logo\" src=\"img/logo.png\" /></div>\n                    <div class=\"large-search-bar\">\n                        <img id=\"btnSearch\" src=\"img/Search-Icon.png\" data-tap-disabled=\"true\" ng-click=\"SearchFromJumpStart()\" class=\"search-icon-large\" align=\"right\" />\n                        <input id=\"SearchJumpStart\" type=\"number\" class=\"embedded-textbox\" onkeyup=\"return isKeypressEnter(event, callJumpStartSearch)\" ng-attr-placeholder=\"{{translations['search-by-zip-code']}}\">\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"account-link\"><button id=\"signinlink\" class=\"button-noborder\" ng-click=\"GoToSignInPage()\" ng-bind=\"translations['sign-in']\"></button></div>\n                    <div class=\"account-link\"><button id=\"registerlink\" class=\"button-noborder\" ng-click=\"GoToCreateAccountPage()\" ng-bind=\"translations['create-account']\"></button></div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </ons-page>\n    </ons-template>\nIn the above code, the button with ID signinlink works great on both iOS and Android, however the button with ID btnSearch is only calling the SearchFromJumpStart() on Android, not iOS.. I have found in iOS that if I double tap the image with ID \"btnSearch\" in the code above, it works. It just doesn't work with a single tap as it does in Android.. Thanks very much, @asial-matagawa \nWhat is also interesting is that if I wrap the btnSearch image in a button container it works exactly as it should in iOS:\n<div class=\"large-search-bar\">\n    <button ng-click=\"SearchFromJumpStart()\"><img src=\"img/Search-Icon.png\" class=\"search-icon-large\" align=\"right\" /></button>\n    <input id=\"SearchJumpStart\" type=\"number\" class=\"embedded-textbox\" onkeyup=\"return isKeypressEnter(event, callJumpStartSearch)\" ng-attr-placeholder=\"{{translations['search-by-zip-code']}}\">\n</div>. I believe I have tracked this down to Angular, not Onsen.\nI eventually stumbled upon this helpful chain and was able to get my functions firing using the ng-mobile-click attribute:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/25032237/ng-click-on-firing-on-mobile-or-tablet-devices\nThanks for your efforts, @asial-matagawa .. Very cool. Thanks for the idea, @asial-matagawa . I will try it out :). Not when I put it in my current app, but it's possible there's a conflict with one of the additional libraries I'm using. I'll start a new project and try it out.. So, I think I've figured out the source of the problem. I was loading the app using \nvar module = angular.module('my-app', ['onsen']); \nwith the ng-app in my html attributes:\n<html lang=\"en\" ng-app=\"my-app\">\nWhen I remove those and change my controller declaration from:\nmodule.controller('AppController', function ($scope) {\nto\nons.bootstrap().controller('AppController', function ($scope) {\nit works just fine.\nForgive my ignorance, but is there a way now to import other angular libraries into the module?\nIn other words, how would I emulate the following using ons.bootstrap()?\nvar module = angular.module('app', ['onsen.directives', 'ngSanitize', 'ngAnimate', 'ngAria', 'ngMessages', 'ngTouch', 'ngMaterial']);.

Coz I am using a splitview and I want my login page displayed without sliding menu on the left.\nPS.\nSeems the link for Download 1.1.1 on your home page is wrong.

    "cfjedimaster": "I don't believe your comment make sense. Just because Onsen UI is built for PG doesn't mean it should include a complete project. Consider - PG 4.0 may have a different project structure when it is released, which means the zips you have now would not be compatible. If you used just the www folder, then it would be since you can create a new project via another folder. Plus, it would be easier to re-use for other projects locally w/o having to redownload from the site.\n. Well, we are talking about two different things. bower can be used to install the core library, and that's cool. I'm talking specifically about the templates you guys built. Again - if you download the zips, you will see they are complete PhoneGap projects. They have a platforms folder, hooks, etc. You don't need to include anything more than the www folder, and doing so makes your templates more future proof in case the project layout changes in the PG/Cordova CLI.\n. ",
    "dashmug": "I also agree that it is cleaner if you just include the /www folder in the download.\n. ",
    "martSforever": "try remove the directive: ng-csp, i remove ng-csp directive and that my ng-show and ng-hide is working. ",
    "siegfriedbolz": "Hello,\ni used the Patterns from Onsen to create a List of Radio Buttons. If you click on the Checkmark-Icon or on the Label-Text, the GUI does not update (but the model does). If you click on the empty space on the right of the Label-Text, everything is ok.\nYou can test this behavior with the iOS Simulator.\n<li class=\"list__item list__item--tappable\">\n      <span class=\"list__item__line-height\">\n        <label class=\"radio-button wrapper-label\">\n            <input type=\"radio\" name=\"topcoat\" value=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"radio-button__checkmark\"></div>\n            <span class=\"radio-button-label\">Safari</span>\n        </label>\n     </span>\n  </li>\nBest,\nSiegfried\n. Hi @anatoo \ni tried several possibilities with the android:windowSoftInputMode but nothing worked. I think it must be an Android issue, i have no problems (and i have no special configuration) with iOS.\n. Thanks for your snippet, sadly it does not worked for me. The event was not catched. I solved it with an Angular Directive Workaround which adds some extra space to the bottom of the page.\n. ",
    "mcmillion": "Same problem here. Label click events aren't getting propagated down to the input. A quick workaround is to attach a click event to all of the label.checkbox elements and have them click their inner checkbox inputs:\njavascript\n$(function() {\n  $(document).on('click', 'label.checkbox', function() {\n    $(this).find('input[type=checkbox]')[0].click();\n  });\n});\n. ",
    "Hirbod": "Can confirm this bug.

I've faced the same issue that clicking twice can cause weird behaviour or even errors when there is no other page to pop(). Please merge the code or \"write it your own way\" to prevent copyright issues. This is an important bugfix!\nERROR: Error: NavigatorView's page stack is empty.\nThis is one of the problems you could face...\n.

Just some interessting informations about orientation:\nhttp://www.matthewgifford.com/blog/2011/12/22/a-misconception-about-window-orientation/\n. I've the same problem. Please add the ionicons.min.css\n\n. You are just amazing @anatoo \nThank you very much. Hope this will not collide with the bottom bar.\n. I'm looking so badly for this feature. Don't hesitate to place a bounty for it on bountysource. iirc Ionic and F7 do have support for this. seems not to be that complicated (onsen ui also has native scrolling, right?)\nhttps://github.com/nolimits4web/Framework7/commit/6e705a652e3c06d91df32b4ca3d0143f471fe60c\nmaybe this could help\n. Can't wait for it. This and slide-left to popPage() are the most important missing features in OnsenUI.\n. :(. So I can't use it without modifying everything :(. I was sure this will be an ons scroll directive. I'll try how I can achieve it :). Thank you @argelius\n. But I'm sure your are not using the new version 1.2.1\nThe versions below < 1.2.0 placed the map over the WebView. And I guess you did not watch the Safari WebInspector to figure out where the new page stack gets injected.\n``` javascript\n    // Start Controller\n    app.controller('StartController', function($scope, $window, $rootScope) {\n    // Hide the accessory bar by default (remove this to show the accessory bar above the keyboard\n    // for form inputs)\n    if(window.cordova && window.cordova.plugins.Keyboard) {\n      //cordova.plugins.Keyboard.hideKeyboardAccessoryBar(true);\n    }\n    if(window.StatusBar) {\n      // org.apache.cordova.statusbar required\n      //StatusBar.styleDefault();\n    }\n\n    $('ons-sliding-menu div:first').css('background-color', 'rgba(0,0,0,0)');\n\n\n\n    if($rootScope.map) {\n\n        console.log('OK THERE WAS A ROOTSCOPE.MAP');\n\n        $rootScope.map.removeEventListener();\n        $rootScope.map.remove();\n        $rootScope.map.setDiv(null);\n        $('#map_canvas').remove();\n\n        $rootScope.map = '';\n\n    }\n\n    //window.plugins.spinnerDialog.show();\n\n    setTimeout(function(){\n\n        var div = document.getElementById(\"map_canvas\");\n        $('#map_canvas').css('height', (($(window).height() - $('#map_canvas').offset().top) / 2));\n\n\n        if(!$rootScope.map) {\n            $rootScope.map = plugin.google.maps.Map.getMap(div);\n            $rootScope.map.setBackgroundColor('white');\n            $rootScope.map.on(plugin.google.maps.event.MAP_READY, $scope.onMapInit);\n        }\n\n        //$rootScope.map.setDebuggable(true);\n\n\n        //window.plugins.spinnerDialog.hide();\n\n        //$rootScope.map.refreshLayout();\n\n\n    }, 600);\n\n\n    $scope.onMapInit = function(map){\n        console.log('MAP INITED');\n\n        //$scope.map.getMyLocation($scope.onSuccess, $scope.onError);\n        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition($scope.onSuccess, $scope.onError, {enableHighAccuracy:true});\n\n    };\n\n    $scope.onSuccess = function(position) {\n\n        console.log('LOCATION TRACED SUCCESSFULY');\n\n        const MY_POS = new plugin.google.maps.LatLng(position.coords.latitude,position.coords.longitude);\n\n\n        $rootScope.map.addMarker({\n\n            'position': MY_POS,\n            'title': 'hi'\n\n        }, function(marker) {\n            //marker.showInfoWindow();\n\n            console.log(location.latLng);\n\n            //$rootScope.map.setZoom(8);\n            $rootScope.map.setCenter(MY_POS);\n\n            $rootScope.map.animateCamera({\n\n                'target': MY_POS,\n                'zoom': 17,\n                'duration': 5000,\n                'bearing': -140,\n                'tilt': 50\n\n            },  function() {\n\n\n                }\n\n            );\n\n\n        });\n\n    };\n\n    $scope.onError = function(msg) {\n        alert(\"error: \" + msg);\n    };\n\n```\nAnd be careful, cause this was one of my memory problems:\n$scope.map.addEventListener(plugin.google.maps.event.MAP_READY, onMapInit());\nIf you init on every ControllerInit, you will have a bunch of MAP_READY callbacks triggered. Thats why I remove the events.\n. 1.2.1 and 1.2.0 does not have big differences.\nBut I'm on iOS 7.1.2 with newest OnsenUI\n. And this bug cause a small shift on every pushPage().\nAfter loading \"Home\" for 10 times, my view look like this and I get a memory warning in console.\nAfter 20 times the complete topbar is gone. This only happens if I init the map once. If I dont init the map, everything works properly. Maybe I caused this bug (wrong view? or something else) or the plugin or everything... haha..\n\n. Hey guys, \nit's not the plugins fault. I removed the plugin init and the bug still occurs. I guess its the view causing that error. But why?\nindex.html\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<!--\n    Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n    or more contributor license agreements.

I just copied this from the \"SensationApp\" but it seems to be buggy... i solved the problem as is removed it\n. duplicate of #177 \n. Hi @masahirotanaka,\nthese patterns are the same like the ones on Onsen.io.\nSeems like you've deleted some of the old ones. Before you had something like a facebook timeline with \"comments\" and some reply buttons etc. \nThere are gone and I did not save them :(\n. No :(\n. To give you a hint: before you changed, the login.html had a logo. Maybe you know when this changed to find the right tree. I appreciate your help\n. Yiha. you found them. Exactly what I was looking for. you should bring them back (maybe with directives) on your page cause they are really nice. thank you very much for your help\n. On phonegap I would recommend to stick on the native confirmation and alert plugin as it fits perfect to the depending ui you stick with\n. This is a important and known behavior at least on iOS and I'm missing this feature so badly. it should be there as an option so the user or the code can decide what to do on swipe left. I would appreciate this feature request! thanks for your quick response\n. @argelius @anatoo will this come anytime?\nIt's the last little part from making iOS feel real native.\n. nice @argelius - closed without any Information? \n. @argelius @frandiox is swipe to pop implemented in OnsenUI 2? Could not find any documents about this. Thanks, can't wait for this feature. Was about to switch to Ionic but came back as I just realized how much I do love Onsen :). I'm using a phone gap plugin which place it's native content behind the webview (body is set to transparent).\nActually I'd like the reveal animation but it causes weird behavior with this special case (it need to be behind to put content on top of it). In case I have the map loaded, I need to change to push, but actually other sites could be on reveal. \nhttps://github.com/wf9a5m75/phonegap-googlemaps-plugin/wiki/Map#put-html-elements-on-the-map\ntherefore I need to have the option to change the animation programmatically \n. Thank you very much @anatoo \n. iOS 7.1.2, Phonegap App compiled with Xcode 5 and grey-component.css. \n. iPhone 5 \n. Got the bug. It's caused trough this plugin: https://github.com/wf9a5m75/phonegap-googlemaps-plugin\nThis plugin places it's content under the web view and need to change all parent elements to transparent. I redo all changes done by this plugin on a new pageinit now. Fixed the problem! Onsen was not the fault. Sorry for the wrong alarm! \n. OnsenUI is a CSS Framework. Of course you can use localStorage.\nThere are two ways. You can access directly with window.localStorage or you could use a AngluarJS service\nhttps://github.com/grevory/angular-local-storage\nhttps://github.com/gsklee/ngStorage\n. I can confirm this bug is patched. Thank you! I've just installed 1.2.0 beta, but know I receive follwing error on each push:\n```\nERROR: Error: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'bindings.push(binding)')\nangular/angular.js:6796:22\nngBindHtmlLink@file:///var/mobile/Applications/2D038FE1-CE1C-4DBD-8DBB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/angular/angular.js:21620:34\n70EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/angular/angular.js:8111:15\nnodeLinkFn@file:///var/mobile/Applications/2D038FE1-CE1C-4DBD-8DBB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/angular/angular.js:7623:23\npplications/2D038FE1-CE1C-4DBD-8DBB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/angular/angular.js:6991:23\njs:6994:24\nnodeLinkFn@file:///var/mobile/Applications/2D038FE1-CE1C-4DBD-8DBB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/angular/angular.js:7618:35\nt.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/angular/angular.js:6991:23\nnodeLinkFn@file:///var/mobile/Applications/2D038FE1-CE1C-4DBD-8DBB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/angular/angular.js:7618:35\nE1-CE1C-4DBD-8DBB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/angular/angular.js:6991:23\ncompositeLinkFn@file:///var/mobile/Applications/2D038FE1-CE1C-4DBD-8DBB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/angular/angular.js:6994:24\niteLinkFn@file:///var/mobile/Applications/2D038FE1-CE1C-4DBD-8DBB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/angular/angular.js:6994:24\nonsen/js/angular/angular.js:7618:35\ncompositeLinkFn@file:///var/mobile/Applications/2D038FE1-CE1C-4DBD-8DBB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/angular/angular.js:6991:23\nB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/angular/angular.js:6870:45\nlink@file:///var/mobile/Applications/2D038FE1-CE1C-4DBD-8DBB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/onsenui.js:7834:17\nons/2D038FE1-CE1C-4DBD-8DBB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/onsenui.js:8076:15\nfile:///var/mobile/Applications/2D038FE1-CE1C-4DBD-8DBB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/onsenui.js:7960:30\n[native code]\nobile/Applications/2D038FE1-CE1C-4DBD-8DBB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/onsenui.js:3699:30\nonGlobalMessage@file:///var/mobile/Applications/2D038FE1-CE1C-4DBD-8DBB-843530570EE0/Nachbarschaft.app/www/vendors/onsen/js/onsenui.js:3764:29 \n```\n. Just for information. The described bug in my last post was related due to an old version of angular-sanitize and isn't cause trough OnsenUI. Version 1.2.0 beta fixed all the blink bugs and feelds much smoother.\nThank you very much guys!\n. And what about popPage() ? I guess a global function should be much better then saving all the states and evaluating them manually. imho. @argelius \n. Hi,\nyes, the error disappear when I remove ng-bind-html.\nI used it this way:\n<div ng-bind-html=\"msg\"></div>\nBefore I updated to 1.2.0 beta I did not had this problem. (Also, before is was usin angular 1.2.X, now its 1.3.X...\n. Hi,\nI'm using v1.0.3. I never thought that this could be related due to an old sanitize version. Thanks for the hint. Upgraded to 1.3.1 and the bug is fixed. Thank you very much @argelius \n. Yes, it does not move on swipe. It was really the same code as in your example, I just copied into my project and upgraded to 1.2.0 beta, but it wont swipe, but will initialize. I swapped now to \"slick angular\", cause I was in hurry.\n. This issue is relaxed toll #361 and\nhttp://youtu.be/um_mQRAcWIw\nI guess all my problems happened due to sliding menu\n. \niOS 8.1 - Simulator and real iPhone 6 Plus device.\nOnsenUI 1.2.0 beta\n. Ok, you're right. The bug was related due to an old cached log. The patch fixed the error. But actually it is not in Cordova 3.6.3, we need to wait for an official release.\n. I can confirm that. It's not trimmed (actually I'm not sure if this behaviour ever worked) and it is not centered. On some smaller devices it also breaks my layout on very long titles\n. imho, ellipsis should definitely be a default option! I can't imagine any use case were it should be nice to have a broken layout or bad looking tabbar. (I build a community app and some users could have very long names / nicknames)\n. :+1: \n. I'm not so familiar with Stack Overflow. I already tried with ng-model, but it does not work.\n. So, this is a bug. I can confirm that ng-model will update the scope but will not set initial state when controller is loaded.\n. @argelius  \nThis was the only way to get this working:\nhtml\n      <ons-list-item ng-repeat=\"setting in switches.options\">\n        {{setting.name}}\n        <label class=\"switch switch--list-item\">\n            <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"switch__input\" name=\"setting.name\" ng-model=\"setting.value\" ng-change=\"saveSettings()\">\n            <div class=\"switch__toggle\"></div>\n        </label>\n      </ons-list-item>\nIt won't work with <ons-switch ng-model=\"foo\"></ons-switch>\nYou should reopen this issue.\n. You're welcome. Thanks for your support all the time. I really appreciate this!\nPlease keep in mind, that ng-changed also does not work on ons-switch. Only if you do it my way. If I use ons-switch I can only use onchange=\"\" but it will not call a $scope.function, instead a global function - this is not so nice. Could you add support for ng-change? (ons-switch renderes a checkbox, just add ng-change to the markup of the checkbox)\nThank you.\n. Can't you set the checked attribute based on the value returned from ng-model while you render the checkbox from the ons-switch directive?\n. By the way: scrolling should be possible in the menu of course but should not be possible in that small  20px area. Of course I could hack around (on post open add a touch move listener on that .page class with a return false but I guess a clean method should be better\n. And by the way, please provide a option \"click to close\" on the page-frame.. But just as an option. Would be nice, I guess. What do you think?\n. Dear @argelius \nas far as I can see, this only fix click-events - but will not behave like native behavior (closing the menu when click on the page)\nWould you please integrate this also?\n. And your fix will also do something real bad: \n\nit will break the nav-icon at the right side. With your pointer-events none, you have to activate click on page to close the menu or the user will only be able to close it when he choose something or swipe..\nOr does mainPage.children() not effect the toolbar?\n. I'm sorry... as I can see you already did that and even changed to hammer instead of click. Very nice. Will try right now and give you some feedback, if you don't mind :)\n. @argelius \nSorry for the spam, just installed the dev - and everything is really broken.\nThe first time, everything works well. But after the menu was open, I can't click ANYTHING more. It's only possible to open menu with sliding, cant even click any button inside the page. Something seem to break all the pointer events. \nhttp://youtu.be/HXOa7FFd_1U\n. @argelius \nThank you, I'll try right now. Any chances 1.2.2 going live these days? Want to push my in the appstore in 2-3 days.\n. @argelius can confirm it fixed the bug. Works like charm. But broke ons-row align=\"center\"\nJust changed the onsenui.css and the onsenui.js file (not minified)\n\n``` html\n    \n\n      <ons-button ng-hide=\"image\" ng-click=\"imageActionSheet();\"><ons-icon icon=\"ion-camera\" fixed-width=\"true\"></ons-icon> Ausw\u00e4hlen</ons-button>\n\n        <ons-button ng-show=\"image\" ng-click=\"uploadVerifyImage();\">\n            <ons-icon icon=\"ion-checkmark-circled\" fixed-width=\"true\"></ons-icon> Verifikation abschlie\u00dfen\n        </ons-button>\n    </ons-col>\n</ons-row>\n\n```\nBefore I've updated, it was centered.\n. And I found another sliding menu bug. If I call a resetToPage or another page which also includes the menu button, if opens and closes immediately.\nLike the events where doubled.\n. Here, the demo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZGvqjERybY&feature=youtu.be\n. align=\"center\" is related. I've reverted the master and everything is fine now.\nAs I mentioned, I just changed one .JS and one .CSS file. Maybe stylus folder etc. is important too?\nI only have a navigator created in DOM once I launch the app (home.html, which resetToPage to home2.html). home.html will never be called again.\n. I did all the steps 1:1 as mentioned on the Wiki \n. I'd never tried in a browser, as it is not possible due to my native plugins. Just tried on iOS Device and Simulator. Before your fixed, this problem did not happen. (just that other problem)\nI'm sure that .off('tab') is not called in some case, and instead, on('tab') is binded twice - which will toggle my menu\n``` html\n  \n<div class=\"left\">\n  <ons-toolbar-button onclick=\"ons.slidingMenu.toggleMenu()\">\n      <ons-icon icon=\"bars\"></ons-icon>\n    </ons-toolbar-button>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n  Tratsch\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"right\" ng-click=\"openPostView();\">\n  <span class=\"toolbar-button--quiet navigation-bar__line-height\">\n      <ons-icon icon=\"ion-compose\" id=\"popshow\"></ons-icon>\n  </span>\n</div>\n\n\n```\nI have this in every single HTML-File (or a backbutton, when pushed somewhere)\nAnd again, I can confirm: wenn onsenui.css is inside, it breaks my row-position. Does not depend on the JS File\n. Ok, I can reprodue this bug right now. I have a Macbook. When I make a \"tab\" on my Touchpad, it will make this kind of double stuff. But when I really click the button with the mouse, this bug does not occur.\n. Watch out for the callout / opacity on the button. (cause video has no sound)\nAt the moment, you see the opacity beeing reduced, I did a real click, before, just tabbed on the touchpad.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsxUAy6ft0M&feature=youtu.be\nAnd this is the same behaviour on iPhone 6. When I make a short tab, it opens and closes. When I hold for more then 300ms-500ms, it works. Maybe it depens on that 300ms callout hack.\nEdit:\nand same on simulator. It depens how long I hold the click. After 300-500ms it works\n. Hi @argelius \nthank you very much! Bug is fixed. Works well!\nJust changed the /build/onsenui.js\nI'll not upgrade the CSS, since it breaks the align=\"center\" for me. Maybe it's caused due some uncompatible css-component (I've genereated on your website) \n. I disagree. Sliding (to close the menu) should work as it do right now, even when the menu is open.\nBut I do agree with the second argument of @eecsxielu \n. Ok @eecsxielu , now I understand. You're totally right. Slide down/up should be blocked, slide-left/slide-right should be able (and only propagating to close/open menu). You're right, sorry, just tried myself and scroll is still possible when the menu is open.\n. @argelius\nWhat about the scroll issue? No statement ?\n. Did you try\njavascript\n$scope.popover.hide(e);\n? It works. You could add something into prepush/postpush to call the .hide() function, but actually, it would be better if OnsenUI handle this case automatically. And you should use ng-click=\"\" instead of onclick=\"\".\n. @argelius \nThank you very much! \n. Steps:\nTabbar with content -> pushPage to an ons-list with multiple radios and checkboxes\n. This is an iOS bug. You can't really fix it. There a many ways (translateZ hack).\nIt happens with calculation width/height on input/textarea and with webkit-overflow touch.\nSo I'm closing this one here..\n. You can ignore this \"bug\". It's just an message inside of XCode, it does not break anything nor crash the app\n. Hi,\nthis is a duplicate of my bugreport. (posted yesterday)\nI have a bugfix proposal in my issue.\n326\n. Yes, you're right. But your screenshot contain both bugs. But I can't reproduce your case. Did you use iPhone 6 Simulator or a real device? \n@argelius \nI guess this needs to be reopened.\n. Of course there is one. Open (on iPhone) Settings, Safari, scroll to bottom -> advanced -> web inspector toggle on. Plugin your iPhone to your Mac, Open Safari, activate developer toolbar, you will find \"Simulator\" and \"Your Device Name\". Start debugging :)\n. Phonegap = Mobile Safari\nIt's even possible if you run a native app with a webView inside it (but only if it match with your provisioning profiles)\n. Are you sure that you have activated Web Inspector on your iPhone?\n. Ah damn, no, it's due to iOS 8. iOS 8 is designed to work with Yosemite. I'm sure you stuck on Mavericks. There is a workaround. Download a nighly build of Webkit.\nhttp://nightly.webkit.org/\n. Ok, this is really weird. Try to unplug and replug your device. I do not have any problems to debug my phonegap applications.\n. By the way: your app needs to be open and not in background.\n\n. No, Webinspector does not work with phonegap serve. Just run your app directly on your device, then it will be debuggable. Web-Inspector will not show webview that don't belong to you (as Phonegap Developer app has not your provisioning profiles included)\n. :+1: \n. imho top: -1px is an ugly way.\n. Maybe, if layout is not set to boxed layout (box-sizing: border-box) or any overflow: hidden setting is missing.\nI guess the x/y values of box-shadow should be improved to hide the top shadow\n. And here is a video to describe my problem:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vakQlS4Bol8\n. No way... I could reproduce the bug\nI've removed\nng-click=\"openTab(key);\"\nand\nng-show=\"isOpenTab(key)\"\n(so there is no accordion) and everything works as expected. Why???\n``` javascript\n    //check if the tab is active\n    $scope.isOpenTab = function (tab) {\n        //check if this tab is already in the activeTabs array\n        if ($scope.activeTabs.indexOf(tab) > -1) {\n            //if so, return true\n            return true;\n        } else {\n            //if not, return false\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    //function to 'open' a tab\n    $scope.openTab = function (tab) {\n        //check if tab is already open\n        if ($scope.isOpenTab(tab)) {\n\n            //if it is, remove it from the activeTabs array\n            $scope.activeTabs.splice($scope.activeTabs.indexOf(tab), 1);\n            $scope.scrollToPos(0);\n\n        } else {\n\n            //if it's not, add it!\n\n            $scope.activeTabs = []; // clear old entries, this force open tabs to close\n            $scope.activeTabs.push(tab);\n\n        }\n    }\n\n```\nSo Angular, Onsen or IOS is buggy to update radio which where hidden. (or: it updates radios they don't even belong to) So this is a AngularJS or iOS bug. As long one of my lists have a ng-hide, the model change won't be updated.\n. I've fixed the bug.\nAngular seems not to work fine with radios and ng-model. The internal \"names\" set trough angular are buggy. The first element has name=\"1122\" and the second \"1123\".. which is - imho - wrong and should be the same name for radios in the same group. I've fixed this problem by setting the name by myself.\n``` html\n    \n```\nname=\"r{{g.groupid}}\"\nThis did it for me - and works then even with hidden elements.\n. Yes, it is related to Angular, I've reported and they will fix it\n. Hi @masahirotanaka \nyou can't even imagine how much faster the site loads. AWESOME. Just the components are still very slow, as they still beeing served from JP servers. But frontpage and the documentation loads up much faster and the respondtime is better (22 routes before, 11 now, this is ok)\n:+1: \n:100: \n. I hope you do, as many people use them and Onsen is getting more popular here in europe. \n. @masahirotanaka \nJust to let you know:\nWithout CloudFront:\n\nWith CloudFront:\n\nWow.... I guess there is nothing more to say\n. Hi @masahirotanaka \nseems like the components are still loading very slow, are you sure all the small snippetboxes are set up to be served from the CDN?\n. Sorry you can't see it it is on the left and white. You Need to Open this Image on a dark background (in Photoshop)\n. This screenshot is more visible. The problem occurs only on iPhone 6 (Real device and simulator. Every other iOS device is fine. Please click the image to see it bigger)\n\n. Any update on this @argelius ?\n. Setting left to -1px in my component.css fixed it, but I don't know if I'm actually doing this right.\nI have to mention, that I'm still on 1.2.0 beta, I will upgrade now.\ncss\n.page__background {\n    background-color: #f3f3f3;\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0px;\n    left: -1px; <<<< here\n    right: 0px;\n    bottom: 0px;\n    -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;\n    -moz-box-sizing: border-box;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n. bug still present in 1.2.1, but when I set max-slide-distance to 86% instead of 85%, it works fine. Seems to be some math / subpixeling problem in safari.. I think the -1px hack is the best fix for that!\n. I would alos love to have this enhancement. But this should not be implemented as default, more as option. Currently, after tab changed, the last open tab will be destoryed in the dom (after change/animation fade is done). There should be a tab-navigator to switch between the pages instead of killing them. \nThanks!\n:+1: \n. I had the same problem. Managed to fix it with a workaround in my code.\n``` js\n        appNavigator.on('prepush', function(event) {\n        if($rootScope.isPushing) {\n            event.cancel();\n        }\n        $rootScope.isPushing = true;\n    });\n\n```\nand on postPush\njs\n        appNavigator.on('postpush', function(event) {\n            $rootScope.isPushing = false;\n        });\n. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n. Throwing a error on that fact is a bit hard, not? Same with page stack... \n. @argelius \nThis new setting is horrible. I have a factory which will check for some settings and do a pushPage / resetToPage when the controller inits. Now I'll receive an error which throws \"Can't push when push is not done\"... This is really UGLY and I don't want to use a timeout cause I want to prevent that the page being visible before. Please revert this!\nAt least provide some global config to disable this... And do not throw an error... this is too hard.\n. Hi @argelius,\nYes, this is exactly what I think. When someone need this, it's done with 2-3 lines of code (set a var, check postpush/prepush)\nMaybe you should consider to add a setting var for this (for the navigator, something like blockpushwhenpushing=\"true\") or something. I guess everybody would be happy with this.\n. @argelius don't you think you could create a directive for this? Then users could add it to the navigator (just for comfortable reason)\n. This bug is reported since August and also a PR. Its just 3-4 lines of code.\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/202\nhttps://github.com/Tincoboekestijn/OnsenUI/commit/0fefb125c7a900e96ab43db34288934a2ca470cb\nDon't know why this never got merged to core (because of the agreement I guess)\nThe commiter also closed his issue maybe due to long response time on this specific PR.\n. :+1: \n. change the border-color of your toolbar to be the same as the background color. Can be customized in the theme generator\n. Just generate a JSON-File with the settings or store the state in DB with an unique id. I miss this feature also.\n. You need to bind a touchmove event on carousel and stopPropagation(event);\nAnother way to achieve this would to set \nhtml\n<ons-page ng-controller=\"YourController\" sliding-menu-ignore=\"true\">\nJust as a workaround, till @argelius fixed this globally.\n. Weird, his directive actually does nothing else then my purposed workaround. Actually it should work (in theory). Will check this later.\n. If I use bricous directive, I receive:\nERROR: Error: undefined is not an object (evaluating '$scope.slidingMenu.setSwipeable')\nI can't manage to get ons-carousel to work in my app.. (at least at iOS 8)\n. Hi @argelius , @bricous \nhere is my Video. I've copied the stuff from the Guides... It won't work, event tried the directive... Wanted to add a \"swipe to delete\" function but right now, this seems not possible.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um_mQRAcWIw&feature=youtu.be\nindex.html\nhtml\n        <ons-sliding-menu menu-page=\"menu.html\" main-page=\"home2.html\" side=\"left\" type=\"push\" max-slide-distance=\"86%\" swipable=\"true\" swipe-target-width=\"100\" var=\"menu\">\n        </ons-sliding-menu>\n. Hi @bricous,\nthank you so much. This actually did the trick. Seems like I was blind. Changing to \"menu\" instead slidingMenu made it. Really nice. No I can start to implement a nice \"slide to delete\" feature in my chatroom-list.\n. And some other bugs:\nPlease fix source-code view and copying for firefox. See screenshot.\nYou can't even mark text without beeing cutted off. Only CMD+A + CMD+C works but looks very weird on Firefox.\n\nSafari/Chrome is fine.\n. Hi @argelius,\nI know there are a lot of slideshows outthere which will cover my needs (e.g. slick) but since you guys have added some nice carousel into onsen out of the box, I would like to recommend some more important features.\n- support for default easings\n- easing speed\n- auto play feature\n- start delay\n- animation delay\n- pause function\n- loop (with restart from 1 and infinite)\n. Hi @argelius,\nDelay/animation is related to auto-play - yes. If you drop this request, it is of course not important. And you're right, building a directive for an automatic slideshow is indeed very easy, this is why I suggested to add this as core feature. (detecting destory(), stopping interval, freeing memory etc).\nMost important is auto-scroll ratio (the snap ratio) and preloading / image on demand based on an data-lazy tag, e.g lazyloading and of course the bugfixes with sliding menu etc.\n. Actually there is, @argelius \nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/c9ea2f32d6087c0bb62c044877327f47621af2ff/framework/directives/scroller.js#L24\nAnd it seems to work, at least for iOS. But the features aren't that good, I'm using http://lorenzofox3.github.io/lrInfiniteScroll/index.html#example now.\n. No I need to load data from remote (like the facebook timeline)\nWorks now, but not with onsens infinite scroll feature\n. Small correction: they've changed the name-convention. ios-7 buttons aren't not available anymore. My backbutton is gone.\nion-ios7-arrow-back \nchanged now to:\nion-ios-arrow-back\nJust changed the back-button template to ion-ios-arrow-back - everything works fine now.\n. And warning: they have removed the animated spinner icons. Can use it with spin=\"true\"but this will only work for ons-icon directive..\n. @argelius really? I don't face this problem. Maybe cause I used animation : \"none\" ? Just to mention.\n. And what about that bug? Did you fix this?\n. @argelius what about the display glitch?\n. Hi @argelius,\ni've searched around a bit and found out how to achieve this.\nI just removed \nhtml\n<ons-page>\ninside my my \"neighbor.html\" (which is one of my tab-pages) and wrapped \nhtml\n<ons-navigator var=\"inside\">\naround it. In my controller, instead of using the main navigator (with var appNavigator), I use \njavascript\ninside.pushPage();\nIt just works, when my opening page has an <ons-page> inside of it but still seems to break some controller code (need to figure out what).\nBut now, every 1-3 times, I have a very ugly blink bug. Do you have any quick workaround or am I'm doing something wrong?\nJust to mention, that my main Navigator is only present for just a second when I start the app.\nIt's not inside of my index.html, but I have a home2.html, which initis onload and directly resetToPage to home.html (just did that nasty stuff because I did not know how to do this stuff right in the beginning of my PhoneGap App.. now I would do that of course much smarter. I'm just telling you that to be sure I have mentioned all related stuff to reproduce this bug.\n<ons-navigator title=\"Navigator\" var=\"appNavigator\">\nTo cut the long story short, I don't think that this blink-bug is caused trough the way I've created the inital Navigator, I guess there is something else playing bad with me.\nHere is the bug. And no, it's not me on that video :D\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In6PAyYCJNI&feature=youtu.be\n. This will be very hard I guess. There is a lot of logic and stuff related, JSON calls to the server etc. \nI don't know if this could help, but we could make an appointment, where you could connect to my Mac trough team viewer? \n. But as I have this blink bug even somewhere else i'm quite sure it is related to ons-list. Cause in my other page which gets pushed even also without the second navigator, it blink. I'm trying to verify that and will update later. Merry Christmas by the way (if you celebrate)\n. Hi @argelius,\nso I did some more investigations.\n- Removed the mainController -> nothing changed\n- Removed the ons-list and ons-rows from the calling page -> nothing changed\n- Removed ons-page and wrapped with a div ng-controller instead -> nothing changed\n- Even called an empty page -> still blink bug\nThe bug only occurs with animation: slide. If I use animation: fade, it does not flicker, but thats not an option here.\nIf I do this pushPage in my main navigator, I do not have this blink bug, the profile page just loads fine, but without the tab-bar...\nMaybe related with #301 (which was fixed and worked for me) and #210 and #228\nThis seems to be always a very similar kind of bug..\n. Thanks for your response @argelius,\nyes, we also celebreated yesterday, so, belated christmas wishes :)\nThanks for your effort. \n. Hi @argelius,\nany update? \n. Could you share your CDs modifications with me? Thanks\n. It is correct but when I enable again ngclick does not work \n. iOS \n. To be honest, just tried on the simulator.\nI did something like this\nhtml\n<ons-button ng-click=\"myFunction()\" var=\"myButton\" disabled=\"true\">Button</ons-button>\njavascript\nif(condition) {\n   myButton.setDisabled(false);\n}\nThe disabled styles gets removed but when I click/touch the button, nothing happens. (like it ignores the pointer-events)\nSeems to be some focus problem, cause when I touch around a bit, it works (sometimes) - could not reproduce this 100%. Maybe the disabled button need some \"redraw\" hacks..\n. By the way. It was a button in the topbar / toolbar (maybe this produce the problem?)\n. Hi @argelius ,\ncss\n.navigation-bar {\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\nfixed the issue (on iOS, did not try android but I will) with the disappearing topbar and search input. Default is set to overflow:visible in the theme.css. (don't know why??)\nBut still, the border disappears. I can't find a fix for that. \n. Alright, even found out why the border is disappearing.\ncss\n.page__content\u00a0{\n    ..\n    ..\n    margin-top: -1px;\n}\nthis caused the problem (again, inside my theme.css I generated on onsen.io)\nChanging margin-top to 0, fixed it @argelius \n. You could write your own AnimationFactory for that.\n. I guess he means swipe-left should popPage and swipe-right should bring the last view (at least swipe-right isn't possible with onsen, as popPage() will destory the last view\n. #243 \n. @khoshrou \nwould you be so kind to publish your code when you've done that? :)\nKheyli mamnun :)\n. Hi @ConcurrentHashMap,\nyour guess is correct. You need to trigger history,pushState / popState by yourself. Please do yourself a favor and don't write this on your own. There are ton of plugins outhere with good support for all browsers and even old browsers with hash or hash-bang support (# and #!).\nBut you're wrong, there are native functions to listen for the backbutton. There is onstatechange or onanchorchange (polyfill for hashChanged listener).\nYou can do everything with: https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/\nWith a little effort you should not take longer then 1-2 hours! And even this repo is \"beta\", I've used it a hundred times in full-ajax-projects and it works very well.\n. :+1: \nglad I could help\n. @argelius \njust to mention, I've even tried with !important for opacity, but then it's more worse as it get's removed when the animation is over.\n. :) :+1: \nI've learned a lot since september. Thought I will finish after 1-1,5 monts, but as you can see, I was totally wrong :D. But yes, maybe we should :)\n. Ha... @eecsxielu \nyou should have asked me before. I did face the same problem sometimes. Just used a <ons-scroller class=\"something> and set the height of .somethinginside of my controller to window.height - ons-toolbar-height(and also -tabbar when you have one)\nThis is indeed not so nice, but you could put this into a directive and add it to your scroller-div\n``` js\nvar wHeight = ($(window).height()  - $('ons-toolbar').height());\n$('.yourElement').height(wHeight);\n```\nAlso, setting it to height 100% via CSS should also work in most of the cases. But when you have some bottom fixed elements, you will need the jQuery way, and also -fixedElementHeight\n. Hi,\nheight: 101% will do the trick.\n. But actually I don't know how to manage this without that sort of \"hack\".\nYou can just set the whole webview overscroll inside the plist - but who wants this.\nI guess the only method is mine - or a bigger innerContainer height / height 100 + padding-bottom\n. Had the bug on iOS 8 (device) + simulator\n. Just to give some more informations:\nHade the <ons-modal>directly after <ons-page>and activated after a ng-click\n. What? :D\niOS Simulator is up in 10 seconds, Android takes (even with Intel Hax) over 3 minutes (on my 2,7 i7 Quad Core MacBook Pro Retina with SSD and 16GB RAM)\n. Ok :D \n:+1: \nGlad you found the bug. \n. :+1: \nWould also make code more readable and cleaner - too many ng-clicks just to push a page..\n. Actually, native would be scrollToTop when touching the clock, not the toolbar.\nAs Onsen determines the native statusbar by itself and also provide a spacer for it, a spacer tap should scroll-to-top - not the toolbar. (at least on iOS, this is not an Android UX part)\n. Just to mention @Wouter33,\nI know the plugin statusTap and it does not work with iOS8\n. To everybody: it has finally landed officially to the status bar plugin \nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar/blob/master/README.md\nStatusBarDefaultScrollTop\n. @argelius this can be closed . Seems this PR is just usable for list-items, not for normal content. That's a bit sad.\nMaybe you could have a small look on this:\nhttps://github.com/lorenzofox3/lrInfiniteScroll\nI've managed to get this work very well inside of OnsenUI\n. What about deprecation-time? I've used ons.navigator 1-2 times \n. @argelius  This PR broke my complete app.. I know it is not so \"nice\", but sometimes, if I did changes on page 2, I want to do something on page 1 (e.g. on popPage) or I've listened to the resume event (and I don't want to add this 100 times in my controllers)\n```\n$rootScope.reinitController = function() {\n    ons.page._scope.init();\n}\ndocument.addEventListener(\"resume\", $rootScope.reinitController, false);\n```\nI don't know how to access this right now..\n. And you know what... it was such a big big big help when developing and testing inside of safari inspector. To get $scope vars, look for functions and make quick tests. My heart is bleeding you've removed it.. I really need a new way to access these things\n. This is the real dirty way right now:\nangular.element($('ons-page:last')).scope().init();\n. Seems like it does not get inited...\n\nAt least something happen.. they get \"width:100%\" attribute..\n. I'm using the last version where you fixed the sliding menu issues\n. Hi @argelius ,\nthanks, auto-refresh fixed it. Actually I don't know why this is import (imho this should be done automatically) but at least for now, this fixed my problems :)\nThanks as always!\n:+1: \n. There is also something I really don't like: specifiying item-width.\nI've already specified in the css... You should be able to get the right values out of css / computed styles.\nBut what I've specified in the CSS does not work. It gets overwritten with width: 100% and height: 100%\n. And I can't understand, why the elements why ons-carousel-item get's position absolute. This makes it impossible for the use of display: inline-block;\nAnd when I do it like in your demo (display: table), as soon as I swipe, the whole slideshow get's centered. Just look at your own demo folder (example 3)\nEdit:\nif I specity item-width, display: inline-block works\n. and item-width should also understand integer values (50) and not only \"50px\"\nsorry for spam, just writing down everything that seems messy to me\n. can't specify margin-right or margin-left due to position absolute on ons-item\n\n. @argelius \nafter hours of trial and error I've managed to get this work with a lot of tricks and hacks (making item-width larger as it should be and just making the image smaller to get a \"workaround\" for that non-working margin)\nBut there are still bugs and actually, the carousel is far away from beeing stable. Just managed to get this work right with the \"noslidingmenu\" directive hack also.. before, nothing happened as I had disabled sliding menu in \"page\"\nBut when there are few elements, the carousel will always ( and also in your demo) be right aligened after swipe-right) (guess this has something to do with overscrollable)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9pQSMokUi0\nedit: without overscrollable it just do the same bug without elastic. it just change its position. When there are enough elements, it works well\n. @argelius \nand I cant scroll vertical... the carousel blocks it. Damn :D\nShould have stick with slick-slider ;D\nEdit:\nIntegrated #380 manually, it fixed the problem, but there is still this behaviour, when there are less items:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQsqUTvTg8E\nWow... thats a lot of spam by me :D\nSorry, I'm an intensive tester\n. I can confirmed that the \"small carousel\" issue has been fixed.\n. Hi @argelius,\nno, it's not possible at the moment (the maps plugin inside of it is not compatible)\nBut I've managed out what caused this bug. As soon as one element has translate3d() or translateZ, it won't stay at it's position anymore when I scroll. I've added this styles by myself to some animated elemets) I don't know if this is caused trough onsen or ons-row, but it guess I have to detect the android version now and remove accelareted support on my elements for versions < 4.4.\nMaybe you can figure out if this is caused trough Onsen or not. I guess this bug could and would also occur on Emulator. But maybe it's caused trough Cyanogenmod\n. hi @argelius ,\nbug also occurs when just setting the backface-visibility on that device.\nThe only chance I had right now was to detect device version with cordove device plugin and add a class to html. This workaround fixed all my problems.\ncss\n.isBadAndroid SELECTOR {\n  -webkit-backface-visibility: visible;\n  backface-visibility: visible;\n  -webkit-transform: none;\n  transform: none;\n}\n. Damn.. but I have to remove ons-carousel, since it also sets transform. This is really bad. When I scroll and ons-carousel is inside, the bug will still be present...\n. @argelius \nHAH!\nIt seems like every element positioned relative AFTER an element which has translate or backface-visbility set, will cause this error. removed everything and added (in my case, the list caused the problem)\ncss\n.isBadAndroid .list__item {\n  position: static !important;\n}\nAnd voila - bug is gone. Same for ons-row \n. Hi @argelius,\nmy \"bugfixes\" worked but it did not prevent the carousel from scrolling itself. Just all the other elemets. I don't have any good workaround, I need to try a real 4.3.1 device, I think this crazy bug comes trough cyanogenmod.\n. Since I changed to crosswalk, I'm fine now! I recommend everybody to integrate crosswalk to Cordova \n. and it seems like you've missed to add box-align(non-vendor-prefix)\n. Hi,\ntext-align: center could work, the problem was inherit\nI'll try it\n. Confirmed:\ntext-align: center;\nbox-align: center;\ninstead of\ntext-align: inherit;\nwork!\n. Hi @argelius \ncurrent 1.2.2-beta still includes \ntext-align: inherit, which will cause the elements will be left positioned, as the default alignment is left.\nYou need to remove text-align:inhert or set it to text-align:center\n. Imho this is an unnecessary burden - as it worked as expected before the update. I'll patch it for myself.\n. Here we go. Text inside of video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A0DXaf_IQg\n. Hi @argelius,\nI'll try it and I will try to make an example for you that fails. Your examples look great, wish it would work like that for me.\nI think that click events or other events infront of the <ons-page> cause this drag issues, but I'm not sure\n. Hi @argelius,\nif you ask me, the dialog is useless when it creates an isolated scope. You could handle this like other directives do, and pass an \"mother\" or \"parent\" to it, that could be accessed via mother.scopefunction or parent.scopefunction\n. @argelius \nI'm sure you know it, but maybe this is a good point:\nhttp://angular-tips.com/blog/2014/03/transclusion-and-scopes/\n. I tried to modify the directive but I guess it won't work like I guessed (because of createDialog)\nCurrently, I've created a <ons-template>\n``` html\n    \n\n      <ons-toolbar inline>\n        <div class=\"center\">\n          Login\n        </div>\n      </ons-toolbar>\n\n      <p>\n        <input placeholder=\"Username\" id=\"username\" class=\"text-input\">\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        <input type=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" id=\"username\" class=\"text-input\">\n      </p>\n\n\n      <p>\n        <ons-button modifier=\"large\" ng-click=\"loginToFacebook();\">\n            {{'LOGIN_WITH_FACEBOOK' | translate}}\n        </ons-button>\n      </p>\n\n  </ons-dialog> \n</ons-template>\n\n```\n. I considered it. As of the starting, I wasn't so familiar with angular and did many things \"not the angular way\", but my timeline is very small right now - so I don't have time to refactor everything.\nGuess I need to move the code into a new controller if you don't know any fast way to make ng-click (for parent elements) available on buttons inside of that dialog.\n. Indeed, not nice... but I've already did some ugly stuff.. maybe this is ok :D \nBut I guess it is not that hard to move my controller code. But I still feel, that this is an \"error\".\nThe dialog need to have access to the creating page. This is my understanding of real usage. I don't think that this current behaviour is good as it complicates stuff. Currently, it is easier to create my own dialog instead of relying to the existing one.\n. Maybe a parameter? Default isolated scope, with param the creating controller scope?\n. \nHoly shrimp. Really? I just copied your example\n$scope.show = function(dlg) {\n            ons.createDialog(dlg).then(function(dialog) {\n                dialog.show();\n            });\n        };\nbut it really creates an dialog every call? Not nice. Thought there is an internal check if the dialog already exist\n. used your example on #383 for popover to fix this but \n$scope.$on('$destroy', $scope.loginDialog.destroy);\nends in \nTypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating '$scope.loginDialog.destroy')\nHow can I destory it? Sorry, I spam so much... I know :(\n. Yes, here is your example:\nhttp://onsen.io/guide/components.html#ons-dialog\nSee the JS (I don't know if you did that example, but it is in the documentations page)\n. Thought this is a timing issue caused trough the promise, moved it inside of createDialog but destroy won't fire / destroy\n. If I call destroy() trough the var-name dialog.destroy() in safari webinspector, it works, but I can't register it on destroy\n. Wrapped everything inside a service now. I guess, this is the most clean solution and I guess you're right, everything else is a mess.\nStill, destroy() don't work as I showed you in my example. But when I call it trough the global var, it works. But I call var.destory() on login now, so this is ok for me.\n. Ok, fade and slide is available as I can see inside of the code.\nEdit:\nit's there but not everything works correct (seems like fade call slideup)\n. And another suggestions:\npassing own easing properties instead of creating an own AnimationFactory\nDuration, and easing type (dialog with 0.3 duration is to fast for me and I like to have a cubic-bezier instead of ease-in-out.)\n. Documentation say:\nAnimation: none or default\nCode says:\ndefault -> will call slide up\nfade -> will call slide up\nslide (not documented) but will call slide down\nnone -> no animation\nBut I would suggest to increase the default animation time. 0.3 is to short\n. It would be nice if we could use animate.css classes for that.\n. And when I have two <ons-template id=\"name1.html\"> and <ons-template id=\"two.html\">\nit will always fail with the second:\nFailed to load resource: The requested URL was not found on this server.\nBut when I have one inside of templates as a static file and one in my template als ons-template, it works... silly bugs. \n. Hi @argelius,\nThe second one seem to happen only with createDialog. Ng repeat with template does not fail. The only way for me was to mix between static template and inline template (to generate two dialogs). Weird, as your example contains three without problem.\n. I'm not in the office right know, could try to confirm this in a couple of hours. \n. I can confirm the same issue @argelius \n<ons-template>\ncause issues when there are multiple defined.\n. My project is also very complex, I don't really know how to help you to fix this.\nI could give you access to my Mac trough TeamViewer if you want to check this here.\n. This is the biggest problem on phonegap development. You need to install the Ionic Keyboard Plugin \nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugins-keyboard\nand call\ncordova.plugins.Keyboard.disableScroll(true);\n. No, it won't work (as far as I could try)\nI used the native.keyboardShow and the keyboardHeight value, added the height value to my container (currentHeight + keyboardHeight as min-height) and scrolled this one up. This worked then for me.\nRemember to remove the keyboardHeight on native.keyboardHide\n. Learning by doing :)\nAnd I'm out of the office now \nVon meinem iPhone gesendet\n\nAm 19.02.2015 um 18:58 schrieb mmok1234 notifications@github.com:\nCan you give me a sample code about you case? (currentHeight + keyboardHeight......etc)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. When the height change would be animated it would be very nice. A fixed height is not that cool right now\n. Progress on this? Important one.. @argelius \n. http://stackoverflow.com/a/25757310/3297914\nhttp://mydevice.io/devices/\n\nactually it is 2.6, it rounds up to 3, but check that SO answer, I makes everything clear.\n. Are you in zoomed mode on your iPhone 6 plus? This would cause the wrong ratios. And be sure you've set the meta tag no scalable and initial width etc\n. I've have running onsen on iPhone 6 plus, everything looks great. Be sure to check that you are not in zoomed mode and you have set correct meta tags. Be careful: if you do not provide correct splash screens and app icons inside of your config.xml, iPhone 6 plus support won't be applied on build (by iOS). iPhone 6 plus support was added with Cordova 3.6.3 and up\n. What about your config.xml? Remember, when you don't provide @3 dpi icons for iPhone, the plus 6 support won't get applied\n. Do you have a fast fix for this?\n. Actually, on crosswalk, this is a bug, not an enhancement. But you're welcome. (not on simulator, but real device)\n. +1\n. Can't wait to see this been fixed\n. Will that be also inside of the 1.3 version!\n. ?\n. :+1: \n. @argelius just want to send out a small reminder... I'm waiting so badly for this feature.\nhttps://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/master/js/angular/directive/keyboardAttach.js#L1\nIt should not be so much work.. Of course it would need some keyboard listeners and Onsen adjustments.\n. I can confirm, S6 Edge Push is very choppy\n. Seems like formatTime() was causing the huge performance loss. After I've removed it (I format it on the server right now) it is 100 times better, but still, not the \"native\" feeling. Especially when I sroll slowly. @argelius \n. After the changes, my Galaxy S6 Edge is perfectly fast. It just don't feel that good on iOS. I hope you guys have some recommendations how to optimize this hole thing. I've also changed my code a bit\n``` js\n$scope.item = {};\n    $scope.MyDelegate = {\n\n\n        configureItemScope: function(index, itemScope) {\n\n            //console.log(itemScope);\n\n            itemScope.item = $scope.photos.items[index];\n            /*\n            itemScope.item.uid = person.uid;\n            itemScope.item.firstname = person.firstname;\n            itemScope.item.picture = person.picture;\n            itemScope.item.lastactivity = person.last_activity;\n            */\n\n        },\n\n        calculateItemHeight: function(index) {\n            return 91;\n        },\n\n        countItems: function() {\n            return $scope.photos.items.length;\n        },\n\n        destroyItemScope: function(index, itemScope) {\n            /*\n            itemScope.canceler.resolve();\n            console.log(\"Destroyed item #\" + index);\n            */\n        }\n    };\n\n```\n. @argelius \nthe ons-lazy-repeat needs  debouncing, or it will never be really performant (due to UIWebViews limitation and throttled scroll-event-publishing). This behaviour will be better once WkWebView works on iOS 8+ cordova.\nI've patched the Lazy directive and I have a 100% performance boost now.\n``` js\n      _debounce: function(func, wait, immediate) {\n        var timeout;\n        return function() {\n            var context = this, args = arguments;\n            var later = function() {\n                timeout = null;\n                if (!immediate) func.apply(context, args);\n            };\n            var callNow = immediate && !timeout;\n            clearTimeout(timeout);\n            timeout = setTimeout(later, wait);\n            if (callNow) func.apply(context, args);\n        }\n       },\n       _doubleFireOnTouchend: function(){\n            this._render();\n            this._debounce(this._render.bind(this), 100);\n       },\n  _addEventListeners: function() {\n    this._boundOnChange = this._debounce(this._onChange.bind(this), 30);\n\n    this._pageContent.addEventListener('touchmove', this._boundOnChange, true);\n    this._pageContent.addEventListener('scroll', this._boundOnChange, true);\n    this._pageContent.addEventListener('touchend', this._doubleFireOnTouchend, true);\n\n\n    $document[0].addEventListener('resize', this._boundOnChange, true);\n  },\n\n  _removeEventListeners: function() {\n    this._pageContent.removeEventListener('scroll', this._boundOnChange, true);\n    this._pageContent.removeEventListener('touchmove', this._boundOnChange, true);\n    this._pageContent.removeEventListener('touchend', this._doubleFireOnTouchend, true);\n\n\n    $document[0].removeEventListener('resize', this._boundOnChange, true);\n  },\n\n```\nIt does not break anything - it just works 100% better than before. You can't recalculate so many elements without strugglin on performance. If I've a long list and do a really really fast scroll, it can happen that the elements will be rendered after the scroll event has finished. I tried to eliminate with a \"doubleFireOnTouch\" but it don't work always. But the problem was there also before I've patched (but due to stutter on scroll less visible)\nNontheless, adding 30ms of debouncing will give \na) memory boost\nb) performance boost\nc) will not break current flow\nFeel free to optimize my suggestions - but please - consider adding a debouncer. \nEdit:\nMy patch will change the behaviour on android (it's more worse now). Before the patch (I'm on crosswalk), lazy repeat was perfect on android. So I guess it should be good to add a device check around it.\nI've changed it to\n``` js\n      _addEventListeners: function() {\n    if(ons.platform.isIOS()) {\n\n        this._boundOnChange = this._debounce(this._onChange.bind(this), 30);\n    } else {\n\n        this._boundOnChange = this._onChange.bind(this);\n    }\n\n    this._pageContent.addEventListener('scroll', this._boundOnChange, true);\n\n    if(ons.platform.isIOS()) {\n        this._pageContent.addEventListener('touchmove', this._boundOnChange, true);\n        this._pageContent.addEventListener('touchend', this._doubleFireOnTouchend, true);\n    }\n\n\n\n    $document[0].addEventListener('resize', this._boundOnChange, true);\n  },\n\n  _removeEventListeners: function() {\n    this._pageContent.removeEventListener('scroll', this._boundOnChange, true);\n\n    if(ons.platform.isIOS()) {\n        this._pageContent.removeEventListener('touchmove', this._boundOnChange, true);\n        this._pageContent.removeEventListener('touchend', this._doubleFireOnTouchend, true);\n    }\n\n    $document[0].removeEventListener('resize', this._boundOnChange, true);\n  },\n\n```\n. Hi @argelius,\nthank you. One hint: my \"deviceIsIOS\" call does not work. How to determine the device inside of Lazy?\n. Ok. I think Onsen should consider to use the device-plugin (when installed) to prevent user agent fakes.\n. Ok, changed code above. This is just a way of optimizing. Try to load an json with 1-2k of data (remote) and incoporate my fixes. Maybe you find a way to prevent \"white screen till scroll is finished\". I've seens some patches even for FastClick which looks like to be the same. But debouncing is imporant. Thanks for answering! (maybe also for android, S6 is something really fast, older devices will stuck - and the non-crosswalk for sure)\n. Yes, this is exactly what I mean. This changed in WKWebview (scroll events fire in realtime).\nDue to apples bug on WKWebView, it isn't possible to run it currently on iOS. But the bug also occurs on Android sometimes.\nBy the way:\nBefore optimize: (didn't capture the BAD LAG when I was scrolling slow, it was really bad)\nhttps://youtu.be/CcClaDEhSew\nAfter: optimize: (see the white screen bug on fast scroll)\nhttp://youtu.be/SS8OQwutFgI\nBut it only happen when I scroll like an idiot (normal users will not I guess)\n. :+1: I'm going to bed right now! Thanks a lot.\n. @argelius\nI think i have an idea.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/6EYxz/\nWe could hack a little bit. On touchend (with a little Delay) a inertial/Momentum scroll stop. Maybe not beautiful but a solid woraround based on native scrolling. Or iScroll 5. But with that hack we could prevent long white screen durations (we could add the overflow hidden hack, check if there is more space for scroll, and trigger a fake (scrollOut) immediately after stopping (to prevent hard stops).\nWhat you think ?\n. See #858\nJust updated fastclick.js to 1.0.6 - it will fix all problems\n. @andipavllo this is not true. You'll have to update fastclick-lib to 1.0.6 - or it will have massive problems with Onsen.\n. @argelius I can confirm fastclick 1.0.6 will fix the issues. Please update als soon as possible\n. seemed to be fixed in 1.3.8, I'm on an older version currently.\n. There is no real fix for this - but this warning does not harm your application. It happens due to overflow-scroll:touch (when you have two elements with that property)\nyou can ignore this one\n. As said, you can just ignore this. It's not OnsenUI causing this. It happens also to other Frameworks.\n. same flickering when having tabbar with own navigator. as soon as there are nested ons-pages, it will flicker. This is why I still have never implemented a second navigator (I lose my tab-bar on pushPage, I would love to keep it, but played around more than 10 hours to fix the flickerin.) no chance..\n. seems obvious +1\n. In my case, sometimes it just down even apply the right height and my elements are behind the Navigation-bar. But just on the iOS simulator\n. and also on Device, it is related to iOS 9 (my device worked cause it was on iOS 8, iOS 9 started being buggy)\n. Hi @c58 @argelius \nthis is related to #950\nPlease just apply (as a workaround) the suggested fix from argelius. It also fixed it for me.\n. Should be closed as the real problem was only broken tilde selector in iOS 9\n. ng-if also breaks / makes problem when used with toolbar buttons (like menu/ons-back-button)\nAlso managed to use it with ng-show instead of ng-if\n. I did something similar, and the benefits are huge. +1\n. The performance is generally poor on android. Even on Crosswalk, no matter if I use an old or new device. I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and pushPage with slide animation is so sluggish, but there are several bug reports about the animation performance..\n. @argelius  I can confirm this and it's related to some of my reported problems on ons-pull-hook. The vigorously shaking is only reproducible on a device, not inside the simulator.\nJust make a big list and drag slowly, do not scroll fast. It will shake up and down.\nAlso, scroll fast, and try to give your momentum scroll / inertal some more speed, as soon as you touch the screen, it will jump to the last starting positing and will return back immediately.\nPerformance is also very poor when the list is big. It's not usable actually. I've integrated something by myself now (based on -px scroll values) - will only work on iOS but won't require transform or any drag events.. This should be improved.\n. #897 could be related @argelius (I've also seen this effect from time to time, but in my case, the \"push\" won't even fire delayed anymore)\n. @anatoo @argelius iOS 9 has a broken tilde (~) selector, which will cause a lot of problems\n.page__status-bar-fill ~ ons-toolbar\n.page__status-bar-fill ~ ons-toolbar ~ .page__content\nthis cause some problems like this. After I change just one attribute in safari, it will redraw. We need an urgent fix for this. Ionic had fixes for iOS 9 out where it was still in beta...\n\nas you can see, my content is under the status bar. Error won't happen on iOS 8.\n. Hi @argelius ,\nyes, the bug is fixed. Wish you had wrote me 30 minutes before, now I've pushed a buggy app to the appstore (with expedited review). Haha..\n. :+1: - no problem. At least the bug is fixed, you should change every single ~ selector. It just don't work as expected on iOS9. @argelius \nThanks for your help!\n. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/paperfold-css/launch\nWow, even with drag/touch support\nhttp://oridomi.com/\n. Exactly @argelius. \n. @argelius \n. @andipavllo yes this is important. Just checked Chrome and Safari, same bug there!\n. Confirmed. It is fixed. By the way, it was broken at least for 1-2 months.\n. I got it. @andipavllo @argelius  - this is for sure a bug.\nPostchange will trigger, but the index keys are wrong, thats why I could not call my code.\nWhen I change to \n- gossip.html, getActiveTabIndex() is 1 (correct)\n- when I change to neighbors.html, getActiveTabIndex() is 1 (wrong, should be 2)\n- when I change to chatrooms.html, index is 3 (correct)\n- I change back to neighbors.html, index is 2 (correct)\n- I change to match.html, index is 0 (correct)\n- I change back to neighbors.html, index is 0 (wrong, should be 2)\nand so on...\nSo, persistent=\"true\" will cause that the index won't update correctly.\nAny fast fix for this? Before I used the persistent, everything worked correct.\n. Alright.. it's a timing issue. Seems like postchange will fire too fast when persistent flag is set. Adding a $timeout will help (quick and dirty). You need to investigate please\n. 1.3.11, iOS 9\n. As said, wrapping around inside of an $timeout (with 0 second), it work. Seems like some $digest did not apply correctly.\n. I used iOS simulator and iPhone 6 (both on iOS9)\nDid you set the persistent-flags like I described? \n. My app is very complex, building an example is not that easy.\nI don't think that you will have this timing issue on chrome, maybe it's hardware related\n. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n. @andipavllo shall I open another ticket for the sliding-menu issue?\n. But you closed #449 which was not related to the documentation\n. Well, it should. For me, it will jitter and flicker as soon as I set this element.\n. @andipavllo yeah your code is broken.\nYou have\nhtml\nsliding-menu-ignore\"true\"\nwhile it should be\nhtml\nsliding-menu-ignore=\"true\"\nYou're missing the =\nWell, it's logical:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/1cf3346f54d97bd46ef7bedb099a66f87c795593\nThe gesture event will be canceled. Some additional checks need to be added in this case.\n. I just checked it inside of your codepen, the error is reproducible.\n. also see #969 \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR6a1NMoGME&feature=youtu.be\n. Just had a look at the source.\nFor now, adding \n``` js\n      _onDone: function(done) {\n        // Check if the pull hook still exists.\n        if (this._element) {\n          this._translateTo(0, {animate: true});\n          this._setState(this.STATE_INITIAL);\n      setTimeout(function(){\n        this._scrollElement.removeAttr('style')\n      }.bind(this), 310);\n    }\n  },\n\n```\nthe timeout to the _done function will work well and seem to be safe. This should be incorporated into core.\n. @andipavllo @argelius also see #968 \nby the way, it also should not add any styles on scroll. It's just not necessary. Only when detected for the pull-hook\n. another bug, related to this one. Since ons-pull-hook applys css while scrolling, I can't scroll fast up and down, as soon as my finger touches the element, it will jump around... this is nasty :(\n. @andipavllo I don't want to sound demanding, but actually I'm taking care of some open source projects and have to finish this annoying app :D \nIt's quite difficult. I will provide code and fixes as much as I can, but I'm quite busy currently. Will try to look at it.\n. Just had a look at the source.\n@argelius @andipavllo \nFixing style _onDone()\nFor now, adding \n``` js\n      _onDone: function(done) {\n        // Check if the pull hook still exists.\n        if (this._element) {\n          this._translateTo(0, {animate: true});\n          this._setState(this.STATE_INITIAL);\n      // we could also consider listening to a webkitTransitionEnd\n      setTimeout(function(){\n        this._scrollElement.removeAttr('style')\n      }.bind(this), 310);\n    }\n  },\n\n```\nthe timeout inside the _onDone() function will work fine for resetting styles at the end of animation.\nConcept\nConceptional, ons-pull-hook is not final nor really production ready. It should be changed to following, as anything else doesn't make sense and will have negative side-effects.\n- only add CSS to this._scrollElement when scroll > 0. Don't add any rule when view is in normal use. _onDone() timeout will also make sure, that the styles are removed after legit css-style-apply.\n- _onDone() need to reset the style attribute added to _scrollElement (see code above)\n- scroll < 0 should not interrupt touch/scroll event. Let it be native, don't block it, overscroll is welcome at the end of the list (_onDrag()). Blocking cause jittering.\n- do not apply any style to _scrollElement on normal drag/scroll when moving down. Only call _translateTo when scroll is > 0\n. @andipavllo I've also seen another bug. When I scroll down rapidly (and let the inertial scroll a bit) and want to give it some more speed, as soon as I touch the screen, it jumps up and back (you will see elements which were already overscrolled - I think it's related to fastclick or something in this case), as fastclick won't update it's last known click position while inertial is running. Won't happen on Simulator, but at device.\nAnd when I scroll slow (just dragging a bit down) it's jittering awful on iOS\n. yes, but's related to this one, that's why I wrote this down here\n. @argelius I will check that, but I guess that this won't fix the jittering problems. I will open another issuse when other errors come up\n. This is fixed in 1.3.11 - just update.\nThe main cause for this error is iOS 9 broken css selector ~ \n. @argelius I forgot to mention that material-refresh will also work for iOS (but it's buggy) and should not be used. Just add a check if iOS (use md-directive style) or Android for material. These are just suggestions, hope you will consider to make that hole thing more performant.\nFor android, there is also a PR which removes all Zepto/jQuery dependencies. Vanilla js, MIT License. Perfect..\nhttps://github.com/lightningtgc/material-refresh/pull/7\n. @argelius sounds really good!\n. I'm not sure what this line does\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/f0c87264c5bcd38100e1d600ef414e66a3cb3907/framework/directives/keyboard.js#L81\nbut it looks to me like you actually want to remove the listener. So it's a bug?\n. For now, I've managed to fix it like this:\n``` js\n        $scope.initKeyboardActions = function() {\n        if(device.platform.toLowerCase() == 'android') {\n            var handler = function() {\n                $('.ons-page-inner:last').scrollTop($(document.activeElement).offset().top);\n            };\n\n            ons.softwareKeyboard.on('show', handler);\n            $scope.$on(\"$destroy\", function() {\n                ons.softwareKeyboard.off('show', handler);\n            });\n        }\n    };\n\n```\n. Here the proof\nhttps://youtu.be/BRodICol7qQ\n. Finally figuered out why all the problems appear. It's because of ng-hide/ng-show. Since the new devices are too fast, the rendering won't be applied at perfect time. I had some ng-hide stuff on that toolbar buttons.\nhtml\n        <div class=\"left\">\n            <ons-back-button ng-show=\"!menucall\"></ons-back-button>\n            <ons-toolbar-button ng-click=\"menu.toggleMenu();\" ng-show=\"menucall\">\n                <ons-icon icon=\"bars\"></ons-icon>\n            </ons-toolbar-button>\n        </div>\nI've added following CSS\ncss\n[translate\\:cloak], [translate-cloak], [ng\\:cloak], [ng-cloak], [data-ng-cloak], [x-ng-cloak], .ng-cloak, .x-ng-cloak, .ng-hide:not(.ng-hide-animate) {\n  display: none !important;\n}\nand I add the class=\"ng-hide ng-cloak\" on that toolbar-button.\nhtml\n        <div class=\"left\">\n            <ons-back-button class=\"ng-cloak ng-hide\" ng-show=\"!menucall\"></ons-back-button>\n            <ons-toolbar-button ng-click=\"menu.toggleMenu();\" class=\"ng-cloak ng-hide\" ng-show=\"menucall\">\n                <ons-icon icon=\"bars\"></ons-icon>\n            </ons-toolbar-button>\n        </div>\nFixed! I don't know if you find a better way for that.. @argelius @frankdiox \n. @frandiox is this fixed in th newes 2.6.0 ?. @frandiox @asial-matagawa you can't believe how many hours I tried to debug this problem. I guess like 2-3 days and I tried so many hacks. Just installed 2.6.0 and it is just PERFECT. THANK YOU GUYS. Gonna drink a glass of gintonic now! . @frandiox after intensive testing I am still pretty happy, but there are some issues remaining.\nIt will jitter when reaching the bottom. \nAnd there was a problem when having a long list and \"reaccelerate\" scroll while still in inertial/momentum. There was a annoying jumping/flicker when touching screen while in scroll. I googled a simple method to detect if momentum has stopped or not and added a disabled attribute to the hook while \"still in momentum\" and removed the disabled attribute when momentum has finished.\nThis fixed that jitter problem like this:\n```js\n            var scrollElement = document.querySelector('#story .page__content');\n        scrollElement.addEventListener('scroll', function(){\n\n            if($scope.scrollTimer)\n            {\n                //clearTimeout(timer);\n                $timeout.cancel($scope.scrollTimer);\n                if(!loadEl.getAttribute('disabled')) {\n                    loadEl.setAttribute('disabled', true);\n                }\n            }\n            $scope.isScrolling = Math.floor(Date.now());\n            $scope.scrollTimer = $timeout(function(){\n                $scope.isScrolling = 0;\n                if(loadEl.getAttribute('disabled')) {\n                    loadEl.removeAttribute('disabled');\n                }\n            }, 120);\n\n        });\n\n```. @frandiox prob. an old CSS, maybe.. I will need to update I guess.. Hi, just updated and it worked like you said. Anyway, I'd expect another behaviour.\nThis happens:\n\nThis is what I'd expect\n\nI set a custom rule with padding-top: 0; now. I added a modifier to ons-page\ncss\n.page--storychat__background {\n    background: url(../../assets/img/stickies/2.jpg);\n    background-size: cover;\n}. css\n.toolbar.toolbar--cover-content + .page__background + .page__content {\n    padding-top: 44px;\n}\nI changed it to\ncss\n.toolbar.toolbar--cover-content + .page__background + .page__content {\n    padding-top: 0;\n}\nand then it looks like I want it to look. Latest 2.5.3 installed and replaced everything. I think this is just a misunderstanding between us. For me, your codepen is not what I've expected. I've expected that cover-content will overlay directly. This is why I set padding-top to 0 as I don't want a gap, I wanted the content to start directly at the edge of the view. \nFYI: I don't have a statusbar, it's a fullscreen app. Btw: I've set \nons.disableAutoStatusBarFill();\nMaybe you should not add a padding if the AutoStatusBarFill is disabled.. \n. @frandiox you are right with everything. I did not try onPull. Do I have to pass it as \n<ons-pull-hook on-pull=\"doSomthing\">\n?. @frandiox on-pull never get called. I have 2.6.0 installed.. I am never getting a call on my defined function, while \"action\" works.. Hi @frandiox \nany news regarding removing the line?. @frandiox thanks you mate!. Well, this isn't event documented. I also disagree. Of course the core (onsen) should prevent a swipe to pop on anything else then \"slide\" oder \"slide-md\", but imho, it should add a \"flick 2 dismiss\" (flick down/slideup if on scrollTop 0 or scrollEnd).\nThis is a known UX on iOS and pretty easy to implement, as you guys have a fully working pull 2 refresh which technically could be used to achieve this kind of behaviour). I already hacked something together with ons-gesture-detection, but I would love to see that feature inside of the core.. If you disagree to implement a core prevention and to add a \"flick 2 dismiss\" option, please just fix that 0.4 opacity bug, so people can decide themselves to use swipe-to-pop on lifted animations.. Sorry, misread that. Yeah, sorry! Would be nice to have this feature :). + missing an optional \"cancel\" button on prompt(). cancelable only makes the prompt beeing canceled on background-tap. thx @asialgearoid . For now, I changed the CSS and it's working for me. I don't see any reason for limiting toasts to 1-line.\n```css\n.toast__message {\n    white-space: normal;\n}\n.toast {\n    padding: 16px 16px;\n    line-height: 1.5;\n}\n```. @asialgearoid thanks for keeping up. Sad to hear that Fran isn't on board anymore, was a good and fast guy :)\nBut I am sure you guys doing great also. Thanks!. ",

Thank you for merging!\n. @argelius \nUpdated! (I thought there is no need to comment on this topic...)\nIt may cause a conflict, sorry.\nI'll do better next time.\n. @argelius\nDone. Thank you for information!\n. @argelius \nI'm sorry to bother you so often.\nIt seemed that the master branch in asial-matagawa/OnsenUI  was out-of-date.\nI have fixed it.\n. It is also reproduced with my macOS Safari 9.1.3 and I found that this issue is caused by the following line:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/5d24ffb8708fa2446fca030931bdcefb9e65146b/core/src/elements/ons-page.js#L32\nWhen I replaced\n_getToolbarElement() {\n    return util.findChild(this, 'ons-toolbar') || nullToolbarElement;\n  }\nwith\n_getToolbarElement() {\n    return util.findChild(this, 'ons-toolbar') || document.createElement('ons-toolbar');\n  }\nthen the munsterlander's code worked fine.\nIt seems that when document.createElement('ons-toolbar') is invoked too early, the evaluated value gets a broken prototype chain.\nThis behavior is reproduced only with Safari (not reproduced with Chrome).\n. @iqmeta:\nThank you for reporting.\nI created a new issue page for the problem you reported, so please check #1584.\n. @frankdiox Thank you for information!\n. @argelius No problem. I will check this soon.\n. @argelius: @frankdiox: @anatoo:\nIt seems that Custom Elements v1 polyfill calls connectedCallback many times per one ons-tab element on macOS Safari (on Chrome it does not).\nAt this time I have yet to identify that which of the polyfill and Onsen UI core causes this issue.\n. As a test I disabled Custom Elements v0 implementation (included in Chrome 52) which document-register-element uses internally, then Chrome 52 also reproduced the problem.\nSo we can conclude that this is not a problem of Safari.\n. @argelius:\nHow to reproduce it on Chrome 52:\n1. Create an empty directory.\n2. Copy 5 files from a Gist I have created.\n3. Run git clone https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI --branch 2.0.0-rc.18 --depth 1 in the directory.\n4. Run npm install in OnsenUI directory.\n5. Rewrite if (!(REGISTER_ELEMENT in document)) in OnsenUI/core/vendor/document-register-element.max.js to if (true).\n6. Run gulp core in OnsenUI directory.\n7. Open index.html on Chrome 52 through a local HTTP server launched by something like webpack-dev-server.\n. @anatoo @argelius @frankdiox\nI have identified the cause of this issue.\nIt consists of two factors:\n1. Custom Elements v0 implementation in Chrome 52 does not call disconnectedCallback in _compile of Onsen UI component, but document-register-element does.\n2. Our implementation of disconnectedCallback in ons-tab.js does not consider that when disconnectedCallback is called right after connectedCallback, disconnectedCallback needs to cancel XHR sent by connectedCallback. \nHere is an execution log of the example code running with document-register-element.\nons-tab[alarm] - init\nons-tab[alarm] - connectedCallback\nons-tab[alarm] - connectedCallback - contentReady\nons-tab[gruppen] - init\nons-tab[gruppen] - connectedCallback\nons-tab[gruppen] - connectedCallback - contentReady\nons-tab[gruppen] - connectedCallback - contentReady - onReady\nons-tab[gruppen] - _loadPageElement\nons-tab[alarm] - disconnectedCallback\nons-tab[gruppen] - disconnectedCallback\nons-tab[alarm] - connectedCallback\nons-tab[alarm] - connectedCallback - contentReady\nons-tab[gruppen] - connectedCallback\nons-tab[gruppen] - connectedCallback - contentReady\nons-tab[gruppen] - connectedCallback - contentReady - onReady\nons-tab[gruppen] - _loadPageElement\nons-tab[alarm] - disconnectedCallback\nons-tab[gruppen] - disconnectedCallback\nons-tab[alarm] - connectedCallback\nons-tab[alarm] - connectedCallback - contentReady\nons-tab[gruppen] - connectedCallback\nons-tab[gruppen] - connectedCallback - contentReady\nons-tab[gruppen] - connectedCallback - contentReady - onReady\nons-tab[gruppen] - _loadPageElement\nons-tab[alarm] - _loadPageElement\nons-tab[gruppen] - connectedCallback - contentReady - onReady - page loaded\nappendChild\nons-tab[gruppen] - connectedCallback - contentReady - onReady - page loaded\nappendChild\nons-tab[gruppen] - connectedCallback - contentReady - onReady - page loaded\nappendChild\nSo we have to fix:\n1. document-register-element\n2. Our implementation of disconnectedCallback in ons-tab.js\nAt this moment I don't have a good idea.\nI will try to fix this later, but it might be quite difficult for me.\n. It was reproduced also in macOS Safari 9.1.3.\nI will fix this issue as soon as possible.\n. @Dynalon \nThank you for reporting!\nOnsPage directive has been removed since Onsen UI RC.16 (CHANGELOG) because of some reasons.\nSince Angular 2 RC.5, when using Custom Elements-based library such as Onsen UI, you must put CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA into NgModule metadata.\nWith CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA, it will work.\nHere is an example using <ons-page> without OnsPage directive:\nhttps://github.com/monaca-templates/onsenui-v2-angular2-tabbar/blob/master/src/main.ts\n. @argelius \nI'm fixing another problem now, but I will fix this problem as soon as possible.\n. @frankdiox \nThank you for reporting. I have added an entry to our TODO list.. @argelius\nI will not be busy in this week, so I will check this issue as soon as possible.\n. @pinpikokun\nThe problem has been fixed.\nFor more details, please check the PR #1646.\n. @bdedardel \nThank you for reporting.\nI think Onsen UI should report an error in such situations, so I would like to implement something like it in the future.. @copleykj \nThank you for reporting!\nWe have already known the issue and we fixed it in Onsen UI 2.0.1.\nIf you use Onsen UI 2.0.0, could you try to replace 2.0.0 with 2.0.1?\nWe would appreciate if you could send the result on 2.0.1.\n. @argelius \nThank you.\nMy iOS environment is 9.3.2 and no flicker occurs on it.\nI wonder why it causes flickering on a particular environment...\nAnyway, I will seek another solution. Thank you.\n. This bug could be reproduced in Chrome with iPhone emulation mode and Safari on iOS 9.3.2.\n. @argelius\nNow I am preparing a better testing environment for iOS WebView / macOS Safari.\nAfter that, I will investigate this issue. Thank you.\n. @vjoomens \nI have investigated this issue.\nResult of the investigation:\n- This issue is caused by both of ons-sliding-menu element defined in angular-onsenui and ng-model attribute.\n    - ons-sliding-menu element is there for backward compatibility reasons.\n    - The new component for the menu is ons-splitter element.\n    - If you use ons-splitter instead of ons-sliding-menu, it will work fine.\nHere is a minimum example to reproduce this problem:\n(This issue can be reproduced also in iPhone 5s Simulator + iOS 9.3.)\n```html\n\n\n\n If we remove the ng-model attribute, it works fine. \n\n\n\n\n If we use ons-splitter, it works fine. \n\n<ons-splitter>\n  <ons-splitter-content>\n    <ons-page>\n      <ons-switch ng-model=\"test\"></ons-switch>\n    </ons-page>\n  </ons-splitter-content>\n</ons-splitter>\n\n```\njs\nangular.element(document).ready(function () {\n    angular.bootstrap(document, ['onsen']);\n});\nA CodePen for this issue is also available:\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/ENpNXK?editors=1010. It seems that it does not work on CircleCI. I will fix this later.\n. I thought npm shrinkwrap is the correct command to generate npm-shrinkwrap.json but actually it was incorrect.\nI have generated npm-shrinkwrap.json with npm shrinkwrap --dev and it will work fine on CircleCI.\n. @anatoo @argelius @frankdiox\nI have additionally made the following changes:\n- Use global instead of process.env.\n- Add --separately option to core-test and remove core-test-separately.\n- Rename the option --target to --specs.\n- Remove unnecessary global.SPEC_FILES_SPECIFIED.\nI think this PR could be useful when we fix the numerous problems which occur on browsers with WebReflection's/Polymer's CE0 polyfills.\nScreenshot:\n\nIf there is no problem, could anyone merge this PR?\n. @argelius\nI have tested the new test cases in the commit a970bea and it worked fine also on my environment (macOS Sierra + Chrome 54.0.2840.71  + ChromeDriver 2.25).\n\nFYI: The following error that the CI reported occurs also on my environment sometimes.\nFailures:\n1) navigator with dialog should not crash (issue #570)\n  Message:\n    Error: Timeout - Async callback was not invoked within timeout specified by jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL.\n  Stack:\n    Error: Timeout - Async callback was not invoked within timeout specified by jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL.\n        at tryOnTimeout (timers.js:224:11)\n        at Timer.listOnTimeout (timers.js:198:5)\nhttps://circleci.com/gh/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/3544\nThis seems to be probably caused by EC.stalenessOf(popPage) in test/e2e/composition/scenarios.js and have nothing to do with this PR.\n. @argelius \nYes, I know.\nI meant to say that we need to fix the core/angular1 test for surpressing failure of the CI.\nSorry for my confusing sentences.\n. @claudioc \nThank you for reporting!\nI will investigate this issue.\n. @alioygur @hughsaffar @cougarwww\nWe have started the development of vue-onsenui again.\nI estimate that the work will require 3-6 weeks.\nWe are planning to discuss the implementation of new vue-onsenui on this topic.\nAny feedback is welcome!\n@dannief \nWhen we released vue-onsenui 1.0.0 (preview version), Vue.js 2 was in beta version, so the binding was compatible only to Vue.js 1.\nYou can find more details in our blog:\nPreview! Vue.js support for Onsen UI (2016/08/31)\nhttps://onsen.io/blog/preview-vue-support-onsen-ui/\nOnsen UI with Vue 2 will soon be possible! (2016/10/25)\nhttps://onsen.io/blog/onsen-ui-vue-2/. @auzadventure\n\nLet's try to keep the framework as light as possible in the style of vue.\n\nYes, I'd like that. We want to make our binding robust and easy to use.\n\nI'd be happy to do some documentation work once it comes out.\n\nThank you! Please be patient until we release vue-onsenui@2.0.0-alpha.0.... @dohomi \nI guess this branch will not work with SSR now.\nWe hope we can support it but first we should implement some basic functionalities.... I forgot to update yarn.lock. Please be patient for a while...\n. I have fixed yarn.lock so that Yarn installs rxjs@5.0.0-beta.12 to fulfill the peer dependencies of @angular/*@2.1.2 which is included in the current yarn.lock.\nAfter this PR, npm users and Yarn users will have no errors.\nIf there is no problem, could anyone this PR and release a new version?\n. @argelius\nYes, I will update this as necessary.\nThank you for merging!\n. Since vue-onsenui@^2, it has a completely different structure and we are no longer maintaining vue-onsenui@^1.\nClosing this.. @harshvardhan12 \nThank you for reporting!\nMaybe it was a temporary problem on Monaca.\nIt works fine now:\n\nCould you try again?\n. @harshvardhan12 \nCould you check whether your monaca is up-to-date or not?\nThe latest version is 2.1.6.\nOlder version may cause errors like that.\n. @donskifarrell \nWe can follow the advice if it is easy to implement.\nBut it may require a certain amount of time due to our schedule.\nAnyway, thank you for your suggestion!. This issue has been solved.\nClosing this.. Sorry, I have not updated READMEs. I will fix them.\n. @argelius \nYes, I am preparing for integrating them with CI.\nI will create the PR soon..

I understand.\nI will close this issue for now and focus on the documents instead of the implementation.. @keijiodagawa\nIt was not an issue.\nThe following code does not follow the correct usage of Onsen UI 2.\nhtml\n<ons-list-item ng-repeat=\"(key, row) in value\">\n    ({{key}}) {{row.name}} ({{row.memo.test1}})\n</ons-list-item>\nSince Onsen UI 2, we have to write code like:\nhtml\n<ons-list-item ng-repeat=\"(key, row) in value\">\n    <div class=\"center\">({{key}}) {{row.name}} ({{row.memo.test1}})</div>\n</ons-list-item>. This issue seems to be duplicated to #1592.\nI will take a look at the issue soon, so please let me close this. Thank you.. I have investigated this problem briefly and found that change detection seems not working.\nThis problem occurs even on the latest packages below:\n- onsenui 2.0.5\n- @angular/* 2.4.3\n- angular2-onsenui 1.0.0-rc.4\nSo we just need to make change detection working on pages managed by OnsTab directive.. A possible workaround is to manually execute this.cd.detectChanges() when you need to detect changes.\nPlease be patient until we fix this problem.... @wahid \nThis problem has been fixed.\nYou can use the template features if you update each of @angular/*, onsenui, angular2-onsenui, rxjs and zone.js to the latest version.. I have made additional tests on more environments (= more core versions).\nEnvironment  Please choose your environment. \n```\n[Core]\n    Onsen UI 2.0.1\n    Onsen UI 2.0.2\n    Onsen UI 2.0.3\n    Onsen UI 2.0.4\n[Framework]\n    Angular 2.2.4\n[Framework binding]\n    angular2-onsenui 1.0.0-rc.1\n[Additional libraries]\n    None\n[Platform]\n    Desktop - macOS Sierra\n[Browser]\n    Desktop - Chrome 54.0.2840.98\n    Desktop - Safari 10.0 (12602.1.50.0.10)\n```\nUnlike #1728, this seems to be not an issue of core, but one of angular2-onsenui because even though I rollback core the problem still occurs.. I have tried to rollback Angular version from 2.2.4 to 2.1.2, but the problem remains.\nAngular version seems to have nothing to do with this problem.. @misterjunio \nThank you for investigating, I got it.\nLooks like it is a problem of the core.\nI think we have to fix ons-tabbar#setActiveTab to wait for tabs to be loaded.. Thank you!. @frankdiox \nI will try it soon. Thank you for information!\n. @frankdiox \nI tried with the latest revision dc9f004a007c94977c8717d70c5fdd02e2a5fbf8 and then this problem disappeared.\n(Instead, #1727 occured. It seems that #1727 has nothing to do with this issue)\nLet's release Onsen UI 2.0.5 and angular2-onsenui 1.0.0-rc.4.. This issue will be fixed in the next version of Onsen UI (=2.0.5) and angular2-onsenui (=1.0.0-rc.4).\nClosing this.. @anatoo\nThank you!\nI will remove BrowserModule from Angular 2 monaca-templates if https://github.com/monaca/monaca-lib/issues/90 is solved.. @anatoo Thank you!. This suggestion has been commited in #1731. Closing this.. @Sunil2197 \nThank you for reporting.\nI have tried to reproduce this problem but it was not reproduced.\nI guess you forgot to:\n- Load angular-onsenui.js.\n- Execute ons.bootstrap or angular.module('myApp', ['onsen']).\nAlso, ons-templateshould be just under the body element.\nIt cannot be located in any element except for body.\nClosing this.. This issue seems to be solved by oneself. Closing this.. This is simply information for users and the problem has already been fixed, so I will close this.. @magickasoft \nThank you for reporting!\nWe have #591 as a similar issue(but too old).\nWe are focusing on quality improvement rather than other tasks now, so we will investigate this soon.. @SharkChips \nThank you for reporting!\nI am embarrassed.... Hi, @gogodigimo!\nThank you for reporting, but we need some code to reproduce the problem and fix it.\nWe would appreciate if you paste some part of the code you have.. @gogodigimo \nThank you!\nI will investigate this problem by using your code.. @gogodigimo \nI am glad to hear that you have found a solution.\nI investigated this problem a bit, so I will paste a memo:\n\nI have tried to reproduce the problem with iOS 10.1 simulator and iOS Safari (instead of iOS UIWebView due to some reasons), but unfortunately I was not able to reproduce the problem.\nBut I have an idea to solve this problem:\n- Onsen UI uses FastClick internally.\n- This problem must be a problem of FastClick.\n- FastClick has a feature that if you set needsClick to the element, FastClick will ignore it.\n - Implemented in this function: >https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/7bb5ab55bd470c0563ab6f5c50d8cb146c4c2a30/core/vendor/fastclick-patched.js#L227\nThis code might fix the problem:\nhtml\n<img\n   id=\"btnSearch\"\n   src=\"img/Search-Icon.png\"\n   data-tap-disabled=\"true\"\n   ng-click=\"SearchFromJumpStart()\"\n   class=\"search-icon-large needsClick\"\n   align=\"right\" />. @frankdiox \nYes, I think this is supposed to be safe for merging.\nCould you merge this?. @anatoo \nIt is not an urgent task to solve this problem because the original issue reported by @keijiodagawa has already been solved. Thank you for checking.. @koheiokazaki \nThank you for reporting!\n[Framework binding]\n   angular-onsenui 2.0.4\n\nIf you are using Angular 2.2.4, Framework binding must not be angular-onsenui, but angular2-onsenui.\nCould you tell us angular2-onsenui version which you are using?\nIt is written in package.json.. This issue is similar to #780, so it can be a problem of the Onsen UI core.. Thank you! We will investigate this issue as soon as possible.. Sorry, I misconfigured the base of this PR.\nI have changed it from master to vue2.. Currently no one in Onsen UI Team can review this PR, so I will merge this.. @frankdiox \n\nIt's an ons-toolbar-button with an ons-icon and text inside it.\n\nOh I missed it, sorry.\n\nI guess it's used in this way to add a custom \"onclick\", but the ons-back-button already has an onClick and even options properties to overwrite its behavior.\n\nI have seen many users suffer from the problem of custom onclick on back buttons.\nI think we should deal with it by adding more detailed guides as well as API references.. @frankdiox \nYes, it's documented and I know it is an Angular 1 specific problem.\nWhat I meant is just the document can be improved more.\n(Or we can add conditional warnings which appears when a user writes something not recommended). Hi, @koheiokazaki!\n\nI don't know what to discuss about here...\n\nFor issues about Onsen UI + third party libraries, we encourage you to use https://community.onsen.io/ .\nYou can login to the forum with your GitHub account.\nThis GitHub repository basically supports issues from Onsen UI core/bindings.\nThank you for your understanding.. @anatoo\nThank you!\nI think this fix will not cause another bug.\n@frankdiox \nIf you think this PR is safe for merging, could you merge?. @frankdiox \nWe have to prepare minified CSS files and do something but it works fine now with CDNJS thanks to the CDNJS maintainers.\nI will merge this.. I talked with @koheiokazaki on another place and he managed to solve his problem by the solution above.\nClosing this.. @anatoo\nThank you!\n~I noticed that fix-1731 branch has not yet been merged.\nCould you merge fix-1731 and then merge this PR?~. @anatoo \nSorry, I said something weird.\nFor fix-1731 branch, I would like to ask you to create a new PR.. @anatoo\nIt seems that Angular 2.4.1 broke something in angular2-onsenui.\nCould you fix them?. This problem is caused by this directive definition:\n```js\nangular.module('onsen').directive('onsTabbar', function($onsen, $compile, $parse, TabbarView) {\nreturn {\n    restrict: 'E',\nreplace: false,\nscope: true,\n\nlink: function(scope, element, attrs, controller) {\n\n\n  scope.$watch(attrs.hideTabs, function(hide) {\n    if (typeof hide === 'string') {\n      hide = hide === 'true';\n    }\n    element[0].setTabbarVisibility(!hide);\n  });\n\n  var tabbarView = new TabbarView(scope, element, attrs);\n  $onsen.addModifierMethodsForCustomElements(tabbarView, element);\n\n  $onsen.registerEventHandlers(tabbarView, 'reactive prechange postchange init show hide destroy');\n\n  element.data('ons-tabbar', tabbarView);\n  $onsen.declareVarAttribute(attrs, tabbarView);\n\n  scope.$on('$destroy', function() {\n    tabbarView._events = undefined;\n    $onsen.removeModifierMethods(tabbarView);\n    element.data('ons-tabbar', undefined);\n  });\n\n  $onsen.fireComponentEvent(element[0], 'init');\n}\n\n};\n});\n```\nI have briefly investigated this problem and found:\n- In macOS/iOS Safari, when element[0].setTabbarVisibility(!hide); is invoked element[0] has a broken prototype chain.\n    - This might be caused by CE0 polyfill (not used in browsers which have its native CE0 implementation such as Chrome).\n    - We have to delay the invocation of element[0].setTabbarVisibility(!hide);.. @misterjunio \nThank you for investigating!\nI would appreciate if you create an issue for the 'different bug'.\n\nI will create a PR to close it now.\n\nThank you!. I guess the automatic styling does not work properly.. \ud83d\udc4d . This is related to #1784.. This might be related to FastClick.. @misterjunio \nI forgot to tell you this:\n- When you made changes (except for undocumented API or something) to the core or the bindings, please update CHANGELOG.md or bindings/foo/CHANGELOG.md.\nThank you.. @puku0x \nThank you for reporting.\nActually I think this is not a bug since ons-template cannot be nested, that is, ons-template elements cannot include child ons-template elements:\n\nHowever, having multiple pages declared in the same file is sometimes more convenient.\nons-template component is the solution for this.\nYou can create as many pages as you need in your index.html (there and only there) by using this component.\n\nhttps://onsen.io/v2/docs/guide/js/#templates\nOnce you move inner ons-template elements to outside of the root ons-template, it will work fine.\nBut we should warn a user when ons-template is located in ons-template, so I will add console.warn to ons-template in the core.\nThank you!. @frankdiox \n\nPerhaps we should check that the parent is document.body?\n\nThat is better and I have fixed my implementation according to your suggestion.\nThe new implementation shows the parent's outerHTML and it works even if the ons-template is not located in index.html.\nThank you for your reviewing!. @frankdiox \nMaybe completely fixed now.\nthis.parentNode can be null even after connectedCallback is called due to some CE polyfill-related bug, so I have added if (this.parentNode).. @frankdiox \nI think this PR is now safe for merging.\nCould you merge this?. @keijiodagawa \nPages defined by ons-template cannot be used with templateUrl.\nPlease use this code instead.\njs\napp.directive(\"toolbarTemplate\", function() {\n  return {\n    template: '\\\n      <ons-toolbar style=\"background: #aaa;\">\\\n        <div class=\"center\">\\\n          directive\\\n        </div>\\\n      </ons-toolbar>\\\n    '\n  };\n});. @keijiodagawa \nProbably you should use replace: true in the definition of toolbarTemplate directive.\njs\napp.directive(\"toolbarTemplate\", function() {\n  return {\n    replace: true,\n    template: '\\\n      <ons-toolbar style=\"background: #aaa;\">\\\n        <div class=\"center\">\\\n          directive\\\n        </div>\\\n      </ons-toolbar>\\\n    '\n  };\n});\nIf using this, <div toolbar-template></div> will be replaced with the ons-toolbar element.\nOtherwise, ons-page cannot recognize the inner ons-toolbar and the page content will be rendered to some wrong position.\nSo we think this is not a bug. Closing this.. Related: #1814, #2053. @frankdiox \nI think it is fine!\nBTW, the reason why you used stage-3 is because we can notice when transform-object-rest-spread is moved to stage-4, right?. @frankdiox @anatoo\n\nBy the way, Angular2 bindings only use es2015 but I didn't want to modify that. You guys can update it if you want.\n\nSure, thank you!. I have reopened #1860 to deal with the problem you reported.. @net900621 \nThank you for the PR, but it has been already fixed in another branch (vue-api):\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/1837/files#diff-cc347eda69595b59d60fa72f905de0b8\nWe will soon release vue-onsenui 2.0.0-alpha.1 or vue-onsenui 2.0.0-beta.0 with the fix. Thank you!. @misterjunio \nIt could not be reproduced in iPhone 5 Simulator (with iOS 8.4).\nThis might be a device-dependent bug.\n. @misterjunio \nSorry, the screenshot I pasted above is based on a recent revision. It is not based on 2.1.0.\nI have investigated this issue on a real iOS 8 device and found that this issue has already been fixed.\nClosing this.. @misterjunio \nThis seems to be because the line below removes display: -webkit-flex; (which is required for iOS 8 and older) from the selector ons-row defined in onsenui.css.\nThe settings of gulp-autoprefixer are too old.\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/9ba11077ce7c7cfe8d7778993b4f0bfbefd15c14/gulpfile.babel.js#L379\njs\n    // onsenui.css\n    gulp.src([\n      'core/css/common.css',\n      'core/css/*.css'\n    ])\n      .pipe($.concat('onsenui.css'))\n      // This line causes the issue\n      .pipe($.autoprefixer('> 1%', 'last 2 version', 'ff 12', 'ie 8', 'opera 12', 'chrome 12', 'safari 12', 'android 2', 'ios 6'))\n      .pipe($.header('/*! <%= pkg.name %> - v<%= pkg.version %> - ' + dateformat(new Date(), 'yyyy-mm-dd') + ' */\\n', {pkg: pkg}))\n      .pipe(gulp.dest('build/css/'))\n      .pipe(gulpIf(CORDOVA_APP, gulp.dest('cordova-app/www/lib/onsen/css'))),. @misterjunio \nI have checked them but show method and animation attribute of ons-popover worked correctly.\nI guess you might have input wrong arguments to show method.\nshow method accepts two types of arguments:\n- show(target, [options])\n- show(options) <---- Undocumented!\nNote that the example file of ons-popover uses show(options):\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/85c4e233af9c0eb42960a928ebb2272d77909e62/examples/popover/index.html#L19\nIf you use show(options), you cannot pass 2nd argument.\nFor example:\n```js\n// works\napp.popover.show(e, {animation: 'fade-ios', animationOptions: {duration: 3.0, delay: 0.4, timing: 'ease-in'}});\n// works\napp.popover.show({target: e, animation: 'fade-ios', animationOptions: {duration: 3.0, delay: 0.4, timing: 'ease-in'}});\n// does not work\napp.popover.show({target: e}, {animation: 'fade-ios', animationOptions: {duration: 3.0, delay: 0.4, timing: 'ease-in'}});\n```\nClosing this.. @misterjunio \nI have fixed this problem with #1867.\nClosing this.. @misterjunio \nI fixed this problem between 2.1.0 and 2.2.0 by #1867, but #1840 broke ons-progress-circular again.\nThe current ons-progress-circular depends on SVG 2 features so it is not working on some browsers like iOS 8 and Firefox as this user explains:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/1840#pullrequestreview-27289015. @anatoo\nbindings/react directory never affects css-components, core and angular-onsenui, so I think this PR can be merged.\nMaybe we should think about production branches for each binding...\n@frandiox \nWhat do you think?. @misterjunio \nI think this is not a bug but what should be improved.\n@anatoo is fixing the CSS components now, so I will ask him to improve ons-range.. Here is a screenshot of the problem:\n\n. @misterjunio \nThank you for reporting.\nI have investigated this problem and I think this is a z-index bug of Chrome 43 (installed in the device you used (Huawei P8lite)). Chrome 43 repaints outside of the page__content, but does not repaint ons-toolbar correctly. I think it is hard to find a proper workaround.\nIn Android 5.0 and later, Android System WebView and Chrome for Android are periodically updated, so I don't consider this as a critical glitch bug we should fix.\nClosing this.. This issue seems to be fixed in the latest commit ID https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/tree/b5bc5c666d02fbafeac11581eb3b60473df9e9d1 (2.2.0 candidate).. @misterjunio \nIn iOS 8, it seems that background-color: transparent; removes the arrow.\nI think this will not be fixed as long as we depend on the arrow which the native select provides.... @misterjunio\nNo, I think we should not make efforts to this problem too much since the number of iOS 8 users is getting lower.\nI think we should prioritize fixing problems in iOS 9 and 10.\nI will postpone fixing this issue for now...\nIf there is any problem, please feel free to ask me.. This problem is also reproduced in iOS 9 and 10.\nThe commit ID I used: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/tree/b5bc5c666d02fbafeac11581eb3b60473df9e9d1. This issue was superseded by #2017 and fixed in #2028.\nClosing this.. I will merge this.. Additional tasks have been done. I will merge this.. @anatoo\nI agree with your proposal \ud83d\udc4d . @misterjunio \nI have checked your commits and I think it is fine. Thank you! . \ud83d\udc4d . @misterjunio \nIt is due to the design of Angular and attributeChangedCallback of ons-splitter-side.\nAngular compiles the following code\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninto something likejs\nconst splitter = document.createElement('ons-splitter');\nconst splitterSide = document.createElement('ons-splitter-side');\nsplitterSide.setAttribute('side', 'foo');\nsplitterSide.setAttribute('width', 'foo');\nsplitterSide.setAttribute('style', 'foo');\nsplitterSide.setAttribute('collapse', 'foo');\nsplitterSide.setAttribute('swipeable', 'foo');\nconst splitterContent = document.createElement('ons-splitter-content');\nsplitter.appendChild(splitterSide);\nsplitter.appendChild(splitterContent);\n```\n(maybe this is not accurate)\nEach time splitterSide.setAttribute is called, ons-splitter-side#attributeChangedCallback is triggered and ons-splitter-side runs this._update():\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/38aac734487f526f6fe2d993d368fe0adde340e8/core/src/elements/ons-splitter-side.js#L500\nBut at that time splitterContent is not yet appended to splitter, so this._update() leads to undefined on this.content.\nWe need MutationObserver or Shadow DOM for fixing this problem and I think it cannot be quickly fixed.\nFor the time being I think we have to use [attr.collapse]=\"'collapse'\" and [attr.swipeable]=\"'swipeable'\".. @misterjunio \nAh, maybe we can wrap this._update(name, current); in attributeChangedCallback with contentReady.\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/38aac734487f526f6fe2d993d368fe0adde340e8/core/src/elements/ons-splitter-side.js#L500\nThis might be a possible workaround (but not sure). @misterjunio \ncontentReady(this._content, () => { ~~~~ }); might wait for ons-splitter-content instead of ons-splitter-side. We can change the target of contentReady.\nSorry if it does not work.. Ah, this._content is undefined at that time... Maybe we can try this.parentNode (= ons-splitter) but anyway we need to thoroughly investigate the code to completely solve this problem.. @misterjunio \nOh, I see. Thank you!. @misterjunio \n\nBut I don't get it, doesn't that wait for ons-splitter-side to be ready and not ons-splitter-content?\n\nMaybe waiting ons-splitter-side is equivalent to waiting ons-splitter-content.\nWhat is important is delaying the evaluation of this._content.. @misterjunio \nIf you create a PR for this issue, I would appreciate if you fork production branch.\nNow we have production branch, so we can immediately release angular2-onsenui@1.0.0-rc.7 for the Monaca templates which @adamkozuch maintains if you merge a fix branch into production branch. (After merging it into production branch, we have to merge it also into master branch). @sfstar \nWe could fix this issue thanks to #1892 but the fix for this is delayed now.\nPlease be patient until some other tasks are completed.. @sfstar \n\ncould it be possible that this issue also causes angular2 data binding to stop working?\n\nYes, it could happen.\nWe are planning to fix issues on Onsen UI with Angular and support Angular 4 for a month.. @sfstar \nAh, what I meant is the issues will be fixed in one month (<month).\nSorry for my bad English.. @sfstar \nThank you for the information!\nSince we finished releasing onsenui@2.3.0, react-onsenui@1.3.0 and vue-onsenui@2.0.0-beta.6, we will start dealing with angular2-onsenui.. @bailinlu \nThank you for reporting.\nOnsen UI might not work in old Android Devices since Onsen UI supports only Android 4.4+:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI#browser-support\nClosing this.. I'm glad to hear that. Thank you!. @fWd82 \nWe have a repo for Monaca CLI, so I moved this issue to https://github.com/monaca/monaca-cli/issues/79 .\nClosing this.. @misterjunio \nThank you!\n\nI can't run the tests on Safari\n\ngulp unit-test uses gulp unit-test --browsers local_chrome,remote_macos_elcapitan_safari_10 as a default config:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/gulpfile.babel.js#L142\n(remote_macos_elcapitan_safari_10 launches a Safari browser on a remote server in Sauce Labs)\nI think you can run the tests on Safari by setting gulp unit-test --browsers local_safari if you have a Mac.. Thank you puku0x!\n@anatoo\nCould you take a look at this?. @anatoo \nFYI: As we decided in the meeting 2-3 weeks ago, we should not immediately merge patches into master branch. We should release patches (and new CHANGELOG and package.json) by using production branch (and perhaps something like release-2.2.1 branch additionally) and after that we should merge the patches into master.. @anatoo\nAlso, we should fork the current production branch (https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/tree/production).\nThe current master branch contains dirty commits which should not be released now.\nPlease consider using cherry pick for production branch.. @frandiox \nThank you for the changes.\nIt could be said that ons-fab potentially depends on ons-navigator and other components.... I see, nice work!. @frandiox \nSorry, I missed the notification...\nI found that some files were not 3rd-party ones but our original files, so I placed CustomEvent.js, childNodeRemove.js and viewport.js outside the vendor directory. (FYI, viewport.js was not even a polyfill...)\n. I see, thank you!\nI will remove vendor directory and use polyfills instead of polyfill.. Done!. @frandiox \nThank you!\nI think at least the previous behavior is a bug.\nPlease feel free to merge with a new CHANGELOG.. @frandiox \nI thought that too with the same reason.\nI prefer 2.2.2 because 2.3.0 requires us to update the 4 bindings and the 12 Monaca templates.\nI will postpone merging this.\n\nI forgot to say:\n- The current implementation depends on a bug of CE1 polyfill that we can read/write child elements in constructor (In the real CE1, we cannot do that and have to use Shadow DOM).\n- In order to truly support CE1, we have to read/write child elements outside constructor.. @frandiox \nIt's really simple \ud83c\udf89 \nI will merge this.. Also, I will manually test Onsen UI with this branch. @frandiox \nYes, this PR contains everything from master.\nThe reason why I created release-2.2.1 branch is because if I use master branch, we cannot change master until it is merged into production.\nI will directly use master in the next time.\nThank you for the comment!. @frandiox \nThe commit https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/b79ddbfc07105de985a99105ebb7db925279bb8c#diff-f96d6a24e6d6c2c79a80b239b7a738d5 onons-pull-hook.js seems to have broken pull hooks on Android 4.4.4 + Chrome 56 and Android 5.0.1 + Chrome 56.\nFor some reasons it worked on Android 6.0 + Chrome 52.\nIt also refreshes the page.\n\nDo you know the cause of this broken behavior?. I am investigating the problem above now. This problem seems a problem of the latest Android Chrome.\nEven I used onsenui@2.0.1 and onsenui@2.2.0, the same problem happened.. @frandiox \nI noticed your comment now.\nI will postpone fixing this problem and fix it later with #1637.. @frandiox \nThank you for the fix! \ud83d\udc4d \nI think it's fine. Please merge it if CI passes the tests. @frandiox \nI have tested some expressions on Safari 10.0.\n\nThis fix worked fine.\nI would like to release this fix in the future release.\nThank you @yarysh !. @ritox842\nPerhaps it is because your app loads angular2-onsenui before loading onsenui.\nCould you check the loading order?. @Chozzle \nBrowsers treat spaces, line breaks and texts as a text node equally, so it's impossible to give  special treatment to line breaks.\nWe are now working on fixing this problem on #1926.. @keijiodagawa \nThank you for reporting.\nThis issue might be fixed by #1892.\nPlease be patient until Onsen UI 2.2.2 (or later) is released.. @keijiodagawa \nI made sure that this issue has been fixed by #1892.\nYou can fix this problem by updating onsenui to 2.2.3 or later.\nClosing this.. For Onsen UI Team:\n- I have added core-js/fn/object/set-prototype-of with global namespace pollution as a polyfill for Object.setPrototypeOf.. It seems that at least .switch--material__input needs z-index: 0;.\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/1d2738cab5e93fe7d4c5194599de5dd101c34019/css-components/src/components/switch.css#L170\nCurrently it is given z-index: 1; from --hide-input.\n.switch__input has it but .switch--material__input not.. @anatoo\nThank you!\nI forgot to paste this:\n. @frandiox \nNice work! \ud83d\udc4d  It's comprehensive and impressive.\nJust one thing, I think Release procedure should be moved into CONTRIBUTING.. Thank you! \ud83d\udcaf . Carousel, Form Input, Popover, Pull Hook, Select, Range, ... are also broken.. I have identified the reason why 2.2.3 broke vue-onsenui.\nThis code works differently on the Chrome CE1 Impl and the new CE1 polyfill:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\n\n    if (window.customElements) { // even if native CE1 impl exists, use polyfill\n        window.customElements.forcePolyfill = true;\n    }\n  \n\n\n    customElements.define('x-foo', class extends HTMLElement {\n      constructor() {\n        super();\n        console.log(this.tagName + '#constructor');\n      }</p>\n<pre><code>  connectedCallback() { console.log(this.tagName + '#connectedCallback');\n    // Move the child element to outside of `document`\n    document.createElement('div').appendChild(this.firstChild);\n  }\n\n  disconnectedCallback() { console.log(this.tagName + '#disconnectedCallback');\n  }\n});\n\ncustomElements.define('x-bar', class extends HTMLElement {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    console.log(this.tagName + '#constructor');\n  }\n\n  connectedCallback() { console.log(this.tagName + '#connectedCallback');\n  }\n\n  disconnectedCallback() { console.log(this.tagName + '#disconnectedCallback');\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n\n\n\n    const foo = document.createElement('x-foo');\n    {\n      const bar = document.createElement('x-bar');\n      foo.appendChild(bar);\n    }</p>\n<pre><code>document.body.appendChild(foo);\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n\n\n```\n\nExpected (Chrome CE1 Impl):\nX-FOO#constructor\nX-BAR#constructor\nX-FOO#connectedCallback\nX-BAR#connectedCallback\nX-BAR#disconnectedCallback\n\nResult (the new CE1 polyfill):\nX-FOO#constructor\nX-BAR#constructor\nX-FOO#connectedCallback\nX-BAR#disconnectedCallback\nX-BAR#connectedCallback. At least this issue has been fixed by https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/1932/commits/3cdc5ca3bf1d63d5e291b8b639c2ec442af9cc3d.\nClosing this.. @anatoo\nI have merged this PR instead. Thank you!. @puku0x \nThank you for reporting!\nWe will check this.\n@anatoo \nIs this a bug?\nOr an expected behavior?. @frandiox @misterjunio \nI think Opinion 1 is easy to use for users although Opinion 3 gives us some advantages.\nWhat about compiling ons-action-sheet and ons-action-sheet-item into ons-action-sheet, ons-list and ons-list-item with modifiers?. We discussed this specification in the previous weekly meeting but we did not reached a conclusion.\nLet's talk about this again soon.. @misterjunio \nThank you! I have merged this.. @misterjunio \nThank you!\nI will include this fix in the next release.. @frandiox \nI agree with using inheritance for minimizing redundancy. Nice!\nBut I am not sure about things related to wcdoc.\n@anatoo \nWhat do you think about the relation between this refactor and wcdoc?. @frandiox \nYes, I know what you want to do.\nWhat I am not sure is how to deal with the problem that wcdoc provides no way to do that.\n(So I asked @anatoo). Note:\n- This fix enables vue-onsenui to work with onsenui@>=2.2.3 (which uses @webcomponents/custom-elements).\n- After this fix, vue-onsenui cannot be used with onsenui@<=2.2.2 (which uses document-register-element).. I think it is fine to deprecate ons.createDialog, ons.createAlertDialog and ons.createPopover because those are not that useful.\nMy only concern is its naming.\n- createElement is associated with Document#createElement.\n    - Document#createElement has no side effect while ons.createElement has a side effect which attaches the created element to somewhere. It's a bit confusing.\n- In my point of view I think it would be better to use another name which implies the existence of the side effect.\n    - ons.showElement, ons.showTemplate, ons.useTemplate, ons.show, .... @frandiox \nSorry, I missed instead of before attaching it to document.body...\nIf so I have no concerns about ons.createElement. Thank you for suggestion!. @frandiox \nWhat about always returning a Promise?\nIf ons.createElement('<ons-list-item>...</ons-list-item>') returns an element, users would expect that ons.createElement('path/to/template') also returns an element (even though that is impossible).. @frandiox @misterjunio \nI see, in that case let's use your original suggestion \ud83d\ude42 \nI will write some note in onsen.io in case users get confused about the return value type of ons.createElement.. @azarus \nThank you for the feedback.\nI guess this is a feature request for Monaca CLI?\nIf so, we are currently not planning to support gulp due to some reasons. Thank you for understanding.. @JohnTao \nThank you for reporting, but Onsen UI 1.x is deprecated and no longer maintained now.\nCould you consider using Onsen UI 2 please?\nClosing this.. Thank you @ottijp !\nWe knew this problem but did not manage to identify the reason why it always returns 0.\nI will merge this.. I'm stuck by the errors on CircleCI above...\nThe exactly same JavaScript code worked on my environment (macOS Sierra + Chrome 58) but did not work on CircleCI (Linux + Chrome 58).\nI guess ChromeDriver for Linux or Chrome for Linux is broken but it's very weird...\nWhat I did is only to replace Rollup with webpack 2.. @anatoo @misterjunio @frandiox \nIf you have a Linux environment, could you run gulp test in bindings/angular2?\nCircleCI (= Linux instance) reported the following error but it was not reproduced in my environment.\n```\n[05:12:12] Starting 'e2e-test'...\n[05:12:14] I/direct - Using ChromeDriver directly...\n[05:12:14] I/launcher - Running 1 instances of WebDriver\nStarted\n.......................................F...........[05:13:44] W/element - more than one element found for locator By(css selector, ons-tab) - the first result will be used\n..[05:13:46] W/element - more than one element found for locator By(css selector, .normal-page) - the first result will be used\n[05:13:46] W/element - more than one element found for locator By(css selector, .normal-page) - the first result will be used\n..\nFailures:\n1) pull-hook.html should load stuff when pulled down\n  Message:\n    Failed: Wait timed out after 5020ms\n``. This bug was reproduced on my environment (Debian + Chrome 58).. This issue has been fixed and it was due to:\n- Change detection was not run even after newons-list-itemwas pushed\n- But the E2E test codes managed to run change detection only on macOS for unknown reason.\n    - I guess it's related to the way that Zone.js works.. @misterjunio \nThank you for testing, but actually iOS Safari behaves differently compared to macOS Safari.\nCould you test also on iOS devices if you have time?. @misterjunio \nFor example #1870 occured on iOS 9, 10. @misterjunio \nThank you!\nI am relieved to hear that.. @frandiox @anatoo \nI thinkons.actionSheet()` is great but it would be better to have a certain prefix for the new method because we will have more components similar to action sheets.\nIf the methods have a common prefix, we will have:\nons.openActionSheet()\nons.openToast()\nons.openDatePicker()\nbut if not, we will have:\nons.actionSheet()\nons.toast()\nons.datePicker()\nThe latter naming could cause a problem when we sort the methods of ons alphabetically.\n\nIf we have ons.notification.action, we will suffer from how to deal with components like date pickers, so I think we should avoid using ons.notification.action.. Thank you for discussing this!. @misterjunio \nI checked the implementation and I think it's fine.\n\nWe can also compile\nhtml\n<ons-card>Lorem ipsum ...</ons-card>\ninto\nhtml\n<ons-card>\n  <div class=\"card__content\">\n    Lorem ipsum ...\n  </div>\n</ons-card>\nas ons-page is doing so, but cards have no \"main\" block unlike pages as long as I read the Material Design guidelines for Cards.\nMoreover, we might support Rich media, Actions and some blocks described in the guideline.\nTherefore I think the current specification which forces users to use the following structure is fine for now.\n```html\n\n...\n...\n\n``. @misterjunio \nApart from the specification of slots forons-card`, it would be better if the current example (screenshot is below) is more similar to real use cases. For example, I guess buttons should be flat ones.\n\n\n\"real use cases\" means like this: https://storage.googleapis.com/material-design/publish/material_v_11/assets/0Bzhp5Z4wHba3bG0tNkIyNDhJZEU/components_cards28.png\nThis is something optional, so please feel free to concentrate on other things.. @misterjunio \n\nmerely a possibility\n\nAh, I see.\n\nDo you think that in general we should provide more 'building blocks' for the cards?\n\nI think we can postpone supporting more building blocks since what we need to do for now is only to give enough extensibility to ons-card for future changes.\nLet's release onsenui@2.3.0 with ons-card which contains the current minimum features.\nAny suggestions?. @CrankedCode \nIt seems that this issue occurs on old browsers because some of them don't have Set and Map.\nI have fixed this problem in #1968 and it will be released in onsenui@2.2.5.\nThank you for reporting!. 64d9ed1dc17c074fd35d2bc144decc6e9e36877f seems to break Espree which is used in gulp build-docs.\nI will check the cause of this problem. @frandiox \nI have identified the cause of this problem.\nYou used traling commas in function argument list in RevealSplitterAnimator, but wcdoc@0.1.18 cannot recognize ES2017 things because it has a wrong setting.\nWe have to fix OnsenUI/wcdoc.... @AnfiGroup \nThank you for reporting.\nThat problem occurs on old Android environments.\nIt is already reported in #1967 and fixed in #1968.\nWe will release a fixed version of onsenui (2.2.5) soon, so please be patient until it is released.\nClosing this.. @ilmuwebsite \nIt's already fixed but simply not yet released.\nWe are going to release onsenui@2.2.6, so please be patient for a while.\nOr you can add this code into your stylesheet file to fix the problem:\ncss\nons-input .text-input__container input {\n    width: 100%;\n    display: inline-block;\n}. @vajura \nThank you for reporting!\nSince Onsen UI is a UI framework for mobile browsers, Internet Explorer is not supported in the current version (2.2.5).\nPlease check Browser Support section in README.md:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI#browser-support\n\nAlso if i use remote build for android and install the android app the app is in a wrong design yet again.\n\nWe would like to investigate this problem but it requires more information about your environments such as Android OS version.\nPlease note that Android 4.4.3 and older versions are not supported in Onsen UI.. @frandiox \n\nOne is obviously placing the dialog at a high level so it always shows on top of the toolbars, but it might be hard some times to pass down a reference to show/hide the dialog from a deep place (not sure about this, perhaps it's easy in Angular2).\n\nIn Vue 2 we write outerHTML of the component element in template, but in Angular 2+ we write innerHTML in template.\nThat is, in Angular 2+ we can write template as follows:\n``ts\n  template:\n\n\nAlert Dialog\n\n\n\nCustom dialogs\nCustom alert-dialog\nCustom dialog\n      <ons-list-header>Notification</ons-list-header>\n      <ons-list-item tappable (click)=\"alert()\" id=\"alert-button\">Alert</ons-list-item>\n      <ons-list-item tappable (click)=\"confirm()\" id=\"confirm-button\">Confirmation</ons-list-item>\n      <ons-list-item tappable (click)=\"prompt()\" id=\"prompt-button\">Prompt</ons-list-item>\n    </ons-list>\n  </div>\n</ons-page>\n\n<ons-alert-dialog cancelable #alert>\n  <div class=\"alert-dialog-title\">Warning!</div>\n  <div class=\"alert-dialog-content\">\n    {{'This is just an example.'}}\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"alert-dialog-footer\">\n    <button class=\"alert-dialog-button\" (click)=\"alert.hide()\">OK</button>\n  </div>\n</ons-alert-dialog>\n\n<ons-dialog animation=\"default\" cancelable #dialog>\n  <div class=\"dialog-mask\"></div>\n  <div class=\"dialog\">\n    <div class=\"dialog-container\" style=\"height: 200px;\">\n      <ons-page>\n        <ons-toolbar>\n          <div class=\"center\">Name</div>\n        </ons-toolbar>\n        <div class=\"content\">\n          <div style=\"text-align: center\">\n            <p>{{'This is just an example.'}}</p>\n            <br>\n            <ons-button (click)=\"dialog.hide()\">Close</ons-button>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </ons-page>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</ons-dialog>\n\n`\n```\nTherefore the problem of masks is not a problem in angular2-onsenui.. Ah, if we use selector: 'ons-page[foo]' to create a reusable page component, the problem appears again. I added deprecation warnings about *Factory in ngx-onsenui@4.0.0-rc.0.\n\n. @frandiox \nYes, users can use import * as ons from 'onsenui'; or import ons = require('onsenui'); since ngx-onsenui@4.0.0-rc.0.\nBut I feel like we should provide OnsenService so that users can use ons in their component templates, which corresponds to $ons in vue-onsenui.\nIn Angular, JavaScript code in component templates can access only its component class members, so it would be better to enable users to write constructor(private ons: OnsenService) {} and then (click)=\"ons.notification.toast('toast')\".. @yukisekiguchi \nThank you!\n@frandiox \nCould you check and merge this?. @frandiox \nI checked the guideline of snackbars and I have no new opinions about 1~4.\nGreat work!\nI would appreciate if you merge this PR after everything is done.. @anatoo @frandiox \nMaterial toast message looks a bit large compared to the image in #1908.\n\nIt seems that this is caused by a fix (cd7d975cd019e9f628189bb8b5f966e7b0d7a118).\nIs this a correct behavior?. @frandiox \nThis CSS issue was actually reported in #1991 and fixed by #1999.\nNow it should be fine.. Sorry, it's related #1991 but it was not fixed.. @anatoo \n--material-font still has a problem even after #1999 is merged.\nCould you check this?. @anatoo\nSorry, what I meant is this comment.\nIs this large-message problem already fixed?. @anatoo\nThank you!\nI will test it on real devices before release onsenui@2.3.0.. @frandiox \nThank you!\nFYI: Actually ons-select.js also has for...of but it's safe because if the expression after of is an array literal it is compiled into a code without Symbol.. @frandiox \nThis will help: https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-es2015-for-of#optimization. \u2668\ufe0f . @puku0x \nSorry for the delay.\nThank you for reporting!\nWe will investigate this problem as soon as possible, but we've been working on some pull requests. Please be patient for a while.... @Hirbod \nYes, it has been fixed.\n@puku0x posted a screenshot of Onsen UI 2.6.0 on Twitter: https://twitter.com/puku0x/status/910109182275096578. @anatoo\nIt sounds good but we have to support at least iOS 8+ and Android 4.4.4+.\nCan we support those old browsers with that native solutions?. @anatoo \nThank you for investigating!\nIt is a pity that the problem still remains on iOS 11 UIWebView.\nWe have to tell users to use ons.fastClick.destroy(); until UIWebView is obsoleted...\nFrom my point of view, I think your suggestion is fine \ud83d\udc4d . @frandiox \n\nI think WKWebView can be used in Cordova since iOS 9.\n\nYes, but the problem is most Cordova users don't know WKWebView and will use UIWebView as same as before.... @anatoo \nActually needsclick did not work in some environments \ud83d\ude13 \nSo I always recommend using ons.fastClick.destroy(). @frandiox (Cc: @anatoo @misterjunio )\nWe have several options about how to provide a variety of modules.\n\nOption 1: Provide UMD (bundled), CommonJS2 (bundled) and ESM (bundled).\n(Example: Vue)\nThis option is a straightforward solution.\nIn this option, we have a package.json like:\njs\nunpkg: 'js/onsenui.js',\nmain: 'js/onsenui.common.js',\nmodule: 'js/onsenui.esm.js',\nNon-ES2015 users can use onsenui.js with <script>.\nCommonJS2 users can use onsenui.js or onsenui.common.js as a CommonJS2 module.\nES Modules users can use onsenui.esm.js as a ES Module.\nNote: unpkg property prevents that https://unpkg.com/onsenui is resolved to js/onsenui.common.js.\n\nOption 2-a: Provide UMD (bundled) and ESM (bundled) with the extention .js.\nMaybe CommonJS2 will be replaced by ES Modules in the future, so I think we should not stick to providing a CommonJS2 module.\nIn this option, we have a package.json like:\njs\nmain: 'js/onsenui.js',\nmodule: 'js/onsenui.esm.js',\nNon-ES2015 users can use onsenui.js with <script>.\nCommonJS2 users can use onsenui.js as a CommonJS2 module.\nES Modules users can use onsenui.esm.js as a ES Module.\n\nOption 2-b: Provide UMD (bundled) and ESM (bundled) with the extension .mjs.\nAccording to this doc by Node.js and this post, it seems that Node.js might use .mjs as a default extension for ES Modules in the future.\nSo it might be better to follow this new specification (but personally I think .mjs is not an ideal solution...).\nIn this option, we have a package.json like:\njs\nmain: 'js/onsenui.js',\nmodule: 'js/onsenui.mjs',\nor\njs\nmain: 'js/onsenui',\nNon-ES2015 users can use onsenui.js with <script>.\nCommonJS2 users can use onsenui.js as a CommonJS2 module.\nES Modules users can use onsenui.mjs as a ES Module.\n\nPersonally I like Option 2-a, but it has a critical problem I think we should go with Option 1.\nWhich one should we choose?\nAny other possibilities?. @frandiox\nSorry, I made a critical mistake... \ud83d\ude05 \nx  Personally I like Option 2-a, but it has a critical problem I think we should go with Option 1.\no  Personally I like Option 2-a, but if it has a critical problem I think we should go with Option 1.. @frandiox \nUnlike Rollup, currently webpack 2 does not provide a feature to bundle multiple ES Modules into one ES Module, so we have to include all the files in core/src into onsenui package in order to provide ES Module through module property in package.json.\nDetail: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41289200/output-an-es-module-using-webpack\nDo you think it's acceptable?. I created a proposal: #2008. @frandiox \nI think it would be fine if navigator.removePage is provided since it is easy for users to find out from onsen.io.\nBut we have to release 2.3.0 soon, let's postpone it to 2.3.1 and later if we provide navigator.removePage.. @frandiox \nAh, I see.\n\nI think it is a very easy to implement method.\n\nActually I don't have enough knowledge to make changes to the core, so I could not estimate the cost. Could you implement removePage and related things? I am not sure if we need to make changes to the bindings as well.. @frandiox\nI have implemented removePage for both of core and angular-onsenui.\nI will merge this.. Thank you for reviewing!\nI will merge this.. @frandiox \n\ndescribing which polyfills are included\n\nActually I removed all the polyfills which Onsen UI has used so far.\nThe remaining libraries are non-standard ones and non-polyfill ones.\n\nwhich ones could be necessary for other browsers\n\nOnly IE11 needs polyfills, so I think we can skip this... (unless we start supporting IE11). I will merge this for now and I will write guide for older browsers later.. I found that this PR broke ons-navigator and other components on Safari.\nI have investigated this problem and the result is:\n- Actually MutationObserver polyfill depends on setImmediate and polyfills it as needed in these lines.\n- But Onsen UI loads MutationObserver polyfill before setImmediate polyfill.\n- As a result, both of MutationObserver polyfill and setImmediaate polyfill adds an message event listener to window.\n- Onsen UI depends on this broken setImmediate so far.\n- Therefore when I fixed setImmediate, ons-navigator was broken on Safari.\nI will restore MutationObserver polyfill for now.... Restored in 865f9543e9080b57f99bc7e358287fa956c155c1.. In this PR, the order of loading libraries has changed in the commit 9c0d0b03e819b6801d26393e4881f3520b1823e9 as follows:\nBefore:\nMutationObserver polyfill\nFastClick\nmicroevent.js\nsetImmediate polyfill\nviewport.js\nAfter:\nMutationObserver polyfill\nsetImmediate polyfill\nFastClick\nmicroevent.js\nviewport.js\nBut at least FastClick, microevent.js and setImmediate polyfill don't depend on each other, so I believe that this change caused no issues.. @frandiox \nYes, now users can remove unused objects in onsenui when building a bundle.\nBut I think tree shaking for onsenui is not as effective as we expect because onsenui provides only one object (default).\nI think tree shaking is effective only when a module provides many objects and a user picks few objects from the module like:\n[module.js]\njs\nexport const a = 1; // removed by tree shaking\nexport const b = 2; // removed by tree shaking\nexport const c = 3; // removed by tree shaking\nexport const d = 4;\nexport const e = 5; // removed by tree shaking\nexport const f = 6; // removed by tree shaking\n[entry.js]\njs\nimport {d} from './module.js';\nSorry if my understanding is wrong.. I will merge this for releasing 2.3.0 for now.\nIf something happens, I will revert this merge commit.. @frandiox \n\nActually, I think we were using init just due to some fix related to WebReflection's polyfill.\n\nYes, if we use WebReflection's polyfill, we cannot use constructor and have to use a ~class~ mediator method, but its name is not restricted to a certain name. So I renamed it to _init.\n\nNow that we changed to the other polyfill maybe we can use constructor. Do you think it is possible?\n\nYes, it's possible.\nI will try to remove _init.. @frandiox \nI think you already know but I found that this line in ascend-animator.jscauses a forced reflow.\njs\nthis.ascension = parseInt(cs.getPropertyValue('height'), 10) + parseInt(cs.getPropertyValue('margin-bottom'), 10);\nThis line\njs\nthis.ascension = undefined; // Calculated during the first animation\nsays // Calculated during the first animation but animators are created in this line\njs\nconst animator = this._animatorFactory.newAnimator(options);\neach time BaseDialog#_setVisible called.\nDo you think we can completely suppress this forced reflow?. @anatoo\nThe demo link works fine on my environment...\nCould you go to tutorial.onsen.io and choose JavaScript > Progress Indicators?. @anatoo\nThe version of my macOS Safari is 10.0 (12602.1.50.0.10).\nOK, maybe this is a bug of macOS Safari and it seems already fixed.\nThank you for checking!\nClosing this.. @anatoo \nThank you!!\nI will merge this after the CI passes.. @anatoo\nThis issue is also discussed in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/1864 .\nWe might require a lot effort to fix select component.. @rgins16 \nThis problem has been fixed in #2028 and the fix will be included in the next version of onsenui (2.3.2).\nThank you for reporting!\n. @airamrguez \nI checked the problem and it was reproduced on my environment.\n\nI will merge this and release react-onsenui@1.3.1. Thank you!. We can provide source codes transpiled to ES2015 (not bundled) instead of the raw source codes.. @frandiox \nSorry for the delay.\npageElement.scrollTop feels a bit confusing to me since pageElement already has its original scrollTop.\nIf it's acceptable, I prefer pageElement.content.scrollTop.... @frandiox \n\nIn the past, for example, we were mapping pageElement's style attribute to .page__background for the same reason.\n\nI see, in that case pageElement.scrollTop is better.\nThank you for the PR!. @frandiox \nThank you!\nI will take a look at and merge this.. @frandiox \nI have tested it and the black glitch disappeared, but a white glitch sometimes appears on Android Chrome 58.\nIf you have no Android devices now, I think it would be better to concentrate on some other tasks for now.. @frandiox \nI see, thank you!. @frandiox \nI tested the new revision, and it worked fine!\nI will merge this, thank you!. @frandiox \nYes, I meant that glitch.\nI will test it on the real devices and merge this.. @frandiox \nI have checked that the glitch no longer appears on iOS 8 (and other version of Android/iOS) \ud83c\udf89 \nI will merge this.. @airamrguez \nThank you for information!\nIt seems that the current react-onsenui uses prop-types@15.5.8 due to our yarn.lock:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/265a8c6cc61fec536006ce6c902b12ecdaee0da1/bindings/react/yarn.lock#L3839\nWe will update prop-types and release react-onsenui@1.3.3.. @airamrguez \nI just released react-onsenui@1.3.3 with the fix.

It's a simple app built for checking ng-repeat performance. I've just downloaded your sliding menu template and added ng-repeat list to the page1.html template as follows:\n\nThe list is long, about 500 items.

    "GC-Mark": "@nokturnal Any joys digging out that code? Im also struggling with the same scenario :angry: \n. I managed to figure out a solution which seems to work pretty well, I will extract the key code from my app and post it here...but not until early next week as i'm away for a few days\n. I was also having this issue. I have just built Onsen from the 1.1.x branch and inserted the build into my app and it seems to alleviate the blink issue :+1: \n. Actually, i am sure we are talking about different 1px lines. I am referring to the line above where it says O2-UK, not below the navigation-bar which i think you are referring to.\nAm i correct?\nYour fix in #326 doesn't remove the line I am referring to\nCC: @argelius \n. I can reproduce it on my iPhone 6 real device, but not the simulator.\n It's quite hard to track down as I there is no WebInspector for when running on actual device (that I know of)\n. Ah, but that doesn't work when running my app, only when running mobile safari :-1: \nIll try setting up a temporary local web server and run my app in mobile safari, see where that gets me...will report back in 10 mins....\n. Hmmm...when running my app through the PhoneGap app, in Safari it says No inspectable applications :confused: \n. Yes, because if i open a web page in safari, i can inspect those no problem, just not when running the PhoneGap app :/\n. Im running iOS 8 and Yosemite...weird\n. Just to be clear what i'm doing here.\n1) Run phonegap serve in terminal\n2) Open PhoneGap App on my real device\n3) Connect to IP address and port\n4) Open Safari on my desktop\n5) No application listed in the develop menu\n...yes?\n. * face palm *\nYep, working now :+1: \n. Found the culprit\nLook like it is caused by these box-shadow declarations in the sliding menu animation JS\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/53284830f37039edfda330b16fe50129dbf0b0a7/framework/views/overlaySlidingMenuAnimator.js#L52\nand here\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/53284830f37039edfda330b16fe50129dbf0b0a7/framework/views/overlaySlidingMenuAnimator.js#L231\n. Okay, so there are various ways of 'fixing' this.\nThe one i have opted for is to change the css found here - https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/3452cec0edb1fca574e28a1c513d3a89abc754dd/framework/css/sliding-menu.css#L28-L38\n...to this (added top: -1px)\ncss\n.onsen-sliding-menu__menu,\n.onsen-sliding-menu__main {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: -1px;\n  left: 0px;\n  bottom: 0px;\n  right: 0px;\n  z-index: 0;\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n}\n. The only other way was removing the box-shadow entirely.\ni don't know why the box-shadow is visible at the top, when everything is aligned top: 0\n???\n. Okay. So, for the time being, i have just removed the box-shadow. Doesn't really add anything to my app design anyway.\nI did manage to \"fix\" the problem by changing all instances of...\njavascript\nthis._menuPage.css('display', 'none');\nto\njavascript\nthis._menuPage.css('display', 'block');\n...in onsenui.js\nThis introduced a new issue though. When navigating to a new page, then hitting the Back button, the line reappears after the animation is complete. This might be a mobile safari bug though, as if I then go into the WebInspector and disable and re-enable the box-shadow property, the line disappears.\nAll very strange.\n. Okay, so I took the sliding menu starter kit from the 'Getting started` section of your website.\nAll I have done is added the following CSS to index.html\n``` css\n    .navigation-bar {\n      background-color: #222222;\n    }\n.navigation-bar__title {\n  color: #ffffff;\n}\n\n.page--menu-page__content {\n  background-color: #222 !important; /* main menu bg color */\n}\n\n```\nYou can download the project from here, and run directly using phonegap serve\nhttps://drive.google.com/a/mark-beech.co.uk/file/d/0B_8J5uGplRYGQUFmNmhuVXBfblE/view?usp=sharing\nI'm currently using an iPhone 6 running iOS 8.1.1\nThis issue doesn't appear in the simulator, or if you run the app through a desktop browser, it has to be on the device either via the phongap app or by installing the app directly onto the phone(phonegap run ios)\nYou will notice that the line is there on initialisation, but disappears once the sliding menu has been opened\n.

    "shaulhadar": "That would be great indeed:)\n. Hi Anatoo, I checked now for two days all types of transitions, and this is what I found out:\n1. When loading a page, the first time the transition happenes it has artifacts but the next time you do a page transition to the same page, it works correctly.  I don't know if it has to do with chaching of pages or something like this or it has to do with the animation itself.\n2. Sometimes when I press a push page button, the button takes some milliseconds , and than fires up the animation, and the animation back is quicker.... I assume onsenui has some kind of workaround for the 300ms delay on click events, but I am not sure, maybe it is somehow connected to this?\n3. When swiping slowly the sliding menu item, it takes a millisecond to respond, and than when swiping it back, it pauses for a millisecond before closing.... but if i press the menu button at the header, the animation works quickly and nice.... so maybe it is something about the touch events or something like this.\nThis is what i noticed......\nThanks for your time...\n. ok, i found out that it's because of the ionicons..\nall your pens are missing the cdn..\nhttp://code.ionicframework.com/ionicons/1.5.2/css/ionicons.min.css\nand also in your website, there is no reference for it so some of the demos don't show the icons at all...\nthanks...\n.

Hi Anatoo, I can see it is fixed now, thanks man , and great job :)\n. Hi Anatoo, I work on monaca in firefox version 32.   In the preview, it does this problem also...\nI used the onsen ui tabbar template in the monaca site ... the one that has a push page button and three tabs...  regarding my device, I use a LG G2 android kitkat 4.4.2 , and through the monaca high performace debugger, it still blinks when clicking on the home button, and redraws the whole header and navigation bar element...\nThanks man, and if you need anything else from me to check, i will be glad to help..\n\n.

I load the page HTML from javascript and then detect the post-push event, then I could access the input search, then once I could access it, I could detect if Enter key was detected.\nNow it works on everything!!!!\n. Ah okay, thanks!\n. @anatoo I know I could do that but what I was trying was to display an ad which generated by a block of javascript on the sub page, no matter how I tried it it doesn't show... I did on codepen and it worked though, not sure what's the difference when doing it in an app with Monaca IDE.\nEDIT: I found a solution. Instead of using a seperate physical HTML file, I used \"template\" instead and put that within \"index.html\", then the Ad rendered when I call myNavigator.pushPage(\"template.html\"), it it was a physical file, that call never render the Ad... not sure why... but for now, I'll be using template on index.html\n.

    "eecsxielu": "+1\n. @argelius Thank you! Would it be possible to implement this on ons-scroller?\n. Hi @argelius \nThank you for your efforts! To fully imitate native behavior, I believe sliding should also be disabled on main page when menu page is open.\nAdditionally, It is not a good experience when you scroll down your main page and at the same time you can open your menu just because you're not sliding directly down but to the bottom right direction.\n. Yeah, you can definitely slide to close the menu but you should not be able to scroll the content on your main page. If you have Gmail app installed, you can verify that you can do nothing on the main page except that you can slide to close the menu. In other words, the main page should be fully locked down.\n. Excellent! Seems like you have already asked or resolved many of my questions. We should be developing apps with very similar functionalities...\n. Thank you @Hirbod. I tried your method but if the content in ons-scroller is not long enough, the scroller does not bounce on overscroll either. Did I miss anything?\n. True, though not so elegant... Thank you!\n. Hi @argelius, same thing for ons.notification.alert. Currently you can scroll your background content when a notification is shown.\n. ons-page and ons-scroller both come with a css property \"-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch\", which enables native-like scrolling. You can disable this by using $('.page__content').css('-webkit-overflow-scrolling', 'auto');\n. @Wouter33 Same problem here.\n. ",

Hu, same problem here, Onsen2 + AngularJs,\nIs there any workaround or fix for that?\nMy app just published and I get a lot negative feedback from users\n. Sure, I attach some screen shots comparing on 4.2 and 4.4\np.s It's the same on Sim and Device\nalso when you try to open slide menu it comes and then it detaches from side of screen and then it gets back to proposed position (see 4-2_3.png)\nIn 4-2_1 the background is gone and style is somehow changed\nIn 4-2_2 main page is not loaded (it might be some (mine or yours) script which is not supported by 4.2 script engine and it prevents angular controller to run)\nIn 4-2_3 There is alight ui change, and one important weird behavior, by default when user taps on list item in menu it should shows sub items and when he taps on that tiny button in list items it should close the menu and loads the main screen. it's fine in 4.4, but in 4.2 it seems that tapping on that tiny button cascade event to parent and instead on closing menu and loading items it act as clicking on list item\nIf you are interested I can send you the apk to see the difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.

Although I get the alert.\nwindow.addEventListener('native.keyboardshow', keyboardShowHandler);\nfunction keyboardShowHandler(e){\n        alert('Keyboard height is: ' + e.keyboardHeight);\n        tabbar.setTabbarVisibility(false);\n    }\nThanks,\nJamal\n. @gtsopour \nThis did not work for me, I still see the tabbar with icons.\n. @gtsopour \nTried the code for Gist, now when the tabbar is loaded, the icons on both tabbar and home are hidden.\nCheers.\n. @gtsopour \nMy bad, pasted the controller in device ready. Now it works but a white background is placed above the keypad just like in your screenshot.\nGoing through this page https://github.com/OnsenUI/onsenui.github.io/blob/master/demo_dev/tabbar_hide_tabs.html on line 18 and 20, using hide-tabs attribute to hide the tabbar, in that example it works on page load. Checking if we can use this on keyboardshow event.\nCheers.\n. George,\nThis plugin (https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugins-keyboard) fixed the issue.\nCheers,\nJamal\n. ",

    "JcDenton86": "Ok..\nI tried it with modifier=\"top-border\" and changed to look native on Android...\n. Hi @argelius thanks for your reply, \nI am not using crosswalk on the Android version because it makes the app 23MB while it's only 5.5MB.\n. Imagine this, one of my pages holds a listview with at least 60 items. Selecting that page from the menu page is ok. That page has a navigator and selecting an item from the list pushes the child page with option values (title, image and description). This information is rendered to the child page which is similar to the 'shop details' page (http://components.onsen.io/patterns). I don't think that the DOM is large, however you think that I should put a timeout for a few milliseconds in order to perform the animation and then show the information passed? The image though is HD now that you are mentioning it. Has anything to do with that? Also, the page with the list passes the whole object to the child page e.g. \nng-click=\"pushPage(obj)\" ng-repeat=\"obj in myList track by obj.id\"\n. Trying with timeout indeed made it work better. Trying it with 'postpush' event, the image doesn't get rendered on the child page maybe because angular is not notified about the change on the $scope variable? while on $timeout it does.\n. Ok, calling $scope.$apply() on postpush showed the image. Maybe this should be done automatically from Onsen. Either way thank you @argelius. ~~EDIT: it showed the image only the 1st time visited the page. If I go back and select the same or another item I get the error: Cannot read property image of null.~~\nUPDATE: initializing the image outside the postpush event and changing the $scope variable inside the postpush event shows the image when navigating back and forth. Thanks. Should I close the issue?\n. @argelius I would like to share this because it might help others. Even the fixes provided above made the animations run smoother, still there were a few lags. Building the application using Intel XDK (https://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/tools) made it run even better and more smooth. \n. It gives you options and yes one of them is Crosswalk but i didn't built it using that option. I selected just Android. I don't know if they build it differently (because the size was reduced to 4 MB). Today I used that tool just from curiosity. I will check it more. Also before using that tool, another thing i did was to remove the Hardware Acceleration attribute from the Androidmanifest file (from my original project). That made it better too. You think it is better to remove it? Cause this feature is to make things smoother..\n. Thanks for your reply,\nI am able to sort my list with objects by a specific property. My problem is that the sorted list doesn't get updated in the view. While using $filter and orderBy the view updated when tapping on the button.\nYou are welcome\n. Wrapping my sorting code in a $watch updated the view, but only for the elements that hadn't been rendered yet or have been destroyed previously, which is normal because this is how lazy loading of content works. What I mean is that when I select to sort the list, the items that are in the view at the moment are not updated, while when I start scrolling the items that are getting in the view are sorted. When I scroll back the items that have not been updated previously, are sorted too (because they have been destroyed once they got out of view).\n. Any way I replaced the code with the previous version. My list has at most 200 items (each item has image, title & description - is a bit heavy), so loading part of the list (just a few items) and load more (with lazy loading images) as the user scrolls has better performance than lazy loading the whole list (destroying and recreating items has its cost). Any better approach or advice is welcome :)\n. Hi @argelius ,\nI forgot to mention that. I am using Android 5 and it's on my nexus 5.\n. Hi,\nI used the latest files from the repository and the issue didn't happen again..\nThank you\n. Thanks for your response,\nI' ll keep them on the $scope.on('$destroy'), but why the callback does not get called? \n$scope.navigator.off('postpush',function(){console.log('it will now show up on log')});\n. Thanks for the clarification! I am closing this now.. \n. Hi,\nI just found out that if I use persistent on that tab item then the error is gone? Is this the proper way to be used (tabbar and ons-pull-hook)? \n. Tried to add the tabbar outside of the <ons-page> element. Now it repeats rendering only the tabbar (not the rest of the layout - toolbar and content). Note: The code is separated in different files\n\n. Oh..! This is happening if I set active=\"true\" for a tabbar item. Removing active attribute shows only once but then I have two other issues. 1. It blocks the main content of the page - I have a carousel in that page with photos and when the tabbar is shown the carousel doesn't respond to touch gestures (you can see an example at the codepen link above). 2. the 1st tab item should be active because it shows the page navigated from the sliding menu, but moving around tab items, when going back on the 1st it does the same thing as having the active attribute but only each time I tap on it, instead of repeating automatically like before (navigate between photos and videos on the codepen link above).\n. I see. Thank you\n. Sorry wrong URL. I' ve seen that error and fixed it but I am having the same issue.\nSee this URL please.. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/aOOpQq\nVideo tab throws the same error\n. I was adding the closing tags at the end rather than after the tabbar declaration. One more thing, can you please tell me how the same can be done, if the files are separated (the page with the navigator is different file than the page with the tabbar)?.. (because I am getting the same error for the Videos tab no matter what I've been trying..) even after the changes you provided\n. Thanks Argelius. I' ll try an example on Plunker and post back\n. Hi Argelius. I' ve created a Plunker, but it seems that something is wrong and doesn't work as expected. The Plunker URL is http://plnkr.co/edit/l9Jy81GUlF99pTGCFcrG?p=preview. I've loaded Onsen UI packet and created two files that have the same code from Codepen but I get \"navigator is not defined\" error.\n. I managed to make it work. I should have wrapped the whole html file in a ons-template tag and the tabbar decleration in a ons-page tag. Thanks anyway for your support!\n. Based on the assumption that an Android mobile device has the word Mobile in the user agent string while an Android tablet doesn't (https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/user-agent), I created two functions that return true or false accordingly.\n```\nisAndroidPhone: function isAndroidPhone() {\n      return /Mobile/i.test(navigator.userAgent);\n   },\nisAndroidTablet: function isAndroidTablet() {\n     return !/Mobile/i.test(navigator.userAgent);\n   },\n```\nThat's how I am doing it right now (until you add it in Onsen). I could also check for the string Android just to make sure that it's firstly an Android device and then detect the type (for my project is only Android).\n. Hello @frankdiox. They are not the same as the Tablet function returns true if the userAgent has the String Android and not (!) the string Mobile. Check this fiddle: \nhttp://jsfiddle.net/wcjhzkhz/4/\nIs that what you are talking about? \n. Ok @frankdiox. Thanks! \n. @frankdiox , @argelius \nHi, I am bringing this up because I found that if you use crosswalk with a cordova application the user\u0391gent changes a bit.\nFor instance in my application the userAgent is this:\nPhone: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 5.1.1; Nexus 5 Build/LMY48B) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.135 Mobile Crosswalk/13.42.319.11 Mobile Safari/537.36\nand \nTablet: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 5.1.1; Nexus 9 Build/LMY47X) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.135 Mobile Crosswalk/13.42.319.11 Safari/537.36\nAs you can see both agents has the string Mobile but the difference is at the end of the string:\nPhone: Mobile Safari while Tablet: Safari.\nMaybe there should be a check 1st if the project is under crosswalk and then apply the rules accordingly. Like this for Android tablet:\nif(/Crosswalk/i.test(navigator.userAgent))\n    return /Android/i.test(navigator.userAgent) && !/Mobile Safari/i.test(navigator.userAgent);\nelse\n   return /Android/i.test(navigator.userAgent) && !/Mobile/i.test(navigator.userAgent);\nRight now what I do is this for Android phone:\n    return /Android/i.test(navigator.userAgent) && /Mobile Safari/i.test(navigator.userAgent);\nand this for Android tablet:\n    return /Android/i.test(navigator.userAgent) && !/Mobile Safari/i.test(navigator.userAgent);\nbecause I use the crosswalk plugin, so the check provided right now is not useful\n.

Hi @argelius \nI have checked your example code and it works fine at Android.\nMy example has the same problem, when i hide the dialog, the \":active\" animation works. but when I destroy the dialog, it doesn't.\nCould you have a check of your example code by \"dialog.destroy()\" at Android Phone.\nThank you for your support.\n. When click quickly, it happens 100%, but when click slowly, it doesn't.\n. @argelius \nI have tried code like this, which makes \":active\" works again.\n$timeout(function () {\n                dialog.destroy();\n            },100);\nI guess \":active\" works, but its parent DOM view is being destroying, so we could not see it.\nDo you have any idea to improve this problem?\n. capture is attached.\nThe problem is like this. \nFirst, the button is in onsDialog and click it will destroy dialog.\nThen, I test it in computer, before dialog is dismissed, color change will happens to show it is pressed.\nBut if I test in phone, before dialog is dismissed, color change will not happen.\nIf I touch down it in phone, color change will happen. (not touch up)\n. \n. \n. \n. @andipavllo   I build it with Android 5.0 and run it in Android 4.4 phone\n. @andipavllo \nIs it really smart phone's css bug?\n. call number is like these\n1. this._onChange setImmediate\n2. destroy\n3. _destroy\n4. logic in this._onChange setImmediate \nif (this._currentTarget) { this._positionPopover(this._currentTarget);}\n. the version of onsenui is v1.3.2 - 2015-06-03\n. @argelius Could you have a check of this problem, thanks.\n. Hi @argelius !\nI have checked source before and does not have the same problem.\nsetImmediate is not used before, so I think it is why this bug happenes.\nthis._onResize = function () {\n                    if (this._currentTarget) {\n                        this._positionPopover(this._currentTarget);\n                    }\n                }.bind(this);\n                window.addEventListener('resize', this._onResize, false);\n.

Materialize css\nMaterialize is among the first few frameworks that offer css and components built as per Google material design guidelines. It is the creation of students from Carnegie Mellon University and is available as free to use, open source framework, under MIT license.\nMaterialize css is a complete package for small projects as well as for building large scale websites and HTML5 hybrid mobile apps. It includes css for color, typography, tables, grids and also helper classes etc. to name a few. Materialize css also comes packed with css to embed responsive images and videos the design. The framework is detailed to the level that it includes css classes even for vertical alignment of elements on the webpage. \nWhen it comes to ready to use material design compliant components, Materialize includes Navbar, badges, buttons, forms, pagination and cards etc. and JavaScript implementation includes dialogs, parallax, modals, waves, tabs, pushpin, sidenav, ScrollFire etc., to name a few. \nThere are many projects using materialize css framework and running in production, check them out in action at - Materialize Showcase.\nMaterialize framework is built using SASS,  one can download source scss files and include selective css and components as per the project needs, download ready to use minified versions of complied CSS and JavaScript as well as refer css and javascript files from the cdn.\nRead more about Materialize CSS at the official website - materializecss.com.\n2. Material-UI\nMaterial-UI is another very professional grade and cleanly built framework that implements Google\u2019s material design. This one is the creation of engineers at Call-Em-All and they are currently using it in their own projects.\nDevelopers of the framework have made it available as open source under MIT license and they are maintaining it actively to ensure changes or new additions in material design guidelines are incorporated.\nMaterial-UI components run on top of Facebook\u2019s Reactjs library. Everything in the framework is a React component except for basic CSS classes for material colors and typography etc. This makes it a little difficult for non-programmers since one need to have a fair understanding of JavaScript, JSX syntax and basic React concepts. \nFramework is pretty much customizable and you can override style for most of the components by passing custom CSS classes as props (reactjs vocabulary) to the component under consideration. Roboto fonts are at the core of Material UI framework for a clean modern look and feel. Framework is built in less but sass version is available as well for download.\nMaterial UI is available as npm package, you can download the free material ui package here- material-ui package.\nRead more about Materialize CSS at the official webpage - material-ui.\n3. Bootstrap Material Design\nBuilt by Federico Zivolo, this one is definitely for all the bootstrap fans and also for anyone who is planning to start afresh with a new web project. It would not be completely right to call it a framework since it is a theme built using bootstrap 3 that implements Google's material design.\nIt comes packed with components and css compliant with material design guidelines and is so customizable that you can create almost any layout and achieve any design just by making minor configuration changes.\nBootstrap Material Design offers best of both the worlds, Bootstrap as well as material design. Bootstrap is the best framework for creating responsive websites at lightning speed and material design is the design philosophy that is raging at the moment.\nYou get Bootstrap elements dipped in material design, these include tabs, navbars, typography, buttons, progress bars, sliders, panels and anything else that is material design.\nThis is a definitive go without a second thought if you are among those who do not believe in building websites from scratch. Get the theme here and you are all set for your next web project with material design based UX/UI.\nRead more about Bootstrap Material Design theme at bootstrap-material-design.\n4. Angular Material\nRunning under the hood of AngularJS, Angular Material is a complete framework that implements Google\u2019s material design and provides reusable, accessible and well tested UI components based on material design.\nAvailable as open source under MIT license, Angular Material is created and maintained by none other than Google\u2019s team who created material design guidelines in collaboration with Google\u2019s Angular framework developers.\nAs you can expect, a framework in the Angular ecosystem would run on directives. All material design components are available as angular directives and services, behavior of components can be controlled by the use of attributes.  An example would look something like below - \n Disabled Button \nYou can customize typography, colors and other components using the theming layer of the framework. Angular Material also features grid system based on flex using which you can create any possible web layout you can imagine.\nAngular material package is available on GitHub and can be built using npm and Gulp, or alternatively, you can get the distribution files and install locally using Bower. CDN version of Angular material is available as well on Google Hosted Libraries.\nRead more about Angular Material at official website at - material.angularjs.org.\n5. Polymer\nPolymer is based on web components, the technology from W3C that allow to bundle up html, CSS and the behavioral elements in a fully encapsulated package which can be reused across the web by anyone.\nPolymer comes packed with collection of custom web components that implement Google\u2019s material design. At the core, you get paper elements collection that includes paper-button, paper-checkbox, paper-action-dialog, paper-dialog-base, paper-dialog transition, dropdown, menu, ripple, shadow, you name anything material design and you get that in Polymer.\nPolymer is one of the cleanest implementation of material design and is future proof since it runs on web components, the support for which is inherent to all new web browsers. Read more about Polymer at official website - polymer-project.org.\n6. MUI\nMUI too is available under MIT license, free to use, open source but is still work in progress. It is a very small package and not yet in the league of professionals. Framework is built grounds up with pure JavaScript. However, ReactJS and web components version is on the way for greater flexibility and wider compatibility.\nYou have the option to customize material design colors, breakpoints and font settings etc. by making changes in the source Sass files available in the package.  \nThe framework is under active development, not production ready yet but the roadmap looks very promising and one can definitely look back at MUI after a couple of months to give it a try.\nRead more about MUI framework at - muicss.com.\n7. Ionic Material\nIonic is an advanced framework for developing hybrid applications in HTML5, it is open source and free to use under MIT license. Ionic Material is aimed at developers working on ionic framework and is available as an extension library. This essentially ensures that ionic hybrid app development workflow remains the same and ionic developers get an option to incorporate material design experience in hybrid mobile apps, out of the box.   \nOne of the key differentiators of this framework is that motion, ink and depth is created using hardware accelerated CSS which gives you a big advantage in terms of performance. Other features include\nInk effects as you interact\nOption to extends Ionic classes\nOption to easily integrate with ionic directives\nOption to develop reusable themes around it.\nIf you are an ionic developer, there is no reason to look around for other material design frameworks or putting in efforts to create your own libraries from scratch. IonicMaterial is professional grade and actively maintained framework that seamlessly fits into ionic app development workflow.\nYou can check IonicMaterial in action here - ionic material demo.\nread more about ionic material design at  official website - ionicmaterial.com.\n8. LumX\nThis is another framework for Angular fans, built with Sass, Bourbon, Neat, jQuery and fuelled by Angularjs. Angular developers already have Angular Material which is top of the grade material design implementation but expect nothing less from LumX, created by Google cloud platform experts, LumaApps.\nLumX is fully responsive framework and uses core jQuery without any additional plugins to ensure better performance. This framework is still improving on and has a clear roadmap defined, let us see how well it competes with Angular Material and other material design frameworks in the days to come. \nRead more about LumX at official website- ui.lumapps.com.\n9. Nt1m/material framework\nNt1m is the creation of Tim Nguyen, it is a simple responsive css only framework that can be used in any web page or web app. Tim has taken a different approach and created css only implementation of material design components, to the extent possible.\nThis is a great effort and an absolute fit for small projects and for web designers who do not really like to play around with JavaScript. You just need to include the material.css file in your project or the minified version of it. \nRead more about Nt1 material framework at nt1m.github.io, or download the css at - material-framework.\n10. Paper\nPaper is a customizable theme that implements material design using Bootstrap, icons from font awesome and web fonts from Google. This is one of the themes offered by Bootswatch.com, created by Thomas Park and available to use under MIT license. \nLike Bootstrap material design, this one also gives you a head start with any new project, you get material design flavored base theme, ready to use, and options to customize it the way you would like to.\nKnow more about Paper Material Design theme at - bootswatch.com/paper, or get the theme here at Github.\n. thanks\n. ok ! thanks\n. ok ! \n. same issue , I was post to forum....... \n.

    "Ralpharoo": "@Wouter33 @eecsxielu Same problem here. You guys ever work this one out?\nI've tried the jQuery .stop() method but it still flickers / seems glitchy . Thanks for the speedy patch on this @frandiox  \nI've just started testing this and it's almost there but still not perfect. iOS still transfers the touches when they begin on the modal and the modal itself is not scrollable.\nOn the same Youtube example you will see that you can tap and drag on the model video and it scrolls the background. Before I was able to check which node type was the 'fastClickScrollParent' and determine if I wanted this scroll or not. Not sure how this might apply in your current touchmove event on the mask though.\nI currently have a swipable element in a dialog and if the user swipes anything but perfectly horizontally, it scrolls the background.  This makes this issue a lot more obvious for my users.\nLet me know if you need anymore info.\nCheers,. Thanks @frandiox for the pointers. \nAs you suggested, I've tried making larger scrollable views however when the view is scrolled to it's top/bottom extremity, the scroll transfers again to the page in the background. I tried to quickly adjust the view back to it's middle point but this leaves a pretty clunky finish.\nI've also tried to make the background mask bigger and scrollable, however, I cannot find any relationship between which element will scroll under the modal. It seems to completely ignore the z-index / hierarchy of the views and almost always scrolls the page in the background skipping the mask entirely anyway. \nAs mentioned before only thing that has worked is to adding \"-webkit-overflow-scrolling: auto;\" to all  .page__content's whenever a modal is visible. This works perfectly, however, causes flickering on iOS UIWebView and WKWebView. This flickering is almost worse the initial problem.\nSo it's no good news I am afraid. Let me know if you have any other thoughts to try out.\nCheers,. Awesome - Thanks for that @frandiox. We are using WKWebView across our applications so I'll update and give everything a test. Thanks again for your efforts, much appreciated \ud83d\udc4d  . Hi @asial-matagawa \nI've experienced flickering when switching -webkit-overflow-scrolling through iOS 9, 10 and now 11 as I have been using it as a patch to fix scrolling under modal views (ref https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/2220).\nI tested the latest version of OnsenUI this weekend on 11.1.2 and 10.3.2 and both flicker. Whilst I have not tested it within the WKWebView yet, this still flickered on iOS 9 and 10 (with my above fix).\nCheers,. Note; only seems to occur with animation as \"reveal\". The others do not react in the same way. For now, I can patch with a box-shadow on Push! \ud83d\udc4d . Hi again. Thanks for looking at this.\nYou are right, I was testing this in Chrome's basic 'Emulated Devices' as an iPhone X. I've checked again and this reports the window.screen.width differently in portrait and landscape. \nI now have the physical device and it always shows correctly in the original code. \nI guess this depends how strict you want this check to be. For me, I've kept this patch in as I develop 80% browser, 20% on the device - therefore need to see the browser act as an iPhone X in all cases.\nCheers,\nP.s. thanks for the iPhoneX efforts here by the way. It was really easy to integrate and looks awesome now.. Hey @asialgearoid - Just checking this now and it seems to still be apparent when using inputs within ons-tabbar pages. iOS still lets you tab to an input on the next or previous page. . Whether it is of value or not, I applied a patch our end get this working. Beside disabling the control (which led to styling requirements), I couldn't find any way to disable an element through plain CSS so that the Accessory bar would not tab to it.\nBest I could find was setting the element attribute 'tabindex' to -1 when their tab page was not active. You'll probably know a much better way :+1: . Thanks @frandiox - I have tried this but am getting some pretty ugly glitching when pushing pages containing a tabbar. \nAlso when swiping back from a tabbar page, to a page with a tabbar - the page is blank during the swipe. When progamatically popping a page back, the page is always blank for a split second too and subsequently appears with a flicker.\nCheers . Working perfectly. Thanks @frandiox . Hey @frandiox, thanks as always. I am still seeing this one in the latest development build but suspect it is based on the index / hidden tabs.\nI have two scenarios here where I can pretty much always see it;\n\nI load page with a hidden tabbar (using hide-tabs) while the content is loaded from the database. This always opens on the first tab though. The tabbar tabs could be shown before, or after the push animation finished based on device and database speed.\nI often load a tabbar on another index than the first. I can quickly set the active tab once the animation has finished, however, this looks untidy (but happy to do this if only option).\n\nI've checked and this still can be seen occasionally on Chrome but always on UIWebView and WKWebView. What'd you recommend I do?\nI can set up another test if you cannot replicate it.. Note; reverting back to 2.9.0 improves things significantly. Also, changing shouldAnimateToolbar on push to false seemingly helps. Not sure if that's related? Cheers. Hi @frandiox - It is still very apparent in 2.9.0, just not as prominent so not sure those changes could make the difference. It seems related to the the device and screen size, on our smaller iPhone X it is hard to spot - but an older iPad really suffers. I've rolled back further to 2.8.3 and its much much better. It only occurs when pushing a tabbar whose active tab is not the first. The other flicker on page push has gone away. Version 2.7.2 is the same but has other issues.\nMy best guess is that it is a delay between the animation starting and the entering page being shown / created. Before this, it just has a black square. Interestingly, the same occurs on page 'lifts' - expect the space is white. Adding in extra load (i.e. animating the toolbar) then could well be making this slower and therefore worse.\nVideo of both here (recorded on iPhone 7+ using WKWebView); 291&283.zip\nPulling the 2.8.3 video apart, you can see that the second load shows a black box before the entering page is made visible. Then the entering page appears and the animation continues as it should. \nBoth suffer pretty bad when the first tabbar page is pushed (with active index of 3). The black area almost makes it to about 75% of the screen before content is shown.\nIf I get time this weekend I'll have a look at this animation / load process but suspect you know it like the back of your hand!. Hi @frandiox - That sounds likely and a good idea. Something to note, the Android slide and push animation is much better, presume it is more lightweight?\nI have taken a look at the TabElement _loadPageElement method and implemented something that seemingly works. However, I am not that close to the intricacies of Onsen so not confident it is right!\n```\n{\n    key: '_loadPageElement',\n    value: function _loadPageElement(parent, page) {\n      var _this3 = this;\n      this._hasLoaded = true;\n  console.log('_loadPageElement::: ' + page);\n  return new Promise(function (resolve) {\n      var loadPage = function () {\n          console.log('_loadPageElement::: loadPage ' + page);\n          _this3._pageLoader.load({parent: parent, page: page}, function (pageElement) {\n              console.log('_loadPageElement::: _pageLoader Done');\n              if (!_this3.isActive()) {\n                  // Perf, fixes #2324 when active tab is 0\n                  pageElement.style.visibility = 'hidden';\n                  _this3._tabbar._loadInactive.promise.then(function () {\n                      return pageElement.style.visibility = '';\n                  });\n              }\n              parent.replaceChild(pageElement, parent.children[_this3.index]); // Ensure position\n              _this3._loadedPage = pageElement;\n              resolve(pageElement);\n          });\n      }\n\n      //Are we animating the navigator as part of the page creation?\n      var onsNavigator = util.findParent(_this3, 'ons-navigator');\n      if (onsNavigator && onsNavigator._isRunning && !_this3.isActive()) {\n          //Yes - wait for the animation to complete;\n\n          var onsPage = util.findParent(_this3, 'ons-page');\n\n          //Note I had to make this available to reuse previous logic;\n          //util._util$3 = util$3;\n          var _cleatListenters = util._util$3.onceOnTransitionEnd(onsPage,function () {\n              clearTimeout(_failSafe);\n              loadPage();\n          });\n          //Failsafe as I am not confident I haven't broken anything else! :)\n          var _failSafe = setTimeout(function () {\n              _cleatListenters();\n              loadPage();\n          },1500);\n      } else {\n          //No - No animation or this is the active tab so need to load it ASAP;\n          loadPage();\n      }\n\n  });\n}\n\n}\n```\nFrom an initial trial, this works well to resolve some of the issue. The console logs fire as expected, the first page is loaded whilst the other two wait for the page to finish it's animation before being loaded.\nIs this what you meant?\nCheers,. ",

All new components work with vanilla JS out of the box and almost all features of all the components now work with vanilla JS.  \nCheck the docs here:  https://onsen.io/2/reference/javascript.html\nBut also read up on a few of the most recent changes here in this example: https://onsen.io/blog/auto-style-app-onsen/\nSpecifically, you will see the ons-if component, which the docs say is Angular 1 only, but the example shows vanilla js.\n. @frankdiox Thanks for the better explanation than I did.  I completely missed the ons-if-\"xxxxx\" vs just the ons-if when I was writing earlier.  Either way, vanilla all the way!  Go Onsen Team!\n. That makes sense.  The actual problem lies in using navigator with a defined page, such as:\n<ons-navigator page=\"home.html\" id=\"myNav\"></ons-navigator>\nThen on ons.ready() or equivalent, doing:\ndocument.getElementById('myNav').pushPage('newPage.html')\nThis generates the error.  I am using a splitter and getting the error, but a navigator should do the same thing.  I have worked around it by using the show event listener with a global first run variable like:\nif (localStorage.getItem(\"currentChapter\") !== null && Boolean(firstRun)) {\n            firstRun=false;\ndocument.getElementById('mainNavigator').pushPage('content/'+localStorage.getItem('currentChapter'));\n        }\nAnd programmatic-ly setting the first default page.\n. Onsen does not have that tag other than material input.  A form in Onsen, is just a regular HTML form, so code it like normal.\n. I also can confirm this causes a weird glitch on the device.  I have also found a way to override it that is odd in its own right:\nThis code makes the center div too big and the right div too small (I used no CSS nothing but onsen tags in a new project with the nightly but also confirmed on beta 9 with the same issue):\n<ons-page id=\"page-email\">\n     <ons-toolbar>\n                   <div class=\"left\"><ons-icon icon=\"md-close\" size=\"24px\"></ons-icon></div>\n                   <div class=\"center\"><ons-progress-bar></ons-progress-bar></div>\n                   <div class=\"right\"><ons-icon icon=\"md-close\" size=\"24px\"></ons-icon></div>\n               </ons-toolbar>\n            </ons-page>\nThen by adding a simple style tag to the right div, it fixes the issue:\n<ons-page id=\"page-email\">\n               <ons-toolbar>\n                   <div class=\"left\"><ons-icon icon=\"md-close\" size=\"24px\"></ons-icon></div>\n                   <div class=\"center\"><ons-progress-bar></ons-progress-bar></div>\n                   <div class=\"right\" style=\"background-color:red\"><ons-icon icon=\"md-close\" size=\"24px\"></ons-icon></div>\n               </ons-toolbar>\n            </ons-page>\nI was using the background color to see the divs without the progress bar as my first thought was the progress bar had a min-width that was overriding the other css, but leaving the progress bar in and then just adding the background-color to the right div also fixes it without even adjusting any div's width via css.\nEdit:  It fixes it in flat design but not material.\n. Just responded on Gitter, but how would Onsen know that you repacked the files?  Those are built-in pointers.  Comparing class names on build would be a tremendous burden to the compiler.  Additionally, I for one do not repack them and if they change Onsen to support that, then it would mean everyone else would have to change their default behavior for what is an expected result, i.e. ons-icon. \nOn a side note, are you see a drastic performance increase by doing this or is it a personal preference?\n. But that is exactly what is happening.  In onsenui.css:\n@import url(\"font_awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css\");\n@import url(\"ionicons/css/ionicons.min.css\");\n@import url(\"material-design-iconic-font/css/material-design-iconic-font.min.css\");\nAll of this is within the Onsen CSS folder.  If you are copying the Onsen CSS to another file, then you would also need to grab those.\nMaybe I don't understand, I just don't see how this is an Onsen issue.  If you are modifying their code for your project, wouldn't you then be inducing the problem?  From CLI or Cloud, creating a project with node creates that folder that has all their required files in it that they are importing.  You only have to require one file as they do all the other linking via import.\n. I do understand what you are saying and you are saying exactly what I am trying to point out.  This is not an Onsen issue.  As you have stated, you are using Gulp to compress your files.  It is Gulps issue, hence why they have gulp-cssimport, gulp-concat-css, and lots of others.\nOnsen also includes angular and react now, which I strip out for my production apps to reduce overall size;  BUT I do not think that Onsen needs to remove that just to fit my project needs.  That is all I am trying to say.\nEach persons / companies project needs vary and to call it a bug, it would have to affect everyone which I do not think it does.  Just my two cents.  That is all.\n. Can this be closed as I believe there isn't any further discussion?\n. I don't know what all your code is as you haven't posted it; however, this is valid code verified on the RC.\n<ons-navigator id=\"mainNavigator\" page=\"splitter.html\">\n  </ons-navigator>\n  <ons-template id=\"splitter.html\">\n    <ons-splitter id=\"mainSplitter\">\n      <ons-splitter-side page=\"content/menu.html\" side=\"left\" swipeable collapse=\"portrait\" width=\"200px\">\n      </ons-splitter-side>\n      <ons-splitter-content page=\"home.html\">\n      </ons-splitter-content>\n    </ons-splitter>\n  </ons-template>\n. @argelius No problem.  The docs do need to be corrected because they appear to indicate that it works for top and bottom.\n. YES PLEASE!!!  I would love include and repeat especially if I can make it play with VueJS.  Create element would be my alternate to repeat because I can loop and use that, which technically I already am doing, but I digress.\n. So, to add some insight on how I would be using createElement, it comes down to variations - which to be honest, there are lots of ways to do it.  As @frankdiox mentioned, let's just use a to-do app.\nYou can use v-for in the view portion of your code, modify the dataset and refresh your view and that works great EXCEPT for when I want to do conditional templating.  Say my list is mixed.  Some images, maybe a form based on an image, or just text.  While you can do that with some creative view templating, it is much much easier to just do it in JS by dynamically creating your elements and then push them to the DOM.\nNow, for ons-repeat, it is something that I would normally (and take normal with a slight grain of salt as I just started using vue.js ever since @argelius mentioned it) utilize v-for with; however, as my post history indicates, I am inherently against adding frameworks to frameworks due to  compatibility issues, etc.  So, if Onsen team decided to add ons-repeat, I would be happy to use it.  It is not a deal breaker for me, but it definitely has some significant advantages.\nThe same kind of goes for ons-include.  I am sure I could use it, but for the moment I am having difficulty coming up with how I would use to the fullest.  I would hope that I could define a template that has specific JS and that it would run via include.  If not, then I am not exactly certain how much of an impact it would make in my code (yes, I know I went all caps of excitement in my first post, I am running on caffeine fumes at the moment :o)\nAs far as templating goes, I do agree that any proper templating engine has some format to pass functions and  it should be added; having said that however, I have developed so many workarounds for it nowadays, I am not certain how desperate I am for it, but it is one that would make much cleaner code and provide a better MVC adherence.\nOk, I will cease my rambling.  Thanks again guys / gals for all the hard work that is being done on Onsen!\n. Do you need the icons and such to be on the other side of the device as well or just the strings to be reversed?\n. Curious, the new HTML5 standard has input type=\"date\" which resolves to native date picker in iOS and Android.  Is the requirement a different date picker than what is already available and supported by ons-input?  I tested both on Android and both work.\n. It would be nice if they auto bound, but I think this is actually by design.  List items could contain all sorts of items and it would be hard to know what everyone is adding.  I usually just add a click event listener on the list-item and then have it modify the state of my component.\n. How did you create the Onsen project?  This usually appears when the Onsen directory is messed up.  If the project is created via the CLI or Cloud, then the project is imported/created correctly.  Usually, I see problems like this when projects are being manually created.  Can you confirm that the Onsen directory has the aforementioned files in their appropriate path?\n. Modals don't need to be inside a page as they are callable templates.  Have you tried moving them outside and just be stand alone snippets?\nEdit:  I have just used your code with no issue on my machine.  Windows running Chrome.  It did not elevate my CPU at all.  Are you invoking this into a navigator or such?\nEdit 2:  Also, your example should really be formatted as such:\n```\n\n\n\n\n<ons-modal id=\"md1\">\n    <div>test 1</div>\n</ons-modal>\n<ons-modal id=\"md2\">\n    <div>test 2</div>\n</ons-modal>\n\n```\n. Can you provide what is not working?  Here is a codepen I threw together and everything is working as anticipated.  https://codepen.io/anon/pen/OXwQaL\n. Sorry for the late reply, but yes Onsen is behaving as it should.  What is happening, is that on open, my guess is that you are only pushing the one page to the stack, meaning it only has the 1 item and nothing to go back too.  Hence, the back button is missing.  The easiest fix would be to push the main page first and then the page you want.  You would probably need to show the splash screen a bit longer until this is done, otherwise the users will see a very brief flash of the first page.  Hope this helps - even though it is late.\n. This appears to be answered by @IliaSky here:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38796616/onsen-ui-infinite-list-setting-the-modifier-as-longdivider-does-not-work\nIt appears to not be a bug due to your background color choice blending in.\n. @rgins16 No apologies needed!  Just one big happy community trying to help everyone out and keep things organized so the Onsen team can focus on getting 2.0 out completely and bring us neat new cool stuff!\n. I guess I am on the opposite side of this.  I do not want this feature as a default, because then I am going to have to disable it 99% of the time.  If it was an attribute to set to true, then fine, but I would prefer to just code the form submit in JS because of user input validation.  Just my opinion.\nEDIT:  I guess I could see the use of the type attribute so you could set it to submit or button.\n. I would prefer the type attribute, this way the default behavior is just a markup button.\n. This is already a function, resetToPage(page, [options]).  The documents discuss it further here: https://onsen.io/v2/docs/js/ons-navigator.html\n. @qifuren1985 I don't think there is a method where Onsen would know what arbitrary page you want to pop to.  You would either need to pop then push, as you work through the sign up, or delete the stack and then push back A and B.  It's just not possible for a method to know where you want to pop too as it will change for every use case.  \nThe only way I can \"maybe\" think of pulling this off, would be to use the pages attribute to copy your stack, know how many you want to pop, strip those off your copy of the array, clear the navigator, and then move the array back to the stack.  This is totally untested theory.  Maybe some of the Onsen team have a more elegant way of doing it.\nEDIT:  OR!! (a random idea came into mind), use 2 navigators.  So your stack would be A -> B -> D.  D is just a page with another navigator on it.  Within D you would then push C1 -> Etc.  Then all you do is pop D and you are right back to where you want to be.\n. @qifuren1985 Onsen doesn't have anything like that, that I am aware of.  That would need to be added.  Paging @argelius and @frankdiox for input.\n. Are you mixing vanilla JS with AngularJS?  Which do you prefer to implement for this?\n. @frankdiox Awesome, this is right in line with my thinking.  I was trying to figure out if there was a controller loading this with Angular and I was going to suggest after attachment to the DOM, then instantiate the pullhook listener; otherwise, if it was vanilla, then obviously the item doesn't exist and is probably returning undefined for null.\n. @svdoever I agree 100% that documentation is necessary for development and advancement.  I would also like to note, that like you, I have abandoned many products due to overall issues such as, lack of documentation, to early for release, or lack of support.  I say that to argue on behalf of the Onsen team.\nTheir product is hands down the simplest to implement.  Yes, there are some deficiencies but their team has been amazing at working around the clock to address them.  Also, Onsen 2.0 is still in beta (in release candidate stage actually) and I might add is open source.  I have been trying to help out in the documentation side for Vanilla JS and if I knew more about TypeScript I would help out there.  \nWith that, I would like to point out these great resources that users can also help out with.\nhttps://community.onsen.io/ - Great forums with lots of activity and information\nhttp://tutorial.onsen.io/ - One area of documentation that users can contribute\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI - All of the repos where you can change the actual documentation for:\nhttps://onsen.io/v2/docs/js.html\n. @svdoever Thanks and I as well want them to succeed.  I had posted in the forums all the different platforms that we went through before we got to Onsen and now everyone in my group who is using it, only wants to use it.  We believe that Onsen crushes Ionic, et. al.  Ionic definitely is more established, but I think if we all help out, then Onsen will become the powerhouse on the block.  \nAlso, glad my answers help.  I just started trying to give back because it was originally @frankdiox , @argelius, @IliaSky and @philolo1 who really helped me in the beginning and I saw people having the same questions as me, so I figured, since I know (I think I do! lol) the answer, lets share the knowledge.  Unfortunately, I am a Vanilla dev and all these new frameworks are foreign to me so when people have questions about Angular, React, Meteor, TypeScript, etc. I have no answers.\n. With Onsen and Monaca you can!  Just use the import option described here:  https://docs.monaca.io/en/manual/dependencies/custom_cordova_plugin/#custom-cordova-plugin\n. @dnish Although I have not tried this plugin, I did find several that can be used with React and also do not require onClick handlers.  Maybe these could help out!  Googling for haptic plugins found a bunch.\nhttps://github.com/VVelda/device-feedback\n. @argelius Yes it happens without float.  So basically my test is, brand new project using baseline template (no custom anything), just add an input field with a placeholder, use the default material style on Android and it happens as the images show.  If you force the style to ios, it works fine on Android.\n. With the following:\n<script>  \n        ons.disableAutoStyling();\n</script>\n. Good catch.  I will work on it right now and put in a PR.\nEdit:  A PR has been submitted to resolve this.\n. Sweet!  Was just going through the example files.  Love the bindings!\n. @juspriet I will look at your code, but below is fully functioning code on both platforms for me.\nEdit:  I don't really see a difference between yours and mine.  What type of device?  I used an iPod Touch 4th Gen with most recent update.\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnsen UI Forum Help by Munsterlander\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI-dist/2.0.0-rc.18/css/onsenui.css\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"all\" />\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI-dist/2.0.0-rc.18/css/onsen-css-components.css\">\n<script src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI-dist/2.0.0-rc.18/js/onsenui.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"components/loader.js\"></script>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPush Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack\n\nPage 1\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n. Hmmm, that is odd.  Hopefully someone else can try some other devices.  I used the Monaca debugger to test.  Are you building the app?  Is there anything in the console?\n. @jakwarrior When I view your codepen, it shows it is still using 2.0.0.  If it was updated to 2.0.4, that may resolve your issue.\n@angelcasellas I use the show event.  That way you know it has been loaded.. Just curious, why would you nest navigators instead of just using one to push pages too?  It just feels to me like the app navigation stack is incorrect, but hey, whatever works for your app.  So, what error is generated in the console?\nEdit:  I have confirmed the issue as well, here is a codepen:  https://codepen.io/anon/pen/RRrqyL\nI assume this has to do with the fact you are pushing a page with an ID and when you push it again, you are attempting to recreate a navigator with the same ID which already exists in the DOM but was not cleared from the page stack.  Again, I question the need for this navigation pattern.\n. @SharkChips Interesting that it started in 2.0.\n. @SharkChips Interesting as I just tried it with RC.17 with the updated code I posted and it will not work as anticipated on Chrome or Mac.\n. @SharkChips I updated the codepen again to try to track down what is going on, what is very weird is that the page count increases but you lose the animation after you push to nav1.  If you reset everything and then just push to nav2, you get the animation and the count increases.  I wonder what stops that from happening.  Very weird indeed.\n. @andreujuanc Just curious, what would you want?  How else would you expect a web application to function?\n. Fork this one:  https://codepen.io/munsterlander/pen/rWWvNN. What do you mean by overlay?  Are you doing a modal over the carousel or a dialog with the carousel?  Can you post a codepen with what is occuring?\n. @josekenya I am confused as to what is not working.  Here is a working example with dynamic data.  https://codepen.io/anon/pen/KNMVJm  If you push the page and then use the back button, you will see the time does not change.  If you push the page again and then pop the page, you will see the data is refreshed.\n. Hmm, well I would assume you have a pathing issue based on the 404 obviously.  Onsen, to my knowledge, doesn't make calls to external files after it is loaded.  My base recommendation for users new to Onsen is to develop your app like a single page web site (template tag files are really just includes, utilize AJAX processes, etc.)\nI would assume based on your code that after popping, you are going back to the index.html file where the schedule.html file does not exist as it is in a different folder.  While this should not matter, I wonder if you have an empty stack once popped?  Are you removing pages prior to pushing them?\n. I am not certain if this is doing something that Onsen was not designed for and thats why we had issues or there is just a bug.  Either way, having 2 splitter menus definitely causes some bugs.. @mjessen This is already accomplished with JS and CSS.  I guess it could be implemented, but it is pretty easy to do.  Here is how I did it:  https://github.com/munsterlander/Onsen-Examples/tree/master/Accordion-List. Onsen is currently at 2.2.6.  You definitely need to update and that will solve your issue. . Do you have a stripped down version of your code that demonstrates the issue? What onsen components are you using? Are there images? . I love most of everything but only have a few concerns.\n\nRegarding the template tag, my concern is that it would suggest Onsen can load any template and display it.  With the ons-template, you know it is Onsen only.  This may be a very small concern and with the overall user feedback, maybe it is what people want.\nPlease add preload!!\nI know many users have requested the ability to run script tags, I am for one not sold on the idea.  I think life-cycle hooks are the better way of supporting this.  I personally do not like mixing my components, even though I do not adhere to SoC strictly.\nI do think standardizing event names to onInit, onShow is good.\n\nAll in all, keep up the amazing work!  I am sure I will have to relearn things, but progress is important to stay versatile.\n. ",

Thanks, @frankdiox ! Just for now i've made a workaround. Flickering is still there, but not so ick :)\n<ons-navigator style=\"background: #fff;\">\n</ons-navigator>\n. I think my strategy of the fix may be applied on tabbar too. I'll try to fix it, maybe in the evening.\n. I've investigated, that the problem is with using a promises in getPageHTMLAsync and getTemplateHTMLAsync. They should be synced when template already in a templates cache. Then a ons-navigator's main page will be initialized synchronously (within the same run cycle that _appendMainPage called) and no flickering will be appeared.\nI also found that loaded templates with getTemplateHTMLAsync is not cached internally after first load. I put all my templates to internal templates cache with customized gulp-angular-templatecache and that would be enough with synced templates getting for throw away the flickering.\n. It's a part of the problem, but it does not solve it completely. In _pushPageDOM of the ons-navigator is another async callback, and i don't understand why it must be there?\nIf i remove the setTimeout all works fine with no flickering.\n```\n        this._compilePageHook.run(function (element) {\n          _this9._linkPageHook.run(function (element) {\n            setTimeout(function () {\n              if (_this9._pages.length > 1) {\n                var leavePage = _this9._pages.slice(-2)[0];\n                var enterPage = _this9._pages.slice(-1)[0];\n            _this9.appendChild(element);\n            leavePage.element._hide();\n            enterPage.element._show();\n\n            options.animator.push(enterPage, leavePage, done);\n          } else {\n            _this9.appendChild(element);\n            element._show();\n\n            done();\n          }\n        }, 1000 / 60);\n      }, element);\n    }, element);\n\n``\n. @Hirbod , check my latest commit, no flickering detected in ons-navigator with cached templates. I also fixed atab` element, it means you problem maybe fixed too.\nI have only one problem \u2013 tests not passed, broken within iOS animation, but manual test of all transitions does not detect any issues with it.\nUPD: on a device (iPhone) flickering is still there :(\nUPD: it's because NavigatorElement's attachedCallback invoked NOT after append on iOS.\n. Sure! \nWhen switching in menu between page1 and page2 on iOS (reproducable in simulator) inline toolbar and content on page2 does not moved down immediately. See a gif in #897 \n```\n\n\n\nNo navigator there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      ...many items...\n    \n\n\n``\n. No problem, @argelius \nSorry for my style of commit names and other style problems. If you decide, that my fix is useful, i may recreate commits with your style guides.\n. No, flickering is still there with your fix.\nI think your fix is fifty-fifty, especially on mobile devices. There is a risk that between 40ms main page of navigator will not initialized. But my conception works in any situation.\n. We are discussing React/Preact compatibility with OnsenUI. There is an example of broken mutation of a DOM with onsen and react: https://github.com/developit/preact-webcomp-test\n. @philolo1 interesting. I agree, that simple components without any logic (ons-button, etc) does not need to be reimplemented. React works well withclassandstyle` attributes mutated directly. But time needed to reimplement this component is very small. Much more time needed to implement harder components, like \"ons-splitter\" or \"ons-carousel\". I have looked at your work and it is not seems to work in \"react way\". A lot of React.render and dom mutation is not a good idea with React.\nAlso i think that OnsNavigator is useless in a big react application. My navigator implementation is a special RouterContext for react-router. It makes possible to describe a whole application structure in a declarative way, and navigate just with a general links:\njavascript\n<Router history={browserHistory} render={props => <OnsNavigatorContext {...props}/>}>\n    <Route path=\"/\" component={PageA} flat>\n        <Route path=\"/test\" component={PageB} />\n        <Route path=\"/another\" component={PageB} />\n    </Route>\n</Router>\nIt is very cool feature, in my opinion.\n\nWe want our framework to be as agnostic as possible, so if we would implement everything in pure react component, people would not be able to just use pure javascript.\n\nI understand it. As i said, React may be replaced with Preact and packed to a bundle. Over a Preact components might be implemented WebComponent binding, that is easier to implement, then React binding for WebComponents. \nTo conclude. A \"react binding\" may be called so only if developer can achieve all benefits of both worlds \u2013 React and OnsenUI. In my opinion, there is no way to do that with WebComponents as a core, because any \"react binded\" component is just a hacky hack. If core implemented with React, there is still a problem to make a binding for Angular. I think there is a place for two (or three) libraries, based on same CSS Framework and some little codebase (fastclick, animation, back button, gestures), but with very different components implementation.\n. I found answer in a doc, sorry\nHTML\n<div class=\"list__item__left\">\n          <label class=\"checkbox\">\n            <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"checkbox1\" class=\"checkbox__input\" name=\"c\" checked=\"checked\">\n            <div class=\"checkbox__checkmark\"></div>\n          </label>\n        </div>\n        <label for=\"checkbox1\" class=\"list__item__center\">\n          Checkbox\n        </label>\n</div>\n.

I just have couple of questions regarding this ons-splitter.\n1. How to include the splitter side from external file? like we could do in split-view with secondary-page=\"path/to/file.html\"? Is it possible? I currently use ng-include for that.\n2. I saw the blog post on this. I tried it myself and it works fine. But the nice thing about ons-sliding-menu was the menu actually shifts the main content aside to appear, but the split-view's splitter side overlays the content. It would be great if we could have control over this behavior. Is it possible?\n. any comments on this?\n. ",

Hi,\nThank you for your great job.\nI started developing an app with Monaca based on \"Onsen 2.0 Quickstart\" sample.\nI noticed that \n- ons.notification.alert\n- ons.notification.confirm\n- ons.notification.prompt\ndid't work on my iPhone6s/iOS 9.3.1 when I updated from Onsen UI 2 Beta.9 to Beta.10.\nHowever, they worked fine on my Nexus6/Android 6.0.1.\n. Thank you very much !\n. Unfortunately, I found this problem happened on iOS too.\nHow to reproduce\n1. Create a page which has an ons-carousel component.\n2. Push a page which has a text input tag.\n3. Rotate the orientation of the page.\n. I confirmed that the issue was solved on both iOS and Android since Onsen UI v2.0.5.\nThank you very much !!. +1. Quick fix in case of using ons-toolbar-button.\n<ons-toolbar-button ng-click=\"navi.pop()\">\n    <ons-icon icon=\"ion-ios-arrow-back, material:md-arrow-back\" size=\"32px, material:24px\"></ons-icon>\n    <ons-if platform=\"ios other\" class=\"back-button__label\">Back</ons-if>\n</ons-toolbar-button>. You should use 'pushedOptions' to get the page arguments when you are using Angular 1.\nvar args = navi.topPage.pushedOptions; // Not documented yet\nvar title = args.title;                // For example\nMoreover, you should not use Onsen UI 2.0.5 with Angular 1.\nIt has a terrible bug in the navigator component, it's better to use 2.0.4 with Angular 1.. Thank you @frankdiox for your advice.\nUnfortunately, I could not find  the data field in topPage object  in angular-onsenui since  Beta.10 .\nAnd have you ever tried 2.0.5 with Angular 1 ?\n- <ons-template> is broken (since RC.18 ?)\n- topPage.pushedOptions returns previous page's one (in 2.0.5)\nI wrote a pen, this will show the reason why I said it terrible.\nhttp://codepen.io/puku0x/pen/OWyQry\n(It does not work well on Chrome because of the <ons-template> bug, please use Firefox). A-ha ! That's what I wanted !\nThank you very much, @frankdiox !. @frandiox Wow, it sounds good !\nSometimes I stacked because ons-init called my initialize function two or three times when a page was loaded.. Although this is not a solution, you can ignore above error by setting silent:true.\n/* postcss.config.js */\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    require('postcss-import'),\n    require('postcss-url'),\n    require('postcss-cssnext'),\n    require('postcss-simple-vars')({\n      silent: true\n    })\n  ]\n}. I found my PR is not enough to solve this problem, therefore I cancel it.\nI will make another issue for ons-list-header.. @frandiox Thank you for your advice. \nThe example is simple and easy to understand for me.\nHowever, I would like to put a FAB in a tab page content like Hangouts app.\nIs there any way to realize it without breaking Onsen UI's design phylosophy ?\n\n. @frandiox Thank you !. @anatoo Thank you for your response.\nHowever, I think the previous one also looks good because it is similar to iOS's list header \ud83d\ude42 \nIf you have time, could you consider providing both styles of header ?\n(Like Ionic's ion-list-header and ion-item-divider, for instance). @anatoo Thank you very much !. Thank you @frandiox for investigating this.\nI will use cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine !. @frandiox Thank you for the information. I will try it !. Why are you using RC.17 ?\nSelect (ons-select) is available on 2.1.0 or higher.\nI think running npm update may solve it.. Is there any progress for this issue ?\nAs you can see, the flicker bug makes UX worse \ud83d\ude22 \n\n. @frandiox Thank you !\nI'm looking forward to the next release.. @asial-matagawa Thank you for your quick response !. How about setting parentScope to the dialog ?\njs\nons.createDialog('dialog.html', { parentScope: $scope })\n  .then(function(dialog) {\n    dialog._scope.message = 'hello !'; // should work\n    dialog.show();\n  });\nhttps://codepen.io/puku0x/pen/yzYRxJ. @asial-matagawa\nThank you for your reply.\nI\u2019m looking forward to the next release.. How about injecting ElementRef of the page and hooking onInfiniteScroll like this ?\n```ts\n@component({\n  selector: 'ons-page[one]',\n  ...\n})\nexport class NewsComponent implements OnInit {\n  constructor(private element: ElementRef) { }\n// Infinite scroll\n  this.element.nativeElement.onInfiniteScroll = (done) => {\n    // this.loadMoreNews(done);\n  };\n}\n```\nhttps://github.com/puku0x/ngx-onsenui-kitchensink/blob/master/src/app/pages/infinite-scroll/load-more/load-more.component.ts#L31-L33. Unfortunately, I could not reproduce the issue \ud83d\ude1e\nThis is my procedure\n1. npm install -g @angular/cli\n2. ng new ngx-onsenui-sample --style=scss\n3. cd ngx-onsenui-sample\n4. npm install onsenui ngx-onsenui\n5. Import css files into style.scss\nscss\n/* You can add global styles to this file, and also import other style files */\n@import \"~onsenui/css/onsenui.css\";\n@import \"~onsenui/css/onsen-css-components.min.css\";\n6. Make a page with ons-icon\nIt works with no error.. Thank you @asialgearoid for your reply.\nI'm looking forward to the next release.. Hi\nYou can use a <div> with position: absolute instead of onsen-carousel-cover in Onsen UI 2 like https://github.com/OnsenUI/vue-onsenui-kitchensink/blob/master/src/pages/Carousel.vue#L57-L65\nCheers,\npuku. Hi\nDo you mean you have an one-navigator named sNavigator, and you want push the page menuItem1.html ?\nI think you already have \"sNavigator\" variable in your 'index.html', like this.\n<one-navigator page=\"<your-root-page.html>\" var=\"sNavigator\"></ons-navigator>\nTherefore, you faced the error.\n(I don\u2019t recommend using var in script tags, though)\nHere, you have three solutions.\n\n\nRemove var from your \"text/one-template\"\n\n\nUse one-template tag instead of script tag\n\n\nMake a menuItem1.html in the same directry of index.html\n\n\nIn any case, I strongly recommend reading official Onsen UI reference  and starting from a minimal sample.\nRegards,\npuku\n. @swanandj91\nYou can use ng-repeat to create dynamic list if you are using Onsen UI with AngularJS.. @swanandj91\nHere\u2019s a sample of ng-repeat.\nhttps://codepen.io/puku0x/pen/eMQXgj. @asialgearoid Sure! I will take a look.. @asialgearoid Thank you!. @asialgearoid Yes, I think it is needed that ngx-onsenui's form directives should support reactive forms for all input types.\nI noticed that some of them already have ControlValueAccessor. The remaining directives need to be implemented it.\n\n[x] ons-checkbox\n[ ] ons-input\n[x] ons-radio\n[ ] ons-range\n[ ] ons-search-input\n[x] ons-select\n[ ] ons-switch\n. @asialgearoid I updated my PR.\n[x] ons-checkbox\n[x] ons-input\n[x] ons-radio\n[x] ons-range\n[x] ons-search-input\n[x] ons-select\n[x] ons-switch. Based on above conversation, I added handler related to registerOnTouched.. Thank you @emccorson and @asialgearoid !. Talking about Angular, ngx-onsenui is using v4 now but the current Angular is v5.2.x and v6.0.0 will come soon.\n\nI will make another PR for updating dependencies later !. @J261 \nHow about replacing Onsen UI related <script> tags from <body> to <head> ?\nhtml\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html ng-app=\"example\">\n    <head>\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/onsen-css-components.min.css\">\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"css/onsenui.min.css\">\n        <title>example</title>\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/angular.min.js\"></script>\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/onsenui.min.js\"></script>\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/angular-onsenui.min.js\"></script>\n    </head>. @asialgearoid \nNo I didn't. I think there are no any other problems for now \ud83d\ude42. Oops, there is a problem in compoent-loader.ts.\n_rootComponents property has omitted from ApplicationRef since Angular v5.\nI'll update my PR soon.. @asialgearoid \nnpm run test was successfully passed on my local machine.\nHowever, CI failed because the latest Angular CLI requires Node.js v8 or higher \ud83d\ude22. @happyi \nYou need a controller when you use ng-click.\nhttps://codepen.io/puku0x/pen/WyQVdW\nMoreover, I recommend using ons.notification.alert() instead of alert().\nCheers,\npuku. @brunobg \nYou can replace your node_modules/onsenui/css/ionicons/* to the latest package.\nionicons.zip\n!CAUTION!\nThere are breaking changes in Ionicon v4.\nSome icons are renamed and you have to specify the platform like ion-ios or ion-md.\nBefore:\nhtml\n<ons-icon icon=\"ion-navicon\"></ons-icon>\nAfter:\nhtml\n<ons-icon icon=\"ion-ios-menu\"></ons-icon>. @asialgearoid OK, I see. I'll try it !. @asialgearoid \nI added a test and update example for tabbar.. @asialgearoid Yes. I'm preparing for the PR now \ud83d\udc4d. I made a pen for reproduction because it seems the demo link is broken.\nhttps://codepen.io/puku0x/pen/dKgNLo\nIt works without Vue framework binding, though \ud83e\udd14\nhttps://codepen.io/puku0x/pen/mKzWBB\n. I found page-with-bottom-toolbar class was missing when using v-ons-page with custom class.\nCurrent workaround is to add page-with-bottom-toolbar.\nhtml\n<v-ons-page class=\"random classes page-with-bottom-toolbar\">. It fixed the problem. Thanks @asialgearoid !. @asialgearoid I will create a PR for this issue \ud83d\udc4d. GitHub has some trouble. I can't create PR for now \ud83d\ude2d\nhttps://status.github.com/messages. @asialgearoid I agree with the idea.\nWe can focus on the core functionality of Onsen UI by separating AngularJS binding.\nI think putting an npm message is useful for migration too!. Thank you!\nI'm trying to solve the problem!. Yeah, I think it\u2019s worth to investigate upgrading Font Awesome from v4 to v5.. As pointed out by #2491, Font Awesome's .fab class conflicts with Onsen UI's .fab.\nCurrently, I specify ons-fab and button considering the use case.\ncss\nons-fab, button {\n  &.fab {\n  }\n}\nThis can handle following situations. \nhtml\n<button class=\"fab\"><i class=\"fab fa-twitter\"></i></button>\n<ons-fab>\n  <i class=\"fab fa-twitter\"></i>\n</ons-fab>. Specifying element as a selector (e.g. ons-fab.fab) makes such warnings.\nWe can ignore linter by adding some comments.\ncss\n/* stylelint-disable */\nons-fab, ons-speed-dial-item, button {\n  &.fab {\n  }\n}\n/* stylelint-enable */\nThis looks dirty but keeps backward compatibility for now.. I think the best way is to add prefix like ons- to all classes.\nHowever, it makes huge breaking changes (there may be a possibility to bump to 3.0.0).. @digish777 \nUnfortunately, no. We should use only ons-navigator for now.\nI tried using Angular router with Onsen UI but it was difficult because I could not use transition animations without <ons-navigator> and OnsNavigator injection token was not created until <ons-navigator> was rendered (you will see StaticInjectorError when you set routes and resolvers).. I heard Ionic v4 could use with Angular router.\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic\nIt is still beta version, but it may worth trying it!. Anyway, thank you @digish777. I found ngx-onsenui used ReflectiveInjector, which has been deprecated since Angular 5, during I was investigating this issue.\nThis means ngx-onsenui will not work because ReflectiveInjector will be omitted in Angular 7 which is planned to be released in this November. I will make an issue for it later!. @digish777 \nons-navigator is.\nYou can handle the routing events such as prepush, postpush, prepop, postpop.\n```ts\n@Component({\n  selector: 'ons-page[page1]',\n  templateUrl: './page1.component.html',\n  styleUrls: [ './page1.component.css' ]\n})\nexport class Page1Component implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\n  constructor(private navi: OnsNavigator) {}\nonPrepush = (event) => {\n    console.log(event);\n    if (someGuardConditions) {\n      event.cancel();  // Cancel pushPage\n    }\n  }\nngOnInit() {\n    document.querySelector('ons-navigator').addEventListener('prepush', this.onPrepush);\n  }\nngOnDestroy() {\n    document.querySelector('ons-navigator').removeEventListener('prepush', this.onPrepush);\n  }\ngoToPage2() {\n    this.navi.nativeElement.pushPage(Page2Component);\n  }\n}\n```\nhttps://onsen.io/v2/api/angular2/ons-navigator.html. How about using HttpInterceptor and OnsNavigator.resetToPage() ?\nI think it is better to use onsNotification.alert() or onsNotification.toast() for such case, though.. Oops, I forgot OnsNavigator could not be injected until <ons-navigator> was rendered.\nIf you are using NgRx or some Flux libraries, you can dispatch an action,\n```ts\nimport { Store} from '@ngrx/store';\n@Injectable()\nexport class ErrorInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {\nconstructor(private store: Store) { }\nintercept(request: HttpRequest, next: HttpHandler): Observable> {\n    const req = request.clone();\n    return next.handle(req).pipe(\n      catchError(res => {\n        switch (res.status) {\n          case 500:\n            this.store.dispatch(new ShowErrorPage());\n            break;\n        }\n      })\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\nand show the error page.\n```ts\nimport { Actions, ofType } from '@ngrx/effects';\n@Component({\n  selector: 'ons-page[page1]',\n  templateUrl: './page1.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./page1.component.scss']\n})\nexport class Page1Component implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\n  private readonly onDestroy$ = new EventEmitter();\nconstructor(\n    private store: Store,\n    private actions$: Actions,\n    private navi: OnsNavigator\n  ) { }\nngOnInit() {\n    this.actions$.pipe(\n      takeUntil(this.onDestroy$),\n      ofType(PageActionTypes.ShowErrorPage),\n    ).subscribe(() => {\n      this.navi.resetToPage(ErrorPageComponent);\n    });\n  }\nngOnDestroy() {\n    this.onDestroy$.emit();\n  }\n}\n```\nIt looks too much complex. I recommend to use onsNotification.alert().. It seemed to be fixed in the recent update.. Angular v7.0.0 was released \ud83c\udf89\nReflectiveInjector is still available but it is marked as deprecated.. You can use onsPlatform to check the device type.\nhttps://ja.onsen.io/v2/api/angular2/ons.platform.html\n```ts\nimport { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';\nimport { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';\nimport { onsPlatform } from 'ngx-onsenui';\nimport { AppModule } from './app/app.module';\nimport { environment } from './environments/environment';\nif (environment.production) {\n  enableProdMode();\n}\n// iPhone X fix !!!!\nif (onsPlatform.isIPhoneX()) {\n  const html = document.documentElement;\n  html.setAttribute('onsflag-iphonex-portrait', '');\n  html.setAttribute('onsflag-iphonex-landscape', '');\n}\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)\n  .catch(err => console.log(err));\n``. Which kind ofnotification` ?\n\nDialogs\nLocal notifications\nPush notificaions\n\nFortunately, you can use @ionic/native . It is easy to use for Angular users.. Here this is it!\nhttps://ionicframework.com/docs/native/dialogs/\nHowever I recommend to use onsNotification which is better for debug.\nts\nimport { onsNotification } from 'ngx-onsenui';\nonsNotification.alert('Hello World!');. You have  three options for solving the problem.\n\nDon't implement it\nUse navigator.app.exitApp() for Android\nCreate a Cordova plugin for it\n\nI recommend you to ask https://community.onsen.io/ and I would like you to use the GitHub Issues for a bug report or a feature request.. You can write it navigator['app'].exitApp(), alternatively.. @masahirotanaka \nThank you for your comment.\nI'd like some of you guys to review and merge my PR because I'm not authorized to merge it.\nWho should I assign as a reviewer?\n. @masahirotanaka  I see.

Hmm, I have no idea why the time out occurred.\n@asial-matagawa Could you re-run the CI, please?\n. @georgeMuraveiAlkh Thank you for your report.\nIt seems similar issue happens on not only Angular but also Vue.js.\nCurrent work around is to add <div class=\"center\"></div> inside of ons-list-item.\n```html\n\nTappable / Ripple\n\nTap me\n\nChevron\n\nChevron\n\n\n``. @georgeMuraveiAlkh I found the variablelistwas not defined inAppComponent`.\nI think that was why the code did not work for you.\n```ts\nimport {\n  Component,\n  OnsenModule,\n  NgModule,\n  CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA\n} from 'ngx-onsenui';\nimport {platformBrowserDynamic} from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app',\n  template: <ons-page>\n    <ons-toolbar>\n      <div class=\"center\">Lists</div>\n    </ons-toolbar>\n    <div class=\"content\">\n      <ons-list>\n        <ons-list-header>Default</ons-list-header>\n        <ons-list-item>\n          <div class=\"center\">\n            <ons-select>\n          \u3000   <option *ngFor=\"let i of list\" [value]=\"i\">{{i}}</option>\n            </ons-select>\n          </div>\n        </ons-list-item>\n        <ons-list-item>Item B</ons-list-item>\n      </ons-list>\n    </div>\n  </ons-page>\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  list = ['One', 'Two'];  // Here!\n}\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [OnsenModule],\n  declarations: [AppComponent],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA]\n})\nclass AppModule { }\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);\n```\nCheers!. @jcfrane \nThank you for your report!\nI will investigate the problem later.. @jcfrane \nThe error message said Angular compiler misunderstood that onsLazyRepeatOf was a some kind of events like onclick then it suggested (sLazyRepeatOf), which could be written on-sLazyRepeatOf (of course no! \ud83e\udd23no way! )\nI think you forgot importing OnsenModule to your AppModule.\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/ngx-onsenui-issues-2579\nts\n@NgModule({\n  imports:         [ BrowserModule, CommonModule, OnsenModule ], // <- this is it!\n  declarations:    [ AppComponent, Page1Component ],\n  entryComponents: [ Page1Component ],\n  schemas:         [ CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA ],\n  bootstrap:       [ AppComponent ]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }\nHope it helps.. @jcfrane  Sure! Please do not hesitate to ask me.. @masahirotanaka Thank you for your reply! I hope it will be fixed soon\ud83d\ude4f . @masahirotanaka Thanks for the info. I'll reinstall Onsen UI later.\nBTW, why the gulp-protractor was in the dependencies: {} in package.json? I think it's not required for the end-users.. @emccorson Thank you for telling me about the details. I'm looking for the next release.. Aww, CI said some permission error was occurred and rsync was not found.\nsh: 1: rsync: not found. @emccorson Thank you for providing me the detail. I used rsync for copying the outputs of ngx-onsenui schematics because it is installed on my macOS too. I think it is well-known command to copy files and installing rsync is a feasible solution for the problem.. @asial-matagawa Thanks for your report. I'll check it later.. I guess it was because of the version of Angular was too old, tho.. @asial-matagawa @emccorson \nI found the configurations for rxjs were incompatible to RxJS v6.x.\nI sent a PR to fix the problem. Could you review and merge it tomorrow?. Yes, it is required by ControlValueAccessor interface.\nhttps://angular.io/api/forms/ControlValueAccessor.

I guess it will be the same i 5.1.1\n@MateuszWilk can you please provide an example?\n. @ramingar you are welcome, let us know if you have any other issue :)\n. I added a listener on the touch events, all the events are recognised, except the vertical touch events, like scrolling and swiping. Despite that, the vertical touch actions seem working.\n. @danish-jamil this issue has been fixed with Onsen UI 1.3.1, as you can see from the changelog.\n. More info in this Stackoverflow post\n. @argelius fixed\n. seems working fine in onsen 1.3.3 dev\n. @argelius  I fixed it\n. @argelius yes, exactly\n. @anatoo is ok now?\n. @argelius yes sure, I'm already working on it!\n. @argelius I have added the test\n. I rebased the commit ;)\n. Thank you @anatoo ! I have tested it on last chrome release and demo/tabbar/index.html demo.\n. The active tab test is already there, from row 120. The active attribute is on ons-tab element, so I'm implementing the test in ons-tab.specs.js\n. Hi @condorman,\nthat issue appears only on the emulator and we are already aware of it.\nNevertheless, we have tested it on physical devices (Lumia 630 and 930) and this problem doesn't occur.\n. @argelius I fixed this and made a pull request\n. yes, I will check this\n. @argelius I applied the changes you suggested\n. @mateusjatenee I guess you are using a sliding menu. In the sliding menu, the back button, once pressed, just closes the menu so it should not be considered a bug.\n. @arzanardi we will investigate immediately!\n. @bmcmillan thank you for the hint!\n. @arzanardi @bmcmillan I just tested the buttons and they seem working well in our Demos, would you mind posting a not working code sample?\n. I just tested Onsen 1.3.8, which is also included in Monaca, and it seems working fine.\n. Thank you, a feedback would be appreciated :)\n. Fastclick was updated after Onsen 1.2.2 release and everything seems working fine with Onsen 1.3.8 so we cannot consider this a bug.\n. @synapse  I'll take a look at it as soon as possible. As @argelius already said, an example would be appreciated.\n. @synapse I checked the first issue you reported. The bug is Onsen 1.3.10 but the 1.3.10 dev works fine. Maybe it's cause of the web components, maybe not, I have found sono differences also between other files (views and angular directives). I'll also check the second bug you reported as soon as possible.\n. @synapse I also checked the second issue that you reported, but it seems working as it should. After you add the attribute, you should rember to compile the element using ons.compile() function.\nHere is an example:\nvar tab = document.getElementById(\"tab3\");\ntab.setAttribute(\"active\",\"true\");\nons.compile(tab)\n. I will work on this in the next few days\n. @anatoo no problem! I forgot, tested on LG G3 Android 5.0\n. > I can't get this performance problem on Nexus7 Android 5.1.1. But I removed some possibilities of performance bottleneck for ons-splitter-side's interaction and animation just in case. Can you check for this problem on your android device?\nThe performance has improved a lot, well done! There is a small performance issue when opening the menu, I make a video so you can understand better:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq_8sPRmu3o\nMy device is a good one, so should not be related with it.\n\nIn \"portrait\" screen orientation, it should be correct behavior. \"ons-splitter-side\" elements on \"split\" mode should show self always.\n\nI understand, thank you for the explenation.\n. Yes sure, I'll test it immediately\n. @anatoo Seems that you merged the branch, so I tested on master. Unfortunatelly, the performance seems to be the same, tomorrow I'll test also in a more low performance device to see if it's just related with my device or it's a general issue.\n. @anatoo I didn't notice it before, I thought you merged everything. I tested fix-915 branch and the performance is the same\n. @anatoo I also tried on a Galaxy S3 mini with android 4.1.2, same issue\n. @danfador can you please provide an example? I have an Android 4.1.2 device so I can test it\n. Same here!\n. Dear @chriskaya, thank you for reporting this. We need to check it but, if you want, you can make a pull request by your own and we can review it :)\n. Thanks, we will take care of it then :)\n. @argelius the issue is located in core/vendor/setImmediate.js, should we modify it even if it's an external resource?\n. @salztorte in your case, was it getting bugged with exactly more than 80 items or it's just an indicative number?\n. @argelius I'm going to send you an example privately\n. @argelius are you sure it doesn't work? In my forked repository it works well, same here:\nhttps://onsenui.github.io/OnsenUI/demo/navigator_inside_tabbar/index.html\n. It looks very nice, but probably it would be quite hard to implement :)\n. @argelius I just applied the edits and tested everything using angular, everything seems working fine!\n. @Hirbod thank you for reporting this! I'm actually not sure that the issue is related with us, it seems more related with CodePen. Anyway, we will investigate because it's very important for us to have all the CodePens examples working.\n. @ehlaumarc please provide some code, it's impossible to help you otherwise. Also, you can take a look at this tutorial about how to integrate Google Maps into Onsen UI.\n. Well, I have placed my map inside an ons-page element, exactly like you, with no issue. Which element breaks it? The ons-list immediately below? Is there any error in the console log?\n. I was using Google Maps Javascript API 3 and Onsen 1.2.1 (the tutorial is from February). I cannot understand where the problem is, the structure seems fine. No errors are displayed? Please try using Onsen 1.2.1 and let me know if it works. \nAlso, take a look here:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/31092907/google-maps-v3-in-cordova-onsenui-app-map-displays-in-browser-but-not-on-phone/31099018#31099018\n. @Hirbod which version of Onsen UI are you using? I just tried with the master version and everything seems working fine\n. @Hirbod I just tried it also for 1.3.11 and it works fine in my case. Which browser have you used to test? Can you also try with the master version of Onsen? Can you provide a working CodePen example that simulates the wrong behavior? Thank you for your cooperation.\n. Yes I did, I tried it on chrome. A CodePen example would be appreciated.\n. @Hirbod thank you very much for reporting this, I'll fix it immediately. For next time, please use the Improve this doc banner on the top-right of the documentation page :)\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/onsen.io/issues\n. @Hirbod yes please, open another issue :)\n. sorry, I missunderstood, I'll open it again\n. @Hirbod you are right about this, we should probably implement it\n. @Hirbod I tried to replicate this but I couldn't. Actually, sliding-menu-ignore=\"true\" is not working at all for me. Here is a CodePen example, please let me know if there is something that should have been implemented differently to reproduce the issue.\nhttp://codepen.io/andipavllo/pen/MaVORN\n. Oh, you are right, sorry for the mistake. I'll take a look at it.\n. @Hirbod thanks for all this reports, we will investigate. Anyway, if you want, you can also implement the fixes by yourself and make a pull request :)\n. @Hirbod please open a new issue for any bug you find, otherwhise it's easy to miss something\n. @argelius sure, I'll take a look at it today\n. @d3orn Are you using the lazy-repeat with an ons-list? If yes, is there any specific reason to add the list inside ons-scroller? It will already scroll by itself.\n. I like Fran's proposal more than a new button tag :)\n. sound good to me! :)\n. @argelius should be ok now\n. @argelius oh I see, do I still need to fix the CSS? I had no time to do it in the last few days.\n. ",
    "d3orn": "any update on this? I have the exact same issue\n. $(.'page__content').scrollTop = 0 works, but you have to be careful to select the actual page__content and not the page__content element of the menu (if you have one).\nTry adding a class to the correct page__content from within chrome developer tools and then try the scrollTop.\nBut there should probably be a way to tell LazyRepeat to reset the offset\nExample: angular.element(document.querySelector('#people .page__content'))[0]?.scrollTop = 0\npeople is the current pages id\n. ah I figured if I wrap the ons-list with an ons-scroller it works on windows as well\n. No problem!\nBTW what about ons-lazy-repeat scrolling those not work there either on WP (should I create a new issue?)\nEDIT: I still had the -ms-touch-action: none....\n. Hi @argelius!\nThanks, I figured as much, tell me if I can help somehow (and where to look)\n. @argelius Yeah I just tested it on iOS (works fine) but Android still has the error. Is there a way to implement this without using ons-template? We are currently using 2 templates for tabbar and 1 for dialog.\n. disabling debugInfoEnabled in Onsen 1.3.17 still throws this error\n. well this fixed the misplaced content. Thanks a lot!\n. I guess that was a fix for windows but as far as I can see at the point of writing it works in windows without the scroller so I will just go without it.\n. @luposlip Are you using cordova and especially the device plugin? I have the same issue as soon as I start using the device plugin. Removing it brings back the old behaviour\n. I will look into it. Maybe there is a bug. Will keep you posted if I find the error\n. @argelius as far as I can see 'isIOS' and 'isIOS7above' both try to use the cordova device plugin but they do not wait for the device ready event which is needed for the plugins to work. If you can tell me how you did this for other things I can try to fix and pr it. \nIn Onsen1 you were only using 'window.navigator'\nP.S because we are using the plugin device is an object but it has some undefined values if cordova is not ready it looks something like this: Device {available: false, platform: null, version: null, uuid: null, cordova: null\u2026}\nP.S.S I have a possible fix. Will PR it as soon as I am done implementing then you can review and tell me if it is alright\nP.S.S.S I will try to rewrite 'shouldFillStatusBar' to return a promise it this is ok for you @argelius \n. fixed! will PR this tomorrow need some rest 10h work day xD\n. mhm my fix somehow breaks orientation detection on my Samsung Note III, but only on the first load after I reload the app or restart it it works....\n. yeah I know the code I posted was the generated HTML. Thanks a lot for those changes\n. Thank you Sir!\n. looks like the page__status-bar-fill is not correctly added but I hope this provides a start for you guys.\nAlso platform browser does not work correctly because it has the device plugin but not the platform iOS when running in dev mode ios xD\nI have no time this week to further look into it sry\n. Well I added a console.log to each of those functions but it seems as if they are not called / defined. The if-else is correct.\nLogging the methods on iOS resulted in 'undefined'\n. Yeah exactly, I have been working on an Angular Attribute Directive, but it is not perfect yet. How should I proceed? \nI can finish it and PR so you guys can decide what to do with it?\n. Removing -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; form page__content resolves this but makes scrolling terrible on iOS (as expected xD)\n. I have found a fix for this issue what do you guys think? I can try to implement it into Onsen\nhttps://github.com/attitude/scrollPolyfill.js\nEdit: This make the scrolling non-elastic....\n. Thanks for the feedback. But what do you do with fabs on iOS? Do you plan to have a special representation for those or just consider them not being used at all? (Which wouldn't make much sense, because a App should run on both platforms) I believe fabs are a very nice design principle and they start to show up on iOS as well (Gmail for example).\nWell to be honest I hope all the MD principles show up on iOS soon xD\n. Nice, I will go with your fix for the time being.\n. ",

    "IliaSky": "It seems that this issue has been fixed in 1.3.1, so I'm closing it.\n. It seems that in ons.compile we are trying to use angular.element(...).scope(), which returns undefined while debugInfo is disabled. \nI looked though most commits between Sep 4-7, but wasn't actually able to find the fix. It was added to the changelog, but maybe the fix itself was in another place and might have been overridden, I'm not sure. As it stands now it looks like the issue still persists. \nSome libraries seem to be overriding $$addScopeInfo themselves, basically enabling the scope() even when debugging is disabled. I'm not really sure how it was solved in our case last time. \n. @komachi - I guess the fix was lost somewhere along the way. It has just been reapplied, so it will be available in rc.8.\n. @PvanHengel \nI seem to be unable to reproduce it. Here's a demo which again loads first with zero items and 1 second later adds them and it seems to be working fine. Maybe there is something specific in you code which triggers the issue.\n@OmarHassan25 \nClosed issues and github in general is not the place for such questions. We have a community and stackoverflow for questions. \nAnd now the answer - you just need to set the calculateItemHeight property of the delegate which you are providing - you can set it to a function which returns the height for the item at the specific index. \nOur docs recently changed but that's something which was documented in both the new and the old docs.\n. The issue has been fixed, even though we are planning on removing ons-scroller soon.\n. It's already implemented in 2.0 exactly as @frankdiox described it.\n. Thank you for the pull request @danjarvis, but actually we decided to just remove the .page__bottom-bar-fill element altogether. It makes no sense to add an element simply for the purpose of changing the styles of it's siblings - adding a class to the parent can serve the same function. Thus around 3 weeks ago we removed it.\nOnce again thank you for your help.\n. @argelius are you still able reproduce the issue?\n. @corneyl Hmm, even with the same configuration [Onsen 2 RC 9, react 15.1.0, react-onsenui 0.2.21] I seem to be unable to reproduce the issue (both the toolbar and the list render fine). \nI tested it on Android 4.0.4 and 4.4.2. Might be something specific for 4.1.2...\nThe other option would be if there is something else which triggers it. Even though it's such a simple case, would you mind posting the exact code which you're using?\n@philolo1 - maybe you may have a better idea what might be the problem? \n. @argelius Thank you very much for the review.\nAfter applying the suggested changes I guess GestureDetector seems to be the main bottleneck. I am not sure if I should try to use it in a way which tries to share the instance across all ons-ripple elements or if it would be better to try to make that optimisation it from the GestureDetector class itself.\nTo me the second option seems more reasonable, but I could be wrong. And I think it should be possible, but I haven't looked too deeply into the implementation, so again I could be wrong.\n. It should be finished, but I have a test failing in CircleCI. I fixed it locally, but on CircleCI it still fails.\nMaybe there is a missing gulp build in css-components, which is making the problem over there, but I'm not 100% sure.\n. Hi @cskiwi, and sorry @leocaseiro and @cither1 for the late answer:\nThis one's on us. It seems we forgot to remap some methods. Generally the way we try to make the bindings work is wrap the initial logic, but keep the old one safe. Here I guess that may not be an option since $templateCache is for angular and there is no way for the core to try to access it. sliding-menu was working because it's an angular-only component. \nWe will probably fix this relatively soon, but until then there's an easy patch to make everything work fine:\nangular.module('app').run(function($templateCache, $onsen, $onsGlobal) {\n  $onsGlobal._internal.getPageHTMLAsync = $onsen.getPageHTMLAsync;\n  $templateCache.put('home.html', '<h1>Home2.html</h1>');\n});\nIt's hacky and we should be the ones doing this,  but for now this can help you in your current project.\n. Hi pvsong,\nI seem to be unable to reproduce the issue. By default there should be no delay. \nSince you say that the page changes for a while, then maybe it's just that the animation takes too long - by default it's 400ms. That duration is configurable - you can set it to 150ms or 200ms so that it fits your expectations. You can try something like this:\njavascript\napp.navi.resetToPage(\"detail.html\", {animation: 'slide', animationOptions: {duration: '0.15'} });\nIf the problem still persists after tinkering with the duration settings you can also check if there is a delay with animation: none. If that's the case please inform us, so that we can investigate the issue.\n. Since this is already a question and not an issue I am closing this.\nWe can continue the discussion in the community.\n. Thank you for the bug report. The bug should be fixed in beta 8.\nHere is an working example of what you want to do using beta 8. \nAlso note that in the case when the page attribute is a valid page Onsen will put that page instead of whatever content you have inside the ons-splitter-side - that means that if it finds the page then your content inside your second example will be replaced with the page (just so you know).\nSide note: I can see that you really tried to put the html inside a proper code tag with indentation - instead of having a single ` backtick at the start and end of each line you can wrap the whole thing with triple ``` backticks. Alternatively if you just put an empty line and then indent the code by 4 spaces you should get the same result. ^_^\n. yes\n. Thank you for the report. This should be fixed when we release beta 7.\nIn the meantime you can use this ugly hack:\njavascript\nonsSplitter.addEventListener('dragstart', function(e){\n    if (e.gesture.direction === 'up' || e.gesture.direction === 'down') {\n        onsSplitterSide._getModeStrategy()._ignoreDrag = true;\n    }\n});\nonsSplitter and onsSplitterSide being the ons-splitter and ons-splitter-side elements.\n. You're welcome. The fix is already in place, so feel free to use the newer version when it becomes available. I am closing this issue.\n. Thank you for the issue. This has already been fixed in the newer beta versions.\nFeel free to use beta 6.\n. ok\n. The source seems to be the transform: translate3d - I guess scrolling hardware accelerated elements does not yield good results in earlier versions of Android. This behaviour would still persist even in the newest beta version. Since we don't seem to be taking advantage of it here maybe we can remove it for ons-button? \nWhat do you think @argelius ?\nThe text placeholders for the inputs also have transforms, which seem to be making the scrolling issue. In theory we could try to enable them only in newer browsers etc, but I'm not sure if they're worth using for small elements if they cause so much issues.\n. It has been fixed on another branch. The fix will probably be merged and available in either beta 7 or beta 8.\n. ok\n. Actually it wasn't working simply because the css had changed so that it cared about the properties of the ons-switch element itself rather than the inside input. With the ons-switch element the checked and disabled properties were synced between the two elements. Semantically this made more sense. I didn't think of the option of using only the css classes without the ons-switch element. It feels kinda strange to have two ways to do the same thing. Also there is no way to make the element draggable with css only, so I guess now we have 2 things which are almost identical but one is draggable and the other one isn't. We may want to rethink our strategy imo.\nI changed the css back so that it depends on the input. The issues should be gone after the merge.\n. @anatoo sorry to disturb you but could you help me with the Japanese documentation?\nThe lines are [244, 713, 731, 734].\n. I updated the translations, so maybe we can merge it now if you think they are ok. :)\n. I answered you at #1209.\nUnfortunately it's not properly fixed, but I provided a simple hack to make it work.\n. It was actually the example that had the problem - this part of the implementation has not been changed since before 10cf22968a7e0864daa672857748472b20d698a7. The thing is since the styles before were for the ons-list-item itself (it had the list__item class) the fact that it was this way wasn't noticeable.\nThe list item was being compiled and taken as a template, but afterwards we were changing the compiled item. We could think about if this should be the expected behaviour, but it's been this way for a very long time. It's not broken, but it's just different.\n. We're done. It's ready for merging.\n. Update: \nThe documentation was added to master when branch ons-splitter-refactor was merged. It should be available on the website when we rebuild the docs again, so I'm closing this issue.\n. Sorry for the late answer - I guess your issue doesn't look very appealing to the development team.\nGithub has a new feature for issue templates, but I guess we haven't made ours yet.\nI am going to separate the the answer into a few points:\n1. When you paste a log on github please use triple tick quotes `` on both sides, so that it can be seen better as a log instead of just text. Also try to avoid putting 150+ line logs - this one isn't even full, so I'm guessing you either failed to copy everything or github just trimmed it down for you, because it's too long.\n2. Instead of the whole log you could just include the error itself. Also when the error is inside the resullt ofnpm installprobably that means that it's a bug of one of the dependencies, not Onsen UI. So you should report the bug over there. It's also likely that if you google the exact error you will find a stackoverflow question or github issue already referencing that error and maybe the solution for it as well.\n3. In your case the first thing to see isTRACKER : error TRK0005: Failed to locate: \"CL.exe\".- the [first result](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33183161/node-gyp-error-tracker-error-trk0005-failed-to-locate-cl-exe-the-system-c) of a google search for this has an accepted answer as well as a comment pointing to the [node-gyp installation docs on github](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#user-content-installation). - there you can also see thepython 2.7requirement. So make sure you didn't accidentally installpython 3instead of2.7, but I guess maybe in that case you would have gotten a different error.\n4. From what I can see the next errors all say that some path is too long and they cannot write to a file with a path larger than 260 characters, but all of them later result innpm WARN optional dep failed, so not that important since it's an optional dependency.\n5. I guess an error on our part is the fact that we're using so many things in a simple demo. I guess for most developers doingnpm install && gulp serveseems easier, but for ones who don't care about dependencies and just want to try out onsen none of this is even needed. Onsen UI is a frontend ui lib and thus the only thing you need to do to use it is just include it in a script tag. And actually it's over there already. The wholenpm installis just to give you a server and some extras like browser refresh etc. You don't even need it. If you have python already installed you can just dopython -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000in thewwwfolder and openlocalhost:8000in the browser. Alternatively you could even just open theindex.html` from your file explorer, but I usually it's better if you have a server for things like this.\nTo summarise:\nThis is an issue with the dependencies for the onsenui2-quickstart repo and actually in it's dependencies, not the product, so the issue should be at the repo of the specific dependency, and only if you don't find an answer to your problem over there already.\nIf you don't care about the server and additional features just run python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 instead.\nAlternatively you could use Monaca - the quickstart example can be selected and made to work easily over there.\n. @anujchaudhary1486\nIn the node-gyp docs they say that 3.x is not supported, so if you were using that then it may cause a problem.\nAlso the problem is caused dependencies of the demo itself, not by onsen ui, so this issue should be in that repo, but nevermind. The demo provides some additional features such as browser refresh etc, which are not really related to onsen ui and which seem to be the ones failing the npm install command.\nAnyway I'm glad that my answer in this issue was able to help you solve the problem.\nI guess in the end even though python 3 has been out for quite a while now people still use 2.7 a lot...\n. Sorry about the late response. \nFrom beta5 we have made a lot of changes, so right now I don't seem to be able to reproduce the issue with beta15 (Demo), so I will close this.\nIf you are still able to reproduce it with the newer version please tell us.\n. Since Onsen UI is expected to be used to make mobile applications, after the application is build there won't be an address bar. So if you plan on making an application you shouldn't worry about that. \nThe behaviour is currently that way in order to avoid bugs in iOS. Since our toolbars and tabbars are expected to be fixed on the page and position: fixed still isn't properly supported on iOS we're doing some hacks with position: absolute. If you are just making a mobile website you have 2 options:\n- change some things to position: fixed if you don't care about iOS.\n- do some tricks on the drag event so that you manage the height of the elements and scrolling.\nHowever since that isn't the main focus of Onsen UI I doubt that we would implement such a feature on our side in the foreseeable future. \n. ok\n. BTW it's ready for merging :)\n. Thank you for the bug report @d3orn \nSince ons-fab is part from material design we weren't really expecting people to try and use it in IOS. Therefore we felt safe using position: fixed in it's development even though we are aware of the bad IOS implementation. In each other component we actually use position: absolute with some tricks.\nI was going to suggest that you do the exact same hack if you currently need it for a project.\n(Have an absolute positioned container which takes up all the available space and has overflow: auto and have the fab after the container, again with position: absolute). \nYou can see the demo here - viewing codepen on a mobile device sometimes is buggy, but the code works fine in a normal project.\nI don't think this is generally such a big issue, so I'm not sure we need any additional polyfills, if you want you could try and implement it, but I'm not sure if we would merge it, so it would probably be easier if you just fix it in your own project.\n. We would like that too :)\nI guess we will fix this, but it's not completely certain when. It may require some changes to the DOM structure of the page in order to make it work.\nSince there is no similar component in IOS flat design I guess we cannot do anything other than just fix them. \nIf the user wants he can wrap the ons-fab inside an ons-if[platform=\"android\"] so that they are shown only on android as shown here.\n. @2016lalu position: fixed isn't properly supported in iOS and results in buggy behaviour when scrolling. If you swipe to start scrolling then it scrolls the fixed element and restores it to it's place after the scrolling is finished. This whole issue is about a solution which does not use position: fixed.\nRight now our team is busy with other things and this is not of very high priority though, because fabs are expected to be used mostly in android.\n. Sorry for the late response.\nIt seems that everything is working as it should except for the fact that probably your popover is created outside your page, making it skip the handler of the page.\nI just tested this scenario and it's the only one which I can come up with. It's actually easy to do that because of the implementation of ons.createPopover, which you may be using. Otherwise everything seems to work fine.\nThe fix is just to have the popover as an element of the page. You can reference it by using the var attribute. :)\nI'll keep this issue open until we actually fix the implementation of ons.createPopover so that it can be used in this scenario.\n. @puks - @frankdiox is correct that your issue is not very descriptive. It's best if you provide a little more information when you add an issue.\nStill I think I can guess what you mean - probably the input is there but you are just unable to notice it because of the default styles. Currently the default view for all onsen ui components is iOS. The default view for ons-input is pretty much seamless, so that it doesn't bother the users. Usually people would use the ons-input either with a label or at least a placeholder. An input without either of those can be considered bad design and if you have at least one of the two then it wouldn't bother you that it has no border/outline. So basically you can just put a placeholder and you should be able to see it fine. Another option is to add modifier=\"underbar\" or modifier=\"material\" and then you should be able to notice it again.\nIf you don't know what fran and I are talking about - ons-input is a wrapper around input with some custom styles for checkbox and radio etc. If what you're talking about is just the normal input tag then probably some of the styles from the custom component propagated to the normal input. We might fix that if that's the case, but if you look at most native applications you will see that they rarely have a style like the one which is the default in the browsers. Therefore I suggest that you try out the ons-input element with either of the following two lines:\nhtml\n<ons-input modifier=\"material\"></ons-input>\n<ons-input modifier=\"underbar\"></ons-input>\nor alternatively just add either of these for your simple input \nhtml\n<input placeholder=\"test\">\n<input style=\"border: 1px solid black\">\n@frankdiox - this issue made me notice that actually the docs for ons-input haven't been updated in a while - they're even using the old name. I guess we should update them at some point. (^_^)'\n. Thanks for reporting. I will look into it on Monday. Until recently the splitter side wasn't even scrollable, so I guess we haven't tested this scenario.\n. The fix will probably be available as soon as beta.9 comes out. Until then feel free to patch it for your app with the following css: \ncss\n.page__status-bar-fill + .page__background + .page__content {\n  padding-top: 0px;\n  top: 20px;\n}\n. Currently we don't provide any way to do that effect from within Onsen UI. \nWe may consider it for a future release, so stay tuned.\nUtil then feel free to use the example which you provided.\n. Thank you for the pull request. \nThe problem which you are having is a combination of one strange thing on our side and one strange thing on your side. On our side it turns out that we're modifying the options object which you're giving us. I guess you're using the same options object for all methods. Even though yours is kind of strange it's not actually a wrong thing and we shouldn't have bugs because of that.\nSo the solution is just that we shouldn't modify the object which you're giving us. What you are doing is patching the side effects of that instead of solving the actual problem. Also you are changing the time of execution for this._pages[0].updateBackButton(); which shouldn't be the case for a bugfix.\nI guess we'll just stop modifying the options object instead. It will probably be fixed in the next beta version.\n. The fix has been merged, so I'm closing this issue.\n. Are you sure that you are using beta 9?\nAnyway the update which you are giving is strange - it bugs only on the second part?\nHere's a codepen with the problem you are describing, but I don't see the behaviour which you're talking about. Please modify it so that we can see the issue, because currently we're unable to reproduce it.\n. The fix has been merged, so I'm closing this issue.\n. It seems like it's a bug in cordova. If the app was stared in fullscreen mode then when you resume it it should still be fullscreen, which I guess doesn't seem to be the case.\nTherefore in order to fix it we would need some additional property (something like ons.fullscreen = true) which you could set and then apply the fix if the property is available, since we cannot actually check if it's in a bugged state.\nHowever since this isn't our bug we don't know when it will be fixed and thus when they fix it on their side Onsen will actually become bugged.\nSo instead of doing this we can just share a fix, but without including it in Onsen - you can just include it in your fullscreen apps until they fix it.\nProbably the issue was introduced recently as there was only one other case which was able to find (Feb 1):\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/35126192/phonegap-android-6-status-bar-overlaps-webview\nhttp://community.phonegap.com/nitobi/topics/android-status-bar-overlaps-webview\nBy the looks of it the app goes into a bugged fullscreen state in 2 cases:\n1. when you do some navigation between apps (your case)\n2. when you focus an input (the other guy's case)\nIn that case you can just manually fix it - something along the lines of:\njavascript\nif (ons.platform.isAndroid()) { // maybe some other checks too if it happens only in some android versions\n  ons.ready(function(){\n    var fix = function () {\n      document.body.classList.add('fullscreen-bugfix');\n      document.removeEventListener('resume', fix);\n      document.removeEventListener('focusin', fix);\n    };\n    document.addEventListener('resume', fix);\n    document.addEventListener('focusin', fix);\n  });\n}\n``` css\nbody.fullscreen-bugfix {\n  top: 30px;\n}\nbody.fullscreen-bugfix ons-popover {\n  margin-top: -30px;\n  padding-top: 30px;\n}\n```\nSomething like this. However this is just from the top of my head - the same way popover checks the screen sizes maybe there are also other components which could become bugged due to incorrect calculations, but I just cannot recall them right now.\nStill maybe just publishing a fullscreen app is just not worth it until they fix the problem @cordova since otherwise you will also need to republish it when they fix it, but that's your choice.\n. Thank you for the bug report. After testing it seems to be happening only when the modal is outside of any page. The modal expects to find a page parent and reattach itself so that it's over the page contents. For now the easiest solution is just to wrap the application in a page (ons-page) and everything should work. Though it's true that something like this shouldn't stop ons.ready.\n. The back button spec doesn't really seem connected unless I'm missing something.\nOtherwise I guess it's fine if it works. We seem to be doing this in a lot of other places anyway...\nFeel free to merge it I guess :)\n. Thank you for the bug report and sorry for the late reaction. It should be fixed now.\nAlso if you run into similar problems and we don't respond in time you can disable the auto status bar fill feature and just manually add the status-bar-fill attribute to the element which you want to consume the iOS status bar.\n. Looks good - feel free to merge it once it passes CircleCI :)\n. Which version of Onsen UI are you using?\nWe removed the ons-scroller from version 2 recently. For a long time it was being used only for css.\nIf that's what you need then feel free to use this css instead:\n.scroller {\n  display: block;\n  height: 100%;\n  overflow: auto;\n  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n  -ms-overflow-style: none;\n  -ms-scroll-snap-type: mandatory;\n}\nThis is what the ons-scroller had.\nIf you need some other functionality then feel free to use ons-page instead. (For example you should be able to use <ons-page var=\"myScroller\"> and get the reference that way.)\n. Unfortunately I seem to be unable to. I updated Xcode, cordova, cordova-ios and the emulator still reaches only up to 9.2, not 9.2.1. We also have 3 devices with 9.2, but none with 9.2.1. However I'm not sure if it would be ok to upgrade one of the devices, since it seems like downgrading is not really an option for iOS.\nI tested in 9.2 and everything is perfectly fine - it requires an options object with a message property, but that is all. Even something like ons.notification.confirm({message:1}) works. So currently I'm not sure that there is anything we could do about it. Maybe the user can provide some more information.\n. The fix has been merged, so it should be available when we release beta.10 officially.\n. \u2713 :dog: \n. @logicweb Thank you very much for your help.\nThe bug was being caused by the svg being used in ons-progress-circular. It turns out on iOS 8.4 the svg elements don't have a children property which we were using in some dome traversals. And for some other reasons the error was hidden.\nThis has just been fixed, so it should be fine as soon as we release beta 14 (don't worry we have already released beta 13).\n. The solution is to put the ons-split-view inside an ons-page with a title. I have provided an example in this answer on stackoverflow.\nSince this is just a question and not a real issue I am closing it.\n. ok, I will check it\n. Are you sure you updated the css files? The implementation for popover was changed in beta 8, so the styles also changed. \nI just checked iOS 9.0 and it works fine, so maybe it's either an update issue or some specific problem for the page and way of calling it. Can you provide some more information?\n. The issue was found elsewhere so I'm closing this one.\n. Thank you for the suggestion. Right now we're busy with the official release of Onsen 2, so we're focusing mainly on bugs, but adding the option for dynamic carousel width is definitely something which we may consider adding in the future. However our experience has shown us that these type of things tend to become hard to support if not very well written, so right now it's not on our priority list.\n. Well as you may have noticed in the issue template - stackoverflow or the community is a better place for questions rather than github issues. \nNow for the answer:\nThe command which is generally used to compile the css is gulp build inside the css-components folder. You can also take a look at the gulpfile.js if you're interested. Also the result is multiple files because you don't want all themes at once - you can use the one which you like. They're basically the same, the only difference being the color variables.\nSorry if it's rude, but I am closing this issue. Feel free to ask about more info on the community or SO.\n. Thank you for the report.\nUnfortunately I seem to be unable to grasp your actual problem.\nHere's a codepen of what I seem to be understanding from your description, however that doesn't sound like an actual issue to me. \nAlso we are not setting the min-width property of the left side but rather the width. So if I understand correctly your solution is just to change the defaults, but with other values those defaults would also be insufficient. \nIf that is the issue then we may think about improving the default behaviour, but right now it's probably best if you just modify the values in your project as you see fit. \nSorry if I am being rude - maybe I don't quite understand your problem. If the codepen doesn't seem to be the issue which you want to describe then please tell me what is the difference. :)\n. Ok. Thank you.\n. Update:\nIt turned out that the material design has a different layout than the flat one. However it turns out that if the bug which you are reporting is the one in the first picture - currently that seems to be the expected behaviour. It does shrink but it doesn't actually hide the content. \nAnd I guess I was actually wrong earlier - the MD toolbar left has min-width: 72px. However it seems like we got it from the MD spec, so I guess we won't be changing it.\nHowever I agree that the current result seems to look really bad. So I guess instead what we can do is just add the same styles for the right as the ones for the left. That means:\nMD toolbar styles\n.left, .right { min-width: 72px; }\n.left:empty, .right:empty { min-width: 16px; }\nIn that case it will look ok. And if you don't like the default values you can change them accordingly for your app. Even though technically according to the MD spec these should be the correct values.\nThe other case which I can think of is if your right side is bigger than 50% then you can just remove the max-width, but I guess that's probably not your case.\nAnd the final thing which comes to my mind is if it somehow glitches after some animation - the animation slide-ios does some things with the toolbar, however after testing on an android device I was unable to reproduce a case where the .right becomes hidden as a result of the animation.\nSo just to make sure - does the glitch which you guys are seeing hide part of the .right or just makes it smaller, but with the content still visible?\nIf it just shrinks it without hiding content (which the currently provided case I think) then I guess in the next version the styles will be as described above, you can change them for your app if they don't fit your design.\nIf it shrinks in a way which hides it then I would be happy if you could provide a case in which it can be reproduced :)\n. Oh ok. In that case I'm glad that everything is solved. :)\n. @ThomasLochbrunner - I am currently working on some other things and therefore haven't taken the time to fix this issue. That being said if you need it working right now you can just apply the following css:\n[mode=\"split\"] ~ ons-splitter-mask { display: none !important; }\n[mode=\"split\"] { transform: none !important; transition: none !important; }\nHere's a demo to see it in action.\nAnyway maybe I will need to discuss the expected behaviour with the team.\n. I guess there is a small error in the docs. The options property is currently called pushedOptions as I guess you noticed when you were accessing it from the pageinit handler. Just to be sure - after \nconsole.log(\"Parameter passed: \", page);\nyou have something like\nconsole.log(\"Options: \", page.pushedOptions);\nright? \nBut it's undefined is what you're saying, right?\nSide note: If you have some data which you want to use we recommend putting it inside the data property of the options object. If everything works fine you should be able to access it through page.data.\n. well just changing to border-box shouldn't have any side effects or at least there are none which I can think of right now :)\n. As @munsterlander said - the code which you have provided isn't enough to replicate the issue.\nHere's a working demo of what I and munsterlander seem to be understanding.\nIf you have an ons-navigator it should work properly regardless of the contents of the pages (whether there is a splitter inside should make no difference). If you are trying to use the pushPage method on the ons-splitter itself then here it's time to mention that it doesn't have such a method. The ons-splitter-content only has a load method.\nAccording to what I understand from your explanation - you say that the page is pushed successfully, but just isn't shown (as in display: none) or am I misunderstanding?\nIf that's the case then maybe somehow onsen wasn't initialised for angular. To do that you need:\n1. ['onsenui.js', 'angular.js', 'angular-onsenui.js'] in this order\n2. Either ons.bootstrap() or angular.module('myAppName', ['onsen'])\nIf somehow you forgot 2 then I am sort of able to reproduce the issue. However if you want to use onsen with angular you should always have one of those two expressions.\nAnyway if none of these answers helped then we would be grateful if you could modify the codepen given above to your case, so that we can fix it.\n. @bdedardel the thing is if you don't need a complex page stack but rather just want to change the main page you can do that just by mySplitter.content.load('second-page.html'). \nAbout the templates - they're just handy to use, but you don't need to. You can always just put the an ons-page inside the navigator and not use the page attribute and it will have the same effect. I updated the demo to show that. I guess you were just putting the splitter directly inside the navigator - I think from the next version we are throwing a warning in that case.\nAnyway I'm glad that the problem is solved.\n. @frankdiox I think I'm able to reproduce it there (actually it seems that over there they are transparent but the .page__background is gray). Anyway it seems like it's just not used in the stylus. Adding the missing line will fix the issue. :)\n. @corneyl The issue was fixed but then we checked that actually in the new iOS design it was supposed to be transparent. \nSo I guess if you want you can set it by yourself. As you noted, the $list-header-background-color isn't used and thus has been removed.\n. Even though that what you're saying is probably true I don't see us making those changes soon, because position: fixed isn't properly supported on iOS. That is why we are using position: absolute hacks for cross-platform compatibility. And with those if you decide to add longer content then scrolling becomes inevitable.\nAnd about your case I guess what you want is not an actual tabbar, but just the design of the tabs, probably to which you'll add some javascript handlers. So feel free just to use the classes which you want from Onsen and add your own styles. If you are planning on supporting iOS though still you could consider avoiding position: fixed. The easiest way to avoid it is just to put your content inside a div with styles like \n.content { position: absolute; overflow: auto; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 44px; } /* or bottom: 0; margin-bottom: 44px; */\nor something similar. \n. Thank you very much for the bug report. Actually we were sort of informed about these 2 issues. We will fix both of them as soon as possible.\n. It looks like the Chrome bug has been fixed 2 days ago and I just fixed the other issue, so both problems should be gone in RC 5.\n. The fix will be available as soon as Onsen 2 RC 6 is released, so feel free to use that @vineshhpatel. \n. I tested it and it seems that in iOS attachedCallback, contentReady and setImmediate are all being executed before angular view's constructor is called. So even in much simpler cases our init event is fired before the angular view starts working. That's why the ons-init just misses the event (the even is fired normally, only the attribute doesn't work).\nOn another note: it seems that angular itself fires pageinit after it loads - I guess it's for backwards compatibility with Onsen 1, but it doesn't seem to be documented. Also I guess after this issue is fixed we can just listen for one event and fire the other one accordingly, as right now it has some hack to ensure that it's properly attached which is not really needed I guess. The other thing is maybe it would be better if we either document it or remove it, but maybe leaving it is also fine.\n. @anatoo sorry to hear that. I added a description to explain the changes, guess I should have done that sooner.\nThe goal was to make the animators simpler. I guess there are some odd cases where they may look more complicated, but I guess generally they are simpler. Maybe I was wrong on that. I may have gone too far into trying to create them shorter to the point where they became more complex than before. In that case what do you think of the state at the secondary refactor commit? (It's before I made all the components into objects).\nBasically the issues which this PR is referencing are:\n1. All the animators were really long and doing the same thing\n2. The animation options were handled differently across different components\n3. Creating an animator from the user's side was too difficult\nI guess the changes to the animation options are fine, what you probably don't like are the solutions to 1 and 3.\nFor 1 - in an earlier iteration of this the animators were still the same classes, but only the methods were changed to call the animate function - maybe you would prefer them in that state?\nTechnically in the older version I think there were some inconsistencies, causing some issues to be fixed only for some animators and remain for the others (for example the adding and removing of the masks), which were also fixed, but I guess they can be fixed in a simpler fashion. It's just that after I saw the repetitions I was too tempted to make a function which did these things automatically, but probably that function is what you consider to be unnecessarily complex.\nFor 3 - we seem to have many default values for the animation options. Technically that is why the animate function has an option to take a first argument, which is the default options. An alternative thought which I has was just to have that function and pass the default options. Then the complexity around this part would disappear.\n. Well actually this whole refactor does not change the way in which the animators work. It only acts as an additional wrapper/extension of the current API. In theory an normal animator like the current ones can be used even after the final changes.\nSo in that case @anatoo what would you consider to be an acceptable animation utility?\nIn it's current state the one which this PR provides is:\nanimate(options, elementsMap, animationsMap)\nI guess if using a map for the elements and animations is unintuitive it can just be changed to an array. And for the small helper functions/objects like fade.in etc they can also be removed if you feel that they make things harder to understand.\nAt that point though I'm not sure whether merging would be simpler rather than just doing this from scratch, since almost a month has passed and there were some changes to the core elements themselves (navigator, page etc), which might make merging now a little hard.\nSo I guess closing the PR and doing the changes from scratch if we want any might be our best course of action.\n. Sorry for the delay - lately we've been busy with the Angular 2 Release, so we didn't have much time. The fix will be available when we release RC16.\n. @frankdiox\nI looked into it - it seems that at the time we were using getCurrentPage we were still keeping an internal _pages stack and managing it manually. \nSo we were calling _pages.pop() in _popPage, whereas right now we're just using the actual children. Knowing that fact right now the current behaviour is logical as during the init event of the refreshed page the other page is still inside the dom. \nI'm not really sure whether we want to go back to manually managing that stack though. I guess we should think about it. Otherwise if we want to patch this it may be a little ugly (similar issues may arise with resetToPage and replacePage).\n@bdedardel\nSince the init event is for the initialisation of the page it happens before the popPage animation starts (and it's natural for the topPage to point at the top page, which is still page3), so we're not sure if we should consider this a bug or expected behaviour. \nIf you want to do something when the page is shown instead of initialised you should use the show event. That event is called after the animations, so feel free to use that for the time being or if we decide not to change this behaviour. (or event.target as @frankdiox suggested)\n. Actually it's more likely that it just feels that way. The default animation for Android is fade-md which has a 0.2s delay by default. That delay is not actually connected with the ripple effect. So you can just set the animation options to {delay: 0} and it should be fine.\nCould you confirm whether you're experiencing the issue if you set the duration to 0? \n. Well I think fran analysed the native animation and decided to put it at 200ms. We can remove it or make it shorter I guess.\n. Ok. I removed it :)\n. Well these sounds like 2 separate issues to me, but never mind.\nFor the first one could you specify what browser does this occur in? The height of the button should be the same as the toolbar (56px). Here's a demo. \nYou're correct about the second one. We can fix it easily. \n. It seems that the combination of overflow-y: visible and overflow-x: hidden wasn't working properly. And in firefox there seemed to be an issue where the line-height property was making some issues. However if it's fixed the backbutton is shifted by a couple of pixels up, and making more patches would be pretty ugly. So the final and simplest solution was just to make the overflow hidden by default.\n. I guess I already told you what my opinion on the subject is in person, but lets log it here too:\n- Templating - totally up for it. When I joined the team I also thought it was missing and that a template without a templating function doesn't feel right. And for the implementation - I think I would actually prefer a way to set it globally (something like ons.setTemplatingEngine). As for the suggested ways - the second one in theory sounds easier, maybe both would be fine though. We should try to unify the implementation for creating pages though, instead of repeating the same logic in many places.\n- ons-include - while in theory this can worsen the performance if used incorrectly I still like it - again it sounds useful and probably a lot of people would like it. If we decide to include non-pages in the template I guess we could make the auto-page wrapping in the loadPage utility function or whatever it will be. I think removing that feature may break a lot of things and also I don't think it makes sense to force users into writing additional tags since the whole purpose of our custom elements is to generate the html by ourselves when our users write simple things.\n- ons-repeat - I think if we add a templating function maybe this won't be as necessary as the templates could take care of this, but I guess it's still an option. The fact that you're suggesting for it to have the same api as lazy-repeat would make the transition really easy which is good. IMO if looked at separately I think there could be a better api though. At least what I would envision would be something similar to:\n<ons-repeat items=\"app.items\" template=\"app.template\">\n    <ons-list-item>{{item.content}}</ons-list-item>\n  </ons-repeat>\nWhere template would be needed only if it differs from the default one.\nBut I think most of the times users would like to have a default template and just use their items array rather than generate fibonacci or something similar. So this is how I would prefer it, but I would understand if we decide to go with your original idea :)\n- ons.util.createElement - actually I don't like this idea for multiple reasons, even though I seem to be the only one on the team who feels that way. \n  1. While the idea of exporting some utility functions sounds nice I think it would be better if we look into what they actually need, whereas here it sounds like we just want to export it since we're using it a lot internally. So maybe here @munsterlander can share what utility functions he would find useful.\n  2. If we decide to export some functions I think they should be in ons.util, but they should be completely separate from our internal ones. We should be able to change the internal ones at any moment, while the public ones should not really change that much. By using the same ones we open ourselves to potential issues.\n  3. I think this function in particular should not actually be used by the users. While in the core currently it may make sense, for the users I cannot think of many good reason to use it. \n The only thing I can think of is making the elements in a loop and attaching event listeners to the children. However I think performance-wise that would not be very good. But other than that case when would actually creating a single element from html be beneficial and the right approach? If we want to use html we could just use innerHTML directly - we're not giving them better security than that because that's what we're doing under the hood. And if they're using it in a loop it's much better to concatenate the html for all elements and dump it at once rather than creating each element individually and appending them one by one (even if we're using fragments).\n\nBasically I just think that if we give this feature to the users then the cases of improper usage would vastly outnumber the proper ones. \nSide note: @munsterlander - is there a problem with v-for ? Is it incompatible with onsen or is there a reason why it doesn't work for you currently?\n. Thank you for the bug report. While this may be a duplicate of #1290 the fix which you are proposing is definitely something worth checking out. ^_^\n. Unfortunately after some testing the suggested fix seems to produce buggy results for me. Maybe your devices are better than the ones which I used.  \nI guess if your fix works for you that's fine, but for now I will close this - we will come up with another fix for the core. \n. I guess a lot of people in the angular community have been running into this issue recently. Unfortunately I haven't been able to reproduce it. \nLooking at the issues and commits of the angular repo it seems that they may have fixed it in RC3, which was released 3 days ago, can you confirm whether it still persists when using that?\n. As you may have noticed in the start of the issue template - questions should be asked in either stackoverflow.com/tags/onsen-ui or community.onsen.io.\nAlso the problem specified does not seem to be related to onsen ui, as it does not interact with the mentioned plugin.\nThat being said I can think of several potential reasons for the error which you're describing:\n- if cordova/phonegap was not loaded properly\n- if cordova-device-orientation-plugin was not loaded properly\n- if you're executing the code in an emulator which does not support the lockOrientation method\n- or most likely if you're not waiting for the deviceready event when executing your code.\nFor the last one you could use either of:\n```\ndocument.addEventListener('deviceready', function(){\n  // lock screen here\n});\nons.ready(function(){\n  // lock screen here\n});\n```\nAnyway I am closing this issue as it doesn't seem to be a bug related to Onsen UI.\n. Hmm I seem to be unable to reproduce the issue. It seems to be working fine. Maybe there is some specific case/browser in which the issue appears? Working Demo\n. Hi @davidNieves. \nFirst I would like to mention that (as you may have noticed in our issue template) - we like using github issue for bugs and feature requests only. Questions should be asked in either stackoverflow.com/tags/onsen-ui or community.onsen.io.\nBut anyway here's your answer:\nThere are 2 things which should be noted here:\n1. Make sure that you installed onsen 2 instead of onsen 1. We recommend installing onsen ui with npm install onsenui@latest.\n2. Since you are using systemjsthere is one more line which you need to add in order to import angular2-onsenui properly - mentioning the location of the main file of the module, as well as the default extension.\nThat line would be \n   packages['angular2-onsenui'] = { main: 'dist/src/angular2-onsenui.js',  defaultExtension: 'js' }\nWe prefer using webpack as importing things with it is a little bit easier. It takes the main file's location from package.json automatically and is also able to import the other files without specifying the extension. For example if we move the main file to another location with webpack nothing would break, whereas with systemjs you would need to update the location manually.\nAnyway make sure you confirm these 2 points and you're good to go.\n. Hi @alegauss. Looking at your DOM structure the fact that the sliding menu page has a status-bar-fill attribute is expected behaviour. As for the reason why it's white - that's just the default color.\nThe status bar fill itself as you can see is not an element, therefore it just adds padding on top of the page (and doesn't have a specific background). If there is a toolbar then the toolbar fills that distance. If there is no toolbar, then the background of the page is visible. So to change that you can just change #side-page .page__background's background and you're good to go. \nDemo\n. Thank you for the bug report. The issue has been fixed. We will probably release RC.16 soon so feel free to use that. :) \n. Does this happen only when there is a tabbar in the page or always? If it only happens when there is a tabbar then it may have been fixed together with #1501. Otherwise I guess it's possible to be a react issue where react is trying to restore some previous state and ends up in some kind of loop because of that.\nI just tested it and was unable to reproduce it with\nreact-onsenui-kitchensink, onsenui@2.0.0-rc.15, react-onsenui@0.6.2, iOS versions 8.4 and 9.3.\nI did find a similar bug with the pull-hook, it might be related. However that bug seems to be react-onsenui only, so probably the one which you are reporting is too.\nWe would be thankful if you could confirm whether this bug persist in RC.16 when we release it. If it does then maybe @philolo1 or @argelius should take a look at it.\n. Thank you for the detailed explanation. Because of that I tend to think that the issue is not within Onsen UI, but rather the browser's device mode. Or more precisely the switching of the modes.\nEarlier when you switched to device mode you would receive a warning saying that you should refresh to avoid incorrect behaviour. I see now that they removed the warning, but the behaviour wasn't fixed. \nI guess they are trying to do something like a \"soft refresh\" where they try to reapply some things when you switch modes, however that doesn't seem to work very well, or at least in this case.\nSo to solve the problem just take this as a general rule - when you switch to device mode, or switch the device itself it's always better to refresh once to ensure that everything is initialised properly.\nTL;DR: Refresh the page after you enter device mode and you're good to go.\n. Hmm... Well I am guessing since it's the same behaviour as the previous case probably the reason is also the same - chrome sending both click and tap events for only one action. Unfortunately testing this on our side won't be really easy and the most likely fix would be something like a 10ms delay with a check, which is not very elegant. So I think we may keep this issue closed for now since it seems like a low priority since the case is relatively rare. If you're interested in a fix on your side I would be willing to help.\n. Duplicate of #1496. This has already been fixed. The fix will be available when we release RC.16.\n. @thisar what version are you using exactly - all .page__extra logic should already be removed, so you should not have such an element with RC 16-17. If you update your onsen version the bug should also disappear :)\n. @thisar The code seems pretty much fine. \nThe problem comes from the background class - Onsen uses 2 classes for its pages - page__background and page__content. Since for some other frameworks it's better for the users to be able to create those themselves we decided to add these classes automatically if we find either .background or .content children directly in ons-page. \nSo what is happening is your element became a background which is why you are unable to click on it. If you change your class to my-background or something similar it will be fine. Here's a demo of the login in french (for people who don't know the words :D).\nPS: when posting code in github issues you can wrap it in triple backticks ``` on both sides and it will be fine :)\n. @thisar - it sounds like somewhere you are providing 2 sibling elements where onsen expects only one. Maybe if you can post something like a codepen where we reproduce the issue it will be simpler. (For example modifying the one above.) \nFrom what I see:\n- Having the ons-toolbar inside the ons-page is actually the expected behaviour, which you can also see in the codepen provided above. \n- In the non-working example you have a closing em tag without opening it. Browsers have been trying to deal with invalid html structures for a long time and in some cases having one extra opening or closing tag may actually result in many tags like that one appearing across the whole dom. \n  Unfortunately I don't have a tool to recommend for this issue - while there is a W3C validator I also don't use it so I would just suggest being careful or having some extra feature on your editor of choice warning you about such errors.\nAlso since this isn't related to the original issue and it seems to be a discussion rather than a bug I would suggest continuing the conversation in the onsen forum\n. @philolo1\nBasically they don't really depend much on the object - the question is more like where would they feel natural to be accessed from. \nThe splitter, tabbar and navigator animations are special since they operate on different objects.\nIn theory if we put them in the same place I think we may get users confused a little.\nYou are correct that the animations for ons-modal, ons-popover, ons-dialog and ons-alert-dialog should be interchangeable since they have the same methods and arguments.\nMaybe a similar option to what you suggest would be to put them in ons.animators, but still group them there like\nons.animators.navigator ons.animators.general etc,\nbut I'm not sure whether this makes more sense than just ons.OnsNavigatorElement.animators.\n@frankdiox \nFor the \"ons object instead of window\" +1 I also think that.\nI would be fine with dropping either Ons or Element from ons.OnsNavigatorElement, but maybe it seems more explicit and readable for some people.\nI think it would be best if we could do\nimport {Navigator} from 'onsenui.elements'\nbut I don't think that is possible. Anyway I think both any change and no changes in this regard would be fine.\nFor ons.OnsNavigatorElement.animators.iOSSlide.extend I guess it's still much better to give them something like this rather than forcing them to extend it the normal ES5 way. Even though technically if they override all of the methods they won't be using anything from the original (-_-)'.\nI think in general it would be better if some aspects of the animators are more general before we export them though.\nSomething like making our methods just take a single options argument where we would provide everything needed. Right now we have some methods taking 4 arguments already and i think we may need to add a fifth maybe, which doesn't sound nice.\nAlso maybe having a default constructor and having a simple way for a method to take the animationOptions into consideration. I'm not sure our users would be able to handle our settings properly most of the times.\nI would personally like some option like to add a basic animator where they only provide the css values they would want and we could make/have an animator with their custom options. This idea may be a little radical though and may require some additional coding on our side, so it would understandable if it's rejected.\nSidenote: I think I would prefer addAnimator rather than registerAnimator. \nOther than this I guess Fran's suggestions seem ok.\n. @erikcw We generally don't expect users to be clicking the ons-back-button when the stack is empty. There is some onsen logic trying to hide the button in that case. I am not sure how exactly you reopen the app with only the \"deep\" page. I'm not sure I have a complete grasp of how it comes to that situation.\nIn my opinion it's fine if we throw an exception if someone tries to do that.\nAs for the app going into a non-responsive state - does that occur on any exception or is this one more special?\nIf you want to override the default behaviour of the button you can do it via setting its onClick property (it's a custom one, so the case matters). You can find it in the docs.\n. Oh I didn't notice an issue was created - thanks for the help @munsterlander .  \n@rgins16 - for similar problems feel free to discuss them @ the community first.\nI will close this now.\n. I agree that it makes sense. When I initially looked at Onsen UI I was also expecting the same behaviour. \nImplementing it shouldn't be too big of an issue. Though if the others don't like the idea I guess it doesn't sound very important.\n. @munsterlander \nThe way I see it it shouldn't make any problems most of the time. This feature will do something only when the ons-button is inside a form tag. (I may be wrong, but I think most of our users just use the ons-button without putting it in a form.) If you have a form tag it's usually better to change the form submission in the first place, rather than button clicks and you can always submit the form only when it's valid.\nSomething like\nform.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {\n  if (!isValid) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n  }\n});\nBut I do agree that maybe adding functionality like that in theory may cause some issues in some cases. If the others think so too I guess if we enable it via type=\"submit\" or sth similar it won't be a problem. :) \n. @qifuren1985 I think you probably don't want to see 3 popPage animations, right? In that case you can just do something like navi.pages[2].remove() twice and then do navi.popPage(). I think our current navigator should be able to handle if you simply remove the ons-page dom elements and do one animation :) \nIf you want to just pop 3 times you may need to write some more logic, but I'm not sure it would look very appealing.\nWe might consider adding such a feature in the future, but for now I think simply removing the elements yourself seems simple enough.\n. Hi - we haven't heard from you in a while.\nI'm guessing you are using only the core (vanilla js). If the problem occurs only with a specific framework it would be good to mention it.\nCurrently I am unable to reproduce the issue. Here it seems to be working fine with RC.17.\nPossible reasons I can come up with for your behaviour are\n- the toolbar has an inline attribute\n- the toolbar is located inside either an element with classes content or page__content\nIf you could give us a way to reproduce the issue it would be most helpful. An easy way to do that is from the tutorial and clicking the export to codepen and then you can give us your codepen url :) .\n. Oh ok so you are currently trying react. \nWith react the toolbars for the pages should be created using additional render methods. I see you are using renderToolbar - there is a similar one for the bottom one -renderBottomToolbar. \nHere is a modification of your codepen with that method. \nAs for why these components are created using those methods maybe you will receive a better answer at the react-onsenui repo. \n. Hi - we actually already have 2 features like that. \nThe first one is ons-lazy-repeat - it focuses on also keeping the dom relatively clear, showing only a set amount of items at any point. docs\nThe second one has an API almost identical to the one which you suggest. It's a property or attribute of ons-page - (on-infinite-scroll attribute or onInfiniteScroll property). You just need to provide a function which loads the data. It's first argument is a callback to show when the data can be loaded again - if your data has all been loaded then you just don't need to call the callback. docs\nIf you already have your 2 variables you can do something like this:\nvar loadMoreData = function(){...}, moreDataCanBeLoaded = true;\nmyPage.onInfiniteScroll = function (done) {\n  if (moreDataCanBeLoaded) {\n    loadMoreData.then(done);\n  }\n};\nThe big difference between the two ways is that the first one keeps the dom relatively small, while in the second one you handle loading the data and therefore has a simpler API.\nAnyway I will close this issue since we already have the feature.\n. The element used to have two animator libraries which it could use, depending on what is preferred. The API is the same for both. Nevertheless I commented out the one not being used right now.\n. The check itself is required in order for the component to work. Its slow, because it requires the rendered style of the element, not the inline style of the element.\nMoved the check to be done when the element is clicked for the first time. Now there is no delay from the initialisation.\n. I moved it over there, but the test got a little extra clutter because of that.\n. Document fragments increase performance mostly because they make all changes to the DOM at once, hence making the browser do only one reflow instead of multiple ones. \nHowever if the modifications are made outside the DOM, using document fragment actually slows down the process - jsperf test 1 . In our web components, as far as I understand - _compile is executed in createdCallback, not in attachedCallback, so the actions here are before the element is attached to the DOM.\nIn this case also even if it was inside the DOM I am appending only 2 children - again at least in the current browsers creating a fragment for 2 children does not seem to be beneficial, and again makes it slower - jsperf test 2.\nTherefore I have not modified this part in the recent commit.\nIn the second jsperf I have also added another case if the code for the two elements is copy-pasted. There seems to be around 3% performance improvement if its done. There are probably also other places where I could make the same change if we want to squeeze out the best performance. If you think this is necessary please tell me and I will fix them.\n. That was the intent. It's intended to be a comment. I think what is written here is something which would be really nice if the users see before adding the issue.\n. yes - it should be after the background or after the toolbar if there is no background.\notherwise there would be elements in between.\nThe order should be\nons-toolbar\n.page__background\n.page__content\nThis happens when there is no content element in the dom yet, so it checks for either of the previous 2 and inserts itself after that.\n.

    "danjarvis": "So I noticed the second issue a few weeks ago after upgrading to Onsen v1.2.2\nI commented on this commit to get more details, because the CSS change is what causes the overlap when using ons-navigator with split-view.\nAs mentioned in the comment, you can work around this by using the following CSS:\ncss\n.onsen-split-view__main {\n    overflow: hidden !important;\n}\nForked example here.\n. Cool.\nHave you guys thought about adding unused: true to your .jshintrc file? You'll get warnings if you declare vars but don't actually use them.\n. I have a solution for this... posted it to stack overflow -- never got around to submitting that pull request though.\n. :+1: Just encountered a likely related issue with iOS and ons-bottom-toolbar: When using both top and bottom toolbars, the extra padding that is usually added on iOS to move the page down from the status bar is no longer applied correctly.\n\n. Hey there @argelius !\nThe issue was occurring in 1.3.14. I see that you just released 1.3.15 so I'll see if I can reproduce it there.\n. @argelius Yeah I can make that change. Also... it seems that 1.3.15 is not available through bower.\n. @frankdiox understood -- thank you!\n@argelius just updated the PR with your requested changes.\nAlso, do you have any good information on the iOS9 WebView bug? In searching around it appears that the bug only manifests when updates need to occur based on pseudo-classes: .foo:hover ~ .bar, foo:checked ~ .bar or if a selector includes multiple class names and one is removed: foo.bar ~ baz.\n. @IliaSky That makes sense. Thanks for the update!\n. A general practice to follow when setting initial data in a controller is to wrap code in calls to $timeout or $evalAsync. These will trigger the digest cycle and your bindings will get set properly.\n```\nons.bootstrap()\n.controller('DialogController', function($scope) {\n  $scope.dialogs = {};\n$scope.show = function(dlg) {\n    if (!$scope.dialogs[dlg]) {\n      ons.createDialog(dlg).then(function(dialog) {\n        $scope.dialogs[dlg] = dialog;\n        dialog.show();\n      });\n    } else {\n      $scope.dialogs[dlg].show();\n    }\n  }\n}).controller('MaterialController', function($scope, $timeout) {\n  $timeout(function() {\n    $scope.volume = 5;\n  }, 10);\n});\n```\n.

This issue is for Onsen UI v1, so I will close it. @msaelices If you are still having problems, please open a new issue, as it makes it much easier to follow -- I didn't see your comment on this until just now, but I would see a new issue right away.. @ychongsaytc If this is still happening, please open a new issue. It is hard to keep track of comments on very old issues.. This was a FastClick issue which has since been fixed.. @iTiaNex Please don't comment on very old closed issues. If there is a bug, please open a new issue. Otherwise you can try posting on the Onsen Community.. This may be related to #2254, and possibly fixed by the same code.. This seems to have been fixed by our changes to FastClick. Please feel free to re-open if this is not fixed for you in the latest version of Onsen UI.. Thanks for bringing this to our attention @kurtishouser. It looks like the previous fix was lost during a recent refactor of the side splitter. The issue is actually in the core, not the React bindings. I will fix this for the next release.. This does not appear to be happening anymore with onsenui@2.8.3.. I'm afraid there is not enough detail here to help solve your issue. If you are still having a problem, please create a new issue and follow the issue template provided.. @Ralpharoo Thanks for the detailed report! I tested out your steps, and you are right. Using input fields on iOS is not a great experience.\nI have updated our fork of FastClick with the code from the PR you linked. So it will be fixed in the next release of Onsen UI. Thanks for your help!. It looks like this was caused by the fix for #2231. In that situation, there was a flicker when switching between tabs inside a dialog. Ironically this fix appears to have caused other things to flicker instead.\nFor now I'm going to revert that fix, as it is a more obscure use case.\nIn the mean time, you can add this to your CSS as a workaround:\n.page__content--suppress-layer-creation {\n  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch !important;\n}. Thanks to @sbaechler's above PR, these docs have been fixed. This will be reflected in the online docs with the next release of the React bindings in the next week or two.. @SebasG22 Apologies for the very long delay in replying to you. There has been a lot of change in the Onsen UI team over the past few months, so some issues have gone ignored, including this one.\nRight now the team is focused on other tasks, so this is not on the immediate roadmap I'm afraid. As always, pull requests are more than welcome!. Thanks for the link, @Ray-Eldath. As you say, this would introduce significant complexity into Onsen UI.\nWe have no plans to provide Weex integration at any point in the near future, so I am going to close this issue.. @Ralpharoo Thanks for the report. I cannot reproduce this either in emulator or device. ons.platform.isIPhoneX() returns true for me on an iPhone X (11.2) whether started in portrait or landscape mode.\nThe isIPhoneX() function checks window.screen.width === 375 && window.screen.height === 812, but these do not change with orientation.window.screen.width will always equal 375 on an iPhone X, regardless of its orientation. So, I would expect this function to work correctly in both portrait and landscape.\nCould you try reproducing this in a basic Cordova / Onsen UI project and see if it happens there?. Interesting, I can see the issue happening in Chrome now. The CSS spec for window.screen.width and window.screen.height does not actually seem to specify what should happen when the screen orientation changes. I don't trust that Apple won't at some point decide to change this behaviour on iOS, since it isn't part of the spec.\nI will add a check for landscape dimensions. It's a quick fix and will certainly be helpful for development scenarios, and cover us if Apple do change the behaviour of window.screen.. Closing due to lack of a reply.. @MarsZone You don't need to worry much about it, as it only happens in Chrome if you are previewing as an iOS device. So, you will only see it in development. It no longer happens on an iOS device.\nIn any case, this is annoying to have happen while developing, so I have fixed this in our fork of the FastClick library. It will be include in the next Onsen UI release.. That is true, there is no global reference anymore. Though they should have no need to access it, because all you would do with window.FastClick is call FastClick.attach, which we do in setup.js. Any further interaction should be done with the returned instance, which we expose on ons.fastclick.\nIf you think there is a chance someone is using window.FastClick for some reason, we can add it to the window object after importing it in setup.js.. Thanks for your detailed report as always, @Ralpharoo. It is much appreciated!\nIt looks like this issue was actually fixed yesterday while fixing #1992 and #2286. The usual behaviour of the navigation stack is that after the animation, the previous screen would be hidden. However, at some point in the past, this was changed to not hide them. I believe this was to help with the use of React time-travel debug tools. So, in your example, the input field on page 1 is still technically visible, just hidden behind page 2. That is why it is possible to tab to it.\nYesterday, @frandiox changed the behaviour back to set display: none on inactive pages (see https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/2311). From my testing, this fixes the tab issue as it correctly hides the inputs.. Oh I didn't consider that scenario. I don't think we hide the tabs when they're not active, so the inputs would still be tabbable. Any ideas, @frandiox?. @frandiox I did consider this option, but had problems with it in the past. Specifically, setting overflow: hidden would reset scrollTop to 0. So, if the user had scrolled down the screen, and then opened an overlay, it would jump back up to the top of the page. In the end, this was a much more frustrating behaviour than the overlay scrolling the element behind it. Did you test that scenario on device?. I've done some testing and confirmed that overflow: hidden does sometimes reset the scroll bar to the top on iOS. It does not appear to happen when we set it on .page__content, but honestly I have no idea why that is.. Thanks for your report! This appears to be the same issue as https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/2245. . Thanks for the PR, @laelbe. This doesn't entirely fix the issue as I think it would break if the popover is placed in the body. I have fixed it in a separate PR (https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/2392). Your PR was very useful for helping with the fix. Thank you very much!. @Hirbod Thanks for the feedback! This is indeed a missing feature. I will look into implementing it for the next release..

Please re-open it if this is still happening.. @chronweigle I'm not sure why this PR was not responded to originally, sorry for the delay.\n\nI've tested it out, and it doesn't appear to actually fix the issue described in #2335. I can imagine this might fix issues where you were dynamically setting the active tab. However it does not seem to fix the issue where changing the actual tabs does not update the pages which the tabs relate to.. Hey @zabojad. Fran is taking a break from working on Onsen UI, so I'll be replying to Github issues from now on.\nMy instinct is that what you've outlined is a relatively obscure use case. I think that the onClick override you have mentioned is the easiest way to implement this. Is there a particular reason you feel this should be part of the library rather than a per-app override?. Ah, I understand. It does seem like a use case that is probably not totally uncommon. I suppose the simplest solution is to add an id to the ons-navigator. Then the ons-back-button would have an attribute, maybe navigator, where you specify the id of the navigator which it could control.\nIf you would still like to submit a PR, it would be very welcome!. Hi @siauderman, could you try to reproduce your issue on the Onsen UI Playground? It is hard to know what might be going wrong in your code without seeing it in action.. Yeah I don't think Codepen supports the transpiling you would need to show an example of the single file component. The error you are getting would suggest that renderExistingItems is not returning an element as it should. I suggest taking a look at the transpiled code and stepping through it with a debugger to see where it might be going wrong.. @zevenzeng Could you provide a bit more information on what your issue is? If possible, please try to reproduce it as outlined in the issue template.\n\n\nGo to https://onsen.io/playground/\nSelect a framework and a template\nModify the template until the issue is visible\nHit \"Report an issue\" button to open Github issue page. You need to be logged in on Github.\n\nThis uses the latest release of Onsen UI. In case the issue is not reproducible in desktop browsers, just follow the previous steps and also modify the platform version at the end (you can also open the mentioned site on a device).. I am closing this issue due to a lack of a reply.. We recently separated FastClick into a separate repository to make it a bit easier to maintain. I think the issue here could be that it now needs to be installed in your local repo. Try running yarn install and see if that works.. @zabojad npm install is pretty much the same, but with we have a yarn.lock file which will get used if you use yarn. This file ensures that you're getting the exact same versions that we build with.\n\nThe @ is important in the package name. It specifies a namespace on npm, so we can publish packages but still have them related to Onsen UI. You can see our FastClick package at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@onsenui/fastclick.. @kelifine Does this also happen with the latest version of Onsen UI (2.9.2)?. I am closing this issue due to a lack of a reply.. @ldenoue I used the splitter example (https://onsen.io/playground/?framework=vanilla&category=reference&module=splitter) on an iOS 10.1 emulator using UIWebView. I pushed the page and then swiped back to the original page. I did not get any error.\nCould you try reproducing it using an example from the Playground?. I think this issue is being caused by this commit: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/commit/d3a180e85d7e26bf895d7094250a8cbb1c03ff8c\n@ldenoue Which animation are you using with your ons-navigator?. swipe isn't an existing animation, which could be the cause of your issue. Try changing the animation to slide.. I'm pretty sure the error you're seeing is because the animation that is registered for the swipe does not exist. However, I'm not sure how your app could get into this situation, and I cannot reproduce it.\nThe line of code causing your issue is here: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/core/src/elements/ons-navigator/index.js#L335. We could just check if Animator exists, which would solve this problem for you. But I feel this error is indicative of something going wrong elsewhere.\nIf you could manage to reproduce this on the Onsen UI Playground, that would be really useful. Otherwise, could you try putting a breakpoint at the line of code linked above, and see what the value of animation and this.topPage.pushedOptions are?. Thanks for explaining! You are right, it would be useful to have a better error message. I will reopen this to remind me to add that.. @sbaechler Thank you very much for a documentation PR! I agree that the process of building documentation is a bit confusing. I will try to add something to the CONTRIBUTING file to better explain how to do it. Your PR looks good though. I will test it in the next few days.. @sbaechler I have updated CONTRIBUTING.md with instructions on how to set up and test the documentation, if you would like to test your own changes. Take a look at https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation. Great! Thanks very much for the PR! :+1:. That should work fine. Are you sure that the login function itself is being called? Try putting a console.log('Test') in there to see if it is being called.. Ah, OK! I'll close the issue, but if it turns out to be related to Onsen UI, feel free to re-open it.. To me, the name accordion applies to a whole list in which each item is expandable. Since this will be per-item, I suggest we use the name expandable.\nFor implementation, I like a combination of the two approaches you mentioned. ons-list-item would have an attribute called expandable. Then inside this, we have div.expandable-content, which is shown and hidden as necessary.\n<ons-list-item accordion>\n  <div class=\"left\">left stuff</div>\n  <div class=\"center\">center stuff</div>\n  <div class=\"right\">right stuff</div>\n  <div class=\"expandable-content\">accordion stuff</div>\n</ons-list-item>\nFor the arrow, you could use div.right. In the case that the user already has that element, it should not be modified.\nI don't think we need events for this, but the show and hide methods would be useful.\nSomething else to consider is how this will typically be used. The user will tap on the item to expand the panel. But to close it, clicks inside expandable-content should not do anything.\nOverall, I think this component would be quite useful. :+1:. It is hard to tell from your code what might be going wrong. Can you reproduce it on the Onsen UI Playground and export it to Codepen?. That sounds pretty strange. Are there any errors in the Chrome console?. Closing as this is no longer an issue.. Thanks for the PR @puku0x! I have taken a look at the issue, and though this PR does fix the problem for Angular, this issue could also theoretically happen with other bindings. I have fixed it in the core. Thanks for your contribution!. @sbaechler I don't think we need to have both 15 and 16 in the version. Just 16 should be fine. I haven't tested with React 16 yet, but I expect there shouldn't be any problems.. We've ended up adding just ^16.0.0 as a peer dependency, so I will close this PR.. Thanks for the report, @rcpinheiro. There is actually a waiting pull request to fix this (https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/2348), but it has not yet been tested. I will take a look at it over the next few days.. @swanandj91 For help with using Onsen UI, try posting on the Onsen UI Community Forum. The Github issues are mainly for bugs in the library itself. Thanks for using Onsen UI!. Thanks for the report @frosdqy, this is a good find. I had a quick look, and it could actually be a bit awkward to fix given how we currently handle the back button.\nThe problem is that ons-toast is created as a child of body, along with ons-navigator. When the toast receives the back button event, it passes it straight to its parent, which is body. When body receives a back button event, it closes the app. What we need is to pass the event to ons-navigator in a sensible way. Right now I can't think of a good way to do that.. @puku0x Do you think this is something you would be able to do? I think you have a much better understanding of Angular than the rest of us. Obviously there is no real rush with it, but it would be good for the binding to have the same features as the core.. It might be easier to start from scratch, rather than looking at the partially completed branch. I'm not sure if that branch will be very useful.. Hi @VinodkumarPachimadla, could you reproduce this on the Onsen UI Playground and export it to Codepen?. This sounds similar to a few issues we've seen in the past. It's hard to nail down exactly what causes this kind of flickering on iOS. It does seem like a Webkit issue, but at the same time it is obviously being caused by something we are doing in Onsen UI.\nIt might be a few days before I get a chance to look into this. If you do get a chance to put together a demo reproducing it, that would be really useful.. @kswedberg Since this happens with WkWebview, it could probably also be reproduced in Safari on iOS, without needing Cordova. I have an iOS device to test on, so I can test the issue if you are able to reproduce it in a demo.. Oh, that's very unfortunate, sorry to hear that. I hope you get everything back quickly.\nIf the issue only happens in Cordova, it's not problem to test that either, but working with Safari can make it a bit easier to track down an issue.. @moonlitnighta What tool are you using to import the modules? Is it Webpack? Perhaps there is an error with your configuration there.. @moonlitnighta I don't think that is the correct section to change. Babel is used to transpile your code, but it does not actually handle the importing. The exclude in that section just means that Babel won't transpile any files in node_modules.\nYou probably need to add a resolve section to your webpack configuration so that it will look for imports from there. For example, to build our Angular 2 bindings, we have this in our configuration:\nresolve: {\n    modules: [\n      'node_modules',\n    ],\n    extensions: ['.js', '.ts']\n  },\nI am not a Webpack expert, but I think this should do it. However, since this is not specifically an issue with Onsen UI, I am going to close the issue. If you need more help, take a look at our Community forum and Discord channel.. It looks like you may be using the wrong key for setting the options. In your third screenshot, you should use onsNavigatorOptions, not options.\nBelow is an example of how you might push a new page:\nthis.$emit('push-page', {\n  ...page2,\n  onsNavigatorOptions: {\n    animation: 'lift',\n    animationOptions: { duration: .5 }\n  }\n});. @moonlitnighta Hmm. Could you reproduce it on the Onsen UI Playground?. Closing due to lack of a reply. Please re-open if this is still an issue.. @puku0x This is actually a bug with the plugin, where it is not setting the window height correctly. It can be reproduced without OnsenUI:\n\ncordova create test\ncordova plugin add cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine\ncordova platform add ios\nAdd a storyboard splash screen to config.xml for iOS, and add viewport-fit=cover to the viewport meta tag\ncordova run ios\n\nTry inspecting it from Safari. As you hover over the name of the device in Safari's menu, you will see it outline the document size, showing the empty space at the bottom. You can also check window.innerHeight in the developer console, and it will be 734. After rotating twice, you can check it again and see it is now correct at 812.\nThere is already a bug report on the Cordova issue tracker. I suggest commenting there to add your voice to the issue.. Thanks for the PR, @b44rd! The default Onsen UI viewport tag prevents this zoom without needing to change the font size. However, if you have set your own, then it may be causing the zoom. Could you try the default one below?\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,user-scalable=no\">. @puku0x This is great, it works perfectly. I will merge it and add an example with some unit tests. Thanks for continued input, it is really appreciated.. @puku0x I just realised that if we are to add support for reactive forms, we will need it for all types, such as checkbox, radio and select. What do you think?. @puku0x Thanks for checking. I will hopefully get a chance to take a look at these some time next week. If you have time to update your pull request for any of those directives, that would be amazing.. @puku0x This is great, thank you very much! I will take a look at this soon.. That would be fantastic. Thank you for your continued input, @puku0x, it is greatly appreciated.. @GreyBlade Could you try this with the latest Onsen UI? Recently we changed most of the touch listeners to be passive, so it may fix this issue for you.. Closing due to lack of a reply. Please re-open if this is still an issue.. @airamrguez The Codepen you linked uses React 15. The behaviour is as I would expect, working with an object or number, but not string, as in the react-onsenui Icon docs. Is it different in React 16?. Thanks for updating the Codepen, I see the issue now. I'm not sure what could be causing it, as I haven't used React recently. Have you seen this for all versions of React 16, or just since 16.3?. @airamrguez Thanks for continuing to investigate. It looks like you have fixed your problem pretty quickly in that React issue! :+1: I will close this one.. I'm not sure either why we limit toasts to one line. The Material spec shows multiline in use too, so we should support that. I'll test your CSS and see if that is sufficient. Thanks for the example!\nBy the way, Fran is no longer working on Onsen UI. @emccorson and I are maintaining it in his place now.. Thanks for the PR, @DASPRiD, this is a good idea. I think it would be better to put it after the existing outline: 0 right here: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/e4bbee238e801d5d2ec93cb653a4a8ea01211f95/css-components/src/components/button.css#L50\nCould you change your code to put it there instead?. Great, thanks for the PR! :+1:. @jarvis1001 We'll need more info to figure out what's going wrong here. As mentioned in the issue template, could you try reproducing it on the Onsen UI Playground?. @jarvis1001 It doesn't look like this is an issue with Onsen UI, but with your Javascript. Maybe someone on Stack Overflow can help you with it.. Hey @ccloveaa, we have a few more fixes we want to get in the next release, but we're aiming to get 2.10.0 out in the next 2 or 3 weeks.. I believe this is actually a bug in React, not Onsen UI. A similar issue was reported in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/2403. This user ended up reporting the issue to the React team at https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12694, and fixed it there. A new version of React has not been released since, so I recommend rolling back your version until then. . @JstnPwll This looks to be related to https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/2272. As Fran mentioned in that issue, ons-tab isn't designed to be dynamically generated using a directive like ng-repeat, so it can cause unexpected behaviour. I will see if this is something we can change easily.. Oh that's interesting. What version were you using before? Maybe I can take a look through the commit history and see if I can track down what changed the behaviour.. Hmm, that is a pretty old version - a whole lot has changed since then, so it's probably not possible to track down when the old behaviour changed.\nThe issue is that the Tabbar is not designed to have its number of tabs changed after it is set up. In this case, I think that the Angular binding probably calls the TabbarElement.rewritables.ready too early. We would need to wait until after the tabs have been generated by ng-repeat.\nUnfortunately we don't have time at the moment to do this, but PRs are very welcome.. @avalanche1 The purpose of a lazy list is to allow fast scrolling of thousands of items. The way we keep it high performance, we don't put thousands of elements in the DOM at once, but only the ones that are visible on screen right now (maybe about ten).\nTo help keep the scrolling feel normal, and to size the scrollbar correctly, we need to know the height of each item. Setting the height in CSS will work for the ten items that are visible (and thus actually in the DOM), but not all the others that are not on screen. They don't exist in the DOM, so there is no CSS height to calculate. This is why calculateItemHeight is required - it lets you specify the height of the items without them needing to be in the DOM. If you don't want to use this, you will need to use List instead, where all the elements are in the DOM, and you can use CSS heights. Unless you have thousands of items, this will be perfectly fine.. Looks good, thanks for the fix! \ud83d\udc4d . @snazzypants It is possible that when you are setting the toolbar to be transparent, it is then showing the body, which would be white by default. The page colour will only apply to the page content, which does not go underneath the toolbar.\nIf this is not the case, could you reproduce it on the Playground so I can take a look? . @snazzypants Thanks for the example. The white you're seeing is the body colour, which you can see by changing the body's colour and seeing it through the toolbar. Looking into the code, it appears that the iPhone X mode is the only one actually behaving as it should. The toolbar should not overlay the page unless you specifically tell it to. So, the toolbar should always be white in this case, not just in iPhone X mode. I'll need to check exactly why this behaviour is inconsistent.\nAnyway, to get the toolbar working as you expect it, you need to add the modifier cover-content, as below. It is in the ons-toolbar docs, but not very obvious.\nhtml\n<ons-toolbar modifier=\"transparent cover-content\">. Ah I understand what you mean. Fixing this is a bit awkward since the current default behaviour isn't quite what might be expected. I'll take a look and see if there is a workable solution. The actual CSS that causes it is in this file: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/b9aa43af710ed2afaeca2bd96a2d64ae19ab6ce4/css-components/src/iphonex-support/combination.css. \nIn the meantime I would suggest overriding this in your app's CSS based on the CSS rules in the file above.. Thanks for your PRs, @karlvr. I haven't spent much time yet working with the React bindings, so your contribution is much appreciated! It may take me a little while to test, but it looks good at first glance.. @karlvr Sorry it's taken so long to merge this. I've finally had some time to spend on the React bindings. Thanks for the PR!. @puku0x Thanks for the PR! It looks like this is just a matter of updating the dependencies and fixing some paths for the examples. Did you come across any other issues?. @puku0x There are quite a few failing tests -- take a look at the latest build result on CircleCI. If you run the tests locally (cd bindings/angular2 && npm run test), you should see the same results.\nUnfortunately I think there are quite a few things that have broken as a result of this upgrade to Angular 6.. @puku0x Thanks for the quick fix!\nUpgrading CircleCI to Node v8 is fine. You can change it yourself in this file:\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml#L6\nChange the image to circleci/node:8-browsers, and that should fix it.. It looks like it's failing now due to an issue with Sauce Labs. I don't think it has anything to do with your changes. I'll investigate now.. @puku0x It turns out that when CircleCI builds from pull requests, it does not include the private keys required for Sauce Labs. This is because someone could submit a PR which would log those publicly. I think this must be why CircleCI was originally disabled for PRs on here, because the Sauce tests will fail.\nHowever, I ran the tests manually and it looks good. Thank you!. @ayaanraj The Aurelia binding is community-maintained, so I recommend posting your issue on their issue tracker.\nOn another note, you should not directly use any functions which have an underscore in front of them, such as _hide. These are private functions, only supposed to be used by the Onsen UI library itself. They may be renamed or disappear in a new release without any warning.. Failing tests are due to config, so I will merge.. Thanks for the detailed report, @ychongsaytc. It looks like Fran fixed this in this commit. We have just released onsenui@2.10.0, which includes this fix. Could you test with 2.10.0 and see if the issue is fixed?. @ychongsaytc Thanks for confirming you are still having the issue, and for your detailed report. However, I an unable to reproduce the scrolling issues you show in your video.\nI tested your code on an iPhone X (iOS 11.3) in both Safari and a Cordova app with cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine. The scrolling is fine after pulling to refresh, even close to the top.\nCould you detail exactly how to reproduce the problem?. @ychongsaytc Thanks for the explanation, I'm glad you managed to fix your issue.. Thanks for the report @FredGr. It looks like this was caused by a fix for https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/2324. It seems to have caused a race condition with the loading of tabs, so it only happens in some cases, which is why we did not come across it in our testing.\nI have fixed it now. I will wait to see if there are any other bug reports from the release of 2.10.0, and will push out 2.10.1 next week with this fix and any others that may come along. Until then, I recommend going back to 2.9.2.. @rj-david The latest React bindings (1.11.0) introduced the visible prop for Tabbar. It has the same effect as hideTabs would, but the naming is more consistent with the rest of the React components.. @rodryquintero The routing system in Onsen UI is the recommended way of handling routing in mobile apps. It makes correct animation easier, and in our experience is less prone to causing confusing bugs. Additionally, most of the bindings such as Vue and React will provide their own routers which can provide URL-based routing.\nHowever, I appreciate that while developing, losing your state can be annoying. You could add your own URL-based routing quite simply on top of the Onsen UI router. If it's just for the purposes of development, it could be as simple as something like this:\n```javascript\nvar PAGES = {\n  page1: 'page1.html',\n  page2: 'page2.html'\n};\nvar changePageByUrl = function() {\n  var newPage;\n  if (location.hash) {\n    newPage = location.hash.split('#')[1];\n  }\nif (PAGES[newPage]) {\n    setImmediate(function() {\n      document.querySelector('ons-navigator').pushPage(PAGES[newPage]);\n    });\n  }\n}\nons.ready(function (event) {\n  changePageByUrl();\n  window.addEventListener('hashchange', changePageByUrl);\n});\n```\nThis would change the active page on first load based on the hash, and also whenever the hash changes.. This was previously reported in https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/2430 and fixed a week ago. I meant to release a new version last week but unfortunately didn't get a chance. I will do it today and get this fix out.. @pixelgroup-israel Thanks for the report. It turns out this is not specifically an issue with the binding, but the core itself. If an expandable list item's compile is called more than once, it causes issues. ng-repeat is an exact scenario where this happens. I have fixed it and will release it with 2.10.1 which should be out later today.. @MissMonacoin Thanks for the PR! We recently changed ons-toast to support multiple lines of text. It seems that it broke the padding of Material toasts. \nHowever, the vertical padding needs to be 16px rather than 24px. So, I think it should be:\npadding: 16px 24px;\nIf you change your PR to that, then it is good to merge \ud83d\udc4d . Great! \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002. @mamcx Your example doesn't use v-ons-lazy-repeat at all?\nGenerally speaking though, v-ons-list is recommended unless you have many hundreds of items. The performance difference is typically not noticeable, and it is much more flexible.. Each item in v-ons-lazy-repeat must be a separate component. It is not possible for use v-for. For a list of 20,000 items, v-for would generate all 20,000 items and put them in the DOM. In the case of a normal v-ons-list-item, that would work, but would be incredibly slow.\nThe purpose of v-ons-lazy-repeat is to only put as many elements in the DOM as are required to fill up the screen. So, it puts maybe 10 items in the DOM instead of 20,000. When an item scrolls off screen, it is removed from the DOM. If you used v-for, it would not be possible to do this. When an item is about to appear on screen, renderItem is called with the index of the item. You then can use this index to determine which item to render.\nI suggest taking a look at the example on the Playground, and editing it to see how you can apply it to your case.. Ah, I see. Unfortunately we don't have any plan to implement that kind of functionality at the moment, as it would take some time and increase the complexity of v-ons-lazy-repeat. However, PRs are always welcome if you are interested!. @NeerajKumar31 Please fill out the template as in the original post so I can have a better idea of what's going on (Onsen UI version, binding version etc.). @J261 Thanks for the report. I suspect we have never supported these attributes. Unfortunately I won't have time to fix this at the moment, but PRs are very welcome!. @johnso4 Could you check if this also happens with just a normal search input (<input type=\"search\">)?. Thanks for the detailed report! I am able to reproduce the issue you are describing. I haven't worked much with ons-lazy-repeat, but as far as I know, it was not really originally developed to handle dynamic content. However, a lot of users do want to use it that way, so we should improve that functionality. I will take a look and see what I can do here.. I have fixed this, and it works now for all your cases. I have added some more unit test cases so that hopefully this will be more resilient in the future.. Most users only provide a fraction of the detail you did, so it was a very easy bug to track down and fix. Thank you for the great report!\nNormally you would wait for the next release to get the fix, but at the moment I'm not sure when that will be. It is possible to download a zip of the latest build from https://onsenui.github.io/latest-build/. There have been no major changes since the last release, so you shouldn't find any big surprises.. When using onsNavigatorProps, you must also define props on the page that is being extended. Otherwise, these props will not be available. In your example, change page2 to look like this:\nconst page2 = {\n  key: 'page2',\n  template: '#page2',\n  props: {\n    foo: {\n      type: Number\n    }\n  }\n};\nThis was not mentioned in the docs, so I am going to update the docs to make this clear.. Thanks for the report. Currently v-ons-input is a simple wrapper for ons-input and so does not do anything extra for Vue. This would be a nice feature to have, though I do not have the time to work on it at the moment. PRs are welcome as always :). Thanks for the heads up, I hadn't realised that. I guess there is no immediate rush to change, but we should get on this in the next few weeks.. Anything to improve the bindings sounds good to me. Before I merge this, could you update bindings/angular2/examples/tabbar.ts to show this way of using it? Do you think there are any useful unit tests that could be added for it? We are currently trying to improve our test coverage.. Great! Thanks for the added example and tests, @puku0x. \ud83d\ude04 . Such a simple fix, wonderful! Thanks @puku0x :+1:. Thanks for the report and example. This seems to be caused by the GestureDetector receiving both touchend and mouseup events one after another. I guess that would explain why it only happens in dev tools, because a browser would not normally fire both. I wonder if this is a regression in Chrome. Did this only start with Chrome 67?. Looking into this a bit more, it definitely feels like an issue with Chrome. This incorrectly-fired doubletap only happens for me when I open the device mode after opening the page. If I reload with device mode already opened, then doubletap works as expected. Is this the same for you, @mrphuzz?. It might depend on the kind of device that you're emulating in Chrome. When the GestureDetector detects that it can use touch events on a mobile device, it doesn't add mouse events. But if it does not detect this, then the mouse events will be added along with touch events, which would cause this, and also explain the behaviour I was seeing.\nCan you check ons.GestureDetector.NO_MOUSEEVENTS in the console? It should be true. Changing it won't make a difference, as it it only used on first load, but I expect that it must be false for you.. Thanks for the report. I tried to reproduce in Vanilla JS without success. I didn't have time to try with the React bindings, unfortunately.\nHere is a Codepen of what I tried. Please feel free to edit it to see if you can reproduce it there: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/GGwZOY. Thanks for the detailed update, @mittermayr, it's much appreciated!. Sounds like a good idea to me. At this stage, I think you have a better understanding of the Angular bindings than me, @puku0x. \ud83d\ude04 Would you be able to submit a PR for this?. I've managed to figure out what's causing this, but I'm not sure how to fix it.\nThe steps go something like below. It's worth noting that v-ons-page is basically a wrapper for ons-page, and most of the operations are directly on ons-page. \n1. v-ons-page creates ons-page - <ons-page class=\"page\">\n2. ons-bottom-toolbar adds the page-with-bottom-toolbar class - <ons-page class=\"page page-with-bottom-toolbar\">\n3.  Vue finds the custom classes, and sets them on ons-page, overwriting the existing ones - <ons-page class=\"random classes\">\n4. Onsen UI detects this class change, and re-adds the page's default classes - <ons-page class=\"page random classes\">\nThe problem here is step 4. There's nothing we can do to prevent Vue from overwriting the class, but we can restore the previous classes, which is what step 4 is supposed to do. What it actually restores is the default classes - page-with-bottom-toolbar is not one of these, because it is added to the page by the toolbar. I'm not sure this is the correct approach. I think the page should add its own class if it has a toolbar child.\nI will need to think about this a bit more, so I suggest using @puku0x's workaround for now.. I've tested with this for a while since my last comment, and I think that step 2 should be handled by ons-page, not ons-bottom-toolbar. The one problem is that this doesn't handle the case where the toolbar is added after the page is loaded, but I'm pretty sure there would be other unrelated issue in this case anyway. I have created a PR, which should get merged soon.. @subdigit This fix is in onsenui@2.10.2. I'm not sure if I mentioned previously, but the issue was actually in the core, not the Vue bindings. So, just update to the latest version of Onsen UI and you'll be good to go.. This may just be a problem with your Javascript. Looking at it with the Chrome Developer Tools, I can see an error, which could prevent the app from loading completely.\nelse if (page.id === 'feed') {\n    page.querySelector('#enter-setup').onclick = function () {\n        document.querySelector('#myNavigator').pushPage('setup-return.html', { data: { title: 'Auto' } });\n    };\n}\nThere is no element with the ID enter-setup in your example. So when you try to set onclick, the browser gives an error. This may be the reason it does not load correctly.\nAs this is not an issue with Onsen UI itself, I will close this issue. I recommend checking out the Onsen UI Discord if you have more questions.. Apologies, I put in the wrong link. I have edited my comment with the correct invite link.. Thanks for the report. I'm not sure exactly what is happening here, but it appears to be some sort of race condition, causing the onResize handler for the tabs to never be attached. In the example you linked, if you tap Push Page and then go back, causing the tabs to be re-initialised, the resize works as expected. So I think it is some timing issue when the page first loads.\nFor now you can call _show on the tab bar to reinitialise it. In the linked example, use this workaround in your ons.ready, after the render:\ndocument.querySelector('ons-tabbar')._show();. @niboan I have released onsenui@2.10.3 with the Angular bindings correctly minified. I have checked manually to make sure of it!\nI'm not sure why 2.10.2 has an empty file. It could have been due to an error in the release process which was not caught. I have updated our release scripts to make it much more likely that we'll catch an issue like this in the future.. This is the second issue caused by that PR. The first caused an issue with the Theme Roller, which we fixed by changing the CSS parser. \nI think the line added in that PR should be removed, and instead the following added at this line:\ncss\n.button::-moz-focus-inner {\n  outline: 0;\n}\nCould you check if that fixes the issue?. Great! Feel free to create a PR and merge it right away if you have time. If not, I will do it in the morning.. It is possible to set a key for tabs, as in this example. Is it not working for you?\nAs for scrolling tabs, it is not currently supported, though it is a good idea. We will look into it!. That does look like it should work. I'm not sure why it wouldn't. Can you reproduce the issue on the Playground?\nAs for customising the button, take a look at the Onsen UI Theme Roller. It is the best way to change the styles of Onsen UI components.. Your gist is missing ../js/utils.js so kaomojis is undefined. Are you able to reproduce the issue without that library? It would help to track down the problem.\nThere seems to be an issue with the Theme Roller for Onsen UI 2.10.2 and 2.10.3. It has been fixed for the next release, but that is not out yet. For now, please select 2.10.1 from the dropdown. It will be OK even though your app uses 2.10.2.. Thanks for the demo. There are a few things factoring into this. The reason I could not reproduce it originally is because this warning was only introduced in Vue 2.5.10 (see https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7323).\nIt is being caused by name: \"KaomojiList\", in KaomojiList.vue. Vue ends up using this name as a key for v-ons-page. Since the tab bar creates multiple v-ons-pages, the app ends up with multiple pages using the same key, KaomojiList. If you remove that name, then the warning goes away.\nOn your button question, if you want to dynamically change the colour, then it is best to simply do that by creating your own CSS classes and applying those.. This seems to be a similar issue to #2467. Though I thought I tested that with the Vue bindings, and it worked fine. In that case, it's a timing issue, which causes the resize event handler not to be added in the first place. It could be the same here.\nFor a workaround, you could try manually forcing the refresh event handler to be added. It is done in the tabbar's _show method. So, inside ons.ready, add:\njavascript\ndocument.querySelector('ons-tabbar')._show();. It's hard to say what this behaviour should be. When the user specifically selects a platform, they may expect it to return true in this case. Perhaps we could offer a way of toggling the boolean _ignorePlatformSelect in platform.js, which is currently what controls whether these functions factor in the user's select setting. This would allow us to keep the current behaviour, but give the option for an override.\nAn update to the documentation is probably the most important part of this though, to make it clear to users exactly how this works.. Thanks for your feedback. @emccorson The long term plan will be to eventually put the AngularJS bindings into LTS mode (maybe towards the end of this year). For now, I want to just move the binding into its own npm package, to make that transition easier down the line.\nI think there are a few ways we can notify users about the change if they have upgraded and not realised that Angular is no longer in the core, and they need to install the new package. I have a few ideas. \n\nAdd a postinstall script to the package.json which will warn users about the change\nHow long should we keep this there? I expect some AngularJS users may not upgrade for a long time. Is it possible to detect which version it has been upgraded from?\nReplace angular-onsenui.js in the distribution package with a simple file which simply logs an error in the console explaining how to upgrade.\nI think this could be quite a simple solution, and does not affect non-AngularJS users, unlike the warning above\n\nOn the version numbering, I think 2.11.0 will be OK. Looking at the changelog, whenever a breaking change has been made, the minor version has been increased. So this numbering is in keeping with what has been historically done.. I have created a PR to do this, which I would appreciate a review of if either of you have time, @emccorson and @puku0x. It is at https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/2483.. This more generally seems to be related to React's move to asynchronous rendering, which could require big changes within our bindings.\nFor now though, I agree we should just use the renamed versions. I can't find any release date for React 17, so I presume it is not imminent.\nFor maximum compatibility, I would like to keep both functions (both componentWillRecieveProps and UNSAFE_componentWillRecieveProps). I think we should be able to do this easily inside the components' constructors by setting this.UNSAFE_componentWillRecieveProps = this.componentWillRecieveProps.. Good spot, @emccorson. The AngularJS bindings need to be built before building the core, or else nothing will be copied in. I'm glad that it fails properly!\nI had updated the Circle CI script, but forgot the build instructions. I've changed them now. This will only be needed until 2.11.0, when we remove the bindings from the core, so we should update the instructions again when we do that.. It looks like adding prevent-tap on ons-list-item itself will have no effect, only its children. Is this correct?\nOn another note, I found this slightly confusing to read. Maybe add one extra set of brackets so it reads like this:\nthis.tapped || \n(this !== e.target && (this._shouldIgnoreTap(e.target) || util.findParent(e.target, this._shouldIgnoreTap, p => p === this))\n. We are only applying this for iOS now, it seems, so it's worth updating this comment to reflect that. Can we set this to passive: true if we use the overflow: hidden scroll fix?. Do we need to keep this param?. I've just realised I mis-read the line this._shouldFixScroll = util.globals.actualMobileOS !== 'other'; as actualMobileIOS. Ignore this comment, and also the next one!. I don't understand what you mean by FLOC here?. Is this empty registerOnTouched function actually required?. Thanks for the link to the docs. If we do not call the argument fn as described in the docs, does Angular still mark the fields as touched correctly?. If we completely remove registerOnTouched, does it throw an error? My expectation would be that if it doesn't exist, Angular would use the default behaviour.\nIf removing registerOnTouched doesn't work, perhaps we can change it to:\nregisterOnTouched(fn: any) {\n  fn();\n}. Ah yes, of course. My suggestion would not work, because it was called in the registration handler. This looks like a good solution to me. :+1:. Good spot! This is not covered by our .eslintrc file, but looking across the codebase, if ( with a space is used a lot more. I'll take a look at what else I can add to our linting. :+1:. I would rephrase this change to not use the word ignore, more like By default, will return manually selected platform if it is set. The = false default isn't necessary here, since undefined is falsy anyway. This is a better implementation than I was originally thinking of, nice one. I think this parameter could be renamed though. How about forceActualPlatform?. I'm not a fan of this shorthand. It can easily be read as a mistake if someone doesn't totally understand how && works. I'd prefer a simple if statement.. If we can add it to the eslint file, that would be great. This code all gets put through babel and minified, so saving space is not a concern :). ",

    "misterjunio": "Fixed in v2 \ud83d\ude04 . @luidiva do you still experience this problem? Could you create a pen or maybe try to reproduce it on the tutorial app and create a new issue?. @erikcw I read what you reported and I agree with @munsterlander, nothing wrong with the back button. I'll close this. @puku0x @nodefish Sorry for the delay. I cannot reproduce your errors with the latest release (2.2.2). Do you mind checking if they keep occurring to you?. @nodefish you're right, I managed to recreate your issue and opened another ticket (#1952). I fixed it already and will make a PR, thanks for your input \ud83d\udc4d . @jitu-git In version 2.1.0 we added ons-select component. If you are able to update and use it your problems should be gone. @jitu-git @rknell Could you check if you still have this issue in Onsen UI's latest release?. I guess this is ok now, closing this.. @ThomasLochbrunner I couldn't reproduce your errors so I assume it got solved meanwhile. Anyway the point of Onsen is to emulate native apps so I would say that having a tabbar inside the splitter-side is a poor design idea from the start and not an intended component use to begin with so I will close this issue. @Ziggoto which versions of onsenui and react-onsenui are you using? I remembered I fixed it in #1918, released on onsenui@2.2.4 and react-onsenui@1.3.0. I tried again now and it seems to be working, can you provide an example where it doesn't?. @bdedardel I tried your code with the latest Onsen UI releases and everything seems fine, no errors thrown from either navigator or splitter. You can just grab your bug1623 code, remove the body scripts and add the following ones on the head:\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\nThey are the latest releases of Onsen UI and Angular 1.5.8. Everything should run smoothly.. @bdedardel I guess everything is fine now so I will close this issue \ud83d\udc4d . @vjoomens we are about to remove ons-sliding-menu so like @asial-matagawa recommended I would switch (pun intended) to ons-splitter, I think the problem should be gone.\n@Chozzle can you provide an example where it does not work for you? It is working for me..\nSmall example: https://codepen.io/misterjunio/pen/vxqBvZ?editors=1011. I believe the problem is solved in recent versions, closing this.. @lyf1988 while I can't tell why react-select is not working properly maybe I can suggest you use Onsen UI's select? It has been added in react-onsenui@1.2.0. @asial-matagawa Like I discussed with @anatoo this does not seem to be a bug, it's just a consequence of the tabs being loaded asynchronously. I suggested a solution for choosing the tab dynamically on load by touching the DOM here. It's a bit dirty but I don't see another possibility. @asial-matagawa while looking into this issue I found a different bug in the latest Onsen UI version which I fixed and that solves this problem as well. Even though my solution is working with ons-splitter instead we are removing the ons-sliding-menu component anyway so we can close this issue. I will create a PR to close it now.. @frankdiox On it. @frankdiox Regarding your points:\n\n\nI was checking and I don't think we need var for select. As you said ng-model already allows ng-change listeners and with ng-options users can populate the field so I don't predict they will need more DOM manipulation that justifies creating a special view for this element.\n\n\nI added the docs. Guess there are no other methods than those 3.\n\n\nNot sure what you mean. Do you want to allow them to create their own select (for instance with ng-options) inside ons-select? And in that case the purpose of ons-select would be basically just styling, is that it?. @frankdiox Alright, I pushed those changes in the PR fix-ons-select \ud83d\udc4d . @frankdiox Of course \ud83d\ude26 . @frankdiox That's very cool. A suggestion though: maybe we should create a \"sandbox\" page in the tutorial app, just to guarantee users don't get confused about having to reproduce their issue in a \"tutorial\". @frandiox Close this maybe? \ud83d\ude0f . @puku0x Thanks for reporting, on it. Actually we're in the process of dropping Stylus for another styling tool and it will be fixed for that release \ud83d\udc4d . @puku0x We fixed it so I'm closing this now. Thanks again. @anatoo Thank you \ud83d\udc4d . @nickpdiana We treat inputs different than radio buttons, checkboxes, selects and ranges as text inputs. Is there a specific reason why you need the type of the variable to be number?. I think you may be a bit confused about what the input type number means because even a vanilla input will give you a string variable. From the link you posted:\n\n\n\ntype = \"number\"\nSpecifies that its input element is a precise control for setting the element\u2019s value to a string representing a number.\n\nYou can also try to log the typeof the element's value and it should give you string.\nAbout the second point I'm not sure I am able to reproduce because both with and without ons- I get the keyboard but on the numbers and symbols pad which is the expected behavior.. You're right, I just fixed it and it should be merged soon \ud83d\ude03  Thank you.. @frankdiox Fancy \ud83d\ude04  should be good to merge now \ud83d\udc4d . @frankdiox Done \ud83d\udc4d . @anatoo Yep, working on it. @anatoo @asial-matagawa Should be good now. At @frandiox's suggestion maybe later I'll try to prevent the issue on the ons-range side to promote decoupling but for now it works well and I think we can merge.. @asial-matagawa The worst kind \ud83d\ude2c . @NickPadilla you're right, Firefox is not showing any progress-circular. @asial-matagawa do you think it may have something to do with your fix in #1867?. @asial-matagawa are you saying we should add our own custom arrow?. @frandiox Whaaat I didn't notice you had changed it, I thought I was only removing the setup thing, I'm sorry. I just pushed a version with just the gesture detection change. If it's ok please merge it. @asial-matagawa great, I'll merge it then \ud83d\udc4d . I have traced down the problem to these lines. For some reason in Angular2 when the modechange event is first detected on the ons-splitter-side the e.target.parentNode (i.e. the ons-splitter) is already initialized but it doesn't have ons-splitter-content yet. So when the _layout() function checks for this.content it gets undefined. In the other bindings the element is already fully loaded with content and mask. @anatoo @asial-matagawa can you figure out why is Angular2 calling this \"too soon\"? Also shouldn't it work anyway with the contentReady() call? I thought this method was supposed to wait until the component and its children were completely initialized.. @asial-matagawa That seems to fix it indeed. But I don't get it, doesn't that wait for ons-splitter-side to be ready and not ons-splitter-content?. @asial-matagawa When I said\n\nThat seems to fix it\n\nI actually tried it and it worked \ud83d\ude04 . @asial-matagawa Yes you're right. I will create a PR with the fix then \ud83d\udc4d . @asial-matagawa It seems to break somethings in Safari again \ud83d\ude1e  I have no other ideas so I guess I'll leave that issue for the moment. @frandiox I got the same as @asial-matagawa, using Safari 10.1 \ud83d\udc4d . @Chozzle we are taking care of this issue but it's trickier than expected and we need to perform some modifications in the core to make it work. Meanwhile you can just keep no space in the splitter-content. Amazing the damage a small blank space can do \ud83d\ude04 . @frandiox I tested the animations in Safari. The reveal seems totally fine, the push gets just a little sticky if I shake it really, really fast to both sides but not enough to worry I think. I would suggest to btw fix the core and angular1 examples of the splitter where the splitter-side on the right has a threshold-ratio-should-open attribute that I guess doesn't exist anymore and also update the documentation of the core and all bindings to reflect the new animations.. @frandiox It would be cool to have an ons-item element that we can reuse in other components. That would make the action sheet a hybrid between the options you presented: the action sheet could control the item styling but allow the user to use other components inside as well. There would be no need for a list.. @asial-matagawa I think the problem is like @frandiox said the default option since ons-list-items get a short divider while inside an action sheet they should have no divider. The whole styling becomes harder due to the base styles of the ons-list and it would be less flexible for users as they might wish to use buttons or something else. @rgins16 indeed with #1934 I have made the ons-page throw the destroy event when it is unloaded. However I still don't get what you mean by\n\nThe page has not been destroyed.\n\nCan you give an example that shows when that happens? My pages are completely reloaded, you can check by replacing the destroy listener in your example with an init one.. @rgins16 I took the example you provided above, added jQuery, placed <div id=\"datepicker\"></div> in the home page (also added an id=\"myHome\" to it) and then on the controller:\ndocument.getElementById('navi').addEventListener('init', (e) => {\n  if (e.target.id === \"myHome\") {\n    $(\"#datepicker\").datepicker();\n    $(\"#datepicker\").datepicker(\"setDate\", \"10/12/2012\");\n  }\n})\nNow even if I navigate to the same page on the menu the date is always reset to \"10/12/2012\". Are you doing something more complicated or does this work for you?\nAnyway I think we can close this issue and discuss any further questions in the community forum... @rgins16 I took the same code as I explained in my last comment and added the previous listener for destroy alongside the init one (pen here but you still need to manually add the fix though). Everything works as expected, destroy before init so I can't really reproduce your problem \ud83d\ude15 . @rgins16 I updated the pen in my last comment to use the latest version and everything works as expected so I consider this fixed. Closing the issue.. @airamrguez I tried to merge but yarn install timed out when fetching the react-dom-15.5.3 package, which did not happen locally for me with npm. Do you have any idea what the issue might be? Did you use yarn?. @airamrguez hum I tried locally and it timed out in a different package, prop-types-15.5.6. Which version of yarn are you using?. @airamrguez thanks \ud83d\udc4d . I agree it's useful for users to have access to the createElement function. So using the portal to make all dialogs work in a similar fashion it's a great idea imo.. I think no developer will expect fetching from the external file to be synchronous so it should be fine to keep it synchronous for in-line and returning a promise if in an outside template.. @frandiox looks good on Safari \ud83d\udc4d  and I think ons.actionSheet() would be more intuitive. @asial-matagawa sure, will do. @asial-matagawa tested and working in all iOS versions\n@frandiox I suppose the font thing is some issue in my environment. Other than that maybe you can change the example title to Action sheet and make the buttons hide it. Everything looks good on Safari in desktop and iOS 10 \ud83d\udc4d . Hum I think @anatoo has a point with the verb thing and ons.notification.action would have the same problem but you're also right that ons.create- gives the wrong idea. I would go for either ons.openActionSheet or ons.requestAction. @frandiox @asial-matagawa I think the ons-card is ready. Please review and merge it when you find time \ud83d\udc4d . @asial-matagawa about the format,\nhtml\n<ons-card>\n  <div class=\"title\">...</div>\n  <div class=\"content\">...</div>\n</ons-card>\nis merely a possibility, obviously users can add any other type of content they wish.\nAbout the example I tried to tweak it a little bit, not sure if it's closer to what you meant.\nDo you think that in general we should provide more 'building blocks' for the cards? Like specific action buttons and things like that? If so I'll need to ask @anatoo for the CSS... @anatoo Thanks. I will check this today \ud83d\udc4d . @anatoo everything looks good. The code is already merged in #1965 along with the ons-card component but I guess thee's no problem if you merge this PR first anyway.. Looks great.\nAbout the API I think there is no problem in leaving all the options open, some users may prefer one or another.\n1. Actually I think the preferred behavior is that the toast fades out automatically but to make it default we'd have to tweak the API a little bit I guess so maybe it's fine;\n2. ons.notification.toast sounds very natural;\n3. I can't imagine a time when the user wants to receive more than one toast at once so I wouldn't do this;\n4. Don't know if that feels native as I don't think I ever saw that.\nAs an extra I would say that my idea of a toast (may be wrong) is that it's a kind of alert that targets more the app in general instead of a specific page, you know? So perhaps we could find a way to keep it alive?. @ilmuwebsite the latest Onsen UI provides ons.preload(templatePaths) so you can cache templates on app start, which should improve the performance a bit. Please try and let us know if it works better on your case. @frandiox I'm not sure what you mean by detaching the first child when 'it's not needed'. How would we know if it's needed or not?. @maverickpravin what you're looking for is not directly related to Onsen UI. For adding deep links to your hybrid app please consider using a plugin such as this one.. I think that makes sense, my only concern is the name ons-text-input because there are other types of inputs such as file or image that maybe users are making use of ons-input for and ons-text-input may be a bit misleading.. @anatoo sure but a user who is not aware of that may be looking for an ons-input. Idk, maybe I'm being pessimistic \ud83d\ude04  I guess it's fine. @tehg00se this is not currently on the table but you can have a look at this thread in the Community for some ideas.. @frandiox everything looks good on the desktop and iOS 10. I think I can update Angular2 \ud83d\udc4d . @frandiox actually as far as I investigated the components work as-is in the Angular2 bindings, no need for new directives, maybe @asial-matagawa has a better understanding and can confirm that.. @frandiox I know it changes the API a bit but why don't we return an object for prompts with a value and index fields? That line you changed in the commit would be something like\nconst resolveValue = options.isPrompt ? {value: el.input.value, index: index} : index;. @frandiox I know we should be consistent but we weren't already by returning null when canceled and -1 in the other dialogs. What's your idea with primaryButtonIndex? Making the first one the cancelling button?. @frandiox yes I know that I was just saying that since it was already a bit different maybe an object would be the easiest solution but I admit that's quite a lot different. Your idea with OK as primary seems good to me. @frandiox I think the lowest version we have here is 8.4.1, seems to be working flawlessly there. About the hooks inside the templates I think it's a very good idea. Maybe I would remove hook from the naming though, page.init seems intuitive for me.. Passed all manual tests \ud83d\udc4d . Nothing to add, I think everything looks good \ud83d\ude03 . I agree with both approaches, on one hand usually 'magic' is easier for the user but yes, maybe it would be overly complicated and at the same time the hooks provide some more control, so I'd say we go for this simpler solution.. Looks good in iOS 8, 9 and 10 \ud83d\udc4c . @maverickpravin sorry for the delay. In which version of Onsen UI does this happen to you?\n@frandiox I don't have a 5.5 either. On Android 6 with the latest release it looks ok.. @maverickpravin figured out the issue, it was due to the font size display on the phone being set to 'small', that was causing the line-height property to be changed in the WebView. Funny enough. After trying really hard with the example we have I was able to \"break\" the toast in both platforms by tapping repeatedly and really fast in the toggling button (at some point it would start hiding the message after opening) but I think it's ok and performance wise really good. No reflows.. @rgins16 thanks for reporting. You're right, we weren't taking into account the borders when calculating the element's size, that's why the scroll was more than what it should be (in your case 254px = 250px width + 4px border). I just pushed a fix, should be out in the next release.. @bdedardel could you try to recreate the issue either here or in Codepen or something so we can take a look?. @ericbehughes I believe this has already been fixed. Could you try the latest vue-onsenui@2.0.0-rc.0?. @frandiox yep the problem seems to originate from this line in the material modifier definition.\nI agree the transparent one doesn't make sense. Looking at that same file all it does is applying the regular --text-input\u2753 . @frandiox agreed, this is quite useful.. @ceskomira90 I believe there is a cleaner way to do this. If you put the tabbar in a template and set it as the first page of the navigator then you can reset to that page if the login fails and pass the desired data to reload. Take a look at this pen.. @ceskomira90 you don't need another navigator, you can do what you said by calling the tabbar's setActiveTab() on page init. Check out the updated pen \ud83d\ude09 . @italomaia actually the preferred way is to sync the index prop, as done in the tutorial example that you can check in the <v-ons-tabbar> reference page. Please make sure you are using the latest version of vue-onsenui, or at least 2.0.0-beta.4.. @shivavelingker why not in your login function, after showing the dialog, focusing its button? Maybe with a timeout to make sure it works like setTimeout(function() { document.querySelector('.alert-dialog-button').focus(); },100);. @asial-matagawa sure, will do. @frandiox @asial-matagawa tested in all devices, no issues found \ud83d\udc4d . @frandiox thanks for the feedback.\n Only <button> works, I left the class in the example by mistake.\n Agreed on the rest, tabbar-id, active-index and postchange it is.. @asial-matagawa I followed the Tabbar but that also works, I don't mind changing if you think it's more intuitive.. @anatoo can I ask for your help with something, please? If you checkout this branch you can see that in all the frameworks I have created an example with ons-segment inside ons-toolbar. Everything is fine except in Angular 2, where instead of being vertically centered, the segment appears on the top of the toolbar. In the inspector I see that it's getting a different height but the styles are exactly the same in both cases so I can't figure out why that's happening. Do you mind taking a look when you have some time?. @frandiox to be honest the name does not sound too good but truth is I can't come up with a better one \ud83d\ude05  ons.getScriptPage() seems ok. @puku0x thanks for reporting but that was already reported and fixed, will be out soon in the next release \ud83d\udc4d . Done. Sumimasen \u274c . @badlee it's a nice idea but shouldn't the default one be kept if the user doesn't provide a custom one?\nLike return pageLoader ? defaultPageLoader = pageLoader : defaultPageLoader;. oooops, you're partially right, it should be border-top-width and border-bottom-width.

I think with this change we would not need to do much of DOM manipulation and only do css/style changes, that would make integration much in react much easier.\n@frankdiox great!\n. @frankdiox great, what is the '_remove-element' property used for in the code?\n. @frankdiox thanks looks good now, that makes more sense now, not to have both an attribute and an option. \n. i used the package \"npm install --dev-save gulp-babel\", where should i add this?\n. @ggn06awu this is still in the developer state and this commit is only for general discussion how it will/ could look like, but esentially we will support react in OnsenUI 2.0. We will keep you updated!\n. closing this pull request for now, but have made significant progress and will keep you updated\n. @argelius ok, will do it then, i assigned it to myself, since i am working on the tests right now anyway.\n. @argelius added the test in a pull request.\n. @c58 Thanks for your input and your work / thoughts.  I am actually the one in our team who currently works on the react bindings. You are right, that every time that the dom changes, react needs to be informed. We want our framework to be as agnostic as possible, so if we would implement everything in pure react component, people would not be able to just use pure javascript. You don't need to rewrite every component, but only write special component for those who change the dom, for example the navigator. So what we esentially want to do is write a component OnsNavigator for example that uses ons-navigator internally and ones the dom changes our component gets informed. You can take a look at my repo its still in an early stage, but here it is : https://github.com/philolo1/OnsenUI/tree/my_nav_2, and here is the OnsNavigator https://github.com/philolo1/OnsenUI/blob/my_nav_2/bindings/react/components/OnsNavigator.jsx, and examples: https://github.com/philolo1/OnsenUI/tree/my_nav_2/examples/react.\n. Thanks for your feedback. @argelius might also comment here, if he feels like it :). The component does not work the react way, but it does not really matter for the user, since he can use all the components he writes himself the react way! Concerning performance, react is basically calling render when the webcomponent is changing the dom, so we basically do the DOM manipulations twice, that is a slowdown but not significant in my opinion, unless you do a lot of dom manipulations. Ideally we will write some interface in the webcomponent that tell react to do those manipulation and let the web component do nothing at all, but that is even more tricky. Btw i have been following this article : https://github.com/ryanflorence/react-training/blob/gh-pages/lessons/05-wrapping-dom-libs.md. I think it will be quite unlikely that we can go your way of writing the core both in angular and react, but lets keep this discussion open and hear other opinions as well!\n. Closing this issue now, since we have now an extension that is working (with probably some bugs and some components missing): https://github.com/OnsenUI/react-onsenui\n. @c58 we also released a community, feel free to ask there : https://community.onsen.io/.\n. also looking at the rest of the documentation, does it require angular?\n. done in new documentation\n. @argelius I had issues with the navigator but the way it works now pretty well, the only thing is that its rendering twice, but with the benefit of using the actual functions. Please have a look at OnsNavigator in my code before you try to rewrite it yourself :) and take a look at the examples. Its definetly not an easy task :) \n. @anatoo i don't know how it looks in angular, but in react i set the  _compile='true' property and just create the dom as it would be done in the compile function. For example in onspage i do something like this\n<ons-page   {...this.props}  _compiled=\"true\" >\n        {toolbar}\n        <div className=\"page__background\"> </div>\n        <div className=\"page__content\">\n          {otherChildren}\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"page__extra\" style={{zIndex: 10001}}>\n          {modal}\n        </div>\n      </ons-page>;\n. @argelius let me know what you think about this approach.\n. @argelius should i also merge this into  nav_mod ?\n. yeah\n. yeah makes sense\n. @argelius I fixed the tests, should be fine now, question is whether we want to solve this activeIndex problem differently, namly because this activeIndex property will only work if the pages are not loaded. \n. @argelius there seems to be much more work than i expected here, so basically we need to get rid of NavigatorPage property and also fix insert/bringtotop etc. More than 40 navigator tests are not working. I will be focusing on fixing these issues, let me know if you also want to take a look and i will push what i have now.\n. @argelius just cancel this for now, will do a pull request ones it is finished.\n. will take a look thanks!\n2016-03-28 22:45 GMT+09:00 Andreas Argelius notifications@github.com:\n\n@philolo1 https://github.com/philolo1 It looks like this branch has\ndiverged from master and there are some conflicts. Can you see if you can\nmerge master into this tomorrow and solve the conflicts?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/1313#issuecomment-202399653\n. @argelius should be fixed.\n. probably you should do something like this:\n\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    CustomElements.upgrade(this.refs.side);\n    this.updateOpenState();\n  }\nIn the future we will have an ons-splitter element. We recently only started with the react support, have a look at this post: https://onsen.io/blog/react-onsen-ui-preview/. \n. @ryanfields thanks i will look at it and come back to you, appreciate your feedback and your bug report!\n. Try this $scope.myNavigator.topPage , \nI think we renamed it.\n. @argelius have you taken a look?\n. @argelius thanks for noticing, i fixed the test and updated the commit message!\n. A minimal example would be good to reproduce this issues. \n. Should animators depend on the object? I think it would make more sense to\nmake them more general and expose them in an ons object if its possible.\nOn Wednesday, 27 July 2016, Fran Dios notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nRight now creating a new animator is done like this\nhttps://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/kXJvQL?&editors=101 (in ES5). I think\nwe should also have a extend method to make this easier.\nFor the core API, perhaps we can move the element classes to ons object\ninstead of window:\n- ons.OnsNavigatorElement.registerAnimator\n- ons.OnsNavigatorElement.animators.iOSSlide\n- var customAnimator =\n  ons.OnsNavigatorElement.animators.iOSSlide.extend({ constructor: ..., push:\n  ..., pop: ...})\nFor ES6 imports:\n- import { OnsNavigatorElement } from 'onsenui';\n- OnsNavigatorElemet.animators.iOSslide\n- OnsNavigatorElemet.registerElement\nMaybe we can drop Ons prefix.\nThe common use case is to change 1 or maybe 2 animations, so I guess it's\nnot necessary to put all the animators togethers in only one object,\nalthough it's also a possibility.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are on a team that was mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/issues/1524#issuecomment-235542864,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AF_F5o5qCoyf8hYZX8Szi71GESrYp5Ziks5qZy0YgaJpZM4JV-Xn\n.\n. @frankdiox @argelius @IliaSky @anatoo opions are appreciated\n. @argelius i mean this code, maybe we can do it differently, because this is kind of hacky and won't work if you load pages. \n. \n",
    "bdedardel": "@frankdiox Thanks for the tip, it works fine !\n. If i log myNavigator, i obtain : \nconstructor Class()\n_boundOnPostpop _onPostpop()\n_boundOnPrepop _onPrepop()\n_clearDerivingEvents function()\n_clearDerivingMethods function()\n_compileAndLink _compileAndLink(pageElement, callback)\n_createPageScope _createPageScope()\n_destroy _destroy()\n_onPostpop _onPostpop(event)\n_onPrepop _onPrepop(event)\nbringPageTop function()\ncanPopPage function()\nemit function(event /*, args... */)\ninit init(scope, element, attrs)\ninsertPage function()\noff function(event, fct)\non function(event, fct)\nonce function(event, fct)\npopPage function()\npushPage function()\nreplacePage function()\nresetToPage function()\nI don't find topPage or currentPage\n. ... Yes, it works fine as property !\nMany thanks for your help.\n. Thanks, it works fine with 'data' property\nthis.myNavigator.pushPage('my-page.html', {data : 'test', animation: \"none\"})\n    .then(function(page) {\n        console.log(\"Parameter passed: \", page.data); \n});\nNote: for those who use typescript, don't forget to update (or modify) onsenui.d.ts\ninterface navigatorOptions {\n    animation?: string;\n    onTransitionEnd?: any;\n    animationOptions?: any;\n    data?: any;\n}\n. Thanks guys,\nMy mistake was : \n- to not embed   inside <ons-template id=\"splitter.html\">\n- to not set page attribute with navigator <ons-navigator page=\"splitter.html\">\nWithout your help, I wouldn't have found the solution with the current documentation, especially https://onsen.io/v2/docs/js/splitter.html page that doesnot speak about navigator.\nThanks again...\n. I confirm that it works fine with rc6.\nRegards,\nBenjamin\n. Hi @frankdiox \nI use rc6. To reproduce, just add in your example: \nmyNavigator.addEventListener('init', function(event) {\n        alert(myNavigator.topPage.name);\nI you popPage from page3.html to page2.html, it will show 'page3.html' instead of 'page2.html'.\ntopPage was, in the last versions currentPage. That's why I expect this behaviour.\nIt makes sense for me !\n. @IliaSky \nI think that it could not be considered as an expected behaviour, because \n- if your enter in page2 with a pushPage, topPage will be 'page2.html'\n- but if your enter in page2 with a popPage, topPage will be 'page3.html'\n  It is not logic!\nThanks for the other solution, I will study it. But as I use typescript + angular with controllers, I need this info inside my constructor. \n. For those who need to have the current page name in the constructor of controllers, before the init event, I use my own Navigator to pop/push pages :\nhtml\n<ons-template id=\"page1.html\">\n    <ons-page ng-controller=\"MyController1 as myCtl1\" id=\"mypage1\">     \n        ... \n    </ons-page>\n</ons-template>\ntypescript\n```\nmodule myModule {\n    'use strict';\nexport class MyNavigator {\n\n    public static onsNavigator: any = null;\n    public static isPopAction: boolean = false;\n\n    public static pushPage(page:string,param:any): void {\n        Navigator.isPopAction = false;\n        Navigator.onsNavigator.pushPage(page, {data : {selectedParam:param}, animation: \"none\"});   \n    }\n\n    public static popPage(refresh:boolean): void {\n        Navigator.isPopAction = true;\n        if (refresh) {\n            Navigator.onsNavigator.popPage({refresh:true});\n        } else {\n            Navigator.onsNavigator.popPage();\n        }   \n    }\n\n    public static getCurrentPage(): any {\n        if (Navigator.isPopAction) {\n            return Navigator.onsNavigator.pages[Navigator.onsNavigator.pages.length-2];\n        } else {\n            return Navigator.onsNavigator.topPage;\n        }\n    }       \n }\n\n}\n```\njavascript\ndocument.addEventListener(\"pageinit\", function(e) {\n  myModule.myNavigator.isPopAction = false; \n  ...\n}\n.

There we go, seems like just applying the input style did the trick. Awesome! Thanks!. @frandiox Hi and thanks for the feedback!\nI realise the controllers might be a bit confusing, but unfortunately i couldn't find a better way at the moment. I first tried adding functions in the classes, but i found it's not possible to keep references to the mithril's objects. Mithril didn't accept instantiated objects while keeping their properties, just classes, so this controller option seemed like the best alternative at the time of writing.\nThe page stack is not exactly read-only, but because of the same reason as above, i'm unable to keep references to the Navigator object, so i cannot easily access them if they are kept there. What i could do is keep all those properties and functions in the controller itself.\nAn alternative to remove entities out of the equation is to have a function on the \"controller\", returning it's own renderable component based on the controller's own data, which i think could work fairly well, and is quite mithril-like.\nI think integrating ons-navigator with mithril's router would work just fine.\nUsing rollup won't be a problem, webpack is just there because when i started i just copied the vue folder.\nI'd first like to get it to a stable enough state with more features before i become a member of the repo and contribute directly.

    "kenprice": "I found this Googling about my issue without much luck. I can confirm this bug. See my screenshot here\ngist of my view\nSee the gist of my view above. The commented out code is just a regular ng-repeat which works just fine. I replaced that line with a ons-list-item node with the ons-lazy-repeat directive. The list takes up the entire page. The first item in the list has position: absolute; top: 0px, and consequently starts right below the ons-toolbar. The list does not overflow on top of my ons-tabbar (not shown in the gist).\nI've tried changing the parent <ons-list> node to <ons-list style=\"position: relative; height: 100%\">, which appeared to work (list items no longer started at the top, but where I expected them) except the page ended up loading less items than my maximum. I'm assuming the addition of position: relative somehow affected the way ons-lazy-repeat computed how far down I've scrolled.\n. I replaced _getTopOffset for LazyRepeatView in onensui.js with this: \n_getTopOffset: function() {\n        var toolbar = document.getElementsByTagName('ons-toolbar');\n        var toolbarHeight = toolbar.length > 0 ? toolbar[0].clientHeight : 0;\n        return this._parentElement[0].getBoundingClientRect().top + toolbarHeight;\n      }\nThat seemed to do it for me.\n. @eidorianyeo Have you tried my fix?

The examples you have are Angular only, and the reference you have on how to use the components without Angular is for Onsen1.x.\nCan you supply me with an example of how to use ons-splitter without Angular?\nI need:\n1: HTML incl. setting the attributes (I use a system where I need well formed HTML, like:\n```\n\n\n  ...\n  \n\n...\n\n\n\n...\n\n```\n2: Javascript for handling opening/closing the splitter/menu, Javascript for handling change of page (with or without templates)\nWhat I have now is a page that looks alright, but I can't seem to get the splitter to react to anything I do. It's also closed by default.\nIn the browser console I can get the ons-splitter-side with this:\nvar side = document.getElementById(\"side\")\nWhen I call side.toggle() or side.open() nothing happens. The calls return false.\nI've also tried to point the content of ons-splitter-content to a template page with markup like this:\n<ons-splitter-content page=\"main.html\"></ons-splitter-content>\nThis renders the content area empty.\nIf you could add such an example here or to your repo, I'd highly appreciate it!\nThanks.\nBest,\nHenrik\nEDIT:\nI can get it to work if I put the ons-splitter, ons-splitter-side and ons-splitter-content elements in plain HTML, and then just generate the content with react. But not if I generate the full UI with react (which isn't really that important right now, but it should work I guess?)\n. Any update on an example using JavaScript only?\n. I still (2.0.0-rc4) can't .toggle/.close the ons-splitter-side when rendered with react.\nI've moved all the menu (ons-list with child ons-list-item's) to react though, and that works sort of OK, except for the issue mentioned in #1414.\n. This is not an issue anymore (2.0.0-rc4)\n. @frankdiox It's thrown during initialization of onsen, at least it seems like that.\nNo line in any JS file, so I guess you're right about the CSS.\n.

    "themikem": "Is it possible to get an optional style which will keep the non-indented look (a la Onsen1) as well?  For some app designs, leaving off the indent looks better, especially when using an inset list.  I can post screenshots if needed, but I'd like to have the option here without having to write a custom class or override the built-in style every time.\n. @frankdiox Indeed.  Thank you! That does solve it.\nI will say that it would be nice to set up a simple list with just UL and LI tags.  As it stands, even with this style, I have to include a DIV on each element to get the left indent on the items.  For simple cases (say a tappable list of 3-5 text items with chevrons, for example), this seems like a bit of overkill.  It'd be nice to have the base indent in the list__item padding and then work the left/center/right styles off of that.  Just a thought.\n. The code in your pen is generating the div's.  If you view the compiled code:\n```\n\nItems without divs\n\nIchi\n\n\nNi\n\n\nSan\n\n\nYon\n\n\nGo\n\n\n```\nHowever, if I just make a simple list using ul/li tags, I find that the text in the list items is flush against the left side of the list:\nhttp://codepen.io/themikem/pen/XdMmxP/\nThe behavior I expect is this:\nhttp://codepen.io/themikem/pen/oxZjar/\n(notice that the HTML code is a direct cut & paste from the prior pen - I just swapped the script/stylesheet tags)\nSpecifically, notice that the list item content is indented with a 10px margin on the left side.\nAlso, while I was building those pens, I noticed that if I do an inset list without a header, I get a double-border at the top due to the shadow from the .list__item:first-child style.  Just an FYI, looks a bit odd:\nhttp://codepen.io/themikem/pen/BKWovQ\nSo maybe I'm expecting a bit much in terms of backwards compatibility, but I was expecting the old ul/li code to appear the same with onsen2.  I don't mind the longborder mod, and I think the left/center/right structure is a superior approach to onsen1.  It is also more consistent with the toolbar pattern, which is a good thing in this library.  I'd just like the simple case to work without having to think about the more advanced structure.\n. Just to complete the thought, my suggestions for a potential fix: http://codepen.io/themikem/pen/xVqwoe\n- indentation is backwards compatible\n- header vertical spacing also backwards compatible\n- extended left/center concept to the header (for example, if you wanted to put icons in header rows for a settings page with category headers)\n. Okay, sounds good.  Thanks for looking at this.  Let me know if you'd like a patch or pull request for the fixes. (happy to do it if it would help)\n. @argelius \nOn the header: you're point is well taken.  That's what I'm trying to achieve.  There are two \"headers\" in iOS natively: the header at the top of the list, and a category divider between list items.\nFor example, look at the image below from the Settings app (region settings):\n\nSo my point with the example is that if you include the header between items, the height offset needs to be reduced to match the native behavior.  That was the point of my pen example.\nInset lists & border:\nRather than including the inset tag on each element, since the first is the only offending element anyway, could this be made as an inherited style from list--inset?  Something like:\n.list--inset .list--inset__item {\n-webkit-box-shadow: none;\nbox-shadow: none;\n}\nSeem easier than having to put that style on all the elements, or putting it just on the first.  Also, the tag insets the list as a whole.  It would be preferable not to have the items need to know whether or not they are inset.\nThanks again.\n. @argelius Yes, the inset__item tag really is overkill, and if you look at the pen I posted, it can easily be solved using either a first-child or just style id combo.\nOn the headers, there again we have a departure from the expected behavior with Onsen 1 vs Onsen 2.  Notice that with Onsen 1, the header element behaves in the same manner as the native OS screenshot I posted.  It is a shorter-than-item \"divider\" of sorts that could be used to break up groups in a list view, for example:\nhttp://codepen.io/themikem/pen/BKZPwE\nTo your point, the header in Onsen2 is more appropriate/better matches the native look when two list blocks appear one after another.  Using the same HTML from the Onsen1 example here: http://codepen.io/themikem/pen/WwpQqZ\nHowever, using the header within the list here does not match the native look at all.  That was my point with my earlier post.  \nPerhaps this is a candidate for two separate styles?  A \"header\" style for the top of the list, and a \"divider\" style that matches Onsen1 for between elements.  It could also be implemented with modifiers similar to my other suggestion.  Or, could still be done using a single style, but with a secondary modifier for a list title.  One thought: http://codepen.io/themikem/pen/xVqwoe\nAt any rate, there is an issue here, but I think it is slightly more complicated to resolve.\n. ",

    "sukima": "\nAnd what was worse, Angular2 set all attributes after an element is attached.\n\nJust spent a week vacation writing an Ember.js addon addon and ran into this very issue with <ons-input>.\nThe problem I ran into was that some attributes (content-left and type) are attributes that change how the init()/_compile() methods behave. This is all well and good in HTML where the syntax is <ons-input type=\"text\" content-leff></ons-input> but completely defeated in cases when the element is created dynamically.\njs\nvar inputEl = document.createElement('ons-input');\ninputEl.setAttribute('content-left', true); // Ignored; _compile already executed.\ninputEl.setAttribute('type', 'text'); // Fails! type is defined as a getter only no setter\n// If there was a setter it would not matter as it would also be ignored because\n// _compile already executed.\nAs far I can tell the above is the correct way to manage web-components in JavaScript. The DOM API does not have a way to initialize web-components but to only mutate their attributes after the fact.\nI suggest the initialization logic (building child DOM nodes and appending them) be moved from the constructor to the connectedCallback as described:\n\nCalled every time the element is inserted into the DOM. Useful for running setup code, such as fetching resources or rendering. Generally, you should try to delay work until this time.\n\n(emphasis mine)\nUnless I'm missing something stupid\u2026 \ud83d\ude4f . @frankdiox Thanks. Got it working. The trick was to make sure I set the type attribute after it was created and before it got rendered. Thanks to Ember providing good component life hooks I was able to pull this off (willInsertElement vs. didInsertElement). Phew!. @frankdiox Sorry I just dived into this further. This is not working Why? setImediate delays the constructor for one call execution which means it happens prior to setAttribute. Sorry but most people working with web components will have a difficult time inserting a hook between the constructor and the setImediate. (https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/core/src/ons/content-ready.js#L59-L62)\nThe contentReady makes assumptions that just are not there in frameworks. In fact I believe it is depended on how browsers implement HTML parsing and not how the DOM API was intended to be used.\nMoving the DOM manipulation logic to connectedCallback I think will fix the issue. An alternative would be to avoid the setImediate and instead have the connectedCallback functions flush the contentReady queue. Then we know the content is really ready.. At this time I stopped trying to port this to Ember. If I continue the only solution I found was to completely reinvent the entire ons-input behavior in Ember and only use the CSS.\nMany rendering engine assume normal DOM elements where one can dynamically set attributes. Some components in OnsenUI (i.e. ons-input) will not account for dynamic attributes. Which means that these elements are only useful in plain HTML and not when created from a rendering engine like Angular2, glimmer, react, etc.. ",

After a model is updated, patching the DOM by Elm results in TypeError: domNode is undefined JS error.\nYou can see relevant Elm code here.. Unfortunately shadow DOM still seems not to be widely supported: https://caniuse.com/#search=shadow%20dom. ",

Its very simple, i have a list of files (css's, js's) that i need in my project, when I compile to a prod environment I have gulp compress all of my css files into one file.\nIf somewhere in that file there is an import statement that runs in run time, it will fail beacuse the content does not exist in a seperate file, but in the same file.\nI dont understand why this is so weird to you, its a standard thing to do in a prod environment. \nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-concat\nIf a library like this one does not expose its requirements a head of time but instead tries to load them in run time, there is nothing I or anyone can do without changing their code.\n. Imports are normal for devs and the gulp-concat-css are for DEVS, not for a final product, a framework should come packed and finished and should not work diferently on different environments,  if the guide says all you need to do for the framework to run is to include files A and B then thats all you need to do.\nFor example take both bootstrap and material, you can bet they have loads of @imports in their code. \nBut none in the final css file they publish and for that exact reason.\nIn the docs they specify, if you need feature X include bootstrap_x.css file\nThey do not include files beacuse they cannot know in advance the project structure of the user, they as a framework need to give a closed black box for the end user.\nI will change my code to use concat css, but I do believe this is a framework issue that should be fixed.\n. Thanks for the answer, I'l try and upgrade today and update here when done.\n. @frankdiox \nWell then this should be updated in the docs as well as it got me confused :\nhttps://onsen.io/v2/docs/angular2/navigation.html\n. Hi, did a bit of digging, apperantly this happens only when I use chrome debug on IOS mode, I looked up in your code and I found this section:\n// Issue #160: on iOS 7, some input elements (e.g. date datetime month) throw a vague TypeError on setSelectionRange. These elements don't have an integer value for the selectionStart and selectionEnd properties, but unfortunately that can't be used for detection because accessing the properties also throws a TypeError. Just check the type instead. Filed as Apple bug #15122724.\n        if (deviceIsIOS && targetElement.setSelectionRange && targetElement.type.indexOf('date') !== 0 && targetElement.type !== 'time' && targetElement.type !== 'month') {\n            length = targetElement.value.length;\n            targetElement.setSelectionRange(length, length);\n        } else {\n            targetElement.focus();\n        }\n    };\nThis explains it, not sure what the correct behavior should be tough.\nAlso from MDN:\nNote that accordingly to the WHATWG forms spec selectionStart, selectionEnd properties and setSelectionRange method apply only to inputs of types text, search, URL, tel and password. Chrome, starting from version 33, throws an exception while accessing those properties and method on the rest of input types.\n. ",

    "rgins16": "Apologies. \n. Alrighty. Hope I helped :)\n. I have come up with a temporary fix for Bug 1\nIt is a hack, and not a viable long term solution, at least in my opinion. \nsteps for tmp fix:\n1. set id of the tab bar in the jade file\n2. set all three tabs as 'active' (this loads all tabs initially and will land on the last tab (tab 3))\n3. in the callback of the navigator I have written this code:\ndocument.getElementById('idoftabbar').setActiveTab(0);\nSo I guess by setting all tabs as active, the javascript/angular gets loaded for each tab.\nThen the one liner I wrote above navigates back to the first tab, which is the tab I want to be active when the tabbar loads\n. Has anyone been able to look into this issue yet?\n. @frandiox I don't understand why refresh for popPage was removed. In my case, the user is on a page. They click the sign in button which pushes the sign in page. After signing in, the sign page is popped. Then I would like for the original page to be refreshed..

I had previously decided to stick with v2.0.4 while waiting to hear from someone about this, but had previously tinkered with \nmyNavigator.once('postpush', function(){\n    $scope.event = myNavigator.topPage.data.event;\n});\nMy problem with this was the event scope variable didn't reflect it's changes in the DOM.\nWhen you say \"the correct way to do this in v2\", are you saying it's better practice to use the ons-init handler in the DOM instead of adding an event listener in Angular/JavaScript?. @frandiox Thanks for the help.. @frandiox was I too vague in the explanation of my problem? . @frandiox I apologize, but I'm confused by your statement. I encountered the error in my own project. Are you saying that in the future you want me to copy/paste my code from my project to the tutorial, and then hit 'Report an issue'?. @frandiox Got it. I will do that from now on. :). @frandiox Thanks! I finally got around to implementing this. You pen was very helpful.. @frandiox  Ah, that's embarrassing. Sorry (>_<). @misterjunio Forgive me if what I'm saying doesn't make sense. I'm still learning as I go, maybe I said what I meant incorrectly. What I meant was that DOM elements weren't removed from the page after navigating to the same page I was currently on. I did a JavaScript check to see if elements were already existing. They did not exist the first time I navigated to a page. Then they already existed if I navigated to the same page I was currently on (they were not 'destroyed'). If I navigated to a different page, then back to the first one, then the elements did not exist again - they were 'destroyed'. I apologize if I am conveying this incorrectly.. @misterjunio I suppose the problem is on my end. After manually applying the fix, I'm still having the same issue. I have a jQuery datepicker. It loads correctly the first time I navigate to a page. If I navigate to the same page, then the datepicker does not load correctly. If I navigate to a different page, then navigate back to the first one, it loads correctly. I had assumed this was because the datepicker element was not being 'destroyed' when I navigated to the same page. However, after applying the fix in your commit, it still is not working.. @misterjunio I think I may have figured out the problem; what the real bug is. I can't provide code because you have not released the version with your fix to the 'destroy' event not being fired, but I manually updated my local version according to your commit. So when I navigate to the same page, the 'init' event fires before the 'destroy' event. The page is being initialized again before the old instance is being destroyed. I believe this is a bug.. @frandiox Have you had a chance to look at this yet?. @frandiox ahhhhhh. Thank you for clarifying!. @anatoo @asial-matagawa I am having the problem described in #1864. I am running 10.3.2 on my iPhone 5C. Since noticing this a while ago, I've always felt the lack of the arrow would confuse the user.. @asial-matagawa YAY! Thanks team!. @asial-matagawa I just updated my post. I actually don't have to touch three times, just once. I have to touch exactly in the right spot or it won't work. Should I still try ons.fastClick.destroy(); and add another library such as Hammer.js?. ok, thanks.. @asial-matagawa Not a problem at all. I like helping you guys out.\nSo I was never able to replicate the issue in the tutorial. It works fine on the link you sent me. I only have this issue on my web app. I could give you the URL, but I'd rather send it to you in a personal message or email.. @asial-matagawa Also, there is a new development in this issue. If I include text in the ons-checkbox element, then clicking that text checks and unchecks the checkbox. I still can not click the actual checkbox itself. . @frandiox That worked. Thanks!. @frandiox I am not using any custom style applied to those pages. I don't know if it matters, but each page in the tabbar is an angular component. So each page in the tabbar points to the template which is in index.html, and each template only holds the component.. @frandiox I can confirm the issue does not occur after updating to v2.4.2. Thank you! Also, I want to make sure you remember: I only experience this issue on mobile.. @frandiox Now that I think about it, animations must be the issue. The credit card information form does an animation when it first appears on the screen.. Hey @frandiox. So what exactly was the problem. I'm new to Vue and Webpack, so please forgive me.. ",

    "nodefish": "I'm experiencing something similar: push a page which contains an html5 <video> tag. Once the video request is completed (initial load), I have a carousel on another page which fires postchange. However, I can't recreate this on CodePen for some reason; it's probably related to the particular layout of my app (several tabs with nested elements).\nThe event seems to originate from _onResize, but I can't seem to work around it. I tried carousel._boundOnResize = function() {} but the function seems to be defined elsewhere (Probably in the window scope, but I don't want to disable it globally...)\n@puku0x: can you check if your issue involving the software keyboard and the carousel goes through _onResize?\nI'm not sure how to solve this at the moment.\nedit: debugging info: the event is originating from a <video> which is not in the carousel, yet it's calling _onResize for the carousel, and subsequently setActiveIndex and the postchange listener:\n\nedit2: Workaround for now is to put the offending element in an iframe. Doubt this will fix OP's issue with input and the software keyboard, though.. It's still happening for me FYI. Basically I have a carousel inside 1 <ons-tab>, and in another <ons-tab> I've got a dynamic html5 <video>. When the video loads, the carousel in the other tab fires postchange.. Thanks for finding this, I've had a similar issue with init firing many times but I didn't manage to isolate it, and assumed it was a coding error from my side. This fix will be a big deal for my app. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Awesome! Which build has this fix?\n. Thanks to you and asial-matagawa \ud83d\udc4d \n. edit: I've now tried it with <input> instead of <ons-input> and I still have the issue, so I guess this isn't an Onsen UI bug. My bad!\nI've got the same issue as well on iOS with Onsen UI + Cordova and using riot.js for data binding the value attribute.\nUpdating the value attribute programmatically doesn't update the display. For example, if the initial value is empty, and later it's set to '1990-01-01', the date displayed remains empty. If we explore the DOM, we see that the value attribute was indeed updated.\nWhen the user taps on the date input after it has been updated (even though it's displaying stale data), the iOS native date picker is set to the correct (updated) date.. > You can try rendering the toolbar with the .page__background and .page__content instead of letting Onsen do it. Onsen will only create those elements if they don't already exist.\nThis solution works, combined with making riot push the tag contents directly into the ons-page and thus excluding the wrapper. I have to admit I kind of liked the hoisting (reminds me a bit of how React Native treats statusbars nested at depth>0), but this works just fine. :)\nIs it safe in the long run to generate div.page__background and div.page__content or can I expect this to break at some point?\n. @argelius Understood. Based on the answer @frankdiox, this seems like it may be an intentional design decision.\n. @frankdiox \n- for ons-page: in theory, what I'm saying is the event name could still be init but the listener would be definable on the ons-page itself - key word being definable. And then if you want to centralize all pages' init events on the navigator which I agree is a good practice, then you would define the handler on navigator and the events would bubble up from ons-page. However, I don't have a problem personally with ons-page being like this. It's more of a \"devil's advocate\" question involving events overall.\n- I'm not 100% sure if a code change or a documentation change is what I want to suggest. I just recall being a bit confused when I had more than 1 ons-tabbar in my app (nested), and I wanted an event handler for only the outer one. It wasn't a huge problem to fix it (just use event.target.id in a switch statement), but it seemed to work a bit differently than I expected.\nWhat's unclear to me is if I write my_tabbar.addEventListener('prechange', function(){...}), then this event also fires for any other ons-tabbar in my project that is nested under the first tabbar (i.e. inside one of the tabbar's pages), even if I didn't assign a listener to the nested ons-tabbar. So it behaves exactly the same as if I wrote document.addEventListener('prechange', function(){...}). That's what's confusing to me, I thought I could set a listener on the outer ons-tabbar only.\nAs far as I know, bubbling should only happen if both the nested element and its parent have handlers registered for that event, and yet I only assigned a handler in one of them (outermost one in my case). I guess now, thinking about this, that even if I didn't specify a handler in both elements, Onsen UI probably adds handlers to all ons- elements behind the scenes, and these events bubble.\nIn that case, I'm not sure if anything needs to be done.\nSome additional thoughts:\nWhat if you have different kinds of elements which use the same event names? For example, if we have an ons-carousel nested inside an ons-tabbar page: both of them have a postchange event, so if the ons-carousel fires postchange by default and it bubbles up (just like my previous example's inner tabbar, for which I did not define a handler, fires and bubbles up prechange) , would that fire the tabbar postchange event? That seems a bit messy.\n. It's been a while since this post and I've since come to realize that what confused me was the simple fact that one usually would explicitly specify when events fire (e.g. onclick='whatever'), whereas Onsen UI elements would implicitly fire events. This is normal since Onsen UI is a library of premade components, but somehow it eluded me that things would emit events without me specifying them (temporary brain fail :)). That and the event names being the same for different components threw me off a bit.\nBut your explanation makes perfect sense and I think you're right, there's no issue here. The lack of event namespacing is a limitation of js, not Onsen UI (unless you want to rename same-name events to like carousel-postchange, but that's entirely up to you and Onsen UI is correct either way).\nThanks for your well thought out reply. I'll close this issue.. I've experienced something like this too. Not sure if it's quite the same thing but it seems similar. Currently I've managed to alleviate it by doing document.body.appendChild(popoverElement); before calling show().. I see. I checked out some native iOS apps and their animation isn't like that, so I figured it was a bug.\nI'll look into custom animations. Thanks for the tip!.

Due to it being unable to resolve the pages DI (since no provider was specified in the page-class).\nThis resulted in the app.load() function to try to load a page which it wasn't capable of.\nHowever, the function did not throw any error in this case, which might be a improvement that could be included in the upcoming Angular4 + Onsen-UI release.\nIn short:\nif a page used a constructor like this:\nexport class myPage\n{\n   constructor(@Inject(forwardRef(() => MyApp)) private app : MyApp, private otherClass: OtherClass) {}\n}\nwithout specifying a provider like so:\n@Component({\n    selector: 'ons-page[somePage]',\n    template: require('../../html/somePage.html'),\n    styles: [require('../../css/somePage.css')],\n    providers: [OtherClass],\n})\nIt would throw no errors when trying to load this page, while the page isn't loaded.\nThen when a you navigate (by a working link) to another page, it results in emptyness where the {{variables}} are located.

That was huge!\nI think making the Modal component share the same API that BaseDialog makes the API more consistent with the rest of dialog components.\nMay be in the 1.7.0 version can use React 16 and replace ReactDOM.unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer with ReactDOM.createPortal.\nUpgrade should be at no cost as it's said in the docs:\n\nWith minor exceptions, if your app runs in 15.6 without any warnings, it should work in 16.. @frandiox I don't know if I have misunderstood the problem. I've tried some different scenarios here https://codepen.io/airamrguez/pen/Nagwdb?editors=1010\n\nI think the animations are being completed before the parent components are unmounted. Otherwise, can you share some use case on a CodePen?. @asial-matagawa cool!. @frandiox Hi! I have a wrapper around the Navigator component. So instead of calling methods like pop and push directly in the Navigator, I call them from my wrapper component. On my wrapper component I only need to add:\nswipePop = (...args) => {\n    this.popPage(...args);\n  };\nThe onPostPop is fired after the route was popped. I need a hook before the pop method is called.. @frandiox I'm going to be very busy this week. I'll try to take a look at it asap. Sorry for the inconvenience. @frandiox I have a wrapper around the Navigator component to achieve 3 things:\n\nAvoid getting the UI unsuful on some Android devices because hitting the back button many times very fast give us the error\n\n\nNavigator is already running animation.\n\n\nKeep track of the active route. Our app has a side menu and we want to highlight the current section.\nKeep track of the navigation depth. I use this in many ways. For example to generate keys for React components, because the same view can be pushed into the navigation stack many times from different parts of our app.\n\nFor example, the popPage method is overloaded like this:\n```js\n  popPage(...args) {\n    if (RoutingNavigator.depth <= 0) {\n      return Promise.resolve();\n    }\n    if (this.nav.isRunning()) {\n      // Router in the middle of a transition. Defferring it ...\n      const defer = loadingDefers.get(RoutingNavigator.depth);\n      if (defer !== undefined) {\n        return defer.then(() => {\n          this.popPage(...args);\n        });\n      }\n      return Promise.reject('Navigator is already running animation.');\n    }\n    RoutingNavigator.depth--;\n    const deferKey = RoutingNavigator.depth;\n    const lastHistoryIndex = Math.max(0, this.history.length - 2);\n    const previousRoute = this.history[lastHistoryIndex];\n    this.eventEmitter.emit('routechange', previousRoute);\nconst unloadDefer = this.nav.popPage(...args).then(() => {\n  this.history.pop();\n  loadingDefers.delete(deferKey);\n});\n\nreturn unloadDefer;\n\n}\n```\nWhy do I need a swipePop method? Because swipePop should do at least tasks 2 and 3. It can be implemented like this:\njs\n  swipePop = (...args) => {\n    this.popPage(...args);\n  };\n. I've updated all the dependencies from the Demo now that React has been officially released. The error is still there.. @frandiox Cool!!!. @frandiox the line deleted in fact was really useful. We've come back to the initial approximation which I think is wrong. The last time it was changed was in this pull request. \nSo the problem is basically that you have a parent component over the navigator component and a child component inside the navigator (rendered from the renderPage prop). If the child updates a parent's prop, then the inner components are not re-rendered and so they are not being updated.\nNow my code is broken\ud83d\ude14\n. @frandiox After merging this revert now it's flickering on my app. Versions greater than 2.9 flickers. Versions lower than 2.8.3 doesn't \ud83d\ude43. @frandiox the flickering occurs right after a page is pushed (when the page slide animation is completed). I revert this revert (apply the original code) and it works fine in 2.9.1 release.. @asialgearoid sorry, I forgot to do some updates. Now the example it's updated.\nhttps://codepen.io/airamrguez/pen/bMEgEP\nInspect both icons with the DOM inspector. You'll see that none of them have the size prop as an attribute.\n. @asialgearoid It works in versions of React <= 16.2 but it stopped working since React >= 16.3.\nI think that in React >= 16.3 the size prop only allows Number types. OnsenUI Icon web component transforms every value of size into a string and thus it is not attached to the DOM because it is an invalid type. I think it could be a React issue because the size type validation should only applied to input and select elements.\nI've submitted and issue in React's repo.\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12694\n.

Sorry @frandiox but i continue to have other problems. If i treat as a <template> i have several issues  with the <ons-tabbar> \nIn the index.html i declare this:\n<body ng-app=\"myApp\" >\n    <ons-tabbar>\n        <ons-tab label=\"Tab 1\" page=\"login.html\" active>\n        </ons-tab>\n      <ons-tab label=\"Tab 2\" page=\"page.html\">\n        </ons-tab>\n    </ons-tabbar>\n</body>\nWhen i try to call the  <template> in another page: in this case  login.html  with his own navigator like in this example:\n<ons-navigator var=\"menuNavLogin\" page=\"login.html\"></ons-navigator>\n    <template id=\"login.html\">\n        <ons-page ng-controller=\"loginController\">\n            .....\n        </ons-page>\n     </template>\nDoesn't show the bottom tabbar.\nWhere have I to collocate the <ons-navigator>? Naturally if i remove <ons-tabbar> all works perfectly. \n. Yes i check it. I red all of yout tutorial (GREAT WORK). This issue is new with onsen 2.4.0. \nI want to reload a page after an ajax call, the <tabbar> must be the same for the entire app\nin the <tabbar> i have some pages called in the <tab> that have own specified navigator. \nI initialize the  navigator in the page that the <tab> calls. \nindex.html:\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       .....\n   \n\n```\nI have several issues if i use this structure.\n## A workaround that now fix the bug is this:\nindex.html:\n<body ng-app=\"myApp\" >\n    <ons-tabbar>\n        <ons-tab label=\"Tab 1\" page=\"login.html\" active>\n        </ons-tab>\n    </ons-tabbar>\n</body>\nThen i create a login.html page that is structured in this way:\n<ons-page>\n    <ons-navigator var=\"menuNavLogin\" page=\"no_login.html\">\n    </ons-navigator>\n    <template id=\"no_login.html\">\n       <ons-page ng-controller=\"loginController\">\n           .......\n        </ons-page>\n    </template>\n</ons-page>\nIn the controller i recall:\nmenuNavLogin.replacePage('login.html');\nIn this way works, but I don't know if is the correct one.\nMy goal is to update the same login.html so if the call ajax goes fine, the page will display the data captured from the call.\n. Yes, I tried all the day :D, and at least it seems works ONLY with my \"workaround\". \nThe only think that sounds weird is the call of two <ons-page>\nHowever thanks for the time @frandiox, Excellent work.. @misterjunio The example is clear, but if have another<navigator> in settings.html in your example there is another issue, because if i want to reload another page recalling the <template> , onsen goes to the active page (in this case home.html and not in settings.html).

I think the Splitter should only react when dragging on non-interactive elements, like plain text etc.\nAgain, thanks for the quick fix! I'll have another look at my local code. Maybe I'll test with slot=\"pages\" instead of :tabs=[...] and see what happens.. Looks like restarting the dev server wasn't enough \u2014 but after rebooting the machine everything's fine.

    "zabojad": "@asial-matagawa OK thanks. Why doesn't the package.json contain all necessary dependencies so that we can run npm run build right after a npm install? Wouldn't it be the easiest way to test contributions before PR them?. @asial-matagawa I don't understand. Yarn uses the package.json anyway and this files lacks about a dozen dependencies to make the gulp build command succeed... What does Yarn bring here that npm would not?. @asial-matagawa Sorry to insist but these are the libs I had to install to get a successful build:\n\"ancss\": \"^0.1.5\",\n    \"eco\": \"^1.1.0-rc-3\",\n    \"gulp-plumber\": \"^1.1.0\",\n    \"gulp-postcss\": \"^7.0.0\",\n    \"gulp-stylelint\": \"^3.9.0\",\n    \"postcss-base64\": \"^0.7.1\",\n    \"postcss-cssnext\": \"^3.0.2\",\n    \"postcss-import\": \"^11.0.0\",\n    \"postcss-reporter\": \"^5.0.0\"\nAnd I see none of them in the yarn.lock file.... @asial-matagawa OK, thanks for the explanations. I close the issue as you have corrected the documentation. Thanks!. @asial-matagawa Can this be merged? It's a rather trivial PR.... PS: by the way, I've asked about this yesterday there: https://community.onsen.io/topic/1833/button-in-tappable-listitem-issue. @frandiox any thought on this one? :stuck_out_tongue:. @frandiox I like your proposition. I think that your point/step 2 alone would be enough actually, don't you think ? Checking only parent.hasAttribute('prevent-tap') would also save on perfs.... @frandiox OK then should I modify my PR to implement those 3 steps as described? Will that be OK to be merged then?. @frandiox done! Can you check and merge if it's OK?. @frandiox oups, sorry for the mistake... And thanks for merging !. Oups, let me PR once again, there are commits from another branch in it.... @frandiox this is to address https://community.onsen.io/topic/1820/ons-navigator-and-slide-animation-from-right-to-left/4 and in general add a feature common to most projects.. @frandiox Thank you for your review! I've created a new PR implementing your suggestions: https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/pull/2284.\nBy the way, who is the developper in charge of the react binding at onsen? I've some questions/suggestions regarding their implementation.. BTW, I guess this PR can be closed now.... @frandiox can this be merged or is there anything wrong?. Hey @frandiox ! On which commit have you made a comment ? I do not see it... Is it on \na62f9f9 or a3cbc5a ?. @frandiox it is one of the reasons I did ask you recently who is in charge of the React bindings in your team. Some of the OnSenUI React components sources I've crossed are strange (if not wrong) with things like calls to forceUpdate() which is not recommended (setState() should be used instead) or with variables that do not seem to be used at all. Here, in the Navigator component, the this.pages variable is anyway useless/never read because the render() method will anyway regenerate the pages from the routes variable.\nSo I kept this this.pages = routes.map(renderPage) in resetPageStack() as it is done in the other methods as well but it is actually never used.\nI think the React bindings might need some refactoring / rewriting to match both React programming good practices as well as OnSenUI components implementation...\nFor now, I can put back down this line which should not have gone up. We can discuss the general implementation of the react bindings in another thread... What do you think?\n. @frandiox well the good thing here is that it can be done component by component so it's completely do-able...\nI'll open new PR-s soon.. @frandiox yes, there could be some kind of elementRef or domInputRef property to get the inner input ref.\n@LucNaterop But if this is just to get the value of uncontrolled inputs, you can do like this:\n give a name attribute to each of your form element,\n wrap them in a <form> HTML element,\n* get the values of your inputs with a a FormData like this (below is Haxe js syntax but it almost the same as js except it is typed):\n```\n      // ...\n  function getFormData() : LoginFormShape {\n\n    var fd : js.html.FormData = new js.html.FormData(_form); // _form being the ref of your form element\n\n    var ret : LoginFormShape =\n\n        {\n            login: fd.get(\"login\"),\n            password: fd.get(\"password\")\n        };\n\n    return ret;\n}\n\n   // ...\n\n``\n  . @frandiox yes you are right. I'm however facing the following issue. What needs to be done more than passingdefaultValuetoons.InputanddefaultCheckedtoons.Checkboxandons.Radioto make them reach the nativeinput` element? I cannot figure it out... Do you have any clue on this one? \nI'll commit what I've done so far so that you see what I'm talking about.... @frandiox pushed. Can you have a look?. just edited my previous message.... @frandiox the problem is that it seems I need to propagate the defaultValue attribute into the core ons-input or ons-radio/ons-checkbox component... How to do that properly?. @frandiox a little hint would be very appreciated here...\nHere is what I've managed to do: I've passed defaultValue to the ons-checkbox component. There I've add this:\n```\nexport default class BaseCheckboxElement extends BaseInputElement {\n// ...\n  _compile() {\n    super._compile();\nthis._setDefaultChecked();\n\n}\n_setDefaultChecked() {\n    if (this.hasAttribute('defaultChecked')) {\n      this._input.defaultChecked = this.getAttribute('defaultChecked');\n    }\n  }\n// ...\n```\nIt's odd because the input gets checked by default but its \"style\" is still unchecked...\nHere is what I have at runtime:\n\nAny idea why its style is still looking like it's unchecked?\n. @frandiox I'm not sure but I think it doesn't make sense to set a defaultValue attribute on ons-... internal native input as anyway defaultValue and defaultChecked are managed only by react in a react context and what happens inside the ons web component is out of reach for react...\nI thus think that the right solution will be to set once node.value = this.props.defautValue; and node.checked = this.props.defautChecked; in the componentDidMount() method of the BaseInput react binding... At least, it does not \"pollute\" the core components with react specific things...\nI'll issue another commit doing this.... hey @frandiox! Oups, yes I'm gonna clean that. Things were getting a bit messy while debugging.. @frandiox done! Can it be merged already :)?. OK I have my answers.\nOnsenUI is using fa v4.7.0 and we should browse icons there: https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icon/user-o/\nIt should be written in the docs imho. Or updated to latest FA version.. @asialgearoid thanks for answering.\nWell, I'm not sure it is such an edge case.\nI'm having this situation because I have the following imbrication of ons components:\n<ons.Page renderToolbar={renderToolbar}>\n  <ons.Splitter>\n      <ons.SplitterSide>\n        // some side menu content\n      </ons.SplitterSide>\n      <ons.SplitterContent>\n        <ons.Navigator>\n          // .. navigator content (ons.Page components basically)\n        </ons.Navigator>\n      </ons.SplitterContent>\n  </ons.Splitter>\n</ons.Page>\nYou see the renderToolbar in the root Page component. There I have a ons.BackButton. And this has to control the inner Navigator. I have this structure because the header cannot \"change\" when the inner navigator stack changes...\nI'm not sure it is such an edge case ?. @asialgearoid OK, I'll PR that in the coming days.... My mistake, the issue came from my app code.. @asialgearoid if I run npm install it's the same right?\nThe onsenui npm package references \"@onsenui/fastclick\": \"1.1.1\", as a dependency by there is no fastclick in the onsenui folder so how can this work?\n. npm install in my onsenui local repo solved the issue. Thanks @asialgearoid !. @Warlone I'm experiencing the same issue. Did you solve it?. ",

Thanks for the PR!. @SebasG22 We are hoping to release reactive forms support with the next version of Onsen UI around the end of this month.\nAs for the development version, I got it working by running npm link from the unzipped Onsen directory, then npm link onsenui from my project directory. Hope this helps.. @pm2002 Thanks for the contribution!. I tried to replicate this but it works fine for me, so I'm not sure this is a problem with Onsen.\nIf you are still having problems, you can make post at the Onsen UI forum with a code sample that reproduces the problem, or if you think it's a cordova problem try at the cordova slack.. Thanks for pointing that out. Theme Roller has now been updated.. I can confirm that angular-onsenui.min.js is indeed empty in 2.10.2.\nThanks for the issue - that's a great spot.\nNot sure why this happened yet. I'll look into it further.. I think moving the AngularJS bindings to their own package is definitely something we should do. Besides historical reasons, there's not much sense now in giving AngularJS special treatment compared to the other supported frameworks.\nJust to confirm, you are thinking we should essentially put the AngularJS bindings in LTS mode to coincide with the AngularJS project going into LTS? Meaning any new features wouldn't be supported in the AngularJS bindings. I'm slightly concerned that anyone using the AngularJS bindings will still expect the new features since AngularJS is technically still supported by Angular.\nWould there be any way to move the AngularJS bindings to their own package without breaking existing applications? (Although if it's a minor release then breaking changes should be fine.)\nWe should probably put an npm warning in the new package to let the users know AngularJS bindings are getting phased out.. Tasks involved\n\ncreate new npm package\nremove 'angular-bindings' from buildTasks in gulpfile.babel.js\nremove angular from rollup.config.js\nremove angular as dev dependency in package.json\nadd package.json and other config files to bindings/angular1\nupdate AngularJS installation instructions in onsen.io Guide\nupdate release instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md\nupdate playground dependency\nannounce in discord and forum\nremove angular keyword from package.json and bower.json ???\n\nThis list is a WIP so please update if anything is wrong/missing!. This is done in a039a466da27a2fa7fe78224ea31780e4996d017.\nIt will appear on the website once we release OnsenUI and then do another release of onsen.io.\nI'll keep this issue open until then..

['--gulpfile', path.join('bindings', 'angular1', 'gulpfile.js', 'build')]);\nMy gulp version is 3.9.1 and node version is 8.11.3.. I confirmed that this bug is reproducible from the playground.\nIf no one else has picked this ticket up, I'll take a look once I've finished the bugs I'm currently working on.. It's working for me. How are you checking it? The fix is in master but not released yet, so it won't show up in the playground.. Just to confirm, you are expecting that:\n\nwhen you first run the app, the value displayed by thev-ons-select should be the same as selectedValueOnsen\nwhen you click the 'Change values' button, the value displayed by the v-ons-select should also be the same as selectedValueOnsen\n\nIs that correct?\nI also noticed that usually when you click 'Change values', there is no string displayed by v-ons-select, but occasionally it will display a number from options that is different from selectedValueOnsen.\n. This issue should be fixed by #2502 for this specific case with .fab.\nI think we'll need to look for a general way of avoiding these conflicts in the future. Possibly we could prefix all the classes with ons-, or maybe do ons-fab .fab like it is for the fix in #2502.\nAny thoughts or suggestions about what direction we should take would be appreciated!.

Ok, in that case I will merge this.\n\nI think the best way is to add prefix like ons- to all classes.\nHowever, it makes huge breaking changes (there may be a possibility to bump to 3.0.0).\n\nYes, I think so too. We're already planning to release 2.11.0 in a month or so, but maybe if we include the prefix change as well then we should just go straight to 3.0.0.. Thanks for the bug report.\nI confirmed this works as expected in normal Vue, so this is definitely an Onsen UI bug: https://codepen.io/emccorson/pen/WKgxgV. @digish777 I'm closing this because it's a question, not an issue. If you have a question about Onsen UI, please post it at https://community.onsen.io/ or https://discord.gg/NEMSxUF. . The only important files that I can see are in 2.10.4 but not 2.10.5 are the contents of bindings/react/docs. These are automatically generated so they don't need to be included.\nI don't see any other important missing files.. @aguingand Thanks a lot for this PR. Sorry it took so long to merge!\n@4lyn This will be included in the next release. If you need it now, you can clone this repo and build from master.. The demo in #2486 is working now.. In FontAwesome v5, fa-star-o was merged with fa-star so now they are both called fa-star. To get an outlined star you need to use the far class.\nhtml\n<ons-icon icon=\"fa-star\"></ons-icon>                       <!-- solid star -->\n<ons-icon class=\"far\" icon=\"fa-star\"></ons-icon>      <!-- outlined star -->\nThis doesn't actually work for the current release of OnsenUI but it has been fixed (#2595) and will be included in the next release. If you need the fix now, clone this repo and build from master.. Thanks for reporting this bug. I've confirmed that it is reproducible.\nI think the reason readonly was working is because React Input automatically passes unknown props to ons-input. ons-input then passes the props to a native input element if they are in this list:\n'autocapitalize',\n  'autocomplete',\n  'autocorrect',\n  'autofocus',\n  'disabled',\n  'inputmode',\n  'max',\n  'maxlength',\n  'min',\n  'minlength',\n  'name',\n  'pattern',\n  'placeholder',\n  'readonly',\n  'required',\n  'size',\n  'step',\n  'validator',\n  'value'\nIn other words, all of the items in this list should work as props on the React Input but they are undocumented.\nAs for readOnly (camelCase), it looks like since it is listed as a React prop, it gets converted to \"JS style\" naming, meaning separated by dashes instead of camelCase i.e. readOnly becomes read-only.\nI'm not sure whether to consider this a documentation problem or a bug. If it's a documentation problem, then the solution is to change readOnly to readonly in the documentation, and also add all the other missing items from the above list. If it's a bug then I guess readOnly should work but readonly shouldn't.. I think this is just errors in user code, not a bug with Onsen UI, so I'm going to tentatively close this. If it is actually a bug please correct me.. This fix is now released in vue-onsenui 2.6.2.. I'm not able to reproduce this on the latest version (2.10.6). The code I tried it with is posted at the bottom (it's just the normal carousel playground example with a notification added).\nSince this is for an old version and I can't reproduce it, I'm going to close this issue. If this is still broken, please post an example that reproduces the bug and I'll reopen.\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarousel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        BLUE\n      \n\n\n\n        DARK\n      \n\n\n\n        ORANGE\n      \n\n\n\n```\n```js\nvar prev = function() {\n  var carousel = document.getElementById('carousel');\n  carousel.prev();\n};\nvar next = function() {\n  var carousel = document.getElementById('carousel');\n  carousel.next();\n};\nons.ready(function() {\n  var carousel = document.addEventListener('postchange', function(event) {\n    console.log('Changed to ' + event.activeIndex)\n  });\n});\n```. Please ask questions at community.onsen.io or the discord channel.. I can't reproduce the bug with the demo link so I'm going to close this issue.\nI'm guessing this got fixed already somewhere else.. @aiba Thank you for the bug report\nThis is probably an issue with OnsenUI/onsen.io but I'll leave the issue in this repo for now until further investigation.. @puku0x Thanks for reporting this. I had read about this problem but didn't realise it affected Onsen UI  so that's a good catch!\nIt looks like the warnings were because of the event-stream vulnerability (dominictarr/event-stream#116). I've changed the package version of gulp-protractor to ^4.1.1 and the version of event-stream to 3.3.4 just to be on the safe side (#2590).\nStill looking into whether gulp-protractor should be a dependency. I think it was to do with splitting the AngularJS bindings into their own package. I'll comment again when I find out.. Should be fixed now in v2.10.6.. Sorry for the delay in replying. To be honest, I saw that Circle CI had\nfailed but then I forgot to reply.\nIt turns out the problem is rsync is not installed on the CI server. It\nruns Debian 9.6 which I guess doesn't install rsync by default.\nI'm not sure what the best course of action is here. If rsync is a program\nyou would expect most users to have installed then it should be fine to\njust install rsync on the CI server. I think it probably is quite a common\nprogram because I have it installed by default on my computer (Ubuntu\n18.04).\nWhat do you think?. @puku0x I've finally gotten round to reviewing this - sorry it has taken so long!\nI'm having a bit of trouble running this locally.\nI was trying to run schematics .:page from bindings/angular2 directory but I got this error:\nError: Package \".\" was found but does not support schematics.\nI think that was because there was no schematics key in package.json (it only exists in package-dist.json) so I added it and now I'm getting this error:\nAn error occured:\nError: Collection \".\" cannot be resolved.\n    at NodeModulesEngineHost._resolveCollectionPath (/home/eric/.nvm/versions/node/v10.14.1/lib/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics-cli/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/tools/node-module-engine-host.js:91:15)\n    at NodeModulesEngineHost.createCollectionDescription (/home/eric/.nvm/versions/node/v10.14.1/lib/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics-cli/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/tools/file-system-engine-host-base.js:111:27)\n    at SchematicEngine._createCollectionDescription (/home/eric/.nvm/versions/node/v10.14.1/lib/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics-cli/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/src/engine/engine.js:147:40)\n    at SchematicEngine.createCollection (/home/eric/.nvm/versions/node/v10.14.1/lib/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics-cli/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/src/engine/engine.js:140:43)\n    at NodeWorkflow.execute (/home/eric/.nvm/versions/node/v10.14.1/lib/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics-cli/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics/src/workflow/base.js:95:41)\n    at main (/home/eric/.nvm/versions/node/v10.14.1/lib/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics-cli/bin/schematics.js:162:24)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/eric/.nvm/versions/node/v10.14.1/lib/node_modules/@angular-devkit/schematics-cli/bin/schematics.js:253:5)\n    at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:688:30)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:699:10)\n    at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:598:32)\nDo you know any way I can fix this error? It's probably just something stupid I'm doing - I'm not very familiar with schematics.\nOnce I have it working from bindings/angular2 with the schematics command, I'll try it out from another project with the ng command.\nOther than that, the code looks good.\n. This should be fixed by #2590 which is now released in v2.10.6.. I think this problem arises when renderPage doesn't set a unique key for the returned page. The React Navigator's render method maps over the route stack with renderPage and the resulting array of pages is set as the child elements of Navigator:\n```javascript\nrender() {\n  const attrs = Util.getAttrs(this);\n  const pages = this.routes ? this.routes.map((route) => this.props.renderPage(route, this)) : null;\nreturn (\n     { this._navi = navi; }}>\n      {pages}\n    \n  );\n}\n```\nAccording to the React docs, it is probably bad form for renderPage to set a key since it returns a single element and keys only make sense in the context of a list. (https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#extracting-components-with-keys)\nBut as a workaround until we have a good solution, setting a unique key in renderPage should make the problem go away.. Looks like that's fixed it.\n@puku0x Thanks for your super-quick PR!. I think this is a good idea.\npostpush has event.enterPage so a solution would be to add event.enterPage to prepush as well.\n. react-onsenui 1.11.2 is now published.. @davidhealey Thanks for this detailed bug report!\nI haven't investigated this fully yet, but it looks like the bug can be reproduced without page 3 i.e. by making the first button point towards page1.html instead of going to page3.html.\nMy guess is that the problem is caused by pushPage not checking if the page that's being pushed is already in the page stack.. Reopening because #2611 doesn't actually fix the issue at all :man_facepalming:\nIt actually fixes the related issue of the checkbox not keeping its checked value when you push another page and then re-show the tabbar page using bringPageTop.\nFull example:\nJS:\njavascript\ndocument.addEventListener('init', function(event) {\n  var nav = document.getElementById('nav');\n});\nHTML:\n```html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanana\n<ons-button onclick=\"nav.bringPageTop('next-page.html')\">Next page</ons-button>\n\n\n\n\n\nTabbar page\n\n\n``` \n@davidhealey By the way, once the fix is in, your code should use ons-navigator.bringPageTop instead of ons-navigator.pushPage. bringPageTop only creates a new page if it doesn't already exist in the page stack; pushPage always pushes a new page. So since you want to reshow a page, you will need to use bringPageTop.. Well spotted! Thanks for the PR.. Do you mean the problem is when infiniteList.refresh() is called, or is it when the browser page is literally refreshed?\nI can't reproduce this bug from the playground link.. Thanks for the bug report.\nI confirmed that this bug is showing up on the playground. I also noticed that the cursor doesn't go into the input automatically if false is set.\nI'm not seeing any error though. What was the error you were getting @rtsawyer5 ?. @GoGross Why did you close this?. Thanks for the PR! I will have a look at it soon.\n@asial-matagawa Do you remember why this was removed before?. I don't have an iPad (2nd or 3rd generation) so to help fix this could you send the following information please?\nI'm looking for the user agent string from your browser on both 2nd and 3rd generation iPads. You can get it in a browser by running navigator.userAgent in the console.\nThe way isIPad currently works is by search the user agent string for \"iPad\". I'm guessing the 2nd generation user string contains it but the 3rd generation one doesn't.. I'm not able to reproduce this on Firefox 65 so I think it's probably not an Onsen error.\nI'll close this for now, but if it is still a problem, please comment and I'll re-open it.. I think this probably isn't a bug, and the question has already been asked here so I'll close this issue.. Can you please reproduce this in the playground? https://onsen.io/playground/\nOr if it can't be done in the playground because it's a local setup thing, please link to a repo that reproduces the problem.. Thanks for the PR!\nI've merged it now. The changes will show up on onsen.io the next time we do a release of Onsen UI.. I confirmed this bug is reproducible.\nIt looks like ons-icon has some code where even if class=\"fa-spin\" the class is getting removed during compilation.. I just realised that we already have a spin attribute that can be added to\nons-icon to make any icon spin:\n\n\nIt looks the same as fa-spin so unless you think there is a specific reason\nwe should add fa-spin, I think we can get away with leaving it out for now.\nWhat do you think? @devWaleed\n. Thanks for posting your solution.\nI think since the default behaviour for a normal checkbox is for the click to bubble up then we can just leave this the same in Onsen UI, and if anyone wants to stop it they can use stopPropagation.. I tried running your code but everything seems to be working fine.\nCan you post a reproducible version using the playground please? https://onsen.io/playground/. Thanks, I've made the change. This shorthand is used all over the code so if we're not going to use it, I think we should either add it to the style guide in CONTRIBUTORS.md or to eslint.. I just found out componentWillReceiveProps is going to get deprecated and renamed to UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps in React 17. It's fine for React 16 though.\nWe use this function all over the place so I've created an issue so we can deal with it all at once.. ",
    "karlvr": "Just leaving a note to say that we spent four of five hours today trying to get to the bottom of this issue. Using Safari on the desktop to debug Safari on the device (iPhone X), we were able to use breakpoints to observe the behaviour. I've added our notes below in case they help anyone. We have not been able to fix this issue, except to reduce any CPU time spent doing anything else while the transition occurs (as above).\nThe glitch is where the entering page is invisible, and it reveals the leaving page 25% to the left, and a 25% black stripe down the right. The black stripe is the background that IOSSlideNavigatorAnimator adds to the DOM. The 25% is the amount the transition in IOSSlideNavigatorAnimator moves the leaving page to the left.\nWhy is the entering page invisible?\nThe entering page is not removed from the DOM at any time during the transition. We have verified this by setting \"node removed\" breakpoints on the new page node for the duration of the transition (and after).\nRemoving the call to reset() in Animit.restoreStyle() does not have any impact on the glitch. It of course leaves the DOM nodes with the completed transition attributes intact. We thought that perhaps it was the removal of these elements that caused the issue.\nWe did discover that if some of the elements that are animated in IOSSlideNavigatorAnimator.push don't exist, then we still try to animate them, but we then get the timeout called as those animations don't finish. Perhaps Animit could call done immediately if the supplied elements don't have parent nodes. Changing this, however, did not affect the glitch.\nSomething that did reduce the appearance of glitches was changing util.onceOnTransitionEnd in animit.js to call the callback after a timeout, e.g. setTimeout(callback, 0);. This dramatically reduced but did not rid us of the glitch.\nAt the end of the day (and it is, the end of the day) it feels like Safari is dropping the ball on rendering the page divs for a few frames while the CPU is busy.\nI hope someone else has better luck that we have, or a fix comes to Safari.. My work in progress playground:\n This link will work once the issue is created \nDemo link\n Do not change the following code structure \n\nHTML\n\nhtml\n<div id=\"app\"></div>\n\nJS\n\n```jsx\nvar MyPage = React.createClass({\nrenderToolbar: function(route, navigator) {\n    return (\n      \n{route.title}\n\n    );\n  },\ndataSource: function() {\n    return ['a', 'b', 'c'];\n  },\nrenderRow: function(row, index) {\n    return (\n      \n\n\n\n\n          {row}\n        \n\n    );\n  },\npushPage: function(navigator) {\n    navigator.pushPage({\n      title: 'Another page'\n    });\n  },\nrenderPage: function(route, navigator) {\n    if (route.title === 'First page') {\n      return (\n        \n\n            Push Page\n          \n\n      );\n    } else if (route.title === 'Another page') {\n      return (\n        \n\n\n      );\n    }\n  },\nrender: function() {\n    return (\n      \n    );\n  }\n});\nons.ready(function() {\n  ReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('app'));\n});\n```\n. I've discovered where the second componentDidMount is coming from. Using an integration between RouterNavigator and Redux (which I put together, based on some other examples, https://github.com/karlvr/onsenui-react-redux-navigator) there is a Redux action dispatched on postPush that causes the Redux state to change, and thus the components to re-mount.\nI'm dissatisfied that the Redux integration causes this double-mount, but it feels like it's not breaking React rules, so I think this is something that could be fixed in Onsen's BaseInput. As above, I have tested a fix. I'm happy to provide a PR so we can review and discuss.. I'm trying to track down the double mount further, and I think it's in RouterNavigator. Has anyone observed this before?. OK, I have found and fixed the issue above (see #2424). I think Checkbox can still be improved / fixed with the PR associated with this issue.. @asialgearoid no problem at all, thank you!. ",

These 3 rules are reflected in the pen:\nhttps://codepen.io/thecrusher/pen/BxXrRX\nThis works fine for everything, except when using the iPhoneX mode. In Chrome, you can inspect the above pen and switch to mobile view and see the behavior.\n. Thanks! I do remember seeing that modifier. I had tried using it in conjunction with the transparent modifier, but it didn't seem to make any difference, so I stopped using it. I guess I was wrong :)  Thanks again.. I remember now another (more important reason) why I didn't end up using the cover-content option. If you have a page that needs to scroll, transparent + cover-content really does make the toolbar transparent, and overlay content. I suppose that sounds obvious, but I was using the transparent modifier to just match the color of the toolbar to the color of the page.  In many cases I still have text in the \"center\" of the toolbar, which makes the true transparent + cover-content option undesirable (causes overlapping content).. ",

When I did that, it said, \"Almost up to date, restart Chrome to complete update\" or something like that.  The version number was 66.x.  So I thought to myself, \"maybe this behavior is because Chrome is in a state of partially updated.\"  I restarted Chrome, but the issue persisted.  I looked at the version, and it had been successfully updated to 67.0.3396.87.  So...

    "mittermayr": "Terribly late with my response, but I finally had a chance to build a barebones example of what I have roughly going on with a bigger app. Your vanillaJS demo worked flawlessly, so I got concerned and decided to write a fresh react-bindings-powered version. \nThe good news: the issue can't be reproduced there, which is very odd.\nSo I guess you can close this issue now, and if I can manage to reproduce it in the barebones app, then I will ask to re-open. I wanted to leave this comment for anyone looking through the archives and hints on restoring scroll position, here's the barebones version for React, where a Segment switches between two lists and restores scroll positions on each. Onsen List Scroll Restore Barebones Example\nThanks again for taking the time to writing the vanilla JS demo.. Another update: I have found the issue, finally. This is an issue to do with React-LazyLoad, which I had used as a replacement for the ons-lazy-repeat functionality, to have more fine-grained control over how the lazy-loading should happen. This worked perfectly in all cases, except for scroll restoration. React-LazyLoad requires to hook into the onScroll event of Ons.Page to function at all, and that, possibly in combination with the hard-coded (!) row height LazyLoad height={...}, this seems to cause trouble. \nAgain, sorry about wasting anyone's time with this, I had removed LazyLoad from one of the two lists to make sure it wasn't interfering, but saw the same problem. Having left LazyLoad enabled on the second list was enough to still cause the issue on the first list.

Any objects whose keys matched the original init values would show up, but all others would be hidden.  And if none of the objects matched the init values, the visible cards would disappear.  It was maddening.  I thought it had something to do with the way I was handling the data variable. \nThe workaround of wrapping the objects with a single div fixed the problem.

    "sts-ryan-holton": "Anyone??. @KettleCooked  Thanks for the help, I've moved away from Onsen UI and moved into Nuxt JS and Vuetify 2 https://vuetifyjs.com/en/ as the community surrounding Onsen UI is a little vague. ",
    "KettleCooked": "Hey, I'm new to onsen, and the whole programming thing actually but I'll try to share something since it's looking a little dead in here. There's two things that come to mind:\n\n\nFirst and most likely, the lack of animations is due to your use of the vue router instead of the onsen navigator. Using onsen navigator will automatically deal with animations but using the vue router you will have to manually add the animations.\n\n\nLess likely an issue, but you are using the onsen back button. I guess adding a click event to the button it should be fine, but from what I know the back button is specific in that it will automatically search for the parent onsen navigator component and pop off the last page in the navigator stack. This is from what I understand. But you are pushing a page with the vue router, and yet popping a page with the onsen navigator. These are very different things. \n\n\nSo if you want to use the vue router, do not use the ons-back-button, instead use a generic button and use a 'back button arrow\" icon instead, so you don't have that extra functionality of the ons-back-back-button. But if you want the animations automatically, use the onsen navigator instead of vue router, which also means that you can easily place the ons-back-back-button anywhere with out extra work.. @sts-ryan-holton I don't blame you, I personally think Onsen has a strong product, and in some important ways was ahead of the more popular Ionic, but the community is so dead that it makes you wonder if even Monaca is still supporting Onsen..

    "wcmhc": "Container Height: ons-lazy-repeat inherits its height from its parent. Since #listHolder is set to 50%, #infinite-list inherits 50% and becomes half the height of its parent.\nNo scrollbar: OnsenUI hides scrollbars for the most part since that takes away from the mobile experience, and ons-list is no exception since it is a native-like component.\nTo overcome these issues, use CSS similar to this. If you do not want to use set pixel amounts, I would suggest having an outer wrapper at 50% height, and an inner wrapper at 100% height that contains the ons-list so that it inherits 100% of the parent height:\n```css\n\n  #listHolder {\n    height: 200px;\n  }</p>\n<p>#listHolder &gt; ons-list {\n    overflow-y: visible;\n  }\n\n```\n. Do you have a code sample that recreates this issue, preferably on the OnsenUI Playground (https://onsen.io/playground/) or your own code?\nIf not, what is the timing/flow of the popping? Are you doing it inside pre/post events, in the page that was pushed, etc?. I cant recreate it on the playground and I won't be of much further use as I only work with the Core/Plain JS version of the framework. I can't seem to reproduce a memory leak with Chrome Version 68.0.3440.106 (Official Build) (64-bit), Chromium V8 6.8.275.26.\n\nI used your exact code plus a small script addition to cycle in and out of Page 2 which resulted in a 3MB fluctuation in the heap that was garbage collected fairly regularly with a mass collection near the start of the profiling. The flat line at the end corresponds to Chrome opening the captured profile, hence the large spike in CPU (not sure why that portion is included in the profiling timeline, but it's there). The timeline shows 70 seconds (70000ms on the timeline) of running which means 70 cycles of pushing and popping the navigator. My tests used the heap profiling tool in Chrome.\nExtra code:\nhtml\n<script>\nsetInterval(function() {\n    myNavigator.pushPage('page1.html');\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        myNavigator.popPage();\n    }, 500);\n}, 1000);\n</script>\nNote: The 800+ errors are from the navigator being in a transition state when the next popPage() or pushPage(...) is called due to the timers being too short and are thrown by OnsenUI; they are not actual errors. Increase each timer by 2x for reduced errors. I simply want it to be more apparent\nAre you able to point me to a specific portion of the heap snapshot, otherwise?. ",
