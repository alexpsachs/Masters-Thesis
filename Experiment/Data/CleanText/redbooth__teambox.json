We're all for un-hardcoding stuff, english word in the code is evil.\nMerged and I wrote a spec for it\n. Hey @flov, sorry for being so long.\nWe could'nt agree on this one because we like rvm but we don't like using rvm in production.\nI added .rvmrc to the .gitignore, so that anyone can deal with it like they want\n. We had to use some SQL trick to do this on teambox.com due to size of our database, but in most case its probably not required.\nI'll write an active record alternative for this one, so that its completely database agnostic, its now on my todos list\n. Thanks, pulled\n. hmm, I should setup postgres and try to run the test on it once in a while :/\nLet me know tomorrow\n. See pull request 18\n. Hi @mmehnert, thanks for contributing.\nWe have a fix for this one in the edge branch (dev), its going to be part of the next release.\nIf you don't want to wait until the next release, I suggest you to cherry-pick the fix.\nMake sure you have the dev branch fetched\ngit fetch\nAnd cherry pick this commit\nThis fix use Arel to generate the query instead of SQL to make it database agnostic.\ngit cherry-pick 7cfeb9b2fcd51baac36f3e50627aa7242e417620\nThis commit take advantage of the latest immortal gem, if you have issue after cherry-picking, you might have to bump the immortal gem to the latest version. I'm not sure its available on the immortal version version of master branch.\n. thanks @denisnovikov for the fix\nI don't know the details of the bug, this need a failing test so it won't happen again. Can you explain me the bug so I can write spec or it or provide us a failing test?\n. I tried to make capybara-webkit working for us in april, but the test where alway failing after a few scenario. The webkit process would eventually die randomly\n. thanks, got that fixed in the dev branch but master hasn't been merge in a long time now.

    "anhtuanvan": "Sorry for the confusion. Yes, it is only the last commit: 919cdd1a9d4627370b0cb3f7dd33814ccfcf7dc1\nHow do I make a pull request for only one commit?\nThe issue is that the incoming script fails silently. If I reply to a conversation or if I post a new task per mail to the Inbox task list then the mail still remains in the inbox of the teambox mail account. So I run the incoming script manually and add some more detailed exception information (see comment of 919cdd1a9d4627370b0cb3f7dd33814ccfcf7dc1). The exception says that the log method of the Activity class is unknown. Though I suggest that the whole Activity class is unknown to the log_activity method in the Project class.\nBut I don't know if my commit fixed the root of the problem. So maybe you can have a look what is going on, because you are the experts ;)\nThe second issue is that exceptions and errors in incoming.rb are not logged to any log file or maybe I couldn't find it. So it is really hard to see if and why an error occurs.\nThanks in advance.\n. ",

Hi guys, just wondered if you had a chance to look at this pull request (and the equivalent on master)?
