    "ddennedy": "Feel free to provide a mockup. The main symbolic theme of the logo is \"][\" - the appearance of a cut on the timeline - one shot ending and the other beginning. That theme must be maintained. Inclusion of the MLT logo is optional.\n. How do you feel this compares with the existing logo?\nPlease be aware that the \"app icon\" cannot be used in the Linux launcher icon in the binary builds I (Meltytech) \nprovides for Linux due to limitations in the .desktop file standard and the desire to not require a system installation. That may change once distributions start providing (outdated) versions of Shotcut. For now, the way to see the Shotcut logo is to look on the home page or about dialog. Windows and OS X builds do have proper support for custom launcher app icons.\n. I also used Droid typeface, but I do not know if I like the all caps. The interface color is dependent on the OS and the user's chosen theme at this time, and most people will not have a dark theme. I do not have plans to make a custom skin at this time. The ][ is definitely more prominent in your design and something definitely worth considering; however, what do you think about a symmetric ][ versus the asymmetric look?\n. Not interested.\n. no, dlopen failures are not crashes, your version of Debian is too old for the binary builds, and support is not provided at this time. This issue list is only for contributing patches.\n. \"HD 1080i 29.97 fps\" is equivalent to \"1080i 59.94 Hz\". I highly doubt a full 60 Hz will work. I do not know why it does not work for you; it works fine for me last time I checked, but I will check again. If you can figure it out, submit a patch or pull request. Otherwise, support is not being provided at this time. \n. I wanted to merge your contributions now, but now they are gone! I suppose when you pulled my qt5 branch that changed history, you had to reset losing your change and then pushed. However, even the commits on master, whose history did not change was affected. Can you check if you happen to have them on your filesystem.\n. Thanks! The good news is that it basically works quite good. I still need to check it on OS X and Windows, but I think it will be OK. The bad news is that they are too big. My filter parameter UI area is 4:3 in the top left corner of the window, which is its default location now, and it can only show one full wheel. I have to figure out how to constrain the width of the filter UI area or to make the colorwheel sizes adjust to the smaller of the two dimensions.\n. I changed it and got sizing to work. Now, one thing I am thinking is that it would be nice if we still provided a UI for people who had used the old frei0r filter in a project, but still leave that filter unlisted in the add -filter menu. I am not going to bend over for backwards compatibility, in general, but this does not seem so difficult, and it is a tad unkind to yank that away!\n. Brian, there is not going to be 1.0 releases and version branches; the\ncurrent versioning system is the way I want it to work. Regarding,\n\"...rapid change...people should accept that things might change,\" most\npeople downloading it now (over 10,000 a month, mostly Windows) do not know\nthat. They are just downloading a free program and do not follow the\nproject.\nI will make a QML file for the legacy fei0r_coloradj filter as it will be\neasy.\n. This has been merged manually.\n. FYI, one must re-run lupdate for each translation file after this change, which I did. Normally, I only update a translation file after the translator has made updates on transifex.com.\n. No, I will do it while merging translations and/or updating the master english translation for new strings.\n. No @apolakipso it (the reported bug) does not happen on OS X - at least not for me. There are troubles with the filter timecode fields on OS X, but that is a different bug.\n. fixed in v15.09\n. I already looked into this once with a debugger but did not find the problem. However, we should be able to make a workaround given the above info about results property.\n. Windows only, Brian. Workaround committed in 130084bf9bd842824c60cca0a32245752cf518d5.\n. That workaround was reverted. Another workaround was submitted to MLT. It makes the filter ignore the results property at the end of analysis. There is something wrong with switching from analyze to apply. Will close when 14.07 released.\n. In a couple months - when we upgrade the version of Qt we use - we are dropping support for 10.6 and 10.7: https://blog.qt.io/blog/2015/05/15/qt-5-5-beta-released/\n. As Shotcut v15.09, 10.6 is dropped, and it is working again for me on my 10.8 system.\n. This is fixed in v15.09 on my Windows 10 machine with NVIDIA.\n. This happens with ALSA. Using PulseAudio or JACK is a workaround as they create a new client instead of exclusively opening the device.\n. Closing because screen capture was removed.. I cannot reproduce it. This part is just some simple QML, which uses OpenGL for rendering, and this looks like some incompatibility somewhere perhaps within Qt 5. What is your GPU and xorg driver?\n. Would you please do a favor and test some simple changes to help narrow down the bug?\nLocate the file Preset.qml in Shotcut.app/share/shotcut/qml/modules/Shotcut/Controls. Comment out lines 47 and/or 48 by putting \"//\" at the beginning of those lines:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/src/qml/modules/Shotcut/Controls/Preset.qml#L47\nLet me know if that prevents the crash - both lines, or which line. It will make the preset combo useless but will help isolate the problem.\n. Yeah, looks like a Qt 5.2 on Catalyst bug. I just got an AMD card over the weekend. The machine it is going into is primarily OS X and Windows 8, but I can add Linux to it either from USB or another hard drive. I doubt it will help me much to fix the problem in current code, but I can at least try to reproduce and see if Qt 5.3 is better.\n. I just reproduced the problem as well using one of the examples with Qt 5.2 (on Catalyst fglrx driver). Then, I rebuilt the example on 5.3 and the problem went away. I have an issue with Qt 5.3 on OS X that I need to investigate further before upgrading Shotcut to 5.3.\n. The gallery example on Qt 5.2.1 does not crash, but the app deadlocks. So, that is not an option.\n. The problem with Qt 5.3 is not limited to OS X. It affects all platforms:\nhttps://bugreports.qt-project.org/browse/QTBUG-39800\nIt is not convenient to make one-off full-app-deliverable builds because we use a lengthy script, build nodes, and a nightly build server.\n. I recently found out about an environment variable that might help: LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1\nhttp://www.mesa3d.org/envvars.html\n. Needs to be retested on v15.09.\n. There was already a ToolTip.qml in the timeline folder. There are two special properties on the timeline object to expose the correct tooltip colors from the QApplication::palette(). We need to compare the two implementation and clean this up. That probably also means moving those 2 properties to the QmlUtilities object, which is a better home for them now anyways.\n. On Mon, Jun 9, 2014 at 8:24 PM, Brian Matherly notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nRE ToolTip: I agree. There should only be one. The one I wrote uses a\nwindow to display the tool tip. The reason is that a QML component can't\nexceed the boundary of its quickview. So longer tool tips in the filter\ndock would be clipped by the preview window (rather than being displayed\nover it). Using a window is not ideal, but I can't find another way to keep\nthe tool tips from clipping in our hybrid QML/QWidget environment. So I\npropose that we use the one I wrote.\n\nOK, I understand the drawbacks of using Rectangle vs. Window, but I will\nhave to test it. I have seen some funky things with window positioning\nparticularly on OS X. I will do that tonight.\n\nRE tooltip colors: I would have to question how important it is to use the\ntwo tooltip colors from QApplication::palette(). Based on my research in\nboth Linux and Windows, toolTipBase resolves to \"palette.highlight\" and\ntoolTipText resolves to \"palette.light\". I used the later in both cases and\nmy tooltip looks like the native tips in Linux. Interestingly, in Windows,\nQWidget based tooltips use colors that are different from toolTipBase and\ntoolTipText. So there is no way to make them match in Windows - even with\nthe QApplication palette. However, I do agree that if we want to expose\nthose colors, utilities would be a good place to do that.\nThere is not really such a thing as \"native tips\" in Linux. What is\nimportant is that our QML ToolTip is consistent with the QWidget and Quick\nControl tooltips across themes. I just tested highlight and light on OS X,\nand it fails for both System and Fusion Light whereas my colors are correct.\nRE QmlUtilities: I agree - it should be done the same everywhere. I would\nbe inclined to expose it as a type (as I did) rather than a context\nproperty because it doesn't have any statefulness - it is just a collection\nof static functions. But I can go either way. If we do expose it as a\nproperty, I think we should rename the property to \"utilities\".\n\nI hear you on the state thing; that makes sense to me. BTW, I chose\n\"Shotcut\" to resemble the utility \"Qt\" object in QML.\n\nLet me know how you want to go on ToolTips and QmlUtilities and I can make\nthe changes.\n.

Currently, when the theme changes, we send a signal, which is connected to the timeline dock to notify about the tooltip property changes. If we move those properties to QmlUtilities, then we need an object to which to connect that signal. But if the Utilities object is instantiated in QML, then we can't easily get to that signal because MainWindow is not exposed to our QML. This could be an argument for keeping Utilities as a context object. Or, we can receive that signal in the filters dock, and make it reload the current QML, which really seems to be what is needed anyways to handle theme changes in filter UIs.\n. Hi, thanks for all the data. Looks like a consistent problem based on issue #23 and feedback from the g+ community forum.\n. Closing this as a duplicate. Progress is tracking in the original.\n. Do you volunteer to make this?\n. I am being sincere, not snarky. We could use some help.\n. Closing this because it is not a bug, and we only use this issues tracker for bugs, not enhancement requests. Thank you for considering to help in the future.\n. If you do not include all of the dependencies I use for my builds such as Movit, WebVfx, vid.stab, and FFmpeg (2.3) (not Libav), then I do not give Debian permission to name and brand it Shotcut.\n. Shotcut is a trademark of MeltyTech LLC same as Firefox is a trademark of Mozilla:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation_software_rebranded_by_the_Debian_project\nAs sole proprietor of MeltyTech, I do not give permission to use the Shotcut trademark to make versions based on unsupported (by me) software components and versions.\n. I only want to support and have people using very fixed software configurations regardless of OS or distribution. I do not want to make packages that install into the system and includes components that may conflict with already installed software or packages from the repository. That is an additional level of management for which I do not volunteer. If you make something outside of the configuration prescribed in the build script (for the most part, not 100%), do not call it Shotcut, regardless of whether it is submitted to Debian, is a PPA, or sits on a web server announced through some means.\n. In the US, a trademark does not necessarily need to be registered: http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/register.jsp\nI will soon add a trademark disclosure on the web site and About dialog. If someone wants an editor for Linux desktop through their package manager, then consider to use Kdenlive or Flowblade -  two other fine MLT-based projects.\n. >  would you be interested in having an AppImage? @probonopd \nMaybe, I have been aware of that option for a couple of years. Except, now there are Snaps and Flatpaks. And all of them have a weakness compared to my current archive approach: one must be running the app to have the filesystem mounted in order to take advantage of the other executables Shotcut provides: melt, qmelt, ffmpeg, and ffprobe.\nHowever, I think these do all have the advantage of preventing people from running the binary executable instead of the script wrapper. Also, some desktop environments do not support Shotcut's current launch icon that uses a hack in order to run an executable relative to the icon's directory - something not expressly permitted in the FreeDesktop.org spec.\n. It is available in the deb-multimedia repo.. Thanks. I somewhat see where it is failing. There are a few steps in the step the failed but not enough logging detail there to pinpoint it. I am not quite sure, but for sure I will add some more logging in there.\n. It would be interesting to know if the previous version works. Please uninstall the current version first.\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/releases/tag/v14.06\nAlso, it looks like the github markdown processor might be doing something with the text in angle brackets from your log. Next time, if it comes to it, put 3 backticks () on a line by itself before the log text and 3 of them on a line after the log text. (I just added them to your bug report to fix that.)\n. It seems to be unable to locate any of the MLT plugins in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Shotcut\\lib\\mlt.\nDo you see a bunch of DLLs in there?\nDid you download Shotcut through the main website shotcut.org or shotcutapp.com?\n. OK, thanks. The MLT plugins are required, and I clearly see they are not loaded from your log even though the files exist. They do all of the media processing. I just have no idea why they do not load for you as it works fine for me and many others. What sort of anti-virus and anti-malware software do you use? I wonder if something like that is preventing the app from seeing the plugins.\n. Thank you for continuing on with me. There is another thing we can check out. Open a command prompt (cmd.exe) andcd \"\\Program Files (x86)\\Shotcut\". Then, runmelt -query`. That will list all of the MLT functions in its plugins and give us some another perspective about the problem around the MLT plugins. Try to paste some of your command prompt buffer here. Thanks\n. Your melt -query output confirms the same problem: it cannot get the plugins, but I have no idea why and have been unable to reproduce it. I will try it on some more systems, but that may take a long time as I have to talk to people that I interact with, tell them about the project, ask to show it to them.... \n. At the moment, I suspect there is a common DLL that is missing from my installer. And for most people, after installing a few apps, this common DLL ends up in system32. Are you familiar with the depends.exe tool? My Windows 8.1 box is fairly fresh, but not virgin; I am trying to locate a very fresh system to test. Meanwhile, we can schedule a Skype session sometime this weekend to walk through troubleshooting with depends, but I am not available at most times, which is why I need to schedule it.\n. Yes that time is good. Skype id is ddennedy\n. Adding some notes... another user notes on G+:\n\nI changed some options in Properties tab (Compatibility). I set up to \"Run this as Admin\" and Windows XP SP2 compability mode. Then I restarted my PC and that did the trick.\ufeff\n\nJames and I met on Skype. He is running with an admin account - trying to run using the same account he used to install. We tried using compatibility mode, installing to Desktop instead of Program Files (x86), and diagnosing missing DLLs with depends.exe, but nothing we tried succeedeed. :-(\n. Thanks for confirming, James. I added the lessons learned here to our FAQ:\nhttp://shotcut.org/bin/view/Shotcut/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#Why_does_it_crash_on_Windows_upo\n. The conflict with JahShaka was fixed in latest 14.10.05 release.\n. As far as I can tell the new technology in versions Oct. 1 2013 and later is simply incompatible with your system - perhaps its OpenGL implementation. A sufficient OpenGL version alone is not enough; there can be incompatibilities with the OpenGL implementation in the drivers and video card. What is the video card/chip make+model in your computer?\n. OK, you have an Intel GMA 4500M. More than likely, through Windows Update, you already have the latest driver. There is no \"OpenGL driver\" to download; OpenGL support is a part of the regular driver download. However, it is simply incompatible despite the version being sufficient as I already explained. And Intel does not keep maintaining and enhancing these Windows drivers because product cycles must continue especially on Windows. On Linux you will have a better chance due to the architecture of OpenGL implementation on it, the open source driver methodology, and Intel's participation in that. The Shotcut software does do some checks to try to determine compatibility and show an error instead of crashing; however, it is not fool proof. I am not going to do anything about this as Shotcut does not seek the lowest common denominator and utmost compatibility. I have limited resources, this is a hobby, and there are other things to work on. It is possible that a future version of Shotcut that upgrades its Qt 5 library will become compatible.\n. Needs to be retested on v15.09.\n. @elijah60 It would be great if you can retest this with v15.09. I have a system with Intel G45, which previously did not work but now does since this new version can use DirectX. Not saying it is totally crash free, but you should at least be able to start it and play a video. Thanks\n. Works for me now with a very similar GPU.\n. I cannot support Linux packages at this time because I cannot be sure they will be using the exact versions of Shotcut and MLT direct dependencies and updated monthly. I could still merge this, but I do not want to give the impression that I approve of what you are doing. Do you still want to continue?\n. Partially fixed in git commit f83960a. That fixes some image processing bugs. There are still problems needing fixed related to the rectangle UI control when using a non-square-pixel video mode.\n. UI parts fixed in Shotcut git commit dd48ec9. I will close this ticket on next release.\n. The YouTube video is private. \"Jumping\" is not a meaningful description.\n. It would be nice to have a different default font on Windows, but we do not have a way to detect OS in QML. We can extend some C++ helper object to provide that. Or, we can change the default font to the common alias 'monospace' (not something OS-specific). I will test with monospace.\n. The problem is the default font. You can not test this simply through the UI; only by code change. The current default is \"sans\" and Qt uses a font-matching algorithm to make the best selection for the drawing/rendering part, but it does not choose the same thing for the font dialog. It is actually rendering using Arial, even though when you initially open the font dialog it shows \"MS Shell Dlg 2.\" If you use the Text filter and change the font to MS Shell Dlg 2 to make the problem go away, but you can see the font style change. If you then change it to Arial the problem reoccurs and it draws the same as default.\nUnfortunately, \"monospace\" as a default does not work. Apparently, Qt does not know what to do with that and reverts to sans, which is its built-in default. Also, unfortunately, there is not really a single non-proportional font available across OSes that we can choose as a default. That means I must do a little in C++ to expose an OS name to QML.\n. Fixed in MLT git commit c28bd49. I will close this on the next release.\n. Sorry, I cannot see what is going wrong. Based on the changes, I am inclined to think there is an OpenGL problem, but it is not clear that is the problem from the log. I primarily develop on 64-bit Kubuntu 14.04 system with nvidia. The OpenGL code is generally quite compatible with both nvidia and intel with mesa. If you know how to produce a backtrace report with gdb, that will help.\n. From stack item 6, /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mlt/libmltqt.so, the MLT Qt plugin is linked with some Qt 4 version: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQtGui.so.4 (stack item 0). However, Shotcut requires Qt v5.2.0, and you cannot mix major versions of Qt in the same process. The Linux build I provide, launched using the provided icon or script, uses its own bundled version of MLT and Qt and avoids this problem. It appears the original poster is running an official build, and this backtrace is not related.\n. @aapo Are you experiencing the same problem using our build/download? If so and you are trying to help diagnose the problem, I do not want you to feel like I am being uncooperative. Here is what I do. I \"export QTDIR=$HOME/Qt/5.2.0/gcc_64\" (where I have installed Qt Creator and Qt 5.2 SDK). QTDIR makes the melt configure script see and use that version of Qt. I configure mlt with \"--prefix=$HOME/opt\" and make install it into there. Then, I edit ~/.profile to set env vars PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and PKG_CONFIG_PATH to use $HOME/opt/{bin,lib,lib/pkgconfig} as needed. Restart bash terminal or \"source ~/.profile\" to actually set env vars. Now, they are set for every time I use bash. Next, I build shotcut, cd $buildDir, mkdir -p share/shotcut, cd share/shotcut, ln -s ../../../shotcut/src/qml. Shotcut locates its qml dir relative to its executable. Hope that helps.\n. @8spinach If you run Shotcut.app/shotcut launch script in a terminal window, what does it report after it crashes? Same as log in your original report or more?\n. @santanuchakrabarti The relevant error from your log is:\n[Warning] mlt_repository_init: failed to dlopen\n/host/Application/linux/video/Shotcut/Shotcut.app/lib/mlt/libmltavformat.so\n(/host/Application/linux/video/Shotcut/Shotcut.app/lib/libavdevice.so.55: undefined symbol: _XGetRequest)\nThe MLT avformat module is failing to load and is an essential component. It appears that libX11 in Ubuntu 11.10 is incompatible with our build of Shotcut. I am not going to do anything about it; the download page on the site clearly states Ubuntu 12.04+. You can try building it on your own, but I am not going to help you; see scripts/build-shotcut.sh in the Shotcut source code tree.\n. @FTLFE Your output definitely ooks like a OpenGL compatibility problem since it crashed inside initializeGL(). What is your GPU and OpenGL implementation? You can run 'glxinfo | grep OpenGL'.\n. @FTLFE Shotcut has a lot of problems with Linux AMD Catalyst (fglrx). See also #23. We need someone to help fix it. The current developers do not have a Radeon system on which to debug and test. \n. @FTLFE Your problem is being tracked in recently opened bug #54.\n@8spinach Are you using the AMD Catalyst (fglrx) as well?\n. Needs to be retested on v15.09.\n. @IMAUZS Even though this says \"error\" it is not a critical error and should be more like informational. DeckLink drivers are not required, and this is not the source of your problem. This is just Shotcut trying to open any DeckLink device to see if it is available. I will change the message from an \"error\" to a \"warning\" for the next release 17.03.. I am not able to reproduce it. Do you only see this in preview within the app or on rendered output as well? Either I need exact steps, or it must wait until I run into the problem myself.\nWhat is your Windows region and language set to? It could be that this is a numeric locale processing problem. We have had some issues in the past on locales that use comma as decimal point, but I believe most were addressed.\n. I set my Windows 7 region number/date format to German and set Shotcut to German (because I can understand that language a little), but I still did not reproduce it. However, I did reproduce an issue with some video files/formats that there was a slight jump between the out frame of the transition and the in frame of the following clip. This appears to be due to an inaccurate seek on that file format.\nAre you using very different source video file formats between the Ubuntu and Windows sessions?\n. Thank you, Thierry. It does sound like a numeric locale processing problem. Locale handling is different on Windows. From your description, it sounds like the sub-seconds field of the time values stored in the XML are being dropped causing these transitions and shots to start earlier than expected. Can you please upload a small .mlt file that contains a transition? Is your Shotcut Language Setting set to French or English?\n. Heh, it appears that when you reply to Github app, file attachments are not preserved. But that is OK because I have reproduced it now. \n. Fixed in MLT git commit b928fac. I will close this when the next version is released.\n. DPX image sequences are not supported at this time. Limitations are not bugs, and I do not use this to track feature requests.\n. Basically, we do not use FFmpeg for most image and image sequence support; we use Qt QImage and have our own image sequence handling. FFmpeg having good image sequence support is a somewhat recent thing. At some point I need to investigate switching to that or having better support for that.\nFor now there is a workaround. Open the first image, then choose File > Open Other > Network. You will notice the file path to that first DPX image is already filled in in the URL field. Really, this tab lets you input any MLT resource specifier. Change the numeric part of the file name into a pattern, e.g. Ny_25_fps-%04d.dpx. Press OK and Shotcut starts to play it, but now it thinks it is a Live source and provides no seeking or trimming. Choose File > Save and save a virtual clip as MLT XML. Now, open the MLT XML file and it has a duration and you can seek, scrub, and use it as a clip.\n. Actually, seeking and scrubbing on DPX image sequence is not working good and not reliable. Oh well.\n. I decided to re-open this. This bug fell into a gray area for me, and I could not decide how to handle it for a while. If there is something in our technology stack that is integrated but does not work correctly and can be expected to work correctly within Shotcut/MLT constraints, then it should be a bug even if I have never used it or know anything about it. I do not have to feel like I am obligated to fix it within a certain time or that I am even obligated to fix it at all or fix it for free. Someone might just want to check on status and track it, or they might be wanting to help and looking for things to do.\n. What documentation?\n. Shotcut requires MLT git. I just checked readmes, and it does not specify a specific version. The build script makes it clear it uses git master, and this is by design.\n. This is by design.\n. It's a workflow thing as far I recall from the power user who requested it. The playhead is moved to the place where you are likely to make the next edit when doing insert and assemble editing. I forwarded to him this ticket. Besides, there could be a bunch of little things like this that I do not use this tracker for - better for discussion forum. I only use this bug tracker for hard defect tracking.\n. r300 FP: Compiler Error:\ncompiler/r300_fragprog_emit.c::emit_alu(): Too many ALU instructions\nUsing a dummy shader instead.\nLooks like an OpenGL problem. I will try to reproduce, but might be limited to this card/driver/version and related to number of QML objects. Please let me know if you observe something related to complexity/length of timeline.\n. Related: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35257\nIndeed, it does appear that some OpenGL limitation is exceeded for this card/driver/version.\n. When you say \"empty\" does that mean you can reproduce it simply by starting app, opening clip, and pressing End? Or, does it only crash after you use the timeline, remove everything from the timeline, and then press End? Steps to reproduce for the simplest case would help. I have an ATI card I can throw into my Linux workstation to try to repro.\n. I just fixed crashing on End key in Git commit 2a63d53. I will revisit the seeking behavior on some future video editing project to decide if I will change it or not. This ticket will close on next release.\n. So far I have not reproduced it. There are some general problems with dragging trim handles to make transitions, but I have not had a crash.\n. Intermittent, non-reproducable crashes with no backtrace information are not actionable.\n. It is not supposed to be like this, and I do not reproduce it even though some people have complained about it. It seems to be some problem in an unpredictable order of evaluation of javascript in QML.\n. The problem occurred on locales (or LC_NUMERIC) that use comma as the decimal separator. Fixed in git commit 10909a3.\n. Translation changes must go through transifex.com.\n. I am not able to reproduce it using my desktop running LANG=en_US.UTF-8 by copying and pasting the text \"T\u00e9l\u00e9chargements\" from this page to make a folder in my $HOME. I do not know why. Maybe if I create the directory by manually entering extended characters, or maybe I need to run a different locale.\nAnother developer (not a Shotcut developer, but a competent one with KDE background) reported the same problem, and he could not figure out either thinking it might be a Qt bug.\n. I just made a test after learning how to input special accent characters from the keyboard, and that succeeded as well.\n. This was fixed in the launch script as of 15.05.\n. You are not using the correct version of MLT. Shotcut requires a git trunk of MLT and specific versions other projects. See scripts/build-shotcut.sh for details on the versions to use.\n. I believe you are working on that NixOS package. Shotcut is not setup to be delivered in package format. This is intentional. I have been working on open source video editing software for Linux for 14 years. Linux distro packages for an app have been a source of pain for me as an app developer. Shotcut is an experiment in an alternative delivery method. There are some places in the source that locate things like resources and command line executables relative to the location of the Shotcut executable. In addition, if you do not give the users all of the features that my Shotcut binary provides and at roughly same versions (in some dependencies, other dependencies such as Qt have more rigid version requirement of 5.2.x), then you should not call it Shotcut and consider not packaging it. Shotcut is more than its source code repo. It is a managed, downloadable binary that attempts to put all of the users and developers on the same page. If this goes back to the old way of people running different, mostly old versions with different, mostly old versions of dependencies including sometimes from alternative repos, then I am just going to quit working on this. Also, what good is it for me and the user if I fix a bug, it takes 3 - 6 months to go into a release, it takes another 3 - 6 months for the distro to package, and it takes another 3 - 6 months for the user to upgrade their distro? Most users do not compile their self anymore. The developer does not get timely confirmation, and the user does not get a timely fix.\n. The AUR package basically just uses the Shotcut binary download and system installs the launch icon. Another reputable Arch user reproduces the problem.\n. please test this on the command line:\ncd /opt/shotcut/\nsource source-me\nNow your environment/path is setup to use the same \"bundle\" environment that shotcut uses. Make test transcodes.\nffmpeg -i some-file -strict -2 test-ffmpeg.mp4\nmelt some-file -consumer avformat:test-melt.mp4 properties=x264-medium\nNow, try to play each of them:\nffplay test-ffmpeg.mp4\nffplay test-melt.mp4\nOh, and cleanup:\nrm test-ffmpeg.mp4 test-melt.mp4\nThanks\n. Hi, I finally reproduced the problem on my main non-Arch system. I am working on a fix.\n. It was a coding error in a change to use relative paths in the XML project file as much as possible (to make projects more portable). When generating the XML for encoding, it was creating invalid paths to the clips resulting in only the background (black silence) showing.\n. Tomorrow, I am going to check tonight's build with the fix and then update the downloads if OK. \n. https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/releases/download/v14.12/shotcut-debian7-x86_64-141212.tar.bz2\nOr change pkgver to 141212 in your PKGBUILD and rebuild your AUR pkg.\n. Yes, I found it and fixed it. During my code search and subsequent refactoring, the bug was limited to that one operation (split) that called the function a little different than every other call. I am not going to upload a new build for that one bug fix (limited to using split on Linux). It will have to wait for the 15.01 release. However, tomorrow I will post a link to download the new nightly build in this bug report.\n. http://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-debian7-x86_64-141214.tar.bz2\n. The only workaround at the moment is to create a 1024x576 16:9 project that uses square pixels, encode to lossless or near lossless, and then transcode that to whatever else is needed.\n. Thank you for trying to help, but translation changes must go through transifex.com, and I am not involved with making them or coordinating changes.\n. Unable to reproduce.\n. Next version does not autoplay multitrack and playlist .mlt files. That might affect this, but I will try to repro with this new info. Thanks\n. > I'll upload the 3 files\n\nplease don't. I am not offering to give this the level of attention you\nmay be expecting.\n. This bug report linked below explains how the bug is related to Mesa and libxcb and fixed in libxcb v1.11. Some distro packages may have back-ported the fix to an earlier version. Lots of good links in that bug report to learn more.\nhttps://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/386\n\nI use nvidia GL, which explains why I never saw this bug. Closing this as \"not my bug.\"\n. no thanks\n. Are you willing and able to make the code changes to fix these problems?\n. P.S. The transition settings are greyed out when Dissolve is selected, but the dark theme does not show that well. I think on the dark theme perhaps disabled things actually may need to be lightened because it is hard to see darker than dark. Unfortunately, we do not have control over the disabled color through the GUI library.\n. There is an OpenGL compatibility problem on your system. Are you using the AMD Catalyst driver? That is known to be incompatible. At the command line, run glxinfo | grep OpenGL and report the results here.\n. Related to #23. In earlier versions of Shotcut, the compatibility problem was limited to certain functions. I think since v14.09, when I added the on-screen controls capability (VUI), it broke all compatibility for AMD Catalyst on Linux. The developers do not currently have machines with AMD running Linux. I will buy a card soon with the donations received.\n. Needs to be retested on v15.09.\n. To be clear, we would like the bug reporter to re-test and confirm resolution.\n. Works for me now.\n. I just now noticed your updates as I did not receive email notification.\nI was fine with not using Q_UNUSED for the mvcp code as that code is forked and the change could be applied to the original, non-Qt branch. However, for the remainder of the Qt-based code, we have already been using Q_UNUSED (but not thoroughly as you noticed). I would like to be consistent. At this time, I prefer non-mvcp code use the Q_UNUSED macro. Is there a reason you chose not to use it?\n. Why did you close the pull request? Maybe you misunderstood my last comment. It was only regarding the change to src/src.pro, not all of the changes. I will merge your commits, squash them, and amend the result while still giving you credit.\n. We do not accept enhancement requests. This tracker is for defects only.\n. Yes! P.S. The track heights are saved with a project XML. It should be fairly easy to also save to/restore from settings for app session.\n. We do not accept enhancement requests. \n. Thanks, @metellius. After the 15.04 release in a day or two, I will add test these changes on all platforms and then extend some of the changes to the other platform code paths where applicable.\n. This is somewhat a duplicate of #54 - some OpenGL compatibility bug.\n. It works with more than nvidia. I can successfully use it in a virtual machine as well as with AMD open source driver, but I do not have a bunch of machines in lab with a testing staff, and Shotcut does not collect usage stats on its users. There are several thousand Linux downloads per month, and quite likely the successful users are not all on nvidia. If there was an easy fix, it would be done, obviously. A patch is welcome. We are working on a change to allow us to upgrade to a newer version of Qt in the near future, and I hope that helps.\n. Thank you for returning to this. I think commit eff1bb6e585494df86dd487e14e3cd90d6040741 fixed it for you. \n. I am going on holiday for a week starting tomorrow and unable to test this until I return. In the meantime, please make sure your changes work correctly with undo and redo. Otherwise, I do not object to anything from the description provided.\n. Do not be discourage by my comments. There are many nice things in here. Also, please add a comment header to the top of new files. Thanks\n. Regarding the comment header, yes, but use \"2015\" instead of \"2013-2014\" for the date since the file was added in 2015. When I modify a file, I try to remember to bump up the year if needed. I do not make a pass across the entire code base on new years day. Usually, I am trying to enjoy my holiday. :-)\n. Another regression is that shift plus mouse-x over timeline no longer skims (scrubs) the player.\n. Something is eating clicks on the blank areas of the timeline and timeline ruler and as result not seeking as expected. Drags work, but not single-clicks. \n. About currentTrack, currentClipTrack, and resetting selection upon changing current track; I initially reacted to the change in behavior. Now, I am wondering if there is much value in keeping that behavior. I guess it's not that important, and we just need to take care of the actions in TimelineToolbar.qml to use currentTrack and selection to prevent triggering asserts.\n. I accepted the behavior change with respect to and clip selection and current track, fixed the toolbar action errors, fixed click-to-seek, and merged.\n.

But to be honest I'd like to ask: is the kind of\nbugs you have mainly been facing the kind that a nightly build bot will\ndiscover?\nMost of the build-related problems are detected by the MLT-MELT build.\nWouldn't it be more realistic to brace for impact when updating all\ndepencies, rather than never being quite sure if a buggy commit suddenly\npopped up as a part of that final build-shotcut.sh invocation that results\nin a final package?\nAnother thing that we lose is the ability to specify the branch/version in\nthe config script. It would be nice if you hadn't taken that out.\nIt doesn't sound like something I took out on purpose; what are you\nreferring to? Could you comment on it in the actually commit above? It\ndoesn't sound like something that would conflict too much with this\nproposal.\nPlease double-check this. We must be able to pin certain versions of\nprojects.\nI think the biggest advantage is getting complete certainty over what has\nchanged between two releases.\nAgreed\nI had this thought early on looking at build-shotcut.sh, but what\ntriggered this was this recent G+ post:\nhttps://plus.google.com/115512205788937968595/posts/1We16F8u2hG\nWhere the guy says that 15.04 crashes, but 15.03 works fine. The reply is\n\"There is very little that changed that could have caused this for you.\",\nbut how can you be sure of that without actually haven gone through all the\nrepositories, compared the git logs side by side to estimate what commits\nmight have made it into 15.04 and what didn't?\n\nFirst of all, \"very little\" is a subject claim. I formed that opinion based\non my review of the git logs from March for MLT and Shotcut and\nunderstanding those changes relative to other releases. Also, I know\nFFmpeg, another component in the critical path of this problem is pinned at\nv2.3. Sure, something may have creeped in from somewhere else I did not\nlook that has a strange side effect, but I am not willing to give my most\ndiligent analysis to every problem report, let alone ones I cannot\nreproduce. If you have a more accurate and complete list of commits, what\nare you going to do with that for this problem? I am not saying this\naccurate, comprehensive list of commits is not useful. I am just saying it\nwill not help me with this particular problem. I already have a hunch about\nthe problem, but I am not sure what to do with that.\n. This presents some workflow challenges. Because update-revs.sh:chdirToMatchingRepo() looks for git repos in ../.., it can only be run once you have first run build-shotcut.sh to create the source tree and run it from there. However, I do not tend to work out of the build script's source tree structure. Nevertheless, if I go to ~/shotcut/src/shotcut/scripts and run update-revs.sh, build-shotcut.sh now fails because shotcut's HEAD is ahead of origin. I have to set ACTION_GET_COMPILE_INSTALL=0 to proceed, but then I am not getting the new revs! I have to do some juggling to make things work. Also, the build server agents today start from a clean directory, fetch only build-shotcut.sh, and then run it. Thus, the suggestion to update-revs.sh && build-shotcut.sh will not work.\n. Brian, it does not have to be a frequently used workflow for it to be a workflow. The idea to use update-revs.sh on the nightly build nodes simply does not work. To run it only periodically as part of release process has complications when trying to confirm the build prior to pushing the commit it generates. The idea to only periodically update revisions does not work for me. I require a nightly build of MLT and Shotcut because I sometimes test these interim builds after some changes, which is more convenient than rolling my own build (my time is limited, I support all the platforms, and I am the lead). I will not have MLT and Shotcut pinned for any period longer than a day. Neither do I want a nightly commit to clutter the git history. Neither will I pin revs for some short period prior to release because Shotcut translations are committed on the last day to give translators enough time prior to release (English translation is updated one week end of month).\nI value agility and frequent releases more than the rigor of the repeatability of old things. Being able to download a previous build and run it is good enough for me at this time. It is not too difficult to review the git logs from relevant repos between releases. I don't want to keep going round and round discussing this. This is not really solving a problem for me.\n. To be honest, I was not sure of my stance until I had a chance to actually review it and try it out. It can be nice to pin versions of most dependencies except movit, webvfx, frei0r, mlt, and shotcut (pretty long list) - projects where I am fairly active. Then, other projects like x265 and libvpx VP9, which are still rapidly evolving, I do not want to ping and to take some risk there to give people the absolute latest. lame, ffmpeg, and swh-plugins are already pinned. That leaves vid.stab, liibepoxy, opus, and eigen. Maybe I'll just start manually managing those now.\nYes, I will consider a patch to create a git sha1 manifest. It could go into the src archive only or put into share/ of all archives. \n. This behavior will need to toggled on using an option in the timeline menu like \"Ripple all tracks\", which must be saved in Settings across sessions. It must be accompanied by also supporting ripple delete - both with support for undo and redo. One way to save state is by using MLT XML. Obviously, snap-shotting the entire multitrack and restoring it is gross and heavy, but maybe it is the only safe way to handle a complex operation. Otherwise, massive engineering may be required, which is likely to introduce bugs.\n. On Sun, Apr 12, 2015 at 1:37 PM, metellius notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThis behavior will need to toggled on using an option in the timeline menu\nlike \"Ripple all tracks\"\nOf course, but asking out of curiosity: when would you want to\nintentionally offset one tracks from the other ones?\n\nI have been uncertain about which way to go on this, but I have been\nthinking about it for a while. I was leaning towards an option because it\nis different than what we do today and because some beginners will get an\nunexpected behavior. However, it can also be argued that today's behavior\nis unexpected for a beginner, but I tend to disagree. I suppose one idea is\nthat a beginner will create unexpected damage, and they generally prefer\nthe footprint of that damage to be smaller than larger. Also, we do not\nneed to cater entirely to beginners, but it might be nice to be\nconsiderate. Feedback welcome.\n\nIt must be accompanied by also supporting ripple delete\nOnly because of having \"ripple all tracks\" as a separate option right? Or\nis there any other reason why it's a must?\n\nThey logically belong together, but they do not need to be in the same\ncommit. I just want someone to commit to doing delete soon after doing it\nfor insert, preferably for the same release. OK, I will skip this\nrequirement because if you don't get around to it, I will.\n. About the use case for not wanting to ripple all tracks. It is common to add a music bed track with one ore more and then later to insert some other footage on the main video track. You do not want to split and shift the music. It can be argued to use a separate video track for B-roll cut-aways, but that is a technique that is not always obvious to people. Same thing could apply if someone makes a video track to composite a graphic across the entire video.\nAlso, if we do not offer to disable ripple all tracks, then we should have a join operation, but a join function should probably check that producers are equivalent (otherwise, it is should be grouped if we had that function). Also, we would need to figure out a policy for how to handle the filters attached to each producer (drop the second producer's filters and use only first producer's?).\nIf we add an option, should it be in the timeline menu or toolbar? I am leaning towards the menu.\n. Thanks @tin2tin. We are already very familiar with Kdenlive. Within Shotcut code base, grouping is actually more difficult/work than ripple on all tracks, and with this commit someone has actually contributed code for it. However, your message does remind me that I wanted to add track locking in conjunction with this feature.\n. I just realized we already have a ripple toggle button for the toolbar. I will not have 2 similar looking and sounding ripple buttons! I am sorry I led you astray by telling you to add a button. Let me think about if all ripple operations should be toggled by this single button, or whether drop should have its own insert/overwrite mode switch. Feel free to think about that too and comment.\n. I will reconsider the option to always ripple all unlocked tracks. In the meantime, here is what I am thinking. Solo is mainly used for audio, even in video editors. I was thinking of adding a solo function, but I don't want to add another button to the track header. I was thinking of making a shift-click on mute, mute all other tracks (and unmute clicked track if muted). We can do the same for the lock button.\nNext, regarding the ripple buttons, they really are different ripple toggles. However, I find that for the drop operation, one often needs to change the mode while in the middle of dragging (and seeing the words Overwrite or Insert appear). We can remove the ripple-drop toggle from the toolbar and instead let a keyboard modifier change the drop behavior. People are used to this when dragging an icon in a file manager to choose between copy and move. Then, the existing ripple icon would be repurposed for the ripple-all-tracks toggle. Alternatively, the ripple button toggles a more global ripple option that affects a consolidated insert/overwrite, a consolidated remove/lift, drag-n-drop, and ripple all tracks.\n. I did some testing of the undo behavior, and I ran into some problems, but I verified at least one of these is an old bug in the current release. This cross-checking takes time, and I need to give it more testing. Also, I need to study more the UndoHelper because I need to really want to understand it now instead of later.\n. That option would not require a keyboard modifier for the drop operation because the operation would be determined by the state of the ripple toggle. However, a keyboard modifier could be added as a convenient override.\n. If you feel stalled while I continue to review the undoHelper and decide what to do about ripple toggle, then you can fix the track lock feature to suppress all actions. The new auto-select, keyboard shortcuts, and toolbar buttons are still able to affect locked tracks.\n. I have refactored UndoHelper and fixed the memory leaks for both UndoHelper and Mlt objects in my working copy. No need for you to do it.\nI have also decided on the ripple all tracks toggle button based on a review of some other tools. I am going to remove it, there will be no toggle for ripple all tracks, and instead ripple will affect all unlocked tracks. The existing remove, lift, insert, overwrite buttons will not be consolidated and toggled based on the state of the existing ripple button. When ripple support is added to trimming and moving clips, then the existing ripple button will toggle their behavior.\n. Portions of this have been merged now plus my fixes and changes on top. You should review my commits to see what I did.\n. Unable to reproduce with my own MLT XML files created by Shotcut (as I see yours have been tagged with the shotcut=1 property). I have not taken the time to try with yours and manually relinking media. In any case, it is not possible in the the design of Shotcut and latest 16.01 version to drag a project file to the playlist unless you choose File > Open MLT XML As Clip to open it. Otherwise, dropping a project file opens the file as a project. If I do that (Open MLT XML As Clip) and add it to the playlist, then it does not crash for me.\nThis needs testing on the latest version and steps to reproduce as the steps here cannot be followed.\n. Fixed in 1c5873f7b87b52ac0e0a841abfd940c636544b18\n. Do not use the title property. The reason why the xml consumer generates it is a little complicated story and not important to discuss here. I want this label invisible when a producer other than a track head is selected. I definitely like something that says \"Nothing selected,\" and it is educational to say \"Track: ____\" when a track head is selected. However, I do not want to display the name of the producer and its resource here. We show that in the properties panel, playlist item, and timeline shot. We don't need to repeat it everywhere possible! Therefore, ignore the title property and set the QML visible property based on empty string.\n. shotcut:name, which you are already checking, is only used for tracks.\n. I do not reproduce this. Please provide more details including OS, where you got Shotcut, whether GPU processing is enabled, and some steps.\n. If you double-click a filter or click its checkbox in the filter list, then it toggles whether the filter is enabled. But I am closing this so no further information is provided and not clear how to reproduce.\n. I have not been able to reproduce this on Linux or OS X.\n. 15.05.02 was the buggy version. It is 15.05.06 that is the re-release version number. If that is not the problem, if it is a more subtle drift, then please provide some information on the source file formats you are using and how you obtained them (e.g. camera model, created by software X). Also, please let us know how you encoded it and what player you used to check the result. \n. OK, yeah, that is really bad. It would be great if you can zip up a small project exhibiting the problem including the source mkvs, .mlt project file, and your encoded output; and upload it to http://www.shotcut.org/bin/view/Shotcut/SupportUpload\n. No, you cannot upload something that big. There might be something funky happening with the muxed (combined) audio/video parsing. To workaround the problem, you might try to separate the source audio as a WAV file and muting the video track. To help try to reproduce the bug, it would be nice if you can send the output of 'mediainfo your.mkv' or 'ffprobe your.mkv' or 'melt your.mkv -consumer xml' Thanks\n. Also, do the long source files stay in sync when simply played in Shotcut? Try seeking halfway into the file, let it play for 15 minutes, and then assess the sync. Then, do the same in the Videos app.\n. If the a/v sync is out immediately after seeking, then the file is not suitable for editing. Video editing requires frame accuracy. I installed guvcview to see how the file is created, and I see from mediainfo that it created a variable framerate file, which is not supported by Shotcut or most video editors for that matter. I hate it when tools like this or screen capture programs record in odd ways (sometimes just by default) that only really works well in a video player and not a video editor. Therefore, you must convert the file to something else to use it for editing. What to convert it to and what tool? There are so many options. I tried using Shotcut for my test, but my webcam only provides 5 fps video making it difficult to judge. In any case you can try this:\n1. Start Shotcut without a project or clip loaded.\n2. Change Settings > Video mode to Automatic if not already.\n3. Open the MKV file.\n4. Click Encode on the main toolbar.\n5. Choose the preset lossless/ProRes\n6. Click Encode File.\n7. Give it a name and click OK.\n8. Wait for the job to finish.\n9. Double-click the finished job to open in the Shotcut player.\n10. See if it works better.\nAlso, for working with a separate audio file on an audio track, you can turn off snapping using the button on the timeline toolbar to allow for more fine adjustment.\n. Shortcuts c, v, & b (append, insert, overwrite) are not blocked.\n. This bug tracker is for defect tracking only, and this is an enhancement request that I disagree with. I don't want Linux users to suffer with software that is a year or more old. As the developer, I don't want to deal with users reporting problems with software that is a year old and have little hope of getting a fix in the near term. As the developer, I don't want to deal with a hundred different configurations of the software for all the different distributions - not to mention the packages people have installed from alternative repos. I don't want to make users have to suffer as a result of the developers having to deal with that. I want developers and users to easily have multiple versions of Shotcut to make it easier to compare behaviors and track regressions.\nSo, the answer is no. Don't even bother to counter-argue. I've already made up my mind after dealing with that kind of bullshit for a decade in the 2000s. That is the way it is for now and the foreseeable future. Don't like it? Then go use some other video editor in your package repo. \n. It will only go into the Linux  builds as currently authored. Is that OK? It would not be going into the src archive posted with all releases either.\n. With some changes to the text output, it could be TWiki or Markdown syntax. If TWiki, it has potential to be added to the website more easily or possibly automated in the future.\n. OK, I will merge it as it will be nice to include this version tracking, and we can improve on it later as desired.\n. This is largely because property animation is not yet in Shotcut. However, we do claim to support the notion of time in webvfx (see howto). Until animation is properly integrated and this gets rewritten, we can add a test here for mlt_service=webvfx.\n. Check the property mlt_service=webvfx as I asked previously. Do not add objectName to overlay HTML filter as that is the fallback for any webvfx-based filter that does qualify itself with a \"shotcut:filter\"\n. sorry, re-opened\n. You are on your own if not using our supplied binaries. \n. Sorry to reject this, but the change that broke it was really just a work around a bug in Qt that is fixed in newer releases. I am opposed to band-aids on band-aids. Soon, we will upgrade Qt, and we can revert the previous change and not resort to this ugliness.\n. Shotcut statically links CuteLogger. The install target for this sub-project should be removed.\n. It was already prevented when dragging left. There was an unchecked condition for dragging right.\n. I do not reproduce this on my OS X 10.6, 10.8, or 10.10 machines. In a couple months - when we upgrade the version of Qt we use - we are dropping support for 10.6 and 10.7: https://blog.qt.io/blog/2015/05/15/qt-5-5-beta-released/\n. I know about this problem, and I have experienced it before. We use SDL for audio output, and it might be something weird in SDL and OS X versions. I do not reproduce this on my OS X 10.8 or 10.10 machines. In a couple months - when we upgrade the version of Qt we use - we are dropping support for 10.6 and 10.7: https://blog.qt.io/blog/2015/05/15/qt-5-5-beta-released/\n. Am I correct to understand that does not yet modify any operations to handle multi-selection? I am very busy and might take me a while to get around to reviewing this. I have not decided that I actually want to introduce this. Before going much further, please pause to give some thought about the use-cases for multi-select and possibly document them. What are some tricky things that arise? For example, think about moving multiple clips. How does it complicate the implementation for QUndoCommands? Seems like this is likely to make things complicated and difficult to keep bug-free.\n. I can reproduce this on 15.06, but not git master HEAD as of today. Maybe it was fixed with the fix for #86?\n. We use transifex to coordinate translations. Please create an account there and request to make a Greek translation for the project: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/shotcut/\nWhen you have translated at least 80% of the strings, I will add it to the next monthly release. Thank you\n. Shotcut is only developed, tested, and supported on Qt 5.2 at this time. We hope to move onto Qt 5.5 next as that includes a bug-fix we provided. Looking at your messages, Shotcut makes heavy usage of Qt Quick, which uses OpenGL, and it appears to be a problem between Qt and nouveau. There are not even any Shotcut functions in that backtrace! Closing this as not-my-bug and not a supported version.\nPlease feel free to debug it further on your own. In particular, you could try building and running some Qt Quick examples from Qt Creator or SDK to see how stable they are on your system w/ nouveau. However, bear in mind that Shotcut uses a combination of Qt Widgets (traditional GUI), Qt Quick, and some custom GL code for the video display. That is a supported combination, but it is not well represented in the examples collection.\n. Shotcut is incompatible with your system. You need to upgrade your video card, GPU, and/or its driver. More info here:\nhttp://www.shotcut.org/bin/view/Shotcut/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#Why_does_it_crash_on_Windows_upo\nThis is a bug-tracker - not a help or support system - and this is not a bug and will not be fixing it. However, the situation might change in a few months when we try to make a version less dependent upon OpenGL, and you can try again in a few months.\n. You are probably basing this observation on the UI preview. The UI preview runs uses Settings > Interpolation, which defaults to nearest neighbor (no interpolation) for speed. When you encode, it defaults to bilinear, and you have to enter something special in the Other tab of the encode settings to change it. I just ran a test with debug logging to verify it is still working correctly.\n. Font size is controlled only by the on-screen rectangle control. The font dialog is controlled by the operating system/environment.\n. I reproduced it on OS X, but I can also workaround it by resizing slightly.\n. @petrica-celrau You are seeing a bug in the Text filter UI in v15.09 that was fixed in v15.10. And yes, a translucent gray background is the default that you are free to change as you noticed.\n. We do not use this for feature requests - defect tracking only.\n. I do not accept feature requests.\n. Just make your webvfx-based filter a separate filter. I don't want to make generic things like this.\n. Create a folder in share/shotcut/qml/filters containing metadata and UI QML files.\n. Yes, that is in the install folder. I don't care if you have to do a little work for your custom, non-shared filters. But, you can submit a patch that looks in an additional location.\nNow, the other use case you raise is to add parameters to HTML that is fairly specific to the project. That is getting rather esoteric, and you are likely the only one who will use it. I believe many people do not use the HTML filter not realizing an editor is provided or simply unsure about what it is and how to use it. In any case, I can see from the video, this implementation is not good enough to merge. I guess we should discuss whether it has a chance to be merged to help you decide whether to continue working on it.\nFrom the video, it looks like the user needs to know the names of their custom properties and enter them instead of having the UI present them. We know that with webvfx, JavaScript cannot set a MLT property to be read by this filter UI. One idea is to extend webvfx to support that. Then, you could read the property names to present a better UI or even define a QML property that contains the UI. Without that, how about a convention to look for a file with the same name but ending with .qml? That QML could define either a complete UI or, for a more lightweight solution, a special QML property name containing the MLT property names. If you just want to continue on the current direction, then for the UI why not a 3 column table with a delete column and always an empty row to add the next?\nI have been thinking about a way to extend the HTML editor to work with the forthcoming keyframes timeline. It would be nice in the editor to select something, give it an id, and then the editor adds webvfx code to look for a property with the same name as its id. The generated code's render function will get the element by id and set its value from the property. The editor could inform the keyframes UI about the property when the id is set; however, what about when loading an existing file? It should generate some code that can set a special MLT property containing information about the animatable properties. There is some crossover here.\n. I get the impression from some comments that some people are confused about this filter, in general. I will add some very brief text that lets the user know that Shotcut includes a HTML editor, but they need to click New and create a file name to get started. Along with that text, I will include a link to the HowTo section of the site, and we can add a page about this feature. How does that sound?\nI can give you a wiki account to create and edit the page, but not only must you learn the ways of this wiki but you must remember to only access it as https://shotcut.org/ to workaround the CDN. Alternatively, you can just draft something somewhere else, and I will convert it. You can include screenshots.\n. When it comes to writing your article, please remember this page exists:\nhttp://www.mltframework.org/doxygen/webvfx/effects_authoring.html\nYou might want to link to that page for more info except I have not been able to get the toImageData() to work. I worked at one point on Qt 4.7, I think, but I think it broke at some point in QtWebKitBridget. Maybe, I'm wrong: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-38809\n. I don't care too much about it. So, if you want it fixed send a pull request or patch or clearly show the changes. \n. This is by design. This type of crop is not really intended for composting. It is intended for removing bad edges and dealing with mismatch aspect ratios. You are asking for a different type of crop, and I understand the request, but I don't take feature requests.\n. This is fixed in v15.09, just tested to confirm it. You must have GPU processing disabled in Settings, and the new Settings option Display Method must be Automatic or DirectX.\n. Thanks, but I think perhaps we only want to do this when GPU processing is enabled. Is it possible to do this \"if (Settings.playerGPU())\" after constructing the Application object on line 207?\n. Github automatically closes issues when they are referenced in a git commit message, and we just roll with that instead of waiting until next release to mark issues as closed.\nAnother workaround is to switch to the video or audio filter list, close the filter menu, and then click + to re-open the filter menu.\n. This is probably a compatibility issue with your video driver and Qt 5.2, possibly our use of their Quick views. We hope to upgrade to Qt 5.5 for the 15.09 release early September, and we'll have you try again then. Otherwise, I don't reproduce this problem, and I don't have a similarly equipped system to test and verify if 5.5 resolves it.\n. Needs to be re-tested on 15.09.\n. To be clear, I want the bug reporter to re-test on 15.09 since I am not able to reproduce it. \n. @mxa Please confirm you are using Shotcut 15.09 for Linux. \n. Sorry but there is nothing I can do about this. It is a limitation of that integrated GPU's OpenGL , and this part of Qt requires OpenGL. If you can provide more information about that GPU, then at least we have that information to deal with future duplicate reports.\n. Please indicate which OS, its version, and version of Shotcut.\n. Unable to reproduce on Ubuntu 14.04.2. I doubt there is any difference on newer Ubuntu. \nIs the problem repeatable for you? If so, provide steps because I did something based on the brief description.\n. I reproduced this only on Windows and when using still images.\n. I removed your free.fr links because the behavior of that web site is offensive. We don't need your original files. If you have a screencast, use a video service (e.g. YouTube) to share it.\n. I do not reproduce this. It sounds like a compatibility problem with the video/gpu driver. Please provide the following information:\n1.) What is the version of OS? 32- or 64-bit?\n2.) What is the version of Shotcut? 32- or 64-bit?\n3.) Where did you get Shotcut?\n4.) Paste the output of the following terminal window command: glxinfo | grep OpenGL\n. fixed in 000e98841eb4880ec3d1e39630125e15780733e5\nand in the new v16.06.08 download\n. I merged 3 of these commits tonight, and I am about to merge qt5.5 into master.\n. I am reviewing the modifiers for new shortcuts. Take an overview look at all them today:\nhttp://www.shotcut.org/bin/view/Shotcut/KeyboardShortcuts\nI have been using Shift variants of some to target the playlist and Timeline tends to use Ctrl. Perhaps regardless of this pull request, Playlist Ctrl+Up/Down should be changed to Shift. Perhaps your new Shift+I/O/U changed to Ctrl. Hmm, no, that will not work. :-) Ctrl+O and Ctrl+U are already taken. Playlist uses Shift+B for update. Perhaps Alt+B can be used for Timeline. It is, after all, a variant of Overwrite. In that case, Alt+I/O for timeline trimming? However, I am not highly opposed to Shift for them - just thinking. At some point, we will want shortcuts to seek in/out in the Source player. Final Cut and Premiere uses Shift for that, while Avid uses Alt. We do tends towards Avid on shortcuts.\n. Never mind about the shortcuts. I decided to leave them as you have it.\n. Shift+U needs to request audio levels update.\n. Can you please add a checkmark icon - same one as used in PlaylistDock - to the timeline toolbar to trigger the update action? Put it between Overwrite and Split. And add a corresponding context menu action to Clip to trigger it as well. These should be disabled when the action is not applicable.\n. On Sun, Oct 18, 2015 at 1:58 PM metellius notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThe update action isn't a part of this pr because i haven't spent much time\ntrying it out, but if you feel it should be i guess i can do that.\n\nOops. No, this is all we should include for this pull request. If you want\nto continue to work on update in a separate branch and submit it, then feel\nfree.\n. This is not working on Windows. It actually makes it crash. It is at least in part due to the new signal/slot connect syntax you are using. That does not work in our Windows builds. I do not know if it is related to using MinGW or what.  In any case you will see that we are generally not using it. It gives errors in debug log such as \"signal not found in QQuickView.\" Then, if you do not make it declare the slots as \"private slots:\" it will give errors such as \"No such slot.\" After making those changes, I get a link error: \"undefined reference to vtable.\" Adding a Q_OBJECT macro alone did not help. I had to split declare the class in the header and include the macro. After doing all that and throwing in some qDebugs, not only does it no longer crash here, but I confirm that it is actually doing its job \n. Also works for me on Linux and OS X.\n. Does your download file name include \"150911\"?\nShotcut requires OpenGL on Linux. Please provide the output of \"glxinfo | grep OpenGL\".\n. Also, in a console window, please:\ncd path/to/Shotcut/Shotcut.app\nsource source-me\nldd lib/qt5/platforms/libqxcb.so\n. reproduced by /dev/harald, who is looking into this.\n. On my machine at home I use NVIDIA proprietary driver with no problem. I am now reproducing this in a Fedora 21 VirtualBox VM that uses Mesa+llvmpipe. What is interesting is that other VMs running Manjaro and Ubuntu 12.04 also using mesa+llvmpipe are not reproducing it.\n. A new build is running now; should be ready in less than an hour.\n(This ticket closes automatically when I reference it in a commit message.)\n. The new download is ready. Please retry.\n. I think it is due to your Windows region setting using a comma for the decimal separator. We have known issues with that, but no one has volunteered to help fix it so far. \n. Give the Settings > Video Mode, and then the steps including details of what you do in the Encode panel.\n. Fixed in MLT: https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/5adccf1485307719d897f15eb5add51079618c0e\nI will close on the next release, which will include this.\n. It does appear to be a 32-bit issue, but our nightly 32-bit builds have been working without this patch. I think it may depend on the OS you use to run it. I do not want to change the build script to start patching things (adds more complexity to an already very complex script). The way I handle something like this is to fork it onto GitHub, patch it, and point the build script there. However, I only am willing to do this for things affecting our builds. Unlike the mlt and melted build scripts, which are designed for general use by all, the shotcut build script is really intended only for my build nodes due to the complexity of supporting multiple operating systems. Therefore, I will not be forking lame to maintain this patch. As a result, I am closing this as it is not a shotcut functional defect and not something I intend to act upon (or even merge a patch to build-shotcut.sh and therefore inherit).\n. Yes, the web site does say 64-bit only right on the release blog post on the home page and on the download page.\n. We only accept problem reports from the builds that we provide. Since we no longer provide 32-bit builds, then, no, do not report problems made on your own 32-bit build - unless you are a developer and accompany that report with a patch for review or comment.\n. I might consider switching to this git repo for lame since it appears to be an actively maintained alternative: https://github.com/rbrito/lame\nIt does not have your exact patch, but I see something else matching \"xmmintrin\" in configure that might accomplish the same thing.\n@firew4lker please change the script to use git as the source type and to use the above git repo and test it. If you still have a problem, you could submit your patch to the github project, and then I am willing to change build-shotcut.sh to use it.\n. Does your install have a Shotcut.app/lib/qt5/xcbglintegrations/libqxcb-glx-integration.so file?\nIf not, then you need to re-download and re-install. There was a short-term packaging error.\nAre you using the launcher script Shotcut.app/shotcut or trying to execute Shotcut.app/bin/shotcut directly? If the bin, you are doing it wrong.\n. Does it look like some kind of concurrency problem around the database to\nyou too?\n. A database is used because it is a cache to prevent consuming disk space without limit and because there is no cross-platform way to sort a directory by access time.\n. This is not implemented, this is not a bug, and we do not take feature requests.\n. Read the web site. I don't need a policy, and I do not work for you. The only \"feature requests\" I accept are patches or pull requests.\n. Nice; write-back caching!\n. Translations must be fixed on transifex.com:\nhttps://www.transifex.com/ddennedy/shotcut/\nPlease create an account there and request to join the team and make the fix. Thanks!\n. Specifically, this affects audio tracks. Since there is a border, scaling them will them tiny and illegible. Also, we might be moving these to icons.\n. The minimum height of audio tracks was increased by 10 pixels.\n. I too have made attempts at converting to qquickwidgets but have run into problems. I do not recall specifics, but I have a branch I could push.\n. Yours and mine (https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/commit/53f5aaf0514be9a83ba2739f9907faa8572d65c4) are very similar, except I started with filter dock, and it is very broken.\n. I added your suggestion; that helped. And, I unbroke some things. See the tip of the branch if it helps: https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/commits/quickWidgets\nNow, the filter panel displays but clicking + does nothing.\n. In my working copy of danQuickWidget branch, I made some fixes to vertical position of timeline menu and auto-closing the filter menu. However, there are problems with GLWidget. I did rather straight-forward conversion of it to QQuickWidget, but currently it deadlocks.\n. Great, now with all of these changes, I just need to test it good across all 3 platforms. All this just to fix a little text entry issue. Sigh. Did I mention yet how Movit HEAD changed a lot recently causing breakage on OS X and potentially how GL is used in Shotcut? So, yeah, it feels a lot like wheels spinning in mud lately.\n. This ready for testing on all OSes now?\n. merged your quickWidgets branch\n. I have intermittently reproduced the problem, and I think it is related to multi-threaded rendering.\n@CraftedCart and @metellius Please make this test to see if it removes the problem for you. In Encode > Other, add on a line by itself \"real_time=-1\" (that is a negative one). \n. When I do not add real_time=-1 and do not exactly reproduce the problem, usually the text flickers between left and center.\n. Fixed in MLT for next release. https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/3797206319324e34b4211d7212b4089efa5c12dd\n. Yes. See MLT and its companion utility melt on http://www.mltframework.org\nShotcut comes with a melt utility. This tracker is for defect tracking only related to Shotcut. Questions about MLT are done through StackExchange.\n. OK, but please remember that GPU is clearly marked experimental for a reason.\n. I was able to reproduce this on Windows 10 and Linux - not yet tested OS X, but probably fails there too. It was intermittent, and I could more easily trigger it by resizing/repositioning the text. And, other times the text does not render, but interestingly the background color may.\n. Another data point: the problem is reproducible on v15.08 as well, the version before Qt and Movit upgrades that could have affected this. Also, tested on v14.12 where it crashes as well. Both of those tests were on Linux.\n. I might have been fixed with this recent MLT commit mlt/mltframework@3797206319324e34b4211d7212b4089efa5c12dd as I am not reproducing it in my working copy against MLT master. I will have to test a nightly build on Windows as well.\n. As of v17.10, the Text filter is disabled and marked as incompatible with GPU processing. There's your new for you unless you have a patch to contribute.. Closing because GPU Effects is unsupported without a patch/pull request. Next version 18.11 makes this more obvious.. Windows XP is not supported.\n. What is the Shotcut version, where did you get it, and how did you start it? Shotcut does not use your system Qt libraries; it supplies its own. Except, version 15.11.01 was shipped with a missing library, and that is being fixed now.\n. I did a quick test of this new release candidate. It would be great if someone else can check it:\nhttp://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-debian7-x86_64-151102.tar.bz2\n. new version uploaded and link changed on download page.\n. I reproduced it, but I can also tell you that Shotcut does not work that way. There is no function to select part of a clip and remove that part. You can only select part of a clip and add it to the timeline (or playlist). In case you do not like that - oh well - think positive - focus on what you want instead of what you do not want. Buttons on the timeline toolbar only affect the timeline. The '-' button removes the a selected clip on the timline, but you had an empty timeline.\n. Make separate issues, please, and indicate what your OS.\nFor now, commenting on only the first one, I have not been able to reproduce it, or it is by design. Maybe it needs a better explanation. If you have clips with a gap between them, then dragging the in point left green edge is suppose to leave the clip in its place. It increases the length by adjusting the clip's in point.\n. I understand it now and reproduced the problem.\nRegarding \"one more thing\" there are some things around adjusting and editing transitions and its neighbors that are simply not implemented yet. I have been leaving some work like that open to give to new volunteers.\n. This is fixed in git commit 20feb1a. It was a regression I introduced in v15.11 while trying to make a minor improvement.\n. I reproduce it. Even if I hard code a string like \"T\u00e9l\u00e9chargements\" in the JavaScript of the HTML file, it fails. It also affects the Overlay HTML filter.\n. Hey, that's a great find! I have tested it here, and it works. I am using the form presented here:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Introduction_to_HTML5\n. In the meantime, you can simply edit your file at Shotcut.app/share/shotcut/qml/filters/webvfx_threejs_text/threejs_text.html\n. Brian, there is no easy way to do this. This list of suggested extensions is in libavformat, and I do not want to add this to the MLT avformat consumer or Shotcut. All I can suggest is that choosing a format explicitly (not using a preset), would clear the extension recommended by Shotcut.\n. I do not reproduce your problems. It seems like Shotcut is incompatible with your computer and drivers. That is the way it goes sometimes. I am not going to do anything about it.\n. @jmcgvr That is not the same bug. You can open a new issue to track your problem, but be prepared to share a short project that reproduces it or the steps to reproduce it from scratch (empty project). I already tried to reproduce it on Windows 7 with no success so far.\n. works for me\n. Thanks, Brian. I updated the page. Takes up to 48 hours to update cache.\n. This was added to the forum page. You can see it on un-cached version of the page here: http://shotcut.org/bin/view/Shotcut/DiscussionForum\nAccessing it through www. accesses a cache that will take up to 48 hours to update.\n. No features requests.\nOn Mon, Nov 23, 2015, 8:26 PM Iwan Gabovitch notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nThanks! What's your policy on feature requests? Is there a place for them\nor not?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/issues/145#issuecomment-159146341\n.\n. I am not keeping open bugs on general launch failures and system incompatibilities. It works for me and many others. I know it does not work for everybody. Either it works for you, or it doesn't, and maybe you will debug it or not.\n. There is no release with debugging symbols, and it is not trivial to setup a development environment for Shotcut especially on Windows:\nhttp://www.shotcut.org/bin/view/Shotcut/SetupWindowsDev\n\nYou do not need to use a specific version of Qt Creator (or that IDE), but you will need to configure a \"build kit\" to point to a specific compiler version and Qt SDK - not just any will do. The Shotcut SDK alone (not including Qt, MinGW, and Qt Creator) is 761 MB.\nIf you want to proceed, e-mail me for the Shotcut SDK download link. I will not post it here because I do not want to make it easy for just anyone to try, bug me with questions, make malware-infested knock-offs, etc. You can easily find my e-mail address in the comment headers of the source code.\n. See here:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/win32/win32.c#L69\nProbably cd is invalid pointer because encoding was not accepted, and iconv_close() does not handle invalid iconv_t. This function is only used by the function directly below it; so you can see what/how encoding is being passed. Certainly, I can add a check if \"cd\" is valid before iconv_close(). Then, I can give you a new build to test tomorrow. Look over mlt_properties_from_utf8() and let me know if you see something else suspicious for your locale and codepage.\n. I will change to use GetACP() and test \"cd\" before iconv_close() and give you a overnight build to test tomorrow. Re-opening since you are helping and this might be resolvable. Thanks\n. The purpose of this function is to convert UTF-8 strings as standardized by MLT to a filename that can be used by other libraries such as libavformat and libxml2 that expect file names to be in an encoding compatible with the Windows file system.\nsetlocale() as used here is only used to lookup the system locale - not to set it for the C lib functions.\n. Here is the MLT commit:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/a26deb7e15294ca40b17e5dab780da9d0f065ba9\nA new build will be available in about 12 hours.\n. make separate issues, please\n. This is resolved (first issue), and I am going to make a new release tomorrow that includes it. Closing this because there should only be one issue per issue.\n. Hmm.. yes. Why is that? Because it works from my dev copy launching it from the IDE.\n. I reproduced it on Windows and Linux.\n. Crashes in QTBUG47714WorkaroundRenderListener::afterSync() on delete oldTexture.\n. Fixed in 1dd6491.\nThe other linked commit 27f58a3 does not apply (commit message changed just after noticing the mistake.)\n. FYI, the last version where external screen works correctly - at least on OS X - is 15.10. It became broken on 15.11 (probably on change to use QQuickWidgets). Still, on 15.10, it also crashed when switching from Screen 1 to None. I have limited OS X resources to debug this at the moment; I had to borrow my daughter's computer to test. I will see if it reproduces on another OS.\n. I tested it on Windows, and it works much better than on OS X. At least, you can use the feature; it does render the video on the target display. However, when switching while a clip/project is already open, it may not render correctly until restarting. But at least it works, and it did not crash. On OS X, the feature no longer works at all.\n. The guard was added in that commit but was since changed, removed from startGlsl(), and added to initializeGL() in #ddc36018. The history is complicated now. I am not opposed to removing that guard check as long as it does not regress, and it needs testing on all platforms. That might take some time depending upon when I get another OS X machine and set it up. It should be noted that GL initialization does interplay with the createThread() method, which is used by a MLT event handler.\n. I have OS X dev machine with external display option again. I can confirm that the change metellius posted above does restore the ability to use an external monitor again. However, it still crashes as reported here. I tried to debug that, but I have not yet found anything I can do to remedy or workaround it.  After more testing of the change above on Windows, I am going to commit it to at least restore this functionality.\n. You are using 15.12.01, which has a known crashing bug when splitting, which is why we now have 15.12.03 on the downloads page. Please upgrade and report back.\n. Shotcut does not support relative paths that are not in the same folder as the .mlt file or a sub-folder.\n. It works for me and plenty of others. We are not going to address or fix \"it just crashes for me\" bug reports.\n. Feel free to try to debug it yourself and submit a patch or pull request.\n. I have no idea what the fuck you are talking about. IMO, this is invalid at \"Open mlt file that references a 1080i file.\" Describe the steps using only shotcut or this is closed. You are really getting annoying.\n. Yes, at this time, if you change Video Mode after something is open you need to reload. I will try to make a change to prevent people from getting cut on this rough edge.\n. Related to this, there is a major regression in v15.12 that causes the video mode to implicitly become automatic (not shown in UI) when the app starts up and you do not restore a crashed session.\n. The regression in v15.12 fixed in a1080d8.\n. This is by design. Some (most?) environments do not want ordinary users to be able to install Windows software because it can introduce problems. I know at times I did not give my children admin access to prevent exactly that.\nAs a workaround, an administrator can install it on one machine, zip the program folder, and copy it elsewhere. Then, just run shotcut.exe.\nI am not saying that there will never be a portable/zip distribution of Shotcut for Windows, but this is not a bug.\n. I ran into this by chance tonight on OS X, and it was very consistent and easy to reproduce. I remembered this bug report, and this fixed it for me.\n. Yet another solution is to just comment out/remove the call to delete oldTexture and just leak until we can upgrade Qt instead of this heavy change.\n. Moving UI elements from QML to C++ is counter to the goal of moving the project toward a C++ runtime and QML UI.\n. Per the e-mail I just sent out, the movement of UI code from QML to C++ is no longer antithetical. I will test this on all platforms. I am a little behind on OS X dev/test environment at the moment, and that might cause some delay.\n. > Yet another solution is to just comment out/remove the call to delete oldTexture and just leak \nAfter I saw how frequently that delete is called, and the object is wraps a GL texture; I did not like that solution.\nOK, here is a stack of the crash moving clips between tracks on Windows - deep in Qt. :(\n\n. Hey, the crash on Windows appears in master as well and is unrelated to the levels data being passed. It is just much easier to reproduce in the debugger. I was comparing the latest release running outside the debugger to this branch running in the debugger and misled. I think this is good after making the requested changes. I am not providing input on the naming discussion; what you guys decided is fine.\nLater today, I am getting an OS X machine and in should be ready for dev&test by the weekend.\n. I am only waiting on the renaming to pull this.\n. I found the bug in MLT due to some missing rounding. I expect to have that fixed today, and I can give you a new build of Shotcut tomorrow that includes the fix.\n. Fixed in git commit https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/6b518f5bf99bcd091398386311c75abf043bbea3\nI will add a link for nightly build tomorrow morning.\n. @paulbatum please test this\nhttp://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-win64-151217.exe\n. It has a lot of bugs, but not a lot people wanting to fix them. Closing this as resolved.\n. Unable to reproduce using v15.12.09 (unreleased, interim version) on Windows 7 with US/English region/language setting in Windows. I also just tested on v15.11 release on Windows with no problem. Specify your OS, OS version, and Shotcut version.\n. Are you able to recompile libmltxml.dll by doing make -C src/modules/xml all install?\nIf so, try to change line 244 of src/modules/xml/consumer_xml.c: from\nvalue = filter_restricted( mlt_properties_get_value( properties, i ) );\nto\nvalue = mlt_properties_get_value( properties, i );\n. Are you Jefferson Lee on G+? Yes, Shotcut dev and debug is not easy on Windows, but a prebuilt SDK provided by me makes it easier. It is generally much easier on Linux and OS X. Much of this difficulty is due to the large number of library dependencies.\nAs for the bug, as I recall, that char filter was primarily to deal with strings that were not known to be UTF-8 compliant being put into MLT properties. I think that was mainly from libavformat metadata strings (e.g., title) being passed directly from the media file with no regard to text encoding (probably it is unknown). Maybe I should only apply the filter to these metadata properties, which Shotcut does not currently serialize.\n. I noticed that file mxe-gcc-5.1.0-x64.tar.bz2 was missing in my S3 bucket. So, I uploaded it. The build script is in shotcut scripts/build-shotcut.sh. Run it with \"-o Win64\" to cross-compile; add \"-s\" to build the SDK, which includes the source trees with build.\n. Fixed in MLT https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/a71d66ea4a11301bee9fcc08a7c316a1f58bf23a\nI can give you a new build tomorrow from our nightly build server to confirm.\n. Give this a try:\nhttp://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-win64-151223.exe\n. I do not know anything about input software, but it must Qt-related. It could be a quirk with how we use QQuickWidget to host QML content in a QWidgets-based app. I suggest you experiment with a Qt sample app. There is one named \"Qt Quick Widgets Example\" that comes with Qt Creator.\n. 3D Text filter on v15.12.23?\n. Strange. I have no idea what could be causing that. What about Overlay HTML?\n. This might be a limitation of the fonts used by 3D Text. We use fonts supplied by the three.js text geometry example as created by typeface.js and facetype.js. Can you please test this by making a copy of that example modified to contain your characters, and view in a web browser?\n. The links to the x64 pre-built libraries are now listed at the bottom of this page: http://shotcut.org/bin/view/Shotcut/CrossCompile\n. No, when doing the Qt 5.5 upgrade, I could not get the 32-bit build to work after a few days of work. Then, I considered that the limited RAM usage of a 32-bit process is problematic anyways for HD editing, realized x86-64 has been out for 12 years, and decided to abandon 32-bit.\n. Not going to fix. This project is too complicated to try to address multiple versions of dependencies.\n. Yes, the locale defined decimal point is written into the file by design. Also, the top of the file declares the locale in the LC_NUMERIC attribute. To facilitate file sharing, at the MLT level, the intention is to interpret all values using the declared locale. However, in reality and within Shotcut, things get messy quickly when possibly operating in a mixed mode (values from one decimal point system used in the context of another decimal point system). As a result, the repair system tries to simplify things by converting the file to the current system. However, it is not able to convert all properties. It only attempts attributes or properties with names: in, out, length, geometry, and rect.\n. You are correct about a bug. There was an attempt to fix a bug for macOS in v17.01 that resulted in a regression for Linux and Windows and did not even work correctly on macOS. I reproduced the problem in your immediate reply above. Reverting the change fixes it for me using German for the region/language and English (period) for the numeric settings. If you want, you can test with v16.12 to check the behavior since that is what it is going back to essentially.\nRegarding shareable, I think your map is exaggeration. What does \"it\" specifically refer to? How does standardizing on period make it more shareable than comma? It depends on the software to support it.\nSome parts of the software needs to convert between strings and numbers, and some of this software is very deep within the engine. Other parts of the software like the UI needs to supports the local decimal point setting to match user expectation. Sometimes a numeric string value a user supplies may be delivered to the engine as string because the system for parameters is not strongly typed. So, the engine needs to understand the local decimal point setting to convert it correctly. In addition, the melt command line and XML authored manually are also interfaces that arguably ought to respect the local decimal point setting. It can be counter-argued that the XML should standardize on period per convention (see various programming languages and markups) and that XML reader/writer in MLT should always operate in that standard (what we call the \"C\" locale). I will think about that, but I have to check if it can be done safely in a cross-platform manner (without temporarily putting the entire process into a C locale while another thread uses numeric strings using the local decimal point).\n. It works for me. Is this problem limited to image files, or does it also affect video and audio files? Leave GPU processing off, and try each option under Settings > Display Method.\n. Shotcut on Windows tries to force the use of a discrete NVIDIA or AMD GPU.\nYou should also test using File > Open and not just drag-n-drop. Thanks\n\"Pending\" status means I might close this after a couple months if no one else is reporting it, no dev can reproduce it, or no one contributes the fix.\n. On my Windows 7 system without JACK installed, simply trying to open anything with JACK enabled crashes.\n. This is crashing on _getopt_internal() inside of jack_client_open() inside of MLT. This is the very first call to Jack, and it's result indicates success or failure. At the command line melt noise: -attach jackrack -consumer null returns unknown option character ? further supporting something fishy and wrong going on inside of Jack. I tried some different arguments to the jack_client_open() call with no success. This might be an issue with the version of Jack we are using.\nIn the meantime, one should only use this Shotcut setting if you actually have Jack installed and running. However, someone not knowing what this option is and just fiddling with all of the knobs may end up putting Shotcut into an usable state. I am going to remove this option on Windows.\n. Works for me. Provide exact steps to reproduce. Indicate if you have GPU processing on or not.\nPending means I will close this if I do not hear back within a couple weeks and still do reproduce it.\n. Still not able to reproduce. You have to select the clip to attach the filter - not the transition.\n. OK, I can confirm that is a bug. You did not specify it in your steps. I doubt this will ever be fixed because Crop is not intended to be used on tracks - only clips. I might make a change to disallow using it on track.\n. \"Why close?\" If I cannot reproduce it, I will close it.\n. OK, I am curious about the use case for this. I understand the desire to have track filters in general, but I mean Crop especially when it is also not intended to be used for compositing either. The current Crop filter is more for removing rough edges and removing black borders due to aspect ratio differences. I intend to add a different kind of crop for compositing. Thanks.\n. OK, I see. You might find it faster to add the Crop filter to each clip before adding it to the timeline or playlist. Then each time you choose a shot to add or use Split, it will copy that filter. i agree it is not as convenient as track filter, but it beats adding it to each timeline clip after editing.\nMerry Christmas!\n. Thanks, JB\n. This area is only for defect tracking, not general Q&A. To answer your question, see MLT and its melt command line utility, which Shotcut itself uses for encoding in a background process. Therefore, every copy of Shotcut comes with melt. Shotcut saves to MLT XML, which melt can read and process.\n. This is a duplicate of #149, which was already fixed. New version due later today.\n. Only builds provided by me through shotcut.org or this github project are supported by the developers of this project (of which I am the lead and made that policy decision). More than likely the build you are using does not follow the strict requirements dictated by scripts/build-shotcut.sh. You can report the problem to whoever created your build.\n. I reproduce this. It is trying to to save UTF-8 as can be seen here: https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/modules/xml/consumer_xml.c#L839\nHowever, it only works if all the strings put into MLT or MLT retrieves is UTF-8. It appears the locale string we are getting from MinGW glibc Windows is not in UTF-8.\n. Fixed in MLT git commit https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/25491c7c592a9a0389f2329fcbae671aea24af01\n. Unable to reproduce and not specific enough. It sounds like Shotcut is not very compatible with your system. You should try the different options under Settings > Display Method. Many people have more success with the DirectX option because Automatic prefers OpenGL but is unable to determine that is problematic on this system.\n. Not enough information. We need exact steps to reproduce. The log is not enough; it is actually very minimal.\n. It does not permit you (by design) to stretch a transition beyond the beginning or end of a clip.\n. I am the presenter and creator of Shotcut. It works fine for me within the constraints I previously explained; I just tested it. Do you understand those constraints? If you really do believe there is still a problem, explain the exact steps. No, referring to the video is not good enough. Or, get the source code and try to fix it yourself.\n. I know you said \"version 16.01,\" but you also said you have been using this a while, and there was a change between 15.12 and 16.01 that could have improved this. However, you might only see the improvement on projects created with v16.01. The bubble help that appears while moving clips has no bearing on this; it shows a time change relative to the starting point of the drag and is not always accurate. H.264 with B-frames in a TS file is problematic for seeking. I will try to test this with some similar files, but I wonder how long it takes to notice. I certainly do not have 3 hours of this format. Maybe I can encode something from an A/V sync test clip on a loop.\n. This MLT bug is quite likely related: https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/issues/69\n. @m9115m I just tested your steps, but I did not reproduce it. I am using a 90 min. movie source that was encoded using ffmpeg. I tested using both the timeline and not. Your problem might be related to the source. What created it? Is it variable frame rate (not supported)? Consider to post the output of mediainfo or ffprobe -show_format -show_streams against that file.\n. @m9115m  No, I was testing with 90 - 120 min. H.264 MP4 movies with dialog and judging the lip sync. The problem might be related to files created by Procaster and perhaps something special in them that throws something off somewhere. For example, maybe there is not a consistent number of audio samples over time - something called unlocked audio. That can be a real pain, and we do not do anything to address it. I noticed your file is 44.1 KHz audio. So, I also tested 48 KHz -> 44.1 KHz and 44.1 KHz -> 48 KHz with no problem. \nDoes the problem occur if you do NOT set an in point? Does the problem occur if you set Encode > Audio > Sample rate to 44100? If you use Avidemux to transcode (not copy) and then use that in Shotcut, make the ~20 min. in point, and encode; does it reproduce the problem? \n. Ultimately, folks, you need to realize that I have been working on A/V sync within MLT, the engine for Shotcut, since it was started in 2004. Any product has problems with some inputs and will continue to as long as audio and video are being used together. Take into consideration the number of standards, formats, and tools there are in existence. It is effectively an intractable problem and the bane of existence for all multimedia engineers ad infinitum. I do not have the desire or obligation to chase every little problem report in this area to its ultimate conclusion. Sometimes, it must wait until I or another developer faces the problem their self and deals with it.\n. I have reproduced the problem reported by @HeliosLHD and I believe it is due to that linked MLT bug. created a 3 hour H.264 TS file from a Tektronix A/V sync test as uncompressed AVI. Then, I did as reported placing about 10 longs shots cut from the source onto a timeline making it about 90 minutes long, encoded that and checked the result. The result was ahead by about 21 frames.\n. Just a note to report that I found the source of this bug and am working on a fix. In theory it could be the source of @m9115m's problem as well. The problem is related to 29.97 fps, and perhaps when I tried to reproduce @m9115m's problem I was using 23.976 fps since I was working with a long movie file at film rate.\n. P.S. A workaround given the use cases described here is to use the playlist and not the timeline. If the timeline has not been used, then encode will use the playlist. (And if the neither playlist or timeline is defined, then it uses what appears in Source player.) You cannot simply remove tracks from an existing project as Shotcut still has an empty timeline. It only works with projects where timeline has never been used. The reason this workaround works is because the bug is in the audio mixer, which is used by timeline.\n. Fixed in MLT for next release: https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/b264065634f0536bd302eeae6e61a4df3e60ba0d\n. It works for me on multiple systems and for thousands of other people. What do you expect us to do about it on your system? I have no idea why it does not work. Try fixing it yourself and submitting the fix or maybe again in a year from now to see if it got fixed by someone else.\n. Thanks @md81544. I will add something to the FAQ about this. I have mentioned this before to people on the G+ forum when it was clear that it used to start OK but suddenly stopped. In this case, it is not clear that was what had happened. The next step toward a real fix will be to remove one Shotcut registry item at time and test startup after removing it to find the one causing the problem.\n. Thanks, this is fixed now. You might not see the change for up to 48 hours due to the CDN cache.\n. You are on your own with custom builds.\n. I don't like distro packages for my app. This comes from someone with 15 years experience making software for desktop Linux; so, I understand what I am giving up.\n. This was recently fixed for the next release.\n. Unable to reproduce. Needs more details or a patch because if I cannot reproduce, I cannot fix. Also, you need to supply Shotcut version, and indicate if GPU processing is turned on.\n. yeah, I'm just going to close this as I am unable to reproduce it plus not specific about filters and no steps and no version = invalid\n. I am sorry, but \"cut a part\" is not well-defined (does that involve the playlist or timeline or neither?), and I do not know if you are using the latest version 16.01 of Shotcut with GPU processing disabled. I have tested a few different approaches to \"cut,\" adding both audio and video fade-in filters, and switching between the filters. I tested Shotcut 16.01 with GPU processing and JACK disabled on a MacBookPro11,1 running OS X 10.11.2.\n. No version supplied, and it works fine for me and others. I suspect your system is simply incompatible with Shotcut's OpenGL or DirectX requirements. You can try Settings > Display Method > DirectX. Otherwise, we do not intend to fix basic incompatibilities.\n. A fix is in-progress.\n. This was already fixed for next release. I reproduced it on Linux with v16.01, and verified it was fixed with nightly builds 16.01.24 for both Linux and Windows.\n. We are simply reporting what libavcodec from FFmpeg 2.7 is reporting. Even a newer pre-2.9 version of FFmpeg ffprobe gives me the same results (s16le). ffmbc tends to be dated, and I am inclined to trust newer ffmpeg versions to be more correct. Ultimately, you need more concrete evidence (i.e. a specification) to support your claim and report it to the FFmpeg project as this is not from our code base.\n. Yeah, Brian, that is a better idea, in mlt_properties_inherit(). However, that will not let Kdenlive have a short term fix.\n. I am not able to reproduce this with the White Balance or Color Grading filters with GPU processing enabled or disabled. Is GPU processing enabled?\nIs the problem with a combination of filters in a certain order on the clip? First, I only tested 1 White Balance on first clip and 1 Color Grading on second clip. Then, I made another test with same arrangement but added fade in and out to each of them. Still not able to reproduce.\n. OK, I believe you. Likely, there is a bug somewhere, but the person trying to fix it needs to be able to reproduce it. I will hold this open a little while in case we figure out what is happening.\nI do not know if Normalize can actually be used on a track. I think we need to remove some filters from the menu that do not work correctly on a track.\nYour steps are very normal and similar to some of my workflows. The gap created when making a transition is not exactly a bug. You are moving a clip, and moving a clip in general does not affect other items on the timeline. However, in this particular use case, in can be argued that it should respect the setting of the ripple toggle on the timeline toolbar, and I will take it into consideration for the to-do list.\n. Works for me. Try removing the registry entries at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Meltytech\\Shotcut\nClosing this because I do not reproduce it and I cannot fix it.\n. I am not able to reproduce this problem. I will leave this open for a while in case we figure out what is going on, but will close it after a few weeks if not.\n. A few questions that can help, focusing only on the timeline clip trimming:\n1. Is ripple mode on? There is a toggle button on the timeline toolbar with circles that governs this.\n2. Does it prevent or reduce crashing if audio waveforms are disabled in the timeline menu?\n3. Does it prevent or reduce crashing if video thumbnails are disabled in the timeline menu?\n. Expired without enough information.\n. This was recently fixed in duplicate report #214. A new version 16.04 containing this fix is due within 24 hours!\n. I have not been able to reproduce this. The XML contains a  for each clip in your playlist. The playlist is saved with the project, and the XML for encoding is the same as the project XML - it contains the playlist as well. I checked for \"files both getting missed, and other files overwritten with the wrong video\" but did not experience that. For the test, I ensured that I queued encodes that would take a good while by using HEVC and added new jobs while first couple were still running to create pending jobs as described. Still, your screenshot is convincing, and I will try again and review some of the code in this area.\n. Reviewing the code, I think the only way this can happen is if the temporary files containing MLT XML are not unique per job. I checked my debug log for my test session for lines like this:\n[Debug  ] <virtual void MeltJob::start()> \"C:/Projects/Shotcut/qmelt.exe\" (\"-progress2\", \"-abort\", \"C:/Users/ddennedy/AppData/Local/Temp/shotcut-U35980.mlt\")\n[Debug] messages are only available in developer builds - not release builds.\nIn my test session, these names were all unique. \nWe use QTemporaryFile to generate the temp file name. However, I think the way we are using it does allow the temp name to be recycled as we discard the QTemporaryFile object immediately after the job is enqueued. We probably need to save the XML as a string on the job object and then make the temp file when the job is actively running so we can keep the QTemporaryFile object active for the active lifetime of the job.\n. I reproduced this after adding a new feature to batch encode all of the playlist items. I have a fix pending testing.\n. You can download a nightly release from here to test and confirm this (and get new feature: From field added to top of Encode panel).\nhttp://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-win64-160211.exe\n. Unable to reproduce using latest v16.02. What version of Shotcut are you using?\n. Is GPU Processing enabled in Settings?\nTry the different options under Settings > Display Method to see if it makes a difference.\n. This FAQ item tells about those things:\nhttps://www.shotcut.org/bin/view/Shotcut/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#Where_are_the_log_presets_databa\nThe log is not very verbose and probably will not help much, but you can still provide it; it could reveal something. You could also export or take a screenshot of the registry settings.\nDoes this happen primarily with an existing project with which you are testing this? Or, can you provide steps from a clean start?\n. @Alexander01998 You can run shotcut.exe with gdb and when it crashes enter \"thread apply all bt\" to generate a backtrace. However, I (or another developer) almost always must be able to reproduce it in order to confirm a particular change fixes it, and a backtrace rarely helps to show steps (and many other factors). The steps here are not exactly bad, but perhaps a screencast video can help.\n. I reproduced the first crash.zip. It is not required to open any media. Simply add a track and continually right click on the track header and within 10 or so tries it should crash.\n. The second crash was reported recently and should already be fixed in v16.03.\n. A workaround is to use the Timeline toolbar's menu (hamburger) button or keyboard shortcuts.\nP.S. The bug report states \"I cannot add a new track,\" which is actually incorrect and misleading. There is usually more than one way to do something, and the details are very meaningful. Saying that opening the context menu on the track header or right-clicking on the track header is more accurate.\n. > That was actually the case when I opened this issue\nOK, I believe you due to that related bug (#196).\nI also just fixed crash bugs in MLT mentioned by @datietou after removing all tracks and adding new ones.\n. Honestly, I did not expect that to be a workable combination! Non-threaded GL was mainly added for ANGLE DirectX, which cannot support GPU processing. I will try to make a change you can test but no real way to test it myself.\n. Wait. Movit inherently requires threaded OpenGL. It runs in a separate thread and needs to be able to share GL resources with another thread. Perhaps the Qt supportsThreadedOpenGL() returns an incorrect value for your system. Otherwise, I do not know how to detect non-threaded GL that also supports Movit. I could stop using threadedOpenGL and just detect ANGLE instead.\n. What does qDebug() << \"OpenGL ES?\" << quickWindow()->openglContext()->isOpenGLES(); report on your system?\n. One thing I can do is to allow Settings > GPU Processing to force usage of threaded rendering. Do you have an easy way to test this?\n```\n--- src/glwidget.cpp\n+++ src/glwidget.cpp\n@@ -165,7 +165,7 @@ void GLWidget::initializeGL()\n     quickWindow()->openglContext()->makeCurrent(quickWindow());\n connect(m_frameRenderer, SIGNAL(frameDisplayed(const SharedFrame&)), this, SIGNAL(frameDisplayed(const SharedFrame&)), Qt::QueuedConnection);\n\n\nif (quickWindow()->openglContext()->supportsThreadedOpenGL())\n\nif (Settings.playerGPU() || quickWindow()->openglContext()->supportsThreadedOpenGL())\n         connect(m_frameRenderer, SIGNAL(textureReady(GLuint,GLuint,GLuint)), SLOT(updateTexture(GLuint,GLuint,GLuint)), Qt::DirectConnection);\n     else\n         connect(m_frameRenderer, SIGNAL(frameDisplayed(const SharedFrame&)), SLOT(onFrameDisplayed(const SharedFrame&)), Qt::QueuedConnection);\n@@ -347,7 +347,7 @@ void GLWidget::paintGL()\n     glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\n     check_error(f);\n\n\nif (!quickWindow()->openglContext()->supportsThreadedOpenGL()) {\n\nif (!(Settings.playerGPU() || quickWindow()->openglContext()->supportsThreadedOpenGL())) {\n         m_mutex.lock();\n         if (!m_sharedFrame.is_valid()) {\n             m_mutex.unlock();\n@@ -769,7 +769,7 @@ FrameRenderer::FrameRenderer(QOpenGLContext shareContext, QSurface surface)\n     Q_ASSERT(shareContext);\n     m_renderTexture[0] = m_renderTexture[1] = m_renderTexture[2] = 0;\n     m_displayTexture[0] = m_displayTexture[1] = m_displayTexture[2] = 0;\nif (shareContext->supportsThreadedOpenGL()) {\nif (Settings.playerGPU() || shareContext->supportsThreadedOpenGL()) {\n         m_context = new QOpenGLContext;\n         m_context->setFormat(shareContext->format());\n         m_context->setShareContext(shareContext);\n```\n. Maybe there is some context for multi-threaded that someone (including me) is misunderstanding. I will commit this. Thanks\n. Are you using a build from Homebrew?\n. I think the Homebrew cask just uses my build. Anyways, I do not reproduce it. Is this a one-off crash or consistent? What are the steps to reproduce it?\n. Also, is GPU processing enabled?\n. I cannot reproduce step 3. It is impossible to drag a clip from the Finder directly to the Playlist in an empty project. Please clarify that. If I continue on with the dragged clip running in the player, then I can add it to the playlist and proceed with your steps with no problem. Please share a screencast if you can.\n. Thank you. I have to figure out how you are able to do step 3. Now, I completely understand why it crashed. Meanwhile, there is a simple workaround: do not go directly from finder to playlist to timeline in an empty project. Rather, open the first clip in the player and then proceed.\n. I am not sure. Some people said they had to run as admin on Windows to get encoding to work. You should try that first. Otherwise, why is your project trying to load images from your Temp directory? Those files might be gone now.\n. Also, read the text of your project file in a text editor and look at file names. See if those files actually exist at those locations.\n. OK, thank you for providing some hint about what might have happened \"I never imported from a temporary directory.\" This tells me that some how the XML generated for the encode job, which is a temp file, got tricked into making relative path names to those files. I still do not know how, but it is a clue for why some people need to run as admin.\n. Try running Shotcut as admin to see if this problem goes away. We have heard about a problem related to files not found during encode when not running as admin but still not able to reproduce it ourselves to fix it.\n. Duplicate of bug #198\nWhen that bug was reported, I created a new non-admin user on Windows 10, logged in as standard user, but did not reproduce the problem. Still searching for the cause - a way to trigger the problem.\n. Can I get you to test this new build with the proposed fix?\nhttp://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-win64-160308.exe\n\nYou should first reproduce the problem again. Then, install new version. Next, without running as admin, see if the new version works. Thanks\n. @SeaHay Your latest problem is not related to the original problem. The new problem is \"[libx264 @ 000000000479c760] height not divisible by 2 (448x345)\". You need to fix your resolution.\nIt may be argued that Shotcut should enforce this, but there are literally thousands of rules for all the different formats and codecs and all of their parameters. Shotcut is not at this time trying to enforce a lot of rules, and adding that is also likely to introduce new bugs and unexpected or undesired limitations. This issue will remain closed.\n. Very poor description. Improve it or I close it.\n. OK but how do I reproduce it?\n. OK, I did that with Shotcut 15.03 on OS X 10.11, and it works fine for me. Some people on Windows are reporting a similar problem, and when they start Shotcut as Administrator, they are then able to export with correct results. But, I have not been able to reproduce it and figure out what causes this.\n. Can you please test this new version?\nhttp://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-debian7-x86_64-160308.tar.bz2\n. No, don't build it yourself. It is difficult and likely to produce\nsomething broken and invalidate your test. See the related bug #199 for a\nWindows version. Let me know if you want to help with Shotcut and need an\neasier way to dev and test.\n. FYI, we do not do anything with bug reports on experimental features. Just letting you know to not expect much followup action.\n. It is working for me. It must be something in your project file. In any case, we do not accept bug reports for this experimental feature unless it is accompanied with a patch (code fix).\n. Is this with GPU processing enabled?\n. I have not reproduced it. Here is the relevant portion of the crash report:\nThread 6 Crashed:: Thread (pooled)\n0   QtCore                          0x000000010052100e QMetaObject::activate(QObject*, int, int, void**) + 62\n1   QtCore                          0x00000001005a218d QAbstractItemModel::dataChanged(QModelIndex const&, QModelIndex const&, QVector<int> const&) + 61\n2   com.Meltytech.Shotcut           0x0000000100114446 MultitrackModel::audioLevelsReady(QModelIndex const&) + 134\nBasically, the background thread for generating audio waveforms for the timeline was sending an update for the timeline. Armed with that hint, I tried to reproduce it, but still not. Maybe it was a special coincidence/timing of sending waveforrm update at same time as exit.\nIs this repeatable for you?\n. Low priority\n. I am not able to reproduce this. It might be something in your project. Without a way to reproduce it, there is not enough information to debug it. I will leave it open for a while to see if more information becomes available - possibly from others.\n. Is it repeatable with a new, small project? If so, list your steps. If not, adding what makes it fail? For example, a particular filter attached to a clip? You can also attach a project file, but the more complicated it is, the less likely someone is willing to use it.\n. I have a FLV file that I use frequently while testing, and I have not experienced this problem. Perhaps the problem is specific to your particular file. I am still unable to reproduce this, and I am going to close this soon if no progress is made. \n. Unable to reproduce and expired.\n. No, Brian, this is not fixed in version 16.03. It was, however, recently resolved and closed in 2 related bug reports. One of those, #199 has a link to an interim release that includes the fix.\n. What is your version?\n. A workaround is to drag the image to the player instead of the timeline.\n. Unable to reproduce. Provide exact steps from the beginning.\n. By design, filters can be attached to clips, tracks, or the timeline as a whole. Pay attention. There is a text above the filter list that says if you are applying to a track or the Timeline. Yes, after adding something to the timeline, it is not automatically selected. Click the top left corner of the timeline to see filters attached to the timeline. I believe this is operator error. Playhead position does not determine the filter list. Whatever is selected does.\n. Reopening to improve auto-selection and indication of selection both on Timeline and Filters.\n. I seem to recall that avformat_producer used to do this, but I had to fix a libavcodec API change and lost it. See this:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/6b79e7c79ae67b56284ccca16cde3cac9f2587b6\nNormally, *channels = 2, and av_get_default_channel_layout(2) ought to return stereo. But, I do not know why; maybe downmixing is no longer implicit and requires explicit avfilters to achieve.\n. Unable to reproduce.\nWhere did you get Shotcut? What version is it?\nAs a workaround, trim it before adding it to the timeline.\n. OK, thanks. Another workaround for the Timeline (assuming this bug report is about drag-n-drop edge trimming) is to use the 'i' and 'o' keyboard shortcuts. Please correct that assumption if wrong.\nAlso, the screenshot shows that Ripple mode is Off, which is also good to know.\n. These do seem like legitimate errors unrelated to Qt. Why declare something is final when it is not even virtual? I think we should remove Q_DECL_FINAL on the methods in this header.\nWith respect to Qt 5.6, it removes the QtWebKit module, which we rely upon. It is not yet clear to me that we can actually do everything we need to do with the newer Qt WebEngine module. That certainly seems true for WebVfx but maybe also for the WYSIWYG HTML editor. I have not fully analyzed this, but I get that impression from Qt blog posts and their comments. Also, Shotcut is untested with that version. I have found that our intensive use Qt features does not hold up so well from one Qt 5 version to the next. IOW, we have had to make quite a bit of changes with each Qt version change we have adopted.\n. @Gaffy2 You say you can repeat this error \"on any change,\" but the original reporter's steps say \"without dropping it,\" which implies no change. Doesn't sound the same to me. Any change to what?\n@OpusMcN You wrote \"Dragging a new video clip.\" Dragging it from where - playlist or source player?\n. @Gaffy2 yes, but do not bother attaching a dump file. Please include steps to reproduce.\n. There have been a number of crashes fixed over the past few releases related to dragging from playlist to timeline, moving clips between tracks, and changing timeline clip properties. The latest version is 16.06.08. I am not reproducing the it (original problem reported) per the description and screen capture. If this is still a problem on the latest version, you can reopen it.\n. I have not reproduced this, but there have been some changes to fix bugs related to waveforms. I think your cached audio levels data for some clips is now incorrect. Right-click the clip on the timeline and choose Rebuild Audio Waveform to see if the problem goes away.\n. I am going to close this because we do not have a way to validate audio levels data without actually regenerating it, we do not save the shotcut version along with the audio levels data, and I do not want to simply discard everyone's cached data when they upgrade to a newer version.\n. Unable to reproduce. You are doing something wrong, but I do not know what. Pay attention, in particular, to what is selected and which tab is current in the player. I suspect you are attaching the filter to the clip that is in the Source player and not the timeline clip. If you really think there is a problem, provide the steps to reproduce it - something better than you current description, obviously. Or, make a screencast of it.\n. Seeking upon select is not performed by design (it used to do that and was changed in response to a bug report that I agreed with). The difference between single click and double click is by design. There is no \"source list\" and Playlist is not required to use the Timeline. When using the Playlist, there is no one-to-one correspondence between something in the Playlist and something in the Timeline. They both contain possibly differing sub-clips of some source asset. Double-click - like most things in desktop - is a shortcut for Open, and opening an item on the Timeline opens a copy in the Source player for you to use to create another shot. Maybe that is the biggest gotcha in all of this. Focus on the timeline is extremely obvious - the clip's shading is inverted AND there is a red outline. How is that not obvious?\n. I will remove double-click from the Timeline since a lot people struggle with the distinction between single and double. That will require a more deliberate action for something less seldom used - arguably more advanced. I will also relabel the timeline clip context menu from \"Open As Clip\" to \"Open Copy\" or similar.\n. > If I doubleclick an item in the timeline. It still looks like it has focus (red outline, inverted shading).\nProperties and Filters generally show and affect what is selected, but \"selection\" actually also depends upon which tab is selected on the player. The item selected on the Timeline only matters when the player tab is also Program. If the player tab is Source, then Properties and Filters shows/affects what is loaded in the source player. I once experimented with adding a red outline around the player when the Source tab is selected (and simultaneously removing the selection outline in Timeline), but that was too visually distracting. I will make an experiment to give the scrub/trim bar a red outline instead.\n\nI'm a bit confused as to the usecase of opening a copy in the player. Why would you want that?\n\nWhy do people copy things to the clipboard? Think of the source player as a clipboard-with-viewer. Some examples: trim out another shot from the same source file to add to the timeline or playlist, modify the copy and overwrite the original, add duplicates of the a shot to timeline (e.g. repeating an image), export/transcode just that clip without closing or restarting the app.\n\n(double-click) opens it in the player with the in and out point marked and the filters applied.\n\nWhat happens when you trim? It automatically affects the timeline? What if you try to extend where there is another clip in the way? Does it overwrite/ripple or limit your range? I do not like the unintended destruction or superficial/confusing limitations this might cause. With the current design, you can choose to open a copy in the player, re-trim it, and then insert or overwrite on the timeline just like you would with a new clip. Trimming something on the timeline but outside the timeline feels wrong to me - too disconnected. Either trim something beforehand in the source player, trim something directly on the timeline, or trim a copy in the source player that you will use to replace the timeline item.\nWith that said, it is a bad idea in UIs in general to have very different behaviors for single click and double-click on an object, which is the situation today. How many times have you watched people double-click when only single-click was needed? However, changing double-click in Shotcut's timline to select+seek is both useful and not dangerously confusing.\n. Nothing changed in this area from the previous version, and it works fine on many machines including mine. Sorry, and I do not expect this to go anywhere, but I will leave it open for a while to see if someone else has a problem. Maybe you want to remove your settings because it might related to your window panels arrangement.\n. Thanks for the update. I am closing this because it is not clear how to reproduce it, and there is a good chance it is not something in our code but rather a library or driver.\n. Which filter exactly? I have not seen this on CPU mode BTW - might be specific to your system configuration.\n. GPU mode is a duplicate of #130. I have not been able to reproduce it on CPU mode. It might depend on other factors.\nIs this repeatable?\nBriefly describe the source to which you are applying the filter.\nDoes it only happen for an item in an existing project? Does it happen if you start Shotcut fresh, open a clip, and before adding it to Playlist or Timeline, add the filter and resize it?\n. Not able to reproduce on OS X (not in front of Windows at the moment, and the choice of OS should not make a difference here). Did you re-select the clip on the timeline just to be sure? Maybe sometimes Properties does not get updated. Are you certain you did not switch to the Source player tab? Please provide steps to reproduce.\n. I believe this is a duplicate of #231 \n. Not enough information. No OS specified. \"Network location\" too ambiguous. Please do not spam us with bad bug reports, or I will be quick to just close them when I see how brief they are and who is is from.\n. Unable to reproduce.\n. This area is for software defect tracking only. Use a forum for help and general Q&A.\n. > I add another Overlay HTML and selected another HTML file it opens the HTML file again with the correct filename but the contents are wrong\nIs that because the editor was automatically opened? I am not sure I understand this one. Is this part also a new problem with 16.04?\nOtherwise, I found and fixed the other points.\n. Can you please test this new build?\nhttp://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-debian7-x86_64-160419.tar.bz2\n. Thanks, as a workaround for the last issue point, switch tabs in the editor to toggle the source to be updated. This bug occurred when the editor was closed in View Source mode. Upon opening, it would only load the WYSIWYG mode and then loads source when switching tabs. Fixed now for next release.\n. I agree.\n. This was bugging me for a while too, especially the \"crazy jumping.\" Glad I could finally fix it.\n. Whenever you make a change to filters (and other situations), the video is refreshed to preview it. Whenever a video frame is displayed, the timeline updates the playhead position to reflect it - a normal part of moving the playhead while the video plays. Whenever the playhead moves, the timeline is scrolled - a normal part of scrolling the timeline while the video plays. It is debatable whether the timeline scrolling when previewing changes is much of a usability issue. What is not so debatable is the code changes required to prevent that behavior - the effort of the changes, the subsequent bugs that will surely arise, and the additional effort to work through those bugs.\n. Unable to reproduce. Are you using binary builds provided by the Shotcut project?\n. Nevermind, I reproduced it. This is a high priority for me to fix for next release.\n. Unable to reproduce. It is working as intended and designed.\n. You can submit a patch or wait until someone else who is a developer is affected by this. You could make a screencast as well as provide some media info about your clip. Does sound work on your system?\n. > The frequencies appear unshifted AFAICT.\nThat might be the problem. Playback speed is regulated by the sound device. When you fast forward, it simply skips every other frame. Shotcut is based on MLT, which is 13 years old and started on Linux. It has been used by other video apps Kdenlive, Flowblade, and OpenShot. So, it has been through much refinement. I do not know why it is a problem on your system, and the Shotcut binary is built on Debian stable. Interesting. We can re-open the bug, but that does not mean I volunteer to give this my attention. Basically, it will wait until someone who is affected decides to do something about it.\n. Another thing you can try to test is in a terminal window in a X session:\n$ melt your-file\nDon't have melt? apt-get install melt. How does that play? How does audio sound? You can press '6' to play fast-forward. Same problem?\nIf that is fine, next try\n$ path/to/Shotcut/Shotcut.app/melt your-file\nSame difference?\n. > Seems I need '7'.\nCorrect, 5 is pause, 6 normal forward, 7 fast forward.\n\nBoth behave exactly the same: speed is moderately enlarged, the factor could be 2, which seems correct.\n\nThen, melt and MLT provided with Shotcut is working fine.\nHow are you starting Shotcut? Running Shotcut.app/bin/shotcut is not supported. You must run Shotcut.app/shotcut (or use the icon, which tries to do the same thing).\n. It appears that auto saved XML files are not resolving relative paths correctly. That is going to be tricky as there is not anything saved in the auto saved file to help with that currently. I think I need to tell auto save not to use relative paths...\n. On second thought, since the asset (SVG) does not reside in the same folder as the auto-saved XML, it will not save with a relative path. I was not able to reproduce the problem using a video or SVG file. So, I am not sure what the problem is. Somehow, the auto-saved XML got tricked into using relative paths when it should not.\n. In any case, this is very similar to an issue many people reported when encoding, which saves XML to a temp file in $TMP, and the resolution for that was to force using full paths. I never reproduced that problem either, but the solution thus far appears to be to force usage of absolute paths in the temp file. I applied the same solution here. However, when you save a recovered XML, it will convert back to relative paths for assets in the same folder or a sub-folder.\n. Another workaround is to simply include the picture in a playlist or timeline more than once.\n. I do not know what \"re-rendered from other software\" exactly entails, which makes it uneasy to reproduce and debug. Therefore, do not expect this bug to get much action. Look at the MLT XML. There is some important information about the clips stored in there such as length, audio_index, and video_index (stream index within container) but not much else. Obviously, you cannot change the index values between re-rendering. The length is not as sensitive. Based on that, what do you think is wrong?\n\nThe problem can be corrected by displaying properties of the clip and hitting reset, this will populate the correct codec/resolution (changing from blank codec and 0x0 resolution).\n\nThat part is a duplicate of #231.\n. Reproduced on OS X as well.\nWorkaround: remove the filter or add some text.\n. Fixed in MLT git commit https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/a2a11e6b0f77498be444d01ba1b07571a23863e0\n. The installer has an option that says something like \"check this option if you experience a new crash at startup.\" Did you try that? If not, you should.\n. Does it work again if you install an older version (best if you can remember what it was - perhaps from download history).\n. Sorry, but something changed on your system, and Shotcut is no longer compatible. We are not acting upon or keeping open crash-on-launch system incompatibility bugs. \n. I do not see that problem, and it is the responsibility of Qt to open the menu (there is no Shotcut code that responds directly to open-menu events). So, I do not expect this to go anywhere. I believe it is quite specific to your environment.\n. Does not reproduce on my Kubuntu 14.04 system running on hardware or a fresh install of 14.04 of Unity running in VirtualBox.\n. The player shall never reflect anything that is not the playhead position. The question is then whether to seek upon completing trimming, and I do not think it should.\nThis area is for defect tracking only and not enhancement requests or discussing refinements. Use the forum for that.\n. Oh, wait, I see it depends upon if the item under playhead changes, and yes that needs refresh.\n. A workaround is to zoom way in on the timeline and delete the 1-frame transition that was created and not removed.\n. I started working on this, but it is rather tricky and difficult especially with undo history integration. Might take a while.\n. This is simply not available yet. You have to either use another track or the Source player to move things around. For example, you can right-click a clip on timeline, choose Open, which opens a copy of it in the Source player. Then, delete the timeline clip, move playhead to the new position, and finally click the Insert button on the timeline toolbar, which copies it from the Source player to the timeline. Yes, I know that stinks, and it would be nice to simply drag-n-drop to reorder, but lots of things would be nice, and that is simply the way it is for now.\nThere is another workaround if the clip you want to move is also in Playlist. Then, you can skip the first part of copying the timeline clip to the Source player. Next, delete the timeline clip you want to move, make sure ripple mode is enabled on the timeline toolbar, and then drag-n-drop from the playlist to the timeline. Ripple mode makes dropping on the timeline an insert operation instead of overwrite.\n. FYI, reordering clips on a track will be easier in the next release (16.06) with new cut and paste commands.\n. We do not provide support for build problems. We have a few months that compile Shotcut nightly on a couple different OSes that serves our needs for producing monthly binary releases. Bugs against the build system are not accepted without a patch (i.e. pull request).\nWhy are you trying to cross-compile it yourself? If you have a good reason, I can give you a SDK that makes development on Windows easier.\n. We do not take feature or enhancement requests. This tracker is only for defects, and this is not a defect.\n. Thank you!\n. No, and Shotcut has been tested with Mesa and llvmpipe - mainly in virtual machines. \n. What does glxinfo | grep OpenGL say?\nDoes the binary provided by the project work?\n. I do not know what you mean claiming it is something MLT. Here is where it fails on you according to the original description:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/src/widgets/gltestwidget.cpp\nThat is in Shotcut's Qt-using code, and since you are compiling from source, you can easily look into it deeper on your own. Even after this, the only time MLT has anything to do with OpenGL is when you enable GPU image processing, which is another level beyond the basic GL used to draw some UI (Qt Quick) and display the video, which is all Qt-based code:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/src/glwidget.cpp\n. Shotcut requires Qt WebKit module, but that module is no longer provided with Qt 5.6 and onward. I do not know how you installed Qt, but you cannot install some things from Qt binaries and another module from MacPorts and expect them to work together. Complex software like this does not work that way. My suggestion is to download a Qt 5.5.1 SDK from Qt project and configure it in the build settings of Qt Creator.\nClosing at this is not a bug.\n. Not a bug, enhancement request, and enhancement requests are not bugs and not accepted. Use the HTML filter if you want text with wrapping.\n. I can confirm this is a new bug with v16.06, but there is a really easy and simple workaround. Do not press Enter. Simply remove focus from the speed field by press Tab or clicking elsewhere.\n. Maybe clicking elsewhere depends much on where you click, and that is a lot\nplaces to check and communicate about. How about tab for you?\nOn Sun, Jun 5, 2016, 12:09 PM grizeldi notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHere it still crashes by clicking elsewhere...\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/issues/251#issuecomment-223831136,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/ABF_O9_mO8vtCIIbUmRN0xPRBahoI8yxks5qIx7XgaJpZM4Iuafg\n.\n. Yeah, the more I test this, I see Tab and click elsewhere are not reliable workarounds. Also, changing any clip properties is having a problem.\n. There is a new version 16.06.08 available for download that contains this fix and another crash fix.\n. Do not use the Shotcut project for this kind of bug report. melt runs the last producer in the composition. Typically the last producer is <tractor>, which is a kind of producer. In your composition, the last producer is a <producer> whose resource is \"../dv/crystal_ballroom/2016-05-23/13_29_18.ts\" and melt is doing what it was told.\n. CSS Animation does not work. Only Javascript animation using the WebVfx extensions preserves the animation speed and timing. There is no way around this.\nSee this: https://www.shotcut.org/howtos/tumult-hype/\n. No, it is not possible because Web Designer relies upon  CSS animation. You can play the animation in a web browser and make a screen capture of it.\n. A 32-bit process on Windows is limited to 2GB memory, which is not enough for this multitrack video editor. Also, the last time I tried to make a 32-bit build after upgrading some heavily used libraries, compiler, and runtime; I could not get the app to launch.\n. Version 16.10 just released today includes a 32-bit version for Windows.\n. Unable to reproduce. Maybe you still have a HTML filter attached to something else like the track or the whole timeline. Pay attention to what is selected. Otherwise, I need exact steps to reproduce starting from a new project.\n. It works for me. Do NOT use the Format drop-down above the tabs of the Export panel (unless you REALLY know what you are doing). Use a preset from the choices along the left of the Export panel.\nIf you still have a problem, you must provide exact details of the encoding settings. To do that, click + button at bottom of list of export presets. A dialog opens with a text box with several lines of text. Copy that text and paste it here.\n. Unable to reproduce and bug reports about GPU processing are not being accepted without a patch.\n. I understood what you wrote after I sent the reply and spent more time trying to reproduce and study the information you provided. I am still not able to reproduce it with GPU off, given the steps above, and adding the missing step to open the project. \nfrei0r.cairoblend is for CPU processing and movit.overlay is for GPU processing. It makes no sense to replace that.\n. Try to reproduce it again using the steps you originally provided to verify the steps.\nClarify these 2:\nNote that compositing is now disabled on track 2\n\nDo you mean the \"C\" button on V2 is off/not highlighted? That is what I interpret it as but do not reproduce.\n\nClick the \"C\" button and note that nothing happens\n\nDo you mean that the highlight state of the \"C\" button does not switch when you click it?\nOr do you mean there is compositing effect in the video preview? If that is what you mean, then 2 videos with no alpha channel information are not going to show any net effect using the default blending mode (by design).\n. Strongly related to #258 and will be tracked there.\n. Unable to reproduce.\n. A screencast would be good perhaps to reveal something missing, but I need to be able to reproduce it.\nThe tool to generate a stack trace is gdb, but I do not know how easy it is to get that and use it on Windows. I mean I get it through a much larger suite of development tools. If you have it and know what to do, great. Otherwise, I do not volunteer to guide you through that.\n. The video adds little to your already good description. In other words, it did not reveal a misunderstanding, but sadly I still cannot reproduce it. The fact that 'C' does not toggle clearly indicates the track compositor component could not be located, and surely it crashes for the same reason. Yet, your borked.mlt does show them in place (frei0r.cairoblend).This does help to narrow down the problem, but not sure what exactly is the problem - perhaps some memory corruption or race condition.\nIf you install mingw-w64, you will get gdb. The debug symbols from gcc are incompatible with WinDbg, and the dump file is useless to me. If you are a developer, you can help, and I can give you the pre-built SDK to bootstrap the process. You do not need to use Qt Creator, but it is highly recommended and  mingw and gcc are mandatory. \n. The SDK is here:\nhttp://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-win64-sdk-160619.zip\nThe instructions in the link \"you can help\" above provides the build toolchain including gdb. I have not tried to attach gdb to a running instance of Shotcut although that should be possible in theory. I just use command prompt, cd to to where shotcut.exe is and gdb shotcut assuming gdb is in your path. Then, at the (gdb) prompt, issue 'r' followed by Enter to start it.\n. Thanks for following up on this, Mark.\n. Also, do not judge the audio using Shotcut as it is not the best player and known to have some audio continuity issues during playback on some systems.\nPlease use another tool to simply transcode one of your clips and see if it gives similar results.\n.

It would be interesting for you to edit one of your project files (make a backup copy of it first), locate every <transition> that has a child <property name=\"mlt_service\">mix</property>\", and add child <property name=\"disable\">1</property> to see if that eliminates the problem. It will disable all audio mixing; so best to use a project that does not depend on it. This will help confirm the general source of error.\nIf that removes the problem, another test is to remove the <property name=\"disable\">1</property> lines you added and then change <property name=\"combine\">1</property> to have the value 0 instead of 1.\nI do not have good hearing and struggle to hear or read this (Audacity waveform) to run these tests myself and determine if they make a difference.\n. That is the same conclusions my daughter came to. When I make a changes I will rely upon her to provide testing feedback. Assuming I can figure it out, I will post a nightly build that contains a hopeful fix for additional testing by people here.\n. As I suspected, the problem is in the mixer's \"combine\" method, as shown here:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/modules/core/transition_mix.c#L66\nIn particular, see the comment \"uses an inline low pass filter to allow mixing without volume hacking\", line 72 \"double B = exp(-2.0 * M_PI * Fc);\" and line 87 \"v_prev[j] = buffer_a[ i * channels_a + j ] = v * A + v_prev[j] * B;\"\nThis represents an odd technique that can be described as a \"quick and dirty\" solution to the problem of attenuation with the simpler but more recommended method of summing with averaging. See the links below for details. Without \"combine=1\" (which is what this change does), we resort back to the simple method that results in some softening of the dynamics, and people will have to apply audio filters to compensate where needed.\nhttp://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/3581/algorithms-to-mix-audio-signals-without-clipping\nhttp://www.voegler.eu/pub/audio/digital-audio-mixing-and-normalization.html\n. This is the way disabled items appear on the dark theme.\n. Duplicate of #238 \nNothing changed in this version over version 16.05 that would have causes this. I think it affects some Linux users, perhaps only some times since you are reporting it as a new problem. And I still do not reproduce it. Maybe someone who is affected will actually cough up a fix.\n. Closing as not-my-bug. It is a bug in the version of Qt we are using, and no, it cannot be simply upgraded at this time.\n. I reproduced the problem exactly as described. However, there are workarounds. If the image is already on the timeline, drag the right edge of the clip. You can also adjust duration in the Source player - before adding it to the timeline - either by trimming or changing the duration field in Properties. \n. FYI, changing the duration in Properties of a still image in the Source player affects the trimmed (aka selected region in the scrub bar) duration. This is by design. The maximum/potential duration is fixed at 10 minutes to allow you to adjust the duration by trimming either in the source player or in the timeline.\n. Hmm, in fuil-screen mode, most popups and additional windows seem to be a problem on Windows (at least Win 10). I am going to have to that feature on Windows. Outside of that, I am having trouble to reproduce on the X axis. I can easily add some checks to the code setting the coordinates, which I will do, but not easy for me to confirm a fix. I can reproduce the bottom of the menu running off the bottom edge of the screen; so, that is my way to confirm the fix. Also, I can give you an interim build to test tomorrow.\n. Oh, I was only looking at the screen edges. Menus and popups in GUI apps are allowed to run beyond the edge of the window, but their origin should start within the window.\n. I got it and agree. No screenshot needed.\n. Fixed in 2498712\n. No, because it works for me.. This is not due to a leakage, but rather usage. The engine, MLT, reads and uses images at their full resolution - not the project resolution - by design. It does this to provide the highest quality result for crop, pan, and zoom operations. You would not want to make an image from the original at project resolution, then crop it, and then zoom in on it. When images at full resolution are combined with caching, playback buffering, and memory pooling, it can use a lot of memory for just a few images. However, the caching mechanism is what also allows many images, such as 50 or more, without much more memory usage than just several images. Slow, smooth, high quality pan & zoom animation effects are in the engine but not yet exposed through the app.\n. From where did you download Shotcut? It works for me and many others without this problem. Does it prevent you from using the app or crash thereafter?\n. I think it is safe to say that Shotcut is not compatible with your system, but I do not know what the problem is or how to figure out what it is (perhaps outside of you sending the computer to me or setting up a remote session ala TeamViewer - neither of which I am volunteering to do).\n. This can happen if you are using a Windows shell extension that is using a different version of Qt than Shotcut and not using -qtnamespace in a custom build of Qt. Anything which hooks into the system like this should use -qtnamespace to avoid a problem like this. Some possible examples are Tortoise SVN (which I have installed but is not causing a problem for me) and Dell Backup and Restore.\nSee also this Qt Forum post.\n. Closing because the next version 16.09 due Sept. 2 will be using a custom build of Qt 5.6.1 that does not depend on gstreamer.\n. I have seen this too, but unfortunately I have not been able to fix it. A have found that a workaround is to double-click the filter window's title bar to return it to its original tabbed location. In general, double-click the title bar of any panel to make the panel float (separate window) or dock (embedded in main window). \n. Next release 16.09 will be using Qt 5.6.1, and we will see if this makes a difference. I could not find a reliable way to reproduce it on 16.08 or less in order to fully verify this.\n. Please re-test on v16.09. I did and was unable to reproduce it yet.\n. All current developers are unable to reproduce this bug, but I will leave it open to collect all \"does not work for me at all on Windows reports.\" Who knows; maybe someone affected by this will debug it and submit a patch.. @Dionysusnu this is a known bug in that version. You need to upgrade to v18.06.02. @kwacky1 can you provide a sample?\nI can give you an upload location if you don't have a way to share temporarily.. @kwacky1 Thank you. I got it and reproduced the crash.. @kwacky1 The crash you reported is fixed for the next version 19.02. I do not disagree. Do you have a suggestion for the name of a new category for this class of presets? \"intermediate\" ?\n. It works on Lubuntu 16.04 - just not on your system due to an adequate OpenGL 2.1+ implementation due to the nouveau driver - or at least nouveau on this hardware. This is explained in some places in the FAQ. We try to detect a compatible OpenGL and present an error dialog at startup, but it is not foolproof. We do not strive to provide a lowest common denominator solution and will not fix this.\n. I switched my system over to nouveau, and I did not have this problem:\nddennedy@MS-7593:~$ glxinfo | grep OpenGL\nOpenGL vendor string: nouveau\nOpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on NVC1\nOpenGL core profile version string: 4.1 (Core Profile) Mesa 11.2.0\nOpenGL core profile shading language version string: 4.10\nOpenGL core profile context flags: (none)\nOpenGL core profile profile mask: core profile\nOpenGL core profile extensions:\nOpenGL version string: 3.0 Mesa 11.2.0\nOpenGL shading language version string: 1.30\nOpenGL context flags: (none)\nOpenGL extensions:\nOpenGL ES profile version string: OpenGL ES 3.0 Mesa 11.2.0\nOpenGL ES profile shading language version string: OpenGL ES GLSL ES 3.00\nOpenGL ES profile extensions:\nddennedy@MS-7593:~$ lspci | grep VGA\n03:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GF108 GeForce GT 440\nSo, maybe it is a problem with your nouveau on your hardware, or maybe it is something else completely different, but I do not know and cannot fix it. Shotcut is known to not work on some systems for reasons unknown due to lack of patches. So, either it works for you, or it does not, and if it does not, you can debug it and submit a patch. \n. Remove the getInt(); it is not needed. How do you think we got along this far without it?\n. Just use get() and set() for an int. Both MLT properties and QML variables are variant types. In the beginning, I tried to get by without getDouble() but ran into some numeric locale issues with decimal point handling.\n. Some Qt Quick Controls offer a tooltip property that should be used where available. Then, use ours when not available.\n. I just realize that this new parameter has no unit of measure and goes from 0 - 100 with no indication of whether 0 or 100 is smoothest. Looking at the docs:\nhttps://www.mltframework.org/bin/view/MLT/FilterVidstab#smoothing\nIs this parameter N in the (2N + 1)?\nIs too inaccurate or misleading to simply give this parameter a unit of measure of \"frames\"?\n. >  'suffix' of that property to be 'frames'?\nqsTr(' frames') qsTr() to make it translatable. We do not always make suffix translatable if it has a commonly used symbol or abbreviation, but perhaps we should and will because even those can vary. Also, the controls do not put a space between the value and the suffix, and I like to have a space there; so, there is an intentional space at the beginning of this string.\n\nthe width of the value field of the slider spinner doesn't appear to resize correctly\n\nIt is not resize automatic. It must be changed from its default with the spinnerWidth property. With that said, it looks fine for me on Windows 10 using 125% text size. It is not independent of factors such as OS, and system font settings. However, it does automatically adjust for whole jumps in DPI. For example, Apple Retina systems show a devicePixelRatio within Qt as 2.0, but on Windows it will not show  1.5 for 150%. It only shows 2.0 when you go to 200%. So, largely, we have to just increase the width of this property as-needed.\n. GroupBoxes are ugly, and I refuse to use them. Why the do you think I made bold labels for a heading and indentation?!\nNever include changes to translation files in your pull requests. That process is handled separately so we do not nag the transifex.com translators on a daily basis whenever a string change occurs.\n. For filter UIs, I tend to prefer action-style buttons at the bottom like the convention for a dialog window - unless, perhaps, if there are many items in the window and it becomes cluttered and confusing. If you disagree for this filter, you can move the button, and I will try it out.\nThe english .ts file is picked up by transifex.com from git whenever it changes. Then, translators get a notification and make the changes on transifex.com. I update this (english .ts) in a git a week before release. Then, the night before release, I download all translations (except english) from transifex.com, update them with lupdate one last time, and upload them to git.\nQML Designer is worthless to Shotcut. I think it only works with pure and simple Qt QML (no extensions). It can be handy to mockup animations, but we make very little use of them. You should just edit the QML source and preview it in Shotcut. You can setup Qt Creator to run Shotcut without building it. That way you can make a change, and run it from within there and see messages in its panel.\n. I do not really like the appearance of the location of the new button. Maybe because it appears in the label column. Here is a variation that places it in the control column, which I like better:\n``` javascript\n--- src/qml/filters/stabilize/ui.qml\n+++ src/qml/filters/stabilize/ui.qml\n@@ -141,6 +141,28 @@ Item {\n             onClicked: accuracySlider.value = 4\n         }\n\nItem {\nLayout.fillWidth: true\n}\nRowLayout {\nLayout.columnSpan: 2\nButton {\nid: button\ntext: qsTr('Analyze')\nonClicked: {\nbutton.enabled = false\nfileDialog.folder = settings.savePath\nfileDialog.open()\n}\n}\nLabel {\nid: status\nComponent.onCompleted: {\nsetStatus(false)\n}\n}\n\n}\n+\n         Label {\n             text: qsTr('Filter Options')\n             Layout.columnSpan: 3\n@@ -185,24 +207,6 @@ Item {\n             onClicked: smoothingSlider.value = 15\n         }\n\n\nButton {\n\nid: button\ntext: qsTr('Analyze')\nLayout.alignment: Qt.AlignRight\nonClicked: {\nbutton.enabled = false\nfileDialog.folder = settings.savePath\nfileDialog.open()\n}\n}\nLabel {\nid: status\nLayout.columnSpan: 2\nComponent.onCompleted: {\nsetStatus(false)\n}\n\n}\n Item {\n     Layout.fillHeight: true;\n }\n\n```\n. Regarding Brian's last comment, I agree it can be nice to disable the Filter Options until after Analyze is complete. However, always keep the Analyze Options available. Upon existence of a .stab file, disable the Analyze button and hide the help text beside it. Then, whenever someone changes one of the Analyze Options, enable the Analyze button and show a new help text beside it: You must click Analyze to use the new option values. Except in this case, since we already have a .stab file, we do not need to prompt for it again. There is no need to keep track of the settings; simply set and clear a boolean pending results state.\n\n\nI am not very keen to make it automatically start analysis, find and kill a running job whenever an Analyze Option changes, and start a new job. I think that is unnecessarily complicated and takes some control away from the user. Keep it simple, but add more feedback and context sensitivity.\n. Chris, send an email to dan@dennedy.org if you want a free membership to the patron forum for a couple of months for your contribution. With a more substantial contribution, I will give you a year. If you become a somewhat regular contributor, you will become a part of the team and therefore get a lifetime membership.\n. You can make a project consisting of only a full clip and the Stabilize filter with its .stab file, and then open that MLT XML as a virtual clip to use in other projects making cuts from it. Yes, it would be nice to select a .stab file in the stabilize filter, but I know people are going to shoot their self in the foot with that. ;-)\n. No to saving the stab file in tmp or an app data folder because that breaks portable and archivable projects. It is possible to make projects with relative paths.\n. On the road map is \"project management.\" For this, you would set a project folder, and it will save things there automatically and have options to copy or move media into it. It might include other things as well.\n. [Warning] <> file:///C:/Projects/Shotcut/share/shotcut/qml/filters/stabilize/ui.qml:229:13: id is not unique\n. After successfully completing Analyze and after the filter loses focus (click on another filter or clip) and you return to stabilize, it says \"Analysis complete\" but the Analyze button is enabled. It would be nice to disable it until an option is changed just like after analysis is done. Not required, but since you have the above fix to make, you might consider it. Thanks!\n. No there is no way to save state other than to set a custom filter property, but that will not help you here. I was referring to after analysis is complete, not in the middle of running.\n. After running analyze once, letting it complete, leaving the filter and returning, it says \"Analysis complete.\" So, there is some state. How does it know that? (I know; no need to answer. I am just trying to help you understand.) All I am saying is that the Analyze button at this point is enabled when it should be disabled. Do not try anything more complicated than fixing that at this point. Also, you still have not fixed the loading error I mentioned above, which is an easy fix. \n. See this commit 5a5bce6d79a96cc2621444466cd286c8b6a606dd to see how I fixed it.\nIn the future, the first line of git commit messages should be short followed by a blank line and more information if needed.\n. I reproduced this on Windows. I can workaround it by either disabling parallel processing or disabling compositing on V2. If I change the mlt_service in the XML for the JPEG from pixbuf to qimage, it does not make a difference. For me, converting to PNG did not make a difference; it still fails. This suggests a problem with parallelism in the track compositor. \n. Wait, I overlooked that there are 2 image producers in this XML. So, yeah, using PNG did make it succeed.  Ok, odd.\n. Which operating system are you using and version of Shotcut?\n. @nsmarkop What is your Windows language setting?\n. In case a developer wants to work on this, take a look here:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/win32/win32.c\nMLT string properties standardize on UTF-8, and the app should be supplying the chosen filename to MLT as UTF-8. However, most libraries such as libavformat take the C string as given and pass it to fopen or similar. On Windows the string needs to be in code page encoding. In win32.c the functions mlt_properties_from_utf8() and iconv_from_utf8() use the libiconv to convert UTF-8 to the appropriate code page. Even if MLT did not standardize on UTF-8 for string properties, the file name strings must still be able to pass through XML that is using UTF-8 encoding. So, if a file name is read from XML, it must be converted to code page before handing to most libraries or C runtime.\n. Fixed in MLT for next release due early May.. This is by design because the clip does not pass the test for providing accurate seeking and cannot be used for editing. You have to convert it. Since you made this with OBS, it is important to use constant framerate in OBS encode settings; variable framerate is not accepted and might be the cause of this.\n. Since the Properties does show a duration, you might be able to use Shotcut to convert it. Open the clip, click Export and then click Export File without adding the clip to the Timeline or Playlist.\nUpdate: Sorry, this is not going to work because Export only offers Capture File with live sources and requires you to manually stop capture at the end - like working with a webcam or microphone to record something. You have to use something else to convert it.\n. I do not think this is specific to the German version. Our application toolkit (Qt) optionally supports OpenSSL by trying to load it dynamically at load time, but neither Qt or Shotcut ships with a complete set of OpenSSL DLLs due to legal restrictions. Therefore, it is finding it in your system folder (or elsewhere in your PATH for other affected users), but the versions of the DLLs it found are incompatible. Therefore, this is a system-specific problem.\nIs this issue preventing you from using Shotcut?\nWindows does not ship with ssleay32.dll and the related libeay32.dll. They were installed to your system folder by some other application, tool, SDK, or runtime. I do not want to tell you to remove those DLLs from system32 because it might affect other software on your system. However, you can try to remove those DLLs from system32 temporarily just to verify the problem goes away. Do not forget to put them back into place!\nIn the future, we hope to provide our own build of Qt instead of using the one provided by the project itself, and then I hope I can disable support for OpenSSL to prevent this problem.\n. This is a popular location to get OpenSSL DLLs for Windows (referred to by the official OpenSSL project wiki) that is not a general DLL download site that can be risky. You might be able to fix this without affecting the software that needs OpenSSL in system32 by copying the DLLs this OpenSSL package provides to the Shotcut folder. Maybe try the 64-bit version first.\n. I just noticed that my 64-bit version of the Qt Creator tool includes these DLLs in its application install folder. You can try to download this zip file and extract it into your Shotcut folder (C:\\Program Files\\Shotcut or similar).\nopenssl-1.0.2d-win32-dlls.zip\n. The next version 16.09 due Sept. 2 is using a custom Qt 5.6.1 build that does not depend on OpenSSL. Closing as resolved.\n. I require any change here to still require a grid view. So, 2. Why is it more complex? We should be able to switch between using a delegate and not, and let the model support both. With that said, just like today there is an option for no thumbnail, maybe what I will call the new \"tile view\" can have an option for no thumbnail. In the future, there could be additional columns and column options for the details view.\nI also want any change here to include an icon view where there is only a name displayed under the icon. If you are not up for that, I will work on it, but that will delay it some, naturally.\nOh, and thank you for your work on this.\n. I understand what you mean about the model. Even if the data() method can respond to both column or role, I suppose it still must have a mode to generate QModelIndex correctly for the change signals.\nAs for tile view, I meant that I call your new view the tile view - a vertical list of tiles. It too might be configurable to not show a thumbnail. Just imagine your first screenshot above without the thumbnail.\nAs for an icon view, see QListView::IconMode.\nThree modes: detail (today's QTableView), tile, and icon. (Except, in icon view mode, I think it makes little sense to not show a thumbnail.)\n. I see. I think icon view is more useful when using Playlist as a bin, which is probably a more popular use case than using it as a playlist. In that case, DND is perhaps not as important, and certainly sorting by name is useful. OTOH some people might like the ability to control ordering - e.g. while reviewing, moving more interesting clips to the beginning. I think making it static creates inconsistent usability. From user perspective, simply changing the presentation should not affect behavior so much. In that case, please leave out icon view for now. I am sorry if you put a lot of time into it simply because I asked for it.\n. Great. I like the idea of marking it \"experimental.\" I will check it out.\n. I did a quick initial review. The tiles mode has some rendering issues on Windows where I am testing it. There is always a horizontal scroll bar. If I resize the panel via splitter, then scroll bar increases (shows more to scroll) after I return to roughly same place/size. Then, when I scroll there are text rendering artifacts. Also, in this view mode, drag-n-drop to reorder clips does not work. Did you know about that?\n. > when in multitrack mode\nYou can not assume the playlist is used as a media bin simply because the project is multitrack. See Export > From > Playlist. You can still use the playlist as a true playlist. Or, another use case is to use it to stage a track and choose \"Add All to Timeline.\" So, the question is: does the user expect the sorted order to affect the sequence of those operations? Probably so, but it will not with a simple model sort. Therefore, sorting must reorder the MLT playlist.\n. Nevermind. I did not look at the code and thought you were using QSortFilterProxyModel instead of Mlt::Playlist::move. Sounds good the way it is.\n. This looks really good now! I did not experience any artifacts as before. I think the only complaint I have is that in Icons view mode, the thumbnails are too small. This is especially noticeable on the \"In and Out - Left/Right\" mode, but in general the size displayed is smaller than other view modes. What do you think?\n. I will pull this, and then you can directly commit tweaks and fixes. I gave you write access to shotcut repo so you can do that. Of course, it is nice to have major changes still reviewed separately.\n. All video tracks blend/composite with track V1, which you have hidden. Underlying all of the video tracks is a black background. This is by design. \n. producer_xml.c:on_end_filter() needs to call qualify_property( context, properties, \"results\" ), but that will screw up other filters using \"results\" that is not a filename.\n. It does qualify \"filename\" and filter vidstab also has filename; so, perhaps the vidstab filter should load from the filename property instead of results when filename ends with results.\n. We do not support builds not provided by us. Debug it on your own, or ask your package provider for help.\n. WebVfx is required, and the README is a a bit of an after thought. but I just added it. If you really do not want to include it, then I suggest you also not build the WYSIWYG HTML editor code, remove the integration of that, and thereby remove the dependency on QtWebKit module. qmelt became a dependency to get combinations of Movit GPU processing in conjunction with WebVfx working in stable manner. Oh, are you including Movit as well? I just added that to the README as well. However, at that point if not including WebVfx and Movit, I kindly request you not call the package Shotcut and to rebrand it. . I reproduce it on Windows, but interestingly not on Linux where I developed the solution to reorient the video. I also found a workaround. In Settings > Video Mode, choose something other that Automatic. That should provide me with a hint to fix it.\n. Fix will be in new release due Tuesday.\n. I find it very difficult to believe you cannot disable GPU rendering. The first thing the code does in response to that menu option is to save the new setting. I can toggle GPU processing just fine on all of my systems.\nThe FAQ explains where the registry settings are. This, in particular is:\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Meltytech\\Shotcut\\player\\gpu\nChange or set it to \"false\"\nAlso, the Windows installer has an option to \"Remove Shotcut Settings From Registry\"!\n. Thanks. I reproduced this. Also, I verified that using Size & Position filter alone does not.\n. I uploaded a new version 16.08.04 to include this fix.\n. Tomorrow, I will give you a URL for the next nightly build to try it. I am quite confident about the fix.\n. I made a new release 16.08.12 with this fix.\n. Thanks. It is fixed for next version.\n. > Wouldn't it be better to zoom, like in some drawing programs, on the center of the timeline or even on the mouse position.\nCurrently the zooming action is affected by the play head position, which may unexpectedly cause the timeline to scroll, and it would be better to be able to zoom without that, I agree.\n. This is due to a limitation in the GUI toolkit and will not be addressed.\n. > the value can't be entered, as the dot is refused as decimal symbol\nThis is working by design and will not be changed.\n\nI searched the .mlt file for \"gain\" and saw that the value 9,5 is coded in another system/scale. This value uses a comma no matter the system decimal is a comma or a dot.\n\nSee LC_NUMERIC on the root  element. That is what dictates the decimal separator for the file.\n\nSo is it possible to get rid of local parameters and hard code dot as decimal symbol in the gui?\n\nNo\n\nAlso note that this confusion doesn't exist for the second:frame separator for instance. \n\nThat is not a decimal separator and does not apply here. Colon is used for non-drop-frame timecode, and semi-colon is used for drop-frame timecode.\n. This bug report is about \"inconsistant decimal symbol representation in gui\" and the steps to reproduce and results. If that is the case, attach a screen shot, preferably highlighting the inconsistency.\nIf you want to talk about editing the XML from one locale to another, please open another bug report and attach two small XML files that show your changes. Please be aware that, if you change LC_NUMERIC from a comma to period as the decimal point, that you must also change all of the non-integer numeric values as well to use the corresponding separator.\n. It took me a while to reproduce this, but for me this only happens when I open Shotcut by double-clicking the project file in Explorer. The workaround is to start Shotcut and then use the recent view or File > Open to open the project. Can you please check if that works for you?\n. > What could be causing this to happen?\nA bug.\n\nI've run into a new issue\n\nYou have to create a new bug report for that. I am going to close this bug report when the original problem reported is resolved.\n. This is fixed for next release.\n. Thank you for your feedback, but \"it gets buggy\" is not a valid bug report.\n. 1) maybe some day, but multiple selection has a lot of weird usability corner cases too\n2) no plan at this time. The plan is to make GPU processing more viable. You might consider to transcode everything to a fast and edit friendly intermediate file format that is lossless or near lossless.\n3) We already have audio and video tracks. You can disable the audio on a video track or on a per-clip basis and place videos with audio (including a previously used one) on an audio track. If you are asking about automatically put only video on a video track and a cliip's audio on audio track when adding a clip to timeline, that might be an option someday.\n. That link gives a 404 error, and this is the Shotcut project, which is not the same as OpenShot.\n. Ok, I see it now. On my Windows and OS X systems, this operation is smooth and fast. On my Linux system, which is no modest PC and runs Linux on bare metal including OpenGL on the GPU (OpenGL is used for Timeline UI), I also experience this slow behavior. However, we use a high level UI technology for drawing the Timeline (Qt Quick), which puts many things outside of our control. We do not make OS-specific code for this, and it seems to be something specific to Linux. I am willing to re-open this as a Linux-specific problem, but it might not get much attention. :-S\n. A workaround is to copy the clip to the Source player, switch to the Source player, adjust the out point there (using the play back controls and 'O' keyboard shortcut is more convenient than dragging the trim controls), and then overwrite the last clip on the correct track of the timeline.\n. Thanks @metellius \nI tested that your second suggestion improved things and did not introduce a regression.\n. @Efenstor The issue as reported is indeed repaired. Your video just seems to be showing that timeline trimming, in general, is still not great behavior. No need to open a bug for that as I do not generally accept improvement requests as bugs. This tracker is for harder defects. Yes, we will try to improve its behavior over time.\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/issues/293\n. From the duplicate bug I just fixed today: The workaround is to first start Shotcut and then use the recent view or File > Open to open the project.\n. I believe this was caused by the bug in #293, which has since been fixed.\nIs \"base track\" V1 (if you did not rename it)? Shotcut does not provide a way to insert a video track below V1. We have not been able to reproduce \"my video track was turned into an audio track.\" If you can still reproduce the problem in v16.08.12, then please try to state them clearly.\n. I am not reproducing it either. Tried a few times. It might be very intermittent. @ldennedy please test it again like 20 times.\n. Recently, I added a crash handler for debug/development versions of Shotcut, and I ran into this crash while working on another bug. I was not able to determine exactly how to reproduce it, but the crash report did illustrate quite well a buggy part of code. So, I applied a fix for next release.\n. This is not about a completely scalable UI, but the subject. Already Shotcut and Qt work and look good on a Retina Mac running OS X. We just want it to be the same on other OSes when using a devicePixelRatio of 2.0. (Non-integer values can be awkward, and I have not yet seen Qt supplying that when using 125 or 150% in Windows 10.) To that end, in many places (on OSX), Qt multiplies pixel values used in Quick and Widgets by devicePixelRatio. Also, to that end, Shotcut already uses this ratio in most of its custom drawing code (e.g. GLWidget and ScrubBar). Most icons are 32x32 placed in a UI that specifies 16x16. When Qt applies the devicePixelRatio=2.0 at render time, then a 32x32 icon is displayed as 32x32. For this bug, as reported, it is as simple as that. I am attaching a screenshot from OS X for sake of comparison.\n\nI tend to close issues that are not hard defects in our code (or MLT) as \"wontfix\" aka \"not my bug.\" This is largely a cosmetic enhancement request that depends on Qt. I am in the process of upgrading Shotcut to Qt 5.6.1, and we will see how it helps. My Windows 10 machine has a 40\" 4K TV I use as a monitor, but due to its size I tend to run it at 125 or 150%. I will test the new build on Qt 5.6.1 at 200%.\n. Here is how Shotcut Qt 5.6.1 build looks (great!) running at 200% in Windows 10 Settings after I add one line of code to enable it: QGuiApplication::setAttribute(Qt::AA_EnableHighDpiScaling);\n\nLook at the undo and redo icons, in particular, to see HiDPI icons (redo) and not (undo). The undo icon is still at 16x16 due to a bug with Quick Controls in some versions of Qt not down-scaling icons. I am targeting an early September release 16.09 using Qt 5.6.1. I hope to be able to switch all icons to 32x32.\n. See also https://blog.qt.io/blog/2016/01/26/high-dpi-support-in-qt-5-6/\n. Closing because this it will be in next release due Sept 2.\n. Not able to reproduce. Consider making a screencast video showing the problem.\n. > I changed my display scaling from 125% to 150%, and now I can't reproduce the problem\nYou really expect that to affect it?!\n\nhowever the following problem occurred\n\nNope; that does not reproduce either. Do not reopen unless you have a screencast demonstrating it.\n. It works for me. The JavaScript code is installed to \"C:\\Program Files\\Shotcut\\share\\shotcut\\qml\\export-edl\\export-edl.js\" if you want to try to fix it and submit a patch. Would most likely be something in one of the functions near the end of the file beginning with \"MltXmlParser.\" In order to really debug it, you need node.js and see \"test-node.js\" in the \"export-edl\" folder.\n. Your XML worked for me in my Windows 10 development environment:\n```\n$ cd src/qml/export-edl/\n$ ls\nexport-edl.js  main.js  mlt2edl.js  package.json  rebuild.sh*  test-node.js\n$ npm install\nnpm WARN package.json mlt2edl@0.0.1 No repository field.\nnpm WARN package.json mlt2edl@0.0.1 No README data\ntimecode@0.0.3 node_modules\\timecode\nxmldoc@0.5.1 node_modules\\xmldoc\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 sax@1.1.6\n$ node test-node.js /c/tmp/test.mlt\n=== playlist0 ===\n001  1_mp4    AA/V  C        00:00:00:00 00:00:04:21 00:00:00:00 00:00:04:21\n FROM CLIP NAME: 1.mp4\n002  2_mp4    AA/V  C        00:00:00:00 00:00:08:16 00:00:04:21 00:00:13:07\n FROM CLIP NAME: 2.mp4\n``\n. Thank you. I was about to ask you for the application log. The important line is[Error ] MainWindow::on_actionExportEDL_triggered Uncaught exception at line 407 : \"SyntaxError: Expected token 'numeric literal'\".\nThat corresponds to this line in export-edl.js:finalVal = finalVal.substring(0,25).trim() + \"\u2026\";`\nThis file is aggregated JavaScript, and that line of code comes from dependent project xmdoc. The line looks OK from a syntax perspective; however, when viewing it with a hex editor, the string \"...\" is not simply 3 periods. Rather, it is hexadecimal e2 80 a6, which is the ellipsis character in UTF-8. I am not certain if that is the problem, but it can be interesting if you change that string on that line to use 3 periods, and see if the problem goes away. I would appreciate if you can test that.\n. Fixed in MLT for next release.\n. @sguilly I do not reproduce that. You can file a separate bug if you provide either step-by-step directions or attach a project file (preferably a small one).\n. You are using GPU processing on an incompatible system.\n. Is your Settings > Video mode set to Automatic?\nIf not, what is frame rate of your video mode and the frame rates of the clips exhibiting this problem?\n. Shotcut gets the duration and fps from FFmpeg, not MediaInfo.

When you open the source clip 1034_1.mp4, Shotcut Properties reports the frame frame rate as 25.3589, and it appears ffprobe is rounding that up. To convert the duration to Shotcut's timecode format: .09 * 25.36 = 2.2824. That matches what Shotcut says: 00:00:02:02 (two seconds and two frames). When I export it, I actually get a frame added, and the new frame rate is 25.375. Sorry, but I do not know why. This might the result of some precision loss when converting the floating point frame rate into the fractional rational that the lib requires. If I set it to 25 in Export, then I do get 25.\n\nNotice all the differences between two videos in this sc:\n\nYou are looking at a bunch of encoding settings. Shotcut is not a pass-through/copy-oriented video. It encodes things according the settings in the Export panel - not an input. This is explained in the FAQ.\n. I am not able to improve the frame rate. It is gated by when the Qt is sending me signals (callback). You have to use a Blackmagic Design SDI/HDMI peripheral to get really smooth playout. Otherwise, on my system, I think the playout is a little smoother when using DirectX (ANGLE) as the display method.\n. Settings > Display Method is only hidden when GPU Processing is enabled because GPU processing requires OpenGL.\n. Also, I have found that after switching to DirectX and restarting when prompted, it does not always switch properly. You may need to restart again manually. View > Application Log, and scroll down past most of the begin/end lines and look for:\n[Info   ] <Mlt::GLWidget::initializeGL> OpenGL vendor \"Google Inc.\" \n[Info   ] <Mlt::GLWidget::initializeGL> OpenGL renderer \"ANGLE (\n. Your mileage may vary. Both OpenGL and DirectX are high level APIs to big complicated things in the driver, firmware, and hardware. You can file a separate bug about the external monitor framerate issue if you want, but the problem reported here is resolved for next release, and I only track problem per issue report.\n. What is your GPU BTW? I do not get a lot feedback about the DirectX method.\n. Does it let you merge adjacent clips from different sources?\n. It is good to use MLT APIs where you can, but sometimes they are macro-like and make undo difficult to implement. It all depends. I will review your change soon. As far as keyboard shortcut, we can wait. If you want to be proactive about that, some times I see what some other tools such Premiere or Avid use for that, if available, and see if there is no conflict and makes sense in the context of our other shortcuts.\n. Oh, one more thing to discuss. What happens with the filters when merging?\nAlso, some users may expect a fade-out (audio and video) to propagate from the B clip to the merged clip.\n. We now have copy/paste filters, but there is something broken at the moment on it for timeline clips. I will get that working and then I will apply it on top of the change to preserve clip A's filters only. Then, I will see about making out filters on clip B special case handling.\n. I just tested it and already filters on A clip are preserved.\n. @AlexisWilke This is a merge, not a grouping function. Merging cannot keep different filters on the different sections of footage.. Non-realtime mode also enabled multi-core, frame-threaded image processing, which can explain the speed up. I do not know why you get 1fps simply playing a 1080p clip. There is definitely something wrong with Shotcut running on your Windows system with Automatic, but I do not know what that is. \n. The message comes from FFmpeg/libswscaler and the fact that rows of images in MLT do not necessarily begin on a 16 byte boundary. But this is legacy that cannot be changed now, or it will break too much existing code. The decision about way images are stored in memory in MLT preceeds the appearance of this warning message from libswscale. This is not something that will be addressed or fixed. A superficial fix could be to convert the image just before giving it to libswscale, but that has an obvious overhead as well. There is a huge amount of optimization work that can be done just as there is a huge amount of features that can be added. I do not consider a lack of optimization to be a bug a bug or defect, which is what we use this tracking system for.\n. @ltGuillaume There is nothing really can be done about the responsiveness of dragging without rewriting it completely, which I am not going to to do. I have noticed that it depends on speed of CPU and GPU of your system. On Windows, you can try to choose Settings > Display Mode > DirectX to see if it helps any. You may need to restart it again after it restarts the first time, to ensure it is really in DirectX mode.\n. Regarding the laggy reaction, there was actually a change for #294 that went into v16.10. It was to improve a specific case in Linux, but actually the change is not OS-specific and might help. Did you try the new version yet?\n. The original bug report says \"A transition (cross-fade audio, cut video) that's been adjusted afterwards via dragging begin/end point in the timeline.\" However, it appears @lnx64 does not use the same steps to reproduce - only a somewhat vague reference to splitting a slowed down section.\n\nFinal Cut doesn't add these pops... it CAN move text... doesn't cause audible pops period\n\nThank you for rubbing it in my face. Is that intended to be motivational? Because, it's not. Now, I just think you're a jerk.\n. Wow, now I am accused of being unprofessional for telling you how I did like the way you phrased things. That's OK because I largely think \"unprofessional\" is a lame claim anyways. You are correct that you have been helpful in other bug reports, and I appreciate that.; sorry I did not recognize you at first. Also, your explanation of the Final Cut comparison is sensible even if it did not come across that way the first time. Now, I realize you are volunteering to help (many others just want for more for free), but do not try to suggest you have put anywhere close to the amount of time into Shotcut that I have. I am sorry to have to point out that remark, but I sometimes wonder if people understand and appreciate the time and effort, and if this is any indication, now I know.\n. Next time, I will try to better reflect how something made me I feel instead of name-calling.\nThis problem is probably due to this MLT bug: https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/issues/69\nI think some people workaround this issue on non-contiguous clips by adding a one or two frame audio fade out and in.\n. I believe I improved this in MLT commit https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/0dbd50abe9f23cef5ea51f92b7506fdd08cf33f0\nI still get a little crackle, but better than before. We will get feedback from the people in this ticket before deciding whether to close it.\n. Duplicate of #278 \n. I have not decided to add this. There is already View > Export and a corresponding toolbar button. So, what will File > Export Video do differently than View > Export? If it does the same thing, then I really doubt it will help people who cannot already figure out how to export. It could, however, only export progressive H.264 MP4 with default settings, and use the Export panel for advanced or custom options. In any case, it is a suggestion and not a defect, and we only use this tracker for defects. So, I will close this, but you can still leave your reply with your opinion about the behavior of FIle > Export Video. Will it be confusing to some if it does something different than View > Export?\n. I hear you about the expectations and symmetry. It is trivial to make it an alias for the Export panel.  I appreciate your feedback: \"It will be more confusing with a dumbed down function there.\"\n. It DOES include it. Are you starting Shotcut correctly? On Linux, you should NOT run the binary directly. This is stated clearly on the downloads page. You need to use the launch script. Or, our build of QtWebSockets is incompatible on Manjaro.

Thank you for your contribution. One week before end-of-month I lupdate the english .ts and git push it for Transifex to pull. This batches up the string changes into a once-a-month activity for translators. Then, day before planned release I pull down the latest translations. I check if there is a new translation that has exceeded 70% and automatically include it. This will be included in the next release.\n. See commit edb150f4b\n. @metellius Even if it is possible to use qt.conf, that will not work for me because I am also going to add a menu item in Settings to choose the AppData folder. This is in addition to a command line option. Settings will switch to the INI format and save/load in there. That means there will still a system-specific setting to at least define this location.\n. I added this in a different manner in commit f4e1b0d1cdd5c19b52fe6646611422424c1ebdc6. The command line argument will be--appdata` but also includes a shotcut.ini file for the settings. It only tries to move/copy data from the old folder to a new folder when you use Settings > Data Directory > Set... and not from the command line option.\n. @metellius Can you take a look at this? It might be a regression with the recent playlist view changes.\n. Thanks @metellius ! That is correct analysis. Also, currently, we do not have the notion of a panel focus and a way to indicate it. I have not decided whether to do that as it does make the user experience more complicated.\n. I agree with your point. We'll change it for next release.\n. I reproduced this by closely watching the video to see that you removed the left hand clip. This seems to only be a problem if you add a filter when there is one clip on the Timeline. A workaround (for me) is to not remove the left clip or add another clip to the timeline.\n. This issue no longer exists as tested in v19.01.27. It was probably fixed earlier, but I do not know exactly when.. Fixed in MLT for next release.\n. It is working as intended for me. \"Position\" reflects the origin, which is the top left corner. If you adjust the top right corner, it may change the second Position box (Y) and both size boxes depending on the adjustment you make. Maybe you expect origin to be the bottom left corner or the center? If you still think it is a problem, explain more or make a screencast video.\n. sendvid.com is a very offensive service! I am going to have to do the web a favor and remove the link from your post. Sorry\nI see the problem, but I do not experience it. I do not know why it is a problem for you. This will have to wait until someone experiencing the problem offers a fix, or until more people with the problem are able to provide more information that can help understand the cause.\n. @der-mondbaer I fixed the incorrect decimal point checking on OS X:  \"A problem with your project has been detected....\"  That fix will be in the next release. However, I have not reproduced the problem with ridiculous values. From the sound of it, the filter UI is not initializing properly.\n. This is by design due to mixing. Timeline mixes all tracks down to a hidden silent track, and mixing is a sum process. See related issue #259. If you do not want that, use Playlist and no Timeline. \n. Sorry, for the wontfix noise. I was thinking about re-opening and then declined. If we do not mix with a silent track, and instead mix down to some visible track and manage that with track additions and removals, then we will still have a problem. MLT can only mix between 2 tracks - not all of them together. So, the common track used for mixing more than 2 tracks would have its level reduced multiple times, which is really bad. This is why a hidden silent track is used. It can be argued that this limitation in MLT should be fixed, but I can tell you now that it isn't going to happen due to design and size of change required.\n. A workaround is to add a gain filter to the Timeline by selecting the top, left corner of the Timeline (a.k.a. the cornerstone). This is known in some reading material as \"makeup gain.\"\n. I thought of a way to try to fix this. Not yet sure if it will be in next release 16.11 but definitely next if not.\n. See duplicate #330 for more steps to reproduce.\n. @metellius Can you help with this one? It is an interesting Qt puzzler. :-) I can see events going into TimelineDock::dragEnterEvent(), and I can even disable acceptDrops in the timelinedock.ui file to ignore that because timeline.qml:DropArea.onEntered() is firing as well under normal conditions. However, following the repro steps, dragEnterEvent() is not working to accept the drag event, and qml:DropArea.onEntered() is no longer entered to try to accept it. Strange and disconcerting.\n. Is it repeatable with steps?. I understand, but to be honest I got lucky coming up with the fix for this. Something is going wrong in the GUI toolkit (Qt), and I came up with what is, more or less, a workaround. It would not surprise me if there is a way to push it into a state where the drag events are no longer working again. There might be another place where I need to apply the workaround if we figure out the cause.. This bug is about drag-n-drop, but there are many other ways to add clips to the timeline using keyboard shortcuts and timeline toolbar buttons that are not affected by this bug. Look for words like Paste, Append, Insert, and Overwrite.. There have been multiple fixes for this and not just workarounds. See the \"closed this in ____\" lines in this Issue. I hear it may still happen sometimes, but I do not know how to reproduce it. Meanwhile, the workarounds are not only useful information but also a better editing workflow than drag-n-drop. When another sequence of steps is found then we can reopen it.. I have seen this before as well as received reports about, but either thought I fixed it or have not found a reliable way to reproduce it to work on it. After it goes away and you choose Help > Upgrade... does it appear correctly?\n. This should be fixed as of v17.11 by commit 5957ded.. I found that sometimes it is possible to make Shotcut output MLT XML with a filter that is missing timing information. This is because the filter in and out are both set to 0, which makes MLT not output that information because it thinks they are unset (applies to entire clip). It can be argued that a single frame video fade is nonsensical, and some parts of Shotcut does try to enforce a minimum 2 frame video fade. I have to think about whether to make a change deep in MLT that can be potentially regressive or change Shotcut to require minimum 2 frame fades throughout.\n. I know why, but I was just relaying some heresay, and obviously one frame does not work. Issue #314  has been significantly improved - if not 100% for lossy-compressed sources then probably less obnoxious than the bandaid approach.\n. @lnx64 It IS released. v16.11\n. It works for me on Ubuntu 16.04 with nvidia gpu driver. It also works on at least one macOS machine. This filter is quite complicated by using a Web view rendering WebGL to an offscreen buffer and integrated into the MLT engine. I know it does not work for some people, and at this time it is largely a matter of it may or may not work for you. So, we will leave the bug open, but at this time I do not know of a way to fix it as it goes deep into the guts of QtWebKit and OpenGL.\n. In my experience OpenGL interoperability is a little brittle/fragile. What do I mean by that? The app sends a bunch of OpenGL commands, which are very expressive, in the hopes that the driver+firmware+hardware does the expected thing. \nAll the Qt and WebKit dependencies are included with Shotcut and system versions not used. I do not have any advice about OpenGL alternatives for your system. There is mesa+llvmpipe, which is  all CPU-based, but its really slow especially without many cores.\n. I now have this problem on Windows 10 since v16.09 when Qt was upgraded to our own build of Qt 5.6.1 that includes QtWebKit.\n. This is a duplicate of #326.\n. This tracker is for tracking hard software defects only. Your request is heard.\n. This is related to image clips not having audio. It should get fixed with my plan for #325 to change audio mixing.\n. This was fixed in MLT for next release.\n. I just made another quick test and it works for me. You need to provide steps.. The cross-fade bug occurs when transitioning from an image to a clip with sound. My testing thus far was focused on going from a clip to image. A workaround for this is to edit the MLT XML, remove the <property name=\"accepts_blanks\">1</property> lines, reopen the project, and add a Fade In Audio filter to the transition.\nI have not found the root cause of the audio fade out problem, but you can edit the MLT XML to workaround this. For every <filter> with a <property name=\"shotcut:filter\">fadeOutVolume</property>, replace the following lines:\n<property name=\"gain\">1</property>\n      <property name=\"end\">0</property>\nwith\n<property name=\"level\">0=1; 0:-0.1=-60</property>\nTo make the same kind of fix for a fade in, use instead:\n<property name=\"level\">0=-60; 0:-0.1=1</property>\n. I hear you and agree in some ways, but we only use this issue tracker for software defects - not feature requests, shortcomings of the project, requests in general, differences of opinion with the leadership, etc. ;-) I will share more information on how to build and contribute soon.\n. See also our nightly build script:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/scripts/build-shotcut.sh\nIt relies on various dependencies and our custom build of Qt 5.6.1 with QtWebKit enabled extracted to $HOME:\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/misc.meltymedia/shotcut-build/qt-5.6.1-ubuntu14.04-x86_64.tar.bz2\nThere are some Dockerfiles in here that can help:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt-scripts/tree/master/docker\nThe other things downloaded from S3 in the shotcut-build/Dockerfile are for the Windows builds.\n. Is Settings > GPU Processing enabled?\n. There is only a \"GPU Processing\" setting that you can enable or disable, but you keep talking about \"CPU\" which can not be disabled - it is always on. When GPU Processing is enabled, then Settings  > Display Method is not available. Therefore, you seem to be using a feature marked experimental (GPU Processing) and known to be randomly crashy.\n. Turn off GPU Processing.\n. In the future, please ensure the first line of your git commit message is short. This is a general rule for git projects and not just Shotcut. I prefer <= 70 chars but git etiquette says even less. In any case, leave a more detailed message after a blank line following the short message. Thank you for contributing.\n. So, really, the reason for the XML problem you suffered is that POSIX (and QLocale) uses ISO codes whereas MinGW setlocale() on WIndows outputs something quite different, and there is no mapping between the two. :-( I try to be conservative about repairing the XML because it can be easy to get wrong and foul things up. So, I am concerned about simply requiring the XML conform to the current system locale; however, that might actually make user experience better overall. Let me think about this... Maybe, on Windows, I can require this new behavior, but on non-Windows only do this if the LC_NUMERIC attribute is not parseable by QLocale (since it was probably created on a Windows system).\n. Let QLocale try to parse the LC_NUMERIC locale attribute, and if it fails initialize new member variable m_locale to system locale. Then, require all numeric strings with decimals to conform to m_locale. If not, fix them according to m_locale, and output new XML with LC_NUMERIC based on m_locale. What do you think? Can you try that approach and test it with your documents?\n. > However, am I correct that the code as it was before would never offer to repair the file unless it contained both commas and periods?\nYou are correct.\n\nI don't see when this would happen regardless of the locale used unless the file has been edited manually.\n\nThere have been bugs in the past, particularly on Windows, where Shotcut and/or MLT could cause it to output a mixture, and this area of XML correction was added in direct response immediately  after some fixes.\n. I cherry-picked 2 of the commits and pushed a modified version of the change to MltXmlChecker. See also MLT commit https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/dce7c5bf85043822d10c477640a2862d57ace3d8\nNow, it should save new XML with LC_NUMERIC using ISO 639 and 3166 codes.. Closing because GPU Effects is unsupported without a patch/pull request. Next version 18.11 makes this more obvious.. Closing because GPU Effects is unsupported without a patch/pull request. Next version 18.11 makes this more obvious.. Thanks for the notice. The e-mail delivery service was stopped after a reboot to address security vulnerability. Please let me know if you get the e-mail soon.\n. I saw a bunch of e-mails queued and delivered.\n. You are in your own for FreeBSD.\n. It means I assume you want help by submitting a bug report. No one on the team can help you with FreeBSD. You can submit a patch or pull request.\n. This is by design. At step 3, there is nothing in Source. It is only a multitrack timeline Project. The fact that you can switch between Source and Project after step 4 is because we need to close the current project to load a new one, and close tries to close everything including Source. In this case, it does not first check if Source is empty; it simply clears it with a black clip. \n. Does the problem go away if you disable \"Parallel processing\" in the Export panel?\nI have quite a few AVCHD .mts files that do not exhibit this problem. It might be a problem specific to this particular camera. You can upload a sample file here.\n. We took a look and decided not to change anything. You must move the playhead out of the way. Changing the magnetism level will make others complain that snapping strength is inconsistent.. Disagree; keeping it as it is.\n. On Linux, you need to install the LADSPA SWH plugins. This is explained on the download page.\n. This is a request that I agree with as I have thought about it myself previously when editing. Quite simply, when playing something in the Source player, stop at the out point; so, you can more easily observe the placement of the out point. Then, if you want to keep playing beyond the out point, press play again. However, it will be a little difficult to stop playback right at the out point if the playback speed is greater than normal. Probably need to issue an additional seek to out after the stop.\n. What is your OS? This is a known issue on Linux fixed for next release. d4f9e5eb5767c26844ed975fac86e9e133f7eee8\n. It is working, but the default level for the alpha channel is 0. Thus, even if you change the color (without picking screen color), you have to increase the alpha channel level. 0 is transparent, 255 is opaque, and anything in between is a level of translucency proportional to the value. So, all you need to do after selecting a color, is remember to change the alpha. With that said, I am still going to make a change to help prevent falling into this trap/gotcha.\n. I know about this problem (first one), and I am unable to make it work due to bug in Qt for which I have not figured out a workaround.\n. I am not able to reproduce this, or it is explained poorly. Tested with v16.11 on Windows 10, macOS, and Linux. It might need specific steps or a screencast video to show.\n. @lorenzosu Thank for you making the screen cast. In your case, it is not \"fade-in point of left-most clip\" but that is OK and probably more of the same bug.. It is added, and it works for me as described. To be clear, \"copy it by clicking it\" should be \"copy the filter by clicking the copy button in the Filters panel\" (not the Edit menu or Timeline toolbar). Likewise, paste requires that you use the past button in the Filters panel.. OK, it works when copying filters on clip in Source player to a Timeline clip, but not from one Timeline clip to the next.. What is the HDMI capture device specific make and model?\nWhat is the file format, for example mp4 or transport stream, or its filename extension?\nCan you make some short samples that demonstrate the problem and upload them?\nDoes the problem go away if you do not use the timeline? You can export a playlist using the From field at the top of the Export panel.\nDoes the problem go away if you disable Parallel processing in the Export panel?\nThe problem might be rather specific to some features in the file format or codecs that are challenging the interface between MLT and FFmpeg such that compiling the source of Shotcut alone will not help.\n. Your uploads were created/exported with Shotcut, which makes it hard to debug the problem reported. It would be better to provide a short sample (only one needed for now) made with the EZCAP device. Using the files provided I can see that the second-last frame of t1-p1.mp4 is repeated twice instead of showing the last frame (00:00:10:00 and 00:00:10:01 are the same). That may or may not be the same problem as what happens on the source videos.\nAs for FPS, they are all consistent in the samples provided, my own export made from them, and the reports from ffprobe, mediainfo, and Shotcut. That problem is masked as well by not having the original. Do you think the original files are variable framerate? If so, that is not supported. (I need to find a way to detect that and limit them.). When I use mediainfo to get video duration and framerate and when I use ffmpeg to dump thumbnails from t1-p1.mp4, then I get 287 frames. However, melt -consumer xml t1-p1.mp4 reports 288 frames. (melt is the command line tool for the MLT engine used by Shotcut.) However, if I use the total duration printed by mediainfo, then I get 287.7 frames which rounds up to 288 frames. This is because the audio track is slightly longer than the video track. MLT is doing the right thing here by preserving as much as data as possible. It has in the past not rounded or used the shorter track length and received bug reports about dropping data. Thus, if I edit t1-p1.mp4 in Shotcut by trimming out the last frame, then the problem goes away. This is an editor after all; you may be expected to edit and clean up cuts. It does not matter what another editor tool does. It can be argued that it is doing the wrong thing by discarding data.\nYou may ask why did Shotcut (MLT) export with the audio slightly longer? Well, that is another issue that will muddy the discussion around this bug, but it might be related to the fact that AAC frames (codec terminology for chunk of data) contain 1024 samples. 1024/48000 (sample rate of t1-p1.mp4) gives 21 ms, but the difference between audio and video track duration in the file is 25 ms. So, the AAC frame size is not a full explanation. I can also say as the MLT lead developer that MLT, like ffmpeg, must deal with AAC encoder delay and drain the encoder at the end of the file output. This means that it feeds the encoder with null data and as long as it gets data out it tells libavformat to add it to the file. So, there is not a lot of direct control over the process there. We have tests in MLT that work with uncompressed and discrete frame format (DV) to verify integrity of MLT operations and FFmpeg libavformat integration.\n. I opened t1-p1.mp4 in Shotcut, and exported it as test.mp4 using defaults. Then, I used ffmpeg command line to convert both of them to wav files. test.wav is 42 ms longer than t1-p1.wav. I opened both .wav files in Audacity one atop the other. It is clear as day that the audio signals are in synchronization and test.wav contains 42 ms of silence at the end.\nNext, I ran ffmpeg -i some.dv fftest1.mp4 followed by mediainfo fftest1.mp4 and it shows the audio track is 32 ms longer than the video. Again, DV is a frame discrete format meaning there is no codec delays or temporal compression. Each DV frame contains one exactly video frame plus all of the audio for that video frame. This shows that H.264+AAC MP4 output from ffmpeg is adding audio data that MLT is preserving.. 1. Does the EZCAP make it difficult to start and stop to make a short sample? It looks like MediaFire will let you upload large files, but that might take a long time.\n2. I do not know if VLC reports about variable frame rate, but MediaInfo and PotPlayer does.\n3. and 4. These are all notes I made while investigating the files you provided, which may or may not apply to your actual files. It is not uncommon for temporally compressed files to have tracks where the lengths differ a little. Things for me to ponder about possible changes to make or not. It is difficult to balance different needs and perspectives.. Yes, let's start with a single short recording and see what I can find.. I downloaded the sample provided. MediaInfo says the frame rate is 30 fps, but ffprobe (part of FFmpeg) reports:\nStream #0:1(eng): Video: h264 (Constrained Baseline) (avc1 / 0x31637661), yuv420p, 1920x1080, 102 kb/s, 0.19 fps, 30 tbr, 30 tbn, 60 tbc (default)\nShotcut uses MLT, which uses FFmpeg libraries. It too can output some info (melt -consumer xml ...):\n<mlt LC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\" version=\"6.5.0\" title=\"issue356_Encode_1080P_21_15.mp4\">\n  <profile description=\"automatic\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" progressive=\"1\" sample_aspect_num=\"1\" sample_aspect_den=\"1\" display_aspect_num=\"1920\" display_aspect_den=\"1080\" frame_rate_num=\"60\" frame_rate_den=\"2\" colorspace=\"709\"/>\n...\n    <property name=\"meta.media.1.stream.frame_rate\">0.187757</property>\n...\n    <property name=\"meta.media.1.codec.frame_rate\">30</property>\nSee also the duration reported by ffprobe: Duration: 04:51:20.15 and Shotcut 04:51:20:04, which is insane.\nSo, yeah, this file is written in a manner that makes FFmpeg unable to provide accurate seeking, which is needed by Shotcut even for the simple case of joining files. Feel free to report problems about detected frame rate and duration to the FFmpeg project, but you will also need to test with the latest version. I am doing that now... output of ffprobe:\nffprobe version N-82874-g6b517a1 Copyright (c) 2007-2016 the FFmpeg developers\n  built with gcc 5.4.0 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4) 20160609\n  configuration: --prefix=/home/ddennedy/opt --enable-libvorbis --enable-libtheora --enable-libx264 --enable-gpl --enable-postproc --enable-pthreads --enable-shared --enable-version3 --disable-stripping --enable-avfilter --disable-static --enable-x11grab --enable-librtmp --enable-debug --enable-libpulse --enable-libmp3lame --enable-libvpx --enable-libiec61883 --enable-libdc1394 --enable-vdpau --disable-doc --enable-libopus --enable-libx265\n  libavutil      55. 43.100 / 55. 43.100\n  libavcodec     57. 68.100 / 57. 68.100\n  libavformat    57. 60.100 / 57. 60.100\n  libavdevice    57.  2.100 / 57.  2.100\n  libavfilter     6. 68.100 /  6. 68.100\n  libswscale      4.  3.101 /  4.  3.101\n  libswresample   2.  4.100 /  2.  4.100\n  libpostproc    54.  2.100 / 54.  2.100\nInput #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from 'issue356_Encode_1080P_21_15.mp4':\n  Metadata:\n    major_brand     : isom\n    minor_version   : 512\n    compatible_brands: qt  \n  Duration: 04:51:20.15, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 103 kb/s\n    Stream #0:0(eng): Audio: aac (LC) (mp4a / 0x6134706D), 48000 Hz, stereo, fltp, 1 kb/s (default)\n    Metadata:\n      handler_name    : SoundHandler\n    Stream #0:1(eng): Video: h264 (Constrained Baseline) (avc1 / 0x31637661), yuv420p, 1920x1080, 102 kb/s, 0.19 fps, 30 tbr, 30 tbn, 60 tbc (default)\n    Metadata:\n      handler_name    : VideoHandler\nShotcut 16.12 is using FFmpeg 3.0.4, which is several months older than this, but you can see FFmpeg still has a problem with it. So, I doubt upgrading Shotcut build to latest FFmpeg will make a difference either. As a result, I am not going to do anything to try to get these files working in Shotcut.\n. MediaInfo reports something like Frame rate mode : Variable when it is variable frame rate. The sample provided in the related ticket #356 shows some incompatibilities with FFmpeg libs.. A better workaround is to select the timeline cornerstone or track head and then re-select the clp. Or, if you are not using multiple clips or tracks, do not even use the Timeline!. Sorry, but my day job has been very busy and has left me with very little time to work on Shotcut. Meanwhile, there is a simple workaround for this.. You can use or reference the build script at scripts/build-shotcut.sh. This tracker is only used for tracking defects, and this is not one. But I will continue to allow comments although I cannot promise I will be available to help you. Perhaps if you explain why you are trying to build it yourself and your intention, I may be more motivated to help but also realize that I have very limited attention to give as well.. Upon user request/suggestion, version 16.12 now includes libjack.so.0 in the Linux app bundle. That is most likely the cause. Apparently, this is not as cross-distro safe as I expected. It looked safe according to the short list of library dependencies, but there very well could be some interface or protocol version mismatch between the client library in the Shotcut bundle and the actual jack daemon. I can easily remove it from the next version.\nFrom your Shotcut folder remove Shotcut.app/lib/libjack.so.0 and see if it works again.. Since people on insist it should work for a specific use case for which it was not designed, I will simply remove JACK support in the next release.. Sometimes, if a feature is too problematic and not essential to me or the majority, then I will make it dark until possibly some time in the future it is either revisited or scrapped. That is what is going to happen here because it is not a high enough priority to address anytime soon.. Related to #324. Some people are having a problem, but I (developer) do not. Still looking for one of my systems where this occurs to look into it.. As a workaround, use the Rotate filter without rotation because it offers \"scale\" and \"offset\" parameters that can be used to achieve the same result (but without a visual rectangle tool).. @ochilan Did you start or restart Shotcut after you changed the decimal point in Additional settings? . @ldennedy This problem also exists in the Bandpass filter.. Thanks. I have not found any file that links with libgstapp. From where did you download it? Is it possible you are trying v15.12 instead 16.12?. I just tested the binary bundle we provide in a fresh Ubuntu 16.10 virtual machine, and it works fine.\nfind ~/Desktop/Shotcut/Shotcut.app -type f -exec ldd {} \\; | grep gst reveals no linkages to libgstapp or any gstreamer library for that mater.. I approved on transifex. I do not use direct git pull requests to update translations but will pull through tx, lupdate, and then push to git.. I have not been able to reproduce it. Dragging from where? Please describe some steps.. I tried multiple scenarios on multiple computers on multiple OSes multiple times, and I still cannot reproduce it. I will wait a little while longer to see if someone else reports it perhaps with more information. Consider making a screencast video to show the problem.\n@ldennedy See if you can reproduce this.. Are you dragging from a drive other than C:? See this forum post.. This is by design to support Movit GPU processing and WebVfx.. See here https://github.com/mltframework/webvfx/tree/master/mlt/qmelt. If you build it yourself, fix it yourself. If you use distribution package, ask distribution for support. We only support our builds here.. We only use this for tracking defects, and this is a feature request. Feel free to submit a pull request against our build script.. Also, is the NVIDIA SDK compatible with GPL3? If it requires using ffmpeg configure flag --enable-nonfree, then it is not compatible.. I verified that it is not compatible with GPL and requires --enable-nonfree. Shotcut is not simply a ffmpeg command line frontend such that you can drop in whatever build of ffmpeg that you want such as one that uses nvenc. Rather, it uses the FFmpeg library APIs, which means it must be compiled in a license-compatible manner, using a license that permits free distribution.. Duplicate of #369 . This was resolved recently by the fix for #369.. I agree the depressed state is difficult to see in Fusion Dark but not Light. Unfortunately, the only control we have over the theme is to set colors, and the GUI toolkit simply makes disabled or depressed things darker such that dark -> darker is difficult to see. However, I agree there is general problem including the state of the player toolbar button. Instead of making the button \"depressed\" we can alter the image icon such that \"x\" means muted and \")))\" means not.. FFmpeg v3.0.5. You can use the ffplay that comes with Shotcut if you want to see if it specific to that version or Shotcut.. I just used the new build 17.02 to encode a lossless H.264, 1280x720p23.98, on Windows, and playing it back looked fine.. When we build, it pulls the latest/head of the FFmpeg 3.0 branch; so, it is possible that there was a fix pushed into that branch.. I have tested (basic startup and playback) v17.02 on Mint 17.2 and Mint 18.1 in virtual machines with little-to-no extra software installed, and it worked OK for me. It seems it got through most of the initialization, but it is not clear where the problem lies without a gdb backtrace.\n. I do not provide help for building. It is not easy. You should try first without building to run it in gdb and see what you get:\n$ cd Shotcut/Shotcut.app\n$ source source-me\n$ gdb shotcut\n...after crash...\n(gdb) where\nIf you really want to try to build it: run this script, but it does expect a Qt SDK installed to $HOME/Qt that includes the QtWebKit module:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/scripts/build-shotcut.sh\nHere is the custom Qt 5.6.1 SDK with QtWebKit that we use:\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/misc.meltymedia/shotcut-build/qt-5.6.1-ubuntu14.04-x86_64.tar.bz2\n. It is crashing somewhere in OpenGL as used by Qt 5 when trying to show the main window. I am running nvidia v367.57 on Ubuntu 16.04, and you already removed your settings; so, not sure what the problem is. Running Mint in a virtual machine is obviously not going to be using nvidia X driver. Maybe the last version that worked for you was before we upgraded to Qt 5.6 in 16.09. You might want to see if 16.08 works. You can have multiple versions in different folders (without space in its name, please).\n. https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/releases/tag/v16.08. v16.08 was built on a debian8 image, which gave some users compatibility problems. v16.06 was based on debian7: https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/releases/tag/v16.06\n(Recent versions using Qt 5.6.1 are built on an Ubuntu 14.04 image.). Mint has something like Ubuntu's special (proprietary) driver manager? You might try switching to the X.org nouveau driver and back. I am not sure how well nouveau works either. Or, also try upgrading or downgrading the nvidia driver.. Thank you for the good, detailed bug report. Unfortunately, I have not yet reproduced it. When you wrote \"image with text\" is the text a part of the image, or is this an image with the Shotcut Text filter applied? And for the Fade In/Out Video applied to the image on the upper track, I assume you checked \"Adjust opacity\"?. Duplicate of #278 . Shotcut does not provide a way to recover the job queue, but since you located the temp files, you can probably use the command line to process all of the temp .mlt files. Are you using Shotcut from a build provided through the shotcut web site or here on Github? If so, you can run Shotcut.app/qmelt /tmp/shotcut-Q14734.mlt in a terminal window, and so on for each file to process them. These temp files are not the project autosave, but what is written out for each job added to the queue. They are XML, and if you read them, near the top is a <consumer> block that includes the name of the output file - in case you want to see which temp file will create which output file.\nThe log file you provided shows a crash in the GPU processing code (see Settings menu in Shotcut), which is experimental and not very stable.. This is by design, and no previous version opened the file dialog every time you click +. . It adds whatever is in the Source player.\nThink about the fact that you ought to preview the file you want to use in your project. In case you are using a different tool for that, consider using Shotcut instead. You can quickly open a file, determine if it is correct, and then add it if desired. Or, even further, you ought to consider trimming the shot and applying any correction filters before adding it to the playlist. In case you really do not want to do all that, then simply drag-n-drop the file from a file manager into the playlist panel.\nAlso, the Source player tab must be selected when you click +; otherwise you get the \"You cannot insert a playlist into a playlist!\" message. (The wording of that is a little confusing I agree because more often than not your Timeline appears in the Project tab, but it also possible to have a Playlist project that does not use the Timeline.). As a result of this discussion, I will make some small changes:\nWith an empty project, + button in Playlist will be disabled such that clicking it does not open file dialog. This prevents showing the FIle Open dialog, which is inconsistent and misleading.\nTimeline allows pasting or adding from the Source player when the Source tab is not active, and it should be the same for Playlist, which prevents showing the strange message  \"You cannot insert a playlist into a playlist!\"\nChange tool tip of the + button in Playlist from \"Add something to the playlist\" to \"Add the Source to the playlist\". Waveform and thumbnail generation occurs in the background. It is not necessarily unusable depending on your machine's power. UI responsiveness does slow after generation and when the UI is updated, and there is no way around that. Progress for waveforms is already shown by incrementally growing the waveform horizontally left-to-right. Initially, it is blank and then fills in. Showing progress for thumbails would be distracting. Also, we have no way of getting progress; it goes from 0% (no thumbnail rendered yet) to 100% (thumbnail displayed). I am not exactly sure what else you expect, and you can elaborate, but I will probably close this as something I will not address.. The refresh takes place when the waveform/thumbnail data is missing. The data is stored in a database that has a limit to prevent growing big, and the oldest data is removed to make room for newer data. This is all automatic and not very deterministic. Really long clips can take a long time for the waveform generation. Maybe something else is wrong. Maybe Shotcut has used up most of your RAM and you are swapping. You can give up, stop Shotcut, and see what happens if you restart and reopen the project.. Do you realize there is only 2 thumbnails - start and end - for each video clip?\nSee the FAQ to figure out where the database is.\n\nredoing it probably won't be with Shotcut, if this issue cannot be dealt with\n\nOK with me.\n. You must use transifex.com for this:\nhttps://www.transifex.com/ddennedy/shotcut/language/zh_CN/\nI do not accept translation updates any other way at the moment because I would have to figure out a workflow that works with the other translators using that service.. Thank you. It is nice to get this translation updated.. Um, I think the logic is reversed? Basically, asserts should not cause abort in a release build.. This was the prior state:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/commit/9346b426b4d1c997bdded52c74dbe4aa65565961\nRegarding the commit message, for the Windows SDK build, I integrated DrMingw crash logging, but made this part of the change with reverse logic. Will fix this.. > So, should I propose fixes against the fork of movit, or should I try to send them upstream? Would you pick them from there once they are available?\nIt is not my intention to maintain a fork of Movit. Late 2015, Movit started requiring a newer version of OpenGL, and that conflicted with Qt and Shotcut's requirements. In Shotcut I chose to have a QuickView for the video area to overlay controls and to share a GL context with Movit to facilitate fast, direct rendering. That put me into a corner with respect to the GL version Qt 5 uses for Quick. The reason I have a git repo instead of a specific git ref upstream was to also address some instability with nightly builds against the upstream git repo.\nI have been meaning to experiment with a change where we do not take a GL texture from Movit, but make it always transfer to an RGBA buffer in CPU RAM. That would allow moving to a newer version of Movit by creating the GL context with the profile and version it needs. OTOH, that could reduce the compatibility and will certainly impact performance: GPU -> CPU -> GPU. I will try to make this experiment this weekend. What are your thoughts on this matter?\nI am not in a position now with time to give the issues you raise any assistance.\n. Here is the new branch that creates a distinct, non-shared OpenGL 3.2 core profile context for Movit. It asks Movit to render to a rgba buffer and uses a thread to upload this to a texture for the display code.\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/tree/non-shared-context-gpu\nI have not done much performance comparison, but I do see reports of dropped frames while playing 1080p23.98 material. Other than that, it seems fair performance-wise - certainly not atrocious. And this was on a machine from 2008, which is definitely mediocre by today's standards.\n. > Would this make it possible to write video scopes?\nyes, it would make it much easier than trying to implement scopes in GLSL using a GL texture from a shared context.. > the jumps I described in the forum due to threaded optimizations in the nvidia driver doesn't happen to me with the new branch\nIs that because I added the workaround to the launch script in this commit: 2a7af2b66ebf02dd64c2aaba62f4eeca2192ca18 ?. The texture leak in ResampleEffect was fixed in Shotcut's Movit branch:\nhttps://github.com/ddennedy/movit/commit/3e8b4ebb796bcbe7e9727a2d7f2d0ba8f0170dfa\nUpstream made a similar fix based on this:\nhttps://git.sesse.net/?p=movit;a=commitdiff;h=11f2afecc201d7c4c845f5782059860ce3209a28\nAlso, the bug that required turning off threaded optimizations on Linux was fixed in Shotcut: 4d4dfbf4f4a572c5fdc6b164ade318b3be1e15dc\nThis might be enough to close this bug, or we can leave it open pending the switch to upstream.. When a Movit effect adds nodes it creates to a graph, the graph becomes the new owner and deletes. The ResampleEffect was special because it is what is known in MLT as an OptionalEffect, meaning it was constructed and potentially some parameters set but ultimately not included in the graph as it was not needed. This basically applies to all the Movit-based so-called normalization filters in MLT - the ones in src/modules/core/loader.ini. There are a couple of other OptionalEffects that should be checked for the same problem.. Closing because GPU Effects is unsupported without a patch/pull request. Next version 18.11 makes this more obvious.. Closing because GPU Effects is unsupported without a patch/pull request. Next version 18.11 makes this more obvious.. I have not been able to reproduce the crash yet, but I am on Windows 10 with NVIDIA (GTX 980 Ti). The reason I mention the GPU is because the Timeline uses OpenGL for drawing, and this bug might depend on your GPU drivers. I do reproduce the black Timeline window. What is your GPU? If you use Settings > Display Mode > DirectX (which uses an OpenGL to DirectX mapping library called ANGLE), does the problem go away, or are you already using that?. I will see if I can reproduce it on some other systems including other operating systems.. Also not reproduced on Linux with v18.01. . Was never able to reproduce and too old now.. It is available in the builds we provide. We do not make every build out there and can only support the ones we provide. You need to raise this issue with whoever made your build.. Thank you. I was just working on this, and I was making a part for the desktop file installation. It has not been clear to me from the docs about the magic of the gui subdirectory and the purpose of the icon declared in snapcraft.yaml.. Ugh, this did not work!\nddennedy@MS-7593:~/src/shotcut/snap$ ls -l /snap/shotcut/\ntotal 0\ndrwxrwxr-x 10 root root 236 Feb 12 14:14 3\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   2 Feb 26 11:44 current -> x1\ndrwxrwxr-x 10 root root 236 Feb 26 11:38 x1\nddennedy@MS-7593:~/src/shotcut/snap$ ls -l /snap/shotcut/x1/meta/gui\ntotal 0. I figured out the subdirectory needs to be setup/gui and fixed in commit 3a5f8dfdaccda87fab8451140690124065d9483b. This depends very much on the file format, tool used to create the file, and sometimes the specific file. Shotcut uses FFmpeg to get the length and to read the file. Shotcut v17.02.05 uses FFmpeg v3.0.6 and the next version will use v3.2.4. You need to confirm the problem by running ffprobe against it to see what length it reports. You can use the ffprobe that comes with Shotcut, or use another version to compare results. Ultimately, you may need report the bug to the FFmpeg project, but you will need to provide a sample file.\nAlso, you can try to override the duration in Shotcut using the Properties panel.. This is a known issue but out of our control with the GUI library we use. Sorry. Maybe it will work in the future on an upgrade to the library.. Did you use the \"GIF Animation\" preset? That works for me.\nIt is not enough to change only the Format field in the Export panel. There are many combinations that can be created in Export that will fail. You need to be more specific. Explain how you export to GIF.\n. Shotcut UI crashed or the export job? I do not reproduce either, and I was using v17.03 on OS X 10.11 with the same video mode. Not sure what is wrong.. GIF Animation export is completely broken since v17.09 when upgrading FFmpeg and will be removed in v17.11. The latest version 17.03 starts up in DirectX mode by default unlike previous versions. This is an attempt to improve compatibility. I guess that will better for some and not for others. Get the previous version and start it. If it starts successfully, change Settings > Display Method to OpenGL. Then, try running 17.03. Does it work now?\n. I will be on the lookout for how worse it may be to default to directx, but the change was made to try to actually increase compatibility, based on problem reports from past year.. This looks like a Qt HiDPI problem, which is rather problematic on Linux. You need to try running Shotcut from the command line after running export QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=0 However, I am not sure if that environment setting works with snap.. This is already fixed in the latest version of Shotcut. That is an old version.. I have not reproduced this; tried multiple times. I doubt the OS version makes a difference. I will also check it on other OSes.. Works for me. Specify your version of Shotcut and OS.. Does the file you are trying to use have variable frame rate? That is not supported, but we do not yet have a way to detect that and prevent using it. You can use the program MediaInfo to find out. Can you share one of your smaller files that exhibits the problem?. @Steini- Is your video variable frame rate? Shotcut tries to detect it and shows \"(variable)\" next to the frame rate in Properties, but it is a simple heuristic and not foolproof detection. Using MediaInfo to check it as well is helpful. This is still open because developers have not reproduced it.. Shotcut can only change the speed of a single clip at-a-time, whichever one is selected if the player is in Project mode or the clip loaded in Source if the player is in Source mode. Can you explain which mode you are in or show a screenshot of the Properties panel just prior to changing the speed?. Interesting, I only have 10.12.3 (16D32). When I get the next version, I will see what happens for me.. A workaround is to delete /Applications/Shotcut.app/Contents/MacOS/lib/ladspa/imp_1199.so\n. This is fixed in the v17.04 due in a couple of days.. Fixed in MLT git commit https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/3b049b75cd7ca8c0d75d1d4e603428066a82755f. Dude, I have not even updated the web site. All the little things for a new release are not perfectly synchronized.. Currently, this is by design whether you like it or not. The toolbar buttons open a panel; the panel close button closes it. These are generally not toggles and making them appear like toggles makes them look ugly.. This should be fixed now. Reopen if not.. feature request, not bug. I think the only real reason was to make it easier to see and work with the out point in the Source player. Showing out = 4 seconds (default) out of, say, 2 hours, makes it a little hard for noobs to notice the out point and to drag it as needed. However, likely these users are just as likely to not trim in the Source player and instead drop into timeline and drag right edge to adjust.. This is fixed by duplicate #428 . The problem exhibited in the uploaded XML files as described by @ochilan can be reproduced by changing the Windows control panel Region > Additional Settings > Decimal Symbol to something inconsistent with the named Format. I was not able to reproduce the reported problem, but this region number format override is not currently supported by Shotcut (or apparently the cross-platform technologies it uses). When I tried to reproduce it by using Format = German, Decimal symbol = period; in the Shotcut Application Log I see\n[Info   ] <Application::Application(int&, char**)> locale = QLocale(German, Latin, Germany)\n...\n[Debug  ] <MltXmlChecker::MltXmlChecker()> decimal point ','\nAs you can see, it did not read the Decimal symbol setting, which is retrieved using a third party library.\nTo fix it, you can try this:\n1. Open the Windows Region control panel.\n1. Click Additional settings...\n1. Click Reset...\n1. Click Yes, OK, and OK\n1. Restart Shotcut if it was already running. Further, MLT, was able to see the decimal point setting in order to write the XML with numbers with periods. However, the Shotcut MLT XML validation function was not. Then, after loading the XML, MLT is still using the system decimal point setting even though Shotcut converted them to something consistent with the named Region. It seems the solution is for Shotcut's XML validation function to use the same approach as MLT for looking up the decimal point.. I have an attempt to fix this, and I can provide a nightly build tomorrow for you to check it.\n. Here is the nightly build for Windows to try:\nhttp://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-win64-170417.zip\nUnzip this somewhere and double-click shotcut.exe within the folder to run it.\nIf it does not work with an existing project, you might try to create a new project and then also see if the repair offer goes away upon re-opening the project.\n. Thanks, I will close this now as resolved for the next release. . For the bad one, you need to verify that the Analyze step completed successfully as it appears that did not run or complete successfully. Find a \"bad one\", click Analyze, and see if the message \"Click Analyze to use this filter\" goes away. If it does, save the .mlt, reload it, and let us know if it works now.. OK, thanks, that gives us a more tangible repro target. I will try several files and file types.. Closing because GPU Effects is unsupported without a patch/pull request. Next version 18.11 makes this more obvious.. What is the resolution of the video clip, and what is the Shotcut Settings > Video Mode set to?. I believe I reproduced this, and it is regression introduced in Shotcut v17.03. Can you test if the problem occurs in v17.02 for you, to confirm this? You can get it from here and you do not have to uninstall current version to use it.. This caused by videos with certain widths and the sliced pixel format conversion we started using since a couple of Shotcut versions for performance improvement. The sliced pixel conversion is using FFmpeg library swscale, and some optimizations in it may be overwriting neighboring bytes and pixels when the slice width is not some multiple of 8. With a video such as this, if I set environment variable MLT_AVFORMAT_SLICED_PIXFMT_DISABLE=1 while running Shotcut, it turns off the sliced conversion, and the problem goes away. I probably need to come up with a heuristic in the MLT avformat module such that if the last slice is not some multiple of 8, 16, or 32; then, we not use slices.. Fixed in MLT for next release 17.06. See #361 for point 1, which is resolved for next release.\nFor point 2, I test primarily with Qtractor as I understand it better; however, I do not reproduce this delay with it. Some day I may get around to testing with Ardour. Just wanted to give an update.. This is not a defect; it is an enhancement request. Also, it is unrelated to this specific resolution; rather, it depends on the format and compression. 1080p ProRes and DNxHD seek much quickly more than AVCHD. See the FAQ for more information about seek speed. If you want to to try to improve it, see producer_avformat.c in MLT source code and possibly also FFmpeg/libavformat. However, be aware that seeking to the closest key frame will be faster but not accurate, and we require frame accuracy.. Variable frame rate is not supported. You need to convert it to edit it. This is a typical problem for video editing software. Unfortunately, we do not have a good way yet to determine if a file is variable frame rate to warn the user.. No plans at the moment. You can change the capture tool to use constant frame rate, but AFAIK Shadowplay does not support it, but OBS does. If you are going to convert it, you can convert it to something lossless or visually lossless that is also faster and more reliable than H.264 for editing anyways.. Shotcut does not support Vista:\nhttps://www.shotcut.org/download/\nhttps://www.shotcut.org/FAQ/#what-are-the-minimum-system-requirements\n. When I run it manually on development workstation, it works, but on the automated build machine, it says there are 0 translations!\n[05:00:55] :     [Step 1/1] Updating '/root/shotcut/src/shotcut/src/../translations/shotcut_zh_CN.qm'...\n[05:00:55] :     [Step 1/1]     Generated 0 translation(s) (0 finished and 0 unfinished)\n[05:00:55] :     [Step 1/1]     Ignored 1449 untranslated source text(s)\n[05:00:55] :     [Step 1/1] Updating '/root/shotcut/src/shotcut/src/../translations/shotcut_zh_TW.qm'...\n[05:00:55] :     [Step 1/1]     Generated 1446 translation(s) (1444 finished and 2 unfinished)\n[05:00:55] :     [Step 1/1]     Ignored 3 untranslated source text(s)\n. My mistake; it is not updating on my workstation; I was running lupdate instead of lrelease. I just downloaded a new translation from transifex.com, and committed it in 14c80e97163bfba25ed7ded0fe37a173d17e25a7. It should be fixed for the next release.\n. Here is a qm file for people to use in the meantime. It goes in shotcut/share/translations.\nshotcut_zh_CN.qm.zip\n. Confirming the next release will contain this fix.. I do not think there is anything we can do about that. And what is this strange -1 in the version? We do not provide support for other parties' builds.. And the same incompatible machine/environment. Shotcut is not intended to be compatible with all systems. The OpenGL requirement imposes that. . You should see if v16.08 still works as 16.09 upgraded Qt:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/releases/tag/v16.08\nAlso, report the output of glxinfo | grep OpenGL\n. Right now you have to add the image multiple times to the track. Obviously, using the 10 min. stretched version is easier; use Timeline Copy and Paste to make that easier. I will change the max duration for the next version to 4 hours.. Use the 64 bit version on a 64 bit OS! 32 bit is very memory constrained. I doubt this will be addressed (not planned by me) unless you can fix it. . P.S. There was a period where I removed the 32-bit issues because I did not want to deal with the memory limitations and bug reports like this. I only brought it back because the nuisance level of people asking for 32-bit was so high.. You can also download a ready binary build from github or the website.. This is not available in Shotcut, and there is no \"watermark\" in Shotcut. Maybe you are asking about MLT and posted to the wrong bug tracker. In any case, this is also difficult to do in MLT and outside the normal usage scenarios. If you wish to continue down this route in MLT, then you need to become a MLT expert, and I am not available to help you. There is an undocumented MLT producer named \"abnormal\" that is a variation of the normally used \"loader\" producer. The loader producer attaches the so-called normalizing filters defined in loader.ini, but the \"abnormal\" producer does not..  I reproduced this with your XML and my own media. To workaround the problem, disable Parallel processing in the Export panel.\nThe bug seems due to the first video item being a picture with the Text filter applied to it. If I swap the first two clips (pictures) on V1, then it does start with parallel processing enabled, but then gets stuck at 1% on the image with Text. Also, if I change the text on the first clip to reduce the length (remove last line and blank line above it), then it works as well (with parallel processing).. 3D Text is very problematic; see the open issues regarding it. Does it work\nif you do not include or use it? Does it work if it is not first?  no one\nhad been able to improve its compatibility or robustness.\n. @MikeWallaceDev There is not enough information to reproduce your problem. It looks like you are using AppImage on some Linux. Correct me if wrong. \"from the command line (via an image)\" is a strange way to say it. Be more precise. The AppImage works fine for me on Ubuntu 18.04. I do not know what is wrong for you.. 3D Text filter is a rich feature that very much depends on your system. It works for me (on Windows 10) with Settings > Display Method = OpenGL or DirectX. By \"rich\" I mean that it is using WebGL in a HTML-based filter, and the web runtime for that will vary quite a bit in its ability to support WebGL based on your graphics card and driver. I see from your log that you are using Display Method > DirectX (or Automatic, which happened to select DirectX). You can change that to OpenGL to see if it makes a difference.. As an explanation for the errors you reported in your log, it is normal to see these messages after adding the filter. They appear after the filter is added but before the \"resource\" property is set, which is the HTML source for the filter. They are generally harmless errors.. There is no way to resolve this. The only thing to do is realize this filter does not work well on your system and not use it. I can add something like \"(unstable)\" after the filter name if you think it will help others (except there is already \"(HTML)\" after the name and adding more adds clutter). One can argue to remove it, but others who are using it successfully will complain.. I agree it would be nice to be more graceful, but it is far from easy improvement to make. Hence, this bug remains open until such time I or someone can improve upon that.. Is the distortion a crackling sound like clipping - if you know what that is?\nSee this blog post about the audio mixing:\nhttps://www.shotcut.org/blog/new-release-1612/\nIf so, try reducing the volume a little on each of the clips involved in the transition to see if that helps.. More than likely this is because the overhead of processing the transition is causing the playback not to keep up with real time. The engine tries to drop rendering video frames to reduce overhead and keep the audio continuous; however, it still renders a video frame every second just to make it appear that video is not stuck or broken. Not only is transition processing an overhead but also seeking to the in point of a new clip has an overhead if the clip has an inter-frame compression as most files do these days - even from cameras. Next, if you have disabled Settings > Realtime, then the distortion is even more prevalent because then there is no skipping of video frame renders to attempt to keep audio continuous.\nI hope that helps explain it to you and others. If things seem choppy or laggy, then it is a really good idea to export and play it to be sure. It is recommended to export your project periodically during its development any ways just to be sure the software is not experiencing a problem. We try hard to make it What You See Is What You Get, but sometimes there is a \"Might\" thrown in there. :-P\n. This is a known issue with the dark theme with no plans to fix. If it bugs you enough; use a different theme.. No. Last I heard Debian is making one.. We use transifex.com to get translations from volunteers. Is there any chance you can join the Italian team on there and make the change? If not, I can try it out relay this message.. The from address is noreply@shotcut.org (forum is unable to receive e-mail).\nThe forum admin screen has an e-mail test function, which I just used to send e-mail to myself. I will use that with the e-mail address you registered. I do not see a general e-mail delivery problem, but I can manually activate you (I found your user account).. Let me know if you received any e-mails yet or need manual activation.. I manually activated user gjc\n. Now, I have activated i2snap as well. The forum software says you are active. There is nothing more I can do outside of debugging it, which I am not volunteering to do. . Unable to reproduce. Maybe you need to share a short file that exhibits the problem or there are steps needed.. Thank for you for reporting this and good find. Since it is not simple to replace an image sequence with a new one, I am making a change to simply skip checking for a missing file if the resource property appears to be an image sequence.. August 2 (see Milestone above and to the right). Shotcut uses OpenGL technology for drawing parts of its UI, and that appears to be incompatible with the OpenGL implementation provided by your GPU and its driver. Sorry, this (OpenGL code) is not something we directly control but rather indirectly through Qt 5. I do not have a fix for it.. Interesting. If you figure out what puts it into this bad state, please let us know! As I am unable to reproduce it, I will close this in the meantime.. There is no cross-platform way to do this, and it is not very important (nice to have). There is a way using the cross-platform toolkit that Shotcut uses that works on Windows and macOS only, but on Windows it assumes you are using explorer.exe, which is the clear majority but not everyone. Undecided.. If you open a video and add the Circular Frame filter, does it work?. WebVfx as a producer in Shotcut is known to be a little unstable, which is how you are using it. It is more reliable as a filter. I am curious to know if on your Zesty system if the PyOhio index.html loads with the Overlay HTML filter.. What is your version. This was fixed in v17.06 and the latest version is 17.08, which I just tested and it works for me. I can see you are using an older version in the screenshot because they are not perfectly sorted alphabetically (Greek appears before French), which is something fixed in latest version.\nDuplicate of #426\n. You must enable the OpenGL option under Settings > Display Method.. The GPU is not used for decoding or encoding at this time. It is currently only for select filters and transitions. This is not a defect; it is by design based on the current state of development. Use the forum for further general discussion about what you want and expect.. I just double-checked the version 17.08.01 tarball, and the launcher is correct and working. Again, you must run Shotcut.app/shotcut (or use the icon if it works with your desktop file manager). Running Shotcut.app/bin/shotcut directly is not supported. Stubbornly repeating your agenda will go nowhere. If you are going to respond, you must clearly show what you are running.\n. I noticed this too. I wonder if I updating the MLT module to the use the newer APIs will resolve it. . This is fixed in MLT git commit 0f8e807aa911c53e221e940556370ee983f49c64\nI might make another 17.09 release. Haven't decided yet... This is a problem with how Shotcut is built on FreeBSD, and we do not make the FreeBSD build. One thing to look for that I have seen in some Linux distros (and you can relay to the bugzilla bug you reference) is that MLT or a frei0r plugin might be linking to OpenCV, which is linked to Qt4 for something. Look for a libmltopencv.so MLT plugin or frei0r plugins facebl0r and facedetect. You can easily move those files out of their current directory so they are no longer located and see if helps.. There is a good chance this is related to this MLT issue: https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/pull/262. I reproduced it by simply using a SMPTE color bar generator in File > Open Other, setting an out point in the Source player, and exporting - no need to use encoded clip as source or Timeline. (Helps me narrow down potential sources of error and further implicates the avformat consumer.). I can confirm that the linked MLT pull request fixes this issue. With DNxHD, I get this from MediaInfo:\n```\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : I:/bug451-pcm-2.mov\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nCommercial name                          : DNxHD 185\nFormat profile                           : QuickTime\nCodec ID                                 : qt\nFile size                                : 110 MiB\nDuration                                 : 5s 0ms\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Constant\nOverall bit rate                         : 185 Mbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf57.56.101\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : VC-3\nCommercial name                          : DNxHD 185\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nCodec ID                                 : AVdn\nCodec ID/Info                            : Avid\nCodec ID/Hint                            : DNxHD\nDuration                                 : 5s 0ms\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 184 Mbps\nWidth                                    : 1 920 pixels\nHeight                                   : 1 080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:2\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 3.540\nStream size                              : 109 MiB (99%)\nLanguage                                 : English\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : PCM\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Little\nFormat settings, Sign                    : Signed\nCodec ID                                 : sowt\nDuration                                 : 5s 0ms\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 1 536 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nStream size                              : 938 KiB (1%)\nLanguage                                 : English`\n```\nbeauty, eh?\nWe just need to fix a little regression in that pull request to merge it, but it should be done by next release due in about a week.. This is fixed in MLT as good as it is going to get for now. AAC output shows in MediaInfo as 5s 13ms because AAC requires a multiple of 1024 samples, and we try to include all audio data instead of truncating. Doing the math shows 5s 3ms would be the ideal, and there is an extra AAC frame, which might be a side effect of the encoder. (AAC codecs have something known as \"codec delay\" and must be drained.). Does it work to load something other than Produkt_tovorni_program.mlt?. I do not know why it does not work for you. It works for me on all the systems in my house and hundreds of thousands of others based on the download counts. See the FAQ for some possible reasons. It is known that Shotcut does not work on all systems as it has certain OpenGL or DirectX driver requirements. Also, some software installed on the system could be interfering, and nearly every system is different in that regard. Be sure to try all options under Settings > Display Method. With that said, I have generally had good compatibility experience with Nvidia hardware and drivers as I use them quite a bit myself.. I reproduce it but only on macOS. A workaround is to use more force/stronger gesture or to use the scroll bar.. Are you using a build provided by the Shotcut website or here on Github? It does not look like it since it is using system installed Qt 5. If you are, then you need to use the provided launch script instead of running bin/shotcut. We do not provide support for other people's builds, but we may accept a pull request from someone maintaining a build.. I appreciate your enthusiasm to maintain a RPM spec, but we are not available to debug other people's builds. I know how the Linux communities and distros tend to operate as I have been around it for a while, but I reject it for this app. This is the policy I have taken to prevent being dragged into debugging everyone's build problems, unique combinations of versions of dependencies, and all the different distros and their packaging systems. Those activities are a major time suck and demotivating work for volunteer developers. So, take my build if it works for you, or make and support your own. Again, if you have a change that you want to include to avoid maintaining your own patches or fork, I am open to that.. Thanks, I am actually working on upgrading Qt to 5.9.2 for the next release of my builds.. Icons are compiled as a Qt resource and bundled into the executable:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/src/src.pro#L269\nQML files, however, are loaded from filesystem location relative to executable ../share/shotcut/qml\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/src/qmltypes/qmlutilities.cpp#L64\nShotcut source is currently written primarily for relocatable app bundles and not system installation. Changes to make it more compatible with system installs requires contribution (pull requests).. Probably related https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/issues/250\nI will look into this soon.. I believe I finally reproduced this today through a methodical test using the same 23.976 fps clip with burned-in timecode on two video tracks, splitting and lifting pieces from V2, saving, and opening the project. Occasionally, some of the blanks that get inserted during the \"lift\" operation are one frame too long. I am still looking for the root bug.. This is at least partially fixed as far as what @AleksMx reported and the related issue #479, which is resolved. There might still be something wrong mixing footage with differing frame rates that I have not yet reproduced; so, leaving this open longer for more investigation.. Build help is not provided outside of referring you to scripts/build-shotcut.sh. This occurs when the video clip is something other than 25 fps (and Automatic video mode as mentioned above). The problem is seen event after the first step: the player shows accurate duration, but the playlist in details or tiles mode has incorrect duration.. This is a preview problem (playback within the app), and it is exporting fine. So, you can still edit video and get something usable out, but I do agree it is annoying and will look into it further as this affects all videos and music and not just your file.. The strange thing about this bug is that I do not reproduce it on any of my development workstations including my MacBook, but I do on a MacBook at work. On that one mac where I reproduce it, Shotcut 17.08.01 does not exhibit this problem while 17.09.04 does. Two big things changed that could account for this: FFmpeg and SDL were upgraded. SDL is used for audio output; so that is more likely. What is also interesting is that running /Applications/Shotcut.app/Contents/MacOS/qmelt to play the file (command line tool to MLT engine of Shotcut) plays without the clicks.\nIt will be useful if you as well can verify v17.08 works better on your computer:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/releases/tag/v17.08. Duplicate of #361 and I am just going to remove support for JACK since I cannot get it right and it's just a nuisance at this point.. Unable to reproduce using Shotcut 17.08 or 17.11 on both macOS 10.12.6 and Windows 10 with both GPU Processing enabled or not. Is GPU Processing enabled?\nPending label means I may close this after a few weeks if no progress is made.. GPU processing is an unsupported feature clearly marked \"experimental.\" I will not be looking into this any further at this time.. Shotcut was born to be cross-platform and easy to download and run. My experience with Kdenlive on macOS and MacPorts and what I had seen of other KDE ports to Windows made me specifically not want to use KDE. I wish Kdenlive had chosen to remain focused on Linux and BSD. Shotcut also came at a time when I needed to tease out the new cross-platform capabilities of MLT in conjunction with new technologies in the form of WebVfx, Movit, and Qt5 while Kdenlive development appeared to have died. I did not wish to exercise those things in a large complex codebase I do not know that well.. It does already reduce very much; however, maybe it is being constrained by some panel and its default placement. Close all panels except the Timeline and let me know if that helps. Also, are you running any sort of HiDPI setup? That can be a factor. View > Application Log... shows the DPI the app is trying to use, for example:\n[Info   ]  device pixel ratio = 2 . See this forum post about overriding device pixel ratio:\nhttps://forum.shotcut.org/t/interface-fonts-way-to-small/312/2. OK, this is determined by some heuristic in Qt. We plan to upgrade to Qt 5.9.2 soon, and maybe it will be improved.. Read the FAQ topic\nhttps://www.shotcut.org/FAQ/#why-is-stepping-frame-by-frame-repeating-the-same-frame\n. It is a work-in-progress for the past couple months, but I have a problem with it still (integration problem, not Movit itself) blocking it.. It is possible that using \"Size & Position\" filter in conjunction with \"Crop\" filter on a clip will have a problem, and I see you are doing that. It would be good if you can locate each of those and remove Crop (do not save or make a backup copy of the .mlt), see if it helps, and report back. Also, try turning off Export > Parallel processing to see if that helps.. I tried to create a similar but much smaller composition based on the description and some of the XML, but I have not yet reproduced the problem. I tried to reproduce from your project by substituting my own media, but that is being difficult and time-consuming. I will test it again tonight while I sleep.. OK, just a note that my overnight export test succeeded with parallel processing. However, I had to use my own media, which I gave long files but perhaps not always long enough. I will add a FAQ topic that says if export fails try without parallel processing as this is not the first time it was used as a workaround.. It works for me (lead developer) on Fall Creators Update on a system with GeForce 970ti. Your problem is likely related to the display driver but not entirely sure. I tested all of the Display methods in Settings as well as GPU Processing enabled and disabled. It is difficult to debug, and it is unlikely that the log will be helpful. The FAQ explains how to get the log - it also depends on whether you have set an alternate location using Settings > App Data Directory. I recommend that you run the installer to reinstall and when you get the step with a few check boxes, click the checkbox to Remove Shotcut Settings from the Registry. Alternatively, the FAQ explains the registry location if you want to manually remove them yourself. You can also try updating the graphics driver with an installer provided by Nvidia.\n. It looks like it might be having a problem with the Leap Motion controller integration. Use Windows Resource Monitor  > Network > Listening Ports to see if anything is listening on TCP port 6437, and if so what.\nI might need to make a setting that requires you to turn it on instead of simply trying to connect to this driver's WebSocket port and hoping it errors out if there is a problem. \n. I worked on the \"another thing,\" but it was not stable enough to include in the next release. It is something I have been meaning to do for a while. I parked the changes into a local branch to revisit.. The split occurs at the beginning of the current frame. When paused, the playhead is showing the beginning of a frame's duration. The player cannot play the moment after the last frame of a project. If you split at 01:00 and 02:00, move the playhead to 01:00, and remove the middle piece, the playhead does not move to 00:29 because it has something to play. I am not going to change anything here. I am not going to try to make the player be able to go the the moment in time just after the last frame and what? show black that is not in the project? show the last frame even though it does not exist at that time?. It works for me. Is GPU processing enabled in Settings? Is the filter applied to a clip in Source player, clip in Playlist, clip in Timeline, track in Timeline, or the entire Timeline?. Your snap environment is unable to provide an adequate OpenGL context. From the log\n[Warning] <> QQuickWidget: Failed to make context current\n[Warning] <> QQuickWidget::resizeEvent() no OpenGL context\nOpenGL under snap is problematic especially with nvidia driver. I do not know about \"amdgpu-pro\" but you can search about it. There is nothing I can do as I will not remove the OpenGL requirement.. Help with building is not provided. You can use the 64-bit Windows SDK we provide to work on the code to make code contributions that will then show up in all other build flavors:\nhttps://www.shotcut.org/notes/windowsdev/\n. This is fixed for the next release in a day or two in MLT git commit https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/9e9a86a1214585259868448ba8477655e93d993c. See #130. The Text filter is incompatible with GPU processing, and a fix has not been found; so, it is intentionally disabled for now when GPU processing is on. You can try using the HTML filter instead.. @JazzTp Thanks for the compliment. We would like Text and Stabilize to work in GPU mode, but that is unfortunately not the case and they need debugging. \"GPU Effects\" means some of the filters have a  GPU counterpart (not always equivalent parameters) but also most CPU-based filters are also available. Using both GPU and CPU filters has performance overhead due to memory transfers, which is why we group them in the list of added filters - to limit the transfers. GPU Effects also means GPU (actually, OpenGL) is also used for track compositing (no blend modes yet) and transitions.. This is not a defect, and help with building is not provided. If you want to help contribute to the code, you should consider using the information here: https://www.shotcut.org/notes/windowsdev/. Thanks! I checked it out, and it works even in GPU mode.. It does release memory, but not 100%. Here is what I found on 64-bit Windows 10 loading a small single track timeline project and measured simply using Task Manager. Loading the project and playing it through consumes 217.6 MB. Subsequent reloading and playing it consumed an additional 28 - 40 MB each time. On average, roughly 15% of memory was leaked upon reloading and playing the project.\nI admit this is a bug, but I am not going to work on it right at this moment, and I do not have much advice to offer at this time. I think the \"many variables were static local variables\" are singletons, which are not reconstructed by design and unrelated to the problem. More than likely, some references to MLT objects are not being released. When I say \"reference\" I mean that logically, not literally a C++ reference. MLT is a reference-counted C framework. Its C++ wrapper uses constructors and destructors to increment and decrement the reference count. It may be that Shotcut is not deleting some pointers to MLT objects. It may be that some MLT objects are not releasing references to other MLT objects.. See also in MLT https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/issues/271\n. Unable to reproduce with this very poor description. I have no idea what you are saying. Nothing changed recently with PNG.. This is tricky because:\n- JACK does not support reverse or trick play (not 1X speeds). See docs. It is basically just start, stop, and seek.\n- Shotcut both sends JACK transport commands and receives them.\n- Sending a JACK start or stop command results in receiving two events in response! (depends on clients?)\n- Sometimes multiple commands need to be sent such as stop and seek.\n- A seek command may result in an addition stop command in response.\nI can make it so that rewind or fast forward does not tell JACK transport to start. Also, I can fix seek operations by telling JACK to stop. I am working on adding a guard to prevent processing a received command in response to sending one.. It is working good for me after the changes even when not using transport sync with another client.. thanks. The order is not determined by Shotcut code as much as the Quick scenegraph. You should know that there is definitely an intentional chunking of the waveform. However, your output does indicate there seems to be some redundant or unnecessary calls.. The libavutil default channel layout for 4 channels is 4.0 and not quadraphonic; yours matches quadraphonic:\nhttps://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavutil/channel_layout.c#L84\nhttps://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavutil/channel_layout.h#L91\nAlso, I do not want to expose >6 channels at this time as some important encoders, particularly ac3, do not support it:\nhttps://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavcodec/ac3.h#L31\n. When trying to test this branch on Windows against the new sdl2_audio consumer that was just merged, I only get silence with 2 or 6 channels in settings. With 2 channels in settings I get\n\n[Info   ]  [consumer sdl2_audio] Unable to output 2 channels. Change to 6\n[Info   ]  [consumer sdl2_audio] Audio Opened: driver=wasapi channels=6 frequency=48000\n\nWhen testing with melt at command line with -verbose and channels=2 or 6, I get sound and the same warnings. So, I guess these APIs require to open with all channels and use which channels you need.\nI do not have external monitoring through decklink enabled.. Changing GLWidget::reconfigure() to prefer rtaudio over sdl2_audio, the sound works with both 2 and 6 channels. However, pause and resume makes it crash. Did you know a debug build of Shotcut integrates DrMingw, which upon crash appends to a file named \"shotcut.RPT\" in the same dir as the exe? Here is the dump from it for this crash:\n```\nError occured on Wednesday, March 28, 2018 at 21:13:53.\nshotcut.exe caused an Access Violation at location 0000000000000000 DEP violation at location 0000000000000000.\nAddrPC           Params\n0000000000000000 000000007A964820 000000003837A5CE 000000007E2AB130\n0000000049281F8F 00000000081E9EF0 0000000100000000 0000000000000000  libmltrtaudio.dll! ??

Versions newer than 3.2 are not detecting winpthreads on windows build. I need to debug that first.\n\nP.S. It is FFmpeg without M captitalized. ;-). Per the thread, after this, the property \"row-mt=1\" needs to be added to our vp8/9 export profiles?. I tested last night's build of Shotcut for Windows by selecting the WebM VP9 preset and adding \"row-mt=1\" in the Export > Other tab. It works great! A 3.5 minute 1280x720 video took 4:00 to export, while with row-mt=1 only 2:11.\nUnfortunately, after the FFmpeg updgrade the vp8 WebM preset fails without any meaningful message int the log. I figured out that it is due somehow to the vorbis audio codec; it works with libopus. I will have to debug vorbis separately. vp8 shows no performance gain by adding row-mt=1.\n. This alone did not bring AMF support into Shotcut. The build script needs to download the AMF SDK (Windows only) and rename a directory (since ffmpeg code #include <AMF/...>): https://github.com/rdp/ffmpeg-windows-build-helpers/commit/019697915b9cccc117f356ed49839e6eaffc699f\n. The relevant messages from your log are:\n[Warning] <> create: Could not initialize EGL display: error 0x3001\n[Warning] <> create: When using ANGLE, check if d3dcompiler_4x.dll is available\n[Warning] <> create: Could not initialize EGL display: error 0x3001\n[Warning] <> create: When using ANGLE, check if d3dcompiler_4x.dll is available\n[Debug  ] <> failed to acquire GL context to resolve capabilities, using defaults..\nUnfortunately, your system does not meet the minimum requirements as specified in the FAQ. Specifically, it needs to support OpenGL either directly or indirectly. Your system is simply incompatible and nothing will be done about this.. Yes, that is a great addition to have! Is the \"shotcut.\" prefix a snap convention that is provided automatically, because I do not see the prefixes in your patch?. From the docs:\n\nIf the app name matches the snap name, the app will be executed when the name of the snap is called. Otherwise, the executable will have the snap name and a dot prefixed to the app name.. This is back in and working, but it is only in the candidate, beta, and edge channels where 18.05 resides.. Thank you for reminder. Closing as duplicate of #344, which is still open.. None of the developers have a mac with a touch bar. Is there another way to reproduce it? I doubt there is anything we can do anyway as we do not make the code for scrolling; it is provided by Qt.. Is GPU Processing enabled?\nPlease test if disabling Export > Parallel processing makes a difference.\n\nPlease provide some information about the format of the source clip. Another test that will take longer is to convert your source clips to an edit-friendly format using Properties > Convert to Edit-friendly as it appears to have difficulty to seek properly on your clips.\n. MPEG-2 (at least with B-frames) in Transport Stream aka HDV is particularly problematic since it is typically what is called open GOP. You can read more about that here:\nhttps://documentation.apple.com/en/finalcutpro/professionalformatsandworkflows/index.html#chapter=2%26section=1\nI have not been able to solve the issues with HDV and thankfully this format has largely faded in popularity. However, I think you said that second clip (AVCHD) giving more of the problem?\nThe edit-friendly formats generally do not lose much perceivable quality but only the \"best\" option is truly no quality loss. I am sorry, but yes, they are heavy. Another option to try - but not yet available in the Shotcut UI - is transmuxing. This simply takes the existing compressed audio and video out of the current container format and puts it into a new one that generally works better. Here is an example:\nffmpeg -i 00002.MTS -codec copy -map 0 00002.mov\nYou can use the ffmpeg that comes with Shotcut for this. I am curious to get your feedback if the transmuxing works, and if the problem is more with the HDV or the AVCHD clip.\n. A workaround is to use Convert to Edit-friendly or transmux procedure described here. The core issue is challenging and may require a risky change to either sensitive/critical MLT or FFmpeg code. I might add a transmux feature, but there are pitfalls to a simple approach and much work to a non-simple both of which can lead to numerous bugs and support issues.. Is GPU Processing enabled?\nPlease test if disabling Export > Parallel processing makes a difference.. Pending closure as it is not clear how to reproduce this.. What version are you using?\nI have reproduced something slightly different than this while attempting to do the same as your video. When you paste the video clip onto the A1 track, the clip on V1 is not supposed to move to the right as it appears in your video. That is a bug I do not reproduce, which is why I ask about the version. Now, when I paste, the bug I experience is that it pastes by one frame to the left, making the end of the audio tack one frame shorter than the video. See my screen; I have not made the transition yet:\n\nWhat is the frame rate of your video clips?. 30 or 29.97 ?. I still have not been able to reproduce it.\nWhat is Settings > Video Mode set as?\nOpen the project, click the top left corner block of the timeline labeled \"Originale\" in your gif, and view the properties panel. What does it show for frame rate?\nIn Windows Region control panel, what do you have as the region and the decimal symbol?\n. > Region set to Italy with \".\" as decimal symbol.\nI think that is a big part of the problem. Shotcut has some other issues (#362) reported here when the decimal point setting is not consistent with the locale (region). Now that I changed mine to be inconsistent, I reproduce it including the first problem seen in your video where pasting the clip to A1 makes the clip on V1 move to the right - that is not supposed to happen. Why do you change your decimal point?. > the first problem seen in your video where pasting the clip to A1 makes the clip on V1 move to the right\nNevermind about that. I noticed that \"Ripple All Tracks\" is turned on in the Timeline menu. I switched computers while working on this bug, and lost track of that setting. You must have it turned on as well.. Now I reproduced it regardless of the decimal symbol setting. It depends on the velocity of dragging the in point handle.. We now use the Save as Type field, which prevents this issue.. No, and it will not be added. Eventually, there will be a markers feature that will help you return to a marked location, but we do not take or track feature requests without code.. This is by design. To workaround it, you need to remove all elements in the XML that reference \"movit.\" but you will lose things in the process of that. There is no conversion feature.. What you are trying to do is not supported because current versions of Shotcut do not support SSL/TLS/HTTPS, and Google requires that. Also, this is not good use of the webvfx technology because the rendered HTML will not have a transparent background or be able to integrate any sort of JavaScript animation. You might as well just make a screen shot and include that in your project instead of writing HTML. That is much easier and also a workaround for this bug, which I will leave open since it does crash.\nI plan to upgrade the WebKit that Shotcut builds include and add support for OpenSSL at the same time. That might fix this. No ETA on that, but some effort was made, but it has been postponed to work on other things.. OK, that is a cool use case! I have a dev build that uses the new webkit and openssl bits, and I will test this to get expectation. The upgrades for release are planned after the keyframes feature development currently in progress, and I expect a couple of months from now.. FYI, I tested crash1.html in my Qt 5.9.2 with WebKit 5.212 and OpenSSL libs, and it works.. This is happening because you enabled compositing on the bottom-most video track. That should almost always be left disabled. No plans to change anything here (basically I cannot due to architecture design). I have thought about hiding the composite toggle on that track. It almost never makes sense to composite with the hidden black background track. Is there a particular reason why you enabled it?. I need to do some research before choosing to hide Composite toggle on the lowest video track because I recall seeing some forum messages about people using that to achieve some outcome.. BTW, V1 composite is never enabled by default. However, added video tracks DO enable composite by default. Thus, if you remove the V1 track, then your bottom-most video track is most likely composite enabled. Yes, that is quirky, but I am not sure how to handle it. I am not comfortable changing someone's track setting as a side effect of it becoming the bottom-most video track. However, if problems like yours causes more headache for users compared to the advantages of being able to enable composite on V1, then I will consider forcing V1 to disable composite.. Fixed in 438eaaabec59a32da036fbb8b502a72a726ddccb. I had not yet pushed the changes to snapcraft.yaml. Your changes did not work and generates an error. I do not have time to improve the snap. Send something tested that works if you still want it.\nI no longer have the exact error message available, but it said something like it could not find the something/$SNAP/Shotcut.app/melt file.. The clips must be exactly next to each other with no space between them. This is currently by design and has always been this way. It is also explained in the tutorial video.. Why write from scratch? Unless it is being ported to Movit.\nIt is good to know Premiere calls it mosaic. I see Avid does as well. Then, I am fine with it.. If we call it Pixelize, surely someone will complain that it should be Pixelate. :-S. I do not reproduce this in our build of Shotcut against Qt 5.6.1. I see you are using a custom Arch build (18.03.04 is not official). I do not fix bugs in others' builds; however, I do accept patches that will not cause a regression in my build.\nP.S. I have an unofficial build 17.11.27 against Qt 5.9.2 where I also do not reproduce it. In a couple of months, official Shotcut builds are moving to Qt 5.9.\n. There are some mysterious messages reported in the log, but if you set vprofile=baseline you do get baseline:\n[libx264 @ 0x7f8db807e600] profile Constrained Baseline, level 4.2\n[libx264 @ 0x7f8db807e600] 264 - core 152 r2854 e9a5903 - H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec - Copyleft 2003-2017 - http://www.videolan.org/x264.html - options: cabac=0 ref=3 deblock=1:0:0 analyse=0x1:0x111 me=hex subme=7 psy=1 psy_rd=1.00:0.00 mixed_ref=1 me_range=16 chroma_me=1 trellis=1 8x8dct=0 cqm=0 deadzone=21,11 fast_pskip=1 chroma_qp_offset=-2 threads=12 lookahead_threads=2 sliced_threads=0 nr=0 decimate=1 interlaced=0 bluray_compat=0 constrained_intra=0 bframes=0 weightp=0 keyint=13 keyint_min=1 scenecut=40 intra_refresh=0 rc_lookahead=13 rc=crf mbtree=1 crf=21.0 qcomp=0.60 qpmin=0 qpmax=69 qpstep=4 ip_ratio=1.40 aq=1:1.00\nvprofile=main give you this in the log:\n[libx264 @ 0x7feeda870e00] profile Main, level 4.2\n[libx264 @ 0x7feeda870e00] 264 - core 152 r2854 e9a5903 - H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec - Copyleft 2003-2017 - http://www.videolan.org/x264.html - options: cabac=1 ref=3 deblock=1:0:0 analyse=0x1:0x111 me=hex subme=7 psy=1 psy_rd=1.00:0.00 mixed_ref=1 me_range=16 chroma_me=1 trellis=1 8x8dct=0 cqm=0 deadzone=21,11 fast_pskip=1 chroma_qp_offset=-2 threads=12 lookahead_threads=2 sliced_threads=0 nr=0 decimate=1 interlaced=0 bluray_compat=0 constrained_intra=0 bframes=2 b_pyramid=2 b_adapt=1 b_bias=0 direct=1 weightb=1 open_gop=0 weightp=2 keyint=13 keyint_min=1 scenecut=40 intra_refresh=0 rc_lookahead=13 rc=crf mbtree=1 crf=21.0 qcomp=0.60 qpmin=0 qpmax=69 qpstep=4 ip_ratio=1.40 aq=1:1.00\nMediaInfo reports the same on the output. You wrongly claim they are \"the exact same.\" I think you are disturbed by messages you do not understand. I think these messages are from libavcodec might be trying to interpret these as an expression. \n. If you want to review the code, it is here https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/modules/avformat/consumer_avformat.c\nWith respect to passing options, search for \"apply_properties\". It is the function that converts MLT properties to FFmpeg AVOptions. It is called multiple times; so search for the function calls as well.\nIn order to pass options to x264, see the output of ffmpeg -h encoder=libx264 and convert its\n-option value syntax to MLT's option=value syntax. In particular, notice that some x264 options are not directly exposed as AVOptions and you have to use \"x264-params\" (which you can put into the Other tab).\n. > [Eval @ 000000000e44eef0]\nThis suggests to me that libavcodec is attempting to evaluate the value supplied as an expression and then failing (because it is not an expression?).\n\n[aac @ 000000000660d5e0] Unable to parse option value \"dct8x8\"\n\nThis means that the aac AVCodecContext also accepts the \"flags2\" option, which in this case was intended for libx264. However, MLT does not know that because the property name was not prefaced with a 'v', which means (in MLT) to only target video objects. However, the aac object fails to understand the flags supplied (naturally, since they are x264 flags).\n. Sorry to hear about your concussion. I understand what you mean by confusing messages in the logs. There is so much to do, and this particular log cruft is one of those things that is not getting priority (or left for others).\n. Not quite. In fact, in the original the else if ( out < 0 ) can never be reached. Also, there is a bug in the original at else if ( ( out < 0 || out >= mlt_producer_get_length( self ) ) &&\nmlt_producer_is_blank( self ) ). It should not include the out < 0 || part as it will result in setting the blank's length to 0 or less.\nTo fix the logic and make it easier to read, it should be:\nif ( mlt_producer_is_blank( self ) && out >= mlt_producer_get_length( self ) )\n        // Extend the blank producer if needed.\n        mlt_properties_set_position( MLT_PRODUCER_PROPERTIES( self ), \"length\", out + 1 );\n    else if ( out < 0 || out >= mlt_producer_get_length( self ) )\n        // Get the out point from the length.\n        out = mlt_producer_get_length( self ) - 1;. I only like to take translations through transifex.com. All other translations are received through that. It facilitates collaboration. Does that work ok for you? . Yes, of course, regarding desktop files. I got the two pull requests mixed up when reviewing them on my phone. :). Please submit them through transifex so they are not clobbered the next time I pull from transifex.. I have never seen this using primarily Ubuntu (various versions over the years). Is this using a build provided by us (shotcut website or github binary download)?. Duplicate of #358 . There was a commit merged into MLT over the weekend that introduced this compile error that slipped through the MLT Travis build on check-in, and then I noticed our nightly build server is down for the Shotcut nightly full builds. We will fix it very soon.. Maybe you are mostly coding C++? None of the other code in MLT uses that feature. However, it might be nice to start allowing it since we say the codebase is C99 in a couple of files in mlt/docs/. \nThis may require usage of -std=c99. However, that is somewhat gcc- specfic (and now clang). And then there is this claim of a \"Single-Unix-approved way\", which will require setting CC variable.. Fixed in https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/3021e900b5c60c059218e8e0400a77641f98929c. I do not reproduce it using our official build of 18.03.06 against Qt 5.6.1 but not using Arch or Wayland. Is your package using our binary? We do not provide support for other people's builds, but I will accept a patch if it does not cause a regression in our builds.. We already have automated nightly build of the portable tarball. All this does is change some tools and automate upload. Uploading is trivial. \nThe advantage of a tarball over AppImage is that it exposes some command line utilities without having to figure out the AppImage mount. Still, AppImage would be a nice addition.\nOur Qt builds require QtWebKit, and Windows uses 32- and 64-bit mingw-w64 per the toolchain we use for both Windows development and cross-compiling. Attempting to switch to msvc and msvcrt is a huge change to some of our dependencies, compiler compatibility, toolchains for dev and debug, and our SDK and its instructions. There is a lot to consider. It does not appear that AppVeyor satisfies those requirements.\nI appreciate your intention, but you need to understand this from my perspective. You seem to want to change the build system without taking ownership. It is considerable effort to change and detracts from the work on bugs and features. Still, I admit, I have thought about similar things, and if I decide to overhaul the build system in the future, I will come back to this. \n. There should only be 1 issue reported per ticket. For the first issue with audio, we need steps to reproduce it as I do not reproduce it. Also, include program version.\nThe next release reduces the memory footprint especially when working with still images.. It does not work on all systems. Are you able to do anything at all? If not, then we cannot fix this unless  you send me your computer. If you are able to do some things, but sometimes it crashes, then we need the steps to reproduce. . Possible duplicate of #271. @Schnellfahrer I do not have a machine on which it is unstable like you describe. Perhaps if I bought one with AMD Ryzen and GeForce 1050ti, but I am not certain if that will reproduce it. Also, I am not in a position to buy every user's machine. So, you might want to look elsewhere if you cannot contribute a patch yourself. (That is, unless you want to donate your machine to me.) Also, you have not specified if you are using GPU Processing. Obviously, that is a major factor as it is labeled experimental.. I just fixed it on Transifex, which is used to update the .ts files.. Shotcut builds provided by us, including snap, are not available for arm64, and there are no plans at the moment to provide one. You can try to request it as debian package from deb-multimedia.org.. Please attach the log file.. You are affected by this MLT bug. Your project includes itself (MLT XML) in the Playlist. You may have done this by using File > Open MLT XML as Clip and then choosing the project you are editing. I need to prevent this, but it should be fairly obvious that this will cause a problem. \nI edited your XML to remove that self-reference, and I uploaded it to here. Let me know when you have downloaded it; so I can remove it.\n. @alexistaf Shotcut could crash after opening a project for many reasons. This bug was one reason that was solved after these users supplied their project file, but that will not always work. Sometimes, even when the project file is provided I do not find the reason because I do not have your media files and because I do not have your computer - every computer is different. The solution for these users was put into the code for a new version of Shotcut. Before you open a new bug for your crash, first make sure you are using the latest version, which is currently 18.10.08. After that, be prepared to supply your project file.. This probably regressed in the fix for #362 for Windows and Linux. Does your locale use a comma for the decimal separator?. As a result of this fix, the next version will offer to repair old MLT XML project files when opening them. That is unfortunate, but it brings the macOS version of Shotcut in line with the behaviour on Windows and Linux, and it removes some ugly hacks we previously made for macOS.. You cannot use whatever version of Qt that you want. You must use the version we provide as well as mingw-w64 gcc (not MSVC), and the SDK for the additional Shotcut dependencies here: https://www.shotcut.org/notes/windowsdev/\nFurther help with building is not available. \n. I use MacPorts to satisfy the dependencies. Basically, you can install mlt, which installs many of the dependencies. Also, get my build of Qt from here:\nhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/misc.meltymedia/shotcut-build/qt-5.6.1-osx-x86_64.tar.bz2\nand extract it into the home directory of the user doing the build.. This is not a bug.. Or even better, search existing forum posts about using the Mask filter to affect other filters.. Can you provide steps to reproduce it?. @vipseixas Thank you, but I was not able to reproduce it. I tried repeatedly with and without GPU Effects turned on. Maybe you can produce a gdb backtrace or debug it and submit a patch.\n. What are you making? Are you making a clone of Shotcut and selling it without the source code? Show me what you are doing work Shotcut before I keep helping you without any gain.. What are you making? Are you making a clone of Shotcut and selling it without the source code? Show me what you are doing with Shotcut before I keep helping you without any gain.. Fixed in MLT for next release.. Did you happen to test any v4l or audio capture?. This is done now as \"v18.03.06\". Thanks, and good job!\nThis is using an incompatible (run time, not compile time) version of Movit, and we have not yet fully tested with those versions of Qt and QtWebKit, although those are my targets for the June release; so, keep them there for now. Can you please switch Movit to https://github.com/ddennedy/movit until you see me mention a new release has upgraded to Movit master (that is a goal for this year)?\nAlso, why are you replacing usage of qmelt with melt? That is inadvisable especially for certain combinations such as Movit and WebVfx. I think instead, we should have webvfx install the qmelt it builds, and continue to use that.\nLastly, you have some bad MLT configure options because you probably think they do something other than actual. In order to use LADSPA and JACK, you must remove \"--disable-jackrack\". It provides more than Jack-Rack integration. It contains all LADSPA- and JACK-related code in MLT. Similarly, in order to do deinterlacing, which is rather important, you must remove \"--disable-xine\" as that contains deinterlace code from xine (plus new code for YADIF). It does not require or enable actual xine integration. You can remove all the --enable-{module} MLT configure options. They do not do anything and simply add clutter to the composed command line.. Note to myself and others. Here is the app page on Flathub:\nhttps://flathub.org/apps/details/org.shotcut.Shotcut. > I guess the last commit of the \"shotcut\" branch?!\nYes\n\nI wanted to be explicit, in case a MLT module gets removed.\n\nIt does not hurt, but also these are not actually options recognized by the MLT configure script.\n. Use target 'libmovit.la' to skip building the Movit demo app and unit tests:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/scripts/build-shotcut.sh#L1510\n. Also, I just pushed a fix for the compile error into my branch.. gtk2 is not necessarily required.. I tested this out, and it basically works good. I would need to swap out my x11 driver again to test GPU; so, I skipped that for now. There will be a new release tomorrow hopefully. Then, I will list this option on the downloads page and close this.. >  When you do the release, could you add a release entry to the appdata.xml file?\nI do not feel like maintaining that. \n\nMaybe you could also incorporate the other post-install steps from the flatpak json file into the buildsystem.\n\nMany of the additional installed things are flatpak-specific by requiring the \"org.shotcut.\" prefix. The lrelease step is done as part of build-shotcut.sh and serves my needs.  If someone really wants these things, they should submit a patch and not ask me to do it for them.. This is listed on the downloads page now: https://www.shotcut.com/download/. jack2. See this related forum post:\nhttps://forum.shotcut.org/t/missing-libxkb-libs-in-prebuilt-download/272\nI see there is a libxkbcommon-x11-0 package for Ubuntu 16.04. Try installing that and report back please. I will at least add it to this page if I cannot find a good way to address this in the app bundle. . The versioning is based on the app bundle, which includes dependencies, and not just Shotcut source tree. IOW, the build identifier (date) is just as important as the Shotcut source tree when it comes to understanding the state of things. This also helps me to differentiate between official and unofficial builds. Lastly, my process is that there are nightly automated builds, whose version number goes into the About dialog, and I pick one to release when timing makes sense.\nIOW, this is currently by design, and I have no plans to change this at this time.. @qubodup It does not make a difference. Both are supplied by Github, which is powered by S3 and has nothing to do with Git and LFS. These are files that are uploaded/attached to release pages on github projects. This is not in my control, and it works for tons of files being hosted by S3 and Github. There are nearly half a million downloads per month for Shotcut through github stats. Surely it is working rather well for most people. I am not going to do anything about this. There is an alternate download location listed on the downloads page.. However, I see what you are saying about the link expiring and the time it takes to download over slower connections. I think I will make the fosshub download links more prominent as this is not the first complaint.. Change to download page done.. I have not reproduced this, but I do not have an iPhone.\nDid you have a previous version of Shotcut installed where this worked? In other words, do you believe this be a problem only with the new version 18.05?\n\nconverted from the new iPhone standart format\n\nI do not understand what this means. Can you explain it more, especially the target format you did not mention? Do you think the problem is specific to this format?\n. Do you mind uploading one of these corrupt files if you still have one? Then, I can see if the fault lies in ffmpeg or MLT.. @natrist You did not mention a version. Version 18.05 is rather unstable due to the introduction of major new features. You should try v18.03, the latest stable version. If you still have a problem, then I do not reproduce it, and you will have to provide much more information or debug it yourself.. I have not been able to reproduce this. After you clear all settings and app data and start shotcut, do you do anything before dropping a video clip from, I assume, Explorer?\n. I tested with clips on C:, D:, and E: where Shotcut is on C:. Do you know if there is a workaround? I will do some tests while running in a debugger next. Sometimes, that exposes a crash that normal running does not.. > workaround (sorry, forgot to mention) has been for me so far to drag in a jpg image into the source \nIf you do not add this to the Playlist or Timeline, then Shotcut does not determine the video mode from Automatic. Automatic resolution occurs when adding the first item to either of those.\n. The divide by zero error is most likely because of the 0 channels and 0Hz log message @bmatherly mentioned. You cannot use stock Visual Studio for debugging because Shotcut uses gcc and the mingw runtime and not msvcrt. You need to install something like VisualGDB or follow this article. I use Qt Creator and its debugger. However, I tested several times today in the (very slow) debugger with different clips, and I still did not reproduce it. At this point I am reviewing code to develop a hypothesis for the cause, which currently smells like a race condition around some initialization somewhere.. I found the bug in MLT. On a machine with more than 2 cores, it is directly related to the Realtime setting in Shotcut. It may affect more than Windows, but less likely. It is difficult for me to test a fix. So, after tonight's nightly build, I will post a link of a new build to test.\n@bmatherly take a look at https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/framework/mlt_consumer.c#L599\npriv->channels, and frequency are not set until after start is called. Look a little above that, and you can see consumer_read_ahead_start() is called on the main thread on Windows. consumer_read_ahead_start() calls mlt_frame_get_audio(), which might have unset channels and frequency in consumer_private. \n. Please test this: http://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-win64-180508.zip. >  1\nIt seems you did not clear your settings or left it set for mono.. Excellent. There are also many fixes for the fade in/out filters. I feel 18.05 may deserve a re-release.. > when will shotcut compile with MLT 6.6.0, with a special version of shotcut ?\nShotcut 18.03.06 is the last version that compiles with MLT v6.6.0. It is typical that Shotcut requires MLT git master as I lead on both, and mutually use one project to drive the other. The versions used for official builds are prescribed in the src/build-shotcut.sh script nighly build script, and the mostly monthly releases are plucked from the nightly builds. I can release a new version of MLT soon, but I will give a couple more days to see if any critical new bug appeared that needs fixing. \n. MLT 6.8.0 is released:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt/releases/tag/v6.8.0. I might do another release in a day or two and hold off on this non-critical change that will break a few translated strings.. The AppImage is just a different format as the .zip, both of which require at least Fedora 21, as stated on the downloads page.\n. Fedora 17 is not supported.\nSee the minimum versions on the downloads page. The FAQ about glibc version is wrong and will be updated.. thank you. Thanks for finding, the filter duration is not being updated correctly.. Please be aware that filter trimming in and out points will not be preserved when the timeline duration changes. It is not clear whether the intention of these are relative or absolutely positioned.\nAlso, simple keyframes are not adjusted accordingly. I realized I need to figure out a way for filters to provide simple animation functions, which are unique to each filter, to the timeline manipulation class. Currently, only the fade in and out filters get adjusted automatically when changing things on the timeline.. Forward compatibility is not supported. There is no way for old versions to show keyframes, and fades had to change in order to be compatible with keyframes. I cannot change an old version to accomodate the changes in XML. What is important is being able to open a project in an older version and use it correctly in a newer version.. One thing that is strange about the XML is that some JPEGs are being loaded with the MLT qimage (Qt5) producer and others are using pixbuf (GTK2). qimage is preferred now by MLT, but pixbuf will be used if qimage fails to load the image. There was a recent crash fix in MLT qimage that might be at play here.. There have been some fixes recently for images and the Size and Position filter. Please try this nightly build:\nhttp://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-win64-180517.zip. Why are you using 32-bit Shotcut on 64-bit Windows?. > I don't know if the qmelt.exe, attached by this version of Shotcut(18.05.08), has that two patches or not.\nYes, Shotcut 18.05.08 includes those patches.\nOh, I just thought of something else. The Parallel processing option in Export uses quite a bit more memory. I should disable that on 32-bit. \nI am taking a look at the project you provided now, but I am not setup for building and debugging 32-bit at the workstation. That is mainly just a compile target. I do not even really test it. So, it might take a while if I ever get around to it.. One thing I noticed while working with your files is that Shotcut loads screenshot.jpg with pixbuf instead of qimage (preferred as of 18.03). When I looked at this file with Media Info, it told me it is PNG. So, I changed the filename extension to .png and now qimage loads it. It looks like Qt is sensitive to MIME type or filename extension. That answers some of that mystery I mentioned before.. I reproduced the export crash with the 64-bit build of v18.05.08. The export does not crash with my development version of 64-bit for Windows. So, I made last night's 32-bit build available for downoload:\nhttp://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-win32-180518.zip\nExport crashed with it. Then, I turned off Parallel processing, and it succeeds.\nIt is quite possible that the change in 71167e65b4ac126546b7524e406bd81f991c2abf to reduce memory usage by turning off memory pooling exposes more pointer bugs because memory pool keeps more address space pinned within the process. I think some of these bugs have been fixed lately.\nI ran the above 32-bit 18.05.18 build of qmelt.exe in a debugger against the project with parallel processing enabled (-consumer avformat:test.mp4 real_time=-2), and I got this in the log just before crash:\nx264 [error]: malloc of size 11453376 failed\nIt should be noted as well that codec threads will also use more memory, and the automatic mode chooses by cpu count, and I have 16 logical CPUs.\nAgain, if I disable parallel processing (-consumer avformat:test.mp4 real_time=-1) it succeeds. Pointer problems are more likely to trigger in a debugger session, but not as good as address sanitizing or valgrind. Another easy experiment to make without having a debug build and development project setup for 32-bit: enable parallel processing but reduce x264 threads (-consumer avformat:test.mp4 real_time=-2 threads=3). That succeeds as well.\nSo, this is still looking like issues with memory constraints and consumption especially with multiple threads. It should be noted as well that many decoders in FFmpeg now use multiple threads, and there are new multi-threaded slice-based image processing routines in MLT. The combination of all these multi-threaded processing improvements in FFmpeg and MLT also explains why an older version like 17.02 did not have as much problem. There is a MLT environment variable to control the max number of slices: MLT_SLICES_COUNT.\nUnfortunately, I have not found anything like that for FFmpeg decoder threads yet. A property would need to be set on each MLT avformat producer object, which would be difficult to manage. Now, if I run with MLT_SLICES_COUNT=1 qmelt ... -consumer avformat:test.mp4 real_time=0 threads=1 to reduce multi-threading without touching producers, qmelt does not use more than 670 MiB RAM. real_time=0 tells MLT to not use a separate rendering thread; the rendering takes place on the encoding thread. Taking this to another level and adding <property name=\"threads\">1</property> to each avformat-novalidate producer in the MLT XML file, and RAM usage does exceed 570 MiB. Here is another MLT environment variable MLT_AVFORMAT_SLICED_PIXFMT_DISABLE, and if I set that to 1. Oh, and another thing, MLT playlist can have \"autoclose=\"1\"' property which closes producers after they have ended strictly for sequential processing where you know random seeking will not occur. Shotcut already puts that into the XML for export. Adding those two things brings RAM usage down to 556 MiB! Not so bad now, eh?\nTo resolve this bug, I will make Shotcut limit thread usage on 32-bit.. >Can we just disable the Parallel processing when dealing with large images or some cases that will use a lot of memory?\nNo, that is too challenging to make a good heuristic and adds the overhead of an initial analysis pass, and cannot be done dynamiclly. 32-bit users must suffer the consequences of continuing to use 32-bits and living in the past.\n\nSo will you still turn off memory pooling and fix bugs over successive versions\n\nYes\n\nUhh... Actually I didn't use that screenshot.jpg\n\nI know, but I did by chance, which is when I noticed that it loaded with pixbuf instead of qimage.\n. Does it load OK if you use File > Open MLT XML As Clip...?\nYou can attach the project file to here.. Situation 1 is expected, and I disagree with the off-topic.\nRe Situation 2, I do not want to remove filters upon switching modes. Brian's change addresses because it changes behavior to force a restart if you agree to the confirmation dialog, and does not apply the change otherwise. Then, upon reloading the project in GPU mode, if stabilize is included, it alerts the user and asks them if they want to change modes and restart.\nIn summary, Brian's pull request is the fix for this.. It should be noted as well that I have a goal to get Text and Stabilize working with GPU mode sometime in the year. They were only marked incompatible as a short term fix.. Fixed in 9473f7ffac48f6da48f0f390db54212b3db91987. It works fine for me in Windows 10 at 150 and 200%:\n\nI also turned on \"Fix scaling for apps\" in Advanced scaling settings and that gives some funky results but nearly as unusable as yours. \nDo you have multiple monitors connected?\nThis is largely out of our control and controlled by Qt, and it may change with the next Qt upgrade, which I am hoping for next release.. > I believe that it is an issue with the Audio Spectrum Visualisation filter.\nDid you remove or disable that filter to see if it works?. Please be aware that this was created with v18.05.03, which has been deleted from download and replaced by v18.05.08.\nhqsq.mp4 was not provided, and I used nightfall 1.5.2.mp4 as a subtitute.\nThen, using v18.05.08 (18.05.03 not tested), it almost exports completely for me. It did fail near the end, which I am looking into.. I found the problem in MLT. It is triggered by your complex project with multiple tracks containing multiple overlapping transitions. There is a workaround until the next release. You need to set the following environment variable and restart Shotcut: MLT_AVFORMAT_PRODUCER_CACHE = 10.. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=windows+set+environment+variable. user is fine.. This did not completely resolve it for me. There was a different in my working copy masking an additional problem. As a result, qmelt would crash at ~85%. This corresponds to the point at which the last clip on V4 starts. This clip has several filters on it, and disabling Size and Position finally made it succeed. Now, I am trying to debug that, but I doubt \nDo you have a video on your channel that was made with Shotcut that I can add to a playlist.. The partial fix to avoid needing to set the environment variable: https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/49470a9d7fb02556bac307f8434ff5aae06a249e. 250 end screen.png with the filters:\n Chroma Key: Simple\n Glow\n Fade Out Video\n Fade In Video\n* Size and Position\n. I finally found something in the debugger for the last crash and am testing the fix for it. If all goes well, tomorrow I can share a nightly build for you to test and confirm.. Here is the nightly build to try out:\nhttp://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-win64-180517.zip. > This logic could also be moved into the Mlt::Properties save() and load() functions since it maintains backwards compatibility.\nI do not like that idea because I prefer mlt++ to be a simple wrapper over the C API.. Waiting a little to merge while I continue to think about your proposals. Some good points but I am also a little anxious about change - not so much the load side but on save. I worry that some app is using save and then parsing the results in their own code, e.g. custom preset handling.. Do not merge this yet. I found during testing that it breaks the new Size and Position presets with keyframes.. > Okay, I have done the Hue/Lightness/Saturation filter with avformat (screenshot below). \nWe strongly shy away from using bare values in parameters. They should be mapped into percentage or have some unit of measure indicated in the UI.\n\nwhat should we do with the existing \"Saturation\" filter\n\nGood question. One option is to mark it hidden in the meta.qml. That prevents it from the showing in the filter chooser for new projects, but it will still load for old projects. Another option is to just keep it visible because people are looking for Saturation because they have seen it web pages and video tutorials. \nWhen the time comes to add search and categories to the filter chooser, I have been thinking about whether to let a filter have aliases and appear in the list more than once. For example, this could show up as 3 filters all linked to the same filter - if you see what I mean. Of course, that is not available today, and I am still undecided. What is your opinion on the two options above?\n. One major drawback to using avfilter is that it does not support keyframes, and I am not certain that it can be added (supported by libavilter, in general). I think that may be a strong case for using frei0r.hueshift0r, which does support it. We have an easy change to make to MLT frei0r module, and then all frei0r modules will support keyframes.\n. > I think that keyframes could be supported by the avfilter filter by destroying the filter and recreating it \nI am pessimistic about that approach.. I will cherry-pick your commits for the avfilter since this branch.\nOther reasons to keep the existing saturation filter is it has a GPU version (these do not and not trivial to add), and I am adding support for keyframes to them. Keyframes for hue is less important.. partially merged in aa374f536. Unable to reproduce on Windows 10 with or without GPU processing enabled. I doubt Windows version makes a difference. Do you have GPU processing enabled in Settings? That is experimental and not addressable because it is dependent on the particular machine's OpenGL.. ok, I reproduced it now.. Thanks for the detailed bug report.. This was already fixed. The bug is that filters with simple keyframes required the playhead to be between the first and last frame of the clip (not including them) even if the simple keyframes were not used. There are numerous other keyframes-related bugs fixed:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/commits/master. This is already fixed as well. I tried to suggest in the other ticket that there are a lot of known bugs in the keyframes. I suggest holding off until the next version. If it is causing enough problems then use v18.03.. I reproduce this using the supplied sound effect in the Source player when Settings > Realtime is enabled. That needs work agreed. However, when I add the sound clip to the timeline of an existing project I do not reproduce it, and I do not reproduce it in the exported timeline. Also, if I open the mp3 in Shotcut, and export it was WAV (not in timeline), the result plays as expected outside Shotcut.\nShotcut v18.05 introduced support for mono and surround sound, which might have had an impact (it has affected scrubbbing, for example). Please test v18.03 since I am having trouble to reproduce it as you described.\n. > the mp4 audio files that I originally wanted to use do have the problem\nPlease share one or describe how you created it in case I have the tool.\n. There is still a general problem with the mp4 audio files, which is why this is not resolved yet.. I fixed the command line arguments on restart. I do not care about the lingering registry key. Someone will have to provide a patch if they want it.. I believe you are affected by bugs in version 18.05 due to the introduction of new major features. This bug was already fixed. The only workaround is to remove the fades and re-add them. You have to do this every time you change the duration of a clip. The next version is due June 2. . It works after a small compile fix! \n```\ndiff --git a/src/settings.cpp b/src/settings.cpp\nindex f7149d3..831a594 100644\n--- a/src/settings.cpp\n+++ b/src/settings.cpp\n@@ -25,6 +25,7 @@\n static const QString APP_DATA_DIR_KEY(\"appdatadir\");\n static const QString SHOTCUT_INI_FILENAME(\"/shotcut.ini\");\n static QScopedPointer instance;\n+static QString appDataForSession;\nShotcutSettings &ShotcutSettings::singleton()\n {\ndiff --git a/src/settings.h b/src/settings.h\nindex b5b4ba0..af78c37 100644\n--- a/src/settings.h\n+++ b/src/settings.h\n@@ -174,7 +174,6 @@ signals:\n private:\n     QSettings settings;\n     QString m_appDataLocation;\n-    static QString appDataForSession;\n };\n#define Settings ShotcutSettings::singleton()\n```.

OK, thanks, I see it in your video. I do not have the project \"run - Repaired.mlt\" but I tried to create a similar track arrangement. However, I could not reproduce the problem in v18.05.  That is not surprising. Something as sufficiently complex as this software and your project is bound to have issues that are difficult to locate. Since you are working with PNGs that may have alpha channels, you still might be affected by the bug fix I mentioned above. Do you have GPU Processing enabled in Settings?\n. Based on the size of your text and icons in your screenshot, I think this is due to your Windows DPI (text size) setting. However, I could not reproduce this using 125, 150, 175, 200, or 300%. To workaround this, you can set a windows environment variable QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR to the value 0. Maybe if you provide a full window screenshot, your screen resolution, and text size setting I can reproduce it. Otherwise, this UI view is due soon for a major change to improve it, and then the problem will likely go away.\n. Another windows setting that can be a factor is \"Fix scaling for apps\"\n\nLet me know if that is on.. I moved the filter chooser buttons and search field to the top of the panel for the next release.. There is already a logo, and I am keeping it. Did you even install it and see the app icon? How about the About dialog?\n\nIt is so simple many people think it is not an icon or logo, but it is; simple is the trend. I will be making a small change to the website design soon to better emphasize the logo. . > Only after deleting ~./config/Meltytech/Shotcut.conf it would also crash.\nThis was key for me to reproduce as well.\n. Regression caused by 92dadc5f8.. Fixed by reverting that change in a135d38d. Will tag a 18.06.02 version soon and new builds.. Thank you both for letting me know very quickly so I can limit the exposure of that flaw.. Duplicate of #579. A version 18.06.02 is going up today.. Duplicate of #579.

It sounds like the menu item is hidden or disabled, but I do not think that is what you mean.\n\nI have tried to detach audio waveform but Shotcut crashs when selecting audio waveform rebuild.\n\nI think you are referring to the new \"Detach Audio\" menu item in a timeline clip's context menu. I do not reproduce that.\n. > That means that when I cut the track in the timeline the audio waveform doesn't match to what is listened (\"same\" audio waveform before the cut and after). \nI reproduce that. The easier (less interruption) workaround is to choose Reload (F5) from the Timeline menu. I will make that the main bug for this ticket.\n. Yes, as usual, at the beginning of the next month. Also, the milestone that is tagged on this ticket has a target date.. Please check if the version is 18.06.01 or 18.06.02.\nUpdate: nevermind \"latest second release of June\" = 18.06.02. I can supply a new version for test where I reverted a recent change that might be causing some problems. Let me know if you want to try it.. Here you go. It is not AppImage because that is a manual release step. Rather, this is the portable archive, which I believe you know how to launch. It it almost the exact same thing as the AppImage:\nhttp://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-linux-x86_64-180613.tar.bz2\n. Hmm.. that is too bad. I do not make or know how to debug the flatpak, unfortunately. It looks like some bad interaction between Qt and GTK.. @eszlari What do you think this could be?. Thank you @eszlari !. > is the intention to set Scan mode to Progressive (and then Field order to grayed out None)?\nYes\n\nNow if you click a preset (that does not explicitely set these options) then the Deinterlacer changes to value YADIF - temporal + spatial (best)\n\nThis is by design.

FYI, I released MLT 6.12.0 and WebVfx 1.0.0 in order to facilitate distro packagers that do not like to use git versions. . Sure they do. I do not know what you are doing wrong.. You might be seeing a problem that upon loading an existing project, a clip is selected automatically, but the Filters panels does not show its filters. You need to re-select to see them: #358 . Duplicate of #585. It sounds like something bad crept into the project. You can upload your project file to here with a .zip or .txt extension. I am not certain we can determine what is going wrong, but we can take a look.. I can supply a new version for test where I reverted a recent change that might be causing some problems. Let me know if you want to try it.. I am glad you were able to work through your problem. The Properties panel for a clip has a little menu button, and there are a couple of items you might find useful in this situation: Start Integrity Check Job and Convert to Edit-Friendly. The first one tries to test for file corruption, and the second one might be able to repair a problematic file.. Please be aware that this file comes from the CuteLogger project.. Thank you for your contributions.. I reproduced it when I add a GPU filter to the clip in Source before trying to add it to Timeline.. Shotcut requires a working OpenGL configuration, but you do not have one. There is nothing Shotcut can do to fix that. It might be a snap problem, but I am not sure. In this case it is trying to use the llvmpipe+mesa driver (see output of glxinfo | grep OpenGL), but it does not work because snap appears to have provided a swrast_dri.so that is incompatible with the host system. \nVerify OpenGL works by runing glxgears.\nDid you try the portable archive or AppImage of Shotcut?\n. I reproduced the problem in a VM, and it is a problem with the \"stable\" channel version (18.03). The beta (v18.06) works: sudo snap refresh shotcut --classic --beta. I will probably switch stable to the forthcoming v18.07 for the next stable release, but perhaps later in the month of July.. All translation updates must be submitted through Transifex: https://www.transifex.com/ddennedy/shotcut/. @eszlari This is because the flatpak is using melt instead of qmelt ro run export child process.\nhttps://github.com/flathub/org.shotcut.Shotcut/blob/master/org.shotcut.Shotcut.yaml#L204\nWhy? qmelt should be installed by WebVfx. It will if MLT_SOURCE is provided to qmake:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/webvfx/blob/master/mlt/qmelt/qmelt.pro\nIs the source path location difficult to provide between flatpak modules?\n. Thank you @eszlari !. Use https://github.com/flathub/org.shotcut.Shotcut to report flatpak problems. We do not maintain it.\n. Also, bear in mind that this is not a bug but a feature request that may be unfilled. There is no guarantee that all builds of Shotcut are going to be the same esp. those maintained outside the main project.. @TingPing Yes, please. Then, I will figure out how to build a Flatpak to test my changes. Or, will CI/buildbot automatically work with my github fork?\n. What is your version and where did you get the build?. It works fine when MLT is built with -DMLT_USE_POOL (memory mangager). This was turned off since v18.05, which has caused problems, and it is being turned back on in v18.07 until more debugging can be done with it on.. They work for me on Windows (including Strikethrough and Paste), and translators can choose to have an ampersand in front of a chosen letter. Menu keyboard shortcuts are a very common thing. You need to be more convincing. \nFYI, to use these you press Alt+main menu item letter followed by letter of menu entry. For example, Strikethrough in English is Alt+o, s.. This was a regression in v18.07 with the fix for audio scrubbing. It only affects preview and not export.. I do not reproduce this, and you have provided far too little information.. > Changed language to English still not working.\nShotcut uses the OS number settings for numbers, not the UI language.\n\nPlease do not use the system numbers but use Arabic numbers (0-9) by default.\n\nBesides the problem reported, why use Arabic numbers instead of the OS region settings? I think modern applications should try to use the native language and number settings. I am fairly sure that forcing usage of Arabic numbers may also force a certain character for the decimal separator, which might be different between the UI and engine and cause a problem.\nIt is not clear to me how to debug this and make it work because I am fairly sure I would be lost after changing my Windows settings to use Thai language. I may require a patch from a open source contributor to fix this. Perhaps other languages are affected too. It is so sad that so very few people contribute fixes for Shotcut.\n. I will ask for help from a friend (non-developer) who knows Farsi to see if that language is affected similarly.. I do not reproduce the problem. Please ensure Settings > GPU Effects is turned off. You need to provide all the steps to reproduce it, or I will close this.. I reproduced it. It occurs mainly when you add fade out to an image file with a transition at the start. I am not certain it is limited to that exact combination and sequence yet, but that is how I can reproduce it. It does not seem to reproduce with a video file, and it does not seem to reproduce without that transition, however. (I am making notes here for myself and other developers.). A inconvenient workaround is:\n1. remove the image clip after the transition\n2. reopen the image file (do not use copy from Edit menu or Timeline, but OK if it comes from Playlist or Recent)\n3. add it to the timeline\n4. add the filters\n. Shotcut builds can be tricky to get working correctly, and custom builds are not supportable. What you describe is not reproduced on our official builds for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Are you working on a package for Slackware? I am only willing to support you if you are working on a package for the distro.\n. It looks like Player::onShowFrame is some remnant of the remove melted/mvcp code.. I reproduce this as well. Some dependency changed in the Snap container base image between last version and this. As a workaround, you can run the snap the same as a portable at the command line: /snap/shotcut/current/Shotcut.app/shotcut.\nMeanwhile, I have downgraded the snap stable channel to v18.07. @chrissxYT You are probably running it incorrectly. Running bin/shotcut is not correct.. Something strange is happening in the snap where some environment variables are not propagating: The LANG or other locale environment variables that causes the LC_NUMERIC=\"C\" in MLT XML, and QT_PLUGIN_PATH from Shotcut parent process to the qmelt child process for export. Fundamentally, things do work because shotcut.qmelt which is an additional executable exposed by the snap works when run at the command line because it is a wrapper script that sets QT_PLUGIN_PATH to something legitimate (appears to be empty in the error log in the original post here).\n. There is a new v18.08 on the candidate, beta, and edge channels where the export does work (as well as locale handling). However, it changes the execution mode to work exactly like the portable tar bypassing the snap desktop-launcher script that changes numerous environment variables. It was never the intent that Shotcut uses the snap's Qt libs but rather its own. This change ensures that even further.\nddennedy@MS-7593:~/src/shotcut/packaging/linux$ snapcraft release shotcut 29 candidate,beta,edge\nTrack    Arch    Channel    Version    Revision\nlatest   amd64   stable     18.07      27\n                 candidate  18.08      29\n                 beta       18.08      29\n                 edge       18.08      29. Now I need to try to remember to change it every new release.. You can rename the file as .txt and upload it, and I will take a look, but I cannot guarantee I will find the problem.. This is not a bug. You can resize the window (it is not a \"screen\") just like resizing any window. If you need to go smaller, and you are limited then close the panels or choose View > Layout > Player from the menu. However, that is probably not what you want and have not explained it well. If that is the case, then Shotcut probably does not provide what you are looking for, and I do not take feature requests. . Is the problem specific to this project? There is probably very little I can do to help you. Something got into the project that upset it. Does it depend on where you start play from? If so, that is a clue about something to remove. Are you able to export it? If it fails, it reports the time code near the point of failure, and that can be used to locate a problem and something to try to remove.. This file does not suffer the corruption problem mentioned in the blog post about v18.08.14. I do not see anything wrong with it.\nWhen you try open it in Shotcut do you get a window similar to this?\n\nWhat is drive E: ? Is that a removable USB device? It looks the folder structure from a camera. If so, you need to use Windows Explorer to copy those files to a hard drive somewhere and then use this dialog to tell Shotcut where the new file location is.\n. Try using the latest version 18.08.14. There have been 3 versions since 18.07 with all mainly bug fixes. If that does not help, try changing Settings > Display Method to OpenGL. If that does not help, upload the project file here by renaming it with .txt or zip-ing it.. I believe the problem is with image 001374.JPG in your file. Can you use some other tool like Media Info or ffprobe.exe (cmd.exe tool included with Shotcut in Program Files) to verify this is really JPG? Maybe it is really PNG. I made a change to the MLT, that might have fixed it (if it is really JPG) or might now cause that image to not appear. If the image does not appear, and it is really PNG. Rename the file to correct it. Then, when you open the project in Shotcut, it will ask you to find the missing file, and you can point it to the new name.\nKurzfassung - fix1.txt\n. I made a change in code to better handle an incorrect image file name extension for the next version.. I am sorry to report that after I re-linked your project file (Kurzfassung - fix1.mlt) with my own media, I have not experienced a crash. I played the entire project from start to finish. An export is in progress.\nMaybe there is still a problem with that image since it had something suspicious at that point. Try to rename the image file or move it away temporarily. Open the project, and Shotcut will report a missing file. Click OK to ignore that warning and to load it without that file.\nUpdate: export completed successfully. Based on the screenshot of your error message, the error did occur on some image file (libmltqt.dll is used to read images).\n. A last option (because I think you uploading all of your media somewhere is ridiculous), is to download the Shotcut SDK, which has a debug build of shotcut. Note that it is 1.4 GB:\nhttp://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-win64-sdk-180801.zip\nAfter extracting it somewhere locate Shotcut/shotcut.exe in Explorer and double-click to run it. Open your project. When it crashes it might create a text file named shotcut.RPT with a crash report in the same folder as the exe. You can see if it is there and attach it here to provide some clue (unfortunately, it is only a clue).. Those warning messages are not a problem. The crash report tells me it failed when reading an image file, but it does not tell which one it is unfortunately.\nYou can to figure out which one it is by moving all image files out of their folder, opening the .mlt file in Shotcut and click OK on the missing files dialog, seeing if it crashes. Then, working in batches of say 10 images at-a-time, move the images back into their folder and reopen the project, again clicking OK on the missing files dialog until it does crash again. Then, you know it is one of the last 10 you restored. After that, work backwards to remove one at-at-time until the crash stops. Now, you know which one is causing it to fail.. In order to make a definite fix, I need to be able to reproduce it, which I have not. I also tested on a NAS. There are some things that occur in parallel in the background that depends on the number of CPU threads. My machine has 8 cores/16 threads, and yours has 12/24. That might have something to do with it. Perhaps I should limit this not only to prevent this crash but also to reduce I/O contention. . Well, you can see I added a change based on this issue to try to prevent this from occurring to you and others in the future. As well, I think this can make Shotcut more well behaved feeling especially when opening an old project whose thumbnails and waveforms may no longer exist in the cache.. I believe you because I had to repair someone's project file for this and because once out of about 15 tries I did reproduce it. However, I am unable to reproduce it again in order to debug this further. Are you able to repeat it? If so, how exactly are you executing Insert Track because it all depends on the current track, which has the gold background. And when you right-click a track head the track is both made current and the track head selected - at this point nothing is gold because the tracks are empty.\n. I reproduced it easily on Linux but not so easily on Windows.. It looks like I can replace them with Liberation and/or Noto using Facetype.js Then, provide a mapping for older projects.. see also 01849373. Add DEFINES+=SHOTCUT_NOUPGRADE to the qmake call to disable the upgrade prompt and Help > Upgrade... menu item.. This requires git master head, which I do not think your build is using. See the milestone tagged to this issue for the next release that will include this commit.. That is an unofficial source, and I do not want to be subject to their approval process or clutter the already complicated download page.. Since the closing tag comes at the end of the string, and I want to release in a day or two; I will wait to merge this after the next release because I do not want to break any existing translations this close to release.. This is due to a bug in color selection that was already fixed in the code base. This bug also afflicts the Chroma Key filters. You can use v18.08.14 in the meantime, or I can give you a link to last night's build that really only contains the fix for this (and only this).. http://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-macos-x86_64-180916.dmg. FIxed in https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/ac8d1f3485c58139429e4503a7fcc2daf0d72659. I updated the downloads page on the web site to include this version: 18.09.16. I cannot debug it from this crash report. You need to upload your project file.. GPU Effects is clearly indicated as experimental and unsupported, which means do not report a bug about it without the code patch that fixes it!. I also see that you are using a Text filter in GPU mode. That is also forbidden. Under normal circumstances, the Text filter is not made available in GPU mode. You somehow circumvented that. I realize now that the new Text clip feature (FIle > Open Other > Text) is not hidden in GPU mode, and I will have to add that. Furthermore, when opening this project, you get the warning \"The file you opened uses CPU effects that are incompatible with GPU effects....\" It appears you started the project without GPU effects on and then switched. How many more warning signs do you need? There is no project conversion between the two.\n. There was a general issue with crashing after the app restarts itself on macOS, which is what you experienced when Shotcut told you it need it needs to switch GPU Effects on or off. I just fixed that for the next version. It was something I knew about and annoyed me, and this ticket motivated me to finally fix it. However, now Shotcut fails to load this project by design because of the mixed mode. It keeps requiring you to switch modes (GPU Effects on/off) and restarting until you give up and click No, in which case it does not load the project.. I started working on this by recursively enumerating library dependencies, filtering them, and copying them in. We also require JACK, and I see that is on the excludelist. We check for it at runtime and present a dialog like the above. I think the reason we did not include SDL was because SDL 1.2 had different libraries for various audio backends, and there was a problem in some testing. This goes way back before we upgraded to SDL2. . I initially chose 4x4, and that is what I see on screen; however, the menu showed 2x2 checked. Toggle it off and back on again, it displays as 2x2.\nAs for color, I think a white and black line along-side each might work good (white with black shadow?). The gray is fairly difficult to see. (I can hear users now complaining that there are faint lines on their video that they cannot get rid of! ;-) Perhaps another option is to add a sub-menu with a color choice of a few primaries in addition to black, white, gray.\nI wonder if we should include the outside border of the grid or not. I was not expecting to see it.. Here it is as white with black for consideration (sans outline):\n\ndiff --git a/src/qml/modules/Shotcut/Controls/VuiBase.qml b/src/qml/modules/Shotcut/Controls/VuiBase.qml\nindex f1298ee5..5265a345 100644\n--- a/src/qml/modules/Shotcut/Controls/VuiBase.qml\n+++ b/src/qml/modules/Shotcut/Controls/VuiBase.qml\n@@ -20,11 +20,29 @@ DropArea {\n                 var rectY = video.rect.y - video.offset.y + zoomOffsetY\n                 var gridSizeX = rectW / video.grid\n                 var gridSizeY = rectH / video.grid\n-                ctx.lineWidth = 2\n-                ctx.strokeStyle = \"#777777\"\n+\n+                ctx.lineWidth = 1\n+                ctx.strokeStyle = \"#000000\"\n+                ctx.beginPath()\n+                // vertical grid lines\n+                for(var x = 1; x * gridSizeX < rectW; x++)\n+                {\n+                    context.moveTo(rectX + x * gridSizeX + 1, rectY)\n+                    context.lineTo(rectX + x * gridSizeX + 1, rectY + rectH)\n+                }\n+                // horizontal grid lines\n+                for(var y = 1; y * gridSizeY < rectH; y++)\n+                {\n+                    context.moveTo(rectX, rectY + y * gridSizeY + 1)\n+                    context.lineTo(rectX + rectW, rectY + y * gridSizeY + 1)\n+                }\n+                // draw and close\n+                context.stroke()\n+                context.closePath()\n+\n+                ctx.lineWidth = 1\n+                ctx.strokeStyle = \"#ffffff\"\n                 ctx.beginPath()\n-                // Outline\n-                ctx.rect(rectX + 1, rectY + 1 , rectW - 2, rectH - 2)\n                 // vertical grid lines\n                 for(var x = 1; x * gridSizeX < rectW; x++)\n                 {\n. Here is the same video with your 2-wide gray for comparison:\n\n. Where I really notice a difference is this clip. Before:\n\nAfter:\n\n. Quick Sync is not available in the FFmpeg build we provide. This is not something you can simply enable with a command line option. Also, you can easily drop in a custom or system build of FFmpeg (unless you are using some distro package custom build that not provided by us). In any case, yes, other FFmpeg options can be specified in the Other tab using option=value syntax (not -option value), one per line. I just bought a MacBook that can support Quick Sync. So, I may get around to adding support for it to our builds soon.\nSince this is not a bug and we do not track feature requests, I am closing it but feel free to reply.. If you want to compile FFmpeg yourself, give it a shot. We are using v4.0, and are build options are here:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/scripts/build-shotcut.sh#L600\nYou might be able to drop replacement libs into the Shotcut.app/lib dir.. Take a look at this Encoding section:\nhttps://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Hardware/VAAPI#Encoding\nMLT does not yet upload frames to the hardware surfaces. For some APIs this is not needed (NVENC). There is no way to tell MLT to use the hwupload to do that either. It needs to be coded in. Unfortunately, a simple rebuild of ffmpeg is not going to work.. Overall, it is good and handy! I think the snapping is a little too strong even though you can argue it is easy to turn grid off. Some people will want the ability to show the guide but turn off snapping. I think we can add a checkbox to the grid menu for that option, and I can add support for the safe areas I already added to the grid menu. . I'm working on it since I added the safe zones, but this now highlights how inaccurate the rectangle control is when zoomed in :-( The snapping and image accurate with respect to the grid but not the rectangle control itself.. Should the new \"Snap to Grid\" option also snap to safe area guides? I ask because technically they are not a grid.. Also, when thinking about that, consider that when positioning (not resizing), the rectangle edges do not snap - only the center does.. This was rebased and merged manually.. This is because the filter in the engine does not allow it. I will change it.. This cannot be done. It would only be a superficial change in engine that converts 0 to 1, but there are reasons I do not want to do that. . From the release announcement, under Changes:\nRemoved the Compositing toggle icon from the Timeline track head. Now, it is located in the track Properties as Blend mode with a None option.\n. Keyframes are relative to the start of a clip. Are you referring to a track filter (filter attached to a track or Master instead of a filter attached to a clip?\nWhat is your version?. OK. Yeah, timeline edits do not affect keyframes on track filters. That is simply not implemented today, and we need to add that. There is no workaround. I recommend only using keyframes on clip filters in the meantime and only use keyframes on track filters for simple things. You live and learn just like us.. This was already fixed for the next version due in October. a394b590. BTW, this problem does not affect simple keyframes on this filter.. The problem occurs when you drag or remove keyframes. Please provide steps in the future.\nThis release announcement contains info about simple keyframes.. I found it will crash (using Windows) if the rectangle is nearly the size of image. I see messages like the following:\n[filt @ 000000005c6c70c0] auto-inserting filter 'auto_scaler_1' between the filter 'in' and the filter 'filt'\n[auto_scaler_1 @ 000000005c6c80c0] w:1280 h:720 fmt:yuyv422 sar:1/1001 -> w:1280 h:720 fmt:yuv422p sar:1/1001 flags:0x2\n[auto_scaler_0 @ 000000005c6c6bc0] w:1280 h:720 fmt:yuv422p sar:1/1001 -> w:1280 h:720 fmt:yuyv422 sar:1/1001 flags:0x2\nThat suggests like the filter is rather complex and might be difficult to port. If we move forward with this, we should constrain the rectangle to something like 20% of profile resolution.. Unable to reproduce.  Provide exact steps to starting with a new project. Also, consider to make a screenshot or screencast video.. Thank you!. This is by intentionally by design. It is a time format called SMPTE timecode. The last field is a frame counter. In the future, we will add support for configurable time formats.. Closing because GPU Effects is unsupported without a patch/pull request. Next version 18.11 makes this more obvious.. More library dependencies are bundled now to resolve this bug #634.\nHowever, the bundle_libs function filters out libs from /lib as opposed to /usr/lib by default as most of them fall in the excludelist but not all including libwrap in this case.. This is not a bug. Your Qt build is missing the QtWebKit module, which is no longer supported by Qt. We have a SDK that includes the version of Qt that we use with the QtWebKit module plus other dependencies: https://shotcut.org/notes/windowsdev/\nI hope you are planning to contribute to Shotcut and not trying to make an illegitimate fork to sell under your own name.\n. It works beautifully! Thank you. > How can I help to solve this?\nTry to figure out what causes it. Perhaps, it is a particular filter. For example, I think some of the HTML-based filters might be a source due to poorly managed threads in the web runtime.\n. This was already fixed by 4da128ab2 and #684. The fix was comprehensive, not minimal. \nHere is a nightly build you can try: http://builds.us.meltytech.s3.amazonaws.com/shotcut/shotcut-linux-x86_64-181026.tar.bz2. I am not going to provide that, but there are SDKs on the website: https://shotcut.org/siteindex/\nIf you need more info than that, then read scripts/build-shotcut.sh for details.. >  It's weird the video they are related to stops, but the mask is still rendered\nYou probably attached the filter to the track instead of a clip, which would be working as intended.. > [Debug  ]  GPU processing true \nGPU Effects is experimental and unsupported, which means don't report a crash bug without a patch to fix it.\n. Unable to reproduce. Provide a file.. We use Qt to load images, so this is likely a big in Qt or the version of it we are using.. Closing because GPU Effects is unsupported without a patch/pull request. Next version 18.11 makes this more obvious.. That is fine and I think ARCHIVE is the correct flag as it corresponds to packaging.. I think this is a good call now. Thanks for thinking of it! And the contribution of course.. I had to change the graphics card on my Linux box recently, and I need to get some new adapter or cables to be able to test this. I think this might a Qt issue. Both the portable and the snap use the same version of bundled Qt: 5.6.1. It would be great and appreciated if you can test the Flatpak because it uses Qt 5.11 the last time I checked.. I am not very interested this because the saving is insignificant, and I maintain these from other sources where icons are added over time. I would be interested in a pull request that integrates with the build system or github.\n. I need a process that can be repeated, and I do not want it to to depend on a crapload of utilities.  Pick one or two and integrate it as a make target in either src/src.pro or new scripts/Makefile. Then, I can periodically run make to repeat the process when icons are changed or added. Thanks\n. Superseded by #706 . Do you have GPU Effects on?. > Shotcut version 18.10.08.02 \nThis is not our build and not supported. I do not reproduce the problem with our builds or development builds.. Most relevant line from the log for those trying to debug:\n[Error  ] <MLT> [consumer sdl2_audio] Failed to initialize SDL: Audio target 'esd' not available\nesd = Enlightenment Sound Daemon\nPerhaps the user needs to be added to a certain group. Perhaps there is an incorrect environment variable unintentionally directing SDL to use esd.\n. @TMP-StephenH Your log does not contain the SDL error, and you did not even describe the problem. What does \"it will not work\" mean?\n\nIf this is not the proper place to try to trace down this problem, please refer me to the proper person.\n\nSee https://admin.rpmfusion.org/pkgdb/package/free/shotcut/\n@martinkg is the maintainer\n. This problem applied to all filters and not only crop. Good find! Thank you for reporting it.. Feature requests are not accepted without a patch.. > Shotcut: 18.10.08.2, Qt: 5.11.1\nThis is not our build and unsupported, but this is probably a legitimate issue with our usage of the Qt SQL API. I suspect it was due to commit 2d8985ba.\n. That is a beta, and betas do not include AppImage.. This is by design. The LC_NUMERIC attribute declares how the numbers are stored in the XML document. MLT for Linux reads this attribute and converts the numeric string to a number type using the specified locale.. Unfortunately, this is due to a technical issue with an early fundamental design decision of MLT called properties that are not strongly typed and can be set as string and interpreted as a number. User-facing interfaces that should allow users to use locale-specific numerics can set the property as a string, or a property read as a string can be passed-through the system. As a result, Shotcut must convert a document from a foreign locale to the current one, but that does not completely prevent collaboration. It may, however, fail to convert some property values (e.g. filters) and not work well for all workflows (e.g. git). I agree this is a shortcoming, but there is no easy fix, and it does not affect 99% of the users. I would like to change something in MLT to make it possible to store things in a locale-agnostic manner, but I still need to revisit that more deeply.. I want something like a make target integrated into src.pro:\ncodespell:\n    codespell -w -q 3 \\\n    -L shotcut,sav,boundry,percentil,readded,uint,ith,sinc,amin,childs,seeked,writen \\\n    -S ChangeLog,cJSON.c,cJSON.h,RtAudio.cpp,RtAudio.h,*.rej,mlt_wrap.*\nAlso, export-edl.js is a generated file and should be excluded.\n. I added the make target in 6bea957. . > Shotcut-version : 18.11.18.02 (disabled GPU effects)\nFedora: 29\nThis is not a build created and supported by us. I do not know the version of MLT used in this, and that might be a factor as I did not reproduce this on macOS. I will try on Linux next using one of our builds.\n. I only experienced something extremely minor on Linux using my build with MLT 6.12.0, RES: 271366 -> 310308 when holding Enter for 2 minutes.. The flatpak uses the MLT git master from the date of the build. So, the big difference between what you are testing and myself is Qt version. The v18.11.18 flatpak (and probably also your Fedora package) of Shotcut uses Qt 5.11 while mine and the other builds (portable and appimage) are using Qt 5.6.\n\nIt seems like duplicate stats are run, two open calls for mp4 file ?\n\nYes, each audio/video file is opened twice with libavformat in order to maintain a/v synchronization while seeking. Ideally, it should not be needed, but that is the way it is with no plans to change it.\n. 100% alpha to me means opaque whereas 0% is transparent, but I understand what you mean.\nActually, it seems to lighten it by 1 8-bit value in the blue channel. Ideally, the color eyedropper shows rgb(50, 50, 50) but it does not due to YUV-RGB conversion rounding errors.\n\n\n\nShotcut uses the cairographics library for compositing.. As far as I can determine, this is actually an inaccuracy in the color generator's RGB to YUV conversion coefficients for the BT.601 colorspace. If I force the color generator to use ARGB, which I had planned to do to let FFmpeg libswscale convert it to the target colorspace more accurately, then I get this result for the lower track, which is the same values for the composited positions:\n\n. Reopen if you can provide hard evidence of #2 from your list.. Here is evidence of #2.\n\nThis appears to be an inaccuracy in the libswscale conversion of YUV to RGB as needed to perform the compositing because when the cursor is not over a clip on V2, the color is as expected per the above screenshots. When there is no compositing (and no filters), there is no RGB conversion.\n\n. I tried many different combinations of swscale flags, but it did not make a difference.. Steps to determine if swscale, MLT, or Shotcut issue:\n\nCreate gray (50, 50, 50) in GIMP and export as BMP\nffmpeg -i 'rgb 50-50-50 640x360.bmp' 'rgb 50-50-50 - ffmpeg.mp4'\nffplay 'rgb 50-50-50 - ffmpeg.mp4'\na color eyedropper (I wrote a quick app using Qt Creator and Qt Quick's FontDialog API) verifies the color is still 50,50,50. This confirms ffmpeg with swscale RGB->YUV is OK.\nI reproduced the same in v18.11.18 of Shotcut using the BMP with (mlt_image_format=rgb24) in Export > Other. This confirms swscale RGB->YUV is OK.\nI reproduced the same in dev version of Shotcut using the color generator with (mlt_image_format=rgb24) in Export > Other.  This confirms Shotcut color generator with swscale RGB->YUV is OK.\nffmpeg -i 'rgb 50-50-50 - ffmpeg.mp4' 'rgb 50-50-50 - ffmpeg.bmp'\nffplay 'rgb 50-50-50 - ffmpeg.bmp'\neyedropper shows 50,50,50. This confirms ffmpeg with swscale YUV->RGB is OK.\nmelt 'rgb 50-50-50 - ffmpeg.mp4' -consumer 'avformat:rgb 50-50-50 - melt.bmp' vcodec=bmp\neyedropper shows 50,50,50. This confirms MLT with swscale YUV->RGB is OK.\nopen 'rgb 50-50-50 - ffmpeg.mp4'  in Shotcut (Video Mode 720p50) and use eyedropper on its preview\neyedropper shows 50,49,50. This shows Shotcut's viewer has an issue. It uses MLT to render to yuv420p and then uses OpenGL shader to convert to RGB. This code probably has a slightly incorrect coefficient for the conversion.\nexport this from Shotcut as default MP4, open the result with ffplay\neyedropper shows 49.49.49. Then, I notice 'rgb 50-50-50 - ffmpeg.mp4' has yuv444p while this file has yuv420p (most typical delivery pixel format).\nffmpeg -i 'rgb 50-50-50 640x360.bmp' -pix_fmt yuv420p 'rgb 50-50-50 - ffmpeg - yuv420p.mp4'\nffplay 'rgb 50-50-50 - ffmpeg - yuv420p.mp4'\neyedropper shows 47,50,47. This means some inaccuracy occurs due to subsampled chroma. MLT renders to yuv422 internally before converting to yuv420p for shotcut preview or encoding.\nffmpeg -i 'rgb 50-50-50 640x360.bmp' -pix_fmt yuv422p 'rgb 50-50-50 - ffmpeg - yuv422p.mp4' followed by ffplay and eyedropper gives 50,50,50.  This confirms ffmpeg with swscale RGB->YUV422 is OK.\nmelt -profile atsc_720p_50 'rgb 50-50-50 640x360.bmp' -consumer 'avformat:rgb 50-50-50 - melt - yuv422p.mp4' pix_fmt=yuv422p gives 49,49,49. This confirms a problem in MLT with swscale RGB->YUV conversion.\n\nIn hindsight, the eyedroper on Shotcut preview might be a subsampled chroma issue since the input was 4:4:4 downsampled to 4:2:2 and then 4:2:0 for delivery (4:2:0 is the least amount of data to transfer over PCIe bus to GPU and closest to most export targets).\nNext, I notice in MLT debug log output:\nyuv422 @ 640x360 space 601->709\n...\n[swscaler @ 0x7f50bc90a780] YUV color matrix differs for YUV->YUV, using intermediate RGB to convert\nWhen the input has no colorspace transfer characteristic signaling, MLT assumes SD resolution or less uses BT.601. Adding force_colorspace=709 after the producer on the melt command line makes the messages go away but does not help. Changing swscale flags to add SWS_FULL_CHR_H_INT fixed the melt command line output of the last step! However, incorporating this change into all uses of swscale has not fixed the timeline test project. :(\nIf I edit the test project and change the transition to qtblend or frei0r.composition, the problem goes away. This implies a problem with frei0r.cairoblend. With more troubleshooting, I found a rounding bug in the premultiply alpha function it uses to prepare the images for cairo.\n. You can download the nightly build with these fixes in portable tarball format here:\nhttp://build.mltframework.org/viewLog.html?buildId=59766&buildTypeId=bt36&tab=artifacts\n. > I also see two Audio Opnened during close in the app log.\nThis is expected because File > Close does not really close; rather, it opens a color producer twice and hides it. Yes, it is a kludge to prevent having to avoid doing deeper level work to really disconnect and close things. It is not high on my list of things to do. It would be helpful if you can supply a patch.\n. I am not going to add gzip upon install, and I am removing the version number from the man page because I did not want to maintain the version number for every highly build and monthly release. If you need changes for these things, you need to submit a patch. For example, you need to figure out how to turn the page into a template where the version variable gets substituted.\n. Thank you for finding the bug in the code.. This is not a build made by us and is unsupported. Ask the people who made your build to debug it.. We had to change it from percentages when adding support for animation keyframes. We are actually trying to figure out a way to go back to the percentages to facilitate changing project resolution or using a proxy media workflow.. I am quite sure this is because you have the cladpsa package installed. More is info here:\nhttps://forum.shotcut.org/t/shotcut-does-not-start-with-free-invalid-pointer-error-on-ubuntu-studio-18-04-lts/7641/5\nIn short, try uninstalling 'csladspa' and try again. This bug is not under our direct control, but it appears since we started providing the swh LADSPA plugins with our builds.\n. New version 18.12.23 going up today that includes a workaround for the csladspa issue.. This is unsupported as it requires a Qt plugin that is not provided in our builds. This is one of the drawbacks of a self-contained build - we are not going to provide specialty Qt plugins with the Qt we provide. You can look for a distro-provided shotcut package, but they tend to poor quality and out-of-date. We are not going to complicate our already difficult build process to include this (besides other considerations, it would require bundling a bunch of XFCE-libs that most users do not need).. Sorry, but I do not know. I know about a Qt plugin for Unity global menu, and I assume there is something for XFCE. It is not easy because our Qt version is different than your system/distro Qt version. :(. This is not a bug. Things change. Click the track header and view properties to disable blending aka compositing.. So far I have not reproduced it. I do not think you need to re-compile qmelt. You can easily try to build MLT from the SDK using the same flags (minus --enable-debug) as the release build. I run tail -2 config.log and then re-run configure by converting the paths to my locations (C:\\Projects\\Shotcut). Then, you can run make distclean, followed by reconfigure, make -j all, make install. If you can reproduce with the SDK shotcut.exe after that then you can tinker with placement of mlt_service_lock()/mlt_service_unlock() calls placed in qtext to see if the problem goes away. I will continue to try to reproduce it off-and-on. (I also tried on macOS with no reproduction.)\n. I reproduced the text alignment bug here, and it is probably the same race condition:\nhttps://forum.shotcut.org/t/text-alignment-after-rendering/8963/\nA big problem is that qtext is inspecting filter properties inside its get_image routine while the dynamictext filter is setting them in its process routine. There is a technique to create a unique properties object that I will lookup and try to employ.. I think this is fixed in https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/0e2044f61cb8bb67e8452fd0fb324938c19b027d\nAt least what I could reproduce with horizontal alignment was fixed. You can test a release build tomorrow for the text dropouts.. I already put a big lock around the majority of the body of qtext get_image, but it did not work. Some lock in there may need to be combined with a lock on the text filter inside dynamictext's process.. I was not able to get service locks to work, but I did get mlt_frame_unique_properties() to work. Please review the following branch:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/2183778b2a296fd2ae2f7642da87161736cb07af\nI removed the encoding property because it is not available on the unique properties and the MLT convention is that all strings are UTF-8 and should be converted to that before setting or converted from that after getting.\n. I tested it by reverting the previous commit where I can easily reproduce it.\nAs for applying this to other filters, yes it is a good way to remove locks. I think I should add a mlt_frame_get_unique_properties().. 64-bit Windows build is fixed now if you want to test this.. It works for me assuming you are using a snap provided by this project through the snap store and not some alternative. Can you confirm that ALSA audio works on your system and user?\nDid you have a previous version that worked?\nThis should not be a dependency problem as Shotcut snap supplies nearly all of its dependencies now.. Here is all we have on the dependencies, and this page is linked to from the Downloads page very near to the paragraph you quoted:\nhttps://shotcut.org/notes/linux-dependencies/\nUsing alsamixer is not a good enough test. Consider using aplay. If you have jackd running then it could have the alsa device locked. Shotcut does not directly ALSA; it uses SDL which has different audio providers that it tries except it does not support JACK. If you use JACK, then you should setup PulseAudio because many apps including SDL include a provider for it, and it can cooperate with JACK.\n. It is a problem specific to your system that I am not going to troubleshoot for you.. I suspect there might be something going wrong with temporary QString objects returned from calls to QFileInfo methods.. According to a user on the forum, the workaround in the KDE bug report worked for him, and he is not using the flatpak.\n. Is this backwards compatible with existing projects? Does it still work with Movit?. I have seen the waveform not display completely as you describe especially when zoomed in on the timeline, but I have not found the cause yet.\nAre you able to repeat the steps for this crash? I am not reproducing it. Please explain exactly how you are deleting because there are multiple ways. Also, let me know if Ripple All Tracks is turned on in the Timeline menu and if you have more than one track.\nWindows crash logs are in C:\\Users\\All Users\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WER\\ReportArchive, but they never contain enough information to help me. The debug build of shotcut.exe in the SDK produces meaningful crash logs with code symbols that can help more, but I still need to be able to reproduce it almost at will in order to confirm a fix. If you can repeat the steps to crash, then it will be helpful to get shotcut.RPT located alongside shotcut.exe.\nThere are a few places on the web site that link to GitHub especially the new Contribute  page and the \"GitHub repository\" link near the bottom of the Download page. Most users do not understand the meaning of a bug versus a question or feature request, and I do not want to use GitHub Issues as a discussion forum. So, most users are directed through the Forum, which is prominent.\n. Of course, the edges will be noticeable; they have different sizes and their pixel values are different along the edges. However, I think I see the problem you are experiencing. If the first clip has a Size and Position filter on it; then, in the transition, it does not properly fade out. Unfortunately, I have not found a fix this that will not also break some compositing behavior with multiple tracks. A workaround is to add a Crop with the Center option to the second image to make it fill the screen.\nNote: This issue is not new to this beta.\n. A workaround by editing the MLT XML is to locate the <filter> with <property name=\"shotcut:filter\">affineSizePosition</property> that is a child of the first clip's <producer> element. Then, change\n<property name=\"background\">colour:0</property>\n\nto\n<property name=\"background\">colour:0x000000ff</property>\n\n. My oldest system is macOS 10.10, so I cannot test builds on older versions and provide support. Glad to hear that it works for you. I am in the process of upgrading Qt, and Qt 5.9 specifies 10.10 as a minimum. However, I am actually testing newer versions. I want to maintain 10.10 compatibility, and it looks like Qt 5.11.1 is the last version to support it although I might go also with 5.9.7.\n. I found my hackintosh HDD with OS X 10.8 on it, and changing LSMinimumSystemVersion does not work for me. Neither, does v19.02.20 BETA that uses Qt 5.9.7. They each crash in a different location. This will not be addressed and closing it. I was able to confirm that v19.02.20 runs on macOS 10.10, which is the minimum as stated before. Support for that version of macOS 10.10 prevents us from using the latest Qt LTS v5.12 and instead using 5.9.. None of these messages are actual problems or show the cause of the crash.\nI too have experienced some decreased stability, and I see more crashes occurring within Qt. I think it corresponds to when I started to bundle many more libraries trying to increase the independence/portability of the \"portable tar,\" AppImage, and snap versions. There is also the fact that the Qt we are bundling was built on Ubuntu 14.04, but with version 18.12.x started to build Shotcut on Ubuntu 16.04 for the VA-API integration. I am in the process of upgrading Qt and building both Qt and Shotcut on Ubuntu 16.04. (18.04 is not used to increase compatibility.) I will have a beta version of that soon for you to try.\n. closing for no update and no reliable way to reproduce. There was a beta and a new release in the past 3 weeks. It is based on a completely new build of Qt on same version of OS and compiler as MLT and Shotcut build. I did not get feedback on either of these versions. Please test on the new version 19.02.28. QList::const_reverse_iterator was added in Qt v5.6. No older version is supported by Shotcut or Qt. Qt 5.6 is an old LTS release that is losing support in March. There are 5.9 and 5.12 LTS releases since then. The next version of Shotcut builds are using 5.9.7. We are not going to make changes to our code to support older versions. Patch it yourself. . We do not provide support for third party builds (Void Linux xbps). Use one of our builds, debug it yourself, or ask a Void Linux developer to debug it.. With that said, it sounds like Qt Quick's, which we use, usage of OpenGL is incompatible with your system's OpenGL. There is nothing we will do about removing the dependence on OpenGL, which is stated as requirement in the FAQ.. No verification of compatibility with existing non-flatpak builds means this must wait until after the next release.. I confirmed this is working.. This breaks loading existing settings on macOS. Also, technically, the organization responsible for Shotcut is Meltytech, whose domain is meltytech.com and shotcut.org is the product website. You should consider changing the name of the desktop file. Does that mean the package name must change to com.meltytech.Shotcut? That would be confusing for users to change and remember. I am open to a compile define macro to change this for flatpak.. OK, please add setDesktopFileName(\"org.shotcut.Shotcut\"); inside the #ifdef Q_OS_LINUX. Also, I think this change could apply to BSD in which case it should be #if defined(Q_OS_UNIX) && !defined(Q_OS_MAC). Yes, because Shotcut's Application inherits from QCoreApplication.. What is the problem or question? I do not see a problem in final_MI.txt.\nIf you are changing Export > Advanced > Resolution or Frames/sec, then do not do that. Instead, choose or create a Video Mode in either Settings or New Project at the beginning and then export as-is.. There is a little risk with people not agreeing with the approach:\n- modifying file system instead of embedded metadata\n- not performed by clicking column heading\n- not available in image properties dialog\nHowever, I am going to accept it nevertheless; just sharing my anticipation/concern. \n. I want the minimum version to be 5.9.0.. This is a known issue, but we do not make or support the gentoo package nor do any of the developers run gentoo in order to help troubleshoot it. Talk to gentoo.. > Shotcut would display a warning message about the plugins that it couldn't load and the cause for that.\nNot a bad idea, but the problem is that our binary releases often depend on newer versions of FFmpeg, frei0r, and MLT than appears in most distros. In that case, distro users would be nagged, which would get annoying. Of course, we could add an ignore checkbox to that dialog.\n\nfor some obscure reason Shotcut expects melt binary to be named as \"qmelt\"\n\nqmelt is not so obscure. It is a wrapper provided by WebVfx that makes Qt and GPU effects (i.e. Movit, probably another thing missing in your package) work reliably. WebVfx is a separate project that Shotcut makes fairly heavy use of.  This gentoo package is very poor quality, and I resent that it is called Shotcut. It would be great if you can improve it. The flatpak config represents a rather concise and comprehensive definition of a valid build (much cleaner than the 2500 line bash script we use to make all builds). Please note, however, that Shotcut does not depend on KDE, the flatpak developer chose that as a base for some reason (probably more bundled dependencies).\n. > the widest image dimension in the playlist\nThat info is not available and very difficult to implement and going to introduce bugs. Besides why playlist only and not the entire project? Why not only the producer to which the filter is applied? That would be easier even though info is not available in the filter UI API at this time. Anyways, all this is much work when there is more important things to do at this time.\n. FYI, this was closed because I already increased the limit for the offset parameters. I will make another change for the Scale parameter. Yes, there is very low risk to these changes. The reason to make limits is simply to make a usable range for the slider control. If the range is extremely large and most people spend most of their time in like 20% of the overall range, then it is not so usable. However, in this case, I agree the limits need to be increased. I am also going to think about changing our SliderSpinner control to allow the spinner to have a separate max (or numeric max) from the slider such that one could type in a number to override.\n. This is not a bug. There is plenty of beginner info on the web site, YouTube, and in the forum. Use those resources or purchase this course:\nhttps://betterbusiness.zenler.com/courses/video-editing-made-easy-with-shotcut-video-editor&affiliate=1367\n. It is by design that shotcut:detail uses absolute path; that is the detail. This is only used for annotation as a tool tip; it is not used to locate files. Relative paths to media assets on the <property name=\"resource\"> in the XML should be working for files in the project folder. Provide an example MLT XML file with the problem or the steps to circumvent or break this.\n. > display a dialog whenever users import a file located outside the project so that they can have the option to either copy/move it to the project folder \nI do not plan to use a dialog; rather, there will be options to copy or move in the New Project view, and then it just happens always for that project.. Yes, I had been suspecting the mixed usage of slashes is causing a problem. The code that ensures a path is relative is only doing a comparison at the beginning of strings to trim them and is sensitive to slash direction. The software for file operations does not care about the direction of slashes, but I know the forward slashes confuses some windows users. I will try a change to ensure all file paths on Windows use backslashes. That should address this issue (the main one raised) as well as the paths displayed to users.\n. I think the problem is that the image gets rendered to full resolution, text composited, and then scaled to project resolution. Then, export interpolation setting probably has a bearing. Is it less of a problem when using Bicubic and Hyper/Lanczos?\n@bmatherly can you please take a look at this?. I think another workaround is to use a text clip (Open Other > Text) on a video track above the background image on a lower video track.. Thanks, @bmatherly, but I found it is also easy to get into this situation when you have Text with thickness 0 on transparent clip (text clip) on a video track higher than V1 with nothing on V1. It would be nice to remove this sharp edge entirely. Why not set the minimum thickness to 1, and change the default Outline color to transparent? When you change the outline color, it defaults to change to opaque (at least on Windows). That would also solve the minor usability issue that today if you simply change the outline color, you do not see a change until you increase thickness.. > Did you test setting thickness to 1 with a transparent outline color?\nI thought it worked when I wrote that but not so upon retesting.\n\nChanging the outline color to opaque might be an idea.\n\nI meant to only change the default outline color to transparent. It already switches to opaque when the current color is transparent and the user picks a new color. I do not want to change anything there.\nI see that in Open Other > Text, I chose to default the outline to translucent black with thickness 3. Could switch to that for consistency and dull this sharp edge.\nAnother idea is that when thickness is 0, set the MLT filter's outline=1 and olcolour=fgcolour.\n. Yes, you included the project in itself. I already added code to not allow that, but you found a loophole. I need to know how you did it in order to make a code fix. Meanwhile, I fixed your project. \nbdomage.mlt.txt\n. I just tried several ways of adding to the playlist, and I could not figure out a way to bypass the check.. P.S. All I did to find this problem is open the .mlt file in a text editor and search for \"bdoimage.mlt\". I found something <producer id=\"playlist0\">. Then, I found that referenced in an <entry> within <playlist id=\"main bin\">. To fix it, I removed the <producer id=\"playlist0\"> that is referring to itself. Then, I removed the now invalid playlist <entry>.. There was more the 1 instance of bdoimage.mlt appearing within itself. The second one was left for you as an exercise. ;-) Just kidding. I overlooked it. Here it is again.\nbdomage-fixed-2.mlt.txt\nI found the loophole in your screencast video - dragging from Recent to Playlist. Sometimes, I forget that you can drag from recent. I am not sure why you are doing something that is known to cause a big problem, but it will be nice to fix this.\n\ni just tried doing a full reinstall but somehow it keeps showing up without a reset.\n\nOn Windows, there is a a registry, and you have to use App Data Directory > Set... to make it use an INI file for settings instead of the registry. See FAQ.\n. The XML DLL (libmltxml.dll) is failing to load, which is required to process the export job XML. I do not know why; no one else has reported this problem, and the error in your log contains garbage characters. What is interesting is that Shotcut GUI depends on this DLL as well, and that must be working. The export job is executed using a different, console program called qmelt, and that is the program failing to load the DLL.\nDid a previous version of Shotcut work for you, or is this your first version to try?\nSomething to try: In D:\\Program Files\\Shotcut, create an empty file named qmelt.exe.local. There is a shotcut.exe.local that is empty if you want to simply copy it. Does it work after that?\n. You cannot use a colon for assignment here. This needs to read \"tipTimer.interval = 1000\".\nUpdate: OK, it works, but technically this is incorrect JavaScript, and Qt Creator highlights it as such. To prevent possible problems, we should make this change.\n. Why not Qt.ToolTip? This combination of flags is doing some slightly funky things on OS X 10.9. Based on my experience with some window-related things, I anticipate potentially more problems on 10.7. I have not tested on other platforms yet. \n. To be more consistent with Qt QML style, I recommend to rename this as mousePos() and possibly as a Q_PROPERTY. \"Mouse\" is more obvious and natural. I know QCursor::pos() is static, but as soon as you put \"Utilities {}\" into QML, it makes an object.\n. Hmm, right now, TAR_APP_PACKAGE and KEEP_BUILD_FILES would be Linux-only options. This script really has startup-scripts, archiving, and cleanup co-mingled. That could be split up, but that is also a lot to change and test and a separate issue. Also, skipping the \"deploy\" step is of dubious value on Windows and OS X since you cannot really use them without it. Also, I have felt the current ACTION_ options are rather awkward, and perhaps all this should be:\nACTION_CLEAN_SOURCES\nACTION_GET\nACTION_COMPILE\nACTION_INSTALL\nACTION_ARCHIVE\nACTION_CLEAN_INSTALL\nNow, with all that said, I think that set of changes is well outside the scope of metellius' itch. :o) So, I am inclined to accept this as-is hoping to change it soon. IOW, while I kind of agree with Brian about the name, I do not think that is worth changing the commit especially when it is due to be changed with a general cleanup anyways.\n. True, but per my previous comment, the renaming is not worth the effort of redoing the commit when this is going to be changed.\n. I  agree.\n. Now, after analysis is complete and you leave the filter and return to it, it says Analysis required. That is because the option values are loaded when the UI loads, which triggers this function and clears the results. Clearing results really does make analysis required. If you remove this line there is stil a race condition that typically causes this function to be called and give the superficial impression that it is. The solution is to make a top-level Component.onCompleted script block that controls the order of setting option values, the button state, and label. I did that and also refactored some things as well.\n. I prefer to use qstrcmp() when comparing C strings.\n. Never compare with NULL. use if (!AutoSavePath.isEmpty.isEmpty()) instead.\n. Global should static, start with g_ prefix, and initializing QString will NULL is non-sensel as QString is not a pointer.\n. use if (!AutoSavePath.isEmpty.isEmpty()) instead\n. I am thinking we should invert this commit. Instead of storing several globals, setting them, and comparing against them; we should make our DataDir somewhere that is initialized from QStandardPaths, set by command line option, and then read it wherever today we read QStandardPaths::DataLocation.\n. Change the tooltip based on the current state: Mute or Unmute - not hyphenated.. Use m_scrubber->geometry().height() instead of hard-coded 32, and keep the 8.. The multi consumer is used when using decklink for monitoring. Unfortunately, the DeckLink API only accepts the values 2, 8, or 16 which does not match our multi-channel use cases well at all. I found out because 6 was failing to initialize and looked it up. I was able to hack it to use 8, but the audio was very distorted, and my receiver could not understand it (even though it is 7.1).\nSetting \"1.channels\" here to target decklink does not work because it is overridden by the multi consumer (all the consumers need to be in sync on this parameter). Really, for now, we need to hide the Audio Channels in the Settings menu when using a decklink for external monitoring.. The height needs to increase to make canvas larger for proper scrolling when the filter dock is small and shows scroll bars.. Why not Pixelize instead of Mosaic? People may expect something more artistic from Mosaic.. The obscure filter is similar and has a rectangle parameter but lacks size parameters. Hmm. CuteLogger is not our code; it is imported from another project. I do not want to revise all their code like this.. drmingw is also imported code that I do not want to update like this.. export-edl.js is a generate file where this line came from a node.js npm module - more code I do not want to maintain.. I have to use cleanbuild. Is there a way to support these additional commands? I could alter my process to use a docker container instead of cleanbuild. I will give that a try before deciding.. QMAKE_INFO_PLIST in src.pro needs to change for this. . Shotcut uses \"application/mlt+xml\" to identify some things placed on the clipboard. And then, for whatever reason - probably lack of detailed scrutiny - Info.plist uses \"text/mlt+xml\". Let's switch everything over to \"application/vnd.mlt+xml\". I will take care of the Shotcut source code changes for that. \"+xml\" is preferred over \"-xml\" because it is a suffix.. I consistently use \"MLT XML\" as the standard name for these files in Shotcut, Info.plist, and both the Shotcut and MLT websites.. desktop-file-edit fails with an error:\nsnap/gui/shotcut.desktop: error: value \"${SNAP}/meta/gui/shotcut-logo-64.png\" for key \"Icon\" in group \"Desktop Entry\" looks like a relative path, instead of being an absolute path to an icon or an icon name. This approach with snapcraft prime and snap works for the icon (if you target the directory prime/meta/gui), but snapcraft is deleting the desktop file from both the prime dir and the installed snap! Otherwise, the ideal place for these commands is in an override-stage key in the part.\nHowever, I am struggling to get that to work. What does work is moving package.mak into the parent directory with this:\nsnap:\n    mkdir -p snap/meta/gui\n    cp ../../icons/shotcut-logo-64.png snap/gui\n    cp org.shotcut.Shotcut.desktop snap/gui/shotcut.desktop\n    sed -i 's|Icon=.*|Icon=${SNAP}/meta/gui/shotcut-logo-64.png|' snap/gui/shotcut.desktop\n    snapcraft cleanbuild\nNice thing about that is I can add a target for the appimage as well.. Copyright (c) 2018 Meltytech, LLC\nAnd you can leave out the authorship info. We should start doing that, in general, Brian as we have git log and typically multiple authors.\n. There is no 'start' property on this filter. You can remove that line.. Use LOG_ERROR() instead of qDebug() as that uses our logging framework.\nIt would be nice at this point to let the user know, but from this point in the code that is difficult. :-(\n. m_filter.inherit() is preferred here. Yeah, I know the name \"inherit\" kinda sucks.. Preference now is to use smart pointers:\nQScopedPointer<Mlt::Properties> properties(Mlt::Properties::parse_yaml(dir.filePath(name).toUtf8().constData()));. nullptr is C++11, which will not compile successfully everywhere yet (due to lack of proper compiler flags being set). The next upgrade to Qt requires C++11, and we will start using it then.. Should this string be translatable?. Should this string be translatable?. \"resource\" can be multiple files and folders and is optional. GNU ls uses [FILE]....

I think the opaque white occurs when webvfx can't load the HTML file. Could this be a path issue?\n. I can't reproduce this on Ubuntu 12.10. Does this occur regularly for you on all platforms? Maybe it is unique to a particular video resolution or format?\n. RE ToolTip: I agree. There should only be one. The one I wrote uses a window to display the tool tip. The reason is that a QML component can't exceed the boundary of its quickview. So longer tool tips in the filter dock would be clipped by the preview window (rather than being displayed over it). Using a window is not ideal, but I can't find another way to keep the tool tips from clipping in our hybrid QML/QWidget environment. So I propose that we use the one I wrote.\nRE tooltip colors: I would have to question how important it is to use the two tooltip colors from QApplication::palette(). Based on my research in both Linux and Windows, toolTipBase resolves to \"palette.highlight\" and toolTipText resolves to \"palette.light\". I used the later in both cases and my tooltip looks like the native tips in Linux. Interestingly, in Windows, QWidget based tooltips use colors that are different from toolTipBase and toolTipText. So there is no way to make them match in Windows - even with the QApplication palette. However, I do agree that if we want to expose those colors, utilities would be a good place to do that.\nRE QmlUtilities: I agree - it should be done the same everywhere. I would be inclined to expose it as a type (as I did) rather than a context property because it doesn't have any statefulness - it is just a collection of static functions. But I can go either way. If we do expose it as a property, I think we should rename the property to \"utilities\".\nLet me know how you want to go on ToolTips and QmlUtilities and I can make the changes.\n. I see what you mean. I'm looking into the use of qmlRegisterSingletonType() to see if I can create a singleton that can be accessed from QML and MainWindow safely. It seems to work, but I get a double free error on program exit. I think QML takes ownership of the pointer and frees it when the app closes. I'll keep investigating.\n. 0adf49f9c6f8b5730e7cd6f657b2855b787a83e8 is my proposed resolution to the comments above.\nA couple of points:\n- I repurposed QmlUtilities. It's new responsibility is to facilitate the registration of QML types.\n- I created a new singleton which I called \"application\" (open to suggestions) which provides access to common user interface properties like the tool tip colors and dialog modes.\n- All the QML types are now registered once when the application starts. So all QuickViews that we ever create will have access to them. And there is one place to modify when a new type needs to be added.\n- I created a common function for creating context properties in QmlUtilities. This function must be called whenever a QuickView is created. I tried to use qmlRegisterSingletonType() instead, but it didn't work out because the QML engine takes ownership of the pointer.\nLet me know what you think.\n. That would be expected behavior in that particular configuration. There are two ways you can avoid it:\n1) Choose a fixed width font\n2) Reduce the height of the text box so that the text size is dictated by the box height rather than its width. That way changes in the width of the text won't affect its height.\n. Thanks for the excellent report. I wish every report was as well described as this one.\nThis is a known issue. I agree that it would be nice if the UI was always left in a consistent state. Unfortunately, the fix is not simple.\n. I like the idea of being able to recreate a build with the exact same dependencies it was created with the first time. But we lose something here - and that is knowing when the latest version of a dependency has broken our build. I wonder if we should have a switch that allows one to specify that the latest version should be used for all dependencies (or maybe a particular dependency). That way I can set up an automated build that builds against the latest of each dependency every day (or week).\nAnother thing that we lose is the ability to specify the branch/version in the config script. It would be nice if you hadn't taken that out.\nI'll let @ddennedy  make the final call on this one.\n. While I generally agree that it would be good to lock the build to a specific revision rather than \"HEAD\", this hasn't been a huge problem for us so far. I feel like update-revs.sh is an overly complicated solution relative to the small benefit that we get.\nHow about this for a proposal:\n1. Put the script back to the way it was\n2. Use the *_REVISION parameters at the top of build-shotcut.sh to specify a specific revision for each project.\n3. Each month, after the release, we can manually update the revisions and make a commit.\nHere is what I like about this:\n1. The revisions can still be easily overridden by the user in build-shotcut.conf\n2. Updating the revisions is a simple operation that can happen at the same time that we increment the version number after a release.\n3. We will all spend the next one month development cycle testing the updated revisions which will increase the chances that we detect an incompatibility.\nI still like the ability to specify a project to build so that I can use the script more easily for development. So I would like to see that stay.\n. Ok. I see it your way now. I somewhat disagree with Dan's workflow comments because, personally, I would never use update-revs.sh for my workflow. I think update-revs should be run on some kind of routine, but not frequently by every developer. And I think that build-shotcut.sh could be committed routinely with the updated repositories. We could even make a robot do that (or TeamCity). For example, we could have a builder in Teamcity that runs once every week. When it runs, it would get the latest for all projects, compile, and if they all succeed, it would commit an updated build-shotcut.sh. However, I would still prefer a once-per-month system that aligns with releases.\n. I don't disagree. As I said previously, this hasn't been a big problem for us. The only thing I really wanted was a way to specify which project (if not all of them) should be built - since this would improve my daily workflow. \n@metellius you might want to consider submitting a separate pull request for the subprojects change. We can probably move that forward while we let the dependencies conversation simmer.\n. Yes. That covers it. I am a happy camper :)\n. What version are you using? 15.05.02 fixed a similar sounding issue.\nhttp://shotcutapp.blogspot.com/2015/05/version-1505-re-released.html\nIf you are using 15.05 and you upgrade to 15.05.02, you will have to start your project over since the bug in 15.05 was in the project file itself.\n. I agree that, minimally, we could clear the extension suggestion if they change the format. \nI volunteer to do some research to see if I come up with an amicable solution. If I don't, we can clear the suggestion on format change and call it good. \n. Doesn't work for me, either:\n\"403. That\u2019s an error.\nWe're sorry, but you do not have access to this page. That\u2019s all we know.\"\n. This link does work for me:\nhttps://plus.google.com/communities/111984976401772983232\n. Video card driver seems like a good place to start.\nMaybe also try English Locale.\n. My observation of the patch is that he is moving some of the heavy lifting related to graphical rendering to C++, but the UI is still built in QML. This isn't unlike other QML components that require heavy lifting (colorwheelitem, etc). QT does the very same thing - simple controls are built with QML while advanced controls are implemented in C++.\nWe could maybe debate the abstraction/naming. For example, should \"painteditems.h/cpp\" be renamed to \"TimelineItems\" or something more specific. Otherwise, the file could become a black hole for all future painteditems.\n. > I was hoping we wouldn't have future paintedItems at all really, QQuickPaintedItem\n\nis often slower than implementing custom QQuickItems with scene graph nodes \n(i'm curious whether rendering the waveform graph is an exception or not here).\nBut otherwise, yes, something like TimelineItems would make sense. The names \nof the actual classes and their qml registered names is also very much debatable. \n\nWell, we already have one: ColorWheelItem\nI agree that QQuickItems are preferred over QQuickPaintedItems, but you never know what the future holds.\nMy advice would be to make the file name and class names more specific.\n. Sounds good to me.\n. Dan is right about AV sync being a never ending saga.\n@m9115m I am willing to have a look at it if you make your file available to me. Upload it to Google drive or dropbox and send me a link at code@brianmatherly.com\n. I fixed this specific error with https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/commit/ef8541792482277810f2968c06bb3c2ac403a28c\nHowever, Shotcut will still not build with Qt 5.6 because of webkitwidgets\n. Fixed by 858a4af4e7dfe81936d91ec77d071dda4a3b78fd\n. I might have a chance to look into this in the next week or two.\nIn the meantime, if you are looking for a suggestion...\nI have always been suspicious of the clone function:\nMlt::Frame SharedFrame::clone(bool audio, bool image, bool alpha) const\nThe function is const, but it calls a bunch of non-const functions under the hood. In the case of three active monitors, the clone function will get called three times - once for each monitor. I never tested that the clone function is perfectly thread save. Consider adding a critical section around the clone to see if that helps.\nAlso, the clone function copies some properties - including the producer:\ncloneFrame.inherit(d->f);\ncloneFrame.set(\"_producer\", d->f.get_data(\"_producer\", size), 0, NULL, NULL);\ncloneFrame.set(\"movit.convert\", d->f.get_data(\"movit.convert\", size), 0, NULL, NULL);\ncloneFrame.get_frame()->convert_image = d->f.get_frame()->convert_image;\ncloneFrame.get_frame()->convert_audio = d->f.get_frame()->convert_audio;\nI'm not sure if there might be a side effect of having three frames that have inherited the same properties like that. You could try commenting out some of those and see if it makes any difference.\n. Nice. I'm glad you were able to figure it out.\n. Thinking about this some more...\nI wonder if we should put the lock/unlock in the inherit function itself.\n. I was able to reproduce the issue in shotcut and resolve it by adding lock to the inherit function.\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/ae7af0239d378e4ccc8da402687d735d2f944784\n. @SeaHay Using the new build, try to encode a file while not running as admin.\n. Some things that might help us reproduce the problem:\n- What filters (exactly) are you using?\n- Are the filters applied to the track or to a clip?\n- What steps are you taking when shotcut stops? Provide step-by-step instructions\n- What exactly does \"stop work\" mean? Crash? Freeze?\nSome people provide screenshots or videos to help us see the problem.\n. Thanks for your report.\nPlease do try the latest version as there have been some improvements.\nAlso, please try running Shotcut as administrator (\"right click\"->\"run as Administrator\").\nPlease report back what you find.\n. I think this is a great idea - and is good to go in my opinion. While you are at it with a \"debug\" flag, you might consider also adding a call to GDB in the shotcut script (which is generated by the build-shotcut.sh script).\nI have done this before for debugging MLT. It looks something like this:\ngdb find src/mlt/ -type d -printf '-d %p ' -ex run --args \"$INSTALL_DIR/bin/melt\" $@\nThe use of GDB could be predicated by the debug flag.\nThoughts?\n. I'm no GDB expert. For whatever reason, I had to provide the path to source when i used that.\nGood point about it taking a long time to start. I only do that when I'm debugging a particularly difficult issue. So maybe having it always use GDB is not a good idea. Just throwing it out there. All I know is that every time I want to use GDB I have to google it to remind myself how to launch it. It would be handy for me if it was just a switch somehow. Probably not worth polluting this patch with my GDB idea.\n. Thanks for the tip. I tried reverting that commit. It prints a deprecation warning, but it does still compile. \nUnfortunately, the channels are still not rematrixed properly.\nI took a quick look in ffmpeg, and it seems that the proper method for dowmixing/rematrixing is to use libswresample. I haven't found a way to trick a codec contex into performing the downmix. if it exists, maybe it is hidden somewhere.\nI'm going to keep looking to see if I can find a good path forward.\n. Additional Info:\nfrom avcodec.h:\n/**\n      * Request decoder to use this channel layout if it can (0 for default)\n      * - encoding: unused\n      * - decoding: Set by user.\n      */\n     uint64_t request_channel_layout;\nCompliance with this request is dependent on the decoder. It turns out that the AC3 decoder supports it and the AAC decoder does not. I tested an AC3 file and it did return two channels with proper downmix. So I expect this is not a regression. Rather, it probably had not been tested with AAC previously.\nSome paths forward:\n- Add the downmix matrix to the audiochannels filter.\n- Add channel count to the avresample filter (since ReSampleContext supports rematrix) and make it the preferred normalizer.\n- Create a new normalize filter based on libswrescale.\n. Fixed with https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/1f8ee7769e33b0aceb161ddaafa9eab7112ad7b0\nI added support for 5.1->stereo. I think that will cover 99% use cases. We can add other obscure downmix modes as the need arises. However, to do so, we would probably have to add the concept of channel layout since some channel counts have multiple speakers configurations that apply to them.\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/issues/180\nIf you want to submit a patch that works with 5.6 and 5.5, I would be willing to take a look. But it can not break the official build script:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/scripts/build-shotcut.sh\n. I think I was trying to use the final declaration as a form of self-documenting code to indicate which functions should be implemented by scopes and which functions can not be re-implemented by scopes. Someone could get really confused by re-implementing some of those functions and then accessing members from the wrong thread context. Maybe I'm paranoid.\nI suppose we could solve the problem in two ways:\n1) Remove the final declaration\n2) Make the functions virtual\nI would lean toward number 2 because if someone found a reason to implement any of those functions, I would want to know about it so that I could assess their design strategy.\n. I fixed this specific error with https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/commit/ef8541792482277810f2968c06bb3c2ac403a28c\nHowever, Shotcut will still not build with Qt 5.6 because of webkitwidgets\n. There is no feature for custom timecode formatting.\nThere is a different keyword for localtime that supports an optional formatting string. For example, you can do: #localtime %M:%S#\nBut that will display the minute/seconds for the local computer time, not the video timecode.\nThe timecode related keywords are:\n#smpte_df# - drop frame. Same as ndf for non-fractional frame rates\n#smpte_ndf# - non drop frame\n#frame# - just the frame number\n#timecode# - same as smpte_df\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/issues/180 and https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/issues/215\n. I fixed this specific error with https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/commit/ef8541792482277810f2968c06bb3c2ac403a28c\nHowever, Shotcut will still not build with Qt 5.6 because of webkitwidgets\n. Ok. I see what is going on here. webkit is still part of the Qt source. But they dropped support for it and they exclude it from the official Qt binaries starting with 5.6. Here at Shotcut, we are going to stick with supporting Qt5.5 while we figure out a solution for webkit/webengine. In the mean time, if you (or anyone else using your build) experience any issues, we will ask that you first reproduce the issue with the official Shotcut build before reporting it.\n. I predict that this isn't a problem with the program as much as a problem with how it is responding to your content. Use the audio waveform scope to see if your audio is being clipped during the loud parts. Try applying the gain, compressor or limiter filters to see if you can reduce the clipping during loud sections.\n. I got the file. I hope to take a look at this in the next few days.\n. I have downloaded both files. I can hear a very subtle ticking sound after the cars have gone by in shotcut_export_crackles.mp4. I do not perceive the same ticking sound in the Handbrake_export_fine.m4v so I assume that I am hearing the \"crackling\" sound that you describe. I didn't not expect it to be so subtle.\nCan you also provide the original source file (not transcoded by Shotcut or Handbrake) so that I can try to reproduce the issue?\n. Hmmm. Yes, I think I am able to reproduce the problem with Handbrake_export_fine.m4v\n@notusedyet do you reproduce the problem with Handbrake_export_fine.m4v?\n. I think we have a frame dropping problem. When I compare the audio (exported to Audacity) between the two clips, the Shotcut export is shorter (100ms fewer audio samples) and I see discontinuities in the waveform (where the waveform has a sharp vertical line connecting one sample to another sample). These discontinuities do not exist in the handbrake file. Perhaps the PTS values in the source file are causing seeking problems and therefore frames (or maybe samples) are being dropped.\n\n. I will have to do some more investigation before I can suggest a workaround. You could try transcoding the audio to see if re-encoding it works-around the problem.\n. Today I took another look at this. Previously, I could only reproduce the crackling when the clip was in the timeline but not when it was in the source tab. Today I have just the opposite problem: I can reproduce the crackling in the source tab, but not in the timeline.\nPreviously I was suspicious of the mix transition - thinking that a buffer might be overflowing. But I put in some debug messages and I never see an overflow. Plus, the mix transition is not used when playing from the source player.\nI think the next step would be to look in the avformat producer.\n. I haven't been able to make progress on this. I've unassigned it from myself.\n. I am only able to reproduce this problem with the files that you provided. I have many other files that work fine. So this problem is specific to the files you are using. It is unlikely that I will make this issue a priority (unless someone wants to hire me).\nHave you tried transcoding the files to an intermediate lossless format like DNxHD? I would expect that everything will work fine with transcoded files - and it would be a very simple work-around.\n. Thanks for your contribution. This looks good to me. I think that \"smoothing\" is a good option to add.\nWhen considering your changes, it occurred to me that it might not be obvious to some users what the options do. Since you are saturated on this, would you be willing to add tool tips to all the Stabilize filter options to help people know how to use them? It could be a new pull request and would not have to block this one.\n. Here is an example using ToolTip:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/src/qml/filters/audio_normalize_1p/ui.qml#L25\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/src/qml/filters/audio_normalize_1p/ui.qml#L99\nWe had to make our own because QML does not offer a ToolTip control:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/src/qml/modules/Shotcut/Controls/ToolTip.qml\n. Button is the only control that offers tooltip. When using a button, use the built-in tooltip.\n. +1 from me.\nI recommend putting tooltips in a different pull request. Regarding pulling from properties... We have avoided that in the past because it makes translation difficult. Also, in general, some of the property documentation is written from the perspective of melt or a programmer and not necessarily from the perspective of Shotcut. My advice would be to copy/paste text from the properties if it is appropriate and then modify/embellish it to make it as user friendly as possible within Shotcut.\n. I agree: \"Frames\" is a good unit of measure.\nWhen you go to make tooltips, I would leave out the (2N +1) equation as it might confuse people. I assume that the equation means: current frame + N frames before + N frames after. I'm not sure users need to know or care about that distinction.\n. Thanks for your work on this. I believe that polishing these kinds of UI issues can make a better experience for users in the long run.\nI am kind of torn on this one. On the one hand, I can appreciate your desire to group the analysis things together. On the other hand, I'm not sure if this change reduces confusion.\nAlso, we should give some consideration to keeping symmetry with the \"Normalize: two pass\" filter. The difference is that the Normalize filter does not have any \"Analyze\" options.\nMaybe the Stabilize filter should be designed to have two \"steps\". The first step would be to configure and run the analysis - with the filter options either disabled or hidden. Then, after analysis is complete, the filter options are available - with an option to \"Re-Analyze\" (or go back to step 1, essentially).\n. I think it is important to force the user to pick a filename so that they are aware that it exists and they manage it just like they should manage their project file and media. I would like it if the user were able to view the file name/path somehow - maybe a tooltip. Also, if I choose analyze a second time, I wish the file chooser dialog would default to the current file that was chosen last time.\n. I am not able to reproduce your problem on my Windows system. But I am not able to use your xml file because I don't have any of the other media files. The provided JPG exports fine for me.\nSome things you can do to help:\n1) Reproduce the problem with the latest version of Shotcut (16.07.01)\n2) Create a minimal project that reproduces the problem. Provide all the media and xml necessary to reproduce the problem, but make sure you pare it down to the bare minimum.\n. Thanks for the test case. Using Shotcut 16.07.01, I can confirm that this problem exists on Windows, but not on Linux.\n@ddennedy I don't have a Windows dev environment set up. Is this something you could take a quick look at?\n. I tested your changes. It works for me. Thanks Dan!\n. @chmorgan Sorry for the noise. When I saw the bug, I jumped to a conclusion because you had been working on it. Thanks again for your help.\n. Where did you get Shotcut from? Did you download it from here?\nhttps://shotcut.org/download/\n. Yes. You will have to talk to the openSUSE packager. We can not possibly support every build from every packager on the planet. So we just support our own build.\n. This is the build script that we use to make our shotcut build:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/scripts/build-shotcut.sh\nYou should be able to infer what you need from it.. Just to add to the confusion... I haven't done a lot of  testing. But try these two things:\n1a) Open the count producer and observe the blip at 2 seconds is 0dBFS\n1B) Drop the count clip on the timeline and observe that the same blip is now -6dBFS\n2a) Open the audio tone producer and observe the tone 0dBFS\n2B) Drop the tone clip on the timeline and observe that the ton is still 0dBFS\nWhy is the count affected, but not the tone?\nAlso, is the solution as simple as adding 6dB of gain to the output of the entire timeline? Or is there some more complicated formula required to get the output level to match the input level for any given clip?\n. Would this make it possible to write video scopes? I have been waiting two years to be able to enable the exiting video waveform scope and to start writing more video scopes:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/src/controllers/scopecontroller.cpp#L39\n. The reason it does not find the libraries in Shotcut.app/lib is because you are not supposed to run bin/shotcut.\nSee the instructions here:\nhttps://shotcut.org/download/\nEither use the Shotcut.desktop file or use the Shotcut.app/shotcut script. DO NOT RUN bin/shotcut. Are you sure you followed the instructions on the download page?\nhttps://shotcut.org/download/\n\nLinux Zip file Users: No install required, simply extract the archive and run it. You can drag the Shotcut folder to copy and move it wherever you want. If double-clicking the icon in your file manager does not launch Shotcut, open Shotcut.app, and try double-clicking the shotcut shell script. Do not try to run bin/shotcut directly. You may need to install the following dependencies from their distribution (the exact names may vary): SDL, libexif, and JACK. A number of the audio filters such as Band Pass, Bass & Treble, Compressor, Delay, Expander, High Pass, Limiter, Low Pass, Notch, and Reverb requires that you install the SWH LADSPA plugins package, which is commonly available in all distributions. Here is a page that lists some required packages for specific distributions.\n. It does run immediately - you just need to run the correct script from the zip file.\n\nContributions are welcome - feel free to take your feature suggestions to the forum. We reserve this issue tracker for bugs.. This is a proposed solution for:\nhttps://forum.shotcut.org/t/audio-channel-monitoring-ch1-left-ch2-right/3846\nFor these applications, one can choose \"All\" audio tracks to get all mono tracks into Shotcut.. To make this issue actionable, you will need to provide more detailed information so that a developer can reproduce it and fix it.  An actionable issue includes detailed instructions of how to produce the problem from scratch from an empty project.\nYou might want to start here: https://forum.shotcut.org/ to see if other users can help you narrow the problem.. I agree that channel labels would be good. I'll look into adding that.\nWith my MLT patch, the following channel layouts are supported:\nhttps://github.com/bmatherly/mlt/blob/surround_convert/src/modules/core/filter_audiochannels.c#L55\nI understand that there are other channel layouts in use, but these are the layouts we get from FFmpeg when we use get_default_channel_layout. So I think we would get a long way to support these and keep using get_default_channel_layout() in the producer/consumer.\nI didn't think about the pan filters, etc. I should look into that to make sure there isn't a conflict.. @ddennedy thanks for testing and reporting. I will try to fix the pause crash in the next couple of days. If I don't get it fixed before the time you need to make a release, feel free to revert the RtAudio commit from MLT.\nI need to make other changes to this review before it will be ready to merge:\n Remove 4 channel configurations (only support mono, stereo and 5.1)\n Set the appropriate channel layout on the consumer (for playout and export).\n* Add channel labels to the audio meter. This PR is superseded by #534 #535 & #536. > Per the thread, after this, the property \"row-mt=1\" needs to be added to our vp8/9 export profiles?\nOr the user could add that in the \"Other\" tab. Would be worth discussing.. > To fix the build for Windows, remove \"--enable-pthreads\" from the ffmpeg configure command line\nDone. Tested fine on Linux.. Is that a transport stream file? TS files are known to have poor seeking. If you are editing a transport stream file and you need frame accuracy, I recommend using an intermediate format. DNxHD or FFV1 would work.. > I've thought that was a basic/handy feature to propose. \nI would encourage you to take your ideas to the forum. There is a captive and active audience there. Feature ideas will receive little consideration in this issue tracker because it is only used for boring stuff like tracking the progress of confirmed bugs - and we like to keep the list of \"open\" issues free of feature requests so that the list doesn't become overwhelming.. Good questions. I hadn't considered that some people might think of those video/picture mosaics where many videos/images combine to make a larger picture.\nI was just thinking about the Premiere \"Mosaic\" effect:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCVNk_9470Y\nI'm mostly interested in the mosaic filter as an artistic effect. But people can combine it with a mask to blur faces if they want (as demonstrated in the Premiere video).\nI hesitate to make a \"face hiding\" filter because the first thing people will ask for is that it track faces.\nI'd like to think about this a little more before we commit the \"Mosaic\" name to this filter. Maybe I'll write something from scratch. . > Why write from scratch? Unless it is being ported to Movit.\nThe only reason to write from scratch would be to combine the two features: ability to specify \"pixel\" size and the ability to specify a region. After a little more research, I don't feel motivated to do that. The mosaic + mask filter should be a good workflow for hiding faces - plus, people can use the mask with blur if they want blurred faces instead of pixelized.\n\nIt is good to know Premiere calls it mosaic. I see Avid does as well. Then, I am fine with it.\n\nGimp has a very similar filter called \"Pixelize\". I you prefer \"Pixelize\", I would be happy to change it. If you prefer \"Mosaic\", then go ahead and merge this as is. I don't feel strongly either way.. Must be a difference in gcc version? I've literally been using for loop initial declarations since I first learned the C language ;). You just download and run the script:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/scripts/build-shotcut.sh\nYou might need to satisfy a few dependencies.\nThat's about all the help I can offer.. I would suggest starting a discussion on the forum:\nhttps://forum.shotcut.org/. > Did you happen to test any v4l or audio capture?\nI did not. Sorry. I have never successfully connected my mic/camera through my development VM.\n. This should not be possible:\n\n[Info   ]  [filter swresample] 2(stereo) s16 48000Hz -> 0(independent) s16 0Hz\n\nI can't even imagine how the consumer could request zero channels. Maybe the root problem, or maybe an unrelated side effect of the root problem.. Makes sense.\nI've noticed a lot of issues on the Forum being solved by people turning off \"GPU Processing\". So I thought this might help out. Feel free to suggest wording changes.. Situation 1 is actually expected behavior. But that may not be clear to all users.\nSituation 2 is fixed by this pull request:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/pull/551/files#diff-3338ecdc765ec0a1d0548ce990a57993R360\nIn the new code, Shotcut will not open the file with the Stabalize effect in GPU mode. It will prompt the user to disable GPU mode.\nIt also adds some text to clarify that some effects will not work:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/pull/551/files#diff-585cfecf0ce15ac75be3038e77e65611R2893\nOpen to comments on the wording. Trying to make it clearer without making it too verbose.. >> This logic could also be moved into the Mlt::Properties save() and load() functions since it maintains backwards compatibility.\n\nI do not like that idea because I prefer mlt++ to be a simple wrapper over the C API.\n\nI agree with that comment. My main point is that is the old key=value style is deprecated and YAML is preferred going forward, the API is not convenient to support that (just look how much extra code it takes to use YAML). So that will not encourage applications to move from the deprecated style to YAML.\nI could also move it into mlt_properties_load() and mlt_properties_save(). Or create new \"yaml\" version of those functions. Just thinking out loud here. I don't feel strongly about it.. > Waiting a little to merge while I continue to think about your proposals.\nThat is fine. No rush. We could also bake this code in Shotcut for a while and then migrate it into MLT some day in the future (if we remember to do that).. > I found during testing that it breaks the new Size and Position presets with keyframes.\nGood find! I will probably have time to look at this next week (unless you beat me to it).. > I found during testing that it breaks the new Size and Position presets with keyframes.\nThe problem is caused by keys that have a colon in them (like \"shotcut:animIn\"). See my proposed solution here:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt/pull/343\nI also considered quoting the key string, but that would involve more complex changes.. > One major drawback to using avfilter is that it does not support keyframes, and I am not certain that it can be added (supported by libavilter, in general).\nI think that keyframes could be supported by the avfilter filter by destroying the filter and recreating it between each frame. That is not ideal, but I don't think the performance impact would be very noticeable. Of course, this would not work for a specific filter if it relied on previous cached frame data - none come to mind that have that requirement.. >>I think that keyframes could be supported by the avfilter filter by destroying the filter and recreating it\n\nI am pessimistic about that approach.\n\nThat's a fair comment. In order to animate properties, the entire filter graph would have to be recreated every time a property value changes - which could be every frame in the worst case. I emulated this by setting \"pdata->reset = 1;\" in filter_get_image(). When I tested this, the filtergraph was recreated with every video frame. The performance was actually OK on my machine. But the problem is that the filter graph creation is noisy on the console and there were a lot of messages spamming the log. So, I think we could make it work, but it might be clunky.\nFor the simple use case of color correction, I don't think keyframes would be important for this filter. But if the filter had keyframes, some users might find a way to use it to add artistic effects. So I guess there could be some value there.. Is this log the output immediately after a crash? Or did you re-open Shotcut and then capture the log? The log will be most useful if it is captured immediately after Shotcut crashes - but before you re-open it.. > It looks like Player::onShowFrame is some remnant of the remove melted/mvcp code.\nIn retrospect, I wish that I had made that change in a separate commit. . \n. > I initially chose 4x4, and that is what I see on screen; however, the menu showed 2x2 checked. Toggle it off and back on again, it displays as 2x2.\nGood catch. I fixed it here: https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/pull/635/commits/54166c4b06fdceef2ce2f351e120c7870e3eb935\nI also added a \"default\" so that you can toggle the grid on and off with the button without the need to select a specific grid each time. I do NOT save the grid size in the settings. But persisting the grid size across button clicks should be good enough.\n\nAs for color, I think a white and black line along-side each might work good (white with black shadow?). The gray is fairly difficult to see. (I can hear users now complaining that there are faint lines on their video that they cannot get rid of! ;-) Perhaps another option is to add a sub-menu with a color choice of a few primaries in addition to black, white, gray.\n\nI had thought about that, too. I had considered to add a toggle between white and black. But I was hoping to keep the UI minimal. I really like your \"shadow line\" idea. It worked well on all content that I tested. So I submitted that here: https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/pull/635/commits/b8469329e9f91174aa3184d255c51f1aa6800952\n\nI wonder if we should include the outside border of the grid or not. I was not expecting to see it.\n\nI do not feel strongly about the border. It only occurred to me to add it after you mentioned snapping. I thought that if we snap to the grid, people would expect us to snap to the edges like in layout programs (MS visio, Adobe Illustrator, etc). I excluded it from the above commit. I'd be happy to add it if you prefer it.\nThanks for the great feedback. Let me know if you want any other changes or if you want me to squash these commits.. Thanks for the comments. I don't have an emotional attachment to this review. Are you interested in taking over it? Otherwise, I am willing to implement your suggestions and submit changes.. Great!\nI'll be happy to stay out of your way. Let me know if you want help with anything :). > Should the new \"Snap to Grid\" option also snap to safe area guides? I ask because technically they are not a grid.\nI would say \"yes\". From a broadcast perspective, the safe areas would be used for logo placement - and snapping to them would be useful. Maybe \"Snap to Grid\" could just be \"Snap\"? or \"Snap to lines\"?\n\nAlso, when thinking about that, consider that when positioning (not resizing), the rectangle edges do not snap - only the center does.\n\nTrue. I think that would be useful, but less important because it is not hard to grab the outside of the rectangle to snap the edges to the grid. I would use the outside of the rectangle to position the outside and I would use the center positioner to \"center\" the rectangle. I played with that and thought it was fine.. > That suggests like the filter is rather complex and might be difficult to port. If we move forward with this, we should constrain the rectangle to something like 20% of profile resolution.\nI agree. I looked at the code and I don't think it will be a clean port. I think I would rather start from scratch. It might take me a week or two to come up with something. But we will probably end up abandoning this review.. Closing in favor of this implementation https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/pull/650. I see what you did there. I think there could still be a microscopic probability of a race condition if the thread context changes after the function returns but before the pointer is dereferenced. I will try it tomorrow and report back.\nIf we still need more protection, I think we could put a lock around everything except for drawPath since that is where all the heavy lifting takes place.\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/modules/qt/filter_qtext.cpp#L225. How did I never know about mlt_frame_unique_properties()? This is the superior solution. There are probably many other services that would benefit from using this technique. In fact, we should almost require it and forbid services from accessing properties directly from their image/audio callbacks.. I will test tomorrow after the nightly build. But I feel confident this will resolve the problem.. > I think I should add a mlt_frame_get_unique_properties().\nI agree. I assume that would return NULL if the properties do not exist.. Confirmed. No more problems.. The only change in the usage of the filter parameters is that we now let the lift parameters go negative. Instead of [0-1], the range is [-1-1]. When using the Movit filter, the negative numbers work down to about -0.2 and then there seems to be some kind of color distortion.\nAny filters applied to existing MLT projects will work perfectly. However, when the user opens an existing project, the UI sliders/controls will not be in the same place that they were when the user set those values.\nAny user who uses the GPU filters would be able to drag the lift control negative and see the color distortion. but an existing project would not experience the distortion because negative values were not previously possible.. > modifying file system instead of embedded metadata\nI agree. It would be interesting to know if there is a normative/defacto method to associate asset times with media. I am aware of embedded timecodes - which are not supported in a standardized way by consumer devices. There is also the creation_date metadata provided by ffmpeg. I have found this to actually be more reliable than the file creation date when it is present. But it is not supported by all formats. I am open to changing the approach - it would be nice to get this right the first time and not regret it in the future.\nMy research was what led me to implement this:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt/commit/53eaa8b3ffe0655f38863c7973a10c0d1db23a5f\nWe could generalize this logic in a mlt_producer function and make it generally available.\nThe functions would be:\n mlt_producer_get_date(): returns the creation date as determined by a cascading detection algorithm\n mlt_producer_set_date(): sets the creation date as specified by adding a property to the producer. This property is always the preferred date when mlt_produer_get_date() is called.\n\nnot performed by clicking column heading\n\nI actually implemented clicking column headings. But then I changed my approach. There were two problems:\n1) I worry that people might think that clicking the column headings only changes the order in the view and not the order in the playlist itself. Clicking a command in a menu feels more \"permanent\".\n2) I did not find a way in QT to only enable sorting on some columns. The \"#\", \"in\" and \"start\" headings do not make sense to sort by.\n\nnot available in image properties dialog\n\nGood idea. I will add this in a future commit. Let me know if you think of any others.. Where did you get your Shotcut Package?\nLet us know if you can recreate the problem using the official package downloaded from here:\nhttps://shotcut.org/download/\nAlso, in your screenshot, you have typed \"te\" into the search text box. So the filter list is only returning results that contain \"te\" in the name of the filter. Clear the filter search box and you will see more results.. > Shotcut would display a warning message about the plugins that it couldn't load and the cause for that. It's not some-kind-of-tricky-hacking, it's just informing the user about the thing that already happened and has known cause. E.g. \"The following filters couldn't be loaded because you MLT installation lacks required features:\" then list of the Shotcut filters and corresponding MLT filters that they rely on. Or \"The following filters is incompatible with GPU rendering and were disabled:\" and so on. It's very simple thing, but it would save so much time for the people.\nThose ideas are not bad. But no one here volunteers to implement them. Patch welcome :)\n\nBe a little graceful to the user, it won't kill any kittens.\n\nWe are graceful to the user by supplying a fully supported package that works on most platforms. We provide monthly releases with the latest features. People who use the provided package generally have a good experience.\n\nShotcut expects melt binary to be named as \"qmelt\"\n\nHave you inspected the official build script?\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/blob/master/scripts/build-shotcut.sh\nSearch for qmelt and you will quickly understand.. I did some testing. I do not think the image size is the problem. I think the problem is that the image is 100% transparent. I can recreate the same problem by putting text on a transparent color clip. \n1) New shotcut project with mode set to 1080\n2) Open color clip (set color to transparent)\n3) Add text filter\n4) Observe text pixelation\n5) In the properties panel, change the text color to black\n6) Observe the text is not pixelated\nCan someone else confirm my test?\nFor another work-around, try using the same size image that is black instead of transparent.. Another workaround is to give the text a background color that is non-transparent.\nYet another workaround is to set the text outline thickness to > 0.. Some more information/explanation:\nThe \"outline\" in Shotcut maps to the width of the QPen. I learned that a QPen width of zero is a special indication that it is a cosmetic pen:\n\nA line width of zero indicates a cosmetic pen. This means that the pen width is always drawn one pixel wide, independent of the transformation set on the painter.\n\nSo a width of \"0\" isn't actually possible. And a cosmetic pen will not give the user the results they expect. Also, the pen (outline) is used to anti-alias the shape. Here is the issue: if the outline has an alpha of zero and the background has an alpha of zero, then the antialias pixels won't be drawn - which causes the jagged edges.\nAs a result of this, I suggest that we change the outline option to have a minimum of 1. It would still be possible for someone to break the anti-aliasing by setting the outline color to be transparent. But it would only be a problem if the background of the frame is also transparent.. Thinking about this some more... I think that just setting the default thickness to 1 would resolve this.. Did you test setting thickness to 1 with a transparent outline color? Did it work around the problem for you? As I recall, it didn't fix the problem in my test scenario. Maybe I need to try again.\nChanging the outline color to opaque might be an idea. We would want to make sure we don't surprise the user if they click the button and then decide to not change anything.. I had tried that, too, by fiddling with the code here:\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/modules/qt/filter_qtext.cpp#L138\nI was really rooting for that solution, but it didn't smooth the edges in my test case, but maybe it would work for some cases. \nMy theory is that it is antialiasing by trying to blend text color with outline color. But if the colors are the same, the blend ends up being 100% text color and therefore no antialiasing.\n. Qt.ToolTip seems to work. Not sure why I didn't see that one before. I'll make the change.\n. Good catch. I'll make the change.\n. I have no problem changing it to \"mousePos()\" and a property. I'll make that change. \n. Suggestion: Consider renaming \"TAR_APP_PACKAGE\" to \"ARCHIVE\". It is simpler and means the same thing.\n. Suggestion: Consider renaming \"KEEP_BUILD_FILES\" to \"CLEANUP\". It is simpler and means the same thing. You will need to invert the logic, obviously.\n. This seems clunky and oddly specific. How about a variable called \"BUILD_PROJECTS\"? The logic could be:\n- If the value is empty, build all projects.\n- Otherwise, the variable can contain a list of project names to build.\nIn the case of how you are using it now, one would specify:\nBUILD_PROJECTS=\"shotcut melt\"\nThis way, If I need to make changes in frei0r, I could specify:\nBUILD_PROJECTS=\"frei0r\"\nand skip building everything else.\nAlso, I could specify:\nBUILD_PROJECTS=\"shotcut\"\nwhen I am just developing shotcut.\n. I don't feel strongly about the renaming. As the commit stands, it is an improvement.\n. Sure. That would work. But the logic remains: if SUBDIRS is not specified (empty) then figure it out. Else use the projects specified in SUBDIRS.\n. I would like to have this back so that it matches the others above (FREI0R_REVISION, LIBEPOXY_REVISION, X264_REVISION,...)\n. This is messy and difficult to read. Why not just populate the \"XXX_REVISION\" fields above. It would be cleaner and easier to read. I guess it might require some regex magic in your script to update the revisions.\n. In my opinion, all you would need to do to accomplish your goal would be to preload the existing \"XXX_REVISION\" variables. Everything else in this script could stay the same.\n. Consider initializing these variables so that we don't end up with uninitialized variables when the flag is not set. Same for ASAN below.\n. Nit: extra space after (\n. Nit: extra space between ()\n. Apparently this replaces x11grab. But they still use the x11grab device name internally. So it might just work. But since screen grab is currently disabled in Shotcut, maybe it doesn't matter.. Oh, yes. That is true. I think a more comprehensive solution (in the future) would be to extend the Decklink consumer to configure the device for as many channels as necessary to fit the requested channels - and then fill the rest of the channels with silence. This is a method I have used in the past to get around the Decklink limitations.\nYour suggestion is more appropriate in the short-term. I'll look into it.. Fixed .. I am not the author :). I was thinking the same thing. Copyright is important, author is not.. done.. done. done. https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/pull/669. ",

    "johanneswilm": "@ddennedy I understand your argument about not wanting to support other versions. However, this seems to make it kind of impossible ever to get included in any of main linux distributions. Is this only meant until it becomes stable, or is this meant as your policy for all future? If it is the second, then I would think it would be a good idea to start packaging this under another name as soon as possibly so that that other name can become known among all those wanting to install this on their system.\nBtw, where can I find that registered trademark? The one for Firefox I found here: http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4805:9haxp9.2.9 . For Shotcut I found nothing in the trademark database, nor anything about Trademarking on the Shotcut website. If you plan on enforcing a trademark, it would probably be a good idea to write about that on the website.\nAlso: Is there any alternative name you would prefer for a deb package?\n. Yes, but a non-registered trademark doesn't have the same type of protection. Internationally there is no protection at all, and within the US you only have limited enforcement. Otherwise everyone forking any github project would need to change the project name immediately. I don't think you can forbid anyone from packaging the app under the name that it has as long as you don't have a registered copyright. And even if you were to acquire it now, people could make claims of prior art and therefore not be affected.\nBut don't worry, if you don't want others to use the name Shotcut for a packaged version, I am sure everyone will respect that anyway, also without a registered trademark. It's just not comparable to the Mozilla Firefox case.\nAs for your last point: Can you elaborate on this? Is Shotcut not meant to be used in production use? Is it just something meant for internal testing and demoing?  If that is the case, then it would probably also be a good idea to specify that on the site, otherwise people will think it's meant to be an alternative to the existing editors.

I guess it would be easier if there was an unique persistent ID (I get that pointers to producers are not suitable for this) for the clips instead of the clipIndex+trackIndex combination that is so prevalent in the function signatures.\nIt sounds like going down that route will again make your comments here relevant due to current track and current selection being disconnected again. Do you think it's a bad idea?\n. >  I wonder if we should have a switch that allows one to specify that the latest version should be used for all dependencies (or maybe a particular dependency).\nFor this scenario, I then propose having the build server just run update-revs.sh && build-shotcut.sh, and then throwing away the resulting commit (alternatively making the commiting optional, if that's an issue). With a process like this it would be easy to get a build result coupled with a dependency listing showing the SHA's used, and then comparing to see which change made it fail. But to be honest I'd like to ask: is the kind of bugs you have mainly been facing the kind that a nightly build bot will discover? Wouldn't it be more realistic to brace for impact when updating all depencies, rather than never being quite sure if a buggy commit suddenly popped up as a part of that final build-shotcut.sh invocation that results in a final package? \n\nAnother thing that we lose is the ability to specify the branch/version in the config script. It would be nice if you hadn't taken that out.\nIt doesn't sound like something I took out on purpose; what are you referring to? Could you comment on it in the actually commit above? It doesn't sound like something that would conflict too much with this proposal.\n\nI think the biggest advantage is getting complete certainty over what has changed between two releases. I had this thought early on looking at build-shotcut.sh, but what triggered this was this recent G+ post: \nhttps://plus.google.com/115512205788937968595/posts/1We16F8u2hG\nWhere the guy says that 15.04 crashes, but 15.03 works fine. The reply is \"There is very little that changed that could have caused this for you.\", but how can you be sure of that without actually haven gone through all the repositories, compared the git logs side by side to estimate what commits might have made it into 15.04 and what didn't? With a set of SHAs, you could generate a list of all commits that are new in the final package since last release, then walk quickly through them and select some for inclusion in the changelog.\n. > Please double-check this. We must be able to pin certain versions of\n\nprojects.\n\nI'm still not seeing why this is gone at all - in my solution a dependency specification can either have a fixed SHA, in which it will never be touched, or it can be told to resolve a certain refspec each time update-revs.sh is called. This refspec can be anything - be it origin/master or certain release: origin/10.2. The big point is that there will never be uncertainty about what revisions build-shotcut.sh will  build as long as we avoid pointing to moving branches. The revisions will only change when update-revs.sh is called (or manual modifications to build-shotcut.sh).\nLet's take movit as an example: The way it stands now it says\ngit http://git.sesse.net/movit/ b757b4f1ca57c6dcabfe4ad696a2b887544d1a71 FETCHFROM:origin/master 1.1.3\nIt will always build b757b4f1ca57c6dcabfe4ad696a2b887544d1a71, but when update-revs.sh it will update this sha to whatever origin/master is pointing to. If we were to lock it to for example 1.1.2, we could either set FETCHFROM to this branch:\ngit http://git.sesse.net/movit/ b757b4f1ca57c6dcabfe4ad696a2b887544d1a71 FETCHFROM:origin/1.1.2 1.1.3\nAnd when update-revs.sh is called next time, it would update the SHA accordingly:\ngit http://git.sesse.net/movit/ abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd FETCHFROM:origin/1.1.2 1.1.2\nThe alternative is to remove FETCHFROM completely and set it like so:\ngit http://git.sesse.net/movit/ abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd\nLet me know if this addresses your needs.\n. update-revs.sh will now fill COMPONENT_REVISION if COMPONENT_HEAD is set to 1. Otherwise, it will leave it alone. Running update-revs.sh now does mostly the same thing as before, but does more error checking due to the less obvious assumptions it makes about build-shotcut.sh.\n. What do you think of the latest revision?\n. I see. I guess we'll have to make some adjustmens/exceptions for the building-directly-from-origin/master-without-help-from-update-revs.sh case. Something like\nif [ \"$PULL_FROM_MASTER_BRANCH\" = \"1\" -a \"${MODULENAME}_HEAD\" = \"1\" ]; then\n    ${MODULENAME}_REVISION=\"origin/master\"\nfi\nWith the way update-revs.sh works it will never make sense without the whole set of repositories cloned and ready, and I don't see it as too controversial that you're required to have to run build-shotcut.sh once with at least ACTION_GET_ONLY before running update-revs.sh. But if it's a significant issue I'm sure it can also be arranged to optionally work with an explicit prefix, something like REPOSITORY_PREFIX=~/shotcut-dependencies/.\n. > How about this for a proposal:\n\nPut the script back to the way it was\nUse the *_REVISION parameters at the top of build-shotcut.sh to specify a specific revision for each project.\nEach month, after the release, we can manually update the revisions and make a commit.\n\nWhat you're proposing here is what it already does; update-revs.sh is just a convenient way of automating this monthly update. Would you rather go manually through the 12 repositories and copypaste the SHAs into build-shotcut.sh every four weeks?\nThe significant changes in this pull request as of now can be summarized as:\n- All the revision lines are now commited filled in\n- update-revs.sh helps you update these fields, but you're free to do it manually. \n- get_subproject does some checking to see if you're tree is dirty (this could be moved to another commit) or if you're checking out a branch and not a SHA (we can remove this check if you feel it is too strict)\n\nI still like the ability to specify a project to build so that I can use the script more easily for development. So I would like to see that stay.\n\nWhen was it away?\n. I'm a bit surprised at how much I failed to pick up your stance on this, I'll stop working on the revision pinning.\nFor the record, my main reason for wanting this was not just being able to rebuilt a certain revision, it was more about the risk introduced by throughout the month never being guaranteed to be testing the exact same thing, and an otherwise stable shotcut release could potentially be spoiled by an unforeseen buggy commit in (for example) ffmpeg on the day before you build the release.\nAs I'm writing this I have one final suggestion for how we can at least record how a release was built: build-shotcut.sh will include in the package a textfile containing the revisions at the time of building, something like this:\nLIBEPOXY_REVISION=20062c25e7612cab023cdef44d3277ba1bd0b2de\nX264_REVISION=121396c71b4907ca82301d1a529795d98daab5f8\nX265_REVISION=5c5574c5a98f15ddf545479d80296765398f1f09\nLIBVPX_REVISION=5e300cac2ca3c7cc628a05a41e1e270387c5a690\nWhich at least lets us conveniently paste that directly into the local build config if a rare bug that is only frequent in a certain release should need debugging.\n. > The only thing I really wanted was a way to specify which project (if not all of them) should be built - since this would improve my daily workflow.\nIsn't this already in as of ee97c21a144b35cee8ff910435ff3341f2670e19?\n. > One way to save state is by using MLT XML. Obviously, snap-shotting the entire multitrack and restoring it is gross and heavy, but maybe it is the only safe way to handle a complex operation. Otherwise, massive engineering may be required, which is likely to introduce bugs.\nFor the former case in my comment (which I'm still guessing will be more common) the only extension to what we already do today is adjusting the lengths of the blanks on the other tracks. We could say that this is supported, but for the remaining complex cases we simply store the xml.\n\nThis behavior will need to toggled on using an option in the timeline menu like \"Ripple all tracks\"\n\nOf course, but asking out of curiosity: when would you want to intentionally offset one tracks from the other ones? \n\nIt must be accompanied by also supporting ripple delete\n\nOnly because of having \"ripple all tracks\" as a separate option right? Or is there any other reason why it's a must?\n. Newest revision now includes track locking and undohelper as well. These features, although split into separate sequential commits, make sense together, so I'm including them all in this pull request.\n. How about by default rippling all unlocked tracks? For the ripple single track, we could have a solo button to the track head that temporarily locks all other tracks.\n. > Alternatively, the ripple button toggles a more global ripple option that affects a consolidated insert/overwrite, a consolidated remove/lift, drag-n-drop\nI like this option, we get to have a lot less buttons on the toolbar, and the incentive for the user for learning the keyboard modifier is greater. We could even extend it with a double keyboard modifier for the power users (but discoverable since the ripple-all-tracks button would be flashing when pressed). Ctrl: insert, Ctrl+Shift: insert all tracks\n. Awesome!\nNow that you know undohelper, I'd like to hear if you have any thoughts about 'temporary_undo_id'... Is it a hack? Is there a better way to identify clips before and after some operation?\n. Is there an easy way to see if a producer is a track? The attachedfilters model does not know that as far as I can see.\n. The crash happens when the clip is clicked at, and the mousearea that handles (among others) the move action gets only onReleased and not onPressed. I'm only reproducing this about 70% of the time. Trying to figure out what is actually stealing that press-event.\noriginaltrackindex is then 0, which is not correct because the clip is not at track 1 after adding another track. This eventually causes the crash when Mlt::Playlist::get_clip(int) returns 0x0, which gets dereferenced.\n. I didn't notice before now that this particular section was platform-specific. Yes, linux-only should probably be fine for now; the three platforms are built at the same time anyways, so the risk of them not getting built on the exact same revisions is marginal.\nFor non-linux platforms later I'll need some help testing the script on a build server at some point.\n. Closed? Should I post a new pull request for the correct fixes?\n. Is there anything missing for this to get merged?\n. You're sure this only happens when dragging right? (I don't have shotcut available to test atm)\n. Confirmed on my end. BT:\n```\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n0x000000000045a6cd in ?? ()\n(gdb) bt\n0  0x000000000045a6cd in ??

I have not done any significant work yet on the timeline operations yet.\nI'll work on the uses cases etc when I get home.\n. Not unlikely, I'll try and see\n. Confirmed, the #86 fix covered this.\n. This is ripple delete in action, not a bug.\n. How do I introduce shotcut to a user-made filter? Can I make it appear in filter selection, or do I need to edit xml for each clip I want to use this filter? I hope there is a way to do this without requiring the user to start shotcut with a special environment variable. \n. But that's in the install folder right (Shotcut.app/share/shotcut/qml/filters)? Or can I make such a path relative to the mlt project file? It makes sense to bundle the filter together with the project, or at least be able to have something like ~/.share/shotcut/qml/filters/mycustomfilter so I wouldn't have to copy stuff around for every new shotcut release.\n. Out of your suggestions, I think the same-name-but-qml-ending custom filter UI feature is the most promising (at least for my user facing custom html parameterization usecase). The qml file could then be a custom component that is loaded and shown as a part of the webvfx filter UI, which either defines all the fields and labels, or even simply uses a convenience inheritable item that would make the least amount of work needed a file named something like myfilter_ui.qml: \"import QtQuick 2.0; SimpleCustomPropertyUI { properties: [ 'text', 'subtext', 'color' ] }\"\n\nFrom the video, it looks like the user needs to know the names of their custom properties and enter them instead of having the UI present them. We know that with webvfx, JavaScript cannot set a MLT property to be read by this filter UI. One idea is to extend webvfx to support that. Then, you could read the property names to present a better UI or even define a QML property that contains the UI.\n\nYou might remember I tried this a while back by allowing webvfx to set metadata properties through the provided qobject interface. You pointed me towards MLT metadata, but I could never find out how to find a proper pointer to the metadata struct in order to share it between webvfx and shotcut. I'm not even sure that was the correct way to go about it.\nThe overlap you refer to is interesting: as long as the only data resource for the HTML editor/keyframe timeline/filter UI is the html file itself, metadata for it will have to be readable somehow. Maybe it doesn't even have to be through javascript at all, but rather a pragma style html comment with metadata.\n. I just pushed the filtername_ui.qml implementation, see the commit message for details. I'm quite satistifed with the simplicity here - most of the complexity from the former solution was from the add/remove property buttons.\nAs of this commit this is a completely undiscoverable feature, how do you feel about adding a label or a tooltip that (when the user has selected and loaded myownfilter.html) explains how you can also make myownfilter_ui.qml.\n. > I can give you a wiki account to create and edit the page\nSure, I can type something up. The webvfx filter is very powerful, but when it involves coding outside the HTML editor I think a text-based tutorial on the wiki with examples makes sense.

So this is a 32 bit issue then? remember that the website states '64-bit only'. it's up to @ddennedy whether build-shotcut.sh should support it or not.\n. I'm maintaining a ppa that just wraps the monthly here: https://launchpad.net/~haraldhv/+archive/ubuntu/shotcut\nAs for the discussion of 'correct' packaging, it has been done several times already, the most recent that comes to mind being #26. \n. Haven't been able to reproduce in gdb yet due to the race conditions.\n. After looking at the code now for a few moments, yes. looks like it could be about get/putThumbnail getting called from multiple threads simultanously (this is certainly the case after loading this project with lots of clips wanting thumbnails). I'll add some mutexes and test the theory.\n. Well, adding a mutex for get/put thumbnail seems to fix it, but I think we might need more engineering to do this in accordance with the docs:\nhttp://doc.qt.io/qt-5/threads-modules.html says\n\nThreads and the SQL Module\nA connection can only be used from within the thread that created it. Moving connections between threads or creating queries from a different thread is not supported.\n\nMaybe there needs to be a database worker thread that takes care of the database. Feels overly complicated though; to be honest I'm wondering if we even need a database for this? For comparison the xdg thumbnail specification that most linux file browsers like nautlius and dolphin use for storing thumbnails simply says to write into files with hash-filenames in ~/.thumbnails...\n. http://specifications.freedesktop.org/thumbnail-spec/thumbnail-spec-latest.html\n. hmm. yes, i forgot that it's about atime and not mtime. I'm looking at a solution that makes Database a QThread and uses waitconditions in order to keep the exact same api, but use a worker thread internally.\n. I was wrong to think the was only one root cause though, I still have another set of steps to get a similar result, but this time it involves QWidget. I'll post once I know more.\n. I just made it work on the timelinedock here after doing  QCoreApplication::setAttribute(Qt::AA_DontCreateNativeWidgetSiblings); in order to resolve some rendering bugs, and that actually fixed the focus bug. Please do push your branch somewhere, I'd like to see what you tried.\n. Also, here's my wip commit: https://github.com/metellius/shotcut/commit/991ddc4e790fd4ce6d5fad402ad014d7a2c36dc8\n. Making the filtersdock StrongFocus fixed not being able to type in it:\nm_qview.setFocusPolicy(Qt::StrongFocus);\n.

Focus works fine for both filters and timeline now! I'm excited to see the caret blink in just one place at a time :p\nStill some quirks with key propagation (mainwindow isn't getting the key events that it should with timelinedock focused), but I think we're heading in the right direction.\n. Branch tip now includes a fix for the keyevent propagation - evidently qquickwidget has not yet fixed the bug that caused us to make ForwardingQuickViewWorkaround in the first place.\n. My key last keyevent commit was not enough - the mechanism that propagates ignore keyevents to the items ancestors is actually completely broken in 5.5.x due to this: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-48343\nNow that I understand what's going on I can see that it's workaroundable, but it sucks that we have to.\nI got the same deadlock, and it's one I've seen many times before: consumer->stop() at the real_time property check. Is there something I can do to assist in debugging it? I feel a bit lost seeing all the mlt consumer/producer threads in gdb...\n. Understanding more now: the glwidget never got a call to initializeGL for two reasons: one being the sceneGraphInitialized signal being incorrectly connected (this is also printed to stderr), and the other is that the signal is never emitted at all since the glwidget is never shown, in turn because it is incorrectly attempted added with createWindowContainer in player.cpp. With these fixed, it is now crashing in\n[Debug  ]      Mlt::FrameRenderer(0x2a6f700, name = \"FrameRenderer\")\n   [Fatal  ]  ASSERT:    \"QOpenGLFunctions::isInitialized(d_ptr)\" in file /mnt/stor/qt5/qt5/qtbase/include/QtGui/../../src/gui/opengl/qopenglfunctions.h, line 803\n. Much of the trouble here is related to the direct connections done to sceneGraphInitialized and beforeRendering - previously this would be on a different thread, but with qquickwidget this is now called from the GUI thread, causing locking and context switching trouble. I see how the beforeRendering signal is being used for painting gl behind the qml, and I have some suggestions for how this can be simplified later.\n. My branch is updated now - https://github.com/metellius/shotcut/commit/55f674eb3d6f40a6c78917dbab4e6a493a502a3f is a fix for the deadlock.\n. Let me look at the missing event-propagation workaround first before you start testing - that was after all the reason for doing this.\n. Workaround in https://github.com/metellius/shotcut/commit/93d45193322a8c89379714293c3ee6489da53961. Seems to work fine, but obviously needs testing.\n. ...and of course I discover another scenario minutes after posting; I'll have to look more at it tomorrow.\n. Allright, I found a better workaround in https://github.com/metellius/shotcut/commit/0049c09b08f9b739c7c4bc167a09c49714fbf0d0 . Instead of reimplementing the event propagation, I just rerouted the event through QQuickWindow::sendEvent where it is originally done. This is where it will pass through again once QTBUG-48343 is fixed...\n. Yes.\n. I have experienced similar things before when rendering a preview with different aspect ratio thae the project settings. What resolution is the project set to? can you reproduce this if you create a blank project, add single videoclip, add text filter then render immediately with default settings?\n. The google plus community is a better place for this kind of questions: https://plus.google.com/communities/111984976401772983232\n. This is broken for me in master, and fixed by this workaround:\nClick a clip in timeline, then click the middle of the glwidget. Pressing left/right will not move the clip forward/backward.\nThings to test:\n- Click timeline (clip in qquickwidget gets focus), then click up/down (keypress should be ignored, and reach all the way up to mainwindow where it changes active track)\n- Focus timeline, press up/down and check same as above. Then have shotcut lose focus by clicking on another application, then reactivate it by clicking window bar only, and check that up/down still works.\n. I'm also getting this. kubuntu 15.10 here\n. works!\n. Currently working on this.\n.

I have tried reverting that commit, enabling GPU processing and opening one clip then another, but I'm not seeing any lockups.\n. > Yet another solution is to just comment out/remove the call to delete oldTexture and just leak until we can upgrade Qt instead of this heavy change.\nThe choice of which is the lesser evil is yours - I had mixed feelings moving the short and sweet onPaint code from qml to c++, but at least I felt safer knowing that it's public API.\n\nTested on Linux and Windows so far. I had a couple of crashes on Windows when moving clips between tracks that seems to be new.\n\nMaybe this is the one thing that I was unsure about - lifetime and ownership management of the audio levels QVariantList during deletion. If this is the case, two solutions that come to mind are (1) somehow transferring the ownership of the data to QML so that they are cleaned up later, or (2) using shared pointers.\n. > We could maybe debate the abstraction/naming. For example, should \"painteditems.h/cpp\" be renamed to \"TimelineItems\" or something more specific. Otherwise, the file could become a black hole for all future painteditems.\nI was hoping we wouldn't have future paintedItems at all really, QQuickPaintedItem is often slower than implementing custom QQuickItems with scene graph nodes (i'm curious whether rendering the waveform graph is an exception or not here).\nBut otherwise, yes, something like TimelineItems would make sense. The names of the actual classes and their qml registered names is also very much debatable. \n. I would start commenting out stuff to see what is causing it. some things to try:\n- have AudioLevels return an empty QVariant. That way the levels data never passes through qml\n- return immediately in the paint methods of the painted items\n- remove the painteditems from the qml entirely\n. > My advice would be to make the file name and class names more specific.\nOK, I will follow this advice. Here's a suggestion:\n- painteditems is renamed to timelineitems\n- classes are renamed to TimelineTransition, TimelinePlayhead, TimelineMuteTriangle and TimelineWaveform.\n- The items will be used from QML by the same names.\nI'll make this change unless I hear something else from you within a day.\n. pushed\n. I was able to reproduce the diff between mlt's on linux as well\n. Likely qt version incompatibility, you need to supply more context. Also, you'll likely need much more than just 'qmake-qt5' for it to compile correctly with all dependencies. Compiling outside build-shotcut.sh is not officially supported.\n. Shotcut requires minimum 5.5.0\n. That's because you're compiling with c++11 (and also a version of qt not supported), which is not currently in use in shotcut. Indeed, in this case it does not make sense that onNewFrame is final when it is not virtual, but I'm also betting that there will be more compile errors like this one with c++11 turned on. I'm guessing c++11 has not been enabled yet for compiler compatability reasons, but @ddennedy will have to confirm that.\n. Lack of official distro packaging resurfaces now and then, see #26 for a recent discussion.\n. Closely related to #166 (but unrelated codewise as far as I can tell). I'm also seeing this on linux. My temporary workaround is to set LC_ALL=en_US.utf-8 (it is normally nb_NO.UTF-8)\n. Why all the -d arguments? For me gdb has always automatically found the source without any extra arguments, but maybe it is because I'm using a local debug-compiled qt toolchain?\nInitially I just modified the script and added something like $PRE in there, so that when I needed to debug I just did\nPRE=\"gdb --args\" ./shotcut /path/of/test.mlt\nBut recently I'm instead just using source-me in a subshell:\n( cd ~/shotcut/Shotcut/Shotcut.app; source source-me; bin/shotcut /path/of/test.mlt )\nBut are you suggesting it always run shotcut in gdb with that flag turned on? It takes ages to start shotcut in gdb for me (lots of debug symbols from qtwebkit etc to load), so I personally would rarely want to always have it run in gdb...\n. Yeah, I'll leave it for another patch. Thanks for reviewing.\n. In the gif you seem to drag the image, then alt+tab while dragging and then dropping. I'm curious: if you make shotcut smaller so that you can see the desktop and then make the drag without hitting any keyboard shortcuts, does it still happen?\n. I was able to reproduce it on Linux. An significant detail here is that after dropping the clip on the timeline, you don't click on the clip, so what you're modifying does not seem to be the actual clip in the timeline. I'm a bit unsure what you're modifying really, because when I again deselect the clip by pressing Ctrl-D, the set filter is back... My initial thought was that it's adding trackhead filters, but when I click the trackhead the filter list shows nothing.\n. Sounds like you accidentally enabled \"ripple all tracks\" which is that toggles this behavior. It is not a recent feature.\n. There is no UI for this at the moment. I have found that always having an extra video track on top with audio muted covers most cases.\n. +1!\n. As a workaround you can probably modify the duration of the picture source directly in the XML. \n. Open the MLT file in a text editor, find the producer tag that has a matching resource property that is your filename, then modify the length property. Then open it again in shotcut and you should be able to stretch it further.\nRemember to backup the file in case you mess it up.\n. balise?\nI suggest just experimenting and see if you get the expected result.\n. Building outside build-shotcut.sh is not officially supported\n. Most of the complexity would be with the data function sometimes following columns and sometimes only roles, and emitting model change signals correctly when the table changes. But it is doable.\nEither way I didn't think about a tile view, and in this case there is no way around having multiple columns (by this I initially thought you meant an file manager sort of icon view, but as far as I know there's no standard component for this in Qt, so we're better off using the tableview). It sounds like a useful view mode, so I'll take the task.\n. Aha, didn't know about IconMode. Great, then we have all we need.\n. The icon mode is showing to be quite the hassle when it comes to playlist reordering. The problem starts with QListView insisting on handling drag'n'drop by moving the icons internally, and the only (as far as I can see) API you get to respond to this interaction is the indexesMoved signal, which just gives you a list of QModelIndexes and nothing more. Trying to figure out what new row in the model one of these modelindexes belong to seems impossible.\nI was able to work around this somewhat by subclassing QListView and going straight to QAbstractItemVIew::dropEvent for the icons mode, but this is a hack that only got me a little further: dropping between icons just appends them at the end (the normal listview doesn't have any concept of spacing). The drop indicator only shows up on the top and bottom of icons depending on y-position, and x-position is ignored.\nAll in all icons mode in qlistview is lacking when it comes to DND, and I suggest we just do setMovement(QListView::Static) and maybe instead add a sort action and/or have the option of dropped items just be inserted alphabetically. Horizontally flowing icons is a somewhat awkward representation of an ordered playlist after all.\n. Rather than the amount of work I put into it, I'm more focused on the usefulness of the feature. After trying it out I feel it's compact and nice when I have lots of clips in the bin to choose from, even if it's missing reordering.\nHere's what it looks like with large thumbs:\n\nMode menu\n\nIt's not good with a situation where we have to tell the users to switch view mode whenever they want to reorder clips, but it could be marked as experimental and then be improved later by subclassing QAbstractItemView and doing the icons mode ourselves.\nI'm going to push the incomplete branch to this PR as it stands with a disclaimer that there are unrelated changes, debug prints and glitchy signal emissions that should overlooked.\n. Did some experiments with a custom view like I mentioned, and was pleasantly surprised to see how much QAbstractItemView takes care of things for you while you mostly only have to focus on painting and layout. Here's a screenshot of what it looks like so far:\n\nDrag'n'drop from the view to the mainwindow just works without much effort, and for DND into the view it just appends it to the end of the playlist. I suppose there's some more virtual functions that needs implementation for it to insert into the playlist. I'm also quite pleased with how much control of the look and interaction I get by rolling my own view, as opposed to reverse-engineering and fighting with the stock QListView.\n. Thanks for the review. There's still glitches and artifacts all around because I haven't done a lot of bugfixing yet. The horizontal scrollbar is because I haven't done the itemdelegate sizehint function properly yet. Going back to the commit I pushed, I can confirm that the DND reordering was indeed broken, but it has been fixed in my current HEAD. I'm not going to spend time figuring out exactly why since it's in a such early state.\nOnce I smooth out a few more issues I will now push my current branch HEAD which includes the custom icon view.\n. Pushed a new revision now. The icon view is shaping up nicely, and I actually see myself using that more than the tiled view. The biggest missing feature that I'm aware of now is missing save/load of view mode.\nI threw in a sort function today as well. It's available from the menu button, but only when in multitrack mode.\n. > So, the question is: does the user expect the sorted order to affect the sequence of those operations? Probably so, but it will not with a simple model sort. Therefore, sorting must reorder the MLT playlist.\nWhat do you mean by a simple model sort? The sort function in the commit I pushed today resides in PlaylistModel and looks at the resource column in the playlist model, sorts it and calls Mlt::Playlist::move to move items around. Is that not the right way?\n. Think I smoothed out most issues now, and moved the sort functionality to another branch for a later pull request (it needs a bit of rework to work with undo). Let me know if you see those rendering artifacts again (I haven't seen any, a screenshot would be helpful).\n. You're right, I didn't try out the wide/tall thumbs with icons view. I'll do some refinements to the sizing algorithms so they utilize the space optimally.\n. Ok, will do.\n. Reproduced and had a look in gdb; think I see what's happening.\nFor every mousemove event this happens (this is a reversed backtrace for readability):\n```\n161 0x00000000004562e6 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffd7e8) at main.cpp:250\n[,,,]\n\n148 0x00007ffff546b265 in QGuiApplicationPrivate::processWindowSystemEvent (e=0x6080006aeea0) at kernel/qguiapplication.cpp:1581\n[...]\n\n117 0x00007ffff5f8eb5c in QQuickMouseArea::positionChanged (this=0x603001945030, _t1=0x7fffffffb460) at .moc/moc_qquickmousearea_p.cpp:563\n[ lots of qml engine stuff, comes back to cpp in timelinedock ]\n\n69 0x00000000006d0eb1 in TimelineDock::qt_static_metacall (_o=0x6110000e7f80, _c=QMetaObject::InvokeMetaMethod, _id=35, _a=0x7fffffff67c0) at moc_timelinedock.cpp:363\n68 0x000000000062b52f in TimelineDock::trimClipOut (this=0x6110000e7f80, trackIndex=0, clipIndex=0, delta=1, ripple=false) at docks/timelinedock.cpp:740\n67 0x0000000000605083 in MultitrackModel::trimClipOut (this=0x6110000e7fe8, trackIndex=0, clipIndex=0, delta=1, ripple=false) at models/multitrackmodel.cpp:621\n66 0x00000000006cf6ed in MultitrackModel::modified (this=0x6110000e7fe8) at moc_multitrackmodel.cpp:515\n65 0x00007ffff47ea9dc in QMetaObject::activate (sender=0x6110000e7fe8, m=0xa3aa20 , local_signal_index=3, argv=0x0) at kernel/qobject.cpp:3578\n64 0x00007ffff47eb1f2 in QMetaObject::activate (sender=0x6110000e7fe8, signalOffset=26, local_signal_index=3, argv=0x0) at kernel/qobject.cpp:3713\n63 0x00000000006d1cd6 in TimelineDock::qt_static_metacall (_o=0x6110000e7f80, _c=QMetaObject::InvokeMetaMethod, _id=55, _a=0x7fffffff6150) at moc_timelinedock.cpp:384\n62 0x0000000000626fd7 in TimelineDock::clearSelectionIfInvalid (this=0x6110000e7f80) at docks/timelinedock.cpp:372\n61 0x0000000000625c6d in TimelineDock::setSelection (this=0x6110000e7f80, newSelection=..., trackIndex=-1, isMultitrack=false) at docks/timelinedock.cpp:260\n60 0x0000000000629de0 in TimelineDock::emitSelectedFromSelection (this=0x6110000e7f80) at docks/timelinedock.cpp:611\n59 0x00000000006d3ccc in TimelineDock::selected (this=0x6110000e7f80, _t1=0x604000d96c90) at moc_timelinedock.cpp:644\n58 0x00007ffff47ea9dc in QMetaObject::activate (sender=0x6110000e7f80, m=0xa3ac20 , local_signal_index=10, argv=0x7fffffff5cc0) at kernel/qobject.cpp:3578\n57 0x00007ffff47eb1f2 in QMetaObject::activate (sender=0x6110000e7f80, signalOffset=12, local_signal_index=10, argv=0x7fffffff5cc0) at kernel/qobject.cpp:3713\n56 0x00000000006a473d in FilterController::qt_static_metacall (_o=0x60d00003fb20, _c=QMetaObject::InvokeMetaMethod, _id=3, _a=0x7fffffff5cc0) at moc_filtercontroller.cpp:128\n55 0x00000000004bb158 in FilterController::setProducer (this=0x60d00003fb20, producer=0x604000d96c90) at controllers/filtercontroller.cpp:117\n54 0x00000000005b7070 in MetadataModel::setIsClipProducer (this=0x60d00003fb48, isClipProducer=true) at models/metadatamodel.cpp:154\n53 0x00007ffff47449fd in QAbstractItemModel::endResetModel (this=0x60d00003fb48) at itemmodels/qabstractitemmodel.cpp:3140\n52 0x00007ffff488ec6f in QAbstractItemModel::modelReset (this=0x60d00003fb48) at .moc/moc_qabstractitemmodel.cpp:637\n[ model reset leads up to clearing, constructing and redrawing the whole filter view ]\n38 0x00007ffff5eff756 in QQuickItemView::modelUpdated (this=0x603001595ef0, changeSet=..., reset=true) at items/qquickitemview.cpp:1228\n37 0x00007ffff5f0245d in QQuickItemViewPrivate::regenerate (this=0x61d00035b680, orientationChanged=false) at items/qquickitemview.cpp:1800\n36 0x00007ffff5f01fd6 in QQuickItemViewPrivate::refill (this=0x61d00035b680) at items/qquickitemview.cpp:1735\n35 0x00007ffff5f02146 in QQuickItemViewPrivate::refill (this=0x61d00035b680, from=-0, to=155) at items/qquickitemview.cpp:1754\n34 0x00007ffff5e9fe8e in QQuickListViewPrivate::addVisibleItems (this=0x61d00035b680, fillFrom=-0, fillTo=155, bufferFrom=-320, bufferTo=475, doBuffer=false) at items/qquicklistview.cpp:658\n```\nSo for every modification, TimelineDock::clearSelectionIfInvalid is called which calls TimelineDock::setSelection. setSelection previously had an early return for when the selection is the same as before, but this guard was removed in cbc0ddd6.\nThen there's how the selected signal will always call FilterController::setProducer, which calls MetadataModel::setIsClipProducer, which resets the entire metadatamodel, leading to lots of work for the view classes.\nI think the linux platform implementation for mouse event handling stacks up the mouse events while the windows/os X don't (I've seen similar issues on other qt based projects), explaining why you couldn't see it on non-linux platforms.\n. @ddennedy I tried two fixes here; both fix the problem by breaking the problemsome call chain, but at different places.\nOne is to just keep TimelineDock::clearSelectionIfInvalid from calling setSelection at all when not needed:\n```\ndiff --git a/src/docks/timelinedock.cpp b/src/docks/timelinedock.cpp\nindex 63d1ffc..3990634 100644\n--- a/src/docks/timelinedock.cpp\n+++ b/src/docks/timelinedock.cpp\n@@ -369,6 +369,8 @@ void TimelineDock::clearSelectionIfInvalid()\n     newSelection << index;\n }\n\n\nif (newSelection == selection())\nreturn;\n     setSelection(newSelection);\n     emit selectionChanged();\n }\n```\n\nBut this feels a bit wrong, as it should ideally be up to TimelineDock::setSelection to figure out if changes are needed or not. Like I mentioned earlier, setSelection had a check for this before, and bringing it back, like this:\n```\ndiff --git a/src/docks/timelinedock.cpp b/src/docks/timelinedock.cpp\nindex 63d1ffc..989da44 100644\n--- a/src/docks/timelinedock.cpp\n+++ b/src/docks/timelinedock.cpp\n@@ -255,11 +255,12 @@ void TimelineDock::setSelection(QList newSelection, int trackIndex, bool is\n         m_selection.selectedTrack = trackIndex;\n         m_selection.isMultitrackSelected = isMultitrack;\n         emit selectionChanged();\n+\n+        if (!m_selection.selectedClips.isEmpty())\n+            emitSelectedFromSelection();\n+        else\n+            emit selected(0);\n     }\n-    if (!m_selection.selectedClips.isEmpty())\n-        emitSelectedFromSelection();\n-    else\n-        emit selected(0);\n }\nQList TimelineDock::selection() const\n```\n...also fixes it, but then (if I read the https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/commit/cbc0ddd6943ea074ee127fb9774faa9fc678fae3 history right) it might affect a crash with properties changed on the last clip. I wasn't able to reproduce the crash after my fix, but I don't have exact reproduction steps... How should I proceed?\n. I think what you're seeing is an unrelated issue that was not visible previously due to the slowness.\n. Shotcut is unfortunately not very high-dpi friendly at this time. There are a lot of hardcoded pixel sizes, and moving to a scalable design requires a significant effort.\n. I stand corrected, I had no idea qt did this much for free.\n. It only allows it if the resource property is exactly the same if thats what you mean. Btw, i wondered if the join clips function that I found in mlt_playlist was something I should use for this, but when I tried it just made this weird  clip instead... \n. > What happens with the filters when merging?\nIt does not take filters into account yet. The easiest way out is just to refuse merging if they have filters applied (maybe show an error message), otherwise we'd maybe try comparing filter xml or something like that and I'm unsure how that would work out?\n. Just a couple of comments on the code: Passing pointers to implicitly shared objects like QDir/QString is unidiomatic as they can be passed directly by value without loss of performance (see http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/implicit-sharing.html for a list of implicitly shared classes). Most of the time you will want to pass const-refs into functions (ie. const QString&).\nNULL is just an alias for 0, and then using it for comparisons with class instances like you for example do with AutoSavePath becomes a comparison between an int and QString type, which is likely not what you want (I'm a bit surprised it even works, but I guess it implicitly invokes one of the QString constructors that accept pointers... C++ will at times do a scary amount of implicit conversions without giving you any heads-up)\nIn addition, NULL is mostly used for C, and in C++ you just use the '0' character instead, or nullptr when using C++11.\n. Could this be perhaps also be accomplished through some qt.conf trickery?\n. case Qt::Key_Enter: // Seek to current playlist item\n    case Qt::Key_Return:\n        if (isMultitrackValid()) {\n            if (m_timelineDock->selection().size())\n                m_timelineDock->seekInPoint(m_timelineDock->selection().first());\n        } else if (m_playlistDock->position() >= 0) {\n            if (event->modifiers() == Qt::ShiftModifier)\n                seekPlaylist(m_playlistDock->position());\n            else\n                m_playlistDock->on_actionOpen_triggered();\n        }\n        break;\nWhen you only have a playlist, ENTER will open the item, but when there is a timeline as well, it will instead seek to the start of the clip in the timeline.\nThe new views have not introduced or replaced any key handling, and I also tried with the commit right before and it had the same behavior.\n@bjornfor I can't reproduce a scenario where nothing happens, please provide detailed steps starting with a blank project.\n. Are you aware of the Alt+Up/Alt+Down shortcuts (I see they are missing from that wiki page)? They will increment the playlist index and open it in source view (AKA press enter). I find that Alt+Up/Down/Left/Right and Escape cover most timeline/playlist navigation.\n. It might be related to the cause of the hover-exit glitches I investigated for the qml playlist way back... I'll have a look as soon as I have time.\n. This works fine for me with the newest release. The \"open as clip\" feature was replaced with standard copy (Ctrl-c) some time in May; I recommend you upgrade and see if it still happens.\n. Sorry, was wrong about the feature being removed; I see it's still there in the playlist. Still couldn't reproduce it though, tried both in playlist mode and timeline mode. Could you point exact reproduction steps, starting from a blank project?\n. Ok, again I misunderstood, the O point is correctly set but you were talking about playback. The main developer (@ddennedy) will have to decide if this is the way forward.\n. \"shotcut-debian7-x86_64-150601.tar.bz2\" is the june 2015 release.... Unfortunately you cannot create html filters in this way because there is no connection between the jQuery keyframes and the webvfx renderer timestamp. Here's a page that touches on what javascript functions you need to implement to do this: https://www.shotcut.org/howtos/tumult-hype/. Here's some code from a transition I worked on way back. It uses Rekapi, a js thingy that let's me define keyframes and just plug in the timestamp from shotcut. In order to get the duration of the clip, I had to hard code the fps.\n```\nvar rekapi = new Rekapi(document.getElementById(\"flag\").getContext('2d'));\nrekapi.renderer.width(boxwidth);\nrekapi.renderer.height(boxheight);\nvar actor;\nrekapi.addActor(actor = new Rekapi.Actor({\n    render: function(ctx, state) {\n        ctx.save();\n    ctx.globalAlpha = state.globalAlpha;\n\n    var flagImage = document.getElementById('flagImage');\n    var titleImage = document.getElementById('titleImage');\n\n    ctx.font = \"80px Helvetica\";\n    var tw = ctx.measureText(mainText).width;\n\n    ctx.save();\n\n    var bannerOffset = tw - 1200 + 100 * state.sideOffset;\n\n    ctx.drawImage(titleImage, bannerOffset,0);\n\n    ctx.restore();\n\n    ctx.shadowColor = \"white\";\n    ctx.shadowBlur = 5;\n    ctx.strokeStyle = \"black\";\n    ctx.lineWidth = 3;\n    ctx.fillStyle = \"white\";\n\n    if (!mainText)\n        mainText = \"San Francisco test\";\n\n    ctx.save();\n    ctx.globalAlpha *= state.mainTextAlpha;\n    ctx.translate(1210 - tw - 20 + bannerOffset, 92);\n    ctx.fillText(mainText, 0, 0);\n    ctx.restore();\n\n\n    ctx.restore();\n}\n\n}));\nactor\n    .keyframe(500, { globalAlpha: 0 })\n    .keyframe(800, { globalAlpha: 1 })\n.keyframe(800, { mainTextAlpha: 0 })\n.keyframe(1500, { mainTextAlpha: 1 })\n//.keyframe(200, { mainTextAlpha: 0 })\n//.keyframe(600, { mainTextAlpha: 1 })\n\n.keyframe(500, {\n    sideOffset: 0\n})\n.keyframe(1100, {\n    sideOffset: 1,\n}, {sideOffset: 'easeOutQuad'})\n\n.keyframe(3600, {\n    sideOffset: 1\n})\n.keyframe(4300, {\n    sideOffset: 0,\n}, {sideOffset: 'easeInQuad'})\n\n.keyframe(1300, {\n    mainTextOffset: 1\n})\n.keyframe(1700, {\n    mainTextOffset: 0\n}, {mainTextOffset: 'easeOutQuad'})\n.keyframe(1400, {\n    subTextOffset: 1\n})\n.keyframe(4000, {\n    globalAlpha: 1\n})\n.keyframe(4300, {\n    globalAlpha: 0\n})\n\n;\nvar assumedFps = 50;\nfunction render(t) {\n    var frameCount = webvfx.getNumberParameter(\"out\") - webvfx.getNumberParameter(\"in\");\n    var duration = frameCount / assumedFps;\n    mainText = webvfx.getStringParameter(\"text\");\n    if (!mainText)\n        mainText = \"Main title\"\n    subText = webvfx.getStringParameter(\"subText\");\n    if (!subText)\n        subText = \"Subtext\"\n    rekapi.update(1000 * duration * t);\n}\nfunction init() {\n    webvfx.renderRequested.connect(render);\n    webvfx.imageTypeMap = { \"sourceImage\" : webvfx.SourceImageType };\n    webvfx.readyRender(true);\n}\nif (typeof webvfx !== 'undefined')\n    window.addEventListener(\"load\", init, false);\nelse {\n    document.body.style.backgroundColor = \"#ddd\";\n    rekapi.play()\n}\n```\n. I like this better, but isn't that what SUBDIRS already is? In that case, why not just allow that to be overridden?\n. I, however, do :) I'll do the renaming.\n. Latest version of this branch does this now.\n. One of my hopes was to reduce redundancy by having these lines in one place; I was secretly hoping to some day get rid of the 1 to 14 magic indices spread throughout the script and use for example subfolders as keys instead.\nIf we were to go this way, these magic numbers would have to spread to update-revs.sh in order to fetch the repository uri (in order to find \"git://github.com/mltframework/mlt.gitgit://github.com/mltframework/mlt.git\" I, the script, would have to just know to grep for REPOLOCS[1]).\nBut I'll give it a try and we can have another look afterwards. I do want to find something we can all agree on.\n. Done :)\n. ",

This\n\nmakes the file not shareable with someone who has the other decimal divider\ncauses the file consistency check to report this file as damaged, and the automatic repair will \"fix\" the file and thus break it on the system with a comma as a decimal divider.\n\nhttps://forum.shotcut.org/t/decimal-divider-localization-issue/845\nFor illustrating the scope of the issue, it affects all the people who are in countries that aren't blue on this map:\n\nBy NuclearVacuum - CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=10843055\n. I think there might be a bug in the repair tool then. My file hasLC_NUMERIC=\"de_DE.UTF-8\" before and after the \"repair\", yet commas get changed to points.. Ah, I understand now. Thank you for taking the time for the detailed reply. I am in no way qualified to give you any advice, but it seems to me that the best way to avoid problems would be to have points as the decimal dividers anywhere in the code and the file format. The regional decimal dividers can be converted in the GUI depending on the locale.. I confirm this easy workaround does do the trick. Thanks!. Sorry, my intention for this issue was simply to help making Shotcut better by user feedback. IMHO your simple solution would reduce the versatility of Shotcut's audio capabilities.. @ddennedy The described workaround is not solving the issue. Changing the system locale to have points as decimal dividers is the workaround that does work though. . Same problem with version 17.05 downloaded from the website.. It used to work fine on this machine.. Tried glxgears and it failed too. System reboot fixed it. Shotcut runs again. <3.

    "tin2tin": "The video is set to public, could you try again? \nIt seems to be the width of the character '1' in the default Windows font, which is more narrow than the other characters, so when the counter hits that character the right aligned characters to the left of this character moves (jumps?) to the right for one frame and then back.\n. It is disappearing when I select any other font, but it doesn't return when reselecting the default MS Shell Dlg 2. However the \"jumping\" returns when selecting one of the presets.\n. I don't think it's the font causing it, but the presets, since selecting the default font also makes it go away, until you select a preset again.\n. To ripple insert/delete over several tracks is very useful if you're working with video in a video track and  audio in an audio track in sync. In that case you would want to ripple insert new clips before that clip, so all clips in all tracks (or all selected tracks) are pushed to the right in order to keep the clips in sync. But this would demand the option to operate in multiple, but selected tracks only for all editing operations, which might be a huge undertaking? \nAn alternative route is to work with linked or grouped clips with an option under the settings to add new clips to seperate tracks eg. video into a video track and audio into an audio track and possibly empty space/blank clips in the rest of the tracks, and then have the clips grouped by that setting. That way videoclips would never loose sync with audio clips. Shooting audio separate from the video is a very common pratice with ex. DSLR cameras thanks to the poor quality of the audio recording on those cameras. \nHere's a description of the grouping/linking/locking function of kdenlive: https://userbase.kde.org/Kdenlive/Manual/Timeline/Grouping \n. The reason I came across this bug, was that I wanted to add texts throughout a longer clip. So first I added the text filter and the settings I needed and the added it to the clip. Then I used the split tool to split the clip into parts, so each part could have an individual text (like subtitles), but then I encountered the above mentioned bug.\n. That was quick, thank you!\n. Yes, it seems to be solved.\n. It's a h.264, 24 fps clip in a mp4 container. It's the same thing if set as Automatic or 24 fps. Actually I need to step 3 frames to the right(from last visible frame of the previous clip in the player), to get the first clip on the left side and the second clip on the right side after a split cut.\n. Way, way back I did an icon for this function. If you want to add a button, maybe it could be used as a placeholder(until someone with talents for making icons comes along). It's called \"splice\": tin2tin_icons8 (1).zip\n. Ah, it's by design. I think most people would expect all file in/out operations to be accessible from the File Menu, especially now with the new Frame and EDL export options, you get the feeling that you also should be able to export video from this menu.  \nPersonally that was where I looked for it(I had the toolbar disabled), when that user kept asking about it. \nOn the functionality I think File > Export should do the same as View > Export. It will be more confusing with a dumbed down function there.\nAnyway, I fine with just keeping it as is now. I simply thought that it has disappeared by accident while implementing the frame/edl export and just wanted to remind you if that was the case. \n. I noticed, when working in Avid today, that they use Input/output as first level in the Menu and them stream, file etc. as sub menus. This way you make the main file menu more simple if you like.\n. [I think I found an explanation on how MediaInfo determines if a file is VFR or not: https://sourceforge.net/p/mediainfo/discussion/297610/thread/b2a2708d/ ]. No worries. :-)\n[I hope you check into the SC forum to have a look at the EDL export bug. An uploaded mlt file is needed for reproduction of the bug]. No worries. I was hoping it was a low hanging fruit. Thanks for all the fixes.. ",

Actually, it's just like the transition sequence started sooner than the end of its previous sequence (and the same thing at the end of the transition sequence)\nI also tried different output settings to check the issue: h264, mpeg4 (main, high and lossless profiles) and even prores.

    "letkan": "Here is something related to cross-dissolve which looks to me like a bug: click and drag the green handle to the left to create a cross-dissolve, then drag it to the right until it (the visual cross-dissolve) disappears in order to cancel the transition (at least that what I expect). Next if you drag it again to the right instead of the cross-dissolve the left side clip starts to extend.\nIf you do the same as above but click and drag left and then click and drag right the cross-dissolve minimizes but it doesn't disappear.\n.

I've tried creating a \"\u00e9\u00e9\" folder right into my /home, copying Shotcut in it, and the filters don't show. Just renaming \"\u00e9\u00e9\" to \"ee\" makes shotcut work normaly again. My locale is fr_FR.UTF-8, so we're both in UTF8.\nI've tried the windows version installed into an self created (non alias) accented folder (Win7) and the filters do show up, no problem.\nIt's probably unrelated, but I tried to render a video which source resources where into paths containing accents and spaces, and it failed with a short \"INVALID\" video (looking on the web showed me it was related to resource path, so i changed all the paths to simpler, non accented, no spaces, absolute paths in the mlt file and it worked all right).\nWorking on bug-fixing is not fun, and if you cannot reproduce it, very frustrating so I suggest I'll try to investigate further to try narrowing down the problem and will post my findings here in the next few weeks.\nRegards,\nEd\n.

But this does not affect the clips after this clip.\nI cut by using the split tool, then deleting the part I splitted out then I move the clip to the start on the timeline.\n. Thanks :+1: \n. Yet again, :+1: \n. ",

    "DanielKrawisz": "Hey, sorry I should have given more information like that to begin with. I had just downloaded the latest version available that I could find, which was 15.05.06 and I was using it on Ubuntu 14.04. \n. The file was an mkv file recorded in GTK UVC video viewer and I viewed the encoded file later in Videos, which is a program that comes with linux. I also uploaded it to youtube because I wasn't paying close enough attention, so you can see it here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEn29v1ScGY I've tried to re-do the editing, but every time I try to load the project and move the video over to make room for the title screen, the audio goes way off by about 5 seconds. \n. Well I tried to reproduce the problem with a short video that I recorded just now, but I wasn't able to. Maybe the problem has to do with working with giant files? The file I originally recorded to produce the youtube link up there was around 1.2 gb long and almost half an hour of video. Is it ok if I upload something that big? \n. The long videos usually stay in sync when I click around in the middle of the file, but not always. Sometimes they do start playing out of sync, but it is back in synch if I click somewhere else in the video. Thanks for the tip. I'll try what you suggest with the wav sound output. I'll try to find the output you mentioned and upload it. \n. Hey, I have an update on this problem. I tried doing what you suggested and I exported the audio separately and I muted the audio in the video track. I experienced a very similar problem than before, only now I can see what's happening a lot more clearly. I added a title screen (png image), and then I moved the video track right next to it and the video track snapped in place. However, when I moved the separate audio track, it snapped into place at the wrong time. It was about 1/3 of a second too early or so. This amounts to the same problem I had before. \nCan you tell me more about exporting the output of 'mediainfo your.mkv' or 'ffprobe your.mkv' or 'melt your.mkv -consumer xml' ? When and where would I find these files? \n. ",

Or may be fixed but obviously incompletely. Now if I drag the right edge of a clip it's being dragged reasonably quickly but always quickly gets out of sync with the real cursor position.

I just tested a few more times, including clearing registry and AppData again. It works if I drag the image into shotcut and then drag the video into shotcut without any timeline interaction first.\nHere's a video of the crashing. https://youtu.be/3iIy_09i_VI\nSome more tests:\nIf GPU is enabled, the crash doesn't happen.

    "alvinhochun": "Well, I guess I might be doing that too. If the latest display driver doesn't fix it, I'd better just try git HEAD, right? Guess I would be downloading the latest Qt later ~~and freaking run out of disk space~~...\nIs there a release with debugging symbols though?\n. And well... looks like I found the cause... it is the locale, duh... It's even hinted on the stack trace, that iconv_close is related to the crash.\nHaving the locale (formatting, not display language or non-unicode program codepage) set to zh-HK (or also zh-MO, but I am not in Macau) makes Shotcut crash, but zh-TW doesn't. Which is weird since all three usually use Big-5 (codepage 950). (Well... arguably Big5-HKSCS is also a possibility, but Windows doesn't use it by default I believe.)\nI have never used iconv though, so it probably will take me some time to look into this. Perhaps I should find where iconv is used. The stack trace points to libmlt, so I guess I should start there?\n. Ok, I think I found the code.\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/win32/win32.c#L74\nwhich is called by\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/win32/win32.c#L95\nIt seems that it is calling iconv_open with A.R..950 (those are actual dots with char code 2e) as the first argument (encoding).\nA.R. seems to be a substring of Hong Kong S.A.R, which makes a lot of sense, since in mlt_properties_from_utf8 it attempts to take the substring after the first dot.\nHere's what I think... if you want to get the system ANSI codepage (non-unicode program codepage), you should better just use GetACP. Also, the user locale does not necessarily match the ANSI codepage since it can be configured differently.\nI guess there might also be some bugs in libiconv too which made it failed to reject the erroneous encoding.\n. Actually, when I think about it more carefully, using setlocale to get the codepage could be correct in some cases. It seems that the setlocale locale affects C library string functions while GetACP gets the codepage which affects Windows API calls. Depending on the usage, one might be better than the other. Also, user locale, default user locale and system locale in Windows are really confusing.\nCan you tell what mlt_properties_from_utf8 is used for? Is it for data in a file with ANSI encoding or something else?\nThough I guess you can go on with the GetACP build and I will test it after work.\nEdit: _getmbcp also seems to be a possibility.\n. According to MSDN docs for fopen\n\nBy default, a narrow filename string is interpreted using the ANSI codepage (CP_ACP). \n\nIn this case, GetACP seems to be the way to go.\n.

Your tips solve the problem but another bugs coming, actually it's hard to debug.\nI build the newest shotcut and mlt plugins with mingw32(i686-4.9.2-posix-dwarf-rt_v4-rev4), and debugged with QT5.5 mingw32 4.9.2, but it's extremely not stable than your release build.\nThe newest one I build is not completely, only 15/24 mlt plugins success because lack of windows version of third party library.\nI also compile the old version shotcut which use QT5.2.x with the mxe compiler and mlt prebuild binary download from shotcut.org successfully.But the newest script build failure because of the new mingw compiler(I follow the tips to build mingw cross compiler).\nI think a good open source project like shotcut must have a good method to compile it fully and easily, then you can debug it, that's the basic requirement.I dont think dev people always cool, if I  solve some bugs, of course I will sumbit it.But the compiling process is too complex for some guys like me.\nIt is better to use QT project.So can you put your full project or other usefull compile method here? \n.

I tried tweaking my encoding settings to be exactly what's in the above ffprobe output, but the audio sync still drifts in Windows.  Now it's off about 15 frames for a 45 min clip.\nMy guess is you're testing with small clips where the loss of sync is not noticeable.  Try going back to the steps in my previous post and checking the sync very closely after 45 min.  The audio for a 45 min clip should be about 15 frame ahead of the video.\nIn any case, let me know what you find.  I really like the features of this editor, but if it can't render long clips without losing sync, I can't use it.\nI've tried the test above on avidmux and sync is dead on, without tweaking the encoding.  But, I hate the lack of JLK support on avidmux\n. A few years back, I reported an issue with audio video sync. It seems like the issue is still there. For some reason, I can't get audio and video to stay in sync when exporting. I suspect it has something to do with the source video and the export video being too different for the calculations to appropriately sync the audio and video. My workflow starts with an ATEM which captures at 720P 59.94 FPS. Recently, I needed to create a DVD from a 90-minute Sunday service, at the church. When I try to export, to what I think should be the appropriate format for a DVD, selecting the DVD template from the export options, I consistently get audio that is about 15 frames out of sync with the video. I've tried a number of different export settings, and I think I can get it a little bit better, but it feels like there's something not right. In the past, I've used Avid and never had issues like this. It's frustrating because when you're spending hours editing a show, and you export you expect the synk to be dead on.. Yes, I believe the issue I'm experiencing is the same.\nThe work around I tried, which worked, was to change the project setting\nfrom \"Auto\" to match the resolution and frame rate of the lion's share of\nthe material.  In my case, most of the material was fromn a Sunday church\nservice, recorded in 720p, 59.94, with intos and outros added that were\nsaved as mp4 @29.97.   After I changed the project settings to 720p@59.94,\nI was able to export MP4 in sync.\nThe next test is to try exporting in other formats and frame rates to see\nif I maintain sync.  I'm trying to get the material to VOB, so I can burn\nit to DVD.\nHope that helps\nMike\nOn Thu, Oct 26, 2017 at 9:43 PM, Jens Schauder notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nIs this the same issue described here: https://forum.shotcut.org/t/\naudio-aligns-with-video-in-shotcut-but-goes-out-of-sync-after-export/535\nI think I hit that and the workaround of converting everything before\nimporting it to shotcut means a huge amount of work I have to redo :-(\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/issues/459#issuecomment-339898082,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AP7t8gQp5p2dyOn3zYvEvPXf8Yj_GWWDks5swYm5gaJpZM4QCyRm\n.\n.

Before the next transition can be created you must delete the gap (another bug??)\n- Insert a composite track for titles, do some titling (png's from Gimp)\n- done\n.

    "drocks13": "What sort of information can I provide to help you reproduce it?\n. Ah ok. So it has now crashed in several different ways- when removing a track, when clicking on a track, when moving a video over another video to create a transition, when moving a video to an audio channel. At this point it has crashed in so many different ways that I can't tell what actions cause it to crash other than all of them. \nThe setup is as follows I have two video file (.flv) to create two tracks. On one video I have  used the crop filter to cut out the black spaces and then use the position filter (on that same video) to move it so it have a picture and picture effect with the other track (the other track has no filters on it). I have .png images as intros and outros. That is about it. As per the FAQ I have tried setting it to DirectX and OpenGL. Both seem to cause it to crash randomly. It is a windows 10 pc with i7 and a Geforce GTX 960m GPU. Let me know if you need more detailed information. Project file is attached - by project file I assumed you mean the .mlt file.\nproject file.zip\n. I have managed to replicate this same crash issue with kdenlive. So possible the issue might be with MLT or the frei0r plugins that are causing it to crash. So issues maynot be with Shotcut but the under lying frameworks.\n. I have mannaged to track down the issue, I think- it crashes because of a runtime error. I was using .flv video and there is some error with runtime sending the wrong information that causes the program to crash. Sorry, I can't be more detailed than that. I only found it using while OpenShot, which uses the MLT framework (testing different programs that use MLT to see if I could find the issue with that), when the same sort of crash happened but its error reporting gave me a generic error about runtime. Converting my flash video to a diffierent format seems to have solved the problem in Shotcut so I suspect it is a runtime error with the use of flv. video. \n. Uploaded- it was created with Open Broadcast Systems. Its not too much of an issues as I can just rewarp the file into .mp4 but thought others might have an issue.\n. ",

Sorry, forgot to write down the results of my research (real life interfering).\nFirst I'll tell you my workflow.\n-first I add a ton of videos from a folder to the sources list.\n-then I add all of them to the timeline.\n- then I select them one after another (in the timeline) to add the necessary filters.\nThis is what happens:\nIf you want to add a filter to a clip in the timeline, you need to single click the clip. Doubleclicking the clip silently switches the focus to the clip in source list (which is not at all obvious from the gui).\nHowever, single-clicking a clip in the timeline does not show the clip in the player, because it does not change the time-position so as the user you are encouraged to double-click the clip (in the timeline) to be able to see the clip, thus switching the focus to the source list.\nProposed fixes (one of these would suffice to fix the confusion):\n- When single clicking a clip in the timeline, jump the play position to that time , thus showing the clicked location in the player.\n- When doubleclicking a clip, do select it in the source list (so you can find it) but do not change the focus from the timeline to the source list, so that if you then add a filter it is added to the timeline (which is where you clicked, so that's what you'd expect).\n  -Remember filters added to the source list and apply them before any filters added in the timeline.\nIf these are both impossible or very hard, at least make it more obvious where the focus lies as the current system can be very confusing.\nsuccess with your awesome app.\n. > there is no source  list\n\nOk, maybe I used the wrong name. I mean the list of source videos obviously, Playlist/ sourle list whatever.\n\nBut I can understand attaching filters to that list would be a problem programmatically if you did not design it with that in mind.\n\nFocus on the timeline is extremely obvious - the clip's shading is inverted AND there is a red outline. How is that not obvious?\nIf I doubleclick an item in the timeline. It still looks like it has focus (red outline, inverted shading). But any filters added are lost, because it's not actually the clip in the timeline which has focus anymore.\n\nNow that I look at it, it's not really the Playlist that has focus either. I'm a bit confused as to the usecase of opening a copy in the player. Why would you want that? (I don't mean this as a rethorical question I really don't understand.)\nWhat it looks like to an unsuspecting user is this: single click- select clip, double click -  select clip and seek. \n\nDouble-click - like most things in desktop - is a shortcut for Open.\nIn any other video editor I used doubleclicking on a timeline clip opened the properties of that clip in the timeline. \n\nI really like the workflow 'dump all clips in timeline, then drag them and add filters'. Shotcut is the only app I have found which comfortably allows this workflow. Having an easy way to select a clip in the timeline and open that clip in the player it would be very useful IMHO.\nThe focus on the timeline is maybe quite obvious, but if you doubleclick on a clip, the focus on the \n. Just plainly removing doubleclick would be an \"improvement\" I guess. It would at least clear up the confusion.\nI understand using doubleclick for select+seek(*) seems not logical to you, after all you designed it the way it currently is. And from a code perspective (I'm a programmer myself) it is probably the logical thing to do. But try to once use Shotcut as if you did not know how it worked internally. I think you'd expect that to happen as well.\n(*) In most other apps it's not actually 'select+seek' but it opens the properties of that specific clip as it is  used in the timeline and also opens it in the player with the in and out point marked and the filters applied.\n.

Origin remains unknown.\n. ",
    "notusedyet": "Thank you for your fast replys.\nI did not see any clipping in the waveforms, although I have to say, that I don't really know, how this looks like. But what I have noticed is, that if I play the movie from Shotcut's playlist, the audio will be correct - no crackling. If I play the clip from the timeline though, it does crackle! The waveforms looked similar to me in both cases.\nI have tried the different filters and none of them seemed to solve the crackling.\nI have just uploaded two videos, one was transcoded with Shotcut and the audio is crackling and the other one was transcoded with Handbrake with an AC3 passthrough. You will have to turn the volume up a bit to really here the crackling. \nPS: I judged the videos with VLC before. The files are named shotcut_export_crackles.mp4 and Handbrake_export_fine.m4v. I hope, I am doing right, since I did not find any sharing link to the files.\n. Interesting. Is there anything that I can do about it? Or will I have to wait for a fix?\nYes, I can reproduce it with the Handbrake encoded file. I have uploaded the original file \"00191.MTS\".\n. I really appreciate that you guys spend your time on this. \n(Especially, because my HDD is continuously being flooded with new videos. ;-D)\n. I have recently switched to Ubuntu (Elementary OS respectively) and the problem is still there.\nAs a temporary replacement for Shotcut I tried out Kdenlive which uses the MLT Framework too and that did not have the same issue. So possibly the problem is not the MLT Framework, but something specific to Shotcut.\nAlso, if I only drag one single video file (MTS) into Shotcut's timeline without doing any editing to it and export my \"movie\", I get the annoying crackles as well. Of course the source file is OK again. \nIf I open a blank project in Shotcut and just add a bunch of videos to the playlist but NOT to the timeline and export the playlist, everything is just fine.\nStrangely, I can play Shotcut generated .mlt-project files (timeline used) from the Kdenlive playlist and I get the same problem with Kdenlive. A can also add the whole movie in it's .mlt-form to Kdenlive's timeline and export it. As you would expect, the crackling audio persists.\n=> Something, somewhere went wrong with this timeline. :-(\n(Since the audio is actually more important than the video in my case, this really hurts me badly. Please, take another look at this.\nUnfortunately I'm not totally satisfied with Kdenlive, so I am still trying to hang on with Shotcut.)\n. Well, I can understand that.\nThank you for the tip to transcode the files. I have not tried it yet. If that works, I'll be happy.\n. Yep, sounds rather the same. But it is even more subtle than the noises I had.\nReferring to my previous post: Transcoding the files to DNxHD, reencoding the videos with x.264 or demuxing the audio, converting it to AAC and remuxing it into the video again did not work.\nI will now work on with Kdenlive, which does work, but hasn't got such advanced export options and making transitions is near to torture.\n. @ddennedy: It is quite weird, yes. But Kdenlive (v0.9.6, Ubuntu 14.04, little old) works, Shotcut does not. I am using transistions for both, video and audio and since that is probably the only \"editing\" I am doing to my videos, I have to rely on that.\nI am glad that this is now brought to life again!\n. ",
    "lnx64": "I have the kind of reverse of this.  When I have quiet classical music playing in the background of a video, the pianos create a sort of low crackling sound, that's not in the original file.  Would this be related to this issue somehow?\n. If you listen carefully around 20 seconds+, the crackling starts.  It's super annoying, and if you aren't listening on headphones, you probably won't hear it, but I'm a sound engineer also, and I hear these things until they annoy the heck out of me.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7whMSJfJ6Q\n(Yes, you do need to crank the volume up loud to hear it)\n. Interesting.  For the record, I am using Windows 10 x64 and Shotcut 16.07.01 currently on this machine.\nI would like to see this fix, because a few clients have complained about crackling issues, which I originally didn't even notice until I went back to listen to them.  It's a deal breaker, because some of the projects I produce, have quieter parts, and I'm huge in the dynamic range area (I want spoken dialog in a movie to sound normal, but explosions to blow you out of the chair).  For this people have to turn up their amp, and yes, they are hearing the crackling issues.\n. notusedyet, I bet this is more audible like yours:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdBpghE-BAE\nEspecially at the end with the slow motion.\nThat crackling just isn't acceptable anymore.\n. @ddennedy Not to worry, I'll do whatever tests you need done.  I am quite comfortable editing XML.  I did as you recommended, and here are the results.\nUsing the disable 1 property, yielded NO crackly parts in the audio, and clears it up perfectly.\nRemoving that child, and changing combine to 0 also has no crackly parts in the audio, but the volume is not as loud.  (It's not as drastic of a volume change, but it's noticeable).\n. I wonder if you two are using two different versions of Kdenlive?  balevas and notusedyet are both using Kdenlive, but have two different results.  Hmm..\n. I'll need to try the first recommendation, with the right edge dragging in the timeline, when I'm back at work (I left my laptop there).  However adjusting the properties when in the source player, was not working for me either, as it seemed to work for you.  When I get to work, I'll get a video of what it's doing, that apparently works for you.  I'm kind of curious what is causing this.  Out of all the free video editors, this one is without a doubt, the absolute best!\n. Apparently this JPG may be the problem causing all my issues.  So far since removing it from the video track 2, the video has continued exporting so far.\n\nSeems like I'll need to convert it to a PNG or something, but a simple JPG shouldn't have stopped up the exporter like this when it viewed fine in the timeline.\nI'll let you know if/when it finishes encoding without this JPG.\n. It completed just fine without this JPG.  Hopefully the developer can have insight as to why a JPG caused problems, when no other problem seems to have an issue with it.\n. Sorry for delay getting back to you, my father had a bad fall and needed to watch after him last night.\nI have tried with the latest, same issue.\nI just tried cutting it down, and it still didn't work..  If it's the image itself on it's own in video track 1, it will not fail.  However, if I make it on video track 2, to overlay on top of a video that is playing on track 1, it does fail, like it won't mix it with another source.  But when I take that JPG and convert it to a PNG, it exports without issue.\n. Here's a zip file with the MLT and a source video and the JPG, that did fail on export, as it's my tested failure.\nhttps://www.mediafire.com/?1d6p5kn11uv0ft1\n. Thank you for looking at it and solving it so fast.  You guys are great!\n. So I think I found out what's causing it.  It's the rotation.  (I always hold landscape, never portrait).  If I have the phones bottom on the right, the videos, no matter what resolution, import just fine into Shotcut.  If the phone is held with it's bottom on the left, the videos fail to import and crash Shotcut.\nI'm not sure why it's causing the crash, but I'm going to assume the meta data is causing it, that otherwise tell the player how to rotate the video.\n. How do you select DirectX as the option when you select an external screen?  Those options vanish when an external monitor is selected.\n. Sadly using DirectX made things worse.  Timeline buttons went grey and are acting very funny.\n\nThat's not even while using the second monitor.\n. That's fine, I'll deal with the frame rate issue, you already said you can't improve it, so there's no need to make another bug report.\n. It's a Radeon 7850, 1GB..\nBesides the GUI artifacts, it was still slowish when any second video track is added with say, translucent PNG's (which I use for overlays).  Like it can go down to 1fps.  I know it's not real time and should drop the frames, but that's excessive in my opinion, because Adobe Premier works blazingly smooth on the same hardware.  But I prefer Shotcuts \"flow\" more, which is why I practically live off of it.\nI may be switching back to Linux soon, so I may not be able to test DirectX much, but I'll hold off for now, and create the other ticket if you'd like me to?\n. Let me try doing that by how you mention.  I usually clip at the playhead and remove the rest.\n. I can confirm it here, there is a little pop in the transition when the video is adjusted by dragging the end point.\n. I just made a video where these pops are visible.  In the slowed down section I split it multiple times at the playhead so the text ^ cursor can move as I haven't figured out how to make text actually move any other way.  Each split has a pop, even though nothing was added or removed from that clip itself.  It just pops.  Those pops are not supposed to be there, and Final Cut doesn't add these pops when I do the same thing (except there I really don't have to break it like that because it CAN move text, but simply snipping at the slowed down clip doesn't cause audible pops period).\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n6Ip2NrKqw&feature=youtu.be\n. A jerk?  Now that was not the intention at all, and I've been more than helpful for you with as much detailed bug reports as possible.  I was stating it doesn't add the pops to show it isn't something with the video file or anything like that, even though I don't have to split clips like that on a different program.\nDon't be unprofessional please.\nAs for vague, it really wasn't.  I put the playhead on a clip, right clicked the clip, and told it to split at playhead.  Doing that causes an audible pop, which it shouldn't.  I verified in another video editor there are no pops doing the same action to verify it wasn't my video file maybe having something wrong with the audio codec.  I added it was a slowed down clip (.50x speed to be precise), in case it mattered.  Technically even though the same clip, though split, it's still technically a transition.  One one part of the clip, to the other part.\nHowever, at this point, your unprofessional rudeness towards me and assuming I was being a jerk, honestly makes me feel indifferent about your outlook on Shotcut and MLT, if that's going to be your attitude.  You would think after the helpfulness I have provided to go the extra mile, to show you something, and to edit an XML for you to prove or disprove if something worked, like the crackling audio bit and external monitor problems, you would think being a jerk is clearly not my intent.  I volunteer my time just as much as you do, to make Shotcut better.  I have praised it in how easy it is to use and for how well it has worked, considering it's free price tag.  Don't sour a customer/developer relationship.\n. Sure thing @ltGuillaume .  Here you go.  And yes, I feel it can be related which was my point.  Totally not trying to be a jerk in any way.  I would think splitting is frame accurate.  Video wise it seems to be fine no jumps or anything like that, but the audio does always have a pop, like the waveforms aren't.\nproject.txt\n. Well, calling someone a jerk is unprofessional, and it is..  If I called a co-worker a jerk in a non playful manner, I'd have been disciplined for unprofessional behavior.  Sorry you see it as comparing to others, the point is, we have put time into it, a little common courtesy is what we'd expect for that time we put into it.  I was the one you called a jerk, so yes I am going to remind you that I have taken time out of my day to report these things, and will take offense to it.\nI worked for Apple, developing OS X 10.7 to 10.9, I was on their team, bug reporting, and developing some of the features of which I can't speak for (NDA), but I do actually understand what goes into it.  That's why I take my time to bug report, and compare to other programs to verify it's not the source video having a messed up audio codec.  In fact, if I reported anything to the iTunes team, they would ask me, if file A is messing up and file B is not, does file A play correctly on other applications like QuickTime directly, or VLC?  If it works on VLC but not QuickTime, problem is QT (since iTunes uses it), and may require the ticket to be forwarded.  Etc..  I know the chain, and how we patiently have to determine where the cause lies, all of that.\nNow with that said, may we please get back on topic and help work out the issue OP has posted?  Popping in audio is no go, and I feel my popping issue is in essence, related.  Splitting a clip at the playhead still counts as a transition as it would appear (from between the now two clips, which used to be one clip), since the pop is identical to what OP stated.  Even at the beginning of my clip, when it cuts to a black screen with text, the transition to the black clip has an audible pop.\n. I made a video showing that a video added to the timeline, as is, plays fine.  But splitting with S or (at the playhead), adds pops.  I do believe this is related to how it's handling a transition between them.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO-xaRKckI\nNot only are the pops identical to those that OP has determined by their method, even those we are making a transition differently, it is a transition still.  The pops heard in the timeline, are present in the exported file as my other YouTube video showed.\n. Do you think that perhaps a 1-2 frame audio fade can be made automatic in the background unless one is manually specified?  It could reduce overhead on the person editing it in my opinion.  (Or perhaps an option in the settings menu, so people can have a choice, until the other bug is fixed.  It looks like it is due to the other bug you mention, what I saw in the waveforms is exactly what's causing those pops).\n. I'm now on Linux, and on Shotcut 16.10.01, this weird playhead jitteryness happens on this platform also.  64-bit.\n. I would like to add a video showing the issue in case I didn't explain it well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEDcNCRygIY\nI tried exporting the \"split after filter\" clip and yes, it does have the filter applied, before the split.\n. Thanks I will use that workaround for the time being.  It'll be easy to add a simple black frame clip to the right and no one will notice, until a proper fix is developed.\n. This issue is happening again on 16.11.02, can we re-open this?  I video taped it happening, and the only fix was to save the MLT and re-open Shotcut again.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zmmj7VAAS4. I honestly don't even know what I did.  Once you get in the zone trying to edit something, you don't always remember what you did..  I will try, but this is the first time I came across this lockup of the time line.\nIs there a debugging mode in shotcut that logs every action that is done, just in case I ever run across it again?\nI mean I have to start over anyway, shotcut just crashed in general on me, window closed, no errors, gotta restart from the point the MLT was last saved, so I guess I'll see if I run across it again.. I imported one giant video clip, moved it to the time line, broke it up into sections by the S key, then realized I forgot an intro and moved all the clips to the right, one by one, starting from the right.  After that, the left most clip lost it's thumbnail and became a darker shade box on the timeline, and from there clips couldn't be dragged in.  Saving the MLT and relaunching worked, but the thumbnail was still missing on the left most clip.  Then shortly after, Shotcut completely crashed without error (the post above).  When I relaunched shotcut it offered to open the auto save, and it did, and my project exported without trouble, AND the left most clip had a thumbnail again.\nGPU acceleration is off btw.\nThat's all I can remember, so something may be missing in the middle.  But something triggered it.\n. I'll keep my eyes peeled and if it happens again, I'll see if I can remember anything further as to what's causing it.. See this is why I switched to Davinci Resolve.\nBasically you have a workaround and would rather close my 2 year old bug without truly fixing the issue. . Yes, doing a Help / Upgrade does cause it to say the correct prompt afterwards.\n. Thanks.  By the way, this bug report I made, might actually be related to this, I'm not sure: https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/issues/333\nIf it is you can close the other one.  After making the second one I started to think it might be part of the same issue as this.\n. Well I was doing the 1 frame fades because you were telling me that's how I can get rid of the pop between clips, so that's why I had to do that.  It was to bandaid the other issue.\n. I'll check it out.  When it's released.  I'm very eager to see how it performs, even if not 100%.\n. I'm sorry I misread it.  I got confused, I have 16.11 installed now so I will be trying it out on a project later tonight.\n. Update from 16.11, I still seem to be exibiting some slight issues with faders, either video or audio.  Sometimes even though they are enabled on a clip, sometimes they just don't actually apply, and the fix so far as been to delete the filter, and re-add it, then it starts working.  It's very odd, but at this time I can't use faders reliably.  Cross fading though via transitions works, but faders regarding multiple tracks isn't working (like fading in another video on top of track 1).  Sometimes it just needs the filter re-added.\n. Here's a few files to hopefully show you what is going on.  I have to MLT's, one is when in the Shotcut GUI, I have both faders for a 3rd video track to fade in and fade out, with text on it.  The GUI shows the fade out correctly, yet it does not apply.  The second MLT marked fixed, is when I simply deleted the fade out for that track, and re-added it in.\nFadeoutfixed.txt\nNofadeoutonlayer.txt\nVideo showing the UI showing me that it should have worked both times, but only worked after re-adding the filter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDx4TUsirq0\nHope this helps, I ran a diff on the MLT's.\n```\nbrandon@BrandonsLaptop:~/Desktop$ diff Fadeoutfixed.txt Nofadeoutonlayer.txt\n190c190\n<     \n\n\n<filter id=\"filter7\" in=\"00:00:02.980\" out=\"00:00:03.951\">\n\n```\n. I think I just figured out what is triggering the fade out to not always work where it's supposed to be, requiring me to re-apply the filter.  These clips are always stretched out, like a graphic.  At first it sometimes applies the filter where it was stretched from originally, not where it was stretched too, and when I re-apply it, it seems to apply to the proper end.\n\nEDIT:  Uh, I honestly have no idea now.  I have a stretched out clip, and I literally can't apply the fade out to where it is stretched out, it's insisting on applying the fade out only to it's original position.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijiqW5x4uYs\nEDIT2:  I think I figured it out.  Simply deleting and re-adding the filter isn't what is fixing it, it is selecting another clip, and re-selecting the clip I want to fix, and THEN re-adding the filters.  It seems that if you stretch out a clip, then apply the fade out for example, it doesn't always work, but if you stretch out a clip, and then select another clip and re-select the clip you just stretched, THEN apply a fade out, it ALWAYS works first try.\nHope this helps!\n. meoso, I have an HD graphics 4600 on my laptop, and this filter works fine.  Ubuntu 16.04.01.\nI'm not sure what it uses for OpenGL though.  My desktop I know but not my laptop.  It might be mesa.\n. This issue is creeping up again, but now in a different way.  On another project, it is fading out to black, BUT well before 1 second as it's set in the MLT file..  This is really odd.  It seems this may be related to my other report about the faders not working at the beginning of a project.\n. Update:  On this project, even the transitions are not fading the audio in and out.  There appears to be a big problem regarding faders.  Attached is the MLT file.\nnofader.txt\nScreencapture of what is going on with this MLT, and a fix I had to apply: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez3b_W_2KOE\nI was to assume fade in and out's were automatic with transitions?  That's what the Youtube video showing transitions says.\n. On 16.12.03, this still isn't working quite as it should, in fact now the transition with an image with no sound, has no sound whatsoever, whereas before it had sound at least.  Before, I could manually add a fade in for sound (or fade out), but now with no sound in the transition itself, the fade ins are ocurring after the video already faded..\nAlso, this has seemed to mess with the audio faders a little, audio seems to fade out and fade in not quite at the right times.  For example, I have a fade out on a clip that fades to an image, but the audio cuts off before the fade out is fully finished, making it sound harsh.. Add video to timeline, nudge to the right a little.  I then add in a simple black backdrop (could be any image), then align the video I nudged to the side of the image on the timeline.  I add some text to the black backdrop.  Then when trying to pull the video aside to make a transition, the transition has NO sound whatsoever.\nVideo to this part:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mra6Ad3_SBc\nThis is the other one, where fading out audio doesn't fade to complete silence, thus is not fading out completely.  As you hear, the audio was still at -35 on the VU meter before cutting out.  This isn't expected results, as it should have faded out completely so no \"cut\" was heard.\nVideo of this part:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVfn70Q_Wuo\nI hope this helps...  The large clip I am using, was actually made by Shotcut, where I simply imported all clips from my camera into one large clip, then exported it so I only had to deal with one large file rather than 9.. If you can identify from these video captures what is causing the transition and fade outs to not work correctly, and if you know of a workaround, please let me know.  I need to have this project exported and finished by tomorrow morning for my client.  I'll be happy to take any workarounds, otherwise if I release it like this, the client won't approve.. Thank you for the workaround, you may have just saved my bacon for this project.  (Actually you did save my bacon!)  While most of the time I usually do foolish YouTube videos, it's these higher projects for clients that put the foods on my table, and I rely on it, which is why I'm usually here so often.\nI was scared for a second you were going to need the video I was using, as it's around 120GB, lol.  Not to mention classified material right now.. I've run into this sometimes when I'm exporting video from an AVCHD camera, but it only does it when the clip changes.  I'll have to also try disabling Parallel Processing and see what it does.  When it happened to me, it only jumped for a split second as soon as the clip changed, but then worked fine throughout the rest of the clip.\nhttps://youtu.be/gJJB4m-EvT4?t=9m39s\nWatch when the clip changed, you can see the frames clearly in the wrong order at the start.  Perhaps the same issue as then?  I don't honestly know what Shotcut version I was using then when I did that video, it was up to date though.\n. Ok.  Honestly didn't know what LADSPA SWH was.  I saw it was optional, but was clueless to the acronym.\nPerhaps for the explanation, add (This is for extra sound filters), so we actually know.  ;)  The explanation, doesn't actually explain anything really.\n. Would using KDE work better perhaps than a GTK based desktop?  Or does this effect all?\n. I can confirm on Linux, the same behavior is observed, though I don't see the error, it just doesn't go into the playlist.. I've had some weird issues with sync, and frame ordering when Parallel Processing is enabled.  Try exporting with Parallel Processing unchecked in the export tab, and see if that helps.. I will ultimately be using the timeline in general to lay down audio tracks from the mayor's microphone directly, but I like to start with adding the video first, then applying filters and white balancing, etc, then I add other stuff to the timeline after I'm happy with the video.  I will try the cornerstone option.\nI have a small feeling this bug however, is related to another bug I filed once, about how sometimes filters don't actually get applied to the selected clips.  (Namely, when you split a clip and see that one half of the split clip is already highlighted, but the effects don't actually get applied to either half sometimes.  (I finally am able to reproduce this if you want me to).. ",
    "balevas": "I experienced the same issues when rendering videos of my kids' piano performances in kdenlive; after some time I noticed an unpleasant crackling distortion after nearly each tone. It almost made me switch from Linux environment to Windows for editing of my home videos as the sound degradation is unacceptable. I am so grateful to you guys for finding out the cause and posting the XML-editing workaround. It works perfectly for me, too. I can't wait until the proper fix is released.\n. @lnx64: this is most likely because we're both using so much different versions. I am on Arch Linux, using the latest released versions: kdenlive 16.08.1-1, mlt 6.2.0-1. In contrast, notusedyet uses 2 years older software.\nYes it is strange that if both Shotcut and kdenlive depend on mlt even in versions used by notusedyet, one app works for him while the other doesn't. Perhaps we could compare the mlt scripts generated for a mutually agreed scenario by my and his versions of kdenlive, to find out the difference.\n. ",

    "chmorgan": "@bmatherly would you know of a tooltip example I could copy from? Would you know if those have access to the descriptions provided in the yaml on the properties that are defined in the mlt filter?\n. @ddennedy thats a really good question. It looked missing and double didn't match up with the mlt property. The variable is defined as an int by mlt. Should it be retrieved via getDouble() even in this case? Would that result in any aliasing for a value that has to be a whole number?\n. @ddennedy, @bmatherly repushed with just the changes to add the smoothing property. If I can't get this in without tooltips I'll add them but was hoping to start small in terms of contributions as the time spent refactoring scales with the size of the changes. I can make the tooltips changes next, was going to look at pulling from the properties documentation in mlt for those so I didn't have to copy the text over, but that is only in english so maybe that isn't a good idea.\n. I'm thinking that frames would be a reasonable units. Were you saying that it would make sense to set the 'suffix' of that property to be 'frames'?\nAn aside, the width of the value field of the slider spinner doesn't appear to resize correctly. For instance in the stabilize filter the zoom field shows x.y% even if the percentage is greater than 10.\n. @ddennedy hmm. Seemed like they looked ok to me but I'm not fixated on using them. Its my first use of qml.\nOk with moving the button up above the label as to separate the analysis section from the filter properties section? If one were to change/alter the source translation string what happens in the case where you'd have orphaned strings in the .ts files?\nAlso, do you normally edit the qml in qtcreator? I tried going to the 'design' view after opening the project and it had errors, reported perfectly good properties like 'title' as being invalid, and told me to fix the qml. Maybe qtcreator can't edit qml unless its in a particular format? Or my version from qt 5.7 is too new?\n. @ddennedy thoughts about multiple cuts from the same source where each is using the stabilize filter? That would seem to necessitate a .stab file for each and a button to click for each.\nI like those improvements. Let me see if I can figure out how to cleanly do that in qml.\n. Yeah. i was wondering how to manage reference counts in the case where we might have the same file used by multiple filters. What if they changed an analyze property etc?\nHad no idea you could open a project as a virtual clip like that. That sounds like something I need for a video I'm working on right now.\nThoughts on selecting a filename for the user? filter hash + filename + .stab in the /tmp folder (or whatever cross platform thing qt provides for that kind of thing)?\n. @ddennedy, @bmatherly  added some logic to control the state of buttons/controls based on the analysis status. Didn't do any hiding/showing of the filter options yet, thought that could be another commit or pull request.\n. @ddennedy hmm. I was trying to think of a way to make it more automatic for the user if you can think of one. Was surprised I had to pick a filename the first time it came up, then worry about not deleting it from the filesystem etc.\n. @bmatherly that's not too bad to implement and I think makes a lot of sense. If these changes look good I can do that a near future PR.\n. @ddennedy doh. Same happens if you switch filters. It looks like the .qml is re-instantiated each time the filter is shown/hidden in the menu. If we can't save state there I looked at QmlFilter. I can't see anything in the QmlFilter class that would let me determine if there was an active analyze running. The job is created, queued and the delegate created but otherwise no state appears to be saved in QmlFilter. Suggestions for direction are welcome.\n. @ddennedy it sounds like a similar issue. The qml or filter isn't keeping state of whether the analysis had run or completed so it has no way of knowing what its state is when it is reloaded.\nInitial implementation thought was to have QmlFilter attach to its own analyzeFinished slot and use that to track whether analysis had completed or not. Trouble is that then we wouldn't be tracking the dirty status when the filter parameters changed.\nOther thought, subclass QmlFilter -> StabilizeQmlFilter and overload 'set' for the appropriate parameter changes and set an \"analysis needed\" boolean upon change.\nOther thoughts?\n. @ddennedy I get where you are going. Also, fixed the other issue but it wasn't in the last push. Will push tomorrow with something that I think can accomplish much of this. Thanks for the pointer and patience.\n. I think this is a little better than the last pull request but I'm guessing it still has some holes in its approach. Feedback welcome of course.\n. @ddennedy ahh I see what was going on and how the change you made corrected it.\n. @bmatherly just got to looking at this and it looks like ddennedy found and fixed it but thank you for the heads up.\n. @bmatherly it isn't an unreasonable assumption.

After lots of searching, I did find reference to qmelt in your build script, unfortunately linux distributions are about shared libraries and minimizing system sizes as opposed to ms windows where every package has it's own dependencies in a directory under program files  also our build service doesn't allow downloading from git during the build process. webvfx isn't listed as an essential dependency and I can't find it in any major distribution. there is a line cmd make -j$MAKEJ -C mlt/qmelt but the latest release of mlt-6.4.1 doesn't have any reference to qmelt except in src/melt/melt.c concerning osx.\nDoes this mean that shotcut is unable to export files without me creating the new package webvfx?\nI started giving shotcut tlc because I thought it was a good easy to use video editor and I'm sure it used to export to other formats a few versions ago.\n.

Movit is a common package in all major distros except Fedora, Altlinux also has shotcut-17.06 but no webvfx.\nMovit-1.5.1 was just accepted into Factory 3 days ago.. I'm assuming that I need github.com/mltframework/webvfx.git for the package, the releases look old.. @ddennedy I've hit a brick wall packaging webfx due to the fact that it needs mlt sources, I will attempt to build it within the mlt package or is there another solution?. I've packaged webvfx as a link of the mlt package that somebody named libmlt a long time ago. Shotcut now works as expected. In future I will parse the build-shotcut.sh script in future to find build and runtime dependencies.

It's not the cause of the issue, so the title has been changed to specify crashing on this version of Shotcut, as you've said this issue doesn't happen on older versions.\nIn this version there is a change in multi-track compositing that could be a source of problems. Are you using more than one video track?\nI will try and reproduce it and get back to you.\n. Okay, I've reproduced a crash like you described on OSX and it appears only to happen on the newest version of Shotcut. The issue seems to come from multi-track compositing like I thought.\nWhat I did to reproduce this is create a track with 3 images that each have a size and position filter change on them, and include a transition between each of them. Then on a new composite track above that, I added a video. The crash occurred when the playhead was over any point during the video where the images were visible, excluding the very beginning.\nThank you for notifying us, we will begin working on a fix for this.\n. Thanks for your detailed description. I've tried reproducing this on OSX and noticed the two job passes as well. The resulting file seems to match what you've described, so it seems like an issue with the application and dual pass as you said.\nI'm going to tag this as reproduced, and see what can be done.\n. Could you be more specific? What happens when you say it gets buggy? Attempting to reproduce this for myself just makes it more difficult to work with. I wouldn't know when or if it becomes buggy because I don't know what I should be looking for.\nAs for your questions and suggestions, I don't think it would be my place to answer them directly, but I could pass them along for you.\n. I've tried reproducing this issue on both OSX and Windows 10, but I can't get it to work and I'm not sure if I'm misinterpreting the report or not.\nFrom what I can understand, you're saying the problem is a video track represented as an audio track but still plays video. By attempting to add a video track below V1, a new one was added above instead, so you've deleted it. After deleting it, both remaining video tracks became composite tracks. Saving and reloading the project file shows the issue.\nDo you suspect the default placement of new tracks is the problem? I think it may just be an error with how their project file was saved and/or loaded. I've been trying to reproduce it by doing what you've said with multiple tracks but nothing ever appears out of order.\n. Testing this, I found the bug only occurs with images, not videos. You said this happened to you when working with a background image, so I assume that was what happened. I'm going to change the title from \"element\" from \"picture\".\nThis seems like an easy fix though, since a similar bug occurred for videos, so hopefully one will be on the way soon.\n. Unfortunately this has to be closed, since it is a duplicate report. Thank you for your good intentions about bringing up an old issue that may appear to be abandoned, but some problems about the application and its development are of higher priority than others. Time and motivation plays a big part in furthering development. The GPU processing is still clearly experimental, so any of the issues concerned with that are kind of expected.\nYou can read about how to access log files in the FAQ.\nhttps://www.shotcut.org/FAQ/#where-are-the-log-presets-database-and-settings-stored\n. Tried reproducing this on Windows 10 by exporting JPG stills of a video, then opened 2040 of them in a playlist and added them to the timeline. Although it takes an ungodly amount of time, I've experienced no crashes. For me, it froze when I tried to click anywhere else in the window but leaving it alone everything loaded eventually, around 10 minutes total. The stills would also play in the project timeline after a short delay. If there are any steps that you did that I haven't please tell me. Otherwise I would say just leave the application alone while it loads.\nEdit: Oh I see what you mean, sorry. Using image sequencing in the properties tab. Even still I couldn't reproduce it either in the source clip or project timeline.\n. Yes, that is how we are testing it and the program does not crash. Sending a picture or a log won't help, it has to be reproducible by one of us.\nIs this only happening with one specific sequence that you're trying? Or does it crash with any image sequence you load? If you export a new sequence using Shotcut > Export > stills/JPG and load that will it still crash?\n. Duplicate of issue #297, which has already been fixed and will be included in the next release of Shotcut.\n. Also confirmed crashing on OSX. Thank you for reporting the crash, hopefully it can be fixed in the upcoming new release of Shotcut this month.\n. Reproduced this issue on Windows 10, ver 16.08.12. The next release of Shotcut is coming up very soon, so a fix might be possible in that time.\nI found it happens for every kind of transition besides cut or dissolve. My best guess would be that the issue has something to do with the luma transition and filter plugins in the MLT Framework, or at least how Shotcut receives information from them. Each of these filters uses that grayscale map processing described in the page, and each missing file message points to a luma file.\nNot sure what exactly is causing the issue though.\n. I've noticed this on Windows 10 and OSX. Cannot currently access a Linux machine but I think it would be likely the same thing happens as well. Tested with default video mode settings, one mp4 25 fps clip, one MPEG 29.97 fps clip, and an mp4 23.97 fps clip.\n. In the Timeline.js file, scrolling by dragging the playhead is handled by a dragging function. The right edge works well enough, but the left edge gets caught once there is nowhere left to scroll.\nif (pos.x > headerWidth + scrollView.width - 50) {\n            // Right edge\n            scrollTimer.backwards = false\n            scrollTimer.start()\n        } else if (pos.x >= headerWidth && pos.x < headerWidth + 50) {\n            // Left edge\n            if (scrollView.flickableItem.contentX < 50) {\n                scrollView.flickableItem.contentX = 0;\n                scrollTimer.stop()\n            } else {\n                scrollTimer.backwards = true\n                scrollTimer.start()\n            }\n        } else {\n            scrollTimer.stop()\n        }\nThe line scrollView.flickableItem.contentX = 0; specifically has a bad effect on this, because it's trying to reset the position all the way to the start. This causes that flinging left you described in your video. Removing this line does solve the problem of the playhead being pushed back, but it's still shaky.\nI'm not going to say it's 100% fixed but consider this progress... :confused:\n. Sorry for late reply. I've reproduced this on Windows, both the 16.10.01 and 16.11.02 64 bit versions.\nThank you for the report, I will start working on this.\n. Unfortunately I could only reproduce the audio aspect of what you're describing.. all video transitions are working fine for me. \nThe issue you're describing is that when a cross transition is applied with one clip that doesn't have sound, and another that does have sound, the audio doesn't \"fade\" (or more accurately cross) like it does if just standard fade in and fade out filters are applied.\nThe way it should behave is that a clip with no audio should cross transition to the clip that does have audio, giving it that \"fade in\" effect. Instead it just immediately plays. So the bug is that it cannot render a fade in or out when there is no audio to work with? That's my guess...\nMechanically it's a little weird to describe, so sorry about the confusion \ud83d\ude05 Reproduced on Windows 10, Shotcut versions 16.10.01 and 16.11.02.\n. This has been fixed along with #349. This form and the other will be closed when the new version of Shotcut is released.. Hi, I don't know if it helps at all and this may not work for you, but since you've made these bug reports that have to do with out-of-sync exports, there is a forum post here that has a couple of solutions/workarounds for what sounds like a related issue.

    "raffi98": "Hi\nI'm not sure whether i should open a new issue for this : I noticed same kind of behavior in an even simpler situation.\nIn the timeline panel :\n- play head is at time= 0\n- a clip is at t=100\n- move the clip from 100 to 102\n  expected result : clip is moved and you see it\n  actual result : clip is moved but you can't see it, as timeline has been scrolled back to display the play head.\nRegards\n. I changed one by one LC_NUMERIC, windows localization format value, and both of them :\n- changing localization to English suffices to get the decimal point, \n- changing only LC_NUMERIC to English in a French localized OS doesn't set the point, but has an effect on absolute values in filters at least. (9.5 is reduced to 6.0, and some other weak values are reduced to 0). But this is observable only in the GUI, as the values in XML are left unchanged\n- changing both of the values produces the combination of the two previous effects\n. ",
    "XyllyX": "Ahh yes, this works, everything is where it should be now! I didn't reinstall it again after it happened the last time, but everything that was missing from the project is now back where it is.\nWhat could be causing this to happen? Although double-clicking the project file feels a little more convenient, I'm more than happy to continue working like this.\nEDIT: A side note, I'm sure this may have been said before, but I'm really happy about this level of support, and I hope to use this software for a long time, if I weren't as tight on cash right now, I'd donate straight away\n. I've run into a new issue, after trying to add in a video track below my \"base\" track, removing it again (it had become a triple-video track timeline, then back to double), it set both my original video tracks to composite, and then after opening the project again (via open file), my video track was turned into an audio track but somehow the software still reads the audio clips as videos?\nHere's a link to a screenshot showing what had happened to my video track\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bufRrsM.png\nHere, it shows the playback still showing the correct part for that segment in the audio section\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8IYtP4H.png\nswitching on composite on the video does not show the intended effect\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yZTkPiM.png\nI've somewhat worked around this issue by making another new video track and replacing everything manually\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dydi3ur.png\n. I'll see if I can, it only \"turned\" into an audio track after I restarted the program after attempting to create a track below the original V1 (the first video track I created), I believe I also deleted that new track after making it and then saving, and re-opening (there were 3 video tracks at one point), just making sure I've said this clearly enough\nV1 was the first video track, the only video track after that was also changed to V1 it seems, but it was V2 before, and the original V1 had changed into an audio track\nI'm describing it as best I can, but I saved it as it were in the last screenshot (as far as I can remember, some other things might have changed)\nAll I can say right now is that it hasn't been an issue since it first happened, but I don't know what could've caused it to change to an audio track, and as you can see from the screenshots, it was playing the video even where there was no video track, sorry if I can't say much else :(\nI'll definitely let you know first thing and try to keep an eye out if this ever happens again\n.

In almost all cases I've used video editing software, this had to be done, and I'm quite sure I'm not the only one.

    "ochilan": "Thank you very much for the quick responses. It's really a pity that this is such an issue, I thought this would be a fundamental thing to support. I'll use the workarounds in the meantime, I guess \u2013 does the quality of the audio suffer from adding the additional gain to everything? Otherwise shotcut seems to do everything I need for my purposes pretty well and it would be a pity to ditch it because of this.\n. I've been working more with shotcut in the last few days and I think it does have a lot of potential. But the audio mixing is just very broken \u2013 no matter if it's MLT or shotcut itself, this should not be wontfix. The audio mixing also depends on the order which the audio tracks have in the project. A simple repro is to create two tracks with e.g. a 440 and a 220 Hz sines, put them both into one project and listen to the result of the two possible orders. This gets a lot more pronounced with more tracks. Should I open another ticket? Something should be done regarding this.\n. That sounds promising, thank you. By the way, I did some experiments with other NLEs and their approaches to audio mixing are quite different. Kdenlive or even Adobe Premiere seem to use a sum of all audio tracks, even if this results in clipping. The result of flowblade appears to be more similar to what shotcut currently does, i.e. a nonlinear increase of amplitude with increasing number of overlaid audio tracks. That said, the result of the latter is less predictable or intuitive, at least for me. Since there will never be a magic wand for every case where audio tracks need to be mixed down, maybe it would even be better to stick to a \"simple\" solution and ultimately let the user decide what to do in case clipping occurs (e.g. applying a limiter to the final mix, reducing gain of individual tracks or the like).\n. I haven't realized the issue with the LC_NUMERIC property within the file before, I'll think about this. However, am I correct that the code as it was before would never offer to repair the file unless it contained both commas and periods? The point is, I don't see when this would happen regardless of the locale used unless the file has been edited manually.\n. I thought about this some more and did some research, and it shows that it's a mess like it always is when things like locales and different standards and pseudo-standards are involved.\nThe problem I see with having QLocale try to parse the LC_NUMERIC property is that on Windows, it will never be able to parse the value when it has been written by the Windows version of shotcut/MLT (where it will be something like \"German_Germany.1252\" in my case). So we would always \"fall back\" to the system locale anyway. If I'm not mistaken this will effectively make the LC_NUMERIC declaration in the XML useless and we will force it to conform to the system locale in any case.\nNot sure how to fix this. I guess using some other way to determine a proper LC_NUMERIC string when writing out the XML in the first place is not an option? Surely, something like QT should not be a dependency of MLT.\n. Or was this the idea, that it should always fall back to system locale on Windows? Not exactly a nice way to handle it, but I don't currently see a better way either. Except maybe to force some locale defined by us when writing out the XML on Windows instead of using the system locale.\n. Oops, I didn't know new commits would automatically be added to an already existing pull request, I didn't really mean to add it here. But anyway, now that it is here: Note that the way the widgets are enabled/disabled is not really consistent. For instance, if you select another Video Mode from the settings menu, the resolution, FPS, etc. are entered into the Video tab of the encoding dock and are editable. If you then select a Preset from the list, they become disabled. If you then once again select another Video Mode, the values are changed but the fields are still disabled. Are they meant to be re-enabled in this case, i.e. when another Video Mode is selected?\n. Regarding the \"know what you're doing\": That is true. Would it probably help to e.g. de-select the chosen preset from the list once some manual change is being done? Or some other way to let the user know that the values now deviate from the chosen preset?\n. What language and \u2013 in particular \u2013 number format settings are you using? I'm asking because I observed the following: I'm using German number format on Win 10. The usual decimal point symbol is then \",\" (comma). Everything works as expected. As soon as I change the decimal point symbol to e.g. \".\" (period) in the \"Additional settings...\" panel in the \"Region\" settings of Windows, shotcut goes crazy when I try to move the bounding rectangle of the Size and Position filter around.. @ddennedy Restarting shotcut completely doesn't seem to be necessary, but just changing the decimal point doesn't seem to influence an existing Size and Position filter either. It appears to be necessary to delete and re-add the Size and Position filter to apply the changed behavior to it. Maybe the changed setting is applied during filter initialization?. @ddennedy That said, if the decimal point setting is set to the \"not cool\" version, restarting shotcut doesn't help to fix the issue. In my case, having the decimal point set to \",\" works, having it set to \".\" does not work, even after restarting.. There's a recent commit https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/commit/ad26978f5b62cbb6c2d4737496cf7f073b843fcd fixing exactly this issue, I suppose it will be in the next release. Haven't tested the fix myself though as I usually work under Linux.. Seems like a regression from shotcut 16.12 to 17.01. Could only reproduce on Windows, not Linux. I guess the problem is that the image is added with an enormous duration (also seen in the video) to the playlist and adding it to the timeline causes a crash/hang.\nAlso probably related, dragging an image in the Source panel shows the image with the path \"/Live\" and doesn't allow it to be added to the timeline at all. With 16.12, this all works as expected as far as I can see.. Sorry for the spam -.- I didn't understand that the memory management of movit is just a little obscure through the effect chain graphs and the ResampleEffect doesn't need a destructor. In fact, this destroys the cleanup later on. The SingleResamplePassEffect destructor is called when the EffectChain is destroyed.\nI think after all, it boils down the the same question I have in issue #390. Effects such as the ResampleEffect (as well as Inputs, etc.) are created all the time by MLT (e.g. every frame during playback) but are only very seldomly destroyed (e.g. if an effect is enabled/disabled in shotcut). The question I have is thus what change is necessary to clean up the movit EffectsChain (I suppose?) in time, or to reuse it in a suitable way without creating hundreds of objects each frame.. My best guess is that it's special cases of movit filters that are problematic such as Resample and Blur which themselves create raw pointers to sub-filters (SingleResamplePassEffect in case of Resample) and register them in the movit effects graph. MLT tries to clean up the created effects (dispose_movit_effects in filter_movit_convert.cpp?) by calling delete on the effect instances. But in the aforementioned cases this will not delete the created sub-filters. They only seem to get deleted when movit cleans up the whole graph, deleting all nodes and attached effects.. > It is not my intention to maintain a fork of Movit.\nUnderstood. While I'm not sure now at all whether the trouble I'm seeing is really a fault in movit, I will direct any (real) fixes I may do at some point upstream and let you know if it's relevant for MLT or shotcut. I also experienced that the movit repos don't seem to be the most reliable when working with them the last few days.\n\nI have been meaning to experiment with a change where we do not take a GL texture from Movit, but make it always transfer to an RGBA buffer in CPU RAM.\n\nInteresting \u2013 if you ask me I'm somebody who embraces using the newest stuff available, but I totally understand that this also means problems. In that regard, I don't know if compatibility will really be an issue. Even newer OpenGL versions should be available on almost all relevant machines (what OpenGL versions are we talking about btw?). The typical source of problems may be something like integrated GPUs, but first they got better as well, and second I don't know if you really want to do serious video editing on such a machine anyway (but that's only my opinion). \nRegarding the performance, it's a bit hard to tell. Certainly, GPU/CPU transfers are costly and should be avoided if possible. I'm often working with large point cloud data which may not fit in GPU memory for rendering, in such cases using CPU memory may be an option since the transfer overhead is negligible compared to the benefits (or necessities). But for a handful of small textures the overhead may hurt. (Btw, what is the special thing about the Qt version you are using, is updating not an option, or does Quick still not play nice with newer OpenGL?) But if this is the only feasible solution at the moment and it's quick to test, maybe you should give it a try. If you have a branch that you would like me to try, let me know.\nAt any rate, if you want to experiment in the direction of GPU-based rendering, I'm all for it. It's a good direction to go. I'm using shotcut for putting together videos with 3 to 4 H.264 video tracks and 3-4 audio tracks and using GPU mode makes a huge difference for me. In fact, I tried a very popular and widely used commercial video editor for a few days and in addition to not supporting the container format I use (MKV which I use for a good reason actually), the performance was very underwhelming (without first creating proxy clips at least, but I haven't tried that and don't really want to either). Especially for the simple editing I do, I was glad to switch back to shotcut (together with a little hack that allows me to do simple multi camera editing \u2013 I really need to look into implementing such a feature at some point since I often need it).\n\nI am not in a position now with time to give the issues you raise any assistance.\n\nNo worries. If I'm really really stuck with something I will say so, otherwise I still need to learn more about how everything works together and then maybe I can also work out some fixes. For me personally I have a hack now that gives me good performance even if it's not exactly stable.. I tried the non-shared-context-gpu branch in direct comparison with the master branch. It does work, also with multiple video tracks in parallel, but I do get dropped frames much more often than with the regular branch. Not that it's unusable or anything, it's just not as smooth.. Another thing I noticed with the branch is that the jumps I described in the forum due to threaded optimizations in the nvidia driver doesn't happen to me with the new branch.. At first I thought so too (and indeed, I missed the commit when I wrote the comment), but as it turns out I haven't even used the updated build script for building with the new branch at that time and as such the added line was not in there. I tried again and even when I explicitly try to enable the optimization, I cannot reproduce the jitter with the new branch. In the master branch (without disabling the optimizations, i.e. when disabling the fix), it still happens.. That's great news! I use this filter all the time. I will try this out soon.\nI think the blur filter also uses a similar construct with hpass and vpass nodes. Is a similar change also applicable there? Haven't used this filter as much yet; this is something I only saw in the code. I don't know of other filters using a similar scheme.. Ah, I get your point. I haven't realized before that the \"Duration\" property of an image in the Source viewer (which is exposed to the user through the Properties dock) has a different meaning than the duration of a movie clip in the Source viewer: the duration of an image basically moves the out-point around while the duration of a movie clip makes it seem as if the whole clip actually has the duration set in the properties dock.\nHow about making the duration property consistent for image and video clips: An image clip could have some default duration (e.g. 10 minutes) and a shorter part of this clip could be extracted using the in- and out-points similarly to a movie clip (the out-point could be defaulted to a few seconds like before). Then the duration of the image could be modified in the properties dock if a longer image clip is desired. This would be more similar to how movie clips work in the Source viewer as well \u2013 the in- and out-points are independent of the clip duration.\nBy the way: The fact that the duration property sets the position of the out-point in case of an image clip has its flaws. If you open an image and set the in-point to e.g. 10 seconds and then set the duration in the properties dock to to something less than 10 seconds, the out-point will be left of the in-point (which can actually also be achieved by dragging the points). When adding the clip to the timeline the apparent length of the clip will be the difference of the in- and out-points but the duration of the clip will be the duration set in the properties in the source viewer.\nBy the way 2: If you want me to move some of the \"issues\" I added yesterday to the forum since they are rather feature requests, please let me know and I will do so, sorry about that.. Hello Jan-Philipp,\nI'm also a German user using mostly English user interfaces with partial German locale (e.g. for date and time) and I know that certain problems may arise due to this, but I haven't heard of this particular issue yet. Can you give us some more information what exactly you need to do for this issue to arise? What kind of video are you editing, what is its size, which profile are you using in shotcut, which settings for exporting are you using, are you using video filters? And also, which OS are you using?\nBest regards\nSebastian. Hello,\nsorry but I still have trouble understanding the issue. The image shows a preview in Windows Explorer which obviously is square shaped and the space over and under the video is simply filled by black color. As you said, the video dimensions are shown correctly in the metadata. Does it also show like this in a video player? What exactly is different after repairing the XML and re-exporting? Can you show us the XML file(s) before and after repairing?\nBest regards\nSebastian. Hello,\nfirst off, I despise locale settings. With this out of the way, the XMLs you provided show that the original (non-repaired) file has the de_DE numeric locale setting (the value of LC_NUMERIC in the second line) but at the same time it uses dots instead of commas as the decimal separator which is weird, and which may cause the problem you're seeing when opening the file because it is inconsistent. The repaired file has de_DE locale and uses commas.\nI tried to create a file with shotcut on Windows 10 that has the same problem, but I was not able to achieve this yet. I'm normally using Windows in English language, but with German numeric and date format which can be set separately in the \"Region\" control panel (not sure what its name is in the German Systemsteuerung but it's the control panel where you have five drop down menus for date formats and you can set additional settings like the decimal separator in an extra dialog that you get using the \"Additional settings...\" button at the bottom).\nAt any rate, shotcut always seems to use whatever I set in the Region control panel. If it is set to English (US) then en_US locale and dots will be used, when set to German it sets de_DE locale and uses commas. Even if I override the decimal separator manually in the additional settings (e.g. German locale but it should use dots), it will then use that decimal separator without problems. The only way I was able to reproduce the problem yet was to save the file using one setting, change the locale settings in Windows (and restart shotcut) and then trying to open the XML again, but then it is reasonable that the decimal separators don't match the locale given in the XML file.\nHave you done any manual tweaking of the Region settings before? Can you show us screenshots of those settings in Windows maybe?. The stabilize filter has recently been marked incompatible with GPU mode, see commit 8de07dafef1d3685f902f6298d00bc5f746e12f6. 3.1 is also affected. Trying to find the revision where it started to get worse.. That took some effort. I think I found the commit that is the culprit in the 3.1 branch. It should be noted that even the newest version of the 3.0 branch doesn't have the problem even though the latest commits in 3.0 are newer than said commit in the 3.1 branch.\nThe bad news is that it is a huge commit and it's not immediately clear to me what the problem is. It is this merge commit:\nhttps://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/6f69f7a8bf6a0d013985578df2ef42ee6b1c7994\nUsing the parent commit 60b7518 results in smooth playback. Checking out the commit above yields stuttering playback. I will let you know if I find out more, but if you want to take a look as well, feel free to do so.. I can also reproduce the issue under Windows 10 64-bit when comparing the August and September shotcut packages. Exactly the same stuttering and reduced CPU usage in the recent version.. yw. I made a video showing the repro (it has two parts \u2013 first using only the contextual menu to add and insert tracks, and then using Ctrl-I to add the first two tracks, with the same result). I also added two mlt files, one resulting in adding three tracks, and one adding two tracks and then inserting a third track. If you take a look at the diff, it seems like the inserted track is missing a \"shotcut:video\" property. A transition is also missing a \"disable\" property.\nNote that if you open the \"add_add_insert.mlt\" project, it does not appear to be broken since I didn't hide the second track using the eye icon. If I open it, hide the track, save and re-open it, then it is broken, i.e. the video track becomes an audio track.\nHope this helps.\nshotcut_bug.zip\n. Note that the lag does not seem to be due to performance issues, but due to incorrectly positioned keyframes (they seem to have an offset from the correct start position of the clip, see above attached video).. Ah, that's interesting \u2013 on Arch there's not even a distinction between lib and usr/lib anymore (lib is simply symlinked to usr/lib for quite some time now). Anyway, maybe an includelist could then explicitly whitelist libraries that should be included in any case. Doesn't really make it more overseeable, but resolving library dependencies are not the nicest problem to have in the first place. :). ",

Unfortunately, I cannot see a pattern for this happening. As you see in this case the problem is with the right edge of the big video clip on the left. Interestingly splitting the clip, while the new small clip on the right has fade handles which work correctly, the one on the left keeps ignoring the mouse hover.\nHope this helps.\nhttps://youtu.be/ceoQ9i8LLK8.

    "rcmaniac25": "Forgot: I intended to compile the source and try it but the instructions for building the source code doesn't appear to be working for me. Just using Qt Creator is giving me errors I'm not understanding right now (I never really worked with Qt Creator). Related to #357. HDMI capture device is generally known as \"EZCAP\" (There are multiple OEMs, but they all look like this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA8K734F7543)\nFile format is mp4\n...working on the other questions (currently testing with parallel processing disabled)\nThe compiling source was just so I could attempt checking if there is something Shotcut is doing at the point where the gap occurs.. Disabling parallel processing didn't fix the gap. It's still there.\nWorking on the other questions.. Exporting from playlist didn't work.\nI uploaded some sample files at the link specified. I expected it to give me a link but it didn't so the file names aren't exactly great.\nt1-p1.mp4 is \"test 1, part 1\"\nt1-p2.mp4 is \"test 1, part 2\"\nt1.mp4 is t1-p1 + t1-p2\nYou can see the gap after 10 sec. Note: it flashes white... that isn't what I see when I do this. I only see the slight pause between the clips. They also didn't come out the same FPS as the original, even though I specified the same FPS. I don't know why.\nLet me know if you have any questions. I can upload some files that aren't synthetically split, but they will be 2GB per clip. I don't know how much space may be available on the support site.. 1. Since the EZCAP device is standalone and I have no control over where the files are split, the best I can do of the captured video I have is ~4GB of video. If this is fine, I will upload 2 clips.\n2. I'm not sure if you mean the FPS changes mid-video (I don't know if that's a thing or not). I just checked with VLC and, while I don't know how VLC determines the framerate, most clips are constant (29.968648) but not all. In fact, I have a couple which are obviously playing at a higher FPS then what VLC states (5.698382). Is it that between clips it's not supported? Or the \"can it change mid-video\" is not supported?\n3. But if the other editor has seamless audio and video, then what might it be cutting?\n4. So what you're saying is that the audio is somehow longer then the video (with the extra audio being null data), and thus MLT is retaining the extra audio data and causing the video to be slightly longer. Giving it a delay between clips? I reiterate and expand on 3). Why is the other editor not encountering this issue? Does it just ignore the null data and end the clip when both audio is null and video is null?\nThis is all lead up to (along with an answer for 1) if you want original clips, but they'll total 4GB in size): what can I do then? I have only digitized a few recordings (this is me converting family VHS tapes to digital), but I have hundreds total. While another editor may give me the desired result, Shotcut offers more flexibility and the ability to assemble possibly tens of these conversions together while others are exporting or enqueued. As indicated in addendum to the original post: I'm not against doing some code work to try and fix it if it's something that needs fixing but low priority, but I don't know where to start on it right now. Though, that is if it's a bug.. 1. EZCAP has a single button which is a toggle to start and stop recordings. If all you want is one file, I can do a short recording. If you want a recording that gets split into 2, I need to do the larger recordings.\n2. I will try those programs out.. Ok.\nI also ran MediaInfo on some files. Do you have a preference on what format I post the results in? The only variable info I see is \"OverallBitRate_Mode\". I uploaded issue356_Encode_1080P_21_15.mp4.\nAll EZCAP recordings are in the format of \"Encode_[].mp4. No problem. I'll have to look into ffmpeg then. To refer to the statement from earlier, \"what is with the video that ffmpeg has issues with but other (at least iMovie) can handle just fine.. Hmm. Doing a ffmpeg concat (ffmpeg.exe -f concat -i sources.txt -c copy output.mp4) produces a seamless file. Now, that may not help for a non-linear editor such as Shotcut, but at least it produces the expected result. Though it does complain Non-monotonous DTS in output stream 0:0; previous: 26504192, current: 26504192; changing to 26504193. This may result in incorrect timestamps in the output file.\nAlso, the audio issue #357 doesn't occur.. Trying it now. That didn't resolve the issue. The audio is still out-of-sync.. In #356, the theory that the video is vfr was also mentioned. I need to find a video that is vfr as everyone's mentioning it and the tools that mention it, but I don't know what the tool says to indicate it's vfr. When I look at the videos referenced by this issue with MediaInfo, they are listed as having a framerate (again, not sure if it's going to say \"vfr\" or give a constant frame rate). I will need to read all responses other then OP and the first couple posts. But otherwise it is good to cross-link the forum and here.. ",

This is mainly because the volume bar's general color is right in between the colors of both mute button states.\nAltering the volume/speaker icon instead of the mute button with x/((( as described would solve it all. Besides, doing that would also make it so that anyone could see whether it's muted or not right away, without having to click it and having to check the volume bar and mute button first.\nThanks for the understanding and consideration..

It doesn't seem to be making much progress. Scrolling through the timeline is nearly impossible due to the UI being unresponsive. Other than this issue, was really enjoying working with Shotcut. Any hints on when this refresh takes place so I can try to not have it happen? Even bringing the app to the foreground barely works.. I have left it running for hours and after it did the audio waveforms (with some unfinished clips) it didn't do the video thumbnails. Have retried a few times and it starts over entirely and doesn't manage to finish. How to proceed? Is there some sort of cache (that database you speak of) I can wipe so it starts from scratch? I actually don't care that much for the audio waveforms, the thumbnails are much more important so I can visually see what's going on in the timeline. The track its context menu does have a hide waveforms option, but it doesn't seem to stop generating them just visually disables them.\nReally bummed about this as I have a pretty decently sized project with lots of clips and redoing it probably won't be with Shotcut, if this issue cannot be dealt with..

Which means that I can not install Shotcut using the package manager.\nDo you guys have some kind of script that would just check the dependencies?\n\nMost excellent suggestion that would have a broad reaching effect!!\nI had something possibly similar occur with a popular browser you install by extracting directories instead of using e.g. apt-get install in Debian Linux. DAYS' worth of mind boggling trial and error led to partial success when I tripped over the libjs series of available packages.\nFrom my perspective out here, it's about all these nice packages that arrive self-contained so that we don't touch things like apt-get install. WHAT HAPPENS IS... we then miss out on that handy little tickle that apt/apt-get and similar package managers put in our face regarding potentially useful suggested packages.\nIt would definitely be nice to have something secondary available to turn to for all those self-contained packages. If it's already out there, some of us just haven't tripped over that, too and yet. :laughing: \nUPDATING this to add a thought that just occurred: Because of the way they work, Developers' systems are chock full of all kinds of software gathered over time. I'll bet Developers don't always know that something is a dependency, be it suggested or required, until it eventually becomes a voiced showstopper for an end user.. Pre-thought 1: If you use ShotCut a lot, there's a possibility that it might load automatically after each reboot. You could (try):\nApplications > Settings > Session and Startup > Application Autostart (tab) > Click \"Add\" button > type full path to executable file in Command text field then exit out as appropriate to save that change.\nThat may or may not work, but it's worth a shot.\nPre-thought 2: ArchLinux Wiki to the rescue with a nice, cognitively friendly explanation of just these very files: Desktop entries\nOK... Pre-finding ArchLinux's \"Desktop entries\" wiki page, I created a hack... a work-around that worked FOR ME, BUT I don't have shotcut downloaded to test it specifically. I tested the following with a different but similar self-contained package already on my computer.\nDISCLAIMER: Some of the following lines will surely need tweaked, but, again, this DID work just like this.\nTo start this, I knew that we, as root, can play around in:\n/usr/share/applications\nNext, I found a third similar video editor that had been installed via Debian Linux apt-get. As root user, I used the mousepad text editor to open that third video editor's corresponding file under /usr/share/applications.\nWARNING IF YOU TEST DRIVE THIS: Save that newly opened file under a different name NOW before you touch anything else. You will lose that original entry in your Applications Menu if you do NOT. You're about to test drive overwriting that information. That's what will cause you to lose that original, previously fully functioning Applications Menu entry.\nExample file, just drop the dotTXT ending that Github required\nSo... These are the lines that are now in the file that just worked for me:\n```\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=ShotCut Video Editor\nGenericName=Video Editor\nX-GNOME-FullName=ShotCut Video Editor\nComment=Create and edit videos and movies\nExec=/entire/path/to/shotcut/executable/location %F\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nIcon=shotcut\nCategories=GNOME;GTK;AudioVideo;Video;AudioVideoEditing;\nMimeType=application/vnd.videoeditorexecutablename-project;\nX-AppInstall-Package=videoeditorexecutablename\nX-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=VideoEditorNameWithCapsEGShotCut\n```\nThat's been tweaked to need as little further updating as possible to possibly function on other users' systems. Before final edit to include here, some of that matched as needed for it to open that third video editor app here locally (for me).\nThose hashtagged lines do appear to be successfully commented out because the icon on my system defaulted to a recognized default. If left uncommented, there is a blank space instead of an icon. That's what told me that the hashtags do work here.\nI tried deleting some of those commented out lines rather than hashtagging them. The menu entry zap disappeared and would not come back for nothing even after those deleted lines were put back in place. The Applications Menu entry reappeared when I simply created a new, differently named file and filled it back in again. Odd quirk. :smile:\nThe Icon line will NOT work because that icon is within the self-contained file. The work-around there would be to play around with adding appropriate icons under /usr/icons.\nWhere I wrote videoeditorexecutablename, that would possibly be replaced with shotcut IF those lines are appropriate for ShotCut. The capitalization of that word will match however the clickable executable is named, presumably most likely in all lowercase letters, e.g. shotcut.\nFor the last line that includes VideoEditorNameWithCapsEGShotCut, that appears to most likely be the \"proper name\" for the executable program. DISCLAIMER: I'm just guessing about that based on what was there before I adapted the file for this. :smile:\nIf this looks like something that might actually work, Developers are invited to please edit my comment as necessary if you have that type of ownership here. If that's not possible, just let me know what needs changed to fit ShotCut's personality, and I'll make the change(s) as soon as possible. That's in case mine is the only comment websurfers wander in to read here.\nOF NOTE: That MimeType line in particular seems like something important that should be updated, uncommented, and included if possibly applicable to ShotCut. On the flipside, there is the possibility that line will forever be irrelevant to self-contained packages/programs. :smile:. Hi.. \"Just\" a normal user here. I came in here to nervously ask if there's an XML type file that you can manually edit.\nTHEN I read the following #531 comment:\n\nYou are affected by this MLT bug. Your project includes itself (MLT XML) in the Playlist. You may have done this by using File > Open MLT XML as Clip and then choosing the project you are editing. I need to prevent this, but it should be fairly obvious that this will cause a problem.\nI edited your XML to remove that self-reference, and I uploaded it to here. Let me know when you have downloaded it; so I can remove it.\n\n1) COOL. There are manually editable files (with tons of references to XML if you grep Shotcut's git clone for the same, by the way).\n2) Don't forget to backup with at least one safely saved copy before playing with these files. :smile: \nSo what I was thinking is: Can you grab Issue #531's original poster's uploaded file and the Dev's revised copy to compare what the Dev changed that worked and helped close that issue for them? That will confirm one way or another if your issue is similar to #531 .\nIf your project still crashes after that, especially if that wasn't your problem at all, maybe you could next nose around to see what file contains a reference to the audio file that was touched just before the original crash.\nIf this was me experiencing this, I would again grep or otherwise comparably search the project's own home directory to locate which file contains the name of the potentially offending audio file.\nIf a reference is found in a manually editable file, you could play around with deleting (perhaps just \"commenting out\"?) that reference then keep attempting to reload the project along the way.\nEven if both options still don't help, attempting them won't be a waste of time and effort. It's a great way to learn more about how these things work overall. You get to see how one single change in those files affects the project's outcome. It can be a fun and very techie-empowering ah-ha moment if it actually works. :smile: . ",

I've looked through the documentation on https://www.mltframework.org/doxygen/webvfx/effects_authoring.html and can't find a way to extract an absolute time value. As in the above code the param passed to render is basically a percentage of progress through the current clip. So if I apply the above transition to a 5 second clip, the overlay takes 5 secs to fade in. A 2 second clip, 2 seconds to fade in.\nHowever I want to make the animation apply to e.g. the first 500ms of any clip and have the div at full opacity for the rest of it's clip. I would need something like a value for the duration of the current clip to do the math. Does such a thing exist? \n. Brilliant! Thanks so much for your help. Hard coding the FPS is no biggie.

The audio of the videos themselves remain in sync after export, but the audio track I add is out of sync after export.

Sometimes it seems they gradually get more out of sync later in the video, sometimes it seems to jump back and forth. \nIs this related? I didn't find an issue describing exactly this problem.. ",

I removed the new ones and re-installed the old ones after though before trying this one.. The portable one seems to work. Hadn't tried the AppImage.

I'm able to add audio and video tracks and start exporting files, but the program is very unstable and stops working (whiteout) or crashes after a short while almost every time.

Switching between the OpenGL and DirectX does not make any difference, neither does disabling \"parallel processing\" or adding an empty video track in the project (a tip I found on youtube).\nApart from ShotCut, my PC is working perfectly, so I'm suspecting it is related to this software.\nHelp is greatly appreciated!\nThanks,\nH. Thanks for your quick reply MrShannonH!\nI'm running on my brand new PC built by myself, now with win 10 (initially I started with Ubuntu, but the program was crashing there as well, so therefore I tried windows instead.

Just an update on this issue: \nI have tested ShotCut at my workstation at work (128GB RAM, Win 7) and it is unstable there as well and crashing frequently, but not as frequently as on my home PC. I was able to export a video clip with the 3D text filter on at work. I thought it would work at home to just start a new project and import this video clip in to a new project and in that way avoid adding any filter at home. But no, the program is still crashing every 3-4 minutes or so and quite hopeless to use. I have only added on small video file (4K) and one audio file to the project so the project is not big at all. Unless this issue is fixed soon I think I will look for other 4K video editing options as I need something stable for my bigger projects.. ",

Have you tried substituting that image for a different image, or using software such as ms paint to change the format to PNG or something similar? that was the workaround I used. If it is a large image and you're using 32-bit shotcut, it may use too much RAM. Theoretically, 32-bit applications can use up to 4GB of RAM, but due to some weird historical thing, they only end up using 2GB, and you need to apply a 4GB patch in order for them to use the full 4GB (although 64-bit programs are always better)\nBut anyway, I'd say what is happening is that Qmelt is getting a BAD_ALLOC error, in other words, it can't get enough RAM because of this. Try it on 64-bit shotcut and see if it works.... > Please be aware that this was created with v18.05.03\nThe MLT was created with 18.05.03, but when the export failed for a different reason, I updated shotcut to 18.05.08. Maybe this has something to do with it. (possible migration issues?)\n\nDid you remove or disable that filter to see if it works?\n\nI made another video using the same source, but without the audio visualisation, and without some other filters near the end, and it worked fine.

What is the name of the clip that made it fail?. Maybe changing the order of filters could help.\nPutting size and position earlier...\nFrom my knowledge, it would work best before the glow filter. so that the glow doesn't get warped and stuff due to the keyframes on the size and position filter. Sounds good!. I'll be able to try it out in about 12 hours. On battery power at the moment.. Trying it now... I'll leave it overnight. Let you know the results in the morning.... Well...

This image \"14182277_xl.jpg\" is 3456x2304. . To make this problem clear. I created another simple project which will definitely cause qmelt.exe crashed on my Windows 10. And I put my mlt file and the resource files here.\nWhen exporting video, the qmlet.exe crashed at the 204th frame, and my choosing framerate is 25, so the relative time on the timeline is \"00:00:08:00\", where we are going to handle the high-resolution image(the second picture as follows).\n\nAnd I rememberd I have raised a question on Project MLT about the high-resolution images issues. And I got a reply that the problem has fixed in e426a4e and 71167e6.\nI don't know if the qmelt.exe, attached by this version of Shotcut(18.05.08), has that two patches or not.\nSo I built my own latest melt.exe(version v6.9.0) to test this problem and it still crashed.\n\nSo I decided to open the mlt with the early version of Shotcut(17.02.01), and it works fine. \nAnd I built another melt.exe(version v6.9.0), but revert these two patches e426a4e and 71167e6, it works well.\nSo I think these two patches may have side effects and can't solve the large images related problems.\nThere are still many problems about still images with affine filters, and may cause \"out of memory\" errors especillay with 32bit melt.\n. @HDSQmid  Yes, I tried. After replacing the large image with another normal image, it works well. So I think  the problem is in the way MLT dealing with large images. . @ddennedy  Uhh... It's a little bit complicated, but I have to say It is  indeed a bug. And I will install the 64-bit Shotcut to test if it has the same problem.. @HDSQmid  I have raised a question here and @ddennedy had told me about that thing. Actually it works well on a 64-bit Shotcut. and I know it's because of the huge memory allocation. But I wanna know if there is a way that can solve this problem and make it works with less memory usage.\nEven if it's a large image, should we really need to allocate such huge memory? Can we just take a step-by-step processing? \nSorry, I am unfamiliar with the code and I am trying to understand them.. > Oh, I just thought of something else. The Parallel processing option in Export uses quite a bit more memory. I should disable that on 32-bit.  \nAs you know, disable the Parallel processing will lead a video export speedlose. Can we just disable the Parallel processing when dealing with large images or some cases that will use a lot of memory? \n\nOne thing I noticed while working with your files is that Shotcut loads screenshot.jpg with pixbuf instead of qimage (preferred as of 18.03).\n\nUhh... Actually I didn't use that screenshot.jpg, I just do a screenshot to show you my timeline layout. But I'm glad that you have sloved your problem. And I can infer from your conclusion that the qimage loads a image according to its file extension instead of its real foramt, which may be a potential bug.. > It is quite possible that the change in 71167e6 to reduce memory usage by turning off memory pooling exposes more pointer bugs because memory pool keeps more address space pinned within the process. I think some of these bugs have been fixed lately.\nAs you said, the memory pooling mechanism has existed for quite a while and now you turn off it, but expose more bugs.  So will you still turn off memory pooling and fix bugs over successive versions or just revert 71167e6 and continue to fix the memory pooling relevant bugs ?. So your conclusions is that enable MLT Parallel Processing and multi-thread encoding simultaneously will cause huge memory usage and make melt.exe crashed in some situations on 32-bit machine, and the solution is either disable parallel processing or reduce encoder threads?\n\nTaking this to another level and adding 1 to each avformat-novalidate producer in the MLT XML file, and RAM usage does exceed 570 MiB. \n\nIs the property \"threads\" used to choose the number of threads to use in the decoder? I looked this in producer_avformat.yaml, But I don't know if what we mentioned is the same thing or not. And I saw the default value of \"threads\" is 1.\n\nAnd I will continue studying the code and figure out the specific meaning of MLT_SLICES_COUNT and MLT_AVFORMAT_SLICED_PIXFMT_DISABLE and do some experiments to test it again.\nBy the way, when I compiled MLT with mingw32, I got this error.\n\nAnd I just barely added \"int cpus = 2;\" to make build success. You can fix this build error if you get that time and mood.\nThank you so much for your help.\n. @ddennedy Okay, get it. Thank you once again for you reply.. ",

I will upload changes once done.\n\nWhat is your opinion on the two options above?\n\nI would rather choose 2nd option: leave it for the moment. It can be easily removed in the future when the new filter is there or when we find another idea. We better keep users' habits unchanged for the moment.. Hello, I changed \"raw\" values with percentage as suggested (screenshot below): Hue and Lightness goes from 0 to 200 % and Saturation goes from 0 to 500 % (actually can go up to 1000 % but not sure if it's really useful to go that high).\nRegarding your discussion with keyframes, I haven't used this feature yet so can't help you much.

I can try them with v18.03, probably tomorrow.\nIt could be that after struggling for a while to get the first 3 seconds of my mp4 files to be played, I got put off by the fact that converting them to wav/flac still seemed to have the issue - but then I might have just tested them in the source player and without considering the Realtime setting..

I tried the portable and had something like \"libmtl++.so.3\"(not guaranteed to be the right name) missing. I'm rebuilding right now, my bad internet connection makes it take a while.. First I need to say I saved the project when exporting didn't work, here some facts:\nFunfact 1: When I open the proj.\u00b9 I get a warning that it's damaged.\nFunfact 2: I have a Color Grading on my clip, when I open the project and tell it to repair the file, it sets the black-white bar of the Midtones to black.\nFunfact 3: When I try to render in portable 18.08.1 with the repaired, it seems to work (it finished while writing this).\nFunfact 4: 3 applies to 18.07.2, too (it finished while writing this too).\nFunfact 5: The differences seem to be:\ndamaged: \" en_US)\ndamaged: \"id=\"black\" in=\"00:00:00.000\" out=\"00:01:20.117\">\", \"\", \"\"\nrepaired: \"id=\"black\" in=\"00:00:00,000\" out=\"00:01:20,117\">\", \"producer=\"black\" in=\"00:00:00,000\" out=\"00:01:20,117\"/>\", \"id=\"producer0\" title=\"Anonymous Submission\" in=\"00:00:00,000\" out=\"00:01:25,900\">\"\n(dot -> comma)\nFunfact 6: When I open the proj.\u00b9 without repairing, 2 doesn't happen.\nFunfact 7: I successfully started rendering the proj.\u00b2 without repairing and it seems to work so far.

The behavior is that it will not work unless started by su or sudo. The difference must be in the use of encrypted partitions. Home computer where I can't run shotcut as user but must run as sudo or su is as follows:\n/boot ext4 not encrypted\n/ ext4 LUKS encrypted\n/home ext4 LUKS encrypted\n/home/vboxes ext4 LUKS encrypted\nswap LUKS encrypted.\nSecond computer  set up is:\n/boot ext4\nRemainder configured using LVM for /, /home, and swap with no encryption. This one will run shotcut installed from the same rpmfusion site without problem.\nIf this is not the proper place to try to trace down this problem, please refer me to the proper person.. What I mean by \"it will not work\" is that I can launch shotcut via the icon and it will open. However, when I load a video file  via the Open File dialog, CLIP0032.ASF being an example, it will appear to open the file. The information about the file will appear on the left in the Properties area. However, the section to the right of it where the video should be playing is blank. Clicking the || or > on the control does nothing. The area remains blank.\nIf I open shotcut via sudo shotcut, then when I load the file, the properties will show the file information but this time the section to the right contains the video playing as expected. I do not know what you mean by SDL error. I have tried to describe this behavior above in the first post in this topic. Are there some troubleshooting steps I can execute to try to show what is happening?\nI can repeat this behavior. I expect that the LUKS encrypted drives may be causing this but I can't figure out why that should be the case. The behavior is the same whether GPU Effects is turned on or off so I don't think that is the problem.\nLinux aaaaa.bbbbbb 4.18.17-300.fc29.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Nov 5 17:56:16 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux.

So the filter list is only returning results that contain \"te\" in the name of the filter.

Talk to gentoo.\n\nWell, no, it's something that causes malfunction in you software, so it should be handled gracefully by it. It wouldn't hurt if at startup (at first startup?) Shotcut would display a warning message about the plugins that it couldn't load and the cause for that. It's not some-kind-of-tricky-hacking, it's just informing the user about the thing that already happened and has known cause. E.g. \"The following filters couldn't be loaded because you MLT installation lacks required features:\" then list of the Shotcut filters and corresponding MLT filters that they rely on. Or \"The following filters is incompatible with GPU rendering and were disabled:\" and so on. It's very simple thing, but it would save so much time for the people. Be a little graceful to the user, it won't kill any kittens.\nP.S.: To one who will also stumble upon issue - media-libs/mlt should be compiled with \"fftw\" USE flag.. And also for some obscure reason Shotcut expects melt binary to be named as \"qmelt\". It's neither so in Ubuntu/Debian/Gentoo (it's just \"melt\") nor in RPM-based (it's \"mlt-melt\"). Please also give it a thought. This is very small thing, so I don't want to create separare issue for it.. > Those ideas are not bad. But no one here volunteers to implement them. Patch welcome :)\nOh, if only we all had the time and will... I've already resolved my problem (thanks to ddennedy, BTW, for pointing out in right direction).\n\nWe are graceful to the user by supplying a fully supported package that works on most platforms. We provide monthly releases with the latest features. People who use the provided package generally have a good experience.\n\nOK, you are developers, it's your choice (and as a dev I understand you quite well).\n\nHave you inspected the official build script?\n\nOnly now and only a quick glance. It's some different binary from melt, it seems (Qt wrapper?), but I just symlinked /usr/bin/qmelt to /usr/bin/melt and everything works. (BTW, MLT on my machine is also compiled with Qt5, but there is no qmelt anythere).. ",

The underlying problem persists: there's no way to fully pan and zoom around images that are 10,000 x 4,000 pixels in dimension due to the hard-coded UI limits.

    "geekley": "\nIt is by design that shotcut:detail uses absolute path; that is the detail. This is only used for annotation as a tool tip;\n\nHm, OK. But I think, if shotcut:detail is only a tooltip and is always necessarily the absolute path from the resource field, does it have to be serialized in the file? I mean, you could just infer the absolute path at runtime and not save it in the file, right?\nAnd, if that's not the case (if the tooltip can't be inferred) could you at least not regenerate it with every change? Please? Currently it's impossible to manually remove that info from the file, because it's generated again.\n\nit is not used to locate files.\n\nThe reason I'm asking for this is not only portability across computers, but especially privacy (suppose a user might have projects under C:\\Users\\John Doe\\Documents). I believe that, in general, leaking absolute paths of relative files (without the user realizing) is not a good thing to do in any file format, because it can be a privacy issue for some.\nI understand not everyone cares about this and a video editor might not tipically be used collaboratively (in a version control or Google Drive, etc) but it's nice to allow this possibility, right?. > I do not plan to use a dialog; rather, there will be options to copy or move in the New Project view, and then it just happens always for that project.\nSo the users can use the option to have only relative paths, and by using the \"link\" option they can still reference both internal and external resources, right? Sounds great!\nIt could be something like: Import Mode = Copy Files | Move Files | Link to External Path.\nI'd like to suggest placing these copied/moved files in a subfolder, for example, res.\nI would also suggest a small text (in New Project view) explaining that the link option makes the project not portable across computers, or something along these lines.\nAnd if it's a project setting, I assume we would also be able to change it for an existing project as well, somewhere in the UI, like in Settings menu, and changing that would only affect new things you import, not what you already have. Is that correct?. > Relative paths to media assets on the  in the XML should be working for files in the project folder. Provide an example MLT XML file with the problem or the steps to circumvent or break this.\nYesterday I had tried many things to reproduce it, and in the end I think this is what happened to me:\n\nCreate project at folder1/myproj;\n  myproj folder will be created\nPut a resource outside the project folder, for example, folder1/myres.png\nOpen it in Source tab and drag to add it to Timeline and Playlist\nSave and close Shotcut;\n  myproj.mlt will be created with absolute path references\nSuppose the user decided only now to put the resources inside the project folder:\n  Move the file to inside the project folder, for example folder1/myproj/images/myres.png\nReopen the project, it will warn about the missing references\nDouble-click and fix the reference to point to the now relative path;\n  folder1/myproj/myproj - Repaired.mlt will be created;\n  note that the resources are being referenced with an absolute path, despite being relative (probably because the repaired .mlt name is different from the name of the parent folder)\nClose Shotcut;\n  myproj.mlt still contains the invalid paths\nSuppose the user only now noticed the repaired file is different from the original (because there is no popup warning saying that) and decided to delete the original .mlt and rename the repaired file to replace the original; now the original file has the absolute references too\nIf the user moves the project to folder2/myproj, now the references are invalid\n\nMaybe this is not a big problem because, if I had changed anything normally through the UI (before moving to folder2) or used \"Save As...\", the paths would have been fixed automatically. Also, after you move to folder2 you can still fix it again through the UI. And I think the solution of having this import mode (with copy/move/link options) will already make it unlikely to happen now.\nHowever, I still think it's worth also fixing this by changing the repair behavior to something less confusing for the user: instead of saving a myproj - Repaired.mlt file and switching to it, you could just repair the original project without saving it, mark the file as modified and let the user manually save it after they verify everything is correct. So they can still continue to work normally without having to use \"Save As...\" or switch to the original file.\nIf you want to keep the unrepaired file as backup, you can also save that one with a different name like myproj.old.mlt for example, while still keeping the correct file open in the editor.. Oh, I might have been something else too! I did the previous steps (but I used save as... to fix the file, so have a normal file).\nSo I opened the file, dragged the myres.png from playlist to timeline, in front of the existing clip, so leaving a blank space between the previous clip and new clip, and saved.\nNow the project file is using absolute paths in the resource property of all producers (and mixing \\ and / slashes), and even has an absolute path for the \"black\" resource <producer id=\"black\"> like this: absolute\\path\\folder1\\myproj/black..
