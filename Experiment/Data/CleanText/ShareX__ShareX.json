If YOURLS working fine with custom uploader then i'm closing this issue.\n. I tried to make info page for custom uploader not sure is it good enough:\nhttp://getsharex.com/docs/#CustomUploader\n. I can add import/export of selected custom uploader to clipboard. So you can share text of it and peoples can copy it and press import button.

By the way are you know there is annotate image in after capture tasks?\n. Disable quick crop:\n\n. Adding annotation support inside region capture now:\n\n. There is no option to start it automatically.\nIt would be better to write your own script for such things, it will be like 5 lines codes. Loop, take ss, save it, delay.\n. Before open color picker with zoomed view, color picker window hiding. But because your Windows have animations, before hiding complete it taking ss. There is no event for hiding complete. So i must manually add sleep for it. But when peoples don't have animations it will wait for no reason. As a workaround i will add 250ms sleep. (It was 100ms before)\n. It is fixed in #4\n.

You can use these settings for be able to use after capture settings for them:\nhttps://dl.dropbox.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2013/12/VqqhDzXPEc.png\nBecause after capture settings designed to be for capturing only therefore i made using them for other purposes optional. Especially for image file uploads peoples won't like their image files to be modified and when you enable this setting it loads image as bitmap and saving it with your own encoding so png image can become jpeg according to your settings etc.\n. Because you checked \"Create shareable URL\".\n. I tried to reinstall ShareX with latest installer and PersonalPath.cfg is not changed. So latest installer not overrides this file. How may i reproduce this problem?\n. Probably ftp library not supports ftp server or something like that and i can't fix it.

Now i tried to reproduce it and cache file was 2gb+ and gif encoding was taking forever so i give up waiting and closed it. Gif files not supposed to be that big so it can be out of ram while writing to cache file or many other reasons. So as long as you make small gifs it will work fine.

You can try to copy ShareX files to somewhere where your operating system don't restrict access.\n. Yes i'm sure it is your OS. Mainly softwares won't require to write files to where software is installed but it is used in ShareX for portable support because that file need to be near ShareX.exe.

It is intentional feature so you won't lose moment you pressed button. So nothing freezing just showing fullscreen image on borderless window.\n. Having layered window (transparent window) can decrease fps alot and it have zero advantage so not worth making it.\n. Having the screen unfrozen have zero advantage with so many disadvantages and also majority of screen captures softwares for that reason will freeze screen. No option because useless, otherwise I would have added it because I always add much options as possible.\n. When you hover over window or control in region capture mode it will automatically select region of that window or control under cursor. But if it is not frozen then window can move in background that means I need to check thousands of window or control handles and their rectangle regions to be able to real time have hover support and when you think this takes few seconds sometimes, how you think that would work in each frame?\nAlso transparent window (layered window) will get what its behind each paint and draw it and that drawing will be costly and decrease fps alot. When fps is low then dragging rectangle can be less responsive which is not preferable. People won't like lagged crosshair or magnifier movement so high fps is important like in first person shooter games.\nAnd about telling that having not frozen is advantageous, when you want to capture something you need to draw rectangle. But while drawing that rectangle that thing can past and you will lose the moment you wanted. So you want to be able to see things animating behind in real time so you can capture it, which is advantageous for you. Guess what, you can actually see them in real time before press rectangle capture button and only when you want to have moment which you want to capture then you can press hotkey and then be able to capture that exact moment with great precision. So your so called advantage is false. And for last 7 years of development very few people requested that feature, guess why? Because it is useless.\nAnd it is not that easy to have option. It requires coding new screen capture window from scratch and not worth wasting my time for it. But if any of you want to pull request it, then feel free to do it after all you gonna be the one using that feature :)\n. Alright I decided to add it because I'm bored and it become more easier to add than what I expected using \"Rectangle (Light)\" codes and modifying it to use layered window (transparent window). So it gonna look like \"Rectangle (Light)\" capture but background gonna be transparent. So you will lose advantage of default rectangle capture features like hovering on window and controls or multiple region selections etc.\n.

Very frequently i'm taking screenshots from ShareX windows therefore it is intended to not hide automatically with hotkey. You can close ShareX window if you don't want window to appear in screenshots.\n. It is intentional because it is capturing rectangle area from fullscreen screenshot. And it can't differentiate it from normal rectangle region or window rectangle region.\n. If ftp library which ShareX using not supports it then i can't do anything about it. Can't find better free ftp library.\n. ShareX using separate library for sftp. So you can use it.\n. You are using ftps not sftp.\n. You not selected from here maybe https://dl.dropbox.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/04/HcfcPK2PcE.png\n. I don't think this problem to do with ShareX. It can be configuration error in ShareX or sftp server or maybe sftp library problem. I never used sftp before so i don't know which one.\n.

You can add me: ...\n. I can't understand your problem. So what ShareX need to do to solve your problem?\n. Then why you don't use \"@test.example.com/%y-%mo\" for HttpHomePath?\n. I'm not sure why PictureBox in main window failing to load image and giving \"Parameter is not valid\" error.\nCan you reproduce it?\nI tried to upload your image and it shows up correctly in preview so i can't reproduce error.\n. Is it from game?\n. Are you using multi monitor? You not even tell what kind of screen capture it is, crop, active window etc.\n. I don't know how it can fail to capture with one monitor. When rectangle window open is it showing fullscreen screenshot correctly?\n. Did you tried another screen capture software because if it fails too then it is not to do with ShareX.\n. I have no clue how your screenshots black even with only one monitor. Probably something wrong/different in your computer.\n. Updater downloads installer and if you are using portable version then you are not supposed to use installer because it not supports portable installation. This is why portable version is separate zip file.\n. While implementing it if you have any trouble you can contact me in IRC or Steam.\n. I'm not planning to add ftp delete to right click menu because it can be complicated to implement (because it need to support all destinations dynamically, not just FTP). Example I need delete button for Dropbox too but it is too much work to implement therefore can't get it.\n. This is error message when you upload to imageshack:\n{\"success\":false,\"process_time\":16,\"result\":false,\"error\":{\"error_code\":0,\"error_message\":\"Uploading into a free account is not allowed\"}}\nAs you can see they not just removed anonymous upload also now they don't even allow uploading to free accounts. So there is nothing i can do about it.\n. Now i checked and i don't think it is possible to set startup with admin access if you are using startup shortcut or registry as startup way. I mean you can but it will show UAC admin access screen everytime Windows start. So you can't give admin access silently like services.\nI disabled UAC in my Windows but it is some kind of security risk so i can't suggest it to you but it is up to you.\n. I can't know when you are dragging file to show that box.\n. It looks like this: \n. You can't bring it until we upload new version. It is C#.\n. It is permanently there until you right click and close it. You can set hotkey to open it. There is no way to automatically show it when you dragging file from desktop. Position, size, opacity changeable in codes not added them to ui yet.\n. I don't think it will have hit detection when opacity is 0. You can't click through it because you can drag it to move.\n. Now i tried 0 opacity and form have no mouse input, can't drag and drop file to it too.\n. Current settings:\n\n. I'm not sure what is point of adding file to window if not going to upload.\n. I'm not sure what is point of adding file to window if not going to upload.\n. I'm not sure about removing http from url parameter but if i use POST request instead GET it will work fine for you i think?\n. I made it use post request but i can't test it.\n. Reinstalling have nothing to do with this problem. I'm not sure how reinstalling can fix your problem.\n. Would be good if you told which uploader you are using. I think this error can be to do with uploader server. Their API server down or something like that maybe.\n. Changelog exist in web site.\n. Yesterday I added changelog link to update notification window so it will be sufficient:\n\nReason why it is online because it is markdown not plain text.\n. About section already have link to changelog for long time.\n. It is there I can see it. I will make it more obvious.\n. Many softwares make version text clickable which will open changelog.\n. \n. I replaced @ with HttpHomePathAutoAddSubFolderPath. It will work same.\n\n. Is it happens everytime? because i can't reproduce it.\n. Feel free to fix it @McoreD.\nLets see how many years this issue will stay open and you won't even care.\n. Cancel will cancel image editor changes not for cancel uploading.\n. Added it:\n\n. I can't have different destination for gif vs normal image. Don't want to add another destination to make it more complex. If flickr can't show gif correctly then you must contact their support.\n. There is no direct url because it was not possible with Flickr API.\nIf you want direct url support you must contact Flickr for them to add it.\n. It is to do with .NET framework can't load image from clipboard with gif animation so i can't do anything about it but as workaround you can save gif as file and do file upload.\n. It not downloading 1mb gif instantly, it takes time then uploads it.\n. Why you not used screen recorder of ShareX to record screen and instead used gif?\nI can't reproduce your problem, it works fine for us: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/05/20HMHHNoBx.mp4\n. Rainbowed your workaround makes ShareX download non animated gif for no reason too.\nAnd if your intention is download and uploading it then why not use:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/05/97gDCNSFpQ.png\nSo instead click \"copy image\" you must click \"copy image url\" in browser.\n. @SirCmpwn are you have any idea?\n. Even it give error still it manages to upload file so this can mean file exist check failing then uploading after that.\nThe remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found.\nResponse:\n{\n\"error\": 404\n}\nbut still not sure because 3 different requests happening while uploading, checking flie, uploading file, then waiting processing to get url. But if last two fail then i don't think he will be able to get url at all.\n. There was server side issue and SirCmpwn fixed it. It should work fine now.\n. In UploadersConfig.json file remove this lines:\n\"PushbulletSettings\": {\n    \"UserAPIKey\": \"\",\n    \"DeviceList\": [\n      {\n        \"Key\": \"\",\n        \"Name\": \"Chrome\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"SelectedDevice\": 0\n  },\nfor be able to open destination settings window.\nI will check how settings set wrongly in config.\n. When you pressed get device list, server must be returned invalid info and that caused problem. Checking validity of returned device info but name was not checked and it was empty. Not sure how server returned empty device name.\nNow is it still giving error when you press get device list button?\n. So it works fine now or still not works?\n. So it works fine now or still not works?\n. So your response you pasted from successfull response or not if it is successful response then i can't figure out what is wrong.\n.

Because i have UAC enabled too and still hotkeys work. But problem can't be to do with ShareX because Windows API handling hotkey stuff so if it works in some apps but not others then it is definitely to do with Windows. You must be wondering then how other apps hotkey systems works everywhere then, because there is two common hotkey method first one is http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646309%28v=vs.85%29.aspx which ShareX using and other one is global keyboard hook. We were using global keyboard hook before but it was causing issues like random unhooking happens etc. and this current method working more solid.\n. I sent email to minus one year ago about it:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/05/nNlGFrWfkl.png\nand still new API not released. So i can't do anything about it.\n.

Fixing this can be problem because i was using UTF8 everywhere in codes.\nI don't see why other encodings gonna be needed because UTF8 supports all unicode characters and it is like standard and used everywhere.\n. It is weird because i used Bitdefender Internet Security 3 weeks ago and it was not blocking ShareX.\n. I installed Bitdefender internet security now and set firewall security to \"Normal\" it was \"Permissive\" by default. And still it not blocked ShareX.\n. Were you using ShareX before or first time opening it?\n. ShareX trying to load ShareXmod settings and failing i think.

Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable 32 bit / 64 bit required for be able to register that DLL. Can you install these and reinstall ShareX?\n\"Unable to connect to the remote server\" there is 2 common reason for this to happen, first one is your firewall can be blocking it or something else in your PC, second is host can be not responding like it is in maintenance or down.\n. Would you like to try new installer which gonna install c++ redist and .net automatically.\n. Edit: Removed beta link because not necessary anymore.\n.

Are you aware how much insane that gif size gonna be?\nIt can be 100x more bigger than video recording.\nExample i recorded 4 minutes 20 fps video one hour ago with ShareX and its size was 5mb.\nSo i don't know reason of why gif recording failed but it happens when gif size is extremely big and you are supposed to use video recording for such stuff. Not just gif quality is bad (256 colors per pixel) and file sizes extremly big also you make peoples use far more bandwidth for be able to view it.\n. I recorded 26mb 30 fps gif now and can't reproduce error :(\n. Okey i did 30 fps fullscreen long gif recording and uncompressed file size was 9gb (see how insane it is) and error happened. So when encoding it to gif int overflow happens because max int can store is (2,147,483,647) which is 2gb and it becomes negative number after exceed it then error happens. So i needed to use long type (max size is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807). But i never thought someone would record that big gif file.\nIf you wondering what is that 9gb file, ShareX storing frames as bitmap to single file and after record ends encoding them to gif. Because encoding to gif not fast process therefore it needed to happen after screen recording ends, can't do it real time.\n. I can't even read location bigger than 2gb because .NET functions using int too instead long :(\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/system.io.stream.read\n. I'm planning to stop recording if file reach 2gb and suggest using screen recording.\n. Which image you drag and drop? Because i can't reproduce it.\n. I drag and drop it and it uploaded to image host?\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/05/omPpR7MfzR.mp4\n. What that google url came from? How drag and drop image can make that google url? Is there a possibility for such thing?\n. I see you drag and drop links to ShareX not images. In web page that images you drag and drop have urls on them so you actually dragging urls not images. So it is not ShareX fault.\n. Right click image, open image, then drag and drop it.\nAlso you can use https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/05/YaJzxOhegG.png\nwhich can download from image url and re upload it.\n. Drag and drop window supports only file, i must do it same like main window. You could drag and drop that image to main window right?\nThat setting i showed in previous message is for clipboard upload by the way.\n. Now i tried you are right even when i drag and drop proper image still clipboard image check fails and text check success so it uploading that text data.\nI tried to drag and drop that image to Paint, Paint.NET, IrfanView none of them be able to load that image too, so chrome actually only drags image url and its not ShareX fault.\n. DLL error happens if C++ redist 2010 not installed.\nHotkey error can happens if another software already registered that hotkey and can't do anything about it because Windows API not allows.\nI added auto C++ redist downloader to latest setup if you wanna test:\nEdit: Removed beta link because not necessary anymore.\n. Thank you :)\n. If ShareX not forgetting your username/password then it can't forget login info too.\nSo if it still require login then it can be to do with tinypic i guess.\n. Did you tried this https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/06/3pjnjL5om2.png ?\n. It already using Octree Quantizer: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/HelpersLib/GIF/OctreeQuantizer.cs\nbut its algorithm not good enough i guess.\n. Unfortunately it happens when audio recording enabled too for me.\n. I figured why it happens. Need to remove input fps command.\nIn here it was telling to use input fps therefore i was added it:\nhttps://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free\n\"Then to save cpu, a \"good\" application will also instruct the \"source fps\" to be 10 fps\n$ ffmpeg -r 10 -f dshow -i video=video-capture-recorder -r 10 yo.mp4 # input and output are set to 10\"\nBut adding input fps causing fast video if frames drop.\nWithout input fps now it don't have fast video problem but still have problem about frame drops but it is because encoding using too much cpu to encode frames and can't keep up. Increasing buffer size on start helps but it quickly filling so not solving problem.\nSo for be able to solve frame drops need to decrease compression.\nExample i tried this loseless recording:\nffmpeg -rtbufsize 10000k -f dshow -i video=\"screen-capture-recorder\":audio=\"virtual-audio-capturer\" -c:v libx264 -r 30 -crf 0 -preset fast -tune zerolatency -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a libvo_aacenc -ac 2 -b:a 128k -y \"output.mp4\"\nIt was barely dropping frames and result was pretty good. But i was testing very cpu heavy game so for non gaming recordings better compression can work fine.\nAnd for record games need to use decent software which can do directx/opengl capture anyway. Which i can't manage to do.\nTLDR: -r 30 in beginning of commands causing fast video problem. But frame drops still exist and need to modify encoding settings for get better performance while doing real time encoding. But you can't remove -r 30 yourself in command because it is automatically added by ShareX.\n. Very rarely i can reproduce it and it feels like it is bug in PictureBox. It happens because using animated gif in preview box when loading actual image and this issue happens sometimes. Last it happened to me very long months ago so it is very difficult for me to fix this even if it is fixable, because i can't know am i fixed it.\n. Okey finally I'm figured out what is wrong i think. Before loading new image, ShareX clearing old image but if error happened before then picture box set error image as picture box image and if ShareX clear that error image then while loading new image error happens. It is kinda picture box fault to set error image like normal image and not allow clearing it. So before clear image i must do checks is it error image now.\nThanks for good report @PatchyKnowly that reproduce steps helped me to find what is wrong. But i'm still not sure was webfreak problems was to do with this too.\n. If you wanna test it: \nBecause i did few changes to picture box not sure is it solid enough.\nEdit: Removed beta link because not necessary anymore.\n. UI won't work with Mono and will require to make entire UI from scratch using multi platform UI library also ShareX heavily rely on Windows functions (PInvoke) and can be extremely difficult to port.\n. We can't fill GitHub releases section with dev builds because peoples will download latest one from there also it will broken our auto updater and web site download counter too.\n. Probably AppVeyor using git to get source and compile it but our git don't have api keys because of not allowed to share public by api owners. So AppVeyor can't compile proper versions.\nBut if you come and request latest version in IRC i can compile it in one minute. If i'm in IRC channel.\n. @jhbruhn managed to handle using proper api keys in AppVeyor: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ShareX/sharex\nSetup and portable builds created automatically there.\n. 125% DPI: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/06/Me1q3qvbt5.png\n150% DPI: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/06/KCOMXvr4JS.png\nI can't reproduce your problem in Windows 7.

I'm not using Windows 8.1 and don't have multi montor. When i tried DPI settings in Windows 7 it was working fine, so i can't fix it without be able to reproduce it.

Maybe this is the reason why its broken in ShareX?\n. @hypereddie I can't find how to set different dpi setting per monitor, where is that setting?\n. That link not shows it.\n. It have only one dpi setting how to select different dpi for other monitor then.\n. Thanks!\n. Why you opened same issue in two different place, i was going to reply to your issue in other place you opened it.\n. I'm receiving email when you post issue there too but i was eating food when i see email popup so couldn't reply to it instantly. We can continue in here.\n. quote:\n\nI believe I can give you steady reproduction steps:\n1. Grab http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/\n2. Right click any process, and click \"Properties\"\n3. Try to take a window screenshot of the main window or the child window. It'll have this  issue 100 % of times.\nThis appears to occur 100% of the time in any application that has a dialog currently open.\nex: http://i.imgur.com/YYZTNuT.png\n\nI believe this 100% reproduceable issue is different issue than other less reproduceable transparency issue.\nIf ShareX not run as admin you can't capture transparent other window which its process run as admin. Reason is http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633545(v=vs.85).aspx call fails when hWndInsertAfter handle is from window which its process run as admin.\nWe can test this case with two way. First way is you can check debug log is it have this message: \"Transparent capture failed. Reason: SetWindowPos fail.\"\nAnd another way is running ShareX as admin and retaking active window capture.\nLess reproduceable case happens when timing of background white and black forms not match. Because Windows not allow to capture transparent ss, all apps i see using this tricks to get transparent capture which involving opening white and black windows behind that window and calculating colors to find alpha values. But when this windows not open or render in time this issue happens i think but still not sure because it very rarely fails for me. And i'm unable to find solution to it.\nquote:\n\nAnother really funny example http://i.imgur.com/kyXVKcJ.png\n\nThis issues cause is again timing. When making white and black window behind this about window, have animation which moving inside about window and ShareX doing image difference check for make sure transparency math calculations not fails but because first and last ss have different pixels because of animations, it canceling this process instead using normal ss so you won't have failed transparent image.\n. Some windows can have transparent pixels in client area too therefore can't do it.\n. And all these calculations can slow down capturing alot.\n. I tried to select multiple files and upload them and it was in correct order. And also need to select this https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/06/0wxNnxw40R.png so it will upload in correct order.\n. After some testing. It is in correct order if you drag and drop first selected file. And rectangle drag is matters. So there is no bug to fix.\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/06/wWMMoWGDEm.mp4\n. You must check \"File uploader\". In next release i made it when you check Dropbox, File uploader will be automatically checked.\n. I don't see you checked \"File uploader\" in your screenshot.\n. \"screen capture recorder\" is open source DirectShow device: https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free\nIt is required for ShareX screen recording to work with FFmpeg. If you uninstall ShareX that device will be automatically uninstalled too.\nIf you want to manually disable it then i recorded video showing how to do it: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/06/wSvFtlk601.mp4\nUsing ffmpeg command in video for show is it uninstalled successfully. You don't need to use that command.\nSo basically you need to call regsvr32 /u \"device dll path\" but cmd must be ran as admin.\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n. For games you should use screen recorder which is capable of doing directx/opengl capture like ShadowPlay. ShareX screen recording more suitable for desktop capture and fast sharing because doing real time compression therefore file sizes low but also using too much cpu while doing real time encoding so not very suitable for game recording. When i was using ShadowPlay its performance was great but also need to compress them for be able to upload somewhere.\n. I think error happens when trying to get list of folder names. Are your folder names have any special character?\n. #769\n. This error can happen if .NET Framework 4.0 is missing.\n. Uninstall ShareX, try reinstalling maybe.\n. I don't think i can support it. First of all our installer not supports portable installation and i create portable zip file myself therefore. And updater downloading and running installer for update ShareX therefore updating portable version is problem. Also knowing is it portable is another problem, if ShareX folder is exist in same folder of ShareX.exe then it is portable but also you can do this with normal installed ShareX too so even it is portable still it would be installed with installer so auto updating can work fine so i can't differentiate that. Also installing portable files manually will require another exe because while ShareX running it can't replace files. So i'm not planning to do it currently because can require too much work.\n. Reason is default .NET clipboard image copy method not supports transparency. But you can use alternative method which copying png to clipboard: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/06/ShareX_nImuwQKRoB.png so transparency will be preserved.\n. I showed you?\n. When you get GetAccountInfo failed error can you check debug log for full error message.\nUpload fails because login not successful i think.\n. It is easy compared to other issues.\n. Yes it will be added.\nI tried to open copy.com auth page and it gave:\nWe\u2019re experiencing technical difficulties...\nWe\u2019re very sorry. Support has been notified. Click here to go home.\nSo maybe problem to do with copy.com?\n. Make new hotkey and override upload settings of it: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/06/75DrAveCO1.png\nAnd disable this setting in default task settings, so it will only work with hotkey.\n. It is clipboard upload hotkey.\n. Check here: \n\n. Are you have these selected? http://i.imgur.com/FrbJVC1.png\nSome softwares have massive amount of control handles and trying to get region of them takes long time.\n. If window or control capture is not enabled for rectangle capture then i have no idea how it can slow down minute. Is it happens in first open or every open?\n. That 100ms wait time happens only first time and depends on computer too. It can be because CIL compiles screen capture library in first access i think. Well that first time open slow down is definitely to do with .NET because second opens faster than first open and i not cached anything. And if your PC heavily in use that first open can take more time than 100ms.\n. Can you try to set hotkey for \"Rectangle (Light)\"\n\nand see is it opens faster?\n. I tested %y/%mo/%d now and it created folder like this when i try to upload screenshot:\n\n2014-07-01 18:26:27.293 - Upload started. Filename: ShareX_LhP5XowYXl.png, Filepath: E:\\ShareX\\Screenshots\\2014-07\\ShareX_LhP5XowYXl.png\n2014-07-01 18:26:34.818 - FTP directory created: /2014\n2014-07-01 18:26:36.072 - FTP directory created: /2014/07\n2014-07-01 18:26:37.325 - FTP directory created: /2014/07/01\n2014-07-01 18:26:41.140 - Task completed.

Because error check is changed too. If error happens while uploading then checking error code and if it is 553 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FTP_server_return_codes) then trying to create directory. Maybe your ftp server giving different error code for this and therefore ShareX not creating folder.\n. Would you try this setup file, because i can't see error code in console logs and i must write it to console. Because ShareX checking error code and creating directory and i must see what is error code in your test.\nEdit: Removed beta link because not necessary anymore.\n. It must be fixed now, can you test: \nEdit: Removed beta link because not necessary anymore.\n. Yes it will update because i not changed version number.\n. Yes it will update because i not changed version number.\n. You don't even tell which capture method you using to take screenshot.\nBut i believe you trying to take screenshot from game and ShareX not supports directx/opengl capture.\n. Are you have multi monitor?\n. It not make sense showing black screen even with single monitor. Something must be different in your computer.\n. Is fullscreen capture works fine?\n. Your issue must be similar to #617\n. It would be difficult for me to implement it because need to host local server etc. for be able to test it. Also i'm not exactly sure how ownCloud works.\n. I can't find upload method in here, Create a new Share not contains file field.\nAm i need to search it in here? This is extremly long it can take days for me to read it.\n. Document here http://doc.owncloud.org/server/7.0/developer_manual/core/ocs-share-api.html lacks greatly i don't know how to implement it. Both login system and uploading.\n. I tried using custom uploader in http://demo.owncloud.org/ using test:test@ but still it was giving authorization error:\n\nNow i will try to set username/password in headers without use custom uploader.\nAlso i'm not sure is file form name is \"file\" or not because documentation not mentions it.\n.

Thanks for your efforts too.\n. That doesn't matter, that changes in commit still gonna be in history and waste time/bandwidth when pulling everything to local for no reason because your changes even have images etc. in first commit.\nExample every single file showing it was committed in your commit as you can see in here:\n\n.

Background is completely white as you can see in color picker: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/07/plOXxrkpId.png\nWhat you mean it appears grey?\n. In video player it is white too: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/07/QpSXhhAxGL.png\n. Can you update again and check is it fixed in 9.2.1 because i can't reproduce it.\n. It should be in right click menu of list i think not preview.\n. fixed by @DevAtHome\n. It would be easier for you if you contacted me from IRC or messenger while implementing it, so you could ask questions when you couldn't find something.\nI don't know what is DI and factories. Destination settings in this file: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/UploadersLib/UploadersConfig.cs I'm not sure what is really messy in that.\nLook like you already did hard part and only easy part which is config/ui remained?\n. I'm not sure what kind of refactoring can happen. You must have seen ZScreen (old version of ShareX) codes 5 years ago, it was like maze :D So code is far more clean compared to old times. But still it is difficult for peoples to find somethings in codes who is not familiar with project ofc.\n. I'm trying to make guide for creating uploader in wiki now: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/wiki/Code-contribution It is not completed yet.\n. Icon will look bad there.\n. ShareX is single instance.\n. Thanks.\n. It is exist: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/wiki/Region%20screen%20capture\n. What you mean \"another confirm thing in the after capture tasks menu\" ?\n. This is doing what you want: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/07/ShareX_TwGxwlTb5L.png\nAlso this is doing what you want too: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/07/ShareX_VBSvIslgyX.png\n??\n. I don't think FFmpeg supports that, when i try two audio sources it ignores second audio source.\n. Starting new video file and merging them is very ugly workaround.\n. I'm not planning to add new features to image editor because then my efforts will go waste when needed to merge changes from newest version of Greenshot image editor.\n. Thanks! I was aware of race condition and couldn't fix it and can't find better alternative too. I was not used visual basic solution because it was not looked right to me to use visual basic dll from c# but if it works properly then its okey.\n. @michalx2 There was this code before Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false); but now i can't use it in WindowsFormsApplicationBase because it is read only and therefore texts overlapping controls:\n\nAny idea how to fix it?\n. Because if you not do active window capture there won't be title and there can't be empty folder name too so it is intended.\n. Normal file saving have two file naming field one for active window and other for rest. I don't wanted to add two path for sub folder pattern too because using title on folder is not very convenient.\n. It is already exists.\n. Oh i thought we needed to override http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/microsoft.visualbasic.applicationservices.windowsformsapplicationbase.usecompatibletextrendering(v=vs.90)\n. Someone was reported same thing too and it was to do with monitor DPI setting. Coordinates looks wrong but i'm not sure how it is possible.\n. Okey i figured why your error happens. Encoding require width and height to be even number therefore if your selection width is 5 and height is 7 then it becomes 6 and 8 to be even number but if you are close to monitor bounds then it becomes out of bounds. I didn't noticed this problem before because it works fine with \"screen-capture-recorder\" even with bad coordinates. So for make numbers even i will instead decrease them by 1 not increase.\n. It only happened when your selection touches monitor bounds right?\n. I marked it as fixed. If you need i can upload compiled setup file.\n. Edit: Removed beta link because not necessary anymore.\n. FFmpeg doing all encoding. So it is problem in your video player codec or FFmpeg which means nothing to do with ShareX.\n. I wanted to add it but FFmpeg was not supporting pause.\n. I don't set position of tray menu manually. .NET itself decides where to open it. And i don't have multi monitor to test it too.\n. It looked like to me Imgur problem not ShareX?\n. They not using this api in their web site.\n. Because .NET key events not see Windows key as modifier therefore i can't make hotkey setting ui which can detect it as modifier. But in hotkey system actually i added it as separate setting which you can see in HotkeysConfig.json file:\n\"HotkeyInfo\": {\n    \"Hotkey\": \"PrintScreen, Alt\",\n    \"Win\": false\n  },\nSo you can make \"Win\" true from config file.\n. I'm adding workaround now for Win modifier support. Pressing Windows key will add Win modifier and re pressing it will  remove Win modifier. So instead of holding it, you will just press Windows key once to add it and then press any other hotkey you want:\n\nIn here I pressed \"Windows\" key once and then hold Ctrl + Shift + Alt and press Print Screen.\nSo atleast this workaround gonna be better than requiring to edit config file :)\nAnd ofc using hotkey will work properly without requiring this workaround, it is just for setting it in UI.\n.

I don't know how to make it and I don't think it adds any security at all.\n. I don't even have SFTP account while implementing SFTP therefore couldn't test anything. So it will be impossible for me to add such thing. So this never gonna be implemented.\n. Be able to set different name for uploading not exist in ShareX and i'm not planning it.\n. Doing that would be too complex.\n. Adding multiple files using api is 1 min job. Handling multiple tasks as one task and redirecting all of them to same task is big deal and can require week of work to completely change many things for be able to support it. Because other uploaders don't support getting multiple files to same uploader and because of inheritation all using same methods. Not to mention how to know is one people wants separate gist or all in same gist.\n. I added \"None\" to video source so you can record sound from your computer or microphone and save it as mp3 file.\n\n. Sorry I don't prefer to use dlls for uploaders. This why only FTP using library in ShareX and i made other uploaders myself or got them with pull request.\n. I'm not planning to add SFV check tool.\n. If you selected Google Drive (or your choice of private ones) then Imgur will be disabled.\n. Currently i'm not planning to add \"Start\" and \"Abort\" buttons because it require too much work and not worth. You can use \"Start delay\" setting which can give you enough time after select region.\n. If installer can't register that dll then you can't record audio. C++ redist 2010 required for be able to register that dll or you have admin permission problem etc.\n. If i could do it easily i would. Gfycat uploader in ShareX takes bytes as parameter and uploads it. So uploader don't know length of video therefore can't stop it.\n. @michalx2 was implemented it, maybe he will know solution. Because even if internet connection is blocked still ShareX must open.\nEdit:\n@michalx2 maybe we should have used that old method and trying to find solution to that race condition problem. Because we were not expecting this .NET way to have this much problems and it is worrying me that people having issues which we can't solve.\n. Single instance is easy, communicating with other instances is problem to transfer arguments. I'm trying to figure out how to use IPC to transfer arguments without cause race condition currently but it is too complex and can't manage to fix it.\n. In theory it just requires localhost so it is not supposed to be problem but for people who using firewall will have allow or deny buttons which firewall asking and many people can't create custom rule to be able to allow local connection and not allow outside connection. And because you just showing \"Couldn't launch the application.\" now people won't even know why ShareX not opens. Some people blocks ShareX access to internet and using it as just screenshot application so by mistake they can't upload anything to internet. In old implementation if error happens then app was still opening. So question here is, is it worth to cause ShareX to not open in someone people compared to before when there is multiple uploads there is slight chance it can upload same file two times because of race condition and it is workaround able using File upload, Clipboard upload etc. I was planning to release bug fix release today but I'm worrying about this now because when error happen in single instance codes then ShareX never opens and showing msg box is actually worse than showing error window because atleast in error window it becomes understandable what was caused this problem but in msg box it is not obvious why it is unable to launch :(\nSo I would like to return to old method because multiple file upload failing from context menu is less problematic then not be able to open ShareX at all in some people computer but I don't want to waste your efforts too, so I'm not sure what to do. I appreciate your efforts and thanks for responding quickly.\n. Sorry I reverted your codes which took 45 minutes work for me to manually revert and test everything. But I believe this old single instance system more solid than using that .NET class because I have more control on it.\n. Why ImageFileDestination need to be nullable if it was already remembering its destination when you reselect file destination which means it holds real file destination always then what is point of making it null?\n. Yes you can create new one.\n. I was thinked it before, using this script 3D image/video preview: https://alanedwardes.com/i/2014-07-04-0N6a6H.mp4\nBut then if I make it default setting then many people will hate ShareX because they won't know it is possible to disable and it is more ugly solution than watermark imo.\nI also thought maybe I should make this watermark default: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/09/ShareX_gcvmbn0QY7.png\nBut then again many people won't know it is image effect and possible to disable and they will stop using ShareX. Maybe I should make it default. It not blocking screenshot area because of canvas: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/09/ShareX_cdeRv96izX.png\n. joxi uploading to their host it is very logical it to use page, you can't see anywhere that app uploading to imgur but still embedding it to one site.\nhttp://getsharex.com/preview?https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/09/ShareX_8ckce6eBg9.png this url ugly because very long.\nI'm pretty sure everybody will hate this website solution including me but watermark is not that bad:\n\nSo I will make it default now. You think watermark type is good?\n. Is it possible wrong ftp account is selected in top of ftp account settings (image, text, file) because it tells server text is empty.\n. I'm not planning to add filtering to main window.\nI added \"Ends with\" file name filter that way you can filter by extension like this:\n\n. You need to press space in screen selection tool to capture whole screen.\n. Tip already exist here: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/wiki/Region%20screen%20capture\nI can't write all of these on screen obviously.\nAlso new version have screen record last region hotkey now so if you do fullscreen one time, then you can use that hotkey to always do fullscreen without region selection.\n.

That text will be very ugly.\n. That text will be very ugly.\n. LeBaux normal region capture shows this info so why you needed to google search?\n. I don't understand why you use command line. When ShareX have powerful hotkey system.\n. You don't need to remember all hotkeys. All hotkeys are added to workflows menu so you can just use mouse to open them or check them. How you remember that command line shortcuts?\n. I didn't told I like using mouse.\n. Updated it.\n. I tried to show much feature as possible in one screenshot. So people can know what ShareX is capable of without requiring to download. ShareX can do all of these with one hotkey press but ShareX never designed to be simple app, it is advanced app but sharing require only one hotkey press so that slogan still correct.\n. https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/InnoSetup/Scripts/products/vcredist2010.iss in here it checks registry and I don't know why this registry not exist in your pc if it is already installed.\n. You checking registry from Windows run -> Regedit\nBut I don't think you can find solution.\n. Another workaround is uninstalling your c++ redist and letting ShareX install it properly.\n. I added it.\n. It require directx/opengl capture and not exists in ShareX and in majority of screen capture softwares.\n. In #249 problem was not 260 characters limit but needed to URL decode before download it.\nYou should use same tab spacing rule as project otherwise it will look bad like this:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/09/VIZoScqg5U.png\nAlso you using different new line rule too i think which makes finding differences difficult:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/09/yiEFt7f3t1.png\nI tried fixing it while merging but whenever I try Windows or Unix line ending still whole file was showing changed so i give up.\n. I don't know how to do that, it would be extreme amount of work because I constantly adding new things.\n. Are you thinking it is that easy. Every control aligned according to english text length so if you use another language then majority of controls labels will overlap other controls. So whole UI need to be changed. Also there is many texts dynamically setting inside codes too. And everytime before release I must wait for translators to change new texts which gonna delay release months.\n. Now I learned that .NET language support also can store position/size of controls in resource file automatically so it makes possible to have language support in ShareX easily. And my friend translating ShareX to Turkish currently. So I'm gonna need to find translators.\n. I don't add non english uploaders to ShareX.\n. Maybe your hotkey set to different destination than your default destination. Also Image and File destinations can have different File destination.\n. You then enabled fallback setting when google drive fails it tries dropbox? There should be one setting wrong for sure.\n. Problem is not uploading file but test file upload is problem because it using image file uploader look like.\n. It never happened to me and that error can be anything random so not sure cause of it.\n. I'm not using FTP therefore not noticed it before but when checking for #329 I noticed there is bug:\n\nAdds HttpHomePath two times.\n. Unfortunately I don't like using \"var\" :(\nMainly because of consistency with rest of project.\nAnd also I don't think using \"var\" speeds up my coding speed because it is like 1 second difference compared to writing full variable name and also when you write full variable name when doing \"new \" it shows class name automatically so it is actually faster to use full variable name:\n\n. What was file type you uploaded. It happens when unrecognized file mime type detected I think.\n. I need to find list of supported mime types for Google drive because it don't supports majority of it.\nWhy it don't accept not supported ones as generic file I don't get it. It is like bug in their side.\n. Pull request of Kesmy #586 fixed this problem I think. I tried few extensions which was not working before and all of them was working.\n. Game can handle key and not let other applications take input. So I can't do anything.\n. When error happen while uploading it is not supposed to exit program. And if problem is to do with SFTP then i can't do anything about it because i not wrote SFTP library and don't know much about it and never used it too. But people was telling SFTP works fine otherwise there would be tons of issue reports.\n. If i knew i would have fixed it. About sftp problem, that auth method you using not supported by library maybe?\n. ShareX not using %appdata% only Documents. So in which version it was working fine? Did you tried installing old version and checking is it working?\n. I tried 150% DPI and rectangle capture + fullscreen capture both works fine: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/09/H866XRwkt3.png\nSo without be able to reproduce it i can't fix it because i don't know what is wrong.\n. Are you using Windows 8.1 and its per monitor DPI setting?\n. Duplicate of #165\n. We talked in IRC it is not solveable, workaround is using: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/10/TPEwfqmbat.png\n. You can download portable: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/10/KtrRyfcji4.png\n. It is actually exist in system tray too. It don't have timer just showing icon and when you click it, it will stop recording. Showing timer on top also will be bad when you dragging rectangle from left top to bottom right which is more high likely i think.\n. I tried it but they using cookies for login info therefore it won't work with custom uploader. They should have API for login info.\n. I not saw API URL because it is requiring login.\n. Added it: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/wiki/Custom-Uploader-examples#coinurlcom\n. In here:\n\n. Reason why I didn't add deletion support in history window is to not risk corrupting xml file. Because deleting entry require reading whole xml, parsing it, deleting single entry, re saving whole thing as xml. And while this happening if something go wrong then corruption can happen and you can lose your whole history. People have +7 years of history and I didn't want to have even slightest possibility of people losing it. Because electric lose or pc crash can happen.\n. Someone was reported it before too and it is very rare issue which we can't reproduce. It is to do with color profiles I think so to do with your computer. It applying color matrix to make more darker and lighter background but in your computer that color matrix inversing colors and I have no idea why.\nTry Rectangle (Light) it don't have this.\n. I can't fix something which i can't reproduce. And 99.99% > of people don't have this issue too. So I don't know what is wrong in your pc.\nColor matrix causing that issue but not in our computer. It is required for quick darkening non selection area and lightening selection area.\nObject allows you to hover part of windows.\n. I already merged Greenshot latest version changes in ShareX 9.4.0\n. You should tell these to Greenshot devs because I'm not planning to do big changes to its core otherwise makes merging too difficult.\n. I already merged Greenshot latest version changes in ShareX 9.4.0\n. It is for Inno setup .NET downloader script. So it is completely useless.\n. It is supposed to upload only one file. Multiple selection is required for be able to copy multiple URL.\n. Use hotkey for take screenshots.\n. Middle click tray icon.\n. Fixing something which I can't reproduce not easy.\nI got another workaround for you!\n\nUse this setting to add 0.5 sec delay to capture, so menu will close in that time.\n. Making customize able tray menu will require so much work and I'm not planning to do it. You can use hotkeys if you want to capture screenshots quickly.\n. I'm working alone currently and not planning to add customize able tray menu which is too much work like I said before.\n. I'm working alone currently and not planning to add customize able tray menu which is too much work like I said before.\n. I was opened thread in Twitter support but nobody responded about it. Don't know how to solve it.\n. I was asked here: https://twittercommunity.com/t/animated-gif-problem-in-update-with-media/13144\nIt must be to do with headers because uploading animated GIF not made by ShareX works.\n. I'm not planning to add mail reading.\n. I'm worrying having KeepAlive = true can cause more issues than solving because your issue never happened to me. There is possibility I made it \"false\" on purpose but can't remember now. I think it was causing issues when doing multiple uploads? But I will test and see.\n. Uncheck this:\n\n. It should be like this right?\n\n. Thanks.\n. @SolidX do you know why PreviewHttpPath have 80 port when BrowserProtocol is https.\n\nBut when it is http then it don't have any port in path. Was this problem exist before too or your changes caused it?\n. You can add fake shadow using Image Effects section.\n. It not showing default setting there, showing there custom task setting which you have when you created that hotkey.\n. I created new hotkey like this:\n\nIt worked fine. There must be another setting different in your app.\nBut how when image clipboard upload is not working but text clipboard upload works is I don't get too. Both must be not working.\nIs this setting checked for you? \nDid you make sure after capture tasks upload setting is checked both in default and hotkey?\nAs a last resort you can upload your settings config file to me and then I can easily reproduce it.\n. After capture affects upload image from clipboard for give more option to you, more possibilities.\nAnd it is optional you can even disable that.\n. Sorry but your suggestion \"After keypress\" far more misleading because these can happen without even press any key.\nAnd about that task settings behavior is very complex situation and have advantages disadvantages, like it remembers your custom task settings state there otherwise everytime you uncheck/check setting then whole tab/settings there can reset settings to default and can cause problems.\n. None of the apps register theirself as admin like this.\n. It won't be possible.\n. https://pomf.se/ not opens.\n. Look like Bitdefender Scan SSL feature blocks it.

If they want high fps and fullscreen then they are supposed to use FFmpeg not GIF so it is right choice what I did.\nAbout screen capture limit it takes screen captures to make videos (nearly all desktop capture softwares doing same thing) and capturing 60 fps reliably not possible even with good computers and frame drops happens alot. People tend to use max fps as possible and having 60 fps makes bad result than 30 fps. Even keeping 30 fps very difficult when there is game open. Not to mention doing real time FFmpeg encoding also very heavy processing.\nSo that limits required. Also you can bypass FFmpeg fps limit using custom commands. So people knows what he doing won't have any limit.\n. I limited GIF FPS because majority of people keep trying fullscreen 30 fps gif recordings which makes GBs of files...

So people knows what he doing won't have any limit.\n. There is so many reasons I not wrote there. Example in gif there is currently bug to do with int overflow because I'm using memory stream for cache to encoding interaction and position can't use \"long\" in memory stream position therefore if cache become more than 3gb then problem happens and I can't bother fixing it because if someone have that huge cache then they are not supposed to do gif recording anyway. And people keep reporting me their gif was giving error because of this problem. And guess what all of them was doing 30 fps fullscreen recording.\nAnd another reason is better encoding which is 8 bit quantizer for gif is so slow when doing 30 fps recording it can take forever to encode.\nAnd most importantly I want to force people to use FFmpeg if they want to capture something big because size can be extremly (like 30x when not much moving in screen) lower than gif in FFmpeg so it is wasting bandwidth of everybody.\nAbout screen recording I have good computer and I can't do recording more than 30 fps with stable no frame drops. Unless you using over clocked 5.0ghz cpu it is worthless to have 60 fps. ShareX not good enough for very high fps screen recording. Not to mention 30 fps is more than enough for desktop recording. And if you want to record games you need to use proper directx/opengl recorder anyway.\nThere is many reasons i'm lazy to write here. So I had proper reasons to limit them.\nOh by the way I'm pretty sure very high percentage of people would use what is maximum fps exist in software. Nobody will bother doing 30 fps when there is 60 fps and then come here blame ShareX can't capture properly it keep lagging etc.\n. There is so many reasons I not wrote there.

Nobody will bother doing 30 fps when there is 60 fps and then come here blame ShareX can't capture properly it keep lagging etc.\n. You can still record 60 fps, just need to use FFmpeg custom commands checkbox and replacing fps section:\n\n. Majority of desktop video recorders taking screen capture and adding it as frame. But for some reason Windows causing stuttering when 60 screen capture happen per second. When you disable Aero it becomes fine. For that reason I was disabled 60 fps capture because it was causing unintended stuttering in Windows rendering system. Also in VCM writing to hard disk was couldn't keep up with 60 fps because it saving uncompressed AVI and some bitmap operations was required (changing bit format is not fast enough in C#) when saving it as AVI frame therefore FFmpeg is faster and I don't recommend VCM. So my computer is good too and I would love to have 60 fps recording too but even with good computer it couldn't keep up.\n. VCM was experimental stuff and I was planning to remove it. Doing screen recording stuff with C# can't be fast enough (compared to C++) and I didn't saw single screen recording app made with C# which is capable of doing 60 fps recording. Example even http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html which is made with C# using C++ things in background to do screen recording. And FFmpeg allows you to select whatever FPS you want using custom commands. I think you should use proper OpenGL/DirectX capture software which can record 60 fps easily and then upload it with ShareX. Because my knowledge not enough to make better screen recorder unfortunately :( Sorry.\n. Output file name extension supposed to be just extension this is why it not works for you. Like \".jpg\".\nIt was handling not having \".\" in beginning of string too but now if I support string like yours then I can't fix extensions without dot. So it is not bug, it works intended.\nEdit: But I guess i will check if extension contains any dot if not then adding it, that way your string can work with auto dot support too.\n. There is no such thing as GIFV format it is just MP4.\n. Are you have this selected?\n\n. Then your hotkey settings overrides After upload tasks.\n. I thought it would be more complex to calculate:\nif (x + magnifier.Width > currentScreenRect0Based.Right)\nIf magnifier can show up in right monitor then is it good idea to move it left?\nIs this what @Fire- was wanting?\n. It is already fixed.\n. I don't know Java or C objective.\n. I can't accept it because of language translation trying to not add any new controls until release, so I can release.\n. I will turn them to radio box after release.\n. Resources system of .NET causing this issue, I think there is bug in that system. Can't figure out how to fix it currently :(\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/11/FT7AagUf2n.png\nAs you can see in form designer \"Restore default hotkeys\" not stays in right side. But when I open app in default DPI it shows up properly:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/11/ShareX_SWsm3afyZz.png\nBut when I make this form not use resources system then it shows up properly in form designer:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/11/v3RszzethR.png\nAnd this layout calculation problem causing issue in high DPI.\nSo problem is not to do with control settings etc.\n. But Image Effects not affected by this. Because it renders correctly (because problem only happens to user controls) but window is too big in your screen so you can't see OK button in window. So how it was working for you before? What changed?\n. Made image effects window more horizontal so it will be visible in your screen hopefully:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/11/qAfll8ag1Y.png\n. I give up on custom control translation related DPI issue (FTP account control). It is not looks possible to fix. Unless I disable translation resources system. It must be bug in .NET side.\nIf you need setup file for other fixed DPI issues, I put download link to IRC channel topic.\n. What about you download beta and let me know is it works fine?\n. Edit: Removed beta link because not necessary anymore.\n. Same error as #360 I think.\n. I can't manage to reproduce this error. Are you using screen record ffmpeg button from main window? Did you installed ffmpeg? Was it working before? Is error everytime show up?\n. I can reproduce it too when doing fullscreen recording. Which you added it to title later.\n. @SolidX can you check it?\n. @SolidX I was planning to release bug fix release 9.4.1 soon, are you planning to fix it?\n. I'm not even sure is he bot or not.\nBut I bet he pressed \"Watch\" project button and keep receiving emails every issue and want them to stop therefore replying to this issues.\nBut how he thinks everybody knows his language is beyond me.\n. Sorry I was fixing it already.\n. You mean custom uploader?\n. Are you have reason why you need PATCH etc. methods?\nAll these 3 new HTTP methods will work same as GET, won't need any other different thing right?\nBecause I can't test them.\n. I not made FFmpeg. It can already record audio or mic.\n. There is no bug and ShareX not copying wrong URL. In website and response this URL is called as direct link. Entering that URL and taking direct URL is bad way. But I noticed you can modify that URL to get direct link. Need to add \"o\" to beginning of URL for direct URL.\nExample this: http://i57.tinypic.com/bdjndc.png\nNeed to start with \"o\": http://oi57.tinypic.com/bdjndc.png\nEdit: OMG they even converting image to jpeg for direct URL...\nSo it must be: http://oi57.tinypic.com/bdjndc.jpg\nWhich I can't figure out is it jpg or png, so I can't modify link myself.\n. Dropbox recommends using \"?dl=0\" and sent email to devs about it.\n. I wonder why you prefered Uri.EscapeUriString instead HttpUtility.UrlPathEncode?\nBecause I didn't know Uri has equivalent of it and was using HttpUtility one.\n. I wish Visual Studio have like this scratch pad built in.\n. @SolidX can you test is Iggomez merge fixed your issue?\n. @SolidX can you test is Iggomez merge fixed your issue?\n. Close this then.\n. It is not advert, it is watermark.\nYou can disable it from After capture tasks -> Add image effects:\n\nor you can edit it from Task settings -> Image -> Effects:\n\n. If it were advert then it wouldn't be editable or removeable, and it was always exist as watermark for years just was not enabled by default and people didn't know ShareX could do watermark.\nYes it helps advertising but also helps people know that ShareX can do watermark so it is one stone and two birds. Otherwise very high percentage of users won't even enter image effects window at all because they won't know it is exists. So point is people will see watermark and will edit it or remove it.\nIt obstruct your image because of high dpi, in default dpi it not touch your image.\nYou telling like it is not possible edit or disable, then I would agree with you and suggest uninstalling this software.\nOther softwares gives non direct links to images which contains adverts which earns them money, not to mention few other services uploads to imgur then embeds it to their domain just for advertising. This is what advert is called and it is not possible to disable in that apps and people have no problem with that...\n. How they don't know, that setting is in main window. It is not like hidden in settings windows.\nI would understand if it were hidden in settings window then people couldn't find it.\nBut \"After capture tasks\" is needed for very basic needs like saving image or uploading it. So people needed to check it in every case anyway?!\n. That people mainly not even try to search, just directly ask how to disable it. If him bothered to check just main window he would find it. Because I even wrote \"Watermark\" to that \"Add image effects\" button just so people would notice it more easily. And we designed ShareX to be advanced customiseable software. So people need to customise it to their needs, this is what software designed for. Default settings is what I prefer to be default. So if it not fits them then they just need to customise it to their needs.\n. I decided to make watermark on by default after people actually request it, like this: #285\nSo unlike you, people actually wanted ShareX to be known and try to support ShareX.\n. How do you think I found that link now?\n. And I not accepted that web site advertising. It was pull request which is \"request\".\n. Feel free to use another software then if you not willing to change single setting which takes 2 seconds compared to our 7 years effort to make this software.\n. It is not bug in ShareX. Your Arial font is corrupted.\n. Check #373\n. You can use clipboard upload for that and just disable uploading?\n. I checked timing of making two images, in my computer it takes around 130ms for 1920x1080.\nDid you checked \"Rectangle (Light)\"? It is for this purpose, faster version of it.\n. Indeed still your setting can be handy.\nI was made window info (that areas you hover) loading async to not slow down startup of crop screen and mainly it is not even noticeable that it actually loads late.\nMaybe I can do similar thing for background brushes too like this:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/11/E10B5YrcJS.png\nSo until \"brushesLoaded\" become true it will use original image then use dimmed image. But not sure would it be good idea because background will become dimmed suddenly.\n. It is active window process name and title therefore only works with active window capture not rectangle capture.\n. Your link not works.\nThat hotkey is specific to you and I don't know what settings it have.\nBut \"Rectangle (Objects)\" works fine.\n. It is more like ASP.NET is becoming cross platform which is web site thing. So still far from multi platform.\n. In Paint and GIMP result is same too: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2014/11/pBY1Wz5WsF.png\nBlack sections actually transparent in source image and because copying alpha data not supported by .NET or in majority of image editing software it looks black.\n. It is not possible. Instead you can use FFmpeg CLI for what you need.\n. That command line (-StartScreenRecorder) starts screen recorder using last region.\nYou can see what video devices ShareX using from video device list.\n. It can give false security to people if I encrypt them, because you can check source codes (or decompile assembly) and be able to decrypt them easily. So people will see passwords are encrypted and share their config thinking it is secure then other guy can check source codes and decrypt it easily.\nAnother method would be storing user encryption key locally but still if your computer is compromised then this key file also will be compromised anyway. So again this can give false security to user because it not really protects at all.. I was reading this now and they also write similar stuffs to what I wrote: https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/PlainTextPasswords\nLike this:\n\nObscure a password. This means we do something to store the password in some format other than plain text, but we automatically convert it for you. This is security by obscurity, and is a Very Bad ThingTM in that it gives users a false sense of security that we (Pidgin, Finch, and libpurple developers) believe would be worse to have than to let informed users deal with the password issue themselves. Consider that a naive user might think that it is safe to share his or her accounts.xml, because the passwords are \"encrypted\"..

Consider that a naive user might think that it is safe to share his or her accounts.xml, because the passwords are \"encrypted\".. Don't you think there must be reason why I made it like that. If you use proper xml then how you add new entry is: Open XML file, parse it, add entry in memory, convert that data to xml back, write all xml to back file. That can cause corruption if when writing all XML back something happen. And you can lose your years of history. Current method is just appending text end of history that way your history never can corrupt (like if electricity went off when saving still it won't be corrupt). So it is all about security and my 5 years of history never can become corrupt.\n. Pastebin response don't includes deletion link. If you use user account upload then you can easily delete it.\n. I don't think Pastebin API supports login with Google account. Because you need to supply username/password.\n. When you emailed me 2 months ago, I replied to you and asked you to add me to GTalk for talking. You not added me nor replied with email. So if you don't bother responding why would I?\n\nBy the way there is properties in C# so you don't need to do this every time:\n```\niCaptureType captureType = new TypeFullScreen();\npublic void setCaptureType(iCaptureType c)\n{\n    captureType = c;\n}\npublic iCaptureType getCaptureType()\n{\n    return captureType;\n}\n```\nInstead you should do:\n```\niCaptureType captureType = new TypeFullScreen();\npublic iCaptureType CaptureType\n{\n    get\n    {\n        return captureType;\n    }\n    set\n    {\n        captureType = value;\n    }\n}\n```\n. It is already exist in right click menu...\n. The thing is, you are lazy to open deletion URL to remove image. But I'm also lazy to implement deletion of image using http request which will take hours of efforts compared to your few seconds of opening deletion URL. So it not worth adding.\n. @Efreak there is already Open -> Deletion URL button.\n. In history window.\n. \n. In main window destinations menu.\n. I tried making animated gif now and it worked.

I was added it but then noticed it require public to work but ShareX have private or public with link only so it wouldn't work, then i discarded it.\n. I can't force that, some people would prefer to resize even when width is smaller, to make every image same size. But maybe I should add optional setting like ResizeIfImageBigger.\n. You made mistake, it not calculating aspect ratio resizing. Also you not did this change in latest revision so merging not even possible. I will do it just 1 min work. But finding setting name can take 5 mins because OnlyResizeIfBigger little ugly :P\n. Thanks for effort too.\n. Not using their .NET library created so much problem because their API is problematic.

I don't even know why it gives that error.\n. Kesmy pull request fixed these issues I think.\n. When you press Close button ShareX sends stop command to ffmpeg cli and waits for it to exit. In rare cases when error happen in ffmpeg cli, it not closing automatically when it should, so this could happen.\nIs it happens everytime for you? Because I can't reproduce it.\n. Because ShareX using CLI in background I don't have full control on it. Like ShareX handling errors of it when it give error and close but sometimes it not close and I don't even know that it gave error etc.\n. When I can't reproduce issue, I can't solve it. FFmpeg probably shows error and not close, so I must check that but because I don't got that error therefore I can't know how to check it. Normally when error happen it closes and I can show that error to user but in your case it is not.\n. When I can't reproduce issue, I can't solve it.

Yea If I can see error in test window then I can try to handle that error and kill ffmpeg process otherwise without reproduce it I can't write auto ffmpeg process killing when on error it not close automatically.\n. Normally windows client area is window without borders but that explorer window have custom things therefore client area includes top title too, so you can't capture client area for it.

Also you can set hotkey and press it to start/stop it too.\n. Fixed it: \n. You can change duration in here:  but note it is not changes fading duration.\nI can't auto hide popups, it will require too much work.\nEven if you bring active window to top (I tried today) still notification can show top of it so it is not solves.\nEdit: Also made minimum duration is 0 now instead 1, so it will close faster.\n. You can disable toast if you don't like it.\n. You can already use fine grained duration 2.125s means 2125ms. Reason for fading was not changeable so people can have time to freeze it before it disappear, if people can't know when it gonna disappear then can't react in time to freeze it with mouse hover. Therefore didn't bothered adding setting for it.\n. Added fade duration option now:\n\n500ms in this screenshot.\n. If your Windows not allows creating \"C:\\Program Files\\ShareX\\PersonalPath.cfg\" then ShareX can't do anything else to bypass it. Try creating empty text file with that name and write your preferred personal folder path inside it.\n. There is no syntax just write file path inside of empty text file with PersonalPath.cfg file name. You can use relative file path too. There is no new process spawns. I don't know why it not works for you.\n. ShareX already have webm support in FFmpeg settings.\n. I'm not sure how it shows for you because it never happened to us but you can increase:\n\nor just disable auto starting, so you can start it with button/hotkey.\n. Duplicate of #417\n.

What about other languages?\n. I made that buttons big so in other language which text bigger it can be fit...\nYour suggestions ridiculous.\n. Adding that will require making destinations toggle able, so you need to uncheck destination everytime you need to check new one. And I don't want that behavior because very few people gonna need it and other majority of people need to have trouble checking new destinations because of this. So functionality for majority more important than minority.\n. You searching this setting? \n. You need to make it false.\n. No it shouldn't be. It using your after capture tasks like this. So you can have more control about it. If you selected upload in after capture tasks then it would upload.\n. I didn't understood anything from your questions. How ?:\\ can be valid path, there is no bug in that. \nYou can't have such drive letter in Windows as I know.\nShareX have portable version if this is your intention.\n. Your two questions still not make sense.\n1. You just used relative path there which was already relative when not using custom screenshot directory anyway.\n2. ShareX have portable version like I told before.\nAnd about dynamic drive letter support I don't find it important, you can use relative folder to go back (like ../../Documents) and use documents folder anyway. Still I don't get why you doing that because having everything inside ShareX folder is more suitable for portable anyway.\n. Server side issue.\n. Server side issue.\n.

Also doing loop like that can be problem like if file name is %50.jpg then it will decode it too, isn't it?\n. I was wrong about infinite loop sorry.\nBut I don't think url decoding download path is good idea. File name was from url so I will just url decode url first then get file name from it to make download path so won't need second url decoding.\nEdit: Actually url decoding for url is not required at all? Just file name decoding for download path is needed for issue #249\nEdit2: Fixed issue now.\n. @SolidX is your changes caused this issue too :( ?\nEdit: But I think #431 fixed this issue. But I can't test because I don't have FTP account to test uploading. This is why I don't touch FTP things much and asking you everything :P\n. Thanks :)\n. Thank you very much :)\n. I tried it now and it is working. Maybe it was to do with URL. What URL you tried to shorten?\n. That URL not even work in their web site:  so their API have problem and not to do with ShareX.\n. Other people reported it here: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/google-url-shortener/4WsJRAK8hsY/discussion\n. I always use quick drop and open in image editor together.\n. If your browser not opens then ShareX can't do anything about it.\nTry to run ShareX as admin and try to close your browser if you have it open already and try again. Also authorization url must be in debug log too.\n. Normally ShareX not require to be run as admin for browser to open too. Something must be different in your computer.\n. \n\n.

Well, I can't fix if there is problem because I can't reproduce it.\nBut if uploader not works suddenly then it means 90% not ShareX related problem because codes not changing magically when it was working fine before in your PC.\n. I'm using Bitdefender too and I remember it was blocked pomf.se before but now it was working fine.\n. We will add optional browser path setting to Application Settings window advanced tab.\n. Thanks for translation! Can you contact me from Google Talk (Hangouts) like using Gmail web messenger. Because for testings (incase I need to resize few controls etc.) and for be able to reach you when I need new translations, gonna need communication :)\n. https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX/Enums.cs#L31\nand\nhttps://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX/LanguageHelper.cs#L48\n.

And when new translations gonna require what am I supposed to do.\n. Hello?\n.

Because none of the uploaders using WebClient in ShareX and have built in methods for sending requests which handles progress reporting, proxy and other stuff.\nWebClient wc = new WebClient(); \n        wc.Headers.Add(\"X-Auth-Token\", HubicOpenstackAuthInfo.token); \n        wc.Headers.Add(\"X-Detect-Content-Type\", \"true\"); \n        wc.UploadData(new Uri(HubicOpenstackAuthInfo.endpoint + \"/default/\" + SelectedFolder.path + \"/\" + fileName), \"PUT\", stream.GetBytes());\nshould be:\n```\n        string url = URLHelpers.CombineURL(HubicOpenstackAuthInfo.endpoint, \"default\", SelectedFolder.path, fileName);\n    NameValueCollection headers = new NameValueCollection();\n    headers.Add(\"X-Auth-Token\", HubicOpenstackAuthInfo.token);\n    headers.Add(\"X-Detect-Content-Type\", \"true\");\n\n    UploadResult result = UploadData(stream, url, fileName, headers: headers, method: HttpMethod.PUT);\n\n```\nI think.\n. Now I tried uploading to folder and it works fine :)\nBut only have one problem that images don't show thumbnail and have no preview. So I will check it now.\n. Unfortunately I can't find how to show thumbnail and support image preview like normal sharing.\nHubic don't even have support email etc. so I can't contact them for ask too.\nAlso I noticed that I can't set root folder to upload.\n. I wish you checked OneDrive as example folder listing :D Because it allows to select root folder too:\n\n. So are you planning to make \"Root folder\" selectable some how?\n. I noticed big problem, OAuthInfo don't contains refresh token and it expires. So people need to re auth everytime because it can't refresh itself. So it is completely unusable currently.\nYou can test it with \"Refresh folders list\" button. It can't refresh expired token therefore can't refresh folders.\n.

Then I need to disable this uploader before release because I can't release broken uploader.\n. @SolidX was added that code in #371\nSo pull requests when fixing one thing in the other hand breaking other things :(\nSo I dunno which pull request is correct anymore.\n. Thanks\n. \n. Unfortunately I can't help you about it because it is external library. And SFTP works in many people so  something can be wrong in your config or server not supported by SFTP library or maybe bug in library etc.\nSo either way I can't help about these because I never used SFTP and not wrote this SFTP library.\n. If image size limit is 0 then it should always use PNG.\nProbably you overrided that setting in hotkey setting or something like that.\n. There is file size limit setting which allows you to use JPG for big images automatically. But when you set it 0 then it disables that. So you must have it enabled in default or hotkey task settings otherwise it won't use second file format which is JPG.\n. Can you send me your config file because it not make sense how it can use JPG even when you selected PNG as second image format.\nI'm trying to reproduce your problem but still ShareX using png even when image size is 3.4mb\n. Was just needed ApplicationConfig.json and HotkeysConfig.json files.\nUploadersConfig.json can contain your account info therefore I removed your message.\nSo I suggest you to remove your link and remove ShareX authentications from your accounts too.\nGonna test jpg problem now.\n. When I press Ctrl + Shift + 2 with your config it uploads 2mb+ png. Not makes jpg.\nEdit: Oh Imgur converts png to jpg. You told ShareX uploading as jpg so I thought there is bug in ShareX. ShareX uploads as png but Imgur gives jpg link, so I can't do anything about it. If you use user upload instead anonymous then Imgur won't compress.\nEdit 2: I sent email to Imgur support for ask is there a way to force not compressing image in anonymous upload.\n. Response from Imgur:\n\"Currently we compress images over 5MB for anon uploads. We might lift this restriction down the road, but for now we don't have any parameters to disable this.\"\n. I think I should write English word there instead \"ZH-CN\". Maybe \"Simplified Chinese\"?\n. It is not case SupportedLanguage.French :P\nBut no problem I fixed it. I was just asked what should I use as chinese word for that menu.\n. ShareX saves settings even when you minimize ShareX to tray. So I'm not sure how it failing. It is expected when PC closing sometimes it won't allow saving settings but still when minimizing it should be saving your selected destinations.\n. In debug log window you can see every single setting saving and loading. And when it fails, it will show there too. Debug log saved in ShareX personal folder. But mainly if settings not saving it is possible debug can't save too because Windows terminate ShareX when shut down sometimes. Depends on system config too.\n.

Setup file registers directshow dll which is required for screen and sound recording. But those dll used by Chrome for some reason so when setup can't register them asking for Chrome to be closed but because updater opens setup as silent then it can't ask. So there is nothing I can do about it. It is kinda Chrome fault because not sure why it using those dlls when not needed.\n. Also it not happens every time. For example I updated to latest version when Chrome is open, still it is not closed. Don't know when Chrome interacts with directshow dlls.\n.

I tried mp4 gfycat upload with hotkey and it worked: https://gfycat.com/AnxiousSparseBluejay\n.

Probably there is many OCR software so it will be overkill to use ShareX for it anyway.\nhttp://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-best-ocr-tools-extracting-text-images/\n. I added OCR as \"Text capture\" in capture menu:\n\nIt uses online API to do OCR and shows result like this:\n\nUsing online API had advantage of not including very high size library and language files to ShareX setup.\n. https://ocr.space. https://ocr.space. It not works without login. And for login system using API key. But it should have made it not selectable in destination when API key is missing.\n. I tried uploading to MediaCrush now and it worked. Is it possible your login info wrong? Or it can be server related issue too.\n. I can't find anything about running non elevated in here: http://www.jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=runsection\n. You can use actions to run CLI like this: http://optipng.sourceforge.net/\n\nBut such png compressions takes longer than upload time and not worth waiting.\n. You can't set 2nd Imgur uploader.\n. I don't think it is possible for ShareX to freeze your computer. I not even used keyboard hook which can cause similar effects when input not handled.\n. You can click on tray icon to stop or press gif recording hotkey to stop.\n. I tried  and it worked fine.\nStarting and stopping is same tray icon click or hotkey press.\nAnd there is no such thing in hotkey system as executing something as soon as the hotkey is released. \nAnd it not used FFmpeg it was gif.\n. Fixed it: \n. There is many steps which can modify file and reloading image everytime would be inefficient and it is not very high likely you can select it from list before edit anyway mainly people would select it when uploading so it will always show latest version. Actually in normal capturing it opens image editor before saving so how you got preview at all?! Not to mention file can be not modified after these tasks and it will be waste of hard disk io reading it again. So I'm not planning to keep refreshing it. You can reselect it to force refresh incase needed.\n. Spaces using %20 in url which is valid encoding so there is no problem in file naming. There is no setting to remove spaces in ShareX. Problem must be to do server side.\n. Added it here: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/wiki/Custom-Uploader-examples#zippysharecom\n. I already added that in latest version, you need set hotkey for \"Screen color picker\" and then set:\n\n. It using Internet Explorer to render screenshot. I could have easily added that to ShareX but rendering it in IE is horrible. And most importantly people would like to get ss of what they see which means including their logged in status etc. So cookies won't work in these. So using these is best bet: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/wiki/Capture%20webpages%20using%20browser\n. I was tried uploadType=media and it was not solution. There was other problems too and also i need to use multipart for be able to set file info and that multipart type was not working too because it require special multi part type which not supported by ShareX. So this API bullshit. They want us to use their libraries. Making it ourself difficult.\n. Try running ShareX as admin.\n.  try enabling these.\n. There is IRC.\n. Time out issues mainly not to do with ShareX.\n. Nothing changed in 9.7.0 to do with FTP. And nothing sets IsActive to true in codes.\n. It have separate hotkey now.\n. Response was not including direct link.\n. Raw file url not exist in response therefore I can't make an option for it.\n. It is nothing to do with ShareX obviously. That guy who responded you probably have no idea about API because their homepage not using same API to upload, so it not make sense he suggesting you to use homepage.\n. Their API have 10mb limit.\n. They don't allow ShareX (or any software) to upload bigger than 10mb size.\n. I'm using Dropbox with FFmpeg videos.\n. Which host gave this error?\n. Were you uploading to Imgur?\n. I think their server was down when you uploading. Is it works now?\n. How you know implementation have problem instead it is server side or computer side problem?\nIf implementation was bad then how it worked for years and suddenly not working.\n. @tice1 are you using Bitdefender? Because Cloudflare ssl was causing problems with it.\n. I tried their web site and it not completes too:\n\nIt stucks like that never completes.\n. Are you telling this right after I delete it? Am I supposed to re add all UI stuff now with all their translations...\n. This is why i told you right after I deleted UI options for mediacrush you requested it and I'm lazy about ui stuff :P\n. This is why i told you right after I deleted UI options for mediacrush you requested it and I'm lazy about ui stuff :P\n. I made it support all custom urls now like this:\nnew MediaCrushUploader(\"https://imgrush.com\");\nSo anyone can use their own host too.\n. Translation have problem and it is already fixed in latest version.\n. This is not mergeable :(\n. It is Windows only.\n. I don't see point of seeing hex there.\n. You mean this?\n\n. I'm not planning to add auto applying when typing because when your history is too big it can delay typing.\n. Which host?\n. It is server side problem and probably it is working for him too now.\n. Everybody using their API have this problem. People keep emailing their api support email but got no response yet.\n. No API not different.\n. Yes it is because of tabs and I wrote here therefore: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/wiki/Code-contribution\nThat I only accept pull requests with spaces.\nAlso this not solves #532 because he want search to happen when typing but yours just checking it. So it is not what he wants.\n. \"On history page can you add event listener on EnterKey for apply filters?\"\nWhich means when you press key it will apply filters. So this pull request not meet his request.\n. Oh I thought enter key means press key.\n. I'm reverting AcceptButton change because it not allows list to open URLs with Enter key.. Server denies permission so can't be to do with ShareX I think.\n. It is feature. You can disable it from here: \n. Wouldn't it be better if you did this pull request to Greenshot project?\nAnd about ShareX changes you did, none of them fixes any leak and have problems.\n. Example in here you disposing open form:\n\nAlso you disposing BackgroundWorker in many places but reason why it have IDisposeable because it inherits Component. Which allows you to add BackgroundWorker to forms. But it actually don't have anything which require dispose. So it should not be disposed.\nSo I can't see any leaks I forget.\n. This is why I added \"Perform actions\" to After capture tasks. With it you can use any image compression app.\n. Are you using different DPI?\ngdigrab can't handle high dpi resolution numbers properly so you should use:\n\n. #923\n. I checked Inno Setup, reason why it don't have Create folder button because it adds ShareX to your destination anyway. So if you select Software folder there then it will add ShareX folder in it automatically. So there is no need to have it and not possible to add that button unless disable auto ShareX adding.\n. I already made update message to not activate itself and tried in fullscreen games. It was not minimizing my fullscreen games. Only in first update check it activates, which means when ShareX is opening.\n. I opened CS:GO and ShareX update window not minimized game. It was staying in taskbar not active.\nPeople won't even see tray icon because it is hidden mainly in peoples Windows.\nSo I have no idea how it can minimize in your computer.\n. Sorry I don't pirate games.\n. You could add this commit to previous pull request.\n. Installer can't update portable version because portable not supposed to store anything.\n. You can set two different hotkey for your capture & upload operation.\nOne can upload to FTP other can upload to Imgur destination.\nOr you can use one of these settings to show destination window automatically:\n\nBut hotkey would be more convenient solution.\n. So you want to be able to select gmt which will apply to both name patterns?\n. I will add dropdown box top of name pattern section which will have list of gmt from -12 to +12 and this selection will apply to two name patterns.\n. I added this:\n\nBut not sure is it possible to detect daylight saving from these regions or I must add separate setting for it.\n. Normally I don't add not known uploaders because mainly those close service like in one year and then my efforts going waste while implementing them. But still I liked simplicity of your site and will add it.\nBy the way when adblock is on there is problem in upload result page showing square top of deletion section.\n. I don't know what name to give to your uploader in destinations list?\n. Hi, can you please only pull request pl.resx files because your pull request have Thumbs.db files.\nAlso it would be more convenient if you pull request at least project by project because like this you would need to do like 30 pull requests to complete whole translation.\nThanks.\n. Also I couldn't answer you in IRC because I was AFK.\n. It checks for update every 60 minutes. Reason for this was some people not closing ShareX for weeks.\nYou can disable auto checking from Application settings, advanced tab.\n. Default task settings and application settings in same file so it is not possible for one to reset but other not.\n. Why would someone want to use something which have 10 files limit?\n\n. File form name is \"file\". But it won't work with custom uploader because first you doing one request and they giving Amazon S3 url for you to upload file.\n. File form name is \"file\". But it won't work with custom uploader because first you doing one request and they giving Amazon S3 url for you to upload file.\n. Why you don't use their client?. Sorry I'm not planning to implement CloudApp support.. @SoullessWaffle I don't want it to be added and you can probably guess the reason.. >That seems asinine.\nSeriously? How many software in the world advertise competitor software? Close to zero? My decision is very logical.\nCompanies even doing the opposite, for example when you are using Chrome or Firefox, Microsoft opens popups telling Edge is better and people should check it. (https://superuser.com/questions/1146123/disable-microsoft-edge-pop-up-notifications-in-taskbar-and-system-tray). They support importing bookmarks from previous browser so people can easily move to their browser... What exactly is it to do with this case.\nGimp support it so people who using Photoshop can move to their software.\nAgain same thing for office.\nSo all these actions made so people can move to their software.. Because when people use ShareX to upload to cloudapp then ShareX will generate urls with cloudapp domain, so when you share those urls, people who see those links will think you are using cloudapp and they will install it and even buy their service. So ShareX will advertise cloudapp that way. How much difficult to understand this simple logic.. I tried it and gif opened in image editor:\n\n. Animated gif can't be edited in image editor obviously.\n. @xPaw is this can solve your problem?\n\nSo your video or animated gif recordings will always upload.\n. Because they don't have API it would be difficult to do.\n. @alanedwardes can you check it?\n. Try changing FTP IsActive setting.\n. I don't know, I don't have FTP server.\n. I can't login from their web site too. Are they reset account info?\nEdit:\nwtf they removed my account:\n\n. ShareX needs directx or opengl capture which is very complex.\n. I'm not making any big changes to Greenshot image editor.\n. Someone was wanted to translate ShareX to Polish and I told him that you were worked on it long time ago and probably not gonna finish it. So he could be translating now. Doing translation part of ShareX and then stopping it more harmful than not doing at all because when people ask is someone translating it or not, I can't even know what to tell. And so frequently people start it and stop middle of it and never complete it.\nSo if you didn't have much free time why you even started translating it and blocked potential translators who have free time and gonna finish it?\n. Yes I can give compiled build.\n. In that zip majority of the translation files missing?\n. You need to add -StartAutoCapture cli command to startup shortcut of ShareX. Which will start auto capture using last region.\n. Do one time auto capture with full screen region. It will save that region. So -StartAutoCapture will do full screen region on startup when you add that command to startup shortcut.\n. I don't know why it not capturing, it is supposed to capture.\n. It should use same size as your Windows resolution?\n. While uploading image, processing is already optional it will just upload your jpeg file not re encode it. And mainly clipboard won't contain jpeg data. So I don't understand your problem.\n. I understood you but you didn't understood me. Clipboard upload can upload file directly without re encoding. And if you doing bitmap clipboard upload then it don't contains any jpeg info anyway and it will do what it is necessary.\n. It works for everybody and without be able to reproduce it I can't know why it not works for you.\nIs it works when you shorten using after upload task instead of clipboard upload? Is other url shorteners works?\n. http://i.imgur.com/3SrCsau.png in here you checked first one, how it supposed to shorten? But you didn't told it was instead uploading it too. So how that possible?\n. In your config it will download image and re upload it because you checked first setting in that screenshot. So it can't shorten it. But you didn't told me it was uploading anything too so I was not suspicious of it.\n. When first option checked there it not running second option. This includes for third option too. All these 3 options URL jobs therefore if one of them triggered then other not runs.\n. File check happens in separate thread therefore it returns as soon as it is triggered.\n. It can't be used  to work, I don't remember changing its functionality. And It was kinda intentional why I did this because it will be inconsistent then. I mean if I want to shorten URLs then I would like to shorten every URL, not just non file ones. So I did this on purpose. Only one URL task can run actively for consistency. So it is not bug.\n. Reason is there was only one URL task before. Later I added two more and for not reset peoples setting not changed them to radio boxes.\nIf that way easy like how you telling that \"if\" should work, I would do it. But there is threads involved therefore I can't just pass to other...\nThere is reason for everything. I thinked all of these before you ask these.\n. Google URL shortener not allows to shorten Dropbox urls, even in their web site.\n. Google URL shortener not allows to shorten Dropbox urls, even in their web site.\n. Significant security flaw? Are you aware majority of softwares in your computer not using code sign checks in auto updaters especially open source ones. Actually I don't think you can find any open source software which have such auto updating mechanism. You tell it like ShareX is big threat to people. Many people who have no knowledge about these will think ShareX is dangerous to their computer because of how you writing it. Because I keep seeing in forums people linking here telling ShareX is unsecure...\n. I told \"I care security alot\" and I'm very paranoid about security always, which means I want to have code signing too, but like I told before I don't know how to do it and making issue stay open means that I will do it in future and give false impression.\nSo closing issue means that I'm unable to do it and only possibility for this feature to happen only when people help me with their pull requests which mainly not happens. In the other hand I don't think this is big security risk and don't worth making me read wall of texts for hours and translate many words in them and still unable to learn it. So if you care about this then feel free to pull request because obviously you know this stuff unlike me. Otherwise there is nothing I can do.\nEdit: Also very important thing is if I manage to fail that implementation then it can block auto updating system forever in that version unless people download latest version from web site, this gonna be really big problem and don't wanna risk it too because too much people gonna be stuck in that version for long time.\n. @Ninja101 that place sells certificate with pretty decent price compared to other places, but it only allows to register with personal name. I won't like to use my personal name while signing ShareX. I prefer certificate to be registered with \"ShareX Team\" name and this is not possible from there.\n. @Ninja101 I'm pretty sure I can't get with \"ShareX\" or \"ShareX Team\" name from there but I still wanted to ask them about it but unable to, because their contact link is invalid: https://en.sklep.certum.pl/contact/\n. I saw that Notepad++ (open source project) got free certificate from DigiCert: https://twitter.com/digicert/status/687680270309441536\nand it is named as \"Notepad++\" in certificate.\nI wonder if I contact them, would they give us free certificate too. But we are more small compared to Notepad++ so it is slim chance.\n. I can't direct message them from Twitter so I need to find way to contact them.\n. I added you in Steam.\n.

Hi @kenrmartin I sent email now. Very thanks for helping us :)\n. Hi @kenrmartin I sent email now. Very thanks for helping us :)\n. It is complicated to fix. And not gonna be that useful anyway because you are not supposed to create new folder every single ftp upload which gonna slow down upload and make countless folders because unix time never gonna be same each upload. So it not worth finding solution to it.\nThat unix timestamp was supposed to be used for file name not folder name which works fine.\n. Are you using different DPI?\nTrying using \"screen-capture-recorder\" for video source which works fine with different DPI.\n. Oh you talking about video length, i thought you talking about video resolution size.\nWhen you start it, it opens CLI window in background mainly it starts so quick but maybe in your computer something slowing down its open so long that you think it not uploaded full of it?\n. Is beginning of video missing or end of video is missing? Or is video running faster?\n. I'm not sure how it is possible but ShareX using FFmpeg CLI for recording and if problem happens then it happens in FFmpeg side and I can't fix it.\n. Other softwares use ffmpeg library not CLI. And that softwares doing recording theirself too. But in ShareX even recording happens in ffmpeg. You can see what commands ShareX supply and you can customize them too.\n. Is your problem happens with x264 too?\n. With webm too much frame drops happens anyway, it is not very suitable for real time encoding.\nSo I suggest you to use x264.\n. Can you check in FFmpeg config window \"Test with CMD\" button is there any error it have? Because rarely when error happens it is supposed to close CMD window but it not closing and stucks like that. Because I can't reproduce this situation, I can't fix it too.\n. You trying webm recording with aac audio codec which not supported with webm.\nAnd when this happens it is supposed to close and then ShareX shows what is this error.\nBut in your case it stucks and not close. Because I can't reproduce this situation I can't find workaround too :(\n. VP8 and Vorbis together supposed to work.\nBut for real time recording I suggest x264 because with webm so much frame drops happens.\n. I'm failing to understand how in your case when CLI give error how it not closes automatically. I keep trying and same errors happens and then CLI exe closing so ShareX can continue. If I can't reproduce it then I can't manage to fix that close stuck problem.\n. Then your audio source is not supported by ffmpeg. Are you not using these?:\n\n. There is hotkey for active monitor screen capture but not for screen recording and I'm not planning to add it because there is already tons of hotkeys in list.\n. What is point of be able to see deletion URL? It is not like you are gonna write it manually. You will instead press open deletion url button.\nI'm not planning to add customiseable columns to main window.\n. It is in here https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/releases/tag/v9.8.0\n. Auto updater not works with portable so I don't want everybody to use it.\n. They don't add .NET apps.\n. Main reason was why I didn't added before because I couldn't find good sounds so I thought people would suggest good sounds for them. Because was using Windows sounds before. Still not sure is it good idea even I found slightly better upload and error sound than default Windows sounds.\n. From Task Settings.\n. From Task Settings.\n. You can already change or disable sounds.\n. \n. Thanks, using multipart/related fixed many of issues I think.\n. And how that can work when you select two different window?\nAlso getting title of each control slows down it alot too because some forms have thousands controls.\nSo I'm not planning to add %t support for window regions because of problems and performance concerns.\n. There is no file name format because when doing capture there is no file name exist. And when you doing file upload it not using name file parsing anyway unless you force it.\n. There no way to remove currently. Check #68 for more info.\n. There no way to remove currently. Check #68 for more info.\n.

It is good idea but not sure how I should make it because I can't add multiple monitors to hotkey task list because it is from enum list. Maybe I should have specific monitor capture hotkey task and having hotkey number section somewhere in task settings.\n. I was thinking it could be like this:\nDrop down menu:\nMonitor 1 (X: 0: Y: 0 Width: 1920 Height: 1080)\nMonitor 2 (....)\nText boxes:\nX: Y: Width: Height:\nSo when you select monitor text boxes gonna be set to that rectangle info and those will be saved to setting. That way it will also allow custom regions to be used other than monitor regions. So monitor order should not be saved to setting but region of them.\nIf you think you can do it properly then sure will be nice.\n. You can do it from here:\n\n. You can do it from here:\n\n.

Look like problem to do with folder is not exist in your computer. If you did single capture it would be created automatically this is why I didn't noticed it before.\n. Uninstalling won't solve this problem. Capture folder was missing which require you to do single screen capture save so folder would be created.\n. Sorry for your wasted time but those were uncomplete translations and I only add them when translation is complete because so many times translations left not finished and after that removing them from projects manually would be problem therefore I was not added them :(\nBut thanks anyway.\n.

Because I don't think anything changed about capturing in new version. And screen capture code was not changed for last 3 months.\n. I heard some anti virus softwares have anti screen capture feature maybe that was white listed previous ShareX version?\n. So there is nothing I can do about it.\n. Did you tried re opening ShareX?\n. Your firewall could be causing it (I know because Bitdefender was doing same thing and even for Steam etc.). So problem not to do with ShareX.\n. Yes it doing it.\n. It also happens for other softwares too like Steam etc. and my friends having same problem too. It is unbelievable how Bitdefender still not fixed this.\n. You telling only limit is file size but they remove files after 12 days which is big deal.\n. It is already exists?\n\n. I can't find any bpg encoder for C#. And probably you can use CLI to encode png/bmp (lossless) images to bpg automatically using ShareX.\n.

What is Boomer?\n. Already exist.\n. \n. I didn't understood few things in codes, example these properties:\nMonitorName, MonitorBounds.\nMonitorName supposed to be ToString method. It is not like Monitor can have name.\nMonitorBounds, I don't even know about that because you already have x, y, width, height so what is point of this?\nMonitorRegion class feels very useless to me when you can just use Rectangle?\nAlso I don't understand how you can give such control names in big form:\n\n\nEspecially when that form have many width related controls etc.\nAlso this is fragile DefaultScreenRegionCboIndex because monitor count and resolutions can change. So it is no point saving monitor index at all and we just using custom region anyway which is not connected to monitor?\n. Thanks all looks good now but have one question [DefaultValue(0)] how rectangle can have 0 as default value?\nVery small typo in resx file: <value>Monitor{0} (X:{1} Y:{2} Height:{3} Width:{4}</value>\nShould be <value>Monitor {0} (X:{1} Y:{2} Height:{3} Width:{4})</value>\nWas missing ) end of it.\n. What localisation?\n. It is translators work. Never use Google Translator in anything it makes texts completely not understandable.\n. Merged it thanks.\n. This is beyond scope of ShareX.\n. It is in bottom right corner and people keep using it everyday.\n. I was adding them when hotkeys empty for default initiation. Didn't thought about someone would actually would like to have no hotkey set. For now you can have workaround for it, just create hotkey with task: None and no hotkey set. So it will be still empty and not filled with default ones.\n. Is DreamObjects support works with this?\nBecause they listed us in here: http://wiki.dreamhost.com/How_to_Use_ShareX_with_DreamObjects\nAnd it would be bad if we stop supporting them :(\n. I'm not really sure is supporting one region more important than removing DreamObjects support :(\n. Thanks.\n. Which video source you using in FFmpeg? Did you tried other one?\n. I meant video source in ffmpeg settings.\n. I guess your monitor dpi is different therefore your cursor position is wrong because it is bigger cursor.\n. By the way ShareX using open source https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free for screen recording in FFmpeg so you can report your high DPI cursor problem there if you want.\n. https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free/issues/56\n. #1329 In latest ffmpeg release gdigrab video source cursor position fixed, can you test it?\n. Even Paint.NET can't manage to save it. Also Microsoft Paint can't save too. You are not supposed to use url in file dialog. Because where it saves not allows saves to there.\n. Try re installing ShareX.\n. You need to re authorize your login.\n. I don't know what is DLP but if some software blocking ShareX then there is nothing we can do about it obviously.\n. You showed hotkeys not working what is it to do with screen capture?\n. If some software in your PC already registered that hotkey you can't register it again.\n. What is it to do with hotkeys...\n. All screen capture softwares (nearly) using same method to capture.\n. Your hotkey problem nothing to do with capture.\n. When you close task settings window it saving settings so I'm not sure why it not saving for you.\n. It saves for me.\n. Even if i kill still it will save because it saves when task settings window close not when ShareX close.\n. We didn't made Greenshot image editor.\n. We didn't made Greenshot image editor.\n. You should have contacted Greenshot support for this.\n. Because you were using Greenshot image editor in your screenshot which have shadow behind arrow drawing.

Upload last capture is not good idea because then what about edit last capture, copy last capture, open last capture etc. it only suits to your needs and not good workflow.\nWhat you need to do is having two separate hotkeys one will do just capture and other hotkey can do capture + upload. You already want two different hotkey and this is doing same thing with two different hotkey too with more possibilities and good workflow.\n.

Steam have one second delay which lose all point, when you can open instantly with right click why wait one more second?\n. You mean this setting?\n\nWhich can convert big images to jpg depending on your setting.\n. Also Imgur can compress bigger images.\n\"Currently we compress images over 5MB for anon uploads. We might lift this restriction down the road, but for now we don't have any parameters to disable this.\"\n. What is difficult in Gfycat choose?\n. Not every destination have options.\n. ShareX already can upload to Gfycat.\n. I'm not planning to add Greenshot to Windows shell context menu because then I need to add countless other things to there too. Maybe you should ask this to Greenshot developers and install their software to use as standalone image editor?\n. If your Windows not allows for setup to create directory there then can't do anything about it. But setup should be run as admin normally, did you checked is it run as admin?\n. How am I supposed to know Chinese?\n. It already have copy to clipboard option.\n. ShareX using complicated regex to check is it URL therefore I don't think I can fix it:\nhttps://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX.HelpersLib/Helpers/URLHelpers.cs#L173\nI know regex but while fixing it I don't wanna break something else unintentionally.\n. FTP codes not changed for long time and these kind of errors mainly to do with FTP library so I'm not sure how I can help about it. If you suspect it is to do with latest version then you can try installing previous version.\n. Imgur web site upload or Imgur API upload on purpose not giving https:// links because in future they can remove support of it and then all links gonna be broken. If they intended to use it always, they would use it in website or API by default. Of course main reason can be hosting related costs but still it not change the fact I can't risk using non official URL format.. Then you should tell that to Imgur.\n. I'm telling if you think it is not secure then you should contact Imgur and tell them to return delete url which starts with https:// in both web site and API.\nAnd if you really think adding delete request support in multi destination supported software that easy, I don't know what to tell. Because it is complex with FTP destination indexes based on file type etc. So many complications. And this complications can cause deletion of wrong files in FTP which will be big risk.\n. Web site gives deletion url. I forget about API was not giving deletion url because I was implemented it years ago.\n. #716 fixes your problem too.\n. Added this option now:\n. Added this option now:\n. Are you sure is your left click not releasing itself? Example my previous Logitech mouse have same issue left click was releasing itself when dragging things.\nTry dragging in Windows desktop and see is it releasing randomly.\n. @riesza your problem look same problem as #691, right?\n. @Razerock you were pressing number key too how your issue not same as theirs?\n. Why you closing this issue, I will fix it and release new version asap :P\n. I will make sure to check modifier keys so monitor capture won't trigger if holding ctrl etc. also will add 1 second delay for key commands to work in rectangle capture so even if you set only 1 as hotkey still it won't trigger monitor capture in rectangle capture as long as you release it under one second.\n. Check new version please.\n. I can handle keys when it is down instead of up. But in this case when you press ESC it will close rectangle capture and when you release ESC some application which have focus can receive that ESC key so what am I supposed to do?\nBy the way you can do right click to close it.\n. I was made 1 key to capture first monitor in rectangle capture but because it happens when key is up and you releasing that key when rectangle capture is open, this problem happens.\nI need to make rectangle capture hotkeys either work 1 second later or make them work in key down instead up.\n. Will update issue #690 when I fix it in 15 minutes.\n. Disabling silent is not a solution. Because people lazy to update and even now keep telling updating is long process when it is fully automated with single click and decide to not update. So I'm trying to make updating fast and easy as possible without user interaction.\nDisabling auto closing solving this problem and creating another problem:\n\nIt not tells that Chrome using this dll so people can't figure out why it is in use and what to close so they will keep opening issues. More issues than current Chrome issues. So while fixing this problem it will create another big problem.\nSo I can't find proper solution to it therefore why it is not fixed yet.\nAnd actually this problem kinda to do with Chrome too because Firefox and IE don't use this dll when it is not required, why Chrome doing this I don't even know.\n. You losing unsaved info because Chrome using dll when it is not need to. Also InnoSetup don't have option to show that Chrome using this dll warning in silent mode. So I don't want updater to have unnecessary next, next etc. dialogs when it is currently doing everything automatically and quickly. It is not about clicking 3 times it makes updating take like 1 second and without even see installing new ShareX opening automatically so it becomes very easy to update.\nYou not giving solution either. Am I don't know it is very bad to close applications without tell? How am I supposed to fix it then?\n. You losing unsaved info because Chrome using dll when it is not need to.

If you consider it malicious then don't use old version too.\n. I really want to fix this issue and keep doing hours of searching but unable to find solution. I'm very limited with this InnoSetup related issue. Even if I make it not use silent then it will still show that dll in use warning for everybody and people will keep opening issues asking why setup want me to close Chrome, so even then it is not solution. Only solution would be Chrome to not use this dll when it is not needed to. Or for InnoSetup workaround, ignoring this dll registration if it is in use and continue installing which I can't manage to do.\n. Only solution I can find is making separate setup file for these dlls and adding install button to FFmpeg options window that way auto update won't try to install these automatically but manually people can install them from there. Before still people needed to go FFmpeg options and select these new sources anyway so it won't make big difference I guess.\n\n.

SFTP codes was not changed for more than year so I'm not sure how it can be to do with new version. Also error happens inside SFTP library which can be to do with library itself.\n. I haven't touched ftp and sftp stuffs too because I'm not using FTP at all. So for years its codes staying mainly same and only ftp library changing if there is update. And I can't do anything about if problem to do with library. But for verify is problem to do with new version, you can try installing previous version.\nI don't think it is corrupt otherwise it will give non .NET related error.\n. You told it was working before and it persists in previous version that means nothing to do with ShareX.\n. Issue 687 can't be similar to yours because it is using separate library and that issue was opened in previous release. If problem to do with new version then how you can explain to me that in previous version it is still not working? Did you checked your ftp settings for are there anything wrong?\n. Your login settings correct.\n. For make sure you can first uninstall then install.\n. ShareX only using \"Documents\\ShareX\" unless you changed it.\n. Thanks.\n.

There is no where clipboard method used in this hotkey window and controls. Also only ClipboardHelpers doing all clipboard writing and when I add breakpoints to those functions, breakpoints never triggers too. So I'm currently shocked how such thing possible.\nEdit:\n30 seconds later after I write this comment I noticed double clicking label causing text of it to copy clipboard. Strangely I didn't know .NET label can do such thing. Will search for how to disable that but nearly all solutions involving getting clipboard text and re setting it which is very ugly workaround.\n.

Even when each setting windows or main window close it saving settings. You can check debug log to see it yourself. So I don't know why it not saves for you.\n. People could reproduce it 8 years ago in ZScreen too. And still I have no idea why in few people Windows not waits for all applications to close before shutdown. Because Windows terminates ShareX before it can save settings I think.\nI will reopen this issue in case maybe someone having this issue in his software too and found solution to it.\n. Many people reported here in Windows 10 upgrade their Documents/ShareX folder have ownership problems therefore ShareX couldn't save.\n. When you close ShareX manually is it saving settings?\n. Can you check Debug -> Debug log is there any error.\n. \n. Seriously?\n. It is in main window.\n. Both main window and tray menu using same function to open Settings windows and in both cases it saves settings when window close.\n. Exiting settings window trigger that.\n. You don't need to do screen recording i know how saving works.\n. Nothing is wrong...\nIt saves when Settings windows closed or Main window minimized to tray or ShareX itself closed. I already excessively saving unlike other softwares.\n. I already checked it saves when I close window.\n. This problem exists for last 8 years and it is not fixable. Also I can't reproduce it too.\n. This problem exists for last 8 years and it is not fixable. Also I can't reproduce it too.\n. I'm using ShareX for last 8 years and don't remember my settings reset while shutdown/restart Windows.\nAnd I didn't put it under appdata. It is in documents. Also you can select config path too.\n. My guess is Windows 10 shut downs too fast and not let ShareX complete its setting save. Dunno why this happens too. Normally it is supposed to wait for process to close.\n. I was think about adding timer to save like every 10 minutes but then it won't be clean solution.\n. When task completed if there is no active task going on (if this is last active task) then ShareX will save all settings async now. This way even if save fails in Windows shutdown still you will have up to date settings. I don't like frequent saves like this but I don't see any other solutions if Windows not let ShareX to save settings while shutdown happens for few people. Especially this system is handy for people who using %i in file naming, so %i number will save after each task, otherwise if save fail in shutdown %i won't be up to date. But also gonna be annoying to see save settings after each tasks in debug log.\n. #3668 fixes the problem about not be able to save settings on Windows shutdown.. Are you using bit defender?

In this case needed to use \"pt\" without \"-BR\" part.\n. I didn't got answer to my questions. Should I list your language as Portuguese or Brazil? Should I change your files to \"pt\" for automatically detect Portugal users to use your language? I don't know what to do.\n. Then why you used pt-BR so it won't work for Portugal users.\n. I added it as \"Portuguese-Brazil\":\n\nIf you want I can compile build so you can test it.\nBy the way I saw some buttons missing \"...\" in main window menus.\n. Sorry but you not using Google Translate right?\n. So this is why barely I can understand anything you tell. And with this bad English you still translated ShareX ?! Did you not read here https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/wiki/Translation in top it tells \"Fluency in English\" is required.\nYou must be used Bing Translator in majority of ShareX translations now and nothing would be understandable for users. It is better for people to use English than using machine translated translation. Because machine translation nearly not understandable, it is beyond bad. This is not acceptable. I seriously can't believe when you can't write anything in English, you still translated ShareX.\n. Added lut.im here: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/wiki/Custom-Uploader-examples#lutim\n. If your operating system not allows ShareX to create that file in that location then there is nothing ShareX can do about it.\n. I was wrote reasons here: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/pull/689\n. What is point of using https in Imgur anyway. You entire private images already public because of short predictable urls. Also https won't encrypt url itself.\n. I can make that After upload -> Copy URL to check if URL starts with \"http://\" then replace it with \"https://\" as optional setting. But can't bother adding this same code to each right click copy url buttons.\n. \nIt replacing it inside task therefore all URLs including history and copy menu etc. gonna be using https too.\n. There is no beta version but I compile beta versions when people request.\n. Check here: #698\n. What is your operating system? Try disabling http://i.imgur.com/WNjBgJH.png for workaround.\n. Nothing fixed. It is not supposed to give error and I asked you question.\n. I think you should report it to SFTP library project: https://sshnet.codeplex.com/\n. \n. I was aware of that and I was make sure it auto re position itself when it is in top of screen but for right side of screen I couldn't find suitable solution because when I move it to left side of crosshair it would look bad.\n. Not need to move text to left side of crosshair instead making it align with right side of screen was better solution: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2015/06/3GvMHWlAxt.mp4\n. You can drag rectangle from bottom to top instead of top to bottom that way help tip will have collision with your cursor and tip will automatically move to bottom. This was the reason why I didn't added collision check for region info too.\n. Also another concern was multiple region texts like this:\n\nSo if I move tips to bottom because top region text collision then bottom text will have collision too etc.\nOnly solution to this would be pressing F1 or moving cursor to tip to move it top or bottom according to your needs.\n. I was also thought much about this and was decided to not add it because of two separate reasons:\n1. Screen color picker already have exact same thing:\n   \n2. Getting color from screenshot was causing slight slow down in startup speed (because converting Image to Bitmap is slightly slow and caching Bitmap is required for be able to get color info of pixel). And I'm trying to make screen capture window open fast as possible so I decided to not add it. Because people who need to get color will open Screen color picker anyway.\n. Thanks.\n. In your computer dns can't resolve that domain it can be to do with your computer/internet or domain itself so nothing to do with ShareX.\n. Thanks.\n. I think your computer time is wrong, https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/commits/master in here always showing your commit in top like this:\n\n\"just now\" it tells always.\nUnless you are time traveler.\n. I tried custom image uploader with Imgur and tested deletion URL. It was showing up in main window and history fine.\nProbably your deletion URL have something wrong therefore it was not showing up.\nBut I was didn't added them to \"Test result\" window, so I will add them now.\n. You were told Akari Uploader not URL shortener therefore I was tested it on image uploader.\nProblem is custom uploader actually returns thumbnail and deletion URL but because actual task like image uploader can have its own thumbnail or deletion url therefore shortened url task never copies them to result. So it was intended because deletion url supposed to direct to image, text, file host links.\n. You definitely didn't understood what I said.\n. For what? FTPS?\n. How am I supposed to set syntax parameter automatically for so many text uploaders and file types. It is too much manual work.\n. It is actually not ShareX feature but Hastebin feature. When you give file extension to Hastebin it selects proper syntax highlighting. So I don't do any manual work.\n. You can customize each hotkeys settings like this:\n\nSo one hotkey can have sound and other not.\n. I'm not sure how ShareX can delete annotations but why are you not using ShareX built in annotate option which using Greenshot image editor.\n. This can do exactly same thing too:\n\nBut using built in image editor better.\n. Added them to custom uploader examples page:\nmaxfile.ro\nloveisover.me\n. I have no idea how two monitor can have different DPI because I don't have multi monitor. Therefore I can't fix this.\n. There is nothing to be fixed. But you can disable cursor from task settings.\n. There is one important reason why I didn't used non frozen screen capture selection for it, because normal screen capture have more features like magnifier, region info, window hovering (so you can select windows more easily), better performance etc. So if I use it by default then people won't have these. And no I'm not planning to write all these features to that transparent rectangle too because both working differently because of performance concerns.\n.

I added -silent -startautocapture to desktop shortcut and opened it from shortcut and it was taking captures fine. Not sure what gonna be different when using from startup.\nI noticed custom region is empty in your last screenshot. Why it is empty?\n. I don't need to restart pc it won't change anything. Did you closed ShareX normally for settings to save? Minimizing ShareX to tray also will save settings. So I don't think your settings was not saving when restarting pc too. I bet you just used fullscreen there and not set custom region and when restarting it tried to use custom region and failed.\n. I can't fix non existent problem.\nDid you understood what I told? That command line is using last custom region. You selecting fullscreen region therefore. You must use custom region and in region selection just press \"Space\" to get fullscreen region. Then close ShareX and restart pc.\n. How am I supposed to fix something which works for me??\n. You waiting for what?!?!\n. Because I don't have SFTP account I can't test am I fixed it. Would you like to try it?\n. 1) I was added web capture using IE long time ago in ZScreen but it was not good enough for my quality standards therefore I was not added it to ShareX. Like it was not giving expected result in some web sites.\nAnd about IE window list, who using IE in this century? It is completely useless.\n2) I was removed it because I thought nearly nobody would use it while trying to simplify UI and remove not used codes. Now I can't find codes of it and gonna be difficult to implement because removed many unused class files etc.\n. I found codes in ZScreen project.\nMaybe I should add it even if it is very bad use IE to render in background.\nI wonder is .NET can use Project Spartan engine in Windows 10 to render it instead of old version of IE.\n. UI:\n\nOutput: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2015/06/v4yiUCCeXG.png\n. Not to do with ShareX.\n. Yes.\n. \n. Because I was tried many things for automatically resize menu and all of these tries was giving not perfect sizes. Are you sure that your codes also works when in different language not set to proper size in codes and left it in default english size?\nEdit: I will try removing non english menu sizes and let you know.\n. I tried Anoxy from examples section and it worked.\n. I'm using Dropbox with public folder.\n. Both recording and encoding happens inside FFmpeg therefore I don't have any control over it therefore I can't draw cursor highlights. Otherwise I would have done it.\n. Each hotkey can have different task settings so you can disable audio in your new hotkey already.\n. I don't have host etc. to write proper upgrade system for portable version. I'm relying on setup to do its job for normal version and it won't work for portable version therefore portable version don't have auto update system.\n. I don't mind. Thanks.\n. Yes dns errors in your end.\n. Sorry but I can't accept uploader site which require registration and don't even have registration page.\nI designed custom uploader for that reason so people who wants to host their own uploader they can use it.\n. I checked two different dictionary none of them knows what is \"preemptively\" means.\n. I can accept now but because too long time passed merging ui won't be possible. Especially resx file because visual studio randomly orders things in it.\n. You only had one textbox on ui so it will take few minutes for you to re add them instead of trying to merge.\n. I don't know git that much either, I mean I didn't do much pull requests.\n. But it is not still permanent solution too. I mean if you don't minimize ShareX to tray after last token refreshing and if while shutdown if your Windows terminate ShareX before it can save settings then again same problem can happen.\nAlso we don't even sure about is this is the case :(\nI was authenticated to box weeks ago and it still works for me.\n. I'm using SSD too.\n. I didn't wanted to save so frequently like if you are uploading very small many files it will save non stop every second.\n. Also people can do just captures without upload and do rapid captures like every second and because it is only single task it will try to save every second again.\n. I still didn't figured out why save fails when Windows shut down in some people computer.\n. Maybe I should make issue #702 stay open and someone could have solution to it.\nFor now if you really want to make sure your settings save then you can close ShareX manually before shutdown.\nI will also add minimize to tray save uploaders config too for increase chance your config get saved.\n. Closing this issue because reopened other issue.\n. Are you know this?\n\n. How that dll not installs correctly I don't understand.\n. Added them here:\nhttps://github.com/ShareX/CustomUploaders/blob/master/teknik.io%20(File%20uploader).json\nhttps://github.com/ShareX/CustomUploaders/blob/master/teknik.io%20(Text%20uploader).json\n.

Added by #3917. Both URL upload and clipboard URL upload exists in ShareX. Which downloads first and reuploads it.\n. \nor\n\n. \n. Clipboard upload. Clipboard upload. Change BrowserProtocol to https.\n. When you do upload with that FTP settings and open FTP client is it still shows empty? I have no idea why it is empty.\n. Drag and drop window didn't have your hotkey task settings because it is singleton form not possible to open it more than one time. So I didn't thought task settings should be passed to it. But did it now.\nWhy URL should have port?!\n. Because one variable can't have more than one default value. And about automatically changing it, it will overwrite users port choose. So I can't touch it and break people port setting. Also I can't make it blank because integer variable can't be empty.\n. It is good question Scrxtchy asked. If people not willing to update to latest version then when I make this change it will break majority of people links.\n. Can't change right click it is for close popup. And for left click there is this setting:\n\nBut it was missing Copy URL so I'm adding it now.\n. Why would anyone want to upload there. They add advertisements all over the image page.\n. Your friend must be using old version.\n. Why you closed this then?\n. That fix was in v10.0 if it still not works then it is different.\n. If ShareX do that then other video source (screen-capture-recorder) won't work. So it must be ffmpeg issue because other video source handles this fine.\nAlso I never did dividing for screen capture codes and still all works fine too.\n. I was installing it automatically in previous versions but in latest version made it optional because of few problems caused by it.\n. #923\n. About wrong cursor position: https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free/issues/56\nI'm not planning to automatically install it for high dpi. Because some people may prefer to not install it. And there was some issues about automatically installing it, this is why I made it manual in latest version.\nAnd solution is not installing it automatically but it is being fixed in FFmpeg: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/4232\nhttps://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/4505\nMore people need to report gdigrab dpi issue for them to notice it I think.\n. #1329 In latest ffmpeg release gdigrab video source cursor position fixed, can you test it?\n. I don't think this problem to do with ShareX.\n. Must be same is this: #769 because both happens in refresh folder.\n. \n716\n. This is cleaned up version.\n. Can you try running ShareX as admin.\n. Everybody using ShareX as non admin and still don't get this problem so something must be wrong in your computer not sure what but there is nothing I can fix about it. As a workaround you can disable its setting:\n\n. Did you tried portable in here https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/releases/tag/v10.0.0 and then it will download FFmpeg to proper folder so you can later use it offline.\n. Majority of people using x64 system if it were installing wrong then nobody be able to use it.\nAnd it is nothing to do with #132 because there it was not installing C++ redist automatically.\n. What is HTML5 gif?\n. I think he means ShareX need to return url which ends with gifv instead of gif.\nAbout gfycat ShareX already supports it.\n. Now I noticed that gifv URLs just showing GIF and not webm version of them. Probably because GIF not big enough and there is 10mb size limit when uploading so can't upload bigger GIF too. So it is pointless to give gifv URL.\n. I can make it optional.\n. @DanielMcAssey added lnku.co support and other domains pointing to that web site.\n. @DanielMcAssey added lnku.co support and other domains pointing to that web site.\n. It is DNS related error and can't be to do with ShareX. Not sure what is wrong in your computer or config too.\n. I hope you tested your change alot because everytime someone do ftp naming related commit somethings get fixed but other things get broken.\n. Your FTP account path starts from that users folder then what ShareX supposed to do?\nI don't have FTP account so I can't try is it possible to go back directory with ../ in FTP.\n. Hi, thanks for it but I can't accept it when your entire changes using tab spaces while project using normal spaces when you check \"Files changed\" tab you can see none of the code indents matching.\n\nhttps://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/wiki/Code-contribution\nI wrote here tab spacing should use 4 spaces.

You can use actions to run CLI before upload.\nShareX don't adds any exif to jpeg and png can't have exif data. So I'm not sure what metadata you want to remove too.\n. How auto updater can open it then?\n. Yes it is called Rectangle (Objects).\n. I already tried it before and in real time encoding it was causing issues. You can try it yourself editing commands.\nThis is why I added x265 but not VP9.\n. #788\n. Fixed version not released yet.\n. How am I supposed to have ETA.\n. I don't plan release dates. I release when there is enough features.\n. You could request me to compile release for you instead of using your other monitor.\n. Edit: Removed beta link because not necessary anymore.\n. That icons don't have high resolution anyway so it will look bad stretched.\n. What is point of using it without history file. You can't have URL etc. And if you want to see latest month then why you don't use Windows explorer?\n. #825\n. Folder upload uploads all files in it not one file.\n. Post capture tasks window doing exactly what you want.\n. I'm not planning to reduce anything in that menu. It shows fundamental things. And something not frequent to you can be used by others frequently. So I can't make that menu to fit your needs.\n. You must be joking? Many browsers not even support more than 16 fps for animated gif...\n. I need to find path which I can reproduce this so I can test it.\n. Hi, I think your issue is different. It tried to create palette file in (C:\\Program Files\\ffmpeg\\bin\\palette.png) but mainly admin access needed to be able create file inside \"Program Files\" folder. Therefore you need to move ffmpeg.exe to outside \"Program Files\" folder.\nBy default ShareX downloads FFmpeg inside \"Documents\\ShareX\\Tools\" folder, so I recommend you to move it there.\n. Someone was told same thing too before and that guy was actually not opened it as admin because other instance was running in tray already and it was opened instead of admin instance.\nEven if it still can't create file there is nothing anybody can do about this because if Windows not give file access to ShareX then it can't create file.\n. ShareX works in Windows 10, we using W10 for long time. Your Windows not allows ShareX to access \"C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\ShareX\\Screenshots\\2015-08\" this folder and therefore ShareX can't do anything about it. So it is about your Windows config and not bug in ShareX side.\n. Check #884 for solution if you already not found it yourself.\n. Hi, I already fixed this problem: #788, #825, #828\nIf you would like to test it I put download link for beta version in #ShareX IRC channel title.\n. I tried to reproduce it but it uploaded successfully: https://gfycat.com/EagerGlitteringBlackfly\n. Nothing changed in Gfycat in new version.\n. Did you tried reopening ShareX?\n. Is your recording lower than 15 seconds?\n. I don't think I can figure out what is wrong without be able to reproduce it.\n. It can't be to do with screen recording and there is no setting for Gfycat. Maybe your firewall doing something?\n. https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX.HelpersLib/Extensions/NumberExtensions.cs#L101\n. https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX.HelpersLib/Extensions/NumberExtensions.cs#L101\n.

You can download beta version from IRC title.\n. I don't think it will happen because this is extremely difficult feature to implement.. That project using: https://github.com/spazzarama/Direct3DHook. This problem not to do with ShareX and according to users mainly happens because of corrupted file. I'm not sure how when installing it can be corrupted too.\n. No Coinbase not allows to convert bitcoin to dollar in majority of countries.\n. This is the reason why my custom controls in that window can't get focus:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/2362975/264877\nSo it is very difficult to implement.\n. That won't work with translation :D\n. Did you used portable mode?\n. How Portable supposed to work inside program files, ShareX don't have permission to create folder and files there.\nJust remove \"PersonalPath.cfg\" file from your ShareX folder to not make it portable.\n. That shortcut in startup folder opens fine?\n. I have no idea why he have startup issue. Because I never saw someone have startup issue before this means this problem must be completely to do with something in his PC and not to do with ShareX itself.\n. Main reason why I didn't added it is because it will require more advanced syntax. Example for random alphanumeric characters I'm adding many of them near each other but setting it like %ra{10} would be more easier. Same applies to this too (%i{4}) it will require parameter support for these syntax. And I'm lazy to make it :P\n. Because it is not pointless.\n. What is self critic means?\n.

In your out of memory exception it happens in listview. Every time it uploads it adds new entry to listview. So it is not actually leaking memory but because it keep adding to listview memory usage increases but even then that listview entries not supposed to use that much memory I think, so I'm not sure.

When you upgrade your Windows to Windows 10 some folders getting permissions changed I think for some people and therefore not allows ShareX to read any file inside that ShareX folder. You must check that Documents\\ShareX folder permissions and fix it. Problem not to do with ShareX.\n. I did some search now and Windows 10 must be did ShareX folder read only. Try to uncheck it from folder options.\n\n. I did some search now and Windows 10 must be did ShareX folder read only. Try to uncheck it from folder options.\n\n. I'm not planning to add that buttons back because these shape captures are very rarely used and people don't want them.\n. Right click cancels capture or deletes region. So what kind of suggestions you doing without thinking.\n. Because I'm tired of people, one tells there is too many items in menu and remove them, other tells after I remove them re add. I can't make everybody happy.\nAlso most important thing is I didn't remove them just moved them inside Region Capture. You and your friends easily can use those hotkeys to enable them. Also this new system allows using multiple different regions in same capture.\nIf you don't like my decisions you are feel free to not use it. I can't make software according to other people decisions instead of my own decision, because what makes ShareX good is my decisions. Of course that doesn't means I don't care other peoples suggestions and I bet I add suggestions of people far more than other software developers, this is why ShareX have tons of features. And it was not insult.\n. Of course it is easy to request. Without know how much complex making that menus customize able. Why would I waste my weeks just because people don't like menu items. Also tell me how many software have fully customize able menu support? I don't know any. Because nobody would waste their time for such thing when they can use their time for more important things.\n. As you told yourself it is \"addon\" not added by Firefox itself. Even such big company not adds itself so people make addon for it.\nAnd Tax Mix plus just edits Right click menu. It don't have submenus and such which will require more advanced ui to manage them.\n. ShareX in first screen capture will show warning are you want to upload. And when you press No in this warning it will just disable uploading.\nAlso deleting it is not impossible because from main window or history you can open deletion URL of uploaded imgur image.\nSo everything you write is wrong.\n. You can't do user upload without actually fill your account info, so obviously it was anonymous and it have \"Deletion URL\" in right click menu and in history. So you could instantly remove it.\n. It is in Open sub menu. There is nothing hard to know this.\n. I removed portable mode from installer for next release and will release zip again.\n. That website not mine so I can't put...\n.

There is some ways to optimize gifs like checking each frame and if two frame very similar to each other then removing one of them and increasing duration of previous frame. But because I'm using FFmpeg to create GIF which actually gives pretty good quality output. I can't do this optimization. But if size is concern for you then you should use mp4 or webm recording like what I do. Because same recording you did for 20mb in GIF will be probably 500kb in mp4.\n. FFmpeg handling sound recording therefore I can't fix your problem if there is something to be fixed. But never heard anyone have your issue before. Also I'm not even sure is virtual-audio-capturer is fault because you telling even your microphone source having problem, which means problem must be something in your end.\nBy the way you must use screen-capture-recorder with virtual-audio-capturer together. Not with GDIGrab. Maybe it will solve your problem too?\nIs Skype supports using these two source for testing purposes?\n. I didn't programmed virtual-audio-capturer myself too so I'm not sure:\nhttps://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free\nhttps://github.com/rdp/virtual-audio-capture-grabber-device\n.

You can blame Windows hotkey system for this or window/software for not letting hotkey input to let through window.\nBut problem is majority of people using Chrome and nobody reported this issue so I'm not really sure how Chrome not let hotkey reach to ShareX :(\n. You can post closed issues?\n. You telling you using gif recording not normal recording. Also you aware that you can't upload webm to imgur right?\n. This is how gif is.\n. Record x264 mp4 and upload it to something like Up1 file host. It will be more smooth and very small size.\n. Are you have any idea how much difficult it would be to add theme support to each control in GDI. How am I supposed to handle all that work myself. SnagIt probably have countless workers in their company not one active developer like in ShareX. Also SnagIt earns a lot of money so they can hire designers to handle that work while programmers doing other things.\n. DevExpress insanely expensive, if donations covered that then I would be rich. Also DevExpress not allows open source and if I can't put their libraries to git repo then people can't compile project.\n. There are zero out there which is good and free. I don't like metro UI.\n. There are zero out there which is good and free. I don't like metro UI.\n. WPF is best way to get good looking UI in C# but ShareX have more than 50 forms and some of these forms even have nearly 50 tabs in it. Not to mention all these custom controls I made. So making all these forms from scratch using WPF and then connecting each controls events will be insane amount of work for me. And all translations will go waste too. Also my WPF experience not that much so I will encounter so many problems too and so much learning will require.\nBecause currently only I'm working in this project actively, this work is beyond one person can handle especially when it is free software. Also there is no guarantee that people will like new WPF design more than old GDI design, because I'm not designer it is highly possible I can make new WPF design worse than how it is right now, at least for usability. And in this case it will be huge waste of efforts.\nSo currently I have no plans to rewrite whole UI with WPF. It is better for me to use my time on new features anyway. Like working on annotation support currently which will be released soon.\n. If I make it revert to previous setting then you can't disable hotkey. And If you are wondering why have hotkey if you not gonna set hotkey for it? Because you can use these tasks from Workflow menu so it don't need to have hotkey to work. So it works as intended.\n.

Transparency algorithm only works if what you capturing not changing on screen. If it changes then it just returns first taken image and because shadow part is not transparent in that image it can't crop that area when there is no shadow.

VirusTotal not picked up as false positive. Jiangmin picked it up as false positive.\n. It would be too much work. Because normal updating system relies on installer but portable not using installer. Also it won't be obvious how portable it is. Because some people store their settings in same folder as ShareX and this makes ShareX automatically portable and still people continue to use normal updating system. So there is many complications therefore I'm not planning to do it.\n. You can already disable it.\n\n. Did you upgraded to Windows 10?\n. Can you check this #884\n. So did it work?\n. If it is read only how ShareX can save settings?\n. Well there is two reason why it can be happening first is folder or sub folders of it read only or those folders don't have proper permission. So problem not to do with ShareX because your Windows not allows reaching these path. This happened to many people who upgraded to Windows 10.\n. I'm closing this issue because this problem very high likely not to do with ShareX. Because everytime someone reports FTP issue it is always to do with server, user configuration or FTP library we using which means not to do with ShareX.\n. How save fails?\n. That won't be possible because ShareX outputs image with cursor in it. I mean if I output without cursor then other after capture tasks can have issues because there is no cursor in it. So it will be problematic.\n. I closed this issue because I was not planning to implement it. I can't implement every single request unfortunately.\n. If I let every single features I was not planning to implement open then issues section fills with them a lot and it makes difficult for me to find things which I was planning to implement or fix.\n. Added cursor move/delete support to ShareX region capture annotation now:\n. If you changed folder where settings stored then settings won't be moved to this new folder. So your settings not lost you just didn't moved them?\n. Imgur not supports uploading videos. Converts gif to gifv if gif is big.\n. Yes. But Imgur have 10mb gif limit in API which is big problem.\n. GIF not even supports 60 fps in browsers...\n. You can't.\n. Check these settings to disable or enable them:\n\nSo these was actually feature and not bug.\n. So even if you downloaded FFmpeg it still asks? Also there is no code to take screen capture in screen recording selection, so how it is possible?\n. So did you checked that folder is file exist?\n. In here what path is selected:\n\n. It tells that file not exist. So how it could be exist?\n. Main reason why people have this issue is FFmpeg path is empty by default and after download FFmpeg this path is set to where it is downloaded. But because Windows shutdown without wait for ShareX to save settings. This FFmpeg path not saves so in next ShareX start because FFmpeg path is empty it asks for re download. I will set default path to proper FFmpeg path by default so even if setting fail atleast it will have proper path set.\n. It is already exists:\n\n. It tells internal server error so it can't be to do with ShareX.\n. It is already exist.\n. Sorry I don't liked your UI solution.\n. Sorry I don't liked your UI solution.\n. I don't know what is drag function and that picture not explains too.\n. I was tried to make it dragable but because you can also drop to main window, people could drag and drop to same place and re upload image. I couldn't make it not dropable to same window where you started dragging therefore I was gave up.\n. You can right click and copy -> Image (or file) as workaround.

Doing that will decrease fps because of workarounds I'm doing to speed up render time much as possible.\n. Please check #689.\nWorkaround: #716\n. One of the reason why I didn't add silent update system is because currently our update system relies on checking GitHub releases and downloading setup file then installing it with -silent parameter. But in proper silent update system relying on setup file won't give full control to us and won't be good idea.\nBecause we don't have hosting to host our own update files it won't be possible for me to make proper silent update system. Unlike Google which have silent update system in their Chrome we are not big company and can't afford such things. Not to mention majority of big companies not even have such update system. Actually I don't even have any software in my computer which can do silent updating other than Chrome. So even when big companies can't afford it, it is not likely for free open source softwares to have good silent update systems.\nNot to mention writing that system would require alot of effort because it is not just about installing in background and running it in startup of ShareX. Because in every part of that system need to have protections in case electric go off etc. so ShareX won't stuck without be able to start.\nBut still I did my best to have solid update system which just updates ShareX with single click. And that single click is needed to ask user if user wants to update right now or not. And to be honest I think ShareX updater is better than most of paid software updaters.\nAlso about frequency of updates, it is not good idea to punish users who waits for already fixed bug fixes just because few people annoyed by updates. If you don't like updates then you can disable update system in ShareX. Also it is not pleasant for me to see same issues keep getting reported every day when I was fixed it right after first time it is reported. Which is far more annoying than getting frequent updates from ShareX :)\n. @kp1993 Pomf destination in ShareX defaults to pomf.cat therefore no need to write custom uploader settings in https://pomf.cat/tools.html anymore, because it can confuse your users.\n. #923\n.

If Amazon S3 was free I would write it from scratch to not have external library dependency and support all custom hosts but I can't even try free trial of it because it end years ago.. If Amazon S3 was free I would write it from scratch to not have external library dependency and support all custom hosts but I can't even try free trial of it because it end years ago.. I checked my Amazon S3 account now and its free trial was end years ago but still I can use it for free not sure how.\nTherefore I'm trying to implement it from scratch now without use Amazon SDK but this v4 signature looks so overwhelmingly difficult. Amazon SDK source codes for signature creation is literally thousands lines of codes :(. Edit: I managed to fix signature issue now.. Now I wrote Amazon S3 implementation from scratch and also added custom server support like this:\n\nIt supports signature v4 currently.\nBut I don't have any custom server (with account) to test it. So I'm not even sure are there any servers which can work with Amazon S3 API without require any specific changes to current codes.\nI also couldn't test DreamObjects which was exists in previous implementation. Because it requires credit card to even register for trial account. So I sent email to their support and requested test account.. Amazon S3 specification require bucket name in sub domain. Otherwise how storage service gonna know what bucket it is?. I tested now, @deansheather your endpoint format works with v4 too. But I suspect it gonna solve @neurogas problem because he getting invalid signature which means his signature implementation must be different than what Amazon S3 API using.. That link shows how to use with AWS SDK library (I don't use library) and not tells anything about their specifications.. DreamObjects gave me account to test now and it worked on first try. Which shows that my Amazon S3 implementation don't have problem working with custom storage hosts. As long as those custom hosts support V4 signature..

Did you ever tried re opening 10.4? I'm pretty sure it is not to do with 10.4. Example Bitdefender tend to block ShareX randomly when opening and when you reopen it, allows it.\n. \"Unable to connect to the remote server\" this can means two thing either your computer blocks ShareX or server is actually down. So it can't be to do with ShareX.\n. Nothing changed in codes about uploading.\n. Re authenticate your login from destination settings.\n. Look like they did changes to oauth tokens today, maybe that causing this issues. But can't find any changes in API documentation. There is problem in their end I think.\n. According to API changes page: \"Changed access_token expiration from one hour to one month.\"\nBut even they changed expire time of token one month it actually still expire in one hour and because ShareX still sees one month left for it to expire from token expiry field, ShareX not trying to refresh it. So they need to fix it in their end.\n. What you suggesting is not good solution. Brute forcing refresh just in case their API have problem. What if this problem got solved in few hours? Then for no reason ShareX would be refreshing it a lot and slowing uploads when token is supposed to expire in one month.\nI emailed them yesterday to report this problem but I don't think they will reply because they were not replied to my previous 4 emails too. I'm not even sure are they reading my emails to be honest (I mean am I sending my emails to correct place?). But we will see.\n. I emailed api@imgur.com but got no response yet so I'm not sure are they receiving my emails or just ignoring them. Maybe someone known need to email them for them to notice it.\n. Imgur replied now they telling issue should be fixed now. Also they told this:\n\"You might get this error once more per logged in user, but after that it should be fine.\"\nSo you need to refresh your token one more time to get proper token. And after that need to wait one more hour to verify is it fixed.\n. They fixed it for new tokens so previous tokens we obtained before fix still gonna have this problem.\n. There can be another reasons for 403 too also refreshing key sometimes becomes invalid too. So it won't be good idea.\n. Also ignoring/hiding errors with workarounds can be problematic like we couldn't figure out that there is error in Imgur side and be able to report them to fix it.\nWhich would harm users alot because your workaround works: Upload, See error and refresh, re upload. Which would delay uploading a lot.\nNow users will have faster uploads because no more refreshing token every hour (every one month now).\n. New token is not expired after one hour so problem is fixed now.\n. How you can find that solution as logical when it was requiring you to upload same file two times and delay whole process alot? By the way my Imgur token still works fine after one week so I'm not sure how yours still not works.\n.

Not to mention in majority of errors Imgur actually not even returns proper json response. Also how am I supposed to implement them when I couldn't reproduce that error cases. Actually few days ago I tried to upload image to Imgur from their web site and I got Forbidden error, so Imgur experience so many issues in their web site too not just ShareX.\n. And it is not that quick fix I can't just check error message and refresh authentication. Like http web request not even returns response when error code is 403 so I handle error separately to show them later in error dialog (and If i skip this then I will lose all response, stacktrace etc. info after doing refreshing and retrying uploading etc. to reshow them and will make codes very uglier because of changes required in upload mechanism) but this need to be handled in upload process and so many other changes can be required for uploading because multiple uploaders using same things.\nSo I'm tired of everytime one uploader host having issues it comes to me always. What I coded was working properly for last 5 years and only issues was to do with Imgur. So if you don't like what I code then you can write your own.\n. http://api.imgur.com/changelog\nChanged access_token expiration back to confirm it wasn't causing extra load.    12/10/15\nLook like because of this again tokens expired. Interesting thing is making it expire every hour will cause more load so I'm not sure why they reverted it.\n. Can you report it in https://github.com/gpailler/MegaApiClient/issues ?\n. It is nearly impossible to reset history because it just appends entries to file without load it. Example my history still have 5 years old links (have total 24k links) and as you can guess I re open ShareX more than most of people with different versions. So I don't see how it can lose history every update. History don't even gets any changes for years.\n. Is there a way to reproduce this? Because even if it tells \"parameter is not valid\" it not always means actually that width or height is not valid.\n. Maybe this problem fixed with #1258 fix too.\n. Maybe you should sync your config file so in two different computer it will use same token? There is no reliable way to detect access token is invalid in all oauth supported uploaders. Because error message or code can change.\n. #702\n. https://streamable.com opens empty page for me?\n. https://streamable.com opens empty page for me?\n.

I mean seriously how you can go one project and use your own syntax rules ignoring that project rules?! So if I can find such issues in just first two files probably I can find hundreds issues in rest of them therefore I don't think it is gonna worth wasting my countless hours to check all diffs and reading that 13 page wall of text pdf. Because checking everything in this pull request can take atleast 4 hours and when it not contributing anything to ShareX like new feature or performance improvement I don't see point of wasting my time on it. Not to mention that this changes could have probably broken few things and I could miss them while checking. So when ShareX working properly I don't wanna risk breaking things with no benefit. I'm sorry but can't accept it.\nBy the way it is \"pull request\" not \"poll request\" :)\n.

Also those software even have GPU encoding support instead of CPU encoding like FFmpeg doing right now.\nShareX is screen capture software with desktop recording support and unable to do that hook stuff because it is beyond my knowledge unfortunately.\n.

How 11. upload check box gonna have hotkey then?\n. Customizable really? Are you have any idea how much difficult it would be.\n. By the way you know that you can make different hotkeys per that tasks in workflow right?\n. Added \"After upload\" tab now:\n\nand moved that \"Show ... window\" settings to main window menus.\n. Also your suggested hotkeys won't work because file name textbox have focus so when you press those buttons it will change file name.\n. If you gonna press multiple buttons to unfocus etc. why you don't just mouse click them which will be faster and not require memorizing shortcuts.\n. I think it is fixed now but can't verify because I don't have multi monitor.\n. ShareX web site have contact form also have IRC live chat link so I'm not sure how you were searching ages for a way to message us.\nShareX already supports many random naming options:\n\nShareX also supports SFTP, FTPS and FTP.\n.

And ofc there is obvious config for the path on the server otherwise how people can use it.\n. HttpHomePath setting in ftp settings is key to set it correctly. Also disable AutoAddSubFolderPath setting next to it. So you can write exact url path you want.\n. I already showed you with screenshot where that setting is. Are you want me to take screenshot of screenshot?\n. goo.gl not even works for any Dropbox link with any extension. So I can't find all cases it not supports.\n. Because API keys not included in repo you can't test it. But your regex not looks correct.\n. It checks locally:\n\nI can't check remotely because of massive amount of file destinations and everytime checking will delay uploading alot.

When you press stop button if FFmpeg not responding then ShareX tries to kill its process when clicked stop button again but then your OS not allowed ShareX to kill it.

Paint .NET ?\n. Paint .NET ?\n. Then you can right click that multiple files and create zip file. Then upload that zip file. This request is beyond scope of ShareX because I can't fill right click menu of Windows with personal actions.\n. You mean string to hash converter? Like string to md5, sha1, base64 etc.\n. Like this:\n\n. What do i call that tool then (was Hash check) after add these. Also what to name that second tab.\n. What is it to do with verifying?\n. I thought you telling second tab is for verifying.\n. Even when doing binary, base64 etc. conversation there is it good idea to still call it hash checker?\nAlso first tab makes more sense when it is called hash checker :(\n. What about these for tabs: \"File hash check\", \"Encode/Decode\" or \"Text conversions\"\n. \nStill not sure is tab or window name is correct too. Even my C# class name is horrible which is Translation because couldn't find better name for it back then when I made it :(\n. Is this checked?\n\n. Wrong url.\n. Are you uploading to imgur account?\n. Did you tried refreshing authentication?\n. Did you tried uploading that specific photo from their web site? If only that image not works.\n. What your browser to do with custom uploader?\n. Probably that place you trying to upload checks User-Agent which is ShareX and thinks that browser not supports javascript.\n. I don't even know where you trying to upload how am I supposed to check.\n. Then you need to fix your web site.\n. Check here\n\n. It works currently for me: https://gfycat.com/BeneficialFrigidAxisdeer\nCan you try again?\n. Yes it is exist like corruptnova showed.\n. As Scrxtchy told you must not give linux shell script as API link to people. Because everybody don't know that syntax and it is not very easy to read syntax.\nYesterday your web site was not giving valid link to uploaded file. Today it gives one link then it opens another link which require captcha and then it generates another link which downloads image so just to be able to see image I navigated 3 different links, wtf?\n. Where I got icons don't have more bigger size and obviously I can't draw my own icons for so many places because I'm not graphic artist.\n. Instead of checking portable it should check is selected path is inside where ShareX is started and possible to write as relative.\nLike if start path is D:\\ShareX and your CLI path is D:\\ShareX\\ShareX\\Tools\\ffmpeg.exe then because that second path starts with same path as start path then ShareX can remove that part from CLI path to make it relative.\nBut there is also relative path to back directories possible like in PortableApps it will be ..\\..\\Data\\Tools\\ffmpeg.exe which will make things more complicated. So not very easy to fix.\n. Did you checked is ShareX memory usage increasing alot when you start region selection? Is it filling memory?\n. I don't think anyone can do anything about OutOfMemoryException. Especially when ShareX don't have memory leak in region selection.\n. That mainly happens in two reason, either your firewall blocks ShareX or where you are trying to upload is down.\n. #1138\nSo I added workaround for it for next version.\n. History file is .xml so it is better for you to backup all files there except Screenshots and Tools folder. But ofc you could want to backup your screenshots too.\n. I can't test these things because I never have SFTP account. Therefore without try I can't fix it. Because it require me to see what SFTP library throws etc. when keyfile is missing.\n. If you mean I could just check file path before create connection. That is not solution. What if keyfile is exist but invalid? That means I need to rely on SFTP library exceptions to throw proper error message.\n. It should show error now I think.\n. That happens because webm not very efficient for real time encoding. I recommend using x264 which gives far better real time encoding performance.\n. Is retry option in application settings window not works for Twitter?\n. \n. Exactly same for me:\n\n. Exactly same for me:\n\n. Maybe monitor color profile issue?\n. There is nothing I can do about monitor color profile differences. Because .NET Framework not allows changing monitor color profile.\n. I fixed it now but for now you can make this setting true to make it work:\n\n. Try these:\n\nWith your own sample rate.\nhttps://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Audio-Options\n. You are copying file not image. Maybe you need to select copy image instead?\n. I tried copy image to clipboard now and I can paste image to both Paint and Paint .NET without problem. Where you trying to paste that image? That could be the problem.\n. Are you sure you configured your settings properly? Like URL or image file can override image itself.\n. I keep trying it is never empty. But it is not seen as image in few applications (like Skype).\nYou can revert to old image copy method which not supports transparency but works everywhere:\n\n. New clipboard format was already be able to copy to Windows 10 paint. Maybe problem in previous Windows paint? Yes this change came with 10.6.\n. It is not easy decision because I don't know how many software supports one format or not.\nDon't wanna disable transparency support just because few old software not supports it.\n. It is always there.\n. When I search clipboard skype in Google this is first result:\nhttp://getgreenshot.org/faq/how-can-i-paste-screenshots-into-skype/\nSo it not looks possible to do if transparency need to be supported. Unless Skype fix their clipboard support.\n. When that error happen ShareX supposed to refresh it in latest version. Is it possible you were using previous version?\n. #1049\n. #1237\n. Check screen recording options window for ffmpeg path.\n. I'm not web developer therefore can't add any setting to extension itself. Even then it will be complicated to have all destinations etc. in extension.\n. #1237\n. How ShareX can't upload to any site. If that was the case then countless issues would be opened by users. Also tried MediaFire and I can upload without problem. So can't reproduce your problem.\n. Unfortunately that setting not applies to video recording. And because you can set custom ffmpeg commands to change file name and also can use CLI stuffs too. It can be more complicated. But \"After capture window\" allows to set filename before uploading.\n. #92 #141 #1044\n. You have Copy file destination is selected.\n. You are uploading to wrong destination.\n. I can't know what is wrong without see response. Something is wrong in response.\n. That web site returns this:\n<br />\n<b>Warning</b>:  array_key_exists() expects parameter 2 to be array, null given in <b>D:\\www\\patifile.com\\httpdocs\\img\\app\\lib\\classes\\class.image.php</b> on line <b>930</b><br />\nSo it is not ShareX fault.\n. In both startup and after progress change it using same code: niTray.Icon = ShareXResources.Icon; to change tray icon so I don't understand how it works properly after screenshot is uploaded.\nAre you be able to compile and test this if I add manually getting correct icon size code?\nnew Icon(ShareXResources.Icon, SystemInformation.SmallIconSize);\n. Were you logged in to Dropbox? For some reason user ID is null. Not sure how that possible if logged in.\nTry to re login to Dropbox.\n. In destination settings window.\n. It already supposed to display user friendly message. Not sure how it didn't for you.\nErrors.Add(\"Dropbox login is required.\");\n. Look like this problem happens when EarlyCopyURL is true and Dropbox is not configured. I mean not showing correct error text.\n. ?\n. #1243 \nIt is fixed.\n. #1237\n. I tried with G502 to use \"alt+0\" and it works fine:\n\n. For some reason in some peoples computer when Windows shutdown, Windows never waits for ShareX to save settings. So there is nothing I can do about it. But I added in many places saving like when main window minimize to tray or close. Or when setting windows closing etc. So how you never minimize ShareX to tray all this time and it is unable to save?\n. #702\n. Unfortunately I can't reproduce.\n. If I can reproduce one problem it will be very easy to debug and fix. Now I have no idea how it never happens to me and happens to few people. I mean difficult to pin point issue and after fix be able to test is important too.\n. Oh I see it happens in second scrolling capture and need to change combine adjustments before that therefore I couldn't reproduce it.\nBy the way why you don't use ShareX screen recorder?\n. Released new version can you test?\n. That is weird in #1251 he was told it is fixed in high dpi but this time yours broken.\n. @vemacs I'm testing 150% DPI now and with both old and new codes it looks same:\n150%\nOld code: \nNew code: \nBut for 125% old code better:\n125%\nOld code: \nNew code: \nSo I'm not sure how old code was causing problems in your computer.\n. 200%\nOld code: \nNew code: \n. I don't understand what you mean.\n. I'm not planning to add auto archiving. Also it won't be possible to detect is multiple files selected when using Windows shell context menu upload or Windows send to menu anyway. Because those send files to ShareX one by one.\n. I can reproduce it too in Chrome.\n. For now you can use this to revert to old way:\n\n. Record shortcut is also works for stop it. But there is no shortcut for abort.\n. I can't just update without ask user. It can close ShareX suddenly when user trying to use it.\n. I already implemented this in Steam build by the way.\n. Qihoo-360 always shows that every release. Also it tells HEUR (heuristic) which is guessing system and anti virus is not certain about it.\n. There is already hotkey for it:\n\n. That means dll is corrupt. Reinstalling ShareX solves it.\n. Because installer must run as admin, installer unable to run ShareX as non admin.\n. I'm using InnoSetup.\n. I think I was added runas after few people reported they were having issues updating. So if I remove it now other people can open issue telling it is causing problem.\n. It was long years ago so I don't remember where it is now. And from that day nobody told anything about updating because it was working fine for everybody after add runas.\n. Removed runas, hopefully it won't create issue to people.\n. Now many people started to report admin run is required :( I knew this would happen when I remove it.\n. When I add admin to setup then people don't have admin access can't install it to outside program files.\n. I'm not planning to change setup script it will be alot of efforts, especially handling updating because first need to detect which installer used then uninstall it then install using new installer etc. so many complexity and possibility of something can go wrong because how ShareX can do these while its uninstalling etc.\n. > Shame that this isn't being taken more seriously as it is a significant issue.\nJust because I'm unable to fix it means I'm not taking it seriously? Do you think if I could fix it that I wouldn't?. > Shame that this isn't being taken more seriously as it is a significant issue.\nJust because I'm unable to fix it means I'm not taking it seriously? Do you think if I could fix it that I wouldn't?. It is just that easy, switch whole installer. Do you have any idea how much problems it can create switching installer or lack of features that new installer can have. Of course you won't care as long as it fixes your problem. When I wrote I'm unable to fix it I obviously implied by using current installer.. It is just that easy, switch whole installer. Do you have any idea how much problems it can create switching installer or lack of features that new installer can have. Of course you won't care as long as it fixes your problem. When I wrote I'm unable to fix it I obviously implied by using current installer.. By the way ShareX auto updater only runs installer as admin if ShareX was installed to program files. If you install ShareX outside of program files, for example to AppData folder then ShareX won't run installer as admin. That way after installation is complete, ShareX will auto run as current user.. I'm not planning to remove handy new features just because people want to use old version of VS.\n. Is this not what you want?\n\n. You need to solve this problem with your host other than you nobody would require such feature.\n. After capture menu there follows order of execution and you added it last when it was executing before uploading. Also there is already method in Helpers class for open file in explorer.\n. What you mean by highlight the taskbar? Only flashing once?\n. Highlighting will be enough too I guess for people to notice it.\n. You are adding .net library references to csproj also adding pl and cs language resx files when those are not completed.\n. Removed those cs.resx and pl.resx files now because those were not in use and never gonna be completed.\n. Thanks.\n. #716\n. #989 #689\n. Reason why I limited max scrolls because it is impossible to detect end of scroll in every single cases. Like if one web page have video running in bottom of screen then all checks will fail because all images taken never same as each other. And obviously not all windows supports detecting scroll position. So for pre caution I was added limit so it won't try to scroll forever and never be able to stop it. This is very rare case ofc. It mainly can detect end of scroll. But even for 1% chance I needed to take pre caution.\n. Also another reason to limit it to 100 was, checking each image and comparing them pixel by pixel is very time consuming and even having 100 scrolls can take more than minute to calculate. So it was not good idea to have very high amount of images to compare.\n. My message was to @xnite. Your issue is not even to do with this issue.\n. That would be very difficult to fix because that retry option works with all uploaders so it can't remember specific uploader settings which was entered in first try. If this were only Twitter uploader app then it would be very easy to fix.\n. Of course it is fixable but I just don't want ugly codes/workarounds.\n. Problem was ShareX_Chrome.exe was expecting older version of json library so updated it to use latest version.\nhttps://github.com/ShareX/ShareX_Chrome/commit/29467f488f484533dd4313cd7dd0d6a0baf10a56\n. Either I can upload fixed exe for you or you can wait for new release.\n. ShareX.zip\nExtract this to ShareX folder.\n. Need to check debug log or logs to see is saving fails.\n. Also are you sure it is not fallback system if your primary uploader is fails.\n. #1278\n. There is no setting to disable drag and drop upload. Because if you don't want to upload then why would you drag file to it?!\n. If you enable this:\n\nthen after capture tasks will be applied to drag n drop and you can just open editor with no upload option.\n. Updated image link.. Updated image link.. Your direct link opened gallery in first open too. In second open showed direct image.\n. If ShareX crash it will show error message box. Is it not shows anything?\n. I have no idea how it can crash without show any error window.\n. That means dll file become corrupt and need to be reinstalled.\n1049\n. I have no idea how it becomes corrupt randomly in some people computer. Something installed in users computer could be causing this etc. so there is no way I can figure this out.\n. https://github.com/ShareX/CustomUploaders/blob/master/pasteboard.co.json\n. Did you tried using video-screen-recorder video device. It can be synced properly.\n. That means dll file become corrupt and need to be reinstalled.\n1049\n. Problem to do with their server not ShareX. And even you telling it was working fine before and it not works anymore and nothing changed in ShareX.\n. That means dll file become corrupt. Reinstall ShareX to fix it.\n1049\n. > The remote server returned an error: (504) Gateway Timeout.\nMeans Imgur server related issue not ShareX.\n. Because I didn't made that FTP library I can't know what is wrong. But I think developers of that library can't do anything about it too because probably it just shows error server returns.\n. Program not tells that GDI tells that and Microsoft wrote it so there is nothing i can do about it.\nBecause there is no memory leak in rectangle capture in my tests.\n. Imgur API not allows uploading more than 10mb gif which makes majority of gifs fail to upload.\n. GIFs mainly atleast 10x more higher size than video also only 256 colors which means horrible quality also takes more time to encode. So GIF is bad in every single way so why would I make GIF default instead of x264.\n. Response shows problem not to do with ShareX: <title>301 Moved Permanently</title>\n. #822\n. Press M in region capture.\n. Can you give example flash content.\n. Having empty api key by default can cause issues to current users.\nMaybe atleast adding link to https://someimage.com/api to tell users how to get api key.\nAnother workaround can be if api key is empty then using default one exist in ShareX.\n. By the way if that labels tells you, that you can get API key from somewhere. Instead you could use link label control which would open API page when clicked on it.\nDirect URL default option is fine.\n. You could write something for me to know you updated it (that way i would receive email notification) but instead we waiting days.\n. I noticed now your resx changes (ShareX.UploadersLib/Forms/UploadersConfigForm.resx 8,683 additions, 12,223 deletions) broken some control sizes :(\nAre you using higher dpi Windows? For some reason when you work in form designer with high dpi then resx properties getting wrong sizes.\nThis is how it is now: \nThis is how it was before: \n. Because in 20000+ lines of resx changes I can't figure out whats wrong or not it is not possible for me to fix it manually therefore I'm forced to revert this commits unfortunately.\n. All turkish keyboards using ctrl and shift on them so I dunno how it is different in other countries.\n. Also you can't translate .NET Keys enum.\n. Using that won't allow me to do custom naming properly. Check HotkeyInfo ToString to see what I mean.\n. I did this on purpose for slow computers because drawing my own painting cursor could be laggy for them but hardware cursor always fast.\n. Most of the things not marked as invariant because everytime I edit something in designer those fields getting removed so it is useless to re add them every time because it will be removed again. I only re add them before release.\n. That error means library file become corrupt. Reinstall ShareX to fix it.\n1049\n. If owner of this website used latest pomf codes, response would include full link instead of only file name and we didn't have to change subdomain every single time.\n. You can fix it in your ShareX like this:\n\n. Why are you using old ShareX version?\n. You are using very old version this is why it is not exist in your ShareX.\nCan't you figure that out yourself after I ask why you are using old version?\n. I'm not planning to make improvements to Greenshot image editor in ShareX. It is already so much work to merge them and for long time I didn't merge it because of extreme amount of work needed to manually merge every single commit one by one. So I don't wanna also waste my time on adding features to it.\n. They don't use https for default web address. They don't also give https link in upload. Also API not gives https too. You need to use what API gives otherwise if they decide to remove https support in future that will make all uploads broken in ShareX.\n. If https was suggested by site then it will be redirected automatically like how GitHub and all web sites does.\n. Imgur supports https too but never returns https url in their API. It is not professional to use non default url formats because there is no guarantee it will always work in future.\n. \n. How it fails? Gives error?\n. It tells ShareX is up to date for me:\n\n. How can I try XP, nobody using XP in world anymore.\nDid you checked debug log for error?\n. I don't think this problem is to do with ShareX because normal update system and portable update system uses same codes and it works fine and nobody reported such thing before.\n. Use FFmpeg download button in ShareX to download latest FFmpeg version because this issue was fixed in latest versions.\n. You can automatically launch paint after capture using Actions.\n. You can only crop area not cut or duplicate.\n. #1023\n. #205\n. Tinypic codes not changed for long years so how this can be fault of ShareX?\n. Then you need to report this to Tinypic devs? Because for years it was not expiring and suddenly they changed it.\n. In your direct link you adding .jpg extension when it can be .png like this:\nhttps://i1.someimage.com/OJdYywZ.png\nWhy?\nEdit: Fixed it.\n. I was fixed it 3 weeks ago, new version will release soon.\n. Argg when I'm pressing close button it become reopen in same time.\n. I was fixed it :(\n. You can't upload to Dropbox without account. Was fixed it to give proper error message.\n. What is transliterate means?\n. I can't fix ffmpeg related issue. You can report it to ffmpeg issue tracker.. What is that saved image, fullscreen?\n. If it was region capture then without show region selection how it can trigger that i'm not sure.\n. Is it possible you were clicked tray icon once which opens region capture. Or if you middle click tray icon then it takes fullscreen ss.\n. It is false positive.\nI reported it as \"False alarm\" in here: https://newvirus.kaspersky.com/\nAlso HEUR means heuristic analysis which is just guessing system depending on patterns so it is mainly not accurate.\n. Got email response from Kaspersky:\n\n. This was fixed in latest Greenshot but merging changes too difficult I give up merging anymore. Because it require checking every single commits one by one for changes. Which can take whole day for me or even more because long time didn't merged :(\n. #1340\n. You can already use public or unlisted options. And spam is nothing to do with ShareX.\n. InnoSetup using same options you checked while installing, when doing install with -silent. So it is not possible for me to make option for it. It would be better ofc for InnoSetup to not execute any options while doing -silent install but can't find such setting in InnoSetup.\n. #1340\n. It is same issue with #1344 and to do with InnoSetup.\n. It is already exist called \"Actions\" in ShareX.\n. Open ShareX json config files search 5000 and replace it with lower number. Not sure how you managed to get wrong value too. Because this control not allows setting value 5000 because of max value limit.\n. I'm not sure how max limit become 2048 but it is not intended. Fixing it now.\n. Documents/ShareX\n. There is no AutoReconnectDelay in my json file how you found it.\nThere is no such code in ShareX too:\nhttps://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=AutoReconnectDelay&type=Code\n. That files have 2015 in date modified so you must be not saving setting there?\n. Search ImageSizeLimit check its value.\n. In your error:\nSystem.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: Value of '5000' is not valid for 'Value'. 'Value' should be between 'Minimum' and 'Maximum'.\nIt tells setting have value of 5000. How your json files won't have it.\n. Are you changing json when ShareX is not open?\n. In ShareX main window.\n. There is like 200+ numeric up down control assigns in project, sometimes I forget to add checks for unexpected values :(\n. Was using PropertyGrid for those settings before, now using proper controls for it.\n. By the way for Value of '37' is not valid for 'Value'. 'Value' should be between 'Minimum' and 'Maximum'. issue just decreasing magnifier size is enough no need to edit json file.\n. By the way for Value of '37' is not valid for 'Value'. 'Value' should be between 'Minimum' and 'Maximum'. issue just decreasing magnifier size is enough no need to edit json file.\n. That info box normally shows outside but because top side have no space for it, it moved to bottom.\nPress I button to hide it temporary then you can enable it later.\n. What if bottom have no space too? I can't do countless checks for every cases.\n. #314\n. Documents\\ShareX\\History.xml unless you changed personal folder.\n. #1346\n1344\n. Why did you edit readme.md without release it.\n. Yes why show something in readme without release it yet.\n. No, if you commit it will be added to this pull request automatically.\n. Thanks.\n. After capture tasks -> Show \"After capture\" window\nAfter capture tasks -> Show \"Before upload\" window\nAllows to change destination before upload.\n. In your first image ofc it will act as only quick task menu because in your selection you override rest of tasks.\nAnd in your second image there is no upload task so it can't show upload destination window.\nAnd after capture shows checked for me. But there is scroll bar issue.\n. By the way I added icons to this menu now:\n\nAutomatically uses proper icons.\n. TinyPic gives this link: http://i67.tinypic.com/4zuni9.png\nand it redirects to: http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=4zuni9&s=9\nSo what ShareX can do about it?\n. If you disable tray icon then it will exit with close button.\n. 99% of people using previous ffmpeg.exe\n. Your firewall or something in your computer blocks internet connection I think.\n. Why you don't use \"Show before upload window\" then?\n. I'm not planning to add such advanced mechanisms to capture. Because that feature will only benefit you and have no use for others.\n. Probably who opened #1332 would prefer to have these values on color picker form and there was no empty space in that form to put these values therefore I was not considered adding it.\nAlso you didn't even support this color in color picker format.\nSo currently it is pretty much not exist anywhere.\n. Are you using high dpi in Windows? Designer with resx support causing issues and changes so many things and breaks some of them for few users :( Especially if Windows is high dpi then it can break size or position of few controls. Even your resx contains default vs icon in form as base64 now which is bug because it was using ShareX icon before.\n. When i open this window I can't reproduce your error:\n\n. Why would you use Windows Vista?\n. #1350\n. %t and %pn not reaches custom uploaders so you can't use them as parameter. So I need to remove them from textbox auto complete menu.\n. No.\n. Are you thinking thoroughly what you suggesting? If I make all destinations \"none\" as default. Thousands of people would be stuck unable to figure out how to upload to Imgur...\nBy the way If you uploaded something to Imgur by accident, open history window and right click that image and open deletion url so it will be removed from Imgur.\n. #1350\n. #1350\n. #1350\n. Most of things outdated in README. Changing one line not makes difference. I need to update all of changes.\n. #1350\n. Press edit button and change them to whatever you want.\n. Your issue is same with #1344 but still i thought it would remember last install location and install there. Not sure how to make it remember when doing -silent install.\n. You can disable from Application settings -> Advanced tab.\n. Imgur works for me currently. It is fixed maybe?\n. Thanks.\n. Your issue fixed by #1406\n. I was removed it because of request from #1267\n. If I add this how can I test it?\n. If I add this how can I test it?\n. Yes use ShareX website contact form.\n. Yes use ShareX website contact form.\n. yes getsharex.com bottom right corner.\n. yes getsharex.com bottom right corner.\n. #1398\n. I was fixed this yesterday (6fbe9b591309c06daf48dabc4029297351441dfd). Until next version you can workaround it like this:\nOpen Documents\\ShareX\\ApplicationConfig.json file when ShareX is not open, search for \"RecentTasks\" remove items inside it and save.\nLater you can disable recent tasks feature from Application Settings.\n. I don't see point in such format when there is random alphanumeric which is far better security with less characters. Therefore I'm not planning to add it.. Added it now:\n. Are you using Steam? I would like to add you if then. Because talking in Steam will be more easier when need to ask many questions.\n. Are you using Steam? I would like to add you if then.

New version of FTP library was causing issues to people like uploading images half etc. therefore I was installed previous version of this FTP library maybe then your problem will be solved too.\nEdit: But now I checked your logs and your task is not even started yet so it can't be to do with FTP at all.\n. Did you checked Task manager is ShareX running?\n. Did you checked Task manager is ShareX running?\n. Is it possible .NET framework 4.0 missing? Did you tried removing Documents/ShareX folder.\n. Font 'Euphemia' cannot be found.\nYou must have selected this font then removed font from Windows.\n. I uploaded text to pastebin now and raw link not works:\nhttps://pastebin.com/raw/Cy16fath\nit redirects to non raw page.\n. \n. I added raw link support but none of those raw links open for me and shows captcha instead and then redirects to non raw.\n. Your example GitHub raw url was wrong. Response was including proper raw url.\n. But proper raw url not redirects. Your short url can cause problems if need to be used directly.\n. #1402\n. ShareX codes can't modify dll files. Not sure what could too.\n. It is not actually \"Upload\" button it just runs task using your \"After capture tasks\". So it is actually possible to only save.\n. Your report not makes sense because your error log have nothing to do with portable or install.\nBut SendSpace gives error when you upload file with no extension and no data in it. But it allows uploading file with no extension or file with no data but have extension. So it is their fault.\n. You mean ShareX icon not shows in tray bar too? Are you closing ShareX from tray menu?\n. It not make sense how even history won't save for you because it saves when screenshot is uploaded instead of other places like when ShareX closing. So restarting can't affect that.\nDuplicate of #702\n. If parsing of url fails or url is empty then it will fail. Then people can right click and check response (I fixed issue recently about that show response was not showing up for custom uploader).\n. It would be better if you can pull request all translation files together instead of one by one.\n. Are you doing force push or what, how you removing those without commit? This way you make me check whole diff every time instead of little commit.\n. I was not updated uploaders related stuff days how you have so many resx and designer conflicts.\nEdit: Your conflicts from 11+ days ago. So isn't then this is your responsibility to fix conflicts because you waited alot to commit this.\n. You can add it yourself from here:\n\n. You mean this request #1189 broken your behavior?\n. @thijsa there is no settings ui for it in ShareX but you can change that behavior from GreenshotImageEditor.ini file.\nChange this line to False: MatchSizeToCapture=False\nMaybe I should make simple settings window.\n. \n. \n.

I added DpiAwareness to app manifest: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX/app.manifest#L6\nI wonder if people have .NET Framework 4.7.1 installed in their system, is this config will be used for HDPI support because .NET 4.7.1 is in-place update for .NET 4.6.2 (which is what latest ShareX version gonna use).\nAnother reason I'm suspecting this because when we are using .NET 4.0 which not supports TLS 1.2, if people had .NET 4.5 or higher is installed then ShareX could use TLS 1.2.\nIf you would like to try it, because I don't have high dpi monitor for testing.

Yes.\n. Why don't you just use random alphanumeric, it is better. I don't see point of base64 when there is alphanumeric.\n. Current behavior is better I think because if my upload fails that means that destination have problem so I will change destination then right click and do upload. If it uploaded to same destination then it would give error always and would have no point. \n. Enabling this will allow clipboard upload to use after capture job:\n\nBefore I was enabled this setting by default but then users keep telling why their clipboard upload not works because \"After capture tasks\" have upload is disabled in their configuration. Therefore I needed to make this setting false by default.\n. May I ask why would you use such colors? It looks horrible to be honest.\n. In many places I set form background as white because default color gray was not looking good. Just for 0.01% of people gonna use high contrast theme, am I need to make 99.99% of people to get bad background colors in form? That not looks logical to me.\n. I'm trying high contrast mode now and it is like torture to my eyes. I wonder what kind of eye issues cause this mode to be helpful.\nExample custom colors becomes problem in this mode because I was set custom highlight and selected colors like this:\n\n\nProbably it won't be possible to find good equivalent in SystemColors.\n. I noticed there is problem in .NET menu item controls that check tick icon not uses proper color therefore it is not possible to see tick icon to understand which one is checked:\n\n. One by one I checked every form to be sure all colors correct but I could of missed few of them.\nAlso that tick icons still not visible in menu because of .NET problem not to do with me.\nAre you have Visual Studio, to be able to test changes?\nBy the way reason why I was using custom colors before (mainly white for background) because in old Windows versions those system colors was more darker gray, in Windows 10 little more close to white color so no need to use custom colors anymore.\n. You can't compile with VS2013 because new C# features require VS2015.\n. Your link is not what we need I think.\nI asked this in here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36520748/net-toolstripmenuitem-check-tick-not-visible-in-high-contrast-theme\n.

Now Microsoft fixed check mark issue in high contrast: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/retargeting/4.6.2-4.7.2#accessibility-improvements-in-windows-forms-controls\n\nToolStripMenuItem controls with their Checked property set to true now render the associated check mark in a contrasting system color. Previously the check mark color was not contrasting enough and not visible in High Contrast themes.\n\nIf you have .NET Framework 4.7.2 is installed then checked state should show up correctly with latest ShareX dev build.. Was ShareX giving any error or incorrect behavior without your changes?\nAlso why you added CharSet.Unicode to few things which don't even use string anywhere in function.\nI suspect any of your changes will make any difference.\n. Why drag if you don't want it to upload?\n. This will allow that:\n\nBut then you will require to disable upload from after capture tasks which can be problem for normal capture.\n. Ctrl + C copies URL or file path currently.\n. Adding tips to main window now so people can see all hidden stuffs:\n\nShift + C to copy file maybe?\n. Press Q in region capture.\n.

I told \"Check IE proxy settings\".\nBut still I must fix that even if hostname is invalid still it should not give error. But how you have invalid hostname in proxy settings not sure. Because never encountered someone have such issue.\n. You mean it could be fixed.\n. It is not exactly issue, it was designed that way. And will require alot of change to accomplish it in screen recording. Because need to pass those data to so many functions, which can get ugly.\n. About window not shows dev build. You didn't read my link properly.. You need to use automatic way from that link. You are doing manual way there.. I was talked with pull requester in Steam this is why that pull request have no comment in it.\nAbout test cases, it will require insane amount of test cases like thousands of them and most of them will be difficult to test. Because I'm working in this project currently alone, I can't also handle making test cases. Also I never used unit testing before so don't have much knowledge about these stuffs. But I know mainly big companies who have more than one person working on project do these kind of things, because they have money to hire more programmers. I'm already overwhelmed working alone.\nSo currently I have no plan to add unit testing.\n. Problems I encountered in annotation codes, I don't think will be possible to write unit test for them. So I won't like you to waste your time on adding test cases which probably won't gonna help me find issues. Best way to find issues is having beta releases. But with GitHub releases it becomes problem because I can't upload beta to releases section.\n. Capture -> Auto capture can take screen capture with intervals.\n.

So I suspect it happens after their PC shutdown non clean (blue screen, electricity issue etc.) which causing library to become corrupt.

I know it will be very handy but It will be alot of efforts for me unfortunately. Because people want to change hotkeys in so many other places too not just region capture.

I'm having big trouble finding way to add pen drawing without decrease fps a lot. Even if you don't use pen still just having support for it also decreases normal region capture fps.

I'm not even sure are you talking about region capture or are you using multi region mode.\n. I can't reproduce your problem. Invisible window or something like this could be staying top of your windows, so not sure. Is hover region not shows before you click that there is something wrong?\n. Can you record video to show it?\n. Why you didn't use ShareX screen recorder so I could watch it from web site without download flv file. (Not for now, I already downloaded it)\n. This is so weird, can you try disabling multi region mode from right click -> options and try again.\n. ShareX screen recording far more easier. Records with single key, then automatically uploads to puush.\n. Right click in region capture then options in bottom.\n. Then why you were double clicking?? When it is disabled just single click enough to capture hover areas.\n. So when you single click it works fine?\n. This is again weird because after first click it triggers capturing so how you have time to do double click before it even closes lol. I can't even reproduce it because impossible to double click in same frame.\n. Select \"Region: Rectangle\" from right click menu and draw region to capture. If you are using multi region mode then you need to double click after add multiple rectangle regions.\n. When you uncheck this:\n\nis problem solves?\n. #689\n. #1615\n. You were probably using removed Region (Annotate) method. And hotkey method of it reset to None because that method not available anymore.\n. #1112\n. Tinypic api not changed for long years and I'm pretty sure this must be problem in their end. So I can't do anything about it.\n. Unfortunately I don't like using external libraries. As you can see there is countless uploaders in ShareX and I could easily use each of these services official .NET libraries (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox etc.) but still decided to write everything myself. I mean if I used external libraries in each uploader then ShareX would have more than 40 uploader library atleast. Your Azure implementation requires 6 different libraries, so it is not acceptable for me. Sorry.\n. Amazon S3 was implemented without external library here: #83\nBut later to support new regions of Amazon he instead decided to use external library here: #636\nand even I didn't like using external library had no choice other than accepting it to support new regions and DreamObjects support.\nSo if first implementation in #83 used external library I wouldn't have accepted it too.\n. @dannoe:\nIf I didn't have good reasons I wouldn't be against using external libraries for uploaders.\n- Each uploader can require many libraries which all of them using their own http request classes etc. which makes using same uploading settings difficult like how ShareX sets user agent, sets proxy, reports progress with exact same info, error reporting method, be able to stop uploading and all other web request settings used. Not in all libraries you have full control on it.\n- Even single uploader library can be more than 1mb and having 50x uploader it can easily exceed 50mb when ShareX smaller than 5mb.\n- Most important reason is startup time will slow alot. No you can't lazy load them. ShareX will have reference to setting files exist in most of libraries to be able to load settings. Not to mention other things can be required other than settings while loading too. And because these uploader libraries mainly huge it will be far more slower to load them in memory because msil doing compiling in background.\nSo both performance, size and quality of software can decrease greatly. I could be always lazy and use built in libraries too but instead I worked hard and implemented all uploaders myself. So I expect same thing from pull requests too.\n. After change icon size to 32, re opened image editor it was still 32. Also restarted ShareX still it was 32px. Not sure why it not saves for you.\n. I didn't aware of such parameter because it is not documented anywhere. I can add setting for it.\n. But I don't know how to test this because only from specific referrer they redirect.\n. I uploaded image to imgur now and added ?noredirect end of it and tweeted it. When I opened that link first time from twitter still it redirected. So noredirect parameter does nothing.\n. I didn't remove anything? It must be using same location you set in setup.\n. I tried to download it worked for me. Can you try again because few days ago they were doing changes on URL. So it could be temporary down.\n. Comma is in wrong place, previous line should have it not last line.\n. #1040\n. Reason why I didn't add raw bytes upload support because more than 99% of uploader hosts supports proper multi part upload support. UI don't have empty space to add new settings so not gonna worth adding it just for few (like 2 or 3) weird uploaders which not supports proper way to upload.\n. I redesigned custom uploader UI to create more space and added body type option now which also includes binary body type:\n. Something in your computer must be causing this, not to do with ShareX.\n. No idea, nobody reported this issue before.\n. There is no API. You must write your own program/script for such things.\n. ShareX already remembers last region. If you mean you know that it have last region capture hotkey but you don't want to capture it but just have it selected. Then I don't have plan to add it.\n. If Doom not let other applications receive hotkeys then ShareX can't do anything about it.\n. (500) Internal Server Error means problem in their end. I tried uploading now it uploaded without problem.\n. I'm not owner of that website. If they give error when big size gif uploaded what can I do?\n. #1635\n. This is not bug. Corruption happened in part of your History.xml file. Open your History.xml file check line 26507 and remove invalid lines. That way your file won't be lose completely. This is why I only append data to that file so if something bad happen in your pc (or hard disk) still your previous data will be intact.\n. #1631\n. #1623\n. I was using this method:\nclient.OpenWrite(remotePath)\nI should have used:\nclient.Open(remotePath, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write)\nor\nclient.Create(remotePath)\ninstead maybe?\nReason why I'm asking because I don't have SFTP therefore I can't test it.\n. Verified fix works.\n. How am I supposed to know is folder is open already? Because there is countless windows explorer alternative and just checking process name and window title won't be enough. So it is not accomplish able.\n. @dannoe it only works for Windows Explorer what about other explorers?\nI mean other explorers won't even open if I use that method.\n. I'm guessing that other file managers must have dummy executable or something to run their own file manager when explorer.exe is run, no? I didn't try but if that was not the case many people would have come and report here that folder not opens.\n. Okey then I will use your method.\n. If you tested it already you can pull request it.\n. #1615\n. #820\n. There is problem in this approach: Process.Start(folderPath);\nWhen folder path is this: D:\\Dev\\GitHub\\ShareX\\ShareX\\ShareX\\bin\\Debug\\ShareX\nIt actually running: D:\\Dev\\GitHub\\ShareX\\ShareX\\ShareX\\bin\\Debug\\ShareX.exe\nWhich causing this issue: #1950\n. As solution I'm planning to do this:\nfolderPath = folderPath.TrimEnd('\\\\') + '\\\\';\nWhich adds \\ to end of path if path not contains it already. That way it will be explicit that it is folder path and not file.\nUnless you have better idea?\n. Need to add \"...\" to these buttons because there is dialog now.\n. Look like it is not possible to change its color. Don't know why they didn't made it changeable.\n. It is impossible for us to know why it doesn't upload for you.\nOne guess is, maybe it is disabled in after capture tasks menu.\n. \n. In my first message I was already wrote:\nOne guess is, maybe it is disabled in after capture tasks menu.\n. I suspect there is possibility to fix that. I don't think any screen recorder be able to capture it properly too, is it?\n. Yes it is in right click menu: Border size.\n. #1544\n. I was added generic sorting support to list view control and was enabled that option in history window. So it actually don't knows it is date time.\n. @dannoe I saw your implementation, it was not good because you were doing date time parsing instead of getting DateTime from object which stored in ListViewItem.Tag.\n. Parsing 30k date time will slow down it alot I bet.\n. No.\n. ShareX not supports game capture (DirectX/OpenGL).\n. Imgur returns right now:\n{\"data\":{\"error\":\"Imgur is temporarily over capacity. Please try again later.\"},\"success\":false,\"status\":500}\nIf Imgur upload fails, it is nearly always problem in their end. But of course sometimes users computer (or internet connection) could be causing issues too.\n. I'm not sure is it good idea. Example .hs (default extension used by hastebin) must have probably generic syntax highlighting and ShareX using .txt for clipboard text upload etc. so it can remove syntax highlighting. This can apply for invalid extensions too. And I don't have list of extensions hastebin supports. So it is not that easy as using filename extension.\n. But still added it because better than always having .hs. And using configured extension if file extension is .txt.\n. I wonder why their website automatically use .hs as default.\n. This is difficult to implement because I just can't do:\nif (Manager.IsProportionalResizing)\n{\n    EndPosition = CaptureHelpers.SnapPositionToDegree(StartPosition, EndPosition, 90, 45);\n}\nDepending on which node you dragging anchor will change therefore it will be more complicated.\n. Managed add this now: https://jaex.getsharex.com/2017/11/fCcqp36cBm.mp4. (500) Internal Server Error means problem not to do with ShareX.\n. #374\n. Your error tells: Font 'Arial' does not support style 'Regular'.\nSo it is to do with font.\n. Something in your computer already registered Print screen hotkey and ShareX unable to register it. So something else in your PC flashing your cursor not ShareX.\n. You can change screen recording hotkey destination to streamable.\n. That would require having hosting to store peoples settings and not to mention I'm not web developer so it won't be possible to write it. And most of peoples won't like their account info to be stored in cloud which will be security threat.\n. It could be .NET Framework related problem. Try reinstalling .NET Framework 4.0\n. @suoba #1615\n. \n. ShareX support customization of FTP output path fully so you can use subdomain.\nAlso supports file naming support with more pattern than your examples.\n. You don't write which destination you trying to upload. If it is Imgur then it was giving this error to me right now:\n{\"data\":{\"error\":\"Imgur is temporarily over capacity. Please try again later.\"},\"success\":false,\"status\":500}\n. Capturing with double click in effect mode was actually bug and I was fixed it in this release.\nIt also was canceling capture when double clicked when there is no region at all which was also bug.\n. We talking about same thing. Most people won't have your issue because by default window hover capture is active therefore when people double click outside it will select something outside. And double clicking on top of effect was not triggering capture.\nActually when I disable window capture in previous version, double clicking outside was giving error. Which was also fixed in current release.\n. Ignoring single click would require waiting for double click time for each single click action which would delay action and will be annoying.\n. Documents\\ShareX\\ApplicationConfig.json\n. I don't remember how url should be to show placeholder text.\n. I checked codes now it is actually not completely wrong about being host. It adds http:// automatically if it is missing. It also adds remote.php automatically to end of url. So just having host example.com is enough for some cases but if your owncloud is in separate folder such as owncloud (Not 100% sure about is this depending on folder or not) then host label not suits in this case. Also giving placeholder text won't make sense too because it can be different path in other people.\nI mean if I wrote \"URL\" instead of \"Host\" then people could write:\nexample.com/remote.php\nwhen only\nexample.com\nrequired.\nNote: When implementing owncloud I didn't have any host etc. to test it. So not sure about default paths etc.\n. #1350\n. Open D:\\ShareX\\UploadersConfig.json and D:\\ShareX\\HotkeysConfig.json one of it must have 39.\n. You searching in Documents but your folder in D:\\\n. I figured it is ultraimg later, this is why I was edited my previous message.\nYou don't need to ping me, GitHub still sends me email for each issue message.\nIt should be max 35.\n. #205\n. #756\n. #205\n. Red mainly means \"Stop\": https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=stop&tbm=isch\nSo making abort button red can be confusing for some people.\n. There is difference in Greenshot buttons, both buttons there red. But you want abort button red, stop button black.\n. I have configuration like this:\n\nThen copied: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/issues/1732\nand tried clipboard upload both from main window and hotkey and result was:\nhttp://bit.ly/2afcQpJ\nSo not sure what is different in your settings.\n. Which URL you trying? Maybe it is caused by url.\n. Nothing in debug log to give hint?\n. I don't understand what you trying to do. ShareX not monitors clipboard. Also not sure what you mean by \"where i create\".\n. #1350\n. There is no built in way in .NET framework to handle color profiles. It will require using external library such as http://www.imagemagick.org which is high size and also will require to use .NET wrapper library for it. So I won't like to use external libraries and increase ShareX size alot for color profile support.\n. It is for WPF apps.\n. When I added auto updating, I thought Windows was cleaning old files from Temp folder automatically but later learned it need to be cleaned manually like this:\n\nAs a solution I will save setup files to Temp/ShareX folder and in ShareX startup check for that folder and delete it if it is exists.\n. Yes:\n\n. @gpailler\n. This change not included in 11.4.1. I merged codes after release.\n. #1350\n. You can record sound if you install this:\n\nIt is not possible to pause recording.\n.

I tried it yesterday and it was not creating folder in Documents.\n2. Majority of people (like more than 95%) downloads ShareX to auto upload. So default settings should suit to majority of peoples use case, because some people can't even figure out how to enable uploading if I disable uploading by default. Also in first upload ShareX warns users and asks for disabling it or not.\n3. Because tools using settings from ShareX settings files I'm not planning to separate tools.\n.

Because .NET Framework 4.5 not supports Windows XP and there is far more XP users than custom uploader with TLS 1.2 users. So it is for greater good. In case you gonna tell people should upgrade their OS then, but not everyone have choice for it, for example so many jobs (especially in poor countries) still using Windows XP in their work. Not to mention not everyone have money to upgrade their OS or have good computer. Also doing .NET Framework update while doing ShareX auto update can be problematic both implementing and testing. And many people won't be happy about downloading and waiting for new .NET Framework installation, especially if they have slow internet connection. And coding wise there is nothing useful to me from .NET Framework 4.5 which gonna worth it update anyway. So currently staying in .NET Framework 4.0 have more benefits than upgrading and majority of software devs agree with me and even using more older versions of .NET Framework therefore.\nBut of course eventually I will upgrade, because Windows XP usage rapidly decreasing.. There is workaround to use TLS 1.2 with .NET Framework 4.0 but .NET Framework 4.5 or higher must be installed in your system:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/28286086/default-securityprotocol-in-net-4-5/34009938#34009938\nIt worked without problem in my Windows 10 when testing custom uploader which only works with TLS 1.2.\n. @Phoenix09 reason why I didn't wanted to use that solution because it had risks in some situations.\nLike how this guy not recommends using it: http://stackoverflow.com/a/28333370/264877\nBut now I noticed that it throws specific exception when trying to set not exist security protocol type. Because normally when you use invalid enum value still it will set without throw exception but in here it doing checks when setting it. I was thought it would allow to set not exist security protocol and when user try to do upload then user will get exception because of invalid value. But because of exception when setting enum value we can easily handle it and value stays as default. Also because of this no need to check registry to figure out is .NET Framework 4.5 or higher version is installed. Which could be another problem because rarely registry values could be not exists in locations where it should be for incorrect .NET Framework installations.\nBut I'm still worrying about unintended consequences can happen which I'm not aware yet. Especially when new .NET Framework versions release.. Using .NET Framework 4.6.2 in project now. RIP Windows XP and Vista users :(. Thanks.\n. Is there specific reason you made api key textbox disabled? Because people could just copy it from http://uplea.com/api page instead of login from ShareX. Also now you can't logout (which means removing api key).\n. Logout option will be misleading. Just need to make api key section editable so people can clear it theirself.\nAlso there is no reason to store username and password in config. Because only api key is required.\n. Why are you adding link, people can already login inside ShareX.\n. Why are you adding link, people can already login inside ShareX.\n. I meant that it could be optional way not only way. Also there is no reason to store username and password after login and received api key.\n. I meant that it could be optional way not only way. Also there is no reason to store username and password after login and received api key.\n. #1615\n. I think reason why I excluded it because then continue button can nonstop open that menu.\n. Now I remember why it is not supported. Because after capture tasks executed in same order that it is listed. When you select task with \"show quick task menu\" it will open that menu without execute other tasks so it will non stop open menu without execute rest of stuffs. So it is not possible to make what you requested happen.\n. Now I remember why it is not supported. Because after capture tasks executed in same order that it is listed.

Look from bright side you won't need to click 4 times to check 3 different task and then continue. Also after capture tasks window is close to what you want anyway.\n. Look from bright side you won't need to click 4 times to check 3 different task and then continue. Also after capture tasks window is close to what you want anyway.\n. WTF is Sharx...\n. You can't mistype 3 times in a row. He obviously don't even know name of software he using. If people don't even bother to read their software name why would I bother implementing something? Not to mention file field already contains file name so it is pointless to also supply file name second time in arguments. So I closed it because there was no reason to implement it. Just I didn't bother writing reason of closing.\n. I did not refuse his idea because he didn't wrote software name correctly. I told you in my previous message that file field already contains file name so there is no reason to also write file name to arguments second time. Are you have reading disorder too?\n. #1893\n. Your link was containing invalid character ' therefore I committed updated link.\n. #1532\n. I wonder why this pull request contains 13 commit when you were only did one commit for latest changes.\n.

Because it is not ShareX code, there is no way for me to fix it unfortunately.\n. Probably Imgur was down temporarily.\n. Probably Imgur was down temporarily.\n. It is not easily possible.

Maybe key type you are using not supported in SFTP library? https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET\n. I still wonder which dynamic assembly causing this? Because I can't reproduce it.\n. That was question by the way.\n. If game works as admin then it is limitation of hotkey system that non admin app can't receive hotkey input from admin app. It also can be that game not letting hotkey to reach ShareX. So in any case there is no way to fix it with this hotkey system.\n. That error looks to do with file path not url and it is limitation: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1880321/why-does-the-260-character-path-length-limit-exist-in-windows\n. ShareX uses last section in URL as file name so it is file path.\n. If something changing in background how am I supposed to know where to stitch screenshots? Because two images won't match.\n. Keeping track of scroll position very rarely works because there is so many situations scroll bar can be custom one and I'm unable to get its position. Not to mention rendered stuffs not always need to match scroll bar position correctly. So it is impossible to rely on scroll bar position when stitching stuffs.\n. You can't copy URL with file name together.\n. Did you tried this app: http://screentogif.codeplex.com/\nMaybe it can do exactly what you want.\n. I'm not planning to add gif editing related features because even for user it can be simpler but coding it can be too much work. But also another reason is ShareX using FFmpeg to record animated gif and not creating itself.\n. Did you encountered any problem in converted app?\n. I was just about one click away to pay it, what you mean voucher?\n. Well I went to bank in 01:00 am just to be able to pay for this now, so I better pay it :P\nIf you told it before I go to bank then I would accept it :(\n. In billing email it tells I bought \"Windows and Windows Phone yearly developer registration\" (in my language)\nWhat it means \"yearly\"?\n. There was no info about it being yearly in registration pages, so I have no idea why it tells yearly in billing result email.\n. This is what I got in email (translated it to english):\n\n. Yes.\n. I sent message to Microsoft support to verify is it outdated name.\n. All these years I didn't bought Microsoft Dev account and right after buy it you guys keep telling me ways to get it free :(\n. I don't want donation. I just want to solve these problems:\n. I didn't.\n. >Cleanup All: Deletes all expanded base images, removes any temporary converter files, removes the container network, and disables the optional Windows feature, Containers.\nMaybe this can fix it because this problem happened right after expand base image. But I can't even manage to run exe to be able to give parameter to it. Just because it is Windows Store app so many access problems etc.\nAnd of course uninstalling just app not removes those stuffs and I have no idea where those are stored.. After try to figure out why it fails for many days, I gave up.. Now I was reinstalled Windows 10 and this time desktop bridge worked properly.\nBut I noticed there is problem in desktop bridge, it checks this C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\x64 folder for MakeAppx.exe but Visual Studio 2017 was already installed Windows SDK stuffs and standalone Windows SDK setup was telling \"Features installed on this computer are up-to-date\". Then I noticed those stuffs actually stored inside: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\bin\\10.0.15063.0\\x64 folder so I just copied x64 folder to previous folder path and it worked. So desktop bridge was not aware of new Windows SDK paths.\nCurrently in my testing appx ShareX could even be able to detect custom personal path from user appdata folder and be able to use configured setting files from another drive.\nBut implementing this tab gonna be very difficult:\n\nWe can set startup auto run in manifest file but it is crucial for this setting to be configurable by user from UI therefore not sure how to accomplish that.. I keep having a lot of trouble for example right now when I read C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\ShareX\\PersonalPath.cfg it returning zeros. Therefore ShareX gives error on startup.. I'm migrating %localappdata%\\ShareX\\PersonalPath.cfg to Documents\\ShareX\\PersonalPath.cfg in desktop builds as solution. So Windows Store build can access or change them.. By the way sharing test builds can be problem because of self signed certificate.\nBut I need testers for Windows Store build. Currently I'm not sure am I missing something which not works in Windows Store build.. I'm gonna use this option in Windows Store:\n. I'm gonna use this option in Windows Store:\n. Currently I'm stuck at store listing section because it require a lot of english text and image making. So didn't put to store yet.. Currently I'm stuck at store listing section because it require a lot of english text and image making. So didn't put to store yet.. I sent it to Windows store today and waiting for it to show up. And I can give beta keys after that.. By the way you can get latest info about its status from ShareX Discord server. I will also send beta keys there because with direct message it will be easy.. \nI'm giving beta keys to anyone request in ShareX Discord server now.. Released on Windows Store now: https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh4z1sp. In this default window size:\n\nHow you can suggest me to add preview vertically as default, I'm failing to understand. If I add that then there will be empty space for like 2 or 3 rows to be visible. Your suggestion only makes sense when people make ShareX window height very big like in your ss and it is very rare case.\n. #1937 because of this setting.\n. Are you using ShareX 11.3.0?\n. Try 11.3.0\n. #1797\n. I have no idea what is ShellExperienceHost. ShareX just adds menu entry using simple registry entry. Not using any shell COM stuffs. So I don't think it is ShareX fault.\n. How you assume I didn't try already? I selected 10 file and all uploaded successfully.\n. It is replaced with \"Region: Freehand\", you can hold shift to draw direct lines.\n. Unnecessary change?? Polygon capture was inheriting region capture form before and now region capture form nearly rewritten from scratch to support all these annotation tools and polygon form can't inherit it anymore to get same behaviors. Are you really thinking it is that easy to bring it back.\nI will fix that initial shift drag issue.\n. Also -the capture custom region task no longer works.\nI created hotkey with custom region and configured custom region. It captures correctly. How to reproduce your issue?\n. Did you configured custom region from here:\n\nIf I could add point to point polygon in new region capture system I would, but there is many complications.\n. Isn't this setting already uses it?\n\n. I changed it because many people found it frustrating: #1778\nNow I'm adding toolbar menu for tools maybe it can be helpful for you to navigate between tools:\n\n. There is many reasons why I didn't add video destination and I wrote reason of it many times in previous issues. It have complications because video destination can be both image uploader and file uploader so it can't exactly fit video destination.\nThere is solution to your problem too, edit your screen recording workflow to upload to Streamable that way only recording will upload there.\n. I never manage to stuck in Preparing status before so not sure how to reproduce your issue.\n. #1615\n. #1778\n. I tested uploading now and it uploads successfully using custom uploader: http://i.pi.gy/67RW.png\n. Merging this issue with #596. #1615\n. Without have 2k photo in my album I can't know what response it returns to fix and test it.\n. It could be removed from server but CloudFlare still showing it from cache.\n. You need to use Actions in Task settings window to use your own image editors.\n. You must have enabled this setting:\n\n. @tx-trainwreck just use %1 without -FileUpload\n. Maybe need \"%1\" ?\n. Is your web site only allows TLS 1.2?\n. #1868\n. It tells connection is blocked so nothing I can do about it. IPC used for single instance support and CLI uploads. So those features can't work. But normally it should handle that error and still run, is it shows error message box?\n. I thought problem was to do with firewall blocking IPC connection therefore I was told \"nothing I can do about it\". But @campbeb was implemented single instance system so he knows how it works better than me.\n. Are you trying to capture directx fullscreen game?\n. #848\n. Must be this issue: #1915\n. Few months ago I wanted to add it and couldn't find much info about how to implement it.\n. It talks about XAML which means probably require UWP app.\n. Oh wow nobody reported all this time this issue :D\n. I'm not sure why this needed for.\n. I already dispose every single one of them (if I don't miss) but this TranslatorHelper.cs file was from my oldest project which I was made before ShareX and I was just copy pasted it to ShareX, this is why it had bad code left in it I guess.\nHow you managed to find it too? Are you have helper Visual Studio addon which can find not disposed IDisposeable codes or something?\n. http://www.viva64.com/en/inspections/\nWe are friendly to open-source projects. We do our best to let their authors know about defects we find and grant them temporary free licenses for our tool if necessary.\nMaybe we should contact them and request free license.\n. #1800\n. There is no such thing as lossy PNG.\n. But I saw few people had issues with color changes caused by their monitor color profiles.\n1236\n. Are you seriously thinking am I didn't think about adding pause button. It is first thing will come to mind if you adding screen recording support...\n. #205\n. 1. Why you don't show example image so I see how blurry it is.\n2. It is not possible.\n. Original one looks proper size why you scaling it 80% down?\n. That image looks same size as no dpi and 80% one looks smaller than how it is supposed to look.\n. That image looks same size as no dpi and 80% one looks smaller than how it is supposed to look.\n. Why your profile looks deleted? I needed to link it in change log.\n. I couldn't manage to make focus support in custom controls because it is more difficult than expected: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2362975/264877\n. Those are not custom controls.\n. Delay runs before open region capture because it applies to all screen capture stuffs. Problem is I can't make it work after select region because region capture freezes screen and crops image from it, so it can't work later.\n. ShareX won't hide all open programs.\n. Did you tried changing hotkey? Maybe something in your pc intercepting that hotkey.\n. Nobody reported such bug before. Not sure how it is possible.\n. I don't use skype.\n. ShareX?\n. I took 10 active window screenshots which uploads to Dropbox while pinging:\n\nAnd nobody reported ShareX disconnects any network activity before. Not sure how it can with simple web request using .NET Framework functions.\n. So I suspect something wrong in your end.\n. #1868\n. #1338 this issue I think.\n. #1338 this issue I think.\n.

Now I opened returned mp4 link and it automatically redirected to gifv link.\n. One of the reason why I didn't add auto renaming to not replace file because then each upload needed to check is file exists which would slow down uploading process and not preferable.\n. One of the reason why I didn't add auto renaming to not replace file because then each upload needed to check is file exists which would slow down uploading process and not preferable.\n. There is also another reason that \"early url copy\" option won't work with it. Because this option copies url before upload start. But when file exists detected it will require new name so that early copied url will be invalid.. There is also another reason that \"early url copy\" option won't work with it.

Portable auto updater not updates ShareX it just opens link to zip download file.\n. Portable auto updater not updates ShareX it just opens link to zip download file.\n. I downloaded previous version portable, it asked for update, pressed yes, it opened https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/releases/download/v11.3.0/ShareX-portable.zip in browser.\nSo it works as intended.\n. Is where you gonna save images changes frequently?\n. How you can give file name when its image encoding can change depending on image size so extension won't match.\n. I must add something like $filepath$ I guess.\nBut then people won't be able to find it their self which would be problem.\n. Before I was letting user select container (it was already automatically filling proper container) but then people was keep selecting invalid containers and keep reporting it not works so I was fully automated it. For it to be foolproof.\n. How Overwatch memory increase to do with ShareX?\n. ShareX can't increase memory of another process. Because ShareX have nothing to do with another process. Because there is no game capture (directx/opengl hook) support.\n. Where is this Save URL button?\n. Isn't actions can do it?\n. When you capture screenshot there is no name. What you write there becomes name. So it wouldn't work.\n. That doesn't change the fact that capture using that naming and it will cause unintended naming issues when it replaced with empty value.\n. ShareX copies bitmap to clipboard what you mean png in clipboard?\n. Probably you can't find single app which supports pasting jpg.\n. Did you tried copying file instead of image that way it can upload jpg file.\n. It happens even with new main window with no image in it. So only thing happens is form becomes visible and invisible and there is nothing to dispose. So I'm not sure is there really something leak or it is .NET controls what causing it and will garbage collect it automatically later. Because there is nothing I can find which can leak when form become visible.\n. Sorry but I don't prefer additional dependencies for uploader.\n. I can compile without reference in ShareX project so it not need. Thanks.\n. #1615\n. What you saying not makes sense.\n. I don't understand your request.\n. You can modify what will be copied to clipboard from here:\n\n. Where can I find website which supports pasting this html clipboard data for testing? I bet most of forums etc. won't support it.\n. EnoraNedelec already explained it.\n. Chrome copies 6 different clipboard data when image copied: System.Drawing.Bitmap, Bitmap, HTML Format, UniformResourceLocatorW, DeviceIndependentBitmap, Format17\nFor HTML Format clipboard data: https://theartofdev.com/2014/06/12/setting-htmltext-to-clipboard-revisited/\n. Region capture in ShareX is not singleton form. Because that way I can take region capture of region capture. What you want require region capture to be singleton that way second press can transfer functionality to already open one which I can't do because it must not be singleton form.\n. https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/ is down.\n.

Sorry but this is very personal case feature request that other than you nobody gonna need and have no actual use, therefore I'm not planning to add it.\n. Custom uploader had $random:domain1.com|domain2.com|domain3.com$ syntax support, so now I added that syntax support to FTP \"URL path\" field.\nLike this:\n. This is \"None\" in your window:\n\nand must be changed.\n. I was made sure that toolbar icons resizes automatically depending on DPI scaling and was tested it with high DPI scaling. Not sure why it not works for you.\n. All recording happens inside FFmpeg.exe so it is not to do with us.. You mean gif encoding?\n. I was thought about adding it too but there was no split button for context menu and using dropdown menu button as normal button is not usual interaction and people will upload it to current destination when actually trying to open drop down menu. So it is not good idea to do what you want without have split button control.\n. It is not recoverable.\n. Is there any reason you don't use this?\n\n. There is no way. Keeping both way would be alot of codes and difficulties, so right click menu codes not there anymore and I'm not planning to re add it.\n. If your screen become black when you were not even doing region capture then maybe it is not to do with ShareX. For example it could be to do with graphic card driver crashing and that effecting picture box rendering of ShareX somehow.\n. ShareX can record audio.\n. Region capture have editor mode which have similar buttons to what you want:\n\nBut that buttons can't work as expected in region capture because you can't just for example copy image to clipboard because region selection must be made and confirmed to be able to have output image. And because when you make region it instantly captures, so you can't even click those buttons.. Editor mode used for editing when you right click task or opening it from tools menu.\n\n. That setting is not for region capture but for:\n\nI was just gave it as example but it is not to do with region capture.\n. By the way why you took photo of your monitor?!\n. I was planning to add size filter to uploader filters. But not planning to add regex, it will make it too over complicated.\n. I tried now it works. You probably didn't configure custom region:\n\n. Custom region means previously configured region. You actually want normal screen recording and by default there is already hotkey for it.. You can use http://droplr.com/ app to upload to droplr.\n. It is Imgur internal server error not to do with ShareX.\n. Web version not using this API to upload.\n. I can upload to Imgur currently using API.\n. http://api.imgur.com/errorhandling\nStatus Code: 500\nUnexpected internal error. What it says. We'll strive NOT to return these but your app should be prepared to see it. It basically means that something is broken with the Imgur service.\n. #1615\n. #1615\n. As soon as I make that context menu shorter, there will be issue spams in GitHub asking me to add those stuffs back (I know that because everytime I try to remove something to simplify UI people keep becoming unhappy about it). Not everyone have same opinions as you. Just because you prefer simple context menu does not means everyone would prefer it too. Actually people keep asking me to add more stuffs to that context menu and I keep declining their requests and then users becoming angry to me just because I didn't add what they requested.\nIf you mean by \"do nothing\" is not showing preview in right bottom corner then you can hide it or even change how it gonna show up like balloon tip or customizing how preview gonna show etc. By default users prefer to see preview.\nSo point is impossible to make everyone happy because everyone have different tastes about what is good UX.\n.

Why don't you use \"Shared folder\" destination to copy files to any folder you want and generate url for it.\n. #2050\n. I fixed it.\n. Because pipette using region capture window too, opening two different region capture window top of each other can cause performance issues or problems, therefore I'm not planning to add it.. Wouldn't using Pixelate with 1000 size can work for censoring purposes, which will mainly use background average color to fill rectangle area. But I was set maximum limit 100 for it so I must change it now.\nEdit: I tried now it not really works because text affects average color:\n. Because auto capture form is singleton it was using default task settings.\n. There is only one form, you can't open two different auto capture form with two different workflows. So because it is only single form it was using default task settings not hotkey one.. No.\n. #1615. I was tried png compression softwares and those were taking so long time when lowest possible size aimed. And even then file size difference was so small it was not worth doing. But ofc for people who want to use those images on web site every bit of bandwidth usage decrease can help but it is minority of people. Also if it can reduce size 40% then it must be doing lossy reduction. In this case you can use jpg anyway. So I don't think it is worth adding by default.\n. Writing instructions very difficult with english.\n. ShareX don't have screen saver.\n. Region capture always opens instantly for me. There is no caching happens. I don't think there is anything in toolbar which can slow down opening..  did you have these checked?\n. #167\n. You can create workflow with copy url to clipboard selected and use that workflow with -task \"Workflow description\" CLI command.. \n. #2059\n. ShareX runs ffmpeg.exe to record. Executable must be opening slow for you. How am I supposed to workaround that? I already made sure that counter not starts without actual recording start, so atleast it shows proper counter.\n. Even if it is possible it would be so horrible workaround to hold it on memory for no reason.\nIt is combination of executable opening and recording initiating in ffmpeg which both is not fixable in ShareX.\n. People want simple UI and there is many requests already to add new buttons to that toolbar. After capture tasks, after upload tasks, destinations, workflows, other settings etc. It will again gonna become complex for users. I'm trying to keep that toolbar simple as possible. Not to mention soon toolbar width gonna exceed width of small monitor users.\nBut also there is technical reason. Screen capture library not knows anything about after capture/upload tasks etc. and library must be useable everywhere without depending on ShareX.. #1615. I can't reproduce it: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2016/12/RWufI6x3yC.png\nIt was file with \"ShareX_Logo.png\" name.. This issue is very similar to #2145 I think. Because you not actually saving image file inside task and file path is same as before. So I must rename file here too after \"after capture\" window is closed. But the thing is many people won't prefer their original file to be renamed. So renaming can be bad idea for current users? Not sure.. It was actually not completely wrong direction. Don't enable \"perform actions\" do uploading then check file path you would see like screen recording it is same file path locally and only uploaded file have that randomized name. So problem is actually exactly same. Local file paths not modified and only \"save image file\", \"upload file\" and such tasks use that randomized name. So like screen recording issue if I rename file before start task then all stuffs will go properly. But I'm worrying about this gonna break current users expectations because they could be actually liking how it works currently.. You can ignore it:\n. Because it was not linked before and people was keep opening issues asking why they can't use after capture tasks for it.... #2063. You talking about \"Drawing: Rectangle\" or \"Region: Rectangle\" ? If it is drawing then you must drag rectangle to do rectangle drawing and later go back to region rectangle to draw rectangle region to capture that area.. Just copy setting files.. #689. When hotkey registration fail it should show in debug log but nothing in yours. Are you sure there is any hotkey configured in ShareX?. #1040. Are you still can't upload? When Imgur API have problem it tends to return \"Bad request\" error.. Check here and see: https://imgur.statuspage.io/history\nTheir API issues never show up there.. You don't need to copy anything. It creates setting files inside same folder as portable executable.. 1 year ago I needed to compile my own FFmpeg to include NVENC encoder but look like now https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ includes NVENC too. Because of this: https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/bc4137d4aa3a75bbbbc6b20c6710d07b50dab0a9\nI was using -c:v nvenc when doing testing and you are using -c:v h264_nvenc now, is there any difference?\nEdit: I see because there is also hevc_nvenc therefore nvenc is deprecated.. Now I tried recording with h264_nvenc and need to use -b:v to configure quality because currently quality too low by default. I can implement this myself if you allow. Because I was already implemented this before for testing and later removed it.\nEdit: Implementing now.. Finding NVENC preset list with descriptions was too difficult:\n\nand now I'm not even sure which one is most suitable for screen recording.\nEdit: Set low latency high performance as default.. Finding NVENC preset list with descriptions was too difficult:\n\nand now I'm not even sure which one is most suitable for screen recording.\nEdit: Set low latency high performance as default.. I don't think so:\n. It not look like video device so it wouldn't be possible.. For now you can right click drag dots to collapse toolbar and make sure \"remember menu state\" option is enabled. That way it will waste very small area in your screen compared to now.. For now you can right click drag dots to collapse toolbar and make sure \"remember menu state\" option is enabled. That way it will waste very small area in your screen compared to now.. I just don't understand why someone would like to hide it too. Annotation is very handy feature.. \nAdded there.. You must uncheck first option. Because some file urls don't have extension ShareX can't know is it file url or not.\nFor example this is file url with no extension: https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/822090.

You want this I think:\n. You must ask to owner of imgland.net. That happens because norton ran as admin and sharex not ran as admin. So it is limitation of hotkey system and nothing can be done about it other than running sharex as admin.. I can't get what \"Always on top\" to do with it too. But if your app is not fullscreen you can click tray icon to start region capture.. Putting main window of ShareX to top of RDP will be inefficient because that window is too big compared to FastStone menu.. If it were only menu I would easily make it but people gonna request customize able menu for sure which makes sense and making that gonna be so boring. Because for example I must assign icon for each possible task which is so repetitive work because there is a lot of tasks which you can see from hotkey task list.\nBut you can still open issue for it because it is different than this issue.\nI'm closing this issue because what you really want is simple top most task menu, not top most main window.. I told you it is fine for us to have that few buttons but then people gonna open issues and request customize able menu as always.. Problem is when writing it from beginning, it must be designed with customize support to not write it from scratch in the future.. I told you if you open new issue for simple menu support, one day I could be less bored and decide to do it. But not now :D Can't get bored even more.. But I will be definitely adding it in future because it is also can be handy for people who want \"Simple UI\" so it can be called simple mode. Reason why I wanted you to open issue so I don't forget it.. I was planning to allow customizeable buttons from hotkey actions list which contains nearly all possible actions that exist in main window toolbar. I mean in separate window which gonna have tool bar in it only. But I can't add after capture tasks etc. sub menus with that system if that was what you wanted. Because it will be too complicated and would require separate action list than hotkey actions list which would be so much duplicate code.\nThis is hotkey actions list: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX/Enums.cs#L147. This is currently how it looks:\n\nWhich made of this code:\nnew List<HotkeyType>() { HotkeyType.RectangleRegion, HotkeyType.PrintScreen, HotkeyType.LastRegion, HotkeyType.FileUpload, HotkeyType.ClipboardUploadWithContentViewer };\nShareX label can be used to drag toolbar around. This is why I added label there.. This is work in progress edit window:\n\nSo you must have understood how it works now.. I can't reproduce this too: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14076298/ShareX/2016/12/custom%20file%20name.mp4\nDefault name was random but it used after capture form file name.. It was intended because after capture form not designed to rename already exists files but instead allows you to set what name to be supplied to task but I can modify code to also rename file.. After capture window file name field is designed to be used for \"Save file\" task. And it was designed for screen capture only. So I cheated and added it for screen recording too and because it not using \"Save file\" and file already exists, it not renames already exist file but using that name in all part of task jobs which is uploading etc.. Like this?\n. Like this?\n. Fixed image link.. Fixed image link.. Custom region is not allows you to select region it is to use already assigned regions which means quick capturing.. I didn't know it is all about just adding custom URL. I thought it had special API or something.. @mxschmitt should I remove custom URL support now? Because anonymous uploads not possible anymore and your PR was only working with anonymous uploads.. You know ShareX have history support, right?. I don't know what is .sxb but history is in .xml format. Which is one of the easiest parseable format.. It is inside Documents\\ShareX.. You don't even tell where you uploading it to. Because it is not FTP but custom uploader. And response parse failing.. You can't right click to see response right? Probably response includes error message from your server.. You have error message there which returned from your server. So problem is completely to do in your side.. I don't know.. What is interval too coarse even means?. #498. #1040. I sent API key request and this is their response:\n\nPer our API terms of service, we request that our API partners include additional functionality outside of the features available on GIPHY products such as GIPHY Capture, which has the same functionality as your app. Therefore, we cannot issue you a production key at the moment.. I sent API key request and this is their response:\nPer our API terms of service, we request that our API partners include additional functionality outside of the features available on GIPHY products such as GIPHY Capture, which has the same functionality as your app. Therefore, we cannot issue you a production key at the moment.. ShareX not using magnifier API. Reason why this happens is, ShareX takes screen capture and showing it in background which is inverse colored. But then magnifier also inversing it which making it normal colors.\n\nYou can use \"Region (Transparent)\" which using transparent window. That way inverse can work properly.. Latest version have workaround to support TLS 1.2.. What is Nextcloud 11?. Is it not owncloud api compliant?. I mean if owncloud works properly and nextcloud not then isn't this means nextcloud API have problem.. Adding owncloud was already very difficult because I couldn't test it. So it is not easy for me.. If you want to test it: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/wiki/Dev%20builds. You are uploading to your other custom uploader which have file form name missing.. Uncheck this:\n. You must have enabled it from setup, which remembers your setting and re enable it when re installing for update. I can't find way to not enable it while reinstalling. So you must uninstall and reinstall with those setup options not checked.. Option already in the program.. Option already in the program.. Because Dropbox removed all public folder urls.. Because Dropbox removed all public folder urls.. I can't find their API page.. Thanks.. Why would you need base64?. I'm against using base64 for images. You can upload image to imgur and just use it in your html that way it will be still single file.. handy for css designers\nProper web designers won't use base64 image on css. It is very ugly thing to do. And I hate when I see people using base64 for uploading etc. because it just wasting bandwidth for no reason.. It can't be same size.. I'm using Dropbox too and can't reproduce your issue. Are you using shareable url?\nI'm not gonna remove public folder option yet because there is 3 more months (which is not almost immediate) for it to be disabled.. If I remove public folder support now people gonna uninstall new version just to install old version so they can continue using it.. Can you paste name of your file so I can test it.. I can't be sure is this problem in Dropbox API v2 or in ShareX.\nThis is what ShareX sends:\nDropbox-API-Arg: {\"path\":\"/Public/ShareX/2016/12/Test \u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05d5\u05df.txt\",\"mode\":\"overwrite\",\"autorename\":false,\"mute\":true}}\nand Dropbox can't decode that json.\nWhen I send that argument as url argument it works properly, but when used in header it fails. So I will contact Dropbox about it.. #2127. Having this header not breaks ownCloud right?. No.. https://github.com/ShareX/CustomUploaders/pull/62. Both tray menu and sub menu opens automatically by .NET Framework and I don't actually open or position them myself.. Why you can't customize it?. You mean this?\n. #1685. TLS 1.2 support in latest version fixed your problem I think. Because there is no change to ownCloud.. I had all scrolling capture settings also in task settings before but was removed it later because with property grid control it was not translatable. But I forget that settings was needed to be able to untick it. \nFor now you can untick it from config file when ShareX is not open:\nDocuments/ShareX/ApplicationConfig.json\nSearch: \"AutoClose\" and make it false.. Removed auto close option because need to check output image most of the time anyway.. Are you using old ShareX version?. In region capture:\n. auth_token and timestamp can be problem if it is dynamic.. #1009. If link format changed suddenly that means they changed something in API. So it is not to do with ShareX.. #1615. By the way in most of Windows message boxes you can press Ctrl + C to copy all texts. That way no need to take screenshot from it but most importantly it will make searching issue more easier.. If ShareX was working before and started to not work randomly, mainly that could means one file of ShareX could be corrupted. But you telling even after reinstall it not works which eliminates that possibility. So I have no idea what could be causing it, but there is high probability it is not to do with ShareX. Because if it were to do with ShareX then it wouldn't work before too (it was working fine before right?), after all there was no new update or anything.. Wow they added css files end of html so web page shows up without css styling first then later styling shows up.... This is how web site opens:\n\nBecause files required to style this web site is put end of html file instead of beginning of it. So styling happens late and shows web site without style temporary in start.. I'm not planning to add multi destination support because ShareX not designed to return multiple urls in single task, which means just uploading to multiple destination is not enough but also returning and managing multiple urls must be supported which is big problem. Not to mention workflow system is already very complicated for users and making ui for multiple destination can be problematic. So it is too much work.. #1615. Showing sub menu under cursor in tray menu is not expected behavior. I never saw any software have such tray menu before.. Maybe your mouse is bad? Because it is very easy to move cursor horizontally to go to sub menu.. Is this selected in your region capture? Then unselect it.\n. You don't need to switch mode, you can double click to select and capture that hovered area.. Can you show ss for it. Also I'm not sure are you using image effects feature of ShareX or window capture with shadow.. So you enabled these?\n. I think you have multi monitor and one monitor is smaller than other which causing this issue. Because I don't have multi monitor I couldn't reproduce this issue before. And my friends have multi monitor but their monitors same size so they couldn't too.. I can't reproduce that bug by turning monitor. It require multi monitor.. It happens because toolbar (which is actually child window) receives keyboard input and not let region capture window receive it. I couldn't find how to make toolbar window ignore all input so whats behind can receive it.. Can you reproduce this issue in that specific programs all the time?\nIf yes then can you first try disabling this setting:\n\nthen clipboard upload.\nAlso enable this setting:\n\nand try clipboard upload again.\nBut still I have no idea how such thing can happen to images. I'm not even sure is it happens when loading image from clipboard.. .NET Framework have clipboard methods to get image from clipboard. But that method only supports 24 bit images which means no alpha support. So I was searched way to support 32 bit images and there was close to not exist resource about it so I was tried to write it myself (https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX.HelpersLib/Helpers/ClipboardHelpers.cs#L323) which was working in my tests but look like it still have problems and I have no idea how to correct it. I mean there was not a single code example in Google searches about how to get 32 bit images correctly. The thing is 32 bit bitmap on clipboard very rarely supported and most of software just copy 24 bit bitmap & png to clipboard. So it is not common thing to find.. Yes you are using non transparent supported mode currently which is reliable.. I can make reliable way default option but then people gonna open issues about lack of transparent support so not sure.. Very few apps support 32 bit bitmap in clipboard. And some support PNG.. I must change default path to \"ShareX\" then.. I can write special characters after \u0647 character?. Maybe your arabic font causing it?\n. \nClick region tool and drag rectangle to capture where you want.. I don't understand why you watermark with image editor instead of image effects:\n. This is why everybody using video recording instead of gif recording. Which makes extremely small files compared to gif and be able to playback in browsers.. Both image tells not enough space on hard drive (according to your translation) when two of them different apps. So it is your pc.. So just because your modified Hastebin installation unable to check for both \\r\\n and \\n when counting lines you modifying ShareX code to force \\n?! Seriously?. I checked hastebin request when saving text and request contains \\r\\n according to Chrome dev tool.. Well in any case if ShareX can upload \\r\\n and official hastebin implementation can show it without problem then your custom implementation must work with it without problem too. For compliance with default behavior.. There is not a single text hosting web site in the world (as far as i know) which have rule about using only Unix line endings.. #893, #892, #891, #890, #749, #657, #533, #522, #426. ShareX using .NET Framework to encode images as JPEG. Which is unable to make good quality jpeg compared to Photoshop etc.. And what you suggest?. The thing is there is more edge cases where code should be inserted in another specific position, then I will require to have 3. box then 4. box so it goes on. So if you want full control, custom commands is way to go.. What thread_queue_size do?. Are you uploading video with FTP?. Use %i{5}. I also received this today:\n```\nThe remote server returned an error: (502) Bad Gateway.\nResponse:\n{\"error\": \"Internal Server Error\"}\n```\nBut later it resolved.. That issue could be to do with lack of TLS 1.2 support in .NET Framework we using. I added workaround for it in latest ShareX version. But it also can be to do with problem in server where you uploading to.. #1329. I can download FFmpeg without problem currently. Maybe their server was down temporary.. . Download it from https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ and copy \"ffmpeg.exe\" to \"Documents\\ShareX\\Tools\" folder.. No: #3189. @jimbo1qaz try re installing video/audio recording device, latest version of it supposed to fix that issue.. diksm8:\nI already love this program and I would really appreciate if you added the ability to add custom hotkeys.\nI.e launch programs with custom args\nWhat launching programs to do with ShareX??. diksm8:\nIf we are going with that attitude then what does a DNS changer have to do with a screenshot uploader?\nA hotkey to send a get request to the last deletion URL doesn't seem like that bad of an idea to me.\nFor example both Imgur (default image destination) and Pastebin (default text destination) is banned in my country and only accessible when you change DNS. So it helps my country users to quickly configure DNS to allow uploading. So without that tool \"uploader\" part not even works.... Are you sure puush API supports deletion?. Unfortunately using \"Deletion URL\" support of ShareX not possible with puush because deletion API url not supports GET web requests (which happens when you open url in browser).. Dropbox don't have deletion url.. I added DeleteFile function to Puush.cs yesterday so I know it requires POST request. But there is many difficulties to implement that in multi uploader supported software. Especially if it is not designed to work that way from beginning.. I also want SFTP file deletion support!. You are wrong just remembering path is not enough. You also gonna need to remember entire FTP account info. In case that user change FTP settings, it must not delete file from another FTP account. So a lot of configuration must be remembered to not incorrectly delete files.. For example Imgur deletion url opens confirmation page. So just sending GET web request to deletion url not gonna work.. https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/12/08/observations-porting-from-net-framework-to-net-core/\n. https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/12/08/observations-porting-from-net-framework-to-net-core/\n. #498. .NET core topic talked about in #498 on Oct 17, 2016 which is not TWO YEARS OLD.\nThis is about porting ShareX to Linux (or making ShareX multi platform), hence it is duplicate.\nDon't you think I already checked .NET core stuffs before? I even used it in my one project...\n. What is gg about it? That issue had 21 mentions of \"Linux\" and people who just check title when searching issues in GitHub could think it is not about Linux too. So I changed title to reflect that.... I didn't told you were searching for linux port.\nCurrently only reason someone will port their desktop app to netcore is for multi platform support. So yeah it is all about linux port in your use case.\nAlso you keep saying .NET Framework is dropped & Framework is gonna die but you never giving any proofs about it to prove your statement. In current state even porting console apps to netcore is too difficult. When I'm porting my console app to netcore I needed to remove countless basic stuffs which not exists in netcore to make it compileable. So even if netcore gonna catch .NET framework one day, it gonna take so long time. And like I told before it is not certain it will catch up.. Everyone here had issue uploading to Puush I think and it is resolved in server side now.. . This? . Thanks :). Where you uploading to? In any case internal server error means problem not to do with ShareX.. After capture window have file name field.. \n. \n. I don't know how to make Firefox addon otherwise I would have made it.. Look like now Firefox moving to Chrome web extensions system and planning to deprecate their own addon system.\n\nThere are currently several toolsets for developing Firefox add-ons, but WebExtensions will become the standard by the end of 2017. The other toolsets, including overlay add-ons, bootstrapped add-ons, and the Add-on SDK, are expected to be deprecated over the same period of time.\n\nIn that old addon system doing native messaging was so complicated I couldn't figure it out. But now I can just copy paste our Chrome extension which is few lines of codes. And with few small changes it can work in Firefox too! I'm currently working on it.. https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX_Firefox. I'm not sure why you receive such weird error. Nobody reported similar problem before. And error happens inside .NET framework function so it is not looks to do with ShareX codes.\n\"C:\\Program Files\\ShareX\\ShareX.exe.Config line 3\"\nCan you check this file is something wrong in line 3?. It is problem in application which can't paste image. But you can try alternative copy way from here:\n. If I understood correctly you using shared folder to generate url but saving to same folder as screenshot save folder. So while trying to copying to exact same place it causing problem in screen recorder? But how it could be locked while copying.. Thanks!. #2190. I wonder is Imgur returns that error because of big gif size or their service was down temporary. Because mainly when their API is down they send nginx errors instead of proper API errors.. Imgur API supports max 10 mb file I think. Unlike their web site upload. But normally it give \"file size\" related error when that happen, this is why I couldn't be sure. In any case it is not to do with ShareX.. How to get URL from active browser tab?. That will be very ugly method and unreliable one. Not to mention it will be very complicated to implement.. What is the point of removing them from readme when it is staying in software?. You changed ShareX personal folder to \"Program Files\\ShareX\". But ShareX can't create any file inside program files without admin permission. So personal folder must be outside program files. Default and suggested path is \"Documents\\ShareX\". So change your personal folder path from here:\n. Did you removed that audio device? Reinstall it from:\n. This issue to do with:\n\nWhich I can't reproduce.. This issue to do with:\n\nWhich I can't reproduce.. Nice bug reporting, indeed it looks like auto image format change causing it therefore I couldn't reproduce it before. But actually saving as JPEG causing it because while filling transparent areas as white (because JPEG not supports transparency so transparent areas would look black) it was disposing actual image file which is only used again while creating thumbnail file.. Merging this issue with #596. Just re run ShareX installer.. Fixed cursor for lock position.\nI thought about automatically hiding it but that won't work for all actions so I would need to have list of specific actions which gonna need auto hiding. But even then I couldn't capture toolbar itself if I had this feature so I was decided to not add it. Maybe I should have \"Auto hide\" optional setting. Which can work for capture related actions only.\nIf I hide ShareX title then people can't right click it to close toolbar or use other options.\nNo, controls not support transparent background.. Both drag n drop and clipboard operations using bitmap in Windows. But very rarely software can add png/jpg to clipboard but it is not likely and not supported by majority of software.. Every single time this error happen people tells this happened after update but later they admitting ShareX started after update properly but after next ShareX open (mainly on Windows startup) this error happened.. #1615. ShareX Windows startup option is actually not setting but shortcut file. So it just creates/checks file in this folder:\n\nIf ShareX unable to create shortcut there then it is problem in your Windows which not lets ShareX do it.\nCheck ShareX debug log maybe it contains error message.\nAbout main window list you can disable saving of them from here:\n. Because that error is not english I can't Google it :( But it not looks to do with ShareX.. #1615. Why there is conflict?. Because I don't have multi monitor it is not possible for me to reproduce this issue. But there is a lot of multi monitor users and look like very few of them got this issue so not sure what is different in this computers compared to other correctly working ones.. You mean actions toolbar?. \nThen configure clipboard upload hotkey like Ctrl + Page up which i'm using.. Uncheck this:\n. Uncheck this:\n. I suspect it is bug in ShareX. ShareX captures what Windows supplies.. >{\"data\":{\"error\":\"Imgur is temporarily over capacity.

Even if I add drag n drop support for it, you can't drag files to Discord because Discord not supports copy dragging and only allows move dragging. And ShareX must do copy dragging.. When people drag file they mainly want it to be copied not cut and moved. So this is why ShareX do copy drag and not move drag. Accepting both copy and move drag is one line code but Discord still not do it, dunno why.. Currently http://sli.mg opens but upload fails.\nBut those posts shows it was like this last 20 days so removing it.. I can't reproduce your minimize restore issue. Are you sure you are using ShareX and not ScreenX?. It was joke.\n. Is it possible that your specific hotkey don't have \"Perform actions\" checked?.

Your ShareX must be already running when your setting files synced.. #2247. fixed #2411. Adding video editing will be very difficult. Therefore I have no plans for video editing support.. Opening ShareX with file will upload that file. You can disable uploading in whole app but if you don't want it to upload why you open ShareX with file?. You can disable upload app wide like this:\n. Did you tried install old ShareX to test is it latest version causing it?. This happens really so much that people blame that latest update broken something but it is not the case most of the time :/. Both hotkey system and screen capture system using Windows API so I don't think I can do anything about it in both case.. #320. Real time webm encoding is very costly and I don't suggest it for 60 fps.. This applies to most of uploaders in the world. For example Imgur creates like this URL:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2a3lwES.png\nWhich is 7 characters long and someone can brute force every single variation to find all Imgur images stored in their servers.\nSo it is users responsibility to choice which hosting or file naming they want to use. If ShareX was not allow having custom file naming then I would understand.\nI personally prefer this file naming:\n. Their server have problem.. ShareX runs ffmpeg.exe to record/encode in background.

Are you sure where you uploading is allows PUT multi-part data instead of just plain data on request.. Are you sure where you uploading is allows PUT multi-part data instead of just plain data on request.. The thing is there is so many methods like PUT with binary data, PUT with multipart, PUT with url encoded data, PUT with query parameter, PUT with multipart/related protocol etc. So I added most used method per http method to custom uploader to keep it simple as possible. Using binary data uploading is very bad way when there is multipart protocol which allows supplying file name in same section, not to mention it is very rarely used by file uploader APIs. Therefore I'm not planning to add it.. Added binary body support to custom uploader now but because webdav not returns url, I don't think it gonna be possible to be used with custom uploader. Especially because I saw few webdav implementations requires sharing file with second request..

Literally I would need to store custom uploader itself in history for each entry to specify required data required for that deletion request. Right now only deletion URL stored in history. Also duplicate of #3943.. There is reason why it is under image editor, because it must copy result from image editor too. So it can have up to date modified image in clipboard.. #1329. #2298. All save buttons works like that in all image editors or text editors. But few can have notification animation.. Check history:\n. Why you showing your secret tokens in public...\nExpireDate is when tokens expire. Nothing to do with image expiration.. Go here http://imgur.com/account/settings/apps and revoke access to ShareX. Then those tokens gonna be invalid.. I'm using Steam ShareX version in my computer and when developing ShareX, opening new ShareX build countless times everyday.

I don't use Nextcloud or ownCloud but people who using nextcloud was told that ShareX supports Nextcloud properly in latest version: #2160. -silent -startautocapture adding these to ShareX startup shortcut should work.. You can't have different file naming for upload.. Write your own script?. Auto capture of ShareX is singleton window which means it can't be opened multiple times (opening it second time activates already open one). So you can't have 2x auto capture running.. You can easily change it from here: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX.UploadersLib/FileUploaders/Pomf.cs\n. Cloudflare have problem and many peoples web site is banned currently:\nhttps://twitter.com/search?q=CNAME%20Cross-User%20Banned&src=typd.

This is error message in that log: File is over the size limit\nImgur API have low size limit unlike their web site which allows high size image uploads.. I even sent email to them asked about this but they didn't reply.. You know about \"Open -> Deletion URL\" right?. How nothing happens? It opens deletion url in my browser.. Can you check debug log, it must show url which tried to open.. Open Windows run Windows button + R and then type url there and press enter. It will fail too probably.. It is nothing to do with ShareX or its save locally option.. Try re installing your browser maybe.. It opens URL in your browser, same as other open URL options there. So it must be inside \"Open\" and fits very well with other options in that category. Also \"Delete file on server\" is very misleading because it not deletes file, it just opens deletion URL.. There is no change in SFTP codes as you can see from here: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/commits/master/ShareX.UploadersLib/FileUploaders/SFTP.cs. #1615.

Patreon allows donating any amount when you click this:\n. ??. All icons using same set there to be consistent with design yours not..

Current way is not allows moving toolbar to top of taskbar because toolbar can stay behind taskbar even when toolbar is top most window. You broken that so toolbar can disappear under taskbar now.. Method I used should be able to handle it in multi monitor. But because I don't have multi monitor not sure what is wrong.. Try using this: return Screen.AllScreens.Select(x => x.WorkingArea).Combine();. Is it handle taskbar case too?. When you press esc button which item in toolbar was selected?.

Google Image search custom uploader: https://github.com/ShareX/CustomUploaders/blob/master/google.com%20(Image%20search).sxcu.

I was asking more technical answer :D \nIt must be opening link in your browser.. Because there is two way, one is uploading image directly to google image search which is not legal without use their api and that api is paid. Another way is uploading image to somewhere and then opening google image search url with that uploaded url which is legal.. Unfortunately I can't test this because I can't reproduce proxy error.\nShareX auto update using this window too so hopefully there is no problem about it.. #1338.

I wonder is resize node drag works correctly too, because node hit test happens on frame update and your cursor update happens after it.. These are resize nodes:\n. I don't have timeline. Resize nodes little more bigger in latest dev build because it includes shadow as hit zone too.. Yes. Before node hit zone was 13px now it is 24px. Nearly double size.. Your fix was not affecting resize nodes, this must be the reason why it not works. Because resize node hit check happens before your input update.. When that input manager update your mouse position still on old position because only when you touch that position updates.. ShareX when updating also using /SILENT parameter and ShareX must run after install automatically.. As a solution I'm planning to add /NORUN parameter support to setup. So people who want to have fully silent installations can use /VERYSILENT /NORUN parameters.. I can't decide what to name parameter:\n/NORUN\n/NOAUTORUN\n/NOSTART\n/NOAUTOSTART\nAlso when that parameter is used and there is no \\SILENT used then last page of setup not gonna show check box to run ShareX..

They didn't reply to my ticket yet but I did malwarebytes update now and it not detects ShareX as adware anymore.. Thanks.. It not looks like problem in ShareX side?. Why every single line showing as diff in your commit? You must be using different line ending than project.. I think your Git client could be causing that new line issues.. I think easiest way to solve this would be, making new fork and pull them to new folder. Then copy your it.IT.resx files from your old folder to new forked folder. Then push those changes using GitHub desktop client. Then make new pull request with it. Because your current fork already have bad new line ending files committed, it can be difficult for you to revert them.\nBut before pushing changes using GitHub desktop client make sure to check diff to see is entire lines changed which shows there is new line ending issue.. All your links look like to do with UWP stuffs.. I tried dragging image from Chrome to Paint, Paint .NET and Photoshop and none of them could read it. Because Chrome not drags image. So it is not ShareX fault.. Main reason I didn't add this tool is because 2x enlarged image looks bad.. @vatterspun you can already do exactly that using \"Image (Screen)\" and resize:\n. That menu not exists in region capture annotation, it is in after capture tasks -> image editor etc.. In task settings window -> advanced tab -> UseShareXForAnnotation option.. It is not good idea to auto refresh it otherwise I would have added it. First of all history lib have no clue about uploads or such and it is independent library. This is also why there is no context menu upload button. Also updating it can re populate list and make you lose scrolling etc. Not to mention loading info of thousands of image also creating delay so rapid uploads can make it freeze unnecessarily.. You can press F5 to refresh image history if you uploaded new image and want it to show up there. But in those cases user also can check main window history anyway.. I don't have multi monitor so it would be difficult for me to fix and test it.. It is improved in dev build: #2673. Added by #3021. There was another pull request to add accept and cancel buttons before and it was broken stuffs which require pressing enter in forms like numeric up down controls trigger value changed when enter pressed etc. So I'm worrying that some of your changes can have unwanted effects.. Even your first committed file which is color picker form. When you press enter to confirm numeric up down control change then it will close form.. Gradient form numeric up down issue.\nCanvas size, image size let presses reach region capture so region capture instantly close.\nTweet form can't make new line.\nText upload form can't make new line.\nAlso there can be other issues too which I'm unable to see by checking changes.. Now both Windows 10 and anti virus apps have protected folder feature which can block ShareX from creating files in Documents folder. Maybe your issue is to do with it.. Did you enabled multi region mode? You can press Q to disable it.. It is button here:\n\nWhich allows drawing multiple regions.. Both these have filename in dialog:\n. This causing you to not instantly capture area:\n. . I already updated it in codes, it will be available next release.. \nUncheck that option.. You can just record audio if you select \"None\" as video device in screen recording settings.. You can have different hotkey for voice recording which can have different setting. So it won't require you to change setting at all.. It is already added in dev build.. #2651. If same gif is previewed in two different picture box then this happens. As expected solution should be cloning gif image so that fullscreen preview won't have any connection to gif used in other picture box. Yet even after clone it still is connected to other gif image somehow. So there is bug in .NET Framework that clone method not clones animated gif properly. Therefore I can't fix it..

Library file could be corrupted. Can you try reinstalling ShareX.. Instead of trying to fix issue in latest version you asking how to stay in old version.\nI didn't understood your issue in latest version too.. That file dialog belongs to Microsoft and nothing to do with ShareX. And there was no changes related to file dialog codes. Only difference I can think of you can have is that right after you install new version ShareX is run as admin. So close ShareX and reopen it, that way it won't run as admin this time.. Open ShareX 12.0 normally without admin.. Because setup requires admin access to copy files to program files, it also runs ShareX as admin unintentionally.\nThere is already a way to disable updates, but intentionally I didn't told it so you can solve your problem in latest release and not require it.. That happens because when Upload is selected it automatically moves selection to one down, because Upload don't have any content in it. So it can be difficult to fix..

You are probably using old version.. I can't see your image.. I can't see your image.. You are using old version. That issue fixed in latest version.. Download actually happens in thread. But some reason this method slows it down between 10-50ms per added item: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX/Controls/NewsListControl.cs#L146\nI'm not sure what causing that increasing slow.\nThese are item add times in my test:\n10.1388 milliseconds.\n11.0533 milliseconds.\n17.9243 milliseconds.\n21.378 milliseconds.\n28.1156 milliseconds.\n39.8919 milliseconds.\n37.5522 milliseconds.\n42.263 milliseconds.\n48.9087 milliseconds.\n53.1304 milliseconds.. Indeed, if I suspend layout before add items and then resume it then test result is:\n2.7893 milliseconds.\n0.327 milliseconds.\n0.2848 milliseconds.\n0.3158 milliseconds.\n0.3435 milliseconds.\n0.3031 milliseconds.\n0.2823 milliseconds.\n0.2724 milliseconds.\n0.3009 milliseconds.\n0.4514 milliseconds.\nStill it is incredible how calculating layout takes so much time.. I added news for emergency reasons too. For example this news was pretty important and all users must read it:\n. I don't see any reason why loading news once at startup should create any issues to users after layout issue is fixed.. Because there is so many hotkey tasks and adding check for every single hotkey task and handling every single exit method of it will be too much work. Auto close command is just closes ShareX after created task is completed. And because when you cancel screen recorder, task is never created, it is unable to close. So it works as intended.. It is intended because recent tasks shown on main window is not always mimic of saved recent tasks but tray menu ones are. So it not trying to sync your main window task list. \nBut still I was added that right click \"Clear list\" button in main window also clears recent list.. Shared folder codes not changed past 2 years: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/commits/master/ShareX.UploadersLib/FileUploaders/SharedFolderUploader.cs. Added this option for next version:\n. PayPal is banned in my country.. Uncheck this:\n. Duplicate of #3220. Imgur API not supports mp4 uploads.. No way to avoid big gif size unless you record small region.. One of the reason why I was not added eyedropper to all color pickers because it using region capture to color pick from screen. And opening full screen region capture inside fullscreen region capture can be problematic.. I only added screen color picker support to image editor now so it won't run when color picker opened from region capture.. ShareX by default overwrites files uploaded to FTP with same file name.. You can write static name here so it will be always same:\n. ShareX files corrupted. Uninstall and reinstall it.. Added in https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/commit/0047bc087a8dd7c8a267f51a03e104d879cbbfdb. Those are not translatable easily. Because it just shows variable names automatically.. Start recording hotkey also stops it.. Duplicate of #1554. You literally translated non existent stuffs because your repo was months old. Like this file ShareX.HelpersLib/Automate/AutomateForm.uk.resx is not even exists anymore in ShareX. Also you re added my removed files back. So you should have pull latest changes from ShareX repo first and then work on it. But easiest way would be for you to re fork it so you would have up to date data and work on it.. That option already exists:\n. > Honestly I don't understand why the sharing is part of the core functionality of what is ostensibly a screen capture application and not an optional add-on or plug-in.\nIt is literally part of application name ShareX. Initial versions of ShareX didn't even had any screen capture functionality. High percentage of users downloads ShareX to be able to upload screenshots. People who wants to only screen capture can already use built in snipping tool.. I wouldn't like filling https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/releases with countless beta releases. Because then normal users wouldn't be able to find stable builds.\nYou know this right? https://getsharex.com/docs/dev-builds. All those stuffs you counting probably have their own download servers and not using GitHub releases for beta.. https://brave-download.global.ssl.fastly.net/multi-channel/releases/dev/0.22.669/winx64/BraveSetup-x64.exe\nhttps://atom-installer.github.com/v1.26.1/AtomSetup-x64.exe\nBoth not using releases for actual download link. And probably not for updates too.. I also mark releases as pre-release initially so I wouldn't be able to use it as beta marker.. When releasing I'm marking them as pre-release first and people can get it 3 days early than normal users. If there is no bugs then I remove pre-release tag so everyone can get it. If there is bugs then I fix and release another version as non pre-release.. I will remove those deprecated uploaders in 3 days. So I can make sure none of them was temporary down.. http://2.gp opens but url shortening not works for https links.. I don't have roadmap. I'm implementing as soon as idea come to my mind. If you are asking changelog for next version, I'm sharing them in Discord server when I work on it.. These should be english:\n. Because FFmpeg doing recording and GIF encoding, it won't be easy for ShareX to add borders. And I don't have plans to implement GIF editing functionality..

People keep accidentally switching rectangle region tool to circle region tool with mouse wheel without be aware of it, therefore I needed to disable that shortcut.

It was using Bounds = CaptureHelpers.GetScreenBounds(); so it is supposed to use your whole screen but I guess because of this this.WindowState = FormWindowState.Maximized; it was just using active screen? In your code you are also just changing location but not size but because of maximized it handles size I guess. Which is not good practice.\nMaybe you should use Bounds = GetActiveScreenBounds(); and then change window state to be not maximized?\nBecause I don't have multi monitor I didn't know how it works before..

There is many ways to upload data (multipart-data, raw data, url query, json data etc.), you only made it work for your own purpose which is raw data upload. So like this it is not acceptable.

Yes most likely GDI+ handling all saving.. Because this issue happens to very small amount of people I don't prefer that workaround. If everyone was getting incorrect colors then of course this would be necessary, but there must be something different in your computer causing this issue. Not to mention I'm not sure is there a reason that header could be necessary for some users, otherwise why would Microsoft decide to include it by default with no option at all?. Of course it must be fixed but just I was not fond of that workaround you showed. Only if there were built in GDI+ way to solve it while saving.. I don't prefer to add external libraries as long as it is not necessary. Especially when you consider just ImageMagick is bigger than ShareX itself. But you can use ImageMagick CLI to convert BMP to PNG (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php). Which means ShareX can save image as BMP and actions feature can be used to launch ImageMagick CLI to convert BMP to PNG. But then I noticed that I must add new setting to actions to be able to delete source file if output file name is different than source file name.. Actually you can use ImageMagick CLI to fix gamma header like this I think: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49449220/how-can-i-fix-pngs-gamma-using-imagemagick\nSo there won't be problem about removing source file too.. Your workaround was also not elegant.. This means freeze happens because of News section but why it was not happening before and now it suddenly started to happen for few people. It even happens to previous version, so not to do with latest version changes..

So I was added fake items to cause scroll bar to appear in my news panel yet still couldn't reproduce the issue in my PC. That layout function was ugly workaround I needed to use to make unnecessary horizontal scroll bar to disappear. Whatever other workarounds I tried was not working so it was my last resort. For example this is how it shows when I add one more fake item to cause horizontal scroll bar to appear and disable that layout workaround:\n\nand this is with layout workaround:\n\nSo without that layout codes, horizontal scroll bar shows up there.\n\nso the else branch is called which results in the horizontal scroll being added back for some reason and it triggers another change event\n\nWithout else branch this will happen:\n\nSo it is necessary.\nI'm still not sure why majority of users don't have this freeze yet it still causing it to very few people. Also because I needed to add fake item to cause this horizontal scroll bar to show, something must be different in your PC, like using Windows with high DPI?.

Replied in https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/issues/2299#issuecomment-464227489. It is not. It redirects from dropbox.com to dropboxusercontent.com.. Redirecting means there is two different requests. So making people do two requests to shorten domain length slightly is not ideal. It will delay the time that people will see image.. Duplicate of #3884. Duplicate of #2067. What is your after capture tasks settings?. Because with this options I can't reproduce it:\n. You literally reverted all my changes to how it was before. Long years ago I was also using timers and it was giving choppy experience. Main problem with using timer is, it is not high resolution timer so it's interval can trigger with different timings like even if you set it to 15ms it can trigger 30ms later. So my aim was making it smooth as possible. Also not having high resolution timer is the reason why I couldn't add max fps option to limit it to for example max 100 fps with Thread.Sleep etc. too.\nAlso there is no such thing as rendering it only when necessary because there can be a lot of animated stuffs in screen which requires rendering all the time, for example ant selection lines which always moving. Sure you can calculate regions of all animated objects and only re draw that regions in screen but it can get very complicated when there is a lot of animated objects. But there is one optimization I could do which is when region capture/image editor window lose focus then it stops rendering. So if someone do alt tab to work on something else then image editor won't try to render for no reason.\nEven I used your system before and know how choppy it can be, still gave it a shot and pulled your PR for testing and I was right. Magnifier following cursor is so choppy it feels like 10 fps animation with that random jumping etc. So it is not acceptable like this and if it were I would have keep it like this before.\nFor people who prefer lower cpu and battery usage, can use Region capture (Light) which also using timers like yours: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX.ScreenCaptureLib/Forms/RegionCaptureLightForm.cs#L73\nOr they can use proper image editor software which will render only when there is changes. But this is just region capture form modified to act like image editor with a lot of workarounds. If I wanted to make normal image editor instead of on screen annotation, I would have made rendering system like that too.. Dev builds have same versions as yours because I don't increase version each commit. That version I showed there is AppVeyor build number. So there is no real auto update system for dev builds, I just used same dialogs to make it easier to dl dev builds.. Custom uploader supports body types in dev build if you would like to try it: https://getsharex.com/docs/dev-builds\nSo in next version it gonna be possible to use that service with custom uploader system.. Custom uploader of it: https://github.com/ShareX/CustomUploaders/blob/master/short.cm.sxcu. . In this window:\n\nUse this pattern:\n%y-%mo-%d_%h-%mi-%s\n%pn_%y-%mo-%d_%h-%mi-%s. With Text (Background) tool selected change Fill Color option to transparent color, that way it won't have background. If you mean border by background box, then increase border size if it is 0.. Looks like your .NET Framework become corrupt, so you must reinstall that.. It happens when ShareX run as admin by installer after upgrade. So closing ShareX and reopening it will fix the issue.. You selected \"Copy file to clipboard\" but didn't \"Save image to file\" so there is nothing to copy. Maybe you wanted to select \"Copy image to clipboard\" instead.. You can ask questions in our Discord server.. It is on purpose because 12.4.1 only have slight bug fix, not any new features. Otherwise people gonna think that new update don't have any new features. So only 12.4.0 changelog is matters to users.. Click Upload tab and check override option.. Documents\\ShareX\\ApplicationConfig.json\nDocuments\\ShareX\\Backup\\ApplicationConfig.json\nRemove these two files.. Which version was installed before?. If you upgraded from 12.3.1 then it don't even have any backward compatibility codes there.. I don't see anything wrong, it using Arial font correctly.. Why should it look same?. What ShareX version are you using?. That nginx server returns 403 forbidden error which is mainly to do with authorization problem. So not looks like to do with ShareX.. I see now, problem happens because when parsing response to generate URL, it check is response text is empty. Because your host returns empty response, it not tries to generate result URL.\nI asked in here for you guys to test final version: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/issues/2299#issuecomment-464225861\nIf you did before this could be avoided.. Yes empty response is valid thing. So I will fix it.. You can test the fix with dev build.. If you open \"Debug -> Debug log\" from main window, is there any error text?. Pastebin is blocked in my country. I meant check debug log after try enabling it from application settings.. Uncheck \"Append remote directory\" option.. You can create \"Upload from clipboard\" hotkey, then copy text you want to upload and press that hotkey.. > will ShareX consider releasing builds for other operating systems\nYou are aware Win Forms in .NET Core is Windows only, right?. You didn't close your old ShareX. So it opens when you run new versions.. This option is \"True\" right?\n. He resolved the issue.. This setting does that:\n. Create \"Upload from clipboard\" hotkey.. Clicking on it opens fullscreen preview, is that not enough?. Duplicate of #205. You can already change jpeg quality.. Duplicate of #2736. You are asking this option in region capture?\n. Did you uncheck option I showed to you?. Region capture have that panel.. In after capture tasks menu you must have disabled upload option.. Thanks.. Most likely Windows Defender controlled folder access feature or another anti virus blocking ffmpeg.exe.. You can change border size.. You can also move image if you hold mouse 3 button.. Your code conventions all over the place. Whole project using upper case for functions yet you used both lowercase and uppercase randomly for functions:\n\nAlso randomly starting private variables with _ character:\n\nWhats up with this double empty lines and spaces:\n\n\n\nYou didn't even bother naming controls or using same naming format we used for form controls:\n\nYou could use mega icon stored in resources for form icon instead of storing icon as base64 inside resx file.\nFor folder icons you could have used same icon set we used for all icons already: http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/icons/downloads/fugue-icons-3.5.6.zip\n. Why you removed auto updating?\n. It wasn't in use in Debug but in use in Release.\n. Is this correct?\n. I can't find this myListView1 in UI.\nEdit: It was outside of group box area therefore not visible and not used.\n. I don't understand why you used extensions like that in here. Not to mention you converted string to string there.\nExtensions used like this: SeafileCheckAccInfoResponse.usage.ToSizeString()\n. This sub item not used at all?\n. ReadOnly one not make sense here and for validate one you could have just used !Config.SeafileIsLibraryEncrypted\n. isEncrypt don't used anywhere.\n. I'm not sure why you did new Form() here.\n. ?\n. What is this for? User-agent header already shows that request is from ShareX.\n. I don't like having unnamed controls in forms.\n. What this() do here?\n. Why ToCMYK() here?\n. I don't like default rectangle info text to show CIE here.\n. $cie maybe?\n. What are these?\n. Why there is two reference include here?\n. I add contributions with date order not randomly.\n. You expect api key always but your web site have anonymous upload support. So if api key is empty it should use \"PUBLIC\" api key automatically. So this validation should return true always.\n. But better way would be using AccountTypeControl custom control which allows to set anonymous or user. And disable api key textbox if anonymous.\n. Why you reverted my changes in here?\n. I wonder why is this added.\n. Tip: You can use URLHelpers.CombineURL(Config.UploadURL, result.Response); to combine urls more safely.\n. Why tab characters used here?\n. All controls should have name.\n. Why there is change here?\n. Did you tried SendRequestJSON method?\n. Why string format here?\n. It is already \"multipart/form-data\"\n. This is true by default.\n. You were changed control name but resx still using old name.\n. This will make loop if dialog is canceled. Not to mention when someone right click to edit specific image that person won't like getting dialog to select another image.\n. ",

Seconded. I haven't actually looked at the UI source, but I'm assuming that it's because it uses pixels instead of a relative measurement. Inherent winforms behavior? shrug\n. @ipwnall I'd put money on the fact that those other programs either used WPF, used custom controls, or were written in C++ (so everything was custom). I think the real blocker here is that this is a winforms app so a lot of that stuff will have to be solved by hand (if at all) and I'm assuming that is no easy task, but I don't have a strong background in UI.\nThe project seems to be pretty well broken out though; maybe it's time for a port/upgrade? It seems that most of the work would be in converting forms to views. I think the MVVM conversion would be optional, at least as a first pass.\n. Adding to @jmunson screenshot, this is also a screen from my 4k Dell XPS 15\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XUcFzUt.png\nittybittybuttons. @AluminiumTech They look proportional and similar to how they do on a 2k monitor, don't they? I believe the effort was to fix the scaling, not optimize it for 4k, right?. @AluminiumTech I don't disagree, however inflating those elements will undoubtedly have other unintended UX side effects in the same way vein as them being too small. It sounds more like you're asking for a UI/UX overhaul, which would be a separate issue.. @AluminiumTech perhaps. Still sounds like a different issue then :) dev's choice!. Heeyyyyyy fun news: .Net core 3 is bringing WinForms into the mix and seems to have a lot of threads to pull on to modernize this application without too much effort. \ud83d\udcaf .",

It was more just asking if it were possible, not asking for a feature or anything. @stuntguy3000 there is the option to copy the url of the 'newly uploaded share' to the clipboard which is a convenient feature, only downside is in order to use that share url, I need to strip the s from the https (hence the ahk mention).. No biggy, if anything, the other end should accommodate the https rather than force us to go sub standard. well the most recent case came when doing mission testing for a game.\nUnfortunately to do the testing, you must upload, then insert the link\nin-game so that the game can download the uploaded mission and you can\naccess and test it.

It looks like the \"Perform Actions\" job is only done for image captures, which have an image UploadTask created for them that handles all of the post-capture stuff.  Screen recordings are handled as files and not images, so they never go through the DoAfterCaptureJobs method.  Instead their post-capture jobs are handled at line 179 of ScreenRecordForm, but that code only deals with uploading the capture and copying it to the clipboard.\nDoesn't seem like it would be very much trouble to move the bit of code that executes external programs in DoAfterCaptureJobs out into its own method somewhere and have it called by both image captures and screen recordings.\nTo be honest this is a pretty minor enhancement, and one that I'm sure 99% of people wouldn't notice, so I'll probably just copy/paste the code and compile it for myself tomorrow once I can figure out all the missing references.

The amount of options ShareX provides is impressive, so I don't understand either why an option that's standard for all of the other software I'm familiar with isn't available.\nFrom a user's perspective, not having your screen locked down is extremely advantageous. One of the main uses for a screen capture tool is to preempt something that you're trying to capture, so not being able to see what happens while using the rectangle (or other shape) function is extremely limiting, while providing no real benefit to the user. I'm actually unsure what advantage there is to having the screen frozen, because the lack of responsiveness from what you're trying to capture is more inhibiting than actually not being able to screen capture. You mentioned a possible problem would be decreased fps, but I'm not sure why decreased fps would be preferred over 0 fps from a frozen screen.\nAs I mentioned, the other software listed that provide similar functions force unfrozen screens with no option to freeze it, so having a software that provides both options would be useful.\n.

Hi @petterroea , I work on Up1 and we're experiencing similar issues with our recently merged ShareX support. Our current theory is that this may be related to TLS session resumption on CloudFlare.

I'll let you know if we discover any further details or a way to fix this.\n.

(so at the very least, avoid scanning password,passphrase,sensitive image, wallet address, qrcode, private key, etc...)\n@Jaex : Would you know of any \"on-premise\" or \"self-hosted\" alternative we could use instead of the third-party's API for this ? Would be a great privacy enhancement.. ",

    "archon810": "Bah, that sucks. What about a setting for uploading urls to images as images instead of shortening them? Would that be possible?\n. :D\n. Sounds great. Testing it in v9, however, I can't seem to make this work using the Clipboard Upload keyboard shortcut. If I have a url like http://www.pbh2.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/weirdest-gifs.gif in the clipboard, nothing happens in ShareX. It's like it doesn't react to it. I only have the first relevant option enabled in Clipboard upload settings, which should be doing the trick.\n. 9.0.1 doesn't do it either. Maybe I'm missing something more fundamental here?\nHere's what happens for me: http://i.imgur.com/iTuqvs4.gif\n. But it never happens. To this moment, the only upload listed in ShareX I have is the local GIF file I used to upload the demo of how it doesn't work above. No link -> file uploads.\n. @Jaex No reason really, I found it easy to create a GIF and upload it using ShareX using Imgur as I don't have anything set up for doing that to movies and I've never used ShareX's screen recorder before. I have a very specific use case for ShareX to super quickly upload images to Imgur and shorten links. I should explore ShareX's other capabilities, though I must admit the mix of multiple levels of settings and tools confuses me at times.\n. @McoreD As far as I'm aware. I have Imgur configured, and I don't think After Capture applies, since I only want this to happen to manual clipboard upload requests (whether by pushing the Upload Clipboard button or by using the keyboard shortcut). I don't use ShareX to actually capture images directly anyway.\nUpload Clipboard used to work as a url shortener before this change, so I know it used to trigger at least.

That\u2019s why there is filename field on the bottom with suggested name. And when user marks \u201cSave to file\u201d and changes filename field, the capture is expected to be saved exactly with that name.. > So I cheated and added it for screen recording too\nThis issue should be label as Enhancement then since current (screencasted) behaviour is so misleading.\nIndeed, the recorded session should be renamed as specified by user in filename field.. @Jaex, indeed, rokket.space\u2019s config should be added to Destination/File Uploader/Pomf. \n1: https://rokket.space/sharex.

With the about menu, couldn't you ignore image data inside the client area of the target window when doing a difference check? If the \"timing issue\" is just that the window contents differ between two internal captures, I'd imagine ignoring the client area in the difference check would be effective.\n. I'll get this forked/building and experiment a bit later in the week, I think a solution could be written like:\n- Capture multiple white/black pairs. You know the transparent areas are not moving. Calculate transparent regions for each pair, take the set-wise intersection of this set of pixels should be the aero transparency. \n- Alternatively to taking the strict intersection, prefer to create large contiguous areas of these sets.\n- Alternatively, flow analysis on the multiple sets to ignore animated areas\n. Could make it an option to try harder if transparent capture fails, disabled by default. The time wouldn't be extremely significant, but yeah, very-many-frame approaches would be prohibitive for constant usage.\n. Transparent ShareX animation!\nFirst attempt: Capture a second black-white pair, determine transparency by differences.

The issue here is finding a way to pass the new signature to the updater as it wouldn't be included in the update executable presumably. Please keep your private key on a disconnected flash drive or in an encrypted container or something when you're not signing an update. Also don't lose it, make backups.\nMoney comes into play with the Microsoft route to be a \"trusted publisher.\" They require your certificate to be approved by a CA, which in general costs money. I'm unsure if that's required for their code signing functionality.\nI'd also file this as a significant security flaw instead of an enhancement. If anyone is able to publish a malicious release via any means, everyone using sharex may be compromised (this is a large number of people).\nIt would also look very good on ShareX to take proactive security measures like this.\n. This does not need to be a complex or extremely advanced improvement. Code signing is a very simple way to establish trust. As a user of the internet in TYOOL 2015, you should already have at least one priv/pub keypair, you should already be a little familiar with how public key cryptography works. \n\"But  other software...\" is not an excuse for lax security practices. Yes, there are security issues in other software as well.\nMost open source software does not have auto-update components. The choice to include this makes it the developer's responsibility to ensure the mechanism is secure. For example, the slightly popular apt-get tool has code signing verification built in. \nShareX is hosted on a third party service(which is very large, and may have its own potential security flaws) with the only access restriction to uploading a new version being having access to one of the contributor accounts. It'll then download and execute this content -- it's your obligation to minimize the risk of this content being malicious.\nin regards to public forums linking to this: any software that doesn't take security seriously is harmful for your computer. there's quite a few groups that behave in this manner, hopefully sharex isn't one of them but that's apparently still to be determined? \"it's being worked on\" is really the only response necessary.\n. If your English is not good I'd like to confirm this: You closing this issue means this is not something you think should be fixed in ShareX. Is that really what you think?\nThere are educational materials on public key cryptography in almost every language. Tell me what you'd prefer it in and I'd provide it.\n. Daniel is entirely correct. Jaex needs only to keep a private and public key to himself, and then provide a signature on new releases. I can't contribute this patch personally as I have other obligations for the near future.\n. Daniel is entirely correct. Jaex needs only to keep a private and public key to himself, and then provide a signature on new releases. I can't contribute this patch personally as I have other obligations for the near future.\n. Hey Jaex, \nIssues don't mean \"I will do this issue,\" it means \"this issue might be done by someone eventually.\" Closing an issue means you as the \"ShareX\" project and all contributors (not you personally) have completed or rejected it. Open issues have no other implications to the English-speaking world than this.\nPast versions may not be able to auto-update if you lose your private key. This is why you should certainly back that private key up. Thus, it will never get lost. If you cannot keep a single file backed up, maybe there is another reliable contributor that could handle signing releases? Alternatively, if the file could not be verified, let the user know and shellexecute the github page to open it in a browser so that they may determine the legitimacy of an update themselves.\nIf you do not understand public key encryption in 2015, and are in a non-English speaking country, it is of utter importance to yourself to learn it and how to use it anyways -- regardless of this issue.\n.

It is inferred by the meaning of the word \"issue,\" and also how it is treated by every other respected project. \"Issue\" does not mean \"Something I will personally do.\" Issues are sorted in the tracker by last modified, so issues that have no community support or desire for implementation fall to the bottom of the tracker naturally. If you look at a real, normal, software project -- there are older issues in the backlog. This is common. Not everything is resolvable or easily resolvable. Bugs are not closed if they are not resolved (this is a bug).\nIn regards to the private key concern, you should test the verified update functionality before pushing the first release with it. If it is working once, you really cannot break it unless you modify the related code.\nI don't know anything about your knowledge. You think this isn't a significant concern, so I am left to assume the worst.\n@WebFreak001 People didn't think hackers were able to upload new puu.sh versions.

Here is the problem, but I'm not sure the solution:\n- When Debug window is opened, it starts capturing all of the log messages and showing them\n- When Debug window is opened from tray, it starts saving the configuration files\n- While writing log messages to first Debug window about saving the configuration files, it tries to open the new Debug window\n- Program freezes on this lock (loggerLock)\n- The second Debug window is trying to open, but gets stuck waiting for the lock, which never becomes available b/c it was locked writing messages to first Debug window\nThis only happens when opening from tray, because it causes config files to be saved.\n.

If you just select 'Annotate' from quick task menu, then that is all that ShareX is going to do. (I understand that just annotating might not be what you intended).\nFrom inside the Greenshot image editor, you have the options to save, upload, copy to clipboard.\n. Then the green check mark should be renamed.  It just returns to ShareX for\nit to do whatever was set to do. If you are choosing just Annotate, then\nuse save button in Greenshot toolbar if you decide to save.\nOn Oct 16, 2016 00:51, \"Alex Mills\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nYep, see step 4.

It should be \"Confirm and close\" or some such.\n. What version of ShareX do you have? If it is 11.1, then you might have the bug mentioned at #1796 \nOtherwise, it sounds like you're asking for #1028\n. Under Task Settings / Advanced:\n\nChange the setting to False to use Greenshot image editor.\nNote: In newest builds, the full screen image editor has gained a toolbar as well.\n. I don't believe there is anything in the code that passes the filename to the image editor. \nIt will always open the file dialog to let you select an image.\nThe exception is if an image is on the clipboard, it will prompt and ask if you want to edit that image.\nThis would have to be a new feature.\n.

Based on the comments in #2075, I think you are wanting more options when you choose Upload inside the Greenshot editor.\nClicking Upload in the Greenshot image editor just tells the main program to continue executing after capture and after upload tasks.\nThere are many options in those menus that will probably satisfy what you are looking for.\n. This works fine for me.\nIs your RDP session in full screen or windowed? Can you explain how \"Always on top\" would solve your problem?. That's interesting that is the response that gave you.\nFrom the API submission form, it says open-source apps should use the beta key vice a private production key.\n\nIf your app is a form of a bot (ie. hubot), for internal purposes, open source, or for a class project, we highly recommend you institute the beta key for your app. Unless you're making thousands of requests per IP, you shouldn't have any issues.\n\nHowever, the API license terms have other odd requirements even if you did choose to implement it:\n\nYou shall (i) conspicuously label any Application with the words \"Powered by Giphy,\" and the Giphy logo, and (ii) comply with the branding requirements that we may provide to you from time to time. .

It would be helpful if you're willing to say what the URL was as well since you seem to think it might be related to capturing that page.. The green check mark means \"Accept and perform tasks\" (the after capture and upload tasks).\nBecause you are just editing, there are no tasks, so the arrow, stop and cancel buttons are not shown.. There are no plans to merge any additional functionality from Greenshot into the image editor in ShareX.. Well, the older version of Greenshot image editor is already included and there is work to duplicate all of that functionality in ShareX proper.\nYou can try it out by going to Task Settings / Advanced and under General, set UseShareXForAnnotation to True.\n. That would be interesting feature.\nIf you are looking for something that could immediately solve your example situation, look at OnTopReplica (https://ontopreplica.codeplex.com/). In this case, you are trying to edit a HTML file with the image editor.

It might be difficult to determine as ShareX doesn't know the image is from the web.

ShareX is using language features of C# 7.0 which are not supported in Visual Studio 2015 - only Visual Studio 2017.\nYour easiest solution is to install Visual Studio 2017. If you don't want to do that or can't, then you'll have to edit your local code to not use the new features.\nFor example, the first screen shot you posted is using inline out parameter declaration (See Out variables on https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/03/09/new-features-in-c-7-0/)\nTo compile in VS2015, you'll have to change it from this:\nif (ColorPickerForm.PickColor(Color, out Color newColor))\n            {\n                Color = newColor;\n            }\nto this:\nColor newColor;\n            if (ColorPickerForm.PickColor(Color, newColor))\n            {\n                Color = newColor;\n            }\nYou'd have to make that type of change in every location. I believe ShareX is also using expression bodied members and maybe tuples. So you'd have to edit all of those as well.. You are doing something wrong. ShareX is the easiest program to build I've ever helped with.\nI just redownloaded a clean copy of the source code, opened it in VS2017 and compiled everything without any issues. You shouldn't have to remove or relink any references.. All of those errors are for components that are built from ShareX, not downloaded.\n- You did Build / Rebuild Solution?\n- Have you tried using a directory path that only contains ASCII characters? (I don't know why Unicode characters wouldn't work). @Pinguish You have to follow the license. https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/LICENSE.txt. Take a look at #2501 and #1236 . @Denyerec Sorry, I'm not knowledgeable enough on color profiles or what exactly is going on to provide you an answer. I was hoping the linked issues might help you.\nAre you saying the the JPG from ShareX contains ICC profile, but the PNG does not (as verified by looking at image properties in an editor or viewer, not visually)? Can you upload 2 sample images?. When you go into Windows Display settings, what resolution does it show?\nIn ShareX, if you go to Tools / Ruler and then hover over the empty desktop, what dimensions does it show? \nThis block: \n \n. This appears to be inherent in Windows, not just ShareX. If I scale up my monitor to 2560x1440 as you did, then the builtin Windows print screen and Snipping Tool give the same type of results.\nFor example, this is from Windows Alt-Print Screen of just the calculator. You can see that it is scaled in the same way.\n\nIt may be difficult or not possible to resolve this as ShareX basically gets the image from Windows, which can't process it correctly either.\n. Here is the reason for the reported problem (based on what I can tell):\n - Region capture starts\n - ShareX reads the mouse cursor as being at some position\n - User touches screen to start drawing a region\n - ShareX notices the mouse cursor hasn't moved, so uses that first position as the starting point. But, this is not where the user just touched\nI believe the fix would be to unsure mouse cursor position is updated on the mouse down event rather than using the last update position from when mouse \"moved\". @Jaex I didn't think mouse move was being used, but the idea is the same.\nHere is what happens:\n\nI open the menu and select Region Capture.\nNotice that it opens with cursor at 1098,234.\nI then click in the top right (you can see the touch animation). ShareX starts the selection rectangle based on where the cursor is displayed (1098,234) even though I never clicked there. The cursor position is not being updated based on where I touch, instead using the original value.. I think maybe a change is needed around that first time upload screen.\n - A command line option to not show it\n - Or an existing command line option prevents it from being shown\n - Or even an optionfor DisableUpload\nHave to see what Jaex thinks\n. See https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/issues/2436#issuecomment-294494879. And you still can't upload to imgur?. This can be done fairly easily, but I'm not sure it will be useful for most users.\n\nEdit: Also, for some reason the size doesn't get set exactly as chosen. It gets shorted 7-8 pixels in height and twice that in width. Something to do with Windows 10 I suppose.. Yes, it may be because you are on a Mac. Both of those lines are trying to run Windows command prompt statements.\nThe first creates that file if it doesn't exist.\nThe second creates a hash for a release build.\nYou can do the first one manually and then remove both of those lines from the project file.\n. Do you always have that problem in Chrome?\nDo you have that problem if you run Chrome in Incognito mode?.

You didn't link a commit with a fix or mark the issue wontfix (aside from your initial response when I opened the ticket).\nIs the issue resolved, or did you decide it wasn't worth the effort?\n. It may be possible to include a list of updated files with each update, then check each to see if each file is in use by any application other than ShareX and warn the user before starting the installer. Not sure how easy this would be to implement though.\nAlternatively, it might be possible to switch to a different installer, or write a simple installer yourself, but these would both probably be too much effort to resolve what is a relatively uncommon issue.\n. And the other options?\n. I'm not sure I understand, I mentioned several possible solutions. Specifically, I think this might be reasonable:\n\"It may be possible to include a list of updated files with each update, then check each to see if each file is in use by any application other than ShareX and warn the user before starting the installer. Not sure how easy this would be to implement though.\"\nWould this not work?\n. It's likely that is uses it to provide its remote desktop feature; however, I don't think the reason it uses the file has any relevance.\nIf you don't want to implement some complicated system to detect when the installer will need to close a particular program, just add a short warning to the end of the update dialog box and leave it at that.\n. Yeah, which is why I thought manually checking for open files might be a good idea. If you think that would be too difficult or time consuming to do, I guess we really are out of options. :/\n. This temporarily resolves the issue, but it starts happening again after an hour or so.\nI've noticed that imgur added a captcha at some point in the past (the support article about it was added on the 11th); maybe that's related?\n.

Because Captura controls the input stream, it can much easily pause and resume the recording. ffmpeg does the output file.\nIt's not as simple as changing ShareX input option to stream the images to ffmpeg.

However, you can add a scheduled task with no triggers, call it manually, then remove it (I think this can be done automatically).\nAlternatively, the application can set 'everyone' write permissions on the application folder, or install it to programdata (chrome does this; it's annoying but it works), so that updates don't need to be run as administrator.\n. An alternative way of doing this, as mentioned above, is to simply show the dialog box shown when uploading from the clipboard. This would probably be preferable anyways, as it would then apply to clipboard uploads as well.\n. I'm not sure what you mean. When I right click a file to upload it, I don't get any options, it uploads automatically based on the predefined settings in the program. I'm asking for a way to choose when I upload whether I want it uploaded to the filehosting setting or the image/text/other hosting setting.\n. ",

I have been using it for almost 5-6 years now and it is a piece of software that I use almost every single day!  So again thank you @Jaex for keeping the project alive these past years and sharing it with the world!\nEverytime I see an update, I am just amazed at the software has evolved to be more awesome over and over again!   With that said, I can't wait to see what else you come up with in the future.  At the same time, I don't want the project to shed away to far from it;s main purpose and become some bloated piece of crap!  I am confidant that you will not allow that to happen though as you have only added awesome and useful features so far, so thanks again and look forward to the future of ShareX!\nBTW I am constantly promoting the app to other people as I feel like it really is a hidden Gem!  So many people would love this app if they just knew it existed and more importantly knew just how powerful and how many feature it has!  It;s hard to teach people of all the good features though as people are lazy and wont take the time to discover and learn things...either way it;s there loss!  I will keep spreading the word though!\n- Jason\n- Twitter - @JasonDavisFL\n. Amazing, thanks you really have thought of it all!\n. Sorry just now saw your replies.  While I agree no self respecting developer uses IE, it does generally exist on a PC for at least testing and I figured it was better than requiring the use of a Chrome extension separate from the program.  At least in some cases!\nAnyways it seems you have added in support for it now so thank you that is great!\nHere is a demo screenshot that turned out amazing!  http://i.imgur.com/89GzOyi.png\nThis website has a fixed header bar and a fixed sidebar advertisement block which generally show chopped up multiple times in the screenshot when using Chrome screenshot extensions...using the took you implemented, it shows them perfectly better than any other screenshot tool I have used on that site so that is very awesome!\n. Thats great, I use the software daily for years now and love it, thank you!\nCould you kindly explain how to do the upload from URL feature please?\nI am aware of the Upload from Clipboard feature which I believe requires the actual file to be copied to clipboard and not a URL so I haven't noticed the Upload from URL feature yet\nThanks for the work and sharing with the world!\n. oh wow....perfect thank you so much!  I plan to write another detailed blog/article on my web development blog soon to promote this amazing software.  I can't imagine life without it now after a good 5 years of usage, much respect!\n.

BTW changing to 32 seems to have resolved my FTP image issue, thanks!\n\nApplication Settings >> Upload >> Buffer Size >> 32kb\n\n\n. @Nathanael-Mtd Thanks.  BTW does your version simple change that 1 buffer setting value or it does other things too?  Thanks\n. ahh good idea!  Thank you\n. I think this would be a great feature.  I don't use any of the cloud services and prefer to upload to my own server so I always use the FTP uploader.  It's great that the FTP uploader has option for different FTP entry for text, image, and file but would just be even more useful if there was a way to filter by file extension as well.\nDoes this sound like something that you might be interested in implementing some time down the line into ShareX?\nAlso I know you have the ways for people to donate $ to the project but have you considered making a \"Pro\" version and perhaps only allow non paid users to only use a few of the destination options and a paid license would unlock all of them.  Maybe even lock and unlock other features this could bring a good source of $ for the project which could help to implement even more features!\nJust thinking out loud I have used ShareX for like 6+ years and I tell everyone about it as there really is nothing even close to as good and useful as it is!  Thanks for all your work over the years and sharing it\n. I have been using this app since it was released many years ago and it is 1 of my top used apps.  \nMy dream update would be to convert the tools to a plugin system so that tools can be added/removed as well as the ability to easily add new tools. Ok another idea to solve my issue:\nIf I run a process/app on my PC to zip/archive my backup files on a regular basis and automatically save the files to a folder that ShareX is watching.  Before saving the file to the ShareX watched folder it will delete the existing file with the same name and then same the new copy which triggers ShareX to upload the new version over the old one on the remote server.

There are stutters, audio crackle and such (as such in the video as well of course) in the app (epsxe) I'm recording.

FFMPEG is hopeless. (It also consistently butchers lossless full-range video. BT primaries are wrong or it becomes limited range.

Hi, thanks for the answer! You are truly supporting the program like a boss here, or on IRC. The thing is, I never even use GUI of sharex, I do everything with command line - I use slickrun to fire up the commands. And I don't use \"region capture\" at all. It took me a while to even find the tips. ShareX has so many features, that it gets easy to get lost.\n. Because for some people hotkeys are convenient, for others they are not. You probably know CloudApp. I would say it is expensive alternative to shareX, albeit it is very polished. I was using it for years and I jumped the ship because you have command line support. Sorry but I am not able to remember 5-15 hotkeys and screenshot capture is not only thing I do, I am not going to map whole keyboard to do 500 things. I mean how I am supposed to remember what \"ctrl + shift + 5\" does? Is it fullscreen capture of primary monitor with cursor, edit and then upload to imgur, or is it a videocapture? Or is it completely different shortcut for different application?\nThat is why I use commands:\nsx - opens shareX\nss - screenshot, upload imgur\nsse - screenshot, edit, upload imgur\nssg - gif, upload imgur\nssv - video, upload streamable\nssc - tool, color picker\nssq - tool QR (here my script does not work - how to automatically generate QR from clipboard?)\nssirc - tool, IRC - Why did you cut if from latest version ? :cry: \nssr - tool, ruler...\nHow can possibly someone remember this in form of shortcuts? Also, typing 3 letters is WAY faster then unnatural, 3 key hotkey combo. Even if you use \"ctrl+prtscr\" you have to look on your keyboard, where I am able to fire up the command without looking or pressing the wrong hotkey combo.\n. Use the mouse - that is what \"terminal\" people really don't like to do. As for the command vs. hotkey discussion goes, I am willing to bet, that people in general are able to remember more commands than hotkey combos. Imagine 100 hotkeys, vs. 100 commands. Anyway, I just think everyone should what they like. You like hotkeys and mouse and I have no problem with that, as long as you support command line, I am very very happy!\n. Men, I just don't want to waste your time. It is amazing you are developing the software and I do not want to be one of those ungrateful assholes who just bitch about everything, demand features and provide nothing. Your command line is sufficient enough, it would be nice if I do not have to select region, hit space or anything, but that is very very very little of a problem. It does not make sense to you, I am not going to argue or push you :+1: .

Why would you even use gif?. Safari on both mac and ios do not support webms that will be the only issue, you can combat this by encoding an mp4 (this is also suggested when working with photoshop, as adobe don\u2019t support them either, you\u2019ll only see them used on the web really)\nYou\u2019ll find that giphy and imgur have both moved their animated media to display mp4s these days\nAnd you aren\u2019t so much going to get a pixel perfect gif either if the colour pallet is restricted to 256 colours, an alternative to this is to use ffmpeg to dump your capture as lossless image sequence, which depends on your use-case.. It shouldn't be a secret that ShareX's desktop capture is an extension out of ffmpeg. With the right command for ffmpeg you should be able to successfully make a custom work flow for the precision you require, as the screen recorder takes a custom command line . @Long-Horse Can you post the 'Show Error' log from a failed upload?\nYou can find this from the context menu on the main window\n\n.

So hoping you have not given up on finding a fix for it please.\nI have used Zscreen, ZUploader, and Greenshot 1.1.9 Build 13, firefox addons Lightshot, fireshot and several others, plus other programs... and there is not this blackened issue with any of them.\n\u25cf So to solve the problem... What is different in  Zscreen and ZUploader (which don't blacken) compared to ShareX \n\u25cf What is Rectangle object for? I see no difference.\nThankyou.\n\n. Thankyou for response.\nI don't use hotkeys.

Okay that is another workaround and seemed to work. But I need to test further to be sure the menu does not remain open with all capture attempts.\nImportant though, it is only for rectangle screenshot and I often use all the other types of capture.\nI know you are busy and your time is valuable but please fix issue so I can use all types of capture without hotkey.\nThankyou.\n. Okay I will test 0.5 delay further to see if all future capture attempts are successful without menu staying open.\nIf it is successful then that is a good easy fix.\nThankyou for your help with problem.\nThis was my settings before... with time delay unchecked:\n\n.

Thankyou very much cra0kalo for finding problem if that is the actual problem !\nJaex\nSo when will there be an actual fix for it please ?\nWhy is this thread closed when there is no instruction for a fix?\nWill there be a ShareX version9.4.3 soon with a fix ?\nThankyou\n.

That is a somewhat workaround for the Stop button.\nBut having to slide the mouse all the way down and search for the ShareX icon to click will add another 2 seconds of wasted empty time onto the animated gif.\nThere is still no solution for viewing the timer. If the gif is only for a few seconds then it doesn't matter, but if for much longer than it is important to see the timer. \nSame situation for viewing the timer for the ffmpeg which can be for several minutes or longer.\nYou need to keep track of the time as there can be a file size limit with uploading.\n.

My previous post was regarding the TIMER count.\nAnd I explained in my second post the reasons why displaying timer count is important.\nJing only does video, it does not do animated gif.\n\n. Good thinking. Good job. Thankyou very much Jaex !\nYou could also add an OPTION to use icons instead of text, with less width padding \nfor the Start/Stop/Abort sections like this:\n\n\n. Stop could be this icon but proper size, bit bigger. And keep the Abort X icon.\nYou could also have a tooltip when hover to state text of button.\nBut less width padding for the Start/Stop/Abort will make a big difference with total width.\n\n. \n\nAbort could also be a cancel delete icon. But I like the X best.\n\n. This is what it could look like with less padding within the Start/Stop/Abort.\n\n\n. Every language must have their own stop sign, so their own language stop sign icon.\nIf that's too difficult\nOkay then, the Start can be text and the Abort an X icon.\nSee my post above  that shows the control panel with less padding.\n. I see.\nBut there is not a code for width to fit text?\nmin-width: px !important; and max-width: px !important; ?\nwidth: -moz-max-content !important;\nIF not then I see the situation.\n. Thankyou but where is download button?\n\n. Okay downloaded succeessfully and it seems to work now thankyou.\nBut new issues:\nFor creating a Gif:\nThe start button has no effect. It just automatically starts and I need time to sort myself and think out exactly what procedure I am going to make for the gif so that I can be sure to include every step in order, and be sure that I keep the file size down low by not wasting any time with wasted steps.\nWhat is the point of having the start button if it does nothing and instantly switches to Stop?\nCan there be an option to have the gif not start until clicking the Start button?\nCan there be a pause button so that I can pause after a step to think out my next step and not record wasted time?\nAfter using shareX once, the second time I click on icon in notification bar it does not work. Nothing happens and no menu opens.\nI have to click the icon in the taskbar to open the main window, close window, then I can click on the icon  in the notification bar to get menu and function. I must ALWAY EVERYTIME click the icon in the taskbar first, open ShareX window,close window, then click on ShareX icon in notification bar to get function. EVERY TIME.\n. 1) Uncheck to stop autostart fixed the problem thankyou Jaex !\n2)  Thankyou for answer and explanation \"FFmpeg does not support Pause\".\n3) Tray menu problem fixed with computer restart!\n. I understand but I use the rounded one often and sometimes the others.\nIs it possible for the menuitem \"Region Capture\" to have a dropdown menu with the other menuitems Rounded rectangle, ellipse, triangle, diamond listed ? \nThis way the menuitems are out of the way for those that don't use them but easy access with a click for those that want them.\nAnd with the number shortcuts listed too the way that browser menus list shortcuts with menuitems?\nThankyou\n\n. I have no idea what you are talking about.\nWhat has cancel and delete capture got to do with keeping Rounded rectangle, ellipse, triangle, diamond listed in the menuitems but listed as a submenu from a dropdown?\nYou said people don't want them but not all people don't want them, because me and my friends want them and I suppose some others do too, maybe not many but some.\nAnd request to display the shortcuts to easily remember them?\nWhat is wrong with that?\nYou do realize that many others are reading your insults to me right?\n. That's one reason Options are for.\n Options are to make everybody happy and then no one complains or bothers you for asking to remove something or for putting something back.\nIn Options you could:\nCheckmark the menuitems that you want to show, and Uncheck the menuitems that you don't want to show instead of just removing from main menuitems.\nEveryone will be happy then.\nI appreciate ShareX and I appreciate all your hard work on it.\nSo then I guess this thread is closed.\n. Because it would end the people asking you to add or remove menuitems.\nBut other applications do not have as many menuitems to deal with as ShareX does, so people do not have a need to ask for menuitem choice and therefore there is no menuitem choice.\nI only know of firefox addons that allow to choose menuitems.\nMenu Editor and Tab Mix Plus and a few more.\nMenu Editor\n\nTab Mix Plus\n\nNo menuitem choice then. Thread closed then.\nThankyou\n. Okay I understand thankyou.\n. You state above fixed #1313: maxfile url update\nBut not fixed in ShareX 10.0 so what can I do to make a code change inside ShareX 10.0 to fix problem for me?\nThankyou\n. Confused because I don't have Pomf.\nI clicked through all the file uploaders and actually all of them from the leftside panel and did not find anything  with maxfile.ro \"result Url\" yet when I screen capture a video it automatically goes to maxfile.ro for upload.\nOther suggestion or what am I doing wrong?\nThankyou\n. Because I want to keep all these menuitems VISIBLE like this format. There is no option to keep them in this menu format in later shareX versions.\n\nI see now how I have maxfile setup here\n\n. See here. No Pomf\n\n. I already told you in the very beginning that I am using ShareX10.0 \nIf it is uploaded to maxfile.ro then there should be a way to change the code inside it I would think. \nDid you see my post pic above?\n. I know it is not the latest version but I explained that I wanted Version 10.0 to keep the menuitems layout the way it was. Are you saying there is no way to fix the maxfile problem in version 10.0?\n\n. It moved to bottom but can it not be set to move to bottom of capture?\nThere is enough space for bottom of capture. Positioned right underneath the capture,\nwhere it does not block the capture.\n. Okay thankyou.\n. But couldn't it be just check top bottom left right ?\nIs that too many checks?\nThen not have to remember to enable Press I button \n. I tried this.\nI went to sharex/Uploaders History/rightclick on it to \"Edit with Notepad++\" OR \"Open with/ notepad\".\nBut there were only 4 images listed there from years ago.\nCan you tell me the correct path \"History.xml in Notepad\" to all those images listed in the sharex history window so that I can delete them. \nThankyou\n. Yes I found that thankyou. Easy to remove all or just one from that folder, but if you need to remove a particular 20 it is difficult without being able to click and see the image to decide to remove.\nBut you explained why. If in the future an easier way to delete is possible then that would be great. Thankyou.\n. Thankyou but this did not work. It behaved as if only \"Show Quick Task Menu\" function.\nThis did nothing at all after capture. I captured, no window appeared, and no host url.\nThis opened window but the opening tab is all unchecked so I had to then read through it and select, then transfer to Destinations tab and choose. Many steps clicking.\nWould be nice if that choice was available with the \"Show Quick Task Menu\" but I guess too much code work.\nThankyou\n. So there is the over ride fact. Okay thankyou.\nYes I noticed the scrollbar issue but is so minor.\nSo this is EXACTLY what I'm looking for. Set up through the \"Quick Task Menu\".\nLess clicks as I only have to set the Destination.\nThis is great it works best for me.\nThankyou\n.

Of course ShareX can do nothing about it, I did not realize it redirects like that, and why it does is strange.\nIt never redirected like that before.\n Maybe remove Tiny Pic from list in ShareX because it is not useable to anyone in this form. Will make the ShareX menu less height with a smaller list. Unless maybe you need have a Tiny Pic account or something. \nThankyou.\n. YESSSSSS ! Perfect !\nThankyou thankyou thankyou !!!!!!!!\n. Windows Vista\nIs this happening for anyone else?\nIf you or anyone else has any ideas of what I can do next to solve this error problem please report here.\nThankyou\n. Why not?\nBecause that is what was loaded into my computer when I bought it and I do not have a new computer.\nDo not need a new computer.\nAre you saying that Windows Vista may be the reason for the error?\n. Thankyou\n. Okay I just didn't want to put it in a place where it would block or interfere with the operation of ShareX like putting it in Documents/ShareX.\nThankyou\n. ",

For this example, video would definitely be better. Gif still has it's use cases all the same. \nAgain you're missing the entire point -  There are many things you can do with gif recordings that aren't obtuse. \nFor what it's worth, my comments regarding your inexperience and closed mindedness are referring to your understanding and handling of user complaints and requests, not your programming skill. \"Bad\" choices for the majority ( but which still have their uses ) should be placed behind a warning or an advanced user setting - not removed entirely. Some users who know what they're doing are still going to want to use them, and 60fps is pretty much the limit of the gif format itself, there's no reason for you to deny usage at that rate because you think it's a bad idea. Make it clear when setting it that it's unsupported, but let it be set ( See my second reply in this issue for examples of solutions to walling off power user options ), options are almost always better than total removal.\n.

For example, if you specified a frame rate of 30, it would capture at 30, but when encoding the delay (100/30=3.333...) could be clipped to just 3, meaning the resultant GIF would be perceived as sped up, since the delay between each pair of consecutive frames would be 33.333...ms too short.\nThe other possible behavior would be to correct the frame rate (by rounding to the closest representable in GIF) before doing the capture, and performing the capture at that corrected rate instead.

Then the capture would be performed at that frame rate, producing a 33.333... fps GIF that has the correct perceived speed.\nSo worst case, you get a GIF running at incorrect speed, and best case you get a GIF at a different frame rate than the one you requested.\nMaybe the free entry should even be replaced with combo box containing a sensible selection of preset frame rates?\n\u00b9: The exhaustive list of supported\u00b2 GIF frame rates: 1 1.010101 1.020408 1.030928 1.041667 1.052632 1.06383 1.075269 1.086957 1.098901 1.111111 1.123596 1.136364 1.149425 1.162791 1.176471 1.190476 1.204819 1.219512 1.234568 1.25 1.265823 1.282051 1.298701 1.315789 1.333333 1.351351 1.369863 1.388889 1.408451 1.428571 1.449275 1.470588 1.492537 1.515152 1.538462 1.5625 1.587302 1.612903 1.639344 1.666667 1.694915 1.724138 1.754386 1.785714 1.818182 1.851852 1.886792 1.923077 1.960784 2 2.040816 2.083333 2.12766 2.173913 2.222222 2.272727 2.325581 2.380952 2.439024 2.5 2.564103 2.631579 2.702703 2.777778 2.857143 2.941176 3.030303 3.125 3.225806 3.333333 3.448276 3.571429 3.703704 3.846154 4 4.166667 4.347826 4.545455 4.761905 5 5.263158 5.555556 5.882353 6.25 6.666667 7.142857 7.692308 8.333333 9.090909 10 11.111111 12.5 14.285714 16.666667 20 25 33.333333 50 100\n\u00b2: As of 2012, most browsers allow delays as low as 0.02s, rounding anything lower than that to 0.1s: http://nullsleep.tumblr.com/post/16524517190/animated-gif-minimum-frame-delay-browser\n\u00b3: ShareX currently doesn't allow entry of fractional frame rates unless using custom commands.. Many other installers seem to have solved this very same issue, somehow.\nFor example, if using a WiX based installer, the Impersonate property allows to do exactly this[1].\nEven if you use something other than WiX for creating the installer, there should be something that provides the same functionality.\n[1] http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/howtos/ui_and_localization/run_program_after_install.html\n. Looking a bit closer, it seems that the problem is not with how the installer is configured, but with how it is launched by ShareX during an upgrade.\nThe problem does not occur upon initial installation, only when upgrading, which means it happens because of how it is launched.\nThe InnoSetup documentation confirms that it should currently work, since the postinstall flag turns on impersonation (i.e. running the program as the original user) by default.\nAlthough I may be wrong, I think it is because the Verb of the ProcessStartInfo is set to runas, which causes the process to already be running as Adminstrator when starting, rather than starting it as the current user, and then letting windows elevate the process.\nThis means that impersonation can not work, because the installer has no way of knowing which the original user was.\n. Do you remember where the issues for those problems are?\nI checked the git logs, but it appears this change was introduced before you moved to git, and you didn't import the subversion history when migrating.\n. Except it's not fully working. You just won't notice it in the most common use cases.\nNetwork drives not working after upgrading (without restarting) is one example, but I don't think saving new settings will work properly either, unless you restart.\n. It looks like that's because of an additional problem - for some reason, PrivilegesRequired[1] is set to none rather than the default value of admin in ShareX-setup.iss[2]. Setting it to admin should make the installer process properly elevate itself (and ask for credentials if required).\n1: http://www.jrsoftware.org/ishelp/index.php?topic=setup_privilegesrequired\n2: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX.Setup/InnoSetup/ShareX-setup.iss#L33\n. Alright, here's all the options I've come up with:\n1. Revert the removal of runas. This would (still) have the problem of leaving the updated ShareX instance running elevated rather than as the user the previous version was launched as when updating.\n2. Keep it as it is now. Problematic since it breaks upgrades for non-admin users (as in #1399).\n3. Make the installer re-launch itself with elevated privileges if it can't write to the destination directory. This still has the same issue as number one though.\n4. Add a small utility that when upgrading starts the installer, waits for it to finish, and then relaunches ShareX.\n5. Switch from Inno Setup to WiX, which seems to have support[1] for dual-purpose install packages, where the user gets to choose whether program gets installed for everyone or just the current user.\nOption five looks like the best solution to me, but it's also the one that takes most work, and you would have to make sure that upgrades from installations made using previous installers to new one works.\nOption four also solves all the issues, but at the cost of some complexity, plus the need for an extra executable.\nOption three adds extra complexity, but still has the same problem as using runas when launching the installer.\n1: See InstallScopeDlg on http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/wixui/dialog_reference/wixui_dialogs.html\n.

It's just a matter of simulating pressing Alt-End from within .net code.. Or if it's too complicated, have the time interval setup in application settings, then just a checkbox in the upload window..

When a new key (up or down) takes over the repeating, it does not go back to repeating the previous key (right or left) when the new key (up or down) is released.  I can look into working around this using a timer of sorts to process movement based on key state rather than key messages.\n. @Jaex Here is an example emulation of the key repeater using timers: https://github.com/davidruhmann/ShareX/commit/9652457f74b52d80898f841419f2ffec30cde095\nThe performance was much better than I expected.  Seems to run at the same amount of CPU usage as the WM_KEYDOWN method from what I watched on the graph.  Let me know what you think.\n. I understand not wanting to make it any more complicated.\n. Ah, nice catch!   The issue was that the IsCreating state needed to be reset for a new selection which is normally performed by the mouse up of the left button, but since the selection was started with insert, this was not happening.  Added the end selection routine to the right button mouse up after the cancel to simulate this action.  Had to wrap the end selection calls to prevent a region from being duplicated if the mouse was hovering over an existing region when cancelled.\n. Is ShareX or explorer running as administrator?  I have seen this occur when explorer and ShareX are running at different permission levels.  One is elevated, the other is not.  If so, this is a limitation of the Windows OS.\n. The main point of the service is to provide immediate build validation.  The compiled version from the ci builds do not have to be used.  That is my thoughts anyway.\n. As long as you are the single gatekeeper that works, but whenever changes come from a pull request, this can provide validation without you having to first manually build it before committing.  Just trying to provide options for extra validation.\n. For example, that green check mark next to my second commit shows that it passed build on travis-ci.  It is the Build Pull Requests option that they provide.\n. You would have to set it up for the actual ShareX/ShareX branch for it to check all pull requests.  That one just got checked since Travis-CI is running on davidruhmann/ShareX.\n. @McoreD  echo=>> APIKeysLocal.cs is only appending a new line to the file which will create the file if it does not exist or just add a new line if it does.   It will not overwrite the file at all.  Not super elegant, but I can update it to have a file check if wanted.\n. Understood, no need to be sorry. :smiley:\nThe PR will be here as a reference if you ever decide you want it.\n. This may be fixable with more advanced screenshot sizing logic bases on a quick glance of the code.  Though it will be several days before I can try anything due to holiday weekend.\n. Expanding upon what ben-summers said about editing the INI\nGreenshotImageEditor.ini %UserProfile%\\Documents\\ShareX\n\n; Suppressed the 'do you want to save' dialog when closing the editor.\nSuppressSaveDialogAtClose=True\n. Do this already (excluding repeating else endless loop) with custom actions for the hotkey workflow\n\n\nAvailable HotKey types\n// Upload\nFileUpload,\nFolderUpload,\nClipboardUpload,\nClipboardUploadWithContentViewer,\nUploadURL,\nDragDropUpload,\nStopUploads,\n// Screen capture\nPrintScreen,\nActiveWindow,\nActiveMonitor,\nRectangleRegion,\nWindowRectangle,\nRectangleAnnotate,\nRectangleLight,\nRectangleTransparent,\nPolygonRegion,\nFreeHandRegion,\nCustomRegion,\nLastRegion,\nCaptureWebpage,\nAutoCapture,\nStartAutoCapture,\n// Screen record\nScreenRecorder,\nScreenRecorderActiveWindow,\nStartScreenRecorder,\nScreenRecorderGIF,\nScreenRecorderGIFActiveWindow,\nStartScreenRecorderGIF,\n// Tools\nColorPicker,\nScreenColorPicker,\nImageEditor,\nImageEffects,\nHashCheck,\nDNSChanger,\nQRCode,\nRuler,\nAutomate,\nIndexFolder,\nFTPClient,\nTweetMessage,\nMonitorTest,\n// Other\nDisableHotkeys,\nOpenScreenshotsFolder\n. In Summary: You want to stitch together multiple screenshots into a single image\nIs this correct?\n. Rather than scrolling an active screen, I think Djfe wants to take several screenshots showing changes in the state of whatever is in context, then attach them all together into a single image.  Like those compilation posts of something funny from a TV show that are often on imgur, but with your computer.\nQuick Example Pulled From Imgur: http://i.imgur.com/rODsLix.jpg\n. Just copy the files\n- ApplicationConfig.json\n- HotkeysConfig.json\n- UploadersConfig.json\n- GreenshotImageEditor.ini\nfrom %UserProfile%\\Documents\\ShareX\n. This is just trying to append (add to existing or create new if none exists) a new line to the APIKeysLocal.cs file.  I can add a file check if wanted.\n. This command is checking if git exists, if so, run the git command, else append a new line to the GitHash.txt file\n. ",

That's what I am saying @Jaex, but telling people to attempt to fully reinstall as a common fix might be worth it. It is obviously related to post-install file corruption, so that would probably do the trick in alot of cases.. I will assume you mean that you want to do the built in screenshot.

Users can configure hotkeys in their DE to invoke ShareX.exe that way.\nShortcut/Taskbar functionality uses win32 APIs. Could be ignored completely.\nSomething is broken with using icons in resource files. Probably mono bug. Further investigation is needed.\nWindows shell commands are used to make sure APIKeysLocal.cs exists. MSBuild could be used to do this in xplat way instead.\nText-To-Speech API not available on linux. Can definitely be ignored for starters.\n\nAnd that is all i had to touch. No idea how ShareX records screen, but ffmpeg could be used for that.\nSo that is that. I do not really plan to push it further, just thought its an interesting exercise to see how much stuff is missing, all because ShareX came up in gitter chat.\nChanges i had to do to make it compile

\n\n\n\n\nA quick and dirty experiment to get ShareX start on linux. Was not that hard. Of course it is half-broken and nowhere near usable. This is what i have found:\n\nWindows API is used for hotkeys. Can be easily solved by adding a command line switch to ShareX.exe which would trigger functionality provided by hotkeys. Users can configure hotkeys in their DE to invoke ShareX.exe that way.\nShortcut/Taskbar functionality uses win32 APIs. Could be ignored completely.\nSomething is broken with using icons in resource files. Probably mono bug. Further investigation is needed.\nWindows shell commands are used to make sure APIKeysLocal.cs exists. MSBuild could be used to do this in xplat way instead.\nText-To-Speech API not available on linux. Can definitely be ignored for starters.\n\nAnd that is all i had to touch. No idea how ShareX records screen, but ffmpeg could be used for that.\nSo that is that. I do not really plan to push it further, just thought its an interesting exercise to see how much stuff is missing, all because ShareX came up in gitter chat.\nChanges i had to do to make it compile on linux using Rider IDE:\n```diff\ndiff --git a/ShareX.HelpersLib/Helpers/ShortcutHelpers.cs b/ShareX.HelpersLib/Helpers/ShortcutHelpers.cs\nindex 7d4377b9..6471c30b 100644\n---

    "MzHub": "I was about to suggest this myself, so I'll at least give my 2 cents.\n@Jaex, while I agree that OCR can get complex, I think you may be thinking of a different use case than what was intended here. OCR of photos and scans is a whole different world, but a much simpler use case - and in my opinion more useful for a tool like ShareX - is copying text from screenshots or other images to the clipboard.\nI used to have an application for exactly that use case years ago, and I still miss it often. It could not read anything complex, but it handled normal fonts better than OCR software meant for photos. I would love to have that in ShareX behind another screenshot hotkey, as I'm already used to how ShareX works. I would rather not get another application for that.\nI disagree that this functionality would be overkill, or out of the scope of ShareX, since there is already text and clipboard handling and uploading. To me it would make sense for ShareX to combine screenshot + text via OCR. As jasondavis said, Tesseract may be one option to look into.\nHowever, I understand if this is not a high priority :)\nEDIT: Another crazy idea solution could be to let the user select an endpoint to upload the image to, and use the resulting text as output (to clipboard?). Something like that. Could be offloaded into an OCR app online.\n. Here is another option, as used by Greenshot:\nhttp://getgreenshot.org/faq/how-can-i-use-greenshot-for-ocr/\n\nFor the Greenshot OCR (Optical Character Recognition) plug-in to work we are depending on a component from Microsoft called MODI (Microsoft Office Document Imaging). If this is installed Greenshot will activate the plugin (if installed) and you will have an OCR destination. If you select this destination the OCR logic from Microsoft will try to detect the text on the screenshot and Greenshot will place this on the clipboard. MODI can be installed as an option from the Microsoft Office 2003 / 2007 installer or as an option from the free Microsoft SharePoint Designer 2007 ( you can find a description and a link to download it under \u201cmethod 2\u2033 here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982760)\n. @Jaex on the OCR endpoint idea, here are some free solutions that some users might be able to use:\n\nMicrosoft's Computer Vision API - https://www.projectoxford.ai/pricing - free quota 5,000/month\nGoogle's Cloud Vision API - https://cloud.google.com/vision/pricing - free quota 1,000/month\nHP's OCR API - https://dev.havenondemand.com/apis/ocrdocument - free quota ?\n.

Are you on the latest version?\n. vgy.me creator here,\nvgy.me runs on Laravel 5.1, and their routes helper uses either http or https, depending on how a client is connected. When Jaex implemented vgy.me into ShareX, it was before SSL was added to the site, so they have used the http protocol. Personally, I see no real problem with this as it's just image data. Unless an image contains someone's bank details, which quite frankly no one is that stupid to screenshot. And normally I would delete those kind of images myself as it's just not worth the risk, even though it's not my responsibility for the consequences of someone's bank details being shared online.\nThe purpose of an image host is to, as it implies, \"host\" an image, so you can link it to profiles or forums. I mean, there's just no point uploading an image to an image host and not sharing it anywhere, right?\n. The real reason why vgy.me isn't on SSL always was because ShareX was using the http version. So sending a POST http request would generate a GET request to the https version.\nI see now that Jaex has updated the code to use https and once that update rolls out, I will make vgy.me always use SSL.\n.

I can't guess a good reason tbh.\nPeople are asking for a way to not use cloudapp on windows, and instead use your service, but you are turning them away, because you don't want to? That seems asinine.. Yet they all support importing bookmarks from each other. Hell, opera even lets you use the same extensions that chrome uses.\nGimp supports opening file formats from Photoshop\nMicrosoft Office, Open Office, and Google docs all support each other.\nCompanies tell you to use their software, which you would be doing/allowing, by letting us upload to cloudapp. But instead, you force them to chose between using sharex on windows, or cloudapp. THAT is a bad business decision, because you are losing potential customers.. And you would be making it easier for people to move from cloudapp, to sharex. I'm really lost as to why you don't see this as a benefit for you, and your users.. So you're going to alienate a group of your customers just because of a url? You don't even have your own URL service, so you are advertising for literally all of your other destinations. If you are really that worried about not getting any advertisement, throw a watermark on it. Let people pay to remove the watermark.

I'll take a look at implementing at some point, hopefully the weekend (unless anyone else wants a go at it).\n. Looking into this. It's actually a little trickier than it seems, we need to have access to the AWS region name to sign requests, right now we just have an arbitrary endpoint: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-authentication-HTTPPOST.html\nSo this will require a UI change.\n. Also worth noting, this will kill DreamObjects support, they do not support this form of authentication in their API: http://docs.dreamobjects.net/s3-api/authentication.html\n. No\n. That might be a question for him :wink: \n. No, as I said in the original issue, DreamObjects does not support the AWS V4 authentication scheme.\n. I think it would be better to poke them to update their authentication schemes, if they\u2019re going for a like for like match of the S3 API, they need to implement the new stuff.\n. It\u2019s entirely up to you \u2013 merge it or don\u2019t.\nBear in mind this futureproofs it, any other regions Amazon releases (and they will release more) will use V4 only, so support will gradually drop off. I\u2019m unsure if they will deprecate the V2 authentication scheme for existing regions though, I haven\u2019t read anything that indicates they will.\n. Have tweeted them, will see what they say: https://twitter.com/AlanEdwardes/status/590113749194924032\nWhen I get home I\u2019ll check to see if it\u2019s possible to drop the AWS SDK back down to auth V2 for arbitrary endpoints. I don\u2019t really want to have the old code hanging around just for DO\u2026 we could make a separate file uploader for DreamObjects though, that would make more sense since the APIs are diverging. Leave it with me, will update the PR.\n. Closing this while I work on it.\n. The SDK does allow dropping down to the old auth scheme. Re-opened, includes DreamObjects support again :dancers: \n. Hi - I am unable to recreate this issue. Could you take a screenshot of your Amazon S3 settings page for us? Feel free to blank out your access key. Thanks!\n. It has, I added more verbose errors for the S3 uploader: https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/pull/682\n. Please post a screenshot of the error when uploading to S3 from the new build, it should provide an HTTP status code which will be useful with debugging this.\n. This means there is problem with your access key or secret key. Please ensure that you are able to upload objects to S3 using these keys and another program, such as S3 Browser: http://s3browser.com/\nPlease also ensure you are not accidentally adding whitespace around your credentials.\n. I would assume this is a default coming from S3 itself or the C# SDK.\nCan you explain your use case? Bear in mind ShareX is not a general purpose S3 uploading tool, it is a screenshot sharing application.\nCheers\nOn 3 Oct 2015 7:51 pm, Jaex notifications@github.com wrote:\n@alanedwardeshttps://github.com/alanedwardes\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/issues/1033#issuecomment-145278254.\n.

I just love ShareX more, especially with its ability to screenshot/record, upload, and copy url to clipboard all with one or two buttons.  I figured since Fraps could do it ShareX should be able to, not realizing it was a very complex issue.\n. That is because on imgur there is no setting specific to image privacy.  All images are viewable if someone has the direct link to it.  https://help.imgur.com/hc/en-us/articles/201746817-Post-Album-and-Image-Privacy\nIf the person that made this issue wants their images to be private as private as imgur allows, they need to go to their profile settings here: https://imgur.com/account/settings and double check that the setting is set to \"Hidden\".  That is the default for new profiles, so it should be set to that if they haven't changed that.\nAnd then, for any albums they create, they can choose to make the album public, hidden, or private.  As I understand it, public means anyone can see the album.  Hidden means anyone that has the url can see the album.  Private means only you can see the album.\nBut again, that is unrelated to image privacy.  Anyone can see any image on imgur if they have the url for it.  And that is not something controllable by ShareX.\nI hope all that made sense.\nEdit:  Dangit, Scrxtchy beat me to it while I was writing that, heh.. I don't think #1236 is related?  I'm not using colour picker, various colour profiles, or an image editor.  I'm just taking a picture of a picture that's in my web browser.  Since I only have the one colour profile and it's the same image, my snapshot should be the same colour as the image I take a snapshot of, no?. But it's the exact same image, on the exact same computer.  All I did was open http://i.imgur.com/uQ23UIT.png in a tab, take a screenshot of it and uploaded it.  That was the 2nd picture.  Then I took a screenshot of that and uploaded it, and the result was the 3rd picture.  Then I took a screenshot of that and uploaded it, and the result was the 4th picture.  Then I did the same for the 5th  And each one is darker than the last for some reason.\nI agree it's weird, but it's the exact same computer, using the exact same monitor, and the exact same browser, for each snapshot of the pictures.. Ah.  Okay!  Thanks so much for putting up with me and getting back to me on this.  Now I'll just have to do some research into that and see how I can stop it from happening.  Much appreciated!\nEdit:  Upon further investigation this seems to be caused by something happening with Firefox and color management, because I was opening the images in Firefox.  Capturing an image over and over again that I open in my image viewer is fine.\nEdit 2:  Ah, okay.  So it was because my image viewer wasn't applying my monitor color profile, but by enabling color management in my image viewer it now causes the problem to occur when I open the image in my image viewer too.  This isn't good, I want the problem to occur in less places, not more places.. ",

    "sirocyl": "Also curious about this. The auto-update functionality is great, but I wouldn't run any program it downloads without an Authenticode signature, and I wouldn't recommend people to do so.\nI just use it to notify me when an update is available, and then grab it from the GitHub releases page.\nSigned programs definitely are important, and have their perks. You can validate the integrity of a downloaded update through code signing, for one.\nPlus, in the ever so slim chance that any part of the update system or code repository gets compromised, there will be multiple layers checking the update and warning the user.\nYour updater, checking the signature, will see an invalid signature and fail before the program is run, saving a computer from potential trouble.\nAnd, if someone manually downloads an update, seeing the \"Do you want to allow a program from an unknown publisher to make changes to your computer?\" window is a big red flag.\nFinally, it doesn't just end with the installer itself; signing the actual program, included DLLs and the ffmpeg download, ensures a path of trust rooted in your own hands. If you saw recently, Notepad++ was the target of a bait-and-switch attack by a state actor, and widely-used open-source applications such as this, make a very large social vulnerability scope.\nThe scope of this issue only concerns the auto-updater and installer. While important, it's not effective to only sign the installer. I will add another issue referencing this, concerning verifying signatures of DLLs before loading them, as Notepad++ currently does.. re @tinybarks I also recommend signing not only the installer and executables, but also any packaged-in DLLs, as per #2615. It really is important that this gets covered, and covered soon.\n@Jaex An open letter, if I may.\nWhile getting a proper code-signature certificate may be a particularly difficult and understandably confusing thing for some people to work with, albeit necessary, compromises can be made in the short term.\nFor instance, if the updater checks the signature of the installer it downloads, against a known-good authoritative cryptographic signature (say, one posted here, on this Github, in the Releases section alongside the installer) it would be far better than the current situation of just, downloading and running the installer it's given automatically.\nHowever, for the long term, it is important that a much more thorough mitigation is implemented, and implemented in a quick time.\nAn Authenticode signature on all executable, library, and distribution installer files, would go a long way to protecting ShareX from a very embarrassing situation. There are people today who still swear off Handbrake or Notepad++, because of a successful malware injection in the past. They don't understand why it's no longer an issue, they just know they heard a bad thing about it in the media. ShareX is, as a project, in imminent danger of this; it's not if, but when.\nShareX is an incredibly popular, and useful, free-software tool. Many of my friends and colleagues use it. I've seen it featured in a lot of Twitch streams, and its community is large enough for a full-on Discord partnership.\nHowever, for all I know, there could be a malware-injected ShareX.MediaLib.dll floating around, that some state or malicious actor is using as an eavesdropping tool, since ShareX is configured to run at startup, by default, on all machines it's installed to; and that it is used in vulnerable, relatively cybersecurity-unskilled, high-risk enterprise and professional settings right now.\nIt is urgent that this is corrected. Please do consider this. I'm not trying to be a hard-ass, and I'm not trying to play town-crier here - you, as a project, are staring down a lit cannon.. Certainly not. The signature checks would be entirely disabled on your own builds, or replaced with your own signature if you chose to do so; such checks only concern the original binary builds.\nYou wouldn't really need code-signing for your own builds, considering Git has rather strong code-integrity from the source.. ",
    "tinybarks": "Please do sign the installer as well as the executables. It's reckless to not do so and causes issues in enterprise environments where only signed applications may be installed or executed. Signing the application binaries can be easily automated, and a company called Certum offers code signing certificates for OSS products for 28 EUR/year (approx. 2.33 EUR/month) which should definitely be affordable by you through the Patreon contributions. \nThere's little excuse not to do this, especially since anyone with contributor-level access to the repo (which could be gained through compromising the account!) can publish a malicious release which could be pushed to tens of thousands of users, potentially even more if the hack is not noticed soon. If you personally sign the binaries instead - and of course add a simple check in the updater that the signature is valid and by the correct CN, the latter to force attackers to get a cert in your name - you make it much harder for attackers to push malicious updates. Even the sophisticated attackers can be warded off with the appropriate measures (that's the goal of the TUF project, I suggest reading their specs and docs. But a simple fix like adding Authenticode signatures to binaries and verifying them, potentially also cross checking the SHA2 hash of the binary with a database of valid hashes found on a non-GitHub server only you have access to - along the vein of TUF's specs, but much simpler - would already be a decent solution that makes it incredibly hard for people to attack ShareX users through malicious updates.\nDo not let ShareX join the ranks of Handbrake, AlZip or MediaGet. It's on you to prevent this from happening. . > re @tinybarks I also recommend signing not only the installer and executables, but also any packaged-in DLLs, as per #2615. It really is important that this gets covered, and covered soon.\nIndeed, that should be done too. Any binary in the package should be signed, and the signatures verified on start if ShareX.exe is compiled as an official ShareX build.. To those of you who are still interested, I have added support for B2 in the following PR, which has been merged: #3637 \nYou can wait until the next official release of ShareX (12.3.0, I think?), or tell ShareX to install a dev build. Alternatively, grab any nightly newer than 12.3.0.3567 from here if you want to try it out now (click a green build, then \"Configuration: Release\", then look for \"Artifacts\" above the console).\nNote that Backblaze B2 partnered up with CloudFlare, which means that data transfer between B2 and CloudFlare is now free. Might be appealing for some of you, especially combined with the free tier's free storage. . #3635 is related to this. . I think adding a configuration option that disables the Enter key might work, or maybe we can detect if an IME is being used in a press-enter-to-pick mode (it seems you can check for this) and disable the enter hotkey in that situation. Thoughts?. It can be used to set the IME mode or to disable IME, but you missed an important note in the docs:\n\nThe user can interactively change the Control.ImeMode unless it has been programmatically set to Disable. In this case, the user will not be able to use the IME. \n\nIt seems to work in testing, but it's not good enough (only detects IME settings if you set it to a default value like Off which is hacky and apparently doesn't work with global input). I'll experiment with this later since I've seen that recommended for determining IME usage with global input enabled.\n. ImmGetConversionStatus() doesn't seem to work for Microsoft Pinyin, unfortunately. ImeMode does seem to give reliable indication of IME status, but only if you change ImeMode to a different value than NoControl first... and that's hacky and bad (see comment above).\nI think what may work is checking whether InputLanguage.CurrentInputLanguage.Culture.TwoLetterISOLanguageName is one of \"zh\", \"ja\" or \"ko\"\n where the Enter keypress is handled. If that condition is met, the user is probably using a keyboard layout with an IME and we should disable commit on Enter so IME input can be used. . The thing I just committed is some code I tested with Google Japanese Input, Microsoft Japanese IME, and Microsoft Pinyin on Windows 10 1803. This should distinguish between Enter pressed in the suggestions mode and Enter pressed in other contexts, so it'll behave as you expect.\nI'm not sure if this works with other IMEs, but it seems like all the ones I tested will, when entering things in suggestions mode, continue to pass key events to the field but replace the KeyDown event and, depending on the IME, the KeyUp event KeyCode with VK_PROCESSKEY. \nFor example, entering \"\u30ad\u30c4\u30cd\" on the Microsoft Japanese IME, then pressing enter looks like:\nkeydown kd: ProcessKey, kc: ProcessKey, kv: 229\nkeyup kd: K, kc: K, kv: 75\nkeydown kd: ProcessKey, kc: ProcessKey, kv: 229\nkeyup kd: I, kc: I, kv: 73\nkeydown kd: ProcessKey, kc: ProcessKey, kv: 229\nkeyup kd: T, kc: T, kv: 84\nkeydown kd: ProcessKey, kc: ProcessKey, kv: 229\nkeydown kd: ProcessKey, kc: ProcessKey, kv: 229\nkeyup kd: S, kc: S, kv: 83\nkeyup kd: U, kc: U, kv: 85\nkeydown kd: ProcessKey, kc: ProcessKey, kv: 229\nkeyup kd: N, kc: N, kv: 78\nkeydown kd: ProcessKey, kc: ProcessKey, kv: 229\nkeyup kd: E, kc: E, kv: 69\nkeydown kd: ProcessKey, kc: ProcessKey, kv: 229\nkeyup kd: Return, kc: Return, kv: 13\nkeydown kd: Return, kc: Return, kv: 13 \nkeyup kd: Return, kc: Return, kv: 13\nTyping anything while in Microsoft Pinyin suggestions just gives you VK_PROCESSKEY messages until suggestion mode is left, so it's similar. \n@Scrxtchy, I tried this code with the emoji input and it didn't work. But the emoji input doesn't seem to work like an IME does. Instead, when you use it with a text box, you get exactly the key presses the user performs, and when the user presses enter, it seems to send three KeyPress events, adds the first character of the surrogate pair to the Text property, sends one more KeyPress event, then adds the second character to Text, then fires a KeyUp event with kc = Return (but no KeyDown event). That seems way more annoying to track.. Does that directory exist? Can you manually create a file in that directory?. I've checked the version of FluentFTP in ShareX and it seems like the issue is related to that. I'll see what I can do about it.. Actually, it is most likely that the FileZilla server allows downgrading to TLS 1.0. \nBeen testing TLS support in ShareX by running OpenSSL s_server with settings that only allow it to support one protocol at a time:\n$ openssl s_server -port +1234 -key cert.key -cert cert.crt -tls1_2\n- or - \n$ openssl s_server -port +1234 -key cert.key -cert cert.crt -tls1_1\n- or - \n$ openssl s_server -port +1234 -key cert.key -cert cert.crt -tls1\n- or - \n$ openssl s_server -port +1234 -key cert.key -cert cert.crt -no_tls1 -no_tls1_1 -no_tls1_2\nand trying to connect to it with the FTP client in ShareX in implicit mode (which tries to establish a secure connection immediately). ShareX will only connect via TLS 1.0. Looking into the code, it would also connect via SSL 3.0, but FluentFTP uses native secure sockets and Windows 10 1607 and up appear to disable support for this.\nI'm submitting a PR momentarily that will enable higher TLS versions and allow you to configure the acceptable range of TLS versions for a FTP account, defaulting to a minimum of TLS 1.2.\n.

Now I'm studying the project so I can understand it.\nJust to confirm that I understand correctly: \n1. In the Task settings/Capture I should add:\n    1.1. A drop down menu to select the monitor;\n    1.2. Two text boxes to select the region.\n2. Add a new task in task list called: \"Capture Custom Region\".\n3. As a default(or when the set monitor is disable or dose not exist any more) the Capture Custom Region Task shall capture the entire Active Monitor.\nI'll create a version trying to respect the style and the current architecture. \nThanks\n. Can you please review what I have done until now and tell me what should be different.\nFurther, If the naming is correct, I want to implement the localization for my changes. \nThanks.\n. Thanks for the review.\nSetting the labels names was my five minutes of stupidity/day.\nThe purpose of the monitor object is to offer the possibility to take the bounds from a selected monitor and to put them in our region bounds, that is the only object that will saved.\nThe monitor name is used to identify the selected object and to override the ToString() method. \nI've chose to create a MonitorRegion object because:\n1. It is easy to take all the monitors and to put them in the combo box.\n2. It is easy to take the bounds from the selected monitor and to put them in the custom region rectangle.\n3. The MonitorName makes some sense for the user, otherwise the user will see only some Rectangle properties. \n4. We create some of the logic out side the form.\nWe can keep the X, Y, Width and Height as different properties or we can keep an Rectangle object\nSo you purpose to eliminate the MonitorRegion object and to work with rectangle?\nIf yes, what do you think we should add in the MonitorBounds ComboBox? I can add the rectangle from each monitor.\nCurrently I'm making an improvement version and I'll create a commit.\n. Can you please review the changes I've make? If you want I can create a version without the MonitorRegion object.\n.

    "samthejarvis": "I'd been struggling with this for a while. Found a solution! Was going to come on here to suggest it be the default setting.\nTry adding -b:v 1M to a custom VP8/Vorbis command.\nExamples:\nhttp://samjarv.is/~/WetWrySun.webm (without -b:v 1M)\nhttp://samjarv.is/~/TwoSadMan.webm (with -b:v 1M)\nOr use the default x264 command and use this transcode command in the \"Run CLI afterwards\":\n-i %input -c:v libvpx -cpu-used -5 -deadline realtime -threads 4 -crf 10 -b:v 1M -c:a libvorbis %output\nI'm not sure if -cpu-used -5 -deadline realtime -threads 4 improves performance for realtime capturing, you can try it though (make sure the -threads is set to the number of physical cores your CPU has).\n. So I just did a single test of VP8/Vorbis without -deadline realtime. I get a lot of this: http://samjarv.is/~/RedSadBat.webm (changing -rtbufsize does nothing). I get the same result by using the default command.\nWith -deadline realtime I get this: http://samjarv.is/~/FarOldCan.webm. Plain sailing. I haven't compared resulting videos from these two commands for dropped frames yet.\nIt would be useful for someone else to try this out too to compare.\nAnd now testing the x264 - VP8 transcode command:\nWithout -deadline realtime, it takes a bizarre 20+ seconds to transcode a 4 second ~720p mp4 to webm using the command above, consistently (tested 3 times). This could be due to something else on my machine because that's a really long time to do something that trivial.\nWith -deadline realtime, it takes <0.5 seconds to transcode, which seems like the normal amount of time it should take to do this.\n.

Then this should also be an option. I prefer the current behavior, so I don't accidentally upload files with confidential information on second screen. (You can easily overlook the scroll-bars in the editor)\n. Offtopic\n@Jaex  What is the exact reason for this? \nNot using existing libraries is an anti-pattern of software development:\nsee Not-invented-here Syndrom (wikipedia) or Anti-Pattern (wikipedia)\n. @0xdeafcafe You're right. But if I remember right, he's against 3rd-party libs in general.\nEven though the library is only some kByte.\n\nAnd + for the modular idea.\n. You don't have to load them all at startup. You could lazy load them at use.\nBut I doubt somebody would use that huge amount of uploaders.\n. I agree with your arguments.\nThe lazy loading thing was for the modular idea from McoreD not for referencing external libs.\n. Have you tried this?\n\n. At bottom it just installs an virtual audio card, which repeats all sounds on your computer. And FFmpeg is going to use this card.\n. @Jaex http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14600987/code-to-open-windows-explorer-or-focus-if-exists-with-file-selected\n. @Jaex but aren't you using Process.Start(\"explorer.exe\")? so it does not work for other filemanager right now anyways. or do i miss something?\n. I tried it with XYplorer and Explorer++ right now, and it didn't work. \nIt just opens the normal windows explorer.\n. Great. I just tested it the other way. The SHOpenFolderAndSelectItems Method from my initial post will open other explorers, if they're registered correctly. \n(I used Explorer++ and a small c# Sample Application with the code from stackoverflow.)\n. Yeah I will do it later that day. \n. I would prefer this:\nif (!folderPath.EndsWith(@\"\\\"))\n    folderPath = folderPath + @\"\\\";\nSo you don't have to manipulate the string if it's already correct.\n. Yeah, I wrote a ListViewColumnSorter, afterwards realizing there is already one. I wanted to ask Jaex if I should change the existing one or add a new one.\nI didn't had enough time anymore, so I paused it, but accidentally pushing it to my repo with the issue no. in the commit message.\nI don't know when I'm able to get back to it. Feel free to take it.\n. @Jaex Yes this was intentional because I wanted the ListViewColumnSorter to be as abstract as possible and not depending on HistoryItem. So it's reusable in other places.\nEdit: IMHO the best solution would be to use an ObjectListView. Then we could reuse the DateTime Object directly.\n. Yeah totally right, that's possible. Did you see my Edit in the previous comment?\n. Nevermind. I was confused. \nIt just took some time to process, but I thought something was bugged.\nSo I tested it with the debugger and current source from git. But the source code doesn't contain the API key.\n. You could try to set your personal folder path to a cloud-based folder (like dropbox, seafile, qsync, gdrive, etc.)\n\n. We may don't talk about the same thing. I am talking about finishing the capture with double-click in effect mode. \nWorkflow:\n- Capture region. (multi-region)\n- Selection some regions.\n- Change to effect (e.g. Pixelate)\n- Selecting some areas for Pixelate effect.\n- Trying to finish the complete capture with double-click.\n- Doesn't work, I have to press enter or change to selection mode and then double-click.\nAnd if we talk about the same thing, it shouldn't be considered as a bug. Because I assume most people use the selection first, applying some effects and then they want to finish the capture.\n. Now I can understand, I have never tried to double-click outside of my selected regions, my though was it doesn't depend on where I double-click. \nBut this behavior could be improved. We could just look for a general double-click (anywhere) and ignore the single click then, couldn't we?\n. What about just undoing the last single click action on double click?\n. Yeah, thanks for the hint. Seems to be fair, because my left hand isn't leaving the keyboard anyways.\n. #1615\nNot recommended, but you can obtain old versions here: Releases\n. You don't have to interact with the menu. You could just setup an hotkey in ShareX and let AHK press this specific hotkey.\n. I just tested it on my machine with the following AHK Script:\nF1::Send ^+h\nI just focused a random window (you may focus your specific window with AHK for the automation) and then pressed F1, which triggers: Ctrl+Shift+H (^+h).\nShareX successfully took the screenshot.\nSettings:\n\n. But the \"Capture window\" function from ShareX does activate the window and then does the screenshot. So does it really matter if ShareX activates it or AHK?\n. I agree with Jaex. \nIts a very specific use case. And as you mentioned you can probably achieve it with custom commands already. Another solution would be, to record it as mp4 and then use custom uploaders to upload it to some mp4-to-gif Converter online.\n. see #1350 \n. see #1615 \n. see #1615 \n. Maybe I am wrong, but this is the same issue, isn't it? #1837 \nPS: That's fixed and available in the next release.\nOr download the latest AppVeyor build from https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ShareX/sharex/build/job/yriq0c2wo9fboori/artifacts\n. Probably this: http://www.textsnip.com/\n. Probably this: http://www.textsnip.com/\n. Yes that's possible.

Because the DefaultOutputDirectory is set on the wrong object instance?\n. No, there are two different instances:\n\ntaskSettings.TaskSettingsReference holds a reference to the Program.Default instance.\nbut taskSettings itself, does get a copy of Program.DefaultTaskSettings\n. Check #1796\nIt's a bug. \n. You can try to set your own configuration path.\n\n. #1778\n. see #1040\n. Maybe an user context problem? Did you install ShareX with an admininistrator account and map the network only in your user account?\nAnd could you maybe post a screenshot of your settings for saving to a network folder? I can't reproduce it with my settings.\n. You can just hide the tray icon with windows builtin functionality. \n. Sorry, I didn't know the behavior of Win10 is different from Win7 with these options. But on Windows 7 it will be hidden inside the extended taskicon section.\n\n. \n. Are you really closing this issue because he did mistype ShareX?\n. First of all he's from china and maybe not that good in writing/reading the latin alphabet.\nAnd you shouldn't refuse to implement things just because someone doesn't read/write the software name correct. There are also people with reading disorder. Are you just going to refuse there ideas or implementations because the have a disease? \n\nNot to mention file field already contains file name so it is pointless to also supply filename second time in arguments.\n\nYou could have written this in your first answer and it would be okay.\n.

Select \"Properties\". Click on the \"Details\" tab.\nAll the fields there are blank, yet all the other libraries have copyrights, versions, names, etc.\nAnd I did check your AssemblyInfo, those details should be there.\n\nInteresting, I just did this and all the details are there. This reinforces the idea that the libraries are being corrupted somehow on your local machine.\nAlso, patronizing @Jaex by saying \"it only took 10 seconds\" is only foolishness and poor foresight on your part. Your library is corrupt, we already know that. If @Jaex were to do what you just did @Jaex wouldn't get the result you did, they'd get the asset details, copyright, etc. like I did because my install didn't get corrupted. Unless @Jaex can replicate the corruption @Jaex would have nowhere to start with debugging it.\nMy best theory would be something to do with the way ShareX loads them into memory, an unclean restart causes the library to get corrupt. But even that doesn't make sense as ShareX uses the same built in methods to load libraries as everything other Visual Studio C# project.\nThere is definitely an issue, whether or not it's a bug (which would be hard to find) or a larger issue with .NET 4.5 & Visual Studio is the question. It's definitely not a \"bad build\".\nYou know what else can cause this sort of corruption? Antivirus software, viruses, unclean shutdown, etc. I'm with @Jaex on this one, 4 users reporting an issue that could very well be their own computer or a fault in Microsoft's frameworks isn't worth wasting time on.\nBut you know what? @Jaex did waste time on it. See here:\n\nI did hours of searching to figure out how library can get corrupt itself and so many software and game made with .NET framework had this issue and have zero info about how that can even happen.\n\nSo @Jaex looked and found that other software made with the .NET framework has these issues, further reinforces the theory of it being the frameworks fault.\nI'm sorry you two, your complaining is just a waste of breath.\nOn a side note..\n@deanperry that type of comment has literally no effect lol. One less person to waste our time with baseless complaints and error reports? Sounds like a win-win to me.\nNow move on and find some other project to troll you two.\n. @MWisBest I couldn't find anything on the corruption either, it would be interesting to see what @Jaex found.\nI was unable to reproduce this problem with the released installer, with the portable release, or by compiling it myself.\nTesting parameters I used were as follows:\n- Clean install of ShareX on fresh install of Windows 10 & Windows 7 VM\n  - Keep in mind each action was performed on a fresh install with a fresh ShareX install (reverted VM to pre-test environment before each test)\n  - Normal restart\n  - Dirty shutdown (power cut)\n  - Restart w/closing ShareX completely beforehand\n  - Killing ShareX from task manager before restarting\nI tried every method of reproduction as reported in this thread plus extras I threw in and was not able to reproduce it. I also tried reproducing it on my Windows 10 tablet and laptop (but w/o a fresh install of Windows) and was unable to.\nAs I was unable to reproduce the issues with the same files claimed to be \"corrupt\", this reinforces my theory of there being software or some other issue on the users' computer causing the issue. Could be any number of things causing the issue.\nAs for you flaunting \"your credentials\", they mean nothing to me. All I see when I look on your profile is a bunch of unknown projects and project forks in languages unrelated to .NET and Visual Studio C# in any major shape or form. Nothing that could give any credit to programming experience in Visual Studio, C#, or the .NET Framework aside from your fork of ShareX which you haven't even committed to yet.\nWhereas @Jaex has been working on ShareX for 7 years and very obviously has significantly more experience with C#, Visual Studio, and .NET than you do.\nThe theory of the bad build is just ridiculous. I do not see how a corrupted file would only get corrupt upon a dirty restart, if it was a bad build the files would be corrupt and unusable from the start, not after a restart.\n@Jaex has handled reasonable bugs in a timely manner, bugs a developer cannot reproduce cannot even be debugged unless he decides to work closely with one of you three to debug it on your computers. But why would he do that? If he tried to figure out what was causing it on your computers he'd practically just be providing you guys IT assistance for issues with your own computer. I don't judge him for deciding not to go that (quite frankly, annoying) route.\n.

If you upload a file to share, you generally don't want the link accessible indefinitely. The expiration doesn't effect the file at all, just the public share link.\nAs for Steam, yeah: http://steamcommunity.com/id/zikeji/\n.

You should have said that in your original post then, instead of letting me waste 15 minutes trying to help you fix it.\nWith that off the table though, this is not normal behavior for the application. By default it stores settings in %userprofile%\\Documents\\ShareX (or wherever your documents folder is mapped to, in my case my OneDrive).\nI do not know why it set your folder to be within the Program Files folder, I would suggest reinstalling and seeing if you get the same behavior.\n. The latest release has over 70K downloads and I would say it's safe to say\nat least a majority of that is installs.\nOne person reporting an issue with it taking the wrong settings directory\nout of tens of thousands indicates its a bug caused by your system's\nconfiguration.\nUnless you can give us instructions on how to replicate it and we can\nreplicate it using those instructions we can't debug anything.\nAs for the quip on the issue tracker not being for technical support,\ndespite the truth behind those words it gets used for that all the time.\n.

It is not like a workflow where you need to remember the shortcut for. The dialog opens up and you see the shortcuts directly, as prefix, suffix, highlighted letter or whatever. Once you have done a few screenshots, you are faster than you can ever be with the mouse.

    "RedMser": "@Jaex @anijatsu I started working on WebP support for ShareX, using Jose M. Pi\u00f1eiro's light-weight WebP wrapper (GPL v3).\nRight now, you can select it as an image format for capturing WebP files that can be saved to file or uploaded to an image host that accepts WebP. The \"JPEG quality\" setting is reused for lossy encoding quality right now. Lossless encoding is supported, but no setting exists for it yet.\n\nMain issue right now is that there are multiple methods for loading and saving image files/streams in ShareX's code base, and each needs different handling for WebP files (so for example, previews don't work and the different tools that allow loading and saving images don't support the format).\nBut it definitely is possible and could be fully integrated into the program with a bit more work! :). @Jaex Thanks for your reply. This might clarify the reasons for changing both properties:\nAfter some testing, I have found out that the bug seems to correlate with only the UseVisualStyleBackColor property being set to true.

Nope, I have tried all combinations after posting: only changing UseVisualStyleBackColor to false will fix the issue. Unless you find anything that breaks with this change, though, would anything speak against it?. This answer talks about the property, when true, making the background color slightly brighter than the regular form's background color (which is basically not visible at all, with most themes).\nBesides that, the source code of TabPage shows that a background image will be drawn only when visual styles are enabled.\nWhile there is very little information on this topic online, this seems to be about everything that changes with visual styles, at least on TabPages.

If I could use a webm, I would-- however, I need a gif:\n1- The sharing clients I want to utilize cooperate with gif formats but more than half of them do not function well with webms.\n1a- A number of people I want to share with can't open webms on their phones, but gifs work just fine.\n2- Frame by framing a webm is much more difficult than a gif.\n3- Pixel perfect resolution and quality on a webm creates a positively ridiculous file size, to the point that opening multiple of such is not feasible given my rig's capabilities.. People using Safari on iOS / Apple software at large is, unfortunately, not the only set of groups I am considering when I say \"sharing clients\". Phones that I have had the ability to test on have had rather haphazard compatibility with the file format.

I found such functionality in 'history' view. Actually I looked up people comment on this functionality and sounded like that there was no way to delete with ShareX.\nAnyway, right after capturing an image. it shows a view on which it displays the image file name. On its contextual menu, there is no such menu item like \"Deletion URL\", although there is one like \"Delete file locally\" and others. (shown below)\n\nSo, it's kind of hard or un-intuitive to guess that there will be deletion functionality in 'history' view.\n. @Jaex Probably your intuition is different from mine. \"Open\" should sounds like opening a file for viewing, editing, and so on. Well.. for \"Open Deletion URL\", it kind makes sense once you see it and think about it, but please think about it freshly. Open an image to delete it? It sounds weird. \nWell, it's about opening a URL, which is for deleting the image on imgur. So, in that,  it makes sense, but isn't \"deleting a image with address, URL\" more intuitive?\n. ",

Thank you so much! I think your logic may be not quite optimal though; e.g. it finds the first size within range rather than the closest one. And I think you meant && rather than || in the comparison.\n\nHow about this instead? Sorry if this doesn't compile; it's actually the first C# I've ever written! I also haven't tested it...\n```\n    private Point SnapPosition(Point posOnClick, Point posCurrent)\n    {\n        Rectangle currentRect = CaptureHelpers.CreateRectangle(posOnClick, posCurrent);\n        Point newPosition = posCurrent;\n    Size closestSize = null;\n    double closestDistance = Double.PositiveInfinity;\n\n    foreach (Size size in surface.Config.SnapSizes)\n    {\n        double thisDistance = Math.Sqrt((currentRect.Width  - size.Width)  * (currentRect.Width  - size.Width) +\n                                        (currentRect.Height - size.Height) * (currentRect.Height - size.Height));\n\n        if (thisDistance < closestDistance && thisDistance < surface.Config.SnapDistance)\n        {\n            closestDistance = thisDistance;\n            closestSize = size;\n        }\n    }\n    if (closestSize == null)\n        return posCurrent;\n\n    if (posCurrent.X > posOnClick.X)\n    {\n        if (posCurrent.Y > posOnClick.Y)\n        {\n            newPosition = new Point(posOnClick.X + closestSize.Width - 1, posOnClick.Y + closestSize.Height - 1);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            newPosition = new Point(posOnClick.X + closestSize.Width - 1, posOnClick.Y - closestSize.Height + 1);\n        }\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        if (posCurrent.Y > posOnClick.Y)\n        {\n            newPosition = new Point(posOnClick.X - closestSize.Width + 1, posOnClick.Y + closestSize.Height - 1);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            newPosition = new Point(posOnClick.X - closestSize.Width + 1, posOnClick.Y - closestSize.Height + 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    Rectangle newRect = CaptureHelpers.CreateRectangle(posOnClick, newPosition);\n\n    if (surface.ScreenRectangle0Based.Contains(newRect))\n    {\n        return newPosition;\n    }\n\n    return posCurrent;\n}\n\n```\n.

You should be able to take a screenshot of a window that you are not currently hovering the mouse over.. > would it be possible to compress gifs directly in shareX?\nYou can use After Capture Tasks - Perform Actions and setup the Task Settings - Actions menu to include the open source compression tool FileOptimizer (http://nikkhokkho.sourceforge.net/static.php?page=FileOptimizer)\n\n... this should reliably save between 5% and 20% from the original file size.\nJaex is right, however.  Despite some serious improvements with this format, the h.265 video recording tools are way (literally 20 years) ahead of .GIF compression.\nIf you need to compress something losslessly, I recommend PNGOptimizer (https://github.com/hadrien-psydk/pngoptimizer), which will convert your GIF into animated PNG format, which has better compression (you'll save ~30%) but isn't broadly supported.\n. > Is there a way to give a customized file name to a capture?\nModify this screen:\n\n. > Simply, I want images to be copied to the clipboard and not uploaded, and gifs to be uploaded and get the URL.\nWait, so the steps here are:\n\nDrag and drop an image onto ShareX\nIf GIF then upload, if other image type, copy to clipboard\n\nIs that accurate?

I've tested a number of editors without issue, and even tested a new one today for Photoscape:\n\n\n\nI will say the custom image viewer idea does make sense, especially for portable users.  There's a solid use case for setting this up: for example, a Photoshop user not wanting to go through the sometimes tedious launch process could really benefit from a custom viewer program.  It would make more sense -- when making screenshots -- to open with something lighter like PhotoDemon or JPEGview.. @lyflyflxf\n\nEvery time I drag & drop a .jpg image from firefox, it was automatically converted to .bmp. I quickly went through all options inside ShareX and found nothing related.\n\nWorkaround: Drag an image from Firefox to a temporary Windows explorer location (e.g. the desktop).  Drag from this location to ShareX.\n. @MRCD1968\n\nI want it to default back to the links for forums etc after capture. I still cannot see how to capture, give a customized file name, and then upload.\n\nCustom file naming is under Task Settings - File naming.  Then just modify the after capture tasks to upload.\nYou can also also edit the popup menu (which I quite like) to give some finer controls if for example you want occasionally capture and NOT upload.  Open Application settings -> General -> Edit quick task menu.. That is a really interesting bug. . > It works on 1 PC\n\nIt doesn't work on 1 other PC\n\nWhat are the differences between the PCs?

It includes MozJpeg.. > Is there any way I can help you guys to solve this issue?\nThis one is hard to reproduce because there are quite a few variables to account for here.  The only thing I can suggest is watch the config files.  Since the settings are fairly transparent in the portable version (they're all saved to the ShareX folder) you should be able to watch them at every stage.  I've tested this extensively with every release by moving the \\ShareX folder to the new install.  \nSo for example, try manually shutting the program down and seeing what files are changed.  Then, open up the Dropbox website interface and see if they have been uploaded.  Things like ApplicationConfig.json.  Then, when you get home, open up the local copy of ShareX and see if they got copied over.\nYou might also try using a different cloud sync program to see if the same issue occurs.. > Is there the possibility for a cut feature after i made a screen recording?\nAs this issue has come up twice now, wanted to point out that there's an open source video editor program OpenShot that's come a long way in the past few years.  I attended a talk with the author who corroborated Jaex's suggestion that video edition is a genuinely complex process, probably only moreso with more new codecs coming out.\nAvidemux is also open and very effective, but has a bit steeper learning curve.. EDIT: My mistake: ShareX already has BBCode options built in, the author above was looking for a shortcut key, which is a separate issue.  Sorry there.\n\nI'm guessing from the time that's passed on this that Jaex isn't too keen on this.  Two possible workarounds: \nPostImage - website\n\nMyImgur - freeware\n\nI did some digging for a Firefox plugin but no luck.. > It would be nice if in the menu that pops up after a screenshot there would be a button to retake the screenshot\nI'm confused: if you mess up the screenshot, why not just take another one and discard the first capture?. This is probably hard for the dev to reproduce because he can't get a OneDrive for business account without actually purchasing it.\n. Seems like this is really more suited to an GIF editor program like PhotoScape or ScreenToGif.  That way you could not just cut the time between frames to speed it up but also delete frames, which would drastically reduce file size.. I know the use case for browser restarts: it's an effective debug operation and can help clear out your RAM by just opening the necessary web pages.  What's the use case for adding this to ShareX?  Why do you need it and what would it solve?  Why are you restarting the program frequently?\nWorkaround: Splat (freeware from SKwire) does a great job of closing and re-opening programs sequentially and I believe you can add hotkeys.. Opus is obviously ideal for audio and it is supported by FFMPEG but it's important to note that ShareX is a screen recording tool first.  If you just need audio recording, you should use something like Audacity.\nAs a result, two questions that might need to be answered here:\n\n\nSpeed?  Does Opus record well in realtime or is AAC a better option with modern processors?  For example, AAC audio has been around for a long time so Intel/AMD have added processor optimizations to make encoding crazy fast.  Because ShareX compresses video live rather than after you finish recording (like Skype), it has to avoid bottlenecks in the encoding process.\n\n\nStandard?  Is Opus normally an audio track in video or does it require special players?  I did some digging and couldn't find anything.\n\n\nHope that helps.. > Opus replace vorbis in the new vp9.\nThanks for the additional data @baudav , but there's still the question of what kind of processor power is required for realtime VP9 and Opus encoding.  I realize that's a hard question to answer, but it's something that might affect Jaex pursuing it.  Otherwise he may easily argue that it's best to use existing, low-compression tools and then come back later with a slower, high compression codec (like what's discussed in #2265 ).. It might be possible to implement via ZXing (a.k.a Zebra Crossing) C# libraries according to the QR Code Reader project: https://qrcodereader.codeplex.com/\nInvariably however someone's going to ask for the reader program to function with a webcam, which might be a lot more complex.\n@Jaex Make sure if you ever do add this to make a warning about clicking on links, which can point to malicious websites or run bad code in insecure associated programs (e.g. PDF/Word macros).. > https://gfycat.com/SereneLividBrownbear\n\nSweet\n\nYeah that's a step above other QR code readers.  Wow.. > add the possibility to use the hotkey \"Ctrl + Shift\" only?\nThat's an interesting request.  I think it's a standard to assume that CTRL and SHIFT are modifier keys, meaning they depend on a 3rd key by definition.  Still, I've seen several Windows protocol guides say that the Windows key is exclusively for operating system actions, which is something almost nobody actually follows.. > The software works fine previously.\nWhat version were you using when it worked?  What version are you using now?  What operating system are you on?\n\nthe software won't replace the image and copy the image to clipboard automatically. Everytime I annote the image,I need to switch to another picture,then switch back. After that ,the original image was replaced by the result of annotation. However,the annotation still not copy to clipboard,I need to do it manually.\n\nCould you walk through a specific list of steps on what you're seeing?  Like if you were explaining this to a friend, what specific steps would they take to reproduce it?\n\nI can't even annotate if I capture a part of the screen. Seems that something's wrong with the setting to exclude/include annotation for only a part of the screen.\n\nCan you open a separate case with system information, steps you took, etc.?. > I don't understand.  There is no specific steps\nI've been following Jaex and a lot of other developers for a while now and the issues that get addressed quickly have clear instructions on how to make the error happen on someone elses' computer.  When you say \"capture a picture\" did you use a key combination or did you launch via the main window?  When you \"annotated\" it, what did you click on?  When you say you had a problem what exactly did you see (screenshot)?  What were you expecting?\nI'm no expert on the topic, this is all based on a variety of good guides on the net around writing good bug reports: https://leantesting.com/write-good-bug-report/. > ... for example by taking a screenshot, using my defined shortcut, then repeating with a new screenshot, I can only interact with the most recently opened Greenshot window. Attempting to interact with any previously opened instances of this window results in a system beep.\nConfirmed on Win7x64, except I don't get a system beep.  Can put together a vid of this process if needed.. Did you try this with the Portable version?  https://getsharex.com/downloads/. I don't think this is meaningful to the bug report but just FYI:\n\nwhat did you mean by protable version?\n\nIf you click on the link I provided, you'll get to a list of releases.  If you click on the latest one, you'll see ShareX-portable.zip  That is a setting that Jaex added early in development allowing any and all settings to be saved to the local folder, useful for cloud and USB drives.. Related: #2091 . Like other false-positive detection problems, I suspect this isn't really something Jaex can fix.  It's probably in TRAPS' court to enable a specific type of installation of what is clearly a popular, widely-trusted program.\nI might be wrong.\nAnyway, why do you need to install it silently?  Have you found a workaround?. Like other false-positive detection problems, I suspect this isn't really something Jaex can fix.

I think this bug got resolved when Jaex stopped using Greenshot's image editor and started using his own full screen tool.. Resolved.  Turns out I was not running the latest version.  I think this bug got resolved when Jaex stopped using Greenshot's image editor and started using his own full screen tool.. The Youtube Uploader feature request has been discussed in #976 ... in the mean time, Google Drive upload is more than adequate for most video uploads and sharing.  For the Twitter part, ShareX already has twitter URL posting built-in.\n. @SirWaddles There are a variety of excellent freeware PDF merger tools available including PDF SAM, PDFTK4ALL, PDF Multitool, and PDF Shaper.. That seems out of scope for ShareX so I suspect Jaex will decline to add that.  You might wish to reach out to a URL shortening program and ask them to add that functionality.. Wait, what's the custom action for zipping a file?  Or rather what's the easiest track for this?  I could probably figure something out with 7zip command-line but I'm curious if there's a quicker way.. > way to much effort to be worth it, was hoping for it to just be an option\nThe problem is that Windows doesn't include a compression tool so Jaex would have to add something.  Usually ZIP files don't actually do much to compress JPEG and PNG files that a screen capture program usually generates.  Can you explain why you need to ZIP before upload?\nI can imagine a few scenarios so I did some digging and I can't find any uploader program that does this.  You might try contacting File & Image Uploader as that program has a ZIP file splitter and it seems easy to add.  There's also zipshare.com, but I don't know if that has an uploader.\nAnyway, if for some reason you decide to dig into the command-line thing, there are a ton of great resources for building something with the excellent and fast 7zip program http://7-zip.org/download.html  ... here's some example tools that would do the trick: https://www.dotnetperls.com/7-zip-examples  The nice thing is that once you get set it up, you never have to mess w/ it again.\n. Good feature request.  I can see some cases where download speed limits would also be useful.  In fairness to Jaex, no other uploader program I've tested including MyImgur and Image Uploader have that feature.  I haven't tested File & Image Uploader, but that does seem to have some speed limits.\nPossible workarounds in the mean time:\n\nA program like Netlimiter (non-free) \nFigure out what port you are sharing data on and have your router set that to low priority.\nUse something like FileZilla to handle uploads. As a workaround, can you configure PureFTPd to run as an SFTP server?  That's generally more secure anyhow.. This is a dotNET application and, according to some quick research, TLS didn't appear in the dotNET application toolset until version 4.6 and I think ShareX is still using 4.0.  \n\n\nStarting with the .NET Framework 4.6, the System.Net.ServicePointManager and System.Net.Security.SslStream classes are allowed to use one of the following three protocols: Tls1.0, Tls1.1, or Tls 1.2. The SSL3.0 protocol and RC4 cipher are not supported. [source]\n\nThat's no mark against Jaex as there are reasons why you'd want your program running older versions of dotNET, including broader operating system support and portability.\nFrom there, it's likely just a case of favoring the newer, more secure libraries over the older, more compatible ones.. >  No description provided. \nCould you provide more detail?. > Lossy source is not ideal for such testing. It's like converting JPEG to PNG.\nExactly right.  Here are some example screens from a GIF file created using some PNG screenshots + APNG Anime Maker and run through PNG Optimizer (size = 36k, full spectrum color):\n\nSame sequence compiled using PhotoScape (size = 56k, lower quality):\n\n. > Those apps you telling handling duplicate frames and doing probably diff checks to only draw changed parts which decreasing file size greatly. \nTrue: there are some great GIF file compression tools that allow for similar areas to be utilized from frame to frame, similar to modern video codecs.

That might be out of scope for a program that seems focused on general productivity.  You might want to look into the excellent Open Broadcast Software, which is open like ShareX but specially designed for webcams and full screen games.. There's functionality inside the program for copying an image:\n\nAre you asking to add additional functionality to the menu so that when an image in the list is selected, you can press a CTRL+C to add the image to the clipboard?\n.

Oh.  That's a good suggestion.  Thumbs up.. > Is not a suggestiom\nIt's very reasonable in the course of adding a whole lot of great features that some may drop off.  The guy is after all writing a whole new edit/addendum tool.  That it doesn't have one minor key combo isn't a big deal.. @bsto As a workaround, you might look into Snipaste, which will also grab submenus and icons but is not open source and lacks all the mature customizations and intelligent features of Sharex.. Should note that someone did get the program running in Mint #2712 via what I'm guessing is Wine or Crossover, but that's still not official support.  With a few exceptions, I haven't seen a lot of effective porting of dotNET programs to Linux or Mac..

Any other ways?\nFirst, is using a different hotkey really that tedious?  If so, can you suggest something?  What would you like to see?  Like hold down shift to stop a process?. I don't get it.  What were the expected results?  Can you use this with products other than Google Chrome Search bar?. Evidently not possible.  See #2594 . Yeah thanks for doing that @altano . Thank you for listing a use case.. Can you provide some screenshots?. I have no idea.  Have you tried something other than webm?  Do other codecs have similar sound issues?\n(Almost) related: #2263 \n. A little background: ShareX was using an integrated editor \"Greenshot,\" which is open source with a compatible license.  Jaex has been working on another editor, which is in progress.  I have little doubt that time will tell as far as innovation and you might find you prefer the new editor once it meets feature parity with the Greenshot editor.  . > Both of your requests added now in dev build: https://jaex.getsharex.com/2017/11/mp6w8i2iWV.mp4\nNice!. > Do ShareX comes with any editor that allows simple gif modification(i.e. removing frames)? If yes, how do I get it?\nLike a video editor, a GIF editor is probably out of scope for ShareX.  Two also programs that are open source like ShareX that can help include OpenShot (http://www.openshotvideo.com/2015/02/february-update-gifs-video-playback.html) and ScreentoGIF (http://www.screentogif.com/). > Do ShareX comes with any editor that allows simple gif modification(i.e. removing frames)?

ShareX is very feature rich versus so many other tools but I'm so far really enjoying the simplicity of the new (as in not embedded Greenshot) image editor.  I guess you can always hand off images to a more intense editor from Paint.NET to Photoshop.. @makdir \n\nYou can get really cheap Windows tablets actually, yes, mostly way cheaper than any other tablets in the same category like Android. For $80 starting.\n\n\n\nProjects this are have notoriously low funding and the program already does a lot of things that available commercial counterparts do not.  Even major projects with 100,000 downloads a month won't come near what an actual developer is getting paid to work on closed source software.\n\n\nIt's unlikely that buying a touch device and adding touch functionality will result in Jaex getting more donations that would make up for his time as a skilled developer and pay for the $80 device you mention.\n\n\nIn the future if you want developers to do something they might not be inclined to do otherwise, you might try to create a way to make it fun or interesting, or some kind of incentive.  Say for example offering to buy Jaex a touch device and donate some money for his time researching, testing, implementing, etc.. > Do you know about this?\nI actually hadn't noticed that.  Thanks.. Nice, thanks for adding.. Use case?. Really?  How often are you exporting hotkeys?  Is this a thing?\nIf you use the portable version you can just copy over the entire ShareX folder.  Or -- strange as it sounds -- the ShareX\\ShareX folder (the profile folder has the same name).. I know I'm turning into a broken record in reply to some of your Feature Requests but what's the use case?  Why random?. Thanks for posting about this.  I'm very interested in this topic.

If picture comparison falls under one of those categories, I guess it's in scope but ... I guess it's a question of whether or not people are going to use it.  I mean, I thought QR codes were pointless a few years ago but they're still going strong.  As a result, it makes sense to have a QR reader in your screencap program (to read and decode QR codes).\nAs to why skip a given feature, this runs into territory I'm not 100% about.  My understanding is that there's such a thing as feature interference, where adding one feature can add unintended complexity to the code, slowing development and making testing more difficult.  Also as ShareX includes some amazing automation functions, meaning there's quite a bit of functionality under the hood.  Maintaining a simplified program operations can make issues with automation sequences easier to diagnose when they break.. > I have been using this app since it was released many years ago and it is 1 of my top used apps.\nPlease feel free to support the program (if you're not already) via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/ShareX\n\nMy dream update would be to convert the tools to a plugin system so that tools can be added/removed as well as the ability to easily add new tools\n\nAs in the Firefox add-on system?  That might be something you want to create a separate issue for.. > I'm adding optional setting for it.\nTo be clear I greatly disliked that feature originally but now I wouldn't want it any other way.  As such I'd suggest keeping the current default.  Still I can see some reasons not to have that function so thanks for making it optional.\n. Is this a dupe of your #3006 issue?. That should happen with the following settings:\n\n. I looked through the various issues posted over time and I'm not sure there's much drive for printing support.  But anyway ...\n\nThe steps as I understand them are: \n\nDo a scrolling capture\nSplit the scrolling capture into separate images that are auto-sized to a given printer width (in your case A4)\nPrint (or save to PDF or whatever)\n\nCorrect?\nI don't know what you mean by \"analog function\"\nPossible workaround: \n\nPaste the scrolling capture image into LibreOffice Draw on multiple pages. \nRotate the page setup to the arrangement you want\nMove the image to different locations on the screen\n\nI had to do a bit of cropping to make this work, but I've had good luck with LibreOffice Draw.\n\nThere may also be a trick with ImageMagick.  That program is amazing. \n. Yeah I've been frustrated by ShareX not functioning like other graphics editors, but a few of the tools have solved issues in a fairly interesting/creative way so I'm curious where the team goes with it next..

What's the use case?  Why do you need to convert images?. > these auto-screenshots get automatically uploaded onto the cloud image hosting and I am not sure how to delete them\nI think you can right-click on the images, right-click, and select deletion URL.  You'll then have to visit each of these URLs, which admittedly might take some time.\n\n\nWould it be possible to have a different set of post-capture action for these automatic tasks than regular uploads?\n\nI think it's possible to set that up via the hotkey creation and then check \"override after capture settings\"\n\n\nprovide a button to quickly stop such a capture?\n\nI think with the hotkey setup mentioned above, you can just press the hotkey again and it will stop.  That was how I managed it the last time I tested this.\n. > I think it would be a good idea if these settings are integrated to the menu for the default auto capture task\nCan you suggest how you picture that getting implemented?. > My vote for mentioning supported platforms in the GitHub repository description at the very top. \nThis comes up a lot so you're certainly not alone, but my understanding is doing so would be especially difficult.  The team has said no to this enough times that it seems unlikely they'll chance course.  But hey that's the beauty of open source: maybe you or a group of people could hire someone to assist or to do some kind of feature bounty to encourage development outside Windows.\n< shrug >. I am a big proponent of the APNG format, I just wanted to clarify a few things on this specific report:\n\nThe author is right that uploading a .APNG file throws an error.  If you upload a .PNG file that happens to be animated it will get uploaded (see screenshot below): \n\n\n( You can view the example file in the screenshot above at: https://i.imgur.com/u8C672Q.png )\n\nIf you try to manually upload .APNG Imgur at least doesn't know what to do with that (getting stuck on the screen below):\n\n\n\nAlso, the last time I checked a few months back, Twitter (or maybe it the Twitter official client?) does not support animated PNG files sent to their servers so that might not be worth enabling for ShareX users seeking that feature.\n\nI think this situation will improve with time but it's just one of those moments where it's taking some time for a format to catch on.  I do think the APNG format will eventually succeed as GIF continues to under-deliver on quality and size.. Update here: \n Imgur now will accept files that end in .APNG (it appears to just change it back to .PNG, which makes sense to avoid browser MIME type confusion).\n ShareX still throws an error when you drag-and-drop an APNG file into the window, but doing what Jaex shows in this post above https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/issues/3084#issuecomment-359195555 or just renaming the file from .APNG -> .PNG still works fine.\nYou should still use standard GIF if sending info to Microsoft IE and Edge users.  Those appear to be the last holdouts on the format.  Just about everyone else supports this better-than-animated-GIF alternative (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APNG).. > Capture specific window command line\nI haven't tested this function specifically but MiniCap (not open source) has this functionality via the $windowtitle$ argument.  https://www.donationcoder.com/software/mouser/popular-apps/minicap#commandline-options. > Capture specific window command line\nI haven't tested this function specifically but MiniCap (not open source) has this functionality via the $windowtitle$ argument.  https://www.donationcoder.com/software/mouser/popular-apps/minicap#commandline-options. I agree based on conventions set for other Windows programs, but I think (based on some other threads) that Jaex is going for a different kind of image editor.. @erenseymen Generally speaking someone who puts in a feature request for auto-crop asks for it because they've done it a lot.  As such you might want to be aware that the excellent ImageMagick (also free and open source) has some remarkably good batch auto-cropping tools: www.imagemagick.org  ... I've used it with some success cropping images ShareX generates with autocapture.  It's near-instant.. @erenseymen Generally speaking someone who puts in a feature request for auto-crop asks for it because they've done it a lot.

I've used it with some success cropping images ShareX generates with autocapture.  It's near-instant.. I'm fairly sure based on previous issues that this is out of scope.  #2994 and #1331. I agree with Jaex that it's probably out of scope.  Recommend ScreenToGif here on Github: https://github.com/NickeManarin/ScreenToGif/. > you can already edit normal pics\nEditing single graphics and editing a series of them is a bit of a leap.  For example, there's edits to multiple frames but not all of them, frame management, cropping, rate of the GIF, color levels, etc. that really takes a lot of additional thought.  Still, Jaex has added a lot of functionality that I thought was out of scope for a screencapture program so maybe he'll figure something out in the future.. Now that's a bug report.. > ShareX is not a good tool for capturing long videos, due to the risk of corruption and other non user friendly issues\nI haven't tested this recently, but Jaex has stated this in the past #3319 and recommended the excellent OBS tool.  I have and will continue to use it to record (for example) meetings with better overall quality than Skype and other recorders.  It's excellent.\nThe (freemium) software XSplit has functionality for auto-splitting video:\nhttps://www.xsplit.com/gamecaster/faq/advanced/how-can-i-automatically-split-my-saved-stream-or-recording. >How can I get sp1\nIt's free: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15090/windows-7-install-service-pack-1-sp1. It's possible to sign up on Patreon to support ShareX and then immediately disable it.  The service should (based on a recent test) automatically send a payment for that month.  After which, you can turn off support.  It's all just a PayPal front-end.. I think this thread was mostly about supporting the image encoding format, which I haven't researched.  Invariably someone's going to talk about the video compression part (as @Scrxtchy is alluding to), which looks excellent so ...\n\nAnother option that should work today is to add an action that is performed on capture. This can allow the use of ffmpeg to a similar application to convert an already captured file into your desired format for uploading\n\nYou'd want to use a high-quality, low compression method.  I'd probably start with x264 set to \"ultra fast\" and the highest quality AAC audio.  It takes a lot more disk space to record, but would turn out much better in the end.  Compressing a video that's already been compressed at roughly the same bitrate is just going to look ugly.\nRelated #2265 . Have you tried running multiple instances of ShareX?. I know lots of image hosting services would appreciate more people deleting images they know aren't useful after given time frame.\nMaybe \"[X] Add expiration date\" checkbox with a note \"(ShareX must be running)\".. As Jaex might consider this functionality out of scope, you might consider another image hosting site for large numbers of images other than Imgur.  Google for example boasts unlimited image storage and probably wouldn't hesitate to take over 50 images.. WHY ADD THIS FUNCTIONALITY?\nThe reason to use GPG signatures rather than just SHA256 hashes is that only the developer can generate them, whereas someone who has access to the Github site could just replace hashes present with the corrupted version. If that sounds absurd, a little research can demonstrate a few cases of open source programs getting bad code inserted into them by malware developers.  \nIS THERE A PROBLEM?\nNo.  Jaex is a competent developer but Github is not unhackable and ShareX would make a desirable target due to it's popularity.\nI don't know how important this is or how many users would actually verify their downloads against GPG signatures.\nHOW TO CREATE/VERIFY GPG SIGNATURES\nGithub-specific documentation is here: https://help.github.com/categories/authenticating-to-github/ (scroll down to the signatures section)\nGPG signatures can be easily generated using GPG4Win and verified with the same program. Engimail is an excellent, cross-platform option:\nhttps://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/user-manual/signature-and-encryption\nWORKAROUNDS\nThere is no such thing as perfect security, but a few workarounds if GPG sounds tedious or not worthwhile:\n\nUsers - wait two weeks after program release before installation.  Most issues with software will detected in this time frame and posted to sites like VirusTotal.\nUsers - Run the program inside one of a long list of Windows sandbox tools.\nDevelopers  Store hash files on a separate server that only they control.. Little confused here.  So currently when you right-click on the ShareX tray icon, it doesn't open properly and you want a hotkey to open said tray?.

I'm expecting at least one .gif file to appear there but nothing comes as a result.\nI admit, my original description of this bug isn't accurate enough, sorry about that. Anyway, expecting a .gif to be produced but that's not happening. ffmpeg doesn't give any errors. \n. No, not yet, just debugged what's happening under the hood. And no, didn't try to download an update because when ffmpeg is installed (I remember downloading it from sharex long time ago), it's no longer offering that option anywhere, I did check all menus several times. Of course, it must be under some option but I couldn't locate it immediately.\nUpdate: I did rename old ffmpeg.exe to something else and sharex did offer an option to download it when tried to do screen recording. After update, capture was a success. So this is resolved. Thank you very much. This ticket can be closed.\n. No, not yet, just debugged what's happening under the hood.

Thank you for the suggestion, but there are many problems. Firstly, I am all Windows, and I wouldn't trust a Windows build found on the internet, nor do I feel like installing Linux for a cert. Secondly, depending on their method of proving that I own the domain, I may not be able to do that. For example, startcom makes you choose from a list of emails that point at the domain - but I don't own any of them because I use dynamic dns to map my ip to a human friendly name. Thirdly, I don't really need any trust or publicity - I use this site for myself and some friends and the only spec I really care about is SSL's end to end encryption. And finally, even if I did get a public cert just to get ShareX working, I love ShareX and would continue to assert that this should be handled somehow, even if it is extremely low priority.\n.

It's completely C# and I worked on it extensively for a number of months; although it was originally made by somebody else it was quite a mess to deobfuscate and update and took many builds to do so. With those hundreds of builds, I sometimes ran into issues that made absolutely no sense, sometimes as dumb as crashing on launch in inexplicable ways. Eventually I learned the first thing to try when that happens was a clean build. If you compare the 10.3 ShareX build with the 10.2 one, you'll see the app.config file has exactly the same timestamp, yet other builds such as 10.1 have timestamps that match the rest of the build. Had a clean build been done for 10.3 this timestamp should match. Doing an incremental build with Visual Studio for a release is just asking for trouble.\nThat being said, one thing I have discovered now with further testing of this problem is that it appears the ShareX installer doesn't uninstall or at least clean-up old installations. While I cannot directly correlate the two for certain, I have not been able to reproduce this problem after doing a completely clean installation of ShareX.\nI don't see us agreeing on what could be causing this problem, so let's find something else to agree on: this is a very weird issue regardless of its cause?\n.

It'd cost you a few cents to test on a region close to where you live.\nIf you're looking to implement your own implementation of the S3 uploader, please support both S3 v2 and v4 signature types on uploads to custom origins. v2 is easier to implement than v4 if I recall correctly (I think especially for multi-chunk uploads), and some S3-compatible APIs only support v2 signatures (like pithos).\nS3 v2 signatures are documented here, and S3 v4 signatures are documented here. You'll definitely have to implement v4 signatures, as newer AWS S3 regions don't support v2 signed requests.. @neurogas: That means that ShareX is using virtual hosts to upload, which should be supported by most S3 implementations anyways (and would probably work with the implementation you're using if you enabled wildcard DNS for *.storage.ennetech.me). Would it be difficult to add a checkbox to disable virtual host uploads, @Jaex?. Paths... I know at least for v2 it's supported, I don't have any experience with v4 at all.

Fair enough, I just figured it would be nice if it worked - regardless of whos fault it is that the expiration is set to an hour.\nFrom what I can tell, they list api@imgur.com as the point of contact.\n. Since this is yet again an issue I'd like to share my thoughts and take-aways here:\n- Writing code without dealing with exceptions is weird, no matter why the exception occurs. Your users are experiencing issues, not Imgurs.\n- The error message explicitly calls for using the refresh token once. If it has been revoked the refresh token will not work and ShareX should not retry using the refresh token.\n- The user wants to upload an image, not save bandwidth (then why try to upload an image in the first place?).\n- Obtaining a new access token and retrying is - on most connections - faster than having the user:\n  1. Manually open up the Imgur settings dialog\n  2. Logging in to Imgur in a browser\n  3. Copy-pasting the PIN into ShareX\n  4. Manually finding the screenshot in a dialog somewhere in ShareX (a program that I normally never have to navigate)\n  5. Finding the right upload option in a context menu\n. ",
    "jeremejevs": "As a non-brute-force solution, couldn't ShareX just try refreshing the token upon receiving a 403? I can see this being useful even if the API is returning a correct expires_in, e.g. when client's computer clock isn't very accurate or the service provider decides to revoke all active sessions for some reason. This could also be a setting in Settings > Upload > Retry (or on per-destination basis).\n. That's nice to hear, but still, shouldn't a 403 error be a trigger for a one-time token refresh attempt?\n. Yeah, I understand that this particular issue is resolved, but I'm just saying that it [probably?] wouldn't hurt anybody, if ShareX would attempt to re-login when getting a 403, because that's exactly what this HTTP code is for.\n. It could be per-destination then. For example, in this case, Imgur explicitly says in data.error that The access token provided is invalid..\n. But then your users wouldn't experience any discomfort either. But yeah, I'm here to suggest :)\nIt's not really a workaround though, it's just the software acting on what it's told by the server (i.e. that the token is invalid).\n. Went through the full authorization process a couple of times (as in clearing the token and getting a new PIN), the issue is still here. Please, just implement automatic token refresh on 403, as an opt-in setting or something. Most users (including myself) likely don't care whether this is Imgur's or ShareX's fault, they just want this tool to not interfere with their workflow, and there's a both logical and straightforward-to-implement solution right there. I don't see how 403 + data.error: The access token provided is invalid. can be interpreted as something other than a call for a token refresh.\n.

That's looks like a bug in our api. Status should never be null, I'll check it out.\n.

The editor should never exceed the monitor it opens on, so I guess this requires a manual check for monitor bounds.\nhttps://a.desu.sh/mrowrz.webm\nAn option would also be to maximize the window when either height or width exceed the monitor.\n. I just found out that this is possible already with the \"show after capture window\" task.\n. Uhm, I'm talking about Region Capture. Not sure if it has another name.\n. That's a bummer. Overlaying content (for example text) with a rectangle of the same color as the background is a common patter for censoring and will be impossible in region capture.\nCouldn't you make the pipette re-use the already open region capture?.

I see, then shouldn't everything be separated by a layer where each hosts can describe their capabilities and the user can specify which hosts they want per extension/format rather than something abstract within the user interface?\n. ShareX is 5000% times more powerful than the Puush client ever was, (or any screen capture software on the market for that matter) so don't complain because you can't make sense of it. It is a screen capture software on steroids but I agree that some things could be better organized or named.\n. Would it be possible to keep an idle ffmpeg process running which only starts recording when you want to use screen recording? Also is there any way I can actually test to see if that is indeed the issue and not something else\n. Sorry, I forgot to reply. The right click menu on the ShareX tray icon, I'd find it useful if there was a menu item that linked to the file of the last capture and I could drag the menu item itself, and it'd act as if I was dragging the file itself which I could drop into Discord/Skype/Etc.\nI know you can press \"Copy\" in the After Capture window and paste it into Skype or Discord for the same effect, but some times I only realize after that I wanted to share the file itself instead of a link.

Well, you could call it \"Hash Check and Verify\" Both words have slightly different meanings, but both also apply here. We're checking the hashes of files but also verifying them with a given hash.\n. The original tool is also a verification tool, because you can set a target for what the hash should be. \n. My bad, I meant to say check instead of verifying. I didn't notice that until now.\n. Well the other option is to spin off those conversions into another tool, but that would seem like an unnecessary addition to the tools list.\nAnd even if the tool were to be renamed, it feels like whatever it would be called would be too long and make the tools menu look awkward.\nI'd say for now it's probably best to leave it as \"hash check\".\n. That would work great. If you're still a bit unsure about having both in the same tool, you could include a string option in the first tab so you can check both stings and files in the same tab, and then you could make the conversions tool into a multi-conversion tool.\nSo like say I have a base64 encoded string and want to see what it shows in hex, binary, text, etc. The same goes for any of the other conversions, so if I paste into 1 textbox, it'll give me the result into the others.\n.

The controls are still fairly small and it isn't ideal. To me it looks like a regular app which isn't optimized.\nMaybe offer a UI scale slider in app settings to increase the size of things?. @dasjestyr That wasn't 4K. It was 3:2 2K . The size of the UI components is wayyy too small in general in my opinion. Hence, the UI Scale slider suggestion.. @dasjestyr  Actually, with the way the .NET 4.7 HiDPI changes work, there shouldn't be too many issues (if any at all) by increasing the size of the controls.. An effort could be made to port some of the libraries to .NET Standard so that theoretically some of the code could work across platforms.\nThe biggest issue though is that the GUI framework associated with .NET Framework is Windows only. ShareX's GUI is from .NET Framework's Windows Forms.\nAlthough Microsoft may be looking into a cross-platform .NET GUI some day according to rumors.. > ShareX.UploadersLib cannot be migrated to .NET Standard because it contains Windows Forms code\nIn any cases where there is Windows Forms code in a library, it could be moved to the main ShareX application.. > ShareX.UploadersLib cannot be migrated to .NET Standard because it contains Windows Forms code\nIn any cases where there is Windows Forms code in a library, it could be moved to the main ShareX application..

It's the Windows Desktop App packaged through the Windows Store.\nSo I'm not sure why it would behave differently.. > I wouldn't like filling https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/releases with countless beta releases. Because then normal users wouldn't be able to find stable builds.\nGitHub, Brave Software, and others manage to do this just fine with their projects. A good example of the kind of thing I was suggesting is Atom's way of doing Betas.. > You know this right? https://getsharex.com/docs/dev-builds\nI wouldn't consider that a proper solution as it's very obscure/hidden and the reality is very few people probably actually use that whereas more prominent Beta releases would likely be used by more people.\nEdit: And besides, Dev builds serve an entirely different purpose to Betas. Beta builds effectively are testing releases before they are made Stable.. > All those stuffs you counting probably have their own download servers and not using GitHub releases for beta.\nActually no. Brave Software's Brave Beta releases and GitHub's Atom Beta releases use GitHub releases for their Beta and Stable versions and also for their dev versions in the case of Brave.. > https://brave-download.global.ssl.fastly.net/multi-channel/releases/dev/0.22.669/winx64/BraveSetup-x64.exe\nhttps://atom-installer.github.com/v1.26.1/AtomSetup-x64.exe\nBoth not using releases for actual download. And probably not for updates too.\nYou're completely missing my point:\nBoth offer Beta downloads through releases and both have dedicated download pages for people who download off of their website. And both have working beta channel auto-updates.\n\n\n. @Jaex  Oh? And why are they initially marked as Betas? \nIf they need to be initially marked as betas then you could just label Betas releases as X.Y.Z Beta (title) for example. And just a short warning in the release notes that it's not a stable release.. @Jaex  Maybe you could tweak the update mechanism so that if a URL contains the word \"Beta\" it recognizes it and then you could try it with the first ShareX Beta..

Direct sun light in my eyes is too much!\nI need strong contrasts and balanced lightening to have a good sight.\n. Hi,\nI found a page about drawing attributes.\nI had no time to read it completely, but there is a reference at \nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms837933.aspx about setting the \ncolor of the menu item check mark!\nHappy rest of weekend!\nMartin Lemburg\nBerlin / Germany\nmartin.lemburg@gmx.net\nhttp://about.me/Martin0815\n------- Original message -------\n\nFrom: Jaex notifications@github.com\nTo: ShareX@noreply.github.com\nCc: martin.lemburg@gmx.net\nSent: 8.4.'16,  19:38\nYou can't compile with VS2013 because new C# features require VS2015.\n\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n. \n",

",
    "pierv": "Thanks Jaex for quick reply. Your comment suggested me additional inquiry.\nI finally could solve my problem, was long to find out but I will explain here how so that can help others. Yeahhh !\nI created another admin windows acount for understanding the problems, called \"testacount\".\nI had, I think, three root causes for the problem:\n1) My windows acount folder has an accented name: \"Propri\u00e9taire\". That is probably why by default shareX got confused and installed the user folder under the program file. Installing under my \"testacount\" confirmed that behaviour as shareX found easily the \"testacount\\Documents\" folder under which to add the \"shareX\" settings folder. Probably this accented name (unluckilly created by my computer vendor) is the cause of various software installation issues I had in the past.\nI believe it would be wise for me to change this folder name soon. I found the instructions but so far I do not need it for the purpose of installing shareX given that I solved that issue by selecting a new settings folder in \"Application settings\"/\"paths\". By the way, it would be wise in a future version of shareX, to propose to the user, during installation process, to manually select the \"settings\" folder, as an option. This would avoid users (say 1% ?) to get into that problem.\nThe instruction for renaming an account folder: http://superuser.com/questions/570601/rename-profile-folder-on-windows-7-8\n2) My .Net framework 4.5 installation had a problem. That is why I got this \"System.Data.dll\" error. Installing in my new \"testacount\" did not solve that problem. So I had to uninstall NET framework 4.5. Then I reinstalled shareX, which warned about the needed Net Framework 4.0 and invited to automatically install it, which I did. After that shareX installed properly in my \"testacount\" and worked perfectly:\n\n\n3) Then I uninstalled shareX and reinstalled from my \"Propri\u00e9taire\" account as this is the regular account I am using. There shareX failed to start with the following error: \"CLR 80004005\"\n\nNot sure what is the root cause but I believe my account user folder name may be the problem. Anyway, I \"magically\" solved that problem by running a tool called \"Microsoft .NET Framework Repair Tool\":\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30135\n\nFinally all working perfectly... at least I hope for a while, as I will have to upgrade my NET FW from 4.0 to 4.5 soon... let's see...\nThank you again to the developers. Beside the useful tool I learned something new today !\nRegards\nPier\n. ",

But I can't find any documentation or settings on \"Auto-Capture\" anywhere on shareX through the wiki. I just wanted to know there was any settings to modify how often auto-capture works and what triggers it uses\n. I wanted to look into this as well, does this mean you can't have both an image URL uploader and a email uploader at the same time? Something like this would be nice to have setup: http://i.imgur.com/3vWeQZQ.png . Like I want to default everything to imgur links, but may or may not use email attachments as well. Maybe greenshot print settings? Print2email? http://www.blackice.com/Print2Email.htm. Okay with ShareX history support, the only problem is that its in a .sxb format which I am not familiar with.  If I could geta .txt or .csv format that would be nice. \nBasically, all these files\n\nhow would I go about doing this?. \n.sxb is shareX backup format you had set on there. I cannot find where the export XML is anywhere though. Okay I figured it out now, I specified a generic endpoint last time which caused error. I created a new bucket, this time I picked a specific endpoint like \"Ohio\" as both my shareX setting and my location of bucket too\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lxKKLS7.png. The only way I can see it is a shareX chrome plugin that integrates with the sharex application. \nThe javascript plugin would basically look at the active windows using http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29720294/active-window-detection \nand then output that information to a json file (or even as a local cookie?), to which shareX pulls the latest information off there when it detects the PN (program name) and then outputs the URL if its chrome.\nThere must be some chrome API's you could work with though\nSame goes for firefox, internet explorer, etc\nThat's all I can think of\nSorry I am not an expert here >_>\n.

Will ShareX be released on Linux or Mac operating systems?\nShareX is written using C# programming language and .NET Framework.

There is a way to make software written using .NET Framework to work in Linux and Mac using Mono but it is not possible for ShareX to run using Mono because of hundreds of native calls, UI, external libraries and countless unsupported methods.\nRecently Microsoft released .NET Core which supports writing multi platform software but it is currently extremely limited and doesn\u2019t have UI or graphic related libraries.

RDP Sucks at rendering motion graphics. There is no way around this. This isn't something ShareX can fix up, RDP just sucks at this stuff.\nBasically you're out of luck!\nWe are moving to a Citrix environment soon, so I expect some improvement.\n@L1Q Unfortunately this has nothing to do with machine hardware, only protocol limitations.. ShareX's methods of drawing the region selector is more visually engaging, so not really.. @Thehail Do the settings save if you close and reopen ShareX?. @Jaex requesting close. @hAirypAulsAck What use case do you have for something like this?\nAs HTTP is on it's way out, following what @matthewburnett said, I see no reason to do this..

To confirm, have you tried disabling Avast outright?\n\nAlso, can you supply the error message?. Either do above or update ShareX. ShareX doesn't spam the updates though.

Regardless of the length, I agree a confirmation dialog is probably a smart idea.\nPR Inbound. Keen to hear other people's thoughts on a confirmation for stopping\nI'm against it on the basis stopping is usually an intentional and non destructive action, whereas abortion is destructive.. Paging @marcin-jedynski @mosrod (People from original issue)\nWhilst I agree it can slow people down, I still believe there is no harm in having that feature present. Perhaps if the default value was set to not ask for confirmation.\nHowever, there has to be use cases where having this feature still makes it worthwhile. I can think of one which applies to me. In an enterprise environment (which I run), we instruct our student trainers to use ShareX to screen record demos and other learning material. It isn't happened yet, but I know this feature would prevent those technologically impaired trainers from loosing recordings.. @Torubloo This PR was made for that issue, if you didn't catch that\n. So close.\nYou see where it says Audio Source\nClick on that dropdown, select your source, done.. @tumGER It's actually a feature of Google Drive.\nYep... If I can read, you're running an old .NET version.\nTry giving this a shot:\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56116. Minus anti aliasing and gradient, what's the difference?. Sorry?\nCan you please explain your issue with steps on how to reproduce it.. no way. Here is what happened to me which I believe is sufficient intended behavior.\nUpon my first upload with no credentials specified, ShareX failed the upload and prompted me to login. Once I successfully logged in, any further attempts to take a screenshot successfully went ahead and were uploaded to TinyPic.\nIs this what you are referring to? . What type of functionality do you see plugins giving to ShareX?. I'm going to be totally honest, every single point you listed either exists within ShareX already or should be baked into the product as is - I'm not convinced. . What \"custom effects\" or \"custom after x tasks\" deserve to be plugins and not baked into ShareX? Real examples might help your case.. ShareX is made for screen capture, not for network monitoring. I also think\nsome of the \"tools\" already available are totally bloat and should not\nexist, but hey that's just my opinion.\n\n. I don't think they should belong at all in any capacity.\n\nPlugins should somehow enhance the capabilities of the core functionality\nof ShareX - screen capture - not assist with changing DNS settings or\nmonitoring networks.\nOn Sun, 21 Oct 2018 at 22:01, Lewis Crichton notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nSo why not move all the tools into plugins?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/issues/3681#issuecomment-431661252, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABc61Qreynw_lJYu2ZBv48jdqfqcVvCyks5unFsigaJpZM4XyDME\n.\n. No response from OP and mentioned as problem outside application, could probably be closed @Jaex . @Kjaerside Do you run an anti-virus application?. Working on this.. Whilst I can't answer your question, maybe take a look at the way AppVeyor does it?\n\nAlso, I suspect you will run into issues when ShareX releases updates. Maybe look into a different method of doing this.. \nJust select the right one before you record?. \nJust select the right one before you record?. @Confuseh I've attempted to replicate the issue and have been unable to do so. Are you able to hop on the ShareX Discord so we can investigate further?. I've been locate the issue down to the version of ImageListView being used. Because of a bug in the latest version making my \"after\" code unworkable, I needed to upgrade the library. Using version 13.1.2 shows more promising results with a very simple code change:\n\nBefore:\nC#\nImageListViewItem[] ilvItems = GetHistoryItems().Select(hi => new ImageListViewItem(hi.Filepath) { Tag = hi }).ToArray();\nAfter:\nC#\nImageListViewItem[] ilvItems = GetHistoryItems().Select(hi => new ImageListViewItem(hi.Filepath, hi.Filename) { Tag = hi }).ToArray();\nI'm satisfied with this result. @fluid-decanter is this what you are after?\n@Jaex I'm a bit puzzled by you saying you removed the file check, because in the current version deployed of ImageListView the file is checked if it exists upon loading it into the list view item within ImageListViewItem itself - this is how the file name is determined.. I don't think deleting files from history is good, but what about an option to hide them?. In my mind the premise of a history is that it cannot or should not be modified. It's a history.\nI also disagree with maintaining two lists as this complicates things.\nThe best solution I still believe is a simple filter which I alluded too before.\nI'll implement a PoC tonight.\nEdit: In @Jaex's hands.. I don't know if your commit fully cover's OPs request - which focused on the UI display elements of missing files.\n@fluid-decanter what do you think?. At the risk of overengineering, what if we were to load the template into ShareX itself and add like a \"report a bug\" button which sends you to GitHub and autofills some information.

I can't replicate this for the target textbox but can for result. Referenced fix above.. Should be fine now.. This issue is caused by Imgur's image API service not functioning correctly. Unfortunately this is not a ShareX problem and we have no control over resolving this issue. Please be patient and wait for this issue to be resolved by Imgur themselves.\n. > And there are no obvious clues\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Ag1o3koTLWM. My recommendation is to start with temporary files, clean them up. \n. \n. ShareX is not a good tool for capturing long videos, due to the risk of corruption and other non user friendly issues. Shouldn't it erase to transparent?. This is exactly how it should happen. Flux will cause ShareX to red tint images, and then by showing the tinted image Flux tints it some more, rinse and repeat.. I've moved from Flux to Windows 10 Night Light for that very reason.. @AGSPhoenix I guess this is because you're on Windows 7.\n@mailinglists35 @Jaex Can be closed as invalid I think.. @swashbucklinman Do you run any antivirus software?\nBut that does sound quite random.. a) The news source file is 1.9\u00a0KB.

Did I demand that especially YOU have to implement it? This is an open-source project, anybody could implement it, not only YOU. You are the project maintainer, at the end you handle the pull request.\nWhy not users decide what feature is useful and what not. But blocking the discussion from the beginning, because YOU do not want to implement is no proper way to go with the community. What would have cost it to you to just leave it open so people would find it easier, instead of closing it immediately. I find your way of discussion rude not that you don't want to implement it. Are you that arrogant to decide everything for the community what is good are not? Sorry for the hard words, but this really grinds my gears.\n. Yeah it is a very special case, this is why I wanted to discuss it. It is your valid opinion to think that it will not be useful, no problem with that you express it. But think how people feel that make a suggestion just to get the door instantly slapped before their faces. I expected to have an productive and open discussion with people at least the developers. Maybe not today but over time. Yeah the discussion is not blocked entirely, but default github filter is for open issues, so most people will not notice it.\nThe information you mentioned about possible performance issues is that kind of discussion I was looking for as I did not consider it.\nEnglish is also not my first language as it is for you but it's no excuse to avoid dealing with discussion by closing the issue prematurely.\nBut never mind, if you think this feature is bullshit and people don't need than I leave it be with his message. You are the developer and know way better what people want. I'm just someone trying to make helpful suggestions.\n. ",

I see. Interesting that something did got different. I'll wait for the fix to be released in coming versions.\n. One note: I now tried running the Greenshot_for_PortableApps_1.2.9.97-RC1.paf.exe program directly (that is the editor used in ShareX) and on the same PC there wasn't this issue with that, it appears only in ShareX.\n. Got the problem! The file I was trying to upload was named with Hebrew letters. Files named in English only are uploaded all okay.\nStill strange, given that uploading to Dropbox in the web-interface doesn't have any problem taking files named in Hebrew.\n\nYou are right that it is still 3 months, but it is obvious that when that time will come people will regret having uploaded now things via the Public folder which links won't work.. I understand.\nAnyhow thanks again for this useful tool!. Anything Hebrew, tried several files. One example Test \u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05d5\u05df.pdf. Thanks for your work! Hope they'll manage to find the problem.. For me, it does not show in front of any window I tried it with (Chrome, Windows Explorer, Virtualbox and more.). Why do you think my ShareX runs as admin? From what I see (see Task Manager below) it does not. I also tried it now with run as admin and it was the same.\n. But as you can see in my Task Manager screenshot I'm clearly not running it as admin.\nThe only way for me that it does pop up in front of all windows is if the ShareX window is open (as a window in the Task Bar and not merely in the Notification Area) and it is minimized to the Task Bar. And in that situation it comes in front even if run as admin.. In Application Settings>Advanced change the value for AutoCheckUpdate from True to False\n\n. In Application Settings>Advanced change the value for AutoCheckUpdate from True to False\n\n. I already experienced more than once (possibly after updates) that it reverts back to opening the folder where the screenshots are saved without me changing any settings.\nI changed it now again to open Main Window.\nAny suggestion?. I was able to reproduce the issue. It happens any time ShareX is exited (and I guess the same thing when the PC is restarted.)\nSee screen recording how it happens in action:\nhttps://streamable.com/q3yur. This sounds right! I found lines like:\nSystem.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path 'C:\\Program Files\\ShareX\\ApplicationConfig.json.temp' is denied.\nI have moved the \"ShareX personal folder\" to \"C:\\Program Files\\ShareX\\\"\nNow I gave Full Control permissions for my user to that folder and issue seems to be solved.

But what about just adding the \"Show quick task menu\" - from there selecting the further workflows would be possible and it'd be just a single setting in the dropdown.\n. @vatterspun\nGet your point and I'm very familiar with a popular mockup tool (balsamiq), so I totally know what a (visual) difference it is between telling and showcasing an idea ;)\nSo when I find the time I'll consider making a mockup.. Thanks for response!\nSo you're saying in portable version \"ShareX\" as personal folder path is working and the is no need to prepend '\\ ?\nThat would be great!\nOk, just tested before replying and yes it is working with just \"ShareX\". Hadn't know that and didn't expected this since most other programs on earth expect either a full path or a relative one with \".\\foldername\" \ud83d\udc4d \nAnyway would be great when you could fix the open button of the \"ShareX personal folder\" since it open's the main window instead of the folder. Also when the folders are set \"ShareX\" / \"Screenshots\" to show the full location too as I suggested with the image would be great.\nHope you like the idea :)\nCheers,\nMichael\n.

Also when the folders are set \"ShareX\" / \"Screenshots\" to show the full location too as I suggested with the image.\nIt already shows full path in preview, I don't understand your suggestion.\nYou're right, it's my bad - but under \"Screenshots\" folder the preview does not show the full path, just \"Screenshots\" or whatever name you use.\nBut I found few bugs in preview and open buttons, gonna fix them now.\nSo instead of continuing with a long discussion here, I'll let you fix things and test again then, when you've released a new version ;)\nJust one more thing: When I leave the field for the personal folder empty, it shows \"C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\ShareX\" which is wrong. It should be \"C:\\mysoftware\\ShareX\\ShareX\", at least when using the portable version I think.\nSo, take your time and let me know when you want me to test something, further feedback or anything else to get things fixed.\n.

I can update it to use Json .NET and can take a look at the resx changes - should have only added an icon.\n. @Jaex Thanks for the direction. I've replaced the use of DataContractJsonSerializer and in its place used JsonConvert. I've also updated the constructor to only pull out the API key when the config object is passed to it. Taking a look now at why the resx file is showing so many differences. \n. @Jaex Agreed on bool and the duplicate class. With the duplicate class I was trying to maintain separation of public versus private objects but do see how it is unnecessary and isn't adding value. I've removed it. I've updated CreateUploader to set the public API key property based on the config value - I had misunderstood your suggestion previously. As far as setting the property name on the JSON attributes in the Response objects it was really just to be explicit and consistent as I needed them on the Request objects. This is because the Uplea API balks at \"Username\" and \"Password\" (which is what serialization without those attributes would produce. If we submit \"Username\" and \"Password\" the API response indicates that it doesn't see that a username/password was supplied. Their system is apparently case sensitive. \n. @Jaex I've committed an update to UploadersConfigForm.resx to resolve the wild number of differences previously presenting in the diff for that file. Turns out that this was due to VS adding in duplicates to the file and shuffling everything around. I had to de-dupe the new resx, sort it (and the baseline), then pick out the differences and append them to the original (unsorted) baseline version. \n. @Jaex I've committed the changes and also hopefully addressed the resx diff issue; VS wasn't even seeing that diff. Thanks for your patience. \n. @Jaex Initially I was following the workflow implied by the get-my-api-key action, but realized the same thing that you just mentioned - which is that users could simply provide the API key in place of the username/password. I like the project and would like to have an opportunity to contribute further so consequently had planned to submit some further enhancements to that Uplea tab, including a logout option. Currently a user would need to fail logging in to blank out the API key - which I agree is not ideal.\n. @Jaex Initially I was following the workflow implied by the get-my-api-key action, but realized the same thing that you just mentioned - which is that users could simply provide the API key in place of the username/password.

Fair enough - will take that approach and add a link to the page with their API key.\n. The link would be there if we wanted them to only use an API key to connect w/o a username or password.

Had followed convention on Line 139 of Mega.cs.\n. Will add missing names.\n. Yes, unfortunately SendRequestJSON didn't work for this. This API is very picky. I couldn't get it to respond successfully when using application/json as the Content-Type. GetUpleaResponse and consequently SendRequestURLEncoded is only being used for the non-Upload requests to Uplea, which even according to their API documentation is different than the Upload request. I admit the language on their API page suggests JSON encoding. \n. Thanks for pointing that out @Jaex. That was actually the original 10 entries for the control left in by VS after the rename in designer. The new entries for lblUpleaEmailAddress were added to the same file, but I hadn't expected that it would not remove the references (or update) those for the old control name. I've just removed all references to label4 (the old control name) in the resx and checked it in. I even did a solution wide search just now to be doubly sure and the only references to label4 are in MovableShowColorForm.Designer.cs but that should be unrelated. \n. @Jaex Figured this button label would be more representative of the action being performed rather than the previous label. \n.

    "Bitz": "Can we please bring it back? It was an unnecessary change and doesn't solve an issue- as there wasn't one. \nBecause of this change, we can no longer set custom points as you could with the old polygon tool. Also -the capture custom region task no longer works. \nHolding shift with the freehand tool to create points does not work well. You need to start dragging before holding shift or it does an empty action and doesn't actually start drawing anything. \nWe also no longer have control of points on the new tool. \n. The settings are as follows:\nBound to Ctrl+4\n\n\n\n\nPressing Ctrl+4 does nothing. I assume this was a method you created to invoke the new freehand capture tool. \n(Forgive me if I initially came off as condescending- it just seemed like a few things broke due to these changes) \nAlso, will we be getting point to point control on the new polygon replacement? I kind of miss having the ability to precisely fix the points before finishing the capture. \n. Yes, sorry about that- the custom region works fine. I assumed that it was a replacement for the poly tool for some reason. \n. Also- a bit sad to see point to point support go. :( Oh well, thanks for the help Jae!\n. What he is trying to say is that when you first try to load the region capture tool via hotkey, the load time is immense. (around 5 seconds for me) and once this is done once (after I assume some kind of caching is done) it loads fine with the normal action delay. \nThis issue seems to be only occurring in the latest version, as another system where I am running an older version intentionally (old polygon tool was better), there is no issue. \nPresumably, it is related to the new toolbar- as it was the main feature that was added in this release. \n...and that it is shown immediately after the long delay. .

I suspect it's ShareX \u2192 BMP in temp folder \u2192 Greenshot \u2192 temp folder (although I can't find it).

I made the mistake of using the Windows Store version that auto-updates and now I'm forced back onto the crappy ShareX editor (I had already changed the General option back to Greenshot). Why are you doing this, devs? Your editor is worse. Why are you removing the option.\nI have to try to find the 12.0.0 installer now and use that forever, I guess, and uninstall the Windows Store version.. Downloading 12.0.0, disabling AutoCheckUpdate and UseShareXForAnnotation also worked for me. I guess I'm stuck with that version forever. I put the setup executable on my Dropbox, since I presume they're going to delete it, trying to force everyone to the new editor for some reason.. I haven't looked back through the source for when they removed the option. Would it be pretty simple to just fork ShareX and keep taking updates from sharex/master and keep the option to open Greenshot?\nIf 12.0.0 ever stops working, I'll look into that myself.. Found where it was removed, for future use: b2e46f6. I'd be fine if they didn't bundle Greenshot but instead let you use it the same way it used to work if you had it installed. The actions menu @Torubloo proposes is obviously inferior to anyone who's attempted to use it, so saying it \"multiple times\" doesn't make it any more useful of a tip.\nAs it is, I'll be staying on 12.0.0 forever, I suppose.. @sylveon True. It could be loaded as a DLL dropped in and loaded with reflection or something, but that's dirty. I'd prefer it just be re-integrated as an option.. ",

If I had a chance of ensuring that 100% of the web would use HTTPS only, with proper configurations and certificates, and so on, - please believe me, I would take that chance!\nThe concept of ResultForceHTTPS is perfectly okay to me, but it wouldn't take much to actually try the URL, if you receive\nhttp://example.net/img/test.png\nthen just make a simple GET request to:\nhttps://example.net/\nIf it works without any HTTPS errors, etc., and there is a proper HTTP response from the server via HTTPS, switch it to HTTPS, otherwise don't.\nIf you really want to take go the \"progressive\" way, to use your word, you could the warn the user with a an alert box, every time HTTPS isn't possible, mentioning that they should consult their upload provider, and request them to add HTTPS to their servers, and mention that if their provider adds HTTPS, the alert box would automatically go away. That way would help the situation much more. Example.net's support desk would receive queries from their users, and if the amount of queries are taking up a decent amount of their time, they will most likely add it, in order to reduce the time they need to spend on their support desk.\nPeople usually hate warnings, errors and alerts, and that one would be much more \"progressive\".\nI can't decide whether ShareX should just be \"cool\", or if the day where it would become \"super cool\" is near. I'm just trying to help it to become \"super cool\", that's all.. @sylveon Bigger upload times? As the stuff is already uploaded, when the application would check if the HTTPS version of the URL works, it obviously won't be doing any changes to the upload time itself.\nIt will add a tiny bit of latency, which is quite often around 0.2 - 0.5 seconds for most destinations with the HTTP check depending on the server, though cross-continent requests may be a little bit larger though, plus of course the kind of latency ShareX itself would be adding on top of that...\nDoing a simple HTTP call to \"https://i.imgur.com/\", which is contained in several of the references above, seem to be a latency of 0.157s in Ukraine (maximum in Europe), and 0.362s in Vietnam according to https://check-host.net - from my end, the total processing time is 0.159s, with some old 2001 hardware....

I find this issue odd, the only time I'd ever see black screen is if DRM protected content caught onto a screenshot happening. At least snipping tool does the same thing, that helps sum it up. ShareX isn't the direct issue then. I am unsure what would actually cause such a thing besides what I said earlier.. #1615 . Well I can tell you one thing is that %20 is url escape and it's mandatory that it's done like that. The API is unknown and the JS code behind it is obfuscated. Not possible at the moment because there is no traditional API to do it with. (Not to mention ShareX would then need to encrypt client side, which is also unknown how FireFox Send does it). Interesting, I thought there was more complication into it, but that hard coded X-File-Metadata isn't very secure, as that's the encryption.

On an unrelated topic, do you have a timeline of when you send updates to the Store? Can't wait to have this fix on the Store version \ud83d\ude01. Does this change available in the master branch? Because the test I've performed about the nodes was on the source I've built.. Looking at the code, these nodes should work since there's an InputManager.Update() in the Update() function right before checking if mouse is on top of those nodes. However, it doesn't. (I tried to make the rectangle bigger, still doesn't work most of the times)\nIt seems that IsMousePressed(MouseButtons.Left) is not consistently working for touch events. I'll try to investigate further on that.. The previous comment (the part about IsMousePressed not working) was not true. I've confirmed that it works properly with touch.\nThe problem is, 24px is still too low for touch screen on my high-dpi (12\", 2160x1440) tablet. I've tested various numbers, and 120px was smallest first size that was comfortable to resize on my tablet.\nHowever, this size can't be fixed, as DPI of different devices and monitors differ. So I'm thinking 3x larger nodes for touch screens, but also relative to it's scaling. (So actually '3' times 'scaling factor', which in my tablet results in 3 * 1.75 * 24px). I don't think so.\nThe default InputManager.Update() (that was present even before my fix) is happening before the resize node check happens. (on this line)\nAlso, as I said increasing the size to 120px made it work comfortably on my tablet without any code changes.. ",

    "Sashraan": "There is, but in the scenario I would like to use ShareX in, I do not have access to the user's side of things.\nThe whole point is to have a remote screenshot tool that works when Remote Desktop fails.. so going into advanced options isn't an option, heheh.\nUnless there is a way to activate said option from within the command line arguments? I didn't find much about those besides the short https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/wiki/Command-line-arguments page.. Through a command line opened on the client system. Underlying problem being that our Helpdesk tools aren't the most reliable, so remote viewing of a client's screen is sometimes impossible. \nThe idea is that if we can get a quick screenshot of the client computer without the pc-illiterate clients needing to do anything, we can see the error message and figure out where to go from there, rather than spend time troubleshooting the remote-connection tools and then seeing the error and troubleshooting the true issue at hand.. Are there ressources somewhere for me to dive into and understand how to do that?\nI feel like asking for the way to do it is cheap, I'd much rather learn how to do it through exploring a thread/collection/book of how to change config files through cmd.. The reason for this is to be able to take a screenshot of a client's screen without the possibility to use remote-connection tools to see the client's screen.\nRDP, AnyDesk, TeamViewer, NetOP, pcAnywhere are all tools we have to use where I work and unfortunately there are some times where even with five different ways to connect to a machine, none will work or display the client's screen appropriately. In these cases, taking a screenshot of an SQL error box makes it much faster to troubleshoot and could speed up the process rather than taking extra steps to troubleshoot the remote connection and then take a screenshot.\nIn other cases, clients aren't available to us, so asking a client to accept a remote control session (AnyDesk) in order to take a screenshot of the error is impossible even if it's just within reach through other remote methods..

Unfortunately this issue does seem to be caused by Shadowplay. If the \"Instant replay\" option is turned on ShareX probably picks up the recording overlay which takes the entire screen so there is nothing to snap to except the entire screen.\nHowever there does seem to be a solution for the issue. Simply opening Shadowplay settings (default keybind is Alt+Z), then heading to the \"Privacy control\" option and selecting the \"No\" option will prevent Shadowplay from recording the desktop and thereby release it's lock.\n\n\nIn most cases, however, this is not necessary because by default that option is set to \"No\". I just happened to have it on because I did some screencasts which involved recording the desktop.\nNotice: In order to be able to change any preferences in Shadowplay Instant replay needs to be disabled manually first, then reenabled after preferences are changed. \n\nI know this isn't strictly ShareX related but I hope it helps people that use ShareX on Shadowplay enabled systems..

Well, those controls already have spinner controls, so UpArrow And\nDownArrows will work.\n\nBut spinner controls are not provided at many other places where we have\nnumerical values.\nAt those places, we have to click and enter a specific value, and see the\neffect.\nBut in most places there is no theory that recommends a specific value-- It\nis mostly trial and error.\nSo it would be good to have a spinner control at all those places.\nFor example, in Tools > Image effects... menu, load an image and\nthen use Add>\nFilters>blur.\nThe amount of blur is a matter of individual choice, and we have to\nincrease/decrease it till we are happy.\nThis can best be done by rapidly using spinner controls.\nOf course, we can enter some values to roughly determine the range within\nwhich we want to adjust the final value.\nAt that time, we can click and enter values.\nRegards\nNarayan\nOn Wed, Oct 18, 2017 at 4:00 PM, Eric notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nWhich controls did you have in mind?

I think the goal here for most requests around DisableUpload is that we would like to use ShareX in a corporate environment, and this seems to be a real barrier for administrators.. I have a custom fork where I've modified the DisableUpload property to always return true; (https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/blob/master/ShareX/ApplicationConfig.cs#L218).  I think we would want the registry setting (or some other means of configuration) to never allow that boolean to be false.. @Jaex I believe ShareX could have a lot more adoption in businesses if there was a administrator-controlled way to enforce screenshots do not get uploaded anywhere.  The default behavior of public uploads with a confirmation screen on the first upload does not work in a corporate environment and probably scares away a lot of administrators.\nWould you be willing to accept a PR that changes this behavior?.

Well, in my case it seems to repro quite stably. \n\nstart recording window after snapping to it's region\nstop recording\nGOTO 1. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nWell, at least you know this bug exists... It's a start. . @stuntguy3000 Win10x64, AMD CPU, AMD Radeon 6870HD... Dunno what one can call special soft, but the window I was capturing - Bluestacks 3.\n\n@Jaex the thing is if I encounter this behavior - I would cancel screen capture and I would try to take a normal region screenshot - and it would always snap to the window. However if I cancel the screenshot and try to initiate a capture - it still would snap to the entire screen. So the scenario with a transparent frame/invisible fullscreen seems to be highly unlikely. If I go with screenshot task till the end - it would likely \"cure\" the screen capture snapping. In about 5 times witnessing this bug/not a bug 4 times a screenshot would help and 1 time it would not.. @stuntguy3000 yes. I've just captured a couple of seconds of a Thunderbird window. Then tried it again and it snapped to the entire screen. BlueStacks is not even running (not even a service in the background).. OBS records black screen files and it doesn't seem to find any codecs on m system. I also tried ApoweREC which seems to produce the above mentioned transparent frame, since even normal screenshot snaps to the whole screen (when I exit it it works fine). Windows recording says my hardware is not suitable for recording (MS is always right). I did try to use another soft in the past... The reason why I use ShareX for screen rec is because it is one of the few utils that does work on my rig and with less hussle and problems along the way... I'll try something else later.. >Sounds like this is an issue ShareX cannot solve. Good luck.\n\nrequest close, invalid.\n\nMe being unable to record a repro video with another util is not the issue much less an issue ShareX should be fixing. That doesn't mean the OP issue shouldn't be fixed. Please do not invent reasons to ignore the issue. If you want to pretend it doesn't exist - just do it.. Doesn't really make it invalid.... What would a video prove? That I am not a liar? It would've shown exactly the same thing I have described 2 times already in a text form (with steps to repro). Having seen this theoretical video wouldn't make it repro on your machine...\nBut oh well, it's actually not a fatal bug. Close it if you want.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-FixXXGB7Q. ",

Empty Windows Forms applications takes 13 MB private bytes. I guess ShareX may get something in beetwin (13 + 47) / 2 = 30.\n.\nE.g. I see that some libs fomr c:\\Program Files\\ShareX\\ are lazy loaded and some not:\n\nSome could be made lazy.\nE.g. Remoting, Uploaders, can be lazy, and related classes inside application. \n\n\n. JSON in tray - 5 MB. Tooltips - 2 MB. May lazy JSON or use other JSON lib. Can may tooltips less heavy and lazy. \n\n. So my estimates are possible - you may reach 30 MB in tray. Could leave issues open for couple days for people to vote so:). I guess users of git are rich and pay a buck for their tooling - hardware. But most people do not. E.g. I have 5+ people I setup laptops who has 4 GB of RAM with HDD drives. They do care when their laptop becomes slow after tray background applications they eat all memory.. Also you may bought 8 GB 2 in 1. DDR is energy hungry, so 50 MB commit means - yet another energy leak. Widows memory hungry. Users buy Android or Mac. .NET Desktop dies.. Last but not least, there are 2 types of program - main and background. Main may eat all my memory - drawing pictures or do spreadsheets.. Background - clipboard and screenshot, music player, hardware monitor. \nShareX for most users is background, sometimes becoming main. This is ideal case for lazy plugin load. Only first usage will pay time. E.g. no 200ms but 100ms for actions. Next uses will pay almost none, e.g. 100ms instead of 99ms with not lazy. \nArithmetic, 50MB * 80 = 4 GB. So max 80 processes making my laptop smart. 30MB * 133 =4 GB. So 133 processes make my system smart. Or more additional space for my main photo editing app.\n. There are cool PCs with 4GB of ram. Why do you say they will not use ShareX? Do you know distributions of users and for what purposes use ShareX?\nSnipping tool does not video or gif. Paint is awful for editing screenshot images.  \nChromium as you mentioned is usually foreground application and does not starts after login. ShareX, until called first time in the day, is background applications which must start after login.\nDoing manual changes are not sustainable, because they suggest to make ShareX parts lazy (first calls of each feature is slightly slower, but next are same, not use never get loaded).\nEcosystemically, background tools should use small amount of energy and memory, memory eats energy. Background tool to per good part of default installation chosen by as many as possible should use few resources, until invoked.  Lazy architecture allows to better understand whole application and evolve it more easily.\nI checked another tool, Greenshot is 1.5X smaller, but no video support. \nAnother approach would be not to change ShareX, but write proxy shim with tray menus and hotkeys which routes calls to real ShareX, and kills it when not used for long time, but not sure how far and stable it can get.\n.

Or go throw some suggestions towards the Chromium team. There's a software that could really use a reduction in RAM usage.\nPlus this software is open source anyways, you're more than welcome to make those proposed changes and create your own custom build with 20mb less ram usage and distribute that to the lower spec'd laptops.\nAnd lastly, I can't image there is a lot of overlap between users who need all of Sharex's features and users on systems with 4gigs of ram.

Yesterday an update 12.1 arrived and removed this functionality and the only editor left is the ShareX.\nWhy if the editor is for some people completely unusable, unlogical and just terrible?\n2621\n2436 (comment)\nAt this particular moment I am thinking about no longer using ShareX as I am finding this product going in wrong direction. > OK? Go on then? ShareX wasn't made for photo editing, if you want something like that then I highly recommend Gimp or Photoshop. Making silly statements like \"I'm thinking about not using ShareX\" then don't? If you don't like it, feel free to uninstall. No-one here is stopping you at all.\n??\nReally? You really don't understand, that there are people which selected ShareX over other products (even purchased) because they can \"like something\" which just works great?\nI did purchase SnagIt some time ago and I have moved myself to ShareX because it is just quicker on slower machines (and we do have such machines in our office). And I really don't understand, why when everything was \"great\", dev decided to change default editor from GreenShot to ShareX editor. There was still an option to use GreenShot, but now this option has been removed. So basically - some functionality which is one of the biggest advantages of the program, has been removed and replaced by ShareX editor which just does not work very well on multiple monitors enviroment. And you are saying that I should teach the whole account department to use Gimp or purchase Photoshop for hundreds of dollars where we are talking about users which say \"Computer\" when they see monitor on their desk?\nGreat point of view man, great point of view. I have asked, why this functionality has been removed as myself (and I do already have e-mails from other departments that \"something bad happened to ShareX, please revert it back like it was before\") and some other people don't like the ShareX editor, and you are telling me that they should move to Photoshop. \nI am speechless. Don't know what else I can say to you.\nOne point of view - yours.\nAnd to answer in advance, I am not saying that GreenShot should be a default editor because we don't like ShareX editor, I am asking why the option of choosing the editor has been removed.\nAs person above me said - the ShareX editor is confusing for people which were already working on GreenShot for several years. \nYou don't even know how hard it is to even explain to 60+ year old person that she will now have to learn new system. It is not so easy to train them and explain that \"this way will be better\". They don't like changed at all. Even if you will move their desktop shortcuts to a different place on the desktop, they will declare war against IT department.\nAt this particular moment I am looking for the older installer, I will have to reinstall the software and disable the updates.. And this is for what I am asking for.\nWhy in 12.0 there was a chance to select an editor, where in 12.1 we are forced to use ShareX editor ?. \"I switched back to 12.0.0 and disabled the automatic update\"\nExactly what I have done as well. Sadly it looks like I have brought up the topic that ShareX with Greenshot was perfect (and as you, I did recommend it to colleagues, friends, coworkers) and now even if I am trying to explain to Dev that forcing users to use ShareX editor is not a good idea, I am being the one to criticise. . Based on this topic I do have a feeling that devs don't care about users and their initial reported issue which is \"why have you disabled a choice option between Greenshot and ShareX image editor\" where users prefer Greenshot. Nope. Devs here just constantly ask a question on \"what is the issue\" so they could still force everyone to use their editor as their editor is still filled with things which users don't like.\nAs mentioned, for people which are new to ShareX maybe your editor is \"ok\" but as me, my colleagues, friends and plenty of people in this topic has said, if Greenshot was perfect as editor with using ShareX as just capturing soft then your idea to force them to use ShareX editor is just bad.\nLooking at your approach (in my humble opinion) I see some similarity to Winamp, ePuls or Gadu Gadu where users loved the product until someone \"smart\" decided that \"let's change this this and this\" without listening to the customers feedback. And again I will point out, that the only massive change you are doing is not leaving users the choice where they could easily try ShareX editor, but still disable it in settings to use the Greenshot. .

Perhaps in some time it will get there, in which case this change is fine for me personally.. ",

It should be set as an optional setting to use the new editor.\nThe old one had the \"Copy paste\" with CTRL + C and CTRL + V for example, the new version doesn't.\nAnd many more small details.\nBring back the old editor and make your users happy. :). @sylveon A few points:\n\nThere's no way to switch back to the \"mouse\" feature to select any element no matter the type.\nYou can't modify previously placed elements without selecting that specific element type again.\n\nYou can't copy paste using CTRL + C and CTRL + V\n\n\nThe \"Drawing cursor\" is confusing, because in Greenshot it was used to select any element and modify it. In this new editor it actually draws a cursor (which is unnecessary).\n\n\nThis new version uses a lot of CPU, Greenshot was lightweight.\n\n\nWhen you want to copy a screenshot it immediately closes the editor window. While with Greenshot after clicking the Copy button, it stays open for further actions that you want to take such as saving or editing.. I think the simple solution for all of this is to simply have an option in which you can choose to whether use the Greenshot editor or use the inbuilt editor. And I get the point of ShareX developers for wanting people to use their inbuilt editor.\n\n\nSo simply use the inbuilt editor by default but optional so the user can change it back to Greenshot.. @sylveon Why break something that already works.

The latest build is completely useless to me..  \ud83d\udc4e \nImage editor gripes to hopefully make it better..\n- Full-screen editor is horrible.. windowed mode is no better.. the environment feels like a clone of windows image viewer with random toolbar slapped on it and very bulky and difficult to use when you have multi-monitor setups (I have 2-3 on my workstations)\n- Drawing: (any type)  is too much effort to figure out how to change color/thickness of each element it was very quick and easy before. (literally the only tools in greenshot I even used)\n- The magnifier tool thing that follows the cursor should be quick and easy to disable..  (personally I would never use it enabled and it's just in the way of what I'm trying to do honestly)\nWhat I liked and used ShareX for was quick screen shot's of portions of the screen quick line/box/arrow around the section to refer to for reference change color and line thickness and send to someone/chat the image editor makes this process much longer and annoying.. Though the Quickstep numbering is neat. sadly not enough for me to like Image editor\nHopefully you bring back greenshot or make image editor better or ill have to search again for a alternative to sharex :( . Thanks, I saw the magnifier already after posting..\nKnowing those setting are under that button for border size nice information.. \nBut like I said.. I just dont like anything about the interface or user experience of the Image editor. It always causes issues and annoyances when working with multi-monitor and as others mentioned it takes too much vs greenshot..\nIm sorry my opinion is unchanged.. - Toolbar bounces around independent of the \"editor\" window when moving it around, resizing.\n- When dragging the window around in windowed mode it \"snaps\" to invisible grids on the desktop so the movement of the window is more of a left/right up/down slide vs floating like other applications \n\nRectangle drawing tool selection is too intrusive/sensitive? try drawing one inside of each other, just wants to move around the first one\nResize \"Dots\" on the rectangle and other draw elements are way too big in my opinion (maybe 75% of that current size)\n. \n",

Now I understand, but to be honest it's very illogical and not intuitive (which should be the main goal of a UI).\nAny plans to include a normal cursor function which allows to select and move elements? That would hugely improve the tool and make it usable again.. Thanks @Jaex, that will help a lot!\nAny chance you're going to add a pointer which can select all elements?

With the new editor, everytime I change my annotation color it is very difficult to go back and get the same color again for the next annotation.  \nI also find many settings like \"border size\" are more buried in drop-down menus etc which make it more frustrating to use.  Commonly used settings like this to me feel like they should be easy to access on the main toolbar, not buried down in sub menus.\nThe arrow tool is also less useful as you cant pick which end of the line to place the arrowhead.\nIt would be less disappointing if you can bring back some of this functionality.\nI still think ShareX is an awesome application and recommend it to all my colleagues but I think I'm gonna roll back to 12.0 for now as this new editor is just too frustrating to use at present.. @Jaex\nWow, that is awesome.

Firstly why the hell are you recording for 1 hour? if you are recording a game use OBS, Sharex was made for examples and showing off a few seconds of something\ni don't see this needing to be added, again you shouldn't be recording for 1 hour. it takes about 10 seconds to download, install, and setup OBS for screen recordings, they even have a setup wizard for streaming or recording if you don't know how to set the screen as a source. ShareX is SIMPLY not made to make hour long screen recordings, it is for small demos for example the demo on main page of https://getsharex.com/, tho this one is a gif xD but this is what you would do with screen recordings. Adding a confirm box to stop or abort would simply slow things down for simple demo video tasks. Remember to add a confirmation when stopping too because i misclicked and save the recording, also one for when starting a recording, opening sharex, and taking a screenshot and closing sharex , etc\nanyway i don't think this is needed but hey you can toggle it at least i guess. https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX/issues/3287. ik i was tagging that issue in this pr so people can read it.

    "norweeg": "Yes, I've seen and am well aware of that, but I have also had it go from False to True for seemingly no reason at all (possibly after an application update).  My request is because I am somewhat perturbed by the fact that uploading is default 'on' after install instead of off, when, in my opinion, image upload should be opt-in not opt-out.  I am also bothered by the fact that, even after making this option 'True', the upload options are still visible in the menu.  I do consider ShareX to be among the best screen capture applications available, however, I struggle to understand what the use case is that necessitates default uploading of every screen capture to an image sharing service.  . All I'm asking is please consider the use case of someone who just wants a quality screen capture application, nothing more, nothing less.  Judging by the name of the application I'm guessing you consider image sharing to be the core purpose of the application instead of screen capture and markup. @stuntguy3000 its not just in a secure organization.  Say, for example, I'm just an average user who wanted to capture and OCR something on screen on a personal computer, which does not have enterprise-managed security or firewall, that contains my personal information for the purpose of sharing with someone I want to disclose this info to.  I should not have to worry about ShareX inadvertently exposing this data publicly via image/text upload either by default in its default configuration or its tendency to revert to its default configuration for reasons unknown.  Honestly I don't understand why the sharing is part of the core functionality of what is ostensibly a screen capture application and not an optional add-on or plug-in.  I can see from looking at reviews of sharex online that other people consider the on-by-default image upload functionality to be similarly problematic and undesirable.  . Snipping tool does not do OCR, scrolling capture, webpage capture, screen recording, or image markup (the open in image editor after capture action), and in fact, very few FOSS screen capture applications do these things and I don't think any do ALL of them like ShareX does, which is why I value it.  As far as the name goes, I don't know why you stuck with that name as ShareX evolved from a simple image uploader to screen capture and image uploader, or why both these functions are rolled into a single application rather than two highly-compatible sibling projects with differing purposes/goals (e.g. ShareX and a hypothetical CaptureX).  Your own tagline and every description I have ever read of it on FOSS blogs, etc. bills ShareX primarily as a screen capture application, not an image uploading application, and the authors, similar to myself, probably have no idea ShareX started primarily as the latter and evolved into the former.  \nShareX is wonderful software, don't get me wrong.  I love FOSS that truly out-competes its commercial alternatives, its just a shame that I fear using it or recommending it to others less I or they inadvertently share publicly something they did not intend to when they thought they were just taking a screen capture.  I do see value in an image uploader, but as a stand-alone application rather than glommed onto what would otherwise be a perfect stand-alone screen capture application.  Just my two-cents.... ",

    "diegoteliz": "I'm agree with @AndroidDeveloperLB \nUsually after you copy something, then you'll paste it somewhere else, and the shortcut on any app would be CTRL + V. So having CTRL + C and not CTRL + SHIFT + C would have much more sense.\nI've been using the app for more than a month (everyday) and I just don't get used to it...\n(btw, I get the point about using CTRL+C to copy shapes, but current behavior if you don't have any shape selected is to copy the coordinates. Maybe considering that as alternative?). Hi @Jaex I don't think this request is a duplicate. #2984 refers to having keyboard shortcuts, whereas this one is about being able to customize those shortcuts.\nI'd like to see the same functionality, because for example I use the \"Copy image to clipboard\" quite often and the current CTRL + SHIFT + C keybind is quite unnatural and I don't get used to it.\nThe next \"natural\" step in any other app is just pressing CTRL + V to paste that image, so to me it would have much more sense just to set CTRL + C to copy to clipboard (which currently copies the coordinates : ex: X: 584 Y: -67, which I don't think I would ever use).\nThat would speed significantly my work :).

It would be useful as a plugin in the case you wanted to monitor your network connection but it shouldn't be baked into ShareX since it's completely unnecessary and very few people may use it.. So why not move all the tools into plugins?. Just remember, ShareX is a screen capture, file sharing, and productivity tool. Tools do have a place in ShareX, it's just that most people use it for the screen capture portion. This is why plugins should be added - if people don't want parts of ShareX, they can just disable them.. ",

They include the gAMA chunk in every PNG but depending on ICC profile adjust the value. Some people get away with a gamma of 1 so it cancels out during multiplication while others have a slightly adjusted gamma because they have professional configured displays (like myself), especially when you have something that doesn't have standard gamut (e.g my display covers full sRGB and most of REC 2020.) Seeing as ~99% of monitors are cheap TN panels (or Windows doesn't have an ICC profile so it uses the default.) this doesn't affect most users.\nI just verified this by adjusting my own ICC profile to have 6x larger gamut (no display does this but I wanted to be sure) and ShareX incorrectly exported #112233 as #ABC7E3 which is literally 6x the gamma. That's a major difference and a completely\ndifferent color.\nWhat MS is doing here is incorrect behavior and a bug in their GDI+ encoder. Other PNG libraries like libpng do not have these problems because the default is to never export a gAMA chunk unless you ask for it. Since people are working in linear space they expect their images to also stay linear. The work around on that page is actually a necessary evil in my opinion.\nThis will continue to become a problem as more people transition to displays that have wider color gamuts or just to displays that are seen as higher end and so MS includes ICC profiles in Windows updates for them.\nThat gAMA chunk is also responsible for causing some transparency issues too in PNGs. When you author a transparent image you may have an alpha of 0x00 which is fine, but the RGB channels often contain some garbage uninitialized data or if you're lucky, solid white and black. The gAMA correction still gets applied to those pixels and may cause them to stick out more when alpha blending (this issue is often solved by using premultiplied alpha.)\nI can get more into the science of these image formats and color theory if you want but this requires some fix..

The alternative would be to drop GDI+ and pickup some other library which may not be a bad idea if you want to support even more formats for export.

ImageMagick is a massive library indeed but it also does way more than what you need. You should check into FreeImage as an alternative.. No it wasn't, but it was also the least amount of work for the most amount of gain. I think that's an acceptable compromise. I wouldn't mind documenting it on the wiki either.. I can test a dev build later but looking at the commit this may strip data from an image that happens to encode 4 bytes as one of those chunks on a 4-byte boundary, shouldn't there be a condition to make sure it's a chunk?. Well the code just processes the whole file 4 bytes at a time, it's possible that there's some byte pattern that has the same value as one of the chunk's bytes and this will strip them. Oh never mind I misread the code, this will work.. ",
    "haasn": "\nBecause this issue happens to very small amount of people I don't prefer that workaround. If everyone was getting incorrect colors then of course this would be necessary, but there must be something different in your computer causing this issue. Not to mention I'm not sure is there a reason that header could be necessary for some users, otherwise why would Microsoft decide to include it by default with no option at all?\n\nMicrosoft is pretty much doing the correct thing here. When you take a screenshot of your display (in your display's native color space), tagging the resulting file with that same color space ensures consistent reproduction across platforms / devices.\nFor example, if I view an HD video file on a wide gamut display and take a screenshot of the windows, then send this screenshot somebody with a more standard sRGB display, they would see a very desaturated version of what I see - unless the screenshot was tagged with either an ICC profile of the target display, or gAMA/cHRM chunks approximating it (as a fallback - although note that gAMA is severely limited in that it can only handle pure power curves)..

    "Xenthys": "Maintaining ShareXen that also returns JSON for every request, I fully support this idea for multiple reasons:\n- Convenience. It would just be easier, maybe have some \"Delete from remote uploader\" button appear if there is a deletion URL.\n- Efficiency. Some people hurt themselves by having a bloated browser taking ages to start, with a lot of extensions. Making a simple request would be faster.\n- Security. Some uploaders put the user token itself in the deletion URL. Avoiding it to be in the browser history and seen by extensions would be nice.\nI assume people would like POST requests support, aka. deletion would be way more configurable than just being a stored URL in ShareX, but that would probably be too bloated in the end. Having ShareX do the request would already be a nice QOL improvement.. ",
