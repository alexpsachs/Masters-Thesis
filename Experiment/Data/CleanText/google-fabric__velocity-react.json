No longer passing opaque and duration down into the delegate.\n\nAlso added a height: '' to the slideDown so that things work right when you get extra clicky on the toggle.\nCommitting.\n. This should fix issue #6.\n. Are you running Node 0.10 or earlier? Sounds like some of the CSS libraries require at least Node 0.12: https://github.com/webpack/css-loader/issues/144\n. Interesting point.\nHaving the velocity-react components short-circuit out and not do anything on the server (including not requiring Velocity) I expect would be trivial.\nI would assume that in most cases the rest would just work; for consistency you'd want to \u201cfinish\u201d the Velocity animation as soon as the client was in play. While that has the potential for jumpiness, I think that in a lot of cases the \"end\" state for an animation matches the neutral rendering of the element, so you wouldn't notice.\nIs the short-circuiting something you're interested in putting together? If not I can take a look. I haven't done any isomorphic React, so if you could point me to a good toy starter project I could toss in a VelocityComponent and see what happens.\nCertainly being able to \u201cfinish\u201d an animation on the server would be ideal, to have the DOM match more correctly. I don't know how feasible that is or if it's on a roadmap. (cc: @kenwheeler)\n. @jamwaffles I think the firstChild error can come up if you don't have a child for the VelocityComponent. (Which is something that perhaps we should be tolerant of; though VelocityComponent has no DOM footprint of its own, and relies on a child to have a presence on the page.)\n. OK, I traced this out a bit. VelocityComponent plays fast-and-loose with findDOMNode to try and avoid having its own DOM footprint. This seems incompatible with server-side rendering.\nThe alternate trick of trying to add a ref to the child by cloning it also seems to fail in my testing of 0.13, possibly also because of VelocityComponent\u2019s lack of its own node.\nMy plan is to get this package working with 0.14, then see if the problem persists or if any new solutions present themselves.\nAs a last resort, we could make VelocityComponent take an optional prop that would cause it to render its own DOM node (a la ReactTransitionGroup) and that would likely smooth this over.\n. OK, pals. Looks like my investigations above were ERRONEOUS. Turns out (and I need to tattoo this to my trackpad or something), npm link and React do not play well together. That is, using npm link to pull in a dev version of velocity-react from a local repo does not work because velocity-react will resolve a different copy of react than the main app.\n@jamwaffles I believe this accounts for the firstChild error the two of us saw, and later \u201cOnly a ReactOwner can have refs\u201d errors I found.\nI'll close this since it's fixed on master, and get out a 1.0.1 release that includes the shim from #22.\n. Whoops. Thanks so much!\n. Hrm. What does this fix for you?\nThis breaks things from running npm run demo for me from the root source directory (/build/bundle.js not found in the webpack server). \nIs there a configuration or path that works in both places?\n. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. That react-dom bit will be a bit annoying; I think I'll cut a branch for the RC until it's released, and then I think we'll need to do a hard cut over with a 1.1* release or somesuch.\n- = might have to break out my semver docs\u2026 should it be 2.0 when the peerDependencies change so forcefully?\n. Noticed that React 0.14 is now official: http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html\nWill look into getting support going in the very near term.\n. Now fixed in v1.1.0 of velocity-react.\n. Is this a case where you have Velocity already as a dependency in your project? In that case, does npm dedupe do what you need to collapse the dependency tree?\n. FWIW the demo app uses webpack, though it's obviously quite toy. We have this at the top of the top-level component:\nrequire('velocity-animate');\nrequire('velocity-animate/velocity.ui');\n. Hrm. I noticed that the demo isn't the best case because it doesn't NPM-in the velocity-react bits.\nRegardless, in a separate toy project I still couldn't repro. I see that in ./node_modules/velocity-react/node_modules that there's no velocity-animate package of its own. NPM didn't install one there, and it's instead letting the one in ./node_modules/velocity-animate be used.\nThis is with NPM 2.14.4.\nMy package.json is:\n{\n  \"name\": \"velocity-test\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^0.13.3\",\n    \"velocity-animate\": \"^1.2.3\",\n    \"velocity-react\": \"^1.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"babel-core\": \"^5.8.25\",\n    \"babel-loader\": \"^5.3.2\",\n    \"react-hot-loader\": \"^1.3.0\",\n    \"style-loader\": \"^0.12.4\",\n    \"webpack\": \"^1.12.2\",\n    \"webpack-dev-server\": \"^1.12.0\"\n  }\n}\nAnd do the require for velocity-animate and velocity-animate/velocity.ui in an app.js, followed by a require for the MainComponent that requires velocity-react/velocity-component.\n. Here's the gist of my packaging test: https://gist.github.com/phopkins/d127287ffa950d3b0d2c\n. Closing, since I think npm dedupe pretty much solves this. Please re-open with more info if that's not the case.\n. Thanks for looking into this. I'll use this as the basis for the 0.14 support.\nI think it's still best-practice to keep the React stuff as peerDependencies to avoid duplicating Reacts, so I'll keep that pattern.\n. Closing, integrated this into #27. Thanks again!\n. Happy news! It should be secretly already there. Any props you pass to VelocityComponent that it doesn't interpret itself get passed in the options hash to Velocity. So, if you put a complete property on VelocityComponent it should get called.\nThe Velocity docs have a list of all the options.\n. P.S.: Glad to hear you're liking it!\n. This is a bug in velocity-react. ReactTransitionGroup clobbers the complete callback. I can look into fixing this, though if anyone wants to take a go at it LMK.\n. Put up #53 for this. Anyone who wants complete for VelocityTransitionGroup care to try it out?\n. Fixed in 1.1.2, now published.\n. Unfortunately, this is not enough right now. Closing this, will revisit after 0.14 support.\n. Re-opening because this does at least fix VelocityTransitionGroup.\n. On further testing, I believe that this fixes #14, at least for getting things to not crash.\n. See https://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/pull/22 for my version of this. (It's better to short-circuit VelocityTransitionGroup at the childFactory level.)\nNevertheless, I don't think this solves the entire problem, which is that React.findDOMNode in VelocityComponent does not seem to work on the client when running from a server-rendered DOM tree.\nHave you run into that, and, if so, do you have a solution? If so I can merge #22 and we can take it from there.\n. Can you pull the branch patch/shim-for-server-rendering and check w/ that? If so I can get it in.\nWhich components are you using? Is the _getDOMTarget method of VelocityComponent running over server-generated components once the client boots up?\nI'm curious to seeing what the conditions are that make this succeed or fail. I grabbed [https://github.com/RickWong/react-isomorphic-starterkit] and checked out the last 0.13.3 version and am plagued by VelocityComponent not working on the client as described in the original #14 report.\n. @mars Ah, ok. I think that's expected. I'll close this PR and merge the other one, and see about getting a release up.\nThanks for testing!\n. Good idea. I'll look into this.\n. That would be super awesome. Shouldn't be tooo much of a thing to export\nthe demo bundle in some fashion.

Thanks to @jmfurlott, the basic demo is accessible at: http://twitter-fabric.github.io/velocity-react/\n. I think the best way to achieve a \"chaining\" effect with these components is to just use a delay on the 2nd animation that matches the duration of the first. (You can use a constant or something to keep the 2 values in sync.)\n\nFor your problems above, you need to decide whether you're doing your widths in JS with styles/animations or in CSS with classes. Mixing the 2 will likely give you popping issues like you describe. (You may want to consider CSS transitions, for example, which should play well with the classes.)\nNot sure what you're trying to achieve on the right side, but bear in mind that if 2 elements need to take up the same space, absent negative margin shenanigans you'll need some amount of absolute positioning. The LoadingCrossfadeComponent in the demo code may give you an effect you want, though bear in mind it can be slightly finicky to get working.\n(Closing this as it is not an issue in velocity-component)\n. Yeah, that error commonly means that you have 2 React instances. velocity-react uses peerDependencies so it typically doesn't bring in its own React. You should try npm dedupe to prune your tree down to one React. \nNote that this can also come up if you are npm linking to a velocity-react directory that has all its dependencies installed. To test locally, you'll need to npm pack and then npm install the archive it creates. \n. I haven't much used react-router myself. Can anyone else chime in here?\nThe one I'm most familiar with is https://github.com/larrymyers/react-mini-router, which should work pretty trivially with VelocityTransitionGroup. Just call renderCurrentRoute as a child of VelocityTransitionGroup.\n. Thanks, @mars!\nI'll also add that for stuff like this, where your VelocityTransitionGroup has single elements that are coming and going, you may need to use absolute positioning during the transition to get overlap right. Take a look at the LoadingCrossfadeComponent in the demo source code to see one way of doing this.\n. I think what you want is covered by Velocity, which allows for a start value when tweening:\n<VelocityComponent animation={{top: [0, 100], opacity: [1, 0]}}>\u2026</VelocityComponent>\n(It's a bit counter-intuitive in that the second value in the array is the start, and the first is the end. It also only works for linear tweens AFAIK.)\nMake sure that this is what you want, though. If you're changing animations back and forth, you'll get a smoother effect without fixing the start value.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Ha! Thanks for catching this.\n. Was this in error?\n. Could you provide more details about what you\u2019re trying to do? How does the VelocityTransitionGroupChild get the custom props to begin with?\nI\u2019m not following how you couldn\u2019t put the props on the child elements when you create them as children of VelocityTransitionGroup initially.\n. The reason the child animation is not running is because, to React, the inner VelocityTransitionGroup and its child are appearing  in the DOM together. By default, the animations only run on children that enter/leave an existing TransitionGroup.\nTo get the behavior you want, add runOnMount={true} to the inner VelocityTransitionGroup so that it will animate in this circumstance.\nWhile there\u2019s no cross-element chaining as you see, it should be fairly easy to just add a delay on the inner animations so that they start when you want them to. (This gives you the flexibility to tweak things so that the fade in overlaps with the slide down if it\u2019s appropriate.)\nIt's also possible to use custom UI Pack effects to do chaining in most circumstances (see velocityHelpers.registerEffect) but that likely won\u2019t work in this case because the \u201cslide\u201d effects are custom internal to Velocity in order to get implicit heights right.\nAlso, make sure to have key properties on all children of VelocityTransitionGroup.\nDoes that fix things?\n. Hrm. Digging in, in slow motion, I noticed a few things.\nFirst up, there's a bug in VelocityTransitionGroup where it won\u2019t run any animations unless a leave prop is set. I\u2019ll get a fix for this out later today.\nSecond, it may help to make sure any inner element is block-level. React\u2019s TransitionGroup (and by extension, VelocityTransitionGroup) is a <span> by default. Use component=\"div\" to change this.\nI don\u2019t know if slideDown and delay are going to work well together. slideDown calculates the target height when it\u2019s called. If you\u2019re doing that on an element whose child\u2019s animation is delayed, that child may have display: none and therefore not influence its parent\u2019s height.\nYou could probably work around that by writing a custom animation for the child that doesn\u2019t affect the display and therefore height. (By default all Velocity UI Pack \u201cIn\u201d and \u201cOut\u201d animations mess with display.)\n. For the delayed element, you could do a custom animation that just went from opacity: 0 -> 1. You can put a \"style\" attribute for opacity: 0 on the enter/leave prop that will get set immediately, and then the animation would start after a delay.\nI think the delay is not really the issue as much as the Velocity UI Pack \"In\" transitions always starting from \"display: none\".\nAt any rate, glad you have something, and maybe this gives you ideas for improving it.\n. @kevinrobinson Can you re-approve? Updated CHANGELOG.md for #39.\n. Kevin's hanging out at #TwitterFlight. Selfin'.\n. The \"style\" just gets applied, since it\u2019s done via Velocity / DOM rather than React it's not straightforward to just \"undo\". You can often override it in the animation if that's necessary.\nFor doing a crossfade-like effect, I'd recommend only using \u201cposition: absolute\u201d for the leaving element, leaving the parent to size naturally from any entering element.\n. Makes sense. Thanks for putting this together.\n. Sounds like you don't have the Velocity UI Pack installed. At a top level of your app, include:\njavascript\nrequire('velocity-animate');\nrequire('velocity-animate/velocity.ui');\n. Thanks for bringing this to our attention. I think it would be up to Radium to avoid stomping existing style attributes, but that may not be feasible. (Vanilla React appears to be well more tolerant of this, even with setting style hashes on your elements.)\nIn the immediate term, I'm not sure there's anything we can do, given how Velocity operates completely outside of React and on the DOM directly.\nIf you do any investigation and get a lead on an approach that might resolve the compatibility between the libraries, FF to re-open and let us know what you find.\n. @ianobermiller I'm not familiar with Radium, but Velocity works outside of React and is setting the style values directly on the DOM node, which React typically leaves alone. My guess if there's a problem with Radium it is because Radium is somehow over-writing those, but this is coming from a place of speculation.\n. Thanks for the suggestion. Tweaked the language some and committed in #43.\n. Hrm. Good point. Let me look into this.\n. Does #54 help you with this?\nYou'll still want to wrap your primary require calls in:\nif (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n  \u2026\n}\nand the velocity-react components will use their shim.\n. Lemme get this reviewed and we can get a release up.\n. Fixed in 1.1.2.\n. Take a look at LoadingCrossfadeComponent in the demo code for how to switch an element to absolute as it leaves so that it doesn't take up space.\nPutting a delay on the enter animation may work, but the danger there is additional stuttering of the height. (I suspect it would only be feasible if you can let the container collapse down to 0 height.)\n. I suspect you need:\nimport {VelocityTransitionGroup} from 'velocity-react'\n. The 'velocity-react' model is a convenience that exports the 3 pieces of the library as a hash. The braces destructure that hash to give you access to just the component you want. \n. Are you using Webpack or some other packager that is aware of npm modules?\nYou'll need that for this library.\nOn Wednesday, November 4, 2015, Chris Drackett notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nactually the code I pasted below is causing issues with react, so I don't\ncurrently have a solution :)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/issues/47#issuecomment-153913032\n.\n.

Try doing an npm dedupe to make sure there aren't alternate Velocity runtimes being loaded.\n\nAlso, not sure how it pans out, but make sure some subtle difference between import and require isn't causing a problem, since the Velocity libs are not \"pure\" in the module sense.\n. Not sure what the best practice is here. If you do a peerDependency, it\nwould need to be explicitly added as a dependency to the parent app.\nI don't know enough about NPM to know when it puts transitive dependencies\nin the package's root, and when they go into the sub-packages (though\nversion numbers may have something to do with it). It may also vary by NPM\nversion.\nOn Thu, Apr 7, 2016 at 3:16 PM, David Calhoun notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@finneganh https://github.com/finneganh I thought about this some more.\nShould velocity-animated be added as a peerDependency for this package?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/issues/50#issuecomment-207055094\n. Latest version has this tip in the README, in case it bites someone else.\n. @lauffenp what's the stack trace on that? Neither velocity-react nor velocity use localeCompare directly.. You may not have been specifying display right. You'l need to do it for each of the animations. E.g.\n\n<VelocityTransitionGroup component='tbody' enter={{ animation: 'slideDown', display: 'table-row' }} leave={{ animation: 'slideUp', display: 'table-row' }}>          \n      {history.map(this.renderRows}}\n    </VelocityTransitionGroup>\nand see if that helps.\n. What URL are you going to in the browser?\n. The leave animation is always finished on an element before the enter animation runs, to try to make sure that enter animations always have a consistent state.\nNot sure either way on having the begin trigger in this case or not. Probably it shouldn't; actually #53 removes that behavior for complete, so perhaps they should be consistent.\nWhat's your use case?\n. Closing. Re-open w/ further information if this is causing problems.\n. There may be some hacks you could do by temporarily changing the enter / leave props when you know filtering is happening. You could also try some nested shenanigans (in other words, make filtering change rows' display or inner contents rather than adding / removing them from the parent element).\n. Does leaving out the enter/leave properties have any effect?\nOn Fri, Dec 4, 2015 at 3:08 PM, Chris Drackett notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI'm using a VelocityTransitionGroup for a Loading element that shows a\nspinner while it has no children and then fades the spinner out and fades\nthe children in when they exist.

OK. Animations start on a next tick so that all the animations for a single VelocityTransitionGroup can be collected and fired together (this makes things like stagger work). Your calculations are probably happening before the animations have started, which may be causing the issue.\n. I think Velocity may have a \"begin\" callback that you could put on enter or\nleave.\n\nOn Mon, Dec 7, 2015 at 12:56 PM, Chris Drackett notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI see, so is there any way to measure an element that is used in\nVelocityTransitionGroup?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/issues/57#issuecomment-162607580\n.\n.

After thinking about this a little, I'd recommend trying to subclass\nVelocityTransitionGroup. If you mark your nodes in some manner with whether\nthey should be animated or not (with classes, perhaps?) you can override\nchildWillAppear, childWillEnter, and childWillLeave. Use your own logic to\nshort-circuit out of those functions (just call the doneFn and return) and\nonly call the \"super\" implementations when you want animation to happen.\n\nYou could also put together a PR to allow the wrapper component class,\ncurrently VelocityTransitionGroupChild, to be parameterized as a prop to\nVelocityTransitionGroup. Then you could implement the logic in your custom\nchild's componentWillAppear / componentWillEnter / componentWillLeave\n(calling the willAppearFunc / willEnterFunc / willLeaveFunc props as\nnecessary).\nI think the latter's nicer because I prefer composition over inheritance\nfor customization (esp. given the state of JS \"classes\"), but the former\nyou could get started on right away.\nOn Tue, Dec 8, 2015 at 11:08 PM, Richard Lopes notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHello,\nHaving great success with the library so far.\nHowever I got a new requirement causing me some grief to achieve.\nI have 2 pages:\n- a list of items (that you can sort and filter)\n- a form to create new items\nI have 2 API endpoints:\n- one gets the original list of items\n- one returns new items that have been added by other users\nThis is how it works:\n1. when the list of items first load, items are rendered without animation\n2. when you filter or sort the list, items are rendered without animation\n3. when the second API notify new items have been added, those are\nrendered in the list with animation\n4. when an item is deleted, it gets removed with an animation\n5. when a user leave the list page to create an item on the second page,\nhe is redirected back to the list page after creation, the new item only\nmust be rendered with animation\nAt the moment I achieve 1 to 4 but I am having problems with 5 (5 leaves\nthe list page then come back, unmount/mount items). If I turn on animation\n(on mount) all items are animated as no item was (React) mounted yet.

The sentiment there is that you can have VelocityComponent and VelocityTransitionGroup in server-rendered code, they just won't have any effect at all.\n\nAn incompatible implementation couldn't run. A compatible implementation would probably output HTML for the components that reflected the end state of specified animations.\n. That line is in there because, due to React's TransitionGroup's API, we\nhave no way of getting all of the children that are entering or leaving\nother than collecting them and waiting a tick to know that the collection\nis complete. We want to batch all of the child animations in one go in\norder to support Velocity options like stagger.\nWithout that display: none or an alternate means of hiding, elements would\nflash in for that tick before the animation started.\nI could imagine a position: absolute / opacity: 0 combo, or height: 0, or\nsomething else that would keep the element from appearing. Would one of\nthose work for your use case?

Sorry for the confusion. You're the second person who brought it up, so I re-worked to match the sentiment I was going for in #67.\n. I haven't tried it, but it's likely to work, since velocity-react just calls Velocity on child DOM nodes.\n\nYou may or may not want runOnMount to be true, depending upon how you want the \u201canimation\u201d\u00a0to be triggered.\n. You'll want to add a ref to the component so you can access it, and call runAnimation on it when you want it to fire off.\n. Try translateX as the key to the style block. velocity-react uses Velocity's style setting for consistency, not React's.\n. You\u2019ll need the component to stay in the DOM for the duration of the animation for the effect to appear. Two options come to mind:\n- Keep using VelocityComponent, rendered all of the time, but use Velocity\u2019s display property (not in animation, but as its own prop) to get the element to display block/none at the beginning/end of the animation as necessary.\n- Use VelocityTransitionGroup and have the white overlay as a child that\u2019s added/removed from it. VelocityTransitionGroup will keep the child in the DOM while the animation runs, even if you\u2019re no longer rendering it, and remove it when the animation is over.\n. Cool, thanks for sending this in!\n. Double-check that all versions of Velocity you have installed are 1.2.3? (Perhaps with npm dedupe as well.)\n. I think the problem is the <div> around your OrdersList and the OrdersList itself. ReactTransitionGroup \u2014 and therefore VelocityTransitionGroup \u2014 operates only on direct children. You will need the components you\u2019re adding / removing to be direct children of a VelocityTransitionGroup to animate them.\n. Not sure what the error is\u2026 we're pegged to the 3.10 implementation.\n. Presumably we could upgrade to 4, though I don't see why you'd be getting an error now. In my tests, NPM installed lodash 3.10 into velocity-react's node_modules folder.\nYou may need to wipe your node_modules directory and do a re-install to get that, though.\n.

Check and see if the Velocity docs on SVG have the info you need.\n. For things like this, turning the animation speed waaaaay down is a good way to test this. That will let you inspect the DOM as it's moving.\n\nMy guess on this is that the animation is playing, but since you have 2 elements in the container, one is either covering the other or, more likely, bumping it down so that it can't be seen.\nYou may want to look over the sample code for the crossfade animation, which shows switching a leaving element over to position: absolute so that both elements can coexist on screen.\n. This is currently by design because the leave animation is run to completion before an element is added, so that elements can base their enter animations off of a consistent \u201cleft\u201d state.\nI think I\u2019d be open to a patch that would not run either of the \u201cleave\u201d callbacks in this case, however.\n.

That should give you enough time to investigate what's going on in a web inspector. The React TransitionGroup code should be keeping DOM elements in the correct order, providing your key attributes aren\u2019t changing, so I would suspect there\u2019s either something with keys or with your animation.\n. Glad to hear!\n. Sounds like this may be something on the React Template side? VelocityTransitionGroup does not use refs itself. You could see if you get the same problem using React\u2019s TransitionGroup, which is what VTG delegates to.\n. Try looping with a simpler animation (e.g. just a property hash).

VelocityTransitionGroup sets a complete handler, but I don't\nknow exactly how that interacts with the complete handler that UI Pack\nadds.

Hopefully NPM is clever enough with that react-addons-transition-group to pull in the 0.14 version if your project is already using React 0.14.\n. I could go either way, depending upon how NPM complains. tween-state is only used for the demo, not the library itself.\n. @StevenLangbroek Can you give it a try to just put the devDependencies to 15?\n. Switched to make the demo use React 15 in a separate PR. Thanks for opening this, though!\n.

Sorry to hear you had an issue. The 1.1.5 change does just add React 15 as an option along with 0.14 (the velocity-react code was already compatible with both) but NPM's interpretation of that seems to have done you wrong.\nI suspect what happened was you're using a version of NPM that is installing peerDependencies automatically, and NPM pulled in React 15 off of velocity-addons-transition-group's peerDependencies (which it got by choosing to use v15 of that package, rather than 0.14, even though both are supported).\nYou way want to depend specifically on velocity-addons-transition-group at 0.14.x. velocity-react supports both.\nI'm sorry this caused a production problem.

You may need to specify react-addons-transition-group at 0.14.x in your dependencies.\n\nSorry for the headaches around this; for some reason this React upgrade isn't going as smoothly as 0.13 -> 0.14.\nI think one lesson is to always make sure you're shrinkwrapping your dependencies so this doesn't bite arbitrarily.\n. For debugging stuff like this, I usually recommend slowing the animation down to 30s or so you have enough time to look in the web inspector to see how styles are cascading or conflicting.\nThis may be an issue you'd need to address with Velocity to allow for animation styles that override !important CSS.\n. I haven\u2019t looked closely at that, as I'm not sure how it would fit in with the declarative approach to animations. Feel free to discuss if you have a feeling of how it would integrate.\n. Ha! Awesome. Thanks for catching.\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry the documentation isn't very clear about this. I think the intent was to describe that you can use the targetQuerySelector prop to add the animation to multiple elements, which in this case are not strictly children but grandchildren or below.\n. Let me see if I can convey that better.\n. FWIW VelocityComponent requires a single child because it doesn't have a DOM wrapper element of its own.\n. Use VelocityTransitionGroup when you want the behavior of a React TransitionGroup (animations on elements entering / leaving the DOM). Docs here: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html\nUse VelocityComponent otherwise.\n. It comes down to if you're animating an element in place, vs. if you need\nto animate a component as it enters or leaves the DOM.

Put them in the hashes alongside animation.\n. Curious. I wonder if this is a permanent change or a webhost mixup. At any rate, we can revert later if necessary.\n. Thanks!\n. I think you'll need to investigate what isn't smooth about the current effect. There a lot of processing going on when the routes change, or just components resizing when they get new data and that throwing off the animation.\n\nI believe you could add a complete callback to the VelocityTransitionGroup's enter or leave animations that will get called when the effect is done. That may help, though there might be some bookkeeping to translate that to a specific component.\n. I'm not necessarily against this, but I want to make sure it's doing what you intend.\nWhen the duration changes, the animation will restart from the current DOM state, without memory of any previous animation or duration. So, if the box is halfway across the screen and you half the duration, the new animation will actually proceed at the same rate, as it has only half the distance to go.\nIs the effect you want better expressed through a custom tween or multi-step animation?\n. Closing this without a compelling use-case. I don't think duration changes are conceptually the right fit for the declarative way velocity-react works, due to the non-intuitive way they work with any in-progress animations.\n. Curious. The slideUp/slideDown animations are handled a little bit specially by Velocity; I don't know if that affects the way that the complete callback is called.\nLooking at where the error might happen in ReactTransitionGroup, it's something around the doneFn callback being called but the child element it was originally bound to is no longer present. Might be worth checking to see if somehow slideUp is calling its complete handler twice or something.\nI think that removeAll may be aggravating this because that example as originally written was being sloppy about keys. They've been based on array position, rather than something more intrinsic. That may have masked this bug because the doneFn lookup by key that happens in ReactTransitionGroup would have succeeded accidentally if the key were re-used.\n. Cool. This seems reasonable. I think this also safe server-side since componentWillUnmount isn't called then.\nHeads up, @kenwheeler, it might be nicer to have a Velocity helper for clearing this data rather than duplicating the ['velocity', 'fxqueue'] keys in this code.\n. I'd like to merge this, I just need to validate that it's also fine when jQuery is installed.\n. Demo still seems to work with this, so I think it's safe.\n. Would it work for you to include a complete callback and then call the runAnimation method on the component manually to cause a loop?\nDoes RunSequence have support for looping in a way that's different from calling $.velocity?\n. @tonybaroneee FF to send to me. I've been on vacation but I need to get back to maintaining this project.\n. The \"reverse\" value for an animation is not a great fit for VelocityTransitionGroup because elements may need to animate out without having been animated in. (See: http://velocityjs.org/#reverse Reverse just undoes the most recent animation on an element)\nIt's best to make an opposite animation.\n. Since you want your animation to be affected by the derivative of your state, rather than the state itself, I'd recommend calling the runAnimation method on a VelocityComponent in your componentDidUpdate method on detecting that the current value is different from the previous value (which are passed to componentDidUpdate).\n. Are you using VelocityComponent or VelocityTransitionGroup? \n. Added a review to that PR. I know it's been a little while. LMK if you want to update the PR or I can take over the fix.\n. Just merged. Will be in the next release.\n. I've been looking into this a little more. In my tests, loading the demo with jsdom worked. I couldn't reproduce the require error.\nI'm not sure there's a particular reason why velocity-react shouldn't work with jsdom around, and I wonder if the require error you have is from something else. Leaving the jsdom exclusion in for now, but that might get revisited if it comes up as a feature request from someone else.\n. What's your version of lodash?\nI'm hesitant to do this because the original intention of those requires is to only pull in the specific functions so as not to bloat the imports with all of object, array, &c. since tree-shaking is not widely available for JS importing.\n. This package is still using lodash 3. There may be something up with your npm importing if it's finding a different version.\n. Awesome. Thanks!\n. Really? OK. Disappointing that they're parsing code with RegExps, but it's no big deal to change this on our end.\n.

You should be able to modify the easing w/ additional arguments. Unfortunately the registerEffect bits are not well-documented in Velocity. You can also set the initial width I think with:\n\n[{\n  width: [20, 10],\n  left: \u2026\n}, \u2026]\nI believe that you cannot loop registerEffect animations, but you could add a complete handler to the component and have that call runAnimation.\n. This seems to be an NPM / Treebeard issue. Treebeard's dev dependencies specify React 0.14.8, but the NPM I have (2.7.5) is installing a React for velocity-react's peerDependency, even though 0.14.8 should satisfy the ||.\nIn your own app, lock React down at 15.something and I expect you won't have warnings.\nI'm not sure if npm 3 would handle this case better.\n. Looks like this is an issue with the new garbage collection, as it uses a Velocity API that's not shimmed out in server / test mode. Will get a new release out presently.\n. Should be fixed in 1.1.7.\n. Fixed in 1.1.8. Thanks @stephenleicht for the fix.\n. Thanks!\n. Selfie since this is breaking IE compat.\n.

Where is resolve.modules being set? Is there a reason it doesn\u2019t include the default \"node_modules\"?. What's the ordering in resolve.modules? is \"node_modules\" first?\n\n. @STRML In that case I would recommend following the example here: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-modules\nand using __dirname, as relative paths in resolve.modules are treated differently from absolute paths.. The reason is that I'm not interested spending my time testing and doing a release to work around others' non-standard module resolution rules. velocity-react's use of lodash 3 is entirely within spec. . Right, I didn't mean to imply that it's just you who's having module resolution problems since, as you saw from the other responses to this issue, it's not just you. I get frustrated that every few months I have to respond to folks whose setups can't handle a very straightforward relative node_modules include which is why, TBH, I'm acting a little bitchy about this.\nIn general I don't update modules just for kicks. For utility stuff like this, I'd rather stick with something that I know works than chase updates.\nThe only argument interesting to me is file size, except that even that's predicated on more folks using 4 than 3 in production, and the site that this library was built for originally is still on 3.. I'd recommend checking and seeing what's installed under\nvelocity-react/node_modules and poking in your lock file to see what it\nsays about lodash. Sounds more like your modules are not installed\ncorrectly rather than a webpack config aliasing lodash or using a\nnon-standard module resolver.\nOn Sun, Nov 5, 2017 at 3:00 PM, Vincent Lecrubier notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nJust coming here to say that I got the same bug, caused by this dependency\non lodash 3. I do not use velocity on my project, it is a dependency of a\nreact-storybook, and it is really annoying that my project dev experience\nis hampered by this.\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'lodash/object/omit' in '/xxx/node_modules/velocity-react'\n@finneganh https://github.com/finneganh , do you have any pointers to\nwhere react-storybook is using a non standard webpack setup ?

Aha, interesting. Good find. I can probably figure out how to work around that in how VelocityTransitionGroup generates its complete function.\n. Yeah, you'd need to do something tricky to handle the class coming in later, which would be dependent upon whatever you're using to do lazy loading.. I believe the stagger option has to be passed in the enter/exit props as that\u2019s how it gets passed to the Velocity options argument.\n. See the \"On Demand\" section of the demo. You'll want to call runAnimation on the component after you detect the increment. See the \"Interruption Behavior\" options for ways to handle when the animation calls overlap.\n. Can you be clearer about what you're doing and what error you're seeing?. I think this will be fixed in the next release, which fixed the undefined forEach problem.. I'd recommend not doing the queue stuff but instead change all the properties in one call. There is a somewhat undocumented way you can specify per-property easing with registerEffect, which you can see an example of here: https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/blob/master/velocity.ui.js#L541. Sounds like you need to check your dependencies, and possibly re-build your node_modules directory.. You need runOnMount={true}. Thanks for the fix!. If you use registerAnimation you can make an animation with sequential\nsteps. The syntax of nested arrays is a bit tricky, so check the Velocity\ndocs for how to do it.\nOn Thu, Dec 15, 2016 at 3:39 AM Martin notifications@github.com wrote:\nIs there a way to queue up multiple animations like vanilla Velocity does\nwith calling it multiple times or chaining the promises?\nI'd like to transform my css animation that is a multistep keyframe\nanimation to a component and run this on mount.\n@keyframes dash {\n0%{\nstroke-dasharray: 1,200;\n\nstroke-dashoffset: 0;\n\n}\n50%{\nstroke-dasharray: 89,200;\n\nstroke-dashoffset: -35;\n\n}\n100%{\nstroke-dasharray: 89,200;\n\nstroke-dashoffset: -124;\n\n}\n}\nWith Velocity i would just call it 3 times on the DOM object and give the\nlast animation loop: true so that it runs infinitely.

Not sure. I guess I'd try to avoid setting a resolveLoader at all, but you'd know better what led you to using it.. VelocityTransitionGroup will run its animation when its child unmounts. I suspect you just need to rearrange things so that your VelocityTransitionGroup is sticking around, and its children are the only ones entering / leaving.. Are you trying to animate the SVG or just have the SVG in an animated component?\n\nI think I used react-svg-loader at Fabric, but never tried to animate the internals of a sprite.. Right, hidden components will still take up space.\nI'd recommend using VelocityTransitionGroup. That will let you run an animation when the component is unmounted. Just change your logic to no longer render the component, and the library will animate it away.. Check your node_modules (perhaps by deleting them and doing a clean npm install). This error can come up when you have 2 copies of React loaded..

It should be the case that you want the animation prop to be \"scroll\", then pass the duration and easing as props to VelocityComponent.\n\nFrom the VelocityComponent docs: \u201cUnrecognized properties are passed as options to Velocity (e.g. duration, delay, loop).\u201d. Does leaving off the loop param change anything?. You\u2019ll need to make sure that you\u2019re using Velocity 1.2.3 or later. I'm not sure how materialize is bringing it in, I couldn't obviously see from their code. You could poke around in Velocity to see how it attaches to window; I\u2019m not sure if requiring a later Velocity would overwrite the earlier one globally.. Are you importing Velocity directly? The library should avoid this issue for itself through lib/velocity-animate-shim.js. Maybe look in there and see if you can tell why it's trying to do the real import server-side. . Only import velocity and velocity.ui in your client code\u2019s entry point. Use velocity-react elsewhere in your components and it should avoid loading velocity on the server.. Looking at your code, I get the impression that on delete you\u2019re removing the VelocityTransitionGroup as well. You\u2019ll need to keep it around.\nTransitionGroups are able to run for their children that leave the DOM, but if they themselves are removed then they\u2019re just gone.. I can\u2019t quite tell from your code. What are you seeing and what are you expecting?\nVelocityTransitionGroup is for when you have direct children entering and leaving the DOM, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with GalleryManager, at least in the code that you\u2019ve provided.. If all the elements are added to the VelocityTransitionGroup at once then you don\u2019t need targetQuerySelector, just stagger.\nThis is shown in the \u201cAdd 5 Rows\u201d part of the demo: https://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/blob/master/demo/examples/scrolling-group.jsx\nAlso note that targetQuerySelector is only for VelocityComponent, not VelocityTransitionGroup.. I can\u2019t reproduce this this morning, with npm or yarn. Are you still seeing the issue?. React is reconciling that to be the same <Image> component. Use a different key to force React to treat the Image as distinct.. Error message seems to indicate you have something else running at port 8080 on that machine.. You can see in the demo code how to use registerEffect to define animations in your own codebase.. It sounds like multiple React versions on the page so certainly double-check that in your node_modules. Other than that I\u2019m not sure.\nvelocity-react doesn\u2019t use refs itself, though ReactTransitionGroup does.. What does the code look like?. I suspect that the issue is the VelocityTransitionGroup is being removed from the DOM while the transition around the Image is still going on.\nYou should in general have your VelocityTransitionGroups be stable on the page, and only their contents appear and disappear.. You'll need to do your own window detection around a require for velocity.ui.\n. You may be able to start the tab with display: none, and I believe that Velocity may show it automatically.. You could give it a try but you'll probably have to do some digging yourself to see how the tabs are interacting with velocity.. The velocity animations don't run at all on the server. You'll want to display:none the element yourself and let velocity show it on the client.. Velocity doesn't have a slideLeft built in. The UI pack has transition.slideLeftIn and transition.slideLeftOut as preregistered effects, however.\nhttp://velocityjs.org/#uiPack. Thanks for the heads up.

Happy to consider a pull request.. Fixed in v1.3.0. Thanks for your patience!. FF to open a pull request!. Yeah, this is a bit complicated because slideDown / slideUp are custom animations in Velocity (in order to handle the height issue) so they can't be easily composed with the CSS animations.\n\nI think what you have is reasonable. . Awesome, thanks!!!. Cool. I should be able to push this out tomorrow. I wonder how many folks are on pre-15.. I'll do a patch release. I admit to not being overly pedantic about semver and dependencies.. Especially since the only reason to upgrade is to support more recent versions of React.. You're not forced to upgrade velocity-react. That being said, I think anyone developing apps without using a dependency lock file is asking for trouble already.. Thanks for having my back on the peer dependencies. It's clearly something I should have paid more attention to. Yay, open source!. Thanks for the fix!. This means you can do:\n<VelocityComponent animation=\"transition.slideLeftIn\" duration={500} delay={1000} />\n\u201cunrecognized\u201d in this case means props that aren\u2019t handled directly by VelocityComponent.. Eeep. Good catch. Thanks!. Fixed in v1.3.3. You can chain animations using UI pack and VelocityHelpers.registerEffect. The API syntax is a little wonky, just pass additional elements in the calls array property when you register the animation. Velocity will run the first animation, then run the second. That will let you chain the two translates without any explicit effort on your part.. Here\u2019s an example of registerEffect with a single call: \nhttps://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/blob/master/demo/examples/flap-box.jsx#L18\nadd more to the calls array to chain effects.. You should define the two animations outside of your render method, one for collapse and one for not-collapsed, and then use this.props.collapse to choose which one to pass as animation.. I'm open to PRs, but won't implement this personally.\nNote that most of the typing would actually come from Velocity.js, since these components pass through many of the props.. Thanks for putting this together. I'll try and take a look and see about getting it in. I use Flow rather than TypeScript in my own projects, so I'd have to get familiar with it first.. What effect are you trying to achieve?. That would be tricky. Calling Velocity.stop on the animated elements would stop them from animating. But, it would also cause the TransitionGroup to keep them around because stop keeps the complete callback from firing, which is how VelocityTransitionGroup can tell TransitionGroup to finally remove the element.\nYou might have better luck wrapping each image in a <VelocityComponent>, which can have its animation stopped (by setting its animation prop to null).. Is the issue here w/ velocity-react > 1.1.4 or react-transition-group >= 1.2.0?. runAnimation can be called externally with a config. See the demo.. I suppose it could, but consolidating that isn't a huge priority.. I think that this question is outside the scope of velocity-react issues.. Pretty sure that this wouldn't solve any bundle size issues as now the 4.x lodash modules may be coming from different places. \nI maintain that in a correctly-functioning build setup the current use of lodash 3 should not cause a problem. . For starters, just call registerEffect at the top of the file, not each time through render. \nYour calls property needs an extra set of []s. Yes, it\u2019s odd, but that's how Velocity.RegisterEffect wants it. See the comment at the top of the velocity-helpers.js file.. Any reason why you think that this is important? The v1 branch is still being maintained. . Yeah, that's the big question. If not, I'll work on getting this upgraded,\nsince I want to use 16, too, but working through any timing changes with\nthe new version RTG implementation will likely be a pain.\nOn Sat, Sep 16, 2017 at 6:22 AM Luke Page notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nOk, sorry I didn't realize that.. if v1 will support react 16 it's not\nimportant to me.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/issues/224#issuecomment-329959910,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAP65TJdCsMsPkTFTCROnN_NM5puiRHZks5si6FMgaJpZM4PZxWq\n.\n.

Have you noticed any issues at 1.2? I know at least someone else on here downgraded back to 1.1. . \n. Not sure quite what effect you\u2019re going for, but using VelocityTransitionGroup to switch between two views is just going to be tricky. During transition, you\u2019ll likely have both views appearing, messing up the parent height. \n\nGood luck in debugging. I tend to slow the animations way down to see what\u2019s going on in detail. \nI have done a cross fade in the past, between two views of the same height. The trick is to set the leaving one to position absolute so it can exist in the same space as the entering one. . Thanks! I hadn't realized that they changed the org.. Not something I\u2019m interested in right now. If this package ever needs a large overhaul (like switching to the 2.0 API for react-transition-group) I\u2019d probably tackle other dependency updates at that point. . Your problem likely lies elsewhere. With a well-configured npm and resource bundler, the version of lodash that velocity-react uses should not impact any uses of different versions of lodash in your app.\nOr feel free to just use your fork.

This should fix issue #6.\n. Are you running Node 0.10 or earlier? Sounds like some of the CSS libraries require at least Node 0.12: https://github.com/webpack/css-loader/issues/144\n. Interesting point.\nHaving the velocity-react components short-circuit out and not do anything on the server (including not requiring Velocity) I expect would be trivial.\nI would assume that in most cases the rest would just work; for consistency you'd want to \u201cfinish\u201d the Velocity animation as soon as the client was in play. While that has the potential for jumpiness, I think that in a lot of cases the \"end\" state for an animation matches the neutral rendering of the element, so you wouldn't notice.\nIs the short-circuiting something you're interested in putting together? If not I can take a look. I haven't done any isomorphic React, so if you could point me to a good toy starter project I could toss in a VelocityComponent and see what happens.\nCertainly being able to \u201cfinish\u201d an animation on the server would be ideal, to have the DOM match more correctly. I don't know how feasible that is or if it's on a roadmap. (cc: @kenwheeler)\n. @jamwaffles I think the firstChild error can come up if you don't have a child for the VelocityComponent. (Which is something that perhaps we should be tolerant of; though VelocityComponent has no DOM footprint of its own, and relies on a child to have a presence on the page.)\n. OK, I traced this out a bit. VelocityComponent plays fast-and-loose with findDOMNode to try and avoid having its own DOM footprint. This seems incompatible with server-side rendering.\nThe alternate trick of trying to add a ref to the child by cloning it also seems to fail in my testing of 0.13, possibly also because of VelocityComponent\u2019s lack of its own node.\nMy plan is to get this package working with 0.14, then see if the problem persists or if any new solutions present themselves.\nAs a last resort, we could make VelocityComponent take an optional prop that would cause it to render its own DOM node (a la ReactTransitionGroup) and that would likely smooth this over.\n. OK, pals. Looks like my investigations above were ERRONEOUS. Turns out (and I need to tattoo this to my trackpad or something), npm link and React do not play well together. That is, using npm link to pull in a dev version of velocity-react from a local repo does not work because velocity-react will resolve a different copy of react than the main app.\n@jamwaffles I believe this accounts for the firstChild error the two of us saw, and later \u201cOnly a ReactOwner can have refs\u201d errors I found.\nI'll close this since it's fixed on master, and get out a 1.0.1 release that includes the shim from #22.\n. Whoops. Thanks so much!\n. Hrm. What does this fix for you?\nThis breaks things from running npm run demo for me from the root source directory (/build/bundle.js not found in the webpack server). \nIs there a configuration or path that works in both places?\n. Thanks for bringing this to my attention. That react-dom bit will be a bit annoying; I think I'll cut a branch for the RC until it's released, and then I think we'll need to do a hard cut over with a 1.1* release or somesuch.\n- = might have to break out my semver docs\u2026 should it be 2.0 when the peerDependencies change so forcefully?\n. Noticed that React 0.14 is now official: http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html\nWill look into getting support going in the very near term.\n. Now fixed in v1.1.0 of velocity-react.\n. Is this a case where you have Velocity already as a dependency in your project? In that case, does npm dedupe do what you need to collapse the dependency tree?\n. FWIW the demo app uses webpack, though it's obviously quite toy. We have this at the top of the top-level component:\nrequire('velocity-animate');\nrequire('velocity-animate/velocity.ui');\n. Hrm. I noticed that the demo isn't the best case because it doesn't NPM-in the velocity-react bits.\nRegardless, in a separate toy project I still couldn't repro. I see that in ./node_modules/velocity-react/node_modules that there's no velocity-animate package of its own. NPM didn't install one there, and it's instead letting the one in ./node_modules/velocity-animate be used.\nThis is with NPM 2.14.4.\nMy package.json is:\n{\n  \"name\": \"velocity-test\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"^0.13.3\",\n    \"velocity-animate\": \"^1.2.3\",\n    \"velocity-react\": \"^1.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"babel-core\": \"^5.8.25\",\n    \"babel-loader\": \"^5.3.2\",\n    \"react-hot-loader\": \"^1.3.0\",\n    \"style-loader\": \"^0.12.4\",\n    \"webpack\": \"^1.12.2\",\n    \"webpack-dev-server\": \"^1.12.0\"\n  }\n}\nAnd do the require for velocity-animate and velocity-animate/velocity.ui in an app.js, followed by a require for the MainComponent that requires velocity-react/velocity-component.\n. Here's the gist of my packaging test: https://gist.github.com/phopkins/d127287ffa950d3b0d2c\n. Closing, since I think npm dedupe pretty much solves this. Please re-open with more info if that's not the case.\n. Thanks for looking into this. I'll use this as the basis for the 0.14 support.\nI think it's still best-practice to keep the React stuff as peerDependencies to avoid duplicating Reacts, so I'll keep that pattern.\n. Closing, integrated this into #27. Thanks again!\n. Happy news! It should be secretly already there. Any props you pass to VelocityComponent that it doesn't interpret itself get passed in the options hash to Velocity. So, if you put a complete property on VelocityComponent it should get called.\nThe Velocity docs have a list of all the options.\n. P.S.: Glad to hear you're liking it!\n. This is a bug in velocity-react. ReactTransitionGroup clobbers the complete callback. I can look into fixing this, though if anyone wants to take a go at it LMK.\n. Put up #53 for this. Anyone who wants complete for VelocityTransitionGroup care to try it out?\n. Fixed in 1.1.2, now published.\n. Unfortunately, this is not enough right now. Closing this, will revisit after 0.14 support.\n. Re-opening because this does at least fix VelocityTransitionGroup.\n. On further testing, I believe that this fixes #14, at least for getting things to not crash.\n. See https://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/pull/22 for my version of this. (It's better to short-circuit VelocityTransitionGroup at the childFactory level.)\nNevertheless, I don't think this solves the entire problem, which is that React.findDOMNode in VelocityComponent does not seem to work on the client when running from a server-rendered DOM tree.\nHave you run into that, and, if so, do you have a solution? If so I can merge #22 and we can take it from there.\n. Can you pull the branch patch/shim-for-server-rendering and check w/ that? If so I can get it in.\nWhich components are you using? Is the _getDOMTarget method of VelocityComponent running over server-generated components once the client boots up?\nI'm curious to seeing what the conditions are that make this succeed or fail. I grabbed [https://github.com/RickWong/react-isomorphic-starterkit] and checked out the last 0.13.3 version and am plagued by VelocityComponent not working on the client as described in the original #14 report.\n. @mars Ah, ok. I think that's expected. I'll close this PR and merge the other one, and see about getting a release up.\nThanks for testing!\n. Good idea. I'll look into this.\n. That would be super awesome.

Thanks to @jmfurlott, the basic demo is accessible at: http://twitter-fabric.github.io/velocity-react/\n. I think the best way to achieve a \"chaining\" effect with these components is to just use a delay on the 2nd animation that matches the duration of the first. (You can use a constant or something to keep the 2 values in sync.)\n\nFor your problems above, you need to decide whether you're doing your widths in JS with styles/animations or in CSS with classes. Mixing the 2 will likely give you popping issues like you describe. (You may want to consider CSS transitions, for example, which should play well with the classes.)\nNot sure what you're trying to achieve on the right side, but bear in mind that if 2 elements need to take up the same space, absent negative margin shenanigans you'll need some amount of absolute positioning. The LoadingCrossfadeComponent in the demo code may give you an effect you want, though bear in mind it can be slightly finicky to get working.\n(Closing this as it is not an issue in velocity-component)\n. Yeah, that error commonly means that you have 2 React instances. velocity-react uses peerDependencies so it typically doesn't bring in its own React. You should try npm dedupe to prune your tree down to one React. \nNote that this can also come up if you are npm linking to a velocity-react directory that has all its dependencies installed. To test locally, you'll need to npm pack and then npm install the archive it creates. \n. I haven't much used react-router myself. Can anyone else chime in here?\nThe one I'm most familiar with is https://github.com/larrymyers/react-mini-router, which should work pretty trivially with VelocityTransitionGroup. Just call renderCurrentRoute as a child of VelocityTransitionGroup.\n. Thanks, @mars!\nI'll also add that for stuff like this, where your VelocityTransitionGroup has single elements that are coming and going, you may need to use absolute positioning during the transition to get overlap right. Take a look at the LoadingCrossfadeComponent in the demo source code to see one way of doing this.\n. I think what you want is covered by Velocity, which allows for a start value when tweening:\n<VelocityComponent animation={{top: [0, 100], opacity: [1, 0]}}>\u2026</VelocityComponent>\n(It's a bit counter-intuitive in that the second value in the array is the start, and the first is the end. It also only works for linear tweens AFAIK.)\nMake sure that this is what you want, though. If you're changing animations back and forth, you'll get a smoother effect without fixing the start value.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Ha! Thanks for catching this.\n. Was this in error?\n. Could you provide more details about what you\u2019re trying to do? How does the VelocityTransitionGroupChild get the custom props to begin with?\nI\u2019m not following how you couldn\u2019t put the props on the child elements when you create them as children of VelocityTransitionGroup initially.\n. The reason the child animation is not running is because, to React, the inner VelocityTransitionGroup and its child are appearing  in the DOM together. By default, the animations only run on children that enter/leave an existing TransitionGroup.\nTo get the behavior you want, add runOnMount={true} to the inner VelocityTransitionGroup so that it will animate in this circumstance.\nWhile there\u2019s no cross-element chaining as you see, it should be fairly easy to just add a delay on the inner animations so that they start when you want them to. (This gives you the flexibility to tweak things so that the fade in overlaps with the slide down if it\u2019s appropriate.)\nIt's also possible to use custom UI Pack effects to do chaining in most circumstances (see velocityHelpers.registerEffect) but that likely won\u2019t work in this case because the \u201cslide\u201d effects are custom internal to Velocity in order to get implicit heights right.\nAlso, make sure to have key properties on all children of VelocityTransitionGroup.\nDoes that fix things?\n. Hrm. Digging in, in slow motion, I noticed a few things.\nFirst up, there's a bug in VelocityTransitionGroup where it won\u2019t run any animations unless a leave prop is set. I\u2019ll get a fix for this out later today.\nSecond, it may help to make sure any inner element is block-level. React\u2019s TransitionGroup (and by extension, VelocityTransitionGroup) is a <span> by default. Use component=\"div\" to change this.\nI don\u2019t know if slideDown and delay are going to work well together. slideDown calculates the target height when it\u2019s called. If you\u2019re doing that on an element whose child\u2019s animation is delayed, that child may have display: none and therefore not influence its parent\u2019s height.\nYou could probably work around that by writing a custom animation for the child that doesn\u2019t affect the display and therefore height. (By default all Velocity UI Pack \u201cIn\u201d and \u201cOut\u201d animations mess with display.)\n. For the delayed element, you could do a custom animation that just went from opacity: 0 -> 1. You can put a \"style\" attribute for opacity: 0 on the enter/leave prop that will get set immediately, and then the animation would start after a delay.\nI think the delay is not really the issue as much as the Velocity UI Pack \"In\" transitions always starting from \"display: none\".\nAt any rate, glad you have something, and maybe this gives you ideas for improving it.\n. @kevinrobinson Can you re-approve? Updated CHANGELOG.md for #39.\n. Kevin's hanging out at #TwitterFlight. Selfin'.\n. The \"style\" just gets applied, since it\u2019s done via Velocity / DOM rather than React it's not straightforward to just \"undo\". You can often override it in the animation if that's necessary.\nFor doing a crossfade-like effect, I'd recommend only using \u201cposition: absolute\u201d for the leaving element, leaving the parent to size naturally from any entering element.\n. Makes sense. Thanks for putting this together.\n. Sounds like you don't have the Velocity UI Pack installed. At a top level of your app, include:\njavascript\nrequire('velocity-animate');\nrequire('velocity-animate/velocity.ui');\n. Thanks for bringing this to our attention. I think it would be up to Radium to avoid stomping existing style attributes, but that may not be feasible. (Vanilla React appears to be well more tolerant of this, even with setting style hashes on your elements.)\nIn the immediate term, I'm not sure there's anything we can do, given how Velocity operates completely outside of React and on the DOM directly.\nIf you do any investigation and get a lead on an approach that might resolve the compatibility between the libraries, FF to re-open and let us know what you find.\n. @ianobermiller I'm not familiar with Radium, but Velocity works outside of React and is setting the style values directly on the DOM node, which React typically leaves alone. My guess if there's a problem with Radium it is because Radium is somehow over-writing those, but this is coming from a place of speculation.\n. Thanks for the suggestion. Tweaked the language some and committed in #43.\n. Hrm. Good point. Let me look into this.\n. Does #54 help you with this?\nYou'll still want to wrap your primary require calls in:\nif (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n  \u2026\n}\nand the velocity-react components will use their shim.\n. Lemme get this reviewed and we can get a release up.\n. Fixed in 1.1.2.\n. Take a look at LoadingCrossfadeComponent in the demo code for how to switch an element to absolute as it leaves so that it doesn't take up space.\nPutting a delay on the enter animation may work, but the danger there is additional stuttering of the height. (I suspect it would only be feasible if you can let the container collapse down to 0 height.)\n. I suspect you need:\nimport {VelocityTransitionGroup} from 'velocity-react'\n. The 'velocity-react' model is a convenience that exports the 3 pieces of the library as a hash. The braces destructure that hash to give you access to just the component you want. \n. Are you using Webpack or some other packager that is aware of npm modules?\nYou'll need that for this library.\nOn Wednesday, November 4, 2015, Chris Drackett notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nactually the code I pasted below is causing issues with react, so I don't\ncurrently have a solution :)\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/issues/47#issuecomment-153913032\n.\n.

Latest version has this tip in the README, in case it bites someone else.\n. @lauffenp what's the stack trace on that? Neither velocity-react nor velocity use localeCompare directly.. You may not have been specifying display right. You'l need to do it for each of the animations. E.g.\n\n<VelocityTransitionGroup component='tbody' enter={{ animation: 'slideDown', display: 'table-row' }} leave={{ animation: 'slideUp', display: 'table-row' }}>          \n      {history.map(this.renderRows}}\n    </VelocityTransitionGroup>\nand see if that helps.\n. What URL are you going to in the browser?\n. The leave animation is always finished on an element before the enter animation runs, to try to make sure that enter animations always have a consistent state.\nNot sure either way on having the begin trigger in this case or not. Probably it shouldn't; actually #53 removes that behavior for complete, so perhaps they should be consistent.\nWhat's your use case?\n. Closing. Re-open w/ further information if this is causing problems.\n. There may be some hacks you could do by temporarily changing the enter / leave props when you know filtering is happening. You could also try some nested shenanigans (in other words, make filtering change rows' display or inner contents rather than adding / removing them from the parent element).\n.

OK. Animations start on a next tick so that all the animations for a single VelocityTransitionGroup can be collected and fired together (this makes things like stagger work). Your calculations are probably happening before the animations have started, which may be causing the issue.\n.

After thinking about this a little, I'd recommend trying to subclass\nVelocityTransitionGroup. If you mark your nodes in some manner with whether\nthey should be animated or not (with classes, perhaps?) you can override\nchildWillAppear, childWillEnter, and childWillLeave. Use your own logic to\nshort-circuit out of those functions (just call the doneFn and return) and\nonly call the \"super\" implementations when you want animation to happen.\n\nYou could also put together a PR to allow the wrapper component class,\ncurrently VelocityTransitionGroupChild, to be parameterized as a prop to\nVelocityTransitionGroup. Then you could implement the logic in your custom\nchild's componentWillAppear / componentWillEnter / componentWillLeave\n(calling the willAppearFunc / willEnterFunc / willLeaveFunc props as\nnecessary).\nI think the latter's nicer because I prefer composition over inheritance\nfor customization (esp. given the state of JS \"classes\"), but the former\nyou could get started on right away.\nOn Tue, Dec 8, 2015 at 11:08 PM, Richard Lopes notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHello,\nHaving great success with the library so far.\nHowever I got a new requirement causing me some grief to achieve.\nI have 2 pages:\n- a list of items (that you can sort and filter)\n- a form to create new items\nI have 2 API endpoints:\n- one gets the original list of items\n- one returns new items that have been added by other users\nThis is how it works:\n1. when the list of items first load, items are rendered without animation\n2. when you filter or sort the list, items are rendered without animation\n3. when the second API notify new items have been added, those are\nrendered in the list with animation\n4. when an item is deleted, it gets removed with an animation\n5. when a user leave the list page to create an item on the second page,\nhe is redirected back to the list page after creation, the new item only\nmust be rendered with animation\nAt the moment I achieve 1 to 4 but I am having problems with 5 (5 leaves\nthe list page then come back, unmount/mount items).

A compatible implementation would probably output HTML for the components that reflected the end state of specified animations.\n. That line is in there because, due to React's TransitionGroup's API, we\nhave no way of getting all of the children that are entering or leaving\nother than collecting them and waiting a tick to know that the collection\nis complete. We want to batch all of the child animations in one go in\norder to support Velocity options like stagger.\nWithout that display: none or an alternate means of hiding, elements would\nflash in for that tick before the animation started.\nI could imagine a position: absolute / opacity: 0 combo, or height: 0, or\nsomething else that would keep the element from appearing.

Sorry for the confusion. You're the second person who brought it up, so I re-worked to match the sentiment I was going for in #67.\n. I haven't tried it, but it's likely to work, since velocity-react just calls Velocity on child DOM nodes.\n\nYou may or may not want runOnMount to be true, depending upon how you want the \u201canimation\u201d\u00a0to be triggered.\n. You'll want to add a ref to the component so you can access it, and call runAnimation on it when you want it to fire off.\n. Try translateX as the key to the style block. velocity-react uses Velocity's style setting for consistency, not React's.\n. You\u2019ll need the component to stay in the DOM for the duration of the animation for the effect to appear. Two options come to mind:\n- Keep using VelocityComponent, rendered all of the time, but use Velocity\u2019s display property (not in animation, but as its own prop) to get the element to display block/none at the beginning/end of the animation as necessary.\n- Use VelocityTransitionGroup and have the white overlay as a child that\u2019s added/removed from it. VelocityTransitionGroup will keep the child in the DOM while the animation runs, even if you\u2019re no longer rendering it, and remove it when the animation is over.\n. Cool, thanks for sending this in!\n. Double-check that all versions of Velocity you have installed are 1.2.3? (Perhaps with npm dedupe as well.)\n. I think the problem is the <div> around your OrdersList and the OrdersList itself. ReactTransitionGroup \u2014 and therefore VelocityTransitionGroup \u2014 operates only on direct children.

That will let you inspect the DOM as it's moving.\n\nMy guess on this is that the animation is playing, but since you have 2 elements in the container, one is either covering the other or, more likely, bumping it down so that it can't be seen.\nYou may want to look over the sample code for the crossfade animation, which shows switching a leaving element over to position: absolute so that both elements can coexist on screen.\n. This is currently by design because the leave animation is run to completion before an element is added, so that elements can base their enter animations off of a consistent \u201cleft\u201d state.\nI think I\u2019d be open to a patch that would not run either of the \u201cleave\u201d callbacks in this case, however.\n.

Thanks for using velocity-react!\nOn Tue, Apr 12, 2016 at 4:50 PM, Lior Brauer notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@finneganh https://github.com/finneganh Thanks for the reply. I assumed\nwithout looking that the version bump on your part explicitly depended on\nReact 15, but I see you're correct. I'll look into shrinkwrap and perhaps a\nnewer version of NPM that doesn't automatically install peerDependencies.\nAgain, thanks for your help and contribution!\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/issues/94#issuecomment-209096599\n. You may need to specify react-addons-transition-group at 0.14.x in your dependencies.\n\nSorry for the headaches around this; for some reason this React upgrade isn't going as smoothly as 0.13 -> 0.14.\nI think one lesson is to always make sure you're shrinkwrapping your dependencies so this doesn't bite arbitrarily.\n. For debugging stuff like this, I usually recommend slowing the animation down to 30s or so you have enough time to look in the web inspector to see how styles are cascading or conflicting.\nThis may be an issue you'd need to address with Velocity to allow for animation styles that override !important CSS.\n. I haven\u2019t looked closely at that, as I'm not sure how it would fit in with the declarative approach to animations. Feel free to discuss if you have a feeling of how it would integrate.\n. Ha! Awesome. Thanks for catching.\n. Thanks!\n. Sorry the documentation isn't very clear about this. I think the intent was to describe that you can use the targetQuerySelector prop to add the animation to multiple elements, which in this case are not strictly children but grandchildren or below.\n. Let me see if I can convey that better.\n. FWIW VelocityComponent requires a single child because it doesn't have a DOM wrapper element of its own.\n. Use VelocityTransitionGroup when you want the behavior of a React TransitionGroup (animations on elements entering / leaving the DOM). Docs here: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/animation.html\nUse VelocityComponent otherwise.\n. It comes down to if you're animating an element in place, vs. if you need\nto animate a component as it enters or leaves the DOM. If you check the\ndemos, the three on the left are VelocityComponent whereas the two on the\nright are VelocityTransitionGroup.\nOn Thu, Jun 16, 2016 at 10:50 AM, Jeff Hansen notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nI guess my question is, for a new animation, why would I want to chose\none over the other?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/issues/103#issuecomment-226508756,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/AAP65bKIWGWoXdYZxTYCx7eN7PeNPvPyks5qMWK_gaJpZM4I3XFi\n.\n. If you're having the CSS animations just on elements so that they animate\nwhen they appear in the DOM, then probably VelocityTransitionGroup will\nmatch the behavior you expect. If you've been dynamically adding\nanimation-specific classes to elements based on some triggering event, then\nuse VelocityComponent.\n\nYou can do multi-step animations in Velocity, which you might be used to\nwith keyframes, by using registerEffect and specifying a series of\ncalls. (This is for cases where straightforward tweening between two\nvalues is not enough.) Look at Velocity's documentation for\nRegisterEffect, though velocity-react also has a helper for it that\nprevents naming collisions.\nOn Thu, Jun 16, 2016 at 10:58 AM, Jeff Hansen notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nAh, okay, thanks! Basically right now I am using CSS transition groups\nbecause the keyframes are easy to work with in CSS.

Put them in the hashes alongside animation.\n. Curious. I wonder if this is a permanent change or a webhost mixup. At any rate, we can revert later if necessary.\n. Thanks!\n. I think you'll need to investigate what isn't smooth about the current effect. There a lot of processing going on when the routes change, or just components resizing when they get new data and that throwing off the animation.\n\nI believe you could add a complete callback to the VelocityTransitionGroup's enter or leave animations that will get called when the effect is done. That may help, though there might be some bookkeeping to translate that to a specific component.\n. I'm not necessarily against this, but I want to make sure it's doing what you intend.\nWhen the duration changes, the animation will restart from the current DOM state, without memory of any previous animation or duration. So, if the box is halfway across the screen and you half the duration, the new animation will actually proceed at the same rate, as it has only half the distance to go.\nIs the effect you want better expressed through a custom tween or multi-step animation?\n. Closing this without a compelling use-case. I don't think duration changes are conceptually the right fit for the declarative way velocity-react works, due to the non-intuitive way they work with any in-progress animations.\n. Curious. The slideUp/slideDown animations are handled a little bit specially by Velocity; I don't know if that affects the way that the complete callback is called.\nLooking at where the error might happen in ReactTransitionGroup, it's something around the doneFn callback being called but the child element it was originally bound to is no longer present. Might be worth checking to see if somehow slideUp is calling its complete handler twice or something.\nI think that removeAll may be aggravating this because that example as originally written was being sloppy about keys. They've been based on array position, rather than something more intrinsic. That may have masked this bug because the doneFn lookup by key that happens in ReactTransitionGroup would have succeeded accidentally if the key were re-used.\n. Cool. This seems reasonable. I think this also safe server-side since componentWillUnmount isn't called then.\nHeads up, @kenwheeler, it might be nicer to have a Velocity helper for clearing this data rather than duplicating the ['velocity', 'fxqueue'] keys in this code.\n. I'd like to merge this, I just need to validate that it's also fine when jQuery is installed.\n. Demo still seems to work with this, so I think it's safe.\n. Would it work for you to include a complete callback and then call the runAnimation method on the component manually to cause a loop?\nDoes RunSequence have support for looping in a way that's different from calling $.velocity?\n. @tonybaroneee FF to send to me. I've been on vacation but I need to get back to maintaining this project.\n. The \"reverse\" value for an animation is not a great fit for VelocityTransitionGroup because elements may need to animate out without having been animated in. (See: http://velocityjs.org/#reverse Reverse just undoes the most recent animation on an element)\nIt's best to make an opposite animation.\n. Since you want your animation to be affected by the derivative of your state, rather than the state itself, I'd recommend calling the runAnimation method on a VelocityComponent in your componentDidUpdate method on detecting that the current value is different from the previous value (which are passed to componentDidUpdate).\n. Are you using VelocityComponent or VelocityTransitionGroup? \n. Added a review to that PR. I know it's been a little while. LMK if you want to update the PR or I can take over the fix.\n. Just merged. Will be in the next release.\n. I've been looking into this a little more. In my tests, loading the demo with jsdom worked. I couldn't reproduce the require error.\nI'm not sure there's a particular reason why velocity-react shouldn't work with jsdom around, and I wonder if the require error you have is from something else. Leaving the jsdom exclusion in for now, but that might get revisited if it comes up as a feature request from someone else.\n. What's your version of lodash?\nI'm hesitant to do this because the original intention of those requires is to only pull in the specific functions so as not to bloat the imports with all of object, array, &c. since tree-shaking is not widely available for JS importing.\n. This package is still using lodash 3. There may be something up with your npm importing if it's finding a different version.\n. Awesome. Thanks!\n. Really? OK. Disappointing that they're parsing code with RegExps, but it's no big deal to change this on our end.\n. You should be able to use the VelocityHelper to register a multi-step\nanimation that goes to 20 and then back to 10.\nOn Wednesday, September 7, 2016, angus croll notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nHere's my use case:\n\n\n\nFor each animation loop, MyComponent's width should start at 10, grow to\n20 at the half way point, then ease back to 10. I don't think I can use the\nanimation property for this (since start and end values are 10).\nThe progress property supplies the complete value to the associated\ncallback, which I could potentially use to update width via something like:\nprogress={(el, complete) => {width: 20 - (Math.abs(complete - 0.5)*20)}}\nHowever I'm not sure how (or whether) I can update a style property via\nthis callback.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/issues/124, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAP65Z94cRwLTrk0BJDuBau-SPYCRG6Sks5qn1DogaJpZM4J3esc\n.\n. You should be able to modify the easing w/ additional arguments. Unfortunately the registerEffect bits are not well-documented in Velocity. You can also set the initial width I think with:\n\n[{\n  width: [20, 10],\n  left: \u2026\n}, \u2026]\nI believe that you cannot loop registerEffect animations, but you could add a complete handler to the component and have that call runAnimation.\n. This seems to be an NPM / Treebeard issue. Treebeard's dev dependencies specify React 0.14.8, but the NPM I have (2.7.5) is installing a React for velocity-react's peerDependency, even though 0.14.8 should satisfy the ||.\nIn your own app, lock React down at 15.something and I expect you won't have warnings.\nI'm not sure if npm 3 would handle this case better.\n. Looks like this is an issue with the new garbage collection, as it uses a Velocity API that's not shimmed out in server / test mode. Will get a new release out presently.\n. Should be fixed in 1.1.7.\n. Fixed in 1.1.8. Thanks @stephenleicht for the fix.\n. Thanks!\n. Selfie since this is breaking IE compat.\n.

Where is resolve.modules being set? Is there a reason it doesn\u2019t include the default \"node_modules\"?. What's the ordering in resolve.modules? is \"node_modules\" first?\n\n. @STRML In that case I would recommend following the example here: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-modules\nand using __dirname, as relative paths in resolve.modules are treated differently from absolute paths.. The reason is that I'm not interested spending my time testing and doing a release to work around others' non-standard module resolution rules. velocity-react's use of lodash 3 is entirely within spec. . Right, I didn't mean to imply that it's just you who's having module resolution problems since, as you saw from the other responses to this issue, it's not just you. I get frustrated that every few months I have to respond to folks whose setups can't handle a very straightforward relative node_modules include which is why, TBH, I'm acting a little bitchy about this.\nIn general I don't update modules just for kicks. For utility stuff like this, I'd rather stick with something that I know works than chase updates.\nThe only argument interesting to me is file size, except that even that's predicated on more folks using 4 than 3 in production, and the site that this library was built for originally is still on 3.. I'd recommend checking and seeing what's installed under\nvelocity-react/node_modules and poking in your lock file to see what it\nsays about lodash. Sounds more like your modules are not installed\ncorrectly rather than a webpack config aliasing lodash or using a\nnon-standard module resolver.\nOn Sun, Nov 5, 2017 at 3:00 PM, Vincent Lecrubier notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nJust coming here to say that I got the same bug, caused by this dependency\non lodash 3.

Aha, interesting. Good find. I can probably figure out how to work around that in how VelocityTransitionGroup generates its complete function.\n. Yeah, you'd need to do something tricky to handle the class coming in later, which would be dependent upon whatever you're using to do lazy loading.. I believe the stagger option has to be passed in the enter/exit props as that\u2019s how it gets passed to the Velocity options argument.\n. See the \"On Demand\" section of the demo. You'll want to call runAnimation on the component after you detect the increment. See the \"Interruption Behavior\" options for ways to handle when the animation calls overlap.\n. Can you be clearer about what you're doing and what error you're seeing?. I think this will be fixed in the next release, which fixed the undefined forEach problem.. I'd recommend not doing the queue stuff but instead change all the properties in one call. There is a somewhat undocumented way you can specify per-property easing with registerEffect, which you can see an example of here: https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/blob/master/velocity.ui.js#L541. Sounds like you need to check your dependencies, and possibly re-build your node_modules directory.. You need runOnMount={true}. Thanks for the fix!. If you use registerAnimation you can make an animation with sequential\nsteps. The syntax of nested arrays is a bit tricky, so check the Velocity\ndocs for how to do it.\nOn Thu, Dec 15, 2016 at 3:39 AM Martin notifications@github.com wrote:\nIs there a way to queue up multiple animations like vanilla Velocity does\nwith calling it multiple times or chaining the promises?\nI'd like to transform my css animation that is a multistep keyframe\nanimation to a component and run this on mount.\n@keyframes dash {\n0%{\nstroke-dasharray: 1,200;\n\nstroke-dashoffset: 0;\n\n}\n50%{\nstroke-dasharray: 89,200;\n\nstroke-dashoffset: -35;\n\n}\n100%{\nstroke-dasharray: 89,200;\n\nstroke-dashoffset: -124;\n\n}\n}\nWith Velocity i would just call it 3 times on the DOM object and give the\nlast animation loop: true so that it runs infinitely.

Not sure. I guess I'd try to avoid setting a resolveLoader at all, but you'd know better what led you to using it.. VelocityTransitionGroup will run its animation when its child unmounts.

Right, hidden components will still take up space.\nI'd recommend using VelocityTransitionGroup. That will let you run an animation when the component is unmounted. Just change your logic to no longer render the component, and the library will animate it away.. Check your node_modules (perhaps by deleting them and doing a clean npm install).

It should be the case that you want the animation prop to be \"scroll\", then pass the duration and easing as props to VelocityComponent.\n\nFrom the VelocityComponent docs: \u201cUnrecognized properties are passed as options to Velocity (e.g. duration, delay, loop).\u201d. Does leaving off the loop param change anything?. You\u2019ll need to make sure that you\u2019re using Velocity 1.2.3 or later. I'm not sure how materialize is bringing it in, I couldn't obviously see from their code. You could poke around in Velocity to see how it attaches to window; I\u2019m not sure if requiring a later Velocity would overwrite the earlier one globally.. Are you importing Velocity directly? The library should avoid this issue for itself through lib/velocity-animate-shim.js. Maybe look in there and see if you can tell why it's trying to do the real import server-side. . Only import velocity and velocity.ui in your client code\u2019s entry point. Use velocity-react elsewhere in your components and it should avoid loading velocity on the server.. Looking at your code, I get the impression that on delete you\u2019re removing the VelocityTransitionGroup as well. You\u2019ll need to keep it around.\nTransitionGroups are able to run for their children that leave the DOM, but if they themselves are removed then they\u2019re just gone.. I can\u2019t quite tell from your code. What are you seeing and what are you expecting?\nVelocityTransitionGroup is for when you have direct children entering and leaving the DOM, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with GalleryManager, at least in the code that you\u2019ve provided.. If all the elements are added to the VelocityTransitionGroup at once then you don\u2019t need targetQuerySelector, just stagger.\nThis is shown in the \u201cAdd 5 Rows\u201d part of the demo: https://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/blob/master/demo/examples/scrolling-group.jsx\nAlso note that targetQuerySelector is only for VelocityComponent, not VelocityTransitionGroup.. I can\u2019t reproduce this this morning, with npm or yarn. Are you still seeing the issue?. React is reconciling that to be the same <Image> component. Use a different key to force React to treat the Image as distinct.. Error message seems to indicate you have something else running at port 8080 on that machine.. You can see in the demo code how to use registerEffect to define animations in your own codebase.. It sounds like multiple React versions on the page so certainly double-check that in your node_modules. Other than that I\u2019m not sure.\nvelocity-react doesn\u2019t use refs itself, though ReactTransitionGroup does.. What does the code look like?. I suspect that the issue is the VelocityTransitionGroup is being removed from the DOM while the transition around the Image is still going on.\nYou should in general have your VelocityTransitionGroups be stable on the page, and only their contents appear and disappear.. You'll need to do your own window detection around a require for velocity.ui.\n. You may be able to start the tab with display: none, and I believe that Velocity may show it automatically.. You could give it a try but you'll probably have to do some digging yourself to see how the tabs are interacting with velocity.. The velocity animations don't run at all on the server. You'll want to display:none the element yourself and let velocity show it on the client.. Velocity doesn't have a slideLeft built in. The UI pack has transition.slideLeftIn and transition.slideLeftOut as preregistered effects, however.\nhttp://velocityjs.org/#uiPack. Thanks for the heads up. Will I think also move\nto reactjs/react-transition-group in the next release.\nOn Tue, Apr 11, 2017 at 2:04 AM, Zebra Flesh notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nUsing VelocityTransitionGroup with react 15.5 generates the following\ndeprecation notice:\nWarning: Accessing PropTypes via the main React package is deprecated.

This is likely a consequence of VelocityComponent using stop when switching animations. You could add a config property to change that to finish or allow it to queue, the way that the runAnimation method takes options.\n\nSee the demo for how these behaviors differ when calling runAnimation.. The same sort of configuration that is used in runAnimation could be\nadded to the props for VelocityComponent, if you're interested in sending\nin a PR.

Happy to consider a pull request.. Fixed in v1.3.0. Thanks for your patience!. FF to open a pull request!. Yeah, this is a bit complicated because slideDown / slideUp are custom animations in Velocity (in order to handle the height issue) so they can't be easily composed with the CSS animations.\n\nI think what you have is reasonable. . Awesome, thanks!!!. Cool. I should be able to push this out tomorrow. I wonder how many folks are on pre-15.. I'll do a patch release. I admit to not being overly pedantic about semver and dependencies.. Especially since the only reason to upgrade is to support more recent versions of React.. You're not forced to upgrade velocity-react. That being said, I think anyone developing apps without using a dependency lock file is asking for trouble already.. Thanks for having my back on the peer dependencies. It's clearly something I should have paid more attention to. Yay, open source!. Thanks for the fix!. This means you can do:\n<VelocityComponent animation=\"transition.slideLeftIn\" duration={500} delay={1000} />\n\u201cunrecognized\u201d in this case means props that aren\u2019t handled directly by VelocityComponent.. Eeep. Good catch. Thanks!. Fixed in v1.3.3. You can chain animations using UI pack and VelocityHelpers.registerEffect. The API syntax is a little wonky, just pass additional elements in the calls array property when you register the animation. Velocity will run the first animation, then run the second. That will let you chain the two translates without any explicit effort on your part.. Here\u2019s an example of registerEffect with a single call: \nhttps://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/blob/master/demo/examples/flap-box.jsx#L18\nadd more to the calls array to chain effects.. You should define the two animations outside of your render method, one for collapse and one for not-collapsed, and then use this.props.collapse to choose which one to pass as animation.. I'm open to PRs, but won't implement this personally.\nNote that most of the typing would actually come from Velocity.js, since these components pass through many of the props.. Thanks for putting this together. I'll try and take a look and see about getting it in. I use Flow rather than TypeScript in my own projects, so I'd have to get familiar with it first.. What effect are you trying to achieve?. That would be tricky. Calling Velocity.stop on the animated elements would stop them from animating. But, it would also cause the TransitionGroup to keep them around because stop keeps the complete callback from firing, which is how VelocityTransitionGroup can tell TransitionGroup to finally remove the element.\nYou might have better luck wrapping each image in a <VelocityComponent>, which can have its animation stopped (by setting its animation prop to null).. Is the issue here w/ velocity-react > 1.1.4 or react-transition-group >= 1.2.0?. runAnimation can be called externally with a config. See the demo.. I suppose it could, but consolidating that isn't a huge priority.. I think that this question is outside the scope of velocity-react issues.. Pretty sure that this wouldn't solve any bundle size issues as now the 4.x lodash modules may be coming from different places. \nI maintain that in a correctly-functioning build setup the current use of lodash 3 should not cause a problem. . For starters, just call registerEffect at the top of the file, not each time through render. \nYour calls property needs an extra set of []s. Yes, it\u2019s odd, but that's how Velocity.RegisterEffect wants it. See the comment at the top of the velocity-helpers.js file.. Any reason why you think that this is important? The v1 branch is still being maintained. . Yeah, that's the big question. If not, I'll work on getting this upgraded,\nsince I want to use 16, too, but working through any timing changes with\nthe new version RTG implementation will likely be a pain.\nOn Sat, Sep 16, 2017 at 6:22 AM Luke Page notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nOk, sorry I didn't realize that.. if v1 will support react 16 it's not\nimportant to me.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react/issues/224#issuecomment-329959910,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAP65TJdCsMsPkTFTCROnN_NM5puiRHZks5si6FMgaJpZM4PZxWq\n.\n.

Have you noticed any issues at 1.2? I know at least someone else on here downgraded back to 1.1. . \n. Not sure quite what effect you\u2019re going for, but using VelocityTransitionGroup to switch between two views is just going to be tricky. During transition, you\u2019ll likely have both views appearing, messing up the parent height. \n\nGood luck in debugging. I tend to slow the animations way down to see what\u2019s going on in detail. \nI have done a cross fade in the past, between two views of the same height. The trick is to set the leaving one to position absolute so it can exist in the same space as the entering one. . Thanks! I hadn't realized that they changed the org.. Not something I\u2019m interested in right now. If this package ever needs a large overhaul (like switching to the 2.0 API for react-transition-group) I\u2019d probably tackle other dependency updates at that point. . Your problem likely lies elsewhere.

Instead,  nest a <div> to hold the Radium styles.\nFor example, replace this component's root element style:\njavascript\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>\n      <h1>{'Pure awesome'}</h1>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\u2026with a nested structure:\njavascript\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>\n        <h1>{'Pure awesome'}</h1>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\nAny styles required on that root <div/> should be managed from the parent Velocity* component, using the style prop & forcefeeding.\n.

Thank you for implementing support with the complete callback.\nJust to follow up, it appears the reset property of Velocity.RegisterEffect is working within velocity-react. It turns out my issue is that Velocity does not accept non-integer values.\n. I ran into this same issue. The way I resolved it was adding velocity-animate as an explicit dependency of my app. I'm not sure if this was the intended/best approach, but I am now able to require the two velocity-animate packages like so:\nFirst:\nnpm i -S velocity-animate\nThen:\njavascript\nimport 'velocity-animate'\nimport 'velocity-animate/velocity.ui'\nimport { VelocityTransitionGroup, velocityHelpers } from 'velocity-react'\n. @finneganh I thought about this some more. Should velocity-animated be added as a peerDependency for this package?\n. I realize now that a parent project has to directly require velocity-animate only if you desire \"to use the Velocity UI Pack\" (from the README).
