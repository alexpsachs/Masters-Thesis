    "fornwall": "Thanks! I think a separate app (\"Termux Offline Installer\"), which would bundle and install the base package itself would work, right?\n. One thing that has been improved since the creation of this issue is that the bootstrap zip is downloaded from a content distribution network, which should give increased performance across the globe. It won't help no or limited internet access much is the limitation is locally.\nI will unfortunately have to close this issue for now - not enough time to fix something like this. This doesn't mean that this will never happen, or that a contribution would not be welcome, just that this is not tracked as a current issue for now.\n. > Tor users cannot access termux.net at the moment\nDo you know why? Is it because of cloudflare blocking it or inserting a captcha?\nI've just reconfigured cloudflare settings to whitelist Tor exit nodes, so could you try again and see if that works better?. @xloem Great that it works with Tor now!\n\nStill, would you accept the pull request if I improved it such that it checked for a local asset, and then performed the normal download if the local asset were not present?\n\nA local asset under /sdcard? . Hi, thanks for the feedback!\nSince the terminal emulation of Termux comes from the Android Terminal Emulator project, these shortcuts should already work (let me know if you have any problem with them)!\nThey are documented at http://termux.com/help/#touch_keyboard which is also available by long pressing on the terminal and choosing the Help context menu entry!\n. Thanks, I think that makes sense!\nSo would a -p,--password option which would set the input type to password work?\n. @dezifit I've added the following options:\n- -m, --multiple-lines \u2192 Use input with multiple lines (single line being the new default)\n- -p, --password \u2192 Enter the input as a password\n- -t, --title <title> \u2192 The title to show for the input prompt\nLet me know if there are any problems!\nYou have to apt update && apt upgrade to get the updated termux-api package (version 0.9), as well as wait for the corresponding 0.5 update of the Termux:API app to be installed from the Play Store as an update (it should be available in a couple of hours max).\n. The reason why armeabi and mips are not built in the app is that the packages (https://github.com/termux/termux-packages) are only available for armeabi-v7a and x86, so to avoid people installing the app without any available packages the app is only built for the architectures where packages are available.\nIt would require some porting and testing to make the packages available for mips, which will only get done if there is enough demand or if someone is interested in doing the work.\nAs for armeabi, I don't know if there is any Android 5 or later (the Android version Termux requires) ARM device not supporting armeabi-v7a?\n. The minsdk is also due to the packages - Android made some rather large changes to the system libc in Android 5.0, so maintaining compatibility with both Android 5.0+ and previous versions at the same time means a lot of work and time for these kind of packages (possibly forcing building and hosting two separate apt repositories)..\n. Hi, thanks for reporting!\nI don't have a Cyanogenmod device available at the moment. In order to help diagnose the issue, can you check if the volume buttons work as shortcuts in TEA (check that settings says that Control key is Vol Down Key):\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm\n. Ok, thanks for the information, and great that it works for you now!\n. Hi, Termux is only available on Android 5.0 or later indeed.\nThe app itself could be ported to run on previous Android versions, but porting the collection of packages are a considerable larger task, since Android broke compatibility of the system libc in Android 5.\nWould the app itself (without many packages) be interesting in itself for older versions, running just as a terminal emulator?\n. Yes, a question is if people are interested in running Termux just as a terminal emulator without packages (which could then be made to run on previous Android versions, and more cpu arches such as mips). Or if it's not much point in making a \"Termux Terminal\" without packages...\n. I'm sorry for it, but I think the honest thing to do here is to close the issue, as a version of Termux for Android versions older than 5.0 is just not going to happen.\nTermux packages (as opposed to the app) are intimately coupled to details of the system libc, linker and kernel, in a way that makes it hard to support older version at the same time as newer ones in a robust way. Sorry for those affected - for devices stuck on older android versions, you may try out ZShaolin or Terminal-IDE as alternatives.. @nico202 Thanks for the offer, but I'm not planning to setup donations at the moment! Buy the add-ons as @jarrettgilliam says if you like them, or perhaps donate to a worthwhile charity :).\n. Hi, pyconfig.h can be installed from the python2-dev package! Does installing lxml work for you after that?\n. I reproduced the problem:\n```\nIn file included from src/lxml/lxml.etree.c:239:0:\n/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/tmp/pip-build-Vw5Hjr/lxml/src/lxml/includes/etree_defs.h:14:31: fatal error: libxml/xmlversion.h: No such file or directory\ninclude \"libxml/xmlversion.h\"\n```\nThe file $PREFIX/include/libxml2/libxml/xmlversion.h exists after installing libxml2-dev, but is not found since -I$PREFIX/include/libxml2 is not used when compiling for some reason...\n. Hi, the issue was that the libxml2-dev package lacked the xml2-config utility which lxml needs to build.\nThis has now been fixed, run apt update && apt upgrade and try to install lxml again.\nRe-open the issue if it still doesn't work for you!\n. @Jim-Zenn Have you installed libxml2-dev with apt install libxml2-dev?. Thanks for the suggestion! Will look into trying a cross compile soon, for future reference when looking into this:\n- Mono on ARM information\n- Stackoverflow post about cross compiling to Android ARM\n- Stackoverflow post about cross compiling to Android x86\n. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#40\n. Thanks, I clarified that Terminal Emulator for Android (https://github.com/jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator) uses Apache License 2.0 now!\n. Merged, thanks!\n. Thanks for the suggestion! There will probably be some kind of optional overlay on the keyboard with additional keys (arrow keys, ctrl/alt/etc, perhaps configurable) like there is in ConnectBot and JuiceSSH in the future! Leaving this issue open to track that.\n. There will probably be something like the JuiceSSH overlay keyboard added soon!\n\n. @franciscod Yes - the plan is to make the overlay keyboard optional - I like the volume key solution too on my phone :).\n. @toXel Yes - the plan is to make it configurable shortly!\n. Hi, sorry for not responding sooner here!\nEmacs is a bit broken at the moment regretfully - you can subscribe to https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/11 to see more information and get notifications about progress!\n. @iexos It's a nice idea, will think about it! Perhaps something like executing the file $HOME/.termux/boot if it exists at boot (so you can do anything you want there, like starting sshd)?\n@jarrettgilliam There is crontab and crond available from busybox, which is pre-installed in Termux. Though you have to start crond for it to work (which you could then do with the above start-at-boot solution).\n. You can close the session by pressing return when the Process completed message is shown - if this was the last active session, the app will quit. It's also possible to quit by pinch-expanding the Termux notification which shows an \"EXIT\" action on it.\nI agree that it's not clear enough how to exit. Perhaps appending - press Enter to quit to the Process completed message could be a solution?\n. @jarrettgilliam The drawback with automatically closing the session is that the terminal can sometimes contain information that you do not want to miss, if you accidentally closed the session or something crashed.\nI'm leaning on trying out - press Enter to close in the next update and see how it's received!\n. The - press Enter to close message will be in the next release (version 0.20) - thanks for the feedback!\n. The back button is now mapped to sending the Escape key.\nTo close the keyboard for apps such as htop/vim, you may pull out the menu from the left and press the KEYBOARD button (see attached screenshot).\n\nIt's a bit clunky, but the reasoning for the current behaviour is that the cases you really want to hide the keyboard are rare, especially compared to how often you want to press escape.\n. Thanks for the feedback!\nDo you think bold-as-bright needs to be an option (as opposed to always doing it)?\n. More information: https://github.com/altercation/solarized/issues/90\n. Displaying bold text in bright colours was fixed in 36cc010a87c1cbc96f504540f1418c3c5fde96e5, which will be available in an updated version 0.20 in Google Play in a couple of hours max.\nIt was made non-optional for now, let's see if anything motivates making this optional later. Thanks for reporting the issue!\n. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#59\n. Which keyboard do you use? The stock keyboard on the LG G4?\n. I wil debug it as soon as I have access to an LG device.\nIn the meantime, you could try using an alternate keyboard such as SwiftKey or Swype!\n. Unless you have root you can't write to all locations on external SD cards. You should however be able to write to the folder Android/data/com.termux/ on it (which is the Android 5 permission model as you say)!\n. See Internal and external storage - it's possible to at least create a folder on the external SD card now ($HOME/storage/external) where Termux can write.\n. Hi, see CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE under common problems and re-open this issue if the problem still remains (or you think the linked information can be made clearer)!\n. Great that it works for you now!\nI'm experimenting with a wiki/help page system now, will link to it soon to make it discoverable!\n. The root cause is that the python2 package is compiled without os.link support, since hard links are not supported on Android (starting in Android version 6). This causes the line oslink = os.link to fail with the above exception.\n- Adding back os.link (as a method which would would not work on Android 6) would unfortunately cause pip to break, see https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/29.\n- If mercurial was changed to work without os.link (at least on Android) that would be great, but probably not very likely to be accepted by the mercurial project.\nDoes changing the line oslink = os.link to something like oslink = os.symlink in $PREFIX/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mercurial/posix.py cause mercurial to run (with basic functionality such as cloning and pushing working)?\n. Great work reporting it to mercurial! I'll look into how much work it would be to package mercurial with this patch (otherwise I'll add a note about the manual patching steps needed when installing from pip in an upcoming collection of help pages)!\n. A reference for the removed hard link support in Android 6 is https://code.google.com/p/android-developer-preview/issues/detail?id=3150\n. @durin42 Yes, let's forget I ever mentioned symlinks as fallbacks :).\nGreat, let us know here if you want us to help testing a patch (and perhaps write down instructions/steps for anything special to be tested)!\nIf you want to test anything yourself, install the Termux app, and then install required packages by executing\napt install python2-dev gcc\nYou should now be able to install mercurial with\npip2 install mercurial\n. @durin42 Nice work! I built mercurial with make local and verified that basic cloning, pushing, committing, pulling and pushing works.\nDo you have an estimate for which version this would be available in mercurial (and when)?\n. Ok, interested people can apply https://selenic.com/repo/hg/rev/b0d90fef16b6 to $PREFIX/python2.7/site-packages/mercurial/posix.py after installing mercurial through pip in the meantime.\nThanks for the help!\n. @Yajo That's great! Didn't know that you could point pip to the zip file directly.\n. Hi, I just made a fix for the ranger package, could you update to the latest version (execute apt update && apt upgrade) and see if the problem remains?\nIf the problem remains, could you write the output of running uname -a and find $PREFIX -name ranger here, as well as write which Android version and device you are running on?\n. In the 0.23 update of Termux now available it's possible to configure the bell character behaviour - see https://termux.com/configuration.html.\n. There will probably be an overlay keyboard with additional keys (Ctrl/Alt/Arrows/etc) added soon - you can track the issue https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/12 for that!\n. Termux requires Android 5.0 or later versions, and and arm or intel cpu. Does this explain why it's not available (is the device running an earlier Android version)?\n. Nice! Unfortunately the Pixel C is not available here (sweden) yet, so I haven't tried it out!\n\nIf I press the ...+1 key that maps to escape I also get the extended-keys soft-keyboard\n\nWith 'get the extended-keys soft-keyboard', do you mean that the soft keyboard pops up in addition to the escape key being sent?\n. @gscholt Could you use the app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.keywatcher and press ...+1 (which I understand should result in just the Escape key being executed by Termux, and nothing more, right?) and attach the output here (or mail it to me)?\n. From KeyEvent.java:\n```\npublic static final int KEYCODE_ALT_RIGHT       = 58;\npublic static final int KEYCODE_ESCAPE          = 111;\npublic static final int ACTION_DOWN             = 0;\npublic static final int ACTION_UP               = 1;\npublic static final int META_ALT_ON = 0x02;\npublic static final int META_ALT_RIGHT_ON = 0x20;\n```\nSo the sequence for ...+1:\n(1) Key Code: 58, Action: 0, Meta State: 34\n(2) Key Code: 111, Action: 0, Meta State: 0\n(3) Key Code: 111, Action: 1, Meta State: 0\n(4) Key Code: 58, Action: 1, Meta State: 0\nwould mean (since 34=0x02 + 0x20):\n(1) AltRight down, meta=ALT_ON |\u00a0ALT_RIGHT_ON\n(2) Escape down\n(3) Escape up\n(4) AltRight up\nThe special thing that Termux in TerminalView.java does is to catch the Escape key in onKeyPreIme(), in order to prevent the escape key being treated as back:\n@Override\npublic boolean onKeyPreIme(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {\n    if (LOG_KEY_EVENTS) Log.i(EmulatorDebug.LOG_TAG, \"onKeyPreIme(keyCode=\" + keyCode + \", event=\" + event + \")\");\n    if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_ESCAPE || (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_BACK && mOnKeyListener.shouldBackButtonBeMappedToEscape())) {\n        // Handle the escape key ourselves to avoid the system from treating it as back key\n        // and e.g. close keyboard.\n        switch (event.getAction()) {\n        case KeyEvent.ACTION_DOWN:\n            return onKeyDown(keyCode, event);\n        case KeyEvent.ACTION_UP:\n            return onKeyUp(keyCode, event);\n        }\n    }\n    return super.onKeyPreIme(keyCode, event);\n}\nThis would return true since onKeyDown() and onKeyUp() returns true unless event.isSystem(), which is not the case here.\nSo if the above flow does not miss anything, it would mean that the problem is due to onKeyPreIme() returning true for the Escape down/up events.\n. > So if the above flow does not miss anything, it would mean that the problem is due to onKeyPreIme() returning true for the Escape down/up events.\nWhich could perhaps make sense - by eating the key event before the IME sees it, the IME would be left with only seeing the two events:\n(1) AltRight down, meta=ALT_ON | ALT_RIGHT_ON\n(4) AltRight up\nwhich would be the same as just pressing the ... key. @gscholt: Could you test what pressing and releasing just the ... key sends?\n. Intercepting keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_ESCAPE in onKeyPreIme() may not be necessary, at least not longer.\nIt came from Android 4.4 or earlier, where if I recall correctly this was needed to prevent the system from handling Escape as the back key. This intercepting does not seem to be necessary anymore, since at least on Android 5.1 and 6.0 the Escape key is sent to onKeyDown as other keys and can be consumed there, without messing with the IME.\n. @gscholt Thanks for all the help! Could you try out the newly released 0.23 version of Termux to see if it fixes the issue :pray: ?\n. Thanks to @bumper314 this will be available in a v0.52 update available later today!. It works for me. Could you try accessing http://apt.termux.com/dists/stable/InRelease in the browser on the device, and try running\nwget http://apt.termux.com/dists/stable/InRelease\nCould you also paste the output of uname -a and apt --version?\n. Also, which Android device do you run? Which Android version? Running a custom ROM? Rooted? \n. I'm closing this issue in favour of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/99 which tracks the same issue! You're very welcome to enter the information about Android device, version and ROM there!\n. Yea, text selection is definitely an area for improvement!\n. Text selection has been quite improved in v0.26 of the app - try it out and report if there is any problem!\n. @epitron I'll look at improving the details! Note that you do not need to hit the handles exactly with the finger, it's enough to be close - this can be use to select all the way to the edge in your first screenshot.\n. I think the external storage path can very between devices, on a Sony device here it is /storage/sdcard1/.\nYou can make Termux create a symlink to an app-private part of the external storage:\n1. Make sure you have an up to date Termux app (version 0.23 or later) and updated packages (apt update && apt upgrade).\n2. Execute termux-setup-storage.\n3. If the app can find external storage, a symlink will be setup at $HOME/storage/external to a Termux-specific folder in it.\n4. By executing ls -l $HOME/storage/external you can see the path to it.\n. The df issue has been fixed in the termux-tools package, update with apt update && apt upgrade.\nAbout the ssh problem, it seems that you are trying to execute a system binary, not the one supplied by Termux. See https://termux.com/common-problems.html#cannot-link-executable-cannot-locate-symbol--referenced-by- for how to work around that!\n. Thanks - this has been added to the list of package suggestion at https://termux.com/package-suggestions.html!\n. What do you think about doing the following for programs enabling terminal mouse events?\n1. One finger down and dragging: Treat as mouse button down and dragging mouse.\n2. Two fingers down and dragging: Treat as mouse wheel scroll events (this is what is currently done now regardless of fingers down).\n. Ok, so on your N7, the hacker's keyboard does not show up even though you have selected it and it works in other apps?\nA guess would be that the problem lies in the system (cyanogenmod) since the underlying handling of which keyboard to show is done by the system, not the app themselves...\n. @OpnSrcConstruction Great that you got it working!\n. Thanks for the suggestion! This is being tracked in issue https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/12 which you can subscribe to for progress!\n. Hi, Termux requires Android version 5.0 or later, so you will have to wait\nfor Andy to update the version of Android!\nRegards,\nFredrik\nOn 16 Jan 2016 5:56 a.m., \"Sistahoutsydah\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHi and Happy New Year How can I get the Termux app to work in Andy? It\nsays not compatible with my xps 13 running Win 10\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/39.\n. Which Android device and version is this (and what is the name of the bluetooth keyboard)?\n\nThere was a change regarding escape handling to get the Pixel C escape key to work which probably caused this.\n. latest cm 13 - is that Android 6.0?\nI don't think it should be tmux related, you can try using vim directly to verify that!\nCould you download https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.keywatcher and attach the output from pressing the Escape key here?\n. @huiyiqun Thanks for the help! One more thing would help: Can you execute the following:\napt install vtutils\nvtshowkeys\nand the press the Escape key and note the output here - it should be something like\n0033  27 0x1B Escape '^[' or '\\e'\nIf there is no output done when pressing Escape: do anything at all happen if you press Escape multiple times?\n. Which keyboard app do you use? Could you try a fifferent one to see if the escape key works there?\n. Thanks a lot for identifying that the problem is Google pinyin specific!\nI don't know of a workaround besides switching the input method at the moment - will try out things later when I have a device with a bluetooth keyboard available.\n. I can reproduce the problem with the Escape key doing nothing with a bluetooth keyboard using the Google Pinyin Input method.\nHowever, the problem is only when the keyboard is visible - when the keyboard is hidden the Escape key works correctly. Do you see the same behaviour with escape working when the keyboard is hidden?\n. You can use $HOME/.profile for that! Put e.g.\nexport FOO=BAR\nin that file.\n. I modified the cloudflare setting to lower the chance of getting a captcha page to the lowest possible. Does it work now or do you still get a captcha?\n. The issue seems to be that the owncloud Android app needs to support content:// uri:s, after which uploading both files from e.g. Google Drive and Termux will work.\nI reported https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/1476 against owncloud about upload failing with Google Drive in particulaor and content:// uri:s in general, let's wait for feedback there.\n. Hi,\nthere was a critical bug in the apt package. There is a new build of apt available which adds the missing methods/store. Please execute the following commands to install the new apt version manually:\nwget http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-arm/apt_1.2.1-1_arm.deb\ndpkg -i apt_1.2.1-1_arm.deb\nReplace \"arm\" with \"i686\" above if running a device with an intel cpu:\nwget http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-i686/apt_1.2.1-1_i686.deb\ndpkg -i apt_1.2.1-1_i686.deb\ufeff\n. Normally you just need to run apt update && apt upgrade to install the latest packages, but since this was a bug in the apt tool itself one must do the manual installation above.\n. Unfortunately not! Since the app doesn't use chroot to setup a virtual file system it means that packages are built assuming that /data/data/com.termux/files/usr exists, which doesn't work for non-primary user accounts.\nIt may be changed in the future, but it's not something that's going to be done in the short term.\n. Cool :)!\n. There seems to be no /dev/ptmx when running under ARC, so a terminal emulator cannot be run.\nTechnically the Linux terminal subsystem isn't an official Android API, so I'm not sure if the ARC team would consider it a bug or not.\n. Thanks, will look into this!\nWhen I test default (1) the OS X Terminal.app, (2) iTerm and (3) xterm they all seem to do the same thing as Termux here.\nThis seems to come from these terminals supporting the background color erase functionality. See e.g. this bug about this behaviour where it was added to another terminal emulator.\nWhich terminal emulators have you tested with that does not use the the current fg and bg colors when clearing?\n. @xiaq Have you been able to check the issue? \nI think for \\033[J and \\033[K the background color should be used as argued above, but the original problem you had with Termux could be another issue perhaps?\n. Thanks for the suggestion! I've started to look at clisp, but it seems to be a dead project not able to cross compile for Android without quite some work, and there is no arm64 support. I think Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) will be easier to get in the future!\n. The python package is Python3, and the python2 package is Python2. You can use pip to install more python libraries - re-open this issue if there is anything special you need packaged in Termux!\n. 1. Font size can be changed by pinch zooming.\n2. You can have several sessions by pulling out the drawer menu from the left.\n. By removing the end message, do you mean that you want to close the terminal directly when the session finishes?\n. :). It's actually not possible to do at the moment - Termux always needs input to close a finished session.\nThe main reason for this is that a user may have broken his environment so that the session ends directly, in which case we do not want to close the app directly when trying to start a session, but instead leave it open with the error message visible and the ability to start a failsafe session by long-pressing on the New Session button.\nThere are to foolprof this, so leaving the issue open!\n. All Termux add-ons needs to be signed with the same key, which means that you cannot e.g. install Termux from F-Droid and termux-styling from Google Play (or vice versa), since F-Droid uses a custom key for signing. Could this explain the problem?\n. You can disable line wrapping by using terminal escape codes (DECAWM\u2014Autowrap Mode), which works in any terminal! Use\nprintf \"\\033[?7l\"\nto disable line wrapping, and then\nprintf \"\\033[?7h\"\nto enable them again. So you can e.g. do the following:\nprintf \"\\033[?7l\"; curl http://wttr.in/Munich; printf \"\\033[?7h\"\n. @Stabledog termux-chroot is a script provided by the proot package.\nPRoot is an implementation using ptrace to fake a chroot without requiring root privileges.. @cswl Looks interesting! Will look closer when I have more time.\nPerhaps the su command can be likewise wrapped to make using it from Termux more seamless.\n. Tabe Kooistra has given this su alias:\nalias su='/system/xbin/su --preserve-environment -c LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib exec /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash --login'\n\ufeff\n. @cswl Awesome!\nIt would be great if some people could try it up in different rooted devices/environments and report if it's working!\nIf it seems ok I guess we could add this as $PREFIX/bin/su in the default install (so running su will pick up this)? Or do you think it should be tsu?\nIt would be nice (if this wrapper script works well) to have it as the default su, so it works more \"out of the box\", and hopefully it wouldn't confuse/annoy people that Termux wraps the real su like this.\n. @vlad3-3-3 Interesting, thanks for sharing!. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#178\n. Hi, thanks for the detailed explanation! I don't have access to a Blackberry Priv, so it would be helpful if you could use the app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.keywatcher and paste the output from combining e.g. Alt+j here!\n\nOn a PC/laptop, this is the desired behavior because the symbols generated by Alt are usually less commonly used and most people would want Meta aka Escape sequence to augment their control of the terminal. However this is not usually the case with a smaller keyboard on a mobile - the symbols in combination with Alt are usually very useful.\n\nI agree. What I'm thinking about now is to differentiate if the key events are from a full-size external (probably bluetooth keyboard) from the case where a smaller hardware keyboard such as on the Priv is used. So the debug output from the above link would be great!\n. What is the output of apt --version?\n. @Yajo Did you install Termux a few months ago and haven't run apt upgrade in a couple of months?\nThe problem is that the apt version is old, and is not able to work with the new apt repository format. You should be able to manually install the new apt version (and liblzma which newer apt depends on) with:\nwget http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-arm/liblzma-5.2.2_arm.deb\ndpkg -i liblzma-5.2.2_arm.deb\nwget http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-arm/apt_1.2.4_arm.deb\ndpkg -i apt_1.2.4_arm.deb\nand after that run apt update && apt upgrade to have all packages up to date. Does that work for you?\n. EDIT: What @Neo-Oli says is probably better than the below steps, do the above first and re-open the issue if the problem remains!\nHi, the termux-api package has been fixed in the newly released version 0.13 of the package.\nHowever, your apt hanging means that you cannot install this update :). Can you do the following steps:\n1. Run rm $PREFIX/var/lib/apt/lists/termux.net*\n2. Run apt-get clean.\n3. Run apt update and see if the problem remains.\n4. (If the problems remain): Paste the output of running apt --version and apt update -o Debug::Acquire::http=true here!\n. Hi, thanks for the feedback! This should be fixed in version 0.32 which has been released and should be available as an update shortly. Let me know if an problem remains!\n. Termux needs to have permissions to access the SD card - execute termus-setup-storage to do that and read the details at https://termux.com/storage.html (and re-open the issue if there are any problems)!\n. Could you link to the issue created at opentask/dmfs?\n. Can you check if this has been fixed in the latest update (version 0.32) of Termux?\n. The 505 is probably due to trying to mix app installs from fdroid and google play.\nThe version will be available as an update in fdroid shortly (there is a slight delay before fdroid detects the new release and builds it from source).\n. @dmfs The problem was that the Termux app matched too many intents, which in this case probably caused Termux to be launched by mistake by an intent from OpenTasks and crashed due to this intent not being expected.\n. Strange! Could you try uninstalling and re-installing yet again to see if the problem remains?\nDo you have a custom rom? From where do you install your app (e.g. google play or f-droid)?\n. If it's possible, you can try running a failsafe shell by pulling out the drawer menu from the left, long pressing the NEW SESSION button and pressing the FAILSAFE button in the resulting dialog.\nIf you get a working shell there you can examine the folder structure and perhaps trying to remove everything rm -Rf $PREFIX $HOME and exit the shell to force a clean re-install next launch of the app.\nAnother thing to ensure could be to uninstall all Termux add-ons (such as Termux:Styling, Termux:API, etc) as well as the Termux main app itself before installing again, to see if that ensures a clean install.\nI'm closing this issue as I'm trying to clean up issues a bit, just re-open the issue after you have tried the above and need more help!\n. @efi Two things to try out in the failsafe shell:\n1. What is the output of uname -a?\n2. Can you try execute /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/dash and see if that works?\nI just got another report about in the Google Play store about Termux not working with Samsung Galaxy S5 neo (failing with exec(\"/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash\")), so it could be something with this phone model.\n. @efi Thanks, it could very well be due to the cpu! It seems that Exynos 7580 is 64-bit capable, but perhaps the S5 neo system doesn't have 64-bit support built in?\nTermux could then be confused and try to install 64-bit binaries due to the cpu supporting it, but the system linker does not support running it and gives the not found error just as you linked earlier.\nCan you run the http://fornwall.net/termux-debug.apk app and see the output from that? It's a single textview showing something like os.arch=...? Using System.getProperty(\"os.arch\") is how Termux decides which arch to install the initial binaries for.\nAlso, from the failsafe shell:\n1. Can you check if the file /system/bin/linker64 exists (e.g. by running ls /system/bin/linker64)?\n2. What is the output of cat /proc/cpu?\n3. What is the output of /system/bin/getprop  | grep cpu?\nThanks for all your help here!\n. @efi Thanks a lot, this is enough for me to create a fix! I'll ping you shortly when I've released an update.\n. @efi This should now be fixed in the v0.33 of the Termux app which should be available as an update shortly - try uninstalling and then reinstalling this version and let me know how it works!\n. @Neo-Oli I'm not sure, need to test with a usb otg storage.\nPerhaps direct file system access is not possible, and an api method could be added instead.\n. It seems that direct file system access is not possible starting from Android 6.0 - from Android USB media support documentation, as mentioned in this stackoverflow answer:\n```\nMultiple external storage devices\n\nStarting in Android 4.4, multiple external storage devices are surfaced to developers\nthrough Context.getExternalFilesDirs(), Context.getExternalCacheDirs(),\nand Context.getObbDirs().\nExternal storage devices surfaced through these APIs must be a semi-permanent\npart of the device (such as an SD card slot in a battery compartment).\nDevelopers expect data stored in these locations to be available over long periods\nof time. For this reason, transient storage devices (such as USB mass storage\ndrives) should not be surfaced through these APIs.\nThe WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission must only grant write access to the\nprimary external storage on a device. Apps must not be allowed to write to\nsecondary external storage devices, except in their package-specific directories\nas allowed by synthesized permissions. Restricting writes in this way ensures the\nsystem can clean up files when applications are uninstalled.\nUSB media support\nAndroid 6.0 supports portable storage devices which are only connected to the\ndevice for a short period of time, like USB flash drives. When a user inserts a new\nportable device, the platform shows a notification to let them copy or manage the\ncontents of that device.\nIn Android 6.0, any device that is not adopted is considered portable. Because\nportable storage is connected for only a short time, the platform avoids heavy\noperations such as media scanning. Third-party apps must go through the\nStorage Access Framework to interact with files on portable storage; direct\naccess is explicitly blocked for privacy and security reasons.\n```\nHowever, a command could be created (termux-storage-getfile) which requests a file from the system through a system file dialog (and perhaps outputs it to stdout, so it could be use either in pipes or like termux-storage-getfile > myfile.txt).\nAlso, it should be possible to write a termux-storage-putfile command, which takes a Termux-accessible file as argument, opens up a system file dialog where the user can choose a directory on storage devices where to put the file.. Duplicate of #6 - closing.\n. What is the output of apt --version?\n. @Neo-Oli Thanks! This is probably the reason.\n@5chdn Do the manual steps above as a one-time workaround for your old apt version and re-open the issue if any problem remains!\n. The ping6 tool has been removed from inetutils (since it requires root/setuid) and has been added to termux-tools as a shortcut to the system one (as already done for ping).\n. > Shebangs in generated intermediary configuration files fail due to wrong location. Any way to fix this, make a symbolic link or something ?\nTo fix shebangs pointing to /bin/ and /usr/bin you could create symlinks for these folders if you have root access.\nYou could also apt install chroot and run the termux-chroot utility in that package which sets up a chroot without requiring root.\n\nThe configuration can't find the Ruby header: [...]\n\nDo you still have this problem (re-open this issue if so)? What is the output of ruby -e 'p RbConfig::CONFIG[\"rubyhdrdir\"]'?\n. See https://termux.com/touch-keyboard.html for how to input Ctrl+A and other special keys!\nAbout screen, it's possible that it comes as a package in the future!\n. You need the LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib environment variable setup for the system linker to find the libraries. You could try with just\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib\nAnother solution could be to start telnetd on the device (it uses port 8023 by default), then use adb port forwarding to allow a telnet connection.\n. Do the problem remain? Can you visit http://termux.net/dists/stable/InRelease in the browser?\n. @glitchphan The wget output is strange. Could you try both on a separate network and see if you get the same problem? Also, could you save the file (omit the -O option) and put up the file somewhere so I can exame it?\n. Interesting! The file you receive is actually InRelease in gzipped format (seen by using zcat InRelease). I'll check if it could be from my servers end, please check from your end by varying the network if possible!\nCould you try to access the following two urls with wget and see if they return the gzipped data as well?\n1: https://termux.net/dists/stable/InRelease\n2: http://apt.termux.com/dists/stable/InRelease\n. @glitchphan Which network is the one returning the gzipped resource?\nIt would be helpful if you could run this and paste the output to see the http headers:\ncurl -H \"Accept-Encoding: gzip\" -D- -O http://termux.net/dists/stable/InRelease\n. Also run once without the Accept-Encoding header:\ncurl -D- -O http://termux.net/dists/stable/InRelease\n. Thanks! Finally, can you try appending a parameter t=1 and see if that removes the Content-Encoding: gzip header in the response? Like in:\ncurl -D- -O http://termux.net/dists/stable/InRelease?t=1\n. Ok, could you try again with the same curl command as the last? I added the Vary: Accept-Encoding header from my servers end.\n. Ok, let's try again if we can avoid Content-Encoding: gzip :). Could you try again with a new url?\ncurl -D- -O http://termux.net/dists/stable/InRelease?t=1\n. Great :)! Does apt update work on the device now?\n. Thanks for the suggestion! For the git issue, there may be a solution - see https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/227 and comment there what you think about the proposed patch!\nHowever, adding a document provider for the Storage Access Framework seems like a good idea in general, not only to work around the git issue, so let's leave this issue open while I'm looking at it!\n. The v0.34 update of the Termux app, which should be available as an update shortly, now implements the Storage Access Framework to expose files under $HOME for e.g. editing with Turbo Editor.\nTry it out and let me know if there is any problem!\n. Can you go to\nSettings > Apps > Termux > Permissions\nand see if the Storage permission is granted to the app?\n. If it is (which I guess it is since it works from within Termux):\nYou are running sshd from Termux and not a separate one? Can you check if running whoami shows the same user when running from within Termux as it is when running over ssh?\n. Great that ssh is working now!\nAbout access denied: The shared file system does not allow chmod (or symlink operations), and there is nothing Termux can do about that. You are probably better of using an app-private folder under $HOME/ somewhere!\n. You can open the Gmail app with pre-filled recipient, text and subject by executing the following command:\nam start --user 0 -a android.intent.action.SEND -t \"text/plain\" \\\n    -n com.google.android.gm/.ComposeActivityGmail \\\n    --esa android.intent.extra.EMAIL \"recipient@example.com\" \\\n    --es android.intent.extra.TEXT \"Message to send.\" \\\n    --es android.intent.extra.SUBJECT \"Subject to use\"\nNote that you cannot send an email without user interaction using the gmail app - it's not possible by design. To automatically send an email you are probably best of looking at mutt as @Neo-Oli says.\n. I tested on Android 7 and the issue seems to be solved there - Ctrl+Space works when using external keyboards, so I'm closing this issue.\nFor previous Android versions there is unfortunately nothing to do about it, as the key event is not sent to apps.\n. Great! Closing this issue.\n. It's not possible to have traceroute without root permissions unfortunately.\nThere is a non-root alternative in the tracepath utility:\n$ apt update\n$ apt install tracepath\n$ tracepath google.com\n1:  android-9cfccccc54b77f66                              1.077ms pmtu 1500\n1:  router.asus.com                                       2.013ms \n1:  router.asus.com                                       1.194ms \n2:  gw10.a400.priv.bahnhof.se                             2.697ms \n3:  ti3080d400-xe0-1-2.ti.telenor.net                    12.424ms asymm  6 \n4:  a400-gw-c.bahnhof.net                                 5.233ms \n5:  a400-gw.bahnhof.net                                  20.228ms \n6:  100.64.1.49                                           2.858ms \n7:  h-213-80-104-104.na.cust.bahnhof.se                   4.482ms \n8:  ste-cgn-ar1.sto-cr1.bahnhof.net                       4.119ms \n[...]\n. Thanks, I'm awaiting the version 5 update to reach me so that I can test!\n. Ok, so the workarounds didn't work across keyboards and the numbers row are back in the latest version (v0.38). But using the TYPE_NULL input type is the most correct thing to do and hopefully works best across keyboards, so this is probably something we have to live with.\n. I'm unfortunately not able to reproduce it directly, will try on more devices. Meanwhile, could you provide a screenshot of the whole screen while you are having the issue?\n. This was actually a problem with the terminal refusing to resize to lower than 8 rows.\nI've changed that for the upcoming update to 4, so it should fix the situation shown in your screenshot (it's probably not worth going lower than 4 since programs and terminal emulation starts to misbehave in that case).\nThanks a lot for reporting!\n. It's not possible, but something like this is planned in the medium term!\n. Track the issue at https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/63 for progress in this - so I'm closing this issue to avoid duplication.\n. Thanks! This should now be fixed in the upcoming release - can you try a preview version of the next release at https://termux.org/termux-0.35.PREVIEW1.apk and see if it works for you?\n. It's not possible yet, but probably will be soon. Let's leave this issue open to track this.\n. 24-bit color is now supported as of the 0.40 version!\n. As @deed02392 says, run\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib\nin the root shell. This environment variable is needed for shared libraries to be found by Termux-supplied binaries.\n. @tinydynamite00 Thanks for the input! I agree that the situation for root users can be improved a lot, perhaps by creating a 'su' wrapper which preserves the relevant environment and launches the normal shell. Let's keep the \"improve Termux for root users\" discussion at https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/61!\n. Thanks! Will look into this and try it out.\n. @rustybird Sorry for the delay in feedback!\nI'm not sure what the best course of action is here. After talking with some people using the app, perhaps it's best just to close sessions automatically on exit code 0, and let everything else (other exit codes and signals) cause the current behaviour where Enter is needed to proceed.\nThe rare case where someone messes up the startup (as in exit 0 in ~/.profile) could be handled by having a separate shortcut to a failsafe session.\nWhat do you (and others) think about that?. Does connecting with mosh to the same server work from a computer (to see if the problem is not Termux-specific)?\nIf it works from another environment but not from Termux, can you check the environment variables by running env and pasting them here?\n. @sodoku Termux by default runs with en_US.UTF-8, not US-ASCII. Can you check envs in Termux to ensure that you haven't modified them yourself by mistake?\n. @sodoku One thing you can try out: install perl with apt install perl, then run mosh.pl sodoku@host - that is, run mosh.pl instead of mosh. Does that make a difference?\n. @sodoku Ok, interesting! It's a problem with the mosh wrapper used in the Termux package to avoid depending on perl.. Will look into it.\n. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#288\n. This is now fixed in the latest version of the mosh package, to which you can update with:\napt update && apt upgrade\n. Interesting! Haven't seen that one before, will look around. Let me know if you (or anyone else) finds out anything more here!\n. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#287\n. Thanks, will try this out after the next release of the app!\n. @ni554n Can you paste the output of running alias uu?\n. What do you mean with \n\npageUp/Down gestures\n\nhere? Just scrolling up and down by dragging your finger on the screen?\n. See https://termux.com/hardware-keyboard.html - you should be able to change font size by pressing Ctrl+Shift and + or -. Does that work?\n. See https://termux.com/hardware-keyboard.html:\n1. Ctrl+Shift+N for next session.\n2. Ctrl+Shift+P for previous session.\nDoes these work for you?\n. Interesting that this happens with other fonts as well. Could it be a problem with the Huawei P8 and monospace fonts? Anyone else have the same problem (with the P8 or another device)?\n. @ikurek Could you try changing font with Termux:Styling?\n. Thanks - this should now work in the latest 7.2p2-5 version of the openssh package. Update to it with apt update && apt upgrade and make sure to kill any old sshd server process with killall -9 sshd before starting sshd again after updating.\nLet me know if there are any remaining problem!\n. Is this fixed by the new v0.39 update of the app for you?\n. I'm on a vacation with limited computer access, will look at this later (in about two weeks)!\n. When running su, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable needed by Termux packages to find shared libraries get lost.\nFor a utility script working around that see https://github.com/cswl/tsu, which you can install with apt update && apt install tsu.\n. This does indeed looks like a bug in busybox - I have now reported it upstream at https://bugs.busybox.net/show_bug.cgi?id=9106.\n. @danalgen Nice find!\nI guess CONFIG_FEATURE_NON_POSIX_CP=y is a reasonable thing to set?\nThere is no good reason for it not being set - it's just that the busybox config file used in Termux was created by copying configs/android_defconfig as a starting point, and that one has # CONFIG_FEATURE_NON_POSIX_CP is not set.\n. The JNI code is built by gradle (see app/build.gradle) - you may perhaps compile the single C file manually?\n. This has been solved in version 0.47 of the app (see https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/261 for details).. Will think about it - note that you can use Volume Up+V to bring up the standard volume control already.\n. Could you use the app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.keywatcher and press Escape and attach the output?\n. @t123yh Thanks for the information! Could you try creating the file $HOME/.termux/termux.properties and add the line\nback-key=escape\nthere, run termux-reload-settings and see if that makes a difference?\nOtherwise,\n- Key Code: 111 is KeyEvent.KEYCODE_ESCAPE.\n- Action: 0 is KeyEvent.ACTION_DOWN followed by Action: 1 - KeyEvent.ACTION_UP.\nLooks ok, so I wonder what the problem is.\n. @t123yh Does the v0.38 update make a difference?\nIf not, could you try the back-key=escape configuration shown above?\n. @t123yh Great, thanks! Did that require the back-key=escape configuration or did it work without having to do that?\n. Do you get a 403 Forbidden if you access http://termux.net/dists/stable/Release with this proxy? Any idea why?\n. This should be fixed now - it was a problem on the server end causing captchas to be showed for Tor connections.. Does it work if you rm -Rf ~/.storage and run andtermux-setup-storage again, with an external-1 or external-2 folder being setup pointing to the external sd card?. Thanks - this was indeed a regression with some keyboards, and should be fixed by the v0.37 update which has been released and should be available as an update in Google Play and F-Droid shortly!\n. > Actually, when it doesn't work is when the prediction typing row is open.\nAha - thanks, I'll fix that shortly as well!\n. > Actually, when it doesn't work is when the prediction typing row is open.\nPlease try out the updated version 0.38 which should fix this issue!\nIt should be available as an update on F-Droid and Google Play shortly.\n. Thanks for reporting - will do the final testing during the next couple of hours, then release an update fixing this issue!\n. Please try out the updated version 0.38 which should fix this issue!\nIt should be available as an update on F-Droid and Google Play shortly.\n. A non-system Android app does not even have the permission to reboot, so this must AFAIK be a bug in the system (perhaps kernel/system panic forcing a reboot)?\nWould be interesting to see if people on more devices can reproduce the problem (if so, write down your device name!), and see if it's device/manufacturer specific or not!\n. Interesting! I found an old bug report for python on Android where python could cause a system reboot, could be related (the underlying thing in python and Android maybe remains the same).. Would be really interesting to find what causes this. Does anyone have an idea?. @tomty89 Right, this is (probably) a kernel or Android framework bug (possibly due to vendor modifications), as an app shouldn't be able to cause an instant reboot.\nIt would still be interesting to know what causes this exactly and perhaps work around it, if possible.. Hm, I thought most apps use the android system dns server - only nmap and dnsutils uses $PREFIX/etc/resolv.conf. Does that seem to be correct?\n. Normally the libc implementation of the resolver uses /etc/resolv.conf, but that is not the case for the libc on Android. So having most program using resolv.conf is not possible without overriding the libc resolver, which is outside the scope here.\nAs for nmap and dnsutils (the latter which contains nslookup), perhaps they can be patched to use the system one either by default or as an option?\nI guess the system name server can be obtained with getprop net.dns1 (and getprop net.dns2), could you try to temporarily write that to resolv.conf and see if it works as expected for you?\n. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#1174. You have a x86_64 Android system, which can run aarch64 via emulation, and you get the aarch64 install even tough x86_64 would  be better? Is that correct?\n. Thanks - this should be resolved in the v0.39 update of the Termux app!\nThe problem was that the ordering of Build.SUPPORTED_ABIS/ro.product.cpu.abilist was not considered, so a suboptimal arch was used.\n. @youling257 I had misconfigured cache settings for the new x86_64 repository - this have now been fixed, so should work after an apt update.\nThanks!\n. @5chdn It works for me when I test on an arm device - could you try again and see if it works better? It can have been a temporary cache somewhere along the line.\n. Awesome find, really nice work!\nThe change is in the v0.39 update of the app which should be available as an update shortly.\n. @igrep Thanks for the description!\nCould you try out https://fornwall.net/termux-0.39-issue137.apk and see if that build fixes the problem?\n. Great! I'll have that change in the next v0.40 update shortly, thanks for your help!\n. We can keep it here without creating a new issue, I'm looking into it!\n. There seems to be the same problem with Google Japanese Input, right?\n. @igrep Could you try the build at https://fornwall.net/termux-0.39-issue137-clear-on-commit.apk and if that fixes the issue?\n. @igrep Could you try out https://fornwall.net/t40-pre1.apk, a new experimental preview, and tell me if that works?\n. Thanks! This will be fixed in the v0.40 update shortly!\n. Hi! As I'm not an emacs user myself, could you give exact steps how to reproduce?\n. @shivsoji Thanks a lot for the descriptive problem report!\nThis has been fixed in version 25.0.95-2 of the emacs package, to which you can update with\napt update && apt upgrade\n. @intdel Can you give steps to reproduce (a limited test case program in go perhaps)?\n. I think this is something we will have to live with - as the Termux app itself does not modify the file system, but underlying processes do, it would be difficult/expensive to monitor all file system changes.\nThe workaround with clicking away from the directory and back will have to do!\n. A good idea!\nFrom the adb shell you can use dumpsys package com.termux | grep versionName to get the version, but the permission to use dumpsys is not granted to non-system apps.\nA solution could be to expose an API method just like Termux:API does, which can be used to show the version. I'm planning to move some API methods (at least termux-share and termux-notification) into the main app anyway.\nAbout who installed the app: I think you can detect google play (com.android.vending, test with pm list packages -i | grep com.termux and look at the installer field) - anything else such as f-droid and manual installation has installer=null.\n. @filodej Would Ctrl+Alt work as a prefix for shortcuts (https://termux.com/hardware-keyboard.html) for you as well?\n. The prefix for shortcuts has now been changed to Ctrl+Alt  in version 0.42 of the Termux app, which should be available as an update in a couple of hours\n. Is this with a USB OTG keyboard?\n. @t123yh Thanks for the great bug report! This has been fixed in the newly released 0.41 version which should be available as an update shortly.\n. Initial check to make sure: Run apt update && apt upgrade to ensure that you test against the latest package versions. If the problem remains after that:\nCould you provide the output of running dpkg --print-architecture and uname -a? Also, which device and Android version do you run?\nThis issue may be the same root cause: https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/380\nI've tested with a arm-on-android6, aarch64-on-android6 and x86_64-on-android7, and it works for me there, so it may depend on device, arch and/or android version.\n. @qntmpkts Also, can you test if ruby -e 'system(\"echo hi\")' is enough for you to reproduce a problem (that is, if system() in ruby does not work on your setup at all)?\n. It seems like a bug or missing feature in the android runtime for chrome os. I wonder where to report bugs against that component?\n@qntmpkts Can you try compile and run the following C program for a minimal test case?\n``` C\ninclude \ninclude \nint main() {\n        uid_t ruid, euid, suid;\n        if (getresuid(&ruid, &euid, &suid) == 0) {\n                printf(\"ruid=%d, euid=%d, suid=%d\\n\", ruid, euid, suid);\n        } else {\n                perror(\"getresuid\");\n        }\n        return 0;\n}\n```\n. @qntmpkts Thanks, let me know if you find out something, or if a Chrome OS update resolves the issue!\n. Ok, I filed a bug there at https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=643119.\n. @qntmpkts Can you try out a build of ruby where the usage of getresuid() has been disabled:\nwget http://fornwall.net/ruby_2.3.1-5_i686.deb\napt install ./ruby_2.3.1-5_i686.deb\n. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#901. Thanks - the Home key should now work as of the newly released version 0.40 update, which should be available as an update for everyone shortly!\nLet me know if it doesn't work after updating to version 0.40!\n. The updated version 0.49 of Termux, which has just been released and should be available as an update shortly, has removed the toast notification on clipboard text completely (we can bring it back as an option if there is enough demand for it).\nThanks for reporting!. Good idea! This has been changed to version 0.42 of the Termux app which should be available as an update in a couple of hours.\n. Could you paste the output of running sh -x su?\n. @gscholt What do you think about Ctrl+Shift+Alt - would you be satisfied with that or do you think holding three modifiers down for shortcuts is a bit too much?\n. @memeplex Thanks for reporting!\nThe issue was that the man implementation in Termux comes from mandoc, which does not adjust output width to that of the terminal.\nAs this is rather nice to have in Termux where smaller screens are common, I've added this by patching the package. If you run\napt update && apt upgrade\nyou will receive the updated version 1.13.4-3 of the man package which should adjust to the terminal width - let me know otherwise!\n. The historical reason that https is not used by default is to save space - on initial startup a couple of base packages are downloaded, and we want this to be as small as possible.\nBut perhaps this (avoiding installation ofapt-transport-https and its dependencies libcurl, openssl and libnghttp2 by default) is not a problem - it looks like around 2.5 MB of install size would be added, which is not that huge.\nSwitching to TLS would also fix problems with \"helpful\" caching proxies in addition to MITM attacks.\n. @like2omg Note that the packages are already signed with gpg and validated before install - see secure apt. This means that the package manager will never install packages that have been modified, since an attacker cannot sign these modified packages with a trusted key.. This is now finally in place - the Termux packages are installed over https by default for new installations!\nExisting users need to update their system by running pkg up to update to the 1.4.8 version of the apt package where https by default is enabled.. @Mannshoch In another terminal app (where su is working), what is the output of which su?\n. @tgc12 Thanks, /magisk/.core/bin/su should now work with su after updating installed packages with\napt update && apt upgrade. You are probably using vi/vim - see e.g. [How to exit the vim editor on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-to-exit-the-vim-editor).\n\nNote that you can change to use another editor. Perhaps try nano? Install it with apt install nano, then execute export EDITOR=nano to make git use nano as editor for commit messages.\n. @torappinfo Could you use the app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.keywatcher and press the Home and End keys, and paste the output here to see which key codes are sent?\nAlso, do you know how I myself could install the com.xinshuru.inputmethod soft keyboard?\n. After testing the input method there is unfortunately currently not anything Termux can do about it - it has to be fixed on the side of the input method. Try reporting it there, with a description like\n\nThe keyboard needs to send key events for Home and End keys (at least if the current input type is InputType.TYPE_NULL.\n\nThe reason that it works in other apps is that they use normal text views handled by the system - but a terminal is not a normal textview, and needs raw key events to function.\n. I'm sorry, but there is no version compatible with Android 4 - Termux required Android 5 from the start.\n. Could you try running apt clean and apt update before trying to install vim again?\n. @GabrielGab I tested on a clean install and it works for me.\nCould it be a problem with the http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-all/Packages.xz file being cached somewhere for you? Can you run\nwget http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-all/Packages.xz\nsha256sum Packages.xz\n? It should output 3fac9416d038553984c269a817681cbf2081212bbecd070c2a78859e1bc213ff.\nAlso, could you give the complete error message from running apt update?\n. @GabrielGab Ok, great! I'm closing this issue, let me know if you encounter any problem again!\n. Perhaps localtunnel? I haven't used that myself though.\nYou're welcome to ask this (and other questions) at https://termux.com/community!\n. @pyhedgehog @GabrielGab Note that a tor package is now available in Termux and can be installed with apt install tor.. I managed to reproduce it on a Samsung device!\nIt seems to be if the setting Auto check spelling is enabled - does turning that setting off fix the problem for you @michaeljensen @haniasita?\n. It's unfortunately nothing Termux can do it - it's just the way the Android C library is used.\nUsers of _cnt need to change to something more portable in order to work on Android.\n. Could you post the complete error message/stack trace?\n. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#533\n. It works for me when I test.\n- Does it work when use ssh into the remote computer outside of tmux?\n- Can you try ssh:ing into the mac from another computer under tmux, to see if it works there (and the problem is Termux-specific)?\n. Currently it's best not to run apt as root (there is no advantage in doing so, and causes issues such as this at the moment).\n. As @sm4rk0, it's outside the scope of Termux to handle issues like these.\nThat said, you can ask at https://termux.com/community to see if anyone knows!\n. For these types of question I thinks it's better to use our chat channel at https://gitter.im/termux/termux or #termux on freenode.. @pp3345 Thanks, looks interesting!\nWhat's currently the best way to test freeform mode on a device or emulator?\n. @pp3345 Sorry for the delay here! Will look into it soon and get back to you (I just have some other issues and features in the pipeline I want to get done first).. I've put the app functionality itself on the back burner for a while focusing on packages, but I'm planning to give the app itself some love going forward!\n@pp3345 About freeform mode, has anything happened with that in the upcoming Android 8? Is it getting more official and/or has anything changed?. Closed in favour of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/542\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/6.\n. Could you affected print the output of running:\nls -lha /system/bin/linker* /system/bin/app_process\n\n. @renebruns @mtsdesign Thanks for the information!\nCould you run apt update && apt upgrade to update to version 0.34 of the termux-tools package and check if that resolves this issue?. Thanks!\n. Sorry - I'm holding back with translations for now (there will be some UI changes soon, so translations will have to wait a bit).\n. @anthologist I'll announce it on twitter and the Termux community on Google+ when it's ready for translation.. The file .profile is better for this - just put your PATH manipulation there.. @vlad3-3-3 Does vysor (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vysor/gidgenkbbabolejbgbpnhbimgjbffefm) work?. I'm thinking about patching apt so that it always runs as the normal Termux user (u0_a133), so that even if one happens to run it as root nothing bad happens.. Hm, perhaps this is caused by parent directories not being accessible (/data/, which the Termux folders are under, are not accessible).\nIf we find out where the error happens we could patch around it, hopefully.. Ok, this was actually an issue with the bash shell! It has been fixed in version 4.4.5-1 of the bash package, update with:\napt update && apt upgrade\n\nAlso, note that the -z compress option is not supported, you need the newer (soon to be made by default by rsync) -zz option (as long as you're client is at least version 3.1.1, otherwise you must skip rsync compression until upgrading).. For now you have to work around this by deleting the offending symlinks manually before running apt again.\nYou can track the underlying issue at https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/558, which will hopefully be fixed shortly.. Install the required package for building lxml:\napt install libxslt-dev\n\nDoes it work now?. I'm closing this in favour of tracking the issue in https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/558.. @Quasic There as a typo in an earlier version of termux-setup-storage (run apt update && apt upgrade to install updated packages!) - the real directory is $HOME/storage without the dot.. @nonnymoose The Termux app can gain access to the SD card, but (as I understand it) only when using the appropriate java api (Storage Access Framework). Terminal programs such as vim, cat, cp etc. would not gain direct file system level access.. It's a behaviour that varies between terminal emulators, e.g. the macOS terminal doesn't clear scrollback either.\nCurrently I think this is desirable - if you need to use reset to fix a broken terminal state it's not always the case that you want to loose scrollback history. So, I'm closing this for now, let me know if you have a compelling use case where clearing scrollback history is important!. The reset command takes an optinal argument the terminal type. There is no terminal type named \"termux\", which is why the error happens when running reset termux. Just running reset  without arguments will work.. @xoba Thanks for the test case!\nIt works for me when testing on a Nexus 6p running Android 7.1. Which device and Android version do you run on?\nAnyone else here who can test the above program?. @xoba To be sure, run apt update && apt upgrade to ensure that you are running latest package versions before trying to compile again.\nIf the problem remains, what does dpkg --print-architecture output?. @xoba Sorry for the late reply, but indeed I think the issue is that on Android you need to link to the libc resolver for it to work, which statically compared binaries from ubuntu does not.. Hm, the error message seems to come from line 245 in the bionic linker.cpp](https://github.com/android/platform_bionic/blob/master/linker/linker.cpp#L245).\nC\nif (strlen(name) >= PATH_MAX) {\n  DL_ERR(\"library name \\\"%s\\\" too long\", name);\n  return nullptr;\n}\nBut PATH_MAX is 4096 while the actual path length here is 130.. Ok, the limit was 128 chars before, changed in this commit on 31 Mar 2015, which should be in Android 6.0 or later.\n@googost Do you encounter this error on an Android 5.x device?. @noncom Thanks for the feedback!\nUnfortunately there is not much we can do about this platform bug in Termux except noting that is has been resolved in Android 6.0.. > Although I did notice that Termux implements the Storage Access Framework, there aren't any good editor apps that implement this feature.\nWith Turbo Editor you can enable \"Use the Storage Access Framework\" from the right hand drawer!. About differences between external storage and internal: external storage does not allow chmod to modify file attributes (to e.g. set executable permission or limit access from other users), perhaps that is why it doesn't work?\nI'm closing this issue as it probably requires some larger work in the nodejs project itself (so an issue would need to be report against nodejs and worked on there).. Do you use the Control key from a software keyboard (such as Hacker's Keyboard) or a hardware keyboard?. Right - I'm holding of with translations for now, but thanks for the offer!. Thanks for reporting! This was indeed a regression in v0.44, but has been fixed in v0.45 which should be available as an update shortly!. Thanks for reporting it! Before the 0.44 update, was it the \"done\" button that behaved as enter, or was it another enter key visible?\nEDIT: Hm, I guess it was the \"done\" button.. @tylerswagar Thanks a lot for reporting and helping! This will be fixed in a minor v0.46 update which should be available as an update in a couple of hours.. Note: On F-Droid the delay for the update will be a bit longer as they do a nightly build, but it should be available within a day.. Thanks for the feedback! I'll remove the experimental shaking-on-bell behaviour in a minor v0.46 update which will be available as an update in a couple of hours (or within a day on F-Droid).. Termux is both a terminal emulator (like xterm) and a collection of packages for Android (somewhat like a Linux distribution like Ubuntu or Fedora).\nSee e.g. http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php for more information.. I think we don't need any additional setting in the app for this.\nIf one wants to have a the home directory on shared storage, one can simply move the /data/data/com.termux/files/home folder to shared storage, and setup /data/data/com.termux/files/home as a symlink to that folder.. @soaringowl2145 Great!\nI want to avoid asking it automatically, since many people use Termux as e.g. a simple ssh client, and for them the question would just be suspicious spam.\nHowever, I'll probably add a prompt with some short information so that more people can find it easier.. Hm, interesting. This is tails from coreutils.\n\n\nThe -c flag does work when no FILE parameter is specified, but echo -n 123456 | tail -c 3 - works.\n\n\nUsing the longer flag --bytes work in echo -n 123456 | tail --bytes 3.\n\n\nAdding another flag such as in echo -n 123456 | tail -q -c 3 works.. Thanks a lot for reporting the issue! This has now been fixed in version 8.26-1 of the coreutils package, to which you can update with:\napt update && apt upgrade. Interesting - it seems to work on aarch64 and x86_64, but not on 32-bit arm or i686.. This issue seems to result from src/tail.c in coreutils, in the tail_bytes function:\n\n\nC\n      off_t end_pos = ((! presume_input_pipe && usable_st_size (&stats)\n                        && n_bytes <= OFF_T_MAX)\n                       ? stats.st_size : -1);\n      if (end_pos <= ST_BLKSIZE (stats))\n        return pipe_bytes (pretty_filename, fd, n_bytes, read_pos);\nHere end_pos is -1, but the ST_BLKSIZE macro defined in lib/stat-size.h:\n```C\ndefine ST_BLKSIZE(statbuf) ((0 < (statbuf).st_blksize \\\n                           && (statbuf).st_blksize <= ((size_t)-1) / 8 + 1) \\\n                          ? (statbuf).st_blksize : DEV_BSIZE)\n\n```\nresolves into an unsigned long on 32-bit android (due to how the st_blksize field is defined there), so we have a -1 to unsigned comparison.. @st42 Thanks for the informative report! The coreutils package has been updated to version 8.26-2 which should fix this issue, update to it with:\napt update && apt upgrade. Which device is this? Are you running a custom ROM or stock?. I can confirm that Android 7.1 works on Nexus and Pixel devices.\n\nDo you have more information about the custom ROM (link to thread or sources)?\n. @yenon Interesting, thanks for the information about backup software and symlinks.\n@hungryseashell: Could this be relevant here, have you used any backup software that could affect Termux?. A command could perhaps be added to the Termux:API add-on app.\nDo you have an idea of how it would look like? Perhaps something like\ntermux-bluetooth-scan\n\nto find out addresses, and\ntermux-bluetooth-connect <address>\n\nto connect to a device, communicating over stdout&stdin?. Right, apt install openssl-dev to get the <openssl/opensslv.h> file.. I think you have the best shot at getting help by asking your question at https://termux.com/community!. Just to check: This problem is only when trying to use storage/, and not the internal storage where $HOME is by default?. Hello and thanks! External storage does not allow executable permissions, so this would unfortunately not work for the installed binaries.\nFor the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission, this is already granted implicitly by Any app that declares the WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is implicitly granted this permission.. Thanks a lot! This has been fixed in version 0.35 of the termux-tools package, to which you can update with\napt update && apt upgrade. This is not supported on Android, unfortunately. @Auxilus I think this was fixed by https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/723. Hm, is this on MIUI Launcher (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.i.miui.launcher)? But that one is at version 1.0.4 and doesn't look like that for me?. Aha, thanks!. @SmartFinn I agree, looks like the current icon doesn't comply with material design spec for launcher icons. Thanks for the help here!\n\nCould you try installing a simple test app at https://fornwall.net/icon-test.apk and see if that icon looks ok (it's a simple empty app that does nothing, with a new Termux icon with tweaked size)?. Is this problem generic to all Android apps running on ChromeOS, or specific to Termux?. Right, the external storage on Android does not permit executable files.\nOther parts (non-executable files) could be stored there, but I don't now if there is any easy robust way to do that in a general way from Termux side, so that should perhaps be left up to users to do case by case.. Run apt update && apt upgrade to install the latest version of all installed packages!. Hm, it shouldn't try to fetch version 1.17 of command-not-found, the current version it 1.19.\nBut it seems that apt update hits a cached version. Could you try an:\napt update && apt upgrade\n\nagain, possibly on another network (perhaps switching from wifi to cellular or vice versa)? If that does not fix it, does\napt update --fix-missing  && apt upgrade --fix-missing\n\nwork?. @lynnellemmanuel Are you still having this (or similar problems), or did it start to work?\nIf the problem persists, it seems to be due to you not receiving an updated Package list. Could you run wget http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-i686/Packages && grep command-not-found_ Packages and paste the output?. @lynnellemmanuel Great, thanks!. Right, this is intended - the reasoning is that you probably take the wake lock to hold a background service awake (e.g. a web server or sshd), and if so you want to continue staying awake even with no terminal sessions.\nLet me know if you want to modify this behaviour (and if so, why) - otherwise the current behaviour remains (and we can add information about it to the help pages). . This issue was moved to termux/termux-api#69. This issue was moved to termux/termux-api#68. Hi! Can you check which shell you are running by running ps $$?\nCould you specify steps how to reproduce the problem!. @fbartels Good point!\n@GreenJoey Can you check if your problem is fixed if you try a simple prompt, like export PS1='$ '?. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#900. Interesting idea! Any opinions? @Neo-Oli?. This is now available in version 0.47 of the Termux app, which should be available as an update shortly! Thanks @memeplex for the suggestion!. Hello! See https://termux.com/storage.html about the termux-setup-storage command.. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#798. @hnmn Does the above suggestion by @zlfera to add the tzinfo-data gem work?. A good idea. I wonder if this could be done always (for every shortcut launch), or if it needs opt in/out to allow multiple sessions for one shortcut? Opinions?. This issue was moved to termux/termux-widget#12. @toloveru Thanks for the update! Which ROM was it you had problems with?. @roccomuso If you are sure that you have no custom init files (like ~/.profile or similar) I think the best thing is to get a clean install - run\nrm -Rf $PREFIX\n\nin a failsafe session (se @Neo-Oli:s reply above), exit all sessions and restart Termux. This causes a clean Termux install while keeping your home folder.. Thanks! This will be enabled in the next update (v0.49) which will be pushed as an update shortly.. As there are several Termux users not using storage permissions, this is an opt-in through the termux-setup-storage command.. What does the dialog box say? Can you check that you are running the latest Termux version (0.48)?. Could you fix this issue by disabling overscan: https://www.howtogeek.com/252193/hdtv-overscan-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-probably-turn-it-off/\nTermux currently doesn't use a margin to compensate for overscan, but it could be added.. The Home key in Termux:Float should be fixed by the just made version 0.8 update!\nFor future information: There is now a dedicated repo for Termux:Float at https://github.com/termux/termux-float!\n\nnode interpreter (package nodejs) becomes a real annoyance because of the history does not save any changes like bash does... even temporairly. (I don't know if standard behavior.)\n\nHm, this should work? Can you ensure that you have the latest package versions by running apt update && apt upgrade?. It's not possible at the moment.. There is fortunately a way to save your data!\n\nPull out the drawer from the left.\nLong press on the NEW SESSION button.\nIn the resulting dialog, press the FAILSAFE button. This creates a limited shell using only the Android system tools.\nRun rm -Rf $PREFIX.\nExit all Termux sessions.\nStart up Termux again. You should now get a clean working install.\n\nNote that the above instructions assume that the files you want to save are under $HOME and not $PREFIX (as $PREFIX is normally used only for system files) - otherwise you would need to copy them from $PREFIX to $HOME before removing $PREFIX.\nLet me know if this works ok for you! . If you install a package using apt-get instead of apt the downloaded deb files should be cached in $PREFIX/var/cache/apt/archives.\nTry it out with (assuming that yasm is not already installed):\napt-get install yasm\nls $PREFIX/var/cache/apt/archives. This issue was moved to termux/termux-api#79. Which device? Custom rom or stock?. Thanks! However, I'm avoiding localization for Termux at the moment, as it is hard to maintain at a good quality, and the programs running in the Terminal itself aren't localized.. I would like gcc to be supported and work well on Android - but unfortunately it doesn't. Upstream doesn't support Android and google has dropped support for gcc targeting Android.\n\nGiven that, gcc as a symlink to clang is probably the best solution (a lot better than not having gcc at all) for most users, as it doesn't break their workflow and makes installing things using tarballs/pip/gem/npm/etc mostly work. macOS also does it and it works for many users there as well.\nSo not an ideal, but hopefully a pragmatic setup.. For those really requiring gcc in Termux, @its-pointless is hosting gcc in a third-party repository.. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#899. Can you try again?. It's a recurring problem with cache eviction (from the Cloudflare content distribution network that termux.net uses) for the Package index files not working reliably without delay. I'm looking at other options to avoid this in the future.. By default zsh in Termux is not visually different from bash - you are probably running zsh without seeing it.\nYou can check this by running echo $ZSH_VERSION to show the zsh version.\nYou might then want to install oh-my-zsh - that will bring some flair to zsh. Run apt install curl git to get the prerequisites, then run\nsh -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fornwall/oh-my-zsh/etc-shells-may-not-exist/tools/install.sh)\"\n\nNote that you need to install it from a special URL as in the above before https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/pull/4564 gets fixed in oh-my-zsh upstream.. @Neo-Oli Hm, TERM_PROGRAM and TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION would only indicate the terminal emulator used, so if e.g. ssh:ing into Termux it would indicate the terminal emulator used, not Termux.\nPerhaps we (also) need something like a TERMUX=0.49 environment variable to indicate that we are running inside Termux regardless of terminal emulator used?\nOr something else more standard, perhaps change uname -o to return Termux instead of Android? Any ideas/opinions?. As @its-pointless says, in Termux the package is libxslt-dev (we generally avoid version numbers in package names).\nZlib is part of the Android platform, so you get that one for free and can compile against it as long as you have clang installed.\nThird party repositories can be added by editing $PREFIX/etc/apt/sources.list, but note that you cannot use Debian repositories but must use repositories specific to Termux - there aren't that many around yet (but we should probably have a central place for listing them soon).. Hm, I thought temporary-file-directory was already patched to be $PREFIX/tmp by default.\nSome things to try out1\n\n\nCan you check the output of apt-cache show emacs | grep Version to verify that you are running the latest version 25.1-2?\n\n\nHow are you launching emacs? Directly or using emacsclient (or anything special)?\n\n\nShould creating ~/.emacs with the content (require 'org) be enough to reproduce the issue, or do I need to do something more (warning: I'm not an emacs user normally)?. This issue was moved to termux/termux-float#1. Termux already sets android:supportsRtl=\"false\" in the AndroidManifest.xml, I'm not sure how to disable bidi functionality when using the GNU FreeFont (if possible).\n\n\nWould really appreciate help from anyone more knowledgeable with bidirectional text on Android here.. @zelhar Hm, mTextPaint is an instance of the android.graphics.Paint class, so doesn't have a setTextDirection method.. It's probably due to caching at the cloudflare (which Termux uses as a CDN) - can you try again and see if running apt update works? If not, wait a couple of hours and try yet again :).. @Quasic Does it work now if you perform an apt update && apt upgrade again?. From an issue on the Google issue tracker:\n\nStatus: Won't Fix (Intended Behavior)\nThank you for filing this bug report. \nThe removal of /proc/stat was intentional. /proc/stat leaks side channel information about applications which could allow one application to infer the state of other applications on the device. See https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lmrs2/publications/interrupts_pets16.pdf for example.\n\nSo this is indeed an intended change in Android 0.. Are you sure that just having\nbash\n: << 'SKIP'\nsome text\nSKIP\nin a file is enough to trigger it (I cannot reproduce that), or do you have anything more in the script that could cause this?. @dogear42 I still think we need to see (at least the relevant part of) ~/someScript here.. @kzlin129 Thanks! Does it still work with developer preview 4 and makes sense to merge?\nIf so, could you expand the comment Launch activity automatically on boot to something like Launch activity automatically on boot on Android Things devices - then I'll merge it!. Merged, thanks!. Hi! Do you mean the terminal emulation part or the packages?. Thanks - TMPDIR is exported starting with version 0.49 of Termux, which has just been released and should be available as an update shortly!. The newly released v0.58 of the Termux app now supports resizable windows when in Dex mode! The update should be available as an update within an hour or so on Google Play and a day or so on F-Droid.\n@twoboxen Sorry about #433 - you were right in that it was resizeableActivity=\"true\" which was needed. I still don't understand why it is needed as it should be the default value when the target API is 24+ (could it be a Samsung bug perhaps), but anyway it works now.. It seems that you are using oh my zsh which adds fancy prompts such as these - try running e.g. bash if you want to have a shell with an ordinary prompt.\nNote that this repo is for https://termux.com/, an Android app, and not really the right place for this issue.. The wget program that is pre-installed with Termux is a lightweight version from busybox - to install the fully featured GNU wget version supporting https and more options run:\npackages install wget. @v0idst4r Try running `hash -r` before running `wget` again. This clears the bash path cache so that new executables are found.. @Rudloff Seems the root cause is the same as https://github.com/termux/termux-float/issues/4, and the linked F-Droid issue https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/issues/288 there.\n\nI've tagged a 0.50 version update with android:extractNativeLibs changed back to true and see if that fixes the F-Droid build issue - let me know if you are able to install that version from F-Droid (we will have to wait a while for the F-Droid build to pick up the new version).. @ckcin Normally I think F-Droid builds release once a day, but in this case updates to Termux has been disabled from F-Droid:s side due to issue with the build of 0.49 being broken.\nI've asked for the build of v0.50 to be enabled in https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/issues/288, hopefully that will get resolved soon!. @rmenessec Play Store releases are not affected, as I build those myself and test them - the problem here is with F-Droid building some apps. If you are having problem installing Termux from Play Store it's probably due to trying to mixing/switching between a Termux app from F-Droid and Google Play, which won't work due to different signatures.\nTo switch between F-Droid and a Play Store installation (either way), first fully Termux and all Termux:* add-on apps before installing from the new source.. The packages command is basically to run apt update before doing an actual operation.\nIt's a lot easier to inform users about running packages install xxx or packages upgrade instead of always having to remember to run an apt update first.\nIt would be best if we could configure apt itself to always do that, but if we still need a wrapper script for that I think the suggestion to have a shorter name such as pkg for it is a good one!. Thanks - pkg is now the preferred short name if you update to the latest version of the termux-tools!\nThe old alias packages is kept around for compatibility, at least for now.. Thanks for reporting! It's an issue with the F-Droid build, you can track https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/319 for progress there!. @soaringowl2145 Would you be ok with installing from F-Droid where Termux is available?. @biazzotto Installing from F-Droid should work now:\n\nMake sure to update and install the latest version (0.50) as the previous version was broken in F-Droid.\nIf you have installed Termux or any Termux add-on through the Play Store, be sure to completely uninstall all them, as you cannot mix installs from the Play Store with those from F-Droid.\nNote that the app requires Android 5.0 or later.. As @its-pointless says, it is indeed a system limitation, so unfortunately nothing can be done from the Termux side on this.. Thanks a lot - this is included in the v0.51 update that is now rolling out as an update!. Thanks a lot - this is included in the v0.51 update that is now rolling out as an update!. Termux got pulled from Google Play because it violates the payments policy.\n\nUnfortunately no more specific information were given, but I suspect the donate link in the app description caused the issue. Will read up on the payment policy of google play and submit an updated description without the donate link, so hopefully it will be put back!. Good news - the app is up again after removal of the donate link (try again in a few hours if not, it could be caching issues if it doesn't work)!. Looks great!\n\nThis addition should not interfere with Android 6+'s split screen feature.\n\nI guess this should be Android 7, as that was the version that introduced split screen AFAIK (https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window.html)?\nFor my understanding: Does this affect also Samsung devices running Android 7.0 or later (does it change/improve the multiwindow handling on that version, or does Samsung just use the built-in Android multiwindow support as of 7.0+ regardless of the com.sec.android.support.multiwindow meta-data)?. @bumper314 Thanks a lot - this will be available in a v0.52 update available later today!. Thanks a lot!\nIs it necessary to call setContentDescription(getText()) on each render call, or would it be enough to only call it when updating the screen in TerminalView.onScreenUpdated()?. @pvagner I'm really sorry for forgetting about this one, and I would really like to see it included!\nCould you (or anyone else interested) have a look at enabling this only if accessibility services are enabled (or something similar), as this may slow down the app needlessly if not?\nPerhaps with something like this in the TerminalView constructor\njava\nprivate boolean mAccessibilityEnabled;\n[...]\npublic TerminalView(Context context, AttributeSet attributes) {\n[...]\n    AccessibilityManager am = (AccessibilityManager) context.getSystemService(ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE);\n    mAccessibilityEnabled = am.isEnabled();\nand then guarding the call with if (mAccessibilityEnabled) setContentDescription(getText());. Would this work?. Thanks a lot!\nIt's beyond the scope of this immediate change, but could you give some pointers about possible next steps to improve accessibility support?. Thanks a lot, both for this change and the suggestions for further improvements!. .. and termux-wake-unlock. As the termux-tools package comes preinstalled this is available out of the box!. log2 is in libm on Android, not in libc.\nWhich Android version are you running on? This might be https://github.com/android-ndk/ndk/issues/201.. @eggcaker You should avoid installing packages as the root user (it shouldn't bring any benefits, and may cause various problems)!\nYou can force a re-installation of $PREFIX by removing it as root (rm -Rf $PREFIX), exit all terminal sessions and start Termux again. This will cause a clean install, just like re-installing the app, but keeping the $HOME directory intact.. @kr1shnas The $HOME/storage folder is inside Termux, so not normally shown in a file explorer.\nInside Termux you can run ls $HOME/storage to see the contents there - does that work?. Ok, that should be as intended then - the folders are just symlinks into folders in the shared storage directory, such as this in a device of mine:\ndcim -> /storage/emulated/0/DCIM/\ndownloads -> /storage/emulated/0/Download/\nexternal -> /storage/3364-3732/Android/data/com.termux/files/\nmovies -> /storage/emulated/0/Movies/\nmusic -> /storage/emulated/0/Music/\npictures -> /storage/emulated/0/Pictures/\nshared -> /storage/emulated/0/\nIf dcim, music and movies are empty that just means that you haven't put any files there.\nYou can chat at https://gitter.im/termux/termux or #termux on freenode if you want to discuss more!. I'm going through open PR:s, sorry for the huge delay here. I don't think this is relevant anymore due to the native Android multi-window support now - let me know if I'm wrong!. The NeoTerm source code is now available at https://github.com/NeoTerm/NeoTerm/ under the GPL3 license (an attribution notice somewhere would have been nice, but the most important thing here is the license and source code availability).. See https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/88 - it would probably come as an extension to termux-api.. This should be fixed now - it was a problem after a web server migration for increased capacity. Does it work for you now?. It's not possible at the moment to send an intent, but it would be nice to add one using custom permissions!. Thanks a lot - this arm issue has been fixed in version 4.8.19-1 of the mc package which is available as an update now!. Note that there are two other solutions:\n\n\npkg install termux-exec which will make /usr/bin and /bin shebangs work (for new Termux sessions - quit the current one). See https://github.com/termux/termux-exec for more.\n\n\npkg install proot and run termux-chroot, which will set up a chroot-like jail.. Sorry, what is T UI? Could you explain a bit more?. In general you need to specify --user 0 when calling am under Termux.. I think you should open an issue at https://github.com/Neo-Oli/termux-ubuntu. You should be really careful when running under root in Termux (and Android in general), this will break things such as apt and pip, and there is no point in doing so - you can install Termux packages fine without being root.\n\n\nIn the future we may add a warning to the pkg command to avoid it being run as root by mistake, for now one just have to avoid it.. Run pkg update to install updated system libraries (which includes libc++).. Hi! I think asking the question on https://plus.google.com/communities/101692629528551299417 or https://groups.io/g/termux/ would be a better place to get answers!. Hello! I think you are more likely to get an answer on https://plus.google.com/communities/101692629528551299417, https://groups.io/g/termux/ or a metasploit forum!. Unfortunately AFAIK the ARC welder app is too limited to run Termux on, and you would need to await official Google Play on the device!. Hello! I think you are more likely to get help asking the question at https://plus.google.com/communities/101692629528551299417 or https://groups.io/g/termux/.. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#1295. Track https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/45 for progress in packaging openjdk.. Support for the root user is outside the control of Termux - you need to ask the provider of your ROM / root tool for that!. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#1546. Could you report the issue against https://github.com/termux/proot, and write down more information in an issue created there:\n\nWhich devices do you see the problem on?\nWhich Android versions and ROM:s do they run?. I'm closing this as it doesn't seem to be something that the Termux app can solve.. AFAIK it's not possible without root.. Thanks!. Report the issue against https://github.com/cswl/tsu (and look at the tsu script to investigate).. Closing this in favour of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/299. Thanks for the suggestion - you can track https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/908 that already exists for phantomjs.. Termux uses utf-8 in the app, it really seems to be a problem with the emacs package - subscribe to https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/1088 for that one!. About chsh: The chsh script used in Termux does not expect a path, but the name of a shell in under $PREFIX/bin/. So if you have installed zsh you should run chsh -s zsh.\n\nAbout the permission issues: Have you run apt or dpkg as root? You should most probably not do that, as it doesn't bring any advantages but means problems. Try ensuring that everything under /data/data/com.termux/files/usr is owned by the normal Termux user.. Did the permission problems in Termux start after updating the ChromeOS version on the device?\nI recall some problem with how ChromeOS handled updates and file permission in Android apps - it was a problem that shouldn't occur for future updates in that case.\nFeel free to open a new issue if you encounter the problem again!. Thanks!. See https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Main_Page#Contact for where to ask questions and receive help!. Will look into it - subscribe to https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/105 to be notified of progress!. Sorry, but the app is currently not trying to be localized!. When you are standing looking at the failed shell session:\n\nPull out the navigation drawer by swiping in your finger from the left.\nLong press the NEW SESSION button.\nPress the FAILSAFE button in the resulting dialog.\n\nThis leaves you with a basic session using the built-in Android shell. Try moving away your dotfiles (perhaps ./profile or /.bashrc) and start up a new session!. See https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Differences_from_Linux#Prefixed_System. See https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/105. As @pp3345 says this attribute should already default to true:\nIf your app targets API level 24, but you do not specify a value for this attribute, the attribute's value defaults to true.\n\nFrom https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window.html.\nSo dex problems should come from something else.. @twoboxen Sorry about this - you were right in that it was resizeableActivity=\"true\" which was needed. I still don't understand why it is needed as it should be the default value when the target API is 24+ (could it be a Samsung bug perhaps), but anyway it works now.. I currently think that the wiki is the way forward, and that the advantages of having information that can be easily updated and contributed to outweighs the risks.\nLet's try it out, if there is a serious problem we can always switch back or to something else.\n. I think the best way forward is asking for help on a nmap forum!. This is not needed - the login script takes care of running the right shell (the fallback to bash or zsh is a historical note for old Termux systems that haven't been updated in the last year and doesn't have login).. I'm closing this in favour of continued discussion in https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/1618. Right - let's close this for #12 . What is the output of uname -m?\n\nSub-process https received a segmentation fault\n\nIf so, could you try disable all https repos, run pkg update once to receive the latest updates, and then enable the https repos again and see if that improves things?. The problem is that /system/bin/am, which termux-setup-storage uses to launch android intents from the command line, doesn't seem to work from apps in android 8. Subscribe to https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/1578 to be notified about progress.. An updated ffmpeg package which includes glob functionality is now available at version 3.3.4-2!\n@EricInCD Update to it with pkg up and report any problem!. Does the command\nsvn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin/trunk spamassassin\n\nwork for you?\nWhich arch are you running (output of running uname -m) and which android version?. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#1897. Raw sockets is just not allowed without rooting - nothing we can do in Termux unfortunately.. Closing this in favour of #309.. Termux is just a terminal emulator and a set of command-line programs running directly on the system. So it runs on top of the normal Linux kernel provided by the Android system.. Could you check if updating to the latest version 0.54 of the Termux app fixes the issue? It has just been released so should be available as an update shortly.. @justinkelly Have you tried the update?. Thanks for the interest! Note that github issues is not the best forum for this, try any of the following channels instead:\n\nGoogle+ community: https://termux.com/community\nMailing list: https://groups.io/g/termux/\nGitter: https://gitter.im/termux/termux\nIRC: #termux on freendoe. @kurokirasama Hm, even #!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash doesn't work?\n\nIs something wrong with your bash binary? Does running bash work?. @kurokirasama Aha, great that you got it figured out!. Just a wild shot, but does running apt clean fix anything?. Thanks for reporting!\nCan you check if the just released version 0.3 of Termux:Tasker fixes the issue? It should be available as an update from Google Play within a few hours max (and from F-Droid within a day or two).. I think the easiest way to restore functionality is to use a failsafe session (see https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Recover_a_broken_environment) to remove every installed package (by running rm -rf $PREFIX), exiting all sessions and restarting Termux again.\nThis will cause a new setup of packages, and you have to install everything but the non-essential packages again. But the data in $HOME is not affected.\nLet me know if there is any problem!. Thanks! This will be in the next v0.55 release.. See https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/299 - it's basically a limitation of android 8.0.. Thanks - this is an issue when running Termux under Android 8. Subscribe to https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/1578 for progress!. @F0RIS I think it's easier to chat about this than discuss it on a github issue - join https://gitter.im/termux/termux or contact me directly on gitter!. Thanks for reporting! This was an issue when running Termux under Android 8 which has been fixed in the newly released version 0.55, which should be availalbe as an update within a few hours max!\nLet me know if the problem remains after v0.55.. Hello! Please use https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/101692629528551299417 for questions such as these!. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#1896. Right, we should really start using the last stable release and stop building from master. I leave this issue open, as it may still be a problem with the terminal emulation in Termux exposed by recent neovim updates.. Updating to the latest git master (in version 0.2.3~2017.11.29 of the package, which is now available) fixed the problem.\n@Neo-Oli Let's switch to released versions starting with 0.2.3 when that is final!. Thanks! This is an issue when running on Android 8 which will soon be addressed - subscribe to https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/1578 for progress!. > However, sometimes for some unknown reason the movement of the finger is interpreted as \"pinch zoom\" gesture and the font size is increased or decreased.\nHm, I would guess that is when double tapping - Android translates \"double tap and move finger up or down\" to zooming (try e.g. in the browser).. @tigran123 In version 0.57 of the Termux app, which has been released and should be available as an update on Google Play within an hour or so (and on F-Droid within a day or so), the interpretation of \"double tap and swipe finger\" as zoom has been disabled.\nWhile really a standard Android behaviour, most users seem to hit it by mistake.\nThanks a lot for the feedback!. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#1895. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#1894. What is the output of running getprop ro.product.cpu.abilist?. It could be a device whose cpu is able to run 64-bit code, but the manufacturer decided to only install a 32-bit android system om it.. I'm unable to reproduce this on a fresh checkout of the project using Android Studio 3.0.1.\nWhich Android Studio version are you running?\nCan you check that you have the Use default gradle wrapper (recommended) option selected in Preferences > Build, Executation, Deployment > Gradle?. I'm closing this as I (and several other I checked with) were unable to reproduce it, which indicates a local problem - check https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-163366? Let me know if I can help in any way!. > 1) Limit the LINES value, so that it's never higher than the number of\nvisible lines, as in line = min(line, number_of_lines).\n\n2) Ignore clicks in this area. One scenario is that the user is typing on\nthe keyboard and touches the keys a little bit too high.\n\nThanks! I went for (1) now, so that click on the terminal-coloured area are always sent to the terminal. The change will be out in a v0.59 update of the app, which will be available within an hour or so on Google Play and within a day or so on F-Droid.. You seem to be hitting this block in pty_setowner() from sshpty.c:\nc\nif (st.st_uid != pw->pw_uid || st.st_gid != gid) {\n        if (chown(tty, pw->pw_uid, gid) < 0) {\n                if (errno == EROFS &&\n                    (st.st_uid == pw->pw_uid || st.st_uid == 0))\n                        debug(\"chown(%.100s, %u, %u) failed: %.100s\",\n                            tty, (u_int)pw->pw_uid, (u_int)gid,\n                            strerror(errno));\n                else\n                        fatal(\"chown(%.100s, %u, %u) failed: %.100s\",\n                            tty, (u_int)pw->pw_uid, (u_int)gid,\n                            strerror(errno));\n        }\n}\n\nWhich arch is this on (what is the output of uname -m)?\nWhat is the output of running ls -la $(tty) and whoami in your normal Termux terminal?\n\nYou didn't run sshd as root, right?. @kracejic Just to check, you're running with a hardware keyboard right?. Closing this in favour of adding it to termux-api.. If you cannot repair the system easily, I think the best course of action is to start a failsafe session as noted above, and then run\nrm -Rf $PREFIX\n\n\nThen exit the session and restart Termux, after which a new system installation will be done.\nYou will loose all installed packages (but you can of course just reinstall them with pkg install ..., but your $HOME dir will be left intact, so you shouldn't loose any important data.. This should now be fixed in the latest 4.4-1 version of the hashdeep package - install with pkg up.\nUnfortunately this updates requires Android 7.0 or later for 32-bit arches (arm and i686) to work correctly.. Thanks a lot! It will be in the next version, v0.60, which will be available as an update within a day or so!. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#2033. I'm unable to reproduce it, and it sounds really strange.\nCould it be something else? The mpv was perhaps not running when in landscape mode?. Thanks to @l-jonas the latest version of pkg now bails out with an error when run as root!. See https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Community for where to get possible help!. $PREFIX/bin/ping is just a wrapper for calling /system/bin/ping. This system binary seems to be 32-bit even on some 64-bit systems, so I think we should unset LD_PRELOAD before calling a system binary here. I've done that it in https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/commit/6b54ba3b69f4db1a7ba850e5459bfac08b275c46 now, in version 0.50 of termux-tools.\n@asynio Can you verify that updating to the latest termux-tools package version (0.50) with pkg up fixes the problem?. I think it looks good!. I'm fine with a PR! We can release it and see what people think.. This should now be fixed after you update installed packages with pkg up. Thanks for reporting!. Terminals just won't work with non-monospaced fonts, they are designed to expect a uniform grid.\nTermux tries to stretch non-monospace fonts to equal width for all characters. It will work if there is only an occasional glyph that needs to be stretched, but with a fully non-monospaced font it will just look ugly as shown above. The only solution is to use a monospaced font.. Try unset LD_PRELOAD before executing the 32-bit binary.\nTermux uses LD_PRELOAD=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/libtermux-exec.so to inject a shared library which overrides exec() so that normal shebangs (#!/bin/sh and similar) works, but that does not work when trying to execute 32-bit binaries, as the library is 64-bit.. > * The following required packages can not be built:\n\n\nfreetype, png\n\n\nFrom that output I think you need to pkg install freetype-dev libpng-dev.\nThis issue tracker is probably not the right forum for troubleshooting this, see https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Community for where you can ask around for help!. @tgc12 Thanks for reporting! Try opening an issue at https://github.com/cswl/tsu to get help!. @vczilla Nice description of the problem!\n\nWell guess which ioctl gets called by Termux when dropping into a su shell?\n0x5404\n\nIs this call made by the Magisk binary, so a fix has to be applied there? Or is it anything Termux can do here?. @vczilla Thanks a lot for the nice investigation! Can you open an issue there and link to that issue from here? I'm closing this then, as it's nothing we can do from the Termux side.. @Quasic Thanks a lot, and sorry for the delay here! This will be available in the next update (v0.62) which will be released in a few days.. Thanks for reporting!\nCould it be a general bug that happens when the terminal size is beyond a certain size (as measured in columns and rows)? What is your terminal size (the output of stty size)?. It seems to be a single python file (https://github.com/susmithHCK/torghost/blob/master/torghost), so it doesn't seem to be worth packaging!. > stack Error: Can't find Python executable \"python\", you can set the PYTHON env variable\nTry pkg install python to install the python package. You will probably need to install some -dev packages as well.\nThe issue tracker is probably not the best forum for this - see https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Community for where you can ask around for help!. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#2236. @xqdoo00o Awesome work and sorry for the delay! This will be available in the next update (v0.62) shortly!. After merging https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/pull/2239 this should now be fixed by version 25.3-2 of the emacs package, which is just a pkg up away.\nNice work in finding this!. I'm sorry, but this will not happen, it's simply not worth the effort!. Thanks! The TerminalRenderer class needs some love and cleanup, but having it public doesn't do any harm and allows projects such as yours to experiment with it.. @michalbednarski Sorry for the delay here! Looks interesting, nice gains without messing up the code.\nI think mHasNonOneWidthOrSurrogateChars should be reset to false the clear() method, since otherwise over time all rows will end up having this set to true (as lines are reused after a while in the circular buffer).. Thanks! This will be in v0.62 of the app, to be released in a few days.. In the upcoming v0.66 release the $PREFIX/tmp folder will be purged at cold start as https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/768 has now been merged!. As @xeffyr says the current apt package uses https.\n@earboxer: Try updating to latest package versions (run pkg up) and see if that replaces http with https? If not you may have modified sources.list manually, in which you need to manually replace http with https.. @robertvandeneynde Sorry for the delay here! Now that #605 has been merged, could you look at rebasing your changes on top of that?. https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/pull/2299 have now been merged and the updated version 6.0.0-1 will be available shortly (as soon as it's done building), so I'm closing this.\nGreat work @its-pointless !. Thanks! The gzip package for i686 has been fixed in https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/commit/f2e379953db76d37227e9e9e519ee0c49a3d9a11 (version 1.9-2)!. I'm closing this issue as it doesn't seem to be specific to Termux. I'm also noticing the wish to use it as a Home app :).. Sorry for the late reply here! I don't want to add in-app purchase to the app, it feels wrong for this kind of app. Feel free to donate to a charity instead :).. Sorry, this app is english only for now!. Thanks! Should perhaps \\r\\n be replaced with \\r first /which the iTerm comment indicates)?. Thanks a lot! This will be available in a v0.61 update which will be available shortly.. This has been fixed in version 0.61 of the app, which has now been released and should be available in Google Play within a few hours (and on F-Droid within a day or so)!\n. Thanks!. Thanks! Fixed by https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/716.. Thanks! This has been fixed in version 0.61 of the app, which has now been released and should be available in Google Play within a few hours (and on F-Droid within a day or so)!. Thanks!. The fix by @zevv in #794 has been released in version 0.65 of the app and should be available as an update shortly.\nThanks for all the work here, let us know if anything can be improved!. Thanks!. That was bad. I'm so sorry for this critical issue!\nThis has been fixed in version 0.63, which has been submitted to the Play store as an update. The release has been tagged so should be available also on F-Droid soon.. Thanks to everyone involved who reported and helped with understanding and fixing the problem! . Wow, that was a bad issue.. Thanks a lot!. Did you perhaps use fish as shell? See this page: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Recover_a_broken_environment\n. Thanks!. Thanks!. Thaknks for reporting! Seems to be hitting this issue: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20455. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#2622. This is now rolling out in version 0.65 of the app! Let's see how the feedback goes, and then we can proceed to update the old non-adaptive icon as followup work.\nThanks for the work @lokesh-krishna!. This issue was moved to termux/proot#25. Closed in favour of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/1798, track that issue!. Closed in favour of #794.. @robertvandeneynde Thanks a lot, and sorry for the delay!\nI'll try it out during the coming couple of days and make a release shortly.. You could try ffprobe from ffmpeg!. Thanks!. Thanks! This is now available in v0.65 of the app, which has been released and is rolling out as an update.. Thanks!. Closing as supporting static linking inside Termux is currently out of scope.\n\nbut will the app built with clang++ work with another versions of libc on different android mobiles ? On windows msvcrt is available with every windows installation .\n\nlibc provides a stable API. By default the compiler in Termux currently targets API level 21 (Android 5.0), so you may use symbols not available on earlier versions. Compile with e.g. -D__ANDROID_API__=16 to target an earlier API version.\n\nAnd how can I chip the c++ library for earlier android versions when I use c++11 features and later c++ features ?\n\nSee https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpp-support to read up on the C++ situation on Android!\n. Hi! Due to the amount of issues here, a better place to ask for questions is at the Google+ community or gitter chat.. @ttrash Thanks for reporting!\nuptime has now been removed from the latest 3.3.15-1version of the procps package, so Termux users should always get the working uptime from busybox in the PATH.. From @xeffyr on August 17, 2018 12:28\nSuch feature was removed a long time ago: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/commit/7c0ae4cb54cb98441d797348538e19eb315cfb21. From @feklee on August 20, 2018 9:7\nThat\u2019s sad. Simply inverting the display as supported by some terminal emulators would be sufficient.. Thanks!. Perhaps we should just remove the round non-adaptive icons?. @kisik21 Hi! I'm closing this issue as it isn't caused by the Termux app itself.\nFor getting help with proot, either open an issue at https://github.com/termux/proot/issues if you suspect an issue in proot, or ask for help on on the Google+ community or the Gitter chat.. The ruby segmentation fault should be fixed in the 2.5.1-3 update of the ruby package. Run pkg up to update!. Thanks! I've removed the link now and kept the link to the Wiki, which replaces the old help pages.. I'm closing this as there are quite some conflicts now.\n@TacoTheDank Some of the changes look good, but please try to split up unrelated changes into several PR:s if possible, that makes reviewing and integrating the changes a lot easier!. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#2892. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#2923. This issue was moved to termux/termux-packages#2922. Do you get it for all host or just a specific one?\nTry out using ping from inside .e.g Terminal Emulator for Android - if the problem is the same there this is a general issue with your phone and not Termux specific.. I'm closing this as it seems to not be a Termux issue. Let us know if you find out otherwise @fracalhub !. Thanks!. termux-clipboard-get/set support should probably be moved into the main Termux app and not require Termux:API, since these are basic useful operations which does not require any additional permissions in the core app.. Could you try out if this works better in version 0.66 of the app, which has just been released and should be available on Google Play within an hour or so, and on F-Droid within a day or two?. @brunelli Great, thanks! The other Termux apps will be updated the coming week to have adaptive icons as well on more devices.. @brubakerjeff Sorry for the delay here.\nThe main argument against merging this PR was that the current behaviour (to avoid drawing the background if not necessary) is actually intended, to avoid overdraw (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T52v50r-JfE) for performance and battery efficiency.\nSo AFAIK this change would be a workaround for broken graphics behaviour/driver for android on raspberry pi. Or do we believe the current code to be wrong?\nWith that said, I haven't actually measured if the overdraw avoidance actually improves efficiency in any meaningful way, I just looked at the android developer option and visually determined that overdraw was avoided.\n@brubakerjeff Can you re-check with the latest available Android version/build for the device and see if the system behaviour has improved (is this still necessary)?. @jarun Sure, nnn can depend on file!. @jarun This is now available in version 2.0.0-1 of the nnn package, which is the version available for installation now. Thanks!. I think supporting \\e[3J would be nice!. The updated package (version 2.1-1) which requires findutils is now available for installation!. This should now be fixed in version 1.20-1 of the wget package, which is available for installation!. I think supporting CSI 3 J would be nice!\nCould you look at the necessary changes to onScreenUpdated(), and also perhaps adding a test to ControlSequenceIntroducerTest?. Thanks! This will be part of the next release (v0.67) which will be made shortly.. When I test CodeBoard Ctrl+D (using the Control key from CodeBoard) it works to abort e.g cat for me? Is that still a problem for you @eekee ? . I think InputType.TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_VISIBLE_PASSWORD | InputType.TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS is a bit of a hack, EditorInfo.TYPE_NULL should be the correct one, right?\nHowever if the input change improves across keyboards I guess it's still a pragmatic change. Perhaps we could write down the behaviour for different keyboards here?\nAllowing the input type to be set in termux.properties with something like\neditor-type = TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_VISIBLE_PASSWORD | TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS\ncould allow for easier experimenting for users, and allow workarounds for odd keyboards to be done by users.. Hello and thanks for reporting the issue!\nSupport for libstdc++fs will be added when the Android NDK adds it (Termux pulls in standard C++ libraries from there). See https://github.com/android-ndk/ndk for progress there.. It could always be added if useful enough :).\n@longlu Could you describe your use case, how you would use it?. Hello and thanks for reporting! This is basically something that needs to be solved on the keyboard end, and not something that the Termux app itself has control over. You may want to try another keyboard if the issue is important for you.. @consultron Thanks a lot for the detailed information!\nBoth termux-open and termux-share has been changed to avoid this problem - does it work fine after updating packages with pkg up?. Thanks for reporting. This should now be fixed in updated packages!\nSee https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Recover_a_broken_environment for information about recovering a broken environment.. @DMSalesman Thanks for reporting, tree has now been updated!. @Auxilus notes that restarting fixes the issue.. Hello and thanks for reporting!\nThe beta program is not used for the Termux app. Unfortunately it can not be disabled in Google Play, AFAIK. But as you notice, there is just no point in joining the beta program for this app currently.. Thanks for reporting! This change will be part of the v0.67 update of the app which is to be released shortly.. We discussed this in a chat session (https://gitter.im/termux/dev) today, and I think this is a really interesting thing to have. Some notes from the chat:\nThe thing we want to minimise is the risk for evil apps to infect Termux installations (due to people ignoring/not understanding what the permission does). A conservative change could be to make this some kind of opt in, like requiring a property in termux.properties for this to be allowed\nso we both require that permission, but we also need something like external-apps-can-execute=*, or external-apps-can-execute=com.app1,com.app2.\nOr it could be a runtime permission. Perhaps a dialog like \"The app XXX is trying to run a script. Allow that?\" with a checkbox to remember the choice though that obviously complicates the code and also the user experience. Thoughts on that?\n@xeffyr: A dialog like \"The app XXX is trying to run a script. Allow that?\" with a checkbox to remember the choice seems better than termux.properties.\n@fornwall What I can't decide on is if that is necessary :). One point is that the app is a terminal emulator, users should be expected to a bit more technically skilled than an average app users and careful with accepting permissions.\n... On the other hand, if the effect of opening up permissions is that several users have e.g. their ssh/gpg private keys stolen or likewise, it's bad regardless of if those users can be blamed for not reading through permissions.\nFeedback, thoughts and ideas are welcome here! Even with the above said I'm leaning against merging this as is.. Thanks!. You should still protect the mRenderer.render() call and check for mEmulator == null.. Could you add a comment describing why this check is made (that the failsafe launcher icon doesn't show on Android TV)?. ",

I tried digging around a little but could not see what would be needed to solve the problem. Hopefully somebody smarter can look into it!. I'll leave an extra comment here in case anybody else wants to ssh into their termux ssh server. The IP address you'll need to use is 100.155.92.2 (not localhost) because the android subsystem is on a separate bridged interface.. This seems to be working fine on Chrome 61 on my Asus chromebook flip. Try updating and see if it magically works now.. I just noticed that while most keys are working great, for some reason the - and = keys (to the right of the numbered keys) are the only keys that are not using the dvorak layout. In dvorak they should be [ and ]\nIs anyone else who has a mostly working termux dvorak keyboard layout working noticing the same behavior? As stands there is no way to type any bracket characters!\nBy comparison, I just tried using google docs android app and I can use the labelled - key to type [ without problem.\nI am on a pixelbook..

I've been porting the D standard library to use bionic back to API 9 and have had few issues,  though only tested on actual devices back to API 16, ie 4.1 Jelly Bean, so far.  If you simply compile using the NDK compilers against an older API, Android maintains backward compatibility, so the resulting binaries should work on Android 4 (well, technically even back to Android 2).\n. @franciscod, if you did something similar to this, you might be able to use Arch linux arm packages, if you packaged glibc too.\n. Just downloaded the update and tried it out, works great!  Thanks, @bumper314.. I saw this on an HTC phone running Android 8.0 and a Samsung tablet running 6.0, both with the latest Termux release 0.60 from the Play store. As I said initially, it randomly happened so I'm not sure how to trigger it again, but the fact that I was seeing it on two devices suggested it was worth mentioning.\nAs for the nano command above, I tried it with vim and couldn't reproduce.. That is exactly the kind of junk chars I saw before with this bug, just not with the command you gave, with vim in place of nano.. Yeah, that sounds right: I commonly ssh into a VPS and run vim there, and the connection sometimes cuts out while editing a file. It could be both instances happened after such an ssh connection got cut.. No problem, I figured the editor didn't matter and just used my normal editor to test. Since this bug was hitting me from using vim remotely, that makes sense anyway.. ",

Might as well support that; they are almost identical and 4.1 has 7% usage, rather significant for Android.\nThere are only a few differences which usually can be fixed with reflection. It also supports PIE.\n. Besides, that's what AppCompat is for. \nUnless it's a NativeActivity. No AppCompatNativeActivity for us. :(\n. This issue still doesn't seem to be fixed.. I found that this seems to occur because the \\n characters are being interpreted as \\n instead of \\r or something like that.. Well, that is supposed to happen.\nTo the terminal, \\r is a special character that flushes and outputs a \\n. It is kind of like a <br/> in HTML.\nThis explains it well.\nOn the flip side, copying some raw \\r characters seems to have the correct result.. Assuming you have nano installed, does this cause that behavior?\n{ sleep 0.5; killall -KILL nano } & nano -m\nIf so, that is normal. Just hit Ctrl-C, then run reset.. So you don't see something like\n64;61;27M64;61;27M64;61;27M\n(numbers may vary) spammed to the console?\nAlso, please use the command I suggested. Put your editor preference aside, install nano (it is only 500 KiB installed), and tell me if that works. (Although, I was able to get the same effect with vim)\nFor an even more reliable case, try this version. This disables all things that could interfere with this test.\nenv -i PATH=\"/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/applets\" TERM=\"xterm-256color\" LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib\" dash -c '{ sleep 1; killall -KILL nano; } & nano -Im'\nAfter one second, when you see \"Killed\", try scrolling. It is expected behavior that a bunch of three semicolon-separated numbers followed by an uppercase M will be displayed each time you scroll, it is a terminal mode that fails to be reset when nano is killed.\nIf that isn't what you mean, if it ever happens again, could you send a screenshot?. So basically, what happened is that your terminal got stuck in alternate screen mode, which does that ugly thing. It was designed for ncurses applications like nano and vim to allow them to decode mouse events.\nAll ncurses programs are expected to call endwin() which will put the terminal back into a normal state. However, an ncurses program can't do that if it is abruptly stopped (from an unhandled segfault, a kill signal like the one I manually fired to cause this, broken ssh connection, or something similar). Because of this, the terminal will get stuck in this state. \nTo fix this, use this better command than the previous one:\ntput rmcup;stty sane;reset\nThis isn't a bug, it is entirely expected behavior. To show this, here it is in a few other terminals:\nClick to show\nTermux\n\niTerm2\n\nJack Palevich's Terminal Emulator for Android (it displays things a little differently)\n\nHyper\n\nTerminal.app\n\n. That too. I forgot about that because I rarely ever use ssh.. By the way, @joakim-noah, I don't mean to be harsh, but I just want to let you know that some people, especially in larger projects, can get really mad at you when you don't follow their steps exactly.\nI was only mildly annoyed.\nWhile most of the time, such as in this case, the specific steps include unnecessary or overly specific rituals like make clean or not using keyboard shortcuts, if this was, for example, bug #678, you wouldn't be able to reproduce it in vim because it handles pasting differently.\nI learned this lesson the hard way when I complained about a (completely pointless) make clean on a large project, and the feedback I got ruined my whole day.\nAgain, please don't take this personally. I just don't want anyone else to get the same treatment I did, because some people will get a lot harsher than this.\nI completely understand if you prefer using a different text editor.. This should do. Didn't want to build the whole thing, but I did a quick test:\njava\nString str = \"\\r \\r\\n \\n\";\nString str2 = str.replaceAll(\"\\r?\\n\", \"\\r\");\nif (\"\\r \\r \\r\".equals(str2))\n    System.out.println(\"PASS\"); .

There's been some similar issues in past. unset LD_PRELOAD before running su and the particular error regarding libtermux-exec should go away. . @kgaughan some devices, for example (some?) chromebooks, are 64 bit but install 32 bit android apps. pip and other package managers look at the architecture and see 64 bit though and uses that arch.\nSee for example https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2281 and https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/644.\nMight be the same in your case.. You can't run a pdf as if it was a bash script. bash /sdcard/Download/od.pdf expects od.pdf to contain bash commands.\nTo open it in another application, do xdg-open /sdcard/Download/od.pdf.. If you don't know what $HOME is then I strongly suggest that you look for a linux guide for beginners on some search engine and learn the basic stuff. @xeffyr @Quasic last apt update before this one also removed any imported keys, so it seems like the keys need to be re-imported on updates. @tomtom what's the purpose of switching it on and off?. @tomtom that makes sense. \nI might be possible already today to turn on/off bluetooth using am, but would require root unless some permissions are added to the app I think. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37259260/android-enable-disable-bluetooth-via-command-line. Try installing openssl-dev as well, worked on my device (got the same error without it).. And since Termux is an open-source project, anyone who has access to chromeOS can dig around in the app code, investigate what could be the issue, find a solution and open a pull request. . @nashv feel free to donate a chromebook to the termux team, that might speed up finding a workaround for this.\nAs already stated in this thread, debugging without the necessary hardware is not really possible. . @kasik96 awesome, thanks for sharing, I'll have a look if the problem is reproducible in the emulator.. @GreenJoey, I'm wondering the same as @natebass, doesn't LinuxDeploy require root and an extra partition on the external sdcard?. @wayofthefuture Could you elaborate a bit? What would you like to do, connect to a bluetooth device and do serial communication? . Closing this in favour of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/235. . The soft keyboard disappears automatically for me (on my samsung tablet) when connecting a hardware keyboard. Does it disappear if you tap the keyboard button in the left menu? \n\n. Ah, sorry, I read your question too fast... @Cvar1984 you can find the original trusted.gpg here: https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/blob/master/packages/apt/trusted.gpg?raw=true. packages install wget should solve the problem. Do you really have wget available?. Great that it works! \nThanks for you bug report. I thought I fixed this in #873 (so that busybox's wget would suffice) but apparently not.. This does not seem to be termux related, and you have opened the same issue at several places (here, here, here and here).\nedit: and here . @monkeyfunky see this stackoverflow question, scp -r user@server:\"/home/user/dir1/some\\ other\\ dir\" . or scp -r user@server:/home/user/dir1/some\\\\\\ other\\\\\\ dir . should work according to the top-voted answer. . @lynnard so for example M-x shell-command termux-open-url https://www.termux.net fails for you?\n(It works on my arm device).. @Monsieur-Moony We have a FAQ at the termux wiki, but this issue isn't covered (feel free to contribute).. @evildog1 gdb doesn't require root normally.. @evildog1 right, so you are trying to attach to a system process? Attaching to processes launched (as none-root) in termux work fine. \nThe environment setup by tsu seems to be faulty somehow, try setting PATH=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin:$PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib in the root environment.. @stormdragon2976 you can try this one: https://grimler.se/apps/termux-app-access.apk\nI have the other apps available from there as well, signed with the same key. \nI haven't tested it at all so it's great if you are willing to! . Does it work if you run export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib?. @azulkipli You need to copy the content of id_rsa.pub from your computer and add it to the device's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. Some android programming would be needed for this, in particular a termux-api addon. . @j-bennet Then it's some other file called by ~/.pyenv/libexec/pyenv that has a none-working shebang. Look through ~/.pyenv/libexec/pyenv and try to find out which one. \nYou could also grep for it: grep -rl '^#!\\s\\?/usr/bin/env' ~ but then lots of hits might turn up. . Do you have clang installed? pkg install clang. Well, obviously it worked cause now you get another error. \nNow it instead says that Python.h is missing. This file is provided by the package python-dev so do pkg install python-dev. @Deathlive Great! Could you then close the issue?. Install with LDFLAGS=\" -llog\" pip install .... Yes, run termux-setup-storage and after that it will work. . Might not be a related issue, but this issue reminded me of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/1088.\nThis question might be better suited for the termux-packages repo.. Sounds like this is a duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/250.. Could you link to where you read that? \nTermux can't provide a su binary in a package, it's impossible with androids security model.. Ah, no, sorry, you're correct, there's a su-file in termux-tools called su. However it is basically just a wrapper around a su binary that you have installed through other means, it won't give you superuser permissions. You need a rooted phone as you suggested.. @acrocephalus nmap -sn should work without su, all (almost?) termux binaries are set up to work without root.. Wouldn't this sort of undo the very thing that the exit message is suppose to do? \nIf a user breaks his environment then there would be no way to launch a failsafe terminal if the terminal exists immediately. \nMaybe it's possible to check for /sdcard/hushlogout instead, as @Neo-Oli suggested here . @juha-h have you installed the app \"termux-api\"? Try installing it instead of adding the microphone permission to termux-app . Tested on 8.0, rebased against master, seems to work :+1: . I'll close this as it seems to be solved. . @tukusejssirs you can get rid if the [[ error with \"$type\" instead of $type. That won't fix the second error though. Your device probably doesn't have the /system/etc/g.prop file. @neo2134 Which country are you in? Could be a firewall issue.. It's quite easy to copy the public key wrongly, please make sure that ~/.ssh/authorized_keys ends with an empty line and that your public key (in that file) doesn't have any line breaks. . @fivestrong I would not recommend sending the private key over any type of potentially unsafe communication (like a chat app). \nIn this case, I think the easiest way to copy the id_rsa.pub would be to log onto the laptop from the phone, copy the content of id_rsa.pub to the android clipboard and then paste it in authorized_keys (and potentially fix a few line breaks). \nAnyways, good that it works!. > /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lhdf5\nThis means that the compiler is trying to link against libhdf5.so but is unable to find that file. \nIt isn't available in any of the termux repositories as far as I know but you can always compile it yourself on device. It seems to be a bit cumbersome to cross-compile it unfortunately.\nI tried compiling it on my device and it was pretty straight forward, here's a small script:\n```\nNot entirely sure what dependecies we have, here's some guesses:\napt install clang libtool make\nFrom some folder in $HOME:\ncurl -L -O https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current18/src/hdf5-1.8.19.tar\ntar -xf hdf5-1.8.19.tar\ncd hdf5-1.8.19\nNeed a working TMPDIR, it isn't set properly in a ssh shell\nexport TMPDIR=$PREFIX/tmp\nNeed to replace config.guess script:\ncp $PREFIX/share/libtool/build-aux/config.guess bin/config.guess\nReplace /bin/sh with /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/sh\nfind . -type f -exec sed -i \\\n  's%    /bin/mv%    /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/mv%g' {} +\nfind . -type f -exec sed -i \\\n  's%SHELL = /bin/sh%SHELL = /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/sh%g' {} +\nfind . -type f -exec sed -i \\\n  's%CONFIG_SHELL-/bin/sh%CONFIG_SHELL-/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/sh%g' {} +\nmkdir build && cd build\ntermux-fix-shebang ../configure\nconfigure to install in /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/\n../configure --prefix=$PREFIX\nmake\nmake some directories that aren't automatically created for some reason:\nmkdir -p /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/share/hdf5_examples/{,hl}/c\nmake install\nWe need to tell python to look for HDF5 in /data/data/com.termux/files/usr\nHDF5_DIR=$PREFIX pip install tables\n```\n. @abbazs which arch are you on? This error doesn't seem to occur on arm or aarch64.. It looks like https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/206 is asking for the same thing (correct me if I am wrong). . @chenjiageng Which program are you using to open the files? Is it the same with other editors?\nI guess this might be an issue with the various packages available (or ncurses?) and perhaps not really with termux-app.. I did some testing and copied some random characters into a file and were opened them with emacs and vim without it looking weird:\n\nIt even looked correct when cat'ing the file.\nCould you explain in more detail how to reproduce the problem you're experiencing?. Are you root? Have you created the files as root? \nWhat are the permission of the file and folders? . If you have to ask then that's probably not the problem here.\nWhat exactly did you run to get that output?\nCould you please run \nls -l /data/data/com.termux/files/home/Tmux-Bunch/binder/is.apk \nand ls -l /data/data/com.termux/files/home/metasploit-framework/ and post the results here?. Sounds interesting. Do you have the sources available somewhere?. Which package(s) are you trying to upgrade?. Interesting. I would try to reinstall apt (and maybe dpkg) manually. You can download the .debs with wget or curl from http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-ARCH/apt_1.2.12-3_ARCH.deb and http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-ARCH/dpkg_1.18.24_ARCH.deb (replace ARCH with your architecture). Try installing apt with dpkg -i ./apt_1.2.12-3_ARCH.deb and similar for dpkg. \nHopefully that fixes it and you can then afterwards upgrade all packages from the repository. . Does pm --user 0 install works?. I would also suggest to move this issue/feature request to termux-api. All termux users won't have need for it and having it in (the optional app) termux-api then allows users to get the permission if they need it.. @ekant7 where in your internal memory? You're probably trying to chmod in /sdcard as Auxilus said which won't work due to Android being Android.. @ekant7 your questions aren't relevant to this issue. Please ask in the google+ group or at gitter instead.. By exiting termux you mean closing all sessions I presume? \nThat's comparable to logging out of all sessions on a normal Linux system (I.e. computer still running but no one logged into it), which would also leave services running.\nI could agree that this might not be intuitive though. We could consider writing \"close session\" or \"logout\" instead of exit. Let's see what other people think.. So that error is thrown but you are able to check for the libncursew.so.6 lib? \nHow? Fail-safe session? \nIt shouldn't be necessary to use termux as root, permission errors indicate that some other problem. Did you installing @angular/cli in the shared storage?\nSounds like you have messed up your environment. \n\nafter setting the respective environment variables.\n\nWhich env vars have you been playing around with? \n\nCANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE \"/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash\": library \"libncursesw.so.6\" not found\n\nMost likely mean that LD_LIBRARY_PATH isn't set correctly, so try making sure that it is set to /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib, maybe by exporting it in the .bashrc. . > But this time, I'm using everything without root\nSounds wise!\nThe environment variables that are termux specific are exported by the app: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/termux/app/BackgroundJob.java#L114\nAfter that, everything happens as on a normal Linux distribution, profile, .bashrc and other files are sourced (I'm not really an expert on when or which files are sourced). . @sdrausty @lokesh-krishna Devices with curved screens/infinity edges/whatever you want to call it, that black border is pretty much none-existing.\nIt is quite hard to mark text all the way to the edge, I agree that padding, or an option to add padding, would be nice. . Could you summarize a bit what this does? \nFrom looking at the code I assume it allows for connecting/disconnecting to devices through menu.\nIs there any particular reason why you choose to integrate it into the main app instead of into termux-api?. Hi @DoomyDwyer, \nI don't know much about android app-programming so @mjarvisal might very well be correct that it is not possible to implement this through termux-api (or as a new addon app) as far as I know. \nWe want to keep the permission list short for termux-app and let users that want these additional features install addon apps. If it isn't possible to implement it through an addon app then it this might not be merged unless a lot of users request it. \nStill, really nice work by @mjarvisal. \nIt would be nice if you (@DoomyDwyer) could rebase this and fix the conflicting files to simplify for users that want to build the app with this feature on their own. Which arch are you on (uname -a)? Seems to work fine on aarch64.. @Wolfram-Wolf yeah, arch linux packages are different, and out of our scope. \nI tried it in normal termux though, without problems. I can try it on arm later. \nMake sure that all of your packages are up to date. . I am able to reproduce the error on my arm device.. This seems to be a duplicate of this issue: https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/1733. Closing in favour of that one.. I would guess that it is due to lack of (free)-time that this and the other 147 issues (in this repo, and 322 in termux-packages) hasn't been resolved. \nI agree that it would be a nice feature and helpful for people that can't download the bootstrap, or that reinstall termux a lot as you said. \n242 isn't the best way to implement this though. It bloats the app a lot since zips for all arches are baked into it.\nI imagine instead getting a dialog where the user can either choose to download the zip from the normal url, write a custom url or choose a local file. \nBest way to speed up the incorperation of this feature would be if someone implemented it (properly) and opened a pull request. . more $(which pkg) gives:\n```\n...\nCMD=\"$1\"\nshift 1\ncase \"$CMD\" in\n        f) dpkg -L $@;;\n        h) show_help;;\n        add|i) apt update; apt install $@;;\n        list-a) apt list $@;;\n        list-i) apt list --installed $@;;\n        re) apt install --reinstall $@;;\n        se) apt update; apt search $@;;\n        sh) apt show $@;;\n        un|rem|rm|del) apt remove $@;;\n        up) apt update; apt full-upgrade;;\n        *) echo \"Unknown command: '$CMD' (run 'pkg help' for usage informatio\nn)\";;\nesac\n```\nBasically it is a wrapper around apt which runs apt update before trying to install something.\n. termux-exec takes care of this. Install with pkg install termux-exec, see the sources for more information.. This is most likely not a termux problem but rather a problem with your su. \nWhat does the logs of your su app say?. What did you run?. Which arch and so on are you on? uname -a\nWhich device is it on?\nWhat were you doing before it stopped working?. It's because you're syncing into shared storage and android doesn't allow certain properties there for security reasons.\nEither rsync to a folder in $HOME or ignore the error/warning. . What do you mean with \"when android refresh the termux app\"? Does android force-close termux?\n(In that case probably due to memory shortage or similar) I've not experienced the same issue and usually have termux sessions running for days.\nAs for local settings that you want in every session, you can put it in ~/.bashrc. \nThis file is sourced by every new terminal/session. \nIf you want to run a script/start a daemon/similar when you start your device then you can look into https://github.com/termux/termux-boot#termuxboot which aims at helping with this. \n. @tondy67 I can't say for sure why your device closes termux, but at least some android versions force-closes apps when the RAM is running out, could be that this is happening to you. \nAnyways, glad to be of help.. @f3flight Thanks.. Try fixing what it complains about, chown /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/var/lib/apt/lists/termux.net_dists_stable_InRelease to your termux UID. \nA small check in pkg is a good idea.. It's probably an issue with the su binary your using (and hence not related to termux). \nCheck the logs of the superuser app. See this quite recent issue: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/527.. Try running tsu or the /sbin/su and see if that gives another behaviour.. See https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Touch_Keyboard. \nCtrl + q (volume up+q) brings up those keys.. See https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Differences_from_Linux#Prefixed_System.\nSince termux is a prefixed environment you need to patch the sources and replace \"/tmp\" with /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/tmp.\nYou might/will probably run into similar problems related to /etc or /usr. \nWhy are you building the package instead of installing the one available through apt?. @Anoxia It would be way easier to cross-compile the package from docker/ubuntu if you have access to a computer.\nYou can use the working build script and tweak it however you want. \nSee the readme on how to setup a build environment in ubuntu or docker.. You will need to formulate a more understandable question than this I'm afraid.. You will need to provide a more thorough report than this if we are to be able to help.\n\nWhat did you run/how did you install?\nWhat output do you get?. I would guess that this is a duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2066.. Works fine for me, and has done so on the 3 or 4 different keyboards I've used. What kind of keyboard are you using?. Closing this in favour of https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/105.. Closing since https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2095 was opened. . /sdcard always points to internal storage, it is unrelated to termux. After running termux-setup-storage you have a folder ~/storage which contains symlinks to internal storage (~/storage/shared), sd card (~/storage/external-1) and some other places. Run ls -l ~/storage/ to see where the symlinks point.. @tgc12 check the logs in the su app and see if they say something.. Sounds like https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2066. There's an issue with some ROMs (on aarch64 and android 6?) and libtermux-exec.so. Workaround for now: rm $PREFIX/lib/libtermux-exec.so.. Ah yes, you might need to start a fail-safe session: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Recover_a_broken_environment#Launching_a_Failsafe_Session. You need to install the modules in $HOME, Android doesn't allow it in shared storage. See for example https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/43 and https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/1979.. /sdcard points to the standard internal storage (same as /storage/emulated/0), it doesn't point to the actual sdcard that you can insert/remove, so the two screenshots doesn't show the same folder. \n\nThe I/O error is still weird though.. Looks like you are downloading it into the shared internal storage. Android doesn't allow certain properties for files there for security reasons so unzip and many other programs output warnings/information like that when operating in shared storage. \nIf you would download into $HOME instead then that message isn't shown.. Yes, you get that warning/message in device storage/sdcard. \nTry for example: \n```\ncd $HOME \ntouch testfile\nchmod u+x testfile \nno message\ncd /storage/emulated/0\ntouch testfile\nchmod u+x testfile\nyou get something like: chmod: changing permissions of 'testfile': Operation not permitted\n``. See https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2066, work around is to start a [fail-safe session](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Recover_a_broken_environment#Launching_a_Failsafe_Session) and remove$PREFIX/lib/libtermux-exec.so. This should be fixed in updated version of termux-exec though. . @mayureshw You need to long press the \"new session\" button, not in the terminal.. Are you logged in to a ssh shell? TMPDIR seem to be missing. Tryexport TMPDIR=$PREFIX/tmp.. Your bashrc doesexport TMPDIR=/data/local/tmpso I can't see why apt tried accessing/tmp/`, \nmight be something we want to patch in apt. \nAnyways, good that it works again.. apt checks for the TMPDIR env dir and makes sure that folder exists and is readable. I'm not sure if /data/local/tmp is readable for non-root apps normally, it doesn't seem to be on my android nougat device. \nWhen apt can't read/write to your TMPDIR folder, it falls back to the default /tmp, and fails since this is termux. I'll open a pull request later and make it fall back to $PREFIX/tmp instead.. Every update of apt resets trusted.gpg meaning all imported gpg keys are lost. In your case you lost Auxilus key and apt could then no longer if packages were trustworthy. Real solution would havr been to reimport the public key with apt-key.. From where did you install xidel?\n. You said that your phone is 64bit but also that you have openssl 1.0.2n arm installed. Do you mean arm64/aarch64 or have you manually installed openssl for another architecture?. Right, your phone is arm 32bit then.\nI'm guessing that the xidel binary you are trying to run was built against another version of openssl. Try compiling xidel from source instead of running the downloaded binary.. Alright, my mistake. . libtermux-exec.so is 64bit, it is loaded through LD_PRELOAD. \nUnset LD_PRELOAD before running your binary and it will succeed. . Let's track this in the other issue.. Hi,\nI'm not really an android app programmer but I'm not quite sure how communication similar to termux-api would work together with app data that is inaccessible from termux. Having it as a totally separate app would make the data inaccessible but communication between the apps would have to go through the android api. \nOr are you suggesting that the obfuscated password is readable only by root?\nSounds like an interesting idea, \nJust for completeness:\nThere was some discussion back in the day here which resulted in the tsu-script and termux-sudo. . @Auxilus I know too little about android to know if it would work or not.\nThis termux:sudo idea is very interesting nevertheless!. \u02cb/sdcard/Python/The Project/nest-simulator-2.14.0/...\u02cb\nMove the code to your home directory and try again. . > (i'm thinking of buying a small Linux server...losing hope in termux.no.......)\nYou have a bit too much faith in termux perhaps, it's a terminal emulator running on android, not a gnu/linux system. Many software requires some patching to work and that seems to be the case in this case.\nDid you download the sources from http://www.nest-simulator.org/download/? \nI can have a quick look.. @richard20020815 It compiles without errors for me after I've installed dependencies, both on aarch64 and arm. Maybe you're missing some dependency, hard to tell without a full log.. Please run cmake . &> cmake.log and post that log. \nI installed the dependencies that the cmake configuration said were necessary.\nPython related packages, like cython, can be installed through pip: pip install cython. . That looks alright. \nDon't know why you get errors when making then. \nWhich device is this on?\nWhat's the output of uname -a?. Clearly you're trying to install something from a repo that is down. You can't install anything from that repo.. Undo the things you did when you tried to install xmrig I guess.\nRemove the repo that gives the warning from $PREFIX/etc/apt/sources.list or some file in $PREFIX/etc/apt/sources.list.d.. Still a problem? I'm unable to reproduce.. One pretty interesting idea is to use the standard cache dir in android. There was a pull request from @xeffyr here: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/478 to do that.. Have you run termux-setup-storage?. Might be nothing we can do then. Android doesn't allow some files in the shared storage for security reasons.. Have you run termux-setup-storage?. Nothing we can do then, android doesn't allow some file types in the shared storage. See also similar issue in https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/637 (and many other).. So what's the problem? You couldn't update but found a work-around?. You can't install packages that aren't compiled for termux. You could try it in termux-chroot but it probably won't work anyways. See https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Differences_from_Linux.. @sdrausty Doesn't look like it to me. . What is pm2?\nedit: right, something installed from npm I guess.\n\"some code in main.py\" doesn't really help if something needs debugging, what does the full script look like?\nYou haven't even said which error you run into.. Don't open duplicate issues.. See for example https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux-unix.. Closing, since #788 incorporated these changes. Install libllvm-dev. Termux splits out headers to a -dev package, as many other distros do.. @iamsubhranil Please open a new issue and provide code that reproduces the issue.. It seems that gzip is broken on i686 (but it works on arm and aarch64, haven't tested x86_64). \nThanks for reporting!\nTo work around it, uninstall gzip and use the busybox version instead:\napt remove gzip. You might need to open a new terminal to make perl aware that $PREFIX/bin/gzip doesn't exist anymore.. gzip is still broken though (try running $PREFIX/bin/gzip) so it might be advisable to keep it uninstalled and use the busybox version until it has been fixed. \nAnyways, great that it works!. Let's wait and see what happens. Feels kinda impossible to distribute \u2248900 packages through apk's. \nIn the worst case scenario we still have F-droid.. I would guess that this is similar to what happens on chromebooks so closing in favour of this issue: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/644. You don't have a c-compiler installed as evident by unable to execute 'cc': No such file or directory.\nRun pkg install clang.. Clearly it worked since you get another error now. Header files, like crypt.h, are found in the -dev packages. In this case install libcrypt-dev.. We don't currently have a bluetooth api so this is probably not possible. . You seem to have done the cat'ing as root before and now $PREFIX/bin/sudo is owned by root. Remove it, as root, and try again (i.e. run su -c \"rm $PREFIX/bin/sudo\" try substituting su with tsu if it doesn't work). \nAlso, next time, please supply more information than i also tried it with tsu, but it doesn't work fine for me. as that doesn't give us any information whatsoever.\n. The command sudo chmod +x airgeddon.sh finished without errors, it makes the script airgeddon.sh executable.\nTo actually execute the script you need to run sudo ./airgeddon.sh.. What's the output of termux-info? \nWhy have you downloaded the binary from the site instead of installing termux' nodejs package? . Alright, it's the right architecture at least. \nIt probably won't work though, the precompiled binary is compiled fora normal gnu/linux system and assumes that shared libraries are in /usr/lib and an awful lot of other things, see https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Differences_from_Linux. \nAll packages for termux are ported and compiled specifically for termux/android. Only gnu/linux binaries that are statically linked have a chance to work out of the box. . It's included on my arm device. Make sure all packages are up to date and try reinstalling python. . Do you have clang installed? . See #675.. You can't. There are other terminal emulators available that you can use, for example https://github.com/jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator (which termux' terminal emulator is based on). \nThat other app doesn't have an apt repo and installable packages though.\nPackages compiled for android 5 and newer are in many cases not compatible with android 4 due to differences in the bionic versions.. https://github.com/termux/termux.github.io/issues/37.. Piping termux-clipboard-get to cat seem to work, but not long press pasting, as you said. \nEmacs and vim both handle the clipboard correctly, but not nano.\nThere are no \\r characters in the data I tested with (verified with hexdump), so not sure that's related to the issue.. I don't see why you expect it to work. (Re)placing a libc on a normal linux system surely causes problems as well unless done correctly.\nIf you want to use musl libc for compiling some project then place it in some other folder and change the build environment to make your project aware of it.\nClosing this as it isn't really a bug as @xeffyr put it.\n(Real problem here is perhaps that $PREFIX/lib is writeable for normal user)\n. netstat -h and arp -h aren't valid options so the output is printed to stderr instead of stdout which causes less to not get any input. \nI get the same behaviour on my desktop so I'll close this. . Yeah, you're right, -h and --help should both be acceptable options when I read the help more carefully.\nI don't know enough to tell if it's a bug or a \"feature\" but it clearly causes some annoyance as you've demonstrated. You shouldn't use apt with su/sudo/tsu, there's no need for it and that will cause all sorts of trouble.\nSudo isn't provided by termux so open an issue at the right repo about that if needed.\nUse tsu -a to get rid of the permission denied error, but again: don't run apt as root!. Termux is a prefixed system so all binaries are in /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin, there is no /usr/bin folder. You therefore need to change the shebang in the script.. > could not exec (exit code = 1): [/usr/bin/aapt,\nLooks like you are missing aapt?. I agree that some way to freeze the terminal would be useful (like ctrl + s on normal gnu/linux systems). \nA workaround is to use tmux, that gives you the possibility to freeze the terminal and scroll around.. Are you sure that you don't get a file named \"Download\" in ~ which is in fact your .jpg? Run file ~/Download and see if it says something like \"JPEG image data\".. It's likely a setting in your phone, can't remember the name of this feature though.. Sounds like \"predictive text\", see this issue https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/126. \nI would probably turn it off in android's settings. . You need to reimport Xeffyr's key:\nwget https://xeffyr.github.io/termux-x-repository/pubkey.gpg\napt-key add pubkey.gpg. You can't add debian repos out of the box since termux isn't a full gnu/linux system so this isn't really a valid issue.\nYou can install debian in a proot env. following this guide: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Debian.. Can you give the command you used when you got this error?. This upstream bug report seem to report this: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/6780, it was solved last year. I'll see if updating to the latest ffmpeg version solves it.. Ffmpeg 40 seem to work, could you try this deb: https://grimler.se/dists/testing/misc/binary-aarch64/ffmpeg_4.0_aarch64.deb and confirm? I have only built it for aarch64 so far, and need to bump all packages who depend on ffmpeg before I can open a PR.. @denialplando how did you solve the problem?. Why sudo tsu? \nThat's like running sudo su, it makes no sense.\nDo you get the same error with only tsu? Try tsu -a in that case.. Same problem when you run what exactly? . ...\nClosing due to lack of information.. On my device the documentation is correct, Volume Up+P \u2192 Page Up and Volume Up+N \u2192 Page Down. \nWhat device do you have?. Do you have a libmp3lame.so in /system/lib?. Termux is a prefixed environment so it's impossible that you have /usr and /home. \nUnless you are running the commands in a chroot environment or something like that, though /system should still be accessible then (I think).. Alright, that explains the issue then, mpv picks up /system/lib(64)/libmp3lame.so instead of /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/libmp3lame.so.\nAn ugly work around until we can fix it properly would probably be to run mpv as \nLD_PRELOAD=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/libmp3lame.so mpv some_mp3.mp3\nYour particular android variant apparently ships a libmp3lame.so which conflicts with termux' libmp3lame.so.. Maybe you need to change LD_LIBRARY_PATH as well.\nThe tsu error is probably not related. To not get that error, run tsu -a instead of just tsu.. I don't know, have to research it. There are a couple of packages who deals with similar issues, for example gst-plugins-base.. Which error do yuo get with play-audio? \nI use cmus.. @Substancia ah, actually, try editing $PREFIX/bin/mpv and add /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/libmp3lame.so to the LD_PRELOAD line there, that probably solves this.. It's not possible in shared storage due to Android's security features. See for example https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2459, https://github.com/termux/termux.github.io/issues/35, https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2076 for more information.. Sure, mv them to /sdcard and edit them all you want. You just can't keep executable files or make symlinks in /sdcard.\nYou can probably access the files without moving them if you are rooted and have the right apps installed.\nEdit: making a good text editor (that's better than emacs or vim) sounds like a huge project, contributions are welcome of course.. I suggest that you open a new issue and provide the commands you ran as well as the error you get.. My crystal ball is foggy today so what did you run and which error are you getting?. @AJ-Creations set the home path in your ftp client to the path to your TestLab folder. Worked for me when I tested with some android ftp app.. You shouldn't use apt as root. That will break your termux environment.\nThat being said, you need to preserve some environmental variables to be able to use termux' binaries as root. Run tsu -a instead of tsu to do this.. I would guess that you start it by running codiad.. The keys were added yesterday in https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/605. Update your app to get them. \nYou can long press, press more and then kill process to kill a terminal if ctrl + c/ctrl + d/ctrl + z; kill .. doesn't work.\nThe font colour request probably belongs at github.com/termux/termux-styling.. @jisan0010 Check out one of the numerous guides online, for example https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2462426. Note that I haven't tried it.\nIt might be possible to restore some of the data. Don't use your phone before you try restoring it as new files will overwrite the deleted data.. Duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2580. Should be fixed now, update all your packages.. Use tsu -a instead of just tsu.. Please provide more information, otherwise we can't help you.\nWhat did you run? \nWhat permissions does the folder have? (run ls -l $PREFIX/tmp)\nWhat device are you using? Which android version?\nAre you rooted?. See the wiki: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Debian.. Please open an issue in the ubuntu repo from where you installed ubuntu (and provide more information, we can't know what error you are talking about if you don't provide any information).. Closing as off-topic (and lack of information). Feodora or wine isn't termux packages.\nWine has been discussed before, I think the problem was either missing kernel features or lack of support for arm, which might explain your issues. Search for the relevant issues in the termux repos.. Duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2603.. Are you trying to install termux on the external sdcard or something like that?. Yeah, what it does during that pop-up is to download a bootstrap zip from https://termux.net/bootstrap/ and then extract it. Your android logs might show more information about what goes wrong.\nWhich android version and which device are you using?. @Bholuvilla So it works now? How did you fix it?. I think you should open an issue in the repo you linked instead.. You can keep the in a git project. After installing termux you can then do git clone smth and run a script/make/w/e to cp or ln them to HOME.\nJust be sure to not put sensitive information in them (if you use github or other public git site).\nThere's also the vcsh package (available in termux) which aims at simplifying/improving this further. I haven't tested it though.. Whatever floats your boat!\nJust note that you won't be syncing your home directory, the .git resides elsewhere and you can easily choose to only sync some dotfiles to termux, not all that you have on your desktop.. We don't keep older versions so it's not possible. You will need to build it yourself if you want this particular version.. Have you tried /system/bin/reboot or /system/bin/sh /system/bin/reboot?. reboot probably isn't a shell script so /system/bin/sh /system/bin/reboot was a bad suggestion..\nIt works without root on my particular rom, android 8.0. I'm surprised it does though, feels kinda bad that apps can reboot the device at will. . The mentioned log in the error message sould be useful to see what's going on.. Probably means that you aren't in home and should go there with cd. nethunter isn't a termux package though so this issue is off-topic here.. Fixes #749.. > Giving good input or good specs and let experts implement the feature. \nI'm definitely no java expert though, but hey, thanks.\nSo about the termux.properties file. As you've already said it's just a normal utf-8 file, which is parsed by java.util.Properties into a properties object. The extrakeys entry is read into a string which is later parsed by the JSONArray library into a json object. So the string must have a syntax that JSONArray can handle.\n' instead of \" works just fine.\nThe reason I mentioned utf-16 is because java seem to use utf16 for strings, so maybe java.util.properties reads the utf-8 file as utf-16 and causes the problems. I don't really know, have to do more testing.\nAnyways, good that the development is on it's way!. > After reading the source code termux.properties is simply a file that must be in $HOME dir. Or in $HOME/.config/termux\nActually $HOME/.termux/or $HOME/.config/termux. I managed to find the wiki entry on it: https://wiki.termux.com/index.php?title=Terminal_Settings. > I might fork the repo and add commits to the pull request, if I find how to do do that, do I have to do another PR? Or can I join in? I know git and branches but pretty new to github.\nSounds great! I probably won't work on this again for another day or two.\nIf you open a PR to my branch (i.e. go to https://github.com/grimler91/termux-app/tree/configurable_keys and press \"New pull request\" there) then your commits are added to this pull request.\n\nIndeed, java does use UTF-16, sizeof(char) is 2 bytes. Butin your screenshot, tou seem to have 3 characters, which is utf-8 for the arrow keys.\n\nYupp, I checked, it's 3 characters. So we need to decode and encode it as utf-16 instead in ExtraKeys.java I guess. I don't see how # coding: utf-8 would help (and I tried adding it to termux.properties, no difference).\nYou have lots of good ideas that could probably be split into several PRs, which this first one aiming at making it possible to configure keys (without breaking termux easily) and then enhance it by increasing user-friendliness and adding more options and possibilities.. I'll test your changes and give you a report :) \nAbout building the app, you can install the sdk (and ndk) by running scripts/setup-android-sdk.sh in termux-packages. You also need to have java installed (obviously). \nAfter that, you can build the app pretty easily from the command line (without the need of installing android-studio). I have cloned all the termux apps to a common folder and from that folder I run this script:\n```bash\n!/bin/sh\npasswords for keystore\nkeystore_pw=$(pass dev/keystore)\nkey_pw=$(pass dev/keystore-termux)\nyour keystore file\nkeystore_file=NAME.keystore\nexport ANDROID_HOME=~/lib/android-sdk\nexport ANDROID_NDK_HOME=~/lib/android-ndk\nif [ -z $1 ]; then\n    apps=\"app api float tasker styling boot\"\nelse\n    apps=\"$1\"\nfi\nmkdir -p apps\nfor app in $apps; do\n    if [ ! -d \"termux-$app\" ]; then\n        git clone git@github.com:termux/termux-$app\n    fi\ncd termux-$app\n### Name the apk after the branch\nbranch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)\n\n./gradlew clean\n### Build with gradle:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n./gradlew assemblerelease\n### Align the app (not strictly necessary)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \nzipalign -v -p 4 app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-{unsigned,aligned}.apk\n### Sign the app:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n# jarsigner -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 \\                                                                                                                          \n#         -keystore ~/.android/${keystore_file} \\                                                                                                                              \n#         -storepass ${keystore_pw} \\                                                                                                               \n#         -keypass ${key_pw} \\                                                                                                                                               \n#         app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-aligned.apk termux_app\n#### Move the finished apk to folder \"apps\"\ncp app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-aligned.apk ../apps/termux-$app-$branch.apk\ncd ..\n\ndone\n```\nIf you want to sign the app as well you need to generate a signing key and then un-comment those things in the script.\nRemember that you can't have several termux apps installed if they are signed with different keys, i.e. you need to uninstall termux-{app,api,...} fully before installing your own version, so remember to backup $HOME if you do this. . @robertvandeneynde I'll continue the discussion here so that it is a bit easier to follow.\n\nHowever, the first version of the implementation should be thought, not just this sounds good to me, here's my PR and fornwall would be like This is great, I'll push it on the store aaand the new user will complain Why do you put two bars and no configurable keys.\n\nYeah, I guess the problem is that not too many people build the apps themselves and test PRs, so feedback is limited before stuff is merged. The higher the quality before the merge the better of course :) \n\nWith the current code, it does happen, the String[][] buttons is a array of array of non null Strings, but the subarrays are not all the same size, but a good question would be what happens when the first line has less keys than the second one. To which I alread have a good answer in my previous posts (it should stretch the layout).\nThe old code did final String buttonText = (buttons[row][col] == null ? \" \" : buttons[row][col]); but it's useless because if not all rows have same length, IndexError is thrown.\n\nStretch the layout sounds like the most elegant solution. \nI don't see why an IndexError would happen as long as we iterate over it properly, an array of arrays with different row lengths seem to be allowed in java\n\nSo do I have to create another PR or will you do git merge? :)\nI'm trying to do another PR a but gihub doesn't offer from robertvandeneynde termux-app configurable_keys into Grimler91 termux-app configurable_keys, it only proposes to compare from termux repo , even if I tick compare against fork thinking , I can't remember how I managed to create This PR :D\n\nOpening a new PR is perhaps the easiest because github can handle rebasing if necessary, though in this case I could have easily cherry-picked/merged that single commit. \nI've also noticed that github is a bit stupid when it comes to opening pull requests to a fork (or a fork of a fork of a...), easiest seem to be to go to the repo&branch you want to open against and then press \"new pull request\", or use a link like you did :+1:  \nSo now that you've implemented most special keys as LEFT -> \u2190, TAB -> \u21b9 etc, do you still think it's important to change the props.load() function. No one will (I hope) copy paste unicode characters from the internet into termux.properties but stick to the text definitions, if they are clear and we provide many examples. . > But the code does cols = maximumLength(buttons) and the class ExtraKeysView extends GridLayout, so I don't know if the layout is streched by default\nAh, there it is!\nSo lets do as you suggested:\n```diff\ndiff --git a/app/src/main/java/com/termux/app/ExtraKeysView.java b/app/src/main/java/com/termux/app/ExtraKeysView.java\nindex a4073ae..4e8079e 100644\n--- a/app/src/main/java/com/termux/app/ExtraKeysView.java\n+++ b/app/src/main/java/com/termux/app/ExtraKeysView.java\n@@ -326,7 +326,7 @@ public final class ExtraKeysView extends GridLayout {\n         setColumnCount(cols);\n     for (int row = 0; row < rows; row++) {\n\n\nfor (int col = 0; col < cols; col++) {\nfor (int col = 0; col < buttons[row].length; col++) {\n                 final String buttonText = buttons[row][col];         Button button;\n\n```\nWe then get deadspace (unclickable) instead, which is at least better than an app crash but not as good as stretched keys.\n\n. I've invited you to collaborate (you should have an email from github) to my grimler91/termux-app fork.\n\n\nI merged in changes from master and then cherry-picked your commit. With cherry-pick I mean git fetch robert configurable_keys; git cherry-pick {commit-hash}. It gives a bit cleaner history if the branch histories aeen't identical (no merge needed). \n\nSo the default can be written:\nextra-keys = [[ESC, CTRL, ALT, TAB, \"-\", \"/\", \"|\"]]\n\nI think that look more confusing, better to quote all strings then, even if it isn't strictly needed.\nWait, \"\\\\\" is for one backslash? Wow... An alias would indeed be nice then!. @tomty89 what's the benefit of that? Feels like it would make the file much harder to find.. Can't have executable stuff in shared storage, move it to home instead.. Header files are in the -dev packages so install, for example, python-dev and try again. . We have no idea what's wrong on your system since you haven't even shared the error message. Closing since we don't have enough information.. See if tsu works, just tsu or tsu -a.. Closing since the issue doesn't seem to be termux-specific. \nLooks like you need(ed) to install nokogiri through gem.. You can do it if you are rooted. Doing it without root would require going through androids API, by extending termux-api. It isn't as simple as just adding a line to the manifest unfortunately.\nFeel free to open a feature request at https://github.com/termux/termux-api. @ttrash termux provides busybox, you don't need to get another app from play store.\nbash\n$ which busybox\n/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/busybox. Such a feature would probably go into termux-api, might be more appropriate to open the feature request there. Looking at the termbot sources seems like a good start for an implementation. See https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/324.. You ned to root your phone.\nCheck for a guide on xda. Looks like you don't have python2 installed. Rum pkg install python2.. To get back to home just write \"cd\" in your terminal. We don't have a short key for it. . @ttrash w was removed two weeks ago, see https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/commit/d3b91dd27feacce39fb594286be054952dc019fe \nThe command-not-found isn't updated very regularly though so the program is still listed there. After your issue here @xeffyr opened https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/pull/2824 to remove it from the list.\nSo thanks for pointing out that it is erroneously listed in command-not-found.. Closing in favour of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2845. See https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2846 and https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2845. I think we've seen this problem before, and that the reporter solved it by re-rooting/rooting with another su variant. \nThat doesn't explain why it happens though. Run termux-elf-cleaner on the library that gives the warning, i.e. in your case termux-elf-cleaner $PREFIX/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/gems/pg-0.20.0/lib/pg_ext.so.\nSee also https://github.com/termux/termux-packages#android-dynamic-linker and https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2846.. Metasploit isn't a package from termux-packages so report it to the person you got the script from. The warning says that line 2 and 5 in sources.list are duplicates. \nWhat's the content of sources.list?. Hi, there's a couple of open feature requests regarding Bluetooth, see for example #235 and https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/88.\nRegarding blueborne see https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2081. Hi, see https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/57328/should-the-sdcard-support-case-sensitive-files.\nThis is due to how android works, nothing we can do about it. You could just cp -r node_project_folder /sdcard/, do the editting and then copy it back when you want to test it . What are you running to get this error? I guess it's related to R from its-pointless repo so you should probably open an issue there instead. Ah, right, thanks. You have to restorecon it in a none-interactive shell I believe, otherwise the permissions are changed again when you exit tsu (when it prints your history to the file). \nMoving the file to /sdcard should also work, so you can move it there as root and then move it back as the normal user. \nI would say that this is something that should be fixed in the tsu repo rather than termux-app. See https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2822. You can use tmux as a workaround, you can then use ctrl + b followed by pgup or pgdn to scroll. See also https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/211.. Speech dispatcher looks interesting. Should be possible to port it to termux and use it with espeak and pulseaudio. I can have a look at it when I have some free time. @JanuszChmiel could the speech interruption error be related to this issue: https://github.com/brailcom/speechd/issues/45 in the speechd repo?. I've uploaded speechd (and dependency dotconf) here: http://grimler.se/dists/testing/misc/binary-aarch64/speechd_0.8.8_aarch64.deb, http://grimler.se/dists/testing/misc/binary-aarch64/dotconf_1.3_aarch64.deb.\nReplace aarch64 with another arch if you're using another one.\nBuild.sh is here: https://github.com/Grimler91/termux-packages/tree/speechd/packages/speechd\nI'll see if I can test it somehow and then open a PR to the main repo.. Can't be done.. Well it is possible to connect from putty, you just need to fix whatever error you're getting. \nYou can generate a ssh key-pair in putty with ssh-keygen and then you need to put the generated public key in \u02dc/.ssh/authorized_keys in termux, that's really all there is to it. Closing this then since connecting from putty works, no new package needed. It's only possible (on newer android versions) to access the usb otg using androids API, and no one has done the programming needed for that yet. See https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/71 for an older discussion/feature request. Yes, you can't change permissions in the shared storage. It doesn't affect anything, it's a warning and not an error.\nSee https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2846 for more information. Great, we most certainly need more verification :)\nI also see that you've added an alternative config path (just mentioning it since it's worth mentioning). > Nope, that wasn't me, this is already in master.\nAh sorry, I blame my small phone screen. \nAnyways, great!. \u02cbrm -rf $PREFIX\u02cb and restarting termux seems like the easiest way to fix this... We have libssl version 1.1, not 1.0.0. Try updating your python packages through pip so that they hopefully work with the newer version. Yeah, this is outside of termux control. Open a feature request at a keyboard app instead. What are you actually asking here? \nThe linux distribution folder you're login into with proot is accessible from termux and all termux folders you've binded when starting proot are accessible to proot. And don't spam the repo with duplicate issues... Requires qt? In that case this PR should be at https://github.com/termux/x11-packages. Closing in favor of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/3183. Short answer: no\nLong answer: it depends what you mean by \"apps\". Can work in a proot environment if the architecture the \"app\" was compiled for is compatible with your device.\nThere are maaaany issues about these kind of things already, search the repo, and see the wiki https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Differences_from_Linux. Yeah, sounds like what we already have. See https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Touch_Keyboard. Install the HTTP::Request module through cpan(m). See for example https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65865/whats-the-easiest-way-to-install-a-missing-perl-module.. We can't help you without seeing the actual error message, which is probably in the mkmf.log or gem_make.out mentioned above. . Looks like it can't find the glob function, so you could try installing libandroid-glob and then run LDFLAGS=\" -lglob\" gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries.\nAlso make sure you have libxml2, libxml2-dev, libxslt, libxslt-dev installed.. > But the result said i installed nokogiri 1.8.5 not 1.8.0 versions,my metasploit needs nokogiri 1.8.0 not 1.8.5\nI'm not a ruby/gem expert, but that sounds like something your favorite search engine can help you with, for example:\nhttp://lmgtfy.com/?q=install+specific+version+of+gem. > RuntimeError: The 'apxs' command appears not to be installed or is not executable.\nYou don't have apxs, typing \"apxs\" in the terminal gives \nThe program 'apxs' is not installed. Install it by executing:\n pkg install apache2\nSo you haven't installed apache2.. I can't see an issue here. If you are rooted and the editor app supports \"root mode\" then editing files in /data/data/com.termux/files are no problem.\nMaking everything in /data/data/com.termux editable to (all) external apps sounds like a very bad thing from a security perspective (and I'm not even sure it's possible in android). Does it look the same if you connect the pi with HDMI to a screen, or if you ssh into termux?. Thanks for checking. \nDoes the the android logs mention any errors?\nI'll see if I can reproduce it on my own pi. @brubakerjeff nothing in the log seem to be termux related AFAIK.\nI also attempted to reproduce the error but found out that raspberry 3 b+ isn't supported yet ufortunately.\nI might be able to test it on a normal model 3 B during the week.. Seems you have two warnings there. Warnings, not errors, so you don't really have any problems. @mayureshw Are all packages updated?\nWhat's your output of termux-info?. You haven't imported its-pointless key (or overwritten trusted.gpg and thereby removed it). You can re-import it with apt-key adv --recv 906F5AFA9A32C72D, after installing dirmngr. Is this in a fresh install? If not, re-install termux (or open a fail-safe session and see if the problem lies in some config file)\nA logcat might tell us more about the issue (if the problem does not lie in, for example, .bashrc). This has been asked a couple of times before in different forms. It isn't possible for various reasons. If you want to use a binary in another app then you need to recompile it and statically link it aginst dependencies and move it to the other app's directory.. @hyperpallium You can put it there but not run it, android doesn't allow it. Again, it has been asked before so I encourage you to search for older issues. See for example https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/616, https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/440 and more.\nIt would be a severe security issue if different apps could access each others data so android doesn't allow it. Chmodding won't help. And for future reference: this fixes https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/912. Pleae edit in some information. We can't read your mind. @xeffyr I was planning on waiting a few days, but I guess it won't help (we really ought to fix a issue template for the main repo, like you have over at x11-packages). There is a partial workaround that doesn't fix the problem entirely (a failsafe session can't be accessed). You should be able to open a new terminal and switch between them using key combinations: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Hardware_Keyboard. Don't open duplicate issues: https://github.com/termux/termux-boot/issues/24. See https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Recover_a_broken_environment on how to open a failsafe session. \nNot sure if you can run chsh from the failsafe session though or if you need to fix it in some other way. You can use the package daemonize, or just start the program and fork it into the background. \nIf you want to \"enable\" a service then you need to put the startup command in ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc or some other suitable file for your needs, termux-boot is useful for starting services when device (re)starts. And are you using xargs from the package findutils or from busybox?. Swipe up from \"-\" to get it. \n\n. @c-e-p-x-u-o it will also be possible to configure the extra keys on the next release, see https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/788. Check the xda forums for your phone model. Termux can't root your phone/unlock your bootloader so this is off topic here. Hi, what would you like to change by changing to something else than debian-ish? \nPython (for example) from our debian-ish OS will be the same as python from a \"insert-os-here\"-ish os. If you want to use for example pacman instead of apt then sure it is possible but you need to create build scripts, recompile all packages and setup a pacman repo for them.\nIn general running a different OS will mean a lot of work, running packages from normal linux distros simply doesn't work since android isn't linux and hence proot is needed to make it work.\nWas this sort of what you were asking?. Probably means that clang isn't installed, or something else. Impossible to tell without the full error message.\nNot that termux doesn't have a gui so you can't use gui stuff. (Might be possible with termux/x11-packages). Still isn't the full error message. That's a warning, not an error (warning: unused function). It means that you need to give it the build type, with --build=. Read the ./configure --help or search the worldwideweb for more information.. @JeffVandrewJr what's your output of termux-info?. @xeffyr yeah, I got the same. Removing the fortify flag in termux_step_pre_configure (as we do for, for example, nano) makes it build. I've uploaded a build for arm here: wget https://grimler.se/dists/testing/debug/binary-arm/wget-dbg_1.20_arm.deb.\nA gdb backtrace isn't very exciting though, we might need to build debug variant of openssl as well:\n```\n(gdb) run\nStarting program: /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdrausty/TermuxArch/master/setupTermuxArch.sh\nProgram received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.\n0xb6dcd406 in ??

See https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/20. Termux can't write to the external sdcard, except for the folder /storage/750C-3810/Android/data/com.termux/files/.. What's the content of the script? \nMost common error is that the shebang of the script isn't valid, I.e. that the script starts with #!/bin/sh instead of #!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/sh or similar.. Closing since duplicate issue https://github.com/termux/termux-boot/issues/28 is solved. You need to re-download the key it seems, maybe because trusted.gpg was overwritten in an update. You can re-download the key with \napt-key adv --recv 5AAAC9E0A46BE53C \n. @MrNobodyTharusha run rm -rf $PREFIX and restart the app. That will remove all installed packages and give you a fresh install (but keep $HOME intact).. Well you can add emacs or  emacs & to your .bashrc.\nYou could also put something like emacs --bg-daemon in your .profile. This starts a daemon that you can later connect to with emacsclient, with no startup time whatsoever.\nThe proper answer depends on what you actually want to achieve. Nice! \nI remember assisting someone on gitter with this issue. I don't remember an issue on github.. Don't know what you did to cause this. \nYou can run rm -rf $PREFIX and restart termux to remove all installed packages and get a fresh installation.. Your files in $HOME will be left alone.\nYou can open a failsafe session as described here: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Recover_a_broken_environment#Launching_a_Failsafe_Session. I'm not familiar with NaSSH (and I don't own a chromebook) so I can only give generic tips:\n\namended the authorized_keys file\n\nJust to be sure, you amended to termux's authorized_keys, right?\n\nI followed the termux-chroot and SSHD commands\n\nI have no idea why that blog tells you to use termux-chroot. It should be possible to run sshd without termux-chroot (so please ignore that part of the instructions).\n\nI have determined what my username is (using whoami), IP address and port number\n\nThere's no need to specify username, it is ignored since termux is a single user environment, also the port is 8022 unless you've made changes to the default config files. Also how did you determine the ip? The failing password prompt sort of sounds like you are trying to ssh from the chromebook to the chromebook (with the termux user/pw).\n\nWhen I enter these into NaSSH and use the id_rsa.pub key\n\nThat seems weird, you should probably specify the id_rsa file. The id_rsa.pub file is the one you need to append to termux's authorized_hosts.\nNext step for understanding the problem should be to look at the logs from sshd and ssh.\nYou can run sshd -E ~/sshd.log to get a logfile (be sure to kill the old sshd daemon before starting the new one). Maybe NaSSH has some way to view the logs for as well?. Bind to port on 8022 on :: failed Address already in use\nBind to port on 8022 failed. Address already in use\nCannot bind any address\nMeans that you didn't kill the old daemon before starting the logging one. Run ps and kill <PID> where  is the PID of sshd as outputed from ps. You can then run sshd -E ~/sshd.log.\n\nI had to use chroot to create the symlinks and write the keys to the local storage on the Chromebook but did not need it to start sshd.\n\nchroot doesn't grant you access to anything, it just replaces /data/data/com.termux/files/home /home (and similar) in your commands. \nYour command ln -s /storage/emulated/0/Download/devbox /home/devbox in chroot is the same as running ln -s /storage/emulated/0/Download/devbox /data/data/com.termux/files/home/devbox outside of chroot.\n. @Amarjit3 Sooo the issue is solved?. Hi, \nWell you can access the same tools by typing their full path: /system/xbin/{TOOL} so it is very possible to use the magisk tools, no need to set the path except for convenience. \n\nI suggest to have this set as default \n\nNot everyone uses magisk so we are unlikely to make this change. Great that you reported is so that other users can benefit from the PATH trick though! \nNote that it is better to put your bashrc customization in ~/.bashrc instead of $PREFIX/etc/bash.bashrc, bash.bashrc is overwritten when bash is updated while ~/.bashrc is left alone.\nAnd finally also note that putting /system/bin and /system/xbin before /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin in $PATH will most likely break some termux scripts/programs as they pick up other versions than they expect. You could also check if the directory /data/data/com.termux/files/ exists (and is readable). The PREFIX env var might be unset but the folder should be there.\nThe PREFIX won't be changed. It would only be changed if the project is forked. . No, this is currently not possible. \nYou can define a combination of keys to open the name-prompt but you can't set it from CLI.. @ralfwerner and also, you have spelled control \"crtl\" instead of \"ctrl\". Well what modifications did you do to the bashrc?\nThis blog explains it quite nicely: https://coderwall.com/p/fasnya/add-git-branch-name-to-bash-prompt\nAlso it would be wiser to put such modifications into ~/.bashrc. You could try clearing the cache as suggested for example here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36372370/unfortunately-launcher3-has-stopped-working-error-in-android-studio\nNote that this seems to happen with other apps as well: https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Android-Yoga-Series-Tablets/Unfortunately-Launcher3-has-stopped-on-Lenovo-Yoga-Tab-3-Pro/td-p/3962333 so might not be termux related\nA logcat might tell us more about the problem.. If you have twrp installed then you could try wiping cache from there as well.\nWe can't do anything about this. A logcat would tell us what the problem is, but it's probably not caused by termux-app 0.66 . @vpelletier There also seem to be a fair amount of android applications that do trigger this bug, not only termux (see my previous comment). \nFeel free to investigate and propose a pull request. Since none of the core developers seem to experience the issue I think it is unlikely that anyone of us will spend time looking for a workaround. Hi, thanks for reporting. This is unfortunately an issue after the latest libandroid-support update. We have some instructions in https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/3283 with a temporary fix from a fail-safe session. @auxilus could you post a screenshot after restarting for comparison?. You can already have different \"tabs\" by opening several sessions in the left drawer. You can then switch between them with ctrl + alt + # if you have a hardware keyboard. It is also possible run several shells side-by-side with tmux. \nIs that sort of what you are after?. I can't reproduce this on aarch64 android 8.1. \nWhat do you have in your ~/.bashrc? In particular, what is your PS1 set to?. A broken libandroid-package was unfortunately pushed to the repo a week ago or so, and everyone who did an pkg upgrade on android < 8 devices during a timespan of a couple of hours experienced this. To fix this you have to run some commands from a fail-safe shell. The steps are described in this comment: https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/3283#issuecomment-457910719. It isn't on the repo. It's also possible to trigger the issue by doing a partial upgrade, i.e. only updating some packages, maybe that is what happened here. You can put the commands in ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile, as in a normal linux distribution. Termux unfortunately won't work with another path without recompiling everything. \nThe app uses /data/data/com.termux/files, as you pointed out, and all the packages are using /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/[...] as path to dependencies, conf files and others. \nIf you want to use another PREFIX, then the apps and all packages need to be recompiled pointing to the new PREFIX unfortunately.\nThere was some experimenting done with a dynamic PREFIX but patching all packages to use this is a lot of work and probably won't happen.. I think you are talking about the extra-keys row.\nYou can specify which keys you want to have by putting it in ~/.termux/termux.properties. See https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Touch_Keyboard#Extra_Keys_Row for an example and some more information.. Hi @SBanya, nice to hear that you want to contribute! Please join the gitter channels (or mirrored IRC channels): https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Community. We also have a termux/termux-dev gitter room dedicated to development related discussions, where we also have weekly scheduled discussions: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Dev:Development_Sessions. \nWe can probably come up with some good suggestions for a first project if you drop by the termux-dev channel!. $ mysql_config\nThe program 'mysql_config' is not installed. Install it by executing:\n pkg install mariadb\nSo install mariadb.. try mkdir $PREFIX/etc/my.cnf.d and then run\nmysql_install_db --user=$(whoami) --datadir=$PREFIX/var/lib/mysql --basedir=$PREFIX\nThis seems to be a bug that should be fixed.. ? You haven't installed it AFAIK since it failed with an error so I suppose you want to install it. Header files are found in the -dev packages so you want to install mariadb-dev. @AadiRajUthup As xeffyr said, you also need to reinstall/recompile all gems that metasploit depend on. What device is this? Which architecture? Why are you installing an older version of termux? \nAre you trying to install termux into the external sdcard? \nDo you have network problems? Can you access termux.net in your browser?. Looks like you have run apt as root. You should not do that. \nRun rm -rf $PREFIX and restart termux to remove all installed packages (but leave $HOME intact), and then avoid using apt as root.. run rm -rf $PREFIX as root if you need to.\nEasiest solution at this point might be to uninstall the entire app and then install it again. \nYou can also run su; rm -rf $PREFIX from a fail-safe session: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Recover_a_broken_environment. > And yes, I rooted my phone. So now can't I use\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade commands..?\n\nYou should never, ever, run apt as root in termux. There's no need for it and it will break stuff as you've learnt.\nYou should also use pkg instead of apt. It's a wrapper that does apt update automatically and prevents you from running apt as root by mistake. @MrNobodyTharusha uninstall termux and install it again . You need to recompile some packages and change $TERMUX_PREFIX (and perhaps $TERMUX_ANDROID_HOME) to match your new path. The packages marked as essential would be a good start. \nOnce you have those packages you need to create a bootstrap.zip similar to the official ones and upload it somewhere, and then change the bootstrap url found in termux-app to download it from there.. I have no idea what you are doing, you need to provide more information if you want help. Sounds like you are trying to clone a none-existing repo or cloning over ssh even though you haven't put your pub key in your settings on github.. > src/_fastmath.c:36:11: fatal error: 'gmp.h' file not found\nSo you need to install the header files for gmp. Header files in termux (and some other distros) are found in the -dev packages, so in your case you need to install libgmp-dev.. You can't use the ubuntu repos. Termux/Android isn't linux and the two aren't compatible. \nIf you want to use ubuntu then you have to do that in a proot env, see https://github.com/Neo-Oli/termux-ubuntu.\nYou can run rm -rf $PREFIX and restart termux to restore to the bootstrap installation. This will keep $HOME instact.. @ulist Open an issue in the ubuntu repo then, I can't see anything in your error message that indicate that there is a problem with termux. @thestinger \n\nSomeone there accused me of concern trolling\n\nI apologize for how issue https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/655 was received, I guess people freaked out and decided to shoot the messenger. We should have moderated it better.\n\nIt's currently 17 in Android P and is being increased to 23 in Android Q\n\nI guess we have a year or two (at least) to figure out how to deal with this then. I'm guessing this shouldn't be here twice?. ",

As I'm sure many who have complained about this would.\nI feel responsibility should be placed on the user to manage their environment properly. If they lock themselves out, and are unrooted.\nSo perhaps if a proper safe method is too much work, we could have a quick and dirty option to opt in to the unsafe close with a stern disclaimer? Please? =D\n\n- I'm against completely disabling 'Failsafe shell' since there always should be way to access environment in case of script or binary failure. Termux is just like a PC in that case: if OS failed to boot, user can always perform recovery, access his data via live CD or just plugging hdd to something else...\nIf someone don't agree with that - feel free to fork Termux and introduce your changes, but only in fork =)\nSo current solution is only https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/793.

For those who seeking for implementation, it is in https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/517.. > but could termux get real user name from android and map u0_a78 to it\nYes, it could (if you mean obtain user name and not id).

Issue solvable either via setenforce 0 or running program under \"tsu\". Both variants require device to be rooted, of course.\nVariants like \"faked\" /proc are wontfix. Though, it is doable by supplying fake \"/proc/stat\" file via proot, but this will make top/htop produce fake output.. Seems related to https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/804, so closing to prevent duplicate (or similar) issues.. @luntik2012 If you mean 'packages' mentioned in https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/314#issuecomment-300595687, then it is a wrapper for 'apt' package manager. It was renamed to 'pkg' in https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/commit/fc0718410cb9e63ddeba8de3fcd9e6531630c7fa.\n\nPS. I suggest you to read comments carefully.. /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/am no longer use /system/bin/am so issue is outdated.. >  I see there's an autodetect function\nTermux uses core libs from Android and we need to prevent architecture mismatching. That's why autodetect is required.\nAnother thing we do not support multiarch (multilib) installation.

It just restores normal SELinux labels for files at this path.. > I can not run reboot command in termux with command not found prompt, as I remember, it can be run as non-root before.\nYou can run a reboot in non-root mode only with adb. Normal Android OS shouldn't permit using such commands by regular apps such as Termux.. > It seem its common problem.\nIt becomes a common problem when:\n\nYou have GPS location disabled but trying to use it anyway through API.\nYou are trying to acquire GPS location in home.\nYou have NET location disabled but trying to use it anyway through API.\nYou are using a custom rom (like LineageOS) without google apps.\nYour rom has a broken implementation of net location provider.\nYou can't use network location because google services are blocked in your country. - in this case use GPS-only.\n\n- now I hope you may know why it may not working.. > GPS location in home or a building?\nGPS requires a signal from satellites. This signal is usually low, but some devices able to catch it near window.\nTime autosync is also required for GPS working - GPS requires correct time set on device.. > They copy fine using root browser, the user in Termux, and with su in Termux - however, once moved the copied files can't be opened. \nOn Android, don't forget about SELinux. There 2 solutions:\n\n~~See comment by @isrgish~~ Link can't be opened, so I'm copying it's content here:\n\n\nThe core issue is trying to manipulate files that were modified as a superuser. This is likely an SELinux context issue, which can be confirmed by checking that the output of /system/bin/getenforce is 'Enforcing'.\nFor individual files, we can fix the file context in root (restorecon ) and revert ownership of the affected file (chown : ). Note that  and  are found by running id as a non-root user. In case many files are affected (e.g. due to updating packages), change directory to /data/data/com.termux/ and run restorecon -R . and chown -R : . to recursively apply the changes. \n\n\nSet SELinux to permissive mode (setenforce 0).. Closing as this is a common issue when using root on recent Android versions. Happens not only in Termux.\n\nSolution is either to disable SELinux (some ROMs have it disabled by default) or manually restore SELinux labels by using /system/bin/restorecon.. > native video support for Termux?\nSince Termux is a terminal, it is not possible to perform output video on it. There is https://github.com/termux/x11-packages repository - brings some X11/windows support for Termux, but you will have to install either VNC viewer or Xorg XSDL. Maybe, in future Termux will have own addon to perform video output, but for now it is kind of \"wontfix\".. Closing in favor of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/804.. @gordol To mount loopback device you need a root.\nWith having root permissions, the mounting of loop device is easy:\ntsu\nmount -o loop /dev/block/loop0 /mnt/mydir. I have solved the problem with SSH by enabling termux-wake-lock and creating a separate session which is running this command:\nping -i 0.3 -s 0 192.168.1.1\nOf course, you may need to replace '192.168.1.1' to different IP.. @sumit-prgmr Haven't tried pkg install proot ? It tolds you that proot is not installed.\n\nWhy nobody reads instructions ?\nhttps://github.com/Neo-Oli/termux-ubuntu#termux-ubuntu. @IvnJzn maybe execute termux-setup-storage ?. Closing as not related to termux-app.. Closing in favor of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/804.. 1. Get user id of Termux app:\nid -u\n2. Change owner of file (replace {id} with id got in previous step):\nchown {id}:{id} filename\n3. Set permissions (i guess that this may be not necessary):\nchmod 600 filename\n\nAfter this your file should be accessible from termux without root, if not, you can try restorecon.. Device is rooted ?. 1. Why shebang is on line 16 ? https://github.com/tukusejssirs/lnx_scripts/blob/master/bash_functions/termux/ogus.sh#L16\n\nError happens only when script is executed with \"dash\" (sh). It is executed with dash because of (1). Shebang should be only on first line and not somewhere in the middle of file. Just assume that shebang is a file type signature.\n\nInfo, how Termux distinguish binaries and scripts: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/termux/app/BackgroundJob.java#L138-L183 - as in (2), shebang is read at the first line.. > I presumed the same behaviour on Termux, too. I see I was wrong.\nWhen you use shell (like bash) in interactive mode, you can omit shebangs at all. In this case scripts will be executed with your current shell. (in that case you are not wrong)\nPlugins like Termux:Tasker ask Termux to execute file manually. To support many script types, Termux read the first line of file and determines the right interpreter to execute it. So here shebangs should always exist on the first line of scripts..

Dalvikvm script in $PREFIX/bin/dalvikvm disabled LD_LIBRARY_PATH by doing unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH. After that linker will use hardcoded path to /system/lib.. @rigortek Command adb root can be used only on debug builds of Android. Specifically, on device should be set the following properties:\nro.secure=0\nro.adb.secure=0\nro.debuggable=1. > it could pose a threat to the user if the sshd server is always running.\nTermux's SSH uses key-based authentication, so there no passwords. Is someone can brute force RSA or ED25519 (or such) keys ? I guess that no.\nBut it should be possible to compile and use tools like fail2ban or sshguard.. Not, we cannot create.\nHow much space you need for Termux ? I guess that typical Termux user use less than 4 GB on internal storage for packages and some data in home directory. For other files it is possible to use external sd card without root.. Why not use an emulator such as QEMU for this. With emulator you can run a desktop OS without root but will be slower. QEMU is already available in https://github.com/xeffyr/termux-x-repository. This is for what emulators is. If you will run entire OS via user application you will can do nearly everything (not sure about this, but ping works without rooted host).\nNo one can/will implement a userspace emulated kernel or mount emulation for ext4fs/fat. No one will create an os emulator specially for Termux. This will be very hard and it isn't worth it. If this feature was important for many people, then it would be done years ago.\nIf your phone has small amount of memory, then buy new =). Or you need a hundreds of GBs in your phone/tablet ?\nOS images don't need to have executable bit set so they can be placed on external storage. And to mount a loop images, you have only two choices: root your device or use an emulator.\nNow about adduser and groups. Android's bionic C library does not support user lists as gnulibc, instead of this it use a hardcoded rules for user/group privilege separation. For more information, you can see file android_filesystem_config.h which is part of Android source code.\nThis file has these lines:\n```\ndefine AID_APP_START 10000 / first app user /\ndefine AID_APP_END 19999   / last app user /\nSo first app user will beu0_a0and last useru0_a9999``, and you can have only ONE user per application but you can switch between them if you have root permission (viasu). **Programs such asadduser` will be useless in Android.**. > Android disallows symlinks in /storage/emulated, but can termux workaround this?\nThere only one workaround - put your files into Termux home ($HOME), this is limitation of Android.. > Maybe can be done with similar termux-setup-storage script method?\nSymlinks are not possible under /storage/emulated/0. It is not possible to use features that is not implemented in FS.\nIf you want symlinks - do this on EXT4 or F2FS file system which is typically /data partition, i.e. $HOME.\ntermux-setup-storage works in $HOME, so symlinks are possible here.\n\nNote: /storage/emulated/0 is still placed on EXT4, but due to FAT32 emulation via sdcardfs or similar forget about using symlinks here. You cannot bypass Android restrictions without root. You cannot use features that not exist or not implemented..

It takes ~2 seconds to start vim on 182x53 and no lags when editing files. Are you installed some plugins ?\nOn Samsung Galaxy S7 it runs very fast without problems.\nI never had lags when using Termux except when I connected over SSH with bad wifi signal.. I guess that this depends on a device. I created a big text file (68322 bytes) and tried to do a benchmark for 'cat' with command time cat textfile.txt. Results:\nNexus7:\nreal    0m1.063s\nuser    0m0.000s\nsys     0m0.000s\nSamsung Galaxy S7:\nreal    0m0.022s\nuser    0m0.010s\nsys     0m0.000s\nAs you can see, even simple 'cat' command have a significant difference (1.063 vs 0.022, in seconds) in performance when executed in Termux terminal.\nI will try to check performance of different Android terminal emulators.. Android Terminal Emulator (jackpal.androidterm) is faster. Results for the same text file are:\nNexus7:\nreal    0m0.181s\nuser    0m0.000s\nsys     0m0.000s\nAnd for Samsung Galaxy S7:\nreal    0m0.003s\nuser    0m0.000s\nsys     0m0.000s\nSo, theoretically it should be possible to improve terminal throughput in Termux.. @MonaLiu421 Remove repository https://Auxilus.github.io - it's broken. And next time - check if repository has a \"README\" file.. > The description in fdroid still says termux uses apt.\nWhat's wrong with this ? Yes, Termux sill uses apt and *.deb package format, script 'pkg' is only a wrapper around apt.. What is a 'python kernel' ? Do you mean a python package ?. Same problem on Samsung Galaxy S7 with Android 8.0. But it doen't happens always and I still able to close session after waiting some time. . @Quasic symlink to cache is should be only temporary solution as this directory can be accidentaly cleaned when using 'cleaner' apps (e.g. my device have such app embedded into rom).

Maybe we should revert this temporarily ?. @rjt-rockx It is probably a bug. Only ~/storage with symlinks should be deleted but not entire /sdcard.. >  to get back some files?\nTo get back some files, make sure that the following conditions are met:\n\nYour phone is rooted.\nYour phone has custom recovery installed, e.g. TWRP.\nData partition encryption is disabled.\nPhone was turned off immediately after files were wiped.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then you can dump data partition somewhere, e.g. external sdcard, and perform recovery on PC (there plenty of free/paid software to do this).\n\ndump data partition:\nCan be done using dd over ADB. Example: adb shell dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0p8 of=/ext_sdcard/mydata.img.\n\nFile recovery from unencrypted partition dump is the only reliable way. For other (easier) ways see https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2462426.\n\nIf you don't have root and data encryption enabled (on Android 6.0+ it enabled by default), you are out of luck, unfortunately. Modern Android devices designed in way that prevents (or makes it very hard) access to data bypassing Android OS.\nAlso, you should know that deleted files continue exist as unallocated space. Shortly: the longer you use your device the less probability of successfull data recovery.\n\nIn addition to everything I wrote above - it is better to ask such questions somewhere on XDA in threads related to your device. Here is a Termux Application issue/bug tracker and not a data recovery center.... It is fixed in official Termux 0.65. Proof:\n\nIf you still want to use old Termux versions - expect to have all bugs that they contain.\n\nIf you managed to place your files to directory ~/storage - then no one will help you. This directory completely managed by Termux, and to prevent file clashes it completely wipes it (note that your sdcard is untouched) - expected behaviour.\nThe purpose of directory ~/storage is to provide a symlinks to shared and external storage, like /mnt directory.\nThe bug was device's internal memory wiped and it was fixed. But wiping of ~/storage is intentional.. It looks like that deleteFolder() follows symlinks..

Post output of uname -m.. @Dj-jom2x You need a QEMU to run x86 programs which is available in my repository currently.\nIf your program is not complex (e.g. statically compiled binary), you can use qemu in user-mode:\n1. qemu-user-i386: https://termux.xeffyr.ml/dists/extra/main/binary-aarch64/qemu-user-i386_2.12.0-2_aarch64.deb\n2. qemu-user-x86_64: https://termux.xeffyr.ml/dists/extra/main/binary-aarch64/qemu-user-x86_64_2.12.0-2_aarch64.deb\nI have used them to make fasm and pandoc available for Termux:\n https://termux.xeffyr.ml/dists/extra/main/binary-all/fasm_1.73.04_all.deb\n https://termux.xeffyr.ml/dists/extra/main/binary-all/pandoc_2.2.1_all.deb\nIf your program is complex - use a qemu-system* packages, Limbo, or you need different device.\nTermux can't execute programs for architectures different from host.. For x86_64: qemu-x86_64 ./path/to/binary\nFor x86 (32bit): qemu-i386 ./path/to/binary\nAs shown, just prefix it with qemu executable.. Closing as implementable on \"user level\" - use either symlinks, backups via git, tar or other solutions.\nImplementing \"backup\" feature in terminal application is overkill - shell provided by Termux gives user enough freedom to do this in preferred way.. The script is located in /sdcard ?. You are using screenfetch ?\nIf so, then:\n1. To get uptime it use /proc/uptime. Access to this file is restricted on Android 8:\n$ cat /proc/uptime\ncat: /proc/uptime: Permission denied\n\nTo get CPU type, it use /proc/cpuinfo which may not provide CPU model name.\nFor example on my device it shows:\n```\nprocessor   : 0\nFeatures    : fp asimd evtstrm aes pmull sha1 sha2 crc32\nCPU implementer : 0x41\nCPU architecture: 8\nCPU variant : 0x0\nCPU part    : 0xd03\nCPU revision    : 4\n\nprocessor   : 1\nFeatures    : fp asimd evtstrm aes pmull sha1 sha2 crc32\nCPU implementer : 0x41\nCPU architecture: 8\nCPU variant : 0x0\nCPU part    : 0xd03\nCPU revision    : 4\nprocessor   : 2\nFeatures    : fp asimd evtstrm aes pmull sha1 sha2 crc32\nCPU implementer : 0x41\nCPU architecture: 8\nCPU variant : 0x0\nCPU part    : 0xd03\nCPU revision    : 4\n...\n```\n\nFor GPU it tries to use tools like nvidia-smi, lspci, glxinfo (they are not available in Termux) and file /proc/fb to which access is restriced too:\n$ cat /proc/fb\ncat: /proc/fb: Permission denied\n\nI guess that it will be possible to fix only displaying of uptime (just use 'uptime' tool instead of /proc/uptime).. @Grimler91 This can be closed.. Try to add necessary commands into ~/.bashrc. @notorand-it Termux doesn't have settings menu. It use a 'Context Menu' instead.\nEven if you tap a such 'menu button', the context menu will be shown anyway because of this (snippet of TermuxActivity.java):\njava\n    /** Hook system menu to show context menu instead. */\n    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {\n        mTerminalView.showContextMenu();\n        return false;\n    }\nTo open a context menu, just do a long tap somewhere on screen and you will see something like this:\n\nIf you tap button 'more...':\n\n. Maybe this is issue of termux-exec. Try to unset LD_PRELOAD and check if you can execute /sbin/su.. >  any progress\nCurrently no, as we need to implement proper permission management so commands may be executed only by programs allowed by user.\nAnother thing that should be implemented is a way to access Termux files by third-party apps, again this will require implementing permissions.. @edaubert Seems okay. Can you open a PR ?. @HarisHashim Note that Termux environment requires specific executable path (/data/data/com.termux/files/usr). This cannot be changed without recompiling packages. Also no one (especially maintainers) want deal with 100500 patches and rewriting them on each package update.. Static libraries are not provided. Even if they will be available, the -static option won't work (at least in your case) since we are relying on C library provided by Android (/system/lib*/libc.so).. > In termux, I prooted\n\nto get by without root\nSo I'm trying to mount the image file using g ext4fuse\n\nProot won't let you to have access to /dev/fuse without REAL root permissions. Just assume that proot is an 'emulator' and everything that it does (root, chroot, mount, etc...) is fake.. > In my search for answers I uninstalled fuse and reinstalled it. Everything completed successfully. How is this possible?\nYou uninstalled & reinstalled package, right ? If so, you just reinstalled fuse userspace tools (like fusermount or library 'libfuse.so'). This doesn't affect /dev/fuse (which is actually provided by kernel).\n\nThe binding to dev is without permission so /dev/fuse was unchanged?\n\nThis is not real binding! Proot just hooked some syscalls and rewrote some data so program thinks that /dev is mounted to different rootfs. The same goes for root uid/gid. Want to 'play' with root permissions - root your device or use QEMU instead since proot was designed for different purposes.\n\nI thought fuse is supposed to work at the user level. Right?\n\nThats on linux distributions only. Android sets strict permissions for /dev/fuse:\nxeffyr@archlinux:~:$ adb shell ls -l /dev/fuse\ncrw------- 1 root root 10, 229 2018-08-06 13:34 /dev/fuse\n- as you can see, /dev/fuse can be accessed only by root.\nWhile on Linux distro /dev/fuse available for all users:\nxeffyr@archlinux:~:$ ls -l /dev/fuse\ncrw-rw-rw- 1 root root 10, 229 \u0430\u0432\u0433 10 15:33 /dev/fuse. @robsmith11 It seems that this is not a Termux-only problem.\n\n\nCopying multi-line text from browser:\n\n\n\nResult of pasting into 'GNU Nano' editor:\n\n\n\nResult of pasting into 'QuickEdit Pro' third-party editor:\n\n\n\n-- As you can see, the result (2 & 3) is independent of which Android program is used. ~~However, in Termux this may be related to this commit: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/commit/be6a73d862ab8ae2b7a5cc37f281ea0fbd0d118d, but I'm unsure and should check...~~\n\nUPD: I have tested Termux without these commits: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/commit/be6a73d862ab8ae2b7a5cc37f281ea0fbd0d118d, https://github.com/termux/termux-app/commit/ec1087d56ff9d879256fa55c8a255e888c7a5d5e.

Closing as required only on specified devices with low Android versions (android 5 and maybe 6) only.\n. It is normal that you don't have write access to the external sd card. This is just Android's limitation.. > When I updated my phone (Moto Z) from Android 7 to Android 8 termux lost write-access to the sdcard.\n\nWhy would only termux be subject to such an limitation?\n\n\n\nThe good question is why you had write access to external sdcard on Android 7. Google introduced restriction for sdcard write access from Android 4.4 (kitkat).\n\n\nOther applications may use Storage access framework for accessing external sdcards but it is not possible tell Termux's binaries to use this framework.\n\n\nAs workarond, Termux provides tool termux-setup-storage which will setup all necessary symlinks in dir ~/storage.\n\n\nSome links about sdcard issue:\n https://www.xda-developers.com/android-l-may-change-sd-card-access-rules/\n https://www.androidpit.com/how-to-fix-sd-card-problem-on-kitkat. > Snippets of ls reveals that everybody lacks the write permission for the sdcard.\nOn my device too (Samsung Galaxy S7):\n\n. > I now have the same issue from upgrading to android 7 to android 8.1\nThis is Android's issue, not Termux's. We can't do anything here: permission for accessing external sdcard is provided via Storage Access Framework which can't be used by command line applications for obvious reason.\n\nOne thing i also noticed is that the /sdcard directory is the internal storage, instead of the sdcard\n\nOn typical Android devices /sdcard is internal (shared) storage regardless of which Android version is used, exception is here only when device is either old or vendor use a custom design of Android OS instead of suggested by Google.. Closing in favor of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/897.. >  --arch=armv7l stable debian\n@myfreess Use armhf or armel instead. Check this: https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/mips/ch02s01.html.en. @ttrash Since access to files /proc/uptime, /proc/loadavg, /proc/stat is restricted by SELinux, regular program can't read these files (root needed).\nHowever there is an exception for /system/bin/uptime and busybox uptime: these tools use a system call instead of reading mentioned files to obtain needed system information.\nAnd just for note: all programs in /system/bin and /system/xbin have necessary SELinux labels so they may have extended rights for accessing files under /proc. Try command busybox top and /system/bin/top and you will see the difference.\n\nalso, this is a library problem\n\nWhere you got this information ? Which library ?\n\ntherefore is not my system/phone to blame\n\nUnfortunately, you have to blame SELinux...\n\nplease fix, thank you !\n\nWe cannot fix SELinux since this is a system feature.. @ttrash This linking error is Samsung-specific (same on my Samsung Galaxy S7, but not on other devices), so you have to do this:\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH= /system/bin/uptime\n 12:44:16 up 10 days, 21:31,  0 users,  load average: 5.66, 5.70, 5.92\nFor me, just uptime works as well:\n$ uptime\n 12:45:43 up 10 days, 21:32,  load average: 5.72, 5.69, 5.89\n. @ttrash Sorry, my mistake =).

However, I found some issues that those modifications may cause:\n\n\nMemory leaks. Not critical as it is less than 1 KB (usually less than 200 bytes).\n\n\nSome programs may not work with long prefixes (like /data/data/io.va.exposed/virtual/data/user/0/com.termux/files). Program will just print error (like UNIX socket path '...' is too long. Path must be less than 108 bytes. ) or crash.\n\n\nIn other cases, like using application as secondary users no major issues found.. @tomty89 Yes, rebuilding with needed PREFIX is optimal solution for this issue, but maybe it is not flexible as @CaiMiao want.. @CaiMiao The only solution is do to something as shown here: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/836#issuecomment-420634954, but this won't be used in Termux so probably you have to do this on your own. There are no usable solutions other than patching to get dynamic prefix.. > Suspecting that seccomp filter blocks link().\n@kisik21 SELinux does not allow usage of link() by regular applications.\nThe only solutions are:\n1.  Use proot --link2symlink {your application that use link()} (package 'proot' needed), but this does not create hardlinks.\n2. Patch your application so it will create symlinks instead of hardlinks.. > Is there a way to somehow make not symlinks, but copies with proot?\nIf your application will run under proot (with link2symlink), it will see link()'ed file as hardlink.\n\nOr patch an app to do this\n\nTermux app is emulator for terminal (console) only. Everything else is use only what is provided by Android. We can't change this !\n\nis there a copy syscall\n\nLinux kernel does not have such syscall (having it is pointless as such feature can be easily implemented on user level). See this to view what's Linux provides: https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/ (this is for x86, on ARM/AArch64 it is different).\n\nHere I posted solutions for this that will allow to run your application without 'permission denied' error. But if you really want hardlinks, just root your device and disable selinux enforcing.. @Gamekiller17 Try this:\n\n\nRestore original sources.list:\necho \"deb https://termux.net stable main\" > ${PREFIX}/etc/apt/sources.list\n\n\nRemove sources.list.d (just in case). Make sure that you copied command correctly:\nrm -rf ${PREFIX}/etc/apt/sources.list.d. > There's no /etc in my com.termux/files/usr/\n\n\n@Blocked How is that possible ? What else is missing ? bin/login or bin/bash ?\n\nI did nothing unusual\nMy .bash_history has nothing unusual either. \n\nDeleting files with rm is not unusual. And strange effects of this (like something not working) is not unusual too.\n@Blocked So what you actually did to break your installation ?. > here's no /bin in com.termux/files/usr/ either.\n@Blocked That was LOL. Assume that you just deleted critical part of OS on your computer.\n\nMy last 5 bash commands:\ngit checkout ..\ngit tag v3.1 ...\ngit tag ..\ngit tag v3.9 ..\ngit tag\nexit\n\n~~Ok, I figured out that you did. You used git to manage stuff in /usr. Never use git for such purposes !\nIn checkout, rebase and other similar commands, git will delete files before putting ones from different revision.~~\n~~Just remember that git is a revision control system and not backup tool.~~\n\nNow, move your necessary files from $HOME to /sdcard, then completely reinstall Termux. And remember:  we are not responsible about misuse of command line tools or Termux application.. > You are now in a Failsafe Session. It launches the default Shell of Android /system/bin/sh with access to the Termux directory\nSo, maybe that's why /bin and /etc is not present.\n@Blocked No. It just launches /system/bin/sh instead of $PREFIX/bin/login.\nBut anyway, you used something that removed $PREFIX/bin. This is not a Termux's fail.\nAnd it is not possible to repair environment that was broken in such way.. > Aren't they kind of symlinked? Maybe because mkshrc failed, It didn't link or something like that? \n@Blocked Mkshrc (and whole /system/bin) has no relation to Termux environment ($PREFIX). Usually mkshrc errors appear when Termux launches /system/bin/sh instead of $PREFIX/bin/login. It throws errors because env vars $PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH are wrong for /system/etc/mkshrc.\nSee how login shell is chosen (snippet from termux-app):\n``` .java\n        if (executablePath == null) {\n            for (String shellBinary : new String[]{\"login\", \"bash\", \"zsh\"}) {\n                File shellFile = new File(PREFIX_PATH + \"/bin/\" + shellBinary);\n                if (shellFile.canExecute()) {\n                    executablePath = shellFile.getAbsolutePath();\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        if (executablePath == null) {\n            // Fall back to system shell as last resort:\n            executablePath = \"/system/bin/sh\";\n        }\n        isLoginShell = true;\n    }\n\n```\n$PREFIX is a standalone environment with no external deps with exception for Android's libc, libdl, liblog and some more.\n\nrm -rf /data/data/com.termux/files/usr\nSo, Can I trigger that and save my $HOME ?\n\nHome is located in /data/data/com.termux/files/home, so when you remove usr, your home will be saved. I actually do this when I need to quickly get a fresh environment.\nYou can even do this:\nmv /data/data/com.termux/files/usr /data/data/com.termux/files/usr.bak\n- this will rename $PREFIX instead of deleting. But after reopening Termux application a new $PREFIX will be installed.. @AJ-Creations Try to launch it with -w argument. E.g. tcpsvd -vE 0.0.0.0 1024 ftpd -w /, it works after that in read-write mode.. @ardyfeb Make sure that you entering correct port.. Have you tried termux-setup-storage before starting ftp server ? Is ls /sdcard/ or touch /sdcard/myfile works ?. @AJ-Creations Why you prefer 0.0.0.0 over 127.0.0.1 in address field ?. @verboze This is already done in https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/792. Just application with these changes (and many other) is not released.. @myfreess Just a behaviour of bash - binary path caching. Run hash -r to fix.\n@pulketo coreutils can be safely removed as this is non-default package on Termux, initial utilities are provided by busybox..

Yes, if you mount /data & /system partitions and then properly setup environment variables but know that this way of using Termux is unsupported (do not report TWRP/Aroma errors).. > I thought instead of sessions being numbered, they could have a default name that either matches the current working directory,\n\nAnd automatically overwrite a value that was set by user. That's shouldn't be implemented on application's side. It is not possible to distinguish if a value was set by user or application.\n\nLike, if you run vim myfile.txt, it'll change the title to that, \n\nThis done easily, e.g. with Bash:\ntrap 'printf \"\\e]0;%s\\a\" \"${BASH_COMMAND//[^[:print:]]/}\"' DEBUG\n\nI think this would help keep track of what's being done with each session without having to name them. What do you guys think?\n\nThe best way to achieve this, is to edit your bashrc. Terminal application never should do something on it's own.\nThis even can be put to default bashrc or similar, so this feature will be available immediately. Or it can be commented out.. With Zsh and I guess with others, this can be done too.. Closing since question purely about shell scripts/config.

On Android, each application is sandboxed, has own user/group id and protected by SELinux.\nBut, since you are using QuickEdit Pro, it is possible to have access to Termux via SFTP.\nYou will need to have OpenSSH installed and ssh rsa key. Connection setup in QuickEdit should be look like this:\n\nP.S. I use QuickEdit Pro too.. Forget about linker warning. They are common on Android 5.\n@Grimler91 Maybe this should be closed ? Seems like duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2846.. > probably a recent upgrade of termux-api package.\nNo, this can't be caused by termux-api as termux-wake-lock is part of package 'termux-tools'. But this issue can occur on Android 5 and 6, and can affect all packages that use java-based utilities.\nSee https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/334. Output of logcat -d is needed too (immediately after executing termux-api command).\nAlso you may try to execute this:\nfor lib in $(find /system/framework -type f -iname \\*.jar); do\n    BOOTCLASSPATH=${lib}:${BOOTCLASSPATH};\ndone\nBOOTCLASSPATH=${BOOTCLASSPATH%%:}\nexport BOOTCLASSPATH\n- helped me to deal with non-working termux-api (and others like dx, apksigner, ecj) when I used Android 6 on my device.. @mayureshw In this case see https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/217#issuecomment-419978116.\nThere no solution other than wiping dalvik cache from recovery.\nHave you ever executed termux-wake-lock as root ?\n\nWhy this happens\nShortly: DalvikVM never should be called from regular application but Termux does it.\nSince Termux puts dalvik cache file (a one that ends in *@classes.dex) to system directory /data/dalvik-cache, Android doesn't know anything about it. And when Termux changes it's UID or you accidentaly run termux-wake-lock from root shell, the dalvik cache file becomes inaccessible.. >Anyway I tried wiping dalvik cache as suggested\n\nfastboot erase cache\n\nNothing that there a big difference between Wipe Dalvik Cache and Wipe Cache Partition ? Also, dalvik cache should be wiped from recovery.\n\nDuring reinstallation twrp gave errors like \"can't mount cache\" etc. The errors went away after wiping cache once again. I lost a lot of data.\n\nIf you want to use fastboot, use fastboot format cache next time instead of erase. Also, if you will do only required things, then you won't lose data.\n\nEverything that you need is to select 'Dalvik Cache' in wipe menu:\n\nWiping dalvik cache doesn't harm anything. In fact, it sometimes may get restructured/optimized, that's why you observing Once in 2/3 days it used to go into \"issue-state\" and would get resolved on reboot..\nBut anyway, I never encountered such issue. Regardless of custom/stock ROMs.. > Tegra 2 cpu which lacks NEON instructions,\n\nIf not, re-install termux (or open a fail-safe session and see if the problem lies in some config file)\n\n@Grimler91 Re-installing won't help as Tegra 2 really don't have NEON instructions. Problem exists due to https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/blob/master/build-package.sh#L600.\nTo fix that, we have to recompile whole repository for ARM with -mfpu=vfp instead of -mfpu=neon.. @battlezone No. Assume that you have to recompile everything from source using PC & docker image.. Current Termux & packages build requires support for NEON instructions so Tegra 2 support is dropped. I guess that this issue will remain unresolved as Tegra 2 is old...\nBut let's wait what @fornwall will say about this. Replacing -mfpu=neon with -mfpu=vfp should be safe, so question is only about recompiling all ARM packages.. > I am not sure how I would get them loaded in Termux when I'm done building though.\nI can build 'bootstrap' archive with base packages and upload it here (in case someone need it). Then everything that you will need, is only to unpack it in fail-safe shell in $PREFIX. Everything else will be installable via dpkg -i ..... Archive with basic packages (ARM, -mfpu=vfp): base-pkgs-vfp.tar.gz\nUsage:\n\nEnable storage access permission for Termux in Android settings.\nPut downloaded file base-pkgs-vfp.tar.gz to /sdcard\nOpen failsafe shell in Termux.\nUncompress archive (my ROM have gzip but no gunzip so tar isn't working properly): gzip -d /sdcard/base-pkgs-vfp.tar.gz\nGo to Termux base dir: cd /data/data/com.termux/files\nRemove old environment: rm -rf usr\nExtract fixed environment: tar xf /sdcard/base-pkgs-vfp.tar.gz\nDone!. > Can I ask what is the underlying reason for impossibility?\nI manually chmod files/folders, and it seems fine.\n\n\n\n@torappinfo Chmod doesn't change SELinux contexts, btw. For users with recent Android versions (assume 6.0+) and stock ROMs chmod 777 {file or directory} isn't working.\nIf this works for you, the best way to chmod something that you need or chmod 777 -R $PREFIX. But this shouldn't be done for package manager.. @Grimler91 Why not to just close this issue ? This will motivate people to clearly describe the problem.\nWe don't have package ussu anyway, I even unsure that this thing exist... If su binary segfaults, then this anyway not Termux's problem and solution in this case to try a different version of Magisk/SuperSU.\nLikely that @rahulsikdar224 has Termux installation issue, but anyway, it is impossible to figure out what 'segfaults' exactly.. > from custom repostories\nCan you tell which exactly 'custom' repositories ?\n\n/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash: not found\n\nWondering why nothing was disappeared from /sdcard...\nThe main rule of shell user is to always know what you are doing =).\n\nHow can i repair this\n\nDeleted shell binary cannot be repaired. Also we don't know what else is missing.\n\nbackup Termux data?\n\ncd ~/\ntar -cvf /sdcard/home.tar .\nAnother variant is just to copy a directory, but permissions will be lost:\ncp -a $HOME /sdcard/termux-home\nIf main shell isn't working at all, try fail-safe shell then.\n\nTermux is a single-user 'system'. This is by design and can't be changed. You need to be extremely careful when downloading and executing scripts from the Internet as things that may occur can be even worse than missing bash.. > Debian armel repositories\nTermux is not a Linux distribution. It depends on Android's libc and linker, this means that programs from Debian are not working here. If they working, why we have to use own repo ?\nAlso, Termux doesn't following standards (it is not possible here). For example, our root file system is stored in /data/data/com.termux/files/usr.\nRead this article on Termux Wiki: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Differences_from_Linux\nWe never supported Debian/Ubuntu repositories as main ones for Termux. And never will be support. Just ABI incompatibility + our primary target is 100% compatibility with Android.\nNext time install Debian packages in chroot.\nReferences:\n1. https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/706\n2. https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/714#issuecomment-276293136\n3. https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/226#issuecomment-269852647\n4. https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/688#issuecomment-390723380\n\nHow can i do that?\n\nSwipe right to open drawer and do long-click on 'keyboard' button. Then tap 'failsafe'.\n@Grimler91 Issue can be closed.. > What I am looking for is to start SSHD by sending an intent\nVariants of what could be done for this:\n1. Termux:Intents plugin. It may implement APIs for opening Termux session with executed arbitrary command and/or executing arbitrary command by third party application without opening Termux session and somehow returning output of this command.\n\nA functionality mentioned above will be integrated into Termux and it will be possible to enable/disable it via checkbox in settings.\n\nThese arbitrary intents/broadcasts should be disabled by default.\n\nAnd imagine the possibilities of 3rd Party Plugins! :O\n\nAnd how these plugins will interact with Termux ? They won't be able to read/write files under $PREFIX or $HOME anyway. To share user id between applications, the same signature is required.. > I'm having difficulty knowing whether you are in support of or against this idea.\nI support this idea. But it should be properly implemented as not all users want to have $HOME or $PREFIX freely accessible by third party apps.\n\nAnd, other apps already can view and edit Termux files. Try termux-open.\n\nI know about termux-open. But it seems doesn't support opening file for editing, only viewing/sending:\n$ termux-open -h\nUsage: termux-open [options] path-or-url\nOpen a file or URL in an external app.\n  --send               if the file should be shared for sending\n  --view               if the file should be shared for viewing (default)\n  --chooser            if an app chooser should always be shown\n  --content-type type  specify the content type to use\nFor example, when trying to save text file in QuickEdit, it shows error \"write failed: EBADF (Bad file descriptor)\". So file can be saved only on /sdcard but not in $HOME.\nAlso, the termux-open provides access to the single file (not directory). So, what if a third-party plugin should unpack multiple files to directory in $HOME ? Or what if someone will create a Termux-based \"IDE\" that should have free access to Termux private directories like $HOME or $TMPDIR for working with executables and other files ?\nThe main problem in implementing third-party plugins for Termux is that Android applications having different user id are sandboxed and can't interact with each other on file system level. This was possible on old Android versions by just doing chmod 777 on specific private app directories, but after SELinux was introduced, this became impossible.. Android NDK doesn't define S_BLKSIZE.. > Can not install gcc via apt install gcc\nGCC was replaced by clang. See https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2511, https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/369, https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/407.\npkg install clang. Ctrl-d is not working ? Or you are experiencing https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/56 or https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/627 ? If these issues, then wait for next Termux version (fix in https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/793).. Generally, Ctrl-d pressed in shell closes current shell process. So it doesn't kill entire Termux session.\n\ngraphical close button\n\nThere already a Kill process button that will kill Termux session. Just long tap somewhere and menu will appear.\n\nBut I think that it will be better to rename it, for example, to Kill session.. It is possible to put a button to the drawer. But it will be hidden for some users anyway as only wiki mentions about existence of drawer. The same goes for 'menu'.. > what is the command to start ffmpeg?\nIt's ffmpeg, isn't it ?\nUse dpkg -L to see what's available in package:\n$ dpkg -L ffmpeg | grep /bin/\n/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/ffmpeg\n/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/ffprobe\n\n\ni have it installed but it is not running when i use shortcuts\n\nTry to capture a command's output to file, e.g.\nffmpeg > $HOME/log.txt 2>&1\nto figure out what's happens.. > Is this the same issue/would this fix reset not doing that?\nExactly.. @jarun Have you tried to use the following command ? (with -d '\\n')\nxargs -0 -a ~/.nnncp -d '\\n' rm -ir. I tried the following:\n1. Ssh to remote server\n2. Launch tmux on remote server\n3. Tap on \"exit\" button to close termux app.\n- then launch termux again and do ps aux. As result, issue wasn't reproduced. Even pidof ssh didn't show anything. Session was terminated successfully.. > cat doesn't seem to have a tty any more\nThis happens only with \"cat\" or with all programs (e.g. bash) from terminated session ?. If bash exits, then all it's child processes should exit too. This happens on Android 8 and lower as it should. But on Android 9 this mechanism seems broken.. Just reporoduced it on Android 9 emulator.. Termux doesn't delivers any signal. Shell receives SIGHUP from kernel when tty is closed. Typical behaviour of most (if not all) terminal emulators.. > So something is delivering SIGKILL.\nYeah, shell receives SIGKILL.  That's okay.\n.java\n    public void finishIfRunning() {\n        if (isRunning()) {\n            try {\n                Os.kill(mShellPid, OsConstants.SIGKILL);\n            } catch (ErrnoException e) {\n                Log.w(\"termux\", \"Failed sending SIGKILL: \" + e.getMessage());\n            }\n        }\n    }\nI'll try to manually send a kill signal to the shell without closing session to see what happens.\n\nUPD:\n\nRunning killall -9 bash terminates all processes including running \"cat\".\nTerminating bash on single session (kill -9 {bashpid}) lefts \"cat\" running - effect same as of \"exit\" button.. > Huh, why does Termux send SIGKILL?\n\nIf I replace SIGKILL with SIGHUP, nothing changes. Bash stopped as it should, but \"cat\" left in background.\n\nShouldn't the SIGHUP you mentioned suffice?\n\nYes, should be enough. At least, it will allow shell to save history.\nI'll look on replacing kill signal with hup, if no bad effects a pull request will be submitted.\nRegarding this issue, it may come from Android. But I don't know why.\nHave you checked if same issue reproducible in https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jackpal.androidterm ?. With jackpal's androidterm things even worse than with Termux - shells are not terminated. It's definetly Android issue.. > I tried, but ps in that app only shows me processes from the same window\nps -A -o tty,comm.

How to use bash/zsh/fish ? How to write a program ? Or what ? You just don't know what you need ?\nTermux is just an interface to the shell (e.g. bash). On the Internet you can find plenty information about it. Manpages also available as well as most command line utilities have embedded help information (use flags -h or --help).\n\n\nTermux's wiki url\n\n@jusdepatate Wiki's url is well hidden, isn't it ?\n\nButton to open wiki is available too:\n\n\nthat explain what does \"Aquire Wakelock\" means, where's the drawer, where are the files, what are the termux-only commands (getprop, ...), how does Termux's pkg works, Termux's wiki url, how does Termux:API work...\n\nAll (or nearly all) answers on Wiki.\n\n\nwhere's the drawer: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/User_Interface\n```\nThe navigation drawer is revealed by swiping inwards from the left part of the screen. It has three elements:\nA list of sessions. Clicking on a session shows it in the terminal while long pressing allows you to specify a session title.\nA button to toggle visibility of the touch keyboard.\nA button to create new terminal sessions (long press for creating a named session or a fail-safe one).\n```\n\n\nwhere are the files: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Differences_from_Linux\n\n\nwhat are the termux-only commands (getprop, ...) - it's android-only commands. Most people don't need them, others know what they doing. Android does not provide description for /system/bin commands. Also, we can't be sure that these commands will have same behaviour on all Android versions.\n\n\nhow does Termux:API work: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:API\nThis addon exposes device functionality as API to command line programs in Termux.\n- perfect short explanation of what Termux:API does. Why explanation should be longer ?. > Termux-help or termux-tutorial or something\n\n\nOr termux-wiki command that launches a browser to open a Termux Wiki URL.\nAdd this to bashrc:\ntermux-wiki() {\n    termux-open-url https://wiki.termux.com\n}\nand restart session.\n\nTermux Wiki is written by Termux users. If you found something missing - you can fix that =). Wiki is easiest way to contribute and have all information that you or someone else need.. > It's not obvious at first glance when downloading the app from the play store that there is a help menu\n\nI think a better position for the link would be in the side swipe pane.\n\nThis \"side swipe pane\" is not obvious too for some user. As I remember, either on Gitter, Google+ or Github was a question related to it.\nSome people even can't find a link to wiki that shown on session. I guess I shouldn't point where wiki's link exactly located in the motd:\n. > Is there is any way to run different OS as a base in Termux (instead of Debian-ish OS)?\nIt's not OS. Just set of patched & packaged programs. See https://github.com/termux/termux-packages.\nOS here is only one - Android.. For people that want autocorrect, prediction and swipe typing, there is https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Touch_Keyboard#Text_Input_View.\nJust open Extra keys row and swipe it left.. > But how can I make that?\n\n\nSwipe left.\n\n\n\nEdit text field will appear after swiping.\n\n. > Would it be possible to provide Orbot integration from the app?\n\n\npkg install tor torsocks ?\nOr you mean transparently redirect traffic from command line tools ? This is not possible. F-Droid does it over Android API. But command line tools are completely independent, even if they running from application.\nOrbot's VPN is the only variant here.. torsocks is the only way to make \"transparent\" proxying in Termux. Another variant is to try some environment variables:\n1. This should work for libcurl-based programs:\nexport all_proxy=\"socks5://127.0.0.1:9050\"\n\nThese commands may work for other programs, but likely that not:\nexport http_proxy=\"socks5://127.0.0.1:9050\"\nexport https_proxy=$http_proxy\n\nAgain, it is not possible to setup network redirect widely if torsocks is not working. Termux is just application that executes command line programs, it's not OS and can't have own network stack.\nYou can try to setup a transparent proxy with package tor, if you have rooted device. But you will probably mess up the Android's iptables.. > Is it a lost cause because there is no librt in android (apparently) ?\nYes, librt is not available on Android, it replaced by libc.so/bionic. Just patch YCM sources to remove linking to librt.\nOr try to create file $PREFIX/lib/librt.so which will act as linking script:\necho \"INPUT(-lc)\" > $PREFIX/lib/librt.so. I don't see any problem with Termux here.\nIf your CPU doesn't support hardware floating point, you are out of luck - this is not fixable. Use a different device.\nP.S. What device you use ?.

However tput E3 and printf \"\\e[3J\" are working.. It is not possible to create device nodes without root, if /data was mounted with nodev option then it won't work even with root. It's general Android/Linux permission denial error, it has nothing to do with Termux itself.. >  kali-archive-keyring\nAnd how \"kali-archive-keyring\" is related to Termux ? This is not Termux's error at all!. The TYPE_CLASS_TEXT however still enables predictive input and it can't be disabled by adding flag TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS.\nI still searching for solution since Jackpal's Android Terminal uses TYPE_NULL but it resets the input type somehow, so keyboard becomes correct.. Switched to\n.java\nInputType.TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_VISIBLE_PASSWORD | InputType.TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS\nAccording to commit history, this is what was used on the early Termux versions. This will restore issue https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/87, but additional number row is much better than invalid keyboard type.\nStill no idea why this problem does not affect Jackpal's Android Terminal, it use TYPE_NULL as Termux:\n.java\n    @Override\n    public InputConnection onCreateInputConnection(EditorInfo outAttrs) {\n        outAttrs.inputType = mUseCookedIme ?\n                EditorInfo.TYPE_CLASS_TEXT : // word-based input\n                EditorInfo.TYPE_NULL; // character-based input\n        return new BaseInputConnection(this, true) {. As this issue mostly related to samsung keyboards, I guess it will be better to implement for termux.properties something like this:\nsamsung-keyboard-fix = true\nThe purpose of such option will be more clear than something like TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_VISIBLE_PASSWORD.. @Amarjit3 Have you read Termux Wiki about this ?\nBefore messing with termux-chroot and sshd, I suggest to try instructions on wiki.\nAbout SSH on Termux Wiki:\n https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access#Setting_up_password_authentication - password authentication.\n https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access#Setting_up_public_key_authentication - pubkey authentication.. @Amarjit3 Instead of messing with chroot/termux-chroot/proot I suggest you to start with this:\n\n\nInstall OpenSSH:\npkg install openssh\n\n\nSet password:\npasswd\n\n\nStart (or restart) ssh daemon:\nkillall sshd\nsshd\n\n\nTry connect to localhost. Enter the password set in step 2.\nssh -p 8022 localhost\n\n\n- these steps are required to make sure that SSH working correctly.\n\n\nI am able to login using SSH, however, I am asked for a password\n\n@Amarjit3 Can you explain \"able to login\" ? You got a shell ? Because if you were prompted for password, you are not logged in.. There no way to launch Termux with http link.. Closing as this feature unlikely to be implemented.. @fornwall I guess intents much better to jump from different apps. Otherwise which app use URL for jumping into Termux ?\n\nI guess that feature described on https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/446 will be better than just opening Termux app.. @bartekpacia I haven't checked, but this issue may affect notifications of Termux:API too. So maybe we will need a one more fix.. > Document provider support to make files accessible for third-party apps\nHmm. It is not implemented already ?\nI just was able to select files from Termux internal storage:\n\n. > With logcat I get E termux messages.\n~~Usage of Ctrl+something is blocked because it will interfere with bash/readline key shortcuts.~~\n~~Another reason, ctrl is reserved for hardware keyboard shortcuts: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Hardware_Keyboard.~~\n@RalfWerner You have typo in configuration file.\nBut anyway, some combinations interfere with reserved shortcuts. This include: ctrl + c, ctrl + z and other.\n\nUnfortunately with a bug too:\ntermux-media-player play check.jpg\n\nThis is not a bug. Media player can't be used on images.\nUse something like termux-open.. Closing in favor of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/995 - there problem described much cleaner.. No, author cannot add sudo privileges. Root your device to get them.\nThen pkg install tsu..

Duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/56.\nFor the current design of Termux application thats not possible.\nTermux offers user-manageable environment, therefore no way to predict all kinds of errors that may occur. To prevent user lock-out of his files in $HOME, we have to prevent session auto-closing.\nRegarding widgets, you can spawn background sessions which are not visible. On wiki page there information how to make scripts spawn background sessions: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:Widget. Just put scripts to ~/.shortcuts/tasks instead of ~/.shortcuts.\nAlso, the line \"[Process completed - press Enter]\" will be shown only for last session. This means that you will have to press enter only when application closes.. Okay, leaving this \"opened\". ~~But I'm not sure that something will change in near future.~~\n~~This can be implemented through signals, https://github.com/cvirostek/termux-app/commit/cfdddcca45ed062fc70f60f292e8808951914c88, I'll need to check if this will be suitable.~~. https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/1028. > hopefully it'll be merged\nIt is not ready. However, I can leave implementation of the \"Settings menu\" for next time and in this case it will be ready.\n\nI take it this should fix issue #56 as well?\n\nI currently haven't disabled this message. But after implementing menu it is no longer needed.. Enabled auto-closing for all sessions.\nAll settings-related stuff is dropped for now - it will be major change, so leave it for future.\nPR is ready.. Will be re-implemented as additional launcher icon.. Launcher 3 bugs are not Termux bugs !\nThe only change that could cause this is a chaning of icon type (maybe 4b52cfbb933444eb8fe671c4b525c1855b4df91f or 7056945f5d62e9b0df7001ef2e382227725cf38f if I not missed something). But since this new icon type is officially supported by Android, we probably won't change it.. > is launcher3 and android thing, or a lenovo thing ?\nIf preinstalled and undeletable, then it both lenovo's and Android's thing.\nBut anyway, if third-party application is able to crash system thing, then this is a flaw of system thing and theoretically can be even considered as DoS vulnerability since system launcher became unusable.\nOS/Vendor-related bugs won't be fixed from our side.. @Grimler91 I guess launcher just can't handle the our new icon - this is the only change between v0.65 and v0.66 that can trigger such behaviour.\nLikely it is because of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/commit/7056945f5d62e9b0df7001ef2e382227725cf38f.\nIf someone wants to test, I can build Termux app with reverted https://github.com/termux/termux-app/commit/7056945f5d62e9b0df7001ef2e382227725cf38f.\nBut anyway, crashing launcher with vector icon is something.... nonsense.. Okay, I reverted icon changes: app-debug.apk.gz (gunzip before use + make sure that plugins are not installed).. @vpelletier Downgrading is not possible when versionCode changed. Exception is for ADB, but only for debuggable APKs.. > install a specific version of Python\nYou can always compile it yourself.\n\nor at least downgrade?\n\nNo. We do not keep older versions to simplify maintenance of repositories.. @consultron I guess the \"security issue\" was in specifying paths that pretend to be absolute, though I can be wrong.... a. Android prohibits filesystem level access to the EXTERNAL sdcards.\nb. It is not possible to use Storage Access Framework with CLI programs.\nc. FUSE on Android is allowed only for root.\nd. We are not going to bloat application with various \"hacks\".\nI should continue ??. BTW, there is still partial access to the external sdcard. Use tool \"termux-setup-storage\" - it will create necessary dirs/symlinks, e.g. ~/storage/external-1 which is private Termux directory on external sdcard.\n\nWhy people can't understand that Termux is \"regular\" application that can't overtake Android's permissions ?. Closing as I can't understand what is requested/reported here.\n\n\nNext time please use \"Google Translate\" (or similar) to translate the text to english.. Do not mix installations from F-Droid and Google Play.\nInstall everything from either Google Play or F-Droid (I know that v0.66 is not available on fdroid).. Sqlmap has no any relation with official Termux packages.\nAbout copying files - is it a problem to use commands \"termux-setup-storage\", then \"cp\" to copy them to /sdcard ? I think not.. Duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2846.. pkg install grep\nhash -r\nAnd grep works...\nDefault grep is from busybox, so if you use it immediately after installation, you need to refresh bash's search path via hash -r.. Fairly easy was able to get this:\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. mkdir ~/test\n2. cd ~/test\n3. Open new session and rm -rf ~/test.\n4. Open new session.\nGNOME terminal in this case opens $HOME.. Thanks, now it works fine.. > Though TermuxOpenReceiver the files in $HOME are available to other apps.\nThat is also true for sensible data like ssh-keys.\nO_o\nSSH keys are not password protected ?\n\nCould you add a config option to disable TermuxOpenReceiver?\n\nIt is hardcoded into AndroidManifest.xml.\n\nBut I still agree that we need proper file access management. And not only because of privacy issues.\nUpdate:\nTermuxOpenReceiver uses Android storage access framework. It doesn't allow third-party apps silently access your files. So, unless specific files will be selected, they won't be read by third-party application.. Never experienced such issue.\nI watched your video and it looks like it correctly pastes the text. Last character gets deleted when you press enter which points on keyboard issue.\nWhich keyboard do you use ?. > export PS1=\"\\n\\e[1;30m\\u@\\h\\e[0m \\w \\e[1;34m`parse_git_branch`\\n\\e[0m\\$ \"\nYou have a problem with your PS1.\nHow to solve, answer is in https://superuser.com/a/223157. Escape sequences should be placed between \\[ and \\], otherwise Bash will calculate prompt length incorrectly.\nClosing as not a bug.. Wine currently is not supported in Termux.\nAlso, wine can run only programs compiled for your device architecture. Example: if your device is ARM, you can run only ARM EXE (Win PE) executables !. Confirming that problem exists:\n. Wine is not supported for now.\nDuplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/1018.\n\n\nIf I install wine32 can I running the program ?\n\nWine can run only programs compiled for same architecture that wine. So, for example if your wine installation is AArch64, then you can run only AArch64 EXEs - forget about pc/x86 in this case.\nThat's why you get:\n0009:err:process:create_process L\"Z:\\\\root\\\\SPRViewer.exe\" not supported on this installation (x86 binary)\nwine: Bad EXE format for Z:\\root\\SPRViewer.exe.\nWine is not emulator but only compatibility layer.\nClosing as offtopic since wine is not supported in Termux.. Closing since there really no problems with connection.... @fornwall I also made auto-closing for only \"0\" and \"130\" exit codes as we discussed on Gitter.. @ujeropoc Executing commands via URLs is weird solution from security side. It just won't be possible to use Android permissions here.\n\nMain idea is to allow execution only for limited set of applications. That's not possible for URLs - only either allow all URLs or not allow. Whitelisting also bad, think 3 times why.... Observed the same issue yesterday, thought it affects only me.\nCan be fixed in this way https://github.com/xeffyr/termux-app/commit/ef12842e7e2255e622cae40c3abc46320643593b - we just need to force-reload colors once new session started.. I use custom build of Termux application which has styling embedded. So I just didn't tested Termux:Styling well with original app.\nProblem is that Termux app updates fonts or colors only on:\n Application cold start.\n When font or color is selected in styling menu.\n* termux-reload-settings is executed.. I opened a PR which fixes that.. If Termux crashing the component of your OS, then nothing can be done there (behaviour similar to https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/991).. Can you try the Termux APK from post https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/991#issuecomment-466027732 ?. @Quasic On my keyboard a key for \"uppercase characters\" is interpreted as shift in Termux. If this works for all keyboards, then we don't need separate shift key at all.. Change smb://192.168.10.23/usb to smb://192.168.10.23/usb/.. > Is there any way to install the APT manpages?\nCurrently no.\nProblem is that APT manpages can't be built for some reason.. Duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/3380.. Metasploit is not official package for Termux.\nDuplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/3394\nLikely you have to reinstall not only metasploit but all it's dependencies.. @AadiRajUthup According to your comment https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/715#issuecomment-467937529, you did nothing. You have to REINSTALL ALL DEPENDENCIES from scratch for ruby 2.6.1.. * Remove old gems for ruby 2.6.0.\n Remove metasploit installation.\n Reinstall metasploit dependencies. I.e. make sure that gems installed for ruby 2.6.1 and not for 2.6.0.\n* Reinstall metasploit.\nIf you can't do this for whatever reason, reinstall Termux then.. > Do you have network problems?\nFor unknown reason, IPv6 downloads are really slow on some devices and Termux may bootstrap 10 minutes or more. I had similar issue when IPv6 was enabled in my network, but affected only ARM device.. Too much complicated.\nSpecial characters such as space and '&' should be encoded and you will end with 2. URL Encode \"termux:command%20arg1%20%22arg2%22\". That's weird as most users won't be able to create/deal with such URLs.\nSecurity.\nThere too much problems\n\n\nI guess you will agree that seeing dialog \"Allow to execute command XXXXXXXX ?\" each time will be annoying.\n\n\nAnother problem is that many users do not care about permissions. Therefore no matter, Android permission request or just a dialog, it won't help too much. Especially because of (1).\n\n\nFinal problem: what security checks should be done ??? It is not possible to know if command is secure without executing it. How application will distinguish if command if command listed in place \"a\" is acceptable and command listed in place \"b\" is forbidden ?\n\n\nSuch addon creates a good attack surface.\n\nhttps://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/1029 will allow to execute commands and it is ENOUGH.. We will not go further than allowing to execute commands with per-app permission.. #1029 is also solution for https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/804. Regarding https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/924, I'm very unsure that there will be solution unless it is possible to grant Android permission to ADB.. NFC is a task for Termux:API.\nhttps://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/1029 reasonable bare minimum for developing third party plugins (including QR scanner).\nWe won't allow arbitrary third-party applications to interact with Termux unless they have permission to do so. All commands should be sent via intent so Android can verify caller applications. URLs will allow to bypass this procedure.\nEither forget about commands executable via URLs or Make a fork!\nRegarding NFC and QR - they will not be available unless someone decide to submit a PR.. > i need to run an x86 program\n\nmy device is armv71\n\n\nUse QEMU (it can be found in https://github.com/termux/unstable-packages).\nGet a VPS.. Yes, add\nproperties\nback-key=escape\nto ~/.termux/termux.properties. Then execute termux-reload-settings. It works.. 1. Post output of termux-info.\n\nHave you upgraded packages with pkg upgrade ?. Things to do:\n\n\nCheck that your Internet connection is stable, i.e. there no high packet loss or ping. Provider's DPI system may cause this too.\n\nTry to run pkg update one more time (may help if your connection is unstable).\nDisable HTTPS: edit file $PREFIX/etc/apt/sources.list and change https to http.. Absolutely okay.

This is not a bug.. ## Compiling packages\n\nMake sure you have access to PC or at least VPS with docker installed.\nSetup docker container as described in https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/blob/master/docs/DOCKER.md.\nEnter docker container.\nOverride variables for prefix and home.\n    export TERMUX_PREFIX=/data/data/com.termux.support/files/usr\n    export TERMUX_ANDROID_HOME=/data/data/com.termux.support/files/home\n    Alternatively, you can edit script https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/blob/25aaa34b1afdc6c17e51a5c6dc692a59c216b8b7/scripts/build/termux_step_setup_variables.sh.\n\nDecide which packages you want to have in YOUR OWN REPOSITORY. Must have ones are: apt, dpkg, bash, dash, gnupg, busybox, termux-tools and all dependencies for these packages.\n\n\nBuild packages with ./build-package.sh {package name}. By default, build is done for AArch64, but if you need, for example, ARM - execute script in the following way: ./build-package.sh -a arm {package name}.\n\n\nBuilt deb files located in directory ./debs.\n\n\nGetting bootstraps\n\nSetup APT repository.\nUpload it to hosting.\nClone https://github.com/termux/termux-packaging\nCorrect urls in termux-packaging/src/apt_repo.rs\nBuild termux-packaging with cargo build - Rust installation required.\nAfter you obtain termux-packaging binary, execute it in way like ./termux-packaging bootstraps ./\n\n\nIf you can't use PC or VPS for some reason, you won't be able to build packages. If you can't setup package hosting, you will not be able to create bootstraps with official way. Application with modified prefix will be useless too.\nI provided enough instructions for creating own Termux APT repository and bootstraps with modified prefix. Everything else should be done by you, no matter how (you really need Termux app with custom prefix, right ?).. > ./scripts/run-docker.sh ./build-package.sh -i -a x86_64 libandroid-support\nSo... you need only libandroid-support ? How you will use it standalone ?\nIf you in doubt which packages you need to run custom Termux, build all of them.\n\nI have build success and file .deb. So how do I create .zip files?\n\nDude, read instructions carefully, from the first step to the last. Also know, that Termux is not offline-only thing. It is relying on package repository as well as utility for creating bootstraps.\n\nDid you built ALL REQUIRED PACKAGES ? Answer: no.\nDid you setup package hosting ? Answer: no.\nWhy no ? Because my instructions cover all these topics but you even didn't do the first one properly...\nShould we do this for you ? Obviously, no !. Duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/3502 ? Okay, closing.... Never mess with environment variables. Especially with LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LD_PRELOAD and PATH.. * Check if you have a stable connection. Run ping -c 10 termux.net, command should finish successfully without lost packets and high-ping spikes. If ping is not working properly, then you may have something bad either in your network or device.\n\nCheck if there no censorship campaigns in your country. Since termux.net is behind CloudFlare which is a large CDN, it may be a victim of access blocking.\n\nAs last thing, I may only suggest to disable HTTPS in your sources.list. Edit file $PREFIX/etc/apt/sources.list and carefully replace occurrencies of https with http.\nFor further notes, there no problems with termux.net, so everything is either in your network or device.. pkg upgrade. Duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/3507. Buttons size is determined by size of the smallest one, i.e. extra keys row has a table structure. If one of the rows will have a different length, then of course it will be shifted.\nYour keys:\n\nRemoved 2 keys from longest row:\n\nRemoved 2 more keys:\n\n. Never put slash at the end of git URL.\np.s. Repository either don't exist or is private.. Is there a file manager waiting for implementation of this feature ?\n\nReference implementation\nI have only used Termux before.\n\nPerhaps no.\n\n\nIn other words, provide a interface to other Apps.\n\nInterface must be implemented on both sides otherwise it will be useless because applications cannot automatically see and use them.. Do you have any examples of file managers that can pass directory to another applications ?\nJust checked FX File Explorer and Estrongs File Explorer - no one of them can pass directory requests to another application, I even know why. That's enough to close the issue.. You cannot execute Arch binaries from Termux without proot.\nJust linker and ABI incompatibility.. This definetly the worst thing that may happen.\nThough, in AVD with Android Q Preview Termux still works:\n\n\n. Not only signed with original key. It seems that executables will have to be placed to native lib directory:\n\nWhile exec() no longer works on files within the application home directory, it continues to be supported for files within the read-only /data/app directory. In particular, it should be possible to package the binaries into your application's native libs directory and enable android:extractNativeLibs=true, and then call exec() on the /data/app artifacts. A similar approach is done with the wrap.sh functionality, documented at https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/wrap-script#packaging_wrapsh . . Termux compiled with targetSdkVersion 29:\n\n\n\nExec is allowed from native lib directory:\n\nBut this directory is read-only.\nDistributing packages in APKs will either require to have hundreds of these APKs published to the Google Play / F-Droid or put multiple packages into single APK up to maximal size (~ 100MB). Technically it is possible to have very large APKs, but they cannot be distributed with Google Play and maybe F-Droid.\nBut anyway, distributing all packages in APKs is weird:\n\nSuch distribution may be a bit confusing from user's side.\nMuch longer waiting for updates, in case if distribution is done from Google Play.\n\nAlso, we should not forget that user environment will be broken:\n\nIt won't be possible to compile stuff in the Termux.\nIf somehow managed to compile, this stuff will be useless anyway.\nMost stuff installable with pip, gem, cpan will be broken.. If proot works, this means that we can left packages as-is. Proot also means that Termux will no longer be prefixed which is good as a lot of patches can be dropped + less headache with compiling software by user.\n\nWill try to package proot into Termux APK and run on Android Q AVD to test this.. > forbids any kind of JIT\nIf Google do this, it has to forbid javascript in browsers too.. @corbinlc Original proot worked. Even this anti-noexec extension not needed.\n\nSo under proot everything works fine:\n\nNo need to distribute packages in APKs or bundles. Everything that is needed is to launch shell under proot.. Why we need second line with - tools ?. @TacoTheDank Actually, Travis ignores the duplicated lines.. There problem with additional launcher icons on Android TV devices. Tested on Android virtual device from SDK. I don't know if it will work for real devices but since on AVD it is not working, I guess the optimal choice will be left old behaviour there..

    "ghost": "Thanks.\n. +1\n. On my old smartphone the volume keys are broken because I use termux very intensive.\nI use this keyboard APP wich has arrow keys:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextapp.inputmethod.latin\nBut it is not very accurate.... Why is that that difficult to use arrow keys in termux? I am still using an special keyboard app that offers the arrow keys. Unfortunately Gboard does not have these. . torappinfo:\n\nEdit: Now I put \"killall com.termux\" at the end of the script.\n\nThat works if you only have one shell running in termux.. Would a timeout be a solution? When there was a session with user input: close directly. When there was no user input, wait 15 seconds before closing while showing a cancel button (which cancels the closing).. @vaites What should be the use of this? If you enter a password, every (good) console application does not echo the password.. I think the best approach would be an option in tasker that can be switched on/off by the user. Maybe a check box in the long-press menu? If the user's profile is somehow corrupted or messed up, it can always be fixed by editing the files using another app or adb.. Very good point. I was also going to suggest a separate failsafe shortcut, or some way to start the app in \"failsafe\" mode.\nAlso i'd like to point out that the majority of termux users will be using a rooted device, so in this case it's always possible to remove the offending/broken script without losing any other data. So the \"broken beyond repair\" argument really only applies to the small minority of non-rooted ROM's or devices, which tbh i don't understand why such users would be using termux in the first place.\nPlus, waiting for Enter before closing the window/session just shows you (in some cases) what's going on, and doesn't really accomplish anything in terms of fixing it.. seems slightly different, alpha blended full screen overlay to keep an eye watch whether something interesting is happening in the background. Especially useful over the lockscreen.\n. Probably same bug as https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/35\n. +1. Thanks!. I was not talking about executing anything.  The scenario that I was thinking was this.\nImagine you want to download a custom rom to your internal storage.  With most system partitions being so small, you will not have enough space to do that using something like wget into the system partition since it is so SMALL.  But if you could save to internal storage as default, you would not be limited in the size of file that you wanted to download.  Especially if you want to download using something like wget or Axel.  Add to this the fact that currently one would need to have root access and use the SU command to access the internal storage and that termux packages can not be used as root under current circumstances.  \nOn top of all this, if someone downloads a file and wanted to just move it to internal storage, they can not do this WITHOUT root.\nI really feel that this is in the best interest of the user as it can improve security by not needing to use root, and add more functionality to non-root users.  Lastly if someone wants to view the downloaded file, from a file manager they still need root.  After all, isn't the point of termux to be able to do MORE in Android without needing to root a device?. @fornwall  So apparently I did some searching and termux-setup-storage allows you to do this without root.  Though I never knew this.  Any way we can have the app ask for permissions on first boot?. @fornwall Thank you!. This is not an issue with Termux. Starting in Android Nougat, apps are no longer allowed to see running processes.. This would mean rewriting top and other tools, and I'm not even sure it'd be possible then.. Why would there be permission in the API for reading running processes? Pretty useless imo. . @iammer Yes as they use the same thing.. @kstoykov Secure = iOS like? . I think we would just have to recompile every binary with a fake proc path eg /data/data/com.termux/files/emuproc . @fornwall \nAh, good point!  My bad for not testing that in isolation.\nThe script containing those lines is called from inotifyd.\nSo: \ninotifyd ~/someScript ~/notes. @fornwall \nI reproduced the issue with minimal scripting, below.\nI ran inotifyd to use the script.  I then edited a file in the ~/notes directory, and it erred twice while trying to invoke the script.\nI then hit ctrl+c and catted the script in question.\nMy PS1 generated [~], so that is not really part of anything there.\n```\n$ inotifyd ~/someScript ~/notes\n/data/data/com.termux/files/home/someScript[3]: can't create temporary file /data/local/sh8ej2ck.tmp: Permission denied\n/data/data/com.termux/files/home/someScript[3]: can't create temporary file /data/local/sho46ur3.tmp: Permission denied\n^C[~]\n$ cat someScript\n:<< 'SKIP'\nsome text\nSKIP\necho \"stuff\";\n```\nIf I do everything the same, except remove the first 3 lines from the script (the here document redirected to : ), I get:\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\nstuff\n. Basically if you want to use termux commands in any other shell application, you'd have to change the permissions of everything in the /data/data/com.termux folder. That is, unless you have root.. What other apps will use it if other apps would need a separate environment?. No.. You can close this issue now. I have installed it with packages but for some reason it still points to the BusyBox version. tmux and screen are great packages. Scratch screen, doesn't look like Termux has it :(. If you want to \"jam the machine\" use :(){ :|: & };:. Also if you want more sessions to keep a command running in the background you can add a \"&\" to the end and it'll run in the background. You can use killall to stop it.. A video would be helpful. Gg. Not sure, it's just a little convenient apt wrapper I guess.. Yes I would be.  However by adding it to the Amazon store we can reach more users that do not know about F-Droid.. I'm getting the same issue. I want to use gdb which require root.. @Grimler91 but it says \"operation not permitted\" when i try to attach to a process gdb -pid <pid>. root is needed :(. @Grimler91 no i'm trying to attach to apps outside termux that's why it needs root. setting these did not work for me.. android version is 5.0.2\n-bash-4.4$: ldd /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/brotlipy-0.7.0-py3.6-linux-aarch64.egg/brotli/_brotli.abi3.so\nlibandroid-support.so\nlibgnustl_shared.so\nlibpython3.6m.so.1.0\nlibdl.so\nlibc.so\nlibc.so,libdl.so and libm.so can be found in /system/lib64/.

Disabling the battery optimizations is the only real solution. It would be a good idea to ask the user for adding to the white list (ideally when first creating a wake lock)..

Use Android Terminal Emulator with portable PyPy or some other lightweight Python binaries. eGenix PyRun may work.. Also, why didn't you try SL4A?. @Phil11W If you don't reply (because it works?), please close this. If it still does not work, answer the question about the used keyboard.. @salmannkhw Isn't this related to Metasploit? Does it work in other environments (Debian/ Ubunut at a Laptop/ Desktop)?. Wouldn't it be possible to add arrow keys to the \"extended keyboard\" (the thing that appears when you long-press the keyboard button in the menu)? Or event better, to make it customize able (e.g. adding a \":\" for vim-users)?. @Quasic What is the benefit of this/ is there any issue with the current implementation? Could you add spaces at the left so that your code looks like it's inside the if-block?. @raphj The buttons are locked (tested at Android 7). Which Android version are you using?. @raphj It's related to your system settings.\n\nYou can select globally if notifications should appear at the lock screen, should appear at the lockscreen with sensitive things hidden or should not appear at the lock screen.\nYou can select the same thing per App (but only more secure or equal to the global setting).\n\nIf you chose to hide sensitive contents (which is in general a good idea if you setup a lockscreen and you are asked about that when you setup one), then the buttons are not shown until you authenticate.. @sdrausty Don't think so. Trying to build an Android APK with a Native Activity [no Java code] using Termux. Built an OpenGL ES Android APK for ARM architecture similar to the image below on Linux. Have used your build scripts before to build regular Android/Java APKs. Wanted to ask if it is even possible to build native Android APKs with Termux before I spend more time debugging. Your TermuxArch project is amazing though. You have a God-given talent. \nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/android/images/NeheAndroid03.png. @bluebat When should this sequences be used?. Did you try install via Termux repo or official tarball? If official install, too does not work, NVM may work still.. Try installation via NVM.. @Vm900 Does pkg install nodejs work? It installs version 8.11.2 (the latest LTS version).. Is that possible to normally install the ARM binary tarball provided on NodeJS website?\nOn Jun 14, 2018 12:44 AM, Dan Jones notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI tried nvm, and it doesn't work on Termux because nvm doesn't work if PREFIX is set. It shows an error saying it doesn't work if PREFIX is set.\nI tried to get around it by doing the following:\nPREFIX= nvm use --delete-prefix stable\nThis let it use the proper version, and npm and npx both worked, but node failed. I suspect node and npm have some conflict with the PREFIX and the way nvm sets it.\nThere's more info at creationix/nvm#1645 (comment)\nBut, I am able to use the version from the regular repos. Just pkg install node, and it works fine. Unfortunately, it's only 9.11.1, instead of the most recent version.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.. @lars18th \nThe communication will be done using the same technique used in Termux:API:\nhttps://github.com/termux/termux-api\nSee \"How API calls are made through the termux-api helper binary\" (that is using two sockets as PIPEs, one for STDIN and one for STDOUT).\n\nThe socket would not allow file access. The executables (all programms in Termux) are in the private directory of the main Termux App. Another App would be unable to access it. It would be only possible to outsource calling builtin Android system binaries with root permissions using a helper or to copy a few files into the other App for executing (but you can't automatically predict which files are needed and copying all would be a bit slow + applying changes from the Sudo App back to the main Termux App is complicated).\nHowever, a good solution would be a confirmation dialog with the executed command shown by the Sudo Helper App. That would be safe because it happens in the other app.. Wouldn't it be better to include one default font directly in the main Termux App instead of using one provided by the system?. Eventually related to https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/642. @mueller-ma As this is resolved, could you close this issue please?. @mueller-ma \n\nI cannot see any fastlane files in this repo, so this is still open.\n\nThat's a good description for the issue. But Description in fdroid outdated is not good. Please rename it to e.g. Add metadata for F-Droid (or create a new issue and close this one if that's not possible).. @Root-voidX Is it like https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/126 (caused by the word prediction feature of Samsung virtual keyboard)?. Some binaries are portable across UNIX Systems by nature. Such as BusyBox, Toy box, and many packaged as tar.gz ....\nWhat about creating a fake root system yourself using a shell script, with essential libraries & then implementing dpkg? \nI think it is a decent hack to get the thing done..\nOr if you want to install some specific package, you may check out Debian Noroot on Google Play. Seems like there is a similar app on F-droid too... @DMSalesman Kernel: custom. Is it the Kernel of the official Lineage OS build for your device or something different?. Btw I'm using oreo 8.1 custom rom if that matters.

Which Android are you using (Samsung Android, Lineage OS, ...)? Can you access the USB disk with Amaze (a preinstalled file manager can have higher permissions than external Apps)?. @calbee633810 I'm not sure if that would be the best solution. But it would be possible to add the help as a extra task/ as an separate item to the recents screen (to continue reading the help). This would solve https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/668 too.. @AVS9G You can use the arrow keys (if you e.g. https://f-droid.org/packages/org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard/) or you use the combination of letters and the volume key: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Touch_Keyboard (\nVolume Up+W \u2192 Up arrow key\nVolume Up+A \u2192 Left arrow key\nVolume Up+S \u2192 Down arrow key\nVolume Up+D \u2192 Right arrow key\n). You can use previously entered commands by using arrow up and down.. I have no idea why I didn't think of doing that. Thanks, that worked!.

Grimler91 yes, i do have clang installed. @rubikitch You could use Android Studio. Or is there a special reason why you have to use apktool?. Eventually it would be a nice feature to allow setting Termux as home app (extra Activity with matching Intent Filter which is disabled by default but can be enabled from the command line).. @fat-tire I could think of a extra git repository which contains downloadable fonts. This would not need an API key. But it would limit the font selection. The additional storage use is to my mind no problem (if one wants a font, one has to afford a few MB storage).. @xTpx Does this happen only in Termux or in other Apps (e.g. Browser) too?. @dot-gov Official Lineage OS? Which device?. @JanHelbling You would \"donate\" to Google when you use an In App Purchase. Google takes 30 percent of it (additionally to the taxes). Are you sure that this feature would be an good idea?. I personally hate such Donate-Apps. I will create a Pull Request for an In-App-Purchase.. This would be only easily possible with a library like https://github.com/serso/android-checkout, but this project uses (nearly) no libraries.\n@fornwall Would you accept a pull request for that which uses such a library?. @joakim-noah Can you give any details? (phone model, app version, app source (google play, f-droid), android version). How can it be reproduced (how much output must be there to make this occur, which commands do you use to trigger it)?. Eventually it is possible to detect if the Terminal is in an unwanted state and reset it then automatically after every command, e.g. with https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it/blob/master/lib/preexec.bash and settings a precmd function which does that.. This is a duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/365. @AndriusWild Is this a duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/126 (issues with Samsungs Keyboard \"predictive text\" feature)? (Please close this issue if it is). It looks like all recent Pull Requests (https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/712, https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/714 and https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/715) fail due to that.. This closes https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/140. #717 \nFixes this importing twice is not a good idea!. It's not imported twice anymore.. @abyss10 Duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/716?. It's more easy way to solve the problem!\nYes it does same work!. @abyss10 It's not more easy. It's exactly the same (but without the google()-shortcut).. @fornwall, any input here? Happy to submit pr if folks are open to this change.... @trygveaa, I'm aware, i read the docs.  This PR suggests a change to improve consistency.  Cause right now how vol up/down are handled is both inconsistent and inconvenient.\nVol down as ctl, vol up as alt / meta makes a ton of sense and would make readline much easier to work with on termux. Some wouldn't have to change (the ones w/o critical readline role).  \nVolume can go away in my opinion.  When I'm using vol shortcuts seeing  volume pop up every time I try to page up is confusing.  I think that's an anti-feature that should go away and make clear that user should control volume when a diff app is focused.\nTo simplify proposal and minimize conflicting keys I would like to distill this:\n  * remove vol control shortcut and make VolUp-V be alt-V\n  * add any readline shortcuts with alt/meta that don't already have a volume up assignment\nAlt-D would be great for delete following word but I see that that would mess with all the arrow key mappings.  I think readline is more critical than arrow keys since they have control character equivalents, but VolUp-v is most important to me\nI didn't know about Vol-1, etc for fn keys, and that is certainly useful and not something I'd want to see change. tsu -a\nbash: /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/tsu: /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/sh: bad interpreter: Permission denied\nStill getting the same error. solved.

It can be enabled with VolumeUp+Q or long pressing the keyboard button in the left drawer menu. \nI am leaving this open, because it doesn't have Arrow Keys yet, which seems quite important for OP.\n. @benjaminoakes Just as an FYI, there is a lot of discussion about this in Issue https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/56\n. @terba all my Music lives in ~/storage/external/ (termux-setup-storage) which is a directory on the sdcard in /storage/[sdcard_name]/Android/data/com.termux/files. Music players do have access to this directory, so I just use it like that. But if you want you can move it with Amaze to the external sd-card root. This way you can do it in one part, because it writes directly to the sd. \n. I am using Poweramp, which seems to work. But I have seen other apps completely ignore the Android folder, even if explicitly set. I still haven't found a Gallery app that let's me choose the termux folder. \n. I reopened this issue at https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/232\n. I like it, but then it should probably be an optional configuration. A first time user would probably be confused and it might be annoying for people who don't use programs with mouse dragging. \n. I don't think that was the old behavior. Termux sends the tab as mouse event to the terminal. This allows you to move the cursor in vim or switch tabs in tmux with taps on the screen. You can still hide the keyboard from the left drawer menu. \n. @Almtesh If the user adds exit to the .bashrc the return code will be 0. This leaves no way to fix the termux environment short of reinstalling the app or clearing the app data. \n@fornwall I've been thinking of ways to solve this:\n- Exit without user input if /sdcard/.termux_auto_close exists. This way users that really require this feature can create that file. If the user breaks his environment the file can be removed with an external file manager, since it's not in $HOME. \n- Have an additional app that has a simple option switch for this. \n- Have an additional switch in the notification to enable and disable automatic closing. Have it linger for a few seconds after the last terminal exited, which would allow the user to disable auto-closing if he has a broken environment. \n. @Almtesh I like the current way of configuration  a lot. A settings screen would only really work in this instance as an external app, since you want termux to exit when the last session exits. This would also leave you with no way of accessing the settings screen if your session always exits immediately. If the notification switch from my last example would just write into that file, all the settings could still be edited via the file, making it easier to synchronize or kickstart termux environment, because you can just symlink or copy the settings file to the directory and all the settings are set. \n. @benjaminoakes The problem with your suggestion is that it could still cause a users environment to break. Normally when you have a broken environment you can still open a no-dotfiles sh session by long pressing the \"New Session\" in the left drawer and tapping \"Failsafe\". \nAs per your suggestion, if a User has the following two lines somewhere in hist .profile/.bashrc/.zshrc it would break his environment. \nTERMUX_AUTO_CLOSE=1\nexit\nThis would be leaving him unable to open a new session (because it closes straight away) and unable to launch a failsafe session (because the main termux app closes straight away). There is now no way to access the files in the $HOME directory with the only solution being clearing the App Data which could cause a user to loose valuable data.\nBut I do like your suggestion because it can be set on-demand. There just needs to be some kind of practical failsave and foolproof mechanism to fix a broken environment.\n. I am reopening this issue because it has the most discussion and ideas about the Process completed message. \n@Almtesh In case you closed the issue to stop receiving emails about it, you can click the Unsubscribe button on the right.\n. @voidzero If the problem file is in the termux home driectory (something like .bash_profile) then you can not edit it without termux working, since only termux is allowed to access the termux home directory (without root). So a (unrooted) user can not edit the file that broke it. Keeping termux open allows such a user to access a failsafe session (longtap on new session), which starts sh without processing any user environment. \n. Could this be a Play Store Issue? Can you install from F-Droid? https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=termux\n. This has been fixed a few minutes ago.\n https://github.com/termux/termux-api/issues/12\nThe 93% Problem was something that happened a few weeks ago. https://plus.google.com/+RashidDavid/posts/3R4P1qsWRoW\nYou need to manually update apt. \nFor arm cpu(likely):\nwget http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-arm/apt_1.2.6_arm.deb\ndpkg -i apt_1.2.6_arm.deb\nfor intel\nwget http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-i686/apt_1.2.6_i686.deb\ndpkg -i apt_1.2.6_i686.deb\ufeff\nThen you can run apt update && apt upgrade to update the termux-api.\n. > The most important is the prediction engine\nBut in Termux, the prediction engine doesn't run anyway, unless you use the Text Input View.\n . I am on Android 5 and I can write to /storage/usbdisk without getting a \"permission denied\" error. Can you write to the usbdisk with other apps? \n. @fornwall Is there anything that can be done here?\n. You're using a very old version of apt. I think you have the same issue as https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/64. Can you try manually updating apt and liblzma with \nwget http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-arm/liblzma-5.2.2_arm.deb\ndpkg -i liblzma-5.2.2_arm.deb\nwget http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-arm/apt_1.2.6_arm.deb\ndpkg -i apt_1.2.6_arm.deb\nafter that you should be able to run apt update && apt upgrade again. \nEdit: changed to apt version 1.2.6 because 1.2.4 isn't in the repository anymore\n. ping is normally part of termux-tools (which just executes /system/bin/ping). Is that package installed? \n. Does $PREFIX/bin/ping exist? \nIf you launch sh so no user configuration is made can you then use ping?\nCan you do /system/bin/ping localhost?\n. I think you need to update termux-tools. Prior to Termux version 0.31 /system/bin/ was in the $PATH variable. It has then be removed and important system tools like ping have been added to termux-tools (as a short script, which just launches /system/bin/ping). Can you try apt update && apt upgrade once #73 has been resolved for you?\n. The suggested packages are packages suggested by people to be included in the termux packages and are not available yet. If you want to know what packages are available you can run apt list, and if you need more information about a package you can run apt show <package>.\n. This was added in version 0.35 recently. It can be enabled by long pressing on the keyboard button in the left drawer and swiping the extra keys row that appeared. \n. Yes. You can set up mutt. It's not quite easy to set up mutt with gmail. So you'll probably need to follow some tutorial like this. \n. Normally on Linux Grive2 would be used to sync a local folder with Google Drive. https://github.com/vitalif/grive2. Maybe it could be added to Termux. Would that suit your needs?\n. I am closing this Issue since pycrypto and therefore ansible can be installed with  \nexport CONFIG_SHELL=$PREFIX/bin/sh \npip install pycrypto\n. @ShyPixie See this issue: https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/283\n. I can reproduce this on my Xperia Z Tablet running the stock  firmware. \n. @danalgen You're running the coreutils version of cp because you installed it sometimes with apt install coreutils. OP is probably running the busybox version of cp, which is a lightweight version, that comes pre-installed with termux (which according to the help should still support -i). \n@Emil-7 Thanks for reporting this issue. If you just need it fixed fast, you an install coreutils with apt install coreutils, which has a more complete version of cp. \n. I don't think this is even possible with a terminal. The scrollback of a terminal isn't just a very high window that you scroll up and down on. But if you want pixel scrolling you'd need exactly that. Width and Height of a Terminal are very important to various fullscreen applications like vim and weechat and are set in $COLUMNS and $LINES. How would it deal with that? Do you know of any terminal emulator which has this feature?\n. This has now started to occasionally occur occasionally on my server termux (which houses my IRC client and an IRC bot) as well. This device didn't do anything special. No foldersync, no jekyll. \nSadly, I had to switch back to using an Ubuntu box as server for now. Termux was perfect for the job as small, personal, home server due to low energy use and no noise emission. \nI have now observed this on 3 devices:\nSony Xperia Z\nSony Xperia Z3c\nSony Xperia X\n(Coincidentally, have no non Sony Device at the moment)\nThe Xperia Z is still running Android 5, which is weird, because the problem has only started happening on my Z3C after the marshmallow upgrade.\n. I have some interesting new observations about this: It has been happening  exactly the same time these past 4 days. It's always at 09:10 exactly. For 4 days now termux has closed at 09:10. Since it's connected to my PC I notice pretty quickly. My Phone is doing nothing special at this time. I am not using foldersync anymore. It's just plugged into my PC. So either this is caused by something that runs at the same time every day or is caused exactly 24 hours after Termux starts. This Problem is so weird and elusive. \n. I haven't had this issue in a long time. I think it is just a simple Memory problem. I no longer use any syncing apps (doing it in termux now) and it doesn't really happen anymore.\nBut I have some sort of test case here: \nIf I run this (ridiculous) command (which calculates PI to scale places)\necho \"scale=2147483647; 4*a(1)\" | bc -l\none of three things happens after about 10 seconds\n1. The process gets killed after it kills all other Android processes (including the software keyboard)\n2. The session gets killed, leading to the 0 terminal sessions state\n3. Termux gets killed\n#3 happens mostly when Termux is in the background (like running the command over ssh).\nI think my original problem was simple the Memory usage of FolderSync killing Termux. But is there anything that can be done that would result in high Memory usage commands like the above one (or an intensive Jekyll build) to always lead to state #1, killing the runaway process but not all of Termux? It's quite annoying if it kills a tmux session or crond (leading to me not receiving any emails). \nIf nothing can be done about #3 can #2 at least be solved. Termux should exit if it looses all sessions.\nI have a Tasker profile that monitors the Termux Background Service and launches Termux if it detects Termux to be not running. So if #3 happens, Termux gets automatically restarted (relaunching my crond and continuing syncing and notifying me about emails)\n. Hi, it appears to be an issue for some devices. We're already tracking this issue at #109, therefore I am closing this. You can subscribe to #109 to get notified of changes. \n. Yeah, I figured it must be something like that. I hope all these weird problems I've been having with my new phone get resolved in a system upgrade. \n. I now have a better test case for this. /quit-ing weechat, with the weechat-python-plugin enabled will cause a system reboot. This only started happening as of Version 1.6 of weechat. \nHere's the last few lines of the logcat\n10-10 08:07:07.756 10149 10149 D AndroidRuntime: >>>>>> START com.android.internal.os.RuntimeInit uid 10232 <<<<<<\n10-10 08:07:07.759 10149 10149 D AndroidRuntime: CheckJNI is OFF\n10-10 08:07:07.761 10149 10149 W art     : Failed to find oatdata symbol at expected address: oatdata=0x7f814af000 != expected=0x71a40000, /data/dalvik-cache/arm64/system@framework@boot.oat.

Just checking in. This still happens with Python 3.6.0. I can reproduce this fairly consistently. Is there anything I can do that would give you insight as to what the problem is?. With the current version of weechat this also happens without weechat-python-plugin. . Just checking in: The problem still happens in Android 7.1.1.. This is still an issue for me. It happens with weechat without any weechat-*-plugin. It happens every time. \nI've made another interessting observation. \nWhen I SIGKILL weechat it doesn't reboot. but it will instantly reboot if I then start weechat again (tested multiple times).. @sdrausty For me it happens with weechat without any plugins now. . Switched to LineageOS 14.1 (from Stock Sony Rom) and it is still happening. .

By the way, I just had a very similar crash occurring with irssi. I find it very suspicious that all 3 programs that can crash my phone are IRC clients (sopel, weechat, irssi).. Alright I can also cause my phone to reboot if I use telnet to connect to an irc server and then quitting telnet again. It must be something in the IRC protocol. Maybe something the server sends me?_. @Auxilus I just tried that. I used proxychains to route the traffic through a proxy to capture the packets, but when the traffic goes through an SSH tunnel it doesn't seem to cause a reboot. It must be something very low level in the system. Probably in some network driver (since these would be the same in both LineageOS and stock Rom. I'll try again later, when I am in a network where I can more easily capture my packets. . @Auxilus Curiously I can not reproduce the telnet reboot under testing conditions. I will try again some other time. When letting weechat reboot the phone I don't see any traffic at the time of reboot (when issuing /quit). So it does look like it crashes even before sending the QUIT commands. Weird. . [Termux:Float](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux.window) does this. Does this fit your need?\n. I realized that this already happens when fullscreen mode is enabled. Is there a reason it doesn't hide in the non-fullscreen mode?\n. [The link](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/DocumentsProvider.html#queryChildDocuments%28java.lang.String, java.lang.String[], java.lang.String%29)\n. Does it even need an API method? Couldn't the install process of Termux simply put the version number into a plain text file somewhere in /data/data/com.termux where the bash script could read it?\n. I created a shell script at [termux-info](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/422) that would provide the information.pm list packages -i | grep com.termux` is perfect, as it also provides the information about installed Add-Ons.\nEverything except version number should work. The version number function assumes a plaintext file at $PREFIX/version, but it can easily be replaced with an API command, if you should choose to go that route instead.\nThis bash script could be provided via the apt repository via the termux-tools package\nBecause any version number function would not work below version 0.40 it will just show <0.40 (assuming it's in the next version).\nHere's a sample output:\n$ termux-info\nTermux version:\n<0.40\nInstalled Termux apps:\npackage:com.termux.api  installer=com.android.vending\npackage:com.termux.styling  installer=com.android.vending\npackage:com.termux.widget  installer=com.android.vending\npackage:com.termux.window  installer=com.android.vending\npackage:com.termux  installer=com.android.vending\nUpdatable packages:\nAll packages up to date\nSystem information:\nLinux localhost 3.10.84-perf-gfc8e9bb #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu May 5 20:48:38 2016 aarch64 Android\n. There is termux-file-editor, which was added at the same time as termux-url-opener\nFrom changelog:\n\nTermux can now receive files shared from other apps. Files are saved into ~/downloads/ and it\u2019s possible to open this folder or editing a file directly when receiving it. Editing is done through a ~/bin/termux-file-editor program which will be called with the newly received file as only argument.\n\nIs this what you're looking for?\n. 1. Can you check the permissions of the termux app in the app settings (Android Settings -> Apps -> Termux -> Permissions) and see if storage permission is granted or not. If not already granted, flick the switch.\n2. While in the App Settings, press Force Stop, to completely kill Termux. Then restart it and try again. \n3. If it still doesn't work, can you check if you can access /storage/emulated/0 (cd /storage/emulated/0 directly, as you normally can't access /storage/emulated). /sdcard is usually just a symlink to /storage/emulated/0, where the drive is mounted. /sdcard may not exist on some devices. \n. Normally termux-setup-storage should open a popup permission granting window. That didn't appear to you? Were you using ssh or telnet to issue the commands?\n. @bitcoinmeetups You can follow this short tutorial https://oliverse.ch/tech/2016/04/03/pass-variables-from-termux-to-tasker.html. \nIt doesn't actually require Termux at all to do that. \nBut you can also connect to Termux via ADB if you start an ssh-server and setup a port forwarding. Are float apps the same as multi-window? \nPossible duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/29 \n. You need to run termux-fix-shebang configure to fix the shebang. \nSidenote. vim-python is available as a package you can install with apt install vim-python\n. Vim requires a few patches to run on Termux. It's probably not that easy to compile it on Termux. It might be easier to cross-compile using the existing package sources here (https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/tree/master/packages/vim and https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/tree/master/packages/vim-python) and add support for Lua and Python2 there. \n. What is the output of dpkg --print-architecture?. I tested it on my Xperia X (Android 6.0.1, aarch64) and it seems to work as well. . Can confirm, compiling on Ubuntu and running on Termux produces this error. \n2016/12/08 12:37:22 oops: Get https://google.com: dial tcp: lookup google.com on [::1]:53: read udp [::1]:58085->[::1]:53: read: connection refused. Is there a reason you don't install golang from the repository?\napt install golang. Are you sure you're using the Text input view? https://termux.com/touch-keyboard.html#extra-keys-view. Gesture typing requires a text input field that is able to communicate back to the keyboard application, so that the keyboard knows what has already been typed. As far as I am aware this would be impossible to implement into a terminal emulator.. You can already open more than one terminal by opening the navigation drawer (swiping from the left) and tap on \"NEW SESSION\". Does that work for you?. Closing this, because the original issue is resolved\n@trufae @grepper You can subscribe to the issue about switching terminals by swiping here: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/48. You can do this with Termux:Widget for apps that can handle shortcuts and you can do it with Termux:Task for Tasker (and Tasker plugin compatible software). But you can only launch scripts in a specific folder. This is for security reasons, as otherwise a rogue app could launch arbitrary Tasker commands (and for example, steal your ssh and gnupg keys). You can configure that: https://termux.com/configuration.html#handling-the-back-key. https://termux.com/touch-keyboard.html\nhttps://termux.com/touch-keyboard.html#extra-keys-view. I'm not sure we need to remap these, there is already the extra keys view that shows a CTRL key on the screen, which even has visual feedback, which the back key can't do. So if we could just have an option to disable the volume key capturing (like I requested in https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/119) you could have your navigation keys back and I could have my standard volume keys back. . @fornwall I think this is a really good idea and would solve this (and #117) nicely. . @roccomuso That sounds like a different problem. You probably have an error in your ~/.bash_login file (or another startup file that you may have tinkered with). Try starting a failsafe session by long pressing the \"New Session\" Button from the left drawer. From this session you have basic access to termux. Try to identify the problem with your startup. Maybe try deleting your ~/.bash_login (or other startup files). . This would also make https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/pull/422 completable.. Yes, I like the os-release file idea. If it's just a file we don't need to clutter the environment with unnecessary variables. . Yes. See https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/6 for more information.. Try running apt update. Screen should be available since a few weeks ago.\n. Have you tried opening the left drawer and tapping on \"keyboard\"?\n. @Matvei27 There's usually a setting for that in the keyboards settings. . Did you do something weird with your path. What is the output of echo $PATH?. The problem seems to be that you have /system/bin in your path, so you're using the wrong ssh-keygen. \nTry resetting your path to the default in termux. . > *mismatch\nLeave it like that. Hash sum mustaches is so much better. \ud83d\ude04 \nThis is a recurring problem with Cloudflare. @fornwall usually does some cache purging or something to make it go away. Maybe it even fixes itself after a while. Just wait a day or so and it should be fixed. \nThis is a problem with the network infrastructure of http://termux.net, nothing you can do. Even reinstalling won't help. . > After running an update though\nWhat did you update? Termux? Android?\n\nbrowsing a webpage\n\nCan you check this from Termux? E.g. curl http://111.111.111.111/. > curl http://111.111.111.111/\nSorry if it wasn't clear enough. I meant use curl to browse whatever the IP address is that you're trying to reach \n\nbrowsing a webpage hosted on the same IP (but on a different server).\n. Hmm... What is the output of ssh [IP] -v?. What you want to do you can do with the Termux Api. \ntermux-telephony-call 0123456789. @Monsieur-Moony It's not Termux, it's SELinux. Here's how you can fix your files: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/FAQ#I_updated_termux_packages_as_root_and_now_I.27m_getting_.27permission_denied.27_as_a_non-root_user.. @Monsieur-Moony Ha! that's cool. :D . > Can you please show me a successful major project where the help inside the app is hosted on a wiki?\n\nBoth Archlinux and LineageOS only have a wiki as their primary documentation. . > Imho wiki.termux.com should be hosted at http://pages.github.com\nThat's exactly what the help pages were. There were almost no contributions made for years.. > Are the man and info pages for these OSes on a wiki too?\nThe man and info pages for Termux are also not on a wiki. . Duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/1192, which previously only applied to nodejs-current but now also applies to nodejs. I believe there is a fix ready here: https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/pull/1701. Duplicate of #119. . Duplicate of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/490#issuecomment-346769130. Sorry, Duplcate of https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/129. I eliminated my config file line by line and found the line that causes this.\nMinimal settings\n~/.config/nvim/init.vim\nhi StatusLine ctermfg=15 ctermbg=8 cterm=NONE\n(setting it with :hi ... won't cause the problem)\nI experienced this in Termux App, and connected via ssh with st and mintty, both inside and outside of Termux, so I am not sure it's a Terminal Emulator problem.\nOh and you need to open a large file and start scrolling for the problem to occur. . Thanks\n\n@Neo-Oli Let's switch to released versions starting with 0.2.3 when that is final!\n\nThat's great. . @Basti922 That page has a new link. https://glow.li/technology/2015/11/06/run-an-ssh-server-on-your-android-with-termux/\nSorry about that. . What keyboard app are you using?\n. Can you please delete it and install it again. And post the output of the installation script. There might be errors in there.\n. Well then the first time there was probably a network error or something like that. The second error (can be tracked here: https://github.com/Neo-Oli/termux-ubuntu/issues/2) is normal for now. You can still use Ubuntu like this. . @zMaurizio00 Excerpt from the proot manual:\n\n-k string, --kernel-release=string\n        Make current kernel appear as kernel release string.\n        If a program is run on a kernel older than the one expected by its\n        GNU C library, the following error is reported: \"FATAL: kernel too\n        old\".  To be able to run such programs, PRoot can emulate some of\n        the features that are available in the kernel release specified by\n        string but that are missing in the current kernel.\n\nSo I'd suggest trying to play with that. \n(Porting a linux kernel to an android phone is really hard. So custom roms generally don't bother and just use whatever kernel the manufacturer supplies and build the rom ontop of it. So old phones will have old kernels, even if they run the same version of the rom)\n. The problem with your PS1 happens on my Debian as well, so it's not Termux specific. Try asking in a bash support forum.. Run unset LD_PRELOAD before running proot to clear /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/libtermux-exec.so which isn't available in whatever your proot jail is.\n. Well does /bin/bash exist in the container?. Ah, now you don't get the \"No such file...\" error anymore? \nterminated with signal 11\nProbably means you're trying to run a binary that doesn't match your phone's architecture.\n. @Deathlive https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Touch_Keyboard#Extra_Keys_Row. @Deathlive This Pull request hasn't been merged yet, so it isn't available.. > How will I use vi without insert? :/\ni. @mansurabbas So you removed apt (because it depends on termux-exec)? Apt screams bloody murder when you're trying to remove it. You had to type \"Yes, do as I say!\" or something and you still did it? Why?!\nWell, now you don't have a package manager. Your best bet is to download apt and termux-exec from http://termux.net and try to reinstall it.\nwget http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-`dpkg --print-architecture`/termux-exec_0.3_aarch64.deb\nwget http://termux.net/dists/stable/main/binary-`dpkg --print-architecture`/apt_1.4.8-2_aarch64.deb\ndpkg -i termux-exec_0.3_aarch64.deb\ndpkg -i apt_1.4.8-2_aarch64.deb\nOther solutions:\nCompletely reinstalling Termux or running rm -rf $PREFIX and restarting Termux to wipe all non-user data and reinstall everything.. rm -r storage. \nThis will remove the symlinks in your home directory. This will suffice for your use.\nIf you want to truly revert all termux-setup-storage did you'll also have to open the app settings and remove the storage permission.. You can also just run apt install python2 && pip2 install sqlmap. Duplicate of #384. I think the only thing that might be a problem is the bootstrap package. All other dowloads are user initiated. User initiated downloads have to be fine otherwise things such a s browsers wouldn't be allowed to exist, because they could also download code. Also this rule has been in place for a long time now. I remember talking about this months (years?) ago and nothing has happened. . Yeah. It would be a bit annoying but it would probably solve any issues. But I don't think we need to do anything right now. Again this has been in effect for some time. And our app isn't malicious in the slightest. But IANAL. To me it looks like Termux is fine. Especially because it doesn't execute any downloaded java code. \"This restriction does not apply to code that runs in a virtual machine and has limited access to Android APIs (such as JavaScript in a WebView or browser).\" I think what Termux does falls into this category. Programs from Termux definitely have only limited access to the Android API and basically run inside the normal jail that Android invokes. And except the bootstrap package everything is user initiated anyway to which this rule must not apply. . > Feels kinda impossible to distribute \u2248900 packages through apk\nIt's not only that. It's also package managers like pip and gem that add a myriad of available software to termux. Hell curl example.com/script.sh | bash downloads and executes code. If these rules are truly enforced upon Termux, Termux as such can't exist. And if we start to run the app in some kind of virtual machine or it would stop making sense at all as we might as well run debian or archlinux at this point. \n. Can you try if running unset LD_PRLOAD before su works? If it does maybe we can add it to the su wrapper script.\n. https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/pull/2394 should fix this.. > However, an ncurses program can't do that if it is abruptly stopped (from an unhandled segfault, a kill signal like the one I manually fired to cause this, or something similar). \nBy far the most common cause of this is an ssh connection breaking up while you run any kind of ncurses application (tmux, screen, vim etc.) on the remote machine. . Closing this, because it is normal Unix behaviour and not Termux specific. . @l-jonas Setting something like that in a preexec would be bad, because calling reset will also hide whatever error caused the terminal to get into an unwanted state. . Cool. The best place would probably be the Google Plus community http://termux.com/community. Do you mean the left drawer menu? You can open it by swiping from the left side of the screen.. It's mentioned under user-interface in the help menu. https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/User_Interface. The proper place to add this question is https://termux.com/community. . > cat sudo > /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/sudo\nWhat? What are you expecting this command to do? It doesn't make sense at all.\nAlso there is no sudo, only su.. Pressing the Exit button will only kill all sessions. It will not kill any background processes. Are you perhaps running your ssh process in a tmux session, because the tmux server survives the \"Exit\". . ",

Even though the Termux special keys dissapear after a second or so when ALT+tabbing back into the app it caused 2 screen resize events which was really annoying in fullscreen terminal apps like tmux - sometimes even, the second resize event wouldn't be honoured, leaving the screen in some weird half resized state :( Anyway, now I can ALT+tab all I want and termux will always looks exactly how I left it :)\n.

(That commit introduced Ctrl+Q, I believe.). I wish the SD card supported symlinks, too, or that Android wasn't blocking access to all but that one deep folder, but so far, I haven't seen a better solution. I have seen some problems solved that I thought were harder, though.... @geek1011, I have not, but others have (@sdrausty is one, I think.) As I understand it, it is near impossible without root.. The only options available are for viewing, AFAIK: termux-open  and on Android 7, I can open some termux files from the Downloads app. No modifications allowed that I have found so far... I tried to use this to keep some files app-private, but found them in Downloads. :P I haven't been able to edit them yet, but haven't tried very powerful apps.. @Subhash3 https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Text_Editors#Vim. @Neo-Oli, is this still an issue after the recent extra keys update?. I don't have much of a problem on my 2gb ram LG Android 7 phone, but my 1gb ram LG Android 5 phone closes apps all the time now. If I want to be sure the session doesn't end, I can't multitask much at all. Apps just take more ram, now. Having extra internal storage seems to help, possibly with some kind of virtual memory.... I do rarely have termux close abruptly on the Android 7 device when left alone for a while, not including when the app updates. It happens to other apps too, though.. That comment link doesn't seem to work for me for some reason, but it only happens very rarely for any app in particular, and sometimes may not happen at all for weeks, (unless I happen to clear it after it happens without checking the Activity.) I don't know if I'll be able to find the logcat entry without logging it all while charging, but I assume that because termux seems no more affected than other apps, it is a system thing. I just actually cleared termux from recent apps, and it restored where I left off when relaunched.. @memeplex, has this happened?. @memeplex I think this was addressed by the recent update to the Extra Keys Row.... I don't think the cursor ANSI escape sequences for blinking are supported, either, but block, | and _ are:\nprintf '\\e[2 q'\nprintf '\\e[4 q'\nprintf '\\e[6 q'. @dandv, where does external-1 point? It should be empty when first created. ls -l ~/storage\nNvm, missed your edit. You can rename the symlinks.. I was e-mailed another reply, but don't see it. To support multiple SD cards, external now has a number attached. It points to an empty directory created for Termux on the SDcard. Termux can't always access the whole SDcard. My phone lets it read the whole card, basically, via /storage/external_SD but not make any changes, except in its special folder: /storage/external_SD/Android/data/com.termux/files  which is why ~/storage/external* points there instead of to the SDcard root directory.. @Subhash3, if I understand correctly, you are trying to find the path to your SD card. My path is under /storage/, which I can open. There is also a /sdcard/, but it is linked to /storage/emulated/legacy/. @sk8793, this isn't SDcard related, is your phone rooted? Try ls -l to find the permissions of each folder.. It sounds like you want to use adb or root.... I also experience this.\nProbably a separate issue, but it's also hard to select text on the first few lines, depending on the zoom, because the selection bar gets in the way. I can't tell what is selected or change that until I copy.. Could this be the cause of these pubkey errors? I updated apt and others successfully,  then went to install a new package, and got these.\n```\nWelcome to Termux!\nWiki:            https://wiki.termux.com\nCommunity forum: https://termux.com/community\nIRC channel:     #termux on freenode\nGitter chat:     https://gitter.im/termux/termux\nMailing list:    termux+subscribe@groups.io\nSearch packages:   pkg search \nInstall a package: pkg install \nUpgrade packages:  pkg upgrade\nLearn more:        pkg help\n0|localhost/1:~$ pkg up\nHit:1 https://termux.net stable InRelease\nHit:2 https://its-pointless.github.io/files termux InRelease\nGet:3 https://xeffyr.github.io/termux-x-repository termux InRelease [2040 B]\nErr:2 https://its-pointless.github.io/files termux InRelease\n  The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 906F5AFA9A32C72D\nErr:3 https://xeffyr.github.io/termux-x-repository termux InRelease\n  The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 45F2964132545795\nFetched 2040 B in 2s (1000 B/s)\nReading package lists...

They still work, too. I guess it uses a common key file that is overwritten.. I haven't installed an sdcard (internal or external) in my Android 5.1 device, so I don't have experience with this problem, yet, but\n$ termux-setup-storage help\nsays it sets up \"$HOME/.storage\". I don't know if it affects \"/storage\". I have \"$HOME/storage\" without running it manually, but maybe it or something similar was run automatically on install?. Thanks. I have an internal sdcard, now, but termux-setup-storage didn't make the folder or symlink. When I made them manually, it worked. I created a test file inside. Termux can read most of the rest of the card, just not change it.\nOne catch: I had to use File Manager to make the folder. Termux didn't have permission to create the folder in /storage/external_SD/Android/data. \"reset\" is the command to basically clear the screen. I'm not familiar with a parameter, and mine doesn't support one. Perhaps you've changed $TERM?\nhttp://techtitbits.com/2010/10/resolving-unknown-unknown-terminal-type-error/\nMy $TERM is set to \"xterm-256color\" in case that helps.\nWhen I get stuck, rebooting the phone has always gotten me out, but you can accidentally mess up files in storage and you can mess up things enough that you need to reinstall the app.. espeak currently doesn't work on arm Lollipop 5.1.1 (termux/termux-packages#1680). espeak currently doesn't work on arm Lollipop 5.1.1 (termux/termux-packages#1680), but a typical linux solution may be an alternative (as in https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-accessibility/software,) except for the termux menus and such..

I use an app for this purpose, but I don't know how it works: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tomlocksapps.bluetoothtetheringmanager\nI don't know if it is possible to somehow control it from termux.... There are terminal emulators for older versions, such as TermIDE, (which is one I've used, before. It doesn't support Android 5.0+. :p Some things changed between the versions that seem to make it difficult to support them all and still be powerful.). Are you using SSH or telnet? If so, termux/termux-packages#491 or termux/termux-packages#1193 may be related.. To be able to create or modify files, you need the w switch: tcpsvd -vE 0.0.0.0 8024 ftpd -w /sdcard\n. I think many users would prefer to leave that permission in termux-api to keep the number of permissions the main app uses to a minimum. Microphone is one people question more.. There are Termux add-ons for specific cases (see #236). #12 is still open. Maybe you should subscribe there. @v0idst4r . I use it to fix aborted downloads by other downloaders. Just copy the partial file to a termux r/w location, and use either wget's -c option or curl's -C or --continue-at option.\n(It would be handy to have termux-url-downloader or something, though I have a browser in termux-url-opener.)\n. I expect you meant sshd -d, to log debug info. I recently set up ssh over USB, and had this problem. I would check firewalls and routers to make sure the port is allowed, ping termux, try omitting the user@ (just the bare ip, as that's how I use another port of ssh, though it shouldn't matter) and also note that only the first connection is allowed when using sshd's -d switch, and others will be refused.\nrecently set up ssh for USB, but I used to use Wi-fi. In both clientermux runs sshd. I've used several clients, and had trouble setting up each. I haven't tried cygwin, yet, but I plan to set up cygwin64 client. In general, make sure the Public key is in .ssh/authenticated_keys, and the user part may or may not be needed, depending on the client. (I don't use it in git's msys on Windows, just the ip and port, as it knows my keys.) Other clients require it, or add their own, such as anonymous.. I don't know if this will help, but I found it helpful to go over: https://glow.li/tech/2015/11/06/run-an-ssh-server-on-your-android-with-termux.html\nSorry my previous post wasn't quite done, but I think I'll leave it.... Now that ssh is working, you could change the key through it or sftp, if you like. I would use the authorized_keys2 file as a backup, and delete it after verifying the change works.. Did you see #205? Unless there is a way to allow native executables to access the SDcard, will a Java solution be useful? (Correct me if I am wrong, but this seems like a solution for Java.). I had to create the symlink manually. (ln -s ...) If that doesn't work, I'm afraid I don't have a chromebook to test.. @timnolte, that appears to be for Java only. Native binary applications wouldn't be able to use it without some kind of wrapper that runs Java code, which would probably be slow... That's why we don't use the normal access framework for Android.. @timnolte, the SDcard issue has been confusing since #20. Only recently could an app be written in non-Java. (A Java wrapper was required, which could load other code, as termux does.) Very few of the commands in termux are written in Java, and these have to use the old dalvikvm, used by KitKat. The package sources can be found by following the packages repo.\nOn my phone, /sdcard points to internal storage, so idk why it has that name except for historical reasons.\n  . It worked for you? It never changed anything on my LG Lollipop 5.1.1 arm device. I was interested in the feature at one point, but decided that stuff comes in useful when the unexpected happens.. Toggling the keyboard and extra keys never worked for me, but I wouldn't be opposed to its reintroduction as a beta feature or something.. termux can basically only chmod files in the home or usr directories, not shared internal storage, (under /sdcard, or ~/storage, etc.)\nAs for the original issue, I prefer keeping permissions in termux-api, for the most part.. @ekant7: Sounds like a shebang issue. How did you install metasploit? Using termux-fix-shebang command or the termux-exec package might help... You should probably start a new thread or ask on gitter or Google+ for better help.. @ekant7, aarch64 refers to physical hardware built into the phone. To get it, you need to buy one of those phones. Do you have problems asking further questions at the places linked above?. Some other systems have the same problem. There are sometimes ways around this, such as in nodejs code, making a file that includes the target. If the file is static, and not too large, it is often simply copied.. @blowUA : This resembles #514. Is your phone rooted? Have you changed environment variables?\n(A failsafe session may be started by long-pressing the New Session button in the side tray [swipe from left side] and choosing the failsafe option. This lets you navigate to files to fix them or make copies in case you need to reinstall.). Wow, my device is black, so I never noticed. How much padding do you think is necessary? I value screen space, but black isn't the only device color... I wonder if it could be made a setting.. I have a curved screen. I don't see a border, but it may be hard to tell, since it's all black.\nI found padding on a couple other phones, even though they were black too. . Duplicate of #507 . That's right. The -a option won't get the file attributes; but few of these attributes can be set without error outside of termux space, anyway.\nTo ignore the errors means to not alter the command, let them come, and then filter them out, which could be done through a pipe, I suppose, if you really don't want to see them. I just filter in my head, because I like the reminder that the time and attributes will be different.. It happens to me too, but I thought it was actually closing, like after pressing exit. (The tab stays in recent apps, and it opens a new session when chosen.) Sometimes I can keep a session going for days, other times it loses the session when the timer rings or some other simple thing happens.\nIt's especially annoying if it happens during an ssh session. (termux/termux-packages#1865). Hmm, can you scroll it to the proper position? Does changing orientation to landscape and back help any? Does restarting the device help any? What does uname -a output?. These are apparently the build settings, for reference from https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/blob/master/packages/busybox/busybox.config:\n`````\nCONFIG_PS=y\nCONFIG_FEATURE_PS_WIDE is not set\nCONFIG_FEATURE_PS_LONG is not set\nCONFIG_FEATURE_PS_TIME=y\nCONFIG_FEATURE_PS_ADDITIONAL_COLUMNS=y\nCONFIG_FEATURE_PS_UNUSUAL_SYSTEMS is not set\n`````. If termux commands don't fix it, you can then try restorecon (see #335)\nA check in apt or pkg would be good, maybe with a switch to override. (I think someone posted they purposely used apt as root, but I don't remember why.). I don't think they are currently merging translations.. You've tried ssh -i path\\to\\file.pem aws.hostname with parameters replaced as appropriate? Ideally, I think the file should be in ~/.ssh with the other ssh keys. I don't know if chmod 400 is necessary, but it wouldn't hurt.. It's probably related to am. Try installing or updating the termux-am package. See ~termux/termux-packages#2104~ termux/termux-packages#1578 and termux/termux-packages#2090. termux-elf-cleaner can fix these errors: https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/blob/master/README.md#android-dynamic-linker. If the characters are not all the same size, some displays that depend on this will look bad.. I had to create the sdcard folder and symlink manually. The actual path depends on which system you have. For me, it was /storage/external_SD/Android/data/com.termux/files. I just tried moving ~/storage to ~/storagebak and rerunning termux-setup-storage, and it worked. I'll merge the folders.. @mbrick02, I think you were right, if run without a working SD card, you might need to remove ~/storage and run termux-setup-storage again.. Glad to share the solution!

I think this may be why I have trouble controlling the wakelock over ssh after a while. I'll try to do some testing when I have time..

Having a backlog ATM.\nWithout checking the current situation, #572 gives the issue at the time I wrote this. Basically, running termux-setup-storage didn't add a symlink for a newly inserted SD card, because it had previously been run without any SD cards inserted.\nIn some ways, I actually prefer #578, but this one would also remove symlinks to removed SD cards.\nI'll try to check current status and look at formatting when I get time. It sounds like tabs were inserted instead of spaces?. You might want to look at termux/termux-packages#2066, which starts out with apt, then discusses all commands broken. If you're having trouble starting the app, look at https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Recover_a_broken_environment. See termux/termux-packages#2031. No problem, completely understandable. ;-)\nI expect someone will be along to close this shortly.. @Harshiv-Patel, the default changed. See https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Touch_Keyboard#Extra_Keys_Row for directions to customize it.. I saw someone installing a font in ~/.termux/something.ttf, I believe, but I don't know much about it.. I looked up the actual path. It requires termux-styling. The font should be named ~/.termux/font.ttf. I just symlinked tmp to the cache directory, and it's been working for me. I actually used a relative path: tmp -> ../../cache. @xeffyr Thanks, coincidentally, I had a problem running pkg up due to missing tmp files about the same time I saw your warning. Rerunning the command after reverting the symlink worked, so I think I agree that the cold start idea is better.\nI think it happened this time because an email app download thousands of emails to internal storage, reducing the free space under 500mb, so Android 5 started cleaning much more aggressively.. @kovan Did you try deleting the ~/storage folder before re-running termux-setup-storage? (See #572). You also might want to check logcat. That's where all error messages will be.. I use Ctrl+p, which is same as Volume Down+p, instead of the up arrow, just to mention another option.... pkg install x11-repo. It's actually Previous and Next.\nThose are bash key commands.. Duplicate of termux/termux-packages#2528\npkg install diffutils fixes it.. Wow! That was awful. Thanks for fixing this. I was planning to try to go over it again before it was merged, but I did test the released version several times, and actually used it on an Android 7 phone with pictures that haven't been backed up,  yet. It only deleted the symlinks, as far as I can tell. I don't know why it didn't do more than that, but hopefully some others were unaffected, as well...YIKES!. Oh, did it only happen if the main ~/storage was a symlink? Bangs head I don't think I tested for that. I had thought of putting a confirmation in the shell script, though, warning that the folder contents would be deleted. I wish I'd got that pull request in, since it could have mitigated this.. I was testing different methods of fixing it. I think it is safe to guess the number; a bad guess should only affect speed, not accuracy, for npm. If you want to try my script in https://github.com/Quasic/cpuinfo, it tries various methods of aquiring the number. Some are more reliable than others.. Zoom has been restricted to pinch-zoom to avoid problems with double-tap zooming accidentally. There is currently no way to turn it off completely.. I think it was fixed in 2.5.1-4 (termux/termux-packages#2845) then the fix was improved in 2.5.1-5 (termux/termux-packages#2859). Is this related to termux/termux-packages#3304?. Would restorecon help? See #445. Also see #341. I have the same problem since the keyboard was updated to two rows.. #1014 fixed the empty button crash. It also shows half-height buttons when changing from default to double row, until restarting the app. (Tested LG Android versions 5 & 7). I would find this more useful as a separate button, unless I could make a script to change the behavior mid-session. Still would be useful, though.. @Edontin, thanks for trying the checkbox, but go ahead and focus on the basic feature, first. It looks like it just needs to check that the path exists before using it instead of home.\nI don't want to complicate things. I do find it harder to cd home on the touchscreen keyboard, but it's not as bad as retyping or copy-pasting a path. I could always make an alias cdhome or something.... @Edontin, wow, thanks, I can't believe I overlooked that. I also use DOS, (which prints the cwd when given no parameters.) So I learned to always supply a path for better consistency.\nUse the simplest solution. I was speaking more generally. I almost edited my comment because I wasn't sure that was the exact check needed, but I figured you would know.. It might be good to try to actually cd to the /proc/.../cwd for the current session's shell pid before opening the new session. I doubt it would matter in practice, but it's good to test the edge cases.. Shift seems more complicated to add, and I don't know if keyboards are able to tell if an outside shift key is pressed by any standard means, so it will show lowercase letters when this shift is pressed for uppercase... Maybe it's not implemented for reasons like these?. There is a PR #417 to add SHIFT. ",

This only works with read write permission files, and is an experimental concept that appears to work to some extent with minimal effort.  It might not be worth the effort in the long run.  However, this method CAN save a lot of space on devices with small internal storage if it works properly.  . I tried Talkback in Android and found this feature worse than useless. If you ever integrate Talkback into Termux, I doubt that it will be useful anyway. \nA good method in Termux to get text to speech is espeak Here is a working example:\n```\ncat $PREFIX/etc/motd > t.txt && espeak -f t.txt -w t.wav && play-audio t.wav \n``\n. @GiddyBiwott no, not at present.

In the best case scenario $PREFIX and $HOME are mounted from the external micro SD card, thereby resolving those two issues, and probably this one, as well.  \nPlease see https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mount+loop+device+site%3Atldp.org specifically http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LGNET//////////109/chirico.html about how to create and then mount with loop device. Since you have root access you should be able to create a couple of large GB files on the exfat filesystem on your external micro SD card, and then mount them with the -loop option in $PREFIX and $HOME as native space on internal device from your external micro SD card in /data/data/com.termux/files/usr and /data/data/com.termux/files/home respectively.\nYou do not need root for creating and formatting filesystems within files. Please see https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/375 for specifics on using tools that are available today to accomplish these tasks in Termux as regular user. Mounting as nonroot user appears to be a stumbling point in Termux for some reason. \n\nhttp://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/archived/Loopback-Root-FS/Loopback-Root-FS-3.html https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mount+loop+device+linux and https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_device should be helpful also.

Some of these borders are wider than others, but this doesn't make any difference since it is black.  If device color should not appeal with Termux's default screen setting for the user, an addon is available. It is called Termux styling!  More information about a solution for this topic through the Termux Styling Addon is at this https://termux.com/add-on-styling.html link;  Enjoy.  . > has a black border embedded in the glass surrounding the LED screen. Some of these borders are wider than others, but this doesn't make any difference since it is black. \nHence, every screen has built in black padding which consumes no LED screenspace. . @Grimler91 @lokesh-krishna \n\nIt is quite hard to mark text all the way to the edge,\n\nIt is impossible to mark text all the way to the left edge of the screen.  Dragging the visual mode cursor one line up at the extreme right side of the screen accomplishes marking text all the way to the left border of the screen.  Adding 1px of padding will not change this text marking event whatsoever.  \n\nblack border is pretty much none-existing\n\nMany devices have a relatively large frame, even the ones that claim they do not have a picture frame so to say.  What is more, usually this picture frame comes in black, and this is because of a couple important reasons.  The thinnest padding encountered is about a couple of pixels wide frame around an LED IMOL and similar LED screen display.  \nEither way smartphones and tablets come with padding, just like computers.  Take a closer look at the command window in Windows (tm).  Does it have padding? How about a CLI window in Linux?  Is there any padding in these examples?  \n\nan option to add padding, would be nice.  \n\nPossibly, but aren't there more important things like https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/465 Convert text navigation gestures into arrow key inputs and https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/12 Add overlay keyboard with Alt, Ctrl, Tab, arrow keys (and a few more keys) to name two of many important issues.

I can see how this feature might be cumbersome as @xqdoo00o states on large tablet, and I have run into a couple of smartphone models where I must agree with you.  \nThese smartphone models have the volume button(s) at the back of the unit.  After getting used to it, it's not as bad as at first.  The bending the device's shape effect isn't too pleasant when pressure to the button is applied.  \nAs stated, on most devices volume + key is a beautiful shortcut.  Are your volume buttons at the back of the device @FuckDoctors @xqdoo00o?. @xqdoo00o thanks for your time and attention.  Volume buttons at the back of the device make the volume+key feature cumbersome, clunky to use.  \n\npressed down Volume up then press d for many times.\n\nVolume buttons at the side of the device don't need to be pressure pressed down.  They  are simply held in palm of hand along with device.  \n\nPressing a key many times while holding a device along with the volume button down at the edge of the device is not tiresome.  \nPressing a key many times while holding a device along with pressure pressing the volume button down from the back is tiresome.  \n\nAre there any ideas as to why CTRL+w doesn't work, but volume button up + w which is bound to CTRL+w does work for scrolling back through BASH history?. @zhoue792a8 for hassle free BASH PS1 in Termux:\n$ cat .bash_profile\nPS1=\"[\\A\\[\\033[0;32m\\] \\W \\[\\033[0m\\]]\\\\$ \"\nDoes everything it is supposed to in Android 6; wraps nicely too:\n```\n[10:54 ~ ]$ grep Refresh setupTermuxArch.sh\n                        read -p \"Refresh $HOME/TermuxArchBloom?

What about the configuration menu @robertvandeneynde? . @xqdoo00o the | pipe should remain on top as it is used often in shells for piping.  Otherwise it is hidden deep in the keyboard.  Would it be difficult for you to add long press popup.  \nWith the popup feature this could become one row with more keys:\n| ESC        | \\|           | \ud83d\udd3c  | PGUP |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| ---:|\n| TAB      | / | \u25c0 | HOME |\n| CTRL      | \\      |   \u25b6 | END |\n| ALT | -      |    \ud83d\udd3d |  PGDN |\nTen columns can fit in the top row.  Just like the number keys do.  The example above shows a 4x4 matrix.  Now a 10x2 matrix would yield many more keys than we have at present.

Edit your .bash_profile is the default answer.  If your \ud83d\udc1a shell isn't default, edit the appropriate dot file.  .

Potential resolution #1, try pkg up and see if this helps after finishing the update and restarting Termux.  Also a question about the shell you are using; What shell are you using?. @UniQ0 use chsh -s bash, and hopefully this issue will be resolved.  After using chsh to change the default shell, logout and log back into Termux for the changes to take affect by closing the current session and opening up a new one.. What version of the app do you have?  . It looks like you found something very important; Thank you.  Where did the apk come from @UniQ0?  Is this Termux with the funny fonts (that are not all that funny) from Google PlayStore, or F-Droid?

Maybe you can find a pretty one for your device.. What about a coreutils+proot+curl package that can be used in Terminal Emulator as an alternative?  There is a youtube video of Arch Linux in Terminal Emulator, but that method requires a cracked/rooted device.  A package that can sprout into a Linux on Android KitKat is desired by many of us.

I have Hacker's Keyboard installed, but it is really clunky to type on compared to Gboard, and I'd rather not switch to it just to get arrow keys. This really should be a high priority. . ",

    "robertvandeneynde": "\"|\" is on the \"\u2013\" one must long press then go up...\nThis should really be customizable (not everybody wants two lines, could choose the positions, etc) or at least have a small tutorial somewhere when the app is installed.\nThe extra keys are not obvious to activate either, long press on the \"Keyboard\" button in the side menu activatable with left-swiping ? Nobody would guess those two moves.. +1. Awesome !\nWhere did the \"|\" go ? I don't say it's mandatory but it was included in the keys for a reason : pipe in bash.\nFurthermore, shouldn't it be configurable in some settings ? \"No extra keys, one line, two lines... One line but these keys : 1, 2, 3...\". I don't see any configuration menu in my app, I can only long press on the screen to have a menu that has Help that is showing me the Termux wiki having a bit of tutorials like User Interface, how to use this app.\nMaybe that's kind of hidden somewhere (like the Swipe from left side of screen to center menu) which by the way is not a good advantage of having hidden menus. Even the \"extra keys\" is hidden (long press on a button in a hidden menu ?).\nOn the other side, configuration is great if it's easy to find how to do it, but having good defaults is important too.. The :wrench: symbols would mean custom symbol in here, that's an idea indeed. An another idea would be to insert characters via a configuration menu somewhere, insert of replacing it.\nBut what were you talking about with your comment What about the configuration menu ?\nBut if we were to talk about your 10\u00d72 layout, I'd prefer the arrow keys being in a natural position (like a keyboard) as in the screenshot of @xqdoo00o, same for Home/End and PageUp/Down.. Clearly long press giving key repeat is a great feature (especially for arrow keys), I didn't know this feature ! However, I just tested it aaand it's not working.\nI was not not talking about any long press on a key, what are you talking about ?. People using \"|\" a lot might complain. What about adding some settings ?\nOne could choose between :\n- No extra keys\n- One line of extra keys : Esc Ctrl Alt Tab - / |\n- Two lines : your proposal\n- Custom\nIf implementing a settings menu is a big deal, the current way of doing it (long press on the Keyboard button in the left hidden menu) could cycle through the 3 first settings.\nFor me, your popup that's good enough... If I'm aware I can long press your keys to get new characters (which is not obvious, could be written in the wiki).\nLastly, what about this comment ?. Good, slipup is better than long press indeed. For the '\u2015 -' issue, I asked why did you remove '\u2015', it was more visible than '-' but that's just cosmetics, not so important :). How could this PR be accepted by the authors ? Or a least discuessed ? It seems like the repo didn't have any commit sinice 1 month but is a long requested feature in the issues @fornwall maybe ? :) I intend to use termux as a ipython for my classes at the university if the app suits my need ? :). That's a feature we're working on soon :)\nThere will be a button \"switch layout\" you can personize, so that you can switch layouts for example between \"terminal one line\", useful for vim, or python focus :). Merged with PR #605 that would be a great way to make the overlay customisable !\nAs long as the name of control keys are obvious and ascii, like LEFT, TAB, \"-\" etc.\nOr Unicode if the user wants to add \"\u00e9\" or greek letters or whatever he wants.. And the strings don't have to be of length 1, one could add keywords like if or lambda or if(){}.. @fornwall, that's not my PR ! However I think I have a good view of how a good customisation would be (as me and others talked on another PR and issue) but I don't know how to have a local build in order to code the change myself.. @neverwin could you rebase your changes now that #605 has been merged ?\nAlso, is the termux.properties file documented somewhere ?\nAbout the choice of syntax, we have \nextrakeys = [[\"ESC\",\"CTRL\",\"ALT\",\"TAB\",\"\u2015\",\"/\",\"|\"]]\nextrakeys must therefore be an list of list, what happens if is is not ? @fornwall \nI suggest at least those options (and documented somewhere on the wiki) : \n- If extrakeys = [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"], it means [[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]], formally, extrakeys is either a list of list, either a list of strings, in the latter case, it is converted to a list of size 1 containing the initial list.\n- The items can be strings or a json object. \"TAB\" is a shortcut for {\"key\": \"TAB\"}. Several options could then be added in future versions, like {\"key\": \"TAB\", \"display\": \"\u21b9\"} or {\"key\": \"TAB\", \"display\": \"\\u21B9\"}.\n- \"key\" means the key to emit, like \"TAB\" or \"/\" or any unicode string like \"if (\" or \"\u00e9t\u00e9\", some special keywords like TAB exist to supply special control characters, if one wants to write exactly the three letters \"TAB\" in one stroke, it is not possible.\n- \"display\" means the character displayed on the interface, if not provided, it defaults to \"key\".\nI think this should be implemented in this PR.\nMore ideas for future enhancement/PR include :\n\n\"weight\", would change the layout, defaults to 1. if there is a row like {\"key\":\"A\", \"weigth\":1}, {\"key\":\"SPACE\", display:\"\u2423\", \"weigth\": 3}, {\"key\":\"C\", \"weigth\": 1} it means the A takes 1/5 of the width, the SPACE takes 3/5, the C takes 1/5 of the width.\n\"longpress\", currently #605 added \"|\" on the \"-\" key and it is impossible to guess, in the config it could be written as {\"key\":\"-\", \"display\":\"\\u2013\", \"longpress\": {\"key\": \"|\"}}. A \"longpress\" key cannot contain a \"longpress\" attribute. \"longpress\" can be a list of keys instead of a string or object. Personnaly, I think having longpress keys is not very productive.\n\nI could code it myseslf and create my own PR if I knew how to build the app.. This should be configurable in the .properties, I like it sometimes to have only the custom keyboard (that is now fully configurable). I suggest thr option extra-keys.hide-with-classic-keyboard = true. Hey guys, the first version of the configurable extra keys is almost done in #788, new ideas or critics for configuration are welcome!. Yes it's configurable (create .termux/termux.properties and add the line extra-keys = [[\"ESC\", \"/\", \"-\", \"HOME\", \"UP\", \"END\", \"PGUP\"], [\"TAB\", \"CTRL\", \"ALT\", \"LEFT\", \"DOWN\", \"RIGHT\", \"PGDN\"]] in the order you want.\nand I also think the two row solution is a best default, I changed the default and that was not a good idea.\nThat's easily changeable in the source code as seen here : https://github.com/termux/termux-app/commit/3693e3c1b6da04398cbd73a28b44a764abc9bc3e. Very nice ! Thanks ! I was just about to start coding the PR myself. But I prefer to think about the functionalities and summarize them as I did. Giving  good input or good specs and let experts implement the feature. :smile: . > Also, more importantly, we/I need to add more validation of the extrakeys field! If, for example, two rows of different lengths are given the app crashes on start-up (with no change of fail-safe session).\nThat answers my question I had in the other PR. So yes, validation or default behavior, choose wisely. As goes the saying having good defaults is important, so is configuration.\nFor the case two lines of different length I'd say no error, it means all width = 1 (see my definition of width in the other PR), it's alright not to have a grid, our real hardware keyboards have hex layouts. :smile: \n\nI've also set the default extra keys to default to the single row we had before, and made the extra keys visible per default. Users who want several rows can configure it.\n\nWell, choose wisely the good defaults ! I think the people that don't know about configuration (beginners?) prefer the \u2191\u2193 arrows as mandatory for a shell and don't care \u2190\u2192 are very nice too but less important. Beginners don't know about the configuration until we don't write a good settings menu. The dash \"-\" and \"/\" is convenient but easily found on all the keyboards. The \"|\" is less used by beginners (and again found on all the keyboards). We should focus the default to be on missing keys of classic android keyboard, but that are still widely use. \u2190\u2192\u2193\u2191 are cleary it. And the 4, the Alt is useful for people knowing that emacs basic shortcuts like Alt+F exist.\nFor the one line order, I think \"\u2190\u2192\u2193\u2191\" is a good choice, because the most useful key is at the right. \"\u2190\u2193\u2191\u2192\" is my second advice because it's VIM like.\n\nJSON\n\nIt's JSON isn't it ? What kind of format termux.properties is made of ? I see you use single quote but they are not allowed in JSON, so is it a typo?\n\nWe should definitely ship a default termux.properties file with all the different options as comments, they are a bit secret as mentioned in the previous PR.\n\n:+1: And there is the wiki.\n\nI've also kept the \"swipe up from - for |\" and \"swipe up from / for \" features, though they are less needed with configurable keys.\n\nI've thought about this feature, it's only useful if it's explicitly written in the termux.properties. Nobody would think of slide-up if they're not told to. People try to press, sometimes to Long press, never to slide up, that's weird.\nHowever, if someone reads you can write \"slideup\": {\"key\": \"|\"} and tadaa, there it is ! it can become very handy to them.\n\nWhich I suppose is a UTF-8/UTF-16 error, and should be fixable\n\nAgain, what's the specification format for termux.properties ? If there is none, I suggest : \n\nBe UTF-8, because it's not the year 2000 anymore.\nIf the file begins with emacs style #coding: cp1252, then it declares the encoding. In python, we use a the simple regex ^[ \\t\\f]*#.*?coding[:=][ \\t]*([-_.a-zA-Z0-9]+) as defined in the PEP. \n\nMaybe your encoding is not correctly set on your machine, change all your tools to utf-8 I'd say. :smile: \n\nI also think that the keys take up too much vertical space\n\nThey do, on your screen, on mine they are less tall than that #HopeThisHelps. After reading the source code termux.properties is simply a file that must be in $HOME/.termux directory. Or in $HOME/.config/termux/ of type java.util.Properties. Which makes sense.\nHowever, also considering JSON has some advantages.\nThis .properties yields an error:\nextrakeys = [\n    [\"\u2190\", \"\u2192\", \"\u2193\", \"\u2191\"],\n    [\"CTRL\", \"ALT\", \"DEL\", \"TAB\"]\n]\nBecause new lines must be escaped:\nextrakeys = [\\\n    [\"\u2190\", \"\u2192\", \"\u2193\", \"\u2191\"],\\\n    [\"CTRL\", \"ALT\", \"DEL\", \"TAB\"]\\\n]\nWhich is annoying for that case.\nThe same information is available in JSON:\n{\"extrakeys\": [\n    [\"\u2190\", \"\u2192\", \"\u2193\", \"\u2191\"],\n    [\"CTRL\", \"ALT\", \"DEL\", \"TAB\"]\n]}\nI suggest that the code looks up for termux_config.json in both directories, and termux.properties in both directories. Merge the keys but yields a Warning if both files have keys in common, in that case, take the one in .properties.\nThe only advantage is that one doesn't have to put quotes around all the keys and values for simple cases like we generally have. Another advantage is that Comments are allowed. And that new lines don't have to be written \"\\n\". However everybody does know Json, less people know java.util.properties but the syntax is so intuitive that's alright. Both syntaxes allow \\u1234 syntax, neither does allow \\U12345678 syntax to input emojis by unicode.\nOne option would be to be more lenient on the json file:\n- Removes comments with '#', ie. lines BEGINNING with '#'. As in .properties, it is not allowed to have some text THEN a comment, a comment must be on one line.\n- If the file is not parsable as JSON object, add \"{}\" around it, if it isn't still possible, throw an error.\nWe could switch to YAML, but less people know about it. JSON is simple but more verbose.. I might fork the repo and add commits to the pull request, if I find how to do do that, do I have to do another PR? Or can I join in? I know git and branches but pretty new to github.\n\nI'm definitely no java expert though, but hey, thanks.\n\nCmon, a little bragging doesn't hurt, and expert doesn't have a good definition (this word makes me think about this humorous video).\n\nI managed to find the wiki entry for the configuration file location\n\nAnd in the source code.\n\nUTF-16\n\nIndeed, java does use UTF-16, sizeof(char) is 2 bytes. But in your screenshot, you seem to have 3 characters, which is utf-8 for the arrow keys. So I'd say it's utf-8 but should be utf-16. Thaaat's why I suggest the first line to be # coding: utf-8 to specify the encoding and \nAnd the default keys should be ascii. The user can write strings like \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\" for Arrow keys and control characters. That would be Displayed as \u2190\u2191\u2192\u2193 (\u21b2 Enter) (\u21b9 Tab). And if the user doesn't want that he can use the \"display\" property I was thinking of: \njson\nextrakeys = [[{\"key\":\"TAB\", \"display\":\"TAB\"}, {\"key\":\"CTRL\", \"display\":\"^\"}]]\nOr we can add a new option:\njson\nextrakeys = [[\"TAB\", \"CTRL\"]]\nextrakeys.controlcharstext = [\"TAB\", \"ENTER\"]\nThis would mean, these keys shall be rendered as \"TAB\" and \"ENTER\" and not their default (\u21b2 Enter, \u21b9 Tab) but I prefer the \"display\" per key.. Okep, I'll pull request You then.\nIndeed java.util.Properties sees # coding: utf-8 as a comment, but that would be something clever we would implement so that the user can specify the encoding he used. But because it's stupid to reinvent the wheel we'll take the convention of emacs, the same as the one from Python, we'd use that regex:\nregex\n^[ \\t\\f]*#.*?coding[:=][ \\t]*([-_.a-zA-Z0-9]+)\n\nYou have lots of good ideas that could probably be split into several PRs\n\nYep of course. The PR serves also as a conversation, We Could talk about the ideas in a Issue though, then go for multiple PR tagging that issue.\nHowever, the first version of the implementation should be thought, not just this sounds good to me, here's my PR and fornwall would be like This is great, I'll push it on the store aaand the new user will complain Why do you put two bars and no configurable keys.\nOkep, back to coding, however I currently can't test the app myself (pretty new to android native app), how do I do that? :smile: At first I'll do the Java-Only parts.. For the encoding issue, in TermuxPreferences.java:\njava\ntry (FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(propsFile)) {\n    props.load(new InputStreamReader(in, \"utf-8\"));\n}\nInstead of  props.load(in);.\nThe java.util.Properties class has two load functions seen here. The old code used a byte oriented class and we want a character oriented one, the old-code assumed latin1 encoding which is not a good default anymore.. Alright, I just added two commits, but I didn't test it because I haven't installed the android sdk yet. If you could compile and test for me that'd be good.\n\nDefault file uses \"LEFT\" instead of \"\u2190\", that's more easy for people to input and doesn't have encoding problems.\nRefactoring of code using Ctrl, Alt, Fn. Many copy paste, I refactored that.. > I don't see why an IndexError would happen as long as we iterate over it properly, an array of arrays with different row lengths seem to be allowed in java.\n\nYes, they are allowed, yes for(int i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) for(int j = 0; j < buttons[i].length; j++) buttons[i][j] is the correct way to iterate.\nBut the code does cols = maximumLength(buttons) and the class ExtraKeysView extends GridLayout, so I don't know if the layout is streched by default, I think currently what would happen if lets say we have [['LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP', 'DOWN'], ['CTRL', TAB']], the CTRL and TAB would occupy each 25% of the space, the right-most 50% and just two \"spacebar\" buttons (ie. nothing displayed, sends a \" \") where 50% seems better. I know nothing about Android layouts. :woman_shrugging: \nHowever, as you said, let's create different PR from different possibilities, and discuss in here, oh and watch out the changes done on configurable_keys_smaller with david xqdoo00o. \n\nSo now that you've implemented most special keys as LEFT -> \u2190, TAB -> \u21b9 etc, do you still think it's important to change the props.load() function\n\nNo, if people copy paste, it must be utf-8. However, adding the regex is very easy and very classic in vim/emacs, this can be done (by me, when I feel like it) but not documented on the wiki.. ### Next Features\n\n[ ] Streching layout to allow different row lengths [['LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'UP', 'DOWN'], ['CTRL', TAB']].\n[ ] Adding a simple parameter to choose when the arrows are used, based on the Map in my source code, I see two parameters:\n[ ] extra-keys.character-display that can be one of default, lots-of-arrows, arrows-only, full-iso, no-replacement, each one has a Map in the code. no-replacement would use the Empty map.\n[ ] extra-keys.arrows-display = arrow by default, using \u2190\u2192\u2191\u2193, it could be triangles that would use \u25c0\u25bc\u25b2\u25b6.\n[ ] extra-keys could be a list of string instead of a list of list of strings. \n[ ] extra-keys could be a matrix of object, in order to easily configure each key differently to allow {\"key\":\"ENTER\", \"display\":\"\u00d7\"} for example.\n[ ] Once we understand how to stretch layout, the option {\"width\": n} would allow different sizes, like [{\"key\":\"CTRL\", \"width\":1}, [{\"key\":\"SPACE\", \"width\":3}, [{\"key\":\"ALT\", \"width\":1},]\n[ ] extra-keys can be a string one-line or two-lines and other useful layouts we'd imagine in the future. Me I would go for a python-one-line preset featuring =+-*/:()_ and why not [] on longpress on ( maybe? ^^ User could add all those mappings in another setting like extra-keys.layouts = {\"python-one-line\": [\"=\", \"(\", \")\", \"+\", \"*\", \":\"]}, and only some are builtin (most popular would go builtins? builtins could be rewritten in that map?).\n[ ] We should add a default termux.properties that has the one-line version and two-lines version commented.\n[ ] Test what happens when two CTRL keys are added (there should only be one state, Hence the map specialButtons would be a map to a list).\n[ ] Add JSON and XML formats.\n[ ] Add simple gui preferences, the file would override.\n\nFeatures done\n\n[x] To be consistent, the termux.properties settings should be called extra-keys and not extrakeys, or I can write a code that would automatically allow extrakeys extra-keys extra_keys for all keys.. Oh and don't forget to change the U+2015 \u2015 HORIZONTAL BAR into a ascii dash:\n\ndiff\n- JSONArray arr = new JSONArray(props.getProperty(\"extrakeys\", \"[[\\\"ESC\\\",\\\"CTRL\\\",\\\"ALT\\\",\\\"TAB\\\",\\\"\u2015\\\",\\\"/\\\",\\\"|\\\"]]\"));\n+ JSONArray arr = new JSONArray(props.getProperty(\"extrakeys\", \"[[\\\"ESC\\\",\\\"CTRL\\\",\\\"ALT\\\",\\\"TAB\\\",\\\"-\\\",\\\"/\\\",\\\"|\\\"]]\"));\nFor the default one line bar.\n@Grimler91 I just added a commit with that change and renaming to extra-keys in my repo, would you merge it without me doing a PR? Or you could add a collaborator to have push access to the config configurable_keys branch in your repo? I don't need push access.\nWhen you say cherry pick my commit, you mean executing git pull robert configuration_keys when your own local branch configuration_keys? After adding git remote add robert https://github.com/robertvandeneynde/termux-app?. About JSON version, the org.json package is included by default in android, I'm wondering if it uses the same api as this project on Maven at its latest version? Here is the link on github.\nFrom the doc, single quotes are normal, and often don't need to even used ! \nThe texts produced bfy the toString methods strictly conform to the JSON syntax rules. The constructors are more forgiving in the texts they will accept:\n\n\nAn extra , (comma) may appear just before the closing brace.\nStrings may be quoted with ' (single quote).\nStrings do not need to be quoted at all if they do not begin with a quote or single quote, and if they do not contain leading or trailing spaces, and if they do not contain any of these characters: { } [ ] / \\ : , # and if they do not look like numbers and if they are not the reserved words true, false, or null.\n\n\nSo the default can be written:\nextra-keys = [[ESC, CTRL, ALT, TAB, \"-\", \"/\", \"|\"]]\nThe last three don't have to be escaped, but I prefer it like this.\nBackslashs are annoying, i might want to add a BACKSLASH alias :p \nThat's the correct spelling:\nextra-keys = [[ENTER, \"\\\\\\\\\", ALT]]\nThey also have a org.json.Property to work along with java.util.Properties :thinking: . Yes, 4 backslashes for a single backslash, because Both Json and Properties use \\\\ for a backslash.\nThat's why BACKSLASH is the most useful ascii alias, QUOTE and APOSTROPHE, seems good too. And if people what to be sure about escapes, we should consider ~/.termux/termux_properties.json(or is the . a better idea than _?)\nAdding other ascii aliases seems a bit stupid (but we had to, I'd pick all unicode names and aliases or all ascii names in unix /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols aka xkb_symbols because lots of people know them), but I prefer people write \"-\", \"/\" better than...\n\nHYPHEN-MINUS (uniname), SOLIDUS (uniname), REVERSE SOLIDUS (uniname), REVERSE-SOLIDUS (uniname.replace(' ', '-')), BACKSLASH (X11 name), TILDE (uniname), ASCIITILDE (X11 name), GRAVE ACCENT (uniname), GRAVE (X11 name), BACKTICK (slang), QUOTATION MARK (uniname), APOSTROPHE (uniname).\n\nHowever, aliases for controls characters is an idea, ^D \\u0004 <EOT> END OF TRANSMISSION for example, or \\u0007 <BEL> BELL. We already have U+0008 \\x08 <BS> BACKSPACE after all. I'm, I named BKSP but the small unicode alias is BS. :thinking:. @Grimler91 In your comment below the screenshot, write that you wrote extra-keys = [[\"ESC\", \"/\", \"ENTER\", \"HOME\", \"UP\",  \"DELETE\", \"-\"], [\"TAB\", \"CTRL\", \"ALT\", \"LEFT\", \"DOWN\"]]. People might want to read the PR to see the changes, this gives a good idea of the implemented features when just reading the PR. Also remove your first screenshot where you had an encoding problem.. @fornwall  this PR is ready to be merged in!\nA screenshot explains the thing when extra-keys = [[\"ESC\", \"/\", \"ENTER\", \"HOME\", \"UP\", \"DELETE\", \"-\"], [\"TAB\", \"CTRL\", \"ALT\", \"LEFT\", \"DOWN\"]] in set in termux.properties.\nRelease notes include:\n\nExtra keys are enabled by default and include UP and DOWN arrow keys by default on one single line.\nExtra keys are configurable by adding extra-keys attribute in ~/.termux/termux.properties to customize layout of extra keys. The old one line bar can be used with extra-keys = [[\"ESC\", \"CTRL\", \"ALT\", \"TAB\", \"-\", \"/\", \"|\"]] or the new two lines bar can be used with extra-keys = [[\"ESC\", \"/\", \"-\", \"HOME\", \"UP\", \"END\", \"PGUP\"], [\"TAB\", \"CTRL\", \"ALT\", \"LEFT\", \"DOWN\", \"RIGHT\"]]. All the possible keys can be seen in the source code in the map keyCodesForString in ExtraKeysView.java, aliases like RETURN for ENTER can be seen in the map controlCharsAliases.. The app currently uses SharedPreference interface for some settings (I've seen it somewhere in the source code), I don't know for what. But it is but it seems to be a classic way to store settings in android. We could add that in another small PR, the idea would be also to have a classic \"settings\" menu when some useful settings will be changed in a gui, the dotfile would override. We currently look for multiple locations and that's a good thing.\n\nAbout xml, we could also add a simple xml interface when we'll add JSON (currently only java.util.Properties type is allowed), if people likes xml more than JSON or properties, why not. However, xml is verbose, JSON less, properties is a good tradeoff.\nOn Ubuntu, that's standard to keep app infos in ~/.config, because the $HOME dir is related to the user whereas /etc is about root. When people back their stuff, they backup $HOME.\nAbout the directory /data/data/com.termux/, if it's standard on Android app (I'm no Android expert), we'll add the location.\nAbout the filename, com.termux_preferences, is that standard? Or just your first idea?. Ok I see, the file in shared_prefs currently only contains show_extra_keys, current_session and fontsize.\nThe current advantage of ~/.config is that users can cd ~/.config in the terminal, whereas cd /data/data/com.termux/shared_prefs is longer. But we could add a symlink ln -s /data/data/com.termux/shared_prefs/com.termux_preferences.xml ~/.termux_preferences.xml or similar.\nAnd again, the advantage of java.util.Properties is that it's very brief and not verbose. But I agree this does the trick too:\nxml\n<?xml version='1.0' ?>\n<map>\n    <string name=\"extra-keys\">[\n        [\"CTRL\", \"ALT\", \"DELETE\"]\n    ]</string>\n</map>\nXml does ask more questions, <string name=\"extra-keys\"> vs <json name=\"extra-keys\">? Don't use json and use xml?\nxml\n<!-- very verbose -->\n<?xml version='1.0' ?>\n<map>\n    <rows name=\"extra-keys\">\n        <row>\n            <key>CTRL</key>\n            <key>ALT</key>\n            <key>DELETE</key>\n        </row>\n    </rows>\n</map>\nI prefer the <string name=\"extra-keys\">[[\"CTRL\", \"ALT\", \"DELETE\"]]</string> from far, the xml does ask too much questions (should I use CTRL vs  etc.).\nWhat is the point of view of @fornwall ? Why did you choose ~/.config and java.util.Properties instead of SharedPreferences for the keys?\nHowever I think this can be in a future PR, and using something standard for android is nice. As the dev guide says, SharePreferences is useful for storing simple key/value data, which is what our .properties does.. However, I think the new default must be reconsidered:\n- people like one line\n- people like arrow keys, especially UP and DOWN (it's a terminal!)\n- the default width seems to be 7\n- the - / | are useful but already there on all keyboards.\nI suggest the new default being:\nextra-keys = [[\"ESC\", \"TAB\", \"CTRL\", \"ALT\", \"-\", \"DOWN\", \"UP\"]]\nI don't think there is enough space to have both \"- / |\" and \"\u2193\u2191\".\nThe choice of \"-\" is kind of arbitrary, but I think \"-\" is more useful, to provide options and termux-like-commands.\nAlso, the order ESC TAB CTRL ALT seems better too, because ESC is expected to be to the left-most (useful in vim), TAB also, and about CTRL and ALT, they are always followed by another letter.\nAnd of course, we'll find later a way to explain to people how to write the .properties file on the wiki and/or doing a proper Preferences panel easily accessible.. @fornwall any feedback/approbation? . I figured out you were on vacation :)\nI'm still wondering if the default should be on one line with arrow keys like in my last commit or on two lines, and if show_extra_keys should be displayed by default (I think yes, majority of people don't know about changing keyboards or can't plug a real keyboard).\nAnd also, because the left menu cannot be found easily, add an entry \"show side menu\" to the long press menu. And a text \"long press on the screen to see the options\" in the welcoming message in the terminal.\nFor the future, I think some accessibility are useful, I'm seeing a classic \"settings\" (Preferences) panel. Such that basic settings can be changed in a classic way, without editing dot files.. @fornwall ? It's been 2 months when you said \"soon\" :p Isn't there someone else that can test and publish a new version on the store ?. Humm, so alias pbcopy=termux-clipboard-set, and alias pbpaste=termux-clipboard-get in theory, however I get this error :\nbash\n~ termux-clipboard-get\ncmd: Can't find service: activity. I did pkg install termux-api, should I do more ? What do you mean by app and package ?. Alright ! I've downloaded the termux api app on the store, but I still get cmd: Can't find service: activity should I run it or something ?. Could be refactored:\njava\ncase \"\u2212\":\ncase \"-\":\n    // if it's \"\u2212\" or \"-\", it's the same output\n    chars = \"-\";\n    break;\nIncluding the comment, not so much people know the syntax.. Add case \"ENTER\": too, of course the displayed chars must be \"\u21b2\" but if people write ENTER in termux.properties it should work as expected.. Add aliases, PAGE_DOWN, PAGEDOWN etc. People are likely to have that in their termux.properties.\nSame for INSERT, DELETE, BACKSPACE, UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT etc. A short name that is the preffered one, and longer name explicit.. In the case we have buttonText.length != 1, I would go for:\njava\nArrays.asList(\"\u2015\", \"/\", \"-\").contains(yourValue). What if the guy wrote \"\\u2015\" in the termux properties? We should remove that case, if he wrote \"\\u2015\" it means he wants to write U+2015 \u2015 HORIZONTAL BAR. Not U+002D - HYPHEN-MINUS.\nThe default config should contains the ascii dash (U+002D - HYPHEN-MINUS), but should be displayed as \"\u2212\" (U+2212 \u2212 MINUS SIGN) in the shell. See my display parameter in the PR.. java\nput(\"BACKSLASH\", \"\\\\\");\nput(\"QUOTE\", \"\\\"\");\nput(\"APOSTROPHE\", \"'\");. ",

I'd be very in favor for having a way to opt out of the [Process completed - press Enter to close] message.  My idea (from issue #14) was to have an environment variable that would change this behavior.  Something like TERMUX_AUTO_CLOSE=1 could be (1) set in a script on-demand or (2) set in a user's dotfiles so that it sticks.  I'm not sure if this is a possible solution, but it would seem to hit a couple of important use cases.\n\nOne of the reasons I want it:  I have a couple of \"shortcut\" scripts that I run from the Termux widget that pop up a dialog for input.  After filling in the dialog and hitting \"OK\", I still have to wait for the rest of the script to finish and hit the enter key on my keyboard to close the Termux session.  It would be nice to just fill in the dialog and then not have to interact anymore, at least in this situation.\n. It feels like we should maybe have an issue for the [Process completed - press Enter to close] discussion, either reopening this one or creating a new one.\nAn idea I just had: have two entries in the app drawer to start Termux (which I think you can do in Android).  Normal \"Termux\" and \"Termux Safe Mode\".  The latter wouldn't respect the value of TERMUX_AUTO_CLOSE so that a broken environment could be fixed if necessary.\n. Manually updating apt and then running apt update && apt upgrade seems to have taken care of it.  Thanks!\n. ",

The execution flow prevents inception-like deeply nested calls to proot, but performs a one-time hop on initial app startup so that sshd starts inside a chroot'd environment (if you don't need chroot to auto-invoke, just remove that line). I've tested 3 different (concurrent) open ssh sessions (via FireSSH and Google's NaSSH) without issues. sshd will only be invoked once, and subsequent calls will only invoke the normal ... sshd -D process. Rebooting or force restarting Termux behaves as expected, with sshd and chroot autostarted. This is obviously no substitute for first-class init daemon support, and potentially risky if fat-fingered, but hopefully might help others looking for a short-term fix.\n# Create/append to:  ~/.bash_profile\nif ! pgrep -f \"termux-chroot\" >/dev/null ; then echo \"[Starting chroot...]\" && termux-chroot; else echo \"[chroot is running]\"; fi\nif ! pgrep \"sshd\" >/dev/null ; then echo \"[Starting sshd...]\" && sshd && echo \"[OK]\"; else echo \"[ssh is running]\"; fi\n\nNote the -f flag is required because of the way the termux-chroot shell script works, but is not needed with sshd.

Move the bashrc (or bash_profile) to a new name and restart termux.. To be more explicit, kennwhite's script snippet is designated to run two services (or programs), with the second service (or program) dependent upon the first program.  (eg. Similar to making sshd dependent upon establishing an ethernet connection.)\nSo the following is all you really need within bashrc, or preferably bash_profile if bash_profile works on your termux install:\nif ! pgrep -f \"crond\" >/dev/null; then\n     echo \"[Starting crond...]\" && crond && echo \"[OK]\"\nelse\n     echo \"[crond is running]\"\nfi\nThe reason why bash_profile is preferred, bash_profile is called once during initial login, versus bashrc upon each shell opening.

    "gscholt": "\nWith 'get the extended-keys soft-keyboard', do you mean that the soft keyboard pops up in addition to the escape key being sent?\n\nCorrect.\nThere is some coupling between the hardware and the software keyboard. The 'search', 'alt' and '...' key are all used as regular modifier keys, but they also have their own function if not used as a modifier. Similar to how windows treats the 'windows' (aka 'meta'?) key: win+key is an action, but just the win key also pops up the start menu. In the case of the Pixel C Keyboard the ... functions like AltGr does when you have a non-English keyboard layout selected, so perhaps it really just is that key (e.g.: if you select Us-International layout, the '...'+5 turns into a \u20ac). If you however just press that key, you get the soft-keyboard extended symbols tab. Just like if just press the 'alt' key, you get the soft-keyboard emoji tab.\nThe escape key seems to be treated differently than other keys in this manner. '...'+o and '...'+p just insert the correct [ and ] key. '...'+1 correctly functions like escape, but also still opens the soft-keyboard as if you did not press the 1 key before releasing the '...' key.\nIf I were to guess, perhaps only the '1' key is marked as consumed but the '...' modifier key is not? Perhaps the keyboard literally sends AltGr-down, Esc-down, Esc-up, AltGr-up, and termux doesn't eat the modifier key for escape like it does for other keys, so it arrives at the system which only sees the AltGr events and does the soft-keyboard stuff.\n. Perhaps it has to do with [\"replace\" key event] support, apparently new in android, see:\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/a43a96b%5E%21/#F0\nwhere they added the mapping for the +1 -> ESCAPE to the keyboard driver.\nThis is really a special beast it seems?\n. I did some playing around with the app.\nMy observations:\n- flags, source, keyboard type and device id are constant\n- the ...+1 -> esc mapping IS special\n- the ...+2 0-> ` mapping is NOT special.\n- the 1 key has keycode 8\n- the 2 key has keycode 9\n- the key with ...+1 has keycode 111 (this is esc?)\n- the key with ...+2 still has keycode 9\n  Logging follows:\nPressing '...'+'1':\nDate: Wed Dec 23 19:21:37 GMT+01:00 2015\nDevice Manufacturer: google\nDevice Model: Pixel C\nDevice Board: dragon\nDevice Bootloader: Google_Smaug.7132.260.0\nAndroid Version: REL 6.0.1 (sdk:23)\n* Key Event Detected *\nKey Code: 58\nAction: 0\nMeta State: 34\nFlags: 8\nSource: 257\nKeyboard Type: 2\nDevice ID: 42\n* Key Event Detected *\nKey Code: 111\nAction: 0\nMeta State: 0\nFlags: 8\nSource: 257\nKeyboard Type: 2\nDevice ID: 42\n* Key Event Detected *\nKey Code: 111\nAction: 1\nMeta State: 0\nFlags: 8\nSource: 257\nKeyboard Type: 2\nDevice ID: 42\n* Key Event Detected *\nKey Code: 58\nAction: 1\nMeta State: 0\nFlags: 8\nSource: 257\nKeyboard Type: 2\nDevice ID: 42\nPressing just '1'\nDate: Wed Dec 23 19:33:30 GMT+01:00 2015\nDevice Manufacturer: google\nDevice Model: Pixel C\nDevice Board: dragon\nDevice Bootloader: Google_Smaug.7132.260.0\nAndroid Version: REL 6.0.1 (sdk:23)\n* Key Event Detected *\nKey Code: 8\nAction: 0\nMeta State: 0\nFlags: 8\nSource: 257\nKeyboard Type: 2\nDevice ID: 42\n* Key Event Detected *\nKey Code: 8\nAction: 1\nMeta State: 0\nFlags: 8\nSource: 257\nKeyboard Type: 2\nDevice ID: 42\nPressing '...'+'2'  (resulting in `)\nDate: Wed Dec 23 19:34:09 GMT+01:00 2015\nDevice Manufacturer: google\nDevice Model: Pixel C\nDevice Board: dragon\nDevice Bootloader: Google_Smaug.7132.260.0\nAndroid Version: REL 6.0.1 (sdk:23)\n* Key Event Detected *\nKey Code: 58\nAction: 0\nMeta State: 34\nFlags: 8\nSource: 257\nKeyboard Type: 2\nDevice ID: 42\n* Key Event Detected *\nKey Code: 9\nAction: 0\nMeta State: 34\nFlags: 8\nSource: 257\nKeyboard Type: 2\nDevice ID: 42\n* Key Event Detected *\nKey Code: 9\nAction: 1\nMeta State: 34\nFlags: 8\nSource: 257\nKeyboard Type: 2\nDevice ID: 42\n* Key Event Detected *\nKey Code: 58\nAction: 1\nMeta State: 0\nFlags: 8\nSource: 257\nKeyboard Type: 2\nDevice ID: 42\nPressing just '2'\nDate: Wed Dec 23 19:34:24 GMT+01:00 2015\nDevice Manufacturer: google\nDevice Model: Pixel C\nDevice Board: dragon\nDevice Bootloader: Google_Smaug.7132.260.0\nAndroid Version: REL 6.0.1 (sdk:23)\n* Key Event Detected *\nKey Code: 9\nAction: 0\nMeta State: 0\nFlags: 8\nSource: 257\nKeyboard Type: 2\nDevice ID: 42\n* Key Event Detected *\nKey Code: 9\nAction: 1\nMeta State: 0\nFlags: 8\nSource: 257\nKeyboard Type: 2\nDevice ID: 42\n.

Problem solved.\nAwesome, thanks.\n. I have a very strong preference for Ctrl+Shift, the less keys the better imo. In my regular use I switch \"tabs\" frequently, so the easier the better.\nAn other option could be the 'Search' key perhaps (I believe it's the Meta key internally, but not sure), but I do not know if it can be used fully as a modifier, since (on the Pixel C at least) the OS captures some of the Search+ keybindings for showing the home screen, gmail, etc.\n. > Given platform should take precedence over user-specific bindings, I'm open to anything that will not break Chrome\nThe reasoning is sound, but unfortunately incompatible with the Pixel C without some trickery. Ctrl+ is a very common terminal shortcut, and the Pixel C platform requires you to add an ... (Right-Alt) to that.\nI can see three options:\n1. Detect a Chromebook and use Ctrl+Alt+ there, and use Ctrl+Shift+ otherwise. This is lousy, horrible to document and possibly confusing.\n2. Introduce a setting to let the user switch between a default Ctrl+Alt+ and Ctrl+Shift+. Then you can keep documenting the default behavior (which has more use cases, Pixel C is special).\n3. Hope my guess that the [...] key is indeed the right alt, and change the keybindings to be Ctrl+LeftAlt+ specifically. This could confuse users that actually have 2 keys labeled Alt, where one doesn't work.\nOption 2 seems like the best one to me. Option 3 seems like the least amount of work.\n. ",

Can you see any data in the storage folder?\nAre you using Android unified storage?\nDid you upgrade Android/file manager app? Do this file manager have the storage/sd card permisions?\nYour SD card is almost empty; Did you try list the contents on another device?. Are the file names written in English?\nDo you know what character set you use, if not?. I don't think so.\nLet's think a bit how to split the screen first place:\n\nWhat happens if the devices aren't identical?\nOne of the devices is turned;\nA large keyboard is activated on a device;\nBoth devices zoom in different ways;\nA mouse event happens in a area that no longer is part of the screen;\nA connection between the two devices isn't local but over the internet, sometimes;\nConnection between the the two devices hangs or gets unresponsive often.\n\n\n\nIf ignored, you get garbage and sometimes a unresponsive terminal. I think nobody likes a terminal that randomly destroys itself.. I think the only alternative cursor mode you get is the text input view. From the manual:\nText Input View\nTerminal emulators usually do not support the advanced features of touch keyboards like autocorrect, prediction and swipe typing. To solve this, Termux has a text input view. Text entered in it will get pasted to the terminal. Because it's a native Android text input view, all touch keyboard features will work. To access the text input view you have to swipe the extra keys view to the left.\n(...)\nTo enable the extra keys view you have to long tap on the keyboard button in the left drawer menu. You can also press Volume Up+Q.\n. The extra keys do adapt to the current Termux::Style color scheme. Using 0.64.\nYou don't need to long press the menu if you have a software touch keyboard, Volume up+Q does the same thing.. Default SELinux settings prevent applications from reading and writing other applications files even as root. Once a file or folder has been written by an app, it's considered that app folder.\nCan't you use symlinks to shared storage instead? Shared storage (if done correctly using AOSP APIs) should have the correct SELinux ACL and uid/gid out of the box.. My educated guess without a error message is that you didn't install libxslt-dev or ruby-dev.. ",

It wont kill any other running panes. But if the current pane is the only one left it will stop termux without the enter problem.\nOne problem it has is that it will also kill any background things you have running. E.g sshd run from a task shortcut. You could tweak it to account for that though but probably not as a one liner. It will probably also have more issues. It's a pity the fix for this enter problem was never merged.\nIm no expert but this is roughly how it works for anyone interested:\n- Everything within [ and ] is evaluated to either true or false\n- Everything within $( ) is run in another shell and the stdout is returned\n- ps is the process status command, it prints all the proccesses it can see\n- the grep command filters this for anything that has the string bin/bash\n- the [b] part is a trick to exclude the grep command itself from the ps output using a little regex\n- the -c switch to grep causes it to output a count of matches instead of the matches\n- -eq 2 then compares that output to the value 2. 2 since $() spawns another shell\n- anything after && runs only if the last command was successful/true/0\n- anything after || runs only if the last command was unsuccessful/false/1\n- killall is a command that kills all proccesses it finds by name.\n- com.termux is the parent proccess of all panes, so killing it will kill them all\nSo all panes are killed if only 1 is left. Otherwise it simply runs exit.. @l-jonas \nA timeout would be almost the same as the last suggestion in comment 8 by Neo-Oli.\nA lingering notification would be nicer than a lingering window though IMO. Especially if it was as long as 15 seconds.. @fornwall have you had any ideas on how this should be achieved? ~/.shortcuts/tasks is great but won't do for user input or anything that needs to display more than snippets of information via toasts.\nIMO the lingering notification or an additional shortcut for failsafe mode would be the most intuitive and least intrusive.. I thought this issue was for discussing the removal of the process completed message?\nThe current commit is good and I like it. But I still want the full removal. Its just so much cleaner for oneshot scripts.\nIf that discussion is no longer to be here, then where should those still hoping for the proper removal go?. @sdrausty I just want to be able to have scripts do a task then fully close. I'm not too bothered with the exit codes so far. But I thought the resistance to the full implementation argued that exit codes were insufficient to protect user error induced lockout.\nAn option that causes nonzero to always mean don't auto close is good too though.. We definitely should have some way to fully close it programatically. Fear of locking out shouldn't be given so much priority in my opinion.\nEspecially since as things are now, you can already lock yourself out.\nSo a proper failsafe for full scripted closing would save anyone from the ways you can already lock yourself out.\nThere have been multiple ways suggested to achieve this safely:\nLingering notification\nFile on internal storage\nLong press app shortcut\nSeparate failsafe app shortcut\nSo why are they never considered? Frankly If I had to choose between super safety and no full auto close, or no safety with full auto close, I'd choose no safety any day. As I'm sure many who have complained about this would.\nI feel responsibility should be placed on the user to manage their environment properly. If they lock themselves out, and are unrooted. They are the one at fault, not Termux.\nSo perhaps if a proper safe method is too much work, we could have a quick and dirty option to opt in to the unsafe close with a stern disclaimer? Please? =D. > I'm against completely disabling 'Failsafe shell' since there always should be way to access environment in case of script or binary failure. [...]\n\nIf someone don't agree with that [...]\n\nOh no I absolutely do agree that should be the recommended and default configuration. It's very sensible.\nIt's just that many people, including myself, have scripts that they would like to fire, interact and forget. (Interact since just fire and forget can be implemented in a ~/.shortcuts/tasks script.)\nIdeally we would like a less intrusive way to launch the failsafe shell that doesn't get in the way of that, while keeping the failsafe accessible. Like some of the options discussed.\nBut there are many who have root and/or recovery who would be just as happy (and safe) with an option to disable it. Generally this power user group are the ones who on average are more likely to actually be the ones customizing things like .bashrc and/or fire, interact and forget scripts anyway.\nObviously not suitable for pure vanilla users hence why I said a stern disclaimer would be needed. It was more about it probably being much easier to implement than one of the nice, best of both worlds methods. And also about user choice. Even if for them its the choice to shoot themselves in the foot lol.\n\nSo current solution is only #793. All other solutions are subject for future since not every one is suitable for all supported Android versions.\n\nI see. Is this why they have never been implemented? Could you elaborate on what problems some of them have?\n\n[...] - feel free to fork Termux and introduce your changes, but only in fork =)\n\nRegrettably I have no experience/skill in Android or even Java coding lol. My code also tends to be messy and ugly so Its probably best to leave Termux to the pros. If I had the skill I would go for a PR on one of the methods that give everyone what they want. But I didn't even know they would sometimes be version specific so its pretty above me =(. > i added line instead to automate input of Enter key:\n\nnohup /system/bin/input keyevent 66 2> /dev/null&\n\nThanks for sharing, a great workaround. I'm now using this =D\nHowever for me at least using input requires root. Which requires a little extra time to authorize from Magisk, leaving a little pause at the end of each session. Not ideal but a good compromise until a proper fix is created. Hopefully this issue can finally be put to rest soon though. Coming up on 3 years next month =S\nAnyway the root change makes the command:\nnohup su -c 'input keyevent 66' &>/dev/null &\nI also changed the redirect to &> to silence both stdout and stderr. Otherwise nohup was creating a nohup.out file.. Thanks  @pcrow, importing does make it work without root. This has cut the uncomfortable delay slightly.\nMy. bash_logout is now:\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/system/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\nexport PATH=${PATH}:/system/bin\nnohup input keyevent 66 &>/dev/null &\nOn another note, I don't know how I missed it, but this issue is closed?!\nThis issue is definitely not fixed. The best we ever got was less press enter, but the issue is clear though that we want ZERO press enter messages.\n@grimler91 @fornwall @xeffyr can one of you please reopen this issue. It's still not fixed.\n. I agree that if your just casually using termux pressing enter is no big deal. \nI am not however. I have it as an ssh server itself and a remote task starter for my server at home. Using the .shortcut folder and widgets. \nI have a large list of shortcuts and I often have to press a few.\nSince it can't be closed programmatically I either have to:\nActivate the shortcuts one by one. Which is painfully slow.\nor:\ntab out and press the next while the others are running. Creating a situation where I have to go back later and press enter sometimes as many as 10 times in a row.\nSheltering noobs is fine. But not at the expense of encumbering those who could easily fix simple problems like a bad .bashrc config.\nI think any solution to this would make this already versatile and fantastic app much better.\nIMO The seperate failsafe shortcut idea sounds the most noob friendly.. @alexlance is right. No more enter spamming! yey! Thanks for sharing :-) The shortcut widget prefixes the shortcut with task/ so some of my shortcut names are a little truncated. And the Termux window doesn't show at all so any info you might want to display while the shortcut is running will need to be changed to toasts. Really happy with this regardless. Would still like to have the window show with a no enter needed option as well though. For long messages toasts aren't ideal.. Further tested the .shortcut/tasks method - since termux doesn't show at all any script that needs user input via read command or similar won't work. Just realized when testing my home light control script which runs a script on my server via ssh and has a menu using the read command. So still stuck with press enter in this case.. @Grimler91 True, but the exit message wont protect you from everything anyway. Such as killall com.termux in your bashrc. A way to properly close termux panes programatically is sorely needed.\nMany, including myself have said as much on various issues such as Issue 56\nEdit: woops. Just saw that you've already saw Issue 56 and referenced this from there.. Excellent stuff, hopefully it'll be merged. I take it this should fix issue #56 as well?. > I currently haven't disabled this message. But after implementing menu it is no longer needed.\nAh good that's fantastic.

Found an alternative for my Android 8.1! As I said before killall com.termux didn't work because it doesn\u2019t show up as a process.\nMy alternative is to kill the ppid of the shell. Something like kill `/system/bin/ps -p $$ -o ppid= | tr -d \" \\n\"` will kill the parent process of the shell, presumably Termux. The parent doesn\u2019t show on ps or /proc but we can still kill it. For it to work on subshells we need to find the top parent, like what I'm now using on my dotfiles repo.. @arigit On my Nokia 8 with Android 8.1 I don't have that problem, I can press enter to close a terminal, but I don't like that specially when running scripts from the widget. On Android 6 you could put killall com.termux at the end of the scripts to kill Termux. For Android 8 kill `/system/bin/ps -p $$ -o ppid= | tr -d \" \\n\"` works. Just put that at the end, because it kills the Termux app it also closes all the terminals.\nIf you want to kill Termux from a running shell, copy this kill-termux function to your .bashrc then you can run kill-termux to kill everything.\nTry installing the Hacker's Keyboard, might fix with your Enter problem.. I'm also following this issue hoping for a way to completely remove the process completed message.\n793 is a improvement but not a full solution. In my case I just want my widget scripts to run and exit in one click. I continue to use one of the killall solutions above, but that does have the disadvantage of killing other sessions that are running in the background.\nI think the SIGHUP solution (referenced above) is the best: https://github.com/cvirostek/termux-app/commit/cfdddcca45ed062fc70f60f292e8808951914c88\nA new option on termux.properties could be added to enable it.\nUltimately it all comes back to finding a way that doesn't lock the user and allows to start a failsafe session. Honestly I probably could lock myself right now by adding a killall to .bashrc. I don't think adding some solution based on signals increases the chance of a user lockout.\nAlso adding a shortcut (long press app icon, https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/shortcuts/) to create failsafe session could also the a good addition..

On any unix like system users can break their accounts with buggy init files and a dozen other ways,  With termux there is no admin to save users from their mistakes but pretty much anything a user can do to screw up his environment (buggy .profile, .bashrc, etc) can be fixed by either clearing termux data or re-installing it.  I would add an option in termux.properties to disable the prompt for Enter and advise users to periodically backup their work, maybe even provide a pair of scripts to do backup/restore to/from shared storage.

(The keyboard has always been a reason for me to have stuck with Xperias anyway <3). Actually if the session is aware of whether all attached processes have gone already (which seems to be the case, judging by the strking through of the session index), perhaps we can even make short-press on such session as exit.. Experiencing similar issue here with emacs. It's not triggered by a key combination or quitting here tho, but merely rolling the screen can. Also Xperia X here.. Today I experienced the same thing on another phone (from a minor vendor in China). I was sending a /quit in ERC (an IRC client in Emacs).. I wonder if it's a termux issue though. I mean, if a force reboot can be triggered like this, it's probably some bug in the kernel or the libc used in our Android?. > If TZ is not in the environment, Emacs uses system wall clock time, which is a platform-dependent default time zone.\nFrom the \"Source\" you linked. At the very least, things work fine for me without TZ set (Android 7.1.1, if it matters). current-time-zone and format-time-string \"%T %Z\" gives me the same time(zone) as the  Android system ones. They change accordingly in Emacs after I change timezone in Settings and restart Emacs (not Termux or Bash).\nStarting Emacs with TZ set does explictly change the time(zone) for me, but setenv in Emacs doesn't seem to change anything for me regardless of whether I start Emacs with TZ set or not (getenv \"TZ\" gives me nil or the value of TZ in shell; it changes when I run setenv for \"TZ\" but current-time-zone and format-time-string \"%T %Z\" don't).\nP.S. Note that having TZ set will make the timezone in Termux static per a shell start.. \n@kaushalmodi @Neo-Oli . What I don't understand most is why we end up going \"Nordic\".. apt install grep, otherwise you'll be using busybox grep.. The thing is I get the logic of the behavior though (I think).\nFirst of all deleteFolder doesn't check whether the argument passed to it is a symlink.\nThen it goes check its children:\nif (child.getCanonicalFile().equals(child.getAbsoluteFile())) {\n                    deleteFolder(child);\n                } else {\n                    child.delete();\n                }\nAnd this is what happened:\n/data/data/com.termux/files/testdir/a\n/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/a\n/data/data/com.termux/files/testdir/b\n/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/b\nBut then even when the tests failed, it attempts to delete the child (the else clause). b didn't get deleted only because it's non-empty, otherwise it gets deleted as well.. By the way the idea of my example code is, always attempt to delete a file before traversing into (or listing, actually), and only do that if the deletion.failed. It should work unless something like this happens: it bumps into a symlink that can't be deleted, yet it can find files via it and delete them.\nIn any case I still oppose the idea of termux-setup-storage though. At least the part that it attempts to perform any form of deletion (why do we expect no one would put files under ~/storage before realizing it could get deleted by the app?). Not to mention the symlinks get created is IMHO a bit pointless. Can't we just have it print out the available storage paths?. Did you just release the ctrl press before you press right? Since long press on ctrl and alt stopped working since the new two-bar thing is introduced. I wish that would get fixed.. Actually it's probably even more proper if you do both the canonical vs absolute test and isDirectory in the outer if and no condition in the loop.. Oh never mind the permission has android:protectionLevel=\"signature|privileged\" in core/res/AndroidManifest.xml. Can you successfully access this site with your browser: http://termux.net/bootstrap/. You only fixed half of the OP. Fn+Left/Right were expected to be Home/End respectively.\nThough I am not sure if it's really our problem to fix anyway. While the modifications might sound sensible, I don't know if they are universal enough that it's fine to hard code them in the app.... Is it possible to use /data/data/com.termux/shared_prefs/com.termux_preferences.xml for this instead?. It's not really much harder, but yeah it might feel so (and out-of-comfort-zone).\nWell there are couple reasons (which might be a bit personal and may or may not be valid):\n1. Not a lover of dotfiles, especially when it's not even related to the shell or the \"terminal\", but rather the \"app\"\n2. The show extra key attribute makes use of that. Feels more consistent if they are in the same place. (Though you may argue that that can be moved instead...)\n3. Perhaps xml and/or the SharedPreference interface would makes it even more neat? Only a hunch though.. The file is created by the SharedPreference interface. I'm sure you have it in your Termux as well. That's a reason I think it is preferred, as it seems to be the orthodox one where you don't even need to deal with the path yourself.\nWhat I consider bad is that Termux has been making use of two different interfaces (android.content.SharedPreferences and java.util.Properties) in TermuxPreferences for different stuff. I am not sure there's any good reason doing so. That's why I think we should stop using one of them and ditch that completely one day.\nSemantically speaking I don't think we should put app settings (i.e. settings that has nothing to do with programs we uses in Termux or terminal emulation) anywhere under /data/data/com.termux/files but somewhere else (even directly) under /data/data/com.termux. And certainly we don't need to follow XDG specs (where ~/.config comes from) for that.. Just build your own Termux app with a different FILES_PATH?\nhttps://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/beb8a004e6ea64e2b3795fc9320da8c8b2e0a871/app/src/main/java/com/termux/app/TermuxService.java#L49\nNot sure how this can be dynamic.... > you will have to patch them all\nWhy not just rebuild all packages with the needed PREFIX then?. Better use getCanonicialPath and getAbsolutePath instead.. Here you only need to do isDirectory as the Canonical vs Absolute test will be perform in the deleteFolder call that follows..

I'm fairly certain this is due to the comment I posted here after the issue was closed CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE DEPENDENCIES: library \"libgnustl_shared.so\" not found #93\nAgain, my apologies. I segfaulted (= \n. Apologies. I know the issue is closed, however I do not believe it has been clearly resolved. Yes, the user may export the envar $LD_LIBRARY_PATH as root, export /system/bin +/- /system/xbin to $PATH for system binary support but these additions must be done each time the privileged user is invoked. \nNot so much a problem as it is an inconvenience, in Android - by default - /system/etc/mkshrc (from mksh, a port of ksh) sets the root env and mksh becomes the login shell upon invoking su. Depending on the device, ROM developers, the implementation is either rudimentary and dated or updated to more recent & mature code. For example, the mkshrc file on my LGG2 is bare bones by comparison to mkshrc in my N6 - both running custom 6.0.1. \nI've tried sourcing .bashrc to this file to extend the referenced paths and variables with a modicum of success. Yet, exiting to the regular user account and invoking su again voids all prior changes, including $LD_LIBRARY_PATH though it is referenced when running printenv as root.\nI'm unsure how to proceed. Should the .bashrc be copied to  /system/etc independently so the user can select his/her preferred login shell? If this is even possible, it takes Termux beyond its present scope. In the event Termux concedes to its users, the majority I estimate are root, passwd and PAM functionality should be deployed IMHO. At the very least, this would allow packages such as nmap, traceroute, ifconfig, et al. and their dependencies to be installed in the manner in which they are used by the privileged user.\nhttps://www.mirbsd.org/mksh.htm\nEDIT: Added URL \n. @ni554n I don't know how you typed the alias in ~/.bash_profile but it looks as though unneeded whitespace is appended after the =  sign, before the first quoting character '  in your example. I believe the shopt built-in has alias expansion, expand_aliases  on, by default but you can double-check by running shopt without any arguments. One other suggestion, if you want bash to read then run this aliased compound command automagically in the event upgrades are available, add -y  as the option to the second command before  the final quoting character. \nI should mention this chain does work  me under the same version of apt as you have installed. \nEDIT: Works when added in ~/.bash_profile\n. @GabrielGab JIC you're still having problems: each installation of Termux and any of its add-ons must be from the same source, i.e. install from F-Droid or Play Store. The apps cannot be mixed as they are signed with different keys. \n\nPresently running Termux + Termux:API (both via Play Store), fresh install of Android 7.0 + 6.0.1\non N6 and G2, respectively. apt update working w/o issue\n. +1 I'd like to see a \"lockdown\" option implemented as well. Outside of either a proot or systemless root scenario the integration (or a variation) of passwd together with its PAM-modules might be seen as merely symbolic. On the other hand, Termux provides nearly limitless capabilities; an excellent learning environment for nascent and seasoned users of the CLI. It stands to reason that one of the most fundamental parts of a Linux, e.g. its security suite (optional) would be included.. I don't really understand the problem. Most if not all Linux distributions create a standard home directory in the same way Termux does. 'Home' is user specific, thus if you create a variable named USERNAME and assign it a value, e.g. 'user2', that user's home directory will be sought under '~/home/user2' - which needs to be created with mkdir -p. \n\nYou may be thinking of termux-download which uses the Android system's downloader and stores dl'd files in '/cache' rather than the pwd from which that command is called.\nIn contrast, wget works from anywhere and unless directed otherwise on the cmd line, in an alias or a function, wget downloads into the pwd. \nExample:\n@localhost:\\~/storage/downloads$ alias wget\nalias wget=\"'wget --no-clobber --report-speed=bits -a '/data/data/com.termux/files/home/tmp/wget-log'\"\n@localhost:\\~/storage/downloads$ wget \"http://audio.ra.co/podcast/RA553_170102_Mark-Barrott-residentadvisor.net.mp3\"\n@localhost:~/storage/downloads$ ll *.mp3\n-rw-rw---- 1 root everybody 159M Jan  3 01:16 RA553_170102_Mark-Barrott-residentadvisor.net.mp3\n\n. \n",

Even after running termux-setup-storage on CM12.1, I still have issues with sudo when using simulated sdcard. For the sake of those struggling with this as well, I will document the problem and two possible solutions here.\nTHE PROBLEM\nI've noticed the following when working with files on my device's emulated sdcard:\n```\n$ touch /storage/emulated/0/test # works fine\n$ sudo touch /storage/emulated/0/test # gives \"No such file or directory\"\n$ touch /mnt/shell/emulated/0/test # gives \"Permission denied\"\n$ sudo touch /mnt/shell/emulated/0/test # works fine\n```\nThis creates the vexing situation where performing an operation on a file requires using a different path depending on whether or not the operation requires root (i.e., I need to use /storage/emulated/0/foo for non-root operation, but /mnt/shell/emulated/0/foo for root operation). \nI found two solutions to this problem.\nSOLUTION 1 (cleaner): Make /storage/emulated accessible to sudo\nIn st42's sudo script:\n```\nARGS=$(printf '%q ' \"$@\") # this line is already in the sudo script. keep it.\nadd this line:\nARGS=\"$(sed 's|/storage/emulated|/mnt/shell/emulated|g' <<< \"$ARGS\")\" \n```\nWith solution 1, an operation on /storage/emulated/0/test always works, sudo or not.\nSOLUTION 2 (hackier):  Give regular user permission for /mnt/shell/emulated\n1. Install the free software (apache 2.0) apk \"Universal Init.d\" (https://github.com/Androguide/Universal-init.d) to emulate init.d function, since init.d (boot-time scripts) is disabled in CM12.1. After installing, run the app and give it root permission when it asks for it. Make sure to flip the switch to \"on\".\n2. Create /system/etc/init.d/20shellfolderperms, put this in it:\nmount -o rw,remount /\nchmod 777 /mnt/shell\nmount -o ro,remount /\n3. Make 20shellfolderperms executable and reboot.\nWith solution 2, an operation on /mnt/shell/emulated/0/test always works, sudo or not.. Muhammad,\nI do not use node, but on any *nix (including termux/android) sudo only elevates privileges of the first command it encounters. For example, in\nsudo foo | bar\nFoo gets run as root but not bar. Something like this would have the expected effect:\nsudo bash -c \"foo | bar\"\nIf you share your actual command that's giving the permission error I might be able to help you write the command in a way that will work.\nOn March 30, 2017 6:15:13 AM EDT, Muhammad Sayuti notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nGot error when using termux-sudo by @st42  with node \n'env: can't execute 'node': Permission denied'\nis there any workaround ?\n\n.

I guess this makes sense because there is probably no way for Termux to decide what special symbol it should generate when Alt is used (although I wonder what xterm did).\nOn a PC/laptop, this is the desired behavior because the symbols generated by Alt are usually less commonly used and most people would want Meta aka Escape sequence to augment their control of the terminal. However this is not usually the case with a smaller keyboard on a mobile - the symbols in combination with Alt are usually very useful.\nFor the time being, I'm going to use a workaround which is binding my escape keys manually inside zsh/vim/other terminal apps. It seems to work, but it can be quite frustration because it essentially means I have to do the manual rebinding in each place where I would use Termux as an entry point - so not only my local terminal applications, but also when I ssh into my PC, for example.\nI'll leave this issue open for your/others' thoughts.

Hi Fredrik,\nthanks for the fixes! Works fine again.\nStill I'm a bit disappointed in getting only a 32 bit core system when the Processor and all is advertised as 64 bit.

You would have everything working.\nMay I know what do you want to achieve doing so?. You need not require big setup etc. You can do everything with a quick and simple one time setup.\nHere is my setup\n1. install openssh(ssh client and server package) in termux using below command\napt install openssh\n2. run sshd  - starts ssh server\nsshd\n3. add your computer ssh key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys(you can transfer the key using adb by creating a file using adb push or adb shell and then copying content from file manager app and paste or any other means like whatsapp(not so secure)). you can find your system key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nI personally like connecting to my mobile using wifi(wifi over adb or ssh directly with ip) - but here in your case as you like to do it via adb, you can port forward with this command \nadb forward tcp:8022 tcp:8022\nAll set and you can ssh into with command \nssh -p 8022 root@localhost\nhere use localhost if you did port forward else u can type the ip address of mobile if both computer and mobile are in same network.\n\nfrom now on, whenever you want to ssh, open termux in mobile and type sshd.  And then from laptop you can login either via portward using adb or wifi\nTip:  I installed termux shortcuts app which will show me scripts in a simple widget. So I created a file with 1 line content\nsshd\nand named it start ssh. Created another one with content\nkillall shhd\n and named it stop ssh\nSo now I can start/stop sshd with a single tap than opening termux and typing it in. . @Gia90 for \"In my case, I wanted to send command in the termux contest from a remote server with the least (possibly no) user interaction and client side configuration\"\nIn such case, I would use a twitter / telegram listening bot in termux. There are many of such scripts available online - you can try nodejs for the same (https://github.com/yagop/node-telegram-bot-api). So, just run them on termux and you can publish your messages from twitter / telegram. In case you dont want to use any 3rd party like twitter / telegram, create your own server in cloud, create your own server and write a client in termux that can listen to any commands from your server in cloud and execute commands in termux environment.. @verboze why not try scrcpy if you have a broken screen. It would help you get everything done.. @verboze you can try adb over wifi using command adb tcpip 5555 and after that, you can place your mobile in your bag and use it from computer.. :) with same scrcpy.

To fix the issue mentioned above, I executed su as follows:\nshell\nsu -l $(stat -c %u /data/data/com.termux) -c /data/data/com.termux/files/home/bin/termuxshell\n-l keeps the termux user environment, -c to execute the termux script.. > The necessary groups (like inet) are given dynamically on application start by Android OS. So, if you switched in ADB to Termux user, you probably won't have 'inet' group.\nIs there a way to assign this group while switching users? I've looked high and low, can't seem to come across a solution. My goal is to start sshd from the adb shell; I have a broken screen, so accessing the actual termux app is not an option for me :(. @sultanahamer I did NOT know about this tool! thanks a bunch, I'll give it a try!\nEdit: worked like a charm! Thanks for the tip sultanahamer!. ah awesome, thanks!. Already resolved in https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/792. Closing.. I agree with JacobTDC, the ADB port-forwarding solution assumes SSHD to already be running. What I am looking for is to start SSHD by sending an intent (in my case, my screen broke, SSHD was not running, and I need to start it to retrieve some data/execute some scripts. Sure some of it can be done via pure adb, but termux offers better tools for my needs).. Yeah, there are tons of good info on the wiki, I definitely recommend reading that in its entirety for any user new to Termux. That said, I can see why new users would be confused about where to find help. It's not obvious at first glance when downloading the app from the play store that there is a help menu when long-pressing. I think a better position for the link would be in the side swipe pane.. Fair enough. I only mention the side panel because a lot of apps use that panel to expose things like settings, help, etc; so it might be more familiar to new users, I think.

    "lotheac": "\nThe rare case where someone messes up the startup (as in exit 0 in ~/.profile) could be handled by having a separate shortcut to a failsafe session.\n\nThere's always ways to break things. kill $(cut -d' ' -f4 /proc/$$/stat) (kill parent of current process; written this way because this busybox's ps does not seem to do -p) is a way to just kill the entire termux app on startup, and I don't see a way to recover from having that in shell initialization, aside from a separate failsafe shortcut.. This is not specific to ssh, I was able to reproduce with just cat. Started seeing this today on my Nokia 8 after upgrading it from Android8 to Android9.\n$ ps -o tty,pid,comm\nTT     PID   COMMAND\n?      23551 cat\n136,1  23605 bash\n136,1  23754 ps\ncat doesn't seem to have a tty any more (terminating the termux session with the exit button took it away), but it's still running.. @xeffyr sorry, I was unclear. Repro steps for me are:\n\nstart termux (no sessions running)\nrun cat in this new tty\ngo to notification to hit the Exit button. termux notification disappears\nopen a new termux session, and run ps -o tty,pid,comm. Observe cat is still there.. Well, it happened with ssh for me first (as this issue describes), I just thought to try cat as another program. The parent shell for cat does not stick around (and I cannot reproduce the issue with another bash as a child of the initial one, as the only running process). actually it doesn't repro every time, so maybe this is a race somewhere.. @xeffyr I don't recall offhand what exactly termux is doing, but that's not necessarily what happens on any regular unix system. If the parent goes away then normally the child is just reparented to init. For example on debian 9:\ndebian9 ~ % pstree -spa 3202\nsystemd,1 --system --deserialize 21\n  \u2514\u2500sshd,672 -D\n      \u2514\u2500sshd,3167  \n          \u2514\u2500sshd,3176   \n              \u2514\u2500zsh,3177\n                  \u2514\u2500bash,3190\n                      \u2514\u2500cat,3202\ndebian9 ~ % kill -KILL 3190\ndebian9 ~ % pstree -spa 3202\nsystemd,1 --system --deserialize 21\n  \u2514\u2500cat,3202\n\nSo I think termux should deliver the signal to the entire process group/session, not just the session leader, if it's not already doing that.. But when you hit the 'Exit' key in the notification, and then look at the task switcher's screenshot of the process, you can see text [Process completed (signal 9 - press Enter]. So something is delivering SIGKILL.. It's another matter though why the cat doesn't subsequently get an error for its blocking read() on stdin, if the tty stops existing. Could very well be a bug in Android.. ",

It worked after uncommenting that locale on the server in /etc/locale.gen and running locale-gen. Both server and laptop are Arch Linux. As I understand, termux runs with US-ASCII (mosh error message).\nRelevant envs on laptop:\nLANG=de_DE.utf8\nLC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_NUMERIC=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8\non server:\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLC_MESSAGES=C\nLet me know, if you need anything else.\n. I was researching a bit and found this workaround, which seems to work:\nmosh remotehost --server=\"LANG=$LANG mosh-server\"\n. @fornwall you are right, my Termux does show LANG=en_US.UTF-8 in env. (I didn't change anything in Termux other than installing pacakges so far). \nI am starting to think, that is a mosh (or ssh) issue.

So its using armel except bionic libc android uses is not glibc.. termux-fix-shebang is a script that will fix the shebang...\n. Its more we don't have acess to chromeos for testing and its likely its the implementation of amdroid apps in chromeos that causes this. Recommendation is setup sshd in termux amd connect to it using ssh client in chromeos. . Install libxslt-dev\n and zlib-dev is in ndk-sysroot package\nAnyway stuff about termux-packages belongs in github.com/termux/termux-packages . It is an android restriction. Doing same command in termux $HOME will work. . you have to move files to /sdcard at which point the files aren't marked by selinux. Then mv them back to where you need them. . This issue belongs in termux-packages regardless the error you are seeing concerns /usr/bin/env that doesn't exist in android. run the command termux-fix-shebangs ~/.pyenv/bin/pyenv and it should make the shebang execute a version of env that does exist...\n. that permission is in termux-api. Is that not enough?. Its because my repo doesn't have an \"all\" section.. i will sort it out tommorow.  . I honestly have no idea. I can't reproduce it. . Wait i just had an idea.  i will upload a newer version of apt see if it fails or i might even have to ask you to use gdb.

Using a different encryption library may fix it. . you have to re add my key apt-key add pointless.gpg . You are literally the only person with this issue i have seen. i will have a chat with fornwall about it though. . No termux has a lib libandroid-glob which implements that. Its just not enabled in ffmpeg. . it would require recompiling ffmpeg and figuring out how to enable it. I don't how to enable it so for now you are out of luck. . I think its also possible that there is a 64bit kernel and some 64 bit stuff but most of the rom is 32bit and it only installs  native 32bit if i remember correctly.   I have never actally dealt with a rom like that myself.  . if you have moved files around with root this triggers selinux security.\nThe way around it is to copy files that aren't working (can be done as root) to a directory /sdcard/.\nThis is the the shared storage that all android apps can use and see. When you copy it there android will change date and ownership etc.\nOnce that is done copy it back from that directory to your termux directory and it will be fine. . Known issue. \nhttps://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2066.

It does seem to be a bug in busybox (see the link provided by fornwall above).

If open faiils, the destination is unlink:ed and then open:ed again. This means there is a difference in behaviour if the destination is a symlink! Busybox dev's made a long argument about the security risks with the O_EXCL and the symlink. (See the file libbb/copy_file.c and the FEATURE_NON_POSIX_CP in Busybox if you want to check the code yourself).\nI must confess I only did a code review and testing on x86/Linux, not actually on Android. So maybe there is a caveat there, but I think it is worth trying.\nBtw, from the comments in Busybox it seems that coreutils cp follow the Posix definition (using O_EXCL) but have a longoption --remove-destination to unlink the destination before copying.\nObviously the bug should be fixed in Busybox to stat (or similar) and ask BEFORE trying open, so a change in the config should be considered a workaround\n.

I haven't had it happen when running on battery and actively using the device, including running multiple apps at the same time, etc. I have no idea what the connection is. Disabling the system app power monitoring service and adding Termux to the whitelist makes no difference.\nAnd what's odd is that when after this happens and I come back and restart Termux, it then often crashes when I try to open the extra keys view (Volume Up+Q). I'm not sure if my issue is exactly the same as the original described one, but in my case the only time I've seen Termux unexpectedly quit was when I left my device to charge fully; and this behavior is pretty consistent. I haven't been able to catch exactly when the quit happens, though. It's not immediately but seems to be either after some time of charging like an hour or two, or perhaps even around the time the battery reaches full.\nI don't have a rooted device, but I do seem to be able to access logcat from ADB (but not dmesg). Maybe next time I'll try to see if any clues show up.. I can confirm this issue. This seems to have only become an issue when the extra keys thing was revamped and changed to two rows. Older versions of Termux did not have this problem.\nThis behavior makes the input view virtually unusable because there is no way (that I can find) to swipe the extra keys without sending a spurious keypress to the terminal, thereby messing up the state I need to begin text input in the first place..

If you want to be able to handle incoming Intents then you would need to update the app manifest file (AndroidManifest.xml) for Termux to add the right intent filters, as well as have some way for Termux to pass those Intents on to your script.\nI don't see a way of doing what you're asking for as of now but such a feature might be possible to implement.\n.

    "JonasT": "@fornwall I use reset in gnome-terminal all the time to clear scrollback before lengthy output so I can find it's beginning, because sometimes pagers break (e.g. I was told in IRC that the pager less was supposed to properly touch scroll but for me it just didn't, making it a bit of a pain to use compared to plain output) and they're not as straightforward (for someone not using them all the time) to add additional different commands without losing the old output of the previous program to scroll through. It is one of the main reasons I find debugging in termux/android a bit painful compared to desktop despite having a relatively large screen & bluetooth keyboard - the other reason being that termux scrollback appears to be hardcoded to not long enough for various types of output to scroll through. Since the wiki is quite lacking on this and suggests to just run restorecon which doesn't work from a normal termux shell, here is what to do on a rooted device to fix the SELinux context of a file (or do anything else that needs the proper SELinux tools around & working):\n\nOpen termux\nGet root with tsu\nUse this command to get a proper rooted system shell (the native shell with the SELinux tools, not termux):\n   env -i USER=root \"$(PATH=/system/xbin:/system/bin:/su/bin:/sbin:/magisk/.core/bin which su)\" root --context u:r:shell:s0 --shell /system/bin/sh --command sh\n\n(if your device wasn't rooted with magisk, some paths may need to be adjusted)\n\nInside the system shell, cd to the directory with your file with wrong permissions\nNow you can use restorecon -v <affectedfile>. Don't forget to check the result with ls -lZa and also fix the owner & permissions as necessary with chown and chmod! (e.g. if this is a file that should be used by another app located in that app's folder of which you messed up the permissions, then it needs to be owned by that app and read/executable or whatever the app requires on access). @Grimler91 for what it's worth, I think this would be worth fixing - I just ran into the same issue, trying to debug an app not launched from inside termux (not a system app, but it runs separately). And setting the path manually is quite a lot to type on a touchscreen :cry: lol\n\nEdit: nevermind, I used su instead of tsu -e. :fearful: oops. Sorry, I filed this in the wrong repo. I refiled here now: https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2733. There really should be a graphical close button. All terminals on the desktop have it as well.\nAlso, doesn't CTRL+D actually do something different in SSH sessions? (like, actually transmit that and process it server-side e.g. inside screen, instead of just closing the connection) But even if it doesn't, please add a close button. Not having one is just not very intuitive.. Ok, yeah, that name would sound a lot more clear. However, it's still a bit hidden - why not put a close button on the side drawer? It works like a tab bar in most apps really, so I'm quite sure that's where a lot of people will look first if they ever use more than one session and want to stop just one of them. That is okay though, because everyone opening more than one session will notice the drawer exists I think. And for the others, the notifications \"Exit\" works just fine since they don't have more than one session open anyway. @xeffyr I also noticed recently that the menu on Android devices without hardware menu button is only available through the long-press select popup > \"More...\", but the long-press popup disappears instantly  for me when the text changes (e.g. scrolling further in a screen). This makes the menu effectively inaccessible for sessions with things going on, which means there really should be another way of closing the current tab. Just adds IMHO another good reason to just add a close symbol to the tab bar on the left. is it only me or does reset not work properly to actually clear the scrollback? because for me it doesn't, I can still scroll up further which is a tad annoying\nEdit: just checked back with chat, apparently it doesn't made a ticket here: #951 . Is this the same issue/would this fix reset not doing that? :grimacing: I don't know enough about terminals... if it is, feel free to close my ticket.

See more shortcuts here: https://termux.com/hardware-keyboard.html. Or don't use the -a flag, so rsync won't try to set those properties.. ps limits the output to the terminal width, so it cuts of long lines. Though, this should only happen when it prints directly to a terminal, and not when you pipe the result to something. This works for me, so I can't reproduce the problem either. But I would guess that it's more likely a problem with this detection in ps, than a problem with grep. You could check if the result from ps x | cat is cut off to confirm it.. Volume up isn't an alt key in Termux. According to the key bindings, it's used for lots of things, only a few of them is as an alt key.. How would you replace the other functions that volume up+key has now, if it should only act as an alt key?. It is configurable now, so this issue can be closed. Seems like it isn't documented yet though.\nYou can configure it by setting extra-keys in ~/.termux/termux.properties. For the old keys, set this:\nextra-keys = [[\"ESC\", \"/\", \"-\", \"HOME\", \"UP\", \"END\", \"PGUP\"], [\"TAB\", \"CTRL\", \"ALT\", \"LEFT\", \"DOWN\", \"RIGHT\", \"PGDN\"]]. You can change it the same way as in other terminal emulators, by sending escape codes. It doesn't seem to support blinking cursors, but it supports block, underline and bar. I.e.\necho -e '\\e[2 q' # Change to block\necho -e '\\e[4 q' # Change to underline\necho -e '\\e[6 q' # Change to bar. This icon is very similar to the ConnectBot icon though. It would probably be better to keep the block, rather than change it to >_.. Termux already has this. Press Volume up + q to enable it.. I'm not running tmux on my phone, only on the server. On the phone, I'm just using the ssh command.\nI tried running ps after exiting Termux with an ssh-session, and I can see that the ssh command is still running.. @xeffyr: Yeah, it's only a problem on some phones/OS versions apparently. I didn't have this problem on my Nexus 4 or Nexus 5X with Android 8, but it is a problem on Pixel 3 with Android 9.. Yes, it happens with other programs, e.g. cat and sleep for me too. I guess the reason it doesn't happen with bash is that bash probably exits when it looses the terminal, since it's an interactive process.\nI've never experienced it not happening, it seems to happen every time for me.\nIf I close Termux from the app switcher after I press Exit from the notifications, the processes are killed, but not before. I.e. I have to first press Exit, then close Termux from the app drawer. If I only do one of those things, the processes persist.. Huh, why does Termux send SIGKILL? Shouldn't the SIGHUP you mentioned suffice? That explains why my bash history hasn't always been saved (separate issue though).\n\nRunning killall -9 bash terminates all processes including running \"cat\".\n\nThis also happens for me, but if I run sleep 100 instead of cat, it persists.. > If I replace SIGKILL with SIGHUP, nothing changes. Bash stopped as it should, but \"cat\" left in background.\nYes, same for me. It's unrelated to this issue, so sorry for bringing it up here.\n\nI'll look on replacing kill signal with hup, if no bad effects a pull request will be submitted.\n\nThanks\n\nWith jackpal's androidterm things even worse than with Termux - shells are not terminated\n\nHow did you test this? I tried, but ps in that app only shows me processes from the same window, so I can't see if the processes are still running.. Ah, thanks. Yeah, they persist here too with that app.. There already is an option to disable it: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Touch_Keyboard#Extra_Keys_Row. It is in the docs. From the page I linked to:\n\nTo enable the extra keys view you have to long tap on the keyboard button in the left drawer menu. You can also press Volume Up+Q or Volume Up+K.. There was a large discussion surrounding this in #56. That was closed because the message now only appears for the last terminal session, but as several people pointed out there, that doesn't really solve the issue.\n\nThe only real reason I've seen for keeping it is that you need some way to open a fallback session if you break the shell. This could be solved with adding a shortcut for opening a fallback session (at least for Android >= 7.1 where shortcuts were introduced).\nHaving the terminal stay open to read some info, like your example of termux-battery-status can easily be done by ending the script with the read command, and doesn't need this message from Termux.\nSo my opinion is to just remove the message for Android >= 7.1, but that seems to be a controversial move. Alternatively, add an option for disabling it, or only disable it for widgets (or both).. @xeffyr: This is not only an issue for background widgets. I for example have a widget for launching ssh to my irc client. After I disconnect, I would like Termux to disappear, without having to press enter.. ",

From the tests I've made it seems that the reason why Termux behaves differently with different fonts depends on whether or not the font contains the right-to-left charset. Because Gnu FreeFont contains Hebrew, Arabic, Hindi and so forth right to left charsets, Termux displays them right to left, but when the cursor is on a line with such scripts it gets completely messed up.\nWhen I use a font without Hebrew glyphs, Termux displays everything left-to-right. The Hebrew letters to my understanding, are displayed from whatever supplamental font is defined by the OS, which I think is NotoSansHeb or something, and it looks terrible on the screen. However in programs with built-in bidi support, namely emacs, the bidi support works (except for the font looking terrible) when the fonts with the missing hebrew script is used. when Liberation mono or freefont is used, the text still gets all messed up in emacs.. @fornwall I think that I have an idea of what might be going on in the code. in \"TerminalRenderer.java\" there is an object \"mTextPaint\" which to my understanding  reders the text on the screen. I think that the method \"setTextDirection\" should be set to 'anyRtl' (=2):\nmTextPaint.setTextDirection(2)  or to disable rtl completely in case this doesn't work set the value to 'ltr'.\nfor reference:\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:textDirection\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setTextDirection(int).

In Android O, access is denied to /proc entries making these tools completely broken.  See the report output, this is not an issue on Nougat.. Looks like a permission request issue to me.   My guess is O exposes some new permission schemes that needed to be adapted to.   . Here's the background on what's going on with this:\nhttps://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/07/seccomp-filter-in-android-o.html\nOf course, Google in their infinite wisdom gives no opt-in work around besides flashing a custom kernel which does not have seccomp.  . @Alexander-- That information was based on digging from XDA which led me to the Android developer blog on the subject.  \nFrom the linked Article: \n\"Android O includes a single seccomp filter installed into zygote, the process from which all the Android applications are derived. Because the filter is installed into zygote\u2014and therefore all apps\u2014the Android security team took extra caution to not break existing apps. The seccomp filter allows:\nall the syscalls exposed via bionic (the C runtime for Android). These are defined in bionic/libc/SYSCALLS.TXT.\nsyscalls to allow Android to boot\nsyscalls used by popular Android applications, as determined by running Google's full app compatibility suite\nAndroid O's seccomp filter blocks certain syscalls, such as swapon/swapoff, which have been implicated in some security attacks, and the key control syscalls, which are not useful to apps. In total, the filter blocks 17 of 271 syscalls in arm64 and 70 of 364 in arm.\"\nHow did you manage to turn SELinux off with out root?  Reason I say that is root -should- be allowed to to /proc even with seccomp enabled.   The test would be access to /proc with out root.   I still think Google should've found a way to disable with developer options. \n@kstoykov - You have two choices.  1 - Root, 2 - Install a kernel that does not have seccomp. Ok so I think what we need a good list of what works and doesn't with just SELinux in permissive or disabled.   \n@Alexander-- What ROM/device? I'd love to try it, I'm on a Pixel XL stock. \nAnother thing to remember is that some of these tools make system calls as well as read /proc.   With out looking at the ps/top/htop code I am not sure to what extent. . ",

    "h6y3": "I think the issue I just filed may be related to this #414.  In my case, I use RVM with termux and the script calls ps. ",
    "Alexander--": "@jwhipp I don't think, that this has anything to do with seccomp. I just checked, and switching SELinux mode to permissive allowed me to view /proc/ contents without restrictions (aside, of course, from restrictions of hidepid).\nSeccomp is commonly used to ban entire system calls, which should be of no interest to apps. Seccomp rules can be used to dynamically sandbox specific system calls by combining it with ptrace, but doing so is more computationally expensive and less robust, compared to SELinux rules. I doubt, that seccomp might be used for securing individual directories by Android developers or anyone else, when they have SELinux.. @jwhipp \n\nReason I say that is root -should- be allowed to to /proc even with seccomp enabled.\n\nIndeed, daemonsu gets started during early boot by init, so it does not suffer from seccomp restrictions, imposed upon Zygote-based apps. But I specifically tested without root (I used root to disable SELinux, then checked from ordinary UID).\nThe article you linked to has no indication that seccomp has any bearing on /proc. Virtual /proc files aren't \"system calls\", they are part of virtual filesystem (procfs). And filesystem files are traditionally secured via SELinux. The issue is not entirely clear until someone looks up relevant SELinux rules, but I am going to stay by my opinion for now.. @kstoykov  \nYup, they have totally gone nuts with curtailing access to /proc contents. Even /proc/filesystems is restricted (no idea what kinds of leaks they are trying to prevent that way). Only bare minimum, required for existing AOSP code, was kept. Of course, since they have chosen a whitelist approach, the possibility of people using new /proc APIs in future is also reduced... They are effectively abandoning practical Linux compatibility.\n@jwhipp \ntry with Android emulator (no idea if setenforce still works on physical Android devices).\nYou can gain some insight into specific restrictions even without viewing SELinux rules, just run\nls -Z /proc/\n\nvia adb (-Z enables display of SELinux metadata). This gives quite clear view of what is still usable.. This can be accomplished by using Android Binder IPC to interact between client app and Termux process. Basically, the client app would have to call into AIDL interface, provided by Termux, and Termux would perform actions (running commands etc.) on it's behalf. The client app would be able to receive InputStream/OutputStream of executed command (by passing file descriptors via Binder) and use Termux AIDL API to control the command (such as send signals to it).\n@fornwall I can come up with PR if you are interested in implementing something like that.. @EdwardIrby in case you weren't aware, such library already exists (but for different terminal emulator): https://github.com/jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator/tree/master/emulatorview.. @linamgr you'd need to modify Termux app for that. Or better yet, forget about Termux and integrate a terminal emulator library in your app (such as ATE library I linked above).. @linamgr sorry, I don't have any. You might have better luck asking for advice on thematic forums, instead of this issue.. @vovcacik I suspect that this is by design.\nYou are not trying to run those executables in root terminal, are you? Linux capabilities (and suid-bit) do not have effect when interacted with by ordinary Android apps, because Android JVM process (zygote) uses PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS prctl flag to disable them before running any app code (see man prctl). This means, that ordinary processes (such as Termux UID) can not elevate themselves by using execve (neither with suid, nor with file-caps or SELinux file attributes).\nThis is the same reason, why rooting Android devices has become a lot harder around KitKat \u2014 you can no longer use suid su binary to trivially escape sandbox. Modern Android su binaries are actually non-suid client executables, that connect to separate daemon (google for \"daemon-su\"), running in background since early boot. Soon after system boot most processes castrate themselves with PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, so they and their children no longer can escalate privileges.. @vovcacik if you already have root, you are better off just starting non-root su shell with Termux UID. This way you will be able to use Termux normally, but without PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, seccomp and other similar restrictions, \u2014 as explained above, su processes are specifically started in way, that escapes those restrictions. You will be able to view full contents of /proc, use strace and take advantage of file capabilities without switching to UID 0.\nIf you have rooted device, there is no reason not to do so.. @vovcacik I believe, that I understood you perfectly.\nAs I said, try to use su to switch to Termux user:\n\nGet UID of Termux package:\n\n````\nstat /data/data/com.termux/\nFile: /data/data/com.termux/\n  Size: 4096            Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   directory\nDevice: 10300h/66304d   Inode: 621526      Links: 5\nAccess: (0751/drwxr-x--x)  Uid: (10146/ u0_a146)   Gid: (10146/ u0_a146)\nAccess: 2017-09-08 17:05:27.000000000\nModify: 2017-09-08 17:10:32.000000000\nChange: 2017-09-08 17:10:32.000000000\n````\n^ Note the value of \"Uid\" column: 10146\n\nUse su to switch to that UID:\n\n````\nsu --preserve-environment -cn u:r:untrusted_app:s0 -- 10146\n$ id\nuid=10146(u0_a146) gid=10146(u0_a146) context=u:r:untrusted_app:s0\n````\nFile capabilities should work in that shell.. @vovcacik \n\nIs it possible linux is missing a library and hence can't detect capabilities set on files?\n\nThis can not happen, \u2014 file capabilities are kernel feature\n\nI haven't really tried sshd since it reports missing library\n\nMy bad, I have forgotten, that su resets environment variables.

Since it hasn't been mentioned why it was removed, here's the commit\nRemove the fullscreen setting\nTrying to use fullscreen doesn't work well in a multi-windowed world\nand makes using translucent navigation and status bars more complicated.\n\nBTW in playing around with the source/resources, I found a base of LinearLayout (instead of RelativeLayout), did give a kind of fullscreen, on a 5.1 (Lollipop) phone. The status at top and soft Android keys (home, back etc) remained but were translucent. And it remained fullscreen with the onscreen keyboard - i.e. so half the screen was obscured by the keyboard.. The big problem is that vim does not recognize any terminal escape codes for <ScrollWheelLeft> and <ScrollWheelRight>. X11 and xterm standards lack them.  More detail: What key presses/escape codes does vim expect for <ScrollWheelLeft> and <ScrollWheelRight>?). Only the GUI version of vim has them (generated directly from the mouse button without escape codes, since gvim doesn't use a terminal).\nAn alternative is to make up some escape sequences, generate them from termux, and add mappings in vim to interpret them as <ScrollWheelLeft> and <ScrollWheelRight> (:help xterm-mouse-wheel)\nBut of course this won't just work\u2122 because it requires users adding mappings. OTOH, these could be added to the termux's default .vimrc (which already has mappings for <ScrollWheelUp> and <ScrollWheelDown>), and also... users need to :set nowrap for horizontal scrolling to work anyway, so maybe it's not too bad? \nWhat do you think? @factavi\nEDIT Workaround to touch scroll already: vim moves the cursor to where you tap (not swipe); tapping on the right edge of the screen (on a line that is too long to fit on one line, and :set nowrap), makes vim scroll left.. @Factavi By modifying termux, mostly TerminalView.java. There's a chain of calls.\nAs a simple test, I made up/down swipes cause a scroll left/right, by making termux send different escape sequences that are mapped to horizontal scrolls in vim.\nThis was a few weeks ago, and it would take a while to get back to it.\nBTW I also noticed less can be made to scroll left/right, when the terminal is too narrow.. I hacked a proof-of-concept here, but it's only for vim (and tedious to set up).. Thanks @empjustine  and @xeffyr\nRegarding screen size changes, tmux already copes with this. Try it with tmux in one window and tmux attach in another, so they share the same tmux session. Now, pinch-together (or control alt -) to shrink the font and increase the rows and columns. tmux adapts by marking the edge of the usable screen. You can also rotate. Also, turn off the onscreen keyboard.\n(This particular demonstration only works when making the terminal bigger i.e. more rows and/or cols. The tmux not in the foreground isn't told of changes, so keeps the old smaller size).\nThe other issue of input from the other display could be solved by only the main display accepting input, and the other is display-only. This is how my hack-of-concept works above. The other display would just show the text that has been scrolled off. This would work for many unix-stream based tools, though need special synchronization if they jump around e.g. search in less, more, man. And not for anything ncursesed,\nI agree it seems complicated and tricky.\nI believe ssh and tmux (or screen) can't cast the bottom half of the display. (Only the whole display, as I use in a hack-of-concept above). I'd love to be wrong though, please tell me how, if I am!\nHowever, it's looking more appropriate to do this idea of x-windows-like multi-display text terminals  in tmux - text-windows, if you will.. Can also change colour:\necho -ne \"\\033]12;#ff0000\\007\"    # red. Definitely natural for touchscreens.\n\nI looked into this (for vim in termux) https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/751 But there is a lack of standard terminal escape sequences for horizontal scroll. Vim's horizontal scrolling is hardwired for Windows - doesn't use escape sequences. You can add a mapping for them, but they're not standard.\nI got some test code working (and also, something that worked for less).\n\ndisabling terminal autowrap\n\nHow do you do that?\nI see for bash there's set horizontal-scroll-mode On (in .inputrc), but that's only for typing at the command line (and not, eg cating a file).\n\nthe other terminal emulators had extra buttons for swiping\n\nHaven't seen this. Links please?\n. Not sure, but looks like autowrap off doesn't store the offscreen characters, but replace them (at least, for \"graphic characters\"). If so, this would need to change for scrolling to work:\n\nIf the DECAWM function is reset, then graphic characters received when the cursor is at the right border of the page replace characters already on the page. https://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECAWM\n\nThe above also appears in the termux source (https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/c80e126b8fc07e8c322bba4c1f277086a962f81f/terminal-emulator/src/main/java/com/termux/terminal/TerminalEmulator.java). Had a quick scan, but not clear to me whether offscreen characters are ever stored rather than replaced.\nSome interesting possibilities open up if the logical screen can be bigger than the physical screen.\n. It seems a fairly fundamental change, and might affect several other parts of the codebase.\n@fornwall what do you think of making the logical screen wider than the physical screen, to enable horizontal scrolling (especially for small screens)?. No.\nHave a look at terminal IDE.  It's a great effort, and comes with several tools - but binaries are not adapted to the android filesystem, so e.g. domain name lookups don't work automatically. There's (clumsy) workarounds.\nMaybe, you could copy specific execuables across, from termux installed on a later device?  I don't know how different 4.4.2 is, for whether this would work.... @its-pointless (not OP) termux-wake-lock doesn't work (nor sliding down on the termux notification to reveal the exit and acquire wakelock buttons).\nTo be clear, the display turns off, but termux seems to keep running. e.g. set (android settings) display sleep to 15sec, the following starts just as the display turns off, and and keeps running (e.g. if I turn it back on after 20sec, it's printed 20 lines)\n$ sleep 15; for i in {1..60} ; do echo $i; sleep 1; done\nIt might just be android 5.1 (or Huawei EMUI), that the display timeout overrides any wakelock.\nIt would be nice if termux could keep the display on.\nA workaround is to just set sleep at max (30 minutes).

Changed, tested and working fine.. @fornwall Please can you take a look one more time?\nI hope it's changed as you have suggested.. This PR is still open thus not merged to the code base.\nIt still merges cleanly so your only option in order to try this out is to rebuild termux on your own either using Android studio or gradle directly cherrypicking this patch.. I'll be able to use and integrate this code snipped in a week or so. I'm sure something like this is doable.. @fornwall I apologize for another delay. I have tested your suggestion on my devices and it's working fine over here. Hopefully I've got it right.\nI can imagine a few more improvements to the TerminalView accessibility support however I am not sure I am able to implement them.\n It would be nice to sent out AccessibilityEvent.TYPE_VIEW_SCROLLED when scrolling the view so we know how much content there is displayed in the view.\n Currently we are exposing the whole view similar to a text view. We set the text retrieved from the visible content as an accessible description and we are using screen reader features to navigate over that. We might consider implementing our own AccessibilityNodeInfo representing each line seperately. That would enable screen reader users to use their fingers to explore individual lines on the screen. This might then be further enhanced by implementing custom accessibility actions for example allowing screen reader users to select and copy parts of the text from the TerminalView.\n* There is one major disadvantage with the current approach I have taken in regard to TerminalView accessibility and I am unable to come up with a better plan. However we need to be able to somehow expose the caret control where it makes sense. We can type, but screen readers can't detect where the caret is pointing to. For simple commands it's all right but for more complex commands and when using text editors, ncurses apps and similar pseudo UI equivalent interfaces accessibility support with the caret handling is not very usefull.\nPerhaps there is more however these are things I can imagine being either critical for the comfortable usage of the app or easy or moderate to implement..

I can work around the issue as suggested in #398 by putting /system/lib64 ahead of the Termux shared library directory:\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/system/lib64:/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib\nBut this results in a paradox.  Since many Termux libraries and system libraries share the same names, the resulting collision causes Termux executables to use the system libraries that don't have dependencies required by the Termux executables.  Even apt doesn't work.  This also affects the termux-sudo package.\nNone of this was a problem on Android M, presumably because the system binaries had fewer dependencies that were fulfilled by the Termux libraries.  In the meanwhile though, I am constantly changing my LD_LIBRARY_PATH, depending on whether I am trying to run a Termux binary or a system binary.

    "setuidroot": "I understand the feature you are asking for and I also think it'd be a cool addition.  While you could probably add it in yourself (given a rooted phone and some bash scripting.) I just wanted to tell you how I personally do this hoping it may help some people...\nAs an example in your screenshot, just click and and hold the \"download\" button and then click \"copy link address\" in the pop-up prompt.  Then open termux and do: wget (paste address/Cntl+Alt+V on hacker's keryboard landscape mode.)\nThis is an easy way to use termux to download files... I do it all the time b/c termux is far more reliable a downloader and I believe if you lose network for a second (like switching AP around a home WiFi does annoyingly on some phones) the download will continue where it left off as opposed to leaving half a downloaded file in storage and making you start all over again :/\nAlso tmux downloads the file to it's internal data path if youless you specify otherwise.  I just use: 'mv downloaded.file /sdcard/Download' (no quotes) to move it to my regular downloads folder when it's done.. Yeah you can change colors/fonts with termux-styling.  Also... if/when termux hangs, just exit out and force close termux in tasker.  If the termux notification persists, you can slide down on it and click exit.\nTermux also has ssh capabilities built in.  \"apt install openssh\" and then you can just use termux like Juice (but without the GUI) \"ssh root@10.0.0.10\" as an example.  You can add private SSH keys into /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.ssh\nJuice is cool, but not needed IMO; almost everything can be done in termux.. Volume down key is control (for me)... so say control+c; hold volume down and hit c key.  \nI highly recommend hackers keyboard... it has ctl, alt, fn, etc keys like a real keyboard when you use it in horizontal/landscape mode.  Info about it here: https://github.com/klausw/hackerskeyboard\nHackers keyboard is old and not on Google Play anymore (idk why) but it's on github; latest version APK you can download here: https://github.com/klausw/hackerskeyboard/releases/download/1.39.3/hackerskeyboard-v1.39.3.apk\nIt works on pretty much every android device (at least every one I've used; Android 2-8.)\nThere's another keyboard that's good for this, it's newer and kept up-to-date, but I don't use it personally.  It's called AnySoftKeyboard...\nInfo: https://github.com/AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard/blob/master/README.md\nDownload: https://f-droid.org/repo/com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard_4630.apk\nI highly recommend one of these keyboards for any terminal work (something with arrow keys, ctl, alt and various options to assign key functions.)  Hackers keyboard works great for me, but AnySoft is newer and kept up-to-date; maybe you'd be better off starting out/learning with AnySoftKeyboard since it's actively maintained.\n. Are you still having this issue?  What root management app are you using?  (Magisk, SuperSU... hopefully not KingRoot, etc.)\nFirst of all there is no \"sudo\" command in Android... unless you put it in the system yourself, but even then it doesn't work well with Android.  The command to go to root is just \"su\"  You can pass commands to root (say you want to view all networking processes with netstat) using \"su -c netstat -tuepa\" \nI'm assuming you installed tsu and have upgraded your packages in Termux (apt install tsu && apt update -y && apt upgrade -y) \nInvoking su should give you a root shell on the phone, but without access to Tmux packages (that's what tsu is for.)  If su says permission denied, then your root control app isn't allowing root access to Termux.  I recommend Magisk... it's open source, kept up-to-date and easily flashed from recovery (like TWRP.)\nAre you on old Android \u22645?  If so, tsu has issues with LD_LIBRARY_PATH; but su will always work if you have correctly rooted your device.  I'm betting your root management app is not allowing termux root access... if you're using KingRoot, they block termux to make it harder for you to remove kingroot (as it's spyware.)  Check your root management app to make sure it isn't kingroot and is allowing Termux root access.. @xeffyr I should have been more clear in my post, I just didn't want to make it too long.  I should have added in that you should NEVER update/upgrade or do any apt/dpkg package management whilst running as root.  This will screw everything up as far as ownership.  Generally I've fixed this with chown -R (tmuxuser) /data/data/com.termux/files/usr.  But I should have said not to run apt as root.  I just assumed that @inzamamraja couldn't get root access at all.\nAs far as SELinux... that gets messy.  You can disable it, like you said; but I wouldn't normally recommend people run without SELinux unless they really know what they're doing.  That opens the possibly for any app to gain access outside of it's allowed permissions.  I've never run into termux issues with SELinux unless doing things like packet sniffing/injection.  But I realize this is highly device and OS dependent.  \nI wasn't aware termux doesn't work on android less than 5 (I dont have any devices less than 5.)  I have a bootloader locked galaxy s5 running android 5 that has issues with tsu and LD_LIBRARY_PATH; Grimler91 has some good insight on that here:  https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/2047\nI don't know what OP's issue is... if he can get root with su, but not tsu?  Or no root at all?  If he replies with more info maybe we can help him further.  Either way, I appreciate all you guys that contribute so much to termux :). I don't understand the question really... need more info.  But if I get the gist of what you're referring to, you are trying to edit a file in /sdcard/Download with termux?  Termux starts in directory path /data/data/com.termux/files/home   This is totally different than files on device sdcard (internal storage, not external sdcard.)  \nMaybe change directory to the path of the file you want to edit?  Like: cd /sdcard/Download  ; ls -a (find file to edit) ; nano filetoedit.txt \nThe answer is yes, termux can edit source code/txt files like (but better than IMO) other text editors.  Nano or vi are good tmux editors.  . ",

If that's all it does, then obviously it's dying when requesting the permission, so manually granting and symlinking is a valid workaround.\nBut my fear is that it's actually at least three steps: (1) ask for permission, (2) something very important that you won't notice is missing right away, (3) create the symlinks.

Mea culpa.\n\nThough I am not sure if it's really our problem to fix anyway. While\nthey might sound sensible, I don't know if they are universal enough\nthat it's fine to hard code them in the app...\n\nI'm not sure about that either, but we're kind of stuck here on this device. My alternative fix is to make a hack at the Linux keyboard driver level and report physical page up and page down presses when\ndetecting the key combo, but that's not right too - the driver should simply report the scan code, and do not any interpretation, I guess.\nThe reason I think fixing in termux might be ok is because a number of other applications are reported to register pageup/pagedown properly with thes key combos. The page up and page down keys seem to be a bit\nneglegted in Android anyway, since not much devices are equipped with a physical keyboard. I found these comments in KeyHandler.java:\n// Note that KEYCODE_HOME is handled by the system and never delivered to applications.\n  // On a Logitech k810 keyboard KEYCODE_MOVE_HOME is sent by FN+LeftArrow.\nso there seems to be something similar going on on the k810 keyboard.\nI will follow your advice here: if you think this should not go in Termux, I'll drop the pull request and go have a beer. If you are willing to take it in, I'll make sure to add home/end as well - which is trivial, of course.\nI hope for the latter, of course. The Gemini is a one of a kind device, and it really goes hand in hand with Termux: I know of no other devices which are this compact and have a decent keyboard.

Please review #762.. True, if the background is #000000. If you're talking about the background of the app drawer when using a dark wallpaper on Android 8.1, the black used in this icon is darker than the background and can be distinguished. Also, the problem of blending in is reduced by using two characters rather than the single block.\nThe problem of blending in is also present when slapping icons onto a white plate such as Google has done with several of their icons as the background is barely visible or sticks out in a bad way on white backgrounds. I don't know how to address it when using black or white.\nI could use different colors (I love the Nord color scheme so maybe the background and foreground colors from that color scheme or any other color scheme that we can arrive at a consensus for) but these colors reflect the default Termux color scheme and that's why I went with them.\nHere's what the icon would look like with the background and foreground colors from the Nord color scheme:\n\n. > Moreover, what > means?\nInteresting question. This proved to be an interesting read: Why is >_ used as a terminal icon anyway?.. I'm using the OmniROM stock launcher and the adaptive icon shows up properly on it. Could you test any different launcher to see if this is something exclusive to Nova?. @c-e-p-x-u-o There's a PR (#797) to try out an alternative color.\nOut of curiosity what's that app with an omelette for an icon.. Instead of designing a new icon, could you try helping out with #552? . @trygveaa, The icon is not just similar to ConnecBot. A prompt is used as the icon for terminal emulators across platforms. Each does it slightly differently though, be it colors or the characters used. I've actually used \u276f instead of the commonly used > and we also use different colors from the ConnectBot icon and different positioning as well.\nThe problem with using just a block is that without a border to offer a frame, the icon would just be a single white rectangle in a black background. I can't think of a way to offer a frame due to the various icon masks that might be applied to an adaptive icon. The alternative would be to throw the current icon on to a background but that is a compromise I'd rather not make.\n@flipflop97 That's a fair point. I would like to know what @fornwall thinks about this. If we switch the legacy icon to this new one, Google recommends dropping the round icon unless the branding of the app relies on a circular shape (and I think it doesn't). So would it be okay to change the legacy icon to the square variant of the new one and drop the round icon?. Does the notification icon have to be updated to reflect the new icon?. Duplicate of #781.

Bluetooth to Pi is handy when you're moving around and don't have Wifi set up yet where you are. W/o this functionality I'm bound to my laptop & puTTY to execute sudo raspi-config on the serial BT connection.. Fork downloaded and Bluetooth branch built in Android Studio to create a signed APK.\nI've installed this on my GT-I9505 running CM 12.1. (Uninstalled the Playstore release first).\nTermux seems to be working as normal. I could even hit the context (i.e. menu) button quickly to bring up the context menu and connect to my Pi. This was all successful.\nI'd usually only use Bluetooth before setting up Wifi wherever I am, so the next step for me is:\nsudo raspi-config\nAfter which Termux died (\"Unfortunately, Termux has stopped\"). Any ideas? If there are any logs you'd like to see, please let me know where to find them.\nraspi-config is of course a menu-based application. Might this have something to do with the root cause?\nCheers. HI @mjarvisal,\nI've fixed the error on the Bluetooth Session. I'll e-mail you the details.\nCheers.. >           Could you summarize a bit what this does?\n\nFrom looking at the code I assume it allows for connecting/disconnecting to devices through menu.\nIs there any particular reason why you choose to integrate it into the main app instead of into termux-api?\n\nHi @Grimler91\nIf you can give us some pointers on how this should be added to termux-api, I'll see what I can do to refactor it out of the main app.\nCheers..

The whole idea of adaptive icons was bad, because it adds more restrictions to design, and doesn't provide any real benefits except new visual effects, which are not that important, since we're looking for icon on desktop, and usually drop our attention after finding it, because app if find, and already opening. Since 90% of time is spent on search for icon in menu/desk, 5% on icon animations animations (because it's really fast), and 5% on launching animation (because it's as same as fast as icon animation), icon animations are not prior here. Old icon was easy noticeable on both dark bg (desk, with dark wp) and light bg (menu in stock android). New icon is really annoying since I tend to use #000000 background on my desk.\nIf adaptive icons could have different background which isn't just cropped, it could be more flexable, and old icon could be easily adapted.\nSo I agree with https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/552#issuecomment-399833763 and number 6 is the best out there.

Also note that 0x5404 is the TCSETSF ioctl.\n( Except apparently on the mips platform ).\nSince Termux is a good citizen it doesn't use a lot of ioctls directly but go through termios.\nAnd that's where you'll find the culprit.\nIf you have ndk-sysroot installed you can verify that by yourself:\n/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/include/bits/termios_inlines.h:\n__BIONIC_TERMIOS_INLINE int tcsetattr(int fd, int optional_actions, const struct termios* s) {\n  int cmd;                                                           switch (optional_actions) {                                          case TCSANOW: cmd = TCSETS; break;\n    case TCSADRAIN: cmd = TCSETSW; break;\n    case TCSAFLUSH: cmd = TCSETSF; break;\n    default: errno = EINVAL; return -1;\n  }\n  return ioctl(fd, cmd, s);\n}.

So, finally, you need something like:\nPS1=\"\\[\\033[1;34m\\]$ \\[\\033[0m\\]\"\n\nor (if you prefer to use \\e instead of an octal-escape):\nPS1=\"\\[\\e[1;34m\\]$ \\[\\e[0m\\]\"\n\nHTH\n. ",

Not a termux issue, but sharing what happened: After wiping cache using \"fastboot erase cache\" my phone could not boot again. Had to reflash the OS. During reinstallation twrp gave errors like \"can't mount cache\" etc. The errors went away after wiping cache once again. I lost a lot of data.\nThe stock OS wasn't booting on reflashing.

    "evg-zhabotinsky": "\nIt takes ~2 seconds to start vim\n\nThat's already long enough. A heavily modded Vim (a vim-based IDE called Yavide) starts instantaneously (before I even release Enter key) on my laptop which has just slightly higher CPU frequency.\nAlso, the mere fact that terminal size noticeably affects startup time is a dead giveaway that something's wrong with terminal, 60x182x53x4 (60fps, each character is 2 bytes for unicode + 2 bytes for attributes) ~= 2MiB/s is a laughable bandwidth requirement unless you go over a slow network.\nHowever, your point is valid in general. When I get home I will verify how fast Termux environment and Vim specifically work when accessed over SSH, thus bypassing terminal only and keeping everything else the same.. Did the cat test just now on my phone:\n```\ncd /sdcard\ndd if=/dev/urandom bs=1K count=1K | hexdump -C >big.txt  # ~5.5MiB plain text file\ntime cat big.txt >/dev/null  # 0.07s real time, thus disk read time is irrelevant\ntime cat big.txt  # Tested on different terminals:\n1.30s -- tmux (inside Termux) when window is not in foreground\n2.97s -- Android terminal by jackpal\n38.9s -- CyanogenMod terminal. It is buggy, line ordering was messed up :/\n67.6s -- Termux, same for active session, background session and minimized app\n```\nThere definitely is a lot of room for improvement.\nAlso, note that this is on my phone where vim starts in a few of seconds on Termux. It takes a minute to do that on my tablet which isn't with me right now, so I expect much longer times when I run the test on it.. @sdrausty Could you please explain what you tried to measure? Also, whatever you tried to achieve with nice, it made no difference when I cated my file once more.\nIf you simply tried to compare different environments, cat is too primitive for that to matter. It just does read and write syscalls in a loop so all the real work happens inside kernel. Running cat big.txt >/dev/null finished instantaneously so writes to Termux pty are the bottleneck.. @sdrausty proot simply uses ptrace syscall to intercept some other syscalls and fake chroot (and some other features too) by slightly altering syscall behavior (e.g. modifying file path). Host kernel is still used for everything.\nWhen it comes to testing, the simpler the better, so simple cat with different terminals is the ideal test subject. Not sure why I didn't think of it myself.. @sdrausty\n1. There is no such thing as \"emulated kernel\" with chroot, proot, qumu-usermode, bsd jails and similar, including any combinations or derivatives of thereof.\n2. We are getting off topic. The suspected issue is with terminal, so in order to prove or disprove that claim tests should use, ideally, exactly the same environment but different terminal emulators. You are trying to do the opposite.\nAs for the cat tests on my tablet (copied big.txt from my phone):\n 1.33s with tmux\n 68s with Jackpal terminal\n* 1 hour  with Termux (give or take a couple minutes, I forgot to disable screen timeout at first)\nI guess there has to be something wrong with that tablet (~60x slowdown for Termux and ~20x for Jackpal compared to my phone), but the problem is on Android side and not with Linux base or Termux environment since tmux under Termux is fast on both devices. In any case, Termux is still much slower than it could be so my tablet should be a good test subject for worst case scenario.. Huh. So it was mostly paranoid unicode handling and not syncing?\nWorks fine for me, ~5MB hexdump file cating time is down to ~1.5 minutes from ~1 hour before the fix. vim also starts up instantly now. Could be faster, but at that point human is the bottleneck most of the time.\nStill, it's a stopgap, and the other code path still needs to be optimized. Suggest keeping the issue open until then..

Hi\nJust a few random thoughts:\n\nThe problem: If you grant the root permission to Termux, then any script running inside it can obtain root privileges (very bad!).\n\nI assume this means that threat model includes running malicious scripts inside Termux (as opposed to just running desktop software installation scripts that call sudo as part of their installation process and accidentaly make mess on filesystem)\nEither way what is supposed to protect root access is Superuser app and what you're asking for is wrapper around it (because Superuser is not flexible enough for your use case)\n\nWhen you call for example \u201csudo nano /system/build.prop\u201d a password command is presented prior to execute the binary.\n\nWell, by default nano is writable by Termux process (as well as libraries used by it), don't forget about those.\nAlso remember about protecting sudo launcher itself (from being replaced with hostile version capturing password, libraries or other files used by it being replaced and sudo launcher being ptraced to capture password)\n\nOnly the Termux:Sudo App has access to the password.\n\nAnd of course everything that gets ran as root (Either via new sudo or standard su (from Termux or another installed app)), but that shouldn't be concern because it could replace Superuser app and not bother with Termux:Sudo\n\nMy idea is to use another and different process.\n\nWell, if so then you should probably be able to make such app without cooperation from Termux side.\nNote that Termux:API works through being in same process but, I was considering extending termux-am it with api providing access to caller uid/pid, stdin/out across applications and not exiting am immediately but waiting for called app to say so. Please let me know if you'd need those, though as Termux:Sudo is going to use root access it could grab those from /proc/.../fd directly.. Rebased and added to flag reset to clear.. ",

Being able to execute app_data_file either as an executable or a library is on the way out in the long term.. > Where are you getting this from? The spirit of the policy is spelled out clearly at the top: \"We don\u2019t allow apps that steal data, secretly monitor or harm users, or are otherwise malicious.\" They want to be able to ensure that users download what was advertised and tested in the Play store.\nA very deliberate / explicit misreading of the rules isn't going to stop them from taking action.\nIt says, first of all:\n\nAn app distributed via Google Play may not modify, replace, or update itself using any method other than Google Play\u2019s update mechanism. Likewise, an app may not download executable code (e.g. dex, JAR, .so files) from a source other than Google Play. This restriction does not apply to code that runs in a virtual machine and has limited access to Android APIs (such as JavaScript in a webview or browser).\n\nFollowed by this:\n\nThe following are explicitly prohibited:\n* Apps or SDKs that download executable code, such as dex files or native code, from a source other than Google Play.\n\nIt's very clear that they intend to enforce similar rules as Apple does for iOS, they simply haven't cracked down yet and they only very recently reworded it to have much stronger wording.\nDoing this with knowledge that it's not permitted is considered malicious.\n\nTermux doesn't modify itself (you can't replace the terminal app with apt), and it doesn't allow automatic downloading or installation of APKs.\n\nThat doesn't matter. It's violating the rules by downloading native code from a source other than Google Play and running it.\n\nI'm not sure how you expect a user to manually install every dependency, or why Google would see that as a sensible thing for them to police.\n\nI didn't say I expected that. I just pointed out that it's explicitly violating the rules. They've made these rules much more explicit and will be finally starting to enforce them.\nIt's a sensible thing for them to police because they want to move to having comparable security as iOS and they can't do that as long as the SELinux policies and Android Runtime permit executing code from the app_data_file label.. Executable code running in the same SELinux domain as the app have full access to the Android APIs, etc. just like an app and isn't permitted unless it came from the apk. The rules are very clear now, with the expectations very explicitly spelled out.\nThe rules can be worked around in a few different ways like using apks shipped via Google Play which doesn't mean needing to manually search for them and install them. It seems less realistic to take the approach of fully virtualizing the environment. Maybe it would be permitted to run native code in an isolatedProcess as long as it was still properly contained without access to Android APIs like an executable / library running alongside app_process in the main SELinux domain.\nI'm only communicating the changes to the rules that made this much more explicit. I didn't write the rules and have won't have any involvement in the upcoming enforcement. I don't know when they're going to start enforcing it but it appears to be coming soon, alongside changes like forcing apps to use targetSdkVersion 26+, etc. They have some major security issues in the app ecosystem compared to iOS and they're addressing them. There's no reason to think that the rules don't apply to everyone.. > I don't see how it can be pre-empted\nBy considering if the package manager could install packages (apps) from Google Play to conform to the policy. If that's not realistic, then I expect it will be a victim of their policy and then of SELinux policy hardening. I use it and I'm interested in keeping in working without rolling back future security features.\nThe discussion is treating me as if I'm the one that came up with this policy and it doesn't seem very productive, so we'll just see what happens as they start enforcing stricter Play Store policies. shrug. I brought up that this was forbidden and would likely become part of the SELinux policy last year (9 Apr 2018): https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/655.\nAs I stated then,\n\nThey rewrote the policy to be much more explicitly about this being disallowed, and it can be expected that they'll not only act on it for the Play Store but via SELinux policy.\nThey intend to support cases like Termux by having apps like Termux upload their packages as separate apps to the Play Store, with it initiating user installs / uninstalls of those apps.\nStaying ahead of the game (i.e. future SELinux policy enforcement) would involve not extracting the executables manually but rather running them from where the apk package installer extracts libraries. Being able to execute app_data_file either as an executable or a library is on the way out in the long term.\n\nIt doesn't fundamentally break Termux, but rather Termux would need to switch to an alternative approach for distributing packages. Using apt within the app sandbox to install code isn't going to be viable anymore. The restrictions are no doubt going to be tightened up in the future too, and it can be expected that libraries will need to be mapped from the read-only app data directory or apk too, rather than the read-write home directory working. It wouldn't be necessary to split absolutely everything into assorted apks, but rather there could be apks for groups of related packages based on size. Termux can initiate the apk installs itself too, after prompting the user to allow it as an unknown source. It's an inconvenience for sure, but not a deal breaker.\nSomeone there accused me of concern trolling, but I was genuinely giving an insider heads up about likely changes on the horizon bringing w^x enforcement for data in storage. I use Termux and also work on Android OS security, so I wanted to have a conversation about how this could be addressed long before it was going to become a problem. I provided enforcement of the same kind of restrictions in my own downstream work, but with a toggle to turn it off for apps like Termux. I would have loved to have an alternate option for installing packages compatible with the security feature, and that would have prepared Termux for the eventual enforcement of this feature upstream.\nIt's worth noting that there are still holes in the SELinux policy, which can be used to bypass it by jumping through some hoops, but the intention is clearly to move towards enforcing w^x and enforcing the official rules via the implementation. See https://play.google.com/about/privacy-security-deception/malicious-behavior/.\n\nThe following are explicitly prohibited:\n[...]\nApps or SDKs that download executable code, such as dex files or native code, from a source other than Google Play.\n[...]\n\nTermux could also ship the necessary scripting for generating a Termux package apk from executables/libraries so that users could create their own and continue running their own code, albeit less conveniently.. @xeffyr This only applies to apps targeting API > 28. Termux will continue to work indefinitely as long as it continues to target API 28. However, there's a timeline for phasing out old API targets on the Play Store about a year after they're introduced. It then becomes impossible to upload a new version of the app without updating the target API level.\nhttps://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk\nDistributing the app outside the Play Store would still be possible, but the OS has the concept of a minimum supported target API level already (ro.build.version.min_supported_target_sdk). It's currently 17 in Android P and is being increased to 23 in Android Q. It currently only produces a warning, but it won't necessarily remain that way. They don't want targeting an old API level or distributing outside the Play Store to be a loophole for bypassing privacy and security restrictions tied to API level.. You can probably stay at API 28 until around November 2020 for the Play Store assuming the timeline at https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk is followed again for API 29.\nIt would be even longer until using API 28 broke outside the Play Store via a stricter future version of ro.build.version.min_supported_target_sdk doing more than warning. Probably at least 2 years and likely significantly longer.\nSo, it's not like it's going to suddenly break when Android Q comes out, since it's only for API 29+.. Python, Ruby, Perl, etc. written by users will still work without a hassle because it's not native code. They won't be able to execute it as ./script.py but they can still run it as python3 script.py. I don't see any way that would ever stop working. Libraries without native code are also going to continue working without being in the native library directory too, since they don't get mapped as executable.\nIn the future, native libraries will likely all need to be in the native library directory to work but for API 29 they're only enforcing it for executables. I expect the enforcement will happen for native libraries next year, since they already added an auditallow rule to warn in the logs when it occurs.\n\nDistributing packages in APKs will either require to have hundreds of these APKs published to the Google Play / F-Droid or put multiple packages into single APK up to maximal size (~ 100MB). Technically it is possible to have very large APKs, but they cannot be distributed with Google Play and maybe F-Droid.\n\nYes, that's what I was saying would need to happen: bundling groups of related packages inside of shared uid apks signed with the same key. For users to be able to extend it with their own native code, they would need to have their own build of Termux signed with their own key, along with scripting for generating new extension apks out of their code. There might be a better approach than my suggestion. It was just intended as a starting point.\nIt will also still be possible to interpret native code from the app data directory. For example, I think valgrind executable_in_app_data will continue working, even though ./executable_in_app_data will not, since valgrind acts as a machine code interpreter. Similarly, running native code inside QEMU would obviously still work.. > Is this a potential use case for Dynamic Delivery using App Bundles?\nIt could work, if dynamic feature modules are able to ship additional executables / libraries to be extracted into the native libraries directory. It's not clear if that's possible. It appears the limit is 500MB via an app bundle, rather than 100MB, so it's a limited solution:\n\nPublishing with Android App Bundles also increases the app size limit to 500MB without having to use APK expansion files. Keep in mind, this limit applies only to the actual download size, not the publishing size. So, users can download apps as large as 500MB and, with dynamic delivery, all of that storage is used for only the code and resources they need to run the app. When you combine this with support for uncompressed native libraries, larger apps, such as games, can reduce disk usage and increase user retention.\nI see this as a way to comply with Google Play while still allowing a package manager-like function, potentially with another mechanism for installations outside of Google Play or from source that more closely resembles the current mechanism.\n\nI don't think it's going to be able to be much different outside the Play Store, since the SELinux policy restrictions on executing only read-only native code still apply for apps outside the Play Store and Android variants without the Play Store or Play Services. It would make sense to work around this issue at the same time as coming into compliance with the Play Store policy on downloading executable code, but they don't necessarily need to be solved at the same time. I think it would be best to choose a path that will work both inside and outside the Play Store. I don't know how realistic it is to support the app bundle and dynamic feature modules outside Play, since there isn't an existing distribution option with support for it and it's not clear how much is available without Play Services, etc.. > Notice what is not blocked here: https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/sepolicy/+/804149\nNote that execute for app_data_file (mapping as PROT_EXEC) had an auditallow rule added after this commit as they're planning on removing that in the near future, perhaps next year. It will currently log audit warnings leading up to the likely eventual removal.\nThe remaining holes in the SELinux policy are tied to the ART JIT and other JIT compilers: ashmem execute (an implementation detail that could change) and execmem (in-memory rwx code and rw -> rx transitions). ART supports using full AOT compilation instead of the JIT compiler, but it's not their current choice.\nChromium-based browsers including the WebView use execmem in the isolated_app domain, not untrusted_app, so even without an Apple-like approach only permitting the bundled browser and WebView for other apps to use, that wouldn't be a direct blocker. I would be surprised if they removed execmem for untrusted_app in the near future, but it could happen over the longer term, especially if they simply restrict it to a variant of isolated_app.\nThe original issue that I filed (https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/655) was about the general problem of this being in violation of their policy, before there was a partial implementation of a technical mechanism enforcing it for native code. There can never be full enforcement at a technical level since interpreters will continue to work even once native code execution is forbidden.\n\nIf Google do this, it has to forbid javascript in browsers too.\n\nThey permit JavaScript via the exception in the policy for isolated virtual machines:\n\nAn app distributed via Google Play may not modify, replace, or update itself using any method other than Google Play's update mechanism. Likewise, an app may not download executable code (e.g. dex, JAR, .so files) from a source other than Google Play. This restriction does not apply to code that runs in a virtual machine and has limited access to Android APIs (such as JavaScript in a webview or browser).\n\nhttps://play.google.com/about/privacy-security-deception/malicious-behavior/\nThe result at a technical level would be that they need to keep around execmem for a variant of the isolated_app SELinux domain used by browsers, but not untrusted_app. At the moment, both isolated_app and untrusted_app permit execmem, but Chromium doesn't use it in untrusted_app. ART uses the untrusted_app execmem when configured to do JIT compilation via the relevant system properties. It's fully optional though, and still supports full AOT compilation as was done in Android 6.. Files in the app home directory are labelled as app_data_file and this is the audit rule generating warnings for mapping the data as executable:\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/sepolicy/+/08450264ae3f917f6b8e4091d6fedf84ef8d796f/private/untrusted_app_all.te#27\nThey add auditallow rules leading up to eventually removing it from the policy. You can try loading a library from app data with API 29 and you'll see an audit warning in the logs.\nIn-memory code generation via rwx pages or rw -> rx transitions is classified as execmem, which is something they'd like to remove in the long-term but it's currently used by the ART JIT. It's not used by Chromium within untrusted_app domains, since it only does that within the sandboxed renderers which use isolated_app domains. They could remove it from the main isolated_app and require that apps opt-in to having it available via a special domain. It should be expected that it will be eventually happen, since this is a very standard form of security hardening and they've been slowly moving towards it.\nThey already removed execmem for some of the base system including system_server. Their security team would obviously like to remove it everywhere, but for now the performance vs. memory vs. storage usage characteristics of mixed AOT and JIT compilation for ART are winning out over the security advantages of pure AOT compilation with execmem disallowed.. The only reason they're starting with requiring executables to be in the native library directory rather than native libraries (which is the main purpose of the directory) is because that will impact more apps, so the transition will be more painful. Apps can also disable native library extraction and map native libraries from the apk directly, since the linker supports mapping libraries from zips directly as long as they meet the requirements (page aligned and not compressed). They have a pass for properly aligning them in the apk build system.. It will actually log the warning about native libraries in the data directory for all API levels.\nHere's where they continue to allow running executables from app_data_file for API < 28:\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/sepolicy/+/08450264ae3f917f6b8e4091d6fedf84ef8d796f/private/untrusted_app_27.te#30\nEven though it's allowed, they do still log audit warnings about it for API < 29.\nAlso you can see that for API < 26, even more is permitted, since they've tightened up these policies for API 26+ in the past too:\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/sepolicy/+/08450264ae3f917f6b8e4091d6fedf84ef8d796f/private/untrusted_app_25.te\nFor example, API 26+ forbid execmod which means things like rx -> rw -> rx transitions for files mapped from storage. You can only do those kinds of transitions in-memory via execmem now. They've removed execmem for a lot of the base system but not yet apps, which is as I mentioned primarily due to the ART JIT and it'd also be a major backwards incompatible change. Finishing this up by removing the remaining 3 or so holes in the policy is definitely on their radar. It's just hard to get it done due to compatibility issues and performance/memory/storage vs. security tradeoffs made elsewhere that they'd need to decide are less important (and I definitely think they will, eventually)..

Probably many others do too.\nA keybinding for volume control without v may seem unintuitive, but would also be easily learnable when compared to the inconsistency and unreliability introduced by overriding an established keybinding like alt-v or alt-d (both heavily used in bash and emacs) when using volume up control. . The 2 rows of extra keys is indeed a hindrance.

    "Konehaltia": "I think I've found the root cause of this problem. I'm not an Android expert, so\ntake it with a grain of salt.\nThe Gemini keyboard's KCM file is located at /system/usr/keychars/Generic.kcm.\nI've included the relevant part below. See\nhttps://source.android.com/devices/input/key-character-map-files for the file\nformat documentation.\nkey DPAD_LEFT {\n  base:                        fallback DPAD_LEFT\n  fn:                          fallback MOVE_HOME\n}\n\nkey DPAD_DOWN {\n  base:                        fallback DPAD_DOWN\n  fn:                          fallback PAGE_DOWN\n}\n\nkey DPAD_RIGHT {\n  base:                        fallback DPAD_RIGHT\n  fn:                          fallback MOVE_END\n}\n\nkey DPAD_UP {\n  base:                        fallback DPAD_UP\n  fn:                          fallback PAGE_UP\n}\n\nNote the fallback declarations. When they are used, the app receives two key\nevents - the original and the fallback. If the app handles the original, the\nfallback is canceled.\nI'll use the Page Up combination (Fn+Up) as an example. The same applies to all four.\nHere's a description of what happens when the user presses Fn+Up on the Gemini\nin Termux. The events are handled by onKeyDown at\nterminal-view/src/main/java/com/termux/view/TerminalView.java.\nFirst, the method is called with a KeyEvent where the code is DPAD_UP and the\nFunction modifier is set.\nTermux looks at the key code and the Ctrl/Alt/Shift modifiers. It doesn't check\nthe Function modifier's status at all (!), and thus believes it's seeing a pure\nDPAD_UP. Termux handles it as such, and tells Android the event has been\nhandled (returns true from onKeyDown).\nSince the initial event was handled, the fallback event is canceled.\nHere's the relevant code:\nint keyMod = 0;\nif (controlDownFromEvent) keyMod |= KeyHandler.KEYMOD_CTRL;\nif (event.isAltPressed()) keyMod |= KeyHandler.KEYMOD_ALT;\nif (event.isShiftPressed()) keyMod |= KeyHandler.KEYMOD_SHIFT;\nif (handleKeyCode(keyCode, keyMod)) {\n    if (LOG_KEY_EVENTS) Log.i(EmulatorDebug.LOG_TAG, \"handleKeyCode() took key event\");\n    return true;\n}\n\nHere's one way to stop Termux from mistaking Fn+X for X:\nif (!event.isFunctionPressed() && handleKeyCode(keyCode, keyMod)) {\n\nAfter that change, Fn+Up is no longer interpreted as just Up. However, we now\nhave a second problem: it doesn't get interpreted as Page Up either! Pressing\nthe combination simply does nothing.\nThe second problem is caused by some code further down that handles key events\nthat map to Unicode characters - for example, pressing the A key. Termux checks\nif the event maps to a character. If it doesn't, the event is ignored but\nreported as handled. Thus, the fallback event is still canceled.\nHere's the relevant code:\nint result = event.getUnicodeChar(effectiveMetaState);\nif (LOG_KEY_EVENTS)\n    Log.i(EmulatorDebug.LOG_TAG, \"KeyEvent#getUnicodeChar(\" + effectiveMetaState + \") returned: \" + result);\nif (result == 0) {\n    return true;\n}\n\nI'm not sure why Termux claims to have handled the event (returns true) here.\nI'm not very familiar with Android's key events or Android development in\ngeneral, and as such I don't know what the implications are.\nThat said, I tried changing the code to report that Termux didn't handle the\nevent - that is, to return false.\nSince the original event is now reported as unhandled, Android goes ahead with\nthe fallback event - in this case, PAGE_UP without the Fn modifier. That event\nis successfully handled by existing Termux code.\nThus, with this second change, Page Up and the other Fn+arrow combinations\nstarted working.\nif (result == 0) {\n    return false;\n}\n\nI didn't notice any obvious problems after the change. I can still type all the\ncharacters I've tried. However, if it does cause any problems, the effect can be\nlimited to situations where the Fn key is pressed.\nif (result == 0) {\n    return !event.isFunctionPressed();\n}\n\nNote that this way of solving the problem doesn't just fix the Fn+arrow\ncombinations. It also allows Gemini users (and others with a Function key) to\nmap other Fn-combinations to various other non-printable keys by using\nfallback declarations in the KCM file.\nAlso, there seems to be a second modifier key - SYM - that Termux doesn't\ncheck. It might be a good idea to have more general checks for any unhandled\nmodifier keys, since any users with those keys will presumably have the same\nproblem. The logic could probably be flipped to call handleKeyCode only when\nthe modifier mask consists entirely of currently handled modifiers (Ctrl, Alt,\nShift).. I think I've found the reason why these combinations don't work in Termux.\nWhen there's a key event, Termux checks if it has any Ctrl/Alt/Shift modifiers. It doesn't check other modifiers, like Function. This causes Termux to mistake Fn+Up for Up, and handle it as such.\nIf the bug is fixed so that Termux correctly tells Android it has no idea what this Fn+Up combination is, Android will then check if the keyboard config defines a fallback key. In case of Gemini, the fallback is Page Up. So Android gives Termux a Page Up event, which Termux already knows how to handle, and everything works.\nSee my longer explanation: https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/731#issuecomment-409201688.

    "edaubert": "Hi,\nI took a look on how to do this.\nAs I am quite new on this, the approach can be wrong so don't hesitate to tell me\nMy usecase was to be able to use the TermuxService from the outside and especially from Easer.\nTo do so, I change the definition of TermuxService in AndroidManifest.xml like this:\nxml\n        <service\n            android:name=\"com.termux.app.TermuxService\"\n            android:exported=\"true\"\n            android:permission=\"com.termux.permission.TERMUX_SERVICE\">\n            <intent-filter>\n                <action android:name=\"com.termux.service_execute\" />\n            </intent-filter>\n        </service>\nIt seems that the intent-filter is important because without it, there is no dialog to ask the user on Easer to allow the custom permission.\nI also need to define my custom permission:\nxml\n    <permission android:name=\"com.termux.permission.TERMUX_SERVICE\"\n        android:label=\"@string/termux_permission_label\"\n        android:description=\"@string/termux_permission_description\"\n        android:icon=\"@drawable/ic_launcher\"\n        android:protectionLevel=\"dangerous\"/>\nThen I modify Easer to be able to  access Termux.\nTo do so, I express the requirement of my permission by adding:\nxml\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"com.termux.permission.TERMUX_SERVICE\" />\nin AndroidManifest.xml and I add the dynamic permission request in the code of Easer:\n```java\n@Override\npublic boolean checkPermissions(@NonNull Context context) {\n    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {\n        return PluginHelper.checkPermission(context, \"com.termux.permission.TERMUX_SERVICE\");\n    } else {\n        return true;\n    }\n\n//        return true;\n    }\n@Override\npublic void requestPermissions(@NonNull Activity activity, int requestCode) {\n    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {\n        PluginHelper.requestPermission(activity, requestCode, \"com.termux.permission.TERMUX_SERVICE\");\n    }\n}\n\n```\nFinally using run command plugin in Easer, I am able to run this following command:\nsh\nam startservice --user 0 -a com.termux.service_execute -n com.termux/com.termux.app.TermuxService -d com.termux.file:/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.shortcuts/test\nThe test script should be available on .shortcuts directory.\nWhat do you think about this approach ?\nChanges are both available on https://github.com/edaubert/termux-app and https://github.com/edaubert/Easer if you want to try it. I can also provide a pull request if you are interested in. The changes in Termux are only about the AndroidManifest.xml and the string.xml to handle some translation.. No you don't have access to it.\nYou need to use some storage permission I guess.\nI guess another possibility could be to send the file to termux before trying to execute it.. Yet another way to do it is to give storage access to termux and store the script where it can find it.\nhttps://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux-setup-storage. So I have completed a termux plugin on Easer which fully use the permission.\nIt uses the fact that termux provide a document provider. This provider allow external apps to get access to some files inside the termux environment.\nPlease have a look here: https://github.com/renyuneyun/Easer/pull/205. As @fornwall said, I am not sure we need to add an extra layer of security.\nFirst as it is said the users of termux are expected to be advanced users and so, in my opinion, should be aware of what implies to accept a permission. Well for me even non advanced users should be aware of this...\nSecond, it is the termux app which defines the permission and so the description can be explicit. And if a user do not want to read the permission dialog why should he want to read yet another popup dialog.\nAbout the part of \"their ssh/gpg private keys stolen or likewise, it's bad regardless of if those users can be blamed for not reading through permissions\" you completly right but if the user gives root access to another app, it can also stole its data and termux is not able to protect those data even without speaking of permission. In the end, and this is mostly my really subjective opinion \ud83d\ude03, users are still responsible of what happens and permissions are something which is not just a bother which display annoying dialog.\nHowever, if you are still willing something, i will propose to add a notification with multiple actions.\nThe notification provide a small text about running a script (name of the script and who ask to run it)\n- action 1: always run it\n- action 2: run it once\n- actiin 3: never run it\nWhy I am proposing a notification is because I don't want to be interrupted by something that I may have not ask for (e.g. an automation script).\nPlus if people do not care about popup dialog, they may care about their notifications.\nBut again for me, this is only an extra layer of security for supposed advanced termux users and I think they do not need that..

I probably just don't know enough to know this is futile, but some desperate thoughts:\nIt would be neat if one could ask for the permission to use the sdcard, via ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE or something, on behalf of another application. If I could manually grant, say, rsync the ability to write+delete on the sdcard I'd be quite happy! \nAnother (ugly!) workaround would be to manually open up the permissions on the termux directory on the sdcard (/storage/30303030-2d30-3030-3000-020000000000/Android/data/com.termux/files). That way I could redirect other applications to dump their data in a directory that termux binaries can work with.\nEven more crazy would be some termux FUSE-ish filesystem that redirects the writes to the termux directory on the sdcard (or even the root if termux would make use of the required APIs).

The folders in my usr now(in failsafe session) are:    \ninclude   \nlib   \nlibexec   \nman   \nshare   \ntmp   \nvar    \nMy last 5 bash commands:    \ngit checkout ..\ngit tag v3.1 ...\ngit tag ..\ngit tag v3.9 ..\ngit tag\nexit\nexit\nThe last rm command was almost 100-200 lines before. That too only on a home file. I do remember getting a unusual exit code(instead of usual 127). But  that  happens often, so I don't remember.    \nNote: Though I can input commands in normal session, All commands return command is not found , where command is the command entered.\nEDIT: In normal session, most commands are not found. I can cd but ls not found.. @xeffyr\n\nYou used git to manage stuff in /usr. \n\nThat's not possible. The git commands were in my .bash_history. But It was scoped to a specific folder in my $HOME directory com.termux/files/home/dir1/project1/. I didn't touch usr.. I've never used to go to usr, unless I  install some applications. \nI used the failsafe session described here: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Recover_a_broken_environment#Possible_broken_dotfiles\n\nYou are now in a Failsafe Session. It launches the default Shell of Android /system/bin/sh with access to the Termux directory\n\nSo, maybe that's why /bin and /etc is not present.. @xeffyr Aren't they kind of symlinked? Maybe because mkshrc failed, It didn't link or something like that? Regardless, I didn't setup-storage and I obviously can't now either. So,how can I recover my $HOME ? Is it possible to put some bin files back in for the backup. \nThe above link states,    \n\nRemove $PREFIX entirely.\nrm -rf /data/data/com.termux/files/usr\nAfter that you can restart your Termux App completely, which will trigger a reinstallation of the default $PREFIX contents. You'll have to reinstall all your programs, but your $HOME folder remains untouched, so all your dotfiles are still there. \n\nSo, Can I trigger that and save my $HOME ?\nEDIT:Also, Will there be logs somewhere else in cache or tmp, so that I can see what happened?\nOr maybe I can change shells from failsafe?. @xeffyr mv worked. Had to re-install and set up everything again... But no permanent damage. Only wish I knew what caused this: some rogue program... or anything I did...   \nThanks for all your help.     \nTip for others: $HOME was also freely accesible in the inbuilt-Files App; In case, anyone wants to backup without setup-storage..

    "JanuszChmiel": "And can you tell Me, how to make Pulseaudio to cooperate withAndroid so \nI could use some console player toplay sound by using Pulseaudiofrom \nTermux?\nI AM sad that I Am not able to find The command line to make Dropbear or \nother app to control Termux from Putty for Windows from Windows \noperating system.\nAnd because I do not see at all, I can not use screen reader for Android \nto analyse pulse.conf, default.paand other files to discoveron which \nport Pulseaudio stream data.\nSo I could try Simple protocol player for Android or Pulse droid.\nOr is there other procedure which will allow Me use Pulseaudio to play \nsounds on Android from Termux app?\n. Oh, so it is very simple solution.\nIt is much more simple than experimenting with Ubuntu or Debian which \nrun inchroot.\nI had problems with Speech-dispatcher. And I was not able toforce \nPulseaudio to stream to Android clients like Simpleprotocol player.\nI willtry to compile Espeak directly in Termux so it would use Libpulse \ntocooperate with Pulseaudio integrated to Termux.\n  Next goal will be to compileSPeech-dispatcher but I do not know,if \nthis speech server will cooperate with libcbin, which is The part of Termux.\nI think, that it would be even possible to use Speech-del and Emacsspeak \nfrom Termux.\nIt would not require running X server. But compiling Speech-dispatcher \nrequire many dependencies.\nThank you very much for yours support.\n. Dear MR Grimler ,\nYes, it would be perfect, if somebody of advanced developers here could \nenable visually impaired users to use those apps with Termux. Since I \nhave spent many hours of my time to make Speech-dispatcher work from \nchroot environment. So I have started Proot and I have tried Ubuntu for \nExample.\nBut I have faced issue, I was never able to configurePulseaudio in \nchroot container so it would stream sound by using some port and so apps \nlike Simple protocol player could play sound from chroot environment.\nUnfortunately, I have found out, that when I have tried Xserver XSDL, \nand its integrated Pulseaudio support, that Espeak is causing big \nspeechinterruption when using with Speech-dispatcher.\nI have even got error from Speech-dispatcher, but it only shown long \nHexadecimal number and two words. It would be too complex to debug those \nC applications. It would even require to deeply analyse source code of \nXserver Xsdl and its integrated Pulseaudio.\nI have only found out, that speech interruption is not so big, when \ndefault lovest possible Audio buffer value in Xserver XSDL have been \nset. But recompiling this app, finding in which sourcecode file is \nlocated The buffer value, experimenting with it, it would very probably \nnot solve this problem, because if I set too low value, it will very \nprobably cause other crash.\nBut because advanced developers here were ported Pulseaudio to Termux, \nthat Pulseaudio server really send data to Android modules so it play, I \nthink that working directly in Termux would be The best option.\nIn longer future, it would be even possible to run standalone GTK apps \nsuch as Firefox and Orca. I have tried it on Ubuntu.\n From Termux. It is always necessary to run Window manager first, \nfollowedby Orca screen reader and finally, GTK app name must be typed.\nAlways used from Bash shell and by using &\nso for example\nOpenbox &\nOrca &\ngedit &\nBut it is far future for now.\nLets start with Speech-dispatcher and Espeak integration.\nIt would not be easy, because current Espeak version available for \nTermux have been compiled very probably without Portaudio.h and Libaudio \nsupport.\nI Am afraid, that this complex source code for Espeak would had to be \nmodified tobe compatible with reliable internal Pulseaudio for Termux.\nI Am ready to test standalone Espeak and I can report crashes.\nThanks to build in Termux accessibility support, I AM not being forced \nto use Windows machine with Putty to use it.\nThank all presented developers for yours help.\nI AM also ready to compile some apps, but my problem for now is, that \nmany depended libraries are very probably not available in Termux \nrepository. If there is any article which shows how to compile packages \nfor Termux, I AM able try to start this task. I have EFI compatible \ncomputer so I can install Ubuntu, Debian and I can also try to cross \ncompile for all supported architectures by Termux.\nBecause it is not simply possible to modify /etc/apt/sources.list\nAnd add new DEBIAN or Ubuntu repositories and install packaged by simply \nuse apt install or pkg install.\nCbin library is much different so it would not work.\nThis tasks can be done only from chroot environment.\n. Yes, may be, that this speech interruption is caused by The issue \nrelated to Speech-dispatcher. I have asked on respective Github threat \nabout this issue.\nThank you very much that you have given Me The direction and threat link.\nMay be, that it would be even possible to integrate Speech-dispatcher to \nTermux.\n. I AM thinking about one informatics science fiction activity.\nInstall Pulseaudio for termux in Termux.\nInstall Ubuntu to The chroot container by available Ubuntu script.\nMake something so Ubuntu would use Pulseaudio running on Termux outside \nThe chroot Ubuntu container.\nBut I Am afraid, that it is really programmers science fiction. That \nthis inter modular communication is not possible.\nNext possibilityis to find some Pulseaudio configuration, which will \nallow Me to directly use Pulseaudio from chroot container, from Ubuntu, \ndata will be available to Android client Simple Protocol player.\nBut how to find functioning approach without causing assertion inside \nPulseaudio C program.\nIt is very interesting task.\n. Dear Mr Plyushch,\nBecause I have successfully tried to install Debian by using script \nwhich have been prepared for Termux, and because this system  is \nmanaging sockets by The best way, I would like to try to set Pulseaudio \nin Termux, which would listen for example on port 4713 for connection.\nSo when I will export\nPULSE_SERVER=tcp:127.0.0.1:4713\nthat Pulseaudio which will run in Termux will listen and play The sound \nfrom app, which will be executed in Debian chroot container by using Proot.\nOr do you think, that this would require to modify C source codes for \nPulseaudio for Termux to work by this way?\nI want to test, if Speech-dispatcher and Espeak speech synthesizer will \nproduce The same interrupted speech like when I use Xserver XSDL and its \nbuild in pUlseaudio. Which is made by using functions inside SDL \nlibrary, which are able to communicate with Android sound devices.\nThank you very much for yours time and for yours patience.\nThere is toolittle safe Android devices rooting tools so I would \nsimplyrun Linux Deploy. But there is no guarantee that Speech \ninterruption will alsonot exist. And my skills are not so good so I \ncould prepare Linux kernel which would be directly booted from SD card \nand that all crucial chipson my Lenovo tablets will be supported after \nbooting. Mainly sound chip, correctly managed Battery and Cpu freq \nservice. So system resources would be directly accessed by only Linux \nkernel without sharing with Android.\n. Dear specialists,\nIs it possible to communicate with Pulseaudio for Termux from Linux \ndistribution, which run bz using Proot by using Unix sockets instead of \nInet sockets or TCP sockets?\nAre Unix sockets faster than TCP sockets?\nI have used Pulseaudio which run in Termux successfully intensively from \nDebian, which run in Chroot container by using Proot module for Termux.\nI AM even able to use many apps including Mozilla Firefox. And Orca \nproduces reliable speech without random crashes of Speech-dispatcher.\nBut I have found out, that I have one big enemy. Android kernel, which \nsuspend sound support too fast. So when I press left or right arrow key \nto spell The word, when I press right arrow key and if I press left or \nright arrow key after 150 MS or for bigger interval, system do not speak \nThe character, since sound driver gives sleep signal.\nDo you think, that is it possible to overcome this behaviour by play \nvery quite sound at The background?\nSpeech-dispatcher opens several Pulseaudio channels. May be, that \nproblem is even not inside Android kernel, that it is somewhere in other \nmodule.\nI would like to express my deepest possible endorsement and appreciation \nto all engaged developers,\nwho have prepared Pulseaudio for Termux. It is The only one sound \nserver, which run on many various Android versions without crashes and \nit support even so intensive sound task like text to speech synthesizers \nare producing.\nMy issue is not critical, it is rather plea for enhancement.\nReally thank you for yours work.\n. Please, would somebody of us try to give Me a little assistance, how to \nconfigure Debian stable on Termux so Audacity sound editor will be able \nto play by using build in Pulseaudio on Termux?\nOr I would had to configure and run real Pulseaudio server on Debian and \nsend data from Pulseaudio on Debian to Pulseaudio on Termux?\nFor now, thanks to working sockets communication, I can stream sounds \nfrom Linux distribution to Pulseaudio running in Termux by using The \nfollowing commands.\nI type this commands in Termux\npulseaudio --start --exit-idle-time=-1\npacmd load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1 \nauth-anonymous=1\nOn installed Debian by using Termux.\nI added The followingline to\n/etc/profile\nexport PULSE_SERVER=\\127.0.0.1\nI can use Espeak speech engine and other synthesizers, I can even run \nAudacity, but not from Ubuntu, but from Debian stable. But I do not \nknow,how to force Audacity to play by using PUlseaudio which run on \nTermux environment.\nI Am aware, that I have very probably A zero chance to record, so I \nwould like toplay.\nAny advices will be very welcomed.\nThere is no accessible Android alternativefor Audacity, which support \nmany many keyboard short cuts and Audacity even support multi tracking \nmode and also accessible with keyboard short cuts.\nThank you very much for yours advices.\n.

Just found this page that should have the recipe to resolve this issue, under the \"Handle runtime configuration changes\" section. \nWhat I don't understand though, is that the official \"My files\" and \"Samsung Internet\" apps for example, do restart too when you open them on one mode while they're being used on the other mode. In \"My files\", you even lose the directory you're exploring, the app goes back to the files home screen... Did Samsung forget to implement the Dex best practices for its own apps ?\n[edit] Just tried with other apps : the phone app keeps a number while switching mode. The email app won't lose the new email adress you're setting up. The message app will keep a draft at the screen. So yes, Samsung probably didn't implement the mode switches for all its apps.\n. ",

    "iamahuman": "(WIP). @xeffyr I'm very surprised to find that it actually did work, since the code wasn't tested because I was coding it in Termux itself(!) and didn't look thoroughly throughout the code for verification. Meanwhile it needs additional fixes to the com.termux.view.TerminalView.onScreenUpdated() method, specifically it should update the mTopRow field accordingly when mActiveTranscriptRows value decreases back to 0.\nAbout the reset part, I thought about it but I'm not sure if it's the best since although libvte-based terminal emulators does seem to also clear scrollback for the reset sequence, it's not entirely universal and macOS' Terminal.App doesn't. Still, I'll look into it once @fornwall becomes active here again.. @fornwall Fixed and rebased on 7f4df8328cfd4209b1c98d558e6274fd5a67f729 .. PROTIP: Before this code gets released, repeatedly clear the screen and toggle the soft keyboard alternately to get all the scrollback cleared. Reducing the font size (i.e. larger terminal size / text density) accelerates this process. The clearing part could of course be scripted so that all you need to do is to just bring up and down the soft keyboard.. See also: https://github.com/AndreRH/hangover. ",
    "Amarjit3": "Many thanks for both of your quick responses. It sounds like the blog instructions may not be correct. I will follow the tutorials tomorrow and provide some logs where possible.\n@Grimler91 - you are essentially correct. The essence of what I am trying to do (the same as the two blogs) is to run Termux on the Chromebook which runs in Android space and SSH into Termux using the NaSSH app which runs in 'Chrome space' on the same machine. \nHopefully following these tutorials will show that it is possible.. I am attempting to SSH into Termux using the Chrome SSH app, installed on the same machine (Asus C302 chromebook). To recap, I did a clean install of Termux and carried out the instructions below:\napt update\napt upgrade\npkg install proot openssh\nThen, as I need access to my Downloads folder on my Chromebook:\ntermux-setup-storage\nAs per the instructions in the blog I created a directory that could store the SSH keys:\ntermux-chroot\nmkdir -p /storage/emulated/0/Download/devbox/ssh\nln -s /storage/emulated/0/Download/devbox /home/devbox\nI then exited chroot and I generated the SSH keys:\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f  /home/devbox/ssh/id_rsa\nThe public key is then added to authorized_keys file:\ncat /home/devbox/ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /home/.ssh/authorized_keys\nTo find my IP address and user name I used:\nwhoami\nifconfig arc0 | awk '/inet /{print $2}'\nI then started sshd.\nI am able to login using SSH, however, I am asked for a password which I cannot avoid (as per my first post). I have to specify a user on the app (it won't let be log in otherwise). The FAQ for the Chrome app also says to include BOTH keys (which I did). There is no log available on the Chrome SSH app which I can access but I looked at my log on Termux and found:\nBind to port on 8022 on :: failed Address already in use\nBind to port on 8022 failed. Address already in use\nCannot bind any address\nI had to use chroot to create the symlinks and write the keys to the local storage on the Chromebook but did not need it to start sshd.\nAs per the responses to my to my first post, I then tried following the tutorials and got the same errors but this time I could not even log in through SSH (the Chrome app said could not connect).\nIs anyone able to advise or has accomplished this?. Thank you both so much for your help.\nI carried out the following commands as suggested\n\npkg install openssh\npasswd\n\nI then made sure there was no sshd running as below:\n\nMeans that you didn't kill the old daemon before starting the logging one. Run ps and kill  where is the PID of sshd as outputed from ps.\n\nI then logged in using the Chrome SSH app using the IP address (localhost doesn't work), username and port. I did have to reinstall the app but it works fine. The Android SSH app I have also works (ConnectBot) using localhost rather than the IP address. \nYour help is much appreciated!!. Yes, many thanks..

After the reload (and restart phone), ^n performs a \"cursor down\" in the first two sessions (as expected) and nothing in the third. the \"volume\" key has no effect in all cases even with \"crtl\".\nIs there possibly a relation between the two errors and can you repeat them?\n\n.

Unfortunately with a bug too:\n$ termux-media-player play check.jpg\nPrepare failed.: status=0x1\nWith the gallery and fotos apps the file check.jpg is displayed without problem. Can I get an answer from you or should I ask someone else or open a new issue?. Thank you both\nand sorry - I need new glasses. with ctrl shortcut works as expected.

    "vpelletier": "I could reproduce this issue on a Lenovo YT3-X90X (Tab3 Pro), which is long-unsupported by Lenovo and hence will not receive any new android version (6.0.1).\nTo reproduce:\n- open f-droid\n- install termux (0.66 is latest as of this writing)\n- immediately upon install dialog exit (back to f-droid), launcher3 crashes and shows the modal window, and the device becomes essentially unusable (any not-already-opened app becomes unreachable)\nIf termux is knowingly incompatible with that version of launcher3, shouldn't it explicitly mention it in the package, which would then prevent f-droid from upgrading it and rendering the device essentially unusable (not a brick, but a device where no app can be started without debugging seems very broken to me) ?\nEDIT: downgrading to 0.65 is enough to not trigger the issue.. ...and re-reading this report, I may be misunderstanding an important thing: is launcher3 and android thing, or a lenovo thing ?. I of course do not expect Termux to fix a completely foreign and proprietary peice of software, and I do not think I asked otherwise.\nBut there seem to be a large quantity of android applications out there which do not trigger this crippling bug.\nDoes android supporting vector graphics mandate them ? Is there a way to ship both, in a way that archaic and unsupported software like launcher3 would find the one they are happy with instead of falling over themselves ?. > Feel free to investigate and propose a pull request.\nRight now I am not able to investigate further (traveling). Before leaving, I could get a logcat output showing launcher3 failing on a vector/bitmap conversion error. But I do not have the exact stack trace not error message available to me now. FWIW, I did not have a termux shortcut on the main screen, so just having the app installed (and hence listed in the menu behind the \"all apps\" button) is enough to get launcher3 to crash, even without opening that menu.\n\nIf someone wants to test, I can build Termux app with reverted\n\nGiven my currently limited debugging & recovery abilities, I'm reluctant to experiment with proposed fix. I intend to when I'm back in my normal environment. Which should be in around 2 weeks.\n\nBut anyway, crashing launcher with vector icon is something.... nonsense.\n\nI cannot agree more.\nOn a very tangential note, if any developer wants to be able to reproduce the bug first hand, the Lenovo Tab3 Pro is quite a nice tablet (modulo being end-of-life, and a still rather high price tag). Its killer feature for me is the built-in video projector. While it has poor resolution (not advertised anywhere, I think it is around 640x480) and is not extremely bright, I find it very suitable for watching movies in bed, projected on the ceiling. It seems the hardware is UEFI x64, so once usb booting is enabled (by unlocking the bootloader, there is at least one video on running ubuntu on a Tab3 Plus) the hackability should be high. I have not yet brought myself to doing this though, for just VLC + projection it is working well enough.

Hmm, the simplest solution would be to ensure that we aren't resolving the same path as the one we just checked and tried to canonicalize.\nHowever, an alternative solution would be to call readlink via JNI and then verify that path exists before returning. Although, I'm not sure which you'd prefer? I believe that the former may be better due to the reduction in race conditions.\nAlso, cd without any parameters will return home.. @xeffyr thanks for picking up that issue. I've just pushed a fix now.\nI've also tested it with multiple levels of symlink indirection on Android 8.0.0 e.g.\nmkdir test; ln -s test test2; ln -s test2 test3; cd test3\nRemoving ../test will result in the new session having the default cwd, otherwise using the original test directory.. Just verified that this still canonicalizes the previous path, resolving all symlinks.\nWithin shell 1:\n% mkdir test; cd test; cd /proc/11475/cwd\n% pwd\n/proc/11475/cwd\nWithin a new shell:\n% pwd\n/data/data/com.termux/files/home/test\nUpon doing the same with the test directory removed, after the second cd, shell 2 goes to Termux's home..

    "evan0greenup": "@xeffyr , according to \"Interface must be implemented on both sides otherwise it will be useless because applications cannot automatically see and use them.\" of your sentence. It indicates that there would be a possibility if a certain file manager project is willing to implemented a interface.\nReference Implementation:\nHere is the file manager project android-file-manager\nThe author seems willing to implement the interface. Because he shows that if Termux can provide a viable way, he will make a try.\nIt will be awesome, if this feature can be implemented.\nTwo example you provided are proprietary software, so they are unchangeable. but the example I provide is an open source project under GPL. So everything is possible. \nPlease consider to reopen the issue! Thanks. . @xeffyr, I have already submitted a feature request to that author. So just tell him you are from Termux. You can have some conversation and determine the possibility to implement this feature. Hope this feature can come out as soon as possible.. ",
    "caleb-allen": "Is this a potential use case for Dynamic Delivery using App Bundles?\nA dynamic feature module could be either a bundled group of related packages, or, if still feasible, each separate package. The submitted app bundle would include all available packages, where the base installation is only core packages, and pkg install would request the dynamic feature from Google Play. \nThis would likely require a pretty robust build system to keep the Google Play listing's packages in parity with termux-packages, perhaps as a separate listing from termux-core.\nI see this as a way to comply with Google Play while still allowing a package manager-like function, potentially with another mechanism for installations outside of Google Play or from source that more closely resembles the current mechanism.. Sure--I supposed my suggestion was intended more as a solution to the SELinux policy restrictions by using Google Play, but it does hinge on 1) the ability to ship additional executables (I suspect their example of games would make that true, but it is still a question) and 2) reliance on Google Play as a complete distribution system and being subject to their rules and whims.\nIt's a difficult problem, no doubt. I suspect that the timing of App Bundles and the native executable restriction policy are not entirely unrelated, and a solution to downloading and executing arbitrary native code without going through Google Play isn't immediately obvious.\n\nbundling groups of related packages inside of shared uid apks signed with the same key.\n\nSeems to be the quickest and simplest solution at this point, with the above mentioned restrictions which may annihilate realistic usability..

    "corbinlc": "What if you bundled PRoot (and busybox and a bare minimum of what is required to get a PRooted system setup and running) with the app itself and then had everything run through PRoot.  Could PRoot be modified to allow executing outside of the lib directory?  It has been proven twice before to be able to get around limitations of the sdcard being mounted noexec.\nThis is the most recent example of how PRoot can defeat noexec: https://github.com/termux/proot/commit/ebcfe01744a4a288df38f76c24a60ae8ab978240\nNotice what is not blocked here: https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/sepolicy/+/804149\nThere would be a performance impact of course, but maybe it allows the party to go on.  \nI work on UserLAnd and we always use PRoot.  This is where my mind went when I heard of this limitation.  Thought I would share.. PRoot will certainly execute from the apps lib directory, just like busybox did above, but you will need to play with the proot version I mentioned above.  It is @michalbednarski 's work, so he might be able to comment on how suited he thinks it might be for this purpose.. @xeffyr I guess that makes sense, since PRoot already deals with execve.  The new work is only needed for files on a noexec partition.  That is great news for everyone.. @thestinger interesting comment about them potentially removing the ability to mmap(PROT_EXEC) for files outside of the app's lib directory in the future.  I guess we live to fight another day (or more likely more than a year).  \nDo you know if they are planning on preventing mprotect(PROT_EXEC)?  Where do you see the audit call you mentioned related to mmap(PROT_EXEC)?  I don't know where the these exist in the Android source tree.. This is great info @thestinger. ",
