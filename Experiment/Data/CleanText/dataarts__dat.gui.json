Okay, Google Code page is now officially gone.\n. I'm not sure why we'd want to do this. Please comment with more details if you'd like to reopen.\n. Thanks! I've gone a slightly different route to fix the problem (922de644599ad63149bd9b686a252e5e6164d83a), which will accomplish the same thing as your code, but uses some other functions already in place.\n.

This has been fixed in e129e08b9d4ea7023873528ca61f49f2ef897b4b by setting \"max-width: 100%;\" for the bar.\n. Thanks for your help. I've incorporated your change, with a few tweaks:\n- debounce method lives in common.js\n- debounce method calls function at start, then blocks for timeout (rather than only running after timeout ends)\n. This has been fixed in 6f0fcb64f5b3d3eee2c49204819d382a4e684f3a\n. I've added a process to build the CSS file as a separate file, so that users with CSP enable can include it.\nUnfortunately wrapping the injection code in a try/catch doesn't seem to suppress the error. But if you include the external CSS, everything works as it should.\nChanged in: dbd80251f3db9cd2526ba8626f9f836617e2550f\n. Thanks! I've slightly modified and merged your code into develop 0399ab6\n. This issues is similar to #101. It has been fixed in ca19030081d8039d5f6b25ca399caa029dd2afc7\n. Thanks for the bug and example.

Thanks for the bug report!\n. Hey Wills, thanks for the great write up and JSBin. I'll get a fix into the next update\n. Thanks again Wills. I've fixed the bugs and added better string formatting for the various color labels\n. Here's an example with all the Color formats that dat.gui accepts:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/8cffyzL1/\n. Sorry for the confusion. The version on npm isn't an official release by our team, its a fork of v0.5.1 created by @korczis that he renamed to v0.6.1. We've since incorporated most of the changes he made into the official repo, as well as some new fixes as v0.6.0, and then a few recent fixes made v0.6.1.\nThis repo should be the most up to date (and hopefully, functional version). The next version number increment will hopefully clear up the confusion.\n. Can you share a jsFiddle and/or screenshot? I'm not sure I follow. I'm having a look at this in Chrome 57.0.2987 and Safari 10.0.3 (12602.4.8), but haven't been able to re-produce it. Are you still experiencing it?. I've changed it back to './build/dat.gui.js'. Thanks for filing the issue. Hopefully you've been able to make some progress on creating a canvas. If not, here is some general \"getting started with HTML5 Canvas\" info to check out: https://www.sitepoint.com/html5-canvas-tutorial-introduction/. No, sorry.. fixed in 0.6.3. I've made a change that I think addresses this. Can you try out the develop version?. https://rawgit.com/dataarts/dat.gui/develop/build/dat.gui.js. Thanks for reporting. What browser & OS is this?. Thanks for reporting this. The issue has been fixed. Not sure when it was fixed, but I can confirm that Boolean fields fire onFinishChange\n. The problem was caused by a bug that appeared when you use .listen() on the ComboBox control.  It's been fixed in the latest version.\nExample: https://jsfiddle.net/uqqa6e0h/5/\n. v0.6.0 is using Universal Module Declaration, so AMD should work now\n. Now using webpack for build, it wraps the module with UMD. See #78 \n. fixed in 6f0fcb64f5b3d3eee2c49204819d382a4e684f3a\n. Hmm.. there were two scrolling issues. \n- One is when the GUI is longer than the page, the GUI itself has a scrollbar. This is still broken, and is described in #105 \n- The scrolling issue I fixed (or thought I did), was when the HTML page is super long or wide. In this case, when scrolling the page down or right, the color picker and slider were breaking.\nWhat issue are you seeing?\n. This has been fixed. Thank you for the clear example and bumb. Thanks! Your fix has been incorporated in 6322ce6 and merged\n. Cheers! Fix merged at 8ae2c7cda9b882422321487ecc869f67523fcc58, updated to include @mrdoob's suggested tweak\n.

    "donpinkus": "Yes, an API doc would be extremely useful.\nI'm assuming for someone that has been working with dat.gui for a bit, the API is obvious. \nFor people just starting out with it (such as myself), I don't want to hunt around codepen or the limited tutorial site linked above, just for an example of how to add a control for a simple variable:\nvar name = 'Don';\nvar gui = new dat.GUI();\ngui.add('name', 'Label for name input');\n^ that's invalid syntax... but there's no place to lookup what the correct syntax is, because there is no API doc.. @hyunsooda - I'm not answering your question. I'm agreeing with the need for an API doc. . Update - been playing with dat.gui a lot. I'll start an API readme doc soon and hopefully people will add to it.\nIf there's anyone with more than 2 weeks experience using dat.gui that would like to volunteer to help out, please comment.
