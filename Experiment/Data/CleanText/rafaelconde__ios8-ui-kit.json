Thanks Mikko,\nThose guys did an awesome job, no doubt about it, and I got some ideas for elements to add in the future from them.\nThanks for sharing \ud83d\udc4d\n\u2014\nRafa\nOn Wed, Sep 24, 2014 at 8:10 AM, Mikko Tapionlinna\nnotifications@github.com wrote:\n\nThank you for the great resource!\nI had an idea for if you want to add more content and do not want to take screenshots yourself.

Hum... opens just fine here on my machine. Are you running the latest version of Sketch (3.1)?\n. I'll update the README file to say that 3.1 is required. Thanks guys \ud83d\udc4d\n. I completely agree, and I plan to do so right after I get an iPhone 6 for myself (so I can get the screenshots the way I need them). \n\nIn the meantime I did the Homescreen for the 6 and 6 Plus, it's something :p \n.
