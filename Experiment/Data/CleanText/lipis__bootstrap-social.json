    "lipis": "It's fixed now.. thank you! I haven't touched for quite some time but now it's up to date...\n. To achieve that.. I would simply include the Bootstrap stuff in one .less file and probably call it no-bootstrap-social.less.. is that ok?\n. I think I'll drop this one.. it doesn't make much sense to copy all the dependencies for the buttons from bootstrap just to make it Bootstrapless, something that is called bootstrap-social :)\n. Thank you very nice..!! :)\n. Thanks\n. Thanks!\n. Other than having the master branch am I missing anything else in the bower.json file?\nhttps://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/blob/gh-pages/bower.json\n. Yes that was my plan to have only one branch...\nSo you're telling me that I don't have to do anything else regarding that issue?! Can I skip the creation of the master branch..? I just tried to install it and it worked normally with the latest 4.0.5 version..\n. I never used SCSS in real world but of course I don't mind including that as well.. It's not like this project will change dramatically until the version 4.0 or something.. So yeah! Bring it..\n. Perfect.. thanks man!\n. Can you create a JSFiddle or something with the problem?! I really hate !important and I'm wondering why is that needed..\n. In order to fix this problem few !important here and there will just make it more complicated because Bootstrap has many rules that are applied to the <a> of the navbar.\nI would suggest you to change the links to <button> and handle them using JS.. by doing that you just need to adjust the width/height of the icon to match the Flatly theme because you're not using the .less files..\nCheck this example here.. and notice that I have very few changes:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/xm5Dr/6/\n\n. Just in case you want to avoid using JavaScript for the <button> because I changed from <a> you can wrap it inside a <form> and simulate the normal link like this:\n<form action=\"/login/facebook\">  \n  <button class=\"btn btn-block btn-social btn-facebook\">\n    <i class=\"fa fa-facebook\"></i>\n    Sign in with Facebook\n  </button>\n</form>\nThe above code is more or less similar to the \n<button class=\"btn btn-block btn-social btn-facebook\" href=\"/login/facebook?\">\n  <i class=\"fa fa-facebook\"></i>\n  Sign in with Facebook\n</button>\n. Something like that: http://jsfiddle.net/aHs8J/1/ (resize to bigger screen to see them aligned..)\nIf you don't want to collapse into stack change the divs to col-xs-* and they will always going to be aligned..\n. That's the idea at least of course you can have your own divs and justify them as you like.. I'm just showing the fact that the buttons are quite flexible and support these kind of things..\n. @samdunne Does the above solves your problem? Otherwise you'll have to be more specific on what you want..\n. Actually the way I did the buttons they are reacting the same way as normal buttons in Bootstrap.. so yes it very doable without changing anything.. just following the Bootstrap's convention:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/aHs8J/3/\n. Chrome & Safari work nicely.. Firefox does something \"stupid\"... If you find the cause of error would be nice.. I'll be able to spend some time with it later this week..!\n. It looks like Firefox has issues with the display: table-cell; with a combination of position:relative and position: absolute; trick.. :(\n. Stupid Firefox.. with a small fix I could fix the icons only justified buttons if you're happy with them you can use that (where the line-height depends on your theme):\n.btn-social-icon :first-child {\n  position: relative;   \n  line-height: 32px;\n}\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/aHs8J/5/\n. @samdunne Did you solve this one anyhow?\n. I used the #0072B1 color from the Brand Book I hope that's the correct one instead of the secondary color..\nhttps://playfoursquare.s3.amazonaws.com/press/foursquare-brandbook.pdf\n. I will have to update the instructions.. But if you download the whole project as is.. and open the index.html do you see the buttons? \n. good luck\n. I understand you won't be able to sign in anywhere using the RSS feed and you wanted for something else.. but I'm not willing to start adding random buttons to this list.. it is already too big :)\nAlso as you already noticed it is not that hard to add a new button especially if you are using LESS or SCSS..\nIf you are about to add RSS on your website consider using #FF6600 for it.. it looks more popular for RSS..\n. it should work now.. let me know if not..\n. hm.. I don't like the dot in the name.. can we change that so it is consistent?\n. I can understand why and yes that's how the jQuery does it but because everywhere else is with the dash I think I would prefer to keep it consistent and I can see that there are already couple of them that are like that in the list :)\nSo can we keep it as the original name?! :dancer:\n. Awesome man.. thanks..!\nWasn't aware of the project.. I wonder who is paying for all that?!\n. Read already the about page as well... Nice job..!! Good luck man...\n. I will update eventually my README to include this links as well..\n. Added :)\n. You can't really sign in with YouTube.. is a Google login :) I understand that you might want it for sharing or something.. but at one point we'll have to draw a line.. since it's very very easy to extend it if you're using .less or .sass by adding one line..\n. Well not really to the core project.. because it doesn't really exist in Font Awesome.. but you can find it (http://fontello.com/#search=lanyrd) and use it with this project.. it shouldn't be a problem!\n. In one of my other projects we decided to go with #2672ec for windows instead of #0072c6.. do you mind showing the sources of your decisions for the colors?\n. https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init-auth/pull/10\n. Oki.. I found the OpenID.. http://wiki.openid.net/f/openid-logo-guidelines.pdf \n. The #2672ec can also be found here: https://login.live.com\n. I think is better to use #2672ec since it can be found in the official Microsoft accounts login page.. \nSo if you could please make that change and also instead of btn-windows say it btn-microsoft (because it's a microsoft account and not windows) and finally put them all in alphabetical order :)\n. Recently they changed it to Microsoft Account so that's why I also want to start using that instead of Windows.. which makes more sense if you get from the rest of the brands when trying to login with their accounts.. If it was still hotmail, that would be another story but they want to unify all these accounts into one and I think they made the right decision for the name..! Having said that I think FA should have an alias for fa-microsoft :)\nAs for the OpenID.. it looks like the guides are saying either black on white or white on black... but I still think it would be still ok with their normal color..! As with this project I also want to have the collection of their official colors...\n. But I didn't think about the consistency because it's fa-windows... I'll think about it and merge them tomorrow.. thanks for the PR..\n. Do you mind updating the bootstrap-social.scss for consistency reasons as well?! \n. Awesome!\n. Thanks..\n. you're right.. you can submit a PR if you like..\n. thanks\n. I used to have it.. https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/commit/8ad5c0504d86464217e73160098228b6e2a4c46d but I removed it because they don't support an official OAuth API.. It is not that hard to add new buttons and I think we have already too many.. Having said that maybe in the future I'll add it.. :D \n. Yes, sharing is totally valid case.. especially for the squared ones.. So I might add it in the near future.. when I'm back from vacations..\n. https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/commit/918fc55c3c938377a7618ec0f115846e50d4b883\n. Not sure if I'm going to add more at the moment.. but from where did you get the colors..? can you provide the source..?\n. @chester1000 My main reason is because it's super easy to add any new button you want if you are using Less or SCSS.. If you are not using any of those.. you probably should.. but that's another story.\nThe second reason is where should I stop?! How many buttons should I possibly add into that project?!\nI could maybe add as many as possible (until we'll run out of FA icons, but maybe then add other icon vendors) but then it's going to be too much deleting for people that only want a few.. :)\nOn the other hand.. with this project I also wanted to make sure that all the colors that are used.. are as official as possible :) So maybe that's a good reason to just add more buttons to have it at least as a reference for the colors.. but I just realised that there is this website: http://brandcolors.net/\nSo I'm not sure :) What do you think? Should I just continue adding more and more buttons?! Is it really needed?\n. > even with hundreds of buttons size of this library will be negligible\nNot exactly, as every new button adds a bit less than 1KB to the minified CSS, it won't be exactly negligible..\nBut maybe after all I'll start adding more just to have them as references.. haven't make up my mind yet.. and it's a bit late here :) Will think about it.. maybe I'll add one file that has only the top 3 vendors and all of them in the rest.. :)\n. Well none of these properties are actually used in Bootstrap 3 as you can see here: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3.2.0/less/buttons.less nor in this project.. so I don't see any point of actually including these properties..\n. I think it was there because you can use any other icons library\n. I'm on vacations now but I will fix that when I'm back.. or you can create a PR..\nI was also thinking about creating a polymer component for it, just started playing with it.. so I might get some ideas from you! Thanks\n. Never thought of that one.. how would you use the social sharing button with the dropdown?! What's the use case?\n. Yes I got it.. :) Thanks.. I will take a look at one point and leave that issue open.. as I'm a bit busy these days it will have to wait..\n. you can't just update the color #30 \n. Yeap :) That would happen if you rotate the element that has the border..\nhttps://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/blob/gh-pages/bootstrap-social.less#L31\nI just updated it so it will affect only the direct first child... so you could use something like that to have the icon rotated...\nhtml\n<a class=\"btn btn-block btn-social btn-twitter\">\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-twitter fa-spin\"></i></div>\n  Sign in with Twitter\n</a>\nhttp://jsbin.com/gojap/6/\n. It doesn't work nicely with the btn-lg  but you can take it from there and override the font-size or whatever you want for your own special case.. \n. are they all there?! On mobile now..\n. Just include them in the repo.. not sure I understood your problem.. if everything works locally it should work..\n. So this one for sure will be closed here :)\n. fixed now.. thanks\n. As I'm mentioning in the README don't update the .css file..\np.s. Maybe I'll have to add the contribution file.. :)\n. Plus I think you are wrong.. as this is exactly the color that you deleted..\n\n. Not really... sorry :/\n. Are you using Less?! If so.. just add a new button by choosing the right color.. https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/blob/gh-pages/bootstrap-social.less#L95-L114\n. I want to split the core from the rest and then maybe start adding more buttons.. but at the moment I already have too many for the core functionality..\n. If you guys using Less or SASS then it's super easy to just change the color and add the icon that is not part of this library anyway.. and if you're not using Less or SASS.. then you should :)\n. I am sorry.. but I think it is very clear here: https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/blob/gh-pages/.editorconfig#7\n. Actually I'm not sure if I will add all these icons anyway.. as like I mentioned before there are already too many and it's super easy to add new ones if using Less/SASS :) But when folks are getting only the CSS is kind of annoying to get a massive file with 95% useless stuff..\nIf I'll break down the core icons and the rest then maybe.. \n. Yes no problem and I can see the need of adding new icons...\nBut looking forward.. why are you changing the CSS and adding new rules.. and all that stuff when this PR is for adding new icons..? if there is something that needs to be changed make a separate one..\n. 505 additions and 324 deletions\nFor 3 new icons is just doesn't make any sense :) sorry\n. That's all I have: https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/blob/gh-pages/bootstrap-social.scss\n. it should work if you are using bootstrap  and it's variables.. the whole idea is that it will match exactly the normal btn buttons\n. No Stylus support..\n. Hmmm... that's a tricky one.. cause in a way it belongs to category social :) you could get it and rename it.. but eventually if become popular it will be blocked again.. not much we can do I guess\n. @gameguy43 Thanks for the research, the follow up and the links.. Of course the icons are not part of this lib, but nevertheless I believe even if we're going to change the prefix they will do something else to block them, as they are blocking all the social stuff.. even when it's actually needed and not intended to spam or annoy people.. I'm not sure if there is any way to bring that subject to AdBlocker or something, as these buttons started and intended to be used as sign in buttons..\n. I think I'll just close this one.. not much we can do.. right?\n. But I have it like that.. no?\nhttps://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/blob/gh-pages/bootstrap-social.less#L22\n. Oh I see.. in the generated CSS the space is gone..\n. looks good.. thanks\n. The reason that I have google-plus is because it all started with the same exactly code as with Font Awesome.. But maybe you're right..\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/commit/b53226d35592aa0169575e9e1b5f5c549a1145f3\n. Are you sure it's from this library?!\n. is it?\n. yep #57 \n. :+1: \n. You can add any icon you want.. even if it's not from here: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/ if you are using Less or SASS..\n. Can you create a PR for the composer.json?\n. sorry.. \n. No it's not maintained by me.. I didn't add it there.. is it possible to remove the version from the package.json so it will get the releases, as it's happening with bower.json\n. How do I get ownership?\n. I already send an email to the owner of it.. of course there are no bad feelings or anything :) I'm actually flattered with those things.. :dancer: \n. I'm the owner now https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap-social :+1: so the next question is how do I update it?\n. actually if you could submit a PR would be the best ATM :) Try to keep it as close to bower.json so it will be easier to maintain it later on..\n. \n. #28 \n. not sure how though :)\n. :) Any idea on how to update the readme?\n. I'll have to pass on this one.. as it requires more maintenance..\n. It's only IE 8.. http://caniuse.com/#feat=css3-colors :)\n. :+1: \n. I tried to have it fixed :) https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design/issues/151\n. Nice.. will merge it once I'm back :) :palm_tree:\n. According to the link you provided.. the color should be: #f4731c\nhttp://v.ok.ru/images/logo/download/ok_logo_sign_orange.svg\n. Can you squash the commits as well?\n. :+1: \n. Icons are not part of this repo.. I'm using the Font-Awesome as an example.. so whenever they will get an update: https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/7357\n. bong.. I will in the near future break up the source files to core and the rest and I will start adding more icons.. but in reality the only thing that you need to do in order to use it in your own project is to find the right color and then:\nless\n.btn-youtube       { .btn-social(#c0ffee); }\nor\nsass\n.btn-youtube        { @include btn-social(#c0ffee); }\n. thanks! could you do it for the https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css as well?\n. could be both I guess... :)\n. once it's closer to the RC1 :)\n. Maybe.. \ud83d\udc83      \n. Can't really do much about that.. If you can manage to add a normal button in a dropdown on Bootstrap.. then this one will be fixed as well :)\n. Yes.. didn't want to have directories because there is only one file per type... but maybe I'll split the files into more to have the basic ones in one and then then all.. so we can start adding as many new icons/colors as we want :) WDYT?\n(the version will change for sure)\n. https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/commit/56dab131741b025891e4512e36c18b7e26bd1486\n. :dancer: \n. As the name suggests.. it's based on Bootstrap.. so it assumes that you including it when working with source: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3.3.6/less/mixins/buttons.less#L6\n. np.. good luck.\n. are you still interested in this one?\n. It's not meant to be inside the dropdown menu and I don't think that I will support this out of the box..\n. this and many others.. I closed all of the requests.. as I will try to split up things or write detailed instructions on how to add more buttons in less or sass :) no need to grow the CSS size..\n. you have to compile it with something to generate the CSS.. but if you are thinking of updating the css for this project in order to include the SO.. then you don't have to waste your time.. \n. I don't get why people are getting mad.. don't waste your time to generate the CSS.. https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social#pull-requests\nPlus if you really wanted help.. it's the first time that you are referring to webpack and sass-loader.. there are hundreds of different ways of compiling stuff to CSS.. how are we supposed to know how to help?\n. I'm generating it using Less\n. In theory if you are loading the whole thing.. it should work.. here is an example of something similar in Less.. \n. StackOverflow  is one way to find out if you are already searched the whole internet :)\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask\n. :+1:\n. @janwillemvd done :)\n. So avoid using it :)\n. can you have a JSFiddle with your issue?\n. https://jsfiddle.net/qj8w4Lq4/4/ You have to remove the btn-block..\n. out of the scope.. sorry\n. and that's fine.. but this lib has nothing to do with icons..\n. If you feel like editing the files right away and issuing a PR would be awesome..\n. So I'm not sure... do you want it or not?\n. T\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0448\u044c..\n. :D Will do later.. while I understand russian it's hard to type it for me :) I'll update it eventually..  and as for Yandex I want to refactor the whole thing to start adding all of the requested ones in a separate file.. one of these days... :)\n. #127 \n. \ud83c\udf7b \n. where should it point to then?\n. Soon I'll have to check what is going to happen with BS4 :)\n. Because the icon was too big.. But the actual icons are not part of this lib so feel free to use whatever you like :)\n. I'm back.. so this week I promise to follow up :) Don't be sorry.. this has to be fixed..\n. #127 They all look nice.. I didn't change much though :)\n. I think now I realised what happened.. :)\n\n. I'll just going to close this issue :D\n. we all been there.. don't worry about it :)\n. are  you including the Bootstrap source files?\n. well.. here is your answer :)\n. Yes.. if you are using SASS files to compile then you need to use Bootstrap source files.. and not the compiled ones as the $line-height-computed is coming from Bootstrap dependency..\n. I don't know if you noticed.. but the project is called bootstrap-social didn't that gave a couple of clues that it might require Bootstrap to work with?!\nAlso as everyone knows people that can't read or they assume things that shouldn't assume won't make it far in their life.. \n. Internet is a funny place..\n. > but requiring bootstrap is like opening an ice cream shop and only selling a horrible tasting vanilla with amazing sprinkles.\nSo do you think still that I insulted you..?!\nFlash news: I'm not requiring anything.. it's a free fucking world.. RTFM and take it from there..\n. there are better ways to address the issue without having the stupid/immature attitude like: \"As everyone knows, bootstrap is a no-no because of it's bad practice\" for something that has 100K followers, etc, etc.. so learn how the world works first and then start making these statements..\n. fixed. It looks like you are right :) Thanks man... css or maybe put it in files instead.. where we could include all the source files?. then let's just remove it completely.. :). jsut remove this line.. if you are still around :). Don't.. this lib is only the CSS.. it's up to you what you are going to use for icons... aliasies and the icons in general are not part of this repo.. you can add any icon you want for any button... too many packages :) #71 it requires maintenance.. . icons are not part of this repo... thanks!. it's been requested before... It's based on Bootstrap.. so you are just using Bootstrap's classes for sizes, btn-sm, btn-lg, etc... It's fixed now.. thank you! I haven't touched for quite some time but now it's up to date...\n. To achieve that.. I would simply include the Bootstrap stuff in one .less file and probably call it no-bootstrap-social.less.. is that ok?\n. I think I'll drop this one.. it doesn't make much sense to copy all the dependencies for the buttons from bootstrap just to make it Bootstrapless, something that is called bootstrap-social :)\n. Thank you very nice..!! :)\n. Thanks\n. Thanks!\n.

So I might add it in the near future.. when I'm back from vacations..\n. https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/commit/918fc55c3c938377a7618ec0f115846e50d4b883\n. Not sure if I'm going to add more at the moment.. but from where did you get the colors..? can you provide the source..?\n. @chester1000 My main reason is because it's super easy to add any new button you want if you are using Less or SCSS.. If you are not using any of those.. you probably should.. but that's another story.\nThe second reason is where should I stop?! How many buttons should I possibly add into that project?!\nI could maybe add as many as possible (until we'll run out of FA icons, but maybe then add other icon vendors) but then it's going to be too much deleting for people that only want a few.. :)\nOn the other hand.. with this project I also wanted to make sure that all the colors that are used.. are as official as possible :) So maybe that's a good reason to just add more buttons to have it at least as a reference for the colors.. but I just realised that there is this website: http://brandcolors.net/\nSo I'm not sure :) What do you think? Should I just continue adding more and more buttons?! Is it really needed?\n. > even with hundreds of buttons size of this library will be negligible\nNot exactly, as every new button adds a bit less than 1KB to the minified CSS, it won't be exactly negligible..\nBut maybe after all I'll start adding more just to have them as references.. haven't make up my mind yet.. and it's a bit late here :) Will think about it.. maybe I'll add one file that has only the top 3 vendors and all of them in the rest.. :)\n. Well none of these properties are actually used in Bootstrap 3 as you can see here: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3.2.0/less/buttons.less nor in this project.. so I don't see any point of actually including these properties..\n. I think it was there because you can use any other icons library\n. I'm on vacations now but I will fix that when I'm back.. or you can create a PR..\nI was also thinking about creating a polymer component for it, just started playing with it.. so I might get some ideas from you! Thanks\n. Never thought of that one.. how would you use the social sharing button with the dropdown?! What's the use case?\n. Yes I got it.. :) Thanks.. I will take a look at one point and leave that issue open.. as I'm a bit busy these days it will have to wait..\n. you can't just update the color #30 \n. Yeap :) That would happen if you rotate the element that has the border..\nhttps://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/blob/gh-pages/bootstrap-social.less#L31\nI just updated it so it will affect only the direct first child... so you could use something like that to have the icon rotated...\nhtml\n<a class=\"btn btn-block btn-social btn-twitter\">\n  <div><i class=\"fa fa-twitter fa-spin\"></i></div>\n  Sign in with Twitter\n</a>\nhttp://jsbin.com/gojap/6/\n. It doesn't work nicely with the btn-lg  but you can take it from there and override the font-size or whatever you want for your own special case.. \n. are they all there?! On mobile now..\n. Just include them in the repo.. not sure I understood your problem.. if everything works locally it should work..\n. So this one for sure will be closed here :)\n. fixed now.. thanks\n. As I'm mentioning in the README don't update the .css file..\np.s. Maybe I'll have to add the contribution file.. :)\n. Plus I think you are wrong.. as this is exactly the color that you deleted..\n\n. Not really... sorry :/\n. Are you using Less?! If so.. just add a new button by choosing the right color.. https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/blob/gh-pages/bootstrap-social.less#L95-L114\n. I want to split the core from the rest and then maybe start adding more buttons.. but at the moment I already have too many for the core functionality..\n. If you guys using Less or SASS then it's super easy to just change the color and add the icon that is not part of this library anyway.. and if you're not using Less or SASS.. then you should :)\n. I am sorry.. but I think it is very clear here: https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/blob/gh-pages/.editorconfig#7\n. Actually I'm not sure if I will add all these icons anyway.. as like I mentioned before there are already too many and it's super easy to add new ones if using Less/SASS :) But when folks are getting only the CSS is kind of annoying to get a massive file with 95% useless stuff..\nIf I'll break down the core icons and the rest then maybe.. \n. Yes no problem and I can see the need of adding new icons...\nBut looking forward.. why are you changing the CSS and adding new rules.. and all that stuff when this PR is for adding new icons..? if there is something that needs to be changed make a separate one..\n. 505 additions and 324 deletions\nFor 3 new icons is just doesn't make any sense :) sorry\n. That's all I have: https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/blob/gh-pages/bootstrap-social.scss\n. it should work if you are using bootstrap  and it's variables.. the whole idea is that it will match exactly the normal btn buttons\n. No Stylus support..\n. Hmmm... that's a tricky one.. cause in a way it belongs to category social :) you could get it and rename it.. but eventually if become popular it will be blocked again.. not much we can do I guess\n. @gameguy43 Thanks for the research, the follow up and the links.. Of course the icons are not part of this lib, but nevertheless I believe even if we're going to change the prefix they will do something else to block them, as they are blocking all the social stuff.. even when it's actually needed and not intended to spam or annoy people.. I'm not sure if there is any way to bring that subject to AdBlocker or something, as these buttons started and intended to be used as sign in buttons..\n. I think I'll just close this one.. not much we can do.. right?\n. But I have it like that.. no?\nhttps://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/blob/gh-pages/bootstrap-social.less#L22\n. Oh I see.. in the generated CSS the space is gone..\n. looks good.. thanks\n. The reason that I have google-plus is because it all started with the same exactly code as with Font Awesome.. But maybe you're right..\n. Fixed in https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/commit/b53226d35592aa0169575e9e1b5f5c549a1145f3\n. Are you sure it's from this library?!\n. is it?\n. yep #57 \n. :+1: \n. You can add any icon you want.. even if it's not from here: http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/ if you are using Less or SASS..\n. Can you create a PR for the composer.json?\n. sorry.. \n. No it's not maintained by me.. I didn't add it there.. is it possible to remove the version from the package.json so it will get the releases, as it's happening with bower.json\n. How do I get ownership?\n. I already send an email to the owner of it.. of course there are no bad feelings or anything :) I'm actually flattered with those things.. :dancer: \n. I'm the owner now https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap-social :+1: so the next question is how do I update it?\n. actually if you could submit a PR would be the best ATM :) Try to keep it as close to bower.json so it will be easier to maintain it later on..\n. \n. #28 \n. not sure how though :)\n. :) Any idea on how to update the readme?\n. I'll have to pass on this one.. as it requires more maintenance..\n. It's only IE 8.. http://caniuse.com/#feat=css3-colors :)\n. :+1: \n. I tried to have it fixed :) https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design/issues/151\n. Nice.. will merge it once I'm back :) :palm_tree:\n. According to the link you provided.. the color should be: #f4731c\nhttp://v.ok.ru/images/logo/download/ok_logo_sign_orange.svg\n. Can you squash the commits as well?\n. :+1: \n. Icons are not part of this repo.. I'm using the Font-Awesome as an example.. so whenever they will get an update: https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/7357\n. bong.. I will in the near future break up the source files to core and the rest and I will start adding more icons.. but in reality the only thing that you need to do in order to use it in your own project is to find the right color and then:\nless\n.btn-youtube       { .btn-social(#c0ffee); }\nor\nsass\n.btn-youtube        { @include btn-social(#c0ffee); }\n. thanks! could you do it for the https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css as well?\n. could be both I guess... :)\n. once it's closer to the RC1 :)\n. Maybe.. \ud83d\udc83      \n. Can't really do much about that.. If you can manage to add a normal button in a dropdown on Bootstrap.. then this one will be fixed as well :)\n. Yes.. didn't want to have directories because there is only one file per type... but maybe I'll split the files into more to have the basic ones in one and then then all.. so we can start adding as many new icons/colors as we want :) WDYT?\n(the version will change for sure)\n. https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social/commit/56dab131741b025891e4512e36c18b7e26bd1486\n. :dancer: \n. As the name suggests.. it's based on Bootstrap.. so it assumes that you including it when working with source: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v3.3.6/less/mixins/buttons.less#L6\n. np.. good luck.\n. are you still interested in this one?\n. It's not meant to be inside the dropdown menu and I don't think that I will support this out of the box..\n. this and many others.. I closed all of the requests.. as I will try to split up things or write detailed instructions on how to add more buttons in less or sass :) no need to grow the CSS size..\n. you have to compile it with something to generate the CSS.. but if you are thinking of updating the css for this project in order to include the SO.. then you don't have to waste your time.. \n. I don't get why people are getting mad.. don't waste your time to generate the CSS.. https://github.com/lipis/bootstrap-social#pull-requests\nPlus if you really wanted help.. it's the first time that you are referring to webpack and sass-loader.. there are hundreds of different ways of compiling stuff to CSS.. how are we supposed to know how to help?\n. I'm generating it using Less\n. In theory if you are loading the whole thing.. it should work.. here is an example of something similar in Less.. \n. StackOverflow  is one way to find out if you are already searched the whole internet :)\n. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask\n. :+1:\n. @janwillemvd done :)\n. So avoid using it :)\n. can you have a JSFiddle with your issue?\n. https://jsfiddle.net/qj8w4Lq4/4/ You have to remove the btn-block..\n. out of the scope.. sorry\n. and that's fine.. but this lib has nothing to do with icons..\n. If you feel like editing the files right away and issuing a PR would be awesome..\n. So I'm not sure... do you want it or not?\n. T\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0438 \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0448\u044c..\n. :D Will do later.. while I understand russian it's hard to type it for me :) I'll update it eventually..  and as for Yandex I want to refactor the whole thing to start adding all of the requested ones in a separate file.. one of these days... :)\n. #127 \n. \ud83c\udf7b \n. where should it point to then?\n. Soon I'll have to check what is going to happen with BS4 :)\n. Because the icon was too big.. But the actual icons are not part of this lib so feel free to use whatever you like :)\n. I'm back.. so this week I promise to follow up :) Don't be sorry.. this has to be fixed..\n. #127 They all look nice.. I didn't change much though :)\n. I think now I realised what happened.. :)\n\n. I'll just going to close this issue :D\n. we all been there.. don't worry about it :)\n. are  you including the Bootstrap source files?\n. well.. here is your answer :)\n. Yes.. if you are using SASS files to compile then you need to use Bootstrap source files.. and not the compiled ones as the $line-height-computed is coming from Bootstrap dependency..\n. I don't know if you noticed.. but the project is called bootstrap-social didn't that gave a couple of clues that it might require Bootstrap to work with?!\nAlso as everyone knows people that can't read or they assume things that shouldn't assume won't make it far in their life.. \n. Internet is a funny place..\n. > but requiring bootstrap is like opening an ice cream shop and only selling a horrible tasting vanilla with amazing sprinkles.\nSo do you think still that I insulted you..?!\nFlash news: I'm not requiring anything.. it's a free fucking world.. RTFM and take it from there..\n. there are better ways to address the issue without having the stupid/immature attitude like: \"As everyone knows, bootstrap is a no-no because of it's bad practice\" for something that has 100K followers, etc, etc.. so learn how the world works first and then start making these statements..\n. fixed. It looks like you are right :) Thanks man... css or maybe put it in files instead.. where we could include all the source files?. then let's just remove it completely.. :). jsut remove this line.. if you are still around :). Don't.. this lib is only the CSS.. it's up to you what you are going to use for icons... aliasies and the icons in general are not part of this repo.. you can add any icon you want for any button... too many packages :) #71 it requires maintenance.. . icons are not part of this repo... thanks!. it's been requested before... It's based on Bootstrap.. so you are just using Bootstrap's classes for sizes, btn-sm, btn-lg, etc... ",
