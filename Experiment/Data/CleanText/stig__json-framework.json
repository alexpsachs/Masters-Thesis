    "stig": "@samsoffes Patches (with tests) welcome... ;)\n. I've decided against this, at least for now. I will consider it again if I get a very good patch. (With tests.)\n. It is deliberate, because so many people tried to use the framework in their iPhone app. (Which obviously doesn't work.)\nThe \"source\" is literally that - classes for you to drop into your existing project, to make it as simple as possible to use. If you want to build the framework, just download it from github.\nI can see it being confusing though, and would like to hear suggestions for how to improve the situation.\n. I'm confused; I don't understand why dropping the JSON folder into your application doesn't work for you - it work for me, but only with the conditional you cite above in place...\n. I don't understand why you can't use  in your app. Your Classes folder surely is on your include path? It should just work, I thought.\nI'm assuming that you end up with Classes/JSON/JSON.h, and not Classes/JSON.h by the way.\n. Hmm... I think I see it now.\nDo you have any suggestions for how to make this work properly in all these cases?\n- on iPhone, copy sources\n- on iPhone, link to libjson.a\n- on Mac, copy sources\n- on Mac, link to JSON.framework\nI think the first three should be similar, but the last is not. Suggestions?\n. I don't think I'm missing the point. The lack of a JSON.framework or .xcodeproj in the DMG is deliberate. The DMG is meant to be the simplest possible way to get started using JSON in your application, be it for the iPhone or the Mac.\nRegardless of whether you're writing an iPhone or Mac application you should be able to just drag the \"JSON\" folder into your app compile, and go. This works just fine for me. That it doesn't work for you (and others) is a bug. Let that be clear.\nAdvanced users (like you and I) prefer to link to the framework rather than copying the sources. However, some people want debug information and others don't; I don't want to provide all permutations, so don't want to distribute binaries.\nFor the Mac it is relatively simple to just do external dependency on the project. You can do that with the unchanged source tree downloaded straight off github.  I agree that it's not as well advertised as the DMG, but if you visit the download page you'll find tar/zip files for both the master branch and tag v2.3 ready for download. \nHere are two example projects (as I'm sure you don't need, but can be useful to others reading this ticket):\n- http://github.com/stig/JsonSampleMac\n- http://github.com/stig/JsonSampleIPhone\n. I've just pushed a new branch, nodmg, where I try to address this problem. Can you please check it out and see if it fixes it?\nGet branch as .zip file\nWhat I've done is just use the simple #import \"...\" style by default, and transform that at build time into the proper framework/library style. I think this should cover all use cases.\n. I love it when bug fixes makes my code cleaner and easier to read. This seems reasonable. Wanna send me pull request that fixes this bug?\n. Closing as this is now a duplicate of issue 4, which has the pull request attached.\n. I've applied this patch as it doesn't break any tests and is cleaner than my existing code. (However I don't seem to be able to break the old code in the way you describe.)\n. Thanks. I still don't see that behaviour here, but I did apply your patch already as it cleaned up the code a bit.\n. I don't think this should be required. Please see the instructions here: http://github.com/stig/JsonSampleMac\nIf that does not work for you, please can you give a bit more details about how you include it in your app?\n. I recommend using the external dep like I show in the example I linked to above rather than linking to the built JSON.framework. Nevertheless, if that is what you want to do it works fine as it is. I can see no reason why it should be necessary to make the private headers public.\nSee this example: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6478115/JsonSampleMacFramework.zip\n. Great to hear it.\nAs an aside, the reason you're probably better off using the external linking (as mentioned here: http://github.com/stig/JsonSampleMac ) is that you then automatically get a debug when building your app in debug mode, and a release build when building your app in release mode. This means that when debugging you will be able to step through the JSON.framework code as well, while on a release build you don't get the overhead of the debug symbols.\n. -objectWithString: actually converts the NSString into a C-style utf8 byte array internally. Long term I was hoping to make the primary interface NSData based, and delegate to it from the NSString one. (The opposite of what you're doing here.)\n. I also don't want to rely on the data being UTF8. UTF16 & UTF32 should be possible to detect also (even though we might convert it to UTF8 until we can handle them natively).\n. There's a few screenshots that might provide more information on the google code issue tracker.\n. Ah, that is good news in a way. Remind me - does apple accept applications targeting 3.0 anymore? And if they do, are they likely to do so after 4.2 comes out in a couple of months? I don't feel like hacking around this of it's going away in a relatively short time. \n. Ok, then let\u2019s fix it. Having looked at the code again it shouldn't be too hard rewrite the code to avoid the problematic call. A couple of questions:\n- do you see this problem in the simulator too? \n- are you able to create some minimal app that displays the problem that I can download from somewhere, or are you able to be on hand to test in the nearby future?\n. Hi - can you try the code in this branch:\nhttp://github.com/stig/json-framework/tree/issue-7\n. Hmm. Can you try to replace that line with this (i.e. just replace the NSMutableString with NSString)?\n*o = [[[NSString alloc] initWithBytes:(char*)c length:len encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] autorelease];\n. Jasconius, have you managed to recreate this?\n. Sure, we\u2019ll leave it open for now. \n. Hi Jasconius, \nIt looks like other people are having issues with Instruments misreporting leaks:\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/json-framework/msg/c97a48a845807304?\nI'm going to close this issue. Feel free to re-open if you manage to isolate a leak. Thanks for keeping me on my toes!\nStig\n. I agree that this is confusing. That file is documenting installation from the DMG-based releases, which you can download from google code at the moment.\nI'm trying to move away from that and release directly from github. There's a branch (nodmg) already for that that has updated Installation.markdown file.\nHope this clarifies the issue.\n. This is currently a reality, at least on my machine. (Not through sheer luck, by the way; the new code backed by SBJsonStreamWriter class is nearly twice as fast as the old one in the benchmark.)\n. Really? What are you running on? My run is on a 2009-edition iMac... Are you running on a phone?\nDid you pull in my latest patch to your benchmarks for your test run?\n. My work here is done ;p\n. I want to improve the parser first. \n. Refactorings to the library made the code much cleaner but, alas, a bit slower.\n. We now beat YALJ for writing. \n. Hi Gilad,\nI can't see anything  wrong with the parsing of that input. It seems to round-trip correctly, as far as I can see. I've created a branch (issue-10) and added your input as a test case.\nHow did you determine an error? Could there be an encoding issue? (Is your terminal Latin-1 or something like that?)\n. http://github.com/stig/json-framework/commit/0faf5cc8d210cf1375cd49f9252b43eeedecdc1b\n. I see what the problem is. Your code is incorrect. You're missing the fact that \"results\" points to an array. But because you use the valueForKey: collection method rather than the objectForKey: dictionary method you get an array of all the values of the titleNoFormatting keys in the results array. And the NSLog() method screws up the formatting of the string. \nIf you substituting your last two lines for these you should get the result you want:\nNSString* title=[[[[data valueForKey:@\"responseData\"] valueForKey:@\"results\"] objectAtIndex:0] valueForKey:@\"titleNoFormatting\"];\nNSLog(@\"%@\",title);\n. Yes, it is correct. Your input is wrapped in [], which is JSON-speak for Array. JSON can have either Array or Object (Dictionary) as its outer-most object.\n. The stream-writer branch now passes all the tests. Hence, it should now be possible to open a remote socket and write JSON to it without having to write an intermediate string.\nPlease, test it out!\n. It is very slow. Performance patches welcome!\n. Ok, it's a bit faster now. However, certain parts of the -writeNumber: and -writeString: routines are dead slow. I took some shortcuts that need to be rectified; basically, we should not call the UTF8String method so often. It's really killing us.\n. As of now my stream-based writer is the 2nd fastest, after JSONKit. Caching string encodes turned out to be key.\n. I think this feature is ready now.\n. Can you clarify whether you are you talking about Xcode version numbers? This framework hasn't reached such high version numbers yet.\n. Weirdness. Can you try version 2.3.0 of the framework (download it from the github tag) and see it that has this problem too? I hacked the .xcodeproj file manually for the last release and while it works great for me I could have broken something\u2026\n. OK, should be fix in master now. Please re-open if not.\n. Thanks. Applied. \n. Not right now, methinks.\n. There's now a stream-parser branch where this work is taking place.\n. Apple improved their parser too much, and are making it public, in iOS 5: it's no longer feasible for a lone developer with limited time to compete on speed. \n. No, it does not mean that. But I am not delaying any releases until I beat those other frameworks on speed.\nStig\nSent from my iPhone\nOn 27 Sep 2011, at 14:36, Sam Soffesreply@reply.github.com wrote:\n\nDoes this mean you are discontinuing development on SBJSON?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/stig/json-framework/issues/17#issuecomment-2207735\n. Retroactively added to the issue tracker to more easily keep track of new features in the upcoming v2.4 changelog.\n. Was the error in the error object not clear enough? What does it say?\n\nAnyway, your input is illegal as JSON requires double-quotes, not single quotes. \n. From Json.org:\n\n. Using single quotes is perhaps a common enough mistake that we could mention it explicitly in the error message. \n. Hi Robsa,\nThat class was deprecated in v2.2 and removed in v2.3 - see the http://github.com/stig/json-framework/blob/master/Changes.markdown for details. \nUse the SBJsonParser or SBJsonWriter class instead. \n.  Try the current master. I think that is a better solution. \n. Hi Kosta,\nThis is very cool! I'm glad you appreciate my work too.\nI'm a little confused as to why you need to generate Objective-C code to create a structure. If you already have the JSON, can't you just load that from a file and parse it into the Objective-C structure? Is there a particular reason you can't \"externalise\" this?\nSomething like this, for example:\nNSString *json = [NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:path encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:nil];\nid = [json JSONValue];\nI'm not very well-versed in JavaScript, so I'm a bit concerned about not being able to maintain it. I was also wondering if it makes more sense in the gh-pages branch.\n. Maps are perfectly fine. I was more thinking about this kind of stuff:\nif (/^[\\],:{}\\s]*$/\n         .test(text.replace(/\\\\(?:[\"\\\\\\/bfnrt]|u[0-9a-fA-F]{4})/g, '@')\n         .replace(/\"[^\"\\\\\\n\\r]*\"|true|false|null|-?\\d+(?:\\.\\d*)?(?:[eE][+\\-]?\\d+)?/g, ']')\n         .replace(/(?:^|:|,)(?:\\s*\\[)+/g, ''))) {\n. Ah, I see. That makes it a bit different. :)\nCan you please put this in a Tools directory rather than straight in the root?\n. Yeah. I've not had time to have a proper look at it yet, I'm afraid, but rest assured I will. I'll most likely merge this.\n. Those are not JSON escape sequences. \nSee http://json.org/\n. This is present on master now.\n. This is available on the stream-parser branch.\n. And now in master.\n. Thanks!\nI just removed the asserts in the end. They were more useful during initial development.\n. This is expected behaviour, as \\p is not a valid escape sequence. If you want it reproduced that way it should be \\\\par rather than \\par. (Escape the \\.)\n. This shouldn't be a problem, as there is no conflict. Are you using some compiler settings that warn about this? \n. OK, fixed.\n. That sounds like a bug... Will fix it when I next get a chance to sit down with it.\n. Fixed.\n. Fixed in master.\n. Fixed. Keep the issues coming :)\n. I forgot to free the states array at some point. Is it fixed by this:\nhttps://github.com/stig/json-framework/commit/175445102bf37ef3687d73dfa1f30c1eb9109d40\n. Fixed in master now.\n. Hi Shairon,\nAs flattering as it is to get pull requests I'm going to pass on this I'm afraid. Feel free to maintain a \"friendly fork\" providing this functionality. Alternatively, maybe you could set up a separate project?\nStig\n. Hi Edwin,\nAs gratifying as it is to be sent patches I'm afraid I'm going to reject this. Although I'm sure it's handy when debugging Objective-C it doesn't appear to be related to parsing / writing of JSON. (Unless I'm missing something.)\nMaybe you can start a separate project for it? Otherwise, feel free to maintain a fork.\nStig\n. I agree that this is a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HACK. But I couldn't figure out another way that satisfied all these:\n- Don't force users to put -DSOMETHING in their CFLAGS\n- Works on iPhone / Mac, both when:\n  - copied into your app\n  - using the static lib / framework\n. I couldn't make it work... Care to make a patch? :)\n. There is a hack in -appendBytes: that appends a \\0 to make sure the hecodeHexQuad worsk. Let me stress again that it's a hack. One of these days I want to make the code completely length-based.\n. Thanks. Having looked into this the decoding of the code point seems to work, but my conversion from the code point to the string was not. I'll try to fix this.\n. I've re-opened the ticket. \n. I have actually fixed this issue. (The fix to issue 42 fixed it, though only the crash; it's still rejecting the utf8 as malformed.) But I'm not closing it yet because I haven't actually added a test that shows this yet.\n. Thanks for the patch, but \\x is non-standard and it's difficult enough to support all of JSON that I don't want to support non-standard things. Sorry!\n. I'm not against making these methods optional.  I'd be happy to see a patch for it, and if the patch is clean and it's not much of a speed hit I'll apply it.\n. Just a tip, performance can be tested using samsoffes/json-benchmarks project. \n. Did you get anywhere with the performance check?\n. Hey Luke, I'm afraid after much dithering I decided to revert this. I don't think all the if statements is the right approach.\n. Will check this, but doubt there is any problems. While the SDK downloads, can you show your code?\n. Works fine for me using iOS SDK 4.2. Are you using external linking, or copying the sources into your app?\n. I can't reproduce this.\n. Well, I've tried that and it works. I'm afraid I can't help you without seeing your code.\n. Thanks John. I'll see about this.\n. Fixed in master.\n. What flags are you building with? And which compiler?\n. Hm, yes. I see what you mean. Though, I didn't manage to get my compiler to actually warn for that. Weird. \nI'm suffering a bit with too many targets, at the moment. I need to see if I can get the xcconfig thing to work, so I can share config between the targets.\n. That doesn't look like an error I produce. Rather, it looks to me like like your server doesn't handle your input. \n. Ouch, that sounds like a bug. Thanks for reporting it.\n. Hi Bob!\nI'm not sure what you mean by a 'static framework for iOS'. Could you describe it a bit more? If you already have a patch, can you send me a pull request? Or point me to it, at least?\n. Hi Bob,\nThis sounds great. The extra hoops you have to jump through to use a static library rather than a framework has been irking me. On the face of it it sounds like something I'd want to merge. I won't have access to a development machine for a few weeks, however, so it won't happen immediately.\nStig\n. Hi Bob,\nI've had a look at this and a read-up of the implications and I think that I'm not going to merge this, I'm afraid. I'm sorry for letting you think so, but I thought static frameworks were now fully supported in Xcode4. As I understand it this is not the case, and we actually build a dynamic framework and replace the binary with a static lib. This is what I used to provide in the 2.2 series (or thereabouts) and it was a nightmare to maintain - 90% of my support requests (or something; the vast majority, certainly) was people having issues with it. This is partly why I no longer do binary releases.\nStig\n. This cache gave quite a bit of performance when parsing typical JSON where\nif you have a list of dictionaries, for example, you tend to get the same\nstrings (the dictionary keys) repeated again and again.\nThe idea behind making it static was that strings would stay cached even\nacross calls to the category methods, which instantiate a new parser for\neach call. However, I agree it may be a bit heavy-handed. I could be swayed\nto move it to the instance instead of being a static cache. Especially if it\ndoesn't affect performance much.

The 3.0-line of development already handles NSData.\n. I think this is a FAQ:\nThe new (3.0) linker apparently has a bug that causes -ObjC to not be processed correctly on device builds. If you have a category in a static library--and try to reference a method in that category--it will work on the simulator but crash on the device.\nThe solution is to include the linker flag -all_load in addition to -ObjC. If that is not an option, you could try to use the SBJsonParser or SBJsonWriter objects directly rather than the category methods.\n(Thanks to Greg Pasquariello)\n. Unicode escaping is handled automatically. I'm afraid your question is too vague. Please provide some more details.\n. That doesn't sound right. Can you please show your input, and a piece of code that shows this behaviour?\n. I can't reproduce this. Please put together some piece of code / input that demonstrates the problem.\n. I'm going to close this issue. I believe it must be related to the way you are parsing the JSON out of the web page.\n. SBJson does decode properly escaped strings. I wonder if your terminal doesn't display the unicode characters. Notice that the case has changed from \\u00c3 to \\U00c3?\n. Did try passing in valid JSON? If you consult http://json.org/ you will note that \\U3042 is not a valid JSON unicode escape sequence. As I told the previous poster, note the difference between \\uXXXX (which is valid) and \\UXXXX (which is not).\n. That should work. Decoding \\uXXXX unicode escapes is a core functionality that you don't have to turn on. \n\nCan you show the data? Perhaps a URL, so I can look at the real source?\n. I'm afraid that code will NEVER work with SBJson because it is not valid JSON unicode escape. (It might be a valid Objective-C unicode escape, but that only matters if it exists in strings in your code.) Please read my previous posts again: the case is important. So \\u3042 should work.\n. Mt test suite covers Unicode escapes.

Hi dagerydoo,\n\nYour patch sounds interesting, but it won't merge now against master, I'm afraid. Can you redo it, but without adding a new target? Just change the sbjson-ios target. I have no interest in ever supporting a binary release, but one that will work easily with workspaces would be very nice.\n. Can you show a bit more of your code? I have a feeling that you're not waiting until you've received the full JSON document before you try to parse, but instead parse the first response you get from the -connection:didReceiveData: method. Is that correct?\nIf that's the case your code is broken and there's two ways to fix it. Either do what this tutorial shows http://mobileorchard.com/tutorial-json-over-http-on-the-iphone/ and accumulate the  JSON before parsing, or use the streaming capabilities of the parser. (Might require a bit of re-engineering, but could end lowering latency.)\nExample of using streaming API is here: https://github.com/stig/json-framework-examples/tree/master/TweetStream\n. I think you are right. I have resisted a name change for too long. A 3.0 release might be the time to do it.\n. Fixed in master. Github rename might come later...\n. The comment is wrong. I renamed the framework and header to avoid clashing with apple\u2019s private framework of the same name\u2014but I may rename it again before a 3.0 release, if I can find a better name. \nStig\nSent from my iPhone\nOn 1 Jun 2011, at 08:13, dagerydooreply@reply.github.com wrote:\n\nThere is a comment in SBJson.h that mentions including JSON.h instead of SBJson.h, but there is no JSON.h in the repository.

I don't know of a fix for this. But a (hopefully acceptable) work around would be for you to create a local fork just commit the necessary changes into it.

If you look at the master branch, you'll see that my change to remove use of retain/release/autorelease went in before you opened the ticket.\n. I had to roll this back, as it means you can't use it on 4.3. I thought ARC was a compile-time only thing, but it appears it requires run-time support only present in iOS 5+. As a work-around you can link to the library or do the conversion in your own project.\n. I don't see this. It's a singleton - there shouldn't be any leaks there.\n.

Essentially, it has to parse a set of data like thus:\n[{\"WORD_TYPE\":\"noun\"}, {\"WORD_TYPE\":\"verb\"}]\nThis is simplified (eventually there will be multiple words with types as well as definitions.) With the expanded dataset as well as this one, it parses properly by splitting each word and its related keys into an array entry. For example, I have this parsed into an array and it returns two entries: one containing {\n   \"WORD_TYPE\" = noun;\n}\nand one containing {\n   \"WORD_TYPE\" = verb;\n}\nwhich is perfect. For the second part, however, I want each of these entries stored into their own NSDictionary, with the key of \"WORD_TYPE\" and the value of \"verb\". This is the part where the parser fails, giving me 2011-07-11 03:51:30.493 shmoop[2190:207] -[__NSCFDictionary dataUsingEncoding:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x4c35cd0\n2011-07-11 03:51:30.494 shmoop[2190:207] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[__NSCFDictionary dataUsingEncoding:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x4c35cd0'.\nCould you give me some insight Stig?

This looks good. However, can I bother you to do a rebase against my master branch?\n. You'd normally do something like:\n\ngit remote add stig <full repo path>\ngit fetch\ngit rebase stig/master\nbut don't sweat it, I've merged this now.\n. I think you've misread RFC 4627:\n```\n2.5.  Strings\nThe representation of strings is similar to conventions used in the C\n   family of programming languages.  A string begins and ends with\n   quotation marks.  All Unicode characters may be placed within the\n   quotation marks except for the characters that must be escaped:\n   quotation mark, reverse solidus, and the control characters (U+0000\n   through U+001F).\n...\n```\nThey go on to show a list of ALLOWED escape sequences. You seem to have confused them with REQUIRED ones.\n. :)\n. There doesn't appear to be anything wrong with the JSON on any of those URLs. I plugged them both into my DisplayPretty example (shipped in the distribution) and they both parse just fine.\nDid you use NSURLConnection to get the page content? Did you pass partial content to SBJsonParser? If you want to incrementally parse a document downloaded by NSURLConnection you need to use SBJsonStreamParser. Otherwise, you'll need to aggregate the results in an NSMutableData instance and parse that once you get the parse finished message from NSURLConnection.\nStig\nOn 25 Sep 2011, at 17:48, andi1984 wrote:\n\nIf I'm using http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=test&result_type=recent&count=5 as a json-source, I get the error message \"-JSONValue failed.

Hi ersinacar,\n\nSBJson should translate any string input to UTF8 when it's encoding. But, SBJson doesn't deal with connections, nor does it have a search box, so I'm afraid I don't understand what your problem is. You need to provide a bit more information about what you are trying to do. \nStig\n. Which version of SBJson? Which version of Xcode? What is the error from clang? \n. For the version number you won't go far wrong by checking the Changes file. (It's also present in the SBJson-Info.plist file.)\nYou're saying Xcode4.2 now, while the subject says Xcode4. I'm assuming you used a version of SBJson lower than 3.1alpha3 then, and that you used ARC.\nI recently added support for ARC to the master branch. I suspect that's the reason.\n. 3.1alpha3 version works, right?\nI suspect that the version that didn't work was 3.1alpha2, or previous.\n. If you're using Xcode4 you'll need to download SBJson 3.0.4. Or, if you want to use the latest release you'll have to upgrade to Xcode4.2 and use ARC.\n. No, that's not a JSON encoding. It looks like HTML, or XML entity encoding. \nStig\nOn 31 Oct 2011, at 08:18, markb63 wrote:\n\nWhen I run the parser on a string that has an encoded apostrophe it remains \u2019  Should the parser handle this?\nThanks.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/stig/json-framework/issues/107\n.

Let me check it a bit more. \n\nStig\n\nSent from my iPhone\nOn 16 Mar 2012, at 05:51, Edenreply@reply.github.com wrote:\n\n3.1a3's DisplayPretty:\nin: [5.0e-200]\nout: [500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000]\nin: [5.0e-300]\nout: [0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000005]\nin: [5.0e200]\nout: [0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005]\nin: [5.0e300]\nout: [500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000]\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/stig/json-framework/issues/127\n. https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSDecimalNumber_Class/Reference/Reference.html says that exponent has to be a signed 8-bit integer, so range from -128 to 127.\n. Um, I don't remember. (I thought I was using NSDecimalNumber because it had higher precision than double.) In other words, more research needed\u2026 :-(\n\n\nSent from my iPhone\nOn 16 Mar 2012, at 18:29, Edenreply@reply.github.com wrote:\n\nOops, base 2 exponent from -1022 to 1023, so:\n4.9406564584124654e\u2212324 (Min subnormal positive double)\n1.7976931348623157e308 (Max Double)\nWhich is actually how I ended up here in the first place, I was parsing 5e-324, JavaScript's MIN_VALUE.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/stig/json-framework/issues/127#issuecomment-4545473\n. Yep, that is a bug. I've been treating NSDecimalNumber as a BigNum, which is not the case.\n. This is a bit of a wasp's nest. As you say an NSNumber representing a double supports base 10 exponents up to 308, with just under 17 decimal digits of precision. NSDecimalNumber doesn't support as high maximum values (base 10 exponent only up to 127) but in exchange supports much higher precision (38 digits).\n\nThere are several options:\n1. Always use NSNumber (i.e. a double) for floating point numbers. This would support larger/smaller values than now, at the cost of lower precision.\n2. Continue to use NSDecimalNumber, meaning we support high precision but not so large/small numbers.\n3. Try to do intelligently pick the best choice of the above based on the length of the mantissa and/or exponent.\nRegardless of the method we choose, we should return an error unless we can faithfully represent the number that we parsed. (I.e. if there would be a rounding error.)\n. First (and ugly) cut at 2 + error on overflow above: https://github.com/stig/json-framework/compare/master...issue-127 \n. Yeah, 2 is a bit of a cop-out. I agree that 1 or 3 would be better solutions, but I would think that initially reporting an error rather than silently truncating the number is a good first step while I think about how to implement the improvement. The number parsing is getting rather hairy and I'd like to take this opportunity to clean it up a bit.\n. Because the current implementation uses nsdecimalnumber and its implementation sacrificed range of max/min values for greatly increased precision. I'm currently leaning towards just using double, but I haven't had a chance to make the change yet. \nThis fix warrants a 3.2 release (or even 4.0) due to the precision changes it might cause. \nStig\n\nSent from my iPhone\nOn 14 Oct 2012, at 02:29, Thanapon Noraset notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nwhy are DECIMAL_EXPONENT_MIN and DECIMAL_EXPONENT_MAX set to very low absolute value?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. You could always patch SBJson locally to do that. If you know you don't need support for a range outside of what NSDecimalNumber supports it's a simple case of using it instead of the creating a double. \n\nAnother option may be to send the number as integer nominator/denominator parts of a fraction? As long as each integer is less than 21 digits SBJson will never round anything. You can then create a NSDecimalNumber yourself from those. That doesn't require any patching of SBJson.\n. I looked for a BigNum library for SBJson--and indeed I thought NSDecimalNumber was it for a while, until I realised how it actually worked!\n. If you want to provide a patch that can toggle between NSDecimalNumber and NSNumber (double) then I'm happy to review that -- and happy to work with you to get a PR tested. Open a new issue, perhaps?\n. I don\u2019t think it was too hasty. The old implementation had very real problems \u2014 did you see https://github.com/stig/json-framework/pull/171 https://github.com/stig/json-framework/pull/171 ?\nI would be open to add a constructor/initialiser with an option bit mask if that makes it easier. I did think about doing that, but didn\u2019t bother since I only had two cases to support. They are both just wrappers around the designated initialiser though, so it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to add. (Create new designated initialiser, delegate the current one to the new one with appropriate defaults: done.)\nStig\n\nOn 10 Aug 2015, at 20:22, juhovh notifications@github.com wrote:\nI can open a new issue for a proper patch if I get to it, actually I have a bit too much on my list right now and mainly wondered was it removed for good or is there some way to get the old behaviour.

I do not intentionally break backwards compatibility in minor version releases! :-)\nTBH, iOS 5 was released 15 months ago. I wouldn't expect anyone to use SBJson for new apps now if NSJSONSerialisation covers their need. If you go to the bother of installing a third-party JSON library for the benefit of calling a convenient category method I'd say you were crazy. And streaming support can't / won't be done via category methods.\nIf you're adding JSON support to an iOS 4 app at this point, I'd say you have bigger problems than having to call [[SBJsonParser new] objectWithString:foo] which is all the category methods really gave you.\n. Glad to help!\n. Hi Joshua,\nThis change is to allow me to focus on what makes this library stand out, which now really is streaming support. It is important to note that the coding master, which you've just pulled, is what will become 4.0. I do not change backward compatibility in minor releases. (Intentionally.) \nIt is difficult to say how many use that second argument, of course, since I don't instrument the library in any way. But I can say with certainty that nobody who have had a problem and posted on stack overflow showed that they used it in any meaningful way. I think people simply don't understand how to use these error pointers. \nAnd, by the way, now that Objective-C has blocks I think it would be much nicer to provide a block based interface. This also ties in with the idea of an event-based/streaming interface.\nStig \nSent from my iPhone\nOn 27 Feb 2013, at 13:32, Joshua Moody notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nhey stig,\ni just pull the latest json-framework into my project and was surprised to see these methods removed. i am not arguing for or against, but i am curious to know why you decided to remove them from the API?\nthanks for the framework - i use it extensively.\njjm\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

I want to discourage people from doing so because they don't know of Apple\u2019s offering. \nStig\n. Hi Andrew,\nI'm a little confused about your statements above. Here's Apple's description of NSDecimalNumber:\n\nNSDecimalNumber, an immutable subclass of NSNumber, provides an object-oriented wrapper for doing base-10 arithmetic. An instance can represent any number that can be expressed as mantissa x 10^exponent where mantissa is a decimal integer up to 38 digits long, and exponent is an integer from \u2013128 through 127.\n\nAFAIK you cannot rely on long long to be more than 64 bits, which means ~20 integer digits. And indeed, your patch breaks three tests that tests the limits of integer lengths, including the test for Snowflake (Twitter's ID scheme) compatibility:\n- https://github.com/adonoho/json-framework/blob/DDG-SBJson/src/test/resources/main/number_int05.in\n- https://github.com/adonoho/json-framework/blob/DDG-SBJson/src/test/resources/main/number_int06.in\n- https://github.com/adonoho/json-framework/blob/DDG-SBJson/src/test/resources/main/number_snowflake.readme\nCould it be that the way you are reading from the NSDecimalNumbers is causing the rounding you're seeing?\n. You're right. \nThere is definitively something fishy going on here. It's weird; it almost looks like a bug in NSDecimalNumber itself because it stringifies correctly:\n(lldb) po dict[@\"id\"]\n348188955398766593\nbut we get an off-by-one for longLong (and unsignedLongLong) values:\n```\n(lldb) p (long long)[dict[@\"id\"] longLongValue]\n(long long) $9 = 348188955398766592\n(lldb) p (unsigned long long)[dict[@\"id\"] unsignedLongLongValue]\n(unsigned long long) $11 = 348188955398766592\n```\nIn contrast, for the id_str, we get:\n```\n(lldb) p (long long) [dict[@\"id_str\"] longLongValue]\n(long long) $18 = 348188955398766593\n(lldb) p (long double)[dict[@\"id_str\"] doubleValue]\n(long double) $20 = 348188955398766592\n```\nWhat. Is. Going. On?\nDouble-precision IEEE floating point, is what. It looks like NSDecimalNumber's conversion to long long goes via double, which has only 17 decimal digits of precision. 348188955398766593 is 18 digits long, and so we get this rounding error.\nSo yes; you were right. My tests were inadequate. NSDecimalNumber has been a sticking point for a while (see issue #128). This might provide motivation to finally remove it. \nLet me mull this over over the weekend.\n. Manually merged.\n. I already did earlier today. Thanks!\nStig\nSent from my iPhone\nOn 22 Jun 2013, at 17:03, \"Andrew W.

In e.g. Mantle we have e.g. MantleTests/MTLArrayManipulationSpec.m be part of both the Mantle-MacTests and Mantle-iOSTests targets and it works well.\n\nIt's not a big deal, tbh.

Hi @robb,\n\n\nI've attempted to review this but there's just too many things going on here for me to pull it. Let me restate that I am happy to support Carthage, but I have some issues with this implementation. Specifically:\n- I would prefer the header file to not be renamed, and stay named SBJson4.h.\n- I would rather the source & test files were not. (If Carthage support cannot be achieved without it I will reconsider, but please do the rename as a separate pull request.)\n- I don't want to go the route of an explicit module map; as mentioned above I'd rather see the framework renamed to contain the major version in the name (c.f. libc6, limxml2, etc).\n- I am very happy for prefix headers to be removed, but please submit a separate pull request for this.\n- I am OK to update deployment targets etc.\n- If we can manage to update the CI target to run tests for carthage too, that would be ideal. (That being the whole point of the pull to start with.)\nI'm sorry I've taken so long to get back to. Hope the above is clear. \n. > I would prefer the header file to not be renamed, and stay named SBJson4.h.\n\nI don't want to go the route of an explicit module map; as mentioned above I'd rather see the framework renamed to contain the major version in the name (c.f. libc6, limxml2, etc).\nSo we're looking at two frameworks named SBJson4.framework (with different target names) as well as a single libSBJson.a for iOS 7 and lower. Right?\nWith iOS9 already in beta I don\u2019t really see a point of supporting iOS7 and lower. There\u2019s no change in actual code, so they can stick with the previous version.\nI would rather the source & test files were not.\nI assume you meant \"moved around\"? It's not necessary at all\n\nYes, that\u2019s what I meant. Sorry for the ambiguity, it was late at night :-)\nStig\n. @hotbott not in its current state, sorry. I'm keeping this open in case someone is willing to address the comments I made here.\n. For information for anyone interested in working on this, and if it was not clear already, any resulting framework should be named SBJson4, i.e. have the 4 as part of the name / classes / headers. This is so that it can be used in the same project as SBJson3 -- since version 4 breaks backwards compatibility.\n. A Carthage framework was added in #216\n. I've restarted, but it's not finished yet:\nhttps://travis-ci.org/stig/json-framework/builds/71935020\n. Bah, not needed.\n. Merged manually.\n. > On 1 Sep 2015, at 14:13, Andrey Slyusar notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nSBJson and SBJson4 have 4.0.2 version in cocoapods repo. Why 3.2 compatibility was dropped?\nVersion 4 and above has an incompatible interface with version <4. However, version 3.x and version 4.x are compatible in that both can be installed in the same applications. (I renamed all the classes to include the digit \u201c4\u201d for this purpose.) Further, you can install both from cocoa pods. See the spec directory here: https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/tree/master/Specs/SBJson https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/tree/master/Specs/SBJson\n\nDoes this answer your question?\nStig\n. It's in the change log for version 4.0.0a3, but perhaps not as prominent as it should be :-)\n. I'm not really doing work on SBJson at this time.\n. I'm going to leave this open, on the grounds that I may want to add this one day, but right now I don't think it's right for this library. Buck is (still) faster moving than Xcode, so it would be more maintenance keeping up with its changes. Also, my main interest in using Buck was to avoid the Xcode project altogether, and just generate an Xcode file, but it doesn't support Mac (only iOS) as far as I can see so this is not practical at the moment.\n. Thanks for the bug report! I am afraid I haven't had a chance to look at\nthis yet. It would be a lot easier for me to look into if you managed to\nadd a failing test case to the existing test framework!\n. Hi @AFSlayer,\nSorry about the time to get back to you. I cannot reproduce the issue, I'm afraid. I added your broken JSON to my test suite in https://github.com/stig/json-framework/pull/221 and it is correctly reported as an error for me. Can you please share more details about how this occurs for you?\nStig\n. I believe this is probably due to broken UTF8. There was a complete overhaul of the UTF8 validation in v4.0.4, so as I cannot reproduce this I'm going to assume it was fixed there. If you can reproduce this crash with the latest v4 release (v4.0.5 at the time of writing) then please re-open this issue or create a new one!. Thank you for the updated bug report. I'll re-open the ticket and try to schedule some time to look into it. . I believe (but can't confirm at the moment) that the test failures are due to your removal of XCTest dependencies?\n. I am afraid I have no idea. Do you have any information about what data it was attempting to write when this crash occurred?\n. I'm not sure there's much I can do here. Seems like you may want to raise a bug against NSString instead? It crashes on this line:\nobjc\nconst char *utf8 = [string UTF8String];\nSo, as far as I can see an instance of NSString is causing a crash when the -UTF8String method is called on it. \n. I am going to close this. I believe it to have been fixed in a fairly major round of bug fixes in v4.0.4.. Patch including failing test case (with or without fix!) very welcome! :-)\nIt's been years since I did any Objective-C in anger now, so I'm a bit rusty.\nNicolas Seriot notifications@github.com writes:\n\nSBJson4Parser will crash when parsing invalid UTF-8 strings such as [\"\\xFF\"].\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. Hi @nst, thanks for the report. How did you get this crash? Adding your example to my test suite detects the broken JSON and reports the byte index in the input where it fails, c.f. https://github.com/stig/json-framework/pull/220\n. BTW, I admit I was prompted into looking into this more closely by your Parsing JSON is a Minefield post. Thanks for the motivation :-)\n. \"Maintaining\". Heh. I've done little more than merging legit-seeming PRs in the last few years. Last time I opened Xcode was probably Xcode 5 or 6... I'll let you in on a secret: I've never even used this library myself, outside its tests. (Although I worked at a company where they used it. I wrote Scala there.) I wish people just used NSJSONSerialisation tbh. Although as you have pointed out, that has issues too. \n. Alright, that looks like a bug then. Thanks for the clarification! I did indeed misunderstand your initial report.\n. Just a quick note that I've found the reason for this crash, and am planning to fix it.\n. PR to address this bug is here: https://github.com/stig/json-framework/pull/220\n\nI think I may have just slain this beast of a bug!\n. I decided to track this as part of #219 \n. I decided to track this as part of #219 \n. I decided to track this as part of #219 \n. I decided to track this as part of #219 \n. I'm handling this as part of another change...\n. This is a backwards incompatible change, so I am contemplating making it an option, or just sucking it up and calling it SBJson 5.\n. I see no reason why it shouldn't be; tvOS just didn't exist when the podspec was created! Can you try making your own local podspec and see, and if you're successful report back with details so I can add it to the main podspec?. Hi Andrew,\nThanks for the contribution! How are you seeing these warnings you're addressing? I don't see them anywhere with the latest Xcode. Are you overriding any build settings to get these?\nI don't like the idea of adding pragmas to hide errors / warnings. As you say, that's not really the right fix. I am open for an actual fix, though I'd like to be able to reproduce the warning / error you're seeing too.\nThe second change seems to not go quite far enough; I think it should probably change the call sites to use unsigned long too. Although, I wonder if NSUInteger would suffice.. Thank you for the explanation! Having reviewed the 'repeated use of weak' situation, I believe you're right in your assessment that it's probably low risk. The _state variable holds a weak reference to singleton objects, so they should not simply disappear. However, because they are singleton objects it's probably also OK to make this a strong variable. If you don't mind, I would be interested in what you think a proper fix would look like. (I've not been doing much Objective-C / Mac / iOS programming for a few years, other than fixes to this library, so I'm not really up with best practices. The last few releases have mainly been due to contributions from the public. Thank you for being one of the contributors!)\nPS: I rolled your sign-comparison change into https://github.com/stig/json-framework/pull/251 . > On an unrelated issue, I am confused as to why you use a singleton's shared instance instead of a per stream parent instance? While switching to a parent instance won't solve the weak/strong problem, it would remove doubts about thread safety due to inadvertent state sharing.\nThese singletons have no state, just behaviour. I cannot remember why I chose that particular design, but if I had to guess it was probably an occurence of premature optimisation :P \nMore seriously, and if I understand you correctly, I suspect that the most common use case is to create a short-lived parser/writer when necessary, so singletons should require a little less resources. And there's only one copy necessary even for multiple parsers. \nNevertheless using per-stream parent instance for the state objects sounds like it could have been a good idea, and if I were to do it again I might have chosen that. I doubt I'll implement it myself, but if you feel strongly about it feel free to shoot me a PR and I'll evaluate it!. I'll merge this as soon as Travis confirms it's good.. Hi @zac24,\nI see you're using SBJson v4, which is good, but are you able to let me know which minor/patch version as well? There were some fairly major fixes in version 4.0.4 (and to a lesser degree in 4.0.5) that could have caused this. If you're not already on 4.0.5 I would be very grateful if you could try to upgrade and see if that helps. If you are already on 4.0.5 I would be even more grateful if you manage to come up with a test case that demonstrate the crash!\nSince 4.0.4 I've been running American Fuzzy Lop to test for crashes in SBJson on release candidates, and despite running it for 24 hours I've not found any errors. So I'm afraid I cannot reproduce the behaviour you're seeing.\nI've also looked at the code and I can't quite make sense of the error. It seems to say that obj is nil (and that key is \"note\") but the first line of the method has an assert to check if obj is nil.... are you by any chance compiling SBJson from source, with asserts turned off...? There's nothing wrong with that, per se; but I would have to re-evaluate my expectations about asserts being raised.. Thank you! Looking forward to hearing from you again on this matter :-). Thank you for reporting back with the good news! I will close this issue then.. @samsoffes Patches (with tests) welcome... ;)\n. I've decided against this, at least for now. I will consider it again if I get a very good patch. (With tests.)\n. It is deliberate, because so many people tried to use the framework in their iPhone app. (Which obviously doesn't work.)\nThe \"source\" is literally that - classes for you to drop into your existing project, to make it as simple as possible to use. If you want to build the framework, just download it from github.\nI can see it being confusing though, and would like to hear suggestions for how to improve the situation.\n. I'm confused; I don't understand why dropping the JSON folder into your application doesn't work for you - it work for me, but only with the conditional you cite above in place...\n. I don't understand why you can't use  in your app. Your Classes folder surely is on your include path? It should just work, I thought.\nI'm assuming that you end up with Classes/JSON/JSON.h, and not Classes/JSON.h by the way.\n. Hmm... I think I see it now.\nDo you have any suggestions for how to make this work properly in all these cases?\n- on iPhone, copy sources\n- on iPhone, link to libjson.a\n- on Mac, copy sources\n- on Mac, link to JSON.framework\nI think the first three should be similar, but the last is not. Suggestions?\n. I don't think I'm missing the point. The lack of a JSON.framework or .xcodeproj in the DMG is deliberate. The DMG is meant to be the simplest possible way to get started using JSON in your application, be it for the iPhone or the Mac.\nRegardless of whether you're writing an iPhone or Mac application you should be able to just drag the \"JSON\" folder into your app compile, and go. This works just fine for me. That it doesn't work for you (and others) is a bug. Let that be clear.\nAdvanced users (like you and I) prefer to link to the framework rather than copying the sources. However, some people want debug information and others don't; I don't want to provide all permutations, so don't want to distribute binaries.\nFor the Mac it is relatively simple to just do external dependency on the project. You can do that with the unchanged source tree downloaded straight off github.  I agree that it's not as well advertised as the DMG, but if you visit the download page you'll find tar/zip files for both the master branch and tag v2.3 ready for download. \nHere are two example projects (as I'm sure you don't need, but can be useful to others reading this ticket):\n- http://github.com/stig/JsonSampleMac\n- http://github.com/stig/JsonSampleIPhone\n. I've just pushed a new branch, nodmg, where I try to address this problem. Can you please check it out and see if it fixes it?\nGet branch as .zip file\nWhat I've done is just use the simple #import \"...\" style by default, and transform that at build time into the proper framework/library style. I think this should cover all use cases.\n. I love it when bug fixes makes my code cleaner and easier to read. This seems reasonable. Wanna send me pull request that fixes this bug?\n. Closing as this is now a duplicate of issue 4, which has the pull request attached.\n. I've applied this patch as it doesn't break any tests and is cleaner than my existing code. (However I don't seem to be able to break the old code in the way you describe.)\n. Thanks. I still don't see that behaviour here, but I did apply your patch already as it cleaned up the code a bit.\n. I don't think this should be required. Please see the instructions here: http://github.com/stig/JsonSampleMac\nIf that does not work for you, please can you give a bit more details about how you include it in your app?\n. I recommend using the external dep like I show in the example I linked to above rather than linking to the built JSON.framework. Nevertheless, if that is what you want to do it works fine as it is. I can see no reason why it should be necessary to make the private headers public.\nSee this example: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6478115/JsonSampleMacFramework.zip\n. Great to hear it.\nAs an aside, the reason you're probably better off using the external linking (as mentioned here: http://github.com/stig/JsonSampleMac ) is that you then automatically get a debug when building your app in debug mode, and a release build when building your app in release mode. This means that when debugging you will be able to step through the JSON.framework code as well, while on a release build you don't get the overhead of the debug symbols.\n. -objectWithString: actually converts the NSString into a C-style utf8 byte array internally. Long term I was hoping to make the primary interface NSData based, and delegate to it from the NSString one. (The opposite of what you're doing here.)\n. I also don't want to rely on the data being UTF8. UTF16 & UTF32 should be possible to detect also (even though we might convert it to UTF8 until we can handle them natively).\n. There's a few screenshots that might provide more information on the google code issue tracker.\n. Ah, that is good news in a way. Remind me - does apple accept applications targeting 3.0 anymore? And if they do, are they likely to do so after 4.2 comes out in a couple of months? I don't feel like hacking around this of it's going away in a relatively short time. \n. Ok, then let\u2019s fix it. Having looked at the code again it shouldn't be too hard rewrite the code to avoid the problematic call. A couple of questions:\n- do you see this problem in the simulator too? \n- are you able to create some minimal app that displays the problem that I can download from somewhere, or are you able to be on hand to test in the nearby future?\n. Hi - can you try the code in this branch:\nhttp://github.com/stig/json-framework/tree/issue-7\n. Hmm. Can you try to replace that line with this (i.e. just replace the NSMutableString with NSString)?\n*o = [[[NSString alloc] initWithBytes:(char*)c length:len encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] autorelease];\n. Jasconius, have you managed to recreate this?\n. Sure, we\u2019ll leave it open for now. \n. Hi Jasconius, \nIt looks like other people are having issues with Instruments misreporting leaks:\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/json-framework/msg/c97a48a845807304?\nI'm going to close this issue. Feel free to re-open if you manage to isolate a leak. Thanks for keeping me on my toes!\nStig\n. I agree that this is confusing. That file is documenting installation from the DMG-based releases, which you can download from google code at the moment.\nI'm trying to move away from that and release directly from github. There's a branch (nodmg) already for that that has updated Installation.markdown file.\nHope this clarifies the issue.\n. This is currently a reality, at least on my machine. (Not through sheer luck, by the way; the new code backed by SBJsonStreamWriter class is nearly twice as fast as the old one in the benchmark.)\n. Really? What are you running on? My run is on a 2009-edition iMac... Are you running on a phone?\nDid you pull in my latest patch to your benchmarks for your test run?\n. My work here is done ;p\n. I want to improve the parser first. \n. Refactorings to the library made the code much cleaner but, alas, a bit slower.\n. We now beat YALJ for writing. \n. Hi Gilad,\nI can't see anything  wrong with the parsing of that input. It seems to round-trip correctly, as far as I can see. I've created a branch (issue-10) and added your input as a test case.\nHow did you determine an error? Could there be an encoding issue? (Is your terminal Latin-1 or something like that?)\n. http://github.com/stig/json-framework/commit/0faf5cc8d210cf1375cd49f9252b43eeedecdc1b\n. I see what the problem is. Your code is incorrect. You're missing the fact that \"results\" points to an array. But because you use the valueForKey: collection method rather than the objectForKey: dictionary method you get an array of all the values of the titleNoFormatting keys in the results array. And the NSLog() method screws up the formatting of the string. \nIf you substituting your last two lines for these you should get the result you want:\nNSString* title=[[[[data valueForKey:@\"responseData\"] valueForKey:@\"results\"] objectAtIndex:0] valueForKey:@\"titleNoFormatting\"];\nNSLog(@\"%@\",title);\n. Yes, it is correct. Your input is wrapped in [], which is JSON-speak for Array. JSON can have either Array or Object (Dictionary) as its outer-most object.\n. The stream-writer branch now passes all the tests. Hence, it should now be possible to open a remote socket and write JSON to it without having to write an intermediate string.\nPlease, test it out!\n. It is very slow. Performance patches welcome!\n. Ok, it's a bit faster now. However, certain parts of the -writeNumber: and -writeString: routines are dead slow. I took some shortcuts that need to be rectified; basically, we should not call the UTF8String method so often. It's really killing us.\n. As of now my stream-based writer is the 2nd fastest, after JSONKit. Caching string encodes turned out to be key.\n. I think this feature is ready now.\n. Can you clarify whether you are you talking about Xcode version numbers? This framework hasn't reached such high version numbers yet.\n. Weirdness. Can you try version 2.3.0 of the framework (download it from the github tag) and see it that has this problem too? I hacked the .xcodeproj file manually for the last release and while it works great for me I could have broken something\u2026\n. OK, should be fix in master now. Please re-open if not.\n. Thanks. Applied. \n. Not right now, methinks.\n. There's now a stream-parser branch where this work is taking place.\n. Apple improved their parser too much, and are making it public, in iOS 5: it's no longer feasible for a lone developer with limited time to compete on speed. \n. No, it does not mean that. But I am not delaying any releases until I beat those other frameworks on speed.\nStig\nSent from my iPhone\nOn 27 Sep 2011, at 14:36, Sam Soffesreply@reply.github.com wrote:\n\nDoes this mean you are discontinuing development on SBJSON?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/stig/json-framework/issues/17#issuecomment-2207735\n.

Try the current master. I think that is a better solution. \n. Hi Kosta,\nThis is very cool! I'm glad you appreciate my work too.\nI'm a little confused as to why you need to generate Objective-C code to create a structure. If you already have the JSON, can't you just load that from a file and parse it into the Objective-C structure? Is there a particular reason you can't \"externalise\" this?\nSomething like this, for example:\nNSString *json = [NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:path encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:nil];\nid = [json JSONValue];\nI'm not very well-versed in JavaScript, so I'm a bit concerned about not being able to maintain it.

I've not had time to have a proper look at it yet, I'm afraid, but rest assured I will. I'll most likely merge this.\n. Those are not JSON escape sequences. \nSee http://json.org/\n. This is present on master now.\n. This is available on the stream-parser branch.\n. And now in master.\n. Thanks!\nI just removed the asserts in the end. They were more useful during initial development.\n. This is expected behaviour, as \\p is not a valid escape sequence. If you want it reproduced that way it should be \\\\par rather than \\par.

Alternatively, maybe you could set up a separate project?\nStig\n. Hi Edwin,\nAs gratifying as it is to be sent patches I'm afraid I'm going to reject this. Although I'm sure it's handy when debugging Objective-C it doesn't appear to be related to parsing / writing of JSON. (Unless I'm missing something.)\nMaybe you can start a separate project for it?

But I'm not closing it yet because I haven't actually added a test that shows this yet.\n. Thanks for the patch, but \\x is non-standard and it's difficult enough to support all of JSON that I don't want to support non-standard things. Sorry!\n. I'm not against making these methods optional.  I'd be happy to see a patch for it, and if the patch is clean and it's not much of a speed hit I'll apply it.\n. Just a tip, performance can be tested using samsoffes/json-benchmarks project. \n. Did you get anywhere with the performance check?\n. Hey Luke, I'm afraid after much dithering I decided to revert this. I don't think all the if statements is the right approach.\n. Will check this, but doubt there is any problems. While the SDK downloads, can you show your code?\n. Works fine for me using iOS SDK 4.2. Are you using external linking, or copying the sources into your app?\n. I can't reproduce this.\n. Well, I've tried that and it works. I'm afraid I can't help you without seeing your code.\n. Thanks John. I'll see about this.\n. Fixed in master.\n. What flags are you building with?

Hi Bob!\nI'm not sure what you mean by a 'static framework for iOS'. Could you describe it a bit more? If you already have a patch, can you send me a pull request? Or point me to it, at least?\n. Hi Bob,\nThis sounds great. The extra hoops you have to jump through to use a static library rather than a framework has been irking me. On the face of it it sounds like something I'd want to merge. I won't have access to a development machine for a few weeks, however, so it won't happen immediately.\nStig\n. Hi Bob,\nI've had a look at this and a read-up of the implications and I think that I'm not going to merge this, I'm afraid. I'm sorry for letting you think so, but I thought static frameworks were now fully supported in Xcode4. As I understand it this is not the case, and we actually build a dynamic framework and replace the binary with a static lib. This is what I used to provide in the 2.2 series (or thereabouts) and it was a nightmare to maintain - 90% of my support requests (or something; the vast majority, certainly) was people having issues with it. This is partly why I no longer do binary releases.\nStig\n. This cache gave quite a bit of performance when parsing typical JSON where\nif you have a list of dictionaries, for example, you tend to get the same\nstrings (the dictionary keys) repeated again and again.\nThe idea behind making it static was that strings would stay cached even\nacross calls to the category methods, which instantiate a new parser for\neach call. However, I agree it may be a bit heavy-handed. I could be swayed\nto move it to the instance instead of being a static cache. Especially if it\ndoesn't affect performance much.

The 3.0-line of development already handles NSData.\n. I think this is a FAQ:\nThe new (3.0) linker apparently has a bug that causes -ObjC to not be processed correctly on device builds. If you have a category in a static library--and try to reference a method in that category--it will work on the simulator but crash on the device.\nThe solution is to include the linker flag -all_load in addition to -ObjC. If that is not an option, you could try to use the SBJsonParser or SBJsonWriter objects directly rather than the category methods.\n(Thanks to Greg Pasquariello)\n. Unicode escaping is handled automatically. I'm afraid your question is too vague. Please provide some more details.\n. That doesn't sound right. Can you please show your input, and a piece of code that shows this behaviour?\n. I can't reproduce this. Please put together some piece of code / input that demonstrates the problem.\n. I'm going to close this issue. I believe it must be related to the way you are parsing the JSON out of the web page.\n. SBJson does decode properly escaped strings. I wonder if your terminal doesn't display the unicode characters. Notice that the case has changed from \\u00c3 to \\U00c3?\n. Did try passing in valid JSON? If you consult http://json.org/ you will note that \\U3042 is not a valid JSON unicode escape sequence. As I told the previous poster, note the difference between \\uXXXX (which is valid) and \\UXXXX (which is not).\n. That should work. Decoding \\uXXXX unicode escapes is a core functionality that you don't have to turn on. \n\nCan you show the data? Perhaps a URL, so I can look at the real source?\n. I'm afraid that code will NEVER work with SBJson because it is not valid JSON unicode escape. (It might be a valid Objective-C unicode escape, but that only matters if it exists in strings in your code.) Please read my previous posts again: the case is important. So \\u3042 should work.\n. Mt test suite covers Unicode escapes. The test cases are here: \nhttps://github.com/stig/json-framework/tree/master/Tests/Data/valid/string\nI think your confusion is because you think that a character sequence like \\U3456 should be translated to the real Unicode character regardless of the source it comes from.

Hi dagerydoo,\n\nYour patch sounds interesting, but it won't merge now against master, I'm afraid. Can you redo it, but without adding a new target? Just change the sbjson-ios target. I have no interest in ever supporting a binary release, but one that will work easily with workspaces would be very nice.\n. Can you show a bit more of your code? I have a feeling that you're not waiting until you've received the full JSON document before you try to parse, but instead parse the first response you get from the -connection:didReceiveData: method. Is that correct?\nIf that's the case your code is broken and there's two ways to fix it. Either do what this tutorial shows http://mobileorchard.com/tutorial-json-over-http-on-the-iphone/ and accumulate the  JSON before parsing, or use the streaming capabilities of the parser. (Might require a bit of re-engineering, but could end lowering latency.)\nExample of using streaming API is here: https://github.com/stig/json-framework-examples/tree/master/TweetStream\n. I think you are right. I have resisted a name change for too long. A 3.0 release might be the time to do it.\n. Fixed in master. Github rename might come later...\n. The comment is wrong.

I had to roll this back, as it means you can't use it on 4.3. I thought ARC was a compile-time only thing, but it appears it requires run-time support only present in iOS 5+. As a work-around you can link to the library or do the conversion in your own project.\n. I don't see this. It's a singleton - there shouldn't be any leaks there.\n.

Essentially, it has to parse a set of data like thus:\n[{\"WORD_TYPE\":\"noun\"}, {\"WORD_TYPE\":\"verb\"}]\nThis is simplified (eventually there will be multiple words with types as well as definitions.) With the expanded dataset as well as this one, it parses properly by splitting each word and its related keys into an array entry. For example, I have this parsed into an array and it returns two entries: one containing {\n   \"WORD_TYPE\" = noun;\n}\nand one containing {\n   \"WORD_TYPE\" = verb;\n}\nwhich is perfect. For the second part, however, I want each of these entries stored into their own NSDictionary, with the key of \"WORD_TYPE\" and the value of \"verb\". This is the part where the parser fails, giving me 2011-07-11 03:51:30.493 shmoop[2190:207] -[__NSCFDictionary dataUsingEncoding:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x4c35cd0\n2011-07-11 03:51:30.494 shmoop[2190:207] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[__NSCFDictionary dataUsingEncoding:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x4c35cd0'.\nCould you give me some insight Stig?

Ah, I see: the problem is this line:\n\nNSDictionary *cityList = [[jsonParser objectWithData:jsonData] autorelease];\nthe data is already autoreleased when it's returned from objectWithData:, so your extra autorelease is causing the problem.\n. Hi Bob,\nThe intention is that you should be able to parse huge datasets. However, there may be bugs... Can you show some of your code? Would adding an @autoreleased {} block somewhere help? \nStig\nOn 17 Aug 2011, at 00:36, bobmccune wrote:\n\nI'm running into an issue attempting to parse large datasets with the new streaming parser.  The problem stems from how memory is being managed in the framework.  Specifically, each invocation of SBJsonUTF8Stream's getSimpleString method creates an autoreleased string that won't get released the current pool is drained.  In my case that amounts to 100s of megabytes of wasted memory which obviously causes a crash.\nAm I misunderstanding the intent of this API?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/stig/json-framework/issues/93\n.

This helped quite a bit in my use case.  I think adding an autorelease pool inside the parse method would largely solve the remaining memory concerns.  I could add one around my call to parse:, but IMO it would be cleaner to not push that responsibility onto the caller.\nThe main reason we're running into this problem is that we parse these large arrays with each element holding up to a 500k chunk of html.  The volume of temporary strings that get created gets out of control when we encounter multi mb docs.  I'll see if there's a sample I can share.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/stig/json-framework/issues/93#issuecomment-1822596\n.

Yes, I think ARC would probably be a great fit for this.  We're starting to prep for our move to ARC so I'll be interested to see what you do in this regard.\nIn the meantime, I'm planning on adding an NSAutoReleasePool to SBJsonStreamParser's parse method to clean up anything that occurred in that invocation of parse.  Do you have an concerns about doing this?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/stig/json-framework/issues/93#issuecomment-1823446\n. Is the autorelease pool solving the issue?\n. Hi Bob,\n\nI've pushed a branch, issue93, with my version of your changes in issue 94. Can you please test with this?\nAlso, I'm curious to know: which streaming interface are you using? The really low-level one, or the higher-level one provided by the SBJsonStreamParserAdapter? I'm asking because I was considering removing the low-level one in 3.1 or higher, but if you're using it I should probably keep it :)\n. I've just released 3.0.4 which contains this fix.\n. I've augmented branch3.0 with my own version of your patch, using the @try { ... } @finally { } construct. Can you see if that works for you?\n. Ok, I'll see if I can re-instate it under a different name, so it\ndoesn't appear to be the primary supported protocol.\n. Oops, I screwed up. I'd not committed all the changes. I've fixed it now. Can you try again?\n. Great! I'll try to push this in an official release soon.\n. I don't object to the skipping the install but removing the instance variables was a change I did only recently. 64 bit runtime has been supported since at least leopard, maybe even tiger. I won't merge that part. \n. The 3.0 branch (which is the current stable release) does support 32 bit - but 3.1 will not.\n. Yeah, that's becoming a bit out of date now. Look at the examples in the 3.0 distribution for some Xcode4.2-compatible solutions.\n.

You'd normally do something like:\n\ngit remote add stig <full repo path>\ngit fetch\ngit rebase stig/master\nbut don't sweat it, I've merged this now.\n. I think you've misread RFC 4627:\n```\n2.5.  Strings\nThe representation of strings is similar to conventions used in the C\n   family of programming languages.  A string begins and ends with\n   quotation marks.  All Unicode characters may be placed within the\n   quotation marks except for the characters that must be escaped:\n   quotation mark, reverse solidus, and the control characters (U+0000\n   through U+001F).\n...\n```\nThey go on to show a list of ALLOWED escape sequences. You seem to have confused them with REQUIRED ones.\n. :)\n. There doesn't appear to be anything wrong with the JSON on any of those URLs. I plugged them both into my DisplayPretty example (shipped in the distribution) and they both parse just fine.\nDid you use NSURLConnection to get the page content? Did you pass partial content to SBJsonParser? If you want to incrementally parse a document downloaded by NSURLConnection you need to use SBJsonStreamParser. Otherwise, you'll need to aggregate the results in an NSMutableData instance and parse that once you get the parse finished message from NSURLConnection.\nStig\nOn 25 Sep 2011, at 17:48, andi1984 wrote:\n\nIf I'm using http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=test&result_type=recent&count=5 as a json-source, I get the error message \"-JSONValue failed.

Hi ersinacar,\n\nSBJson should translate any string input to UTF8 when it's encoding. But, SBJson doesn't deal with connections, nor does it have a search box, so I'm afraid I don't understand what your problem is. You need to provide a bit more information about what you are trying to do. \nStig\n. Which version of SBJson? Which version of Xcode? What is the error from clang? \n. For the version number you won't go far wrong by checking the Changes file. (It's also present in the SBJson-Info.plist file.)\nYou're saying Xcode4.2 now, while the subject says Xcode4. I'm assuming you used a version of SBJson lower than 3.1alpha3 then, and that you used ARC.\nI recently added support for ARC to the master branch. I suspect that's the reason.\n. 3.1alpha3 version works, right?\nI suspect that the version that didn't work was 3.1alpha2, or previous.\n. If you're using Xcode4 you'll need to download SBJson 3.0.4. Or, if you want to use the latest release you'll have to upgrade to Xcode4.2 and use ARC.\n. No, that's not a JSON encoding. It looks like HTML, or XML entity encoding. \nStig\nOn 31 Oct 2011, at 08:18, markb63 wrote:\n\nWhen I run the parser on a string that has an encoded apostrophe it remains \u2019  Should the parser handle this?\nThanks.\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/stig/json-framework/issues/107\n.

Yep, that is a bug. I've been treating NSDecimalNumber as a BigNum, which is not the case.\n. This is a bit of a wasp's nest. As you say an NSNumber representing a double supports base 10 exponents up to 308, with just under 17 decimal digits of precision. NSDecimalNumber doesn't support as high maximum values (base 10 exponent only up to 127) but in exchange supports much higher precision (38 digits).\n\nThere are several options:\n1. Always use NSNumber (i.e. a double) for floating point numbers. This would support larger/smaller values than now, at the cost of lower precision.\n2. Continue to use NSDecimalNumber, meaning we support high precision but not so large/small numbers.\n3. Try to do intelligently pick the best choice of the above based on the length of the mantissa and/or exponent.\nRegardless of the method we choose, we should return an error unless we can faithfully represent the number that we parsed. (I.e. if there would be a rounding error.)\n. First (and ugly) cut at 2 + error on overflow above: https://github.com/stig/json-framework/compare/master...issue-127 \n. Yeah, 2 is a bit of a cop-out. I agree that 1 or 3 would be better solutions, but I would think that initially reporting an error rather than silently truncating the number is a good first step while I think about how to implement the improvement. The number parsing is getting rather hairy and I'd like to take this opportunity to clean it up a bit.\n. Because the current implementation uses nsdecimalnumber and its implementation sacrificed range of max/min values for greatly increased precision. I'm currently leaning towards just using double, but I haven't had a chance to make the change yet. \nThis fix warrants a 3.2 release (or even 4.0) due to the precision changes it might cause. \nStig\n\nSent from my iPhone\nOn 14 Oct 2012, at 02:29, Thanapon Noraset notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nwhy are DECIMAL_EXPONENT_MIN and DECIMAL_EXPONENT_MAX set to very low absolute value?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. You could always patch SBJson locally to do that. If you know you don't need support for a range outside of what NSDecimalNumber supports it's a simple case of using it instead of the creating a double. \n\nAnother option may be to send the number as integer nominator/denominator parts of a fraction? As long as each integer is less than 21 digits SBJson will never round anything. You can then create a NSDecimalNumber yourself from those. That doesn't require any patching of SBJson.\n. I looked for a BigNum library for SBJson--and indeed I thought NSDecimalNumber was it for a while, until I realised how it actually worked!\n.

What was this about?\n. No problems.\n. There's primarily two reasons:\n1. Support. Failing to specify the (frankly, magic) flags to get categories working on iOS is the biggest issue people have with the library. (Except perhaps imagined memory leaks, from people steadfastly compiling SBJson without ARC support.) See here\n2. Support, again. When the category methods return nil, there's no obvious way to get at the error. In 3.x the methods NSLog the error, but it's not ideal. I don't want to throw exceptions either.\n\nSaying that, the methods were deprecated in 3.2 - they will only be deleted in the 4.0 release. I do not intentionally break backwards compatibility in minor version releases! :-)\nTBH, iOS 5 was released 15 months ago. I wouldn't expect anyone to use SBJson for new apps now if NSJSONSerialisation covers their need. If you go to the bother of installing a third-party JSON library for the benefit of calling a convenient category method I'd say you were crazy. And streaming support can't / won't be done via category methods.\nIf you're adding JSON support to an iOS 4 app at this point, I'd say you have bigger problems than having to call [[SBJsonParser new] objectWithString:foo] which is all the category methods really gave you.\n. Glad to help!\n. Hi Joshua,\nThis change is to allow me to focus on what makes this library stand out, which now really is streaming support. It is important to note that the coding master, which you've just pulled, is what will become 4.0. I do not change backward compatibility in minor releases. (Intentionally.) \nIt is difficult to say how many use that second argument, of course, since I don't instrument the library in any way. But I can say with certainty that nobody who have had a problem and posted on stack overflow showed that they used it in any meaningful way. I think people simply don't understand how to use these error pointers. \nAnd, by the way, now that Objective-C has blocks I think it would be much nicer to provide a block based interface. This also ties in with the idea of an event-based/streaming interface.\nStig \nSent from my iPhone\nOn 27 Feb 2013, at 13:32, Joshua Moody notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nhey stig,\ni just pull the latest json-framework into my project and was surprised to see these methods removed. i am not arguing for or against, but i am curious to know why you decided to remove them from the API?\nthanks for the framework - i use it extensively.\njjm\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

I want to discourage people from doing so because they don't know of Apple\u2019s offering. \nStig\n. Hi Andrew,\nI'm a little confused about your statements above. Here's Apple's description of NSDecimalNumber:\n\nNSDecimalNumber, an immutable subclass of NSNumber, provides an object-oriented wrapper for doing base-10 arithmetic. An instance can represent any number that can be expressed as mantissa x 10^exponent where mantissa is a decimal integer up to 38 digits long, and exponent is an integer from \u2013128 through 127.\n\nAFAIK you cannot rely on long long to be more than 64 bits, which means ~20 integer digits. And indeed, your patch breaks three tests that tests the limits of integer lengths, including the test for Snowflake (Twitter's ID scheme) compatibility:\n- https://github.com/adonoho/json-framework/blob/DDG-SBJson/src/test/resources/main/number_int05.in\n- https://github.com/adonoho/json-framework/blob/DDG-SBJson/src/test/resources/main/number_int06.in\n- https://github.com/adonoho/json-framework/blob/DDG-SBJson/src/test/resources/main/number_snowflake.readme\nCould it be that the way you are reading from the NSDecimalNumbers is causing the rounding you're seeing?\n. You're right. \nThere is definitively something fishy going on here. It's weird; it almost looks like a bug in NSDecimalNumber itself because it stringifies correctly:\n(lldb) po dict[@\"id\"]\n348188955398766593\nbut we get an off-by-one for longLong (and unsignedLongLong) values:\n```\n(lldb) p (long long)[dict[@\"id\"] longLongValue]\n(long long) $9 = 348188955398766592\n(lldb) p (unsigned long long)[dict[@\"id\"] unsignedLongLongValue]\n(unsigned long long) $11 = 348188955398766592\n```\nIn contrast, for the id_str, we get:\n```\n(lldb) p (long long) [dict[@\"id_str\"] longLongValue]\n(long long) $18 = 348188955398766593\n(lldb) p (long double)[dict[@\"id_str\"] doubleValue]\n(long double) $20 = 348188955398766592\n```\nWhat. Is. Going. On?\nDouble-precision IEEE floating point, is what. It looks like NSDecimalNumber's conversion to long long goes via double, which has only 17 decimal digits of precision. 348188955398766593 is 18 digits long, and so we get this rounding error.\nSo yes; you were right. My tests were inadequate. NSDecimalNumber has been a sticking point for a while (see issue #128). This might provide motivation to finally remove it. \nLet me mull this over over the weekend.\n. Manually merged.\n. I already did earlier today. Thanks!\nStig\nSent from my iPhone\nOn 22 Jun 2013, at 17:03, \"Andrew W.

You need to create parser like this:\nid parser =  [[SBJsonParser alloc] init];\nOR:\nid parser = [SBJsonParser new];\n- The class was renamed to SBJson4Parser in version 4.\n- The objectWithString: method no longer exists in version 4. You need to read the documentation: http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/SBJson/4.0.1/Classes/SBJson4Parser.html -- if this is not clear, please raise new bugs about it.\n. Thanks! Will do. \n.

Hi @robb,\n\n\nI've attempted to review this but there's just too many things going on here for me to pull it. Let me restate that I am happy to support Carthage, but I have some issues with this implementation. Specifically:\n- I would prefer the header file to not be renamed, and stay named SBJson4.h.\n- I would rather the source & test files were not. (If Carthage support cannot be achieved without it I will reconsider, but please do the rename as a separate pull request.)\n- I don't want to go the route of an explicit module map; as mentioned above I'd rather see the framework renamed to contain the major version in the name (c.f. libc6, limxml2, etc).\n- I am very happy for prefix headers to be removed, but please submit a separate pull request for this.\n- I am OK to update deployment targets etc.\n- If we can manage to update the CI target to run tests for carthage too, that would be ideal. (That being the whole point of the pull to start with.)\nI'm sorry I've taken so long to get back to. Hope the above is clear. \n. > I would prefer the header file to not be renamed, and stay named SBJson4.h.\n\nI don't want to go the route of an explicit module map; as mentioned above I'd rather see the framework renamed to contain the major version in the name (c.f. libc6, limxml2, etc).\nSo we're looking at two frameworks named SBJson4.framework (with different target names) as well as a single libSBJson.a for iOS 7 and lower. Right?\nWith iOS9 already in beta I don\u2019t really see a point of supporting iOS7 and lower. There\u2019s no change in actual code, so they can stick with the previous version.\nI would rather the source & test files were not.\nI assume you meant \"moved around\"? It's not necessary at all\n\nYes, that\u2019s what I meant. Sorry for the ambiguity, it was late at night :-)\nStig\n. @hotbott not in its current state, sorry. I'm keeping this open in case someone is willing to address the comments I made here.\n. For information for anyone interested in working on this, and if it was not clear already, any resulting framework should be named SBJson4, i.e. have the 4 as part of the name / classes / headers. This is so that it can be used in the same project as SBJson3 -- since version 4 breaks backwards compatibility.\n. A Carthage framework was added in #216\n. I've restarted, but it's not finished yet:\nhttps://travis-ci.org/stig/json-framework/builds/71935020\n. Bah, not needed.\n.

Why 3.2 compatibility was dropped?\nVersion 4 and above has an incompatible interface with version <4.

Further, you can install both from cocoa pods.

I'm going to leave this open, on the grounds that I may want to add this one day, but right now I don't think it's right for this library. Buck is (still) faster moving than Xcode, so it would be more maintenance keeping up with its changes. Also, my main interest in using Buck was to avoid the Xcode project altogether, and just generate an Xcode file, but it doesn't support Mac (only iOS) as far as I can see so this is not practical at the moment.\n. Thanks for the bug report! I am afraid I haven't had a chance to look at\nthis yet. It would be a lot easier for me to look into if you managed to\nadd a failing test case to the existing test framework!\n. Hi @AFSlayer,\nSorry about the time to get back to you. I cannot reproduce the issue, I'm afraid. I added your broken JSON to my test suite in https://github.com/stig/json-framework/pull/221 and it is correctly reported as an error for me. Can you please share more details about how this occurs for you?\nStig\n. I believe this is probably due to broken UTF8. There was a complete overhaul of the UTF8 validation in v4.0.4, so as I cannot reproduce this I'm going to assume it was fixed there. If you can reproduce this crash with the latest v4 release (v4.0.5 at the time of writing) then please re-open this issue or create a new one!. Thank you for the updated bug report. I'll re-open the ticket and try to schedule some time to look into it. . I believe (but can't confirm at the moment) that the test failures are due to your removal of XCTest dependencies?\n. I am afraid I have no idea. Do you have any information about what data it was attempting to write when this crash occurred?\n. I'm not sure there's much I can do here. Seems like you may want to raise a bug against NSString instead? It crashes on this line:\nobjc\nconst char *utf8 = [string UTF8String];\nSo, as far as I can see an instance of NSString is causing a crash when the -UTF8String method is called on it. \n. I am going to close this. I believe it to have been fixed in a fairly major round of bug fixes in v4.0.4.. Patch including failing test case (with or without fix!) very welcome! :-)\nIt's been years since I did any Objective-C in anger now, so I'm a bit rusty.\nNicolas Seriot notifications@github.com writes:\n\nSBJson4Parser will crash when parsing invalid UTF-8 strings such as [\"\\xFF\"].\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. Hi @nst, thanks for the report. How did you get this crash? Adding your example to my test suite detects the broken JSON and reports the byte index in the input where it fails, c.f. https://github.com/stig/json-framework/pull/220\n. BTW, I admit I was prompted into looking into this more closely by your Parsing JSON is a Minefield post. Thanks for the motivation :-)\n. \"Maintaining\". Heh. I've done little more than merging legit-seeming PRs in the last few years. Last time I opened Xcode was probably Xcode 5 or 6... I'll let you in on a secret: I've never even used this library myself, outside its tests. (Although I worked at a company where they used it. I wrote Scala there.) I wish people just used NSJSONSerialisation tbh. Although as you have pointed out, that has issues too. \n. Alright, that looks like a bug then. Thanks for the clarification! I did indeed misunderstand your initial report.\n. Just a quick note that I've found the reason for this crash, and am planning to fix it.\n. PR to address this bug is here: https://github.com/stig/json-framework/pull/220\n\nI think I may have just slain this beast of a bug!\n. I decided to track this as part of #219 \n.

This is a backwards incompatible change, so I am contemplating making it an option, or just sucking it up and calling it SBJson 5.\n. I see no reason why it shouldn't be; tvOS just didn't exist when the podspec was created! Can you try making your own local podspec and see, and if you're successful report back with details so I can add it to the main podspec?. Hi Andrew,\nThanks for the contribution! How are you seeing these warnings you're addressing? I don't see them anywhere with the latest Xcode. Are you overriding any build settings to get these?\nI don't like the idea of adding pragmas to hide errors / warnings. As you say, that's not really the right fix. I am open for an actual fix, though I'd like to be able to reproduce the warning / error you're seeing too.\nThe second change seems to not go quite far enough; I think it should probably change the call sites to use unsigned long too. Although, I wonder if NSUInteger would suffice.. Thank you for the explanation! Having reviewed the 'repeated use of weak' situation, I believe you're right in your assessment that it's probably low risk. The _state variable holds a weak reference to singleton objects, so they should not simply disappear. However, because they are singleton objects it's probably also OK to make this a strong variable. If you don't mind, I would be interested in what you think a proper fix would look like. (I've not been doing much Objective-C / Mac / iOS programming for a few years, other than fixes to this library, so I'm not really up with best practices. The last few releases have mainly been due to contributions from the public. Thank you for being one of the contributors!)\nPS: I rolled your sign-comparison change into https://github.com/stig/json-framework/pull/251 . > On an unrelated issue, I am confused as to why you use a singleton's shared instance instead of a per stream parent instance? While switching to a parent instance won't solve the weak/strong problem, it would remove doubts about thread safety due to inadvertent state sharing.\nThese singletons have no state, just behaviour. I cannot remember why I chose that particular design, but if I had to guess it was probably an occurence of premature optimisation :P \nMore seriously, and if I understand you correctly, I suspect that the most common use case is to create a short-lived parser/writer when necessary, so singletons should require a little less resources. And there's only one copy necessary even for multiple parsers. \nNevertheless using per-stream parent instance for the state objects sounds like it could have been a good idea, and if I were to do it again I might have chosen that. I doubt I'll implement it myself, but if you feel strongly about it feel free to shoot me a PR and I'll evaluate it!. I'll merge this as soon as Travis confirms it's good.. Hi @zac24,\nI see you're using SBJson v4, which is good, but are you able to let me know which minor/patch version as well? There were some fairly major fixes in version 4.0.4 (and to a lesser degree in 4.0.5) that could have caused this. If you're not already on 4.0.5 I would be very grateful if you could try to upgrade and see if that helps. If you are already on 4.0.5 I would be even more grateful if you manage to come up with a test case that demonstrate the crash!\nSince 4.0.4 I've been running American Fuzzy Lop to test for crashes in SBJson on release candidates, and despite running it for 24 hours I've not found any errors. So I'm afraid I cannot reproduce the behaviour you're seeing.\nI've also looked at the code and I can't quite make sense of the error. It seems to say that obj is nil (and that key is \"note\") but the first line of the method has an assert to check if obj is nil.... are you by any chance compiling SBJson from source, with asserts turned off...? There's nothing wrong with that, per se; but I would have to re-evaluate my expectations about asserts being raised.. Thank you! Looking forward to hearing from you again on this matter :-). Thank you for reporting back with the good news! I will close this issue then.. ",

Check this against http://www.hypergurl.com/urlencode.html and it will decode properly in UTF-8. Ridiculously, that apple function actually decodes it properly if u give it ASCII mode. But ascii mode will break this: %E2%98%85 which is valid UTF-8 too and is the star character. These are what they both should decode to:\n%E2%98%85  -> \u2605\n%ED%A0%BDdd25%E2%9A%A1%ED%A0%BDdc3a%ED%A0%BDdca9%ED%A0%BCdf1f%E2%9C%A8%ED%A0%BDdc37%ED%A0%BDdc93 -> \ufffd\ufffd\ufffddd25\u26a1\ufffd\ufffd\ufffddc3a\ufffd\ufffd\ufffddca9\ufffd\ufffd\ufffddf1f\u2728\ufffd\ufffd\ufffddc37\ufffd\ufffd\ufffddc93 \nif I can get stringByReplacingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding to decode this properly, then your json parser(with the changes I did) will correctly convert the string into utf-8.

Thanks for extremely quick response. Sending as nominator/denominator is something I have wondered myself, but then again that feels uglier than sending numbers as strings, which I wouldn't like to do either (but seriously need to consider).

I don't see that much point in using SBJson over native NSJsonSerialization class except for that...\nReally too bad, since in Java (backend and Android) handling decimals can be easily made quite safe using BigDecimal class, and there are json-bignum implementation for JavaScript too for cases where precision is more important than performance. So iOS is my only problem.\n. Yeah, it's a bit lazy for Apple to create a NSDecimalNumber and not go all the way with a BigInteger implementation to accompany it, the small exponent range also comes from the quite limited integer part.

But you're right that just adding an initialiser should be ok as well, I'll think about it.\n@Coeur yeah the Swift enum would be quite elegant, although it still wouldn't work very well as default, because it causes quite much extra work to do a switch-case for each number to get the value.

But you're right that just adding an initialiser should be ok as well, I'll think about it.\n@Coeur yeah the Swift enum would be quite elegant, although it still wouldn't work very well as default, because it causes quite much extra work to do a switch-case for each number to get the value. Not to mention It should include at least Int64 for integer values as well, which complicates it further.\n. ",

It's not really central to this feature, is it?\n\u2015\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. > I would prefer the header file to not be renamed, and stay named SBJson4.h.\nI don't want to go the route of an explicit module map; as mentioned above I'd rather see the framework renamed to contain the major version in the name (c.f. libc6, limxml2, etc).\n\nSo we're looking at two frameworks named SBJson4.framework (with different target names) as well as a single libSBJson.a for iOS 7 and lower. Right?\n\nI would rather the source & test files were not.\n\nI assume you meant \"moved around\"? It's not necessary at all :ok_hand: \n\nI am very happy for prefix headers to be removed, but please submit a separate pull request for this.\n\nSee #205 \n. Hmm, the tests failed with:\n\nTest target sbjson-iosTests encountered an error (Test process crashed)\n\nCould you restart them, maybe?\n. ",
