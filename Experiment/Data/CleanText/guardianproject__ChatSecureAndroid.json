    "eighthave": "I tested today's build on a Droid/2.2.1 and a Wildfire/CM7 and they both accepted friend invitations properly, so I'm closing the issue.\n. I just had this happen to me using the gptest@jabber.ccc.de account, but now I can't reproduce it...\n. I added this with today's commits, check it out and let me know what you think\n. The Account Setup screen and the Account Settings preferences should now do this.\n. I don't quite understand the issue here.  It sounds like you mean you are using a foo@gmail.com account in both Adium and Gibberbot, and when a different app becomes active, Gibberbot didn't recognize it should use a different OTR key?\n. has this been solved on any of the desktop OTR clients?  Or is Gibberbot performing worse than others?  From my experience, the only way to get reliable OTR across multiple clients simultaneously is to use the exact same key in all running clients.\n. I can add my experience:\n- added a new account\n- no contact list at all just \"Outgoing Chats\"\n- killed app and restarted\n- the groups appeared, but it didn't seem to have all contacts (I could be wrong there)\n- the app lost net/XMPP connection\n- the contacts where gone\n- it signed in, still gone\n- I did sign in/out\n- the contacts are back\n. I think this is fixed with the most recent builds, its working on my Droid and Wildfire.  Can anyone else confirm?\n. This is now working for me, Derek can vouch for it ;)  Please reopen if anyone encounters this again.\n. I think this is fixed in the most recent builds, I just tried it on the Wildfire, with the fullscreen text entry mode and it worked nicely.\n. n8fr8 says: we can tune all those fields up with InputType.* options\n. fixed this by adding this line to AccountWizardActivity.parseAccount():\n        editAccountId.setInputType(InputType.TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_EMAIL_ADDRESS | InputType.TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS);\n. I think this is fixed with the most recent builds, but the flow of the account setup could definitely be improved.\n. Makes sense.  Isn't OTRv1 deprecated due to exploits in the protocol?  I suppose we could support OTRv1, but then only set the chat status to yellow, since it has known weaknesses.\n. Do you mean like Available/Idle/Away, or is there a separate priority setting that I am unaware of?\n. The tricky part here is how to go about doing this.  Should it just do a popup message saying they should disable DNS SRV?  Or if checking Tor automatically unchecks DNS SRV, then a working connection could then stop working (like a gtalk account), and people would blame Tor.\n. In the Account Wizard, I added logic so that when you enable Use Tor, it turns off Use DNS SRV.  That will only happen in the first time you enable it.  Once you click the Advanced Account Settings button, then Use Tor won't touch the DNS SRV setting.  I think this makes sense, since once people manually change it, it should be up to them.\n. makes sense, and on a related topic, I think we might want to change how the google settings are handled.  They are currently set in XMPPConnection, but instead, I think we should expose the options needed as preferences, then have the wizard set up the options based on the domain (i.e. gmail.com).  These two bits of work go hand in hand, they touch the exact same code.\n. I added this, should be working in today's commits\n. This is included in the \"Account Settings\" preferences on the Account Setup/AccountActivity.\n. with the most recent commits, the \"Hide Offline Contacts\" preference is working for me, both for hiding and showing offline contacts, based on the preference setting.  I'll leave this open until others confirm it works for them.\n. oops, seems that I rebroke this, I'll look into this.\n. Ok, I fixed it again, just committed.  Please reopen this if it doesn't work for you.\n. yeah, I've seen this too, I think it happens when XmppConnection tries a few different ways to connect, but then fails in the end.  Somehow it ends up communicating to the UI that it succeeded.\n. I think I fixed this one, I was testing using a jabber.ccc.de account for a while, and didn't see any strangeness.  Reopen if someone still has a problem there.\n. Thanks for the report, which version of Gibberbot was this?  Did you build from git or download from the Marketplace?  I think I have the same exact phone, so it should be easy to test.\n. On my Droid running 2.2.2 FRG83G using a jabber.org account, this is no longer a problem for me using today's build of Gibberbot.  So I'm going to close it, look for an update in the Marketplace soon!\n. Which version of Gibberbot are you using?  The one from the Marketplace?  We are about to release a new build which should have this fix.  (You could only have that code if you built from git source.)\n. in the first screen, user@mydomain.com should be in the Username, then in the pop-up preferences, Server should be talk.google.com, then Transport Encryption, should be off (Google's server will force it anyway), then Cert Verification should be off, and DNS SRV should be off.\n. I think it would be good to try SQLCiphering a simpler app first, perhaps SSC?  Gibberbot's database stuff is quite complicated, so I think it'll be a very hard place to start using the very new SQLCipher API.\n. Since Gibberbot is alpha, you usually need to uninstall the app before installing it.  On the Downloads page, you can see the versions are part of the filename.\nYou can see the version in the Android Settings -> Application -> Gibberbot, so it seems like it would be redundant to provide one ourselves.\nComment here again if things still aren't working for you.\n. Does it work fine before switching away from it?  What kind of SSL setup is it (i.e Jabber TLS, old SSL 5224, etc)?\n. here's the URL for the record (http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0016.html ).  Is it something that is required to communicate with those servers?  It seems to me that it is basically an elaborate, rules based system for blocking people from contacting you.\n. We are just nailing down the final details before we start the next phase of this work, which will include a technique for syncing keys between Pidgin and Gibberbot, among other things.\n. A solution is in the works, and is quite close to being usable:\nhttps://github.com/guardianproject/otrfileconverter\nits in the \"works for me\" state, now I just need to get it usable by others.\n. I just got Jitsi export working in OTRFileConverter, so it'll take Jitsi's files and generate a Gibberbot otr_keystore.  Gibberbot should be able to import its own format, and then leave the rest to OTRFileConverter.\nThe tricky part of importing otr_keystore on Android is not writing it out to the SDCard somewhere.  Maybe you could implement something where if you receive a file called 'otr_keystore' via XMPP file transfer, prompt the user whether they should use it as their key file.  Then there is also issues of syncing, which we are working on.  Some kind of basic import would be quite useful to have now, as we figure out how to do the syncing properly.\n. We definitely have ideas for syncing and transferring, but its still pretty rough and very much open to discussion.  Right now, we're splitting our thinking into \"syncing\" and \"import/export\" and handling the syncing in otrfileconverter, so we can handle syncing in a single place and have it apply to many apps.  I think that's the right place for syncing to happen rather than in Gibberbot.  I think Gibberbot should have a secure method for importing and exporting the whole otr_keystore, and ultimately a method for syncing it.\nWe've tried to keep the our wiki up-to-date on what we're thinking about.  This is part of our PSST project, so you'll find info here: https://guardianproject.info/wiki/PSST\n. Did you try turning off DNS SRV in the Gibberbot settings?\n. This is great, eager to test it!  I'm working on some changes to otr4j\nalso, but to allow key importing/exporting, so it might make sense to\nput these changes together for the testing.\n.hc\nOn 02/16/2012 12:10 AM, Dev Random wrote:\n\nThis is not yet ready for prime time, but we can start integrating.\nThe integration point is OtrSm.

It should work regardless of the server, as long as you have an OTR session up.\n. @n8fr8 says: \"one source of OTR failing seems to be corruption of the keystore props file we use.  a) not sure why the corruption happens and b) we have no good way to recover from it\"\n. I reproduced this using the latest code in git between ChatSecure and Gajim.  OTR would not start at all, then I Force Quit ChatSecure, then it started working.  Trying to reproduce again...\n. I can reproduce it now:\n1. uninstall ChatSecure\n2. install ChatSecure\n3. setup existing XMPP account (e.g. gptest@jabber.org)\n4. attempt to start OTR conversation from Gajim (signed into gptest@jabber.ccc.de)\n\nIt looks like ChatSecure is trying to decrypt the initial OTR request, I don't know if that is the appropriate behavior or not:\nOtrChatListener  V  onIncomingMessage: ?OTRv2?_hc@jabber.ccc.de has r\n        OtrChatManager  V  decryptMessage: gptest@jabber.org/ChatSecure gptest@jabber.ccc.de/Gajim ?OTRv2?_hc@jabber.ccc.de has r\n. @n8fr8 ok, following up on the XMPP resources, have OTR Instance Tags been implemented in v14? or is there something else happening with XMPP resources?  I just had a session where ChatSecure was not receiving messages at all, and it seemed to be related to different XMPP Resources.\n. @n8fr8 I only see v14.0.4 in git, where is the code for the newer releases?\n. as for v14.0.4, I just got an OTR fail just now, with all of my commits on top of v14.0.4\n. @knoy it is each client's job to close its end of the OTR session.  Alice's XMPP client can only signal Bob's XMPP client that it is closing the OTR session. If Bob's does not act on that information, then there is not really anything that Alice's can do about that.\nAbout your instructions to reproduce the issue, you seem to imply that the client should have active sessions when upgrading.  If so, then I'd write that up like this:\n1. install v13\n2. start an OTR session with another ChatSecure v13\n3. upgrade to v14\n4. try to start an OTR session with that previous ChatSecure v13 user\nDoes that sound right? If not, please try breaking it out into steps like that\n. Something weird is going on in ChatSecure with the XMPP Resource.  I had an account logged in twice (chatSecure and gajim), then I used a different account on ChatSecure to invite to my contact list.  ChatSecure showed the Accept prompt twice, and Gajim did not get it.\n. I think I am getting closer.  I think that ChatSecure is getting confused on whether an OTR session is started or stopped.  I was once able to reproduce this when I sent \"Stop Encryption\" in ChatSecure, but I haven't gotten that one going again.  I just reproduced it this time by doing this between Gajim and ChatSecure:\n1. In Gajim (gptest@limun.org) end all OTR sessions and close chat window, but stay logged in.\n2. Shutdown & Lock in ChatSecure\n3. Force Quit ChatSecure\n4. Clear data for ChatSecure\n5. launch ChatSecure\n6. set up existing account in ChatSecure (gptest@jabber.org)\n7. launch chat session in ChatSecure with Gajim\n8. send two text messages (these show up as secure in ChatSecure, but in Gajim there is no sign of the OTR session)\n9. send a text message from Gajim to ChatSecure (this triggered the OTR negotiation to be shown in Gajim. then I sent a bunch of messages from Gajim and it seemed to stay encrypted, but Gajim refreshed the OTR after each message).\n10. I then started a new session from Pidgin to ChatSecure, no messages got through on either side.  Though the debug log showed that ChatSecure was sending stuff through OtrChatManager.  Pidgin did have the correct XMPP Resource for ChatSecure, so this problem is probably not related to the XMPP Resource, but rather the OTR state in ChatSecure.\nHere's a log file with some debug messages, but not quite enough to be fully useful:\nhttps://gist.github.com/eighthave/7a529585159a24051d64\n. One more thing on this topic, would be be useful to send the \"Finished\" message if ChatSecure is quitting or being upgraded?  Since the OTR state is maintained in memory, sending that message would reflect that ChatSecure is ditching all OTR state.\n. Here's a new odd twist on this bug.  I got into the OTR failing state with pidgin, to the point where even unencrypted messages don't go through.  I get to this pretty often when debugging since I think having ChatSecure get killed when an OTR session is established is a common way to trigger the problem.\nAnyway, in this case, after ChatSecure launched again, I tried sending plain non-OTR messages.  They would briefly appear in the correct location in the chat log, then they'd get their datestamp set to 1/1/70 and go to the top of the chat log.  Then as I was typing this, 5 minutes later, the messages were finally received in Pidgin, then ChatSecure updated the timestamps and put them in the right spot in the chat log.\nHere's a screenshot of the bad date state:\n\n. I can't reproduce this. I was able to do this fine without specifying the target for each one.\n. Looking at Pidgin and Gajim, they just set a static string in preferences for the XMPP.Resource.  Jitsi has the option of auto-generating an XMPP Resource by default in the preferences, so that implies that it is also remembered and reused.  So it sounds like we want ChatSecure to create then set the Resource itself and save it for future use.  It should probably also try to save any server-generated Resource. The code that actually creates the Resource should be in providerSettings.getXmppResource() to guarantee it is always created properly.\nThe XMPP RFC has good stuff to say on the topic (page 37, 38) http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3920.txt\n. @knoy this stuff is related, it could be a cause of failed OTR connections.\n. above is a quick fix for devrandom's last point. There are two commits that can be cherry-picked\n. So this could be implemented completely in the setPresence() method, to keep things simple:\njava\n     public void setPresence(Presence presence) {\n         mPresence = presence;\n        if (mPresence != null && mPresence.getResource() != null)\n            mAddress = new XmppAddress(mAddress.getBareAddress() + '/' + mPresence.getResource());\n     }\n. I just thought of another thing: but always setting mAddress, that ensures that writeToParcel() is also including the Resource.\n. But this doesn't seem to fix issue #520  for me.\n. I also like pretty apps and think it is important, I just think we need to\nprioritize and get a really stable release out.  The OTR stuff is still pretty\nproblematic, for example.\n. I don't know enough about the presense stuff to say much here.  But some info in the commit messages about why the changes were needed would be very helpful for understanding what's happening.  Sounds like one for @devrandom to review :-)\n. @ghost here is the best example for how a map app can share location in a flexible way:\nhttps://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/pull/1033\n. @ghost can you point me to MAPS.ME on f-droid?  I can't find it.\n. Maybe Apple's parser requires an Authority in the URI to be properly parsed.  I think the URI that @devrandom speced is valid according to the RFC, but not common (i.e. an Opaque URI with a path).  So it could be something like this:\nOFFER otr-in-band://chatsecure/storage/IMG_20141224_160749%281%29.jpg HTTP/1.1\nor perhaps it is better to use the packageName since that is a guaranteed unique ID on Android:\nOFFER otr-in-band://info.guardianproject.otr.app.im/storage/IMG_20141224_160749%281%29.jpg HTTP/1.1\n. Upon thinking about it a bit more, I think it definitely makes sense to include an Authority in the URI.  That would also allow for a username and password to be included in the URI.   I could see ChatSecure randomly generating One Time Passwords and including them in the URI's Authority.  Then ChatSecure could automatically delete access once the file has successfully fetched by the other side.\n. @devrandom I don't understand?\n. Also, https://github.com/n8fr8/gibberbot/commit/0bbb9082b1b1dd56e8509c8bfd9913e80e87bd7b should not be included since eighthave@df3cc88 fixes that issue.\n. We might be able to linkify media in the message using Linkify, that's why I stuck it where I did.  But I haven't yet looked into the details yet.  For example, perhaps it would linkify a QR Code image.  But maybe that's just silly.\n. AsyncTaskLoaders are quite useful.  This needs to use the android-support-v4 version of AsyncTaskLoader in order to support versions of Android older than API android-11: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/AsyncTaskLoader.html\n. oops, I meant this one:\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/AsyncTaskLoader.html\n. there were some API changes in cacheword, including removing the notification handling.  I guess that didn't affect chatsecure?  I guess I'm surprised, but I'll check it out in the morning for myself.\n. I think we should keep CacheWord as it is in ChatSecure v14.  There are no new features added in newer cacheword commits, just lots of cruft removed so that cacheword can be used in a project as a single jar.  This pull request doesn't work as is, loading these two commits into Eclipse and building gives me lots and lots of build errors related to CacheWord, here are some of them:\nCacheWordActivityHandler cannot be resolved to a type   LockScreenActivity.java /ChatSecure/src/info/guardianproject/otr/app/im/app line 53 Java Problem\nThe import info.guardianproject.cacheword.CacheWordActivityHandler cannot be resolved   LockScreenActivity.java /ChatSecure/src/info/guardianproject/otr/app/im/app line 29 Java Problem\nThe method getBlankServiceIntent(Context) is undefined for the type CacheWordService    WelcomeActivity.java    /ChatSecure/src/info/guardianproject/otr/app/im/app line 553    Java Problem\n. I got this working as I described, based on your commit.  So I'm closing this and will open a big merge request for all my recent work.\n. I just added a small commit to make bridge: links always clickable, whether ChatSecure is using Tor or not.  They should be safe links always, right?\n. I couldn't find anything that Slack supports OTR, @mike-pt could you point to some docs about that?\n. oh duh, I was thinking user to server.  Does Slack allow direct XMPP messages? Or only XMPP group messages?\n. everything else looks good\n. The open question is: why would mNotifyBuilder be null when networkStateChanged() is run.  mNotifyBuilder is set by if (mUseForeground) startForegroundCompat();  So I guess the notification is only ever shown when mUseForeground is true and mNotifyBuilder should be null, otherwise the notification will not be updated if mUseForeground is false.\n. @n8fr8 when mUseForeground is false, are the notifications also supposed to be updated?  Because in the current code, they will not be because mNotifyBuilder is only initialized when mUseForeground is true.\n. what about the \"chat received\" notification?\n. I don't enough about these bits to say much:\n- acb9becedb705f211c58947122eb22853b04dfe2\n- 93c4de07379dd8f1c44bb86869bee206901a98d9\n- ea91042b587628a1a88a66f14e7c48aacca9ad9d\notherwise, I think this is all ready to merge\n. this doesn't update libs/asmack-android-8.jar, which is what ChatSecure actually uses when it builds\n. otherwise, the code change itself seems fine\n. oops, sorry skimmed it too fast...\n. @n8fr8 ping\n. It would be easy to test this: install OLSRMeshTether, and click the Start button.  I have it working on a few HTC devices, doesn't seem to work on Samsung yet. I haven't tested too many others yet.\n. WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is needed so that it can delete the file after its imported\n. perhaps we want gibberbot to receive into IOCipher then offer a secure SEND Intent backed by a ContentProvider.  Then its up to the receiving end to decide whether that file gets made public or not\n. The chances of that line of code returning the default value should be none.  The preference should be guarateed to be set before ChatFileStore.init() is ever run because of the checks that happen in WelcomeActivity.  There, it sets the default based on whether it detected media store files on internal and/or external storage:\nhttps://github.com/eighthave/ChatSecureAndroid/commit/9c99e50c75e93269d28b64d1e147a00cd5b2c87c\n. if you manually configure the Google account as if it was a regular XMPP\naccount, it should be possible to do what you want.  But their XMPP\nsetup is complicated.\n. ",

Yes, I unfortunately found this one a bit difficult to explain in the initial write-up :) - but yes, your description is more or less what I'm describing.\nIt is linked to the concept of storing multiple keys for a contact - as that contact certainly may communicate via a desktop client as well as a mobile client like Gibberbot.

We've moved this issue here: https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/346\n. Thank you. What is your locale/language?\n. What language/locale are you on?\n. Did the contact list every load fast with the tabs?\n. I really think this is closed now actually. Haven't had this happen during a whole lot of testing. Please check the latest builds from the v8 branch if you can.\n. There was no observer set on the Cursor for subscriptions (aka friend requests) so something wasn't getting setup right when the friend request came in... the UI needs the Cursor to have the friend request data in it, so that it renders the ContactView row properly\nhttps://github.com/guardianproject/Gibberbot/commit/2d9328e28a3112a1a3980e2c45c7e9465f678cc1\n. We have moved to a tab-less UI that matches more the standard ICS/ABS mode: https://dev.guardianproject.info/news/42\n. moved issue here: https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/186\n. looking into now... in short, at the top of ContactListTreeAdapter you have a bunch queries specified which power these views:\nprivate static final String NON_CHAT_AND_BLOCKED_CONTACTS = \"(\"\n        + Imps.Contacts.LAST_MESSAGE_DATE + \" IS NULL) AND (\"\n        + Imps.Contacts.TYPE + \"!=\" + Imps.Contacts.TYPE_BLOCKED + \")\";\n```\nprivate static final String BLOCKED_CONTACTS = \"(\"\n    + Imps.Contacts.TYPE + \"!=\" + Imps.Contacts.TYPE_BLOCKED + \")\";\nprivate static final String CONTACTS_SELECTION = Imps.Contacts.CONTACTLIST\n        + \"=? AND \" + BLOCKED_CONTACTS;\nprivate static final String ONLINE_CONTACT_SELECTION = CONTACTS_SELECTION\n        + \" AND \"+ Imps.Contacts.PRESENCE_STATUS + \" != \" + Imps.Presence.OFFLINE;\n```\n. okay this is working now, but the \"buddy\" or contact shows up with a chat background in the Contact list. not a blocker, but something to consider.\ni think we can actually make it light up with a green background or something of that nature, to indicate there is an active session.\nhttps://github.com/guardianproject/Gibberbot/commit/9ad7ec2db8da4a71e6bb10f251332fcf079026ca\n. this is now addressed. there were many issue causing this including not properly loading the CACert store for verification, and not using SRV DNS correctly. It now works and has been tested with both third-party domains and @gmail\n. tcket moved here: https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/220\n. We will leave it required/enabled for now, as I think we have solved the buggy server issue.\n. i think this has been fixed... please test.\n. This is now fixed in the 0.0.5 release and beyond.\nWill do an official release shortly, but \"nightlies\" for testing can also be found here:\nhttps://guardianproject.info/builds/Gibberbot/\n. I think most of the issues have probably been addressed. The entire MainActivity/launch/UI has been refactored quite a bit. As this is a giant mega bug, I am going to close it because I think it is way too confusing to try and track otherwise.\nWe can reopen new tickets after the 0.0.5 release as new crash reports come in.\n. Cannot reproduce in any recent build\nhttps://guardianproject.info/builds/Gibberbot/\n. this is now solved in our 0.0.5 codebase.

Thanks. Will look at this right away!\n. We have \"allow plain text auth\" as a default turned on along with TLS required and verify on as well. Some XMPP services, like Gmail but also others, only support plain text over TLS.\n\nEssentially what happens is that when you enter in your usr/pwd the first time, we set some config defaults based on your domain, i.e. jabber.org has cert defaults. For a not known domain, we set TLS required, TLS verify ON, but also plain text auth ON.\nPerhaps our default should be plain auth OFF, even with TLS on.\nIf you have TLS off, we don't allow plain text auth at all, even if checked.\n. regarding the jid and SRV record,, the behavior is similar:\n1) the first time, we set a connect server default value based on the domain from your username.\n2) We also turn ON the SRV record, and if configured the value will override the connect server setting.\n3) For the connect server value to be used, SRV check but be turned off.\nAgain, you are saying we should not set a connect server by default, and instead we should just use SRV?\n. This should be addresses by this commit: https://github.com/guardianproject/Gibberbot/commit/a59b8d3e81c217a8ed388fa98a2da8d5ea71df5b\nand it will be in our next update.\n. I think there are two \"PLAIN\"'s, there is SASL Plain, and there is the non-SASL Plain over TLS that Google likes. \nWe need to think through how to expose this all to the user. Perhaps we should just ask What Would Pidgin Do?\n. Right. We had some issue with SASL Plain and Google that Hans (_hc) was dealing with. I will review that bit of code all again.\nThe Smack library handles precedence and SASL, so some of this is us digging down into that source to make sure it is doing what it says it is doing. In some cases, like with the TLS verification, we've forked the specific class, and moved it into our own package in order to take better control. Hopefully we won't have to do that here.\n. The latest dev build should address this issue\n http://guardianproject.info/builds/Gibberbot/2011-09-26_01-45-56/\nThe text should accurately reflect what is actually happening now. Sasl plain can be allowed on unencrypted connections if the box is checked.\nThis is not signed with our normal release key so you may need to first uninstall your current version. \n. Closing this out. If you can still repro in a recent build (such as https://guardianproject.info/builds/Gibberbot/2012-03-25_23-26-12/) please re-open/let us know!\nThe language remains this same, but the behavior should be accurate. If you have TLS/SSL off, then we won't allow a plain text auth w/o this checked.\nRegardless, no one in their right mind should be connected without TLS/SSL!\n. We are working on this issue, but won't really have something ready to share for a few weeks at least.\nOtherwise, it seems that Pidgin can handle multiple keys per user. Unfortunately, Gibberbot can only handle one at this point, and that one will write over the other previous one, even if verified. This is something we can also consider as a feature request.\nThanks for the testing, and please send more!\n. Our v12-alpha branch can now support importing OTR keyrings from Pidgin, Adium, Jitsi and elsewhere, using the OTRFileConverter desktop tool.\nYou can start testing this new feature here - look for the \"Import OTR Keys\" menu option on the main account screen:\nhttps://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/2fa3b9252319e47367f1f125bb3adcd1\n.

TLS required and verify?\nIs this a standard @Gmail account?\nWhat carrier are you on?\nThanks!\n. You need SRV enabled. I think when you checked \"use Tor\" it turned SRV off. This is a bug in that we need to set the Connect Server to \"talk.google.com\" if we turn SRV off. \nIf you do not have a Connect Server set, then you need SRV on so we can look it up via DNS.\nThe reason we do not want SRV with Tor, is that currently we cannot send DNS lookups through Tor, and so that would leak the domains you were trying to access via your normal DNS provider.\nPlease try with SRV back on.\n. Well, yes, then you also need to leave the TLS verify \"off\" because while talk.google.com will actually work for the XMPP connection, the cert that they will return to you is for talk.l.google.com I believe.\nBut yes, first, try SRV off with \"talk.google.com\" and no TLS verification to see if that works.\nThen try \"talk.l.google.com\" with TLS verification.\n.

There is definitely some issue with the Smack XMPP library we use and the Facebook XMPP service. We will work on debugging it some more in the next major release of Gibberbot. Thanks for the feedback!\n. Testing our latest v11 dev branch is showing no issues with Facebook. We've made a number of updates to both our XMPP and OTR libraries, so the issue could have been addressed.\n. done in v12\n. Are you logged in at the same time with the same account using Pidgin or Gajim? If you have two OTR apps logged into the same account at the same time, things can get quite confused.\n. Have you tried starting encryption on the Pidgin side and vice-versa? The initiation may be causing an issue.\nAlso, we are using OTRv2 only I believe.\n. uninstall on Gibberbot? i think perhaps the keystore file was not properly created then. Maybe we need a feature to do that. Thanks for reports!\n. thx! will take a look this weekend.\n. Looks great. The connection seems very solid now, at least against talk.google.com. I am testing on Samsung Galaxy Player wifi device over Tor/Orbot, on 2.3.5.\n. Great idea!\n. We do use tagged whitespace messages most of the time. We only send the ?OTRv2? query messages if you are actively trying to start and encrypted chat.\n. Currently we support Android 1.6 and up. In order to support move to SD card, we would need to limit our support to Android 2.2 and up, or build multiple versions. We will consider both in the next release.\nThanks for the feedback!\n. We can get support for this into the 1.0.7 release we are working on now.\n. Gibberbot is now only 2709958 aka 2.7MB. I am closing this ticket now.\n. You can just this in Gibberbot->Menu->Settings. It is entered as \"automatic\" by default.\n. It seems the \"as requested\" setting was actually based to enable OTR opportunistically, meaning it was the same as \"automatic\" in a sense.\n\"As requested\" is now set to Manual OTR, which should work just fine if the prompt comes from the other users, or the user enable it themselves.\nWe will do some more testing, but this should be solved in the next release.\n. this is now confirmed fix and will be in the next release\n. Is this on a GTalk account or with another Jabber/Xmpp server?\n. This is fixed now in the v10 release of Gibberbot: https://dev.guardianproject.info/news/42\n. We are now using the default system color scheme. Apologies for the transgression. You can find the latest release in our \"v8\" branch, which we will have as a public beta shortly.\n. implemented in v11\nhttps://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/345\n. most messages do have timestamps after a certain interval. the next release displays timestamps for every message.\n. i agree but... the problem that occurs now is that if you have a long conversation with short interchanges, you will not see a timestamp for a long time. it only checks the delta between the previous message in the chat, and not the author. this can leave a huge segment of chat visibly untimestamped. display timestamps for all is one of the most common requests I see, and matches what apps like WhatsApp, Line and others do.\n. Not as for as I can tell... the core Messaging app, and TextSecure for instance, don't.\nWhatsApp doesn't: http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/whatsapp-iphone-screenshot.png\nUltimately, we need to improve the design and do something clever to save space, I agree. However, for now, it is worse not having a timestamp where there should be on.\nI would also like to only show the time if it is the same day, etc, and other formatting cleanup. \nMaybe we can say \"If the previous message occured at the same Date, Hour and Minute then don't show a timestamp\" as opposed to doing the delta calculation?\n. app now shows timestamps for every message\n. That only shows up if you have an active encrypted session between the two. Disable encryption, and the message won't show up.\n. https://github.com/ge0rg/MemorizingTrustManager\n. done in v11\nhttps://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/445\n.

Testing is good. We have some new interns starting to help us with this!\n. testing this work out now... so just to be clear, the only UI work done is in the SampleApp, so we will need to create a new option for verification where we have show/scan fingerprint now?\n.

Gibberbot should handle this automatically, but you might want to check the advanced settings. SRV should be off, and the Connect Server should be set to talk.l.google.com. The latest v8 gibberbot does this automatically.\nDoes Orbot work for you otherwise? It connects and is green?\n. The issue with GApps ultimately is a specific user's idea that just like they can put an MX record for GApps in their custom domain, they should be able to put the XMPP SRV records. I do not think it is too much to ask them to enter the connect server, but for whatever reason Pidgin and Adium apparently handle this case fine w/o a connect server. We were trying to match the user experience there. \nThis would also be solved by using Georg's \"trust on first contact\" SSL trust manager, as it would simply present this user with a dialog to manual confirm their non-standard TLS cert.\n.

I think this is obviously a great security enhancement, and perhaps a requirement, but just trying to understand the usability implications.\n. Great!\n. Ah yes. Will look into getting more icons going with the ActionBar menus.\nAs for the chat list, i realized that actually active people you are chatting with are moved to the top of your buddy list, and if there are oustanding messages, they will be highlighted as well. So to get to a chat, you don't need the list.\nHowever, you are right on in thinking the chat list should be primary especially with the persistence of it now. there can be an entry \"start new chat\" as the top/lost entry in the list, which can open the buddy/contact list.\n. Yes currently there are no icons, because I didn't properly create menu-v11 resources with the :showActionBar parameter. Working on that now.\n. Some more updates on this UI work. The Chat List is now primary! Also I've implemented the home/back functionality on the actionbar icon for many screens. There is also a title bar dropdown in the contact list for switching between accounts, but it doesn't fully work yet.\n. > And another comment: the away message / status widget should probably be moved to the chat list view.\ndone\nas for the exception, that will be fixed shortly! (related to account selector dropdown thing)\n. done commit: commit 8f47c7730eda78819c071b9cf1f446d4ef005c9b\n. This has been merged into master!\n. We've done a lot of work improving the UI in our 12-alpha branch. I believe most of your layout and spacing issues area addressed.\nYou can find binaries for testing here:\nhttps://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/2fa3b9252319e47367f1f125bb3adcd1\n. It is possible that having a public intent that allows injection of a message by any app could be used a vector for attack.\n. v12 beta now supports file sharing, link sharing, test sharing, etc, when you have an OTR encryption session active.\nhttps://guardianproject.info/builds/Gibberbot/\n. This is now fixed in our v12 alpha branch.\nYou can start testing it here:\nhttps://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/2fa3b9252319e47367f1f125bb3adcd1\n. implement in v12... we show on and offline states now in the chat session.\n. this is fixed in our upcoming v11 release\nhttps://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/390\n. we have actually removed that code from Gibberbot core and moved it over to our new OnionKit library\nhttps://github.com/guardianproject/OnionKit/blob/master/library/src/info/guardianproject/onionkit/trust/StrongTrustManager.java#L607\n where we instead check for \"md5\"\nthis will be fixed in the next release of Gibberbot\n. Does this also remove the unnecessary error Toast messages that happen?\n. Okay will roll merge this, and then reintegrate OnionKit from here, as an /external submodule.\nI have made and pushed the necessary changes in OnionKit to stop notifications.\nOtherwise, should we integrate your branch of MemorizingTrustManager into OnionKit directly, since it already seems to be forking quite a bit?\n. thanks for the feedback. will work on this some more and commit changes to this same request.\n. @devrandom please review this previous commit. it is definitely a quick solution, but I think is right. A little tricky to test.\n. Marking issue as resolved in dev.gp and will have Mark work through various scenarios for testing.\n. so I should just leave this alone for now and/or just start getting familiar with it?\n. Is this ready to be merged into v12-alpha?\n. Can/Should we close this pull request now that we have the other one integrated?\nOr do we still want this for OTRv3 support?\n. Going to close this, since we are working on rebasing on top of OTR4j and getting OTRDATA support into the main library.\n. I removed the modifications to XmppAddress in favor of storing the resource as presence data, only for display. I am going to merge this giant mess now, so I can get back to smaller pull request/branches.\n. We have a master password now, and full encryption of all data in the app. \nv12 is now in beta testing. Standy for a release soon!\n. Are you using the Jabber/XMPP account option, and not \"Google Account\"? I assume yet.\nAre you using two-factor auth on your Google account?\nObviously we must support the non Google apps ROMs.\n. this is now fixed with the latest v12 release. you can now login to Google with the Jabber/XMPP option.\nhttps://guardianproject.info/builds/Gibberbot/\n.

I have moved this ticket over to our new system:\nhttps://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/857\n. Thank you for the report. Can you please tell us which version of the app you are using, on which device?\n\nThere were cases we could reproduce with our v10 release, but that has been fixed.\nWe definitely explicit focused on testing this scenario for the latest v11 release. If it is still occuring, it would obviously be very unfortunate.\n. As an aside, the \"use Tor\" feature is just one aspect of Gibberbot's security. Support for OTR, no local logging, protection of OTR messages by only storing in memory, TLS/SSL verification, etc are all aspects to the security \"marketed\" for GIbberbot.\nWe don't claim \"total anonymity\", and in fact, the support of Tor is more focused on circumventing firewalls that block access to specific services, than to total, strong anonymity. \nStill you are correct, that for someone who is aiming to keep their true identity safe, meaning not have their actual IP address logged by the XMPP server they are connecting to, this bug was a bad one. It did mean that the actual IP of their device (be it a mobile 3G ip or a Wifi IP) was visible to the XMPP service.\nIdeally though, if you do want total anonymity, you would be using a service like Dukgo or Jabber.ccc.de that has privacy by deployment configuration, as well.\nAnyhow, we obviously want to make sure this bug is solved, so again, if you can provide a bit more detail that would be much appreciated.\n. If you want direct APK access to the latest v11 release candidate, you can find it here:\nhttps://guardianproject.info/releases/Gibberbot-0.0.11-rc3-netbugfix.apk\n. We've moved on to our v12 alpha release now, so just want to make sure you have access to it for testing and verifying our fix for your issue:\nhttps://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/2fa3b9252319e47367f1f125bb3adcd1\n. this is resolved in our v12-alpha branch.\nYou can start testing builds here:\nhttps://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/2fa3b9252319e47367f1f125bb3adcd1\n. Can/Should we close this pull request now that we have the other one integrated?\n. You can run or co-host multiple Android applications in one process:\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/android-platform/Crtk2rIh0gI\n. in the new v12-alpha, you can now tap on the avatar icon and bring up a \"view profile\" option, which displays more about that user:\nv12-alpha is here:\nhttps://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/2fa3b9252319e47367f1f125bb3adcd1\n. Don't turn off Transport Encryption. That is required for pretty much all and any servers.\nGibberbot fully supports CACerts, and even if the cert is not recognized a popup dialog will allow you to manually override.\nAre you trying to use Tor or anything like that? Can you give me more info or screenshots on how you are configuring these services? We test against jabber.ccc.de as one of our main test accounts, so I am surprised it did not work there.\n. Also, just so you know, our official bug tracker is here: https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gibberbot\n. Hmm... the CCC server has a .onion address - it does not need .DE. To make it work, you will need to have Orbot installed and running.\nOtherwise, will look into why Gibberbot might be missing the SRV lookup for hosted.im.\nGlad you got it working.\n. we now have MUC support in our v12 alpha branch BUT there is no support for multi-user OTR encryption, because it doesn't exist yet!\nHowever, you can have a TLS-encrypted MUC chat, at the least.\nwe will have a public beta out soon with the basic MUC support in it.\n. the next release supports this using the OtrFileConverter app (\"KeySync\") and a import feature in the new app. Stay tuned for an update!\n. this is in our v12 alpha builds, and soon our public beta\n. is now implemented in our v12 alpha branch... stay tuned for a public beta!\n. I'm merging it, because it is excellent.\n. please pull the latest code, follow the build/readme's and try again\n. we've fixed this in our v12-alpha branch\n. this is in our v12 alpha builds, and soon our public beta\n. Reviewing and testing these fixes over the weekend.\n. SRV Lookup definitely works, and has been verified in v12 release (now in testing/beta)\nhttps://guardianproject.info/builds/Gibberbot/\n. The next v12 release color codes each message based on PLAINTEXT, ENCRYPTED or ENCRYPTED+VERIFIED state\n. GTalk and Hangouts use push messaging because they keep an active login to your account on their server. Since we are client only, we have to keep a connection open to your XMPP service.\nHowever, heartbeat should work for sure. We will make sure to inspect that code before the next release.\n. We are definitely thinking about how to stop the server from sending roster data you aren't interested in. I think the new v14.1 beta release has some improvements on this front. We should also probably allow you to turn off avatar loading entirely.\n@unhammer how many people are on your contact/buddy/roster list (roughly)?\n. fixed in v12 (out soon)\n. Time to merge this over-extended feature branch. WHY do I always do that :(\n. fixed in recent releases of both apps\n. We've attempted to address this issue with the v12 release that is no out in Google Play and on our site. Please test and close if resolved.\n. We have a new v12 release (now called \"ChatSecure\"), with a major overhaul of both the interface and improvements in the networking.\nCan you test it out, and let us know how it compares?\nhttps://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/2fa3b9252319e47367f1f125bb3adcd1\n. My sincere apologies. I should have warned you AND the app needs to do a better job warning users. \nYou can try downgrading to: https://guardianproject.info/releases/Gibberbot-0.0.11-RC5.apk if you need to get them back. If you have root on your device, you can find the old key file \"otr_keystore\" under /data/data/info.guardianproject/otr.app.im \nSince the recent Android kernel bug in random number generators was revealed (same as the \"bitcoin wallet\" bug), it means that any previously generated key was created from a weaker random seed than ideal. This new release implements a fix for that, and thus requires all new keys to be generated. \nThe \"Import OTR Keystore\" option is to import from a desktop app like Pidgin, Adium or Jitsi. This will import your private keys and any verified public key fingerprints as well. We haven't fully released the tool yet, but you can find the repo here: https://github.com/guardianproject/otrfileconverter\n. > Also, for the \"password timeout\" setting, \"time\" is not a dimensionless quantity. Seconds or milliseconds or what?\nOkay, will address that. For now, if you \"sign out all\" on the account list screen, it will clear/lock the password.\n\nAnd no dark UI?\n\nYes, getting that reimplemented. With the UI update, we had to step back a bit on our design options to build back up.\n. I will look into the old keyfile. It should still be there HOWEVER if you are serious about your security, then you should generate new keys anyhow. I still apologize for the app not warning you, but it is in your best interest to have new keys.\nAs for the connection still being flakey, can you tell me more about your connection? We cannot reproduce any of the issues you are reporting in the new build. \nWhen you upgraded, the old service could have still been running, which may have caused the flakey behavior to remain. A reboot might have been needed to ensure the new service code was running.\nXimin Luo notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nDowngrading didn't get me my keys back either.

Please excuse my brevity.\n. Point noted. Working on tuning these. Mostly they are related to the new storage encryption, but still, yes they should be optional.\n. also fyi - the official bug tracker/project is over here: https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gibberbot\n. Excellent news. Will implement right away.\n@jam-dev no worries on posting issues here. We are using both still, but hope to fully move over to the official tracker soon.\n. currently it lives in the UI process. however, the thing is, since we hold an open/authenticated instance of our SQLCipher database anyhow, it doesn't really matter if the CacheWord process is killed. We aren't constantly using it reauth anything.\nThe only scenario where we get into trouble is if the SQLcipher instance goes away, and the CacheWord instance also is gone, then we need to prompt the user to reauth.\nFor v12, i am going to leave it where it is, and turn off notifications. For v13, i'd like to move it into remote.\n. As of the latest cacheword, we have now disabled the cacheword persistent notification, as its not necessary for how we are using it. This means we are down to just ONE persistent notification for ChatSecure. That is how it will have to be for now.\n. Is this to Google/Gtalk or to another XMPP service?\nAre you using Tor or not?\n. thanks! working on this today.\n. Great - yes this is meant to just solve having unified session and contact management across JID's with same user@domain but different resources. That seems the sensible approach.\n. Does this overlap or build upon with my pull request #258 ?\nhttps://github.com/guardianproject/Gibberbot/pull/258\n. Wow, this is epic and exciting!\n.

Gotta keep better track of our cursors.\n. ooo, i like the back button to contact list! nice work.\n. Agree but it is a little more complicated with this app since we do have long running background services that must remain open to receive messages. We can't do push since typical xmpp doesn't know what that is.\n\nSo we do need a way, as the article states, to have the user say \"stop everything now\".

This is looking good... getting some random crashes when i open the app at different times, after different delays. sending those reports to hockeyapp (will add you in).\n. I guess the fix is really in the delayed call, and not the forcing of it. Before, since the connections were still logging out, the call \"IfInActive\" would always detect something still \"active\" and not logout.\n. Yes, I think having the SIgnOutAll/Exit process be a bit smarter and actually wait for all the connections to become inactive/logged_out makes most sense. However, for now, this solution (short delay + force) does the trick for users who are very focused on having a way to stop the background service... since our service can consume 50MB+ very often, I wnat to make sure there is something that mostly works in place.\n. built and testing now!\n.

If you do a clean install, this resolves the issue.\n\nMORE importantly, by doing a clean install (or a \"Clear Data\" in Android settings), you can benefit from the new fully encrypted local database format and app lock password.\n. Are you by chance connecting via Orbot/Tor?

Thanks for the feedback.\n. oh, i see. so we are causing the crash basically... so SELinux won't kill our app because we are attempting the write?\n. I think the reason I have to instantiate CursorLoader directly is due to 2.3/Gingerbread backwards compat. I will look into it more though.\n. First, you are saying, that your previous use (just texting/chatting) is still working without issue, right? You are not reporting a regression.\n\nSending files and pictures is a new feature that was not available before. To use it, both of you need to be on ChatSecure v12, and you need to start an OTR session.\nFile sharing is BETA feature for sure, and one issue we have seen is problems with certain servers. Which XMPP server are you using? We have successfully tested with Dukgo and Google/GTalk, but no there is problems with Jabber.ccc.de\n. > If so then yes...this is what is NOT working. There are two ways to send a pic/file. The first is by selecting the icon >next to the smiley emoticon\nWhen you press that, you see the paperclip and the photo icon, right? When you press the photo icon, what happens? Does the Gallery open and you see photos you can choose?\n. Make sure you are choosing a photo from the \"Camera\" section, and not a Google+ photo or something remotely stored.\nAlso, try using the paperclip icon (may need a File Browser app instaleld first), and then find a photo or file to share by browsing the /sdcard path.\n. No, we have tested successfully over Orbot, so no. All of the data transfers occurs inside of the OTR chat stream inside of XMPP.\nCould you try creating new Dukgo accounts (using the \"New Account\" feature on the Account screen), and try it there? You would need to create the account, sign in, add contacts (left hand drawter), etc.\n. it is a very beta feature, so it is not your fault. \n. what is your dukgo username? maybe we can test\n. this is fairly experimental, but I want to get it into the next beta release for testing. we also need it in to meet a milestone for our funding from Tor. ;)\n. merging for beta/project milestone... will bug fix in another request.\n.

As for int'l and other incomplete features, yes that needs to be greatly improved.\n\ndon't know about the concepts of the XMPP protocol - so it might be even useful to auto-create >secure passwords (for auto-created new XMPP accounts) and provide an as simple setup as the >wide-used messengers today.\n\nYes, I think just auto creating an account for someone who wants a \"new\" account, who doesn't care what the password is, and not forcing them to make choices is a good idea.

Got it. We made a conscious choice to remove group support in the UI, since the vast majority of our users had only one group \"buddies\", etc, the default one. This was the same decision we made around having the status UI, since again, most users never changed it from online, or even set a custom status.\n\nI think if Xabber works for you great. We aren't aiming to have a UI / experience anymore that mimics Pidgin or a stock XMPP client. In fact, in the coming months, we will likely move away from it even more, so if you are looking for groups, buddy lists, support for ICQ transports, etc, we are likely not the place to look.\nAlso, just remember, in terms of development cycles, we have to put a lot more into things like encrypted database, Tor support, etc, that does take away from our ability to focus on UI aspects like this.\nI do appreciate the feedback, but don't want to promise something we may not get back to supporting.\n. tested, and it works great. merged through my bug fix branch, so closing this PR.\n.

It is true that BOSH is becoming more useful, especially in an age where XMPP is seen as a non-standard protocol that can be often filtered since it is not on port 80 or 443. We are strongly considering it, though it would be as part of our work on next-generation version of ChatSecure called Zom... see https://github.com/zom and https://zom.im\nI think the issue has been with the Smack XMPP library, in that historically BOSH support was not available on Android. I think that has changed, so we will take a look.\n. We do some sort of automatic retry if there isn't a valid OTR session in place. We also show delivery confirmations for messages. I will check and make sure that we only show a delivery confirmatino if the message was successfully decrypted.\n.

Due to Snowden's revelations we want to use OTR in any case, to secure our communication. However, OTR is only possible when both endpoints are online at the same time, which is a big issue for us (often, one of us is temporarily offline). In practice, we switched back to SMS, because XMPP+OTR often don't work.\n\nYes, this is an issue, though some XMPP services do support queuing of\noffline messages on the server.\nhttp://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0160.html\nfor instance, specifies this. I also believe Google's XMPP server does\nsome offline storage.\nThis still requires that an existing OTR session is still active.\n\nProposed Solution\nTo circumvent the problem, I propose the following behavior: the sending ChatSecure instance could store the message locally until the receiver becomes online. Then, the message could be sent using OTR. That would mean that messages are sent as soon as both parties are online at the same time. A really asynchronous would not be possible, though, because there is no central party storing the message on behalf of the sender, but it might still improve the user experience.\nDiscussion\nWhat do you think?\n\nThis is a great idea and something we are working towards. We do have\n\"delivery receipts\" already implemented, so we can tell if there any\nundelivered messages that exist for a user. When we see that user's\npresence return to online, or receive any other XMPP message from them,\nwe should do our best to resend the queued messages.\nThanks for the feedback!\n.

There were two fixes. First in getChatSessionAdapter(), a session ID string key was being incorrectly created (without the middle \"XMPP\" part) so that it never matched, resulting in multiple instances. \n\nSecond the check for changes in the resources for the session ID (the \"/\" compare code) was also causing problems with new sessions being constantly created, never allowing OTR to be init'd in some cases. I disable that for now, in lieu of having more reliable OTR code.\nI think the solution is to create the session ID string/key with the remote resource in tact, instead of not, and would be happy to re-nable multiple remote OTR sessions if we can make that code work reliably.\n.

This is happening for others, as well, and we will have a fix in the next update this week.\n. One question - do you or any of these contacts use any other OTR chat programs like Pidgin or Adium?\n. We've push an update to Google Play, or you can grab the latest release here: https://guardianproject.info/releases/ChatSecure-v14.0.3.apk\n. Pushing another update today. I think the problem relates to using the wrong JID. If we are foo@bar.com/blah but the server actually sets us to foo@bar.com/blah123 we were not getting that info and setting the setFrom() in the XMPP Message properly. This made OTR sessions not connect.\n. We've pushed changes that affect this bug, and have released 14.0.4 official as well:\nhttps://guardianproject.info/releases/ChatSecure-v14.0.4.apk\n. The keystore file corruption is not related to the DB closing. The fact that you can establish an OTR session at means your keystore is intact. The OTR issues you are experiencing are more likely addressed by fixes in the SessionID instance management I have fixed in another pull request and will likely merge.\n. Glad you can repro, hc.  I think a few issues are being conflated here though. \nv13 and existing v14 code definitely has issue with OTR and XMPP resources that could be causing this. If you are testing, knoy, please just test between the latest builds on both ends, and not an old build on one end.\n2nd, the issue of delivery receipts showing, even if OTR fails, is that we are showing the delivery receipt which means we did receive the message, but decryption fails, so the user does not see it. Perhaps we should only send the receipt for OTR sessions if decryption succeeds? That would be tricky because delivery receipts right now are a the XMPP layer. I think what you want is a \"read receipt\" in fact.\nOtherwise, hc, we always call \"decryptMessage\" in all cases, because that is how we detect whitespace characters to trigger OTR session to start in \"as requested\" mode. If it is not an OTR message, the engine will just pass the plain text along.\n. I do think, hc, that what you reproduced relates to the issue I have seen of this problem mostly happening on first-time use/setup. Once it stops happening, then it is fine from there on out. So it may be related to OTR key generation?\n. While you say \"works flawlessly on v13\" others did not say that, so you see it is a matter of perspective. Absolute statements about what does or does not work are not helpful. \nOTR instance tags are not implemented, as we are not using OTR v3. \nXMPP resources could be a cause of this, specifically how the OTR Session object instances are tied to a SessionID instance, and how new sessions are instantiated when the resource changes.\n. As a side note, since 14.0.8.1 I have not had any problems init'ing OTR sessions with any of the non-technical users I communicate with using ChatSecure on a daily basis. \n. oops, sorry brainfart from Orbot versioning. Too many v14s..\n. Well, devrandom, you are really missing out then. :)\nI agree more code reviews and more eyeballs on all of this are great. eighthave is here to help, and hope we can get you and Lior back on board more. It is never good just to have one person working on so much code, but that was the reality we were in do to time, resources, and more. I hope we can get v14 to the point where you can appreciate all the positive improvements in stability and usability. The fact that my brilliant but non-technical wife is a full time, always encrypted ChatSecure now is the only evidence I need that progress has been made.\n. Regarding that last bit, there may be a server issue here, because most of the people I am communicating with that are non-technical, who are not having any problems are on GMail accounts. This adds some evidence to the fact the issue is related to XMPP resources/addressing and not OTR itself.\n. @knoy can you remind me what kind of server you are using? ejabberd, prosody? Which version?\n. Just to make sure this is clear: when you upgrade you are killing all OTR active sessions in memory, since they are stored in only in flash/transient memory \"RAM\" and not storage memory (sdcard/\"disk\"). If the other end you are chatting with has an open session, that will now be stale, and they should stop and restart. That said, I upgrade my debug build all the time directly from my dev IDE, and cannot reproduce this issue. I have tried, trust me, I have!\n. When you upgrade an APK on Android, the app is killed without any warning. There is no onDestory() called afaik. This means we can't properly end the session, XMPP or OTR. It is more like a crash.\n. Yes I think that is a good idea. Would also stop the problem where we have a remote contact with an orphaned OTR session, and they send a FINISHED message that we cannot decrypt, and then the local client sends a message back saying they couldn't decrypt, etc... the more we can avoid those states, the better.\n. It will be fixed when it is fixed. You are testing nightlies, not releases. We never asked you to test those, and make no guarantees about what is in them. \nIt seems like you are happy with the v13 code, so perhaps you should just fork it, and take it to another development team to do what you like. That is the beauty of open-source. \nOtherwise, I will continue to stand by our v14 work, and I will ship and update when its ready.\n. The phrase \"it will be fixed when it is fixed\" is not meant to be disrespectful. It is just reality. We can't magically wish complicated bugs like this to be solved. You might have also heard the phrase \"it will ship when it is ready\". You saying \"come on guys!\" won't change that - it isn't like we aren't burning candles at both ends, and haven't been open to people contributing for the many years we've been working on this app.\nAs for money, I received no money from you, and so have nothing to keep. I personally elected to not take it due to knowing it will raise your expectations and demand for a fix on a certain timetable, which I as project lead, didn't want to get involved in, knowing all of our commitments righ tnow.\nStill, I am sorry to lose you and your community as users, but for whatever reason, the devices you are using, the network you are on, the server or some combination of them, proved to not be a fit. For every person on this thread with an OTR problem, I can count many more users, including very very novice users, who happily report to me that they use ChatSecure every day and it works for them. Also, there are many many optinos out there - you should definitely check out Xabber, Conversations, Jitsi Android, not to mention Surespot, Telegram and TextSecure, as one of these apps is sure to fit your needs. \n. Also, for those who still care, tagged and built v14.0.6 beta 1:\nhttps://guardianproject.info/releases/ChatSecure-v14.0.6-BETA-1.apk\nsig: https://guardianproject.info/releases/ChatSecure-v14.0.6-BETA-1.apk.asc\nOne thing that I noticed while testing on my Nexus 7-CM11 tablet is that the wifi connection was really less reliable than normal, even though my router was just down the hall. This caused sporadic delays in receiving messages, which includes delays in init'ing OTR sessions. Once I moved my Nexus 7 next to the router, everything was fine. So please, in any further bug reports on this issue, or other message delivery issues, please indicate network type (2g, 3g, 4g, wifi) and firmware flavor.\n. I still need to update our FDroid repo, but we do have a new release out for testing, if you can grab the APK: https://guardianproject.info/releases/ChatSecure-v14.0.7-BETA-2.apk\n. @eighthave that is related to you being offline/disconnected... they do need to be queued properly... the date is being nulled out when the send fails i believe. we should queue instead.\n. just run \"ant debug\" to generate the jar. Or set the key.store variable if you want to generate a signed jar.\n. Maybe we should just check the cacheword jar into the project.... \n. Not sure what needs android-7 but you can easily install it... its just an older SDK.\n. You mean ChatSecure right? Why Orbot?\nOh, I see... if you use Orbot/Tor with your XMPP account, then the the Group Chat will also go through Tor. This is already implemented.\n. Interesting possibility. Will investigate.\n. Do you often switch between 3g/4g and wifi? This is the major source of connectivity issues we have seen.\n. BTW, do you have the \"Use foreground priority\" option enabled?\n. Perfect detail. This is one of our top two issues right now.\n. Pushed a test build here (tho signed with release keys so you can upgrade over your current build):\nhttps://guardianproject.info/releases/ChatSecure-v14.0.4-DEBUG-TEST.apk\nThis has a few changes related to the thread management you mentioned, as well as some other issues on the OTR front.\n. There is a Debug option in the ChatSecure settings. If you enable this and run a LogCat program, you should see more output.\nWill rebuild the dev release and see what happens. Must have been a build problem, as it runs on multiple devices here.\n. If/when you are up for it: https://guardianproject.info/releases/ChatSecure-v14.0.4-DEBUG-TEST-B.apk\n. Okay. Well, strange issues persist on the front. We've checked here on multiple devices, with pidgin, ChatSecure iOS, and other apps, and it works fine. We'll keep at it, and let us know if anything changes for you. Try a stop/start on both sides, device reboot, etc if you can. \n. Fantastic. Have a good night!\n. Sometimes TCP just gives up and fails. It is the downside of using XMPP instead of an async push messaging type protocol. We can do a better job of notifying you when a network is signed out unintentionally though.\n. 14.0.4 official is out now: https://guardianproject.info/releases/ChatSecure-v14.0.4.apk\n. Perhaps we should just hide the avatar on smaller screens?\n. FYI we will be working on this for the next point release update (14.0.5).\n14.0.4 is coming out today, but we didn't have time to focus on UI issues for Gingerbread devices. Thanks for your patience.\n. Yes, we took that out temporarily but are working to get it back in.\n. I will work on prioritizing it. We've gotten v14 mostly stable and worked through the network and OTR bugs. I can try to get it in for next weeks release. Apologies and thanks for the patience.\n. Hmm... actually there might be. Let me look into that.\nIn the meantime, you can install v13, run keysync, then upgrade to the latest v14 build, as an option.\n. Thanks. We are actively working on this now. Somehow sessions we being created without the jabber resource, leading to the keying issues you noticed. In addition, we've made sure to tag unencrypted messages with an appropriate label/indicator. \n. If we could interleave multiple encrypted sessions into one conversation view (by maintaining unique OTR states for each remote jabberid), is that something you think we should do? \n. This is the pretty much all messaging apps on the market work. You have a list of your active conversations as the primary screen. Look at WhatsApp, Hangouts, Telegram, TextSecure, etc. You click on the \"new chat\" icon in the top actionbar, to start a new chat/conversation with a contact. That is when your buddy list shows up. \nI know that we used to show all contacts in the main screen, but not only was that confusing for the majority of our users, or users trying out ChatSecure from these other apps, but it was also very processor intensive, and caused a great drain on the battery, due to the fact that we had so many contacts to update for people with many contacts. \n. The color indicators of the avatars are now for status only. The encryption state is indicated by the lock icon, either with the question mark or check.\n. Well, that can mean that the return message with the receipt was lost along the way. It can happen with spotty coverage. We don't have delivery receipts for delivery receipts, after all!\n. fixed\n. fixed!\n. This is using a private hosted XMPP server or with a public one?\n. I feel like we've done this before and rolled back. Thanks for the pull request though, as you are right, it should be possible. We may want to have a (very hidden) user preference to allow override in some cases.\n. Yes this is being worked on. We have added the OTRDATA features to our branch of otr4j, so these need to be incorporated to allow for data transfer.\n. Yes... we noticed 95% of people never changed their status, so we decided to remove it. However, we all like to change our status, and are trying to figure out how/where to put it back in without overloading the UI. THanks for the feedback.\n. The Foreground feature is needed on some devices and not on others. If you have a lot of RAM, and aren't overloading your device, then likely you don't need it. Using it ensures background services (and XMPP connections) aren't killed by the OS, so not sure why are you are seeing the behavior you are. \nThat said, this commit 0ccdbf2b8fd0e17915909ac78d4a439d237456d6 has a number of fixes for reconnection management that are working well on my lowly Moto E phone, my spotty T-Mobile coverage, and my temperamental wifi. There was a specific bug in the \"needs reconnect\" code, and we've fixed some crashes to.\nNot sure when our next build will be, but will keep you posted.\n. Yes, this is an easy one.\n. strange... not sure why the text is still marked red, but the checkmark is the delivery receipt indicator. \n. This should be fixed and will be part of our next update.\n. There is definitely unicode support. We may just not be using a font with your specific character set supported. We are using the Roboto font and not the default system font. Perhaps we can add a font selection option for cases like this.\n. Will test and review shortly!\n. Great @chrisballinger that is what we are doing now as well.\n. @devrandom I know what I saw in my debugger. The mOtrSms keys included what seemed the same string value as the object that was checking against it, and yet the .get() returned null. This caused the response to SMP requests to not work. Once I updated the code included in this PR, that behavior stopped, and SMP responses worked again. I changed nothing else.\nI agree with you on the surface it shouldn't be that way, but somehow, somewhere in a runtime, on a device, it was.\n. At this point, I am going to merge this PR, then cherry-pick @eighthave new code for this.\n. @devrandom All that I was trying to do with my change was to more explicitly ensure we were showing what string value was being used as the key for the map, as opposed to leaving it up to toString(). \nI think having more active devs on the project, even if it just small code here and there, will help with code quality. As we can tie patches/PRs to specific bugs and tickets, and keep each set small enough for code review, we should.\nI know it might look at times like my contributions are \"adhoc patches\" I can assure you they are backed by hours and hours and hours of debugging, testing, and consideration, backed by constant hands on use, working with users, getting feedback from support@ and more.\n. I've fixed the contact/picker list to sort by status (online, away, offline, etc) and alpha within that. You can also filter it using the search action bar option.\nThe open conversation list is meant to be sorted by most recent message first, but seems like that may not be working. Will look into it.\n. Have you reviewed/updated the localised/translated strings here: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/chatsecureandroid/language/sr/ ?\n. yes\n. I didn't mean to update the manifest, will fix that.\nOtherwise, when you first load the Contact instances, it is from the Roster directly, which has a blank resource. \nIf we haven't received a presence value from the server, then yes you will still get a blank resource.\n. When they are not received do you always get the X indicator? \n. Which repo do you mean?\n. Is it an error, or are you prompted to manually confirm it?\n. Can you post a screenshot or type the exact message you are getting? (there are a few different errors that can trigger that).\nOtherwise, it is likely that somehow we aren't trusting your CA by default. Have you properly configured any intermediate chain CA files that GlobalSign needs with your XMPP server?\nhttps://support.globalsign.com/customer/portal/articles/1223298-alphassl-intermediate-certificates\n. Can you double check your ejabberd config? http://theadamsresidence.net/2012/04/01/ejabberd-and-ssl-certs/\n. Sure, we can do that. Not sure of the timetable, but will put it on our list.\n. Have you followed the build instructions? Have you run git submodule update --init --recursive etc?\n. https://github.com/guardianproject/ChatSecureAndroid/blob/master/README.md\n. thanks... reviewing now\n. they must support OTRDATA, and kopete does not (yet!)\n. yes, it would! we are working on this for a future release. you can share a location from Google Maps into ChatSecure currently.\n. Yes. We have an open pull request now on this.\n. i believe this was fixed, and if not we are double checking for 14.2\n. fixed in 14.1.1\n. Thanks for putting up with my desire for \"decoration\"\n. That's why we're doing incremental releases twice a month now, slowly but surely tracking all these things down.\n. Yes, I assumed too much and detailed too little. I will attempt to describe more here, because my gitfu is not good enough to revise my commit messages.\n1) asking for a new presence from the roster can take time, so I created a way for a process like loading contacts or creating a new session, to request a refresh in the async handlePresenceChanged() code. This is done by creating an empty Presence instance with the JID, and setting the type to ERROR, and then adding that to the qPresence queue for processing. The end result is we get presence data more often without creating bottlenecks.\n2) There was logic that cleared out the presence table in the ImpsProvider when an account logged out. This table is initially seeded on first instant of ContactListManagerAdapter , but isn't re-seeded on subsequent logins. Thus, the db.update() calls to update presence failed after the first login. My solution was to stop the clearing of the presence table on logout/disconnect. It doesn't seem logical to do that anyhow. This fixes the \"presence does not update\" or \"contact is offline even though I know they are not\" bug, referenced in this (and other) tickets: https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/4255\n3) The commit 0b2926e0ba2d0eda70a38dff6d2be74adab42e04 which aimed to \"simplify\" presence updating, basically removed logic in the ImpsProvider that should otherwise exist in XMPPConnection itself. ImpsProvider should just persist the state it is given, and not try to sort out whether the priority is higher or the resource matches, etc. \n. Thanks for the update. Definitely gets tricky when there is not a clean logout.\n. Thanks... we are tuning the theming/background support in the next few updates!\n. fixed in 14.1.1\n. this was fixed in v14.1.1 by moving back to the conversation list when you close the chat\n. Do you still have this problem with the latest v14.1.1 release?\n. All looks good and working well!\n. Fantastic progress.\nI wonder if there was a need for the protocol portion of the path to exist... like would we ever have OFFER http:// or OFFER otr-out-of-band:/ ?\nI think that we can say if there is only a path and no protocol specified, then we can default to otr-in-band: as the protocol on the android side.\n. @eighthave this is what we are talking about!\n. LOL!\n. Wifi Mesh = Bonjour\n. Do you set a connect server value?\n. Okay, will look into it.\n. what's wrong later with the latest cacheword?\n. Ah I read your other ticket now. Understood.\n. Yeah, it did still work and build, so I guess I was not using the latest.\n. We've add image compression before transfer, which helps a great deal now. This will be provided in the next release. You can still send the full image by choosing the file/paperclip icon and sending it as a \"file\"/\n. Well, my changes still make sense, but aren't necessary, true. Ultimately, if a message has a mime-type for media, there will be nothing to linkify.\n. It might be helpful, but for now we are still committed to supporting Android SDK 9 and up.\n. We don't use the cacheword notification so it was not an issue. Still, I\nreinstated the submodule commit to the right place.\nOn Tue, Feb 24, 2015, at 04:34 PM, Hans-Christoph Steiner wrote:\n\nthere were some API changes in cacheword, including removing the\nnotification handling.

We currently handle all data transfer using our own OTRDATA protocol: https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gibberbot/wiki/OTRDATA_Specifications\n. Thanks! We've fixed this and will push out RC4 shortly.\n. okay all done with this. let's merge, build and release RC4!\n. Yes, will do. Our regular expression got overzealous. Apologies.\n. We should use nodeprep. That said, I hope our RC5 release solved your problem.\n. Is this still happening? Is there anything unique about your contact list? size? strange avatars? names in other character sets?\n. There were some crashes we saw with an empty name for a contact. We'll have a new build soon to test.\n. I don't think there are any security issues here, just bugs that we have hopefully solved.\nWhich version of ChatSecure are you using?\n. What about XMPP doesn't support your needs? What is it about axolotl that you think it magically solves?\n. With ChatSecure, we have long lived OTR sessions, and in fact, often renegotiate/ratchet sessions in the background when you are using the app. This means, unless you have a wildly different online/offline pattern than the people you communicate with, it is pretty rare you won't have an existing OTR session open with someone. Also, if the person is offline, you can send an encrypted message, and when they come online, the OTR session will be automatically renegotiated and the message resent without you needing to do anything. In summary, our implementation of XMPP+OTR works quite well in mobile contexts, while still maintaining compatibility with the many XMPP and OTR enabled clients and servers out there.\nAs far as I know, Axolotl doesn't support group messaging inherently (https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/wiki/ProtocolV2), but it is achieved in TextSecure/Signal by using parallel sessions with each person in a group chat. Again, this is something we can do with XMPP+OTR and are planning to in our next release.\nAll in all, Axolotl is a good thing, but you shouldn't confuse that protocol with what the app/service is doing in its implementation.\n. Are you on a CDMA network like Sprint or Verizon?\n. Also, after you make your call, can you check if the account is connected or not? Open the left sidebar account screen to see. Thanks!\n. CDMA networks have a bad problem of not allowing the data channel (aka the Internet/3G/4G) to work when you make a phone call: https://community.sprint.com/baw/message/862882\nSo in effect, once you stop your call, it takes a second for ChatSecure to reconnect. I admit we haven't tested on your device configuration at this point, and we should probably figure out why the seamless reconnect/relogin is not happening.\nIt likely wouldn't happen if you were on wifi while making the phone call.\n. With group chat, the most foolproof method is to A) setup a dukgo.com account and b) enter conference.dukgo.com as the group chat server. Obviously, if you are running your own server, then it should work there, but we haven't tested on a wide variety of server types yet. What kind of server are you using? Do you join group chat/MUCs with another client like pidgin?\n. Oh I see... the \"Secret Identity\" setting is tied to the CalyxInstitute.org Jabber server, so issue with group chat might be tied to that box. We will do some testing and see if it can work. However, if you want to create a group chat room on dukgo.com or some other box, you usually need an account on that box. So that means, in this case you would need to use the \"Create New Account\" option, to generate a new account on dukgo.com.\n. For some reason, FDroid.org is out of date. You should install directly from our FDroid repos: https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/ for the latest v14 releases.\n. We do have a system called KeySync that allows this: https://guardianproject.info/apps/keysync/\nthough we are currently fixing some bugs in the desktop apps.\n. If you just want to sync you keys between ChatSecure on different phones, we can do that quite easily. Since Pidgin is a desktop app that we don't implement, our solution was to build KeySync, which, while still rough, makes it possible to convert keystore formats between many different desktop chat apps and put them into ChatSecure format. \nOverall, yes, it needs to be asy for mainstream users, but I think most mainstream users will likely just a messaging app on their primary smartphone, and not have multiple devices, etc.\n. The XMPP protocol doesn't automatically copy all messages to all devices. If you are chatting from the Hangoust/Google web interface, those messages are not cc'd over to the mobile app. The method used by Hangouts itself to do this is proprietary.\nThere is a \"Carbon Copy\" extension to XMPP we may support at some point, but for now, we do not.\n. Yup! We'd be happy to incorporate your code. Just send a pull request.\n. I can't reproduce this problem. Can you tell me more about your device, os version, etc? What server are you on?\n. You should try the latest ChatSecure here: https://guardianproject.info/releases/ChatSecure-v14.1.1-RC-5.apk or through our FDroid repo here: https://guardianproject.info/fdroid/repo/\nFor some reason, the ChatSecure build on F-Droid.org is very out of date. You will have to uninstall that version first.\n. Which version of the app are you running?\nOn Sat, Apr 11, 2015, at 02:08 AM, Mike wrote:\n\nKeys are never exchanged, I just see the loading bar at the top after\npressing start encryption.\nIt works fine from pidgin though (both clients pidgin I mean)\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/guardianproject/ChatSecureAndroid/issues/670\n\n\nNathan of Guardian\n  nathan@guardianproject.info\n. Any progress with this? Did you ever get OTR to init?\n. It does seem to support user messages.... all the Slack team members come up in your roster.\n. I experienced the same issue here. Working on resolving this tomorrow!\n. Let's say August 15th! We have it already done, but are doing a major refactor as well to put code into external libraries, projects, etc so it is a big shift. We'll be pushing it up here in the next few weeks.\n. When you say UI and logic what do you mean exactly? There is already a pretty big separation into the UI activities, ImConnection communication plugins (XMPP, LLXMPP) and the persistence pieces (ImProvider)\n. Sure. We are redo-ing the UI quite a bit as well for v15 as part of our overall refactoring.\nWhat kind of changes are you looking to make?\n. If you want the existing v14.x codebase in Android Studio / Gradle, you will have to do that yourself. It isn't that hard honestly, with the latest versions of Android Studio's import capability.\nWhat we are working on now is a pretty big reorganization and update of the app, moving the current submodules to standalone maven/gradle dependencies (https://github.com/guardianproject/gpmaven), and implementing a pretty big user interface update. This is going to take a few more weeks to get to a public beta ready state. The app is also changing quite a bit, in good ways, so it may not fit your current expectations and requirements.\nYou might want to check out the Conversations project, which is another great XMPP app with OTR and Tor support, as well, and it also already has gradle support: https://github.com/siacs/Conversations\n. If you do want to check out the new v15 project, it is under the codename \"AwesomeApp\" but also currently called \"Zom\". Be warned, it is very different on the surface, though the same secure core underneath.\nhttps://github.com/n8fr8/awesomeapp/tree/awesomeapp\n. Thanks for the thought, but we are working on our own update and conversion at the moment!\n. Did you change the code in anyway? Not sure what the problem is, but it seems to relate to just getting a thumbnail that may not exist.\n. Yes, we will expose the proxy settings value. Also, we are adding a way for apps to query Orbot to ask for the current port values.\n. Did you follow the instructions in the README.md file?\nYou have to get all the submodule projects using:\n git submodule update --init\nand then you need to import all of those projects into Eclipse.\n. Changes made based on feedback\n. networkStateChanged() is triggered via broadcasts events that can be triggered pretty quickly once the server is setup... meaning, you are getting network events even before you are logged in. We could look at improving that logic.\n. they are not, because there is no notification visible when foreground is not on, so it is all good.\n. Those are handled elswhere\n. Looks great!\n. Also is built upon a previous PR here, so review/merge that one first: https://github.com/guardianproject/ChatSecureAndroid/pull/680\n. Only ea91042 is a bit tricky, so we'll have to see how it works in broader testing. \n. This is the relevant change in our Smack build:\nhttps://github.com/guardianproject/smack/commit/9935fe65757dd7de8a0f537c7d6c44d08dae75a4\n. It does.. check the \"files changed\":\nBIN \uf053\uf053\uf053\uf053\uf053 libs/asmack-android-8.jar\n. We definitely won't remove the ability to manually set the language. Otherwise, we've found the problem and fixes this in our some our work on the major v15 change, and are backporting the fix for this now for a v14.x.x update this week. \n. Thanks for the testing, @459below. I will make sure to test on API 19 device and try to repro with the latest code. The fix was meant to make our code match other implementations of our in-app locale switching, where we haven't seen this problem. Otherwise, it seems more like a bug now in the preference rendering provided by Android, since we don't actually manually build the dialog boxes where the error is being displayed.\n. If you change the Chat Encryption setting to \"As Requested\" instead of \"Automatically Attempt\" it will stop injecting these blank lines. Also, that spacing should never show up for other people using ChatSecure, only for people who are not using an OTR capable client.\n. Sure. How would this mode be set or triggered, in your mind?\n. Ah, thanks, was going to ask about this, since I saw it failing on the server.\n. When you say re and re-sending, how many times are you seeing these messages? Is it only when one side drops off and reconnects? Is this with OTR on or off? Are both sides using ChatSecure or just one?\nWe didn't see this happen in any of our testing, but we did make adjustments to our code in the area of on/offline sending, so I can imagine there is some set of circumstances where it is happening.\n. Thanks for all the detail. It seems the re-send/offline/queue logic we added is overzealous and overcompensating.\n. Sorry this has taken so long to fix, but it has been fixed now in this pull request: https://github.com/guardianproject/ChatSecureAndroid/pull/706 \nWe'll finish testing and ship an update this week.\n. There is a release candidate build posted here: https://guardianproject.info/releases/ChatSecure-v14.2.1.apk\n. Oh I thought we did! Grrr. Will make that happen.\n. 14.2.1  was published to Google Play.\n. Yes keystore corruption is definitely a bug we have worked and are still making sure it doesn't happen. \nWhat version are you using? From Google Play or elsewhere?\n(thanks for posting to our tracker, but thought i would still reply here since you have a very important issue to address)\n. All of the message and media data in ChatSecure is encrypted using SQLCipher and IOCipher. If you set an app passphrase on setup, then that will protect the key that it is encrypted with. If you skip that step, then the key will be protected with a default passphrase. The OS doesn't have visibility to the data in a typical way, though with root permissions of course, you can do just about anything. \nThat said, the desire to easily export/import data is a valid one, and something we should better support.\n. Just as a general question, would you prioritize export per conversation, or a full app data export/import ? Is this a backup desire, or do you want to save specific conversations?\n. Yes, if your device is powned, there is little we can do. I think that is true of pretty much any security software, including Tor, GnuPG or pretty much anything. Replicant is great - any non-Google AOSP firmware is a good start.\nUltimately, we primarily focus on network threats, and low-level on device threats like non-root malware, or defending against unintentional cloud backup of plaintext, etc. \nIf you feel your threat model includes Google, Apple or a third-party malware targeting your to the extreme they are reading encrypted data or keys from memory, or intercepting key strokes, then you should definitely additional precautions, as documented and implemented here:\nhttps://blog.torproject.org/blog/mission-impossible-hardening-android-security-and-privacy\nhttps://github.com/mission-impossible-android/mission-impossible-android\n. Why do you need to push a sqlite database? You are trying to auto-install to many devices, so you want to configure some sort of default settings? You would also need to have root on the device to be able to do that.\nThere are sqlcipher command line tools available at https://sqlcipher.net I believe, so that you can work with SQLCipher databases on the desktop/server.\n. If you don't use the app lock password feature (the key is null/not set), then the password to the database is just an empty string.\nhttps://github.com/guardianproject/ChatSecureAndroid/blob/master/src/info/guardianproject/otr/app/im/app/WelcomeActivity.java#L566\nYou could run ChatSecure, skip the app password feature, setup one account in the app, then copy that database file to your deployment setup as the template. Then using SQLCipher command line tools, you can modify the values in the schema, to customize for each user.\nYou can find all the schema information here:\nhttps://github.com/guardianproject/ChatSecureAndroid/blob/master/src/info/guardianproject/otr/app/im/provider/ImpsProvider.java\nYou will want to change data in the accounts table:\nhttps://github.com/guardianproject/ChatSecureAndroid/blob/master/src/info/guardianproject/otr/app/im/provider/ImpsProvider.java#L322\n. No problem. Happy you are using our app in this way. Would love to hear more about your project/product/service if you want to or can share.\n. Yes, we are adding this and other features (like hiding from your recent apps, and changing the icon in the launcher) as part of a new set of physical security features in our v15 work. \n. You need to also change all of the URI for the various services.\nWe are moving to a Gradle-build system which should make this easier moving forward.\n. Yes, see github.com/zom and look at the ZomAndroid project. This is our\nnew project based on old chatsecure android code.\nAlso you might want to look at Conversations.im as an option.\nOn Wed, Mar 2, 2016, at 02:36 PM, AbdulSamadQureshi wrote:\n\n@n8fr , is that gradle -build system complete yet?\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/guardianproject/ChatSecureAndroid/issues/711#issuecomment-191390755\n. You can also use conference.rows.io which is an open conference server.\n\nYou can also try Conversations.im group chat feature, which works a bit better than ChatSecure's does currently.\n. This codebase is coming to the end of its life. There are two other projects to work on now.\nZom is based on this project but updated for Android Studio and Gradle: https://github.com/zom/Zom-Android\nConversations is another XMPP application with encryption support: https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/\n. For more information, please read here: https://chatsecure.org/blog/chatsecure-conversations-zom/\n. Can you connect to other XMPP services? Google, Dukgo?\nIt may be that Facebook has turned off their XMPP interface finally.\nhttps://developers.facebook.com/docs/chat\n. You might want to try the Conversations app instead. It is free on FDroid.org (or a small amount on Google Play), and we may be switching over to their codebase soon anyhow. \nhttps://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=conversations&fdid=eu.siacs.conversations\n. Change is hard, but ultimately we like what the Conversations guys are doing, and want to start supporting their efforts, instead of just duplicating. We'll keep ChatSecure v14.x codebase around for awhile, and do small bug fixes. If we can manage the Android 6.x fixes we'll try to.\n. We are still doing maintenance on ChatSecure v14.x branch, and will try to address this Android 6 issue shortly.\nSorry for the confusion, we're trying to sort things out. Conversations is definitely doing amazing work, and you should try their app out. The primary features they are missing is local encryption of data on the device and Orbot/Tor support, but we hope that will change as they move forward.\nAs for Facebook connections, make sure you have chat enabled on Facebook, and an app specific password generated for ChatSecure.\n. Pidgin doesn't support encrypted file transfer.\n. Not sure about Pidgin. I think there is a lot of flux right now around encrypted file transfers, since there are many ways to do it, and no one quite agrees yet.\nCS shouldn't show that it was transfered, so that is definitely a bug.\n. We use our OTRDATA system for all media sharing, which means all shared files are encrypted in the same session as your chat messages. We do essentially send them as Base64 chunks inside of OTR. They are fully encrypted end-to-end just like chat, and they do work on OTR forcing services just fine.\n. Can you confirm which version you are using? This was fixed in 14.2.1 \n. Is the server open registration? Or can we get a test account?\nAre you using the Tor option? Is there a SRV record?\nAlso are you on Marshmallow?\nOn Sat, Nov 14, 2015, at 10:49 AM, DouglasDigital wrote:\n\nHello\nI have an Ejabberd XMPP server running at a.ioneh.com.\nI installed a Startssl Cert for the server.\nI chose to REQUIRE TLS for all connections.\nI have tried three other clients, they all connect fine.

Unfortunately, Facebook has recently disabled access to their servers through the open XMPP protocol. We are hoping to move to their new API, but we are not yet sure if it is possible. :(\n. Yes they did here quite awhile ago: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/chat\nWe just didn't believe they would actually follow through, since their April 30th, 2015 deadline passed and it was still working.\n. Why did you close it?\n. None of them unfortunately. The only encrypted file transfer that exists is supported by ChatSecure and Conversations using currently incompatible standards. We are working both to converge on the same standard, and to push other XMPP apps to adopt something as well.\nWe have toyed with the idea of adding support for unencrypted file transfer in order to have compatibility with desktop apps, but that wouldn't really be living up to our name unfortunately.\n. https://github.com/ChatSecure/ChatSecure-iOS/issues/376\n. one tick means sen out from your device to the server, two ticks means it has been delivered/received by the other side.\nX means it has not been sent, or possibly not received.\n. This is the Gradle version of ChatSecure. It is now called Zom: https://github.com/zom/Zom-Android\nand has many, many other improvements.\n. You might also want to check out Conversations, if you want a more plain vanilla XMPP app project: https://conversations.im/\n. We aren't developing ChatSecure directly anymore. Instead, you should use Conversations (available on F-Droid) or try Zom.im (available on Play or direct APK at http://zom.im).\nThe last release was simply a message prompt telling users they should switch to one of these two apps.\nChatSecure iOS is still under active development, and partering with Conversations closely on Android to add next-generation encryption support.\n. interesting... so the mDNS capability is just part of Smack itself? There is no separate link or import of java mdns?\n. Should proxy be disable/not support for this type of connection?\n. Any thoughts if this check will be compatible with the ADHOC wifi mode that _hc's OLSRd app puts the Wifi in?\nI am tihnking there might be an issue here.\n. that is a mistake. i was trying to track down some cursor finalizing issues. will remove.\n. i felt it was important for a user to be able to see the presence the person was connecting from... already, i find it immensely useful to see /google or /gtalk vs /adium or /gibberbot, as i think it can help users understand who/where a user they are chatting with is connecting from, and why OTR may not be working.\n. is this perhaps why we have problems with OTR battles if a user is on both a desktop and mobile session? i know the UI isn't really meant to handle this, but if a user is logged in on their desktop and their mobile, shouldn't we treat those as two logins/people?\n. Perhaps we can just update the status message with the resource information? I don't really want to formally handle multi-presence situations, I just want the user to have some indication of where the user is connecting from, or what client type\n. It means it shows the account in the dropdown/switcher of the chat list view whether or not it is logged in. It seemed strange to have accounts appear/disappear from this list, and also, since we have better persistence of chat conversations (as an option) when you are offline, it makes it easy to switch to an offline account, and view the existing conversations/chats.\n. maybe we only need read external storage? TBD!\n. Sometimes I don't see the necessity of turning a simple String JID into an Address object instance, especially when we just end up doing address.getAddress() all of the time anyhow. Perhaps I am being lazy, and ensuring that Address is not mutable is more important?\n.

Right, makes sense. Read this too: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7748392/is-there-any-reason-not-to-call-setintent-when-overriding-onnewintent\nMaking the change now.\n. there seem to be cases where the background service/process has been killed and so the database is not open, and the query returns null. \ni know this cateogrizes as defensive, but at this point, i just wanted to avoid an NPE here that can happen in complex situations that are very hard to nail down right now.\n. the issue here is that if we are coming in uninitialized after a crash, and the db values are out of date. this ensures we have accurate status... it should also probably update the db stored state.\n. the list populates with the right number of rows, but the fields are empty, which is fine. they then fill out as soon as the asynctask is done. it looks better than the flashing.\n. I don't think it is the entire service that has gone down (i.e. another account is logged in fine). I think certain connections go stale, resulting in the empty \"ATTENTION\" dialog of death message. I thought that be refetching new remote interface instances, we coudl solve that.\nPerhaps, instead we show a dialog that says \"Something bad has happened, would you like to restart the app?\".\n. The reason I even added this here was that when I was working on the account list, and signing in/out a number of times, I managd to get into this state with Facebook (which has a very slow/long .logout() for some reason). So it is still happening somewhere.\n. I agree, it would excellent to never get into this state. As usually, I was trying to just defend against the state where find out selves with a deadobject, and we don't want to annoy the user with endless dialog boxes. For now, this was a very weak, temporary band-aid.\n. ah, you are correct. will fix.\n. i am trying to figure out where on \"exit\" there is an disconnected service reference, becasue there is an error thrown due to that. \n. if onPause() is already calling this, then yes is redundant.\n. that is confusing, since cacheWord has an explicity onResume() method.\n. he made a number of updates to cacheword in the last few weeks, so we should probably dedicate a branch/PR to updating and testing that. thanks!\n.

If this is false by default, then the first time this pref is set (i.e. on an upgrade where the 'key_store_media_on_external_storage_pref' didn't exist before) would be false, and switch to the internal dbFilePath, which would then be created and mounted.\nI think if the pref doesn't exist, we should check if the external path exists first, and then set to true, right?\n.

If your low-security key is signed by a higher security key, it should still be possible to verify that the low-security key is valid without manual intervention.\n@eighthave will be working on this approach in the coming months.\n. Gibberbot should append descriptive text to the OTR negotiation start message.\n. Cool.  I just fixed a couple of broken tests.\n.

I just pushed (-f) a fix for interoperability with libotr2.\n\nThis is ready for integration with Gibberbot and submission upstream to otr4j.\n. That's correct.  You can use SampleApp for reference on how to hook up the button (and resulting dialog box).\n. Grep for verificationStatusChanged in the sample app.  It's on the key manager, which may be hooked already to adjust the verification status on disk and in the UI.\n. I changed this to store in hex.\n. I tried this just now with the latest v8, and it worked.  I was able to communicate between this account (using Gibberbot) and a test account (using gajim).\n. Do you see any difference in behavior if TLS Verification is on/off in Advanced account settings?  (note that you sometimes have to check/uncheck it, hit back, then do it again for it to stick.)\nIn the notification area I see \"Gibberbot: TLS/SSL Certificate Verified 62 7f 8d 78 ...\".  I have TLS verification on.\n. Needs testing.\n. You can try sending messages to Gibberbot while killing its net connection (e.g. put it into Airplane mode within a second).  Once you restore the connection, the missed message should be received after Gibberbot re-establishes.\n. This is puzzling, because the XEP-0198 stuff is in separate tags, outside of any message.  I will dig into it tonight and/or tomorrow.\n. For the record, now testing against mod_smacks from the prosody-modules mercurial repository, version 625:2c07bcf56a36.\nVersion 428 had issues.\n. This may be an old issue rather than a regression.\nAlso, it's really two issues: the notification crashing and the lack of means for the user to deal with a finished OTR convo.\n. I'm on Android 4.\n. We should think about handling the FINISHED state from a UI point of view.  I think the reason that is something that requires user intervention is to prevent the user from inadvertently sending messages in the clear.  This can happen if the remote ends the OTR encryption session unexpectedly, and the user hitting Send without noticing that the conversation is now plaintext.\n. Well, at least resolves partially.  The other features requested in that issue could be lower priority since they go beyond what pidgin/adium implement AFAIK.\n. I just noticed a couple of things:\n- Fingerprint saving on lookup is not working\n- Fingerprints are stored in base64\nLet me know if either of these is a problem.\n. My initial design goal was to also generate fingerprint when the key is looked up.  This in addition to what hc requested - i.e. be able to _use fingerprints.  However, the generation isn't actually working at this point.  If generation is desirable I can fix this.\n. Now interoperates with gajim and yaxim.\n. Let me know if you want to chat about design options.  The most straightforward thing is to add a packet ID column to the chat history database.  The packet ID is populated after the message is queued for sending (sendMessageAsync).\n. I've added a commit that implements the unobtrusive UI as discussed with _hc.  It displays an icon in the top right once the first confirm is received.  It also display a warning icon after 10 seconds of no confirm on a previously confirmed conversation.\n. How does the progressbar know what is the current state of the OTR negotiations?  What if the other side never responds?\n. Yes, the looping thread has to go.  It should be updated on OTR packet received instead.  I'll look into it.\n. Looks like the way to get a callback would be to add a method to IChatListener.aidl, maybe call it onStateChanged, and trigger it in OtrChatListener.\n. Confirmed that this bug appears on Android 3 as well (Asus Transformer).\n. Lets fix this for v9.\n. Oops, pull to wrong target branch.\n. I need to research how this is handled by servers, but yes, this may help.  Go ahead and hit the Merge button if you want it in (then git pull origin v8)\n. We didn't pull this into v8.  I'll merge it manually into v9.\n. The v8 release candidate should have much better connection stability.  You can wait until it is released, or download it from the download section.  If you get it from the download section, will you will to uninstall the current version because it's signed with a different key.\n. In other news, we have the following reliability improvements:\n- XEP-0184 - end-to-end delivery confirmations (requires support from chat peer)\n- XEP-0198 - reliable stream to server (requires support from server - prosody currently targeted)\n- on boot startup (upcoming in v9)\n- foreground service option to prevent OS from killing it (upcoming in v9)\n. n8fr8 released v8 to market today.  Let us know how it works out for you.\n. To build both ways, ant debug and ant release should work.\n. I verified that there is one key per account and that keys are read correctly from the keystore (i.e. stable across reboots).\n. Resolves https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/166\nand https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/39 .\n. Lets think of a way to support the Google Apps use case without exposing all users to MITM.\nPerhaps GApps users can specify gmail.com as the connect server, and we can verify that the cert matches either the connect server or the domain?  In either case, we are checking against the user entered value, so there's no MITM risk.\n. For the record, the Google XMPP servers have gmail.com as certificate subject for the SRV servers and talk.google.com as the subject for the old-style SSL server.  We don't currently support old-style SSL.  But using gmail.com should work fine.\n. I've added a commit that implements my suggested workaround for GApps.\n. Another change to do SRV lookup on requested commit server.\n. After discussion with the GApps user mentioned above, we determined that they are specifying a connect server rather than using client-server SRV records.  I verified that this still works after the changes in this pull and without any certificate warnings.\nIn particular: TLS Verification = on, allow plaintext off, SRV lookup = either.\nSo I think we are good from that aspect, let me know what you think.\nAlso, I was thinking of removing commit \"Run SRV lookup on requested connect server if provided\" because no other client does this, and it doesn't seem to help in scenarios I can think of.\n. Okay, cleaned up.  Let me know what you think.\n. I'm pulling this, so that I can go ahead and reformat the codebase.  Please let me know if you have any more feedback on these changes and we can discuss further.\n. 0.9.0 (out on market and on https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gibberbot/files/ ) adds priority.\nBy the way, we are moving our issue list to dev.guardianproject.info.\n. I'll follow up with F-droid.\n. Lets keep this pull request open for awhile.\n. The two commits above are usability improvements.  Let me know what you think.\n. Will reopen against v10.\n.

After testing I noticed the following issues:\n- The white bubbles are completely gone from the contacts list\n- On the accounts list, if there's an active conversation for the account, it is displayed as black on black (i.e. cannot be seen)\nPerhaps the first bubbles commit should be reverted?\n. I notice you commented out mUnderBubble.setBackgroundDrawable(mBubbleDrawable); in the first commit.  What should the effect of that change be?\nBTW, I'm on a Galaxy Nexus running ICS.\n. strange, it looks okay after a restart.  Will keep an eye on it.\nI like the cleanup you've done, so I'd like to keep all the commits.  I'll just fix the color bug if it crops up again.\n. Ah, I was running an old version, the bug was still there.\nI added a commit to master to put back the bubbles on the provider list.  I left in your change to the contact list.\nI notice that your commit changes the semantics - bubbles now appear only if there's an unread message.  I think that's fine, but just wanted to point it out.\nStill not clear why the original bug - entries in the chat table even though there was no actual conversation happening.  Lets see if the current implementation works better for users.\n. It would be very useful to see a detailed log.  Could you enable logging at the VERBOSE level?  The instructions are at the bottom of the README.md file (use VERBOSE instead of DEBUG).\n. Ah, gnulogy.org does not support pings.  That's actually fine, but it doesn't look like we handle ping errors correctly.  Will try to replicate this on my test server and fix.\nMoving this to our new bug tracker:\nhttps://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/368\n. Pushed a fix for the seemingly unconfigured account issue.\nThe buddy list is cached.  It was cached even before this pull request, but due to a bug it was being cleared on signin.\n. Thank you.\n. Now that the DB clearing bug is fixed, this is even higher priority.\n. Memory is cleared only if the Service ends.  This will happen if the system kills it or if you log out of everything.  Killing of the service is much less likely if Foreground setting is on.\n. Looks nice!\nI see two issues:\n-    No icons on any menu items\n-    There is no way to get to the chat list\nMaybe the second item can be turned into an opportunity, making the chat list primary, and making the contact list be an action button away (\"New Conversation\").\n. More icons?  I'm not seeing any at all.  I'm on ABS 4.1.0 from git.\n. Looks very nice!\nOnly thing I would suggest after a quick look is to have the contact list activity call finish() when a contact is clicked, so that a back button from a new conversation goes back to the chat list.\n. Ran into an exception on one of my phones (but another one succeeds).  This is when hitting the add button on the chat list activity.  Let me know if this is enough information - I could debug it on my side.\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145): FATAL EXCEPTION: main\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145): java.lang.IllegalStateException: couldn't move cursor to position 5\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.widget.CursorAdapter.getView(CursorAdapter.java:242)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.widget.Spinner.makeAndAddView(Spinner.java:390)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.widget.Spinner.layout(Spinner.java:341)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.widget.Spinner.onLayout(Spinner.java:305)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.view.View.layout(View.java:11278)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.view.ViewGroup.layout(ViewGroup.java:4224)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.widget.LinearLayout.setChildFrame(LinearLayout.java:1628)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.widget.LinearLayout.layoutHorizontal(LinearLayout.java:1617)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.widget.LinearLayout.onLayout(LinearLayout.java:1401)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.view.View.layout(View.java:11278)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.view.ViewGroup.layout(ViewGroup.java:4224)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at com.android.internal.widget.AbsActionBarView.positionChild(AbsActionBarView.java:225)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at com.android.internal.widget.ActionBarView.onLayout(ActionBarView.java:1002)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.view.View.layout(View.java:11278)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.view.ViewGroup.layout(ViewGroup.java:4224)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.widget.FrameLayout.onLayout(FrameLayout.java:431)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at com.android.internal.widget.ActionBarContainer.onLayout(ActionBarContainer.java:194)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.view.View.layout(View.java:11278)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.view.ViewGroup.layout(ViewGroup.java:4224)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.widget.LinearLayout.setChildFrame(LinearLayout.java:1628)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.widget.LinearLayout.layoutVertical(LinearLayout.java:1486)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.widget.LinearLayout.onLayout(LinearLayout.java:1399)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.view.View.layout(View.java:11278)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.view.ViewGroup.layout(ViewGroup.java:4224)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.widget.FrameLayout.onLayout(FrameLayout.java:431)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.view.View.layout(View.java:11278)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.view.ViewGroup.layout(ViewGroup.java:4224)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.view.ViewRootImpl.performTraversals(ViewRootImpl.java:1489)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.view.ViewRootImpl.handleMessage(ViewRootImpl.java:2442)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:137)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:4575)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:511)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:789)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:556)\nE/AndroidRuntime(21145):    at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method)\nW/ActivityManager(  746):   Force finishing activity info.guardianproject.otr.app.im/.app.ContactListActivity\nW/ActivityManager(  746):   Force finishing activity info.guardianproject.otr.app.im/.app.ChatListActivity\n. And another comment: the away message / status widget should probably be moved to the chat list view.\n. This will need a rebase.\n. I've seen the latter behavior with one of my contacts.\n. By the way, we have a new issue tracker.  I believe I've identified the problem:\nhttps://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/348\nIt's a simple fix.\nTo make sure, it would be worth looking at the log (see about turning on full debug logging at the bottom of the README file, and use VERBOSE instead of DEBUG).\n. Fixed in https://github.com/devrandom/Gibberbot/commit/9f8a6191ae75c79f344c69f603fdfba4e03b2648\nAnd yes, please report issues on the new tracker. :)\n. Note that there is already such a menu (for resending, which can then be copied) on outgoing messages.\n. You can download alpha 2 from here:\nhttps://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gibberbot/files\n. It converts the modal dialog into a toast for the case where an error causes a renegotiation.  It does not touch any other dialogs.\nWhich ones do you think should go away?  Or were you thinking some can be converted into inline messages?\n. The code as it is has notification on failure and there's no setter to disable.  It's showing a notification on each login, even though the user accepted the cert.\n. The \"firstCall\" condition also applies if the app is restarted for any reason (such as memory pressure, crash) because it is not persistent.  So as implemented this setting would also prevent auto-reconnect in such cases.\nA way to implement this while allowing reconnect on crash is to turn a flag on (in the database or in a file) in a BOOT_COMPLETED listener.  Turn the flag off once the app is started by the user.  The CONNECTIVITY_ACTION listener would check the flag and do nothing if on and the pref is off.\nThis solution assumes that BOOT_COMPLETED is received before any CONNECTIVITY_ACTION after a boot.\n. Commit looks good.\nI wonder if my analysis above is not quite right.  After a crash, the system should auto-restart the service, which will auto-login in the Service onStart.  Perhaps the issue is that if the app restarts from a crash without connectivity, it needs something to kickstart it once connectivity comes back.\nI am puzzled what happens with the original code if the device starts without connectivity.  I suppose that it won't get the callback, because connectivity is unchanged.  Then once network turns on, it will get the first callback.\nBy the way, this code was inspired by the way Ge0rge does it in Yaxim.\nIn summary, I think the code with your change should do the right thing, but would be good to test as much as possible (start device without connectivity, etc.).\n. This looks plausible, but needs on-device testing to make sure.\n. Too early / low level for you to spend time on it right now.  It's more for the otr4j people.\n. Thank you for the thoughtful comments.\nThere should indeed be a guard at line 483 of SessionImpl.java.\nI didn't have it as a callback because it looks to me like the extra data is on the same level as the plaintext message. i.e. the caller would be equally interested in these. I do see an advantage to a callback - simpler API calls. But there's no breakage, since that argument is optional.\nI'm open to persuasion.\nThe reason for the list is that the TLV can appear any number of times (e.g. different data streams multiplexed onto one OTR conversation).\n. I have a different approach here:\nhttps://github.com/devrandom/Gibberbot/commit/2ac9806a14c99f1f979b8b0603881961b198c1ba\nInstead of just handling TLV 8, I pass all TLVs back to the caller.  This has the advantage of being future proof, in case more TLV types are created, and also has similar structure to the libotr and pure-python-otr implementations.\n. I also started a pull request for starting with that approach and hooking into Gibberbot:\nhttps://github.com/guardianproject/Gibberbot/pull/210\n. I am taking yet a different approach in pull #210.  Let's focus on that request for now.\n. I think this would still be useful for out-of-band data.  It's not ready to merge though.\n. See inline comments.\n. When this happens, is it \"stuck\"?  i.e. do all messages get lost from that point onwards?\n. If your server does not support XEP-0198 (stream handling), and your connection drops, packets in transit will be lost and not retransmitted.  This issue is intrinsic and switching clients will not help.\nAlso, XEP-0184 provides end-to-end feedback on whether messages were received.  Unfortunately, Pidgin does not support this standard.\nDoes this happen usually when your mobile signal is intermittent?\n. I think both issues exist, and it will improve the mobile experience if both Google and Pidgin implemented the relevant message reliability protocol.\nLooks like there is a recently implemented XEP-0184 plugin for Pidgin: https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/6940 .  I hope this will be integrated into Pidgin, or at least the standard plugin pack on Ubuntu.\n. (for reference, Git repo of the plugin is here: https://www.assembla.com/code/pidgin-xmpp-receipts/git/nodes )\n. When this happens, do you get a notification that a message arrived?  Or is it completely silent?\n. Note that the gtalk app uses a proprietary protocol, which has its own stream handling.  Google doesn't support XEP-0198 using the open standards XMPP protocol.\n. That's very interesting.  I think it is unlikely that Xabber implements the proprietary protocol (as it is undocumented).\nThe best thing to do would be to turn on debug logging and try to replicate the issue with Gibberbot.\nHow often does this happen?\n. I agree.  We need to extra otr4j back out and submit patches upstream.\n. Looks good to me.  Is this pull ready to merge?\n. To clarify, I believe that by \"OTR\" here you mean Google's \"off the record\" feature, which just means the conversation is not logged.\nOTR is also the name of the encryption standard protocol we are using.\n. The code now has a working data connection over OTR.\nIt also has a trivial test of the data connection: whenever a text message is sent in chat, another packet is sent with the same text as data with some other stuff prepended.  On the receiving side, this data is dumped to the Android log.\n. The incoming flow is:\nXmppConnection.onPacketReceived -> OtrChatListener.onIncomingMessage -> ChatSessionAdapter.onIncomingData -> ChatSession -> OtrDataHandler\n. Integration points:\nListening to incoming GET/OFFER: OtrDataHandler.onIncomingRequest.  Use URL to dispatch appropriate actions\nListening to GET results: OtrDataHandler.onIncomingResponse.\nWe need to improve this so that requests and responses are correlated - using unique IDs and a memory bounded cache.  I'll work on this next week.  For now just assume that the response is for the last request.\n. Rebasing onto v12 here: https://github.com/guardianproject/Gibberbot/pull/233.\n. Closing this since it's using an obsolete branch.\n. Needs more testing against prosody.\n. I didn't get a chance to test this thoroughly yet.\n. Great.  In particular, talking to one account from multiple presences with OTR is an area to test carefully.\n. Which version are you using?\n. does cacheword live inside the remote process or the UI process?  I hope it's in the remote, so that it gets to have the same lifetime.\nI would assume that the cacheword notification is so it can be made into a foreground process and not be killed.  If it lives in our remote process, it will stay alive anyway because we already foreground it.  It would need a process=\"remote\" attribute in the manifest.\n. This probably explains why my phone seemed memory starved lately.  I assume cacheword has been keeping the UI process alive...\n. This is ready to merge.\n. I see that this didn't touch the bare JID stuff for XMPP, so my concerns were not relevant.\n. It doesn't look like this interacts with #258.\n. Still need to detect if account exists, and skip the creation.\n. Ready for testing\n. Yes, that's why I didn't set a milestone :)\n. Actually, I don't see any recent schema changes, so this should work fine.\n. You can manually kill the UI (not :remote) process to test how the app recovers from the UI process being killed.\nThis is done in the Running (or sometimes Cached) processes view in Android's Settings -> Apps -> Running Processes.\n. The thing that's most important to test is having different activities in the foreground when killing the process.\n. yes, different activities within CS\n. hmmm.... that's not good.  Does it work correctly if you kill and restart the app?\n. Strange, it works fine on two devices here... I haven't tried a clean install - will try that now.\n. Sorry about that, had a couple of bugs with creating the DB / keystore.  Please try again.\n. I'm not seeing any gross inefficiencies in handling presence notifications from a UI point of view.  It only updates the stuff that's on-screen as far as I can tell from tracing bindView in ContactListFilterView.  It is a bit inefficient in measuring tile dimensions, and I can optimize that, but it's well under 100ms on each presence change.  I have ~75 contacts and half have avatars.\nIs scrolling the grid view slow at all?  If it's not slow, then I don't think it's avatar related, since scrolling the list loads the avatars on demand.\n. How many contacts do you have?\n. Looking at the SQLite driver in more detail, I notice the following:\n- SQLiteCursor.getCount retrieves the entire data set into memory\n- CursorToBulkCursorAdaptor does a getCount on the underlying cursor\n- The latter class is used in the remote process for handling the cross-process cursor\nSo a potential issue here is that the avatars are retrieved into memory whenever the dataset changes, which is on each peer presence change.  Converting to hex doubles the amount of data retrieved and makes it slower.\nSo it definitely makes sense to optimize this.  I know you already have a proposed design, but here are some thoughts:\n- Remove the join with the avatar table and move the avatar retrieval to a separate query\nand for the use of the GridView:\n- query a limited batch of avatars using the Provider directly and using an SQL limit clause, or\n- query a batch of avatars through IPC\n. The average avatar length in my DB is 7500 bytes.  Times 2 for hex, times 200 contacts, gives 3MB.  Not very large.\n. Oh, I didn't realize that there was an error - I thought you were just seeing performance issues.\n. Looking at the details of the cursor code in SQLCipher and the framework, I see that the 1MB limit is handled gracefully.  i.e. the read operation will stop if the buffer fills and should continue gracefully from that point if more is read.\nI would be interested to see the details of the errors that you've encountered.\n. I'll try to repro here too, by making the avatars larger in the DB (~200K each maybe).\n. BTW, github is failing to send me email notifications.\n. Hi n8fr8,\nSorry to hear that you've been sick.\nI believe I have identified a bug in CrossProcessCursorWrapper class.  This class is used to adapt the DB cursor to cross-process communication.  The bug is present in sqlcipher and also in the latest stock android sources.\nwhile (moveToNext() && window.allocRow()) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < columnNum; i++) {\n                String field = getString(i);\n                if (field != null) {\n                    if (!window.putString(field, getPosition(), i)) {\n                        window.freeLastRow();\n                        break;\n                    }\nThe break statement above breaks out of the for loop, but the while loop continues.  That causes the code to continue trying to fit rows until the end of the table, instead of stopping and returning what it has.  This has O(n^2) behavior, plus it's generally incorrect.\nI'm also seeing an issue reading from the DB cursor itself, which I'm going to look into some more tomorrow.\nThere may not be any good solutions for these bugs other than selecting with a row limit.  Eager to see your code, even if it's not quite ready.\n. I added a commit that works around the first bug above.  So you should see correct behavior and no crashes or missing contacts.\nI still see hiccups due to slowness in the underlying DB cursor itself when its CursorWindow gets full.  I will look into whether this second issue is present in the framework, or whether it's specific to sqlcipher.\n. Is there any stuttering when you scroll through the contacts, from one end to the other?\n. You merged my logic for using the unencrypted DB when the user uses an empty password.  But you had also previously versioned the DB from 101 to 102, without adding corresponding logic to ImpsProvider.onUpgrade.  Without that logic, onUpgrade deletes the existing DB during v11->v12 upgrade.  \nThis pull req adds that last piece of logic so that upgrading works.\n. That we don't have.  In general, since deleting from flash is very difficult, we should warn people in either of these cases:\n- deleting the existing DB and creating a new encrypted one (this was happening before the v11 compat work was put in)\n- implementing a new feature of going from unencrypted to encrypted\nThe current situation is that existing people stay unencrypted, which follows the principle of least surprise. They know that their data remains plaintext and therefore sensitive.\n. Any chance this can be broken up into separate pull requests for the different topics?\n. I could review each commit separately instead of the pull request as a whole.\nBut I'm worried that it will take a while to go through everything.  With separate pull requests we can start merging separate features as soon as each has been reviewed.\nLet me know what you prefer.\n. Thank you.\n. Something in this pull request regresses the fix for https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/245 .\n. Looks good.\n. We didn't address the upgrade issue - duplicate of contacts.\n. Phew, this is ready for testing.\n. Why wouldn't stopImServiceIfInactive not do the same thing as stopImServiceIfInactive, since it's exactly the same logic, nested inside a check that there are no active connections?\n. I see.  In that case should consider adding the same delayed call to the individual account signout (but of course, use IfInactive there).\n. The individual account signout would probably need a longer delay and would still have situations where it misses.\nI'm wondering if the ImApp should listen to connection events and stop the service as needed.  That way we wouldn't have to fool around with delays.  Perhaps for a later date.\n. Sorry about mixing commits that might not be directly related - I can separate out if needed.\n. This would be good to test at this point.  I can't quite tell how the original crashes happened but the cleanup should make it easier to identify if they are not fixed.\n. Okay, looks like I was wrong about one spot where we can get asynchronously called after the activity is destroyed.  I added a check for that.\nAll the other cursor handling methods get called only as a result of UI actions or Activity lifecycle events, so are safe.\n. How does the current code handle a contact being moved between groups by using a desktop client?\n. @dalb8 if you cd to external/asmack/src/smack and do git log, do you see the following?\ncommit cf9165130cd274c0188e7bf9b36d802c04b7009c\n Author: Georg Lukas georg@op-co.de\n Date:   Sat Jun 1 22:17:24 2013 +0200\nXEP-0198: prevent binding of null resource\n. Will test this now.\n. Are you encrypted or unencrypted?\n. Oh, I think the system is caching the :remote process, so the provider still has the encryption key, even though the foreground service terminated.  So this is to be expected.\nYou can go to Settings -> Apps -> Running Apps -> Show Cached Processes and stop the remote.\nYou'll be taken to lock screen next time you try to start the app.\nIs it a requirement that ImpsProvider forgets the encryption password?  If so, we'll have to implement that.\n. We can't kill the :remote process because we haven't cleaned up all the cursor leaks in the UI process.  While cursors are open, killing :remote kills the UI process, which then auto-restarts and asks for the password.\nThe quick solution is to just clear the key in sqlcipher.\n. Clearing key == closing DBHelper.  You can't really delete anything from memory in Java, unless we get into very fancy memory handling.\nCommit added, please take a look.\n. I think we should remove the Password Timeout option, since the app doesn't handle the DB being suddenly closed.  We would have to find all DB uses and gracefully handle the DB returning null.  We would also have to close connections, or use public key encryption to deal with incoming messages while the DB is closed.\n. We should also say something about \"Start ChatSecure Automatically\" - it can only work without a passphrase.  Or we could have a notification to remind the user to unlock on boot.\n. Looks like there is a bug with auto-start after boot with encrypted DB (it crashes).  Actually, we should probably disable start-on-boot with encrypted DB for now, but at least not crash.\n. Looks good overall.  Will pull in and test on device.\n. On an unencrypted device, it still tells the user to sign in on boot in the notification instead of actually signing in.\n. @abeluck  This is hex escaped in the sqlite3 fashion, so it's already a sequence of bytes underneath.\n. There's more to do here.\n. This is ready for testing\n. Nope, now there's a classloader issue.  Looking.\n. Okay, ready now.\n. A few more high priority leak fixes above.  Ready to test.\n. Gibberbot (soon to be named ChatSecure BTW) already implements XEP-0198 and XEP-0184.  Of course if the other side doesn't implement the relevant extension it doesn't help.\n. Thank you for the pointer to pidgin-xmpp-receipts, that's useful.\nNote that Gibberbot has a little envelope with checkbox in upper right when the other side supports XEP-0184.\nmod_smacks is indeed a good way to go server-side.\n. Starting to keep track of these here: https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/gibberbot/wiki/Mobile_Friendly_IM_Software\n. Will take a look in the next couple of hours.\n. Let's hold this PR for an hour or two, I'm tracking something down related to icing/thawing of the ChatView that could be related.\n. Some of the cleanup in this PR is reasonable.  Other changes, I'm unsure whether it's just cleanup or it's fixing a specific issue.  Let's discuss?\n. 41eb8ef looks good.\n. It works fine on my branch.  I think the problem is elsewhere.\n. The latest batch of commits looks reasonable.  However, I don't see the point of the commit \"recreate observer when we setup the new cursor instance\".\n. I recommend against merging this pull request as it stands.\nWe should try to replicate these issues, get logs and/or read and understand the code better.  Perhaps something else is causing null pointers in the service such as a service restart.\n. OK.  Lior and I will look at these today and try to figure out a strategy.\nIt would be nice if Service crashes had HockeyApp hooks.  Will look into that.\n. I just wrapped the couple of places where we are seeing exceptions from remote.\n. I am suspicious that onDatasetChanged can happen async after onDestroy due to the way that cursor change notifications work.  I added a check to defend against that just in case.\n. Another note on the last commit: I still think this is due to task killers or people swiping away, but this check will let us know if it's due to async notification, without attempting to hide the task killed case.\nWe can't deal thoroughly with the task killed case at this point - but see pull #325 about notifying the user.\n. I think the swipe issue is fixed!\n. The issue seems to have been with the original heartbeat code that used a BroadcastReceiver.  This seemed to kill the service after a swipe on the next heartbeat.\n. Also cleaned up some old API<5 compatibility code.\n. This is ready for testing / merging.\n. Hm.... the issue is back.\nLooks like it's actually caused by the wakeup alarm.  Will look at solutions tomorrow.\n. I am going to try to move the wakeup to the UI process and use startService to relay it to RemoteImService.\n. Now I really think it's fixed. :)\n. Crash: if you hit settings while on a chat, then hit back, it can't find the view\n. Perhaps not a regression: going to Accounts from side menu causes two accounts activities to be stacked in the back stack\n. I don't think we can't finish when we go into NewChat because the user won't be able to go back and it would be unintiutive.\n. I think there's a flag you can supply when starting Accounts from the side menu that will cause the new activity to merge with the existing one.  But maybe this is not enough of an issue to warrant messing with it at this stage.  I would wait for a point release.\n. The crash is due to mMenu not having been initialized yet when resuming the activity.  Probably the easy wait to fix that is:\n- Don't touch it if it's null in onPageSelected\n- in OnCreateOptionsMenu check if a page is selected and adjust state accordingly\n. Looks good.\n. Issues:\n- account spinner is sometimes blank when focused on a conversation\n- when focused on a convo, going to settings and back removes the lock icon\n- when a contact is offline, the old OTR on/off switch shows in the warning view\n- did you mean to remove the warning view for online contacts?\n. - when contact is offline, OTR throbber continues forever and also doesn't go away when swiping to a different page\n. Identified some additional issues:\n- Clicking on account from accounts screen shows wrong account in spinner / contact list\n- When deleting a chat, the OTR state doesn't update with the newly focused chat frag\n- minor: search should probably be closed when swiping to a chat frag\n- minor: spinner should probably not show while focused on a chat, since the chat can be from any account.\n  Alternatively, if changing spinner while focused on chat, then focus should be changed to contact list\n. Do you have my comments in email? \n. Need thorough testing:\n- New chats created\n- Chats closed\n- Swiping\n. This is for the case where the user unchecks \"Transport Encryption\" in the account advanced settings.\nThere is an existing comment by _hc \" // if it finds a cert, still use it, but don't check anything since // TLS errors are not expected by the user\" at the top of this diff.\nWhat is the desired behavior here?  We could match the require-TLS behavior, and just allow plaintext also.  But if we do that, an MITM can cause the connection to silently degrade to plaintext, so the trust manager would not be  terribly useful and would give the user a false sense of security.\n. We don't have an option that sounds like \"old style SSL\".  If we want to provide that functionality, should we create a new option?\nThe existing option is \"Transport Encryption (Require TLS Connection)\".  When this option was off, this piece of code was triggered.  It indeed behaved like old style SSL but if that was the intention, it was connected to the wrong setting.\n. It does #1,2.\nYour implementation of #3 does look like old-style SSL, but it was connected to the wrong setting UI element.  There is currently no setting in the UI for old-style SSL.\nThere is also an issue with the implementation in the linked diff - it doesn't use the trust manager and doesn't do any verification.  I don't see a reason for that.  Perhaps there was some confusion between #3 and #1/#2.\n. @abeluck - no, in this case there is no checking.  I think there is no point in checking, because a MITM can downgrade the connection to plaintext (#2).  Remember, in this case the user is saying that they don't care if the connection is encrypted or not.\n. @abeluck if we did do ToFU, it would be misleading to the user.  They would see a pinning dialog, say that they want to pin, but then can still be compromised by an MITM that downgrades to plaintext.\n. @n8fr8 yes, agreed\n. @abeluck not easily... we would have to try speaking SSL to it after normal XMPP fails (normally TLS is negotiated using XMPP stanzas)\n. SELinux doesn't kill, it just raises an error.\nHowever, I don't know yet exactly how this looks like from a user POV.  Samsung might raise a dialog.\n. Found this while debugging ChatSecure iOS - it is sending these on OTR initiation by mistake.\n. Normally CursorLoaders are managed by LoaderManager in the activity/fragment, rather than in the view.  The loader manager takes care of lifecycle stuff and ensures that loaders/cursors are not leaked.\nI would follow the recommended patterns so we don't introduce bugs and keep the code simpler.\n. WIP\n. I think we have to batch presence updates in XmppConnection, since DB updates are pretty slow on login with each buddy getting a separate update.  It takes several seconds for 100 contacts.\n. This is ready for testing.\n. Working on this.\n. Lior and I paired on this and did a major refactoring/modernizing on the way the account list and spinner are populated.\nThis is ready for testing.\nWill work on bindChat later on - I don't want to delay the current release further.\n. That stacktrace is probably related to ContactListFilterView.  It also seem that the contact list filter is broken.\n. Also, clicking on a contact that doesn't have a chat yet doesn't jump to the new chat.\n. I think we need to move away from the use of CursorAdapter.getFilter to CursorLoader based filtering.\n. Okay, that's done.  Please try to break it again...\n. The account list empty-view flashing glitch can only be fixed if we move the provider settings stuff (domain, host, port, isTor) into the accounts table and keeping the connection status up to date in that table too so that all data arrives together.  Otherwise, there's a gap in time between the old data being invalidated and the new data being available.\n. Is this a new issue as of this PR?\n. There's still the \"jump to contact on new chat\" issue to resolve.  But we can do that in a separate PR if it can wait a day.\n. We could delay attaching the empty view until we actually get a cursor back and check the count.\n. Looks good to me, although I didn't get a chance to test on device.\n. Ready for testing\n. Perhaps we should come up with an OTR extension that does this?  It would be very convenient.\n. Ideally, we should have carbons implemented at the OTR layer.  It's a bit of an undertaking though.\n. This pull req has too many moving parts, I'm not going to be able to effectively review it.\n. I'll take another look soon.\n. Lior reviewed this, unassigning myself.\n. There are several changes in this commit, and I'm not sure which one is supposed to fixed the issue.  Is it the change to getChatSessionAdapter?\nAlso, should check that this change doesn't kill the feature where separate OTR state is maintained per remote peer resource.\n. Why would the resource part cause sessions to be constantly created?\n. To clarify for those unfamiliar with blockchain based notaries, a notarization authenticates that a document existed before a certain time and not that it was created at a certain time.  Still, I believe this is valuable for many use-cases.\n. In general, I recommend code reviews as a policy.  This will reduce regressions and generally improve code quality.\nIn this particular example, I suspect that the feature where an OTR state is maintained per peer presence was broken at some point in v14.\nPersonally, I am using an older version for stability.\n. I am always available for code reviews, and would be glad to be more involved in general.\nRegarding the issue - if it was a regression in multi-presence OTR, it's dependent on how many OTR enabled devices each side has on at the same time.  That said, there could be multiple things going on at once.  It would be good to add debug logging...\n. Could you try to replace step 3 with a Force Stop of the app?  It's available from the app info when you long-click an app in the history list.\nBTW OTR state is in memory only as n8fr8 said.  So closing conversations after upgrade can't fix the issue.\nOn October 27, 2014 2:07:55 PM PDT, knoy notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nPerhaps it could detect when an upgrade's occured (compare\ncontext.getPackageManager().getPackageInfo() to a sharedPreference) and\nclose previously open conversations.\nThe reproduction would go more like this:\n1.

The UI/UX issues you mention are a concern.

This is because SessionID.equals delegates to SessionID.toString().equals() and SessionID.hashCode delegates to SessionID.toString().hashCode.\n\nSo this PR couldn't be fixing anything, because the code does the same thing.\n. That said, the fix in https://github.com/eighthave/ChatSecureAndroid/commit/f9ca2952e81332c408d9e2231ee39b4ba6f7823d is good.\n. I realize that debugging subtle bugs can be frustrating.  However, if we don't actually understand what is the underlying issue, then we are just covering it up in a way that will crop up in the future, in a more subtle way.  It increases the technical debt.\nIt's important that security focused apps are coded in a trustworthy and reliable way.  This means that we have to understand exactly what our code does, and continually improve code quality, rather than adding ad-hoc patches.\nI am glad to help with debugging, assuming there is a commitment to increasing code quality.\n. @n8fr8 - I appreciate the effort that you are putting into this.\n. The @eighthave alternative looks good.\n. @VishnuGShephertz the project was renamed from Gibberbot to ChatSecure a couple of years ago.\n. The intention there was to indeed have other methods of transmittal - e.g. an encrypted blob store in the cloud.\n. @eighthave SGTM\n. @eighthave I was just saying that your suggestion to add an authority to the URL sounds good to me.\n. Reliable message delivery is a problem, especially if the server and the other client don't support the relevant XMPP extensions (XEP-198 and XEP-184).\nDo you remember what software was on the server and other client?\n. Prosody support XEP-0198, which will make delivery a lot more reliable.  You just have to enable the smacks module.\nDo you intend to use just ChatSecure, or also a desktop XMPP app on the same user ID?\n. The problem is that each device has its own OTR state, so XMPP carbon copies are not useful.  Carbon copies for OTR would really be nice.\n. Use prosody with mod-smacks for best results.\nOn March 23, 2015 12:05:25 AM PDT, EasonWang01 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nhow to set up the server side and compile it \nthanks\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/guardianproject/ChatSecureAndroid/issues/660\n.

There is a patch against smack to connect to jmdns, but jmdns itself is a separate jar.\n. Yes, and should probably be disabled in settings page.\n. Actually, we have to think about mDNS based serverless and non-local serverless (e.g. with IP address).  In the latter case, we would want to use a proxy / tor.\n\nIt would probably be best to separate these two cases into separate providers (almost same code really, with a flag deciding whether to use mDNS, etc.).\n. There might be, lets get his input.\n. What is the reason for commenting this out?  (not familiar with context)\n. Not sure what is the intention here.  If there is a presence (xyz@abc.com/Desktop) here, there's a bug somewhere, because the UI should be ignorant of presences.  That's all handled in the Service.\n. XmppAddress is meant to be immutable...\n. See previous comments.  The UI is not written in a way that handles multiple presences.\n. We should definitely handle presences better.  I am not confident that these changes will work with the way the surrounding code is structured.  I think there are many places in the code where there is an assumption that the UI only gets one contact entry.  For example, if a presence goes offline, there's no code to remove that entry from display.  Also, if the user tries to remove an entry, that will send a roster remove-contact request, which will probably either error out if given a presence, or will remove the entire contact.\nI think the multiple-presence commit needs more research before attempting to introduce.\n. Yes, that would be easier, and is a good way forward.  That might be already available in the presence table (see ImpsProvider).  Have to make sure it's populated correctly.\n. What does this change do?\n. Curious what prompted this change?\n. I see a change in the way this is called here, but no change in the method definition.  How could this compile?\n. Ah, I see it now, thanks.\n. The loss of this line is the cause of https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/245 reverting.\n. This can be null here, e.g. when notified about our own presence.\n. I made this change because we had two pointers to cacheword - one in the activity and one in the app.  This was confusing and a potential source of bugs.\nThe key is already stored in multiple places (CacheWord, sqlcipher, OTR keystore).  I don't think it makes any realistic difference at this point in what data structure it's stored, as long as it's not something that Android persists to disk.  I don't know of any such cases, certainly not a plain Java field in an Activity or App.\nIf we were passing it to a state-saving icicle (Bundle), I would want to research first if there are any Android OS'es that might persist that to disk.\nIf we can get a more secure level of storage in the future (TPM?) then we can rethink.\n. What is this guard meant to protect against?  I don't see any code path where activity == null is possible.\n. BTW, I'm wondering if the some of the stuff in ContactListFragment.onCreateView wouldn't fit better in the fragment's onResume.  This includes anything to do with querying providers or looking at connections.\nThis document implies that the activity might not even be created before onCreateView is called: http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html#Lifecycle\nIt also seems wise to refresh the spinner after we are paused, in case the account list has changed.  Perhaps this is the reason for the crash you saw after account creation.\n. Now I noticed the commit title and understand that indeed you suspect that the activity is null.  But this fix doesn't seem to be enough, because there are other uses of getActivity().\nI think ensuring that those uses are only when the fragment is resumed would be safest.\n. Actually, I still don't see how activity can be null, since it's guaranteed to be constructed (but not onCreate'ed) at the point where the fragment is onCreate'ed.\nIs there a stack trace for this?\n. Here is my analysis:\nThe function where this check was added is initConnection.  This is only called from initAccount.\ninitAccount is called from:\n- setSpinnerState - called from onCreateView\n- setupSpinners - called from onCreateView\n- NewChatActivity.resolveIntent\nIn all three cases, the activity must have been constructed.  In the first two cases, the call is from onCreateView, which is later in the lifecycle than onAttach, so getActivity() cannot be null.  In the last case the call is from the activity itself.\nI strongly recommend only engaging in defensive programming when there is a strong reason and we fully understand the mechanics of the situation.  Defensive programming tends to hide underlying issues.  For example, a few defensive statements caused us to spend quite a bit of time (at least a day) before we identified the static ChatPagerAdapter issue.  Once we removed the defensive checks, the issue was obvious because it failed fast with an exception.\n. What kind of exceptions are we trying to catch here?\n. So let's change Exception to RemoteException?\n. I thought we were going to ignore the old keystore due to the securerandom issue.\n. This looks fine.  One suggestion is to use setIntent instead of creating another instance variable.  Activity already has the appropriate field.\nAnother improvement would be to setIntent with an empty intent after we resolve it.  I believe this would fix https://dev.guardianproject.info/issues/2047 .\n. There's something funky happening on this line.\n. I don't see how mCursorChats can be null at this point.\n. Here too.\n. If the DB is unexpectedly locked, there are several ways that NewChatActivity will fail because there are different queries into the DB.  If we want to handle that case, we need a strategy.\nI don't see how being defensive here will move us in the right direction.\n. Other places in the code use the DB.  We need to review this globally.  This will probably work for now, but should add a comment in the code and/or a ticket for further review.\n. Can't do this, because bindView can be called before we populate the extra info, and the new cursor can have more elements.  We can get an array index out of bounds exception (e.g. account add).\n. This check is not enough, because the new cursor could have an insertion instead of an append, which will cause the extra info to be skewed.\n. This is already done in onPause.\n. Just to clarify - this will not help if the DB is encrypted, right?  If the service gets killed, the provider loses the DB key and a random query will fail. \nThere are also other cases where this will not help - if the service dies while we already have a remote object in a field variable somewhere and we tried to execute a call.\nI would not try to defend against remote exceptions in a piecemeal fashion until we design a strategy.\n. I would at least set mAccountSettingList to null before running runBindTask above, to make sure we don't use stale data.\n. I see.\nActually, there was a bug previously with the connection list being out of sync between the service and the UI (App).  It could have caused this issue.  I fixed that in PR #339  by handling the LOGGING_OUT case the same in both places.\nI would assume that if this issue comes up in the future it would be a case of the service dying.  If it's not, then there's yet another bug and we should figure it out.  Hiding the issue would not be helpful in the long term.\nShowing a dialog would be good, although throwing an exception would also be good so that we get informed in HockeyApp.  Would be nice to replicate the Attention loop so that we can prevent it and exit more cleanly.  We could experiment by injecting remote exceptions on purpose.\n. I see the commit for setting this to null, thank you.  I would also remove the \".size() > \" check, since it can't happen now and don't want to hide bugs with construction of mAccountSettingList.\n. Shouldn't we reproduce and fix the actual bug?\nA remote object can only go stale if we don't remove it from a data structure.  That would happen only if we have a bug in the callback system where it's removed on the remote process but not removed locally.  We should identify how this happens and fix.\n. Let's document here under what conditions these have not been initialized.  In this case, the condition is !Imps.isUnlocked(this) in onCreate.\n. onPause already calls mCacheWord.onPause, which calls disconnect, so this code is not needed.\n. This change causes WelcomeActivity to remain running, and showLockScreen to stack LockScreen on top of it.  LockScreen will then fire the return intent, which will stack WelcomeActivity on top of the existing WelcomeActivity.  Why would that be desirable?\n. I reviewed the CacheWord code and now I think we are using it slightly wrong.  We should create the CacheWordActivityHandler in onResume instead of onCreate.\nThe reason for this is that the API for CacheWord assumes that it's disconnected while the activity is paused.  Between onCreate and onResume, the activity is considered paused yet CacheWord automatically connects in the constructor.   This is the root reason that cacheword fails to be disconnected sometimes - that happens when onCreate calls finish and onResume/onPause are never called.\nI recommend that we move the creation of the handler to onResume (with a check if it's not been created already).  We should also loop in Abe Luck to advise.\n. See long comment above in onDestroy.\n. Could we add a comment here about what conditions can cause the cursor to be null?  I assume this is in case the provider for this URL has a bug, which is fair enough, since it can be from an arbitrary app.\nAlso, ImUrlActivity doesn't handle a null being returned from this function.\n. Right.  Maybe @abeluck can clarify how this is meant to be used.\n. Actually, looks like the latest CacheWord does improve the API contract.  The receiver is not registered in the constructor anymore:\nhttps://github.com/guardianproject/cacheword/commit/0ca2300a589a8ea240406dfce258ca0057d1636f\n. 4MB seems large as a % of the heap (16MB on older devices).

I recommend to explain to your communication partners why XMPP is better than AIM (e.g. reading the ToS, \u2026).\n. For me the program is also crashing when I tap the exit button. On the next start chatSecure asked me if I want to send data about a previous crash to the developers. I said yes.\nI tried and send the data just 1-2 minutes ago.\n\nI am running ChatSecure 13.1.2 on CyanogenMod 10.1.\n. Update: The problem is caused by adium, and not Gibberbot. A workaround exists already: Resizing the user icons solves the issue.\nhttps://trac.adium.im/ticket/16552\n. It seems very logical. There is no need for unencrypted file transfer. I thought that adium has this feature already. Thank you for your respond.\n. Unfortunately, I have the same issue as saibot8. \n. After some tinkering around, a complete uninstall and reinstall of ChatSecure and using the default theme instead of the dark theme fixed the problem for me. Seems that installing to the latest version from the earlier version (hadn't updated in months, was still on gibberbot) I was on while using the dark theme will hide the messages (in my case). \nsaibot8, have you tried this? \n. For me the basic fix that I mentioned earlier worked for my Nexus 4 and my Nexus 7 (2012 version), both non-locked devices with Android 4.4.2. I agree with saibot8 that a patch is more elegant than my fix, but I'm not complaining and am happily keeping an eye on this thread in case I can help. \nI have noticed the online status sync issue that hxe mentioned (happens rarely; I fix it by simply signing out and back in again), but like they said perhaps that belongs in a different thread (I'm not sure if it's related). I did notice a discussion about BOSH in \"BOSH not supported (#414)\". Perhaps that or another would be a better thread for that? \n. I can confirm this issue. Running version 13.1.2 on Android here.\n. I use ChatSecure 14.2.0a on Android / CM 12.1.\nWorks well with my Prosody XMPP server -- until I inject a public VPN (PIA, HMA) into the mix.  I'm working (around) the WHY, but both seem to block/prevent XMPP traffic.\nI suspect, but don't yet know, that that's due to port(range) blocking, not to packet inspection.\nSo, currently, to use ChatSecure's security I need to drop VPN's security :-/  Bit of a Catch22.\nOne way around it is to enable Prosody's BOSH server, where BOSH allows XMPP where only a unblocked HTTP(S) connection is available, front-ending it with an nginx proxy.\n```\nXMPP Technologies: BOSH\n    https://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/technology-overview/bosh \nSetting up a BOSH server\n    https://prosody.im/doc/setting_up_bosh\n```\nWith nginx's SNA support, the BOSH proxy could easily be added to an existing webserver-occupied IP.\nFor this to be useful, however, the Client needs to support BOSH as well.\nLooking around, the closest I've found to bosh support for XMPP on Android is Smack (https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/).\nSmack API runs native under Android, and provides bosh libs,\nhttps://github.com/igniterealtime/Smack/tree/31c53f094c9a613821b9e101f9d7f9bfd775b4e1/smack-bosh/src/main/java/org/jivesoftware/smack/bosh\nAfaict, ChatSecure does not.\nLooking in ChatSecure sources, I do find,\ngrep -rlni bosh .\n    ./libs/asmack-android-7.jar\nBut don't see any docs, or setting, that are BOSH-specific/enabling.\nI do see here above,\nn8fr8 added this to the v15 AWESOME APP milestone on May 8\nbut don't find any flag/commit for it.\n(1) Does ChatSecure -- in release or dev -- currently have BOSH client support?\n(2) If not, can it be added? \nGiven CS's security focus, I'm guessing this is far more likely an issue that'd be dealt with here, sooner than elsewhere.\n. Same with me. I also use 13.1.2. All encrypted conversations with single users work fine. Creating or connecting to a group chat seems to work. There is a connection message for some seconds, no error. The name of group chat appears in contacts but is offline. Writing messages is possible but they never appear at the connected group members. Each member has same behavoir.\n. @00conan00 It were really helpful if you could provide a pull request with a path.\n. All contacts in Facebook are shown as offline all the time even though many of them are online.\n. You are right. Was kind of a rage commit.\nLuckily I had a couple of hours to spare today and updated the changelog. The information are from the git log. I went from current to the past and every time I found a tag on master I added it and then looked at the commits until I found the next tag on master.\nI think the log is missing a couple of features and stuff but at least it is now up to date again.\nWhile reading all the git commits and stuff I was very impressed how much you are doing. Very great. I am very impressed.\n. I second this.\nThe bug breaks the 'client locking/local encryption' feature since one cannot lock running sessions via 'shutdown & lock'. \nThe only way to lock the app is to force stop it via the task manager - not very convenient and surely not something one can quickly do when needed.\nFor reference: I am running Android 4.4.4 on the Motorola MotoE. If needed, I'll gladly provide additional information.\nPlease fix this or temporarily disable the 'foregound priority' option for clients with local encryption switched on - this can really endanger users!\n. @eighthave I am looking to add this feature to MAPS.ME, would you be able to advise? The open issue is here. You may be interested since it is free software and on F-Droid now.\n. Its so damn Possible via CS!!!\n. Great!\nWhen i get time i'll send a pull request...\nMean while\nHere is the work around:\nIts quite simple \n- From the NewChatActivity i passed an intent with values of the current username ID and the password to my new Profile activity\n- in The Profile activity i created a new connection with the intent values, picked a photo from the gallery\n  load the vcard then set and save it.\nThis worked for me Thanks so much!\n. i must say your Code is pretty abstract....\n. Am so Sorry my Code only allows one type of Account (i.e one Xmpp Connection)\nLike i had mentioned Above, i pulled the The Username and Password of Active Account via a simple cursor,Since i knew the Server to connect to (its one Account remember) i create a new Xmpp connection using these values...\nFrom there on wards i pick a photo,convert it to byteArray, encode it to base64 Then load my vCard using the connection>>upload my photo >>> save my vCard.\nIt works only if you have one Account logged in.\ni've been trying to figure out how i can make it work with multiple accounts\ntill now nothing yet but if you got one xmpp server, try it!!! 100% working\nI didn't break down everything to scratch coz i assume you have good Knowledge on Android more than me....\nIf i was by any means unclear, or not vivid please point out anything am ready to help anyone use my way. people having Java problems like me are welcome to ask for the code, i can simply Comment it here if necessary, otherwise i'll Hit for a PR when i get it working with many accounts\nBest.\n. Sorry for the delay, things in Africa are pretty crazzy here... lol\n@robertcprivett That's great with one account there many ways you can set the avatar\nHere's what you gonna do.\n in this example am using android SqliteDatabase to save the username and password values\n1. you can either save the username + password in some sort of shared Preferences or simply a database (These values can be captured from the AccountActivity.java where the user signs in or registers)\n   Simply add these few lines of code immediately after the user presses the  mBtnSignIn button via its setOnClickListener \n   this is AccountActivity class right?\n```\n            mBtnSignIn.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {\n           @Override\n           public void onClick(View v) {\n       //the password and Username EditText\n       String password = mEditPass.getText().toString();\n       String username = mEditUserAccount.getText().toString();\n\n       try {\n           sql = openOrCreateDatabase(\"DatabaseName\", MODE_PRIVATE, null);\n\n           /* Creates two Tables in the Database. for username and password */\n           sql.execSQL(\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \"\n             + TableName\n             + \" (User VARCHAR,Pw VARCHAR);\");\n\n           /* Inserts values into the Tables*/\n           sql.execSQL(\"INSERT INTO \"\n             + TableName\n             + \" (User,Pw)\"\n             + \" VALUES ('\"+ username + \"','\" + password + \"');\"); \n             }\n       finally {\n           sql.close();\n         }\n     .........other basic functionality of CS......... \n        });\n\n```\n2.  the profile Activity(this is an activity you'll have to make yourself)\n   then from there onwards in this profile activity create a new xmpp connection with the values of the username and password saved from above, load VCard from this xmpp connection, set avatar then save VCard.(don't forget to disconnect connection)\nWait a sec,not so fast!!!\nFirst select a photo or capture it then crop it to minimize its size(coz its only set to a max of 2MB) \nafter crop save it to some directory. e.g Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + \"/avatar.jpg\"\nto be safe i prefer doing my avatar setting in an AsyncTask its more professional\n```\n     class MyTask extends AsyncTask {\n           private final Void Result = null;\n           String Username;\n          String password;\n          ProgressDialog pd;\n   @Override\n   protected void onPreExecute() {\n     super.onPreExecute();\n      pd = new ProgressDialog(Profile.this);\n      pd.setMessage(\"Uploading...\");\n      pd.setCancelable( false);\n      pd.setCanceledOnTouchOutside( false);\n      pd.show();\n   }\n\n   @Override\n   protected Void doInBackground(Void... params) {\n\n       SQLiteDatabase sql = openOrCreateDatabase(\"DatabaseName\", MODE_PRIVATE, null);\n       Cursor c = sql.rawQuery(\"SELECT * FROM \" + TableName , null);\n\n       int ColumnUser = c.getColumnIndex(\"User\");\n       int ColumnPw = c.getColumnIndex(\"Pw\");\n       c.moveToFirst();\n       if (c != null) {\n        // Loop through all Results\n        do {\n         password = c.getString(ColumnPw);\n         Username = c.getString(ColumnUser);\n\n             ConnectionConfiguration ccg = new ConnectionConfiguration(\"YourServer.com\",5222);\n\n             XMPPConnection conn = new XMPPConnection(ccg);\n             try {\n              conn.connect();\n          } catch (XMPPException e1) {\n              // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n              e1.printStackTrace();\n          }\n\n             try {\n                 //Login user\n                 conn.login(Username,password);\n             } catch (XMPPException e1) {\n                 // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n                 e1.printStackTrace();\n             }\n              //the photo we saved when we cropped remember?!?\n             String path = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + \"/avatar.jpg\";\n             Bitmap bm = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(path);\n             ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n             bm.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.JPEG, 100, baos);

I think it is really good to enable SASL PLAIN. This is by far the most common auth mechanism. For my two cents, I think it is more secure, because the passwords can be stored in a non-reversible way, unlike CRAM-MD5. So, definitely, SASL PLAIN should be enabled. I can't think of many scenarios where you would ever want it disabled if non-TLS connections are not ever allowed. The server, in this regard, should be in the driver's seat deciding what mechanism should be tried. \n2. Ideally, using a 'connect server' and SRV would be mutually exclusive, both in the UI and the code.\n3. From a ui standpoint, it is very confusing to have a user check the settings, then click login, then have those settings change. I am not sure it is a win to try to be smart to set good settings based on the domain. Good defaults seem to be good enough for the other clients (pidgin is just: try SRV, TLS required, use whatever auth mechanism is supported by the server). \n. Upon further investigation, there does not seem to be much correlation between the option \"allow plain text auth\" and if SASL PLAIN is attempted. I seem to have to often enable and then disable the option in order to get SASL PLAIN to work.\n. WWPD!\nWhat is different about Google's PLAIN? It sends this:\nxml\n<stream:features>\n    <mechanisms xmlns=\"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl\">\n        <mechanism>PLAIN</mechanism>\n        <mechanism>X-GOOGLE-TOKEN</mechanism>\n        <mechanism>X-OAUTH2</mechanism>\n    </mechanisms>\n</stream:features>\nLooks the same, yes? Does it respond differently?\n. I guess the difference is that google doesn't send SASL <mechanism>PLAIN</mechanism> until after the TLS negotiations. That seems like a very reasonable idea to me. It would be cool if more servers did this.\nI suspect the pidgin way is to try whatever auth mechanisms are mutually supported, with PLAIN having the lowest precedence.\n. > If you have TLS off, we don't allow plain text auth at all, even if checked.\nAlas, this is not true. For me, Gibberbot just authenticated using SASL PLAIN over an unencrypted transport.\n. ",

    "scotjam": "Hi everyone - I'm new here, so apologies in advance if I make some kind of faux-pas. \nI'm a big proponent of encrypted comms, and have been trying to get the people I chat with regularly to \"convert\" given how easy it is to set up pidgin + otr. I have been spreading pidgin + otr among them, but some have resisted given that if they use this, they can't chat on gtalk (with me or other otr users) from their (mostly android, sometimes iphone) phones anymore. \nTherefore, I sought out gibberbot, but was disappointed to find that it seems like the only solution for cross-platform chat using gibberbot otr (which seems like a pretty basic feature to most users given that it \"just works\" without otr) only works if you install linux (or maybe cygwin) to convert your keyfile, and use adb to copy over keys to your phone. Is the above still the state of the art for cross-platform encrypted chat? Is there any other way to get Android communicating using OTR with pidgin users?\nI would have thought that in theory, it shouldn't need to be any more complicated than re-authenticating the fingerprint (authenticating another fingerprint), rather than having to copy keys over?\n(p.s. - I do recognise that this is open source, so this is not a \"support request\" and maybe I should stop whining and learn to code, but this does seem to be a pretty significant barrier to user adoption)\n.

It is quite easy to take the keys from for instance Jitsi and adjust the format so it can be imported into Gibberbot. However, I am also thinking of adding support to Jitsi for exporting the keys in \"Gibberbot\" format.\n.

If this fails there should be a file-chooser available in the OS \n. ",
    "crosser": "I believe the \"official\" way to get the path of sdcard, and to find if it is \"real\" or emulated is described in the Android reference here.\n.

I removed and reinstalled the app now, but the user on whom I observed it last time is offline now. I will update when I have data.\n. OK, apparently these are two independent problems.

There have been a lot of media referring to ChatSecure related to Facebook's WhatsApp acquisition:\n- http://www.zeit.de/digital/mobil/2014-02/threema-telegram-surespot-chatsecure-vergleich/seite-3\n- http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/messenger-dienste-fuers-smartphone-alternativen-zu-whatsapp-1.1894002\n- http://www.focus.de/digital/computer/telekommunikation-von-google-bis-china-alternativen-zu-whatsapp_id_3629901.html\nAll of them refer to ChatSecure as a very safe but complicated solution. Maybe we should use this media interest to provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface which is auto-configuring for \"non-experts\" and push the current state of the app into the app stores as long as we have this public interest. The Play Store and F-Droid versions are currently lacking of \"usable\" file transfer support, a appropriate internationalization and a lot of \"not-working\" features, which have been fixed in the meantime. From my point of view this app requires more focus on the usability - most persons don't know about the concepts of the XMPP protocol - so it might be even useful to auto-create secure passwords (for auto-created new XMPP accounts) and provide an as simple setup as the wide-used messengers today.\nWe should use this one-time chance to bring this application to the average citizen...\n. I thought it would be a known bug that you can only receive file transfers but don't send some. This is already patched in the current repository version as far as I know.\n. It is possible to set the XMPP resource priority in the \"Advanced Account Settings\". Changing the value to \"0\" or \"1\" could resolve the \"issues\" described here until it is possible to customize the resource priority per status.\n. From my point of view, this feature could be useful but wouldn't achieve what the user expects. Everyone can run his own XMPP server - so in the most cases not all friends use the same server and then a description like \"Sync with phone\" would be misleading since it is impossible to \"sync all contacts\" of the phone.\nThe process of \"add and authenticate a friend\" could also be achieved trough the transfer of the OTR fingerprint, a security key and the XMPP ID via QR-Code or NFC. After adding the own account (XMPP ID, OTR fingerprint), the security key could be used to trust the other ones account via XMPP. \nWouldn't it be great if you could simply hold two phones together to add each other as a contact?\n. I will divide my request in different parts and optimize the general translation file structure. This will result in some pull requests later.\n. About the solution: In case it is possible to implement this using the available protocols, it might be more useful if the author of a message gets a kind of \"reply\" if the decryption fails, so he can \"respond\" by resending the message. Maybe this could happen automatically (controllable via settings). From my point of view this would be a more appropriate solution than a \"double-checked icon\".\nIs it normal that this happens often? I personally get this kind of error usually rather using mobile network. This seems to be related to the cryptographic key exchange of OTR.\n. Where can I find the transifex page of the android ChatSecure project? I was preparing a german translation too but on the basis of a simple commit...\n. Thank you! If anyone can't access the page via the provided link, this one was working for me: https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/chatsecureandroid/\n. The description \"Klingelton ausw\u00e4hlen\" is a translation mistake - the original English version is \"Use ChatSecure custom ringtone\". Nevertheless it might be useful to provide a full ringtone picker.\nThe translation is already fixed in transifex, so this issue can be closed.\n. Take a look on issue #404 ...\n.

That way, you are guaranteed that any active machine would get a new message.  The only exception I see is where all of your devices are sharing the same priority (You're afk on all of them).  In this situation, I can understand why someone would want a single device to have priority (cell phone), while others would want to broadcast to all machines (you'll find the message one whichever machine you see next).\n.

    "chaoscommander": "Still not reimplemented, if I'm not mistaken? This is the reason why I can't bear using Chatsecure. I really would like to because Xabber seems to not be maintained anymore, but Xabber's UI is just so much more usable. I know you all probably don't have much time, but if the groups are already in the backend, I'd love to see this fixed with a higher priority. More of a wish than an issue, really, but.. please? :)\n. Where are they? I only see an option to start a \"group chat\", a conference. I'm talking about sorting the contact list into groups like \"friends\" \"coworkers\" and such that are already defined in the roster on the server, like it is when I log in using Xabber or Pidgin. I believe this is what sleeksorrow was talking about?\nWhy I like Xabber better: this group aspect is important, and using ChatSecure I often find ICQ numbers (I'm using an ICQ transport) not being translated into their nicknames (this does work with Xabber) so I see a long list of contacts like 123434567@icq.myserver.org and have no idea who I'm talking to. Also I find it counterintuitive to not see my contact list in the default view and having to tap several times until I get to choose who I want to message. All in all I find the UI confusing. With Xabber, as I said, I start it up and immediately see my contacts, neatly sorted into my custom group folders. I can just tap one to start a conversation, open conversations are then displayed at the top of the contact list so I don't have to switch views between those two lists. All in all it's much more convenient. This may all just be my opinion, of course.\n. ",

I've tested it now with Jitsi (Windows) and Conversations (Android). \nJitsi --> ChatSecure \nJitsi says: Timeout at otr initiation (something like that, I translated it from German) \nConversations --> Jitsi\nJitsi --> Conversations \nWorks. Every time. \nChatSecure <--> ChatSecure \nNothing happens since yesterday. OTR is always offline. Since more than 12 hours. Often tried to start OTR, but nothing. \nIsn't Conversations a ChatSecure clone? Why does it work there? \nGood luck. I hope it will work soon. ChatSecure is my favorite. \n. I have the same issue. I'm using two smartphones to test it.\n-Example:\nA sees B\nB doesn't see A\n-But:\nIf A writes B\nB sees A again\n. Yesterday again, today again, the day before yesterday... every time I am sending someone a file/image/sound, nobody realized it. \nSomebody sent me a funny picture in the morning... I never heared that message, because it's not a message, just an information window. \nSome times, when I'm checking who's online, it appears, but I was to fast and... it's gone. \nSolution : It would really be great if it would be possible to accept files up to X Kb automatically -and- if it would appear as an message. \nFor example you receive a picture, then you hear it, but you just see a block with a red cross \"tap for download\". \nOr just the automatic accept files up to X Kb. \n. Would it be possible, to add a switch, so that images can be accepted automatically? \n- No auto-accept \n- Accept images up to 250kb automatically \n- Accept images up to 500kb automatically\n- Accept all images\nOf course an automatic image reside (when sending) would make sense. \n. You can find it in account settings.\n. Now it's working. \nI deleted the app data, then I uninstalled the app, rebooted, installed it again, rebooted... then it worked again. \n. ChatSecure is connected to an xmpp account on my own \"Openfire\" server (v.3.9.3).\nI waited more than 5-10 minutes, but mostly it's like that:\n- I'm at home, using WiFi\n- I leave home, then it's switched to 3G\n- I go to the supermarket, take a walk,... then (after 10-40 minutes) I open ChatSecure and see that ChatSecure is offline. I have to log out and to log in, then it works.\nI had modified it always to 3 minutes, because the sever timeout is set to 5 minutes, so I thought it's a good compromise and it will save battery.\nThe other 5 users (using ChatSecure stable from Google Play) have no problems with reconnect. They set the heartbeat to 3 minutes. One collegue, working at a supermarket has a weak signal there (depends where he is - cellar, the big fridge,..) and while he is working I can see him online ... then offline, then online, offline, online, offline ... so it seems to work very well at the stable relases.\nI always switch to foregroud priority, because I like to access it through the taskbar and not the app icon.\n. I set the heartbeat to 1 minute, yesterday (but didn't restart). \nNow, when you told me to set it to \"1\", I just deleted the 1 and pressed again 1 and then I force closed it.\nI switched between 3G<->WiFi 15 times ... it reconnected most of the time.\nBut: Sometimes, when I switch between 3G<->WiFi, it says in a toast \n\"You have signed off your xmpp account, because the password is not correct.\" (or something similar)\nThen I restart ChatSecure and I'm still offline. I click on my account and then \"Sign in\", then I'm online again. So the password is correct.\nAn in the still opened chat sessions it says \"You are disconnected. Messages will be sent when you reconnect\". I can't send a message, but can receive! But it shows it in the task bar, not the chat session. When I click on the task message, I'm back in the chat session and then the \"Recconect warning is away and I can receive and send messages again.\n. Okay, now I tested it like that:\n- I switched 3G off and used WiFi\n- Disabled WiFi (so I'm compleately offline)\n- ChatSecure said again that my password is wrong\n- Task icon dissapeared\n  (when I click on the app icon it opens, so it's still running)\n- after 30 seconds I switched WiFi on\n- ChatSecure showed the task icon again\n- I was online and able to send and receive messages again.\nFor me it seems, that ChatSecure gets stuck, if the 3G<->WiFi \"switch\" is not fast enough!\n3G<->WiFi switch, if too slow, causes this malfunction described in the last post.\nWiFi off and compleately offline -> wrong password message, \"but\" reconnects correctly, like it is in a wait state until the user device is online again.\nEdit:\nIt does not connect every time correctly... hmm. Don't know why.\nMaybe this error message should be changed to \"Your device is offline! ChatSecure will reconnect and will be shown up again, until your device is online.\"\nP.S.: Ah, of course... The switch from 3G->WiFi works most of the times, becuse the switch to WiFi is faster! The 3G takes some seconds and it seems ChatSecure doesn't like that.\n. You're welcome :-) \n. Okay, thank you very much. \nYes, they're being sent, you're right. \n. You can change it in the account settings as you wish. The account with the higher priority will get the message, activated carbon will send it to both (if encryption deactivated or if encryption key is exported or synced). \nEvery user is able to send you on both online accounts a message directly when they choose the xmpp resource. \nIf you want to have one (of two) accounts online only, then (if the xmpp server settings forbids this) you have to set the xmpp resource to the same name. Then the server will kick one of these accounts. \nBut I'm not sure if the last logged in account will be kicked or the last active. Give it a try - it depends how the server settings are and/or if you have access to this server. \nIMHO: Using priorities is the easiest and most comfortable way (in addition of carbon message). \n. Okay, it works now. After some restarts it shows 24h format. \n. Other people aren't using ChatSecure on Facebook, so they can't activate encryption.\nWould i be possible to implement (generally) filetransfer without encryption?\n( lots of people have problems with encryption(-sync), they just want to send a file and that's it )\n.

This issue is a duplicate of (a part of) #515.\n. Usernames can have other characters than only alphanumerics. Removing all other characters is going to break things for a lot of people.\n. It's caused by this merge. Currently only alphanumeric usernames will be able to log in to their accounts.\n@n8fr8 can you please fix this?\n. @n8fr8 The RFC expresses that usernames may consist of more kinds of characters that isn't covered by your regexp. I wonder why you don't use nodeprep ? It will save you the trouble to update the regexp everytime someone uses something that isn't covered by it. \n. Yep, works for me.\n. ",
    "SamWhited": "Do you have a commit hash this was fixed in (or is it in a release version yet)? It's still doing it for me.\n. Seems to be working in 14.0.3; thanks!\n. ",
    "knoy": "No, they only use ChatSecure. One thing I've noticed is that after recovering from this bug (for seemingly no reason) it appears to show an unverified OTR fingerprint with the contact in question which seems to indicate that the OTR fingerprints have been corrupted in some way.\n. I would be willing to offer financial compensation if you could fix this bug within the next day.\n. This issue appears to be fixed with 14.0.4 and I haven't noticed any problems so far\nEDIT:\nFurther testing reveals that this has not been fixed!\nI'm intermittently unable to send OTRd chat to ANY of my contacts, this includes across between new versions of chatsecure, between new and old and between chatsecure and pidgin. Encryption is set to \"automatically attempt\". Force-stopping the app appears to fix the issue temporarily. PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE\n. I have reverted everyone I know to <13 versions earlier to avoid this issue which is why I haven't noticed, but now that I've switched back this bug is definitely still here... this makes the app essentially unuseable as it's constantly failing to initiate OTR with contacts and nothing (rebooting, closing the app, etc) short of force stopping the app fixes this issue\n. Perhaps it's realated to this bug: https://github.com/guardianproject/ChatSecureAndroid/issues/545\nThe OTR failing seems to happen nearly every time I use it within less than a minute. Easiest way to reproduce has been start an OTRd chat, end the chat, then start a chat again. This occurs between v14 and v14, v13 and v14 and v14 and pidgin.\nBTW the setup:\nCS 14.0.4 (any version 14+ seems to be affected)\nNexus 5 \nAndroid 4.4.4\nWiFi or Cellular data connection\n. Awesome! Thank you so much! Let me know whenever you have a new build out and I will be happy to test it for you\n. I've been testing the latest builds (Oct 19th) among several people throughout the day and this issue is still present about 50% of the time OTR is attempted. Others who initially had some success reported not receiving many encrypted messages (despite delivery receipts on the senders end) during conversations and after resetting the database and logging back in OTR no longer worked at all (even after multiple attempts, force stops, etc). Rebooting the phone seemed to clear the issue. Others reported problems initializing OTR with anyone running v13 builds until force stopping. Please explain any steps you'd need to help further diagnosing this problem and I would be glad to assist\n. I've been doing most of the testing on v14, the v14->v13 testing was just to ensure edge cases. In any event this does NOT appear to be a v13 bug as the OTR always works flawlessly on v13, it seems to be clearly a result of something added in < 14.0.1 \nThis also does NOT appear to be a key generation bug as I have waited upwards of 8 minutes for the problem to resolve without success, and then immediately after force stopping and relaunching the application OTR initiates instantaneously. \nThe message receipts happened after I initiated an OTRed conversation, received several encrypted messages I could read and then sent several which were delivered but unreadable to my recipient, not sure if this is unrelated\n. This issue is still really crippling any use of chatsecure. I'm having troubles understanding why you are having problems reproducing this bug as it's affected every person I know who's updated to v14. Anytime the app is updated to a new version (i.e: a new debug build) all the active chats become instantly affected and reboots and force stops do not fix. \n. Prosody 0.9.6 (latest stable version)\nTo reproduce the issue consistently: Open Upgrade to a new debug build from an old debug build, all your active chats should now have issues with OTR. Afterwards this will continue intermittently\n. Is there any way to have stale chats automatically closed when upgrading to new versions? Just to ensure that it's not the OTR issue causing this and also to fix it if isn't\n. Perhaps it could detect when an upgrade's occured (compare context.getPackageManager().getPackageInfo() to a sharedPreference) and close previously open conversations.\nThe reproduction would go more like this:\n1. Install v13 or v14 or a debug build\n2. Start an OTR session with anyone\n3. Upgrade to a v14 build\n4. Try to start an OTR session with that previous user\n. Force stopping after initiating a conversation does not trigger the bug. Instead a force stop is usually what's required to fix it as otherwise the spinning OTR progress circle will never end\n. Tested the new debug version of CS with a few people, this issue still isn't resolved.....\nLet me know what needs to be done to test or debug this. I'm at the end of my wits here guys. Looks like sometimes this breaks when other people already have already established OTR chats and your client thinks they dont, then when attempting to establish a 'new' conversation this breaks. Also as previously describes breaks on updating with all currently open chats, force stop seems to be the only way to stop it.\nI'm experiencing multiple other bugs that are breaking things in other areas but I'm not even going to file new issues until this is resolved as this is really the priority for me.\nNot trying to sound like an asshole but maybe the best course of action is to make sure the new pull requests actually fix the issue before commiting them as fixes. Whatever was done to break this, it was after version 13.0.4\n. Guys, it's been over a month and a half since this ticket was filed. Dozens of hours testing, thousands of dollars spent, three separate 'fixes' and still it's not resolved. In fact the new versions have introduced even more bugs. OTR was working 100% reliably in v13, and now I rarely expect messages to actually get received at all, this is a nightmare for me.  What needs to be done to fix this? More money? More testing? Hire an external developer to start bugfixing? I will do literally anything required to get this done \n. \"It wil be fixed when it is fixed\" this is a great response to someone who was one of your biggest evangelists and personally gave thousands of dollars to your team as well as contributing code. From a logical perspective as you have not released a new version in weeks, there would have been no way to test your (5 by my count now that I re-read this thread) fixes without testing nightlies. And from a factual perspective, @eighthave instructed me to test the nightlies over email.\nI would stick to v13 unfortunately there are multiple bugs in v13 too that will sign the account out without reconnecting, or crash for no apparent reason.\nIn any case, feel free to close this issue, I'm done with ChatSecure and will no longer be testing or contributing anything further. Keep the money.\n. This is a pretty aggravating issue for me too and others I know who use ChatSecure. If you could return the contact list to the main screen (appropriately colour-coordinated like before with blue [unread messages], green [secured w/ OTR], red [insecure] and grey/transparent [offline] circles ) I would be very  appreciative.\n. I agree, this issue appears to be especially prevalent on xhdpi and above displays. It makes the status of current chats difficult to see for inexperienced users and can lead them to failing to verify their chats properly\n. You have to enter the password in the clearly-marked \"password\" field above \"set password\"\n. A private one but I will testing using some of the preset ones in the server list and let you know\n. This is happening on private and public servers. File transfer does not appear to work at all\n. These errors are not present in previous builds which leads me to believe they may be contributing factors in the OTR v14 bug that's appeared\n. This happens consistently after updating to a new version or signing in for the first time. Signing out and then signing back in again or force stopping solves the issue\n. This shouldn't break anything, new ciphers have only been added to SSL_IDEAL_CIPHER_SUITES_API_20, the other ciphers for older version were only re-arranged. Everything has also been checked against http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/SSLSocket.html to ensure proper legacy support\n. I've added an additional fix to support TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 with proper API checking to ensure it's only enabled when supported. This should be updated quickly as TLSv1 is vulnerable to several downgrade attacks\n. I've been seeing a similar issue on v13 but I'm unsure if it's related where if network connectivity is temporarily lost the account is signed out and ChatSecure crashes. The account remains signed out when you open ChatSecure again \n. This happens 100% of the time for me as well\n. Do you think this could be a possible fix for the OTR bug ? Let me know if you guys need help testing this if so\n. @n8fr8 , @eighthave and @devrandom  I'd just like to thank you guys for your continued commitment on this issue. If you need help testing let me know when you have the final fixes in @n8fr8\n. Disregard this\n. Additionally, after signing back in the \"you are disconnected and need to sign in\" message at the bottom of chats doesn't go away, you must press back and return to the chat again \n. ",

After half an hour, the connection to the xmpp server was lost and ChatSecure was showing \"signing in ...\" Yesterday, I ran ChatSecure via a stable 3g connection (no tower switch) and the app remained connected. However, I had no other app running in the foreground. So the explaination for the app's unstable behaviour might be some difference between wifi and 3g as well as the occupation of my phone with other apps which might trigger the garbage collector, I guess. (I'm not an android expert, though.)\nI'm running Android 4.2.2, kernel 3.4.5. Let me know, if the baseband version or other information is relevant.\n. Yes, the foreground priority option was and is on.\n. \"Unfortunately, ChatSecure has stopped working.\" -- The debug test release doesn't even start on my mobile. :(\nHave reinstalled release 14.0.3 and, as a strong believer in magic, I currently test it again.

I really hope that I don't waste your time with something that may be specific to my device, my account, or my connection.\n. This release is running. I will check whether it will run over night and report back. Thanks! \n. The stability was not a problem so far. However, OTR is not working. In 14.0.3, it is. Checked it with Pidgin on the other end.\n. OTR works after deinstalling 14.0.3 first, then installing 14.0.4, configuring, setting foreground priority, and restarting. I will check whether it looses the connection over time and report tomorrow.\n. Seems stable, more or less. I lost the connection once in the morning when the telephone was not used for slightly more than half an hour, but then not again. Now, I am sitting in another wifi network. No problems so far, despite the network I am currently using is more restricted than the one I used in the morning. Both should let xmpp traffic pass.\nJust for adding to the obscurity of my problem, ChatSecure happily reestablished the connection in the morning when I switched from wifi (and a constant \"signing in ...\" screen) to 3g. Switching back to wifi worked as if there had never been a problem.\nAlso, I checked for problems when the connection is handed over from one wifi router to the next and when I switch from wifi to 3g and vice versa. All that worked well. No problems with OTR either.\n. Some kind of indicator would be great! :)\n(- bug report, + feature request)\n. Haven't had any lost connection during the last hours.

The solution is to change ChatSecure to another language (eg, Spanish), then change it back to English. The dialog boxes now say \"Ok\" and \"Cancel\"\n. I have experienced this as well.

I get the same message anywhere from 2-4 times every time I log out and then back in again. Both sides chatsecure-android. It started happening with the latest release, 14.2.0.\n. More info: The message that is repeating seems to be the first message in a conversation (like when you start and end a convo by going to \"End chat\"). Even if that conversation is ended (via the \"End Chat\" option), the account removed on one end, then added again, it still repeats that first initial message AND the new initial message from the other user. At this point, I'm getting repeats of 4 initial messages from past convos with the same user.

    "chseluv": "I agree with you, although as far as I know not many users export conversations from other apps like Whatsapp.. current expectation is that messages are simply stored in your app and not lost like SMSes. However any noteworthy desktop Jabber client makes it possible to save conversations (thus breaking the ephemeral characteristic of this kind of communication) and it would make sense that ChatSecure did too. The only major concern is: are we sure that Android or iOS won't take a peep at your exported logs? If a secure embedded encrypted storage for exported logs is not possible I'd rather keep ChatSecure as it is. It's already good. Remember that its major security threat is the spying environment it lives in and the current app meets general public's expectations in this respect since a very few will want this.\nI'd say that if ever deployed such feature should be some kind of encrypted database dump in the advanced settings so that not many people will risk their privacy by dumping their conversation into plaintext general storage (for Google or Apple to read), like Pidgin does for instance.\n. Manoucheri, it is not ridiculous at all. Inside a screenshot there can be enough proof to jeopardize users' security when sensitive data is being transmitted (what this app is for), and they may be taken accidentally too. This piece of software can be used in critical conditions around the world, even through TOR or with TOR users at risk. Simply exposing part of the OTR conversation through an accidental screenshot makes it easier to crack the encrypted session if that picture is collected.\nAlso, as the OTR protocol aims at giving you the same freedom as in private real life conversations it just makes sense that I cannot take a secret picture of my words as much as I do not covertly record our real life meetings, not even by accident.\nIt would be good to enable screenshots but let the recipient give the requesting user the permission to actually take it or at least the recipient should be warned about the status of screenshot activation in a sender's client.\n. you have to use the conference server that your XMPP service provides if there is any, otherwise you need to make sure you're using a service that does in order to be able to use chat groups. It's generally called \"conference.x.y\" like in \"conference.dukgo.com\"\n. What should Android users do now on their devices? Stick with ChatSecure and wait for updates or switch to Conversations and wait for you guys to join their project? I'm confused.. will ChatSecure v15 be Conversations while still called ChatSecure?\n. Another thing happens that I think should be considered.\nThere are jabber servers that require OTR communications and pictures transfers will result in an error at the current state of ChatSecure (note: the Android version is the only one I tried).\nBetween regular XMPP servers users, even during an OTR session, pics can be sent back and forth. I wrongly supposed that the same would happen between OTR-forcing servers but it's not the case and these servers send error messages stating that OTR encryption is mandatory. Am I right in assuming pics are converted to base64 and then sent like text messages? If that is so, couldn't they also be OTR-encrypted and that is what is not happening which causes these errors?\nAs you can read here https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-install-and-use-chatsecure they seem to suggest that pictures are encrypted during transfers in ChatSecure when the OTR fingerprint is verified, which I'm not sure to have tested.. do you agree?\n. While others have already mentioned something similar here https://github.com/guardianproject/ChatSecureAndroid/issues/699 what I'm experiencing is slightly different in that messages sent are generally the first ones in an OTR session, like greetings and stuff..\nMoreover, I receive a past text message every time I refresh the encryption with a ChatSecure user\n. I can confirm only now, it is 14.2.0a and it hasn't happened to users who upgraded to 14.2.1\n. I confirm the issue. I'm going to gather details from users and if I learn something useful I will provide it.\nMaybe this issue is related to this problem https://github.com/guardianproject/ChatSecureAndroid/issues/718\n.

That means Google or Apple probably have\naccess to it too (and possibly the carrier or handset manufacturer as\nwell). The only way around this that I know of is to use an OS\ndistribution that is adequately independent of those parties, e.g.\nReplicant.\nThanks for your interest in ChatSecure :)\n. As long as ChatSecure continues not to enable easy export/backup of\nconversations, and as long as it expects users to use it on\ncorporate-controlled Android/iOS, then it is effectively saying to the\nuser, \"Google/Apple can export your conversations at will, but you\ncan't, so there!\"\nThat's not very liberating.\nAs for protecting the exports, ChatSecure could potentially require\nthe presence of AndroidPrivacyGuard/OpenKeychain/GnuPrivacyGuard/etc\nin order to encrypt the exports.\n. On 09/11/2015, Nathan Freitas wrote:\n\nAll of the message and media data in ChatSecure is encrypted using SQLCipher\nand IOCipher. If you set an app passphrase on setup, then that will protect\nthe key that it is encrypted with. If you skip that step, then the key will\nbe protected with a default passphrase. The OS doesn't have visibility to\nthe data in a typical way, though with root permissions of course, you can\ndo just about anything.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"the typical way\". And the OS obviously\nhas root permissions.\nThe OS could, for example, read (and write) the memory locations where\nthe decrypted messages are stored after the user has decrypted them.\nIt could also intercept the characters of the passphrase as the user\nenters them, so as not to need to wait for the user if it wants to\ndecrypt them in future.\nSimply put: unless I am very much mistaken, ChatSecure as currently\nrealised cannot protect you from your OS.\nTherefore, if your OS is under the control of a third party (e.g. the\nOS vendor or handset vendor, or a malware distributor who has achieved\nroot permissions on your handset), then ChatSecure cannot protect you\nfrom that third party.\nThe only way for a user to reduce that attack vector is to use a more\nopen, trustworthy OS that is less likely to be under the control of a\nthird party. In the mobile world, that means avoiding mainstream\nAndroid and iOS, and choosing instead something like Replicant or\nmaybe Openmoko Linux or SHR.\n\nThat said, the desire to easily export/import data is a valid one, and\nsomething we should better support.\n\nGreat! :)\n\nJust as a general question, would you prioritize export per conversation, or\na full app data export/import?\n\nDepends on the implementation. I would think that dumping contacts and\nthreads into e.g. JSON or some other plain text machine-readable and\nreasonably human-readable format would be the sensible approach. That\nway, the user could relatively easily extract conversations from a\nfuller backup using other tools - even just a text editor - if\ndesired.\nNaturally, it makes sense for ChatSecure to make that export happen\nvia a trustworthy encryption app rather than simply exporting a plain\ntext file onto the handset's storage; but if the user later decrypts\nthe export, then the result should probably be a plain text file of\nthe kind described in the paragraph above.\n\nIs this a backup desire, or do you want to\nsave specific conversations?\n\nI think for most people, the former would be the priority. If you're\nin the middle of an important conversation, but you've backed up\nrecently, and then your handset gets lost/stolen, it would be nice to\nbe able to restore to a new handset from encrypted backups, and pick\nup the thread of the conversation with only the most recent messages\nlost (if any).\nThanks for working on ChatSecure!\n. On 10/11/2015, Nathan Freitas notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nYes, if your device is powned, there is little we can do. I think that is\ntrue of pretty much any security software, including Tor, GnuPG or pretty\nmuch anything. Replicant is great - any non-Google AOSP firmware is a good\nstart.\n\nRight. My point was just that whatever you meant by \"the typical way\",\nan OS running ChatSecure does generally have visibility of that\nChatSecure instance's data.\n\nUltimately, we primarily focus on network threats, and low-level on device\nthreats like non-root malware, or defending against unintentional cloud\nbackup of plaintext, etc.\n\nExactly.\n\nIf you feel your threat model includes Google, Apple or a third-party\nmalware targeting [you] to the extreme they are reading encrypted data or\nkeys from memory, or intercepting key strokes, then you should definitely\n[take] additional precautions\n\nI completely agree.\nAnd, to bring the thread back on-topic: looking forward to seeing\nexport/import (backup/restore) of conversations/threads in ChatSecure\n:) Thanks again for your time!\n.
