As to the failing of the unzip step, there's not really anything I can do there since that takes place inside of the Android SDK Manager.\n. Cool. I'll add that too.\n. Empty folder fix: 813c345262a3adeaec7323e1f3e7292e0d6a49a6\n. Error to stdout: 09dbfdd5c88106f227b00e6539d9d67f87636a40\n. There's nothing this plugin can do about that. However, you can change your setup a bit to make it work properly.\n\nEnvironment variables declared in shell-specific init files aren't not honored for GUI applications on OS X (e.g., .bash_profile). You have to specify environment variables using launchctl:\nlaunchctl setenv ANDROID_HOME /Development/android-sdk\nIn order for this to be honored you will need to reboot (or maybe just log out and log back in).\n.

Merged manually with a tiny syntax tweak. Thanks!\n. I don't think this is the right approach to solve the problem. We should simply ignore the android closure bits when an android plugin has not been applied.\n. If all you have is a Robolectric dependency in a java module with a transitive dependency on the support library you don't need the build tools therefore the plugin should not download it.\n.

The beauty of this tool was being able to get rid of the SDK completely and download only the required components on a piecemeal basis.\n. @dodgex Actually no. It downloads every required component of the SDK into the project's workspace.  The advantage is never having to wonder if the local SDK has the required components to build a given project.  Be it on your computer, a remote build server, or a sales guy trying to run the app in a simulator.\nTry removing the v20 requirements and deleting some portion of your SDK.  It will use it's dynamically downloaded components, not the SDK.  In your case, the IDE has a reference to your local SDK and can see the missing components not downloaded in sdkmanager for v20, and uses those.\nI had this same thing working until I pushed to our Jenkins build server that doesn't have an SDK installation and was just using sdkmanager to download what it needed.  My local SDK had the v20 stuff, and my local IDE was able to utilize those. But, when the code was pulled down on Jenkins, sdkmanager failed to get the v20 stuff, and with no local SDK with v20 stuff, the builds failed.\nSo you either have to do a hybrid solution like you are doing and have a second SDK instance to reference for the missing sdkmanager modules, or just pull sdkmanager for now and use purely local SDK components.\n. @dodgex Ah okay you are right.  So either way, you are still taking a hybrid approach and manually updating sdkmanager's sdk.  This will keep you going until a fix can be found.

Yeah I see no real harm in making sure the SDK Tools are always at the latest. \n. @dodgex True, okay I'm with you.

SO closed my story, linking to the \"jitpack\" solution on another SO question. Which of course, doesn't work for me.\nPer your suggestion, I've tried adding both jcenter() and mavenCentral() to list of repos. As soon as I do, I get\nError:Cause: com.android.sdklib.repository.FullRevision again.\nFull addition:\n```\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        jcenter()\n        maven { url 'https://maven.fabric.io/public' }\n        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }\n    }\ndependencies {\n    classpath 'io.fabric.tools:gradle:1.+'\n    classpath 'com.github.JakeWharton:sdk-manager-plugin:master'\n}\n\n}\n```\n. This is the SO \"other solution\" I mentioned: http://stackoverflow.com/a/33889117/879082\nmaster-SNAPSHOT again returns:\nError:Cause: com.android.sdklib.repository.FullRevision\nI also tried using, 1d29782dd6ffa18880c8cbada748fb3dea45e7be, which is the latest commit to master, same issue.\n. Ideally, master is what should be released. However, there are commits to master... I'd say ~28 or so, since the last release of the library in 2014. I guess I'll just try again on SO.\n. ",
