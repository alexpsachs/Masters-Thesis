Released\n. I've started using Radium(w/o Decorator syntax) another project. It looks better than I think. :+1: \nBut, using decorator should be postponed as It is not decided to be shipped ES2016 yet.\n. I found using Radium slow down my developing... It would be great if I made every HTML element as a React component.\nSo, I'll try another option, react-css-modules with stylus.\n. It works great. I'll re-write all component with react-css-modules.\n. Download links are below.\nBe careful. This is currently work in progress. \nLinux app\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bdvk5ebt8s530wp/Boostnote-linux-x64.tar.gz?dl=0\nDebian package\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/u9nlh0oxsg4id25/boost_0.5.8_amd64.deb?dl=0\n. I think I should remove Finder and Tray on all of Linux for awhile.\n\nlibappindicator1 is required to show Tray icon on several Desktop environments.\nXfce doesn't need to install it. \n\nUnity seems to be needed to install it.\n\n\nThe method, app.focus(), seems to be broken on Linux.\n\nXfce : app is not be focused although it comes top of screen.\nUbuntu : it doesn't work well after it called several times.\n\nBtw, I think these features are not so important.\nSo, I will implement it one by one after v0.6.* released and become stable.\n. @lucaskatayama \nCould you tell me which desktop environment you are using?\n. @lucaskatayama\nThanks! I'll cover it also.\n. Everything seems to be going well. I'll publish Linux app on UAR, PPA on this weekend.\n- App will quit on Main window closing or Ctrl + Q\n- Finder disabled(this feature will come back after v0.6.*)\n. I'm really sorry for being late... It is because of my poor English skill...\n@gromain \nI pushed it to git+ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/boostnote.git, but I realized I forgot to change the name of binary. I'll reupload it again.\nAnd, I can't find my package from https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=rokt33r \nHow much it takes to be published? I confirmed my pushing finished successfully.\nBtw, these are the files I submitted.\n.SRCINFO\narch = x86_64\npkgbase = boostnote\n    pkgdesc = Opensource note app for developers.\nPKGBUILD\n```\nMaintainer: Dick Choi fluke8259@gmail.com\nContributor: Romain Bazile gromain.baz@gmail.com\npkgname=boostnote\npkgver=0.5.8\npkgrel=1\npkgdesc=\"Opensource note app for developer\"\narch=('x86_64')\nurl=\"https://b00st.io/\"\nlicense=('GPL')\ngroups=()\ndepends=()\nmakedepends=()\ncheckdepends=()\noptdepends=()\nprovides=()\nconflicts=()\nreplaces=()\nbackup=()\noptions=()\ninstall=\nchangelog=\nsource=(\n  \"https://github.com/BoostIO/boost-releases/releases/download/v0.5.9/boost_0.5.9_amd64.deb\"\n  )\nnoextract=()\nmd5sums=('df56bf3167dddb3eb2e1b263c65e61ba')\nvalidpgpkeys=()\npackage() {\n      tar -xa -f ${srcdir}/data.tar.xz\n        cp -r \"${srcdir}/usr\" \"${pkgdir}/usr\"\n}\n```\n. Hmm... I'm reading Arch wiki again and again.\nShould I provide the installing instruction like below for Arch user?\ngit clone https://aur.archlinux.org/boostnote.git\ncd boostnote\nmakepkg -si\n. I've just fixed most of problems. App seems to be installed successfully with the shell script above.\nBut, I still don't know how can I show my app on AUR packages page.\n. I ask about this problem on Arch forum. It was because the submitted .SRCINFO file was invalid..\nhttps://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1619904#p1619904\nEventually, my app shows up. https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/boostnote/\nBut, I think I have to make my PKGBLD build the app from scratch.\n. I'm so glad to hear that. Thank you again. I'll update it soon. Haha\n. @brpaz \nYes, I'll. But, It needs to be hacked on my own.\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/issues/5011\nBtw, Which desktop environment you use?\n. @gromain @brpaz To honor your efforts, I want to add your name as contributors to readme.md and package.json.\nIs it okay to do that?\n. @fernandofreamundenl \nNote will be shared by filesystem :)\nIt means you will be able to use your dropbox, google drive and even Github repo.\nAnd I have a plan to support fully automatic syncing with github/bitbucket repository.\nBtw, we should talk about this issue here #21 \n\nDomo Arigato! :)\n\nSadly, I'm not a Japanese although I'm living in Japan. LOL \ud83d\ude06\n. @brpaz Okay, I'll add you soon. :)\nAbout Finder, I'm sorry about that. I'd checked Finder on unity and xfce only...(both of them didn't work well)\nI'll check finder on cinnamon. If it works fine, I'll enable it again when user is using cinnamon.\n. @brpaz I confirmed Finder works fine on Cinnamon. So, I have to make a function to check if user is using cinnamon. It would be finished on this week. :smiley: \n. Great! I found It can be accessed by process.env.DESKTOP_SESSION.\n\n(Updated)\nI shipped this features on master branch. It will be released with https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/26 on this week.\n. I need some help to register Boostnote to PPA... I'd been trying to do it. but I couldn't make it.\n. Ubuntu issue has been moved. #66 \n. @gromain Thanks, I'll check it.\n. @the-c0d3r  Thanks for your reporting! I'm currently fixing that problem.\n. @the-c0d3r @gromain\nI fixed the bug about selection. I'll release the fixed build on tomorrow!\nI really appreciate your help. \n\nPress ESC to watch the preview is covering up ...\nI'm currently thinking how should I solve that problem. Please wait a little.\nBoostnote doesn't close properly on Linux.\nI'm currently checking now. It might be fixed it tomorrow.\n. @gromain \nBoostnote doesn't close properly on Linux. \n\nI checked it and it was intended feature. It hides by default when click close button on window. This is because, app should remain for search window and quick write popup(coming on v0.6.*).\nActually it can be easily close completely on Windows and OSX by pressing Cmd/Ctrl + Q.\nbut on Linux, it doesn't seem to work. (I checked it on Xfce Ubuntu and I'll do it again on Unity)\nBtw, Could you tell me which desktop environment you are using?\nI'll check the behaviour of it and fix it better!\n. @gromain I think we should talk about it on #5 \nBtw, I checked it on Unity, and Unity also doesn't work well.\n. @gromain \nI changed my mind. It seems to be impossible to implement Finder window and Tray icon now.\nAnd, I know it is not so important features of Boostnote. These features will be removed on Linux for awhile.\nSo, I'll make Boostnote quit properly when main window closed. :)\nPlease wait for a couple of day to publish it!\nBtw, could you teach me how I can publish Boostnote as a AUR package?\n. @gromain Thanks a lot! I'll check them also! \ud83d\udc83 \n. @gromain As I wrote in #5, I'm going to publish Boostnote on UAR/PPA within this weekend. \nI've fixed the problem 'app doesn't quit properly'. You can check it on master branch.\nI really appreciate your help. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Closed. The bug above won't bother anymore from v0.6.0\n. It seems to be fixed now. :)\nhttps://github.com/atom/electron/issues/4899\n. Oh... I'll check about it from now on. Sorry for late answering..\n. It occurs every platform haha. I'll fix it and ship it on the update of tomorrow.\nThanks for your reporting! :)\n. The new Boost v0.6.* will provide some features about backup.\nNote storage will become just like git repository. It can be placed wherever in file system you can access.(It means to backup/sync your note by placing the note storage to Google drive or Dropbox folder)\nBut, Syncing with Evernote won't be shipped so soon. the developing and maintaining cost is too high.\nIf we provide it, we should maintain bilateral importing/exporting job perfectly. And, this work should be done every time Evernote updated. Accordingly, I think importing from/exporting to Evernote would be enough. If you think it is necessary and  it seems to be easy to embed, you can give more hint to me.\n. Closed. If the above answer is not enough, feel free to re-open this issue. \ud83d\ude04 \n. It looks great!! I really appreciate your work again! I'll merge this after testing. :dancer: \n.

Oh.. I missed this issue. sorry for my late answering. I'll fix it soon.\n. Sorry, sharing on Boostnote homepage has been discarded since v0.6.\nBut, I'll give you another option, sharing on Gist till the first week of August.\n. Sorry for my late answering.\nIt sounds reasonable. I'll implement it on this week. :+1: \n. Sorry, I'd forgotten this issue.\nCONFIRMED : It will be shipped on the next update. #60 \n. Done.\n. Please check this issue. Currently, It's hard to implement that feature because of its development cost.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/9\nBut, If you really want it and you can afford to spend time with me, it would be possible. :)\n(You can teach me how to sync or find related posts and some examples on the internet)\n. Please reopen this issue when you are ready to help me or still have some questions.\n. Those two ability will be implemented!\n. It would take a month I thought. Because I have to finish v0.6.0 first.\n. Check here.\nhttp://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.37.5/tutorial/supported-platforms/\nAnd I'm currently testing this app on OS X 10.11.*, Windows 10(64bit), Arch Linux and Ubuntu Linux.\nAbout desktop environment of Linux, I'm checking Unity, Xfce, Cinnamon and Gnome on each Linux. :)\n. @ishu3101 You're right. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Closed. I added it also to readme.md!\n. All data will be stored as a file in any directory. It means you will be able to share your note by just set the directory in Google drive or Dropbox. \nBut, I don't have a plan to provide cloud server currently. (Maybe I make a server app for dedicated server.)\nAbout the web app, I think I should imitate the way of stackedit because we have no cloud.\n. It depends on OS.\nOS X\n/Users/$USER_NAME$/Library/Application Support/boost/local.json\nWindows\nC:\\Users\\$USER_NAME$\\AppData\\Roaming\\boost\\local.json\n. I agree with it.\n. I added it to readme.md. Please reopen this issue if you have more question about it. :)\n. Hmm.. This bug seems to be network problem when updating.\nDoes it show repeatedly?\n. I'm glad to hear that! Anyway, I'll add error handler later.. Sorry to disturb you. \ud83d\ude22 \n. You don't worry about it. It needs to build installer for Windows app.\n. Could you explain more about providing this app as a homebrew formula?\nIf you give me some instructions, I think I can help you properly.\n. I'll try to make brew formula myself.\n. Could you give me more information where I can start to learn it?\n.

Currently I don't know why it occurs... we should keep watching.\nI'm sorry for make you feel uncomfortable.\n. I think the problem is due to the internet connection.\nAnd, I'd made the app handling errors from electron-gh-releases. So, this error won't be seen anymore.\n. Thank you for reporting. I'll fix z-index of modal. \n. Sorry for my late response. I actually going to publish v0.6.*. but, it has been delayed... \nSo, the fixed version will be published on this weekend!\n. I forgot to close this issue. It has been already fixed.\n.

I'm sorry... we have no way to see the app log currently....  the current version doesn't allow users to open dev tool.\n(I'm going to enable it on next update)\nAnyway, I think it's okay to ignore that problem until someone find the way to repopulate this problem.\nThanks for reporting. :)\n. You should use mono spaced font. :smile: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font\nTry 'monaco' or 'menlo'\n. @sami3d\nIf you are using Windows, try Consolas.\nIt is a common behavior of Ace editor. To map selectable area, The editor calibrates the width and height of font by calibrating a random char. So you should use monospaced font.\n. I confirmed this problem. \nBut, it is a bug of Ace editor. It should be fixed from here.\nhttps://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/issues/2978\n. Ace doesn't seem to afford to fix this bug. I'm currently going to replace Ace with Codemirror.\n. Sorry for wait a long time. From v0.7.0, Boostnote will use codemirror. So, this problem will be gone soon.\n. Close it now. You can track the progress on TodoList #68\n. I've been considering it also. So, the next version of Boostnote will use react-router and provide URL of each folder and note.\n\n\nv0.6.* will display current URL in status bar below.\n\nAnd, the behaviour should be like the behaviour of common browsers.\n(Click to switch note / Shift + Click to open in new window)\n. Close it now. You can track the progress on TodoList #68 \nI'll implement it soon.\n. Great idea. \nThe only problem is that I don't know how to modify the behaviour of Ace editor. Anyway, I'll give a shot.\nIf you have some kind of hint to embed it, please teach me.\n. https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/blob/master/lib/ace/mode/markdown.js#L59-L71\nIt occurs here. But, it doesn't seem to be possible to do that by just modifying method, getNextLineIndent. I'll try to find another approach. :)\n. Closed! You can track the progress on TodoList #68\n. Thank you so much!\n. It will become like you said. I'd been called it as 'Repository'. But, I think the word 'Book' is much better.\nThanks for your opinion and sorry for late answering. :)\n. From v0.6, you can make it.\nBut, the app uses the word 'Storage' instead of 'Book'.\nThanks for your suggesting.\n. You can change folder from folder select.\n\n. Closed #47 \n. Sorry for late answering. I'll check it soon.\n. @tomkenta Which OS you are using? Does it still occur after updating v0.6?\nIf the problem isn't gone, please reopen this issue.\n. I agree with it. :) I'll try it soon.\n. Closed!

But I can't understand how to import a note from PDF.(PDF => Markdown)\nCould you tell me more information?\n. Attaching file(not only PDF) will be supported somewhen.\nAnd, could you explain other stuffs more specific?\nI can't understand where I should start to deal with your demand.\n. Closed. I need more information to proceed. I'll open it again after you giving more.\n. Exporting as a markdown or html file will be possible soon.\nAnd exporting as a pdf, docx file would be possible somewhen.\n. It is also needed. I'll implement it the update of this weekend.\nAnd, It would appreciate if you please give me more specific hint. \ud83d\ude03 \n. Closed. I listed this issue to #68. please track the progress from there!\n. Good idea. Acutally, I'm gonna make an unique editor for Boostnote.\nThis would be helpful to enhance UX\n. Closed. I listed this issue to #68. please track the progress from there!\n. Thanks for your reporting. It is a bug of ace editor. I created a new issue about it.\nhttps://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/issues/3022\nAnyway, I'll develop a custom editor for Boostnote on this month to replace Ace.\n. @facundomedica Definitely, Ace editor must be replace with Codemirror some when. I comfirmed those special chars work well on codemirror.\n. This will be fixed the next update. We replace Ace editor with Codemirror. It seems to work well!\n. I'm glad to hear that.\nThere is a closed slack team of Boostnote already. Send me a mail, fluke8259@gmail.com, then I'll invite you to the team.\n. This issue will be discussed from #128 \n. I'm going to fix it on the update of this Sunday. \nLaunching an app on startup is not difficult, and I think it shouldn't be a feature of Boostnote. It might be quite annoying for some users.\nApple >> System Preferences >> Users & Groups >> Login Items >> Plus Button\n\n. From v0.6, closing main window doesn't cause quitting app\n. It seems to be an error from electron. I'm currently inspecting.\n. Do you still have this problem? \nI couldn't find any problem of this...More information is needed to deal with this problem.\nIf you do, please reopen this issue and please give me more information related this problem.\n\nLike processes list, which can be printed by ps -e|grep boost\n. Sorry, I didn't noticed only I can reopen.\n\nAnyway, here comes more questions.\n1. Is the app still working after error occurs?\n2. Could you tell me your desktop environment version?\n. I'll install Ubuntu on this weekend to deal with this problem. Hang on a little more. \ud83d\ude22 \n. I fixed this problem on ubuntu. If this error pop again after updating v0.6.3, comment here. Then, I'll re-open this issue.\nAnyway, v0.6.3 will be published Today. FIY, check #72. \n. @lakshayg Thank you for reporting. I'll check it again.\n. It seems to be due to the version of Electron. After I updated to v1.2.8, the error won't occur anymore.(Currently Boostnote using v1.1.3)\nBut, we have to keep watching. I'll inform you when I updating.\n. @lakshayg v0.6.4 released. I confirmed it works well on Ubuntu now!\n. Hmm... It's too hard to deal with it... Okay, I'll check it again.\n. I think intercepting close event of Main window causes this problem. I'll fix it the next update(v0.6.7 or v0.7.0).\n. I confirmed it has been fixed. Please check v0.6.7. If it still doesn't work, comment here.\n. Thanks for suggesting. Let's make it for free to everyone!\n. #85 It will be discussed from here!\n. @kabeza I've checked it on Windows 10 just now. But, It works fine without any problem.\nCould you give me a more information? If an error occurs, You can check it on devtool.\nIt can be opened by navigating menu, View->Toggle Developer Tools, or pressing Ctrl + Shift + I.\n. @kabeza \nSorry, It's a bug. I found the matching of syntax type is case-sensitive.\nI'll fix it soon. Before It done, you can find it by php instead of PHP\nAdditional: This is a full list of available syntax.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/browser/lib/modes.js\n. @kabeza\nI think making UI like below screenshot would be great.\nI agree with the syntax is too huge... I'll fix it soon.\n\nhttps://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/\n. Closed. You can track the progress on TodoList #68 \nI'll add a comment when it implemented!\n. @askg7dawn \nSorry, Finder has been disabled temporary. \nI have to redesign it because the note format has been changed.\n\nwhen using finder, i'm happy if only snippets are shown up\n\nAs your wish, The new Finder will be designed to search snippet note mainly. :)\n. @askg7dawn \nFYI, Check this issue. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/58\nI'll add more functions like Snippets Lab after reviving Finder.\n. Released.\n. @facundomedica It is disabled temporary!\nCheck the comment in #60.\nbtw, I'll close this issue when I reimplement it.\n. And, I'm terribly sorry... I've just realized there are many people using it than I thought.\n. Done! #72 \n. It was intended because I thought the snippet note is just for snippet. And, there might be some people who want use store a snippet note(because some syntaxes, like table, are too verbose).\nBut, I also think rendering markdown doesn't seem to suck.\nI'll inform you later after I decided.\n. Decided: Markdown snippet will be rendered!\n. It will be shipped on v0.6.3. #72 \n. Current version is v0.6.2. \nIt means if you update the app, you don't have to worry about this problem.\nThis issue will be closed on next Thursday.\n. @dojineko \u3053\u3053\u306f\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u3067\u3059\uff01\u6765\u9031\u6c34\u66dc\u65e5\u304c\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u8a66\u9a13\u3067\u3001\u305d\u306e\u5f8c\u304b\u3089\u306f\u590f\u4f11\u307f\u958b\u59cb\u3067\u3059w\n. @robertweber95 Thx for saying. But some features are not confirmed to change :)\nBut, you can help me give some feedback. It makes me easy to decide how to improve the UX of this app. :)\n. @sami3d Did you fail to migrate the notes of previous version?\n. @sami3d \nHang on a little more. I'll publish the new version tomorrow.\nDark theme and customisation of UI colors will be available after updating.\n. @dojineko Could you join our slack? If it is possible, send a mail to me and I'll invite you. fluke8259@gmail.com\n. @sami3d You're welcome.\nAsk me anytime. Your feedback nourishes our project.\n. Fixed\n. Thx! I'll ship it on next update!\n. Sorry for delaying.. I have to postpone update on this Friday(20106/08/12).\n. Released.\n. I agree with your idea. It will be shipped some when. I'll inform you again when I'm ready.\n. Closed! You can track the progress on TodoList #68 \nI'll add a comment when it implemented!\n. @specktator Thank you for commenting. I'll check seafile later.\n. @TheManFran \nThis issue is duplicated. #57  I'm going to install Ubuntu to my PC on this weekend to deal with this problem.\n@syossan27 It might be caused by my mistake. I'll report it after confirming it is not my fault.\n. We're going to replace the current editor, Ace, with Codemirror.\nAfter replacing, we might be able to use codemirror-spell-checker . But, It is available only en-US now.\n. Spellchecking API of chrome doesn't seem to be available yet.\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/issues/3211\n. @modmod24 Did you check devtool? And which OS are you using now?. Cool! I'll merge and apply the next update.\n. \nIt will be fixed today's update\n. Which version of node you are using?\n. npm start is for only production env.  You should have compiled codes to run it.\nAnd, the compiled code will be generated by grunt compile.\nSo, try grunt compile before running npm start.\nFYI:  npm run webpack is to run HMR server for development. It won't generate any code .\np.s. I'll update readme.md about this issue on this weekend.\n. > Having an option to upload images and add them to a markdown note\nI think these behaviours might be enough.\n- If target path of a photo starting with http:// or https://, add a image to a note\n- If target path of a photo starting with / or relative, copy the image to note storage and add the coppied to note.\nI don't think we have to provide some kind of a URL form to download an image by URL.\nBecause users already be used to do it and it is a quite trivial task.\nAnd, I'll look for how we can handle drag & drop event.\n\nBut since deleting the img-tag in the editor does not remove the image, we may need a admin interface, too.\n\nPhotostream UI of iPhone might be a valid option for the admin interface.\n. Currently It is not available now. I added it to #68 \n. fixed on v0.6.4\n. Done. It will be shipped on this weekend.\n. I added a candidate of new name, EVA. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity\nI think this concept is quite interesting and suits the name of app.\n. Command section has been updated.\n. @brpaz \nOkay.\nI'll imitate the menubar app, which can do both writing and searching a note, and replace the current Finder with it.\n. @darahak \nSorry, I didn't notice the document had been removed. Check the below link.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/docs/build.md\n. Closed. These items will be maintained from #2 \n. Ace renders the content by the width of a random char. You should use monospaced font. #39 \nIt might become better after we switch the editor with Codemirror.\nSorry for making you confused. \ud83d\ude22 \n. @huettenhain \nThe app will automatically detect the new release and prepare updating.\nWhen updating is ready, It will shows a dialog to update. :)\nAdditionally, you don't have to update by the dialog. It only does restart the app. So, you can apply the new release by restarting app whenever you want.\n. @darahak \nI'm going to make a custom mode selector! I added it to #68. \nBy the way, you can do it now easily by filling file name ended with *.js. #84 \nBoostnote will set syntax mode automatically.\n\nIf you found some filename pattern, which Boostnote can't detect the syntax type, just tell me and I'll implement it soon.\n. I'm very very excited your feedback.\nBtw, these are my answer to each item.\n\nMenubar quick note scratchpad\n\nCheck #85. There are some comment about this. We can talk more about this issue.\nAnd I agree with that the icon should be black & white.\n\nWord and character counter\n\nShould I count all of characters(including markdown syntax) or only rendered text? \n\nExtensive theme styling and customization\n\nI was going to implement it on the last update, v0.6.3. I'd tried to set the colors to inline style instead of CSS. But, I noticed that, like :hover, some selector isn't available on inline style.\nSo, this is currently pending now. \nBut, It doesn't mean I gave up. I think it can be done by re-compiling customized style and saving it to some kind of cache(localStorage would be fine). So, It would be a matter of time.\n\nMultiple note selection for deletion\n\nIt should be. Btw, I want to ask something. Is there any other function for multiple note selection?\nI think moving notes to other storage or folders might be a valid choice.\nFYI, OS X Notes only provides these options.\n\n\n(I would personally get rid of the blue border and just add a bit of a darker background for selection: http://i.share.pho.to/4bca6da7_o.png)\n\nThis can be solved after the customization is available.\n\nProper dropbox integration with encryption (see: https://laverna.cc/).\n\nCool. I'll check it. We should talk about more. If you have an detailed idea about this, make a new issue like #80 and we could be implement this much faster.\n\nEach storage saves to separate folder. Each snippet saves in a subfolder with the according file syntax extension e.g.: MyStorage>Default(4bc6eb15d8b8)>MySnippet>TabOneFilename.html\n\nHmm... I can't sure this should be implemented. By this, users can edited their note from their own editor. But, It makes hard to maintain the storage.\nIn fact, I was going to collapse all of folders and put all of their notes into a single folder. #89 \nI think we should talk about this more.\n\nImport folders to left sidebar (dropdown tree structure).\n\nI can't understand what it means. Could you explain more about this?\n\nDistraction free and dual panel live preview modes.\n\nIt should be. I'll ship it soon. \n. @twhiting Thanks for your feedback! \n\nAn easy way to bold, strike-through, italicize, etc. Just some formatting buttons...\n\nIt should be and not so difficult. I think I can ship it on this week.\n\ncolor text\n\nIt is possible. Boostnote try to comply Common Markdown. All html tag will be rendered just as it.(To prevent XSS, we use sandbox iframe as a renderer.)\n\nImage support\n\nCheck #93 . Although it seems to be inactive now, I consider it is a quite important feature.\nI'll work it, after #100 done.\n\nFull-screen mode\n\nI need more explain. There are so many options related in fullscreen. \nEx) Fullscreen whole app, only preview, 2-pane(editor and preview)\n\nScroll past the bottom most line of the editor.\n\nI'll try to fix it on this week. But, It might be shipped on the next week.\n\nSecurity and Cloud issues\n\nI gladly want to do. Just the only problem is my lack of skill and time.\nCurrently, I'd been developing dataApi and its test. With this data api, I think Boostnote storage can be served by any NodeJS server. After refactoring dataApi done, I'll start integrating each cloud service.\nAbout security, I think it quite takes lots of time and more information. We have to discuss this issue more.\nBtw, We have a slack. if you want to join us, send me an e-mail. fluke8259@gmail.com\n. I agree with that. It is a easy task because Boostnote sets title of a note when editing finished.\nI'll ship it on this weekend.\n. Sorry for making you wait! I'd been busy...It will be shipped on this weekend.(CONFIRMED)\n\n. Great! I've recently heard about the tab index of editor. So, I think this kind of feedbacks are quite important. If you have more idea about this, it is also okay to make a new issue instead of making a PR.(It is your own choice)\n. Thank you so much!\n. I should add you as a contributor of Boostnote. Thank you again. :)\n. Thank you so much!\n. Refactoring reducer effects so much. The indexing speed's became so fast.\nI mapped all notes by storage, folder and tag. And I'm using global.Map instead of Immutable.Map.\nAnyway, this PR is almost done. I think I could push and merge this tomorrow.\n. \ud53c\ub4dc\ubc31 \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4! #68 \uc5d0 \ucd94\uac00\ud574\ub480\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uc5bc\ub978 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub3c4\ub85d \ub178\ub825\ud574 \ubcfc\uac8c\uc694!\n. \n\uc774\ubc88 \uc8fc\ub9d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4!\n. \ub2a6\uc5b4\uc838\uc11c \uc8c4\uc1a1\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4!\n.

Also, you can access finderWindow here.\n. @brpaz Please push it if there are any progress. I'm going to complete this on this week. \ud83d\ude00 \n. Fine! Btw, How many folder you are using? If possible, could you show me a screenshot of your workspace? I just want to know how our users are using Boostnote.\n. @robertomarcal Thanks for your answer. It is so helpful! \ud83d\udc4d \n. Thanks for your suggesting. It is a good idea.\nBut, before shipping, we have to discuss this issue a little more.\n\nAfter I put the notes in Archive folder, I do not want the notes in that folder shown in All Notes section.(but able to search the archived notes)\n\nI think the archived notes should be searched when the user set some flags(including archived notes or filtering archived notes only).\nAnd I have one more thing to discuss. When original folder deleted, how to handle the archived note?\nCurrently, I'm going to recreate the folder by the original key of note.(It might not be able to revive name and color of the deleted folder)\n. Great! We might be good to go. \n. It will be renewed from the next release.Check this brach. \nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/tree/data-api-refactor/browser/main/lib/dataApi\n. I'll check it. Could you attach some screenshots?\n. @brpaz Oh... I'll fix it in this week. Sorry for the inconvenience.\n. Fixed! It will be shipped on this Saturday.\n. I agree. I'll update on this week.\n. Shipped! Confirmation dialog will appear when deleting a snippet with content.\n. It is a piece of cake for me. I'll ship it on this week. :)\n. Sorry, I realized it has been implemented already. You can search notes by tag with # just like hashtag of twitter! (On this case, try #foo or #bar)\nSorry for the lack of tutorial. \ud83d\ude22 \n. Hmm...In fact, I've rarely been using tags. And, I think it is okay to offer several search options.\nCould you tell me the ideal searching behavior of yours?\n. Great! Applying all options doesn't seem to be harm. I'll ship it the next update on this weekend.\nThank you so much! \ud83d\udc4d \n. Shipped!\n. Yes, It is weird a little... \nCurrently, I have 2 options.\n1. Forbid spaces\n2. Provide an escape character like \\\nAnd both of them doesn't seem to be attractive...\nIs there some better way to tackle this problem?\n. @huettenhain Thanks for the feedback. It seems to be a clever choice. \ud83d\udc4d \n. @tbfisher That is also good for better UX. Thanks for your comment \ud83d\udc4d \n. Currently, the app will replace spaces with an underscore. I'll make the pulldown dialog like slack later. :)\n. You should wait more than 2.5 seconds before refreshing the app. Boostnote doesn't write down every changes to file system. \nAs you see, it waits the end of editing.\nFirstly, the detail component dispatches the change after a second from the last editing.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/v0.6.2/browser/main/Detail/SnippetNoteDetail.js#L101-L113\nThen, dataApi queues saving the changes to File system and waits 1.5 seconds.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/v0.6.2/browser/main/lib/dataApi.js#L22-L32\nCould you check it once again? If the waiting doesn't work, It must be a bug. \n. @huettenhain Okay, I'll check it again. Anyway, it works well on v0.6.5.\n. It seems to be fixed now!\n. @fabiola17lopez \nThere might be a bug in console. Could you me send a screenshot of it? \nI think the data might be able to be recovered.\n. @fabiola17lopez \nI can't see your screenshot. You have to attach the image from github issue tracker.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/115\n. @fabiola17lopez \nI need a screenshot of console. You can open the console by Ctrl + Shift + i. There might be an error message.\nBtw, if you don't mind, send me(fluke8259@gmail.com) your storage folder. I think It would be the fastest way to inspect and fix the problem.\n. Actually, I have a plan to implement it. And, I agree with @huettenhain 's opinion, it should be optional.\nCurrently, I'm going to implement 3 buttons to the bottom of main window, just like Power Point.\n\n1. Single view(current)\n2. 2-pane view(@incredibleweirdo said)\n3. Fullscreen preview\n@incredibleweirdo I'm sorry for my late response.\n. @baer It would be great. But, It will takes lots of time because each block should be rendered as a react component.\n. @baer Thanks for suggesting. I'll try it and inform you later. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Fixed\n. @jc21 I'm really sorry. I'll release a fixed version today.\n\nI confirmed it works well. https://github.com/BoostIO/test-releases\n\nBut, current version v0.6.6 also has a same problem. please download again after v0.6.7 released.\n\nIn my case, the app has been updated to v0.6.6 since I restarted twice.\n. @jc21 Thank you for your understanding. Btw, It seems to be fixed completely now. \ud83d\udc4d \n. @osiyuk No, we don't gather it now neither.\n. Fixed\n. Boostnote has supported LATEX block(inline: $$, block: $$$).\n\nTry\n```\n$$\\alpha$$ and $$\\beta$$\n$$$\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\n$$$\n``\n. Fixed.\n. I need more information. You can open console by pressingCmd + Alt + I`. Send me the error message!\n. Haha, that's not your fault. I think I have to show some alert when the user trying to create a note without folders.  \ud83d\ude01 \nThese feedbacks also help me to make Boostnote better. So, don't hesitate to ask me.\n. Thank you for your feedback.\n\nIt would be cool have possibility to make nested folder structure, adding subfolders.\n\nWe need to discuss this issue more. How many notes you have? And, I'll make a new issue about it later.\n\ndefault syntax for folder and opportunity to edit syntaxes list (hide unused)\n\nThis acutally is planned. I think It will be shipped within 2 weeks\n\nlastly, would be very useful have more options for customizing Finder. Search by tags, change font, theme, sizes, hide sidebar, etc.\n\nIt would be great. But, all of problems is how it should be.(For me, designing app is MUCH HARDER than writing code) Could you give me more information here?  #85 \n. Great! Thanks you so much! Your feedback is so helpful.\nI am acutally going to several ways to keep and indexing notes by the purpose like #123 .\n\nEven such simple things as make a comment on the usual hotkey, unfortunately almost impossible anywhere, about a deeper customization can only dream of, and usually support with updates always leaves much to be desired.\n\nLet's do it.\nI think these api should be provided customizable hotkey. And also I think i should provide some scope of hotkey.(It might be optional)\n| Api | key | scope |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| New note(default behaviour, same as clicking the plus button) | Cmd + N(OS X) / Ctrl + N(Others), a(when focusing SideNav) | global |\n| New Snippet note | Cmd + N S / Ctrl + N S | global |\n| New Markdown note | Cmd + N M / Ctrl + N M | global |\n| New note dialog | Cmd + N N / Ctrl + N N | global |\n| Delete note | Ctrl + Backspace(OS X) / Ctrl + Delete(Others) | global(except focusing editor) |\n| Focus detail | e | side nav and list |\n| Focus editor | ? | detail and list |\n| Focus tag input | ? | detail |\n| Focus filename input | ? | detail |\n| Focus syntax mode input | ? | detail |\n| Add Favorite | Cmd + D / ? | global |\n| Focus search input | Cmd + P / ? | global |\n| Change font size of renderer | Cmd + +(OS X) | detail |\n| Focus sidebar(to navigate folders and storages by arrow keys, \u2191 and \u2193) | list and detail |  |\n| Create folder | Shift + A | side nav |\n| Delete folder | d | side nav |\n| Add Storage | ? | side nav |\n| Unlink Storage | ? | side nav |\n| Rename Storage | ? | side nav |\n| Focus Note List(to navigate notes by arrow keys, \u2191 and \u2193) | Esc | sidenav and detail |\n? is I cannot sure which key would be proper. I think some of them doesn't need to be provided by default.\nIf I missed something or did wrong, please tell me.\n\nI want to store personal library\n\nIt is so interesting. I think if we provide a storage like Wiki, it would be helpful for building it.\nBy the way, I want you to join our slack. If you don't mind, send me an e-mail and I'll invite you. fluke8259@gmail.com\nIt is integrated with this storage. So, you could check our progress easily.\nI'm look forward to your next feedback. I'm glad to help you realize your ideal. \ud83d\udc4d \n. @UltraG33k \nWe might be able to implement it with this. Thanks for your reporting.\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/auto-launch\n. @ArtemMedvedev \nWe decided to implement the nested structure of folders. \ud83d\udc4d  I'll inform you the detail later.\n. We're going to renew Boostnote soon. And, definitely, the renewed app should have sub folders.. @ctoscano \nNot available yet. I'm going to quit my job at the end of this year to focus on this project. I'll address it when I'm ready to go!. @twhiting \nThanks for reviewing.\nBtw, I want you to join our slack. If it's okay, please send me a e-mail and I'll send an invitation. fluke8259@gmail.com\n. @tejado I'm still wondering am I doing right.\nQuiver's solution is quite simple and easy. \nhttps://github.com/HappenApps/Quiver/wiki/Cloud-Syncing\nBut, my solution is quite hard way. Also, there might be a few people who want my solution.\nWhat do you think? which one is better?\n@twhiting I need your feedback also!\n. I already made the abstract api and its test.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/tree/master/browser/main/lib/dataApi\nCould you glance over it? I'm actually not sure this api is the best.\nAnother option is making an adapter of couch DB for Google Drive.\n. @tejado @twhiting \nThanks for your feedbacks. \nI was afraid if quiver's way would be enough. But, as you said, we should do it eventually.\nAlso, about https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/153, I think it is good to stick with current way(each note is saved as a file).\n. Thank for the reporting.\n. @jkurei \nI think your comment is irrelevant to this issue. If it is, please create a new issue of it.\nAlso, could you tell me more specifically why you need it?\n. Awesome work! Thank you so much!!\n. Thank you for reporting. It will be fixed soon!\n. I need more information.\nOpen console by pressing Cmd + Alt + I. There might be an error message.\nAnd, take a screenshot of it.\n. @Venox \nIn your case, It is not a bug. Just add a storage and create a folder.\n\nHmm.. I think I should provide a unremovable storage which uses app cache. The app without any storages actually is inability.\n. @Venox Yes, it should be as you said. Thanks for your feedback!\n. @lazytyper \nHow should we implement it?\nI think the below way would be the best because it can be parsed anywhere.\n(Of course, Boostnote will render it as an iframe tag instead of an anchor.)\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE \"Video Title\")\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11804820/embed-a-you-tube-video\n. @lazytyper I can't see anything. Could you assign the link again?\n. @lazytyper Great library!\nBtw, it is written in PHP. I'm going to try this.\nhttps://github.com/alanshaw/embed-video\n. Done. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/commit/f0d2fb53d4de95244834ffe5d444768db930f057 https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/commit/b18a5be9402f59a3039a1f648196fe1dd4288775\n. I agree with you. btw you can find it from here.\n\n\n. Oh.. I was about to write an answer. I'm glad to hear that! \ud83d\ude04 \n. Sorry for late answer. I also agree with your proposition. It might be good to be by default.\nCould you send the edited code as a PR?\n. @mikeres0 Could you create a new PR anyway? It would be helpful for me to know how should I tackle.\n. Thank you so much!\n. @mikeres0 Sure! Send me an e-mail and I'll invite you. fluke8259@gmail.com\n. @mikeres0 Thanks for pointing. This is my first open-sourced project. So, I didn't know when I should close the issue.\n. I noticed it, and It is already fixed from the next version!\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/v0.7.0/package.json#L66-L68\n. Fine, but I definitely told you we won't support legacy version of nodejs.\nThere is no reason to support it.\n. It looks much better! Thanks for your reporting! I'll apply it on the update of this week.\n. Shipped!\n. We're currently working it now. Hang on a little! \ud83d\udc4d \n. \nIt will be like the above screenshot.\n. Shipped!\n. As I told you we won't support any legacy version of NodeJS. Also, I'm going to focus on supporting only v6(stable and edge).\nBy the way, I agree with deleting  oh-my-cdn dependencies.\nSo, I'll cherry-pick the part of your PR instead of merging.\n. Thanks for reporting!\n. Fixed\n. I'd like to do support Vim binging.\nBut, I am poor at using Vim. Could you help me a little? We have a slack. If you're okay, send a e-mail to me and I'll send an invitation. (fluke8259@gmail.com)\nBtw, It doesn't seem to be hard by this. https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#vimapi\n. I'm currently investigating now. It seems to be related this issue.\nhttps://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/issues/4089\n. I fixed it by setting inputStyle option of Codemirror to contenteditable.\nI'm going to release a hot fix tomorrow. Please hang on a little more.\n\n. Fixed!\n. This causes another problem. It breaks most behaviors, converting Chinese chars and deleting text when writing with Japanese IME.\n. I fixed it again!\n. It should be. Thanks for your reporting!\n. Pasting images and Fullscreen mode is currently developing.\nBut, I can not understand pagination function.\nCould you explain more about this? Did you mean Marp?\n. I need more explanation how should it be realized.\nDoes it mean we should make a new format of note, like Wiki or Gitbook?\n. @mikeres0\nI and @asmsuechan talked at slack. He want pagination function only for presentation mode. \nWe might be able to use gnab/remark. But, I think we should mimic this library because it uses another markdown renderer.\n. Yes, we can provide it as an option.\n@tejado Btw, Is there a way to make powerful the extra popup?\n@mikeres0 It would be so thankful. Ask me anything whenever you stuck.\n. @tejado Sorry for my bad English. \nThe current popup should be more polished. I just thought you might have some idea to improve it because you seem to like the popup.\nBtw, as @mikeres0 , we have a slack. If you want to join us, please send me an e-mail to me! fluke8259@gmail.com\n. It should be. I'll tackle it on this week.\n. I think this is a problem of renderer. The cost of writing text is very cheap.\n. Preview will be rendered after 0.5 seconds from last edit. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/commit/0445c680baf85378599bf4f585b4df657b29bf7a\nTo tackle this more, we need to implement partial rendering.\nCheck this comment. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/116#issuecomment-254729326\n. You can quit the app by Menu > Boostnote > Quit Boostnote.\nAbout the tray icon, could you tell me it is still hidden after restarting the app?\nIf it is, please tell me any hint how to reproduce the problem.\n\nAdditionally, the scroll bar seems to be stuck over the menu. \n\nIt will be fixed the update of the next week!\n\nFor the past 2-3 versions, the application icon has disappeared on me. \n\nOkay, I'm currently investigating it. I'll tell you after I find something.\n. Yes, It is a new behavior, just like Skype, to restore app much faster.\nI'll add a jump list task to close the app from context menu of status bar.\n\nIt looks like it might be an issue with a cached older version of the app?\n\nYes, It is a behavior of https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows\nThanks for reporting. I'll try to fix it.\n. Thanks for reporting. I'm currently investigating it now. I'll inform you later.\n. It works fine on OS X. I'll inform you after I try it on Windows.\n\n\n. \n\nSorry for being late. My windows PC had been broken. So I had to reinstall OS.\nAnyway, I'm failed to reproduce this problem... Could you give me more information?\n. \u5831\u544a\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\uff01\u6765\u9031\u306b\u76f4\u3057\u305f\u3082\u306e\u304c\u53cd\u6620\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\n. \u3059\u307f\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3001\u304f\u3060\u3089\u306a\u3044\u30d0\u30b0\u3067\u3057\u305f\u3002 https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/commit/b906db3b24648f7c20fa7a863c3c11b6dddada48\n\u53cd\u6620\u3055\u308c\u308b\u306e\u306f\u4eca\u9031\u672b\u9803\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\uff01\n. @tejado It is not included v0.7.2. You might confusing because Github shows all commits by its creation time, not by which branch it committed.\nCheck this. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/commits/v0.7.2\n\n@mikeres0 Sorry for my late reviewing. \nCheck this commit. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/commit/381b7d85f49ceaf0f8ef1071abe03162e6f011c1\n- Conditional Operator should not be used when returning Boolean.\n- No ==. Only obj == null is allowed to check null || undefined.\n\nhttps://github.com/feross/standard\n. I forgot to fix it. Thank you so much!\n. Thanks again! How about to join our slack? We could talk much actively!\n. @tejado Also, is it okay to add you to contributors section of readme.md?\n. It looks great! Thanks for your support.\n. Could you install electron-prebuilt again?\n\nelectron ./index.js --hot of npm run hot uses ./node_modules/.bin/electron.\nIf it called directly, it will use global installation.\nI'm not sure, but I think the local electron-prebuilt might not be installed properly.\n. We will move electron somewhen instead of electron-prebuilt. The current build has a problem when clicking iframe. (To prevent XSS problem, Boostnote uses a sandboxed iframe for markdown preview)\nBut, as long as you don't forget to npm install after the dependencies changed, it won't bother you anymore.\n. Thanks for contributing! Is it okay to merge now?\n. Thanks. @bkjohnson \nTo others\nWe will bring this back after the counter plan for shortcut without menu is ready.\natom-keymap and electron-localshortcut would be the valid options.\n. I'll start fixing this on this weekend. Sorry for the late supporting.\nCurrently, this project is not a personal project but is a company's one and I quit the company. \nSo, that's the why I've been not here for a while.\nRecently, I found many people seem to suffer from these bugs, so I'm going to fix only the bugs of this project until my previous company find the new maintainer. \nBut, Don't be worry about my absence. My previous company said they already found some candidates for the new maintainer.. @ehhc @nikhiljha At that moment, we were very conservative. The fully re-written app, which probably be released this summer, will be published under MIT. :). If we use JSON rather than CSON, we could fix this quite easily. But, we have to prepare data migration. It is very hard to manage. So I still have no idea how can I deal with this problem.. @mhpreiman The bug has been reported already.. @chansey97 We discarded it. #1497 But, we're going to bring it back. #1503 . > Is there a way to jump to the next highlighted search keywords in the markdown editor search?\nThere isn't. We need to implement it. Could you create a new issue about this? Then, we could track \n the progress and introduce it much faster.. @yahyavi Thanks!. @xxdavid \nSorry for being late. I'll review this on this weekend and release within the next week.. @jowj I assume your data is corrupted by some reason. Could you take a screenshot of console? You can open it by pressing Cmd + Alt + I, just same as Chrome.. @dotpyfe Which version were you using before updating?. I think I have to close this issue although it is very critical. Lots of cases, I've seen, are quite different between users.\n@baegmon Could you create another issue and tell us which version you'd used?. @abbaspour Yes, it is broken for now since we introduce sanitization. If you want to use it, you have to disable sanitization.. @vangourd I'm going to close this issue. If you think pihentagy's answer isn't enough, let me know! \ud83d\ude04 . @StormBurpee I close the pr because you're absent. If you read this, it's fine to continue working.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1972\nAnyone who read this comment, feel free to fork the pr and continue the work.\nAnd, don't forget to press start work button on Issuehunt to get $60. \ud83d\ude04  \ud83d\ude04 . @CTrauma \nThis PR is not possible to review for us because it contains more than one thing.\nCould you submit split pull requests?. @RoyiAvital Nope. It is moved to #1470 . @towfiqi \nWe're going to do. Check https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1536. The problem has been identified. This will be fixed soon.. This problem still exists... I'm still investigating.\nIt seems there are two bugs. The identified one has been fixed but updater still doesn't work.\n. Fixed. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1393\nYou should install v0.8.20 manually because the updater of v0.8.19 is still broken. Sorry for making you inconvenience.. Fixed!. @wAuner Please open another issue. The above problem was for Windows.. Which OS are you using?. @nlopin\n1. I think we can insert style into <head> element of html file.\n2. We can't. The user must install their custom font to each machine.\n(I think we should provide a proper instruction, how to install the default font, Lato.). @nlopin It makes sense. I've realized now that it is just like what Chrome does.\nYea, we should export multiple files, style sheet, images and any other static stuff, including fonts if url is available.. @nlopin ping.. @nlopin ping.. @nlopin Great work! \ud83d\udc4d I'll review this tomorrow!. Now we need to implement UI. I'm going to create another PR against this branch about tomorrow. Let me know if you want to finish it by yourself!. @nlopin sorry for my late answer. Everything looks great. I'll merge this today!. I found a problem.\n\nStyling of task list seems to be broken after exporting as html. I'm investigating now.\n. Merged!. @nlopin Could you create another PR? I can review it now!. This isn't a duplicated issue. We will discuss this.. @maxart2007 Let's check it every day rather than every hour. How do you think?. Fixed. Now we check the update everyday rather than every hour.. We're going to provide it a little different way.\nActually we can do it now. But, the client app won't detect any changes made by others. So, the user should refresh the app page to grab the changes.. This happens when closing app. We'll fix this problem soon. See #1396 for more information.. Fixed!. Looks good to me.\n@kazup01 Please check it works properly.. It is definitely nice to have. But I'm going to bring this after Boostnote renewed.. @ericchang00 It should be nice to have. Could you create an issue for it?. @tewe It is not possible for now. How about you to try to implement it?. Fixed!. Could you share the content that you've imported? As long as I know, the app should use the content for the title of note.. Sorry for the missing stuff. We'll fix it within the next week! \ud83d\ude04  \ud83d\ude04 \n\uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4!!. Seems your data is corrupted by some reasons. Could you open devtool and attach a screenshot of the error?\nBtw, you can download the previous version from the below link.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/boost-releases/releases/tag/v0.8.19\n(Don't restart the app because it will be updated). > get the latest release by fetching: https://api.github.com/repos/BoostIO/Boostnote/releases/latest\nWe can do it from here. https://api.github.com/repos/BoostIO/boost-releases/releases/latest\nBut I'm afraid that its body has too much information.. Fixing #1388 is quite simple. Showing the body of a release is not that simple. We have to decide where to show it.(Visual design issue). It sounds great. Where do you think we should put the TOC? Do you have any example?. Interesting!\nThis is quite similar to #1396. Thanks for reporting.. @pmood Thanks for the reporting. It looks very critical. We will fix this soon.. @saurovh @jorgeyp @YaoQ Does it still happen?. @Matts966  Could you tell me your versions of Node.js and NPM?. You don't have to do. Because the development environment of boostnote is too old. We are using v6.9.2 for now.\nI'm going to fix it but it should take long time.. @cyalins  It looks great! Thank you so much!. @frederik-elwert I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 now and it works fine. Which version of installer are you using? Some .deb files of previous versions might be broken because I've made some mistake. But, the installer of the latest version should work fine.. Your code looks good.\nWhich OSs have been tested? And, could you update readme.md about this?. Ok, I just want you to check that you've tested it on Linux. It sounds fine.\nCould you disable this feature on macOS? It doesn't seem to work on macOS.\nYou can do it like the below.\njs\nif (process.platform !== 'darwin') {\n}\nAnd, you can ignore the error from our CI. We don't support the current stable version, v9.x, yet.. And I assume portable app is not compatible with auto update and installer.\nHow are you going to install the app on Windows?\nI assume we have to disable auto update too.. Close this PR until you come back. @CTrauma . Fixed.. @Paalon Please ignore CI failing. We don't support the current stable version of Node.js yet.. GJ!!:+1: I'll review this by tomorrow. How about to make another pull request against Codemirror to fix this problem?. Let's discuss here!!\n@vvs @dick-ey @adamellsworth @viggin543 @hosiken @adamellsworth \nCould you tell us which OS you are using?\nWe discarded it because:\n1. The usage statistics said that it was rarely used.\nWe discard it because the data told us that it was quite rarely used.(about less than 10 times for a day while note creation happened thousands times)\n\nOf course, some of you might disable our usage tracking!\n\n2. It was too buggy.\nThere was a critical bug on Windows and Linux when quitting the app. And, it makes auto updating fragile.\nAnyway,  I'm willing to roll back the feature if lots of people wanted.. We have another option, making the popup optional. So some users like you can enable it and take the risk from it.. I don't mind if you guys telemetry. \ud83d\ude04Anyway, I'll try to fix it and land it in this weekend.. How about to use <> rather than using invisible character?\n<https://github.com> should be rendered as a link like the below.\nhttps://github.com\n. Let's discuss this on #1623.. @pat-s \nWhat's the difference between gruntfile-snap.js and grundtfile.js ?. @pat-s And, could you tell me what's the differences between gruntfile-snap.js and gruntfile.js?. If you have no time to fix, I'll try to do it in this weekend.. @pat-s I'm sorry for the delaying...Could you give me some more specific instruction?. Which version did you download?. Please re-open this if the problem still happens again after downloading v0.9.x(or later).. @tito You're right. We need both of them.\nI'll tackle this too. But, don't hesitate to try. I assume my work should be very experimental. So there should undergo trial and error a lot.\n\nFYI, I'm going to use pouchDB the renewed app, which might become Boostnote Lite(?).  So I can only focus on UI/UX to resolve conflicts.. @gramster Hmm.. there was a problem while merging lots of PRs. Could you create an issue about this?. @forestail Could you create another pull request with the proper changes?\n\nPlease try git cherry-pick! https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick. It seems to be a bug of codemirror. I'll dig it.. @Redsandro Please ignore the test. It fails randomly. I'll fix it later.. @Redsandro Which OSs did you test?. The tray icon is not visible on macOS.\nIdle :\n\nFocused :\n\n. Don't worry! I have one with macOS. I'll fix it today. \ud83d\ude04 . @Redsandro Sorry, I've forgotten to review this... I'll do it in this weekend. \ud83d\ude4f \ud83d\ude4f . @N2ITN Could you tell us which shortcuts don't work?. I would like to learn the new thing. But, I've never heard about it.\nCould you describe more about it?. Hmm, there are still no answer. I'll investigate this by myself.. I've asked a super minor fix. If you don't have a time to fix this, I'll do it tomorrow!. Could you describe it more? It should be nice if you could show some examples.. @lepinekong Could you try again after deleting C:\\Users\\moi\\AppData\\Local\\boost directory and any files in it?. @lepinekong Glad to hear that! \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 . Fixed by #1558.. @pfftdammitchris I'm not the one who is asked, but I like this. \ud83d\udc4d . > I was thinking, maybe, to truncate at a certain length (maybe 12-15?) while concat-ing with three dots (...) when over the length\nIt can be done with text-overflow: ellipsis;. https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_text-overflow\n\nallowing the user to hover over it to display a small popup of the full length on top of it\n\nYou can use title attribute for quick solution although it looks a little ugly.\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_global_title\n\nI think that is better than the gray dull coloring\n\nI don't mind if there are options to choose, but I like the gray dull coloring. It looks clean and calm. \ud83d\ude0c \ud83d\ude0c . Yea, we should do it definitely.\nThe codebase is too old because I've just started using React and Node.js at that time.. I'll do it now. Sorry for making you wait.. Definitely!! Thanks for reporting. \ud83d\ude02  I'm gonna fix it now!\nBoostlog is our new prototype app. It will be open-sourced too somewhen. :). 1. That was my fault. \ud83d\ude22  \ud83d\ude22  I'd been taking a long vacation while this lunar new year.(It is holiday in Korea.)\n2. Not only the React, we have to upgrade webpack and other dependencies. I'm going to deal with it. Check this too. #1561\n3. We are going to use class property. As long as I know, It is the most correct answer.. @pfftdammitchris I'm appreciating your contributions too. Let me know whenever you have something to ask! \ud83d\ude04 \ud83d\ude04 \ud83d\ude04 . Haha..! our page has been completely renewed. Thanks for your reporting!\nIf you want give more feedback to us, visit here!\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostlog-feedback/issues. We've already had! \n\n. We probably want similar things for Ghost and any other blogging platform. Let us think this for several days.. We're gonna accpet this and ship to the next version. \ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf89 \nThanks for your contribution!!. @lurong-hkg It will be in v0.11. \ud83d\udc4d . @lurong-hkg Could you add some documentation about authentication? Or some kind of tooltip in Blog tab should be nice.\nIf you can afford to do, let me know and create another PR! \ud83d\ude04 . And we should figure out how we can send images in note.. I mean local images. :smile: Storage of boostnote can persist images locally! So, we need to check the url of images and upload it to wordpress if it start with file://..... @nlopin Should we wait for refactoring?. Thanks!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f . Absolutely. \ud83d\ude04 . I'm going to publish v0.11.0 on this weekend. Sorry for making you wait. \ud83d\ude22 . \n\nHmm... that's weird. It works fine for me too. I'm using macOS 10.13.3 too.. @RomanKlopsch If you don't mind, you can submit a PR with your solution! So, we can review and merge it. How about it? \ud83d\ude04 . I'll gladly wait for it! \u2764\ufe0f \u2764\ufe0f . It is not possible for now. To do it, you have to build the app by yourself.. I think we can do it. \ud83d\udc4d . Could you attach some screenshots from console? \nThere should be some error messages. You can open it with cmd + alt + i.. @vandella1 The attachment is not available on Github. Could you visit this issue page and write a comment with the image again?. @AlexisEspinosaGayosso Could you send me a screenshot of console? You probably could see the error message from there.. @vnadella1 Seems one of your note has been corrupted by some reason. So, all you have to do is open the cson file and check what happens there and fix it. If the file is empty, it should be safe to delete the file.. I think this is not an issue of Boostnote. There should be something, not boostnote, keep making corrupted files.. @AlexisEspinosaGayosso I assume your case is different. It seems there is some problem when saving a note as a file. The error message, uploaded by @vnadella1, is definitely caused by malformed cson file which our cson parser couldn't understand.. > In my case I do not have error messages and not corrupted files.\n@vnadella1 AlexisEspinosaGayosso said he didn't get any error message. So, I thought it is a different issue.. @AlexisEspinosaGayosso Your issue is different. Please create another issue and submit the error message from dev tool. Without it, we never know what makes this problem.. @vnadella1 Let us know if you still have the problem after updating v0.11.4.. It is not a spec of Markdown. But, you can still use HTML.\ncaption:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure\nalign center:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/ko/docs/Web/HTML/Element/center. This sounds critical. I'll fix it asap.. Fixed. Please download again. https://github.com/BoostIO/boost-releases/releases/download/v0.10.0/boostnote_0.10.0_amd64.deb. Duplicated!\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1588. I couldn't understand what the problem is. Why do you need to delete the file?. What's the meaning of documents process is complete?. Sounds like it is not a problem of Boostnote. \ud83e\udd14 \ud83e\udd14 . Let us know if the bug still exists.. I assume there is some error. Could you share the error message? You can see it from devtool.(You can open it with Cmd + Alt + I.. Could you click the error with 7d78~~.cson file and take a screenshot again?. It seems your note is including weird character which our cson parser can not parse. If you don't mind, could you send me the file so I can fix? rokt33r@boostio.co. Hmm.. we need more clue. Which version did you use before updating? And, do you know what kind of notes disappeared?. And, could you delete the empty file? It might the error causes to stop loading all notes.. I assume that is the problem. Let me know if you can not still find the notes.. Glad to hear that!! \ud83d\ude04 . I surprise that yahoo is still using EUC-JP... \ud83d\ude31 \ud83d\ude31 \ud83d\ude31 Thanks for your contribution.. Hmm.. I assume we have to use something like https://github.com/sindresorhus/filenamify to generate file name.. Great work!. We're gonna revive it. Check #1503. Looks awesome!! \ud83d\ude0e \ud83d\ude0e \ud83d\ude0e . @WeijianXu It seems the fonts doesn't support italic. How about to change font?. I'm going to close this issue. If you still have the problem after changing the font, let me know to fix it.. Why do you need it? I think we have to ban <script> to prevent XSS attack.. Hmm.. so you need more than markdown.\n\nis that this could be an embedded apache/node.js server for local (localhost / http://127.0.0.1/)\n\nI'm also thinking about this. I think our app could serve anything what we need, then lots of problem can be prevented by default.(As long as I know, BrowserWindow stops exposing electron and require stuff if its URL is starting with http://.....\nBut, I'm afraid that we probably be needed to re-write almost everything. Not only a simple webserver, we probably need web socket server to replace ipc.\n. Absolutely. I agree with you.. Funny. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  I think it is because that we forgot to put <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> when exporting it.\nCould you check again after put the meta tag to the exported html file?. @thedavidgay Thank you for the contribution!. You can install the fonts to your desktop and load it directly.\n\nBut, some of people probably want it to export note as a HTML page. \ud83e\udd14 \ud83e\udd14 \ud83e\udd14 . > It would be nice to disable smart-pasting functionality via settings\nWe've already had it.\n\n\nPasting anything inside a code-block should not do any sort of smart-paste functionality.\n\nIt sounds very difficult. The editor must recognize the code fences. Let's see which options do we have.. @ttdtrang Should we close #1574?. @ttdtrang Sorry for making you wait. I'm going to merge this on v0.12.0. Could you fix conflicts again?. I think I should close this. I think we should provide this in a separate app.\nLet's discuss this more in the slack! Please join!. I can not understand what the problem is. What happens if we keep using relative path for images?. I can not reproduce this behavior. Is there anyone who can reproduce?. @myxo @AlexisEspinosaGayosso Hmm that's weird. I couldn't reproduce this problem. Could you give me some more clue?\n. @forestail This doesn't work on my mac. What should I do to see the preview?\nAnd, could you fix the conflicts?. @forestail  I'll do it this weekends. Sorry for my late answer.. > What should I do to see the preview?\nI've tried it again. But, still have no idea how can I see the preview.\nIs it supposed to display when hovering the image link??\n. Close this now. Let us know when you can start working again. \ud83d\ude04 . I'd just worried about the diagram things. But, everything works smoothly except auto scrolling.\nI agree with @redsandro. Even we disable nodeIntegration of BrowserWindow, local files(file://~~) are still vulnerable.. > (1): I think no html should be allowed. If people want to e.g. embed youtube-movies, a markdown extension should be made for that. Currently, this is done by means of iframe, so this PR restricts the urls iframe is allowed to load to youtube.com. More allowed urls can be added later if they turn out to be used a lot.\nDefinitely we should do.\n\n@Rokt33r can add some extra defaults if you plead for certain tags, but I'm hoping he will merge this yesterday.\n\nThe current configuration looks good to me.\n. @Redsandro Could you fix auto scrolling again? If you don't have time to do it, I'm going to disable it temporary.\nAnyway, I'm going to release the next version on this Thursday.. Let's discuss this issue on https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1644. @emrusso \nI'm going to allow it. Please wait for v0.11.3. I'm going to release it on Friday. \ud83d\ude22 \nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1677. I've tried all of them. But, the data format are quite different between all of them.\n\nDraft.js doesn't support nested block. So, you cannot create nested list with Draft.js.\nQuill also has a different format which keep delta.\n\n\nPersonally, I don't want to choose Draft.js because it is quite buggy.(My previous company was using it. So, I'd been using Draft.js for several months.)\n\nYes, all format can be exported as HTML, but compatibility should be very fragile.\nAnd, Prosemirror is also well-written library. But, it doesn't have syntax highlight.\nBut, to be honestly, I don't want to bring any of them to Boostnote. \nExtending markdown parser and compiler is quite easy for me. But, extending a wysiwyg editor is extremely difficult. If we choose one, we probably lose customizability.\nSo, I'm going to try making another editor like Quiver. So, users can edit a note by block. It is not WYSIWYG, but I believe it could provide similar experience.\nBut, I don't want to say we won't fix this problem.\nI'm currently thinking some kind of an universal DB and app structure so any format of note can be available if the user install some plugins.\nSo, we probably create another app which supports various wysiwyg editor.. > It would be very nice to have some official plugins first, then as everything goes well, the community could come up more.\nDefinitely. \ud83d\ude0e \ud83d\ude0e \ud83d\ude0e  . We can exploit unpkg.com. I think it is quite reliable because all assets are served by official NPM server and cached permanently.\nBut, license of fonts should be a huge problem. I think we can serve fonts with open font license only.. I think providing an option to include some scripts to exported html should be enough.\n. @SiSchae Did you finished?. > Maybe @Rokt33r would love to add Korean support as well ?\nI'll do Japanese and Korean.. @SiSchae I assume we need to use English by default. But, I found it uses Albanian at the first time.\nCould you fix this?\n\n. I think so. It should be configurable.. I also think that it should be nice to have.. > f I use Dropbox, OwnCloud or SkyDrive, I am vulnerable to their security.\nHmm, I didn't notice that. Good point.\n\nWhat does that entail? Will the notes be stored natively or remotely\n\nAs long as I know, if the URL of BrowserWindow is starting from http://~~, global objects of Node.js, like require, and the local images are not available. So, I thought it should be enough.\nSo, attackers could steal some rendered notes, but they couldn't access local filesystem and shell.\n\nI think it would be best to be secure by default (limited set of safe html tags) and allow to opt-in to insecure features (broad set of tags and dangerous attributes) with a clear warning.\nFor example, an option in the app settings like so:\nOptions\n\u25fd\ufe0f \u26a0\ufe0f Allow dangerous html tags in notes\nWhen enabling, a modal pops up, where you have to confirm:\nDangerous tags\n\u26a0\ufe0f Enabling html also enables anyone with access to any of your devices or synced folders to prepare a note that takes over all your connected computers.\n\u26aa\ufe0f I understand the implications and want to enable dangerous tags anyway\n\ud83d\udd18 Nevermind, keep me safe!\n\nSounds reasonable. I agree with it.. @Redsandro Sound reasonable. I'll take care of it.. Wow, I didn't notice there are usages of Math.random. I think this is a bad practice when testing. We should pull out them somewhen.\nAnyway, great work!. Thanks!!. Could you tell me which input method(like iBus) you are using?. Is there any reason to run the app as a root?. Ok, can I close this issue?. Oops. This is because we start to sanitizing some tags. I'll make a quick fix today.. Thanks!. I'll release v0.11.2 tomorrow.. I couldn\u2019t reproduce this problem. Do you have any idea?. Hmm.... let's see if there are someone else has same problem. \ud83e\udd14 \nWe need more information.. @bimlas Thanks... I have no idea why it doesn't happen on my windows. :sob:. @bimlas I'll try it tonight. Thanks!. I'll do it now.. @jimtremblay Thanks for the answer!\n@js418 Now, you can allow it!. I'll fix this too.. Awesome!. I'll include this to v0.11.2. \ud83d\udc4d . https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline/blob/master/lib/html/pipeline/sanitization_filter.rb\nOkay, let's make same settings to the one of github. \ud83d\ude04 . If someone has another idea, let me know.. https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet\nI've tried all attacks using style attribute in the above link. But, none of them works. I assume it should be fine to allow it.. @tlwt Done. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1677. @emrusso I couldn't find any problem from style tag. @Redsandro How do you think?. > My position is the following.\n\nWe should not (have) allow(ed) style attributes in the first place\nWe should not force all people to take a security risk that some people think is unacceptable\n\nIt sounds reasonable.\ud83d\udc4d . I'm going to make everything optional today. Sorry for being late.. @Redsandro I assume there is some problem in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/browser/lib/markdown-it-sanitize-html.js\nDo you know how to fix?. Great work!! \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4d . I\u2019ll check it.. @ushell @jkbecker Are you using Cinnamon? I couldn't reproduce this problem on my Linux(Ubuntu with Unity).\nAnyway, I'm going to apply some potential fix to the next version.. Haha I assume this will fix it. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1721\nThis PR has been merged. You can check this on master branch.. It has been fixed by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1741. And, we're going to release new version in this weekend.. I agree with you. Let us know when you are ready.. Which OS are you using? We need more information.. How did you install the app?. Hmm.. I'll fix it today. I assume this happens because I've packed it on macOS. I think we have to prepare some kind of CD. \ud83d\ude2d \ud83d\ude2d . Hmm.. How can I reproduce this problem?. I see. Boostnote store volume info to LocalStorage. Hmm.. I think we have to handle the error.. Look awesome!. It's okay. I know how can I fix this.. @masa4u \nWe have to decide which shortcut keys should be used for each OS.\nOn macOS, cmd + b is quite common.(msvc also uses cmd+b on macOS).\nSo, which OS are you using?. @theFool32 \n\nThere is a button for it on the right top corner.. It has been canceled. \ud83d\ude22 . @romainwn Don't close PR! When you created a PR with a branch, you can update it by keep pushing commits to the branch.\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/. Anyway, you've done great work! \ud83d\ude04 . Could you attach a screenshot of the error message? You can found it from devtool.. Hmm...\ud83e\udd14 tell me if it happens again. I'll close this issue for now.. I'm sorry. I misunderstood. \ud83d\ude22 \nBtw, there should be some errors in the console of devtool. Could you submit a screenshot to prove that there are not any errors. I've never seen the case like this.. Yea, those are the errors what I've meant. Open those files and investigate what happened.. Sorry, I've misunderstood.. You can ignore the log. Our tests are a little noisy. \ud83d\ude09. @bimlas Check the test cases. You've changed the specification. So, there should be some conflicts.. I'd just needed more time to think. I assume you're right.\nThe reason why I should postpone merging this is that it fixes more than one thing. \ud83d\ude35 . I mean PR.. I think you could submit each fix. But, never mind, it just happened already. I'm going to merge this in this week and publish next version about this weekend.. @romainwn Could you check this?. I prefer jest. How do you think Jest?. @nlopin I appreciate your contributions. I'll gladly wait for it. \ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\udcaf . Hmm.. I think something like zen mode of vs code should be great.. Interesting!  \ud83d\ude08:+1: . Is using Alt + Enter quite common? I assume we should do same as Atom or VSCode do. If you are using one of them, let me know which keys they are using.. Then, let's use f11. Do you want to try to implement? @Jaeyo . There should be an error. Could you take a screenshot from dev tool?. @kijowski Could you create another issue? I\u2019ve never seen any error like the above. I need to know when it occurs.. Great work!. We need more description. Where are you trying to import from?. I assume we don't support it yet. But, I'm affraid how should we deal with it. \nAnd, I think the behavior must be changed if the target note is snippet note or markdown note.. I agree with you. I assume we should disable devMode by default even on development environment. It is quite annoying.\n\ndevMode https://github.com/jeresig/i18n-node-2#devmode. Awesome!. Yea, I think most things you've pointed make a sense. There are lots of things to be fixed because I'd been absent for a year. \ud83d\ude2d \ud83d\ude2d \n\nCould you help us? It should be grateful if you can contribute our project.. It's okay. If no one has time to do, I'll take care about it.\n\nCan you have a look at my proposed \"hack\"? Might it possible to merge it? Even though ugly, at least it fixes some of the issues currently present..\n\nI'm going to review it in this week.. @nlopin I think ehhc is using windows because the pathname is including back tick(`).. It seems the bug has been reported already. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1628. @SiSchae Could you review this?. Hmm.. I assume we forgot to configure webpack to include locales. \ud83d\ude22 . @nlopin Gladly. \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4d . I think we need to handle those error properly. I'll create another issue to do it.. Anyway, your issue seems to be fixed. Can I close this?. It should be false positive. We're using Squirrel.Windows to install and update our application. https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows\nI think this comment should be helpful. https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows/issues/1116#issuecomment-318980886. What is standart?. Atom editor is quite different from Codemirror. So, we have to write the plugin from the scratch.\nCould you submit the screenshot of the plugin for other people to understand easily what you need?. I think it is one of bug. Your code looks safe for me.\nFor now, our sanitization is a little broken.(Although it is pretty safe) So, if you can bear with security risk, you can disable the sanitization until we fix.. LGTM! \u4e45\u3057\u3076\u308a\u3067\u3059\uff01. It should be same to #1679 \nMore than a year ago, I'd been using cinnamon too. At that moment, some people asked me to make the app hide, rather than quit itself, when its window closed. I assume this sounded reasonable because we can easily unhide it from the dock of cinnamon, just like the dock of macOS.\nBut, this is old story. So, do you want to make the app quit ASAP when you close its window, Right?\n@jkbecker @ushell How do you think?\nIf you guys like it, I'll re-deploy the fixed version on next week.. > but this is not true for Linux (at least none distro that I've ever used).\nOkay, let's make it simple. Do you want to try to fix this? Modifying a single line should be enough.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/lib/main-window.js#L43 . If you don't have time to do, I'll fix it in this week anyway. Just let me know if you could afford.. I'm going to publish this in this weekend. :smile:. Absolutely. \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4d Do you want to try to implement it?. Awesome! \ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\ude07 . I like this feature. And, I want to suggest a little layout change.\nCurrent layout:\n```\nTags\n\u2193alphabetically\na\nb\n```\nSuggestion:\n```\nTags \u2193alphabetically\na\nb\n```\nHow do you think?. What kind of buttons are you going to add for tags?. Thanks for reporting!. > Is there a public TODO list\nThere isn't. We'd had it, but it has been abandoned since I left this project. So, I think we need one.\n\nMaybe Slack seems to be alive...\n\nYes, we can use slack.. I think we should add another window menu for linux and windows.. @yougotwill Could you fix it?. @romainwn ping.. I'll wait for it gladly.. @yougotwill I don't think so. Just update this branch. And I agree changing shortcut key for top:focus-search.. LGTM! \ud83d\udc4d . It seems you moved the directory without unlink.\nPlease run localStorage.clear() in the console and restart the app. :). And, I assume we have to handle this error.. @chufnagel @Karrade7 \nEnter localStorage.clear() to the console and refresh the app.. Did you refresh the app?. I'm thinking this might be too much.. I've changed my mind. It should be fine.\nAnd, I think we have to prepare some instruction which introduce several searching methods of Boostnote.. @tbfisher \nThe error message isn't helpful. It might be caused by huge folder.\nCould you create a new folder with few notes and try exporting it again?. @frankkanis Thanks for the reporting. Now, we can fix this. \ud83d\udc4d . Could you tell me where can I find the icon? (Although I'm an owner of this project now, I'd been absent this project for a year.). You're right. We should fix this. \ud83d\udcaf . It seems some processes of boostnote still alive. Could you try it again after restarting your pc?. Could you discard everything in C:\\Users\\Joel\\AppData\\Local\\boost and reinstall the app again?\nBtw, I'd very rarely experienced the problem with bad internet connection.. Thanks for the reporting. I'll fix it in this week.. @cignoir Let us know if you have still problem. \ud83d\ude04 \n@bimlas Thanks for the answer!. I agree with you. Markdown actually isn't supposed to be always rendered. So, I've thought that some one probably do not want to see preview at all.. But, we need to think how should we present the option as UI.. @Asitis \nI think this should be enough. How do you think?\n\n@hidaiy \nPlease stop working this for now. We're going to cancel the deposit of this issue. I think this issue must be discussed more.. @hidaiy I'm sorry. \ud83d\ude22. @Asitis @ehhc\nHmm, now I've changed my mind. I think disabling preview option is quite reasonable when thinking the origin of Markdown. It's designed to present some document format in plain text.\n@hidaiy \nYou can start to work it again. But, I think we have to append this option to Switch to Preview, in the above screenshot.. Sorry for late answer. Could you tell me the length of your note? I assume your note probably very long. Anyway, I'm going to deal with it soon.. I think we have to introduce throttled rendering. After implementing sanitization, rendering speed becomes quite slow.\nDon't close this issue until we implement it.. @NiceKingWei I'm gonna fix it in this weekend. \ud83d\ude04 . > External CSS are also not a good solution\nI agree with it.. Ah, sorry, I misunderstand it.\nExternal CSS is totally fine.. @tatoosh I think external assets are completely fine. Why do you think that we should make huge html?. I see, but we cannot include fonts. Anyway, I agree with it if it is optional.. I mean exporting a single html file(with inline script and inline style).. I agree that we don't need cloud stuff as long as we just want to include images.. Hmm... how can the app know which fonts available?. @bimlas I'll take care of it. \ud83d\ude04 . There might be some errors. Could you attach some screenshots of devtool when the problem occurs?. You can find it from menu. If you are using mac, press cmd + alt + I.. @sosukesuzuki Could you fix this?. While I absent for a year, other moderators have been banned from reddit. And, @asmsuechan has left our project. :sob:\nDo you know what can I do?\n. > There is a long shot way of requesting control over an abandoned subreddit. My Request is not likely to be granted, but we'll see. If it is granted, and @kazup01 or another dev reactivates their account, I will relinquish control if they want me to. My only goal is to clean up the subreddit and get it working properly again.\nI'm quite new at reddit. So, It should be grateful if we have voluntary mods.\nLet us know if you granted. And, I'll also leave a comment to your request. \ud83d\udc4d . @FistfulOfStars Cofirmed!! Thanks for the help! \u2764\ufe0f \u2764\ufe0f \u2764\ufe0f . Thanks for the reporting!. Which OS are you using?. Btw, I'm going to release it tomorrow. I'm really sorry.. > Is this the latest release you were talking about?\nYes, it is. \ud83d\ude04 \n\nhow can we install that version instead of suffering with the bugs in v 0.11.3?\n\nIf you have to wait again, you can build the app by yourself. But, it might be different between OSs. That's why I asked which OS you are using.\nAnyway, let us know if you still have problem!. I think this should be optional.. Thanks for reporting.. Did you delete it again from the trash?. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2827 will cover this issue.. Thanks for the reporting!!. For me, it looks fine. But, I want to hear more opinion.\nHow do you think? @sosukesuzuki @bimlas @nlopin @rayou . I couldn't understand what you are saying. Could you take a video? https://getkap.co. I see. This is a bug definitely. \ud83d\ude2d . @JesusPerez It is a bug, not a feature. \ud83d\ude2d . Sorry for the inconvenience. \ud83d\ude2d . Thanks for the reporting!. The most difficult part of this issue is deciding key combinations for each OS.\nSo, we need to discuss this before we introduce!  Could you give us some examples for each key combination?. It looks great! But, I agree with @bimlas. I'll merge this after deleting the first 7 lines. \ud83d\udcaf . Do the new settings persist after restarting the app? . This bug has been reported already. I'm going to fix it soon.. It is a bug and duplicated. For now, just refresh the app with Cmd + R.. I think most of your concerns sound right.\n\nWhy are the dropped files named with Math.random().toString(36).slice(-16) (CopyImages.js) instead of something more resilient like Hash(Timestamp + filename) ? Math.random() might return the same result again. Especially when not properly initialized!\n\nI agree with you. We should use crypto.randomBytes.\n\nWhy are there (at various places) different definitions of markdown-templates to include images? I\u2019ve found at least 3 without being able to figure out why they aren\u2019t at one central place and in what cases they are used\n\nCould you describe more about this?\nAnd, I'm really sorry that there are lots of crap in the code of Boostnote. The reasons I couldn't catch up the current code are:\n1. I've been absent for a year.\n2. As a company for profit we've been preparing other service. But, it doesn't mean we abandon this project. The other services help us to make Boostnote much sustainable if self. So, I think we could focus Boostnote about this summer, probably the first week of July or much earlier.\n\nWhy are there multiple definitions of the image folder path? e.g. moveNote.js:77, exportNote.js:9, copyImage.js:22 and none global definition? A global reliable definition of this constant variable is missing.\n\nYea, we should refactor them and make one reliable definition.\n\nNo documentation (e.g. JavaScript Doc) is provided. You have to guess what a method does and why it is necessary\nMy quick fix hasn\u2019t fix these issues.\n\nTBH, we've been preparing an app, which probably replace the current Boostnote app. So, lots of things will be written from the scratch and it will use Typescript.\nAnd, as my experience of typescript, JSDoc is quite redundant like the comment. So, we probably won't use it.\nBut, having api document sounds reasonable.. @ehhc Yes, it will be opensource and free!\n. You're right. We should add lots of tests. But, my time is quite limited to contribute this project. Hmm.... do you have any idea how we can distribute the tasks to other contributors?. Thanks for your effort!. I assume this probably very difficult task. Do you have any idea to implement it?. @davidmigloz Could you review this?. @rayou Could you review this?. Could you attach log files? You can find it from ~/Library/Caches/com.maisin.boost.ShipIt.. It is not possible yet. I assume it should be very difficult to implement. \ud83d\ude2d . It's a bug. Thanks for the reporting!. Thank you!. @ChristoferK Boostnote is using Codemirror and it doesn't support AppleScript syntax.\nIf you could afford, you can create codemirror language mode for AppleScript. So we can introduce it.. So, I'm close this issue for now. Let us know when CodeMirror support AppleScript!. I think it is a bug. \ud83d\ude2d Thanks for the reporting!!. Looks critical. We should replace markdown renderer fast. I think I could take on it about 2 weeks later.. Hmm.. It is a markdown note app. Why do you think it have to serve HTML page?. @kazup01 . @ZeroX-DG Wow, it looks nice!!. I agree with you. The current file name is definitely useless. \ud83e\udd14 . @ehhc I'll do it today. :). Could you close this and create another pr again? Showing diff of github seems to be broken. And, it would be nice you can fix the lint errors.. LGTM!. Same to #1857. Please close this pr and create another one.\n. I've never seen this bug before. Did you try re-install the app?. The answer of @bimlas is correct.\nI'm going to close this issue because it is out of scope for Boostnote. Let us know when CodeMirror starts supporting it!. Thanks! I'll review tomorrow.. I think content should not change after moving. But, it replaces links of attachments.. Closed this for now. I think we need to discuss this. Is it possible for you to join our slack channel?. It has been fixed and ready for being published. \ud83d\ude04  https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1873/files. Please ignore it. We're preparing some kind of bounty program.. Fixed by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2684. @yosmoc Could you enter the below link, click start work and submit the url of the pull request?\nhttps://issuehunt.io/repos/53266139/issues/1894\nThen, we could reward you with $20. :). You can ignore it. We are gathering usage data of Boostnote. It seems the app is failing to send the data. If you don't want to see any more you can disable it from the preferences.\nFYI: The usage data doesn't include any content of your notes. We just count your activities. And, we cannot specify who you are from it.. We only support languages supported by codemirror. Let us know when it starts supporting coq.. @ksqsf Hmm... I think we can make it possible if someone makes the language mode.\nhttps://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/pull/5347#issuecomment-378917584. Sounds reasonable. \ud83d\udc4d . Outstanding!! \ud83c\udf89 . Thanks for creating this issue!!. @hooklife @ChenLiZhan Thanks for the contributing \ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\udcaf . @rokt33r After merging, a sanitizing method for code fences must be replaced with this escape method for better performance. #2191 \n(this is a reminder for me). I've tested on v1.8.7 and confirmed it still doesn't work. Let's wait for the next version of electron.. @ehhc How do you think? Does it look reasonable for Windows?\nAnd, if you have spare time, could you check this work well in Windows?. @sosukesuzuki @ehhc Hmm... I was asking about the keybinding for Windows!!. @StormBurpee Please remove package-lock.json. It generates too many changes. And, could you fix the conflict?. Anyway, nice work! \ud83d\ude03 \ud83d\udcaf . Close this pr now because it seems to be abandoned. If anyone is interested in this issue, please create another one.. Anyway, it looks great first step of the feature. Nice work!. I'm going to close this issue because of the inactivity.. @yougotwill I think it's fine. Sorry for the late answer.. Interesting idea! But, I think we should provide this as a plugin.. @ehhc You're right. Local file should be opened by shell.. Fixed!. @faustomura How can we reproduce the problem?. I've fixed this. \ud83d\ude04 . This is a reported bug. I think the above answer should be enough. Let us know if you still have more questions.. I'll look around from today and the next week. (I have to go Chiana for a business trip from Thursday to Sunday.)\nI'm really sorry. I was too busy to take care of this project... But, the urgent tasks are finished. And, we're trying to find how could we make us focus on Boostnote.. @ehhc I need to know how can I reproduce the problem. Could you tell me the scenario what the PR supposes to fix?. @ehhc Please submit the pr to issuehunt to get the deposit!!\nhttps://issuehunt.io/repos/53266139/issues/2023. @ZeroX-DG Could you attach a screenshot after the fix?. Hmm @sosukesuzuki For me, it looks a problem to be fixed. I'll review this.. @ZeroX-DG How can I reproduce this problem? It works fine for me.\n\n. I'll try again.. Hmm.. mine never disappear... Do you have any clue why it doesn't happen to me? Btw, I didn't configure my scroll. I assume the reason might be that I'm running windows via Parallels.. Close this issue because the problem is suddenly gone after v0.11.7.. Reopen because it fixes other problem.. @fanrongqitiancai You can the switch timing from the preferences(Preferences->Interface).. It is already reported. And, I'm going to make it throttling. Anyway, thanks for the reporting! \ud83d\udcaf . @romerosms As I said, It can be fixed by throttling.\nhttps://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/#article-header-id-5. It should be nice to have. But, we have to prepare another space to store some metadata. \nI am actually considering to implement this on the renewed app, not the current app because the risk of migrating data is quite high.\n. @OnlineVagrant You should use a mono-spaced font to achieve it!. Like Consolas.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas. Looks good to me. I'll merge this after I release v0.11.6. \ud83d\udc4d . Yea, this is out of range. This must be provided as a plug-in. But, I like this feature. Could you join our slack?. @max-buranbaev Could you fix the conflict? I'll merge it as soon as you fix it!. @matts966 @sosukesuzuki Could you tell me the current status of this pr?. I'll look around this soon. Sorry for making you suffer...:cry:. It seems to be a bug of electron v1.8.6. We have to use Command rather than Cmd to avoid this bug.\nI'm going to release a temporary fix soon.. Sorry, I misunderstood. It seems to be a bug of Mousetrap.. I don't think this feature is useful. It must be optional. And won't be implemented to the current app.. LGTM. I'll also make another pr to correct user's config automatically.. I'm going to release the next version including this on Wednesday of the next week.. It has been fixed already. And the fixed version will be released in mid of the next week!\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2110. I agree with @modmod24. If it looks wrong, you can customize it by adding some CSS!. Fixed by #2661. I'll review this.. LGTM! It should be nice if we have a hotkey to format a content of a note.. Which node.js version did you use?. @avence12 Does it happen after restart or refresh the app? I cannot reproduce the problem.\nI'm using macOS 10.13.5 and Boostnote v0.11.7.. This has been fixed and will be released in next week. Thanks @ZeroX-DG! \ud83d\udc4d . I really want to do but, I don't have time to do it...\nIf you(or someone who see this comment) can afford to do, please join our slack and call me!. @yosmoc Sounds good. let me know if you need anything I should grant or make some account. I'll do it as soon as possible.. @yosmoc Absolutely. I'll figure out if I could invite you as a manager after I signing up Snap.. @popey Awesome! I'll try it on this weekend!. @popey Ah.. sorry. I forgot it. I'll try this weekend!! Thanks for reminding!. @popey Seems we need to use electron-builder but we don't use it.\nI'll try this later.\nhttps://github.com/electron-userland/electron-installer-snap. It is possible. How do you think which key should be set there?. Great! @StevenJL How do you think?. @piotrgajow https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2178 It is available now.. I cannot understand what's the error meaning. \ud83d\ude2d . I think we should exploit native spell checker which OS providing.\nI assume we could give a shot to this.\nhttps://github.com/atom/node-spellchecker. https://github.com/atom/node-spellchecker/blob/master/lib/spellchecker.js#L28\nWe could do it with node-spellchecker. Seems we could change it locale via environment variables.\nSo we could deal with the problem by spawning a child process with other LANG value.\n. But, F11 is a reserved keybinding of macOS!. @SubtleParesh Could you fix the conflicts and lint errors from the ci?. Thanks!!\nBut, I should ask one more thing. I don't think the history menu is that useful. It just looks confusing.\nCould you remove it? I think the arrow buttons are enough.\nAnd, why do we need .yarnclean?\n. Okay. Please ping me again when you finish! @SubtleParesh . @SubtleParesh I'm sorry for being late to response. Could you fix the conflicts again? I'm going to merge this in this week.. @SubtleParesh Awesome! I'll review in this week. Hang on a little bit more!. @SubtleParesh I found it doesn't work well with snippet notes. Could you make another pr? I found the problem after I merged so I rolled back.. I found another problem that is the shortcut has a conflict with https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2178 .\nHow do you think @enyaxu?. I cannot understand what the error message means. Could you translate it?. It looks better! Thanks!. Thanks for reporting. I'll fix it soon. It looks very critical.. Sound reasonable. How do you think, @sosukesuzuki ?. I couldn't reproduce the problem. Could you submit a gif video?. @brucezz @mrjooz @enyaxu Hmm.. I see. I'll try to fix it this week. It sounds quite problematic.. Is there anyone who could try to fix this? I still cannot reproduce the problem. So, I don't know where should I start working.... Great!. @dbjsy The fix will be shipped on the next Tuesday.. I confirmed it works on macOS.. It has been fixed already! I'm now preparing the new release including the fix!! https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2158. @yamash723 Could you check this again?. @yamash723 Thanks! Then I'll close this issue.\n@Kail0 @whr94621 If you still have this problem, please make another issue.. It's an electron issue. If it starts to support them, Boostnote also will support it.. Thanks! I'll check it works later.. Haha, yeah, we need to fix it. I assume a single line of css code, which is setting a background color, should be enough.. We still have a bug when sanitizing markdown. It is broken now. But, you can disable it!\n. @Redsandro I'm sorry. I'll check it today.. Hmm... I think we should make the behavior optional.. It should be bad for someone who is using * for making a list.. I'll rollback this feature and make it optional later.. Fixed by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2586. Please check https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2217. Close this in a flavor of https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2230/files. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2217. @patrick-iv-knowit Could you join our slack? We could discuss more in there.. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2217. Close this because it is duplicated. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2217. Please execute localStorage.clear() in the console. It seems you've used a wrong storage path. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2217. @ehhc Could you tell me what does this PR? I couldn't understand which problem is fixed by this PR.. @ehhc I see the point! It looks good to me!. Actually, we don't have it yet. It only works when the image is coming from web browser. Because we are using its URL rather than the image data.\n. @ehhc @ZeroX-DG Sorry, you guys are right. I misunderstood. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \n@heihachi88 Could you tell me which version of Windows you are using?. Could you show me the error message?. We're using codemirror now. So, if codemirror support it, we could implement it.. It works on macOS. Now, I'm checking on Windows.. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2827 will cover this issue.. > enableLiveNoteCounts: enable live count of notes in the Side Bar. (tags without any related notes have no displayed count)\nCould you tell me more what it is?. I confirmed it works fine. Sorry for being late! \ud83d\ude22 . > it is significantly slower now taking almost 2 seconds to display a note\nIt seems to be slow when opening snippet note.. @ZeroX-DG Could you help me?. I've reverted the previous PR, https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2074/files\nAnd, it seems to fix the bugs. I'll release v0.11.9-pre.2 tonight.\nYou can check it from the master branch too. I've already merged the fix.\nThank you all guys!! \u2764\ufe0f. @mikaoelitiana  Did you finish the work?. \nIt doesn't work on Windows. Is it possible for you to enable it on only macOS?\nI didn't try yet but I assume it doesn't work on linux too.. @mikaoelitiana Could you fix the conflicts?. @daiyam LGTM. Btw, it doesn't work on snippet notes. Could you fix it too?. It looks really cute! Thanks!. Alright. I changed my mind. Let's give a shot.\n@ehhc Could you fix the conflicts?. I'm going to merge this after releasing v0.11.11! Thanks for your effort!. @daiyam Could you fix the conflicts again? I'm sorry for being late.. \ud83d\ude22 . @daiyam Could you try to remove node_modules and execute yarn again? Btw, I'll test it by myself. :). Okay! And I've tested this now. It looks Awesome! \ud83d\udcaf . Close this in favor of https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2437. @daiyam I'm sorry for being late response. Could you fix the conflict?. Awesome!. Could you fix the conflicts?. @yougotwill Could you fix the conflicts?. @jacobherrington How can I reproduce this error on the current master branch?. @jacobherrington ping. @jacobherrington Could you fix the conflicts? I'm going to merge this pr before this weekend. So I can include this to the next release.. Awesome!. @ZeroX-DG @daiyam I think tests should be executed before pushing. So how do you think add pre-push hook for testing?. I agree with @nagledb 's idea. It should be presented as a plugin of markdown-it first. I'm not going to merge this until the new syntax becomes popular enough.. I've fixed it. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2746. I'll check this on Windows and Linux now.. I confirmed it works well on Windows. I'll merge and publish this fix in this weekend. @ngamradt-turner @matthew-nm. Btw sorry for being late... I'd just forgot about it... If you want something really badly, please ping me on our slack!. @ninearif I'm afraid that there are no Thai speakers in our contributors. Do you know someone who can review this pr?. Okay, I merged this anyway.. I don't use emacs but, it seems some of emacs users want to have this badly. Yeah, let's try it for now.. Awesome! Could you fix the conflicts? I'll merge this soon.. @nagledb \n\nThe HTML escaping seems unneeded since the markdown renderer already takes care of it,\n\nI don't think it is true. Markdownit doesn't sanitize anything. But, I'm okay with discarding this because most of users open the exported html on the latest browser like Chrome. So, it should be fine for now.. I'm going to merge this in the next week if there is no reviewer!. @jangtsekiang Do the changes look fine?. Awesome work! @FabioRosado Is it fine to merge now?. It will be included to the new release of this weekend! Thanks @daiyam !!. I think we should discard the current usage of react-codemirror. I don't think the module is covering all features of codemirror because it isn't updated for 2 years.\nIf there is something better in the module, we could pick the cherry.. But, we have to refactor CodeEditor component. It is too heavy. I think we split it into several classes like CodeEditorKeyBinder, CodeEditorImageDropHandler..... @daiyam Thanks!! I've also noticed this issue haha but you're so fast! \ud83e\udd47 \ud83e\udd47 \ud83e\udd47 . @FilipaDurao I'll review it on this weekends.. @GuilhermeJSilva Could you submit the url of this pr to issuehunt? Seems there are bounties on the issue.\nhttps://issuehunt.io/repos/53266139/issues/2218. I'm going to review this in this weekend.. Awesome!. Fixed by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2642. Please stop reporting. It just makes useless extra noise. It won't be fixed until there is someone who can afford to fix.. @MiloTodt Interesting that you made an empty pr to submit! haha Anyway, great job!. @daiyam I've checked this pr after merging the current master. It works fine in macOS, but doesn't work in Windows.\nThe problem is happened when the image url has query. In macOS, it just ignore query when loading image, but, in Windows, it also think query is a filename.\nUncaught Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\\....\\hash.jpg?random=query'\nCould you fix this and merge master into this pr?\nI think we can finally fix pasting image issues after merging this pr.\n. @daiyam a browser!. @daiyam Could you add test cases for url with query?. @daiyam Awesome! I think I could review this on the next Monday. Please wait a little bit more.\nBtw, I've put some money to the issue. So please submit this pr to Issuehunt. https://issuehunt.io/repos/53266139/issues/2630. @daiyam Ohno... This still does not work well in Linux.\n\nAttachment folder (\"/home/parallels/Boostnote/attachments/3981a37e-d182-4a95-b5fb-b589853323f3\") did not exist..\nIt seems file extensions are gone somewhere. And I checked the attachments folder but there were nothing.. @daiyam I dragged and dropped an image from browser in Ubuntu Linux. Then, nothing was pasted and the only thing I got is that logs..... Awesome! I'll deploy this tomorrow!\n. @richardtks I cannot confirm the problem yet. How did you reproduce the problem?. @ZeroX-DG Can you reproduce the bug?. @richardtks Thanks. I'll try again in Ubuntu. \ud83d\udc4d . @richardtks Sorry for late response. I tried it on Ubuntu v18. It works fine. Which input system are you using?. Hmm... that's weird. I'm using ibus too. Maybe should I check it with Chinese keyboard?. I'm really afraid that this change might interfere with other input system with other languages and other OSs.... Hmm... give me more time to check all of them.\n\n[ ] Windows / Chinese\n[ ] Windows / Japanese\n[ ] macOS / Chinese\n[ ] macOS / Japanese\n[ ] Ubuntu / Japanese. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2586 will cover this feature! . Sorry for closing the pr \ud83d\ude22 \ud83d\ude22 . @xvusrmqj Your comment isn't helping at all. Boostnote is an open source project. If you feel it is too slow, you could submit another pr to us. Or you could fork this repository and build it yourself. \ud83d\ude04 . @xvusrmqj I knew you're waiting this feature. But just saying Hurry up! does NEVER work. We are not going to merge this feature until all change requests are resolved. If you want to get this faster, you need to help us because Boostnote is an opensource project.. And your comments and my answers are irrelevant this pull request. So please don't leave comments in this pr anymore. If you want to discuss, please open another issue.. @Margarida-Silva Sorry for our late response.\n@camposandro Please resolve my change request. I'll merge this pr ASAP. \ud83d\ude80 . Sadly, I've just found that this pr is irrelevant to #2306. :sob::sob: It is talking about the notification not the dialog box. \n\n@camposandro @Margarida-Silva I think I have to close this pr and make another pr to solve this problem.\nI've posted new spec in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2827. If you could afford, please try this one.. Fixed by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2759. I did it! https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/releases/tag/v0.11.12. I'm actually leaning toward @ehhc's idea. Could you tell me why do we need to keep images as data uri? And do you have any examples of other apps woking like that? @daiyam. > Ctrl+V pastes only text\n\nCtrl+Shift+V pastes image, HTML or text\n\nIt sounds reasonable.\n\nShould I change the Ctrl+V's behaviour to paste images?\n\nYeah, I think we should do. \ud83d\ude22 . Closed because https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2827 covers this issue.. > I've made the following theme based on my coding theme\nIs a your custom UI theme? I cannot understand what have been changed.. Then, it should be irrelevant to this issue. But I don't mind you to submit a pr for it.. > could such scenario cause issues with data sync?\nI don't think Gdrive is a reason of the problem.\n\nIs there a temp local storage for Boostnote that I could check for missing notes?\n\nNo, there isn't... I'm really sorry about that.\n\nIt depends on which version you were using before upgrading. Only the reason I can assume is Boostnote is failing to write the notes to your disk.. @ZeroX-DG Sounds nice. \ud83d\udc4d . Fixed by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2586. @roottool I think we have to change default font rather than monkey patching inside of preview.\nCould you make another pr that changes default editor font to Consolas for Windows?\nPlease change browser/main/lib/ConfigManager.js#41\nBefore:  fontFamily: win ? 'Segoe UI' : 'Monaco, Consolas'\nAfter: fontFamily: win ? 'Consolas' : 'Monaco'\n. This won't be merged. If it works fine, I'll update my forked dependencies for security reasons.. > default in linux os\nCould you tell me specific desktop env? Each desktop env has different behavior.. Seems like I was confused by my old dirty code. LGTM now.. @ZeroX-DG I'm willing to accept any prs for the translation as long as there is no more reviewers in a week.. @ZeroX-DG It should be fixed in another pr. Please ignore it.. I made a new spec, https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2827, to resolve the issue. So I think I should close this pr. \ud83d\ude2d \nThanks for your contribution!. Fixed by #2791 . Awesome!. @ZeroX-DG I'll do it in this week. \ud83d\udc4d . @MiloTodt I found another problem with this pr.\nI copied an image again from Boostnote editor after I did copy and paste it from a web page. Then the secondly copied image's url became broken because it was still using \\ rather than flavored /. Could you fix this too?. @MiloTodt Which OS did you test?. \nI've tested this in my windows pc. It thrown this error.\nAnd, interestingly, I cannot reproduce the problem in my windows pc.. @MilleniumBlitz @wacsintegra can you try this pr?\nJust clone this branch and run yarn and yarn dev. Then you can run Boostnote in development env.. I've tried this on Windows 10 but the window size is still different after I reopen the app again. @MiloTodt Did it work on your pc?. > Boostnote Editor automatically adds an underscore into the brackets when using quotation\n\n\n[_]\n\n\nIt doesn't add underscore. It seems like syntax highlighting of codemirror.\n\nThe checkbox should be clickable in a quotation.\n\nIt's definitely a bug. @ZeroX-DG \n. We're trying to fix this now. After it fixed, I will release new version as soon as possible.. It has been fixed v0.11.15. But, sadly, you have to install it manually because the auto updater in v0.11.13 is broken too... Please download it from https://github.com/BoostIO/boost-releases/releases/tag/v0.11.15.. @daiyam @ehhc Is this pr ready? If so, I'll review it today.. @ehhc Awesome! If @daiyam responses late, I'll try to merge this pr and disable gallery temporarily.. @daiyam Okay, then I'll just merge this PR and release again without undoing gallery.. I confirmed that it works on Windows. Btw, I've tried this on macOS and it seems that both v0.11.13 and this pr don't work on macOS.(This should be other problem I think)\n@ehhc\u00a0Do you think you can fix this too?\n@ZeroX-DG\u00a0Could you check that dragging an image to editor works on Linux?\n. > are the jest-Tests (yarn jest) working on Mac?\n@ehhc Yeah it works fine.\n\n. I can confirm the bug but not that critical.\nIt seems the code editor of the current app does not use native Select All behavior. So, when editor is focused, Edit menu doesn't highlighted but it works fine.\nWhen editor is not selected, it will use the native behavior. But it seems to try to select all text of displayed UI html elements.. @ZeroX-DG I think so. \ud83d\ude04 . Awesome! I'll test this today!! \ud83d\ude04 . @ZeroX-DG I think we don't have to change our default behavior. But it would be better to add the description about it to FAQ.md. \ud83d\ude04 . We will fix this bug in this week. Hang on a little bit more. \ud83d\ude2d \ud83d\ude2d \ud83d\ude2d . I'll close this issue because the bug has been reported already.. I agree with you. It looks fine for now. Let's do it when we found other formats which should not be fixed.. Dang it! \ud83e\udd23 Thanks!. It has been fixed v0.11.15. But, sadly, you have to install it manually because the auto updater in v0.11.13 is broken too... Please download it from https://github.com/BoostIO/boost-releases/releases/tag/v0.11.15.. @Dene33 If you're using Windows, you don't have to uninstall. The installer will replace the old one.. Fixed! I've pushed directly into master.. @ehhc I need more context to understand the current situation. But the current changes in this pr look reasonable to me. URL of image should be inside of ().. I assume this makes the error go limbo. return reject(err) should be right.. onClick={onClick}\nRestoreButton does not have this. So, we can just pass onClick directly.. We don't need any configuration for Windows. neither OS X. We can just put the properties into opts without Object.assign. No need to check platform. Let's just run compile and pack directly.. It suppose to be 0.9.0. Is it right?\nAnd updating version manually is a little fragile. How about to create a script, which generate boostnote.desktop and snap/snapcraft.yaml with the version in package.json? And then, we can put the script into postversion of npm scripts so we can simply bump the app version with a single command, npm version.. I'll take care of it.. I assume we have to make remote Mockable.. Why should we check tag without #?. I think so. :). Using path.sep is not the best. Please use path.join() to concatenating path.. FYI: Sander uses mkdirp. So it can be written in a single line. \ud83d\udc83 https://github.com/Rich-Harris/sander. Why do we need fs-extra? I assume sander can do the same job.. You must not install yarn locally. Please uninstall it.. For macOS, we have to implement this to Cmd-I and Cmd-B.\nSo, we have to extract the handler and make it work depending on OS.\nLike the below:\njs\n'Cmd-I': function (cm) {\n  if (global.process.platform !== 'darwin') { return }\n  applyItalic(cm)\n},\n'Ctrl-I': function (cm) {\n  if (global.process.platform === 'darwin') { return }\n  applyItalic(cm)\n}. Same to here. Please remove this unnecessary logging. This fix doesn't work on macOS. I think we have to check which os is used. \njs\nif (global.process.platform === 'win32') {\n  file = file.replace('file:///', '')\n} else {\n  file = file.replace('file://', '')\n}\n. Let's just go with dev rather than dev-start. This should be the last request. :). Let's check note contents too. Not just check the existence of the files.. This suppose to be this.state.isBackActive. Does it make sense?. I agree with @ehhc. This feature looks good to have. But I think it should not be included in the code base of boostnote. It is almost impossible to maintain.... Why don't we make a npm module for this? And, I think we need some test for this too.. this.searchTag() seems to returns a Promise. Why do we need to create another Promise?. Same problem . Hmm... I actually agree with @ZeroX-DG. It should be terrible if users need to lose whole settings just because they set a wrong language. I'll fix this after I merging this PR.. Why do we need these props?. Don't use <details> for this section. Let's leave a plain paragraph like If you have other questions, [please create an issue][ISSUES].. Awesome!. I don't think we need to check 'ELECTRON_IS_DEV' in process.env. Just checking process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' is definitely enough. \ud83d\ude04 . Please export function directly.\nexport function updateApp() {. Fix this too.\nimport { updateApp } from 'lib/updateApp. Rollback to updateApp(). I agree with @ehhc. I'll wait until the change request resolved.. ",

    "brpaz": "finder is a very important feature for me. Hope to see it re-enabled soon :) \n. @Rokt33r sure. you can add me as contributor.\nI am using Linux Mint Cinnamon and finder seems to work fine before it was removed. but I haven't it much.\n. Great news :)\n. Nice list :)\nFor me I think to have the tags list in the sidebar with the possibility to filter is the most important.\nTogether with gist integration and \"Finder/ menubar\" improvements.\nAfter that I think can finally start using Boostnote fulltime as my primary note/ snippets app.\nKeep up the good work!\n. When i thought about the menubar, the idea was to copy the implementation of Snippets Lab.\nI was more interested on the search part, but finder have improved a lot, since then so I am not sure if its that important.\nStill some people might prefer to use the menubar instead of finder as a simpler and quicker way to search. They are a little of feature duplication with finder. I dont know.\n- https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/images/Landing/osx-1.4/assistant-new.png\n- https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/images/Landing/osx-1.4/assistant-search.png\n.

I havent add time to work on it after.. Sure.\nHere it an example\n\n. I think it would be nice to have an icon for dark themes also. The new icon wont look good on my black menubar. Maybe make possible to select if we want a light or dark icon in the settings?. Whats the status of this PR? I really miss this feature.. For the first one, yes I really missing that feature.\nAbout n\u00ba 2, I would prefer to have as it is and not mixing tags with Markdown content.. Hmm, there is no really any useful screenshots I can take. Simple, when I open boostnote, no icon is displayed on System tray, unlike windows, for example, which displays an icon with options \"toggle main\" and \"toggle finder\" or something like that.\nFor finder, I simple cant open it (hotkey does nothing).

Hi @larabih does it still occur in v0.8.0? In my environment, syntax highlight works well.\n\n. Good! Have a good Boostnote life!. How about this? If it's ok, please close this. I'll close this in under 3 days unless you react.. I could not launch Boostnote on local due to the problem.. Thanks!. Hi @Ocanamat, we cannot add our own theme easily to Boostnote because Boostnote references the default theme of codemirror directly e.g. here.\nIf you'd love to really use IdleFingers theme, there is a way only to change local app instead of throw a PR (ofcourse it's not a good way).\n\nDownload idlefingers.css e.g. this\nFind your Boostnote directory (on mac,  it's /Applications/Boostnote.app)\nCopy idlefingers.css to theme directory by the command like below:\n$ cp idlefingers.css /Applications/Boostnote.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/codemirror/theme/idlefingers.css\nConfigure the theme from Menu -> UI -> Theme\n\nThat's it.\n\n. Any questions? If nothing, please close this issue. I'll close this in under 3 days unless you react.. I checked this, snippet could not be deleted at least from v7.0.0 in my local environment. Really does it occur from v0.8.0?. Hi there! This issue is fixed by @sosukesuzuki in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/322!. This bug arises at  https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/browser/components/MarkdownPreview.js#L204\nmarkdown.render(value) returns correct (like <?php ?>) value, however it is assigned to innerHTML as html comment <!--?php ?-->.\nPerhaps, it occurs due to the settings of CodeMirror around auto completion.. This PR seems to be related with https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/205, however the bug still remains by this modification.\n\n\n. Reported by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/209. I've recognized the reason why we should use entities is for security. In this case, we don't need to care about entities because we use Boostnote in local only and also it's OSS.\nIt's trouble that special characters are displayed as encoded style. I feel it's a big issue.\n\nit should not be modified by Application.\n\nAbsolutely true.\nI'm also reluctant to be displayed encoded entities in preview. How should I correct?. > For example, '&amp;' must be displayed '&amp;' and > also must be displayed >.\nHowever in current version > is displayed as &gt; at preview code area. I think this is a bug. Probably it's correct behavior for program but incorrect for user.\nAccording to inspection of this line, <code> tag shows us > as &gt;.\nrefs: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/205#issuecomment-271130035. Understood!. I strongly feel this code display problem is one of the most important problem at all. Thus we should fix the layout collapsion as soon as possible.\nSomething went wrong (lines are reduced) like below:\n\n\n. Sure. But I'm not sure how to make it.. I'll try to make a page just place screen shots of themes in order.. @sota1235 Yes, its demo page is the most adequate for me. And the preview of code theme is ofcourse useful.. However, we need to reload boostnote after change the setting because the keymap itself isn't loaded only by just change config.editor.keyMap. Thus I put a note. Please check the sentence and layout also.\n\n. @sota1235 Thanks for your review, I try to fix them!. I added props to them however I cannot figure out why I should add keyMap to browser/finder/NoteDetail.js. I cannot write any notes on finder.. I fixed it :pray:. According to https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/206, I seem to make a mistake \ud83d\ude05 . Hi @huettenhain, do you know actually some shortcuts already exist (however they aren't customizable).\n\nDelete a note on pressed d\nCreate a note on pressed a\nEdit a note on pressed e\n\nI also think the shortcuts should be customizable.. I'm also bothered by the key map. Yes, I recognize those key maps work only on focused to note area. Perhaps we developers should discuss about the key map.. Hi @huettenhain, finally I implemented the shortcuts and be released.\n\nFocussing the search field (Ctrl+S)\nSelecting the next and previous note (Ctrl+U and Ctrl+J)\nSwitch between editor and preview (Ctrl+E)\nDeleting a note (Ctrl+Del)\n\nNext, I try to enable customizable.. To be customizable is the another issue, thus I close this issue. Please check https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/302 and comment you opinions if you're interested in customizable. Thank you!. This PR is for handling like Ctrl + A shortcut. Now we can use only 1 key by shortcut.. I'd like to change the default keymap like below:\n\ndelete a note: d to del\n\nProbably it's intuitive than current keymap. And I'd like to add a keymap which can escape from Edit mode to Preview mode. How do you think it?. I close this PR, because I implemented shortcuts to substitute in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/235.. I close this for now.. Hi @sota1235, after this PR was merged, a hot key Toggle Finder(popup) doesn't work properly at least in my environment. Can you check it?. This commit 5c7804fc40d26e3254d506d741700ed4eb3299a5 is doubtful.. In my environment, I could fix it by revert the commit. Did you try to restart electron? However the lint fails.. Oh, I also fail to fix it by revert now \ud83d\ude28. Sorry for long absence @UltimateRandom. I think so, Anyway MD input auxiliary is good for us. And Store images in folders sounds good, because \"Drag & Drop Images\" was already implemented. Umm, thanks for layout feedback, we try to discuss it.. And also I added a shortcut to change from Editor to Preview by ESC.. And I also added a shortcut Focus Search(Ctrl + S) which toggles focus to search input. I'm not sure the name is proper or not.\n\n. And I also added shortcuts to move on to the next and prior note by Ctrl + U(up) and Ctrl + J(down). Actually I want to set Ctrl + K as up by default, however it's set as a default key map on edit mode by the OS (I'm using macOS).\nI'm not sure what this setting is proper or not. Please feedback :pray:\n\n. I fixed them :pray:. I changed to use Object.assign and remove unnecessary lines.. I fixed forgotten legacy style.. Oops, should I add lib/finder-app.js to .eslintignore?. Wow! I didn't know. Thanks for this information!. Hmm\n\n. It looks so good! I'll change the code.. How about them?\n\n\n. Hi @mattjdev, now you can get v0.8.1 from http://boostnote.io#download by installer, at least in my environment (mac) I could get it in this way. If you still cannot install v0.8.1, please tell us what your environment.\nI wish to fix it as soon as possible, of course I'm trying. I remember the updater works fine on v0.7.5 to v0.8.0 thus I checked the diff between them. However no diff found between the versions in related file which I guess (browser/main/index.js and lib/main-app.js). Is it a release problem?. Hi @gen0083, thanks for your comment! Umm, I heard it's electron or electron-g-release problem from a maintainer. Exactly I've experienced to hit the bug in the past. It's probabilistic bug I guess.... It occurs on update from v0.8.1 to v0.8.2. Possibly, my commits are related with it.. I blamed the line of the bug, I recognize it is my fault :fearful:\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/lib/main-window.js#L52\n~~Perhaps if (app) or if (mainWindow) is necessary.~~ However I'm not sure it's really a correct way to fix ~~because I have no means to test/reappearance the bug~~.\nrefs: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38309240/object-has-been-destroyed-when-open-secondary-child-window-in-electron-js\nhttps://github.com/jprichardson/electron-window/issues/5#ref-issue-200877770. electron-gh-releases is used on update (https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/lib/main-app.js#L79)\nAnd install() method uses quitAndInstall(). According to the reference of quitAndInstall() (here),\n\nNote: autoUpdater.quitAndInstall() will close all application windows first and only emit before-quit event on app after that. This is different from the normal quit event sequence.\n\nThe bug occurs at before-quit event. Thus it's related with the bug.. I created quit event like below though same error still occurs.\njs\n  app.on('quit', function (e) {\n    config.set('windowsize', mainWindow.getBounds())\n  }). @sota1235 Thanks so much for your review :pray: :pray: :pray:, I'll fix them :pray: :pray: :pray:. I fixed them :pray:. Thanks for you review so much :pray: I'll handle it!. > For example, show alert message Markdown note only support!\nHi, I handled it.\n\n. @sota1235 Thanks for your review! I fixed the code you pointed :pray:. Umm, this PR fixes the bug but I feel it seems to decrease usability... I need to rethink the policy.. I found an issue that click/focus/blur events becomes invalid when the MarkdownPreview area is focused in finder even latest version . Perhaps, the cause is that iframe in MarkdownPreview grabs the events.. Sorry for long absence @spott. Do you mean Standard File importer is helpful for you?. related: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/80 . Please make sure whether the caret is active.. I noticed the caret is completely inactive on ubuntu, so I'll fix it.. And Fixed.. I feel it's just a task of @kazup01, you have all rights of changing copyright. Any reasons of this copyright?. I'll try to change the default shortcut Ctrl + E. Which key is useful? (ESC is already used in vim mode, and just in case emacs mode, I should consider its keymap). Also, Ctrl + U doesn't work in vim keymap at CodeEdit mode.. I think Ctrl + Q is the one of choices.. Sounds good! To realize that, we should discuss any designs of the trash can.. To realize trash can, I need to add a state that a note stashed or not like isTrashed to NoteItem. I'll try this.. Tasks:\n Add isTrashed state to NoteItem\n Change how to delete a note\n Add Trashbox\n Add a button to remove the cson file of note\n Change to list the notes except isTrashed: true\n Exclude the removed note on search. Hi @kazuhisya ! Thanks for your PR. We'll check it.\nBTW, travis fails now, however it's not your fault. It fails in probability. We'll fix it :pray: Thus you need to restart the job until success.. @kazuhisya Oh sorry! I'll retry instead of you if there is a next.. @kazuhisya Sorry for long absent, we're contemplating about your suggestion, linux support, for a week. However we don't have any testing environment. Therefore please wait for a moment to merge this PR. We're eager to merge it.. Hi, @justin-calleja! Thank you for your great work :+1:\n\nI don't know what's being used to track who's working on what.\n\nExactly. It's a problem. I'll manage to tell you what I do on a slack channel.\n. Next, we need to discuss what button and where it puts.. Hi @bytemybits, thanks for your report! We try to investigate.. Hi @bytemybits, thanks for your report! I confirmed this issue. We try to fix it!. Hi @PascalNegwer, thanks for your report. We've confirmed this issue by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/205. We try to fix as soon as possible.. Current status is WIP because the lock/unlock icon is shown even PREVIEW mode.. \n. I fixed them.. @kazup01 So do I.. Hi @igoradamenko, Thanks for your feedback! We'll try to confirm the icon.. Hi @pcwu, is it for prevention of broken link? If it's true, I'll try to ensure that create a directory into boostnote storage like '~/boostnote/images' and images are thrown into it on paste. Does this suit your needs?. @pcwu, I understand what you want. It's for transplantable. I feel it's so good interface. Nice suggestion!. It's been a while, but I'm working on this request now.\nref: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/818. Hi @ericsolomon, you can ask us anything here. Actually, the maintenance of any IRC is not in place so far.. And this snippet issue is a quite complicated. Thus I'm pleased that you are attempting to fix it.. Hi, @redcom. Why don't you send a PR?. @kostaldavid8 \nOccasionally, this test fails :sob:. So I retried.. Hi @kostaldavid8, thanks for your fixing! I didn't know such a useful method cm.setValue. And perhaps the tests fails because of our fault, thus we'll retry it. BTW, I have a thing to tell you. Could you remove the second commit?. I confirmed the behaviors!\n\n\n. @kostaldavid8 Oh, you need to remove the merge commit. After it, I'll merge this.. @kostaldavid8 Thanks!. Hi @pcwu, thanks for good suggestion! We're contemplating the data structure problem. However, there are some difficult problems, thus we'll take a while to modify the data structure.. related: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/286. I'm waiting to be merged https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/298.. @sota1235 I fixed them.. Hi @H-I-D, thanks for your report! Umm, we developer have confirmed this bug of the code block. We're considering to fix it as soon as possible. Please wait a while. Sorry for any inconvenience.. This Jump to Top\n\n. Alright. Done.. Hi @ftvkyo2011, thanks for your report! Actually, we've confirmed this problem and we're considering its priority is a quite low. So if you feel inconvenient so much, you should fix it and open PRs.. @ftvkyo2011 Why not, thank you. Ask me anything. I can support you.. @ftvkyo2011 Yes... I've confirmed this issue, too. And it was reported by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/294. I wanna fix it as soon as possible. However, it's a bit complicated.. Must improve: Undo UI\n\n. Escape from deletion when a user is in the trashed.\n\n. ref: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/263. It may duplicate: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/browser/main/index.js#L17:L24 However, it occurs by handleImageDrop in CodeEditor.js. Perhaps it robs the event.. @kostaldavid8 Umm... Please give me more information (e.g. OS, BN version). I expect it happens due to the order of loading events. Did you try this branch?. @kostaldavid8 Thx for informing. Perhaps it doesn't happen almost environments, I've confirmed mac/windows/ubuntu. Thus the priority of fixing it on Fedora is low, I'd like to prioritize usability on others. I'm so sorry for any inconveniences.. Hi @nishimuuu, thanks for such a great reporting! You're right, it occurs in order to its data structure which uses cson. I'm contemplating that to fix it from cson to anything else.. related: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/292. I also added to enable Ctrl+: in a word to make it bold. And I'd like to ask the shortcut key. Actually Ctrl+B is duplicated.\n\n. ## Settings\n whole settings in Menu -> UI\n own custom theme\n shortcuts\n injections of any a bit programs (by javascript into it?/ javascript file call?)\n* custom vim keybind.

Hi @lzjqsdd, does subcatalog mean subdirectory? If true, developers are not contemplating to implement it for now soon.. We've not done any special supports for WebDav. It means we're just claiming that Boostnote supports them. Thus you can use Nutstore as your WebDav even though it's not supported officially. You can ask us anything when you hit some issues according to WebDav. We'll try to support after that.. Hi, @kedzilla. Thank you for your comment! Actually, I fixed it already in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/340 and it's going to be released next update. Check it out :smile:\nYeah! Feel free to join our slack team! https://boostnote-group.slack.com/shared_invite/MTY3MzY5Mjc4ODk3LTE0OTE5Njg0NjEtNzg2MzUwOTY3NQ. Hi @titoesteves, I've heard it from many people. Then I always answer like this: I don't wanna prepare for sync (e.g. user account, encrypted data...etc). However now I'm contemplating about GitHub integration for Boostnote. I'll open an issue about it. Please comment anything you think if you're interested.. Hi, @Aivean. Thanks for your feedback. Have you ever tried ever2boost? I assume the data migration or sync from Evernote on local is complicated. But it you say is absolutely true, so I'll try it.. Hi @Gansgar, this feature seems so nice. But I feel the design is not good enough. So I'll try to improve the design after merging this PR.. Hi @Gansgar, your correction is so nice (especially this)! But there are some missing parts. 1: the design of list is broken. 2: the design of TOC is not good enough. But it's OK. I'm going to correct it \ud83d\ude46. \n1\n. I'm fixing in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/316.. Hi, @Gansgar. I removed markdown-it-toc-and-anchor because it has a bug https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/343. I'll revert it after I fix the bug. I'm sorry!. https://github.com/medfreeman/markdown-it-toc-and-anchor/pull/34\nThis bug.. Hi, @fengshens. What's going on? Perhaps this issue is a problem of the font setting. You need to change the font to fix it.. I close because of no reaction.. Hi @chantlong, please paste a screen shot.\nIn my environment, it's displayed like this below.\n\nIs it same? If it so, I don't think it's too big.. @chantlong, I see. I'll try to decrease the size if you want.. Hi @chantlong, is it attractive? (This is a @kazup01's awesome work!)\n\n. Hi there. It's as same as https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/288, not https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/201.. Hi @simiula, thank you for your reporting. Could you paste a screenshot? And let me know what your environments?. What's going on @simiula?. @simiula I'll close this issue within three days if you won't reply.. Hi @sota1235, it does not work at least in my environment. the way how to test is below:\n\nAdd line let a = 1\nRun npm run lint\n\nHowever, nothing happens.. An example of ~/.boostnoterc\n```\n{\n  \"editor\": {\n    \"keyMap\": \"vim\",\n    \"theme\": \"railscasts\"\n  },\n  \"execs\": [\n    \"CodeMirror.Vim.map('jj', '', 'insert')\"\n  ]\n}\n```\nChanged. Finally, I deleted RcParser.exec for now. Currently, assumed .boostnoterc is:\n{\n  \"editor\": {\n    \"keyMap\": \"vim\",\n    \"theme\": \"railscasts\"\n  }\n}\nIt just overrides settings in Menu.. Close once ref: https://github.com/asmsuechan/Boostnote/pull/7. Waste.. Hi @DanielSundberg, that Finder was created for searching snippets, it means you need to use this (below) if you'd like to search for the content of notes by words.\n\nActually, there is a shortcut for Focus Search by Ctrl-s on the main window.. @sosukesuzuki cool! LGTM!. Hi @VoLuong, actually, it occurs regardless of language. To avoid this, you should put any #, ##, ### or something at the first row in your note for now.. Hi @VoLuong, @sosukesuzuki solved this issue!. Alright. Done.. @GaryFurash  I'm going to try fixing it in a few days.. @GaryFurash Well, it seems to work fine in my environment (master branch on windows 10). Please open a new issue with screenshots.. @tacchan7412 Thanks for reporting. I cannot reproduce this issue, could you paste any screenshots (with opening developer tool)?. @tacchan7412 Mostly, this bug happens when something is wrong in boostnote.json. But I cannot reproduce this bug. Do you mind if you show me your storage? Probably it's located at ~/Boostnote, I want to know the content of boostnote.json and the names of .cson files.. @tacchan7412 I guess it's a bug depends on the content of the note. Because your case is similar to https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/300. Could you move the latest note to somewhere (e.g. ~/)?. @tacchan7412 Umm, what's happening if you rename the folder?\nBecause I suggested you had written a word which brakes the application as same as https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/300. (It's obviously bad...). @tacchan7412 \"folder\" means your local folder mounted to Boostnote, in this case, ~/Boostnote. Could you change ~/Boostnote to ~/Boostnote_back or something?. Hi @jasondavis, thanks for great opinions! It makes me happy so much :smile: Yes, they are my opinions below:\n\nNew Dark Theme\nI'm trying Eagle now because I didn't know it. I feel it has very sophisticated UI/UX. I'd like to use as a reference. Thanks for informing!\nFile Export as HTML file and multiple files as a ZIP file\nYes, I also want a feature Export as HTML. I'll try to implement it \ud83d\udc4d. And to export multiple files sounds good. I'll try to implement it too.\nMarkdown BBCode Style Button Bar\nActually, I don't like BBCode Style Button Bar. Perhaps it won't be added by me in Boostnote.\nImage Upload\nIs this like https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/293? Regarding a button, I'll consider.\nTag Menu in Sidebar to load list of Notes with that Tag\n\nThanks for using Boostnote! I appreciate your continued support!. I can do my best with that voice \ud83d\udcaf.\nI think the thought of Code Playgrounds is far from Boostnote. I'd like to keep the simplicity in Boostnote. Thus, in my opinion, I don't want to implement it because it makes Boostnote more complex. I want to hear another opinion from @kazup01.. \n\nAlso, I added a tooltip for the LockButton.. I suppose the color of the lock is not wrong. The color of the trash can is wrong. Because the color of buttons in dark theme is set at https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/browser/styles/index.styl#L158:L166. It means the + button for creating a new note and the lock button have the same color. On the other hand, the icon of the trash can is made of svg. Totally different.\n\n. Actually, the behavior is correct for electron. And you, check them  https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7817, https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/349.. Hi @VoLuong, thanks for informing. But actually, I know it already. It is reported https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/205 and https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/294. I'm trying to fix although this is a quite complicated. So perhaps it takes a while to solve this problem perfectly. Sorry for inconvenient :fearful:. Hi @tracker1, I've heard it from many people (https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/179, https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/41). So I'll implement it as soon as possible.. Hi @tracker1, I think it sounds great, too. And I've heard from many people like https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/55. Please wait a while to get any mobile app because I'd like to improve desktop app first and I'm not familiar with development of mobile app.. This is a bad layout for the snippet.\n\n. # Design Problem\nWhere should I put the link of the note to avoid that layout corruption in the snippet? I write my ideas. Any ideas?\nSlide the hash in snippet\nJust I slide the div 240px. But actually, it's a little complicated because of this override https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/browser/main/Detail/SnippetNoteDetail.js#L583:L605.\n\nShare button\nThis button has a lot of scalability e.g. Share in Evernote, Share in Slack, etc.\n\nI want not to implement it in this PR. Because I just want to add the feature of link for jumping note to note.. Close this PR because one of the specifications is changed. I'm going to create a share button mentioned in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/336#issuecomment-292655545.. Hi @klauscfhq! Thanks for your PR. Could you remove the variable you deleted? https://travis-ci.org/BoostIO/Boostnote/jobs/212747642\nTravis says error  'showMenu' is assigned a value but never used  no-unused-vars.\nI'd say it's a good feature. But I'd like to ask other opinions from other members.. Actually, I don't make sense this code @klauscfhq removed: var showMenu = process.platform !== 'win32'.\nAnd I dug commits, I found this PR: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/150. However, I don't have any ideas why he added this because it behaves only on mac thus it's useless. From these, I want to make a decision that it's his mistake to use ternary operator.. And also I handled <?php issue reported by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/275 and https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/205 by the second commit.\n\n\n(Forgive me \ud83d\ude1d, I made a mistake to declare the variable a in the PHP code because I'm not familiar with PHP). Until the second commit, KaTeX didn't work well. But now after third commit, it works well.\n\n\n. I fixed that bug, cut into a helper, and also added tests.\n\n. close this once.. Hi, @Kajiyu! I've heard it from a lot of people https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/133#issuecomment-287870588, https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/52, and https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/51. I also want it, but it's quite complicated. Perhaps it takes a while. Could you implement it?. you don't need to build, could you run these commands in 2 terminals?\n$ npm run webpack\n$ npm run hot. Debug it \ud83d\ude03 At least current master, Boostnote works well. I assume it's because of markdown-pdf. . An error occurs at this line, this is a node module which dependents with markdown-pdf (refs: https://github.com/alanshaw/markdown-pdf/blob/master/index.js#L8).. @Kajiyu What's going on?. @Gernatch Thanks for the comment. I try to implement it.. @Kajiyu As also written above, this feature request is duplicated. If you won't response in a day, I'll close this issue.. I close because of no reaction.. LGTM. Hi, @db2k, @VoLuong and @huettenhain. Thanks for your opinion. Yes, the preview theme is not customizable for now. I would say I don't need to change the default theme as same as GitHub.\n\nto allow the user to create their own theme\n\nTrue, I think so it may be useful and should be customizable. Actually, I'm attempting to implement it by ~/.boostnoterc https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/302. What do you think it?. @redcom Thank you so much for your PR! Could you separate commits let to const and the bug fix?. According to this comment https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/288#issuecomment-288373268, do you still fail to run this electron app?. \n. Did you run npm install?. @redcom Thanks so much for fixing! It almost behaves correct, but I find an error when I delete the rightmost tab.\n\nSnippetNoteDetail.js?64bd:267 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'reload' of undefined. Thank you!. @redcom This works fine. Thank you! I use Gyazo to capture my screen :smile: It can take at most 6 sec.\nBTW, you don't need to combine your commits into one. Because it's trouble when I rebase your branch.. I assume this is more readable.\ndeleteSnippetByIndex (index) {\n    const snippets = this.state.note.snippets.slice()\n    snippets.splice(index, 1)\n    const note = Object.assign({}, this.state.note, {snippets})\n    const snippetIndex = this.state.snippetIndex >= snippets.length\n      ? snippets.length - 1\n      : this.state.snippetIndex\n    this.setState({ note, snippetIndex }, () => {\n      this.save()\n      this.refs['code-' + this.state.snippetIndex].reload()\n    })\n  }. Cool! LGTM. Do anyone have any ideas to highlight the matched words?. @huettenhain absolutely true. Does it mean like this?\n\n. I assume it's not good. So I close this PR.. @huettenhain No problem :smile: Because I'd like to improve the search like that picture.. @Hunlongyu Thank you so much for your cooperation! Could you rebase your branch? It is too old :scream: And now, the contents is modified.. I'll close this PR because you opened new one.. @Hunlongyu Thanks for your translation! But sorry, could you remove except readme-zh-cn.md?. Hi, @Hunlongyu. What's going on?. @Hunlongyu No problem! Thank you for replying :smile:. Hi @Hunlongyu, you need to restart the electron app for reflection the changes when you change a code in lib/main-menu.js.. The reason for using concurrently instead of npm-run-all here is because it is easy to remove and I don't want to add such commands below for only 1 command: dev:webpack and dev:hot.. @Hastegan Sorry for my late review. I checked this PR works fine. Thanks for your refactoring!. Hi, @George35mk. Could you explain this issue more explicit? I'm having trouble grasping the main point you want to convey.. I removed the Ctrl - B shortcut. Probably this issue won't happen after next release.. Hi, @George35mk. Could you explain this issue more explicit?. @George35mk Do you mean like this?\n\n. No. I cannot implement that right click. Because right click already has a feature.\n\n. Hey... please don't quarrel.... Oh, I got it!\n\n. @codingmatty Thank you for your opinion :smile: We need to consider it before we try to implement our own emojis. But Boostnote works at completely local. So I assume It's never very slow even if there are a lot of PNG emojis in a note.. Hi, @UnR34L. Check this: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/325. And I'll try to add bulk importer.. Duplicated. Hi @haxpor, did you check https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/docs/build.md? I recommend you to use npm run dev-start insted of npm run start or npm start.. This page is probablly helpful https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd144832(v=vs.85).aspx. Hi, @ajyotirmay. Actually, I fixed this problem on https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/341. \nPlease wait until the next release.. LGTM. @clone1612 Thanks!. Hi, @farebord. I assume it's not Boostnote's bug.\n\n\n. Please let me know your environments.. Could you paste a screenshot with opening Developer tool here?. @farebord Got it.. Are there any errors in console?. That is the cause of the bug. You need to change the font. Sorry, it's Boostnote's bug. We try to change the default font.\nrelated: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/381. >The CSS generated by KaTex seems to assume everything is already positioned\nrefs: https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX/issues/45#issuecomment-118098668\nAccording to it, I assume it's a specification of KaTeX. Because we use renderToString() to display the math but the official web page doesn't use it. I'll try to investigate how to fix it.. Hi, @pffreitas. Boostnote Team is Web version for you. What do you mean about web version?. @pffreitas Does it mean cloud sync? If so, you need to use other services such as Dropbox or GoogleDrive. I don't contemplate to implement sync feature in Boostnote app.. Hi, @mbchoa. Thanks for reporting. I assume it's not Boostnote's bug, it's electron-g-release's bug.\nActually, I don't know well how to fix it. But you can download & install the latest version from our homepage.\nrefs: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/242. > option to disable the auto-update prompt\nGood idea! No, current latest version is 0.8.7. OMG, the version on HP is incorrect :fearful: Thank you for reporting again, we'll fix it as soon as possible.. Something goes wrong when I decrease the size of menu.\n\n. Hi, @feikname. Thank you for reporting. I reproduce this bug, I'll fix it.. Hi, check this https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/398.. I think so. I assume that PR is better.. Done.. Hi, @ymow. I cannot reproduce this issue. Let me know your environment?. @ymow Oh, you seem to add a folder located in /Volumes, it's not good. Because Boostnote probably doesn't have R/W permission to the directory. I recommend you to create your folder in your $HOME directory.. Umm, it's weird... Can you add your folder in under $HOME?. Hi, @1ps0. Thank you for reporting. Sorry for inconvenient. Umm, I cannot reproduce it... :fearful: Where was the storage located? And Could you try it again with keeping developer console open?. Hi, @eleijonmarck. There is a shortcut key Ctrl-S for it.. @eleijonmarck Oh, I got it. Exactly, current specification is not convenient. Thanks for your feature request :smile:. Hi, @eleijonmarck. Thanks for your feature request. Have you tried ever2boost?. @eleijonmarck To deal with the limit, I recommend you to use convert command.\nUmm, to implement Export as .enex in Boostnote is probably good.. Hi, @codingmatty. Thank you for your PR! What changes after merged? I'm not sure the difference except the design of checkbox. And probably you need to remove existing code for the checkbox.\nbefore\n\nafter\n\n. Hi, @xepher0coded. Do you mean this?\n\n. Here :smile: And I set Ctrl - L as Toggle Main.\n\n. Hi, @ziggy42. Are they available for electron app? I'm not sure how Linux app works in packaging.. @ziggy42 Thank you for informing us! We consider packing for Linux using them.. Hi, @tombrereton. Do you mean it cannot open any browsers on click when you put links like this [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io) into your note?\nCould you paste the markdown text here as far as you can?. It's OK! Thank you for using Boostnote :smile:. Hi, @DFelten. Thank you for your request! I also feel the dark theme can be better. So we're trying to improve it now. Please look forward to the new design :muscle: And feel free to join our slack team when you have something to say casually about Boostnote :smile:\nrelated: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/328.

Thank you as always. I feel it's a cool idea so much :smile: But this feature affects data structure of note. I'll need to contemplate it when I implement.. yeah, I know. it may not be an easy way. But if I would use LocalStorage, I can do it not take so much time.. Hi, @Alexey-T. \nCould you explain it more explicit? I could not catch it clearly. You mentioned this page, but I could not find any MD texts.\nA screenshot of the note with Editor mode is helpful for me.. Hi, @Alexey-T. I assume you misunderstand. When you want to nest them, you can write like this below:\n* \"callback\": str: If not empty, active control calls this callback instead of on_dlg event. Has one of forms:\n  -  \"module=mmm;cmd=nnn;\" - to call method nnn (in class Command) in plugin mmm (mmm is usually subfolder in the \"cudatext/py\", but can be any module name)\n  -  \"mmm.nnn\" - the same, to call method, short form\n  -  \"module=mmm;func=nnn;\" - to call function nnn in root of module mmm\nAlso, this web page is helpful: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet. Hi, @Corea. Did you try to reload after you change?. No problem. And I think it's a bit confusing behaviour, so I'll fix it. Enjoy :smile:. HI, @Ilyes-Hammadi. Thank you for reporting.

Thank you!. Hi, @Alexey-T. Sadly, I don't intend to add the shortcut because it conflicts with vim keymap.. You can set vim keymap from the menu.\nExactly, it doesn't matter who doesn't use vim. Well, I try to contemplate to implement it.. Hi, @Alexey-T. I assume it's a bug. So could you open a bug report in accordance with https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/contributing.md?\nrelated: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/221. I have an anxiety.\nProgrammers often use proper nouns so I think a bunch number of grammatical errors will appear when it will be implemented.\nAnd I feel it's meddling, so to speak.. Hi, @tkshnwesper! Could you send a PR?. Hi, @xbotao. Yeah, I contemplate implementing that feature. Check it out! :smile:\nFYI, how about using https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch?.

Alright, no problem :+1: I'm looking forward to seeing the images.. Hi, @xbotao! Sadly, here is no way to export snippets as .md/.txt for now :cry:. It's a specification. Sorry, it's a bit buggy :sob: Usually, a message box is shown if you manage to export snippets.. refs: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/486. Hi, @LeoLamCY! Thank you for informing me :+1: Umm, it works fine on windows.. LGTM\n\n. Thank you!. Hi, @SMontgomery. I'm reluctant to implement our own style. Because I assume it costs a lot to maintain. In our future, if Boostnote will become bigger, then let's consider again :smile:. Thank you @klauscfhq for opening a PR!. Sorry for long absent, but we decided not to merge this PR.. Hi, @Alexey-T. I've deleted it already https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/340. And it's released (v0.8.8). Something goes wrong on your update?. An error happens\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'trim' of undefined\n\nAnd cannot save the note. Because, I expect, this line is buggy: let trimmedNextLine = splitted[i + 1].trim() due to the array index out of bound.\nProbably, you should use forEach instead of for. Feel free to ask me anything whenever!. Hello, @Alexey-T. This issue still appears under your environment? If so, let me know more detail, please :smile:. Hi @huettenhain! Thanks for report. I suppose the priority of this issue is low. So I'm not contemplating to deal with soon. If you have a big trouble caused by this issue, let me know. Then I immediately try to solve it! Or, you can send PR :smile:. Hi, @huettenhain and @Alexey-T! I totally agree with both opinions. First of all, I don't contemplate to change the filename. But you know, it's hard to find a specific file by hand. And probably a note hash in this PR helps us to solve this problem. Because the hash of filename is contained into the hash. I'm happy if you'd tell me what you think about my opinion :smile:. Hello, @arieljannai. Here are default shortcuts!\n\n. Hi, @justin-calleja! Thank you for great PR! I think this feature is good for us :smile: But I have a favor for you. Could you separate the commit? It's too heavy.. @justin-calleja Yes, they all work fine.. You mentioned almost same thing in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/466, don't you?. Hi, @LeoLamCY! Thank you for this PR! I'd like to ask you a question. Why do you think numbers is better than string in keyCodes? I think a string is readable.. Oh, I understand. The keyboard difference between US and others makes this issue difficult. I'm using JP keyboard. But no worry, it's my mistake. We should implement shortcuts in US keyboard.\nThank you so much for informing me!\nBTW, have you used Ctrl + : shortcut? Actually, I've never used it. So I'm contemplating to delete it.. Yes, exactly true...! Umm, Ctrl + B has a conflict problem with vim key-bind. I know it's nonsense from who doesn't use vim key-bind.. In JP keyboard, : doesn't use Shift. Just { 'Ctrl': true, ':' true}.. Hi, @justin-calleja! I got it. .boostnoterc will support to change key-bind in our future :star2: I try to implement it as soon as possible \ud83d\ude47 . Hi, you guys! It's a PR to import 1 file (.txt/.md). And there's a feature to export 1 file (.txt/.md) already. Yeah, I'm going to implement bulk importer/exporter.. @sota1235 I fixed the name :pray:. Hi, @VoLuong. I added markdown-it-toc-and-anchor in order to be able to use Anchor Tag once. But there was a bug (I fixed). So I'm waiting for a release of it.. @justin-calleja Because your storage is invalid. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/v0.8.9/browser/main/Detail/index.js#L42\n- must not be included the file name. Because a hash used internally has a style like <storageKey>-<noteKey>. And the file name is located in <noteKey>\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/v0.8.9/browser/main/Detail/index.js#L38:L40\nAfter I changed the file name electron-links.cson to electronlinks.cson, it works fine.\n\nObviously, It's not expected use case. So it's self-responsibility. And you should not do this if you cannot solve yourself.. Hi, @xJeremie. How about this?\n\n. Hi, @VaclavPavek. Did you try Ctrl - Q? And I assume Ctrl - C is not appropriate in this situation. It's usually used in CLI tools.. @VaclavPavek It's one of the specifications. Boostnote doesn't stop when you click the close button.. Sorry for the long absence but I decided not to merge this PR because the policy of code is different from ours.. Hi, @Oylex. It's one of the specifications. You can use Ctrl - Q to close Boostnote.\nrelated: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/559.

Chances are links between notes help to realize this feature request.\nI mean,  the linked code snippet will be displayed as like an OGP in the preview mode.\nrefs: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/336. Hi, @eleijonmarck. Did you try this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfLggQ7-H9E\nBut / function is not implemented yet..

I assume GitHub's specification is our ideal style.\n\nFor now, you can use a code block (``) to solve this issue.. Hi, @lyrl. Thank you for reporting. I'll fix it.. Hi, @NicoHood. As you can see in this PR, we send events to AWS Mobile Analytics like access counter. It means any note content related data is sent to it. The reason why we addedspyware` was that because we had to know how many users are using the features such as ADD_MARKDOWN, ADD_SNIPPET, or ADD_FOLDER and so on to improve Boostnote more and more. I hope this answers your question.. @NicoHood What you want is here.. Hi, @psy901! That's a bug. The regular behavior is to show a dialog when you try to export a snippet but nothing happens now. So I fixed to show a dialog.\nrefs: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/626. Hi, @Alexey-T! Actually, I've found how to fix it already.

The note is probably located in ~/Boostnote/notes/*.cson.. Umm, actually, we're working for release the version now. It means v0.8.10 should not be released yet :fearful:. Hi, @k4ch0. It's a bit trouble so you should use an absolute path.\nI recommend you to use drag&drop an image.. @hassec Thank you!. Hi, @vilmes21. \nUmm, when I checked it on windows, it worked. So I'll investigate it.\n\nUI preference settings once I quit the program.\n\nSorry for inconvenient. It's a bug. And we'll release a fix version in a few hours. Until then, please put ~/.boostnoterc.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/788. The solutions I hit upon are below:\n\nDelete Ctrl-C from vim keybindings and alter it to copy\nChange as to copy into clipboard on yank\nImplement customizable keybindings\n\nYou know, No.3 is the best. But it's also another issue and takes much time.\nThe easiest way is No.1 but it affects users who use Ctrl-C so I'm reluctant to implement it.\nI believe No.2 is the most inexpensive way in this moment but it's a bit difficult to notice.. How about this?\nhttps://github.com/asmsuechan/Boostnote/pull/6\nIt's another way.\n4. Add copy feature into the existing shortcut. Thank you!. Hi, @Alaev. I fixed it in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/710 and will be released in a few week.. @evmin I'm going to try to implement it soon.. Hi, @vvs. I believe it's good to solve this by naming a random name to the file.. Fixed.. Hi, @IzumiSy. It's fixed by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/644 :dancer:. Hi, @AlexanderBelkevich. As a matter of fact, it's hard to translate the program interface for now. I'll want your support after I implement something like Language menu which can change the settings of the language (it means i18nize).\nBut, we'd be happy if you translate our documents in docs directory :dancer:.

I hope they help you.. Hi, @guayom. Could you paste a screenshot with the developer console open?. @fmaida Thanks for your suggestion! I contemplate to implement it because I agree what you say.. @fmaida You can restore the note in Trash easily. That's why I removed the dialog box.. > Removing the image for boostnote aka deleting the line of the image from the markdown file boostnote will not remove the image from the folder.\nIt's not unnatural because there's no relation between the note itself and the image. Take GitHub for example, you can upload an image on an issue comment and it won't delete even though you delete the line of an image in the comment.\n\nAdding the same image boostnote will create a new file for that exact image even if it existed in the markdown file.\n\nAs same as the above, take GitHub for example. You can upload the same image in 1 comment with no warning.\n\nI think with this kind of behavior the images folder will be getting big very fast with some duplicated images all over it.\n\nThat's true. But what's the matter? That does not matter of the speed of loading notes.. I didn't notice the necessity of image deletion. I'll consider it.. > an clean button\nGood idea. I  use a one-liner to remove files no longer used.\nIf you want to use it, run it in your storage.

Sorry, I did not understand much about what you say.\n\neverything works well again\n\nWhat does your matter?\nFYI, we added find in a note by ctrl-f in version 0.8.12.. I don't map to ctrl-f except Editor mode, so I cannot reproduce it.\n\nApart from this, Ctrl-f does not open a \"Find\" form in Boostnote either. But that is another issue.\n\nYou can use it in the latest version.. I hope Ctrl-w works.. Sure https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/753.. The saved pdf is this.\n\nCompare\n\n. I'll improve it.. Fixed.. I dealt this request to put an information panel to Trash.\nref: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/765. Merged.. > Do you guys considered to make all or just parts of the application not select able when the user presses ctrl+a\nDo you mean you don't like this situation below?\n\n\n\nthe user has to confirm that he wants to delete the file\n\nI removed the confirmation dialog box when you trash a note because it's easy. And a dialog box appears when you exactly delete a note in Trash.. I close this because I don't think it's important. But I don't stop you to open a PR :smile:. Hi, @MrBMT. Thank you so much for becoming a user :smile:\nAlright, I'll improve it.. Hi, @wonderlives. Please paste some screenshots with opening the developer tool if you report a bug.. @MrBMT Thank you for your support. I hope this (https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/764) helps.\nAnd I close this because of duplication.. @wonderlives You're welcome! Have fun!. Could you specify which words you changed?. InfoPanelTrashed Umm :thinking:. I'll refactor this later because this PR contains important change regarding https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/765.. Hi, @mrseanbaines.

But I deleted it. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/688\nWhy do you think is it useful? I think the shortcut Ctrl-Del is more useful than the context menu.. Because I thought it was a very small feature and there were alternatives useful than it (its shortcut in this case). And it's important to metabolize (refresh) the code base for maintenance reason.. I understand what you say. Alright. I'll be more prudent next time when I hit a scene that I have to remove any feature.. Hi, @PrimaMateria. Thank you for a great suggestion.

Hi, @pfftdammitchris. It's possible to sync your Storage by putting it in the directory of DropBox,  GoogleDrive or something.. Hi, @yangle. We're planning to implement Plugin system. What do you want to do by your plugin?. I got it. ~/.boostnotetc will help you https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/302 https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/318 I'll re-engage it.. Hi, @jwkicklighter. Here's an actually merged PR for boostnoterc. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/783\nSo you cannot set \"exec\" in boostnoterc. But I'm working on an implementation of Plugin now, so you'll set them in it.. Hi, @dbford. Could you show me the Console of the developer console (I want to see errors)?. Umm, It seems it's not what I want. Actually, they happen sometimes and don't affect its behavior. Could you paste the exact errors, please?\nPresumption from the Screenshots, there's parsing errors of CSON.. Ah, I got it. Already fixed. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/764. Already fixed.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/764. @XGHeaven No worry, it's a bot. So it replays automatically when MarkdownNoteDetail is detected.. I don't think it should be shown in folded note list.. I think you don't have to implement the GitHub like todo list in this time. Perhaps I'll implement it later on.\nI want the folded list to be simple. And come to think of the updated time of a note, it's not be shown on folded list.. > I think github todo list looks like not bad.\nI think so, but I have another idea the reason why I mentioned you don't have to implement the GitHub like todo list in this time.\nI also want to put the numbers of todo percentage in MarkdownNoteDetail. And it's not only this item list's problem. So I want to separate them into other PRs.. Ah, of course, if you can do it, please do it.. @XGHeaven  Well done! Thank you so much indeed :blush: I'll merge this later.. Hi, @RedBug312. Thank you for your suggestion. I'll consider it when a related plugin of markdown-it is released.. > I can't see syntax highlighting\nI don't know why it happens now, so I'll investigate it.\n\nThere are some difference between embedded code and in attached files\n\nSorry, I didn't find them. Could you specify them?. @huettenhain I'm so sorry. It's a bug. You should put ~/.boostnoterc of which content is like below for a few days until the next version will come.\n{\n    \"ui\": {\n        \"theme\": \"dark\"\n    }\n}\nAnd please refer https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/.boostnoterc.sample for the other settings.\nAlso, please refer this issue https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/788.. Fixed. > Is this really desired behavior when the .boostnoterc settings always override the user settings set in the UI?\nYes, it is. But I'll reconsider it.. @MattKunze @MrBMT @vvs Sorry for inconvenient. Umm, it's bizarre. It's working in my environment. Do you mind if I ask you more detail such as your OS or the exact content of ~/.boostnoterc?. Oh, I assume the .boostnoterc.sample is broken. Just a moment, I'll fix it.\n@MattKunze So, I assume you should put this\n{\n    \"hotkey\": {\n        \"toggleFinder\": \"Cmd + Alt + S\",\n    }\n}. @MattKunze @MrBMT @vvs I found my mistake.\nPlease remove the comma after \"lineNumber\": true in preview.\n\"preview\": {\n        \"codeBlockTheme\": \"dracula\",\n        \"fontFamily\": \"Lato\",\n        \"fontSize\": \"14\",\n        \"lineNumber\": true\n    },. @vvs What appears when you input global.process.env.USERPROFILE in the console of developer tools?. @vvs \n\nI see that Boostnote accesses the C:\\users\\vvs.boostnoterc file\n\nThank you for your investigation.\nUmm, I assume the problem is the json file. Have you seen a warning of Boostnote resets the invalid configuration. in the console?\n\nActually, those errors have happened until a few version earlier. And they don't affect its behaviour, so I'll fix them someday soon.. You can also change it from UI (ref: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/715).. That's right. Please wait for the next update.. Yes, I already fixed it https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/787. And thank you for your inspection.. Fixed in v0.8.14.\nhttps://medium.com/boostnote/release-information-8-12-2017-v0-8-14-e5b826dbf8c3. HI, @kuronat. Thank you for reporting. I'll fix it.. \nFixed.\nref: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/816. Oops, sorry. It's not fixed in that PR.. I reopened this issue but it's a specification of codeblock. So I close this again. Sorry!\nHTML entities are not encoded in a codeblock, so you should not use codeblock. So, you have to replace &nbsp; to space if you want to put them in the codeblock.. HI, @MrBMT.\n\nBuilding Boostnote from source results in the following error:\nUncaught ReferenceError: mobileAnalyticsClient is not defined.\n\nPlease use yarn run dev-start instead of compiling it.. Hi, @yashha. Thank you for your proposal. Yes, it can. Actually .html file also work. But it is not converted to markdown style for now. And I have to implement a validator or something because there are no restrictions on the type of file extension.\n\n. # before\n\n\n. Hi, @christopher-wilson. Thank you for reporting. We'll improve it.. The reason why this issue happens is that because the context is narrowed in each type.\nTo take '\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f (konnnichiwa)' for example, I type 'k' at the first moment. Then Boostnote tries to search 'k' from current notes (in the folder I focus). And the result is shown in NoteList and set them as current notes. So when next time I type 'o' that it means I try to type '\u3053', the search result of '\u3053' from previous notes ( the result of 'k') is shown.\nThis happens in Chinese as well.\nTemporary solution\nYou should copy&paste in the input for now.\nSolution\nTo solve this issue, the search and NoteList have to connect each other. So I have to refactor them (because it's separated now).. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/954. The layout is a bit strange.\n\n. @yashha For ease, I call shortcut both Shortcuts and Hotkey this time. If you change a shortcut in Hotkey, you don't need to restart Boostnote. But if Shortcut, you have to restart Boostnote. It's a big difference between them. That's why I separated them. And the structures of the system in ConfigManager are vastly different in addition.\nBut well, as you can see, this is a WIP PR. So there are a bunch of chances to merge them if I find any good way.. @yashha \n\nAlso would a Key record feature be awesome. Maybe a red circle on the right of the input field or a Button next to the inputfield to record.\n\nCould you give me an example of a service which this feature is implemented? Actually I'm not sure what exactly it is.. @yashha Merged them.. # environment\nUbuntu 16.04 LTS\nbefore\nyarn run dev-start\n\ngrunt pre-build\n\nafter\nyarn run dev-start\n\ngrunt pre-build\n\n. Hi, @jolespin. Did you specify shell or something at the codeblock?\n\n\n. What do you mean 'I don't think so'? I guess you want to colorize your codeblocks, so I said you can set syntax highlight in my previous comment. Or do you want to just change the font color in codeblocks?. Hmm, sorry. I'm still not sure what you are getting at. But I want to help you, so do you mind if I ask you to explain it from the beginning?. @shuntaroy  Thank you for reporting. Fixed.. HI, @danielepolencic. For now, you can add your own theme by yourself in this way \nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/200#issuecomment-271854423\nI'm going to implement custom theme feature in a few months along with plugin feature..

Hi, @jhanna01. thanks for good suggestion! We're contemplating the data structure issue. However, there are some difficult problems, thus we'll take a while to modify the data structure..

I think there are Formatting rules in eslint.\nI meant we've considered changing codebase but we didn't (well, you don't need to reply this section because it's our issue)\nAccording to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9101, it seems there's little probability that any issues happen when the code is changed by prettier. That's why I mentioned there are risks is that because I've experienced changes by a lint tool made me bugs due to running orders in Ruby. However, I want to change them after we get tests...\n\nMY OPINION:\nI don't care about prettier if we run it on each release. However, I don't want to add it for now because of our release flow and tests. So I want to add it after we prepare them.\nI understand your opinions. I have to ask them on committers..

Don't I have to care about it?. > Ctrl + E is best.\nI agree. I'm going to try to implement multiple key handler for shortcuts.\n\nit may be better to make it customizable.\n\nI think so. I'll try.. I feel keyPressed should be at state however I could not write smart code by using state. I want advice about it.. Not good name. In addition, I added this.. Actually, there is a method named handleSearchFocus()... Thus it's a little confusing :sob:. Oops, I forgot to remove :sweat_smile:. I follow the code style in the same file. Should I change all of them to ES2015+ style?. I should fix it to prev because the opposite word of next seems previous. \nhttp://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/the-opposite-of/next.html. handleOnSearchFocus is good to me, thanks your suggestion!. OMG, I don't have to require twice :fearful:. However the code cannot operate correctly because I want to use dialog in the renderer process. Thus I'll change it to const dialog = remote.dialog\n\nThe Dialog is opened from Electron's main thread. If you want to use the dialog object from a renderer process, remember to access it using the remote:\nconst {dialog} = require('electron').remote\nconsole.log(dialog)\nrefs: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/dialog.md. OMG...... Should I use path(liblary)?. I didn't know such an useful grammar! Thanks for your advise!. I feel let filename = path.split(\"/\").pop() is good enough actually.. OMG I left them :fearful:. Oh, I forget Mr windows :scream:. This is duplicated and not connected the state with https://github.com/asmsuechan/Boostnote/blob/74ee6ae6ce047ae7c349b35ae048ae14930c547e/browser/main/Detail/MarkdownNoteDetail.js#L29.. However, I'm not sure how it connects each other.. This does not collaborate with the actual a state of MarkdownEditor.\n. I wanna get the current status PREVIEW/CODE of the MarkdownEditor.. We need to refactor other same style lines.. I changed this let to const in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/298.. Perhaps this is an extra file. You need to remove this.. The indents seem broken.. Alright. I thought they're possible:\n\n$HOME/.${appname}rc\n$HOME/.${appname}/config\n$HOME/.config/${appname}\n$HOME/.config/${appname}/config\n/etc/${appname}rc\n/etc/${appname}/config\nrefs: https://github.com/dominictarr/rc#standards\nBut if so, the name boostnotercPath is something wrong.. Oh.... I made mistakes..... Alright :pray:. Oh... I made a mistake..... It's not plugin. Just I'd like to run some codes on starting Boostnote by execs.. Actually no. For now, only to use ~/.boostnoterc is the best as you said.. No, I cannot. I had tried. By the way, I'll close this PR. Because the wiki is better than docs.. codeBlockInMarkdown, isCodeBlockInMarkdown or isCodeBlockInNote?. markdownInCode = !markdownInCode looks better for me.\nif (trimmedLine.match('')){\n  markdownInCode = !markdownInCode\n}\n``. Perhaps you can make thisif` clause better. Like below:\nif(markdownInCode === false && trimmendLine.match(/^# +/)){\n  title = trimmedLine.substring(1, trimmedLine.length).trim()\n  break\n}. Thanks for corrections! And I recognized 1 point. You can reduce 1 indent like this below:\nif (trimmedLine.match('')){\n  isMarkdownInCode = !isMarkdownInCode\n} else if(isMarkdownInCode === false && trimmedLine.match(/^# +/)) {\n  title = trimmedLine.substring(1, trimmedLine.length).trim()\n  break\n}\n``. This code doesn't work. Because there is an extra}`. And also the indents are not good :fearful:\nif (trimmedLine.match('')){\n  isMarkdownInCode = !isMarkdownInCode\n} else if (isMarkdownInCode === false && trimmedLine.match(/^# +/)) {\n  title = trimmedLine.substring(1, trimmedLine.length).trim()\n  break\n}\n``. This is a bug fix for a problem which not to return Preview mode.. This is a bug fix for a bug which handles with switching preview by right click.. it's CodeMirror and used this name overall of Boostnote.. Alright. I'd like to use this function for DRY.. Yes. But I don't know what the difference between===and.isNullthus I used===because I knew it.. Sorry. Fixed.. Could you changelettoconst?. Is this \u7ef4\u62a4\u8005?. Thisforloop must be refactored..Object.assign()is better in this situation.const newNoteData = Object.assign({}, noteData, { storage: storage, folder: folder.key }). To reduce nest, I prefer to useif (folder.key === noteData.folder) return. Could you changeeetoeventEmitter? We're trying to use the name in full.. We need to handle rollback this copy process just in case it does not work. In this state, only to be copied the note without delete if something happens in copying.. Could you change the background-color? Because it's hard to find the target folder.. Are there any reasons you don't usedataApi?. You can more simplify likereturn folders.indexOf(.find(folders, {key: targetFolderKey})).changeOrderOfFolder?. Got it.. This variable looks useless. You can usefoldersdirectory.. Can you assign the value into the variable? Because it's hard to read.. Sorry, I'm not sure. But probablyupdateFolderis helpful.. Well, can you create a new method namedmoveFolder` or something?. Could you separate them into 2 lines?\n```\n this.handleCloseButtonClick(e)}\n\n``. You can reduce the code smaller. Probably you need to movecatch` to the bottom of the function. Yes, I know, existing codes are not good :sob:. This is an example:\n\n```\nfunction moveFolder (storageKey, folders) {\n  let rawStorages\n  let targetStorage\n  let movedStorage\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    try {\n      rawStorages = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('storages'))\n      if (!_.isArray(rawStorages)) throw new Error('Target storage doesn\\'t exist.')\n  targetStorage = _.find(rawStorages, {key: storageKey})\n  if (targetStorage == null) throw new Error('Target storage doesn\\'t exist.')\n\n  resolveStorageData(targetStorage)\n    .then((storage) => {\n      storage.folders = folders\n      movedStorage = storage\n      CSON.writeFileSync(path.join(storage.path, 'boostnote.json'), _.pick(storage, ['folders', 'version']))\n\n    })\n  resolve(movedStorage)\n} catch (e) {\n  reject(e)\n}\n\n})\n}\n``. This module is hard to test. Because~/.boostnoterc` is fixed value.. Sure. Could you change like below?\naccelerator: OSX ? 'Control + Command + F' : 'F11',\nAnd I'm not sure F11 is available on Linux or not. Do you have any ideas?. What does item mean?. Got it :smile: So could you add a comment like // item is not used under L161?. @klauscfhq Thank you for this good information :smile: Year, my opinion is this: item is used inside the menu, in other words, item is not used in our code. This is why I asked you to add a comment. Is this different from your opinion?. I make it that it runs only stable because there is no support of ES7 syntax in lts/*.. I assume cutting out into runner.sh or something is also better but I prefer to write this procedure here rather than that way. Because I'm not sure where I should put the file: I thought tests/e2e/runner.sh and scripts/e2e-runner.sh but both is not the best way because I thought this procedure is too short to cut out.. Sure thing.. Umm, I tried by hand, but the probability is quite low.. I'm gonna open another PR to implement a module for findTitle().. Because I don't like \nrepetition like findNoteTitle.findNoteTitle(). What do you think noteUtils.findNoteTitle()?\nThe reason why I didn't choose that name is because I add only 1 method this time. I thought don't need to change the name to noteUtils unless need to add a lotta methods.. Oh, yes! It's the better way :smile:. You need to add + and * as statements.\n+\n\n*\n\n. I assume forEach is better than for in this case.. I prefer the name of the argument is noteContent.. You can use string literal :smile:. An unnecessary space :sunglasses:. I should use the method, so I have to wait for merging it.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/548. You can use just splitted[index + 1] === undefined.. @sosukesuzuki what do you think about this?. you can use template literals like ${note.storage}-${note.key}.. Yes please!. Oh, I didn't confirm the color changed.. To begin with my review, I'd like you to move this method to a module such as lib/search or something. But it's ok, I'll start my review :) You can move it after my review.. This line contains a bug even in production :fearful:. \ud83d\ude0e . You can delete these condition starting from /^!.+/.. You can delete this condition too.. You should make a new method named such as findByTag().. Also, you can make a new method such ad findByWord().. I assume this below is ideal form.\nif (isTag(block)) {\n  const tag = block.match(/#(.+)/)[1]\n  notes = findByTag(notes, tag)\n} else {\n  notes = findByWord(notes, block)\n}. And also, we have to contemplate to decide these specifications.. the magic number is not good \ud83d\ude45 . The class name depends on webpack, so you have to change it. If I were you, I name the element such as searchInput.. I assume searchFromNotes() is more appropriate.. Those class names such as .Main__slider___browser-main- depends on the specification of webpack, so could you name any other one to them?. Could you change the names? It's hard to understand.. Probably, you can simply use 'fa fa-arrows-alt'.. You can simply change to them.\nfullScreen: false,\nwidthOfNoteDetail: 0,\nwidthOfMainBody: 0. You should use this.state.setState().\nconst currentScreenState = Object.assign(this.state.fullScreen, {status: !this.state.fullScreen.status})\nthis.setState({ fullScreen: currentScreenScreen }). Sorry, could you explain the reason more clearly? It works fine at least in my environment (MacOS).. Now that you don't have to use Object.assign (I commented that before I offer you to change the structure of the state).\nYou can simply write this.setState({ fullScreen: !this.state.fullScreen }).. extra line :sunglasses:. > you mean take off the {}\nYes :raising_hand_woman:. You have to use clipboard, built in electron (https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/clipboard.md), rather than another package.. To the begin with, we have to decide its design :pencil2:. Alright, let's move on to the architectural review!\nFirst of all, these states should not be placed the component because they're out of the role of it.\nI think browser/main/Main.js should manage them rather than MarkdownNoteDetail because those states are overall states for Boostnote, and you'll have to use eventEmitter to call handleFullScreenButton() from MarkdownNoteDetail.\nI believe this PR (https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/283/files) is helpful for you!. If you don't make out what I say (my English), feel free to ask me anything :smile:. :+1:. I prefer this.toggleFullScreen to this name.. This is the last step (probably :wink:). Let's change some codes in order to easy to maintain. To begin with, you can remove variables. I assume slideRight and slideLeft is not required, only noteDetail and mainBody is needed in this method.\nNext, you can separate this method into 3, show, hide, and handleFullScreenButton.\n```\n  handleFullScreenButton (e) {\n    const noteDetail = document.querySelector('.NoteDetail')\n    const mainBody = document.querySelector('#main-body')\nthis.setState({ fullScreen: !this.state.fullScreen }, () => {\n  if (this.state.fullScreen) {\n    this.hideLeftLists(noteDetail, mainBody)\n  } else {\n    this.showLeftLists(noteDetail, mainBody)\n  }\n})\n\n}\nhideLeftLists(noteDetail, mainBody) {\n    this.state.noteDetailWidth = noteDetail.style.left\n    this.state.mainBodyWidth = mainBody.style.left\n    noteDetail.style.left = '0px'\n    mainBody.style.left = '0px'\n  }\nshowLeftLists(noteDetail, mainBody) {\n    noteDetail.style.left = this.state.noteDetailWidth\n    mainBody.style.left = this.state.mainBodyWidth\n  }\n```\nAnd I would like to have your opinion. Do you think the names of each method proper? I think they're not the best.. I cannot reproduce the behavior. Could you tell me more detail?\n\nHow about showListColumns() and hideListColumns()?\n. Thank you for changing them into the module :smile:\nAnd probably, I made a mistake :fearful:. I assume arranged interface is better (regarding findByTag() and findByWord). So, you should change findByTag(). It's better that to cut out the tag from a block inside the method.\nsearchBlocks.forEach((block) => {\n  if (block.match(/^#.+/)) {\n     notes = findByTag(notes, block)\n  } else {\n     notes = findByWord(notes, block)\n  }\n})\nAnd also, you can make a method such as findByTagOrWord(block) to combine the methods for finding. (I'm not sure the argument name (block) is better or not :face_with_thermometer:). I got it. I think the problem is solved by css. z-index might be helpful. You can apply z-index to those sliders and NoteDetail.. @kazup01 will change the design, so you don't need to about it :smile:\nWell.... To be honest, I'm reluctant to add libraries. So I'll try to find any easy way to solve the issue in a few days. But if I give up, you can use the library.. Please edit the CSS :smile:\nThank you so much!. Obviously, this code is dirty. So I assume I have to make some new components for it.. > windows: Super + Alt + S\nCtrl?. Are there any reasons what you moved the variable?. Understood. You should use const instead of let.. You should use const instead of let.. This condition is necessary because unless it exists, the user, who just disable ama,  cannot disable sending data without reloading.. I assume and DO NOT COLLECT is better.. Why did you change such as to like?. Excuse me again, the comma is not needed.. No problem.. Oh, I now noticed that it's COLLECTED.... Great!. I prefer getTodoStatus than getTodoState.. I prefer Trash than in Trash in this case.. I want you to change both of them.. This line is the very reason why the bug happened.. Could you remove this?. I want to seek better way: for. I want to seek better way: window.alert. Is this really needed?. I want to seek better way. Is this really used?. I added these three lines for this change.. Understood.. Deleted because defaultNote is not configurable in Preferences now.. Deleted accompanied with handleNewPostButtonClick(). Deleted because it's no longer used.. Deleted because this file is no longer used.. I changed a specification.\nbefore\nNewNoteButton was shown in Trash but a warning appeared when a user clicked this.\nafter\nNewNoteButton is no longer shown in Trash.. I know this if condition is not good, but I don't know what exactly it is. So I choose a way not to change them.. The reason why I added MenuManager instead of ShortcutManager is that because of a preparation of Plugin feature. I plan to be able to add what user wants to the menu like atom.. Umm, I'm worrying it.. Yes. I'll create KeysManager and transplant Hotkeys into it and will delete MenuManager since the day when I really need it.. I made this nested because of compatibility..

I'm not sure the reason why the image is copied as png even if it's jpg. So this line works fine even if it's jpg.\nEDITED: I guess it's because of the program I used.. Here's the jpg file I pasted from the clipboard.\n\n. Is there any probability that it becomes null? I assume it's undefined (unconfirmed).\n(It returns true even if this.sendEventQueue is undefined because it's not a restricted equality.). Can you use findStorage()? https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/browser/lib/findStorage.js. Good :smile:. Because it just operates localStorage, does not operate files.. Is this really MAIN_FOCUSED?  In my thought, MAIN_FOCUSED is this action (gif)\n\nWhat do you suppose to MAIN_FOCUSED?\nIf this action is supposed, the name should be changed.. I understand your thoughts. APP_STARTED or LAUNCHED is good for it because if START, I might think 'start what?' (LAUNCH itself indicates that an application starts).. I prefer lineNumbers as the variable name.. I don't think the name editorLineNumber is appropriate because it's a boolean.. const editorLineNumber = config.editor.lineNumber || true or something?. What are cases that config.editor.lineNumber to be undefined? The setting should be true or false.. ?. isLineNumberShown? Umm, I'm not sure if it's better.... > If config.editor.lineNumber were false (disabled), config.editor.lineNumber || true would be true. I don't think that's what you want.\nI got it.\n~const editorLineNumber = config.editor.lineNumber === undefined ? config.editor.lineNumber : true?~. I think a little regarding the specification.\n\n(lineNumber is equal to lineNumber={true}.)\n\nUnderstood.. > it was already used somewhere else in the code.\nWhere is it? I could not find it...\nDoes it mean you chose lineNumber because there are probabilities to conflict?. Oh, I was confused, too lol\nForget about the ternary operation.. I see. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/95d74d1ca2206ed18add0348682af0063a5ac5b0/browser/finder/NoteDetail.js#L196. I often use is even if the var name is plural, and the prefix is describes it's a boolean value. isLineNumbersShown...?\nDid you mean this kind of thing?\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/12960554/java-boolean-getters-is-vs-are. I'm not sure whether we should change the platform name because AMA.Manager.platform allows any string (ref: https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-mobile-analytics-js/doc/AMA.Client.html#Options).. This does not work on various keyCodes... Need to change.\nGerman: \u00fc\u00f6\u00e4\nFrench: \u00f9\nSpanish: \u00f1\nRussian: (work fine)\nChinese: (work fine by using pinyin keyboard). I decided to extend the keyCode scope to e.keyCode<=90 || 186<=e.keyCode<=222 according to http://www.javascripter.net/faq/keycodes.htm.. Cool! However, I prefer this way\njs\n  const offsetParent = e.target.offsetParent\n  const isInfoPanel = offsetParent !== null\n    ? offsetParent.className.includes('infoPanel')\n    : false\nHow about this?. Alright, I understand.. So, I think it's a better way to create a function because it's not easy to get why it needs to be changed.\n```js\nfunction convertPlatformName (platformName) {\n  if (rawPlatform === 'darwin') {\n    return 'MacOS'\n  } else if (rawPlatform === 'win32') {\n    return 'Windows'\n  } else if (rawPlatform === 'linux') {\n    return 'Linux'\n  } else {\n    // 'Other' is better, but it does not support...\n    return ''\n  }\n}\nconst validPlatformName = convertPlatformName(os.platform())\n```. I guess this is better.\nconst { dispatch, location, params } = this.props\nconst { storageKey, folderKey } = params. I don't think timestamp should be located in hotkey because hotkey was implemented based on the idea that it operates when a user doesn't focus on the application.. ",

Hi @micronpn ,\ndeployment diagrams\nIn my environment, it seems it has already been supported. I use 0.11.4 in OSX. \n\ntiming diagrams\nFor plantuml support, we use markdown-it-plantuml. This library's current implementation cannot parse the timing diagram correctly, so I sent the patch to this project. When it is merged and the new version, I will send pull request.\nGANTT diagrams\nThis one is bit tricky. In the official page, they use @startgantt/@endgantt as a delimiter. markdown-it-plantuml can only support one delimiter at the same time.(default is @startuml/@enduml). If you use @startuml/@enduml as a delimiter, the gantt diagram should be correctly rendered. \n\nHowever, according to this discussion, @startuml/@enduml for gantt diagram will not be supported in the future. Gantt chart is still beta and it is bit early to support this syntax, so probably we will live with @startuml/@enduml in this stage.\n. Timing diagram is now supported by #2122 !. @yasuokav yes, you are right. need to update storageNoteMap here.. @Rokt33r \nThanks, but @yasuokav has almost found the solution when he created the issue. I just confirm his solution and send pull request.\n@yasuokav \nI suppose you are the right person to get this reward.\n. @Fowerld Would you please check with 0.11.5? \nProbably, my PR solved this problem.. I fixed this issue. Now it renders correctly in the markdown and snippet mode.\n\n\n. \n. If we put the labels up to the values, it will be like this.\n\n@Rokt33r @kazup01 If you want to change, I will send the PR. PR is almost ready:)\n. @ax-vasquez Same issue as #1944 and I have already fixed this issue in #1967. Would you please wait for next release. \n@kazup01 I have already received reward for fixing this. Please un-boost this issue:). Hi @OnlineVagrant ,\nNo, because this project currently uses markdown-it, and markdown-it's default table doesn't support this format. https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/issues/231. @ehhc Sorry for that. I will fix it.. @ehhc I see your problem. Probably I can solve this issue without having prefix setting. Because what we need to check here is that the link has the url scheme pattern or not.. Hi @ehhc,\nI thought about security things, What we can check here is only url string, we cannot check the file itself. So even If we have the white list / black list, we cannot prevent to open the malware perfectly.\nI cannot find other good solution, so I just re-support the local file link handling that we have before #1944.. I find the bug. Close this PR.. @TonyLancer This theme is come from Codemirror.\nhttps://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/master/theme/midnight.css\nFull name is unfortunately \"Midnight\". As you can see in the source code above link, this theme is based on http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/ .\nI don't know this color theme is available in vscode marketplace. Good luck for hunting this theme!. @CicoZhang Please update to 0.11.5. It has already been fixed. You can see another bug #2021, but this behaviour also fixed in the master branch, will be included in the next version 0.11.6.. @CicoZhang You can find the latest version from https://github.com/BoostIO/boost-releases/releases.. @jakemkc Would you please try in 0.11.6 again? We discussed this url scheme things in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2003 . I guess 0.11.6 can handle your case.. @jakemkc I see. Thanks!. Yes, markdown-it-plantuml that is used in boostnote doesn't encode before sending to server. This pull request solved this problem and it is in the review status. I hope it will be included in the next release. Next release will come in this week.\nI will make PR for updating mardown-it-plantuml after this update.. Yes, should be solved by #2122. Please wait for the release version 0.11.8.(not 0.11.7).. @Rokt33r I'm interested in this issue. I don't have this experience, but probably I can manage to do and maintenance this. If @infosisio doesn't interested, I will take care of this. Anyway I will call you in slack.. @infosisio Thanks!. Hi @Rokt33r ,\nbuild environment\nThere are several snap builder environment [Builders - Snaps are universal Linux packages].(https://docs.snapcraft.io/build-snaps/builders). I recommend to use docker or lxd container. Since, build environment should be immutable, and it can easily reproduce the build environment in every machine.\nI guess we currently use real or virtual linux machine for building .rpm, .deb package, but if we pack .rpm .deb build environment in snapcraft docker image, we can create the immutable build environment for all for linux. Of course, we need to install docker for building linux package, but we can build it in all Mac/Windows/Linux terminal. \nsnapcraft.yaml\nWe already have snapcraft.yaml in the repository, but it seems it wasn't completed. I will investigate and fix the problem.\nSnapcraft account\nI guess we don't have snapcraft account for this project. Would you please create the snapcraft account? You can create the account in here.\n. @OnlineVagrant I don't recommend to write this kind of circuit diagram in plantuml or mermaid. If you struggle with this and successfully write this, this is not the original aim of these tools.\nYou can see the supported diagrams in http://plantuml.com/ and https://mermaidjs.github.io/\nIf you want to know more detail, please ask in plantuml or mermaid repo or forum. @w-zhaohui Thanks for your suggestion. Let's discuss this topic in #1250.. @ZeroX-DG @Rokt33r \nI have reproduced this problem on my machine. MacOS X Mojave 1.14.1. \nThis problem is caused by updating the electron version from 2 to 3. (commit log a331d82cb57ad7380c4c2b25a957e43277aa619e).\nWe are currently using 3.0.8 and I also tested the latest v3 (3.0.10), but still have a problem.\nI haven't dug more detail, so I don't know this problem is caused by electron itself or not. . @iMcG33k Please enable smart paste option. More detail. https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2716. Yes, this change is for solarized theme only. Currently, solarized dark/light is the only the theme which contains space, so this change will not cause the problem for other theme.\nHowever, as you pointed out, if I add the newTheme is solarized or not, this makes more clear the intention of code.\nFollowing code also doesn't check the theme, so I will also update this.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/993cb9cb0b7c72b13b1a1cba5ed26c7a29fbcdb7/browser/components/MarkdownPreview.js#L261\nThanks for reviewing!. Thanks for suggestion.\nPersonally, I cannot see significant differences between your suggestion and original code from readable perspective. However now this code is only called for solarized dark/light theme, so I think\n${appPath}/node_modules/codemirror/theme/solarized.css\nis the most clear code. What do you think?. fixed!. ",

The reason is probably Known bugs \u00b7 Issue #6 \u00b7 BoostIO/Boostnote.\nOn Unity Ubuntu, I confirmed Finder can be closed by CTRL+Q or clicking close button on main window.\nAnother issue, CTRL+Q on Finder window kills the process then I cannot open Finder again.

I prefer it the way it is. the additional spacing looks better to the eye and gives the text more structure. @sosukesuzuki this is not a bug!. the additional vertical spacing improves readability. A large blob of text would be more tiring to read, otherwise. \nMarkdown rendering on Github behaves the same, and so it does on Typora!. I never used this, how does it work? I tried Ctrl + [ and Ctrl + ] on linux nothing happens. . I see now it works when using the GUI. Shortcuts don't!\n[ ] character are 3rd option on my keyboard so I have to press Ctrl + Alt Gr + [\n\nOS and Version: Ubuntu 16.04\nVersion: 0.11.9.pre. yes, and I'd like to see the current version number in the \"help\" menu. . I think popularity of an IDE may change over time. And there are many of them. Can you explain more your idea?\nMaybe it would be more suited to implement an import plugin for Atom, instead?. @infosisio, I am not sure if this fits into your idea, but how about integrating Boostnote with github GIST?\nhere is an explanation of how it works with SublimeText IDE: \nsee Demo here\nSublimeText is similar to Atom. To integrate GIST, a plugin is required. This is already supported in SublimeText. I didn't look for support by Atom, or other IDEs, but it is likely available, too. \nI see the following advantages by using GIST:\n\ncommon interface, allows integration by many IDE's\nbig community, popular, already has many users, lots of existing snippets\nversion controlled\nease of share code\ncloud storage, multiplatform\nneatless integration, set of snippets are synchronized with Boostnote and all IDEs \n\nDisadvantages of using GIST:\n\nsnippets are visible to others in free version, payment required for private use\n. I experienced the same\n\nSteps to replicate\n\ncreate Note\nadd a Tag\ngoto all Notes\nsearch for note by tag name\ndelete note -> note dissappears from list of notes, but editor / viewer does not change\n\nobs.: to trigger the issue, it looks like the tag name must be unique, or the search result match only 1 result. \n\nOS name, version: Ubuntu, 16.04.4\nVersion: v0.11.6. The same happens when you delete a tag inside your note. \nSteps to replicate\n\nclick on tag in the list of tags -> all notes containing this tag will be shown\nselect one of this notes\ndelete the tag chosen in step 1 from the note chosen in step 2\nobservation: note disappears from list of notes but editor remains unchanged \n\n\nThis is probably the same issue and already fixed by @ivanovserge and @max-buranbaev, I just wanted to mention it as another test case. \n\nOS name, version: Ubuntu, 16.04.4\nVersion: v0.11.6 . I see that there are use case for the current behaviour. I think it does not justify for a third option, closing the issue now.. I disagree. I think creating a new note should have consistent behaviour and you should be able to create a new note regardless of where you are (Notes, Starred, Trash). . then again, there is currently inconsistency, since you cannot create a note if you select \"Trash\". You are right your expected behavior would lead to consistency. I'd rather suggest, though, another solution:\nExpected behavior\n\nDon't hide the create note button, no matter if you are on Notes, Starred, Trash. \nCreating a new note behaves always the same. @horida you can change the behaviour in the preferences. The purpose of the button is to switch between editor modes. It is not meant to be used to switch between views. This is why the issue has been closed, the behaviour is intended. \n\nIt seems several (new?) users of Boostnote are finding the current behaviour as confusing, as similar issues have been reported before. To address this we could open a discussion that focuses on a cleaner solution. . @chang,\nI couldn't figure out how to use this for code snippets, how does it work?. @ZeroX-DG , \ncan you label the issue, please?. don't forget to mention #2237. there had been many enhancements with this release, a pre release for testing would have been nice. . @ZeroX-DG exactly my thought.  GitHub has been bloated with duplicated issues since the last release. lol . I realized now Boostnote is also responsible for some issues with the GUI of another program I use, even without using full screen (F11). It prevents on showing the content of pop-up windows on my other screen. . I cannot replicate it.\n\n\nVersion : 0.11.9.pre\nOS Version and name: 16.04 Ubuntu. I think the provided example is at fault? If I use $$ instead of $$$ the 1st example works. The second doesn't, though:\n\n\n\nEdit: Ok, the 2nd example works if I use $ instead of $$. @taohonker \nwhat is the correct way to do it? Is \\[ \\] a workaround? How to use it? Sorry I am new to this. . then Boostnote is working fine. It's only the examples on [the wiki][1] are both incorrect / possibly outdated.  \n[1]: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/wiki/TeX-support . @OnlineVagrant \nok , thank you for clarifying. \ud83d\udc4c\nI'll close the issue. . for many features a database is absolutely required. for example, auto completion is strongly tied to syntax. whether human readable format or database each are good solutions with advantages and disadvantages. what matter s is acknowledging their limitations and taking advantage of either one. .  if you want edit markdown with external tools focus on this part, don't bloat it with features. if you want feature rich software use a database. . hmm, I have hundreds of tags. Do you mean that colours are manually applied to a tag by the user? For example, for categorizing them?. @ZeroX-DG, \nThanks for confirming this. I was indeed planning to apply custom CSS for the GUI with your feature. \nThis is how BoostIO currently looks like:\n\nYou can see the black scroll bar in the black column. It has the color #425c75. The background is #435e79. It is far too little contrast to the human eye. I want to enhance this. \nAn immediate fix would be to use the Interface Theme White, but I'd rather stick with Default. Is it possible to create custom styles for the GUI? And if so can I use Default as a basis? I really don't want to change anything but this for now. \n\nOS and Version: Ubuntu 16.04\nVersion: 0.11.8. If I add a theme as described here, will it get deleted when upgrading BoostIO?. @ZeroX-DG ok no problem. I am not sure which feature fits best for Boostnote. Enhancing the current theme could also be possible, for example #ccc for the bar which is used for text colour. I'll leave that to you guys. . the other themes also need some color enhancement.\nColor theme black\nthis is the default theme. It has a grey scroll bar on the right side. \n\nbelow is the black theme. It has a grey bar with a white background. This is not consistent with other scrollbars. Also, it is not as visible, the white area should not be visible. The same applies to solarized and solarized black.\n\n. I am using\nOS and Version: Ubuntu 16.04\nVersion: 0.11.8. this does not happen in split view, only when using the \"other mode\".. text colour for the zoom must be grey in the default theme: \n\n\nOS and Version: Ubuntu 16.04\nVersion: 0.11.9.pre. @ZeroX-DG, \nI am going to fix it and make a pull-request. I fixed it\n\nbefore:\n\n\nafter:\n\n. I can not reproduce the problem. Did you use uppercase 'X' or had spaces in between?\n\n\nVersion : 0.11.9.pre\nOS Version and name: 16.04 Ubuntu. there are no issues while using lowercase 'x'. when you use uppercase only check checkbox is updated. the bar is not updated with uppercase. . I couldn't find an official source but the uppercase variant seems valid, too.\nHere is a reference I found (unofficial). Most references I found are using lowercase. \n\nGithub supports both variants:\n+ [x] [x] lowercase 'x'\n- [x] \\[x]\n- [x] \\[x\\]\n- [X] [X] uppercase 'x'\n- [X] \\[X]\n- [X] \\[X\\].

I'd like to contribute. I already forked the wiki but it's a PITA to link it with the repo, couldn't figure it out :(. how about a boostnote notebook repo for the documentation?\n\n. you were probably installing boostnote for a different user account. try adding both users too the same usr group or install boostnote for all users. . the thing is, user A should not know about the files of user B. . hi, would it make sense to sort the tags only once when they are created (and store in this order in file), instead of every time the  note is displayed?\nsorry if this suggestion doesn't make sense. I am not exactly sure what your changes does. . @daiyam I was thinking about ordering only when saving tags, to prevent frequently ordering what's already in order. existing order would remain until new tag added. \n\nEdit: for a user preference everything must be in order, but it might be suited for integrated behaviour instead. . yes, of course. thanks. . @ZeroX-DG \nIn 0.11.8 you were able to enter editor view by left-clicking into the note: \n\nIn 0.11.9-pre.1 this feature is no longer supported, if I click on it, nothing happens:\n\n. as a work around I successfully installed previous version with\nbash\nsudo dpkg -i boostnote_0.11.8_amd64.deb && sudo apt-get install -f\n. how were you even able to add C# tag? I wasn't. Same for C##, C#a. Maybe this bug is deprecated because latest version does not allow you to create such tags? Or they originated from an import plugin?\n\nEnvironment\n\nVersion : 0.11.9-pre.1\nOS Version and name : 16.04 Ubuntu. # Current behavior\n\nI upgraded to version 0.11.9-pre.2 and am now able to create the tags C#, C##, C#a. Tags are now clickable but it doesn't work right. \nSteps to reproduce\n\ncreate note, tag with C\ncreate note, tag with C#\nobserve: both tags exist, each containing 1 note\nclick on tag C#, observe: notes tagged with C are listed, notes tagged with C# are not listed\n\n@zzxxhhzxh is this what you where experiencing on your system? The behaviour is different to your description. \n\nExpected behaviour - branch \"fixing bug #2321\"\n\ntags should correlate with notes. I checked out branch from @daiyam and everything works as shown above. The .gif doesn't show it but this/is/a/test works as well. \nEnvironment\nVersion : 0.11.9-pre.2\nVersion and OS : 16.04 Ubuntu. Update: I reverted to 0.11.8 the behaviour is the same as 0.11.9-pre.2. I cannot replicate the issue.

This is intended behaviour. . This has been reported a number of times. maybe it can be mentioned here as known issues  to prevent further issues of this nature. (With a link to a closed issue, since it provides possible workarounds). . it's case insensitive in linux Ubuntu. I still can't replicate. Could you record it?\n\nVersion: 0.11.9\nOS Version and name : 16.04 Ubuntu . related use-case: #2186. I think it should stay as it is. . Update\n\n\ndue to issues in 0.11.8 I set Sanitization to \"Allow dangerous html tags\". I no longer need this in 0.11.9 and changing the setting to anything else works fine. . Despite some effort, I am no longer able to replicate this issue. Back then I could definitely reproduce it by changing the Preferences back and forth. Meanwhile I made other changes to my preferences so other dependencies may apply here, or it simply went away after a complete restart?!.  hi @ihorskyi mac users should download it manually. . @ehhc ,\nI see now what you mean. I wasn't aware a single > is needed for multi-line quotes. \nWhen writing a quote in the markdown editor, Boostnote automatically adds > to every consecutive line. \nTo mark a large text block as quote a single `> ' would be sufficient, as long as there are no empty lines. Empty lines can even be added afterwards within the quote. \nOverall, this is very efficient. What I had in mind was similar to @mbarczak (though I prefer keyboard shortcuts). I could not find an open issue for that, but I find that this should be closed and rephrased in a new issue, or we should change label here from feature request to discussion. . yes, boostnote supports many languages including Chinese. default language is English so you have to change it in file -> Preferences -> interface. @ZeroX-DG, I updated the issue to make it more clear what I meant. . his div 'NoteList' is not displayed, as shown in the screenshot.. I'd assume a corrupted update. I suggest to reinstall the latest version. . @nagledb,\nI found that any file name works fine with boostnote, I have found no issues so far. \nI'll update my code for UUID. Thank you for the helpful links!. what you are trying to do is not feasibly. styling of code is entirely defined by syntax highlighter. you'll need to create a custom style sheet for that. \nwhat exactly are you attempting to do?. I am afraid this is not supported. The code styling must be defined by syntax definition and syntax style sheets. Certain rules have to be defined to show all options in bold, for example. . @bryanjack I think your Code example is not presented correctly (on github).\nCan you fix it? Also, can you tell us which Sanitization type you use in your preferences?. @bryanjack what about your code? Something I can copy & paste to replicate the issue?. i am not 100 % sure but I think you can delete a note by pressing DEL in linux. I'll test it tomorrow. . neither in Linux. Sorry, I was imagining things. . hi @raelb, \nsynchronization is currently not handled by Boostnote itself. You can define a storage location in boostnote and synchronize it via 3rd party application, i.e., Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.. this should be \njavascript\nconst doneMatch = / \\*@done(.*)\\)\\*/.

I might go looking for a way to show the menu by default, but that's nothing to do with Boostnote. \nThank you!. @kazup01 @asmsuechan For me personally, being able to see the hex code and the color would be helpful, but I might be an exception to most people.  You all have written a great product, so I'm inclined to trust your judgment!. It's much prettier without the hideous title bar ^^.. I would also love to have \"paste image\" which would grab the image from the clipboard, save it somewhere and insert the md string (with a relative path!) to show it in the file . multiselect with shift works, but as soon as I try to drag I lose my selected notes. . I encountered this issue on 0.8.19 as well today. I was using the local storage, and lost my one hour work simply because I changed a tag..... :sob: . hi i'v found  a way to do that : go to boostnote folder then note folder you are going to see a liste of notes..open them in any text editor..and edit the title..restart the app to see the changes.. I can reproduce an export issue if the notes have an empty title\nFor example notes like these:\n\nRight click on the folder -> Export Folder -> Export as md\n\nThe result is an empty folder. Maybe you have some notes with empty titles?\n. Related to this #1613 . Hi Thomas,\n\n\nSupport for multiple languages is a very new feature. There are still some issues with that. At the moment it only works in debug mode. For production mode all the resources get packed, but this seems to be a problem for the language files. See #1727. Maybe you can help us to fix this?\n\n\nThis seems to be a windows only feature, and I'm not sure what this really does. However there is already an open issue: #1665. @davidmigloz Can you please check, if this is true for all languages? What language did you try?\n\n\nThere are some languages (Albanian, Danish, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish) where the translation file isn't completely translated. \nAnd there are some other languages (Portuguese, Russian, Spanish) with an issue, that I found while checking this. #1801 \nChinese, English, French, German, Hungarian, Korean should work.. It seems not to be related. You should create a new issue.. If you export one single note as markdown, the images will be exported in the images subfolder. This feature is already implemented #1261 \nBut, I agree with you, this should work the same, if you export the whole folder as markdown notes.. yeah, nice to have \nplease, please\nadd the option. @davidmigloz By pressing the \"Save\" button, boostnote checks all your preferences. Not only the interface preferences. Can you take a look at your hotkeys preferences? I assume the error is there. . It's a bug. See #1797 . Thanks for reporting.\nRelated issues: #1815 #1797. So, ps aux | grep note, then kill -9 for all processes related to Boostnote. Then in your config directory you will find the file Boostnote. Rename it, for example call it Boostnote_off. Then reboot your ubuntu and then Boostnote should be working fine. It will create a new Boostnote file inside the config directory. Your old markdowns and and snipets will be found as Unknown, but that's ok, you can rename them. To be safe, i backed up my notes in another drive. \nLet me know if it worked.. I installed Ubuntu 18.10 and installed Boostnote v0.11.10. When I run\nboostnote v0.11.10, it does not start.\nThen I installed on ubuntu 18.10 booste v0.11.6 and it works!\n\u043f\u043d, 29 \u043e\u043a\u0442. 2018 \u0433. \u0432 12:25, Nguyen Viet Hung notifications@github.com:\n\nCan you describe more about your problem?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2555#issuecomment-433841009,\nor mute the thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AV-wacJqcggJ02JTXSDA1B0MYrAsjx2oks5upsmSgaJpZM4X-wUU\n.\n.

    "ttdtrang": "Just get to know about Boostnote and would like to vote for this feature request. :) Could you please re-open it?\nI currently have a bunch of notes in text files I would like to import. So I guess Mike's suggestion is to import only the content of text files into notes. The other files are organized as attachments, similarly to the way html files organize their assets. For example\n-- my_note.txt\n-- my_note  # a directory\n  |-- an_attachment.pdf\n  |-- a_picture.png\n  |-- an_equation.tex\nWould be nice if an_equation.tex can be integrated into resulted markdown file. I can provide some example files for testing if necessary.\n. I'm trying to implement some kind of Journal mode. It works something like this\n To create a journal entry, you must be in a JOURNAL folder. This way specific requirements of a journal entry is satisfied without interfering with other note collections.\n A journal entry can only be created once for a given date.\n* A journal entry is created by clicking on the target date on a calendar.\nWhat's hard to decide is whether to use the automatically recorded creation date as a journal date or to add another date field to record the journal entry date. For example, you are on Monday, Feb 26, but want to write the journal entry for a day in the past, Sat Feb 24, the journal mode should give you a new journal entry for Sat Feb 24, but will annotate it with creation date at Feb 26.\nRight now I'm leaning toward keeping these dates separate. Please let me know if you have any thoughts about that.. Submitting another pull request after code linting.. I think so. This one includes the previous.. @Rokt33r Done.. ",

On most distributions, the user has to install Flatpak first, and then needs to install one or more runtimes, and then needs to install the Boostnote Flatpak.

I am wondering why you merged this PR on Oct 16 implying that it works and then ask a question on the snap forums on Oct 17 stating that you cannot build it. \nWhen a user sees that a snap folder exists in the master branch, one assumes that there is an existing snap package and one also won't try to put work into it.

I was  thinking that you had a working build until I took a deeper look at the travis build that was acutally passing but without doing anything. . WIP again, my personal travis builds are not stable. Letting you know once I have a stable build again. . Completely new approach now:\nA clean build is performed using grunt. A custom gruntfile-snap.js is needed so that all the unneeded .deb and .rpm files are not installed.\nNote: The grunt plugin that is used here is a non-official one and tweaked to work for boostnote.\nI will open a testing call for this implementation on the snap forums.\n@Rokt33r Please test the app by following the instructions in the first post here.. gruntfile-snap.js only does a grunt pre-build instead of building all the .deb and .rpm installers as it would be done with gruntfile.js.\nThis is sufficient for the snap creation and hence reduces building time a lot.. > And, could you tell me what's the differences between gruntfile-snap.js and gruntfile.js?\nSee my comment above your review.\nFeel free to clean up, I forget all the non-linux if statements. \nYes, a helper script bumping the version might be helpful!. @Rokt33r Is there still interest in adding the snap or should we close here?.

You can see a part of the discussion here: #2176 )\nSorry to let you down but i will not continue to work on it. Attached to this issue is a very quick-and-dirty solution for the given problem. Alas I still do have a lot of questions, I can\u2019t figure out (resp. a lot of issues I stumbled over):\n1)  The html export of notes containing images is broken -> no images present\n2)  Markdown export with embed files/images is broken -> links are broke\n3)  Why are the dropped files named with Math.random().toString(36).slice(-16) (CopyImages.js) instead of something more resilient like Hash(Timestamp + filename) ? Math.random() might return the same result again. Especially when not properly initialized! \n4)  Why are there (at various places) different definitions of markdown-templates to include images? I\u2019ve found at least 3 without being able to figure out why they aren\u2019t at one central place and in what cases they are used\n5)  Why are there multiple definitions of the image folder path? e.g. moveNote.js:77, exportNote.js:9, copyImage.js:22 and none global definition? A global reliable definition of this constant variable is missing\n6)  No documentation (e.g. JavaScript Doc) is provided. You have to guess what a method does and why it is necessary\nFurther issues coming up with my dirty fix hack: \n-   methods aren\u2019t doing what they promise to do: e.g. copyImage is able to and use for copying abbreviated files. \n-   \u201cImages\u201d folder (see 5) ) contains further non images attachments as well\nI hope you can understand my surprise/irritation about these various issues..\n. @Rokt33r ans ideas about this?. Hi,\nThanks for your reply. Even though, i would really love to contribute, I'm not sure whether I've enough time to do so at the moment.\nI will keep that in mind and try to come back to it in the next time.. Maybe i might find some spare time..\nUntil then: Can you have a look at my proposed \"hack\"? Might it possible to merge it? Even though ugly, at least it fixes some of the issues currently present..\n. Hi there, Thanks for your reply @nlopin \nI'm using version 0.11.3.\nIf i export the following note (markdown):\n```\nBla\ntest\n\nAR.txt\n```\nI get the following html:\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name = \"viewport\" content = \"width = device-width, initial-scale = 1, maximum-scale = 1\">\n    <!-- irrelevant style information -->\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/dracula.css\"><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/katex.min.css\"><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/codemirror.css\">\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1 data-line=\"0\" id=\"Bla\">Bla</h1>\n    <p data-line=\"1\">test<br />\n    <img src=\":storage%5C0.950lu04aev7.jpg\" alt=\"cat_scaled.jpg\" /></p>\n    <p data-line=\"4\"><a href=\":storage%5C0.9ra1y6n1euk.txt\">AR.txt</a></p>\n  </body>\n</html>\nAs you can see the links refer to the location \":storage%5C\" which is not available on my desktop!\nThere are no errors in the console and i hope you can understand this issue without a video (i don't have any idea how to do a video expressing more than the attached code here..\nThanks for your help\n. @Asitis maybe we could include a note type \"Plain Text\" or something like that... I think a working version was implemented in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1874 and will be available in the next release. So i guess after the next release, this issue might be closed @Rokt33r . @felix-last Are you trying to export a note that already contained images previous to version 0.11.5? Or did you just added the images lately to your note? I fear the way i've implemented it, it is not working with \"legacy\" images... @felix-last thanks for the information. I think i misunderstood the initial desciption of this issue. I thought you try to export it as HTML in that case the attachments will be exported as well. I might have forgotten to implement it for markdown export.. I'm sorry for that. I will have a look at it in the next days.. Or if you have time: feel free to have a look at it yourself :). @tatoosh can you do me a favor and check if this features works for you with the newest boostnote version??. @jdewinne it should be fixed as soon as https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2383 was merged. @jdewinne you are right:  #2383 isn't merged yet. I hope it gets merged soon. Furthermore you're also right with your concerns about the export-storage feature.. it will not export the attachments since they reimplemented the feature instead of using existing code.. . I've submitted a fix for the problem based on the refactoring of the attachment management -> https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1860. I've submitted a fix for the problem based on the refactoring of the attachment management -> https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1860\nI think i've also fixed the issue you mentioned as 'limitation' with the fix :) . This issue also exists for drag&dropped attachments and should be considered in #1825.\nI guess the drag&drop case is not covered by your fix. I hope to integrate it in my one though.. Hi as you see in #1825 I'm currently trying to refactor the whole attachment management. E.g. i would like to have it in one class that is responsible for that. With my previous comment i meant that i might fix your bug through my refactoring as well :). i'm not the owner of the project so i don't know. Since you already have a solution i think you should just wait for your PR to be merged. It might take some time till my fix is ready.. :). @ZeroX-DG I've submitted a lot of my refactoring by now :) Hope it will be accepted :) I've fixed this issue as well :). @Rokt33r can you already tell more about this new app? will it be open source and free as well?. @Rokt33r btw: my issue wasn't meant as a accusation. I can imagine that it's hard to maintain such a big project. I hope to make the project a little better (as it's intended by the open source idea) with my constribution. I've only mentioned the issues above so that's possible to understand why I try to refactor a few things.\nI hope to finish my fix during the comming weekend. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts about it.. @Rokt33r  unfortunately currently I don't have any idea how to do so. It's hard to write tests if the code was created by someone else. Therefore it's hard to imagine other people who don't understand the code totaly write tests later on. I think the only practical solution is to look for a good test coverage when accepting new code (even though that might be impossible for fixes because nobody will/is able to write completely new test if there are none to use as a entry point).\nFurthermore, i suggest taking a good test coverage as a main focus in new projects... @adrichey : It is already merged into the master branch and will be released in the next official build.\n@Rokt33r or the other owners might give you a ETA if you ask them.... seems to be a duplicate of https://github.com/BoostIo/Boostnote/issues/740. I have no idea why the tests are failing. Locally 'yarn jest' finishes successfully... @Rokt33r can you have a look at this? It was a lot of work and since some other issues are related to the attachment management it might be worth to review this pull request soon so that none work is wasted for issues allready solved.. at least i think so :). This change is based on the refactoring done in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1852. This change is based on the refactoring done in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1852. @Rokt33r I like you asked me to do -> https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1874. @eyleron yap, i meant it that way: i want to be able to collaborate with evernote shared notes from within of boostnote. I've seen there is a evernote nodejs sdk maybe that can be used?. @Rokt33r the jest tests aren't even executed on the travis...?.... @clone1612 the tests are executed AFTER this commit that enabled the execution!...\nAnd yes there are some elinter issues which are in files modified in later commits... (seperate pull requests..). Closed because a lot of the issues are already fixed. Yarn will be enabled on the travis in others PRs of mine. This was already fixed by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1858 and will be in the next release.\n-> Please close this issue :). @Rokt33r what is this issuehuntBot?. @abhiramravipati could you post the content of the developer console? Use View -> Toggle developer console and post the issues listed there please. This should be already fixed by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1858\nIt will be in the next release.... It seems like it is not wanted by markdown.. \nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6046263/how-to-indent-a-few-lines-in-markdown-markup\n(the post even points out a solution)\nMaybe someone want's to implement a workarount (linke replace all > through &nbsp;or something like that...). Why is the same code used in so much different places without extracting it to a method/function?. Did you try to export a note containing an attachment without the escaped html? I've not tried it but i would guess it is not working anymore because my attachment management code is not able to figure out which links are attachment links.\nCould you try it?. @ZeroX-DG to be honest, with my refactoring i broke your fix again..\ni also opened a PR for it but it was closed \"since it is already fixed\".. -.-\nYou could simply insert another key then the preview should work as expected .. :)\ni will include a fix for that again :)\n. conserning your fix. I would vote against giving the option to disable the html escaping since it is a very very important security feature.\nBtw: the problem of https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1893 is not that the html get escaped but that it is down in a wrong way.\ninput:\n\"}, \"2\":{\"\nexpected:\n<pre><code>&quot;}, &quot;2&quot;:{&quot; </code></pre>\nacutal:\n<pre><code>&amp;quot;}, &amp;quot;2&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;</code></pre>\nas you see the problem is that the & is wrongly escaped as well.. that's the problem.. not the escaping itself\nit think we escape the html two times instead of the needed one time.. but i don't know where we do that at the moment... Even though i understand your argument about customization, i think giving users the possibility to do potential harmful things seems not to be a good idea in my opinion... and i think we should ask @Rokt33r  as well. @DaniGithub is this still an issue in the newest version? Could you close it otherwise?. Hi i fear, i broke it by using a new location for the attachments. That has been done because other features are a lot easier to implement if the location of the attachments is /attachments/noteKey.\nI did not consider that my change would might break displaying existing attachments/images.\nMy deepest apologies for that.\nThe solution would be migrating the attachments to the new location.\nUnfortunately i don\u2019t know where a good place for this migration-method would be. I asked about it in the slack channel. Help is appreciated.. In general migrating should look something like this:\n```\nfunction migrateAttachments (renderedHTML, storagePath, noteKey) {\n  if (sander.existsSync(path.join(storagePath, 'images'))) {\n    let processedHtml = renderedHTML.replace(new RegExp(mdurl.encode(path.sep), 'g'), path.sep)\n    const regexp = new RegExp(STORAGE_FOLDER_PLACEHOLDER + escapeStringRegexp(path.sep) + '[a-zA-Z0-9]+(\\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+)?', 'g')\n    const attachments = processedHtml.match(regexp) || []\n    if (attachments !== []) {\n      createAttachmentDestinationFolder(storagePath, noteKey)\n    }\n    for (const attachment of attachments) {\n      let attachmentBaseName = path.basename(attachment)\n      const possibleLegacyPath = path.join(storagePath, 'images', attachmentBaseName)\n      if (sander.existsSync(possibleLegacyPath)) {\n        const destinationPath = path.join(storagePath, DESTINATION_FOLDER, noteKey, attachmentBaseName)\n        sander.copyFileSync(possibleLegacyPath).to(destinationPath)\n        renderedHTML = renderedHTML.replace(new RegExp(escapeStringRegexp(path.join(STORAGE_FOLDER_PLACEHOLDER, attachmentBaseName)), 'g'), mdurl.encode(path.join(STORAGE_FOLDER_PLACEHOLDER, noteKey, attachmentBaseName)))\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return renderedHTML\n}\n```\n. I've submitted a PR that might solve the problem by migrating the images to /attachments when displaying the note the first time. The images should be visible then again. But some other features (like removing un-referenzed attachments) will not work with that solution.\nCould you test, if that PR solves you issue please?. Hi @MeteorKepler \nThanks for your feedback.\nThe first is answered by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1941#issuecomment-390644169\nThe second is answered by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1953#issuecomment-390886100\nI hope that i fixed the problems by my PR. It will be reviewed and tested and i hope that a new version with the fix will be released soon\n. @MeteorKepler what do you mean? AFAIK all path are meant to be relative. Absolute paths (like mentioned in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1953#issuecomment-390886100 were a mistake and not intended.. . Okay. As you can see i submitted a commit in my PR that should make the paths relative (as intended).. :). what does \n\nMy link is pointing to an image file URL, though.\n\nthat mean? Can you provide your note content (resp. the part with the image)?? @haisongdong-harrison . I will close this issue since it think i caused enough trouble with my last refactoring.. \nI think i should wait and fix issues in that before doing so much refactoring again.. \nAND you won't be able to automerge this at the moment since there are other PR using the all-in-one-file-code of the attachment management\nWhat do you think about this? @Rokt33r  @kazup01 ?. I will close this PR since it think i caused enough trouble with my last refactoring..\nI think i should wait and fix issues in that before doing so much refactoring again..\nAND you won't be able to automerge this at the moment since there are other PR using the all-in-one-file-code of the attachment management\nWhat do you think about this? @Rokt33r @kazup01 ?. @sosukesuzuki i did like you said :). @kazup01 could you change it to \"in review\" again? Maybe you can do a review as well? . Could you test if it works if you write something else after pasting the screenshot? e.g. press enter or space or something else?. Unfortunately the problem was, that the attachments were referenced by a absolute path and not a relative one. After exiting the edit mode the program thought the attachment was not used and deleted it therefore.. i have fixed it now (at least i hope that.. :) ). @ivyivylynn no that\u2019s quite logical. The program deletes all files not referenced in your note. It only uses images referenced by relative links (:storage/noteKey/fileName) for this check. Since the pasted images is referenced with an absolute file link (it's a bug fixed by the commit above) that image seems not to be referenced it will be deleted therefore. Drag& drop images are referenced by relative path (as intended) and will not be deleted therefore.\nAs i said. I committed an PR fixing this problem.. The ball is up to the owner of boostnote to merge my PR now :)\n. @sosukesuzuki i've changed it like you said ;). @Rokt33r for me it works using windows as well.\nAt first look i would also say it looks good. But at a second glance:\nWhy is it zooming the whole UI? wouldn't it be better if only the editor/preview would be zoomed in?\nAt the other hand: the zoom-button already available does exactly the same.. so maybe that is the intendet feature.. I'm just not sure about that? \nShould this feature zoom the whole UI? If yes: then it works for me (on windows) as well (as i said :) ). as i said, the feature works. and according to @ZeroX-DG i does what it should do :)\n. Hi @Texxer could you post a screenshot? The link you posted is not working...\nAnd: since this is a free app (to make it clear: i am not the owner, nor associated with them), maybe it would be kind to ask in a nice way.. If i would be them, i would not feel well to work on a bug where the author wrote something like\n\nNow I suggest you go to solve the issue within your code. And when you ask nicely I may even help you on that matter.\n\nOnly my opinion but for me that sounds quite rude.. i mean: since you did not pay for it.. if you don't like the app, feeld free not to use it... @Texxer could you test what happens when you explicitly click on the folder before trying to create the note? I think the problem is that the folder is deselected and the software therefore thinks there is no one to create the note in... . @Texxer the folder i ask you to click on is (1) in the image (\"here\")\nbtw: i think the problem is that in your default storage, no folder is available (marked with 2 in the image)\nyou should ask yourself, why you've included a storage without a folder at all.. maybe this storage isn't needed and you could delete it (in preferences -> storage -> unlink (i'm not sure about the wording at the moment, but you'll find it :) )).. but that's just a suggestion.. \n\n. What is the problem with removing storage marked with \"2\" in the image? Do you get an error? Is there a error in the development console (open it by clicking view developer console (or something similar) in the menu of the program (I think it is a sub item of \"view\") (I hope you know what I mean)..? . Hm.. That's definitely a bug.. Maybe you could try to create a folder in that storage and then try to unlink it?\nMaybe the problem is that it does not contain a folder.. But that's just a guess.. . hi together, i fear it is my fault. I explained the problem here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1941#issuecomment-390644169\nI am very sorry for the problems i caused.. i've already submitted a PR that hopefully fixes the problem, but it can't be released before the next version (in 2-3 weeks,,,).\n@OnlineVagrant  what is the problem with drag&drop? If there is an error in the development console, could you please post it?\nas a current workaround: if you rename the folder \"images\" at your boostnote storage location to \"attachments\" it might work again (see the comment linked above for the explanation)\n. @OnlineVagrant thank you for your answer. Yes it is unrelated but it will be (hopefully) fixed with the next release as well :)\nSorry for the problems.. . could you guys try and test if the issue is solved with the new version?\nI hope my fixed solved the issue but there are some comments indicating that it still persist.. could you test it on your machines and give me feedback? If it's still not working: do you get any output on the developer console? \nThanks a lot. @jonblack actually the root path changed with version 0.11.5.. But with version 0.11.6 a mathod to copy them from the old location to the new one exists..(I'm sorry that i forgot about that in the 0.11.5 version :( ) Obviously it dosen't work though.. :/ \nI just can say we're looking to it... sorry for the problems. Hi,\ni think/hope both is fixed with https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2107 \nFirst problem: I have not considered that the old path started with \"/:storage\" instead of \":storage\". -> the double file:// problem..\nSecond problem: I think the migration doesn\u2019t work because the old way (i'm not completely sure about that) was \"/:storage/path/...\" with \"/\". In the first migration try i assumed that it is platform dependent instead of \"/\" (-> in windows \"/:storage\\path..\" ) But that seems to be a wrong assumption.. i (hope that i) fixed that with the recent PR as well...\nSorry for all the problems again..\n. hi, i fear it is my fault. I explained the problem here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1941#issuecomment-390644169\nI am very sorry for the problems i caused.. i've already submitted a PR that hopefully fixes the problem, but it can't be released before the next version (in 2-3 weeks,,,).\nas a current workaround: if you rename the folder \"images\" at your boostnote storage location to \"attachments\" it might work again (see the comment linked above for the explanation)\n. @kazup01 the merge issues are resolved :). How can we do that? There is no plugin mechanism implemented as far as I know.. . @kazup01 could you review it? it can be merged automatically again :). @kazup01 done. just a guess but maybe the fix for this: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1944 caused the bug?!\nhas anybody an idea what's the problem? \n@Rokt33r ?. @yosmoc thanks for your quick fix. But I think it's not yet complete.. There are still other applications I would like to access by clicking a link (e.g. There is an literature management software called zotero which I referenced from within my notes. The links start with 'zotero://').\nMaybe it would be possible to define a kind of white list of link prefixes that I can allow to be executed with the shell?? \nI would suggest to store this in the preferences but not to expose it in the ui.. Then everybody is able to change his withe list manually (by editing the preference file with text editor) without giving people without technical knowledge the opportunity to do something stupid or harmful... \nWhat do you guys think about that idea? \nCould you implement that? . @yosmoc thanks :) looking forward to seeing your solution :). I'm sorry for that. I hope it will be fixed in the next release. See https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1953#issuecomment-391605046. i'm sorry for that. it will hopefully be fixed in the next release. See https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1953#issuecomment-391605046. Is it solved with the new version? If yes, could you close this issue? :). @Rokt33r  or @kazup01 could you close this issue?. @wuliqiangqiang no, you have not lost the images. They aren't shown at the moment.. That is not the same. It will (hopefully) be fixed in the next version.\n@Rokt33r can say when that will be :). @f4il @iamaleaf  it should be fixed by now.. the images should be moved automatically by my fix which is contained in the newst build.. Do you get an error in the developer console?. @kohenchia i fear the problem is not one of the team but of me for not properly testing my refactoring.. (resp. for forgetting to test the \"migration\" at all..). I'm sorry for that... Maybe it is fixed by this? https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2107 @Rokt33r ?. @michal-organek glad to hear it works without problems now :). @payacoub pasting images and displaying images are two different things... so your problem is unrelated to this issue here... . I think this blog discusses a similar problem.. https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/electron-app-with-custom-protocol/ maybe we can \"steal\" their solution :) . you can change which planuml server you use in the settings (Preferences -> Interface -> PlantUML Server (at the bottom of the settings)).\nSo if you have a local planUML server running, you can simply use this :). @jaepetto @fourells5 the current issue is not related with this bug but with this: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2379\nThere is also already a PR (trying to) fix it :)\n@kazup01 do you mind closing this old issue? :). I think this is an issue of electron (https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/11570). I think it's fixed with the new release since we will upgrade to electron 2.x with that.\n@Rokt33r could say when the next release will be. @pranayrauthu you could try to copy them the a location not in OneDrive.. and then add that location as storage.. not satisfying but maybe you can access your notes again.. at least... at first look i don't think we could get HyperMD work together with the currently used CodeMirror.\nIf we use it instead i think that would mean we will have to redo a lot of work done to customize codemirror so that it works for us (onBlurr handler, onChange handler, etc...)... anyway i still think that it would break/complicate a lot of the current features.. . Don't understand me wrong: I don't want to discourage you. Try it :)\nI just want you to keep in mind that there might be problems.. So that you are not surprised if you encounter some.. :) . It might be possible with custom css, woudn't it?. Did you try something like the following? As custom CSS ??\n.katex-display {\n    text-align: left;\n}\nthat should take care that the latex/ktex/formula block starts at the left (and not centered) as well. Yeah, i haven't tested it before posting here.. Try this:\n.katex-display {\n    text-align: left !important;\n    margin-left: 5em !important;\n}\nWhat do you think?. you're welcome. If you go to preferences > Interfaces > Sanitizazion and change it to \"allow styles\" you already are able to do exactly what you want.. :) . are you sure, you enabled the correct option in the preferences?!. Two questions:\n- are your images in :storageLocation/attachments or in :storageLocation/attachments/NOTEKEY where NOTEKEY is a hash string?\n- are you getting any errors in the developer console?. Hi,\ni think the problem is the following: \n1) the path how attachments are referenced in the markdown is platform dependent (stupid me..). \n2) When leaving a note (onBlur) the app tries to delete all attachments not referenced in the note (e.g. not needed anymore)\n3) because you use different platforms on windows your markdown reference contains \\ as separators.. On linux the app expects /\n4) due to 3) the app don't recognizes the references in your markdown as attachments -> It deletes the actual attachments because it thinks they are not referenced (e.g. not needed).\nPossible solution: make the delete-unused-attachments-feature possible to disable.. that would not fix the issue but at least would be a workaround..\nUnfortunately i don't have that much time at the moment.. i will have a look when i can do it\n. I thought about that as well but I found one problem (maybe you've a solution for it though..): you are stuck with the language your OS is using and cannot change it.\nConsider the following use case:\nThe language of my OS is German. But I have some notes written in German, and some in English. Using a spell check relying on the OS I could only check German notes but cannot change to English (since I don't want to change my whole OS to English just to check that one note).. \nThat's why I used an independent spell check. \nDo you have ideas how to solve this problem? . First, i don't know what child process you might want to spawn.. i have absolutely no idea.\nSecond Windows dosen't care for the LANG evnironmental variable because it dosen't know about it. (https://github.com/atom/node-spellchecker/issues/72#issuecomment-323089719)\nSo for windows there is no solution to switch languages..\nI think using a hunspell-based checker (like the one i used) is better in that case because we do have control over the language in that case!\n@Rokt33r did you tryied my PR? It works, it is slow but at least it works... @Rokt33r unfortunately i still didn't had the time to include the debouncing of the live spell check.. it's on my todo list :)\nbut therefore it should still be 'in progress' and not 'in review'... I will make a new PR branching a newer version of the master.. . Hi there,\nfirst of all: thanks for fixing this issue. I'm sorry i haden't had time to do it myself. I hope changing my code wasn't that painful (i hope i produced good code.. :D )\nConsidering your two todos: First: yes as far is i know the migrateAttachment method is used and is working (at least there is nobody complaining anymore)..\nSecond: I think using it at a different location so that it can use the same getAttachmentsInContent (resp. in MarkdownContent..) method would be possible and good (less redundant code..).\nOne problem with it: It's hard to test that it is still working correctly afterwards.. And we would have to test it a lot so that we don't cause the problems again, like i did when i refactored that code initially. Steps to test:\n- go back to 0.11.4\n- insert a image via drag & drop into a note\n- check that the images was copied to :storage/images\n- upgrade to your branch\n- have a look at the note \n- check:\n  1) The image is visible in the note content\n  2) The image was copied to :storage/attachments\nCan you have a look if you can refactor that as well? And test that it still works? @saaguero ??\nOtherwise: your PR looks good to me. Thanks for your work :). your changes look good to me :) \ud83d\udc4d \n(but i have to admit, i don't have the time for the regression test at the moment :(  ). you could try to mention @Rokt33r to get a quick answer :). If you export a note that contained images as a markdown file, the attachments/images should be exported as well an the links to these files should be valid (instead of :storage/...). If you open the exported note in a markdown preview program you should be able to view the content inclusive the rendered images/files.. see https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1786. To be honest, i don't think it will be implemented in boostnote. But at the moment, there is an ongoing discussion to use a database for notes in the new version of boostnote that is developed from scratch at the moment. Please feel free to a) help to implement it and b) join the discussion\na) : https://github.com/BoostIO/Boost\nb) slack group please join the channel \"renewal\". I'm not sure whether i missunderstand you question or the problem..\nIf i do the following (using WINDOWS 10):\n- Press [alt]+ [print] to create a screenshot of the current window\n- go to boostnote and select the editor of a note\n- press [crtl] + [v] \n- -> the screenshot was embeded as a image into the note...\nOther scenario:\ngo to MS Paint, do some image things, select all, copy all, insert it into boostnote (ctrl +v) it will also be embeded as an image to boostnote...\nSo the feature is already working, isn't it?. @heihachi88 can you try to first copy your image to MS Paint and then [crtl] + a -> [crtl] + c to boostnote? Does that work?. @heihachi88 that seems to be good.. can you press return or any other key after that? Will it be shown then? Can you check if there is any information in the developer console?\nConcerning the snippet note: it is not implemented there.. :). @heihachi88 i fear it is not planed to implement it in the snippet note (due to complexity reasons..).\nBut you are welcome to create a new issue/feature request, asking for it. Maybe, if there are enough wishing for it, somebody will implement it.\nSo can you close this issue? is it fixed?. It is already possible.. just toggle the following button:\n\nand click somewhere else so that your not in the editing-option of the note (e.g. switch the program or open another note)\nto edit your note you have to click on the markdown preview again -> it has the focus again and can be edited. I think this will be fixed in the next version (it'll be the attachments-folder then) :)\nI've implemented something like that already and it was merged into master already as well \nCan you check again after the next release please?. @daiyam i just wanted to say that i like your feature. It's pretty cool :). @nac2791 if i understand it right, the maintainer (@Rokt33r ) decided that my solution is too complex and will not be merged therefore.\nI haven't closed the PR because i don't agree and will not close it. If they want to, they have to do it themself. @Rokt33r the conflicts are resolved :). @FabianTe your configuration file is located at %appdata%/Boostnote/preferences (which is a json file). Maybe that helps :) \nedit: I'm not sure if i am correct but i think there is a known issue reporting this \"unneeded/double escaping\" of some signs... Hi @FabianTe \nI'm not sure but it might be possible that the issue is even fixed and will be shipped with the next release.\nHave a look at this (already merged) PR: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2230. Can you give me one valid use-case in which you want to create a note that should be marked as deleted directely??????? \ud83d\ude15 . Can you give an example of the content of the note before you've exported it (like it is in Boostnote) and of the content of the exportet markdown file?\nIs there an error in the developer console?. Ah okay. The problem only happens when you export a whole folder?\nI will have a look at it when i have time :) . why don't you just add \">\"-characters in front of your quote? What tool do you need besides a keyboard?. @ZeroX-DG can you pleasae have a look at this :). @Rokt33r can you have a look at this PR? :). @ZeroX-DG i think that's a separated problem. I didn't implemented the export feature, i just fixed that it can export the attachments as well..\nSo i think the problem of empty notes should be done independently :). Ho do you \"import\" .md files?. Okay, i wasn't aware that this option exists.. :) . thank you @kazup01 :). @sosukesuzuki but your solution would break it on windows platform.. I will think about a platform independent solution :) \nEdit: i don't understand why it works at all.. your markdown content dosen't look like you inserted it as an attachment.. there the link in the markdown content should be something like :storage\\...... then the generated link would start with file:///. Does it works then?. @sosukesuzuki in that case i have no idea why i dosen't work.. on my windows 10 it works .. :( no idea whats different... @sosukesuzuki i think the problem may be that i hard-coded the way i removed the file-prefix.. i'm using an library to do so now.. hopefully that solves the issue. Would you do me a huge favor and test it again?\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. drag&drop a file into the editor\n2. Right-click on the link of the attachment in the markdown-preview\n3. \"Show in explorer\" should be visible and should open the explorer at the location of the attachment\nThank you for your help :). I think the library i'm using now solves exactly your problem (that the paths are different on linux systems).. :). Thanks guys :). as far as i know it is not supported by boostnote at the moment. We do not handle the opening of the file at all but delegate it to the OS to take care of it. Therefore we don't have any option to modify the way special files are opened at the moment (afaik).. sorry. One possible, but ugly, solution might be running a local file server that serves the pdf files and liking it as following: [cool pdf file at page 4](localhost:8085/path/to/file#page=4)..\nmaybe that would be possible.. :). @jangtsekiang \nI got the idea because of this page: https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/link-html-pdf-page-acrobat.html. @jangtsekiang \nusing node to create a very simple file-server (see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/a/24575241) the hack i mentioned earlier works :)\nNevertheless: exports and so on will to be able to cover your pdfs if you do something like that anymore...\nI fear it's therefore not a good solution.. :(. Hi @jangtsekiang, i think it is not a issue of us but the plugin we use. Would you be so kind and ask your question at the plugin-git? https://github.com/docarys/markdown-it-admonition. thanks :). @nagledb thanks a lot for the explanation. duplicate of https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2537\nlong story short: not an issue of boostnote but of the library we are using :)\nIt can only be fixed here if this is resolved: https://github.com/docarys/markdown-it-admonition/issues/6. @infosisio I'm not sure what you know about the developer of this project. But a lot of them are doing it in their free time.\nSo if you find an error that is that annoying and (at least the first one) mihgt be easy to fix, you're honestly invited to participate, fix it and submit a pull request :) . For me, at the moment, it works for a lot of images (alas not all..) using firefox..\ne.g. go to google image search, search for something, right click on the found image and select 'show image'; the tab only shows the images, drag the image and drop it in a note -> it was inserted as a normal attachment... @jrpope2014 the console output is only an information... As far as i know it does not indicate any problem.. Maybe i should have removed that debug line..\nit appears because of the following reason:\nwhen you leave the note (e.g. onBlur) the attachmentManagement tries to figure out which attachments are not referenced in the note anymore and should be deleted from the file system therefore as well..\nIf there is no attachment folder for that particular note the information appears.. \nAs far as i know: nothing to worry about.. :)\n. Thanks for implementing this. Never had time to do it myself but it is really needed (imho). Thanks :). The problem is following: somehow pasting images is only allowed if you enable the 'smart paste' option in the interface... I have no idea why and don't find it good.\nMaybe @Rokt33r  or @daiyam (you implemented it?) can enlight us :)  . btw: if somebody fixes this issue: intellij states that the method attachmentManagement.handlePastImageEvent is not used anymore (i think because of the implementation by @daiyam ), it would be nice to delete it completely... having dead code is.. ugly.. :) Thanks :). I'm not sure but i think Ctrl + v always gives you the images sounds right, doesen't it? I mean: Pasting images should be allways possible.. At the other hand: i don't know.. what do you think @Rokt33r ?. @daiyam is there any use case in which i need the data uri?\nMaybe we can switch the behavior? ctrl + v = Iage ctrl + shift + v = data uri? \nWhat do you think about that?. This is already known. See https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2716 for an explanation and a workaround :) . The thing is, like it is implemented at the moment, the \"246c4991-7b59-44ce-8ff4-955a0328e5ec\" is the id (resp. \"name\") of your note. Attachments (not only images) are in a folder corresponding to the note they are referred in. There are several reasons for this: e.g. otherwise it would not be possible to automatically delete attachments that are not needed anymore (because they are not referrenced anymore).\nI don't understand why you even want to use the same attachment in several notes instead of using the default mechanism and let boostnote handle it.. i mean: yes in that case there are multiple copies of the same attachment (-> more disc space needed) but all the thinks (like cloning notes, exporting them, etc) works.\nWhy don't you simple drag&drop the image into the new note? :). In the current version the issue is present again. I think that's also what is mentioned here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2834#issuecomment-466468377. @daiyam @Rokt33r can you have a look at this? I've reverted the change breaking the attachemnts  because i still don't understand what they do.. Furthermore i tried to let the tests test both linux and windows path separator \n. The problem is the regex only matched the first '\\' not the following ones (separating the noteKey).. Nonetheless: i don't understand why the expression has to be that complicated instead of the simple form present before (and after my PR)... I completed the tests so that they test with a noteKey as well. . @zzxxhhzxh i think that's another idependent problem.. Could you open a new issue for it?. the idea of the changes in the tests was that they should test both for posix and windows systems.. obviously that still dosen't work correct (they are green at my maschine since the fist commti -.-). @daiyam can you merge my PR with your fixed regex? So that we have a working attachmentMangement with proper tests again? + can you include tests for your image gallery?? \n@Rokt33r the PR would fix the attachment problem but would break the gallery... Unfortunately i don't have time to fix both.. but i think @daiyam will? (hopefully..?). @Rokt33r sorry, i cannot fix it for Mac because i don't have one and i have no idea what the problem might be.. Sorry\n@Rokt33r are the jest-Tests (yarn jest) working on Mac?. @Rokt33r then i have no idea whats wrong on mac.. sorry :(. @Aaron-Bird why do you close the bug? As far as i know, the patches for the problems aren't merged yet.. Was it fixed and i missed it?. @dredav i did the same work as you (because i didn't look if somebody else also did.. (stupid me)). Can you have a look at the tests here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2901 and merge them into your PR? In my PR the invalid markdown syntax for the tests is replaced by a valid one.... hi @dredav why do you think the } in the path of attchments is intended?. @Rokt33r what do you think about this? :). > \n\n\nhi @dredav why do you think the } in the path of attchments is intended?\n\nSorry for the late response. I suppose that the } is a negative distinction to test some special chars at the image name.\n\nyou might be correct, but i can't remember if thats the reason why it was done - and according to the \"blame-view\" most of the cases are from me and have not been modified later.. :)\nI think it might be an error and i copied and pasted it everywhere... \nBut i don't mind, if it stays in the tests :) \n\n@ehhc I need more context to understand the current situation. But the current changes in this pr look reasonable to me. URL of image should be inside of ().\n\n@Rokt33r:\nthe problem is stated here https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2884 and it was caused by an invalid regex and wrong tests (my fault -.- stupid me -.-). That are quite a lot 'default' snippets not everybody needs. Nevertheless they will be inserted by default... not sure if that's a good idea. path.sep woulde be way better than a hardcoded '/' since that isn't platformindependent!. why didn't you write any tests?!\nTests are good!. This is not platform independent. I tried to develope something platform indepnendent in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1852. Good to know. i will rember that :). I've used fs-extra because it has a good move-directory function. As far as i know sanders is not able to do so.. I think it contains some fallback implementation if the quick/efficient ways don't work... you are right and i've fixed the issue like you suggested. you are right and i've fixed the issue like you suggested. you are right and i've fixed the issue like you suggested. This method could be simplyfied to \nreturn str.matches(new RegExp('^(?:.......'));. Oh, my idea would have introduced the opportunity for null pointers.. So it's good that you ignored my concern :D. done. What is this doing? May it cause problems on windows maschines, where there is another separator?. Okay, Thanks for the information :). Why do you reject images that are not base64? e.g. i might drag&drop a pdf. Are all files always base64?!. There is no documentation at all.\nNor are there any tests i see.. . For me it seems like this method does a lot of black magic.. what are all the constants about? I have no idea how this method works, what it does and what it returns... How does it \"fixes\" the \"wrong\" rotation? I don't understand what might be wrong with it since i cannot reproduce the problem... yes, but i mean what happens if you drop a PDF for example. Is that still possible with your changes? Or will it be rejected because it is not bas64?. Okay. And why don't you use something like this library instead of implementing it yourself? (tbh: first google result) https://www.npmjs.com/package/fix-orientation ??. I think, after you'ver changed the location of the note, the attachments  will not work anymore because they have been copied to the wrong location (line 667 of this file). Can you have a look at that?. return will not create a promise anymore! that changes the baviour of this method!. why did you remove the parameter (and evaluation) \u00b4showPreview\u00b4????. you've modified the previewGeneration on this place as well!. maybe you should use constants istead of strings for this!. @jacobherrington to be honest, it was only a guess that it might break. I haven't tried. Maybe it works fine :)\nWhat might be difficult: if you clone a note to a folder in a different storage (is that even possible??).. But also only a guess.. :) maybe everything is fine :). do you mind to use attachmentManagement.STORAGE_FOLDER_PLACEHOLDER instead of hard-coding :storage here? . if it is really not possible (i am not a nodejs/electron pro, so i'm not sure about that) could you at least add an comment pointing to that file? That would help a lot in case somebody will refactor it again (e.g. in a few years..). Would it be possible that you add some tests for this method? e.g. for a note with one attachment and one test with multiple attachments?. suggestion\n * @param input Input in which the references should be replaced. Do you mind to add a coment explaining what the chars are you're using as markers? . don't mind my comment.. i wanted you to write that 0x7E means ~ and 0x60  but you already did that and i simply didn't understand your code.. I'm sorry for the supid comment :). hm.. i think you can just ignore my initial question and everything is fine :) . Couldn't you use thePATH_SEPARATORS variable which is defined at the top of the file?. is the console.log necessary? if not, could you remove it again? :). At first glance, it looks like this is duplicate code with some lines above.. is there a way to implement your changes by minimizing the duplicate code? Or is this the best solution?. Intuitively i would say this if-condition is exactly the wrong way around.. If there is **more then 0 Attachments**, only take the first one, otherwise iterate over all (but otherwise means that there are zero attachments, wouldn't it?!). could you, at least, usepath.win32.sepandpath.posix.sep? That would make clearer what the RegExp means... Then i am wondering whether you really need your%5C` i mean: it dosen't appear everywhere else in the attachment-management, does it?. Why are you checking for png only? Are there no other image formats?\nFurthermore: Can you please create and add a test for the case that the url includes a query (i take that that's the reason for this change?!). > I don't check for PNG but in case there is no extension in the url, I default it to .png\nah, okay. sorry for missunderstanding it..

    "huettenhain": "This might be a silly question, but what is the preferred way to update boostnote? In my case, I am a Windows user who very plainly used the installer, so there is a folder %appdata%\\..\\Local\\boost which currently contains folders app-0.6.4, packages and the Squirrel executable. What do I have to do when .6.5 is out? =)\n. Thanks a lot man, that's awesome.\n. Alright. I guess I would prefer if the hashtag was not required, since I am using them as keywords. \nAdding a hashtag could still limit the search to tags, while the search searches both note and tags. However, this certainly depends on how you (intend to) use tags. Absolutely no hard feelings if you keep it this way.\n. Sure, thanks a lot for being so forthcoming! I would say the following suits me best:\n- Typing any text searches tags and note contents\n- Typing text preceeded by a hashtag # searches tags only\nOptionally, you can offer a third search option:\n- Typing anything by ! negates the statement, i.e. it restricts the search to results that do not match the text that follows\nFor example:\n1. #bash xargs finds my notes tagged as bash and containing xargs anywhere\n2. bash xargs finds my notes containing bash and xargs anywhere, the results of (1) are a subset of the results obtained this way\nAnd if you implement the third option:\n1. !#xargs xargs finds everything that contains xargs but has not been tagged as xargs\n2. #xargs !xargs finds everything that has been tagged as xargs but does not contain xargs\n. Well actually, thank you so much! =)\n. Frankly, forbidding spaces is not the worst option. Usually, you can replace them by dots, dashes, underscores or solve the problem by camel casing.\n. Hey, I tried two things:\n- add a star, wait at least 10 seconds (just to be sure) and reload\n- add a star, then edit the note, wait at least 10 seconds and reload\nIn neither case, the star was still there after reload. The edits to the note were remembered, though, so I do not think it's a timing issue.\n. Just my 2 cents: I have nothing against it, but if implemented, it should be optional. I like that Boostnote is so lean, and live previews always slow things down.\nAlso, just a comment: There is an option in Boostnote to use right-click instead of focus to switch between editor and markdown view. It might be more up your alley.\n. Oh wow, this was on my wishlist and I thought it might be a little out there. I am so happy right now.\n. There has been some activity recently, and I still think that the feature would greatly improve boostnote.. Could this be added to the list of requested features? This is definitely my most wanted feature for boostnote.. This makes me very, very happy.. I can confirm this behaviour, and the suggested fix sounds good.\n. I experience the same issue as @AlexEshoo on Windows 10, each item of his description matches the behaviour at my end exactly.. I am quite sure this worked in 0.6.9 or 0.6.8. . By chance I observed that in #76, @Rokt33r said that the editor would be switched from Ace to Codemirror. This is how the feature was lost! I checked out the Ace editor and it does have the find/replace feature that we so desperately want. Why did boostnote switch? Is it easy to switch back?. Implemented in 0.8.12, thanks guys!. This has been essentially fixed by the dark theme overhaul in 0.8.10.. Hey @asmsuechan, thanks for that info. Unfortunately, these hotkeys do not seem to work application-wide, I have to select a note in the list with the mouse to make them work. Another issue is that once you are in edit mode, there is no way to leave without using the mouse. . I wanted to add my two cents about this so the developers get some feedback from different corners of the community.\nI have recently tried Typora and must say that I personally find it unusable. May advanced keyboard commands you would expect to work when editing source code do not work in Typora properly, because clearly, that's not the intended use-case. Since boostnote is tagged \"note-taking app made for programmers\", I would really prefer if its editor would continue and aspire to work like a source code editor and not a wysiwyg style editor. \nI think the Boostnote style of switching between source and display mode is the best approach and if anything, it should be improved upon.. >  It is not a WYSIWYG editor, because you edit the actual markup.\nI guess the main problem is that this is not true. With some elements, you never get to see the source code again after Typora renders them:\n1. Bullet point list in Typora give you the full Word experience. Very frustrating for a plaintext guy like me, in particular when they're nested.\n2. Tables, these are really bad. I do not think it is even possible to add a column to a table in Typora without using the mouse. \n4. Quotes and headlines. They are controlled via menu entries and Typora-specific shortcuts, which is not the same as giving you access to the source code.\nI guess if the Typora promise was real, I would like it much more. Without source code mode, I would still not accept it as a substitute because that'd mean you can not use the search/replace feature to work on formatting elements. However:\n\nAnd that's why I think that Boostnote would be incredibly awesome if it had a \"Typora mode\".\n\nThat is something I completely support, if you find someone willing to put the time in for developing such a complex feature. If it is not a substitute but an optional editor mode, by all means, go ahead! \nFinal nag: I still believe that other features should be way higher on the priority list, though. For example, a really intuitive, catch-all search/replace feature for Boostnote is still missing and I personally feel that it offers much more user experience benefit for much less development effort than the Typora mode.\n. I must say I actually like the current style - bootstnote used to have those underlines as well, and I didn't like them. I guess the best way to satisfy everyone would be to allow the user to create their own theme, and publish the currently built-in themes as possible themes to download.. Since you say that you're working on the search bar, I just wanted to mention my previous suggestion because I'd be really excited about having that.. @asmsuechan Sorry, I was just busy over the weekend, actually this looks awesome, why did you delete the branch?. Maybe I am dull, but I can only see one difference to the current layout, namely the font in the editor is not monospaced. Frankly, I would not like that. Am I missing something, though?. Hey @sosukesuzuki, thanks for the answer. I tried hovering over the tags area and scrolled with my mouse wheel, but nothing happened.. @sosukesuzuki, this happens both on my Windows 10 Professional machine and on Windows 2008 Server R2.. I just said the same thing, but less elaborate.. @VoLuong No apologies required, I am happy to get support on the issue ;-).. I am very much in favor of that ... and boostnote used to have it.. @sota1235: Yea, that's the text. But quite generally, there are some visibility issues in the editor. Not the viewer mind you, only the editor. I don't know where I mentioned this the first time, but I still believe making this fully customizable would be the best idea, i.e. give the users an option to overwrite the default CSS for the design themselves.. Oh you're brilliant - it was my fault. Apologies! Your UI is great.\nI had changed the font and font size several versions ago and for some reason, it was always rendered fine until the recent upgrade. A few tiny adjustments to the font and the font size fixed it.. I already reported this earlier. . Frankly, this is a bit over the top fancy for my taste. Boostnote is a note taking application. I feel like the functionality you request belongs in your IDE, not your note taking application.\nAlso, not everyone is a JavaScript developer. To me personally, most of these features are borderline useless. But you do not hear me requesting git integration and a gcc interface, because I have that in Visual Studio code.. This looks pretty cool. I like the simplicity of it.\nQuestion: Would this work? In the sense that the note has the tags #sugar, #recipes and #cookie, but none of it is displayed in the note itself?\n```\nMy Cookie Recipe\n #sugar #recipes #cookie \nIngredients:\n ....\n```\nThis way, one can emulate the old tag list inside an HTML comment. If that works, it's strictly better than before.. Oh, you can close this, it's #388. Sorry for the duplicate.. I realize now this is actually #296 still persisting in some cases.. Hey @asmsuechan, I completely understand. I completely agree that this is not high priority. . @Alexey-T it's in the sourcecode somewhere ;-). You can pull the project and alter it.. Sounds like it will introduce a ton of problems and possible bugs / security risks. I do not see the benefit.. I said this quite a while ago, see #225 - but thanks for the images, it illustrates the problem very clearly.. It does look cool.\nHowever, I am always worried about bloat. A note taking application should never feel sluggish because of too much bells and whistles. Also, to me this is all very low priority compared to #176. Embedding videos and google maps makes for a nice demo, but if you really use boostnote every day, you want to be able to search and replace text much more.. @sosukesuzuki this looks awesome.. Oh, how odd. It appears that Boostnote did not update on this machine, it still runs 0.8.8. Upgrading manually fixed it. I am sorry.. This is  #176, and I stress again that Boostnote already had that feature when it used the Ace editor rather than Codemirror.. @vilmes21, check out the live demo of the Ace editor. This component was used as the editor in earlier boostnote versions. Press Ctrl+F or Ctrl+H in the demo, then you will see that there is a search/replace feature there. Check #76, it was said there that Ace would be replaced with Codemirror. I think we should simply switch back.. Just my two cents, as usual, but I do not think Boostnote should try to be a taskmanager or anything of that sort. It should focus on being a good note taking application.. I absolutely agree that this is a feature that some people might want. I am quite simply not one of them, and my notes are really never reminders. I feel that boostnote should focus on being a lean note taking application for coders, not a todo list, not a task manager, not a beamer presentation tool, not an online collaboration tool, not any of the other things that you could turn it into. Because: You can turn an application like boostnote into all kinds of things by piling feature on top of feature, and if you keep doing that, it will end up being a useless piece of bloat. \nInstead of adding features, I would highly prioritize some very needed quality improvements, e.g. #176.. Absolutely fantastic. Curiosity only: can this do search/replace as well?. Awesome.. Duplicate: #746, but this bug report is much more descriptive than mine, so we might want to close #746.. While I am not quite as annoyed by it as @BobTB is, I do feel that the search capabilities of Boostnote could need some improvement. For example, the (global) search/replace in Visual Studio Code is a good example of what I would find appealing. However, it's important not to forget that this is a free and open source project, so noone's stopping us (other than our own priorities) from implementing this ourselves. So far the devs have been nothing but kind and zealous to fulfill our wishes, I am really grateful for that.. I woud like to add that horizontal scrollbars are also non-existent:\n\n\n. ",
    "twhiting": "@Rokt33r  I use boostnote extensively between school and work for my dev notes.  Thank you for creating something so useful, I only wish I knew more about java script / electron so I could contribute effectively. :+1: \nA couple of requests from a daily user:\n- An easy way to bold, strike-through, italicize, etc.  Just some formatting buttons where I can highlight some text and wrap it in a code block, bold, etc. by clicking a button would be awesome (just like how github does it in the box i'm writing this post in!\n- color text\n- Image support (probably on your to-do but not super important), working as a dev inserting images in my dev notes can frequently make taking notes much easier / cleaner.\n- Custom themes (would be nice to have a setting to override the .css or something, not critical)\n- Scroll past the bottom most line of the editor.  When i'm taking long notes I often have to insert ~20 spaces so that I'm not typing at the very bottom of the editor.\n- Full-screen mode (not critical, but nice)\n- Full google drive, onedrive support (You seem to be working on this).  I sync my notes between my computers by utilizing google drive / onedrive syncing to local storage.  It'd be nice to utilize their API's so I don't have to manually set up folder syncing (not crucial)\nAlso here are some features that may or may not make the cut depending on where you want to go with this project, aimed more at enterprise level.\n- Authentication / Password lock storage & encryption.  I have dev notes that i'd like to keep encrypted and be unlock-able, this way I can store it on my personal storage and be sure that this data is safe.\n- Multiple users editing notes, so me and someone on my team can edit notes and have them synced between us via onedrive/dropbox/gdrive, etc.  And also a last edited by username message.  No need to setup an account or anything, rather just have a nickname or something for basic identification.\n- Save via git repository.  This would be a pretty neat feature.  Instead of utilizing dropbox/onedrive/gDrive push changes to a local/remote git repository. \nAgain, these are all just ideas for the project and it's completely up to you if/which you implement. \n. Looks good \ud83d\udc4d I'm personally using boost with Google Drive & OneDrive so these features would def help me. \n. @Rokt33r I'm in favor of an integration as well.  It would help you scale in the future as well (if a mobile app was developed, access all your boostnotes from a cloud api).\nMaybe implement a short term solution like quiver now and then work towards a full integration as needed in the future? \n. I ran into this problem @madc I've let @Rokt33r know via our private slack group\n. +1 For windows (ALT to toggle menu)\n. +1. I've mentioned a github integration to the previous maintainer, it'd be great.  @titoesteves I store my boostnote data in a Google Drive folder which syncs to multiple devices with no problems. Just thought I'd let you know for short term.  Onedrive works great too. . @GaryFurash the idea would be to use a private repository to sync your data using github.  Not open gists. . ",

Agree to @agentlewis for the gitbook example. \nStoring it in front matter will make if more simpler as @kohei-takata  told. There are many parser available for it.

You can use template literal!\njavascript\nreturn `${note.storage}-${note.key}` === location.query.key. Who don't you call this.editor.getInputField() in this method?. I think handleDropImage is better. Because supporting image only.. I think so!. Please use template literal :bow:. \ud83d\udc4d . Hmm, I think it works on macOS. But on windows, path delimiters may be backslash.\nI think this way is better.. I think (English) is not necessary, because it is obvious that it is English.. Please use Function.prototype.bind. It is more clearly which this is assigned.\njavascript\nthis.showLockButton = this.showLockButton.bind(this);. I think getToggleLockButtonClassName is better.. Can you use const?. Writing this function before return is more readable.\n```javascript\nconst lockButtonComponent =\n   this.handleFocus(e)}\n    onMouseDown={(e) => this.handleLockButtonMouseDown(e)}\n\n<i className={`fa ${this.toggleLockButton()}`}/>\n\n;\n\n/* /\nreturn (\n  {this.state.editorStatus === 'CODE' ? lockButtonComponent : '' }\n);\n``. Please use{}` statement. It's more readable.\njavascript\nif () {\n} else {\n}. Same as https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/289/files#r101394868. Please use const if you wouldn't reassign the value to variable.\n(Other variables are same.). Please use arrow function. We can use ES2015 :). [question] Does code need to be kept by state?. Maybe you can use const.\nBasically, please use const.. You can write like below.\njavascript\nthis.setState({\n  options: newOptions, config, \n}). options is fuzzy word. How about codeMirrorOptions?. I think lineNumbers, readOnly, mode won't be changed.\nYou don't need to keep them in state.. Please use ===. == or != is too fuzzy.. theme attribute looks not necessary for CodeMirror component.\nhttps://github.com/JedWatson/react-codemirror/blob/master/src/Codemirror.js#L13-L23. Please place white space before and after else, if.. I know, so we should try to refactor little by little.... Plz use const :sob:. Is it necessary that receiving boostnotercPath from outside?\nI think the path of .boostnoterc is not multiple. So declare the path on this file is better.. Why do you use eval()? .boostnoterc will be like below?\n{\n  \"execs\": [\n    \"alert('hoge');\"\n  ]\n}. If you want to use plugin function, decide interface of the plugin and require it is better.\nFor example, ESLint plugin is so.\nhttp://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-plugins#processors-in-plugins\nPlease consider about it :). Why don't you use import? Please unify the coding style, require or import. Maybe return {}; is better because return value is used for Object.prototype.assign.. You don't need to declare config. Return right now!. This line failed when return void.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/318/files#diff-4bdfd7ba1c9cd532de6563d2e3cb4934R14. If RcParser.parse() returns {}, you don't need to write this if statement.. mm...Do you want to use multiple config files? I have no idea for using it.. Can't you use relative path?. Can't you write like below?\njavascript\nconfig.hotkey = Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_CONFIG.hotkey, boostnotercConfig.hotkey, config.hotkey);\nAnd I think this code doesn't implement with DRY principle. So maybe, create function to bind config and using it best!(You don't need to do that at this PR. Let's challenge next time :) ). Good module!\nIf you have a time, I want unit test. (If you don't, you don't need to make it.). So good! Simple state\ud83d\udc7c. You can use const \ud83d\udc36 . Using template literal is more readable.\njavascript\ncheckHighLight.setAttribute('href', `../node_modules/codemirror/theme/${newCodemirrorTheme}.css`). Good component! Readable \ud83c\udf70 . Good Rename!. What the mean of cm? If it is not popular wording, I want you to explain more detail.. Can't you use ===?\nAnd maybe, _.find returns undefined.\nhttps://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#find\nSo you need to write === undefined.. Maybe you can write like below.\n```javascript\ntry {\n  // Try to get target storage\n  const targetStorage = 'brabra';\n} catch (e) {\n  // You do not need to try creating 'images' directory\n  return Promise.reject(e);\n}\nreturn new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  // brabra\n});\n``. Can you use===? \nOr you can use.isNulland.isUndefined`.. \ud83d\ude07 \ud83d\ude07 \ud83d\ude07 \ud83d\ude07 \ud83d\ude07 \ud83d\ude07 \n\n. Can't you use strict equal? !== \nAnd you can use template literal.. [Question] Do you test this situation? Doesn't it crush?. You can write this line at this line.. Can you cut out this logic into the module?\nIf you do it, you can write unit test for the logic. (And I think this is business logic.). [Question]Don't you need to exec e.preventDefault() after emit an event?. You can do it by cut out this logic to the module.\nLike this.\njavascript\nexport function jumpToNote(event, noteHash, router, pathname, query) {\n  // brabra\n}\nYou can use it on any other components.. [NOT MUST] It seems to be not necessary. Can you remove this line?. Sorry, we can't remove this line.\nMaybe fixing like below is better.\njavascript\nif (this.refs.root != null) {\n  this.refs.root.focus()\n}. [NOT MUST] It is not good way to use React component.\nCan you keep status state on this component and pass it as props to this.refs.root?. \ud83d\udc4d . You are good JavaScript Engineer \ud83d\udc4d . Its for backward compatibility.. [Question] Why didn't you name this method like findNoteTitle?\nI think find is a little ambiguous.. Is the way like below is better for you?\n```javascript\nexport function findNoteTitle() {\n  //\n}\nexport default {\n  findNoteTitle,\n}\n```\njavascript\nimport { findNoteTitle } from 'browser/lib/findNoteTitle'. It seems that note was not edit. Is it necessary?. Manage color on some file is better. Like browser/styles/vars.styl.. stateless component \u2764\ufe0f . PropTypes is not used in this file.\nLet's use it. handleClickTagListItem is a little bit complicated, so declaration type for it will help us to understand.. You don't need to write return.\njavascript\nconst TagListItem = ({name, handleClickTagListItem}) => (\n  <your>\n    <jsxtag />\n  </your>\n);. Why don't you use const?. e was not used on this method. plz remove it.. same as https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/922/files#r143006881. same as https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/922/files#r143006825. Can't you cut out this component?. This component can be cut off.. mmm, complicated condition...\nCan you add comment for this if statement?. Why don't you get data from this.props?. You don't need to write return\nsame as https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/922/files#r143006528. same as \nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/922/files#r143006881\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/922/files#r143006825. writing same logic twice does not make sense...\nand it is hard to understand.\nHow about declare variable like isTagActive?\njavascript\nconst isTagActive = location.pathname.match(/tag/). \ud83d\ude22 . Please declare more detail of array. It looks component?\nPropTypes.arrayOf will help you :). The way to use arrayOf is wrong. Please read the document.\nThe code below is sample from the document.\noptionalArrayOf: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.number),\n. I think you can set even if prevProps.lineNumber !== this.props.lineNumber is false.\nIs it for performance?. This fixing is just only for solarized theme.\nCan you add checking that newTheme is solarized or not?. plz use const instead of let \ud83d\ude4f . (we know there are many let in existing code. but it doesn't make sense, so we want to use const as possible as we can). You can use getNoteKey for creating note key.. You can use findNoteByKey to check that note key exists in array or not.. Please add some variables to keep value of targetIndex === this.notes.length - 1. same as https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1070/files#r150545856. This logic seems appearing three times.\nCan't you add method for this logic?. You can use findNoteByKey(). You can use getNoteKey. [question] What do you mean by this code...?Can't you write simply const notes = this.notes?. I feel we should notice to user that deleting note was failed.\nCan you show some modal window?\n(If it is difficult, we can implement later.). You can write this code on line 147. \ud83d\udc4d . You can return on this line.. if editorType is invalid value, this function will return null\nI think assign MarkdownEditor to editor as a default value is more safe. [Comment]I feel we need flow \ud83d\ude22 . Do you need 2nd argument? It seems that this.value is not used.. You don't need to set config state.\nThis component won't change config. You can get hotkey from this.state.config. You don't need to pass null. Please make this style as mixin\nIt seems that styles are same. Please get config from this.props.config. You can remove this line (this.state.haveToSave is not used). Hotkey is a little bit ambiguous.\nFor example, how about HotkeyMessage?. And I think setting default value '' is better than null . It is little difficult to read.\nCould you add class method to get Component?. isOk is a little bit simple word. Plz specify more detail for variable name like isOkToSave or anything. It is too long line. Could you rewrite more clear?\nLike this.\njavascript\nconst execPathDir = path.dirname(process.execPath);\nconst portableDirectoryExists = path.join(execPathDir, '.portable'));\nconst userDataPath = portableDirectoryExists ? path.join(execPathDir, 'userdata') : app.getPath('userData');\napp.setPath('userData', userDataPath);. In addtion, I think the directory name .portable is not best because it doesn't have information that it's of Boostnote in the name.\nHow about .boost-portable or anything like that?. Please use import.. Please use const. btw, using Menu.buildFromTemplate is so nice :). thank you for your jsdoc \ud83d\ude4f . Please use import. this will work as an async function\nplease handle it or use fs.writeFileSync. please use export default. Couldn't you write this.oldHotkey === config.hotkey?. Couldn't you write this logic without JSON.stringify? It will be overhead.\nIf I try to write this logic, I will use _.isEqual.\nhttps://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#isEqual. It seems that this function only need two variable.\nCould you write like this?\njavascript\nhaveToSaveNotif (type, message) {\n  return (\n    //\n  )\n}\nIt will be easier to maintain.. good work\nwhy don't you use this function on this line?. you don't need to name function. plz just write such as (value) => this.refs.root.contentWindow.document.documentElement.outerHTML. plz use const. HTML is better, I think. plz use const. pleze do not use dynamic import. .mjs don't support dynamic import.(because .mjs loading is async). writing logic on stateless component does not make sense because testing component will be harder.\nplz receive boolean of which means same as !pathname.match(/\\/home|\\/starred|\\/trash/. .mjs means next feature of ecmascript.\nfyi -> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JKnj-HvAwkba9GMEuEqZjMPzAaZTL7j2f1n4JjOWXhs/edit#slide=id.p.

    "sferra": "I was just about to open a new issue requesting this feature when I found this one. I hope that it will be reopened at some point if people show interest in the \"archive note\" functionality.\nI also think that note archival could be implemented quite simply, by assigning a special \"archived\" tag to notes (similar to the \"star\" property) and enabling to toggle the appearance of notes tagged in such a way. That way it shouldn't be necessary to move notes around or replicate directory structures. It might be even possible to let the user decide if additional tags should behave the same as the \"archived\" tag.. you are welcome. thanks for the recent release :). Besides the incorrect icon, in Unbuntu Gnome the app name is also incorrect when switching between applications:\n\n. #177 seems to describe the same issue.. Related issue: #66 . Is there anything we can do to get things moving with regard to this issue?\nHaving AppImage support would really help with distribution of Boostnote in general on the Linux desktop and maybe also provide a conventient way to update to new releases.\n@probonopd is your offer to help still open?. @kazup01 would you care to comment? :). I suppose that this feature should not be all too hard to implement and it looks like a legitimate feature request. Why was this issue closed?\nI would give it a try if I can find some spare time.. @Alexey-T could you please elaborate why you need this behavior? if the reasons are good enough, someone might pick up the task.. I also encountered this issue, which is extremely annoying. I usually trigger it when pasting text into notes.\nIt occurs at some point while editing notes, and seems to be triggered by first typing ':' and then pressing the control key. After it is first triggered, each press of the control key triggers the 'bold syntax' around text near the cursor. Moving the input focus away from the editor makes the editor behave normally next time it used.. @justin-calleja could you please check if you can trigger the issue the way I can? If that is the case then please update the issue title to reflect that the control key triggers the bug, and not the shift key.. I would like to close this pull request because its source is my fork's master instead of an appropriate branch. Afterwards I would open a new pull request from an appropriate branch which contains the commits above.\nAre there any objections? Or is there an alternative for switching the pull request's source branch?. I just created #806. I'm sorry for the confusion.... I'm not sure that I understand the problem. You could just paste the text from the plain text file into the note editor to \"import\" and the other way around to \"export\". The note contents are plain text and there is no XML involved.. @GaryFurash mass import is something a bit different from the current issue description. For such a case, an import function definitely makes sense. :)\nI wanted to clarify potential confusion about XML being used for storing the notes.\nOne of the features I personally would like to see implemented is the separation of the note metadata (date, tags, ...) and the note content. That way one could synchronize the notes more easily with other devices and edit the plain markdown files. If such a separation of content and metadata would be implemented, then an import function would just need to generate the required metadata for the files to import (and maybe only reference to the original files instead of copying their content).. There isn't such functionality yet in Boostnote. Someone will have to implement it. . @yashha I am AFK for the next 24 hours, so I'm afraid I can't verify that.\nCould you please disable dash-to-dock (just for testing)  and check if the effect is the same? . I'll verify as soon as possible. . Thank you for testing. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do. . @xxdavid just in case you are still pondering on the variable naming: maybe consider the name displayLineNumbers. \ni would also suggest handling the snippets separately (as in: new ticket/discussion, new pull request). that way this pull request could be closed while still keeping the discussion/issue alive.. @asmsuechan i would argue that dismissing the \"advertising\" is a different issue than fixing the bug which prevents us to collapse the side bar. the first one is an improvement, the second one is a bug. don't you agree?. I just noticed that the notification is not centered. I'll try to fix that too.\n\n\n. The notification is now centered in the notification bar.\n\n. @kazup01 thanks for testing. i would prefer to address the \"notification\" position with a separate pull request if that's okay with you. the notification position might be an improvement but it's not related to the actual bug of not being able to toggle the navigation bar.. yes, that is a good idea. also a preference option sould probably be added for \"confirm note deletion\". but i see that as a separate issue, actually a feature.\nwhat i propose is a usability improvement in the sense that it's probably a bad idea to have \"delete\" between several UI appearance controls.. @chiangs it is generally good to confirm deletions or any destructive changes. also having a preference option to enable/disable such prompts would allow you to keep the current behavior\nanyways, this ticket was about a minor UI adjustment, not a \"confirm deletion\" feature. \n@mslourens please feel free to open a new ticket for the \"confirm\" feature.. sincerely, i initially didn't notice that there is a \"Trash\" so when i first accidentaly deleted a note i panicked until i found the \"Trash\" can. in the meantime i know there is a \"Trash\", but it is still annoying to trash stuff accidentally.\ninforming the user that something will be discarded is simply good practice. generally file managers will also warn you if you delete a file, even if it can be found in a \"trash can\" later. since we should be able to disable the prompt for \"power users\", there is no reason not to implement the behavior, or at least to consider it.\n@mslourens i think that would be @kazup01 but i might be wrong.. @chiangs i also thought about that. i think it's a good idea, but then it would make sense to make the \"snackbar\" functionality generally available in boost note, not just for this single use case. i would suggest opening a new issue for that.\ni think its a good thing to have the dialog in place first and improve from there on ;). @mslourens What do you think about shortening the message to simply \"Move the note to the trash?\" and changing the \"Confirm\" button text to \"Move\" for the sake of simplictity?\nAlso do you think that there is maybe some way to de-duplicate the code without any major refactoring?.

I think your response was plenty quick :) Honestly I expected that you'd have your hands full with other earlier requests, etc. and this would be put onto a list for the future. \nAnd yes, @huettenhain - as noted in the request, having it be optional would be best. Some may not want it, and even those that do may not want it on all the time. \nthank you!\n. @kazup01 Is this closed for being rejected, or another reason?. Hello @kazup01  - why was this feature request closed?. Yes, I have done that. Thanks. \nPerhaps of note, it may be helpful if the storage failed to add entirely when this occurs (vs seeming to fail and not loading). After removing the file and restarting Boostnote, the storage loaded for each time that I had clicked to attempt to re-add it. Thus I had 10 copies of the same storage loaded within Boostnote on start. . I like the idea of this, but I don't think it squares with the intent of the application. \nThat said, for things like this where some users may be interested but others are not, have you ever considered adding support for plugins or extensions to Boostnote?. Appears related to #677 and #515. From my non-expert attempts to investigate/debug, it appears the root of the issue lies with Coffeescript. Perhaps there is a way for Boostnote to sanitize or escape three or more single quotes in sequence in either markdown or snippet notes?. Interesting to note, this only happens on Windows. I have Boostnote installed on two Macs, also accessing the same storage, with zero issues. \nI have attempted uninstalling and reinstalling without success. In my attempt, I removed all files in the ~\\AppData\\Local\\boost\\app-0.8.14\\ folder, again without success..

In most cases opportunities are very limited, I can't feel like in the editor/IDE. Even such simple things as make a comment on the usual hotkey, unfortunately almost impossible anywhere, about a deeper customization can only dream of, and usually support with updates always leaves much to be desired.\nIn addition to all I want to store personal library of markdown docs, different tech manuals and hotkeys cheatsheets, for example be able make a quick edits in them to use it with cheaters. Now for this I use MWeb, but I feel not a very convenient to constantly switch between different apps, keep them always running, remember different hotkeys for the same things, I think it isn't right when this kind of apps, doesn't have ability to change hotkeys, or at least doesn't follow the usual macOS hotkeys (I'm sure there are good reasons).\nFrom time to time I'm doing the cleaning in the snippets, bookmarks and other relevant stuff, but over time, the amount of material which I would like to keep only growing.

I guess you will do this over some clean interface so the storage can be easily changed (from code point of view)? \nI like to contribute to add further remote/cloud storage interfaces. \ntjado\n. Yeah, the solution of Quiver is really simple. \nBut direct integration would be much better in my opinion. The first remote-storage integration would be tough as it has to solve all the caching/correct sync stuff.\nI would start simple and abstracting the current data api, so replacing it with a different one can be done without (much) code modifications (sorry if this is already the case, didn't look deep into the code). Automatic detection & reload of file modifications (like Quiver) should be then the next step as this is always necessary, or? Then an additional data api can be developed (e.g. google drive... I would start with something different).\n. I will try to look on this in the next days!\n@twhiting Yeah, this is what I wanted to say with my last post! :)\n. To be honest, I like the extra popup. So maybe do this additional (and maybe the default option)?\nOfftopic: Hi Mike :) nice to see you here!\n. @Rokt33r sorry but can you please explain your question? :)\n. Yes, from the profiler, it looks like it is the renderer :) \n\n. @Rokt33r \nI'm now confused how this error was not fixed yet. Version 0.7.2 should already include this code, right? But how did you built this version then?\nI'm asking because I saw at least one further bug in the repo version which is not existing in the official built.\n. Thanks a lot for the explanation :) I missed that option.\n. :D it seems we are struggling about the same issues! In my opinion it has nothing to do with the cson file. It is more about the parser.js in the @rokt33r/season module. In this file, a object named nodeTransforms is initiated, including a method for the type \"Literal\". But it will be called with \"StringLiteral\" which does not exist (-> an exception is thrown in transformNode). So you can add it yourself by copying the \"Literal\" stuff to \"StringLiteral\". Then the error dissapears and you get a new one with BooleanLiteral (I guess due to isStarred in the cson file). I'm wondering why this is the case... \nBy the way: this issue doesn't happen with the official app but same note files!\n. Here is my debugging result (added some console.log stuff to understand it better and the highlighted StringLiteral function):\nhttps://gist.github.com/tejado/5d847ae74036f1a301fc3bb5a84b3e99#file-parser-js-L95-L112\n. And it's working?\nI'm curious if this is really an issue with this parser.js.\n. Yes to both, thanks :) regarding Slack: I already send you a mail. Did you get it?\n. Hm, sorry but in my opinion the repo activitiy is currently lower than it was before with Rokt33r.\nAnd as the maintainer changed, it would be great to get some info to which the app is heading as also a lot of current issues were not answered, including the project page.

The single most important reason: \nIt's not necessary. Except for hoarding personal data. Please don't go that road.. You're not hearing my objection. This is not productive.

I already completed this in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1536\nPlease merge the PR so I can collect my bounty. :sunglasses: . In the note list view 'd' also deletes a note.. This is a bug and a feature request in one issue. The bug is a duplicate of #377.. A wild pull request appears.. What do you mean by 'save all changes'? Changes are automatically saved.. Just heard about this. @Rokt33r I think this is critical and created a rudimentary fix for the obvious cases in #1634. @pmood It'd be cool if you can figure out if there are other ways to xss after this PR is merged.\n. Same here. Linux Mint 18.3 Sylvia (AKA Ubuntu 16.04.3 Xenial).\nThe error message is not nice, but basically the app won't start if it's already started. I suspect that you have this on high resolution screens, because it's easy to miss the icon in the task bar.\n\nSee https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1479. Alt + Tab in Cinnamon:\n\n. In Cinnamon (Linux Mint) the icon is micro-sized. (4k laptop)\n\nCan you see it? Perhaps it's related (assets missing so either small or stretched+pixellated), otherwise here is a separate issue for that: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1479. Alt + Tab icon in Cinnamon is also low quality:\n\n. Both issues are fixed in #1528.. Probably duplicate of #1488. @ItsPugle where is your developer spirit? :nerd_face: \nPerhaps it's not technically a bug, but it is most definitely is an \"issue\".\nIf using Dropbox as a note share is being documented and promoted from within the app, it is deceitful and extremely dangerous to leave it vulnerable to accidentally removing an entire day's worth of writing.\nOf course there are options, but it begins with admitting that this is dangerous and undesirable.\nThe best option, made specifically for cases like this, and the one that e.g. Dropbox itself uses, is inotify on Linux. I believe that winfsnotify is the Windows counterpart, and kevent is for OSX. There is a multiplatform library called fsnotify. And multiplatform node modules that could possibly be used with Boostnote are:\n\nfs.notify\nchokidar\nnsfw\n\nA lesser solution, one that e.g. Tomboy Notes uses, is to sync the files every 10 minutes.. In this specific case I tend to agree with @JamesChevalier, altohugh this subject matter is outside the scope of this issue. Please continue here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/126. Agreed. Someone who hacked your dropbox can change your most frequently used/changed Boostnote notes, sit back, and wait for the user to open that note. Someone who has access to one computer can take over all your computers. Potentially. I'd say #1443 should be addressed before anything else.\n\"The attack surface seems to be small\" is one of the worst thoughts one can have when dealing with vectors.. @flakpaket I've created a PR to address the security concern: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1634. You can probably bind the scroll of one pane directly to the other by removing the debounce and removing the easing, but since these events are fired per (sub)pixel movement, you can rank up 1000+ events per second on a UHD screen and it didn't seem sane to do so. Feel free to improve or like it as is.. @sosukesuzuki Thanks for the review. I will address the issues, hopefully before or in the weekend.. @sosukesuzuki Fixed and rebased. Ready when you are.. Merged master. Please consider merging this so I can stop tracking upstream. :pray: . This is an issue with Electron, not Boostnote. When Electron is fixed, Boostnote will be fixed.\nYou can close this issue and track the progress upstream in https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8708. \n. @sosukesuzuki I hadn't observed that. I think it's because I have split view enabled by default, and you have the preview by default.\nI will examine this further.. @sosukesuzuki said:\n\nIf we update keyword in search box, code editor is hidden and markdown preview is shown.\n\nI have examined this. What you are observing is original behavior by Boostnote. If you search, your list of notes refreshes, the code editor closes, and a new note from the list is viewed in the preview. It was already like this, by design (not by me). \nThis PR adds global search highlighing in the code editor. It touches or changes nothing else. Especially useful in dual pane editing. Whether or not the editor should close when search is used, is not decided, designed, or changed by this PR. It is also not in the scope of this PR.\nIf the note selected by search should be opened in the code editor by default (e.g. when the code editor was previously selected), this should be a separate PR or feature request.\n\nI have rebased the PR on the updated master.\nPlease consider merging this PR as it will be useful for some, and consider writing a PR for the extra functionality you think would be useful to others as a result of this added feature.. I forgot the case where someone creates a new note and fixed it in this PR. This closes #1507.. Hey @kazup01, got any update on the review process? This PR is really nice to have. I notice when I switch laptops (one with this PR applied and one with vanilla Boostnote).. @kazup01 @Rokt33r Some people might prefer not to keep Boostnote (the tray icon with latest notes) open, so I've added the option to uncheck this behavior.\n\nUnchecking this will quit the app when the main window is closed, same to the behavior prior to this PR.. I don't know why the test is suddenly failing.\nHere's a deprecation warning: \n\nvalue provided is not in a recognized RFC2822 or ISO format. moment construction falls back to js Date(), which is not reliable across all browsers and versions. Non RFC2822/ISO date formats are discouraged and will be removed in an upcoming major release. Please refer to http://momentjs.com/guides/#/warnings/js-date/ for more info.\n\n\nhttp://momentjs.com/guides/#/warnings/js-date/\nhttp://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string/. Fixed merge conflict.. @Rokt33r Linux/Cinnamon. The tray icon stays. Hadn't given much thought to other Operating Systems handling it differently to be honest. I don't have OSX or Windows. :thinking: Do you have ideas? I have given you permission to do commits on top of this PR.. Great! :smile: . @Rokt33r any update on this?. I just might take you up on that @glego.\n\nYou might want to split up the remaining two requests because issues are automatically closed by merged commits, and we can't really do that when one issue contains multiple issues.. Looks like it was broken when another feature was merged in. @Rokt33r could you merge https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1591 for a quick fix?. @gramster The fix is slated for 0.11.0. Sorry for that!. @Rokt33r no problem. It happens. Glad we got this in. :sunglasses: . Careful when saying \"should\" @RomanKlopsch. I just spend hours patching a security hole directly after it came to my attention. \nMy prefered security fix would be to disable html. According to the developers of the markdown renderer, that is what people \"should\" do. It's a boolean option; it would be a 1 minute fix. I figured Boostnote had reasons for going against this security advice, so I came up with this solution.\nFeel free to build a palace on top of this PR, but let's not start the goldplating discussion while the security hole is still open.\n@Rokt33r can add some extra defaults if you plead for certain tags, but I'm hoping he will merge this yesterday.. @Rokt33r said:\n\n@Redsandro Could you fix auto scrolling again? \n\nI pulled master and the scroll sync works fine on my machine? What branch are you referring to?\n-update- I just did a fresh clone from master. Scroll sync still works fine. Could it be that you were on a wrong branch?. @RomanKlopsch said:\n\ndisabling nearly every html-tag and -attribute will cause some notes to not render properly\n\nProperly written notes should not have a problem. I think if a note depends on html a lot, one can argue that it's not written properly, but we have been getting away with it because of a bug or misguided feature. However, this discussion is not very productive without examples of problems caused. Show us broken usage patterns, and we can figure out how to deal with them, preferably in a new issue, and one problem per issue.\n\nCall me wrong but as far as i know it should last out to remove all html-tags, that define a js-event.\n\nThere are actually many ways to do xss, depending on features, plugins, and dependencies used by Boostnote, and their respective security issues. There can be zero-day exploits where you can write xss where it is not logically supposed to be possible due to errors in said dependencies.\n\nremoving all tags containing on should prevent the insertion of js\n\nThose are only the obvious ones. And electron picks up a lot of non-obvious ones, but there will always be new ones. Here are some other common ones:\n\nsrc\ndynsrc\nlowsrc\nbackground\ne.g. <table background=\"javascript:alert('xss')\">\nstyle\ne.g. <img src=\"error\" style=\"xss:expression(alert('xss'))\">\ndata\nseek controls on html5 players\nsize\nhref\ncontent\n\nXSS is more complex than just the 'legal' ways to execute scripts.\nI would actually prefer to remove img tag too, because I don't know what is possible when a dropbox hacker inserts an image that is 302 redirected to an .exe file that he just put in the same dropbox folder. Electron should ignore this, but that's the thing. Zero days and buffer overflows are discovered all the time.\nFor now this PR seems a sane place to start.. @pmood Thanks for reporting. I wanted to get this fixed but I'm on a 'time budget' as well, so I only did shallow testing. I'm especially interested to see if style is safe indeed, since it's so versatile, theoretically supporting urls and expressions and such.. @libeanim I'll address all points briefly and subjectively, but the fact is that previous usage options were only available at a serious risk. Risky behavior is now disabled, and this is the new status quo. Issues that arise from the inability to do previously risky things should really be treated as feature requests from now on, and have their own separate issues.\n\n\nonly iframes from youtube.com are allowed.\n\n\nYes. I suggest opening a new issue/whishlist for a few weeks to collect more legal suggestions from users to complement the default legal origins with. \n\n\nNotes that link to a video on a server or a video file at local path won't work.\n\n\nTrue. Functionality and Security are opposites, unfortunately. One could argue for a user customizable wishlist, but in my opinion, highest security should always be the default. Please open a separate issue for this if you want to discuss this further.\n\n\nIf a user uses <p> to introduce a specific text styling/aligment that won't work.\n<mark> to highlight text or <ins> or <del>.\n\n\nTrue. Markdown should handle paragrapgs, italics, strikethrough, etc.. If you want to write html, use a html editor.\n\n\nAlso divs which can be used to for example allow multi column text or to enable other text layouts, won't work.\n\n\nTrue. I think divs are safe and can be added to the whitelist, but I have never seen this in a note. Are you using this, or are you thinking of potential repercussions from this PR?\n\n\nsetting width and height of images\n\n\nFalse. You can use style for that.\n\n\ntables which allow multiline rows need to use the table tag (and <tr>, <td>)\n\n\nI'd argue that a Markdown editor should not use html tags and for tables there should be Github Flavored Markdown support in Boostnote where you can make basic tables. But as long as you don't use background it seems safe. You can create a PR with table tags added to the whitelist.\n\n\niframe to import zoomable graphs (local html file)\n\n\nI can imagine your usecase, but this is impossible without compromising security. Please create a new feature request issue with the option to add custom iframe origins or the option to disable XSS security.\n\n\niframe to google drive maps for travel planning\n\n\nSeems like you can safely create a PR with maps as a whitelisted origin.\n\n\niframe to embed podcasts I wrote a summary for so I can quickly replay a part inside the note\n\n\nPerhaps if the podcast is on a big famous trusted site, it can be added on the whitelist. Otherwise see response to point 8 above.\n\nWhat about allowing to deactivate sanitisation but activate it by default?\n\nCan be discussed in a separate issue. Personally I think the option should be worded for what it is:\n\nOptions\n:white_medium_small_square: :warning: Allow dangerous html tags in notes\n\nWhen enabling, a modal pops up:\n\nDangerous tags\n:warning: Enabling html also enables anyone with access to any of your devices or synced folders to prepare a note that takes over all your connected computers.\n:white_circle: I understand the implications and want to enable dangerous tags anyway\n:radio_button: Nevermind, keep me safe!\n\nThis is in my opinion the only acceptable implementation of what you are saying. But still, personally I'm against it. Enabling something this dangerous should not be as easy as two clicks. I'm for a whitelist that can only be edited manually so that no one will accidentally mess things up.\n\nThis will quickly get out of hand and hard to follow. Please create separate PRs for the obvious cases and separate issues/feature-requests for ideas that require further discussion.. @emrusso I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that you're somewhat understanding to the idea that we were trying to prevent a more dramatic comment that would go something like \"I was pretty cranky to learn that my computer was hijacked in the middle of finals by ransomware through security leaks that were known for 3 months now.\"\nAs for the problem itself, you can do multiple things:\n\nInstall the previous version\nWait for this to be released\nCreate a PR specific to your wishes\nGive a quick +1 to the people caring for your security too, to let them know it doesn't exclusively piss people off. :crying_cat_face:\n\nAs for the proposal and further discussion, see #1644.. > I think our most users are developer, so they can prevent the attack by theirselves.\nThis is not true. I am a developer, and I want to share my notes with all my devices. So it doesn't matter how smart I am. If I use Dropbox, OwnCloud or SkyDrive, I am vulnerable to their security. And a lot of services by competent developers have already been compromised to a smaller or bigger extend in the past.\n\nSo, I think we should hosting the app on electron via http.\n\nWhat does that entail? Will the notes be stored natively or remotely\n\nI think it would be best to be secure by default (limited set of safe html tags) and allow to opt-in to insecure features (broad set of tags and dangerous attributes) with a clear warning.\nFor example, an option in the app settings like so:\n\nOptions\n:white_medium_small_square: :warning: Allow dangerous html tags in notes\n\nWhen enabling, a modal pops up, where you have to confirm:\n\nDangerous tags\n:warning: Enabling html also enables anyone with access to any of your devices or synced folders to prepare a note that takes over all your connected computers.\n:white_circle: I understand the implications and want to enable dangerous tags anyway\n:radio_button: Nevermind, keep me safe!\n. ### Danger Zone\n\n\n:radio_button: :heavy_check_mark: Only allow secure html tags (recommended)\n:white_circle: :warning: Allow styles\n:white_circle: :x: Allow dangerous html tags\n:information_source: Allowing dangerous html tags also enables anyone with access to any of your devices or synced folders to prepare a note that takes over all your connected computers.. @Rokt33r ~~I recommend~~ The Open Web Application Security Project says style is not safe and should not be used. \nThis would be a candidate for https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1644#issuecomment-372174622. Yes, I'm divided between what I know is right and the amount of annoyance it causes. I think people would be more understanding if someones computer was actually compromised in some dramatic way.\nAfter all, most people prefer to share notes using Dropbox or some other cloud. Pretty much all cloud storages have been hacked in different ways. Google Drive. Dropbox. iCloud. They have all been breached in the past. And Electron is compromised every other month. This means although we see no vector while trying out known XSS exploits now, it could be a matter of time before a new one is found specific to Electron, and can be exploited.\nIt's hard to win here without implementing danger as a choice as in #1644; otherwise people are going to be upset either way.\nI'd vote against style-tags and style-attributes being available without first explicitly opting-in through the Boostnote options as proposed in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1644#issuecomment-372174622.\nUntil such possibilities are implemented, I'd say stick with 0.10 at your own risk.\n\\ I mean to the people who find the current restrictions unacceptable and need an immediate fix. I don't mean you personally. \\\nWith that said, I'll leave it in the capable hands of @Rokt33r to make a final verdict. \n. Cross-post https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1644#issuecomment-373241268\n\nDanger Zone\n\n:radio_button: :heavy_check_mark: Only allow secure html tags (recommended)\n:white_circle: :warning: Allow styles\n:white_circle: :x: Allow dangerous html tags\n:information_source: Allowing dangerous html tags also enables anyone with access to any of your devices or synced folders to prepare a note that takes over all your connected computers.. @pmood In an attempt to summarize your case, I think you are saying the same things as in your previous message. \n\nif we allow style attributes, (..) we should allow the style tag (too)\nthe likelihood (of an attack) is very low\n\n\nMy position is the following.\n\nWe should not (have) allow(ed) style attributes in the first place\nWe should not force all people to take a security risk that some people think is unacceptable\n\nAnd the solution is an option so that users may opt-in to these as proposed in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1644#issuecomment-373241268\n. @Rokt33r There is no problem in the code you quoted, but rather a limitation in the way markdown-it works. Perhaps there is a better way to handle this, but we need input from someone who understands markdown-it better.\nIn the current implementation, this problem happens because this is a case of markdown-ception where you have markdown in html in markdown. The markdown is parsed only once and per markdown block, of which the sanitation is one step (after linkify).\nWithin this step, markdown-it supports hooks on html_block and inline, which are used directly to hook in the sanitizer. And since markdown-it sees the content as a markdown document, this means that the example given i.e.:\n<details>\n\n```\naaa\nbbb\n```\n\n</details>\n\nIs quite literally:\n```\nblock 1 (html_block)\nblock 2 (markdown block)\nblock 3 (html block)\n```\nAnd each block is sanitized separately, so block 1 does not have complete html, and block 3 has no complete html, so the html is discarded, and block 2 is left.\nI don't know how to fix this with the limitations of markdown-it. We need to either:\n\nExperiment with different markdown-it token types and see if we can make it work, or:\nWrite our own complicated parser of sanitation that takes into account parents and childs of markdown in html in markdown, or:\nCreate a custom markdown tag for the details html element, and look at the > (quote) tag for inspiration, or:\nAllow the user to opt-in to super-dangerous skipping of sanitation of any kind (tempting but absolutely not recommended because it's all fun until someone actually gets ransomwared)\nSecret solution number 5 which I don't know about yet.\n\nI'm rather busy at the moment with deadlines coming up so I'm hoping someone passionate about this problem can experiment or come up with something better.. Although\nit could be something else that causes this, because I see the same problem with this code:\n> hi\n>\n> ```\n> test\n> ```\n> \n> ok\n\nIt breaks. It shouldn't. No html. Perhaps indeed a bug in the code you quoted. I don't see a fix. Help needed.. @airosB before 0.11.0 there were no structure and security checks whatsoever. See https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1634. I installed latest Boostnote (because I reinstalled Linux) and now all my code snippets are broken with &quote;, &apos; (#2220) and other encodings or escapes (#2227). Snippets become hard to read.

You'll have to create a PR upstream.\n\nPlease note that I am using the npm workflow. I don't know what yarn is. I just git push what was updated. If this creates a mismatch, perhaps some automation should be written.. After taking some time to reflect, I feel in my heart that this is very tempting but a bad idea. Please see https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1672#issuecomment-373236851 where I try to explain that it doesn't matter that you cannot do a known xss. style is a known problematic attribute, and a potent target for new exploits..

    "ItsPugle": "I'm afraid I've got to disagree with you, @Redsandro. This project is overwhelmingly no where in the direction of becoming a Freemium product. There are nth applications out there that offer dedicated cloud storage that aren't using a Freemium or Premium business model. \nI'm also not aware of any official statements from the FSF saying that having dedicated/centralised storage is a no? If they did, they'd be condemning pretty much every single storage platform.\nAnd with the privacy, I don't get your point? When you host using a third-party network, you're exposed to the same risks that you would be if you used a dedicated network, if not more. Not only does using a dedicated and centralised storage system mean that the policies are designed for Boostnote users, but it also means that you won't have another service to deal with.\nRegardless, a lot of the current third-party options cost the more you store. Having a dedicated and centralised networks means that the free quota for whatever third-party option is free for your other files, while the Boostnote storage is free for notes.. In referencing to your article, GNU is independent from FSF. They're merely a principal sponsor. Not only that, but that article was originally published with the Boston Review if you had read the subtext.\nAnother thing: Boostnote is, for the most part, community-led. All source-code is open source, contributions are welcome and issues are being opened daily. \nNot to mention that everything you've listed are exactly that (minus the self-hosting, but it's really unlikely that you're gonna have the whole user base pay for their own systems). They're all proprietary platforms. Basically, it's generic (not designed for Boostnote - everything you've listed) vs dedicated (designed for Boostnote, and most likely, open sourced). \nAs with Google Keep... I use it daily. It's governed by the Google Privacy Policy. The same policy that dictates Search, Maps, Gmail - all of that. Boostnotes intention is to make notetaking easier for developers, not to make money (as is that of Google). Any policies should reflect that.\nAs the user base grows, so does exposure. Exposure attracts sponsors. Sponsors pay. Also, as you implied, Boostnote notes don't take up much space, keeping prices low. It's not exactly like you're hosting images or files on Boostnote.\n\"It's not necessary\" isn't a reason. If you always say that stuff isn't necessary, your product will never grow.\nHave you thought about the positives of having a dedicated, Boostnote cloud storage network?\nFor the record, I also don't appreciate your overly condescending tone. I'm not trying to pick a fight - just have a discussion.. I do hear your objections, and I respect them, I just don't agree with them. With all do respect, I'd hope you'd understand that their is more to any application, any platform, any digital thing than purely the people who write the code.. I much prefer option A, because of it's materialistic colour theme. I would suggest it be slightly darker, but the other two options are too colour toned - B is too dark blue, and and C seems slight green.\nThis is the dark mode, after all. Not the colourful mode.. Never knew that! Thanks <3. Thanks for being so open! Let me know if you want/need help with anything :). I'd love to see this - especially with the Snippet Notes. Sometimes I want to explain more as to what the snippet does while still maintaining a succinct title.. Uh... only issue: the typo isn't actually covered in that repo's code:\nThis should say \"Sponsors\", not \"Sponsours\" \ud83d\ude03 \n\n. No problem! . What about having something like the Medium Image Zoom feature?. I'm also having this issue, and it's HELLA annoying. Good to know I'm not the only one \ud83d\ude04 \nBoostnote Version 0.9.0. \u2764\ufe0f . Good thinking, @tatoosh! Maybe we could have an option in preferences to define a URL for the linking? You could set it to like git.itspugle.ga, and it'll hyperlink to git.itspugle.ga/username/repository/issues/123 etc? \nMaybe you can set up placeholders, incase it doesn't follow that convention?. You should be able to write <center> HTML tags around content to centre it \ud83d\ude42 . I don't this is much of a bug. If Boostnote was constantly reindexing and rereading the files, the processor would implode I'd you have more than just a few notes.. Not going to lie. My developer spirit is on a train half way across Australia \ud83e\udd23 \nI wonder if a broader discussion around cloud storage x Boostnote needs to be had. I'd love to see a more dedicated and centralised cloud storage system for Boostnote that doesn't require third-party software... Maybe @kazup01 would be able to look into stuff like partnering with organisations to help cover the cost of cloud storage?. I was literally about to suggest this. I'm wholeheartedly +1 for this!\n. Maybe, Maybe not. I don't know!\nI think that it might just be best to give Markdown Snippet notes everything that normal Markdown notes have.. Kind of a Kaban style, I'm guessing?. ",
    "rsimp": "@ItsPugle What does it matter if it's open source unless everyone has access to the server? You have no guarantee what code a server is running. That's not really an argument against doing it, but open source doesn't really factor in here. By running servers you're choosing to give your trust to the server administrators, there's no way around that.\nI'm not necessarily against having servers but as @Redsandro pointed out, they are definitely not free. It also feels weird to me to have a server and not use it for storage. That design seems half way in, half way out and will lead to some really bizarre design choices. Its like a distributed system where you don't own or control certain elements, and in fact only the client even has access to them. If we run a server in this context it really needs to be unnecessary, where the app can run better with a connection but doesn't require one. It seems to me this should be the very last thing to bring in because we'd still need all the same mechanisms as if we didn't have it.\nSome other considerations:\n- Google expects you to poll (they have webhooks, but no websockets, long polling, or SSE) but has limits on the app even across all users: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10311969/what-is-the-limit-on-google-drive-api-usage . The user limit is very nice, but the app wide limit will hit a wall with enough active users. I think the google team will raise it if you talk to them, but only if they think you're not being excessive\n- Changes require a full re-upload of the entire file, they don't allow you to upload deltas. This means we need a debounce period that considers a worse-case file size/bandwidth scenario, at least 15-30 seconds. It helps that markdown files don't contain assets which limits their size\n- Orphaned images/assets may need to eventually be addressed\n- Some sort of mature conflict resolution needs to be eventually implemented. I think we could start out with overwriting on conflict, but should move to the dropbox model of renaming conflicted files as filename (conflicted copy).ext\n- Syncing the file on open/close sounds good, although we'd still need sync polling and dirty tracking\n- Due to the way searching works with tags I think we'd have to basically download complete notebooks and cache them, instead of lazy loading individual notes on demand\n- Dropbox helps with long-polling and no app wide quota, so maybe we should knock it out first\n. Well one reason to go with mermaid is that it's natively supported in JS, as opposed to markdown-it-plantuml which is a js port and only seems to be supported by one developer (8 stars vs 15k). The source code is very low level and hard to parse, and the tests are incomplete, but it seems like a surprisingly complete and bug free port. Newer features will have to be manually added in though.. ",
    "rodtwo": "For Desktop, I think the workaround is pretty simple to do - specially for a \"developers\" note app. I'm using OneDrive and it works great for me.\nHowever, I downloaded the Android app and found it very basic - apart from Dropbox, no other integration, neither with workaround is available.

Also, on my company it's not possible to sync Google Drive with the file system. Here I always have to sync Boostnote manually. . A better search is necessary. I have now created a snippet and could not even search for the title of the snippet.. @jasondavis The dark skin looks great \ud83d\udc4d . @jasondavis It would be great if you publish the design when you're ready!. For me this seems to be a bug since this also appears on other languages like kotlin. It would make sense when this is only for the html code blocks and not for each language.. Groovy looks pretty good, but not really ideal.. Oh, I didn't know that the snippets can have file extension. Great, then this issue is solved, because the markdown snippet is then formatted as a markdown.\nThe only bad thing is that the search isn't working on these markdown files. . ",

Do I use them on a daily basis?\nNo, I dont use Boostnote everyday.\nDo I extensively use tags?\nYes, in every note.\nWhy? What is my use case?\nBecause tags are extremly useful and of top importance.\n\nTo keep things organize\nTo quickly find things without remembering where they are\nTo mark some highlight features of the notes.\n\nexample: I noted down a bunch of sorting algorithm in a Sort Algo notebooks. When I need to find one that I suddenly need, what do I do ? Why should I rummage through my notes instead of typing down something inside the search box? Do I need some algorithm easy to remember? Go search easy-to-remember and bubble sort pops out with the tag that I previously assign to it. Do I need the fastest algorithm? Go search fastest and even while I was just typing fas quick sort pops out. That's how easy it is. \nMoreover, you can dramatically reduce the notebooks you have to create by using tags. Let's say I came accross a jquery code one day and I want to keep using it because it brings a nice transition effect. Do I need to create a notebook Jquery then create a note nice effect in it? Why would I need to do so when I can just place it in my random nice things notebooks with tags like jquery, nice effects ?\n\nMore seriously, I can put priority tags to my notes.\n\nI usually have a notebooks consisting of all my todo lists and tasks of the day. (although I haven't tried this with Boostnote, anyway). Having tags around help me see which things I need to focus on depending on their importance. For example, first thing I need to do tonight is to take my mother out for a ramen, then okonomiyaki. With tags, I can easily assign 1st, 2nd without worrying which one should I eat first.. @huettenhain Sorry, I didnt see yours\n. Yes I can produce this issue on Ubuntu 16.04.2. There must be something wrong, not hotkey conflict with the system because regardless of what you change it into, it just doesn't work. @NourEldin275  I can fix this issue now. Please try to change the default hotkey. In ubuntu many hot keys are already assign to something so my advice is that you should try to avoid keys like Alt or Super . Hi @Alexey-T , I think you should choose the lock option, which will keep the editor active after you returned from another application\n\n. Hi @asmsuechan , are you sure these are all the default shortcuts ?. >  it\u2019s been a while!   \nI was taking a break from github to travel :laughing:   \n\nI using like this sometimes.:fearful:    \n\nYour solution is what i am using too. But don't you see, it's just ugly somehow :cry: . Hi @huettenhain . Sorry for duplicating. Although I really did some research to avoid duplicating issue, I didn't see your issue. I will close this and ref #225 \n\n. Sorry wrong button. I dont use Boost note anymore so I can't confirm. Feel free to treat my issue however you like. @kazup01\nEnvironment : Ubuntu 16.04.2 (Xubuntu to be exact) \nI did try both restart the application and refresh Boostnote with Ctrl + R. I just reinstalled boostnote. Luckily this thing showed up (I didn't see it at first installation) and problem is solved. Feel free to close this issue, but please look into the add storage functionality. There should be some minor problems there \n . ",

    "bimlas": "It seems implemented, issue may be closed.. Sorry, forgot to stop the timer: -9 hours. :(. It seems implemented, issue may be closed.. It seems implemented, issue may be closed.. It seems implemented, issue may be closed (at least when https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1727 is fixed).. Since the note title is taken from the body (the first line of it is) and searching works on it, I think this issue may be closed.. +1, Windows 7. It seems implemented, issue may be closed.. I would love this feature too, like it works on tech.io.. I try to clarify the problem:\nThe note's title in the notes list does not updated when the list is narrowed by search text.\n\n. Issue seems to be solved on 0.11.4.. #1701 solved the issue, could be closed.. I think a basic behaviour can be achieved by\n\nAdding tags to the notes\nGo to \"board\" view\nSelect the tags to be displayed\nEvery tag could list the related notes in columns\n\nMoving the note from one column to another could delete the \"origin\" tag and add the \"target\" tag, thus the note would be listed under the \"target\". Seems to be solved - if you agree, please close the issue.. It seems implemented, issue may be closed.. It's CSS issue, I will try to fix it soon.. I think I just found the steps to reproduce the issue:\n\n\nOpen up Developer Tools\n\nShrink Boostnote to half screen wide (editor gets hidden by Developer Tools)\nMaximize Boostnote\nClick inside then outside of the editor, switch notes, click in it again, etc.\n\n. It seems that is has to be some issue with scrolling: if I open Boostnote, enable Allow editor to scroll past the last line option, then exit from settings, then the rectangle will be exists without the need of shrinking/maximizing the window. It seems to be a CodeMirror bug, but I cannot find it.. Travis CI says:\n\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token } in JSON at position 108\nhttps://travis-ci.org/BoostIO/Boostnote/builds/355745053#L513\n\nIf I'm right, the code syntax is correct and the related test works when tested manually. What's the problem? And why is this related to .boostnoterc?. @Rokt33r Ok, but why the tests are failing if everything seems to be OK? The branch cannot be merged until all of the tests passing.. I see that test fails but when I trying out manually, it works. I have revised the diff and it has to work... :confused: \nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nAs I see the warning about syntax error in JSON and .boostnoterc in the log exists on master too, so it's not related to this PR.\nAnyway: I'm trying to fix it. :+1: \n. Got it - forced push.. I'm not sure, but it may slow down the search - somebody should check it on a big repo (with tags).. Please don't merge it for a while: I think the search methoud could be faster.\njavascript\n    if (block.match(/^#.+/)) {\n      foundNotes = findByTag(foundNotes.slice(0), block).concat(findByWord(foundNotes.slice(0), block))\n    } else {\n      foundNotes = findByWord(foundNotes, block)\n    }\nSearching for a #tag parsing the note's tag list and content. But the \"simple\" word search doing the same (it looks for the word in tags too):\njavascript\nfunction findByWord (notes, block) {\n  const regExp = new RegExp(_.escapeRegExp(block), 'i')\n  return notes.filter((note) => {\n    if (_.isArray(note.tags) && note.tags.some((_tag) => {\n      return _tag.match(regExp)\n    })) {\n      return true\n    }\n    if (note.type === 'SNIPPET_NOTE') {\n      return note.description.match(regExp)\n    } else if (note.type === 'MARKDOWN_NOTE') {\n      return note.content.match(regExp)\n    }\n    return false\n  })\n}\nSo this is a code duplication, thus it can be refactored to one method which could be called only once -> the searching would speed up. Please give me some time to do it.. I'm done - I don't experience speed improvement, but the code became simpler. :smiley: \nEDIT\nMaybe it's faster, but the rendering of the content of the currently opened note makes it laggy. A solution would be to do not open first match until user hits Enter (or clicking on the note title), but it's an other issue.. Just added another test: searching has to find tags without hash symbol too (tag instead of\n#tag).. Ping @Rokt33r: I'm done, the branch may be merged.. @Rokt33r Don't you like that search looks for word in tags too? I think it has to be the behaviour: tags can be used to find content precisely (#javascript #string #print for example), while \"text search\" is used every content related to a given word (even if the note is tagged with this word).. > it fixes more than one thing\nDo you mean the commits or the PR?. How should I split it? It does not adds behaviour, but fixes it + prevents the breaking of it (by adding test cases).. @kampiamodikuesto, what is the expected behaviour? Do you like to embed the file or copy/paste the text itself in to the current note?. Done, ready to merge.. It would be OK, but I'm working on another feature related to tags which needs control buttons, thus I think that the same layout can be used as the control of note list.\n\n. See #1756 - I moved to comments there.. Moved the selector next to the title:\n\n. Sorry, I just typed wrong PR number.. You can check out the working (but ugly) version on my narrow-to-related-tags branch - I will open a PR when it's finished. The plus sign is above the tag currently, because I didn't take care of style yet.. Here's a screencast - the layout is broken, but the behaviour is what I imagined:\n\n. Please explain me. I think this is some kind of \"dynamic table of content\" - for now Boostnote storing notes in bulk, the only method to find a desired note is searching.. Do you mean booleans in query, or...? I'm no sure that I'm understaning your idea. But it would be nice to \"synchronize\" text search with tags list: clicking on a tag should write #tag in to the search field. And it would be more usefull if the taglist would contain the tags of currently listed notes by default (so seraching for a word would refresh the tag list too). I think it would be more consistent and unified. For example I could narrow down the notes list by selecting #pasta and #potato tags from the tag list (thus #pasta #potato would be in the search query), then I could narrow it again by adding spicey to the search query (so the search query is #pasta #potato spicey). It would narrow the tag list to the integridents of spicey foods with pasta and potato.. Maybe a checkbox on the settings page would make the behaviour clear, so this feature would became optional - in this case the plus signs (next to the tag) has to be optional too ->it needs different TagListItem + style.\nI know that this change is big and I agree that a lot of users would don't like it (for first), but it could advantage Boostnote if it would become more unequivocal. I'm not sure how to introduce the feature... Making it optional would smash up the code; making it default would smash up the users.\nI have only one idea: making it default, BUT tag list would be narrowed only if multiple tags are selected. WDYT?. ...I changed my mind: how do you know which tags are related to the currently selected one? OK, another idea: the related tags could have different colors, it would indicate that the currently selected tag are related to those. . @sosukesuzuki Try it out: I changed the behaviour to add plus sign only to related tags, the list is not narrowed. Later I would like to add a setting to let narrowing enabled if the user wants.. Just made the final version, try out #1775, please.. I think that the plus sings does not hurts the users eyes, and adds plus info by marking related tags. The tag list is narrowing optionally. Why would you like to add option to hide the plus sings? I don't see the advanteges of this option. The behaviour does not changing basicly, but improving.. #1775 is merged. :grin: . An advanced implementation was in plan, but it's not merged yet: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1627. You should escape the backquote, because it is used for monospaced text - without backslash it's confusing CodeMirror (the editor).\n\n. @cignoir , please close the issue if this solved your problem.. @NiceKingWei Is it contains very long lines? How many characters has the longest line? You can check the length of the line like this:\n\n. Try to break up to several lines (about 100 chars) - is it slow yet?. There is a similiar issue in Vim too (THE Text Editor), the syntax highlighting method slows down on long lines. I think something like CodeMirror's hardwrap addon should be available in Boostnote (see demo here), but it does not works well with code blocks.. I just changed to use  character to separate tags in path (/tags/currently selected tags) instead of & (/tags/currently&selected&tags) to prevent interference with tags containing this char (black&white). See commit message. I think it's stable enough to get merged.. Changed the behaviour: does not narrowing the list.\n. Just made the final version:\n. If it's ok, then I'll try to write tests.. Should I write tests in a different PR or this one is not finished without those?. I'm so sorry, but it's too hard for me: Boostnote is the very first React / Electron / whatever project for me and I'm just a beginner in the Javascript world, thus writing such tests is nearly impossible. All what I did is modifying Jest test.. Rebased, fixed.. What do you think about https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1775#issuecomment-380344905? It gives the ability to navigate in your notes like you do in a directory tree.. @shunchuan The trash is located on the top-left:\n\n. It doesn't hurting my eyes, btw I'm not sure that feasible, but adding drag-n-drop option to the list items exactly would be an improvement.. I think it's not a bug:\n- indent level: 0 -> 0\n- def indent level: +1 -> 1\n- ... do indent level: +1 -> 2\n- end indent level: -1 -> 1\nSo you opened two blocks (def, do), but closed only one (do).. The finder feature is discarded (#1479), use the search entry by hitting Ctrl-F.. Storing notes in a native (Markdown) format would solve the problem in my opinion; browser extensions (like Markdown Viewer can be used to preview as HTML.. Well... Actually it's not working, becuse images directory is outside of notes dir, thus paths to the images are not relative, for example:   ![dojocat.jpg](\\\\:storage\\\\0.1knz98wx582j.jpg). If the paths would become relative, then images could work.\n. Since Boostnote is using CodeMirror as editor, the syntax highlighting depends on it; you can find list of supported languages on CodeMirror's language modes.. How do you highlighting text? o_O. Sorry, I misunderstood this: \"Mark word works out of code block\" - I thougth you are doing this in Boostnote.. If you think about the rendered document, it would be possible by using Asciidoctor :heart: (markup language like Markdown), but it's currently not supported :sob:.. Maybe this tread helps: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1879. Just tried out a fresh install and the most recent Git version too on Windows 7: icons are shown in both.. I think this is related to https://issuehunt.io/repos/53266139/issues/184 thus @kschiffer could get the reward.. Refactored + deleted console.log -> forced push.. You are right, I will refactor it.. Just realized that there is no problem with the original logic, but there are a LOT of duplicates in store.js. Refactoring in progress, but please notify me if I'm doing it wrong.. I think I'm finished: I did what I can.. @kazup01, please change to 'in review' state, I'm finished.. It's already reported: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1878\nPS.: Please write more descriptive title in the future, for example \"Link tag opens web page in preview area\".. Done.. Sorry, I just rebased to older master, now I fixed the conflict.. Fixed linting problems, forced push.. Just added style to the arrow:\n\nChanged the color to a softer one\nRemoved the gray background\nChanged the mouse pointer\n\n\n. There is a code duplication, but my knowledge is not enough to refactor in to one method: getting tag list in completion menu and in sidenav.. Please wait before merging, I will rebase on master when #1955 gets merged.. Rebased to master, I'm done.. Run yarn install to update Electron (#1955).. Here's the output of yarn info if it helps - BTW I'm on Windows 7 x64, but I will try it on Linux.\n```cson\nyarn info v1.5.1\n{ name: 'boost',\n  description: 'Robust pipeline for creating build

Just tried out on Linux, it works.. @sosukesuzuki Can you please check it on Mac?. Can you please check now?\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/6cad2ab4df1143a9d46d231e14cb0ae5e5465cf0/package.json#L20. @Rokt33r tested it, does not works.. Closing, because #2320 solved the issue.. Benefits:\n- Scroll sync is not an issue anymore (#1811)\nDisadvanteges:\n- Markdown is defacto, additional markup languages are not welcome (Asciidoc, ReStructuredText, etc.). Related issue: #236 . I think it's an overkill: Why don't you creating a shell script / Windows .bat file for it? For example this will start calc.exe and Boostnote in paralell:\nboost.bat\nstart calc.exe\nstart %LOCALAPPDATA%\\boost\\Boostnote.exe. CodeMirror is updated in #2146, issue can be closed.. I think it's OK, but it should be a third option: tags starting with uppercase letter has a special meaning for me, thus I like to find those easily.. Because this is the behaviour (in the current release too): it's looking for the searched word in tags too.. Is this the correct way to hide the selector when the sidebar is too narrow?. Just forgot to remove, thanks for pointing it out!. ",
    "kazuhisya": "@kazup01 Sorry, it's No. I am certainly not a JavaScript expert.\nIMHO, it could be implemented simply with HTML5 input autocomplete Attribute, but it does not seem to work. (on browser/main/Detail/TagSelect.js)\nIn react environment it seems necessary to think a bit more and implement it\u2026.. @asmsuechan Thank you for your reply!\nIt does not seem to have authority to rebuild with travis-ci..\nI try to \"close and reopen\" it and trigger again.. Oops,  I seem to have made Travis angry..... @asmsuechan Hi,\nI see, no problem at all.\nSo I hope that you guys well be ready!\nThank you.. @kazup01 Hi, thank you so much for notify me with such great news!\n.rpm package is created in the grunt build process. It is just after creating .deb package.\nAnyway, updating document is a good idea. where should it be written? wiki or docs/build.md ?\n. @kazup01 Thank you for reply.\nand it's OK, I will write and PR it later.. @RatanShreshtha  Hi,\nIt does not seem to be ready yet.\nPlease check this PR. #266\nAs a temporary solution, you will be able to use this gist.. @alefisico Hi, it is already on the documents. so may be of your help.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/docs/build.md#make-own-distribution-packages-deb-rpm. It sounds lovely!\nBut, about the second proposal(2, Can make tags inside markdown note and snippet title.), I can't image the behavior yet.\nFor example, in the case of Markdown notes, how does it behave?. ",
    "tatoosh": "Autocomplete should be very nice!. Please add the support for mermaid!. @asmsuechan thx for the code.\nDo you also have a windows snippet?. Any changes so far for the native app without script?. Same here: Windows 10 x64 with Boostnote v0.8.16.\nI just have to create a first empty note.. Please commit. Will u also include CSS ?. THX @nlopin!\nDo you have an option for Export CSS, so Form dark theme the Export will transformed to white?. If you are on Windows try this solution called portable mode #344 in development by ##1129. Also it would be to get a clean print/pdf with white background even if you r using the dark theme.. Or you can give as the option for a print.css so we can build a custom export like pandoc can to it\n\npandoc --css=styling.css --to=html5 input.md -o output.html. What abput global hotkeys for example new boostnote ?. nobody else need this?\n. I mean to save a historyoft all changes like Version control vor a timeline. . Ok thx @kazup01 but that is not for source code and standard markdown headers.. Not the best implementation i think but this is workable for markdown: https://atom.io/packages/markdown-toc. THX . Thx @trinode that helped me.. Nice feature in vscode. . not working, i created bug #2275 . Good idea. Seems to be the same, THX for linking. . Switch to fullscreen, is that enough?. It would be nice to set the url. So i can use my selfhosted gitlab as issue link.. i tested it on windows 10 x64, there is no problem\n\n\n. I am using the first snippet always as markdown documentation, so the toggle should be nice at markdown Syntax. . if there will be an option for encryption the mobile app also need it!. External CSS are also not a good solution, why not including it in the header?\nThe image ptioblem also exists.. @Rokt33r\nThanks for the discussion. \nI am using makrdown for large documentation and an Export in a single HTML file could be transered to other people. Also a single file can be stored in a document management system. \nPandoc exports for example supports that single file html5 Export.. Of course fonts are optional. CSS and images should be included. . Or u can support Export to script / Export to pandoc?. No, please we not need cloud storage or make that optional! The notes should be stored only on our systems.\nAgain, please take a look at pandoc, including images and CSS is not a Problem there. I will upload u a sample if that helps?. @nlopin i will generate it tomorrow and give u the result here.. @nlopin \nHere is my demo single HTML5 page for u - including custom.css and images.\nI created it with pandoc (over visual studio code extension, could also be a script call).\nImages are base64 coded so u will get a working single file export!\nhtml\n<img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABD0AAAJdCAIAAAC\n... \ntest.zip\nMy pandoc parameters:\n\n-f gfm+hard_line_breaks -t html5 -c D:\\pandoc\\mycustom.css --self-contained -t html5 -A D:\\pandoc\\footer.html\"\n. Good way, both options would helped me a lot!. Thanks for the reference. But then this is a bug, i reproduced it today in Windows 10.. > @tatoosh can you do me a favor and check if this features works for you with the newest boostnote version??\n\nThx, it is working for single notes. But it would be nice to configure the output folder. Normally i am using assets subfolder.. Great idea!\nMaybe we cann call a script so i can build my szenario:\n\nsync gitlab\nAuto Export / Import files\nsync gitlab. great idea!. or better ro a right click context menu i think. @ZeroX-DG: We're writing documentations as markdown. So by exporting them i can save the export in gitlab wiki or a document management system.\n. I want to organise the snippets in different bostnote notes. \nSo i have to write a batch script or will you stay my request?. thx @OnlineVagrant, that worked\n\nmaybe there can be a hint in the software by selecting the menu item??. linked #2273 . Last stabile windows, musst be 0.11.8. Yes, my whole boostnote storage is in my nextcloud folder. But in mobile App u van Not Chance folder. Also the boostnote extension is Not a default ohne, so a 3rd Party app can Not open the files directly.. linked to #2202. ",
    "daiyam": "This feature has been completed with #2320 and #2400.. @ZeroX-DG I would like to add an option to add or not the metadata into the YAML front matter.\nBut where to place that option? Not in the Interface tab, maybe in a new tab Export?. What about those options?\n \nBetter labels are welcome \ud83d\ude09 . @ecvgit I've just done the PR #2612 to be able to export with the metadata.. I've made the PR #2597 to do just that.\nHere the shortcuts:\n'Cmd-E C': 'foldAll'\n'Cmd-E X': 'unfoldAll'\n'Cmd-E 1': 'foldLevel1'\n'Cmd-E 2': 'foldLevel2'\n'Cmd-E 3': 'foldLevel3'\n'Cmd-E 4': 'foldLevel4'\n'Cmd-E 5': 'foldLevel5'\n'Cmd-E 6': 'foldLevel6'\n'Cmd-E 7': 'foldLevel7'\n'Cmd-E 8': 'foldLevel8'\n'Cmd-E 9': 'foldLevel9'\nWhat do you think?. @vcvetkovs I will use the same shortcuts as VSC (Ctrl+K Ctrl+0, Ctrl+K Ctrl+J, Ctrl+K Ctrl+1, ...).\nBut I will add the option to be able to change them so we can have those we like \ud83d\ude09 . @vcvetkovs I've added the following configurable shortcuts:\n\n. The bug is due to CommonMark (HTML-Block condition 6) which markdown-it is following at the letter.\nremark doesn't suffer from this issue. So it should be fixed when #1563 is done.. @OnlineVagrant now with Mermaid you can do a diagram like that with :\nmermaid\n    graph LR\n    A(( )) --> |\"P(A)\"| B((\"P(A)\"))\n    A --> |\"P(\u0100)\"| C((\"P(\u0100)\"))\n    B --> |\"P(B|A)\"| D((\"P(B|A)\"))\n    B --> |\"P(B\u0304|A)\"| E((\"P(B\u0304|A)\"))\n    C --> |\"P(B|\u0100)\"| F((\"P(B|\u0100)\"))\n    C --> |\"P(B\u0304|\u0100)\"| G((\"P(B\u0304|\u0100)\"))\n    \nBut the height of the diagram can be problematic. Bug #2335. @OnlineVagrant I've the PR #2585 which fixes the height of mermaid diagrams.\nIt gives me that:\n\nWould that be enough for your usage?. No scrolling issue on macOS with a mouse or a trackpad.\n@Mindstormer619 are you still getting the bug with the newest version?. Hi, I was checking this feature which looks good but I found an issue: when navigating, it's saving a note even if I was just seeing.\nAbout the history menu, as it is, the navigation buttons are good for me. But maybe for other people,  a drop down menu can be added between the 2 arrows. In the menu, the current note can be marked as active.. @SubtleParesh A note shouldn't be marked as updated when we only view it.. @SubtleParesh, the history is being hiding by the preview (maybe due to some changes in the master)\nYes,  I agree whatever we edit or preview a note, that note should be added to the history.\nBut you should save a note only when we are editing it.\nHere a part of the problematic code:\nif (back.past.length > 7) {\n  back.past.splice(0, 1)\n  this.setState({\n    backStack: back\n  }, () => {\n    this.save()\n  })\n}\nIt should just be:\nif (back.past.length > 7) {\n  back.past.splice(0, 1)\n  this.setState({\n    backStack: back\n  })\n}. @SubtleParesh thanks\nThe history menu seems to have problems with notes with the same title (only show one) and notes without title.\nThe next button is not disabled when reading the lastest note.. @urda this seems to have been fixed. Can you retest it?. @cristophercutas are you still having the issue? I can't reproduce it.. It's a problem with codemirror which don't like the closing ` on the new line.\nThe highlight in the editor show how the inline code block is detected. When in the preview, the result is fine.\n\n. @tatoosh I've made the PR #2595 to resolve your issue. Visually, it's close.. @fleksin Not sure what's going on. But I've tested with the same versions of the app and macOS; the emoji panel is correctly showing up.\nMaybe try the following: (from an Apple thread)\nOnce I quit Safari, if I go in to Activity Monitor and quit Emojis & Symbols, then it will work\njust fine in Finder and all other apps -  until I open Safari again.\nor\n```\nTo fix the problem trash these two files and then restart:\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.CharacterPicker.plist\n~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.CharacterPaletteIM.plist\n```. @modmod24 This is a system panel so it shouldn't be. But there is something similar on ubuntu (not tested).. @fleksin does emoji panel correctly open in other applications?. @ZeroX-DG I've fixed the issue. @Rokt33r I've fixed the conflicts. @modmod24 no, it does make sense. But what about the existing tags?\nMaybe the option saveTagsAlphabetically should be added or should replace showTagsAlphabetically.\nThat option is shown with a warning that by selecting it, it would sort the existing tags.\nThere might be a performance issue since we will have to re-save all the notes; same issue when we will be able to rename a tag...\n. @modmod24 I will add the option saveTagsAlphabetically as you have described.\nBut I will keep the option showTagsAlphabetically so it will be up to the user to select which one to select. Is that ok?. @Rokt33r here some screenshots to explain it better:\nWhen enableLiveNoteCounts is off (by default):\n\nWhen enableLiveNoteCounts is on:\n\nThe count on bug isn't shown because there is no notes with feature and bug tags.\nThe count on table is 1 instead of 4 because only one note has both feature and table tags.. @ZeroX-DG good idea! It's done.. @Rokt33r ya, a React component would be better but Awesomplete was faster to integrate.. @Rokt33r I removed awesomplete and replaced it with react-autosuggest.. @Rokt33r I've submit the pull request #2400 to fix it.. @ehhc thx.

Mais nous avons une demande :\nMerci de founir une capture d'\u00e9cran de Boostnote avec l'outil de d\u00e9veloppement ouvert\n(vous pouvez l'ouvrir avec Ctrl+Shift+I)\nMerci d'avance pour votre aide.\n\u00c0 propos des droits d'auteurs des Pull Requests\nSi vous faites un Pull Request, cela signifie que vous acceptez de transf\u00e9rer les droits d'auteur du code modifi\u00e9 \u00e0 BoostIO.\nCela ne veut pas dire que Boostnote deviendra une application payante. Si nous voulons gagner de l'argent, nous trouverons d\u2019autres m\u00e9thodes, comme un service de sauvegarde sur le Cloud, une application mobile ou des options payantes.\nPuisque GPL v3 est trop stricte pour \u00eatre compatible avec une autre licence, nous pensons que cela sera n\u00e9cessaire pour la remplacer par une licence plus libre (comme BSD, MIT).\n```. @ChrisK91 here what I get with the PR #2585:\n\n. @hsiehjack you are right. Thx. Here is a screenshot of the change:\n\n. A better fix is available at #2394. @Rokt33r I've added a test and fixed a bug found due to it.. @Rokt33r I've resolved the conflicts. @Rokt33r I've made the merge but I wasn't able to test. On the master, when I do yarn dev, I'm getting Electron: bad option: --hot out of the blue... or on an older version, it doesn't start...\nI've broken something on my machine.... @Rokt33r I did tried, even removing yarn and electron caches. But then, I remembered, I've install some Python scripts. Not sure, what was the problem, but it was fixed after a reboot... :pensive:\nI've made a small change in the styl file.. @sosukesuzuki I've added the test.. @sosukesuzuki It's because you have an empty line before it.\n\nThe front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines.\nJekyll Doc\n\nHere some examples of use. @ZeroX-DG I've replaced the plugin with my own plugin so that delimiter must be 3 dashes.. @ZeroX-DG yes, it's better to display the invalid front-matter. ~~~\nphp\n~~~. oh! Sorry about that! That should be fairly simple. I will take a look.. @gavvvr I can't replicate the issue.. @OndragKlaus, you are right the pipe in the url is causing an issue.\nBut I think it's an issue inherent to Markdown so it can't be fixed in Boostnote.\nI've tried different Markdown editors and all have the same issue (even GitHub).\nMy test code:\n| url | description |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Boostnote | Boost](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote)    | Boostnote |\n| url | description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Boostnote | Boost    | Boostnote |\nBut you can replace the pipe with &#124; to have:\n| url | description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Boostnote | Boost    | Boostnote |\n. @OndragKlaus you are right \\| might be better for reading.\nThe best would be that the title extraction replaces the | with \\| only when it's in a table.. @heihachi88 it's a Windows 10 issue since update to Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17751 seems to fix it.. @heihachi88 it should be in October since its other name is Windows 10 October 2018 Update. @Rokt33r I've resolved the conflicts. @ZeroX-DG oops, my bad. I've fixed it.. @AlexisEspinosaGayosso @ghazal you should just install the newer version available here.\nWhat's the problem? . @ghazal yes, I also had the problem. I wonder if it's not a problem with github or aws since the first download couldn't finish.... @OnlineVagrant you will need to build the app from source here the doc\nWe should wait for the final release of KaTex-v0.10 which should be soon.. @ZeroX-DG @vwrs I was also unable to reproduce this bug on mac.\n@vwrs If you reload the window or restart the app, which theme is being used? Could you expand the config objects in the console before and after the change of the theme? . @vwrs you are right. ~/.boostnoterc takes precedence over the Preferences.\nIf the user use ~/.boostnoterc, the preferences may need to be saved into that file.\n@vwrs @ZeroX-DG what do you think?. @Rokt33r @ZeroX-DG should I make the change?. @ZeroX-DG nothing much more...\nIt's just that Boostnote reads the preferences from the localStorage then ~/.boostnoterc but writes only to the localStorage.\nI think that if the user use ~/.boostnoterc, Boostnote should read and write the preferences only from that file.. @ZeroX-DG same here, I was wondering if it was by design or not... that's why I asked :wink:. @ZeroX-DG I've pushed the fix. @ZeroX-DG it's done. @Rokt33r all done. @100ideas the 1200 is just a fallback if there is no width (in a display:none). \nBut the problem is that it's using the width of the window as its width.. @100ideas I've found a way to fix this. You can test it with the PR #2585.. I've tested it with the preferences scroll past the last line.\nI've added the support to the preference When scrolling, synchronize preview with editor.\nIt's working fine.. @Aaron-Bird not by me \ud83d\ude09 . For:\n<$>[note]\n**Note:** This is a note.\n<$>\nYou could use:\n!!! note\n**Note:** This is a note.\n!!!\nif empty title was allowed (should be allowed). But\n~~~\n[secondary_label Output]\nCould not connect to Redis at 127.0.0.1:6379: Connection refused\n~~~\nmight be done with something like:\n~~~\n(secondary_label=\"Output\")\nCould not connect to Redis at 127.0.0.1:6379: Connection refused\n~~~\n.

Yes, more opinions are welcome.. @XarisA I guest but @ is also used to do mentions in GFM. So it could be also confusing \ud83d\ude09 . @Rokt33r The error is here: \n. duplicate of #2397, it's fixed in the next release.. @jacobherrington Thanks for your translation \ud83d\ude03 . @ZeroX-DG I agree with you since the tests are heavy.. @graemearthur Here the correct markdown to reproduce the issue:\n```\n\nyes, even hidden code blocks!\n| TYPE        | LINUX           |Windows|\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| Dell | This is a test | Test |\n| HP   | Test |   Still testing |\n\n. @graemearthur It should work if you choose `Allow dangerous html` for the preference `Sanitization`.. Because\n?> ## Click to expand\n?>\n?> whatever\nis more readable than\n\n## Click to expand\n  whatever\n\n```\n. I've removed the custom styling.\n\nAnd for why I'm adding a new block is that I find that html code is not reader friendly. So I always try to avoid html code.. @Airgunster it is done in the next release. @Airgunster it will be in the next release of Boostnote.. I've updated the PR to support markdown image syntax inside the gallery block.\n~~~\ngallery(20h)\n:storage/3b6f8bd6-4edd-4b15-96e0-eadc4475b564/fad71156.jpg\ngallery(20h)\n![#5.jpg](:storage/3b6f8bd6-4edd-4b15-96e0-eadc4475b564/f939b2c3.jpg)\n~~~\n. The scrollbar issue is due to the component. I will try to look at it when I have time.. I have updated the styling to use the standard one:\n\n. The webp conversion is no good. It will cause some issues when exporting (bad extension, image not recognized by the system). @ZeroX-DG I've updated how to calculate the alternative color. Now, it's used a mix of the background color with a little bit of the text color.. @federicochiesa please update manually. There is a bug in the update process. #2376. @Zuuja check the preference Allow preview to scroll past the last line in Interface/Preview. @kapad try by setting the preference Switch to Preview to On Right Click, it should be better \ud83d\ude09 . @crakoucas I was thinking more about the v2.0.11 but v3.0.3 is even better.\nBut sadly, there is a small bug due to it (when the window is restored, its size is wrong).\nHere the patch to fix it:\n```diff\ndiff --git a/dev-scripts/dev.js b/dev-scripts/dev.js\nindex 000a1bfd..9698a2fe 100644\n--- a/dev-scripts/dev.js\n+++ b/dev-scripts/dev.js\n@@ -49,7 +49,7 @@ function startServer () {\n }\nfunction startElectron () {\n-  spawn(electron, ['--hot', './index.js'])\n+  spawn(electron, ['--hot', './index.js'], { stdio: 'inherit' })\n     .on('close', () => {\n       server.close()\n     })\ndiff --git a/lib/main-window.js b/lib/main-window.js\nindex fa54d5ce..86b70bea 100644\n--- a/lib/main-window.js\n+++ b/lib/main-window.js\n@@ -14,6 +14,7 @@ const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({\n   y: windowSize.y,\n   width: windowSize.width,\n   height: windowSize.height,\n+  useContentSize: true,\n   minWidth: 500,\n   minHeight: 320,\n   autoHideMenuBar: showMenu,\n```. @crakoucas it's good for me (on macOS).. @carugnom I have the PR #2454 which should complete your request \ud83d\ude04 . @carugnom I've just tested it. It's also work on storage. \ud83d\ude09 . I could add an option so that new notes use the selected tags or not. Would it be ok?. here we go \ud83d\ude09 . @ZeroX-DG sadly, no. The issue is on master...\nIf you add console.log(location.pathname) at the top of the method tagListComponent(line 209) in the file /Boostnote/browser/main/SideNav/index.js, when you select the second tag, you will see in the console:\n/tags/now hello\n/tags/now%20hello\n/tags/now%20hello\n/tags/now%20hello\nBeside the fact that the list is updated 4 times for 1 click, you can see that the spaces have been replaced by %20, so the code can't get individual tags (it splits on space...).\nIt happens since the merge Merge pull request #2484 from crakoucas/fix-electron-glibc-segmentation-fault (106caf2b3e960acf3f7d8ba808c802e3e52eb9f9).\nMaybe due to the newer electron.... @ZeroX-DG I've made the PR #2600 to fix the issue on master.. @ZeroX-DG I like the template but I find the progress bar due to the checkboxes to be a little puzzling... . @ZeroX-DG I have removed the - before the checkboxes in the PR #2506.

When will it be merged?. @ZeroX-DG I will. @makdiuk I've fixed the issues in the PR #2506\nHere the fixed example:\n\n. @sharif1093 I've the PR #2314 which almost does that \ud83d\ude09 . @empeje Can you paste your example as text? Because I'm unable to reproduce the bug.. @empeje I don't have the issue on the last version 0.11.11. I've just seen that you are using an old version.. @Rokt33r this fix should be merged into the master ASAP :flushed:. Well, the badges are usually on the left. And the link is missing.. why not with more badges \ud83d\ude09 . @ZeroX-DG yes, I'm ok with the centered badge.\n@jhdcruz can you fix the link \ud83d\ude09 . @mitchellm44 this repo uses yarn. Refer to Build documentation. Thx. @ZeroX-DG  It could be done with the attribute data-line. I've added the support for the new preferences fields introduced by #2586\n\n. @pihentagy I have the PR #2597 for that :wink:. @pihentagy You will be able to change them. Even those aren't the ones I'm using.... @Rokt33r this PR should be merged for the next release since it fixes a serious bug with the tag list.. @jhit the glibc issue is already fixed by #2484 but an update to the Electron 3.0.8 is welcome \ud83d\ude04 . No reason but the Prefix attachment folder is not a Markdown thing.. Sorry, I'm the sinful who have made the bug. :sob:\nIt've just created the PR #2622 to fix it. :pensive:. @wAuner sorry about that. The fix has been merged into the master branch so it will be fixed in the next release.. I can't reproduce none of them... The second one might be due to the rerendering of the full page (I can't find any transition animation).\n@infosisio What is your system? Which theme are you using?. @hsiehjack please use the existing config (browser/main/lib/ConfigManager.js). @hsiehjack Are you planning the make the change? It would be good to have your PR.. @weaming what are your preferences? I can't reproduce the bug.\n@ZeroX-DG were you able to reproduce it?. @reyes-c1 thanks for the tip, now I can reproduce the bug... I just need to paste the code on TextEdit, then copy/paste into Boostnote.\nAs you said, Boostnote paste it as an HTML text (it isn't) which alters the text.\nI think, in a code block, the pasted text should always be text (no HTML pre-processing).\n@ZeroX-DG @weaming @reyes-c1 what do you think?. @weaming the issue is that the editor has been improved to generate markdown code when pasting html but it should be disable inside code block... If I have time this week-end, I will propose a PR to fix the current issue.. I've proposed a fix. It would be great if you could test it.. @ZeroX-DG what do you think?. OK, I will add both options :smile: maybe tomorrow.... I've made the update :wink:\nI've added the option to enable/disable to paste as HTML\n\nand the shortcut to do it even if it's disabled\n\nAlso, the images, as Data URI, can be recognized as image by the smart paste.. This is a duplicate of #2628. The fix has already been merged so it will be fixed in the next release.. I've added the option to enable/disable to paste as HTML\n\nand the shortcut to do it even if it's disabled\n\nBut the major change is that instead of using the browser's clipboard, it uses the electron's clipboard (so the code can be shared between the new shortcut and Ctrl+V).\nSo, when pasting smartly, it can also recognize images in Data URI.\n. @richardtks if the copied data is some html code (from navigator or styled terminal), it convert the it as markdown code (h1 becomes an heading). But it won't convert if it's pasted in a code block.. I've merged the previous PR #2473 into this one.. @edl7878 is this PR not working on Windows?. @Rokt33r is it from a browser or Explorer?. @Rokt33r I've found the issue. It's in the function copyAttachment(), the method path.extname() is called with the complete url. So with an url like http://..../image.jpg?random=query, it's give the extension.jpg?random=query.... @Rokt33r your issue should be fixed but you should test it to make sure \ud83d\ude09 . @Rokt33r @ehhc I've added the tests on urls.\nI also had to fix the other tests so they are correctly testing the function.. @Rokt33r what were you doing? Because the log is normal if there were no images in the note.. @Rokt33r I found an issue with Firefox\nIn the following screenshot, the first \"HTML\" is from Firefox and the second is from Chromium.\n\n. @Rokt33r I've tested on Ubuntu and it should be fine.. To be able to customize CodeMirror shortcuts would be great.\nBut for that many, the keyboard shortcut manager of Visual Studio Code would be a good reference.. @gitname I've improve my PR #2612 to fix the issue. Can you test it?. @gitname you can follow that doc. Thx. @blackredscarf I've improve my PR #2612 to fix the issue. Can you test it?. It's a duplicate of #2582. @ZeroX-DG I've made the change. @Rokt33r please don't forget the tag \ud83d\ude09 . @roymuste you are right the issue is due to the panel to not be wide enough\n@ZeroX-DG this issue won't be easily fix because of the abuse of position:absolute. Unless we force the minimal width.. @payacoub you don't need to enable the \"smart paste\". Instead, you can use Ctrl+Shift+V.. @ehhc when pasting an image, there is 2 cases:\n- the clipboard has the data uri as text and the image as an object (example: copy image from google image)\n- the clipboard has only the image as an object (example: copy image from boostnote.io)\nIn the first case, a Ctrl+V gives you the data uri and a Ctrl+Shift+V gives the image\nIn the second case,  a Ctrl+Shift+V gives the image. \nSo Ctrl+Shift+V always give you the image.\nThere is 2 possible improvements:\n- in the second case,Ctrl+V should also give the data uri\n- in both cases, Ctrl+V should give the image (the data uri can't be pasted)\nWhat do you think?. @ehhc @Rokt33r I thought the extra possibility to be able to paste data uri would be good for some users.\nSo if Ctrl+V has to paste images, I don't mind.\n. @ehhc I don't have any real use case.\nI was more thinking:\n- Ctrl+V pastes only text\n- Ctrl+Shift+V pastes image, HTML or text\nBut if Ctrl+V has to paste images, I really don't mind \ud83d\ude09 \n. @Rokt33r Should I change the Ctrl+V's behaviour to paste images?. @Rokt33r I've made the PR #2747 to fix that.. @PuerorumOne please update to the last version, it has been fixed since the v0.11.10 \ud83d\ude09 . @BjarkePedersen please use Cmd+Shift+V for the time being when pasting an image. Adding a cache and a delay between each update should be fairly simple.. For the editor or the UI?. @DictumMortuum here what I have for the UI\n\n. I've made the following theme based on my coding theme:\n\n@ZeroX-DG @Rokt33r should I go forward with those themes?. @Rokt33r yes, I've only colorized the UI with my VSCode theme.. @Rokt33r I've created the PR #2879 for Nord UI theme. I've also created the PR #2880 for my theme.\nI've quite a bit of changes so you can easily add new UI themes.. @DictumMortuum I just need to figure out how to successfully load a new editor theme.... @DictumMortuum here you are \ud83d\ude09 . @payacoub I have the PR #2405 fixing that issue but it still need some works. @payacoub I've finished my PR #2405 but it still need to be reviewed :wink:. @ZeroX-DG I'm not sure about that issue. But the PR #2405 fixes the issue when the cursor position isn't shown in the preview (like in screenshot 1).. thanks. @elfman could you use the PR template \ud83d\ude09 \nAlso could you rename your dictionary config.tag with a more explicit name and update the comment of modified functions.. The line 36 of browser/components/NoteItem.js has not been fixed, yet \ud83d\ude09 . @elfman it's ok for me. @HatterTheMadd it seems that you should create snippet notes instead of markdown notes (which use the markdown language where #, *, - are keywords)\nIn the preferences, you can change the default type of the note (ask, markdown or snippet) and the default language of a snippet note.. @chartotu19 could you try the last version?. @chartotu19 are you using Dropbox to synchronize your notes?. @ZeroX-DG the issue seems to be related to this line: boostnote-mobile/app/views/note/DropboxNoteModal.js, line 18. @ZeroX-DG I'm not sure about those \"security\" issues.... @ZeroX-DG OK for Buffer.\nI retook a look at the error for the RexExp but I think they are false positive. related issue\n\nfor /^(?:\\w+:)?\\/\\/([^\\s\\.]+\\.\\S{2}|localhost[\\:?\\d]*)\\S*$/, the issue is due to (?:\\w+:)?\nfor /^(.*?)(?:\\s*!important)?$/, it is for (?:\\s*!important)?. @ehhc the function fixLocalURLS works on the HTML code so the \\ should be generated as %5C. Is it the case?\nI don't have a working windows so I was unable to test it. I did assume the tests were correct (mdurl.encode(path.win32.sep)).. @ehhc what is the generated html?\nThe simpler regex assumes that an image path was terminated by an \" which is no longer the case due to the added gallery block.. @ehhc I found the error in the regex, pretty stupid :sob:\nAnd thanks you for the updated tests (they are failing correctly with the bad regex). @zzxxhhzxh if you look at your jpg, you will see that in reality, it's an png. When pasting or dropping an image, Boostnote tries to fix its rotation (PR #2322), to do that, it converts the image as png... Ideally, there should be an option to disable this behaviour.\nYou should open a new issue if you would like it to be fixed.. The problem with the regex '/?' + STORAGE_FOLDER_PLACEHOLDER + '.*?\"' is the usage of the terminator \".\n\nFor an image, it generates <img src=\"<path>\", so the path is correctly found.\nFor a gallery, it generates:\n<div class=\"gallery\">\npath1\npath2\npath3\n</div>\nIn that case, the paths won't be found.. @ehhc, here the fixed regex:\n``\nfunction fixLocalURLS (renderedHTML, storagePath) {\n  /*\n    A :storage reference is like:storage/3b6f8bd6-4edd-4b15-96e0-eadc4475b564/f939b2c3.jpg`.\n- `STORAGE_FOLDER_PLACEHOLDER` will match `:storage`\n- `(?:(?:\\\\\\/|%5C)[-.\\\\w]+)+` will match `/3b6f8bd6-4edd-4b15-96e0-eadc4475b564/f939b2c3.jpg`\n- `(?:\\\\\\/|%5C)[-.\\\\w]+` will either match `/3b6f8bd6-4edd-4b15-96e0-eadc4475b564` or `/f939b2c3.jpg`\n- `(?:\\\\\\/|%5C)` match the path seperator. `\\\\\\/` for posix systems and `%5C` for windows.\n\n*/\n  return renderedHTML.replace(new RegExp('/?' + STORAGE_FOLDER_PLACEHOLDER + '(?:(?:\\\\/|%5C)[-.\\w]+)+', 'g'), function (match) {\n    var encodedPathSeparators = new RegExp(mdurl.encode(path.win32.sep) + '|' + mdurl.encode(path.posix.sep), 'g')\n    return match.replace(encodedPathSeparators, path.sep).replace(new RegExp('/?' + STORAGE_FOLDER_PLACEHOLDER, 'g'), 'file:///' + path.join(storagePath, DESTINATION_FOLDER))\n  })\n}\n```\nI've forgot that the \\w doesn't include the -...\nAnyway, thanks for the updated tests.. @Rokt33r go ahead to merge this PR to fix the urgent bug.\nI will do another PR with the regex fixed and some tests for the gallery.. @Rokt33r I already have the PR #2642 to fix the issue you are getting \ud83d\ude09 . @ehhc @Rokt33r I've made the PR #2848 to fix the regex. @noklam the issue seems to be with windows style URL :storage\\xxx\\xxx instead of :storage/xxx/xxx.. @noklam I will try to make a fix this week-end. Yes, you are right.\nI've checked markdown-it-front-matter and at first there is Indicated by three or more dashes: ---\nIt was what I tough but I've check some libraries and all of them use a must be ---.. No accident, the plugin needs it or it won't work... It used so we can parse the front-matter to extract the properties. But since we don't need to do that, the code block is empty.. @ZeroX-DG thanks! I did learn something today The for-of loop. I did know the for-of loop but I didn't know I could use const for the iterator. (Since the loop do change the value/address of the variable). @ZeroX-DG I removed the errors for every diagram (chart, flowchart, mermaid and sequence).\nI've also fixed a bug with the line number...\nBut I can't replicated the visual bug you are getting...\nHere what I get:\n\nHere my preferences:\n\n. Here my fix:\n\n. better: \"Blog Address\": \"Adresse du blog\",. better: \"Blog Type\": \"Type du blog\",. correct: \"Snippet name\": \"Nom du snippet\",. correct: \"Snippet prefix\": \"Pr\u00e9fixe du snippet\". @ehhc it's not possible\nrequire('../browser/main/lib/dataApi/attachmentManagement') throws the error Cannot find module 'browser/lib/findStorage'\nhyperlink.js is loaded by Chromium\nattachmentManagement.js is written to be loaded by node. @ehhc sure, I can do that. @crakoucas can you update it to the lastest one.

    "iliyang": "I just want to add that the Typora way of writing Markdown, and LaTeX equations (!!), is the best I've seen so far. You only see the Markdown source for the element you're currently editing, everything else on the page is rendered to beautiful HTML. And that's what you in most cases want to see (at least I do). \nAnother important technical advantage of Typora's approach is that it enables fast and responsive editing of large files. Because Typora knows which part of the document you're editing, only that part needs to be re-rendered to HTML when it's changed -- not the entire document as with any other Markdown editing-with-live-preview app. This makes up for a really fast and fluid experience.\nI encourage everyone to try Typora (and also typeset some math equations in it) just to get a feel of this workflow. I love it.. Here's my take on it as a power user:\nWhat do I want to be looking at: a beautifully typeset document\nWhat do I want to be editing: markup (i.e. Markdown source)\nWYSIWYG editing doesn't always give full control and therefore a piece of mind either. That's why I don't care much for WYSIWYG editors like Evernote, which is horrible and buggy.\nTypora gives me both of the above. It is not a WYSIWYG editor, because you edit the actual markup. But the the key is that you only see the markup of what you're currently editing. Which, if you think about it, is what you want most of the time. And which also allows you to handle large documents with Typora, because it never has to recompile the whole document as it knows which part you're touching and recompiles only that.\nTypora does have a \"Source Code Mode\" that allows you to see and touch the full source! Though most of the time you don't need to use it.\nAnd that's why I think that Boostnote would be incredibly awesome if it had a \"Typora mode\".. Syncing could be done by simply storing your directory on a cloud drive, as @twhiting suggests. The issue is how to then access the notes on your mobile device. There are many plain-text mobile editors that supprt Markdown, but unfortunately Boostnote's format, while simple .cson, is not exactly plain text. So it's incompatible with those apps. Now, if notes would be stored as basic markdown files, with the metadata of all notes in a storage kept in a single separate metadata file, then you have your cross-platform sync!. @VoLuong actually, both would be great!.

    "Mindstormer619": "Fully agree with comments @huettenhain has mentioned above. Here are my own two cents (I may echo some of the earlier comments, bear with me.)\n\nThe focus of the application is on programmers. As a programmer, I would very much like to see the source for what I'm editing. Markdown is perfect for this purpose since it's nicely mid-way between a source-based document and a readable one. (For instance, HTML is too far on the source-for-machines side of things, while full WYSIWYG is readable, but we don't really know how it's structured. More on that below).\nFor readability, Boostnote already has instant previews to see what your document looks like. Toggling between modes is quick and seamless, offering instant feedback on the end-view of the docs.\nWYSIWYG with invisible formatting characters is evil. See this blog post by Jeff Atwood (founder of StackOverflow and man behind the CommonMark spec for Markdown). Also you could try googling for \"invisible formatting characters\" and see tons of results of how copy-pasting and general mucking around on WYSIWYG documents leads to really hard-to-fix formatting issues.\nMarkdown editing gives the flexibility of using HTML wherever Markdown may not be sufficient. Also it provides easy conversion to a multitude of formats using Pandoc etc.\n\nTo add to the above, as mentioned earlier, other usability issues exist that should be higher on priority. For instance, a fix to the current preview experience (see #680 for example) would be good to fix, and could be done with a lot less dev effort than adding a full WYSIWYG experience will.\nAlternative consideration\nMy current favorite Markdown editor for editing larger documents is StackEdit. They maintain a split-screen editor and preview experience. While I would not recommend split-screen for BoostNote (the sidebar for Boostnote is useful and split-screen would take up too much screen space), look at how they implement the editor view:\n\nNotice that the Markdown formatting characters stay in place, but it also has the result of the formatting options visible directly in the editor. This leads to a beautiful WYSIWYG-like experience, while at the same time not causing any reduction in the power of Markdown.\nThe formatting buttons (and keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+B) insert Markdown formatting characters (i.e. ** for bold) rather than making invisible changes. I find this a great middle-ground.\nI would suggest something like this model for future update considerations. This would also take up some significant effort to put in. However, as @huettenhain noted, there are other issues that really ought to be considered much higher priority.. @olantrust In general the difference is the target audience for the application -- programmers. I would very much deal with a slightly more complex input format (like Markdown) than deal with formatting errors and inconsistencies with my documents. I like to know exactly what every character is formatted as and not have to deal with the inconsistencies and weird formatting issues caused by the invisible insertion of formatting characters, as it happens in WYSIWYG editors. The advantage of Markdown as a format for writing and formatting is that it is completely transparent with what it does. It's both predictable and readable, at the expense of very little extra complexity in terms of knowing certain formatting characters. Case in point -- Reddit uses Markdown for formatting its comment sections, and millions of ordinary users use it every day without finding it bogging down their UX.\nMore importantly, I am certain that making a full WYSIWYG experience will require significant efforts and will cause other bugs that will take time to track down and fix. There are other issues that could be solved in the meantime to give a more seamless experience to the application as a whole. Currently I find that the Live Preview works pretty well to making an editing experience as close to a WYSIWYG solution as possibe.\nPS: Kudos to the Boostnote team so far on this. I find your tool pretty much indispensible these days. I've lost track of the number of people I've recommended this to. Thank you so much for all the hard work.. @gatspy You can use this to generate neat markdown tables. In general the syntax is not complex, but getting something that looks neat in source mode will take some work unless you use a tool like this.. Hi, any updates on this? :). For now I have a quick-n-dirty fix that I use as a fast \"refresh\" mechanism. You need to have at least two notes in the folder for this to work.\n\nEdit your note.\nExit the editor using Ctrl + W\nQuickly type Ctrl + J then Ctrl + K. This will take you to the next and then back to your current note quickly, forcing the refresh. You can leave your finger on the Ctrl key and just hit J then K in quick succession.\nNote is refreshed. Now you can scroll \ud83d\ude04 \n\nGranted, this does not fix the issue at hand. It is, however, a workable alternative for the time being.. Same issue on both Ubuntu 16.04 and Windows 10.\nI think Consolas is being used as a default font.. B seems great :)\n@Nino9614 \n\nSo i would go for Option A\n\nSurely you mean B?. @daiyam Yup, still reproducible with 0.11.9.. ",

",
    "diegopau": "To me the best solution is the one @Mindstormer619 proposed at the end of his comment: \"Markdown formatting characters stay in place, but it also has the result of the formatting options visible directly in the editor. This leads to a beautiful WYSIWYG-like experience, while at the same time not causing any reduction in the power of Markdown.\" With maybe Commonmark support in the future, as (in my opinion) is an improvement over markdown.\nAn example of editor doing this is combination of keeping markdown markup while giving you a WYSIWYG feel is Writemonkey 3, you can see some screenshots here https://github.com/writemonkey/wm3/wiki/Documentation, there are some more editors doing this and to me just sounds like the perfect solution, even more so if the switch to change to the preview view(which would totally hide the markdown/commonmark syntax) keeps existing for those that like to read their notes that way. There could even be a \"don't show formatted text in editor view\" option in Preferences, that would remove that WYSIWYG-like experience while on the markdown editors, so everyone have their preference..

Just wanted to let you know so we can avoid doing the work twice (assuming you like what I'm implementing). So far:\nhttps://github.com/justin-calleja/Boostnote/commit/7fe7d37b5aed6519c56fae534b747a0b79ecc43f\nThere's up / down support (via arrow keys and Ctrl+n, Ctrl+p (emacs mode (by default work in terminal - since it's meant for developers these shortcuts are likely to be familiar - we can add others)). Also, there is visual indication when focus is lost (e.g. editing note). Clicking the SideNav will focus the active StorageItem (Storage / Folder). Perhaps there should be a shortcut to focus the NavBar from elsewhere... but that can be done later.\nWhat I'd like to implement is right / left support. You should be able to navigate notes in a folder by hitting right arrow key, and collapse folders in a storage by hitting left (or go to storage if you're on a folder).\nWhat do you think about this behaviour? I'll PR once I get it done all the way.\nCheers. Ok that's cool.. @kazup01\nRe 2, are you planning on extending markdown to do this? Also, if you're removing the tagarea at the top of NoteDetail, how can one quickly see at a glance the tags associated with a note? Would you have to skim the note?\nPersonally, skimming the note would be less convenient. I'd rather have the current tagarea at the top of the note to create / remove and quickly see which tags are associated with the note.\nAlso, adding tags to notes in markdown... since this is something that native markdown does not support, I think it would make more sense to have this as a separate note type. There should be some separation between notes written in markdown and are compatible with other markdown supporting software, and custom stuff.\nPersonally, Boostnote should only have plain markdown note types out of the box. All other types could be plugins the user can install if relevant to them (to my mind, this includes the existing Snippet Note type - markdown can have code snippets after all).\nIn any case - totally agree with keeping simplicity as a priority OOTB, but if Boostnote is going to be interesting, it needs to support plugins. Currently, by \"plugins\" I'm thinking \"supporting different note types\". When I stop to think about it, there is potential for more if one is willing to bastardise one's Boostnote :)\nFor e.g. I've been meaning to write some kind of drilling software (to memorise things). I wanted to do this with the combination of tech Boostnote is using (Electron, React, Redux) - as practice. I came across Boostnote a couple of days ago while I was researching how to work with Electron.\nWhat I'm trying to say is that, note taking is cool.. but the first thing that came to my mind was \"I can use this as the base for my drilling app\" (apart from a lot of infrastructure already being there - drilling and note taking seem to have some relation..  but true, Boostnote having drilling support OOTB would be bloating it).\nOnly problem, there is no plugin system.\nI'm diverging here... to summarise:\n\nRemoving the tagarea might not be such a good idea unless there's some other (easy) way to see all tags associated with a note.\nIf you're going to extend markdown, please do it as a separate editor type.\nIdeally introduce new editor types via some kind of plugin system and keep Boostnote simple OOTB.\nIf there's going to be a plugin system, can it be made generic? e.g. the use case above (embedded drill app) cannot be implemented if plugins are restricted to being only \"different note types\".\n\n\nRe 1, seems like a great addition :). @sferra , you're right I meant ctrl key when I first opened the issue - my bad. Kept shift in the title because of @LeoLamCY 's findings.\n@LeoLamCY I was able to re-produce:\n\nhold down shift + ; and then release shift before releasing ; then try hitting ctrl\n\nThanks, I'm looking at #545 . @asmsuechan sure thing. Would the following work? (each point a separate commit):\n\nup / down across SideNav items and SideNavFilter\ncollapse expand one / collapse expand all SideNav items\nnavigate between SideNav items and NoteList items. @asmsuechan ok cool. I'll split it in 3 commits.. @asmsuechan it's split in 4 (\"Add mainProcessArgs helper...\" one is for dev purposes (adds Redux dev tools if --hot is used)).\n\nHope this is better. Thanks!. @asmsuechan disregard this PR for now. I failed to \"test\" Finder pop up.. @asmsuechan ok fixed in last commit. Basically it was accessing focus.sideNav or focus.noteList. In Finder... focus is not being passed in (didn't work on Finder part - TODO).\nI changed all components to just take in their focus of interest (sideNav v.s. noteList) directly. That way, not passing in a value becomes false...\nend result - no error when you start up Finder. But yes, Finder does not yet support keyboard navigation.... I'll work on this later.. @kazup01 sorry I neglected this...\nCurrently, this can no longer be merged in - not until conflicting files are fixed. Even if it's merged, I never implemented the same keyboard shortcuts for the Finder window (was new to Boostnote and didn't even use that window tbh).\nIf you guys are interested in merging this, I can resume working on it some time soon (this weekend).. @kazup01 sure, wasn't sure if it'd get merged as interested in it had stopped (I thought I'd let part 1 without the Finder implementation get merged before working on the rest).\nAnyway, I'll be looking into this again soon.. This PR is being closed because it has been replaced by:\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/711. @LeoLamCY @asmsuechan ... ye please don't use ctrl + b it's not just for vim mode. That key combo goes back (like hitting arrow left) in normal mode (it's an Emacs keybinding... or whatever they're called there - and it's probably the default in your terminal program too).\nAs a side note, in vim ports across editors, being in insert mode also allows the use of these emacs shortcuts allowing one to stay in insert mode to do minor movements while still keeping your hands in home position (and without going back to normal mode). i.e. vim mode or not... these shortcuts are used across many editors and are likely to be ingrained in some ppl's muscle memory.\nFor the record, I don't personally use ctrl + :.\nAlso, @asmsuechan - you had an issue open about a \"dot config\" file for Boostnote (which I can't seem to find now). That's a great idea and would probably be the ideal place to map these keyboard bindings - so users can change according to personal prefs.. @asmsuechan many thanks!. @Oylex , the only reason I'm saying ctrl + w should delete the previous word is because that's one of the basic Emacs commands which is available by default (AFAIK) on all shells and ppl could be used to that.\nFor e.g. in Boostnote, other Emacs combinations work as expected: ctrl+n, ctrl+p, ctrl+f, ctrl+b, ctrl+a, ctrl+e, alt+f, alt+b etc... I don't use them all (not an Emacs user myself - but I use these all the time in the terminal).\nIn any case, there's an open issue on being able to map these things so that should sort this out.. @NicoHood have you tried pulling from master? This issue should have been solved with: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/commit/efd80d5c0c1b0668b0747a549d12bbb6d6d937ad\nDuplicate of: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/540. @kazup01 there will always be many conflicts if I re-do the work and it's never merged in.\nThe first time, there was an issue with the commits containing too much code. Then the project moved forward and I had to not only split the commits but refactor.\nOnce that was done, no feedback was given and the project evolved again breaking this PR.\nWhat's going to change this time if I re-do the work again?. @kazup01 Ok, I thought the problem was that the commits were too big. I made them smaller and included them in one PR as they are related to the same feature the PR addresses.\nCan you please let me know sooner? As in, I had already submitted this PR for review and @asmsuechan was suppose to look at it and come back with feedback. Now there are probably many merge conflicts to resolve (apart from me having to get familiar with the code again).\nWhen I have some time, I'll look into splitting up in smaller PRs - however, I will only issue one PR at a time. Once one is merged, I'll look into making the next PR.\nI hope you understand I cannot keep re-writing this code.\nThanks.. ",

I removed the showMenu variable since it was preventing Travis from successfully building.. @gotenyama @jasondavis You can add the feature to your local build just by switching the autoHideMenuBar: showMenu  property to autoHideMenuBar: true, which is located inside the resources/app/lib/main-window.js file.

You can get a better idea about it here, the official electron API docs :). Actually it is used and also needed, because when building the menu-item Toggle Full Screen, the click property is expected to be a callback with two parameters: \n- item, which represents the Toggle Full Screen object inside the menu, and clicking it triggers the execution of the below of it defined code \n- and focusedWindow, which works as the bridge between the menu and the main app process allowing us to pass through the message inside of the send() function\nI know that it is a bit confusing, but this is how electron operates, and without defining it inside of the click property the code will result in an error.

This issue, as I see, only appears on Debian-based Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.); I hava never met the issue on openSUSE and Arch-based Linux.  . @Rokt33r I think this issue could be closed because it's not Boostnote's fault. Instead, it should be reopen in fcitx's or Debians' repository.. This issue appears on my Windows (Windows 10 Home 1803) installation starting from 0.11.11.

I think the spaces between storage locations clearly distinguish different locations.\n \n\nIn the Google Material Design Guideline of Navigation drawer, it said a dividers could be used to separate groups of navigation destinations within the list and I think this is the case.

The default storage location is ~/Boostnote in my openSUSE and Kubuntu installation. You can check if there are any files there.\n\nIt seems that you are experiencing an unexpected situation while exporting, so you may take a screenshot with developer tool open (Ctrl+Shift+I) which may help the Boostnote developers identify issues.. It seems that the menu bar is not available to be translated on any languages.. It doesn't work on my Windows 10 1603 as well while it is fine on my Linux (openSUSE).. This issue may have a history. Two years ago when I started to track Boostnote (0.7.x), the issue appeared on Linux (Debian and openSUSE) but I am not sure whether it appeared on Windows. And now it appears on Windows, not on Linux (openSUSE). It may not be the same issue; I'm just saying.  . In my opinion, the menu structure in the present is a Mac-style design, and what you have asked for is a Windows-style design. I think both are fine.. Duplicated. #2708 . I think maybe we could use the native color picker of the operating system, as we have used the native right-click menu, tag bar and so on.\nI'm sorry I have no idea that how it can be applied; I could only find this, mockingbot/electron-color-picker, hoping it to be helpful.\nThanks.  . I got this when trying to delete a folder from the main UI. It seems that deleting a folder 'can not be undone'.\n\n. A pair of \\$ is to add a LaTeX math expression to your markdown, so Boostnote handles \\$ just like ` and *.\nTo understand how \\$ works, you can try to type $v=\\frac{\\Delta{s}}{\\Delta{t}}$ in Boostnote.\nThanks.  .

The online Code Playgrounds like CodePen.io and JSFiddle, JSBin which all have these panels:\n\nHTML\nCSS\nJavaScript\nHTML Output\n\nIt would be amazing to add this as a new type as it would be the only Code Playground that is a self hosted on computer version in a Desktop app!\nThe 3 code panels could use the existing code editor you currently use in the app and then it would just be a matter of have it save there data and parse the output.\nI would pay for this feature!\nAny thoughts?  I have several ideas for it if you are interested in pursuing it. Ok I  can respect that decision.  Perhaps its an idea for a separate app similar in UI to Boostnote but for Code Playground style items.\nAnother idea would be in addition to these Issues on GitHub is a Roadmap of planned features.  The new GitHub Projects https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/projects would be a great place to publish planned feature and allow feature request and ideas if you are open to it and then it would be contained in this GitHub repo. @kazup01 in response to a codepen type function as a plugin, I think some sort of plugin system in general would be amazing.\nThere is now an ElectronJS desktop code playground app and it is pretty amazing as it is just like codepen but it allows to create and use multiple CSS and JS files in a project!   It even lets you set a subdomain name for a Project.

This is a common feature among Windows apps to use the ALT key to toggle toolbar so I would say it's a good PR. Link no longer valid. No offense meant but the only difference I can really notice is the selected item background colors.  If that is the point then I do like the new selected item colors better.\nIf you are to push a theme update my preference would be to do something similar to my post here https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/328 where each panel/section of the app has a defined border so you can tell where one section start and another ends!  Especially on the dark theme as all 3 columns blend together right now with the same background and no border.\nJust my thoughts!\nLove to see any updates to the app, I use it daily now to really organize tons of planned and in progress projects. @VoLuon discovered that you can embed an Iframe into a Boostnote already so that is amazing!  It should be listed as a feature.\nSome ideas for usage\n\nEmbed CodePen.io projects\nEmbed JSFiddle projects\nEmbed Documentation websites for a project\nEmbed online Tool websites like JS Beautifier\n\n\nIssues\n\nObviously some sites like Trello, GitHub, etc have a HEADER setting X-Frame-Options to DENY which makes it not possible to embed those websites in an Iframe.  This isn't really an issue but more of a fact to keep in mind when adding iframes to a file.\n\nDemo Images of Websites Embeded into a Boostnote File using an Iframe\n\nMultiple Boostnote Files each with different Website Iframes\n\nBoostnote.io\nMKDocs.org Markdown Documentation Generator\nCodePen.io Project Embeded\n\n\n\nWorkFlowy App Embeded into Boostnote Iframe\n\n. This is  actually exactly the feature I am looking for! I never tried putting the iframe HTML into a Boostnote until now but just 2 days ago posted a feature request for Iframew website support which i'm sure you saw the post here https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/361\nAs Boostnote is on your own PC/Mac I would think it would be the users responsibility for locking there computer access down and this feature should remain working as I don't agree with it being a security issue .  \nIf there was an online web version, then obviously I would agree in that case.  (not trying to sound rude or anything =) \nAs far as using this as a bonus feature as I hope to do, I suggest to just make sure that if your note only has the iframe and nothing else that you do not make it 100% width and height  as this would make it hard to go into edit mode if you use the right click toggle mode option.  Simply adding other content  with the iframe HTML to create a space in the page where the right click toggle in Boostnote will remain working or else sizing the frame as mentioned to not consume the whole window will make it so you don't have to edit any CSON files.\n\nDemo with BoostNote Website Embeded as Iframe\n\nMultiple Iframe Tabs\nTab/file 3 even has a CodePen.io Editor Embeded\n\n. I am a huge Tag user in general.   As mentioned not so much in Boostnote since they don't work to show records matching a selected tag.\nThe reason I love and use tags in addition to Folders and categories is the sole reason that a single record can be tagged with multiple tags wgere it can only be in 1 category/folder.\n\nExample\nIf I have a record that stores a JS library code, some documentation, and example usage of the library.  I might store that in a Collection named Code that has a sub-folder named JS-Libraries\nNow that works great, if I need to find that record it is pretty easy to find in my code library under JS-LIbrary folder.  However now if I have 3-4 records for other projects and they need to use that library orr acess it, with the use of Tags I would be able to tag the record to show up when I view any of those libraries.\nThis probably isn't the best example.  Where I really use tags a lot is in my massive organized Pinboard Bookmarks collection.  Each bookmark is Tagged with many tags related to the bookmark.  A DateTime Picker JS library might get tagged with JavaScript, DateTime-Pickers, Dates, Web-Dev,Time, Picker-Selectors\nReally I feel tags come into true value as your library grows to a large scale and you spend the time to properly tag items you can really get a lot of usage out of them.\n. Also the idea of using this UI in the sidebar to toggle view of folders and tags would be really slick and a nice UI and UX for the app!\n . The scrollbar issue doesn't happen or appear to be an issue on my Windows 7 install. I was about to post this as a feature request as many people need this feature too.  So it's nice to see you already did it here!. Nice PR, the app really needs this feature!  Hopefully it gets released soon. is this going to be released soon?. @sosukesuzuki Thanks for this feature!  Have you thought about maybe doing the same for the Snippet note types child file tabs.  We need a way to re-order there sort position?. I just did a mockup for a dark theme I'm doing as well...\nView fullsize image for details\n\n\nView fullsize image\n\n\nView fullsize image for details\n\n\nLight version\nView fullsize image\n\n. @kazup01 @DFelten Thanks I added a couple more screenshots above just now.  \nI basically just open Dev Tools in Boostnote and concentrate on making each section a different color to indicate it's a different component on the page as well as playing around with adding lighter and darker borders in areas to give it more of a \"Desktop App\" appearance. perhaps just store a list of note ID's that are pinned\n. @asmsuechan Using LocalStorage to store a list of IDs of Pinned notes sounds like an acceptable way as it wouldn't be super important if the pinned ID list was ever reset or lost.  Either way it's just an idea.. @kazup01 Thanks, I am happy to contribute ideas to improve the app as it benefits all of us.\nI have 8 Notebook Apps like EverNote, Collate, LeaNote, BoostNote, Nimbus Notes, and 4-5 other Notebook apps to test the features of all of them.\nSo I am a good source for Feature Ideas.\nAlso I am really using BoostNote as my main Notebook app for Programming docs, code snippets, and more now.  I really want a Backup/Export feature soon so that if my Boostnote library files become corrupted I will be able to restore and not lose all my work and data....pleeeeeeeease!\nAlso for Themes, if designed correctly you should be able to make it where users can upload there own CSS theme files.  Then you wont be restricted to just the themes you release as anyone could upload a Theme CSS file to there app.. @kazup01  Also if you would like, I can help set up the Project Bpoards by at least adding my Issues posted here to the Board if that would help you, just let me know.  Glad to help in any way.  I have been a PHP and JavaScript Developer for 14 years!. @kazup01  Sorry I just saw you or someone has already done it! Awesome! thank you. \n\nHave you tried #245 already? This is @asmsuechan 's great work\n\nI have seen this and it is a great feature to have however when you have 100's+ of notes in 30-40 Notebooks then it is not practical to backup each note separately!  \nThat is why I request a \"Backup/Restore\" feature which will save the actual backend CSON files and directories all into a single ZIP archive file which can be used to make a whole complete backup and eventually could even add a Restore from Backup function which would allow to use one of these ZIP files to restore a backed up Boostnote colletion.\nThis is useful:\n- When your Boostnote source becomes corrupted with bad files\n- You install Boostnote on a new PC/Mac\n- You can save your Boostnote backup ZIP file to cloud service so you don't lose any important work stored in Boostnote.\nMost ElectronJS apps that create data on a large scale like Boostnote does have a Backup/Restore solution for the reasons above.  \nThe Export Note feature is great for a per note basis but the backup solution is more for emergencies to make sure work isn't lost.\nI realize I could simply backup the source folders/files myself but having a button inside Boostnote menu to zip them all to 1 files and allow me to save somewhere would simplify the process.\nAlso I don't think it would be too difficult to implement the feature if we can find a good ZIP file Node module it would just be a matter of installing the library and pointing it to the source files directory and adding a Menu button to run it.  Perhaps when I get some time I will look into it.\n\nI would love to contribute myself but as of right now I have no previous experience with React so I need to study and work with that some to be of much contribution on Boostnote.\nAs for getting more Developers to contribute to the project.  I think the project is off to a great start right now as more and more people are sharing on Twitter and writing articles about the app.  It is very useful, the main key is keeping it useful so implementing some of these features will help make the app more useful to more and more users so I think over time they will keep coming as long as the development of features keeps on continuing and stays active.  So far it is pretty active so I think things are on a good path so far!\nAnother idea would be to list some of the planned features that are to be added in the near future to the README.md file as a Roadmap of features to come.  It can list the current features the app has and the features that are planned to be added still.\nAlso a link to the Project Board so people can see what features are planned and what has already been requested.\n\nThats all I got for now, keep up the good work.  I use Boostnote everyday on a large scale so I will continue to post ideas that would improve the workflow and UI to make it more useful.  thanks\n. @sota1235 1 thing is all the other 8-9 Notebook Apps have this feature and it is useful to see the meta type data for a Note in 1 place like that.\nThe other day I needed to know the Creation Date and Time and the Created Date and Time of the note but it was not available anywhere in the app.. I 2nd the vote.\nAlso export to CodePen.io API and JSFiddle API like some other code playground sites do. this is a nice feature however most apps that do this also make sure it is an option that the user can turn on/off as it can be a bit slow in some cases as the dictionary files are huge!  Also it's not just English, there are dictionary files in every language pretty much\n. I found a nice Node ZIP library that some other ElectronJS apps are using - https://github.com/cthackers/adm-zip\nCan easily add files to a zip archive as wel as read them for an import . @mpizenberg  You mention changing a Note from a Snippet note into a Normal Note which I presume is a Markdown Note as these are the 2 Note types in Boostnote....\n\n\nIs this what you mean by that text or do you mean something else?\n. @xbotao Another backup request is an export/back whole Notebook to ZIP files. @xbotao my version has this feature already see the image below...\n\n. the benefit of the top is that there are tons of other apps and librasries that use this format so it would be more standardized. @loicteixeira I agree with this being the best solution as it is the most common solution across other apps.\nAlso it means if using the Markdown file outside of Boostnote, then that Metadata is not going to get in the way!\nAlso JSON is much more popular and easier to use with other libraries as most modern libraries support it already\n@kohei-takata you argument that GitHub parses the data when viewed on GitHub, they also parse JSON data in the same manner.\nJust my view on the matter. @huettenhain thanks I didn't see that.  You think I should delete this post?. @bbtran thanks. @huettenhain thats fine I just came across it and it is something you don't see everyday.  You see thousands of code snippets but rarely one that runs the code inline.  Also Boostnote it note a regualt notebook app like the other 20 out there, its a \"programmer notepad\".\nIn any case i'm not mad or anything just pitched the idea and you pitched your thoughts on it so it's all good =)\n\nBy the way for the past year I have been working on my \"Developer App\" which will handle this feature as it works on a plugin system with 30-100 developer plugins so the app can do anything a dev wants and they can pick and choose which plugins the desktop app will have running.. yes thats it, thanks. @kazup01 What do you think of this?. I have requested this for a long time.  My idea was to batch export a folder of notes and create a ZIP file with the folder and all notes as MD files in the zipped folder/file. @kohei-takata \"I don't know how to implement the feature, so I will study.\"...\nSimply get a list of notes that exist in the selected Notebook/folder and then loop over each one and run the code from the current MD export on each file, then create a ZIP file with all the newly created MD files and save it to disk.\nIn my past feature requests here I have links to useful ZIP libraries that make the process really easy. this is a great feature thanks hopefully it will be merged into project soon!. While this is a cool idea it would require a ton of work, almost a 2nd version of the app!\nI do however like an idea of using your own server to upload and keep note files in sync that are chose to share online....similar to sharing a note in Evernote and other notebook apps which basically takes the selected note and uploads it to the server and then assigns the note a URL to view that note online and for others to view the online version.  It would be for viewing only and not editable online though, simply just for sharing a note online with a URL assigned to the shared note.\nWhat I mention here is possibble on most the Notebook apps I have tested however they all upload the note to there own server.  My version would allow that upload to go to your own self-hosted server through FTP so that you do not rely on a 3rd party company to host it...in the event the company would shut down your shared notes would still exist since you would host on your own servers. I have requested this a few times on here.  It is a great idea!. UPDATE\nI now see that this exist in the app...\n\nI then put that link into another note and click on it however clicking it does not do any action\n\n. Sorry I see now the issue here https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1051. ",

Basically why this bug occur is because when you click on a link, boostnote will load that specific page in an iframe tag. However, in this case, the website that you need to load doesn't allow iframe to load it due to security reason which is a type of attack called clickjacking. I'm busy at the moment but I think changing iframe to webview can solve the problem, if you can then submit a PR for this issue.

And of course the image displayed again when I toggle the mode.. @ehhc  Oh, I see the problem there! thank you. Hmm...I also think that allow unescaped html is pretty dangerous, but I want to keep the option there to increase the \"customizability\" of boostnote, beside, the html is escaped by default, if the user choose to turn that feature of, he/she probably knows what he/she is doing (I hope so :smile: ). Anyway, I'll try to investigate the \"double-escaped-html\" issue and submit a fix right here.. @ehhc I fixed the double escaped html. We gonna need to vote whether the option should be there or not :smile: @kazup01  What do you think?. @nlopin @Rokt33r @ehhc , The problem is more complicated than I thought.\n- If we don't escape html -> markdown it will filter non-html tag which causing this problem: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1728\n- If we escape html -> tags will be escaped and can be render in html but if escaped strings is a part of a code block -> markdown it will escape everything in code block -> double escaped strings, which is this problem: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1893\nSo, I have to make a new escape html function that can detect code block and skip all characters needed to be escape that located in the code block.\nSorry for the delay, I almost forgot about this PR :smile: . After reading the issue: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1728, I think the option for customizing whether the html should be escape or not is redundant so I won't add it into the code.. Closed as fixed https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1858. Hey guys is this issue still exists?. Feel free to reopen the issue if it still there.. The hotkey section is available in the setting and also the PR is merged. Fixed in the latest version.

No problem.\nBEFORE:\n\nAFTER:\n\n. @sosukesuzuki As you can see the current scroll bar will disappear after a short period of time and only reappear if you resize the app or focus on a text box and hit the page up or page down key.

I've removed codemirror scroll addon and the problem is still persist and also I've found the same issue on Atom github page: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15107 , but it seem that their solution is just like me. But how can you guys don't experience this issue? I experienced this issue on both Boostnote and my side project which is fixed by using the traditional way to create scroll bar.. Hey @Rokt33r , why your scroll bar is the default scroll bar of chrome? Mine is not! \nHere is how you can reproduce the problem:\n1. Open something long enough to make the scroll bar appears (the interface setting tab for example)\n2. Wait for it to disappear\n\n. I have no idea what's happening but I think if your scroll bar is still the default one then it will not disappear, do you have a linux machine to test it? Maybe it's a linux problem?. @Rokt33r I've just updated to the latest version of Boostnote (0.11.7) and the scroll bars became the default scroll bar of chrome (just like what you have) and it doesn't disappear anymore??? I gonna have to investigate the commit that change the scroll bar, but that's also means the issue is now solved, the scroll bar doesn't disappear anymore, now it just looks ugly and that's a different issue. Should we close this pull request?. We now have TOC generator to take care of this: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2281. Well this feature can be achieved but I don't really see why Boostnote should support that feature. Can you show us why that feature is useful?\n. I guess we can have like a option in setting for displaying color code. I'm not quite understand your problem. This feature only cover the markdown preview style not the whole UI. Please provide some more details.. Close due to inactivity. Implemented here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2173. I think so, can you check it?. Close as solved. @infosisio which version are you on? I deleted a note on the latest version (v0.11.7) and it immediately switch to the next note. @infosisio that's wierd, I'm using Linux Mint 18.2 and it work fine.\n\nCan you describe how can I reproduce the problem?. @theUncanny Can you clarify the problem?\nHere is how I understand the problem:\nThe scroll bar is now have the default style (just like chrome) and not the style in the previous version which have dark background and compatible with dark theme right?. Thank you @theUncanny , I have a fix for that in my PR which is currently in review. I'll tell you when the PR is merged. Hmm...I think the word full screen will confuse users. There is already a shortcut for full screen mode F11. How about full screen edit mode or something like that, I'm bad at naming stuff :smile: . @TZTsai , @Rokt33r I think this is the error message that he's getting\nhttps://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-error-the-application-has-failed-to/5c6a015e-4162-491d-b7d9-f3b13612e304. Confirm this is a bug! I'll try to it soon.. LGTM :tada: . Can you open the dev tool? Just hit ctrl + shift + i to open the developer console and take a picture for us so that we can have more clue on what error is happening. @Rokt33r done!\n. @Rokt33r Again, done !. Duplicate https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2217. Thank you for reporting, this is a duplicate of https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2217. Calm down guys, we already have PRs for this bug. This bug will be fixed soon, probably in the next version, please just leave your code as is, no need to edit your code.. It's good to give more information @MayakoLyyn , what you're doing is good, I don't feel offensed at all. It's just, there are many issues about this bug and I just want to tell people that we already know and have solution for this bug so you guys don't need to create more issues about this bug unless something strange related to this bug happened.. Hey @AamerShareef , if you have already solve your problem can you close this issue?\n. Merged :smile: . LGTM :+1: . Hi, I'm the author of that custom CSS feature and sadly that custom CSS section is only for markdown note previewer not the whole UI. But if you want you can submit a issue for that.. @modmod24 Yes it will be deleted if you upgrade Boostnote. Currently there's no way to change the UI style so you will have to stick to your current scroll bar for a while. I'll ask the developer team if I can add a feature for this.. Can you tell me which version of Boostnote are you using and which OS too?. Thank you @modmod24 , I was able to reproduce the problem, PR is comming soon.. Currently Boostnote doesn't support multi level folders and maybe it will not be implemented in Boostnote as the developer team is working on a new version of Boostnote and planing on implement this in the new app. Oh, of course @ndbeals ! You can join the slack channel to discuss about the rewrite version of boostnote slack group. Please join the renewal channel to discuss about the new app.. Which version are you using? I remember I've already implemented this feature. I can't reproduce the problem and can you me tell me which version and OS are you using?. Closed due to inactivity. Hmm...How will this feature be useful? Can you show me an application of this feature?. I can understand that, but according to your request above, you want to combine all markdown documents in to 1 single markdown document. I don't know how that's useful and if so, then why don't you write in just 1 document instead of multiple documents?. @Rokt33r what do you think?. Feel free to re-open the issue if this is happens. Fixed by https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2257\nFeel free to reopen the issue if you need.. Duplicated with https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2217. @kiryanenko can you fix the conflict again. Duplicated with https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2217. Thank you for reporting, I'll investigate that bug.. LGTM :tada:. Hey @mbarczak , just one more small request, it would be great if you can insert the toc at the cursor position. Sometimes, I want to have a document like this:\n```\nThis is some introduction...\nTOC\nh1\nh2\nWith the current code it only insert at the top of the document.. Hey @breizoreol , have you finished this PR? Because I can't seem to use it.\n![ca](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12984316/43998930-68b803f0-9e2b-11e8-8e14-16055fa144fc.gif)\n. I know where the problem is, it's not a cache issue. Because when I change to the preview mode (the oposite mode to the split view mode) I was able to use the feature.\n![scac](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12984316/44026629-dea59b5c-9f1d-11e8-9de5-5872dde338b8.gif)\nIt's mean that your feature doesn't support split view mode yet. You can look at this [file](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/browser/components/MarkdownPreview.js) and this [file](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/browser/components/MarkdownSplitEditor.js) for more info.. Closed due to inactivity. Feel free to re-open if you want to work on this feature again. Boostnote currently use Codemirror so if you want new syntax highlight, you can submit issue in [Codemirror repo](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror). Have you try the link in the page?\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/boostnote-mobile. If you can't reproduce it anymore, can you close the issue?\n. Probably won't be implemented. However, you can suggest this issue for the team to add in the rewrite version of Boostnote! Please join our [slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/boostnote-group/shared_invite/enQtMzkxOTk4ODkyNzc0LThkNmMzY2VlZjVhYTNiYjE5YjQyZGVjNTJlYTY1OGMyZTFjNGU5YTUyYjUzOWZhYTU4OTVlNDYyNDFjYWMzNDM) at channel `#renewal`.. Which version of Boostnote are you using?. [The fix for this bug](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2230) is in version 0.11.9 which is still in pre-release state. You can wait until the stable version is out.. Have you tried pointing you storage location to your cloud folder in setting?. Feel free to re-open this issue if this still happens. LGTM. Hey @daiyam , thanks for the great feature, but, I notice that the feature will not run if the user don't restart the app, can you fix this?. LGTM :tada:. We should add a blog post on this :smile: too many keyboard shortcut :smile: . LGTM. See https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2310. Yes, I'm working on it. Note:\n- The first bug occurred due to the library: https://github.com/podefr/react-debounce-render used in the PR: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2074. I haven't found this exact why that library is the cause but by removing it, the first bug disappeared.\n- The second bug occurred due to that same library in the first bug. That library create a higher component so we can't access the function in the original component. The bad news is that library doesn't create an easy way to access the original component so we have to dig deep into the returned component to access the original which make the code....you get the point.\n- The third bug has the same cause as the second bug. Oh then I the 3rd issue has the same cause as the 2nd issue.. @sosukesuzuki The 2nd & 3rd issues is caused by `react-debounce-render` as the library create a higher order component and wrap the original component ([code](https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2074/files#diff-15e7f898eb1b252e0e2a285a91f1a2ec)). Therefore, in some other component, they can't access the original component (`MarkdownEditor`) method such as [`reload`](https://github.com/max-buranbaev/Boostnote/blob/51e836f32ad43e92025aa6140d71654762504ec3/browser/components/MarkdownEditor.js#L176). This issue is resolved in the next version 0.11.9. Please wait until it the new version come out.. Hey @daiyam can you filter tags that has already been added ? I think it will be better.. Nice! LGTM. This bug is fixed in v0.11.9 which is still in pre-release state. Thank you for reporting.. Have you try hitting ctrl + b ?. Yeah, I didn't know it exist at first. Actually, I forgot how I know about that shortcut at the first place :smile: I also think it's a good idea about the chevron, if you can, please help us with that feature. Or else I will add it when I have the time.. This bug will be fixed it the next version v0.11.9 . Thank you for reporting!. LGTM :tada: \n. Have you tried the green switch on the top right of the note.. LGTM. I also think if a front matter is invalid then the markdown should display it out. However, with the current behavior, if I type the code bellow, all the content of the note will be hidden.\n\nThe line bellow has 3 dashes but the line above has 4 dashes and that will hide all the note content.\n. This issue is solved in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2230 and will appears in v0.11.9. @daiyam that's the code in markdown note, he's talking about the code snippet note. Currently there's no way to set the default language for code snippet note. Maybe someone can implement it.. @richardtks I want when I paste my code in snippet note it will automatically detect the language and add the appropriate extension . This issue is solved in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2230 and will appears in v0.11.9. This issue is solved in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2230 and will appears in v0.11.9. Currently the markdown note allow you to search full text but the snippet note doesn't and it will be available in the next version 0.11.9\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2226. @devilyard can you take a screenshot of the dev tool?\nHit `ctrl + shift + i` to open the dev tool. Then switch to the `console` tab on top of the dev tool. Then take a picture a post here. So that we can have more information about this bug. Hey @devilyard is this issue still exists? if not can you close it?. Feel free to switch to linux (highly recommend) and re-open this issue if you think it related to Boostnote :smile:. Thank you for reporting!. Thanks for reporting, we will fix this asap!. @randman1 is this issue still exists? if not can you close the issue?. Close due to inactivity.. Solution: If you're having `Allow dangerous html tags` on in your setting then turn it off. However, this is still a bug so I'll let this issue open till me or someone found the fix for it.. In any case, I'll close this issue until someone able to reproduce this issue. With the current release Mac users should download it manually.. Yeah, why don't you create a md file and paste your note in? If it solve your problem, then can you close this issue?. I think it's fixed here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2226. Sorry for the delay, I look at this today. . Should we skip exporting empty note? Because if the note is empty your code will still export it to a `.md` file (the file has no name, just `.md` :smile: ) and it's empty.. Can you provide more information?. Related issue: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1782. We will try to fix the update installer, I'll close this issue. Why don't I have that feature??? . I can't reproduce this bug, maybe it only occur on mac? (I'm usiing linux). I have little knowledge about this, can you explain more about this? @daiyam . That's a good idea, however, make sure that you keep a back up of the original file in case we want to implement a `reset to default` feature in the future. I'm wondering if the current behavior of Boostnote is by design or not. I think we should ask @Rokt33r for this, maybe there's something behind this.....or nothing at all :smile: . I believe this feature had already implemented.\nhere is a title\nYou can refer to that anchor\n``. @daiyam Can you fix the conflict ?. Confirm on Linux . You code will not focus the correct note if there is one note that matched in the search box.\n![boostnote](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12984316/45586013-9894a700-b919-11e8-8909-61a797ed154e.gif)\n. Is it because of me or the old bug is still there?. @Pudge601 What's the status of this?\n**EDIT** Sorry for bothering you. Somehow it works fine now.. Also fixed this: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2647. Currently there's no way to achieve this feature. The best way to do it now is to wrap it in a codeblock like that to have the syntax highligting and remove the codeblock mark after that.. Sorry for not being able to review this soon, I'll try to work on this when I have time.. I'm really sorry that I can't reply you soon. I've so much work.\nCan I ask you more about the number 2? Why do you need it?\nAnd the number 3, if you're talking about note's tag then that feature will be available in the next release\nCan you explain more about number 6 and 7?. Can you edit theMy storagelabel too?. Hey @brapifra , can you improve your code a bit? This is the current behavior:\n![bbs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12984316/45855427-479e0c00-bd7a-11e8-95f5-1e195c68998c.gif)\n. I do not quite understand this, can you provide more info?. I thought he was minimizing the left note list (you can still see the scroll bar of it). Anyway, if you can resize the left note list by hovering the scroll bar on the left and maybe your mouse will change into a resize-arrow and you can resize it. If that doesn't work then maybe you need to re-install the app.. Maybe the setting is somehow corrupted. Anyway, feel free to re-open this issue if it happens again. I think green doesn't suit with the tag. But it looks cool anyway!\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12984316/45936374-d6f82900-bfdf-11e8-9a41-2e39eed9e967.png)\n. Yes, I think cyan looks cool!. Confirm that it works on Linux Mint. Yes, we're using markdown-it to parse and render the markdown. Currently, you can only add custom syntax by submitting a PR containing your plugin for markdown-it.. I don't quite understand your question. Can you explain it more? and have you tried to draw that with Boostnote yet?. Hey, @samherrington thank you for your contribution :tada:\nPlease improve your code because with the current code the error won't appear if theShow/Hide Boostnotehotkey is empty, however, it also doesn't display a success message when the user save the setting with the emptyShow/Hide Boostnote` hotkey\n\n. Well, clearly that's the current behavior :smile: Or we will have to prevent users from saving blank hotkeys, however, there're requests that people want to \"disable\" that hotkey by leaving it blank. So do you have other ideas other than sticking to the current behavior? If not then I think showing a message to notify the user is not a bad idea.. \n@samherrington is this the intended behavior?. Haha @jacobherrington TIL. @daiyam Thank you for your suggestion, I'm also thinking about the syntax for this and your suggestion looks great!. @arcturus140 that's a great idea, I'll add it to the welcome page. The slideshow was actually by @daiyam at https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2465. @daiyam I used @ because @udio :smile: But if you like the # then I'll change it. But before that I'll ask the slack channel about this. I also agree with you about the show/hide Boostnote hotkey.. Can you show some message when the snippet is copied? For example:\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/2ccd00a378cdc1511ac17e4b40470976d1a1e1a4/browser/components/MarkdownPreview.js#L694-L697\n. LGTM :tada:. Fixed in next release. @jacobherrington ping 2. I think with pre-commit hook we can detect the problem right away without waiting for the CI to fail and prevent some unnecessary commit like \"fixed lint\" :smile:. LGTM but can you discard yarn.lock? Also, I think running test in the pre-commit hook is a bit heavy for small changes (There's still some chance that small changes can cause failed tests, but I think leaving it to the CI is the best). @daiyam . @daiyam why don't we use:\n\nClick to expand\n  whatever\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to expand</summary>\n  whatever\n</details>. @Rokt33r what do you think about this?. LGTM :tada:. Closed as implemented. @Airgunster Added label :+1: . @rscott can you update your PR?. @rscott ping!. Currently, Boostnote doesn't have this feature (not that I'm aware of). Maybe someone will be interested in implementing this.. Should we append css to all CodeMirror themes? Or can we just include another separate css file for that?\nUPDATE\nSorry, my fingers moved faster than my brain haha :smile: . LGTM :+1: . LGTM :tada:. Close as solved. Boostnote TOC is actually case-sensitive. You must capitalize the link just like the section title.\n```\nTitle\nContents\n\nSection 1\n               ^--- Capitalize\nSection 2\n               ^--- Capitalize\n\nSection 1\n^--- Because of this\nText for section 1\nSection 2\n^--- And this\nText for section 2\n```\nIn the next version, Boostnote will have a TOC generator to take care of this for you: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2281\nThank you for reporting.\nI'll close this as duplicate (https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2067). Is there anyone you know who speak Chinese to review this PR?. @opw0011 can you solve the conflict?. @opw0011 Ping!. Nice ! LGTM :tada: Thank you for your contribution :tada:. Should we add a checkbox to notify and allow users to not create a new note with selected tags?. Yeah @daiyam that sounds good!. Hey @daiyam is it me or your code causing this problem?\n\n. Would love to see this in the future! . Yeah, I also feel a bit annoying :angry: What should I do? Do you have any idea @daiyam . @daiyam It looks ugly :cry: Is there any other way? Maybe I'll just make a list of option in comment block and contributors can uncomment the applicable option. Oh, that's a brilliant idea! I'll update it soon. @jangtsekiang I have added a link and created a doc for code style in this PR.. I'm not sure, @Rokt33r is pretty busy.. @daiyam Can you answer this issue?. LGTM but I still need @Rokt33r to review this.. Hey @FabioRosado , Welcome to Boostnote! Thank you for your contribution, but do you know someone else can review your change? Because I'm not sure if there's anyone here who speaks Portugal. Feel free to re-open this issue if it happens again. I would love to have that, but currently...no you can't have Cornell-style notes. Maybe someone can implement this.. I don't think it's possible to install \"desktop\" version on IOS devices and the team is working on the new mobile app.. You can search for your header using the dev tool. You can open the dev tool using view > toggle developer tool (ctrl + shift + i). After you find your header you can right click on it and select copy > copy selector.. We have received some reports about missing notes after updating.\nMaybe you can check out these for more info:\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1610, https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1485, https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/901. You're absolutely right, we don't really pay much attention to the docs, therefore the code quality is bad. That's the reason the team is in progress of re-writing this app into a whole new app. But I'll update the docs soon to keep it up to date.. @richardtks It's this repo: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boost. Thank you for reporting. We gonna need more information to identify the problem. What type of note are you in? markdown or code snippet?\n. @kyan001 have you finished this PR? I can still reproduce the bug.. @kyan001 Oops, wrong page :smile: sorry.. This is definitely a great feature to have, thank you for suggesting.. Hey @gregueiras and @susanalima, there's a bounty on this issue so if you want to work on this issue and earn money from it. Then you can sign up with IssueHunt: https://issuehunt.io/ then submit your link to the pull request at this link. After your PR is merged you will be rewarded. Thank you for contributing to Boostnote. Another UI bug :smile: Thank you for reporting.. Why don't you drag your file into the Boostnote editor? Your file name with space will automatically change to something else.. Haha such a silly bug :smile: , thank you for reporting.. In that case, can you make this feature optional? Or should we disable it forever? @arcturus140 . Hey, @federicochiesa do you still have that issue after restart Boostnote or computer?. According to your use case:\n\nSometimes I find myself wanting to scroll up to look at something else as reference while I'm editing. This makes that easier.\n\nI think you should add a hotkey for this so that you won't have to change the setting everytime you want to do that.\n. @nagledb OK, we will merge it later. Hope that you can implement hotkey for this in the next PR.\nHere is my last PR for the hotkey system, maybe you can get some information from it:\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1929. @mehr-licht Can you fix the eslint error?. @mehr-licht there's nothing wrong with your test. You need to fix your code style to match eslint rules. You can run:\nnpm run lint\nand the error will display. You can also run the command below to automatically fix those error (there may be some error that needs to be manually fixed)\nnpm run fix. I've seen your new PR, I'll close this PR and review the latest one. @Danmou very sorry for the late review, can you resolve the conflict?. Sorry for the delay, yes can you fix the conflict. . You can custom how the preview mode should be toggled in the setting. In your case, I think you should set it to right click\n\n. @NeverwinterMoon I know what you're thinking, your feature request is kinda like this one: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1971\nThe team hasn't had the time to look into that feature yet. However, I'll tell the team about that feature too, it looks cool :smile: . @NeverwinterMoon The setting is a bit confusing, you must right click to go to preview and when you're in preview mode right click to go back to editor mode. Oh sorry, haha, if so can you open up the dev tool to identify the problem? Please open a new issue for it if necessary.. Thank you for reporting, duplicated: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/382. Thank you for reporting! we'll look into this bug!. Can you describe more about your problem?. We are going to need more information about that, can you install v0.11.10 then run boostnote from the terminal and tell us what is the error printed on the terminal?. Can you provide more information?\n- Which type of note are you using\n- Steps to reproduce the problem. I can't reproduce the bug. Which version are you using?. I think this has been fixed here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2712. Feel free to re-open if it's not.. Currently no, I've been trying to configure it many times but failed every time. It would be great if someone can configure vscode to work with Boostnote.. Fixed in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2571. We'll look into this. Thank for reporting. @masaodev Have you finished the PR? I can still reproduce the old bug.. Fixed in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2589. I don't know why but webpack-dev-server return 404 for the bundle file main.js. I'm on Linux. Can you check again?. The webpack problem is somehow gone, but vscode now said that my breakpoint is Unverified breakpoint.. OK @enyaxu, it works now. I'm not familiar with vscode debug system so thank you for explaining. By the way, can you add the debug instruction to our docs? it's located here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/docs/debug.md. I do not quite understand your feature request. Can you give an example where opening the note in an external code editor will help?. somehow the system prevents the code from starting electron. Make sure you have the right permission for the project folder. You can try to use the sudo command. Although I'm not sure there will be any harm if you use that command (It should not cause any problem).\nsudo yarn run dev. Have you tried sudo chown ?. Did you pull the latest commit from master branch?. or just\nnpm run dev\nAll hail npm. Then it's not the yarn issue. You don't have the latest code. You must pull the new code to your local repo.\nTake a look at the latest package.json\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/37933782d2e0364dc29b94b60bc00ae28f8f5161/package.json#L1-L19. @Paalon you can run the following command to detect the error:\nyarn run test. Can you run boostnote from terminal and paste the error here?. This bug has been fixed in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2484 and will be available in next version (v.0.11.12). Thanks for reporting. I also suspect it is due to your Chinese username.. Hi, thank you for reporting. This is duplicated with https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2225. We will look into this issue. Thank you for reporting. @daiyam why downvote it?. @daiyam In my opinion, centering the badges is not a bad idea. It looks quite nice actually, especially when the previous information is centered. Take a look at one of my repo: https://github.com/ZeroX-DG/SnippetStore (No, I'm not advertising my repo). @daiyam can we agree with the idea of centering the badges or do you have any other ideas?. Hey @mitchellm44 did you submit the wrong repo? . Thank you for reporting. We'll look into this.. @arcturus140 can you fix this lint issue?. @arcturus140 can you fix the lint again? there's still a lint error.\nEDIT: Don't mind me :smile: . @enyaxu your snapshot tests is failing, can you fix it?. You're so fast haha :smile: . Can you run Boostnote from the terminal and tell us the printed error?. This is a known issue and has been fixed in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2484. The fix will be available in the next release so please wait :smiley: . Confirm that it works fine on Linux.. No, it's just I'm a little bit busy. I'll try to review this as soon as possible.. Can you fix the conflict? Thank you.. Please ignore it, the bot is crazy:smile:. Can you clone the repo and start it with npm run dev ?. @caspercode444 it\u2019s the error you show doesn\u2019t related to the current bug. May try delete node_mudule and run yarn to reinstall the dependencies?. Google translate: App crashes when switching networks. I\u2019m thinking of a different name for the export tab. Maybe Markdown tab with the export section in it? We may need to add some markdown related configurations in the future. Another reason is dedicating a whole tab just for export is.....space consuming.. I can reproduce the first issue but I couldn't reproduce the second one, can you provide steps to re-produce it?. Of course I can! I'm the programmer god! My code is concise, OOP or functional I can handle them all. Great programmers collect my quotes and posts to pass to their offspring. Just kidding, the fix for the first bug is simple so I'll make a PR now.. Duplicated https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2614. We currently cannot store all the changes. But when you deleted the note, you can still restore it from the trash section in the left menu.. Thank you, I'll review this this week :+1: . XSS bug and now this? Shame on you hahaha :smile: Anyway, thank you for the fix, I'll review it soon.. Next time, can you translate to English first before submitting the issue? Because most of us use English to communicate. We can't fully understand your issue if we translate it using Google. Thank you.. We currently have no way to search in the preview. Maybe someone can implement it. Can you tell me more why do you need this feature?. Duplicated: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2614. Agree! @daiyam can you reproduce it on Linux? I somehow still can't reproduce it.. It's also a good idea to add a shortcut for special paste. But all the things that pasted in the code blocks should always be text so I guess @daiyam PR is still necessary and it would be nice if we can also implement that special paste shortcut.. Thank you for your contribution @daiyam :smile: . I can't reproduce with linux.. @Rokt33r can you reproduce this bug on MacOS?. The multi select is not supported at the moment and tagging multi selected notes feature has been requested here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2609 and of course, it hasn't been implemented in the current version. Feel free to open a PR :smile: \nHotkey for focusing on the search bar is: ctrl + l\nIf you want to search with tags, please use: the tag view on the left menu bar (the one the right): \n\nEditor view for markdown only can be toggle using the toggle mode button (ctrl + m hotkey)\n\n. Can you open the dev tool and show us the error? ctrl + shift + i is the hotkey for toggling dev tool.. Duplicated: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2628. I don't use AUR so I can't help you with this :cry: Maybe someone else can help you with it.. I can't reproduce the problem have you tried to restart Boostnote?. @jrpope2014 this is probably an issue on windows only. If it happens again, can you take a picture of the dev tool console? You can open the dev tool console by hitting ctrl + shift + i and switch to the console tab.. The message seems to be wrong. Can you fix it too?. English is also my second language so I'm not sure if as a markdown note is correct. For me, I'll use in markdown notes which will become text export only available in markdown notes. What do you think?. I can't reproduce this bug. Have you tried resizing the app? Resizing the app will make the editor to refresh. Maybe it will help.. Duplicated https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2628. @daiyam can you resolve the conflict?. Our shortcut system is pretty messy, currently, you can't customize other hotkeys because they're hardcoded.. Not in the near future, I think. It's pretty messy in the code right now and the project maintainers are very busy and working on a re-write version of this app so it very depends on the community right now.. There's already a PR to fix this bug. Thank you for reporting.. Thank you for your contribution but some users may still want that functionality so I think we'll use this PR https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2689. But thank you for your contribution.. @infosisio great news!.

Thank you.. Very sorry about your problem. This is a known issue and the fix for this has been merged. This won't happen again in the next version. Duplicated: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2614. This is a known issue: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2540. @SofiaCardosoMartins Do you have any solution for this case?\n\n. Maybe we can hide the storage location when the width the too small. Or we can make the storage location to stay under the date information?. Sorry @tiagoacastro , but this bug has already been solved here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2601. We forgot to close the issue.. Wow @gregueiras It looks amazing!. I think this is the intended behavior. If you want you can configure how Boostnote will switch to preview mode in interface tab.\n\n\n. This is a very complicated feature which I think is not suitable for the current app. However, I'll suggest this feature to the dev team to add in the rewrite version of this app.. \nGood news! The re-write version of the app can take care of it.. The lock button doesn't seem to display for me anymore.\n\n. The lock button has now appeared but it appeared in the wrong way. It appear when the editor is in split view but when I change the mode and change it back, it's gone.\n\n. @miguelalexbt I found another bug. If you change from markdown note to a markdown note, the feature works great! But if you can it to a snippet note before changing to a markdown note, the lock button will disappear!\n\n. Although I still need @Rokt33r to review this. Duplicated https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2614. Boostnote doesn't actually store your notes as separate markdown files. They're all organized in a central cson data file. The only solution that I can recommend right now is to export your notes using the export feature then associate them with Zotero. Boostnote also doesn't support auto export yet (I think so) so you must re-export your note everytime you update it.. LGTM but we gonna need someone with more high power to review this issue :smile: @Rokt33r . We are still investigating this bug here https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2669. Duplicated: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2614. I think it's the intended behavior. When you hide the app to the taskbar it basically doesn't have any permission to listen to key shortcut anymore.. I think I was able to reproduce the problem. I have another app using ctrl + alt +space shortcut too and it conflicted with Boostnote shortcut. However, Boostnote doesn't show up and that other app doesn't trigger too. Maybe it's electron window bug. I'll look into it.. This is definitely an electron bug. I tested it with electron@2 and it works fine.. Thank you for reporting, this is a known issue. Please follow it here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2618. Hi! Thank you for reporting, this is a known issue. Please follow it here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2628. I'm not familiar with this CompositionEvent so I'll also need review from @Rokt33r . This is a known issue, please follow it here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2614. I can't export notes with images. Can you check?. @AgentEpsilon ping!. @MihaelBercic It's still in progress and hasn't been merged into the main project so you have to wait for that. Sorry for the inconvenience.. Duplicated https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2614. This is out of scope for Boostnote and will not be implemented (Unless you can convince me with a reasonable reason). However, I'll show you a small trick back when I study for IELTS. Sometimes I want to search for a word on Cambridge dictionary and googling it is slow and just like your case, the link for all the words on Cambridge dictionary website share the same form\nhttps://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/<THE_WORD_RIGHT_HERE>\nSo for example, if I want to search for the word dog I'll need to navigate to\nhttps://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/dog\nSo I created a small javascript code and bookmark it in my browser so everytime I needed to search for a word, I can just click on it and it will as for my word and then navigate to the correct page.\nThe code is:\njavascript:word = prompt(\"word to search\");if(word)window.open(\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/\" + word, \"_blank\")\nIn your case, it would be something like this:\njavascript:identifier = prompt(\"Paper identifier\");if(identifier)paperID=prompt(\"Paper ID\");if(paperID && identifier=='arXiv')window.open(\"https://arxiv.org/abs/\" + paperID, \"_blank\");else if(paperID && identifier=='DOI')window.open(\"https://doi.org/\" + paperID, \"_blank\");\nTo add it to your bookmark, you can follow this instructions:\n- In chrome hit ctrl + shift + o and it will take you to the bookmark manager page\n- Then on the top right of the page is an icon with 3 dots. Click on in and select add new bookmark from menu\n- The name section you can pick any name that you want (maybe research paper shortcut)\n- Then input the js code above to the url field and hit save\n- Now the bookmark will appear on your bookmark bar. When ever you need to search for a paper just click on it and it will first ask the identifier of the paper (input DOI or arXiv) Then it will ask for the id of the paper. After you input all the information, it will take you to the right site for the paper.\nGood luck with your research.. Close this as won't fix\n. It works just fine with me (Linux Mint). Can you restart Boostnote to see if it help?. Closed due to inactivity. Hmm...That's strange, I can't highlight the line by clicking on the gutter. Can you check it?. Please fix your eslint error. Also I discover that when my snippet doesn't contain linesHighlighted then the feature won't work at all. You should fallback linesHighlighted to [] if it not existed. Also, can you apply this feature to markdown note too?. I can still reproduce the old bug. You should fallback linesHighlighted to [] if it is null instead of stopping the whole process.. It's an old default snippet note generated by Boostnote.. I have to manually added linesHighlighted to the first note and leave the second note alone (the default note of Boostnote). \n\n. This is a known issue and has been fixed in the next version: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2614. I think you get the wrong idea here. I think what the issue creator means was the codeblock displayed in app has a different background than when it's exported to an html file.. Oh! The issue is the scrollbar. We should hide scrollbar when the sidebar is minimized but the users can still scroll using mouse wheel. Duplicated https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2614. Duplicated https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2351. Currently, I don't think so.. Nothing much just a simple file:\n```\nhello world\n\n```\nThe link is still the same when imported and able to display the image in the preview section. Yes, absolute path would be great!. Now it back to the old issue. It doesn't change the path anymore (I notice the regex has been changed did you do it by accident?). @xvusrmqj I know that you really need this feature but Boostnote is an open source project and is everyone's efforts so next time if you want something, please ask nicely because we don't have the duty to fulfil your requests. Boostnote license clearly said this:\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/13c2f471aa73406f20076326b1ea2c7768cf61c1/LICENSE#L12-L15\nAlso, you can build the app yourself if you feel it's taking too much time. We have a doc about it here:\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/docs/build.md. The correct syntax is ~~text~~. You forgot to close the ~~. @andyklimczak It's the default behavior of CodeMirror: https://codemirror.net/mode/gfm/index.html . I still can use it in the current master.\n\n. Can you hide it with alt ?. Maybe it's a Windows-related issue. It works fine on my Linux machine. I can't test it on Windows right now so maybe someone else can. @daiyam can you test it on Windows?. The heading id in the generated html is encoded, can you fix it as well?\n\n. I can imagine why this happened but it would be great if you can provide a screen shot of the dev console so that I can know the exact problem.. Can you tell me the reason why you put the escapeHTML function in the attachmentManagement file?. @roottool line 397 sounds good, please rewrite your code.. Can you fix the conflict? I think you don't need to restart the app to see the effect. To disable editor scroll bar you can apply the style to the editor component. And for the preview, we can apply the style and call the rewrite function to cause the preview to re-write. I haven't tested it yet but what do you think?. @daiyam I think limiting the width is the right choice. Another option is to re-ordering the icon when the width is too small. But I don\u2019t think it should be that small, if users want, they can always hit ctrl + b. Usually, there will be a message box saying Update available!. Do you have that message box?. The scrollbar is a too big I think. Also, the tag list is overlapped by the toggle button.\n\n. Yeah I think it looks good !. @richardtks can you push your code?. This is a common feature request but it won't be implemented in the current version. The dev team is working on a rewrite version of Boostnote and this feature will be available there.. Thank you for your contribution but I think your PR is duplicated with this PR: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2689. This sound like a critical bug. @Rokt33r can you reproduce the issue on mac?. @Margarida-Silva I'll review and approve this PR soon for your uni course so if you can provide me with more information about this PR I'll be able to speed up the review process. I don't know how much time you can wait for this PR to be approved so please don't hesitate to tell me if you need this PR to be reviewed faster.. Please fix the conflict and also I encounter this error when I run the app.\n\n. I'm sorry @Cesar-Medeiros, this is the PR that causing the bug above: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2768, please merge the master branch again to fix this bug. Also, I found 2 bugs related to your PR.\nFirst bug: When I add a new file, the highlight for that note is wrong. Demo:\n\nSecond bug: After I added that new file, I tried to update its' content using Boostnote and then using external editor. After that I switch to a new note and the app crashed and this error printed in the terminal (This is probably a Linux related bug):\nGtk-Message: GtkDialog mapped without a transient parent. This is discouraged.\n/home/zerox/Desktop/Projects/Boostnote/node_modules/electron/dist/electron --type=renderer --no-sandb[8119]: ../../vendor/node/src/fs_event_wrap.cc:91:static void node::(anonymous namespace)::FSEventWrap::GetInitialized(const FunctionCallbackInfo<v8::Value> &): Assertion `wrap != nullptr' failed.\n 1: node::Abort() [/home/zerox/Desktop/Projects/Boostnote/node_modules/electron/dist/libnode.so]\n 2: 0x7f347fd4a422 [/home/zerox/Desktop/Projects/Boostnote/node_modules/electron/dist/libnode.so]\n 3: 0x7f347fd3f5fa [/home/zerox/Desktop/Projects/Boostnote/node_modules/electron/dist/libnode.so]\n 4: 0x295cd9c07841. @Cesar-Medeiros Editing in Boostnote update the file content works fine but now when I edit the note using an external app, it won't update in Boostnote, sometimes the app crashed and the second bug appears. Also, when I rename the file and switch to other note before switching back to that note, the app carshed and again the second bug appears.. The problem seems to occur only when I edit with Linux gedit app. I used Typora to edit the file and it works fine.. Have you tried to search in the editor? . Looks like we gonna need some improvements on searching experience for each individual note. We have received some issues related to the poor searching experience. Unfortunately, I'm a bit busy now so maybe someone else can fix this but I'll also try to fix this issue when I have time.. Maybe the same isssue as https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2636 ?. This bug has been fixed in 0.11.12 (latest release). Please update Boostnote. Works fine for me on Linux\n\n. We currently don't have a doc like that. I think this is a good chance to add a FAQ.md file. What do you think @Rokt33r. @empeje we have the permission can you create a FAQ.md file and add this to it?. This bug also doesn't occur on Linux. I can't test this because I'm using Linux. I'll have to leave this to @Rokt33r . Please change your setting in Interface tab. In preview section change the Sanitization to Allow dangerous HTML tag.. The team will work on the mobile app in the future (after we finish the rewrite version of Boostnote) but we don't have the exact schedule for that.. How about something like this. (A quick draw using figma)\n\nOn white theme:\n\n. @elfman The tag textColor doesn't feel right in the tag. You can use this module: https://github.com/onury/invert-color to generate the tag text color base on the tag background.. Looks nice! But the x symbol is....you get the idea :smile:\n\n. How careless of me! Sorry guys :cry: . Works fine on Linux but I haven't tested it on window or mac. @richardtks which os you used to test this?. @Rokt33r I think he's talking about this line of code:\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/0289caad670fd8c3a8f8e1cac09fb1ca5c2e91fd/lib/main-window.js#L9\nWith the current code, the menu only show for Windows OS and it will be hidden on other OS unless the user press Alt.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/0289caad670fd8c3a8f8e1cac09fb1ca5c2e91fd/lib/main-window.js#L25. Actually you can! Go to setting > interface > scroll to bottom you will see a custom css box. You can customize the size there.. Well, #<space>text = <h1>text</h1> is the markdown syntax and there's no way you can change it. If you remove the space then it will become the normal text #text. You can see the markdown syntax here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#headers. @HatterTheMadd You can add the space between it. You just need to wrap it inside a codeblock like this.\n\nIt will generate this:\n```\ntext\n``. Thanks, do you know someone who can review this PR?. @Rokt33r for PR that provide translation, how many reviews do we need before we can merge it?. @daiyam I think it's just something like eslint for security :smile: They have solutions in each issue, for example, we can fix the 3rd issue by replacingnew BuffertoBuffer.from.. Thank you for reporting this issue. I think you should follow this issue here because it describes the issue better: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2773. @Rokt33r Should he fix it in this PR or just leave it and you can open another PR to fix it?. I still need @Rokt33r to review the translation before we can merge this.. Sorry for the delay. @Rokt33r is very busy at the moment. Maybe he will review this weekend.. This bug has been fixed in this PR: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2586. You can customize this behavior in the next version.. @elfman ping. Maybe related with this? https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2639. @ehhc Can you answer this question?. I think it looks OK but I can't really test it because I'm on Linux. I'll need @Rokt33r to review this.. Can you provide steps to reproduce the error?. I'm really sorry @MiloTodt but there's already a PR before this one: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2576. Thank you for your contribution anyway!. Hi @MiloTodt, I'm the creator of thatcustom css box. It allows users to customize the CSS for the markdown preview and not the whole entire app. If you find this feature is unusual, what do you suggest for this feature? How should it be displayed? I welcome new ideas :smiley: . Stop breaking the app, normal users don't do that, why can't you just use it like a normal user? :smile: Just kidding, thanks for reporting, I'll fix this bug asap.. Can you show users an alert that their note contains undefined file? I afraid after this PR people will open issues saying \"Boostnote doesn't save my image\" :smile: . @Rokt33r Since this is an electron-related PR I think we should test it more. Can you test it on Mac and Windows?. Thank you for this PR, can you update the version in our LICENSE file too?\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/5a9de1a95d0faee326aac34196667c5c52970f70/LICENSE#L5. An idea for the person who interested in implementing this issue. Maybe a smart copy shortcut for examplectrl + shift + cand the actual link to images will be added to the copied content.\n. @hfredriksson have you tried to paste withctrl + shift + v?. Can you take a picture of your hotkey setting?. Nice feature!. Can you take a picture of your storage setting? Also if you can, please provide us a picture of theconsole` in devtool. Also, the current latest version is 0.11.12. Please upgrade from 0.11.2 to the latest version and see if the problem fixed.. Duplicated https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2639. But thanks for reporting! :wink: . Works fine for me?\n\nHere's my setting:\nEditor\n\nPreview\n\n. I think this is an upstream issue of Fira Code. There's an issue open for that: https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/issues/261.. Will do!. I don't know if that's the expected behavior. What do you think @Rokt33r . I see you're using markdown note. You have to wrap your code into a code block to enable syntax highlight in markdown note (Just like how github markdown works).\n``py\ncurve.py\n\\``py\n    #----------------------------------------------------------\n    # File curve.py\n    #----------------------------------------------------------\n    import bpy\ndef createBevelObject():\n    # Create Bevel curve and object\n    cu = bpy.data.curves.new('BevelCurve', 'CURVE')\n    ob = bpy.data.objects.new('BevelObject', cu)\n    bpy.context.scene.objects.link(ob)\n\n    # Set some attributes\n\n```\n``. Currently, we handle import as markdown note and there's no way to import a file as a snippet note. I'll set this as a feature request. Maybe someone can implement this functionality.. Dragging the image into editor works fine for me on Linux both the current version and this PR. Seem that Linux is not affected by this bug.. In my case, the tag only appears when I restart the app. Thank @sharif1093 for reporting this.. Works fine for me on 0.11.13. What's the menu bar that you're talking about?. I'm sorry, I can't test this, we don't have edit menu on Linux and ctrl + a works fine. I will have to leave this to @Rokt33r . Also appears on Linux. Maybe thevertical-alignneed to adjust a bit. . Is it a duplicate of https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2803 ?. I've known why my problem occurred, If I pick a folder then everything works fine, but if I select the storage location instead of a folder, then the sort option won't change for the storage location (still works for folder).. Also when I try to search for multiple times, sometimes the cursor jump to the editor (the focus switch to the editor) and my search input will be typed in the editor. Another reason is the max listener error online:jumpevent.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12984316/51881920-948c9180-23af-11e9-8eeb-9f022cd81df6.png)\n. Thank you for reporting, we are discussing this issue here: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2834. Please follow us there.. @Rokt33r do we need a setting for this?. @Rokt33r I think leaving CommonMark compliant as default seem reasonable but could potentially confuse current users. What do you think that we should do?. Duplicated https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2823. I can't re-produce the bug, can you check again if it still there? Thank you.. Can you describe more about your problem? Was the storage folder deleted or it doesn't show up  in the app?. @MiloTodt The fix rotate function used to rotate the image into the right direction. You can take a look at this PR for more information: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2322. Fixed in https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2835. I gonna need more information on this. I can't reproduce this problem with just theHellostep :smile: \n. Works fine for me in v0.11.13, you should try update to the latest version.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12984316/52330085-551e0f00-2a59-11e9-91be-8fb0629293d3.png)\n. Works fine for me on v0.11.3. You can try update to the latest version to see if the problem is fixed.. You can switch your setting toAllow dangerous HTML tags` in Interface setting and everything will be good\n\n. Can you explain more about what you're trying to archive with this PR?. Can you tell me what version are you using?. Can you try using our latest version 0.11.15?. @ekoeditaa yes, CodeMirror take care of the highlighting so this probably an upstream issue. However, Boostnote also has a custom mode here https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/tree/master/extra_scripts/codemirror/mode/bfm. @ekoeditaa Yes, you should do it in the bfm grunt task because the style file will be overridden when the task is executed. You can go to help -> cheatsheet to view it. Your code make all tags disappear, can you check again?. Oh, that's my fault, it working fine now.. Same problem as https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2834. Definitely, a nice feature to have.. Duplicated https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/2885. Feel free to re-open the issue if you believe it's not a duplication.. Thanks for reporting but we already have someone reported this issue: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1994\nGood thing is there's a PR for that ready: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2724. Can you try using our latest version? v0.11.15. I submitted a PR for this: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2914. Thank you for reporting.. It works fine for me on Linux. I'll close this issue for now, feel free to re-open if you believe this is a Boostnote bug. If you do want to re-open this issue then please attach some screenshot for us to investigate easier.. Currently you can customize the preview style using the custom css box in the interface setting (at the bottom).. Currently you can set the cursor position using the string \u2018:{}\u2019. However, you won\u2019t be able to tab through all the place....yet.. That's strange, I can't reproduce the problem. Can you try it again?. Can you describe more about your problem. Are you using any special input method like Japanese, etc?. I'll try to review this soon. Sorry for the wait @janat08 . You're right :smile: I think leaving just 1 default snippet is enough, will fix it soon. First time I heard of path.sep new stuff to learn! thanks!. oh I was busy at that time, I'll add some tests for it :smile: . Yes, I've noticed that and discovered that your version seem to work fine and not the source of the problem as when I revert to your version and change the escape for the & char to '&ampssssss;' The html exported still use &amp; which is quite wierd and I'll re-investigate the problem.. Can you remove the { and } to retain the code style. Can you remove the { and } to retain the code style. Like this:\n(modifiedValue) => currentEditor.setValue(modifiedValue). Can you use Object destructuring to retain the code style?\nconst { note, snippetIndex } = this.state\nconst currentMode = note.snippets[snippetIndex].mode. Here, you can use template string:\nthis.refs[`code-${snippetIndex}`].refs.code.editor. Why do you need an empty callback? Please remove it if you accidentally put it there.. > The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. \nThis regex will also valid for line that started with 4 dashes. You should remove the , there.. Well that's annoying :smile: maybe because the plugin did check if the callback function is provided or not and assume that's there :smile: . I think we should stick to the traditional --- :smile: . I still think we should display the markdown if the front-matter syntax is invalid. For example:\n```\n\nlayout: default\nsdasdasdasdasd\n```\nShould display:\n\nWith the current behavior (hide all content) the user will get confuse.\nHere is my suggestion for the plugin:\n```js\nmodule.exports = function frontMatterPlugin (md) {\n  function frontmatter (state, startLine, endLine, silent) {\n    if (startLine !== 0 || state.src.substr(startLine, state.eMarks[0]) !== '---') {\n      return false\n    }\nlet line = 0\nlet isFrontMatterClosed = false\nwhile (line < state.lineMax) {\n  line++\n  if (state.src.substring(state.bMarks[line], state.eMarks[line]) === '---') {\n    isFrontMatterClosed = true\n    break\n  }\n}\n\nstate.line = line + 1\n\nreturn isFrontMatterClosed\n\n}\nmd.block.ruler.before('table', 'frontmatter', frontmatter, {\n    alt: [ 'paragraph', 'reference', 'blockquote', 'list' ]\n  })\n}\n```\nThe the modification above, the front-matter will be displayed out if it's invalid and will be hide only when it's valid.. > On Macintosh keyboards, this is the \u2318 Command key. On Windows keyboards, this is the Windows key (\u229e Windows).\nI don't know how it looks on MacOS but on Windows and Linux, the meta key is used to open the main menu therefore when you hit meta key + click link, the link does open in the browser but the menu is also displayed which is quite annoying.\nI think you will have to change this key to something else. Also you can't set it to ctrl on windows and linux as it's the key for multi-cursor in codemirror. Shift perhaps?. I think you should not change the language name because if someone \"accidentally\" change the language to Polish, it's really hard for them to find their desired language if they don't speak Polish :smile: . Please use const instead of let. Haha, amazing right? I also discorvered the for-of loop a few months ago :smile: I realized that I've been in stone age for years :smile: . Suggested change to fix a small display bug:\nz-index: 10\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\n. You preview font size is too small, you can set it to 24 and you will see the problem. I think you shouldn't re-find the selected note again because the selected note is already been searched at the top of the handleNoteContextMenu function. Please re-use the selected note in the handleNoteContextMenu function to improve performance for the app.. I think you should leave it as its. English is my second language so please correct me if I'm wrong.\nReference: https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/usage/its-or-it-s. I'm sorry, I'll fix it right away :smile: . Good idea!. That console.log is actually there by design :smile: Please undo you change :smile: . Should we leave the console.log here? Maybe it will come in handy in the future when the users hit some issue related to the config and they can capture this console.log?  @Rokt33r @sosukesuzuki . Yes, clearly logging AWS credentials is a bad idea (maybe it was for debugging purpose have the team forgot to remove it :smile: ) I also agree that console logging the config is a bad idea, but before we can invent some kind of a button to take the current config and attach it to the new issue page, leaving the config in the console for people to take a screenshot of is not a bad idea.. This hotkey is pure evil on Linux. It close all applications and go back to the login screen. Can you change it to Ctrl + Shift + Backspace. This condition is really long and may confuse new contributors, can you assign some parts of the condition into variables with meaningful names?. I don't think onClick is a good name, I think you should rename it to something like onClearCheckboxClick?. I think you should trim() this string first. If I leave a leading blank space the title will be broken because <space>title != title and you should add test for that too :smiley: . @daiyam Thanks for the feedback, I've updated the message. Do you have any other idea?. Hmm...I guess you're right. I approve your change and maybe open an issue for it.. Please change this.props.config to config . I think a simple ternary operator will be faster than using math function.\nsuggestion\n      const startIndex = firstSelectedNoteIndex < lastSelectedNoteIndex ? firstSelectedNoteIndex : lastSelectedNoteIndex. Github suggestion is so cool :smile: \nsuggestion\n      const endIndex = firstSelectedNoteIndex > lastSelectedNoteIndex ? firstSelectedNoteIndex : lastSelectedNoteIndex. Please change BoostNote to Boostnote (the n is lowercase). Please remove (#) at the end of each link.. suggestion\n![debugger](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11307908/24343879/9459efea-127d-11e7-9943-f60bf7f66d4a.png). suggestion\n2. Pressing **Shift+Command+B** or running **Run Build Task** from the global **Terminal** menu, then pick the task named **Build Boostnote**. Or run `yarn run watch` from the terminal.. suggestion\n4. Select the configuration named **Boostnote All** from the **Debug configuration**, then click the green arrow button or press **F5** to start debugging.. suggestion\n5. Now you should find **Boostnote** is running. You will see two processes running, one named **Boostnote Main** and the other named **Boostnote Renderer**. Now you can set **debug breakpoints** in vscode. If you find your **breakpoints** is unverified, you need to switch to the appropriate process between **Boostnote Renderer** and **Boostnote Main**.. What's this addSnippet function :smile: . The ctrl + l shortcut focuses the search bar, is that the correct behavior?. Maybe something like:\n// If the first character is not \"open code blocks character \" then return false\nSeem redundant hahaha :smile: . Can you add some comment explaining the regex?. Why did you change this? Can you share your thought on this?. The message is not really clear to me. Maybe something like: Show full date information in note list? I'm bad at naming stuff :smile: . Will it be faster if we just loop the highlighted lines?\njs\nconst totalHighlightedLines = this.editor.options.linesHighlighted.length;\nconst totalAvailableLines = this.editor.lineCount();\nfor (let i = 0; i < totalHighlightedLines; i++){\n  const lineNumber = this.editor.options.linesHighlighted[i];\n  if (lineNumber > totalAvailableLines) {\n    // make sure that we skip the invalid lines althrough this case should not be happened.\n   continue;\n  }\n  this.editor.addLineClass(lineNumber, 'text', 'CodeMirror-activeline-background');\n}. Can you move e.prevenDefault() to the this.handleDrop?. Can you move e.prevenDefault() to the this.handleDrop?. Can you move e.prevenDefault() to the this.handleDrop?. Can you explain how can you use the map function here? I thought storageMap was a map and it doesn't have map function? The feature works great, but I'm not quite understand there :smile: . Can you close the printout window after we save it to pdf?. Instead of looping through the promiseArray, can you use Promise.all?. Can you use path.dirname for this? It's much faster than using Regex\n\n. Can you change the name attachName[groupIndex] into something like attachmentPath? Also if you do that, you might want to change the attachPath variable into attachmentPaths (with the s). Also with the current code, it only supports absolute attachment. Can you also support relative path? You can check the relative or absolute path using path.isAbsolute in the path module.. I think you should improve your code by eliminating repeating code. Maybe something like this will be shorter.\n```js\nwhile (attachPath) {\n  let attachmentPath = attachPath[groupIndex];\n  attachmentPaths.push(attachmentPath);\nattachmentPath = path.isAbsolute(attachmentPath) ? attachmentPath : path.join(path.dirname(filepath), attachmentPath);\n  promiseArray.push(this.copyAttachment(attachmentPath, storageKey, noteKey));\nattachPath = nameRegex.exec(markDownContent);\n}\n``. You don't need tobind(this)in an arrow function, thethiskeyword will point to the class if you use arrow function.. Right here too, please change it to{(e) => this.handleOnChange(e)}. Should we allow users to customizedevTool?. Well maybe a user will change it (without knowing what it does) because it conflict with the hotkey that they want and next time they can\u2019t open the dev tool using that hotkey anymore. But I think we can help the user in that case so I guess we can leave it :smile:. I'm thinking of a scenario where a user wants to use the shortcut that was assigned todevToolso the customizabledevToolshortcut in this case is useful. Can you move this to the top of the file?. Please at leastconsole.errorthe error. It might come in handy in the future.. Why did you have to catch for errors in the previous line 150 and not here?. It looks better withborder: none. Also when I hover the button, its' background is transparent\n![ab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12984316/50546942-4aef4080-0c63-11e9-9600-f45dfd0e642a.gif)\n. Should you check forconfig.editor.snippetDefaultLanguage === 'Auto Detect'here too?. Somehow I can now run the test without adding those lines. @anasasilva can you re-run the test without those lines?. I don't see thecheckUpdate` method in this file, is this a mistake? If it not can you explain this to me?. Can you change the background of the input according to the theme? For example, in Monokai theme here is the background of the search input:\n\nThe background of other inputs:\n\n. The position doesn't feel right to me. \n\n. I don't see where this ref is used. Please remove it if you don't use it. :smiley: . Do we really need a package just for checking the app is in development? Can we just use the old fashion way like this?\nconst isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'. Why do we have to re-check if the app is in development if we already check it in the checkUpdate function?. I think the old way is enough for this task because electron-is-dev does almost the same thing:\n\n. Well, I think you're right. Let's just leave it then.. Why do you need to check for this too when you already filtered non-exists storage path above?. I'm still a little bit concern about this. Can you change to this just for safe:\n'ELECTRON_IS_DEV' in process.env && process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'. This may sound silly but can you explain to me how this works? :smile:  Why did you multiply ratio with clientWidth / maxWidth?. Shouldn't it be:\njs\nif (this.props.snippet.name !== prevProps.snippet.name). I don't see onChange passed to SnippetTab props. Is this a mistake?. Why do you need to select all iframes like this? The markdown preview only contains 1 iframe, then why did you have to find all iframes and loop through them? Can you explain this to me?. Little suggestion, you can transform this code into:\njs\nconst zoomImgTop = (document.body.clientHeight - zoomImgHeight) / 2\nThis way, we only need to do 2 calculation instead of 3. We can just go for the 2nd method, I don't think there's any reason to change the MarkdownPreview class name. In case we were going to change it, a simple search & replace for the MarkdownPreview class wouldn't be hard.. No problem :+1: This is a great feature!. How about calling it Default note sort? . Yes, you can just go with the after code :+1: . Can you change to Default note sort here too?\njson\n\"Default note sort\": \"Default note sort\"\n. Any reason why you deleted this config?. Can you fix the indentation here?. Please don't use markdown mode here. We set the mode according to the props or self-detecting language result if the CodeEditor is used in snippet note.\nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/885f656d3458af090c62f81b4f8a1c775effcdc6/browser/components/CodeEditor.js#L357-L361. Why can't we? We can just replace it with '\\n# ' don't you think?. You're right!. Why don't you just replace the calc with 67%?. Just a small request, can you change the browser window show property to false? Thanks!. ",

    "titoesteves": "@asmsuechan I never thought about GitHub integration. That would be quite interesting actually. I guess the one downside is that you would not be able to utilize the GitHub mobile app as a note app client. Whereas with simplenote/evernote you can use the mobile app as a note app client.\nOn another note, I tried out Boostnote today and I have to say it is really great! Much nicer than both evernote and simplenote. Add sync capabilities and it is the perfect note taking app for developers. . I agree. The primary goal of having sync IMO is so that you can access notes on your mobile device. The ever2boost cli tool seems to be a migration tool but does not address the ability to access notes on mobile devices. Storing directory on a cloud drive also does not achieve this. Seems there is already a feature request for mobile clients already: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/335. . ",
    "Aivean": "I think Evernote sync is a must-have. A lot of developers (including me) are using Evernote day-to-day (especially on mobile devices) and some alternative software with markdown support for complex notes.\nFor example, I use Marxi.co. It's good, but not perfect (paid, buggy, unmaintained). However, it's integration with Evernote is worth mentioning, as, I think, it's as good as it could be.\nTo conclude, I think that adding Evernote support is the way to attract new users. People who use evernote already wont switch to an alternative (unless alternative is as cross-platform and feature-rich). However, they will use an alternative in addition to evernote to get markdown support.. Hi @asmsuechan. Thank you for your work. \nI checked ever2boost, but I didn't try it. My point is that people that use Evernote usually don't want to switch over from it. Evernote is a great project (perhaps a leader in the field), it's cross-platform and very feature-rich.  I'm mostly happy with Evernote, the only feature that it lacks, in my opinion, is markdown support.\nI believe that your project can attract users like me if it has integration with evernote. Users that will use it together with evernote, not as a replacement of evernote.. ",

Thanks for your fix!\nI'll approve!. thanks for your contributing.\nSorry, the code causing this bug was written by my review. \nThe reason why I did such a review is that because if we select cancel, Boostnote select next note, like below.\n\n(This video was captured in this PR.)\nIf you can, I want you to fix it too.. \nIf we update keyword in search box, code editor is hidden and markdown preview is shown.\nThis behavior is not great.. Yes, I want such.. Because, a folder which was used by Boostnote cannot be basically used on other software.\nIf user unlink storage in Boostnote, actually, that folder is left there. To delete it perfectly, after all, we must delete it manually.\nSo, I think function which unlink a storage on Boostnote is unnecessary..

Please wait for release next version(v0.11.7) !:pray:. @KMR-zoar Thanks for your bug report. This bug is depends on Markdown mode of CodeMirror.\n. @limgit I felt this inconvenient too. But this bug happens only on darcula theme. And this bug is resolved by CodeMirror v5.39.0!(CodeMirror which Boostnote depends on is v5.37.0)(Please look this update.) So, I think custom cursor is unnecessary. Just enough updating CodeMirror version.\n. @limgit Oh, Thank you for using Boostnote and creating great issue:smile:\nI'll close this issue after update CodeMirror version!. @infosisio I see. I put label \"discussion\"!.  @jenniferlynparsons @jenpen This issue is resolved by #2110 !! Please wait for release next version(v0.11.7)!. @catmeme This issue is resolved by #2110 ! Please wait for release next version(v0.11.7)!. This behavior also occurs in places other than item of SnippetList. For example, right click on item of NoteList, Item of FolderList.\n.  @mothule Finder was discarded from v0.9.0(#1497). So, I'll close this issue.. @clone1612 I created #2158 to fix context menu bug too. (I did not intentionally duplicate it.:bow:)\nBoostnote has util function to show popup context menu(browser/lib/context). I think it is better than to use raw menu.popup. So, I want to close this OR. Are you okay?. @ZeroX-DG Can you change the label \"in review\" => \"next release(v.0.11.9)\" ?. Note: \n- 1st issue:\n  + react-debounce-render causes delay in a note display. I use it to improve the delay in displaying notes. However, I think that we should revert to not use this library to fix bugs. (The reversing should not cause fatal problems.)\n\n2nd & 3rd issues\nThees seems to be caused by react-debounce-render. However, I can not find out why yet currently...:bow:\n(Viewed from Elements of the developer tool, the style of CodeEditor and MarkdownPreview seems to be strange). @daiyam \nI am not familiar with front-matter. :bow:\nis the below you expected? or bug?\nWhen you start writing front-matter from the second line, it is not hidden.\n\n\n. @ehhc \nIt cannot work in my local environment(MacOS 10.13.5)...\n\n(/Users/suzuki/Downloads/History.plist exists.)\n.

I'll put label \"help wanted!\".. @ehhc Confirm that it works on my local environment!(MacOS 10.13.5). Thanks.I had overlooked it. I'll correct it.. Thanks! I'll correct the indents.. Thanks for correcting my code. I think that it is readble than my code. I'll rewrite it.. Thank you for your advice ! I will fix it soon.\n. Sorry, I'll fix it soon.. Thank you for commenting. I'll change it.. Thank you commenting, I'll rename it to rearrageFolder. Thank you commenting, I'll change it.. Thank you commenting, at first I thought that would be nice, but when I actually did that, it did not work properly. But, I think I will try using dataApi again.. thank you commenting, I'll correct it.. Do you think which dataApi should I use? Should I use updateFolder?\n. thank you commenting, I'll try using 'updateFolder'.. Perhaps it is impossible to update the order of the folders with updateFolder .. OK, I'll create a new method named 'moveFolder'.. Thanks for commenting. I think that your code is simple and good. I'll correct it.. thanks,  OK.. Thanks commenting @asmsuechan .I agree with your opinion. So, I changed to Deleting the folder only when the folder creation succeeds.\n. Thank you for commenting ! Surely it is difficult to understand it mean. I'll fix it.. Thank you for commenting!  Surely, It's long to using for than using foreach. So, I'll fix it.. Thank you for telling me. Oh... I had overlooked + and *. I'll add these operator.\n. Thanks for commenting ! I'll fix it soon.. Thanks for commenting @asmsuechan ! \nEven now, the background color of the folder that is hover while dragging is supposed to change. How do you want the background color to change?\n. Thanks for commenting. I'll fix it soon.\nHowever, such a code is often used in Boostnote. For example, there are many other codes that use for, not forEach. We should fix it. I'll do it before long.\n. Thank you for commenting! I think so, too. I'll change it.. Thank you for telling it me! I'll add className 'searchInput' to input in Topbar/index.js.\n. Thank you for commenting! That is so simple and so good. I'll change to it.. Thank you for commenting! Certainly it is simple and easy to understand.. Hi @gabber12 !  I am a Boostnote maintainer . We want to improve the code which modal know other components. So, it is hard to merge this PR, now. Also, We'll discuss the matter. However, it would be very appreciated if you would improve it.. Well, it certainly is.\nSince mixpanel treats such an event as 'MAIN_FOCUSED', I thought that it is easy for the founder to understand, so I made this event name like this.\nBut this is hard to understand for user, so I will change it to 'START'.\nOr maybe you come up with something good name?.  thank you for your opinion.\nBase your opinion, I think that this event's name is  'APP_STARTED' is befitting.. data.noteMap has map function, but it has not filter function.\nWe can get array of noteObject by usingdata.noteMap.map(note => { return note }.. I think that's true.\nMost of the styles used in this pull request at this stage will be changed later, but I will fix it.. I think that's true.\nI forgot to use it ...\u3000I will modify it to use it.. Thank you telling me it! \nI'll fix it!. Thank you for telling me.\nI fixed it at 83002ad .. I think we should change the platform name because aws-sdk-mobile-analytics-js 's README says Optional valid values: 'Android', 'iPhoneOS', 'WindowsPhone', 'Blackberry', 'Windows', 'MacOS', 'Linux' . ( ref: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-mobile-analytics-js/blob/master/README.md/#add-app-details-to-events). Please use const instead of var.\nIn a modern browser, please use let or const.\n. I think so too \ud83d\ude22 . Parent of this component(MarkdownNoteDetailComponent) is need this.value.\nlike below:\nhandleChange (e) {\n  const { note } = this.state\n  note.content = this.refs.content.value\n  this.setState({note})\n}\n. fix by c53542e \ud83d\ude03 . 8a472b4 !. 91cebc2 \ud83d\udc4d . We don't think it is unnecessary to add .idea and .vscode into .gitignore. However, if many contributors want it, we'll add it. \ud83d\ude04 \nAnd,  This pull request is \"fixed global styles\". could you create new pull request for add it.?\ud83d\ude4f . thanks for your commenting!\nI fixed it on b7e43d9. dialog is never used.\nI think import is unnecessary on line 31.. I want you to make don't call ee.emit('line:next') when I push cancel. \n(please fix it too on SnippetNoteDetail.js.)\n\n. remote and electron are unnecessary.. please remove this blank line.. Thanks for telling it me.\nI'll fix it.. done 7771875. please remove markdown and findNoteTitle, because there are never used.. The problem that I commented on was caused by the code you removed with this PR. So I thought it should be settled with this PR. But if you do not want it, I'll fix it with another PR.. please remove router. It is never used.. I see. I think it is better than calling the dispatch handler.\nbut, if we delete a note in trash, Boostnote select nothing, like below.\n\nthis behavior is not we hope.\n. I want you to rename variables.\nBecause, it is difficult to understand meaning of s, t, f for me.\nAnd, please refactor for conditional operator, like below.\nf = t < 0.5\n  ? 2 * t * t\n  : -1 + (4 - 2 * t) * t\n. duplicate declaration lang. Please follow eslintrc. This function is duplicated of it.\nI want you to extract to browser/lib.. What is this for?. () for a single argument and return are unnecessary in arrow functions.\nplease rewrite like below:\njsx\nlanguages.map(language =>\n  <option value={language.locale} key={language.locale}>{i18n.__(language.name)}</option>). locales is never reassigned. Please use const instead of let.. And this duplicates with this lines. \nPlease export locales from this file and import locales from this file in browser/main/Main.js.. please confirm this review.

Maybe a red circle on the right of the input field or a Button next to the inputfield to record.. I think one tab would be better for UX. You could write down a note, that Boostnote has to be restarted.\nI thought about the keyboard feature of ubuntu for example.\n\nThere you click on the box and it gos into record mode, when you hit \"esc\" it stopps, when you hit \"enter\" it accepts.\n.

Simply start the 'Boostnote-Portable.cmd' and you should have your portable version.\nBasically it all depends on these parameters:\n\nRerouting of the USERPROFILE Variable\nThe portable folders AppData\\Roaming must already exist when starting the executable\nThe storage path must be entered as .\\profile\n\nHave fun :). Well I already checked the registry and there's nothing there. \nSo you're safe to go with a simple batch file as I do myself for some time now. Making a PortableApps Version is easy enough but only makes sense if there's a lot going on with files and registry.\nBut here, once you've set up the storage, there's absolutely nothing else you need..

PortableApps packed programs are not always the holy grail. Many different authors trying to meddle with things you cannot control, because you don't have the source code. More than often they're simply copying large amounts of data from and to the registry and/or some appdata or other folder which is far from elegant and like bombing a mouse out of the house with C4.\nWell with a simpe batch this can't happen, because you're seeing what's going on. \nHaving said this, here's the AutoIt Source from the executable in case you want to recompile it yourself:\nBoostnotePortable-Sources.zip\n. Well for me my solution is more compact, faster and more elegant. But feel free to contact the PortableApps guys.. What the hell guys? There are plenty of simple helper tools to create a PortableApps version in a couple of minutes. \nI can still see no sense at all in having that if a tiny and simple batch does all that and works just fine.\nSince the storage path doesn't recognize a portable path itself, the only viable option to enhance portability lies with the developers themselves. So just ask then.\n. ",

The extra work of creating a batch file, extra directories, extra somethings - it's silly, but it's just enough of a hindrance/nuisance I don't bother for most apps.\nThe PortableApps platform makes it so easy - I've tried dozens of apps that I would not have tried if I had to install the the \"normal\" way - I hate polluting the registry and user area with crap; not everything gets cleaned up when uninstalling.  Of those dozens, I've kept 3 or 4 of them.  (e.g., I tried CintaNotes, Keepnote, The Guide, Redbook, and CherryTree - and settled on CherryTree; not perfect, but close to what I want.

Hi @adtofaust, unfortunately I stopped working on it. Upon digging into the code, I found out that it is not DRY and a Shotgun surgery is needed to implement this feature. It will just take up too much effort to push this through. \ud83d\ude15. Good point. Then probably supporting multiple opened notes via tab would be the way to go.

Thanks once more for the great assistance. Configured the clean chroot and discovered you were right about the missing git makedepend, fixed that one and pushed it asap. Looking at the npm warning these can indeed be done with a patch, will definitely look into that (ideally upstream of course).\nWill also look further into the namcap warnings!\nEDIT\nReleased a new package version which fixes all warnings save one:\nnpm WARN prefer global coffee-script@1.12.4 should be installed with -g\nAlso incorporated the suggestions from tensor5. Co-creator of the PKGBUILD here, the cause for this issue is that you are missing the 'patch' package. The build was made for and tested with Arch where this package is always installed but this does not seem to be the case for Manjaro. Try to first install patch with pacman -S patch and then install Boostnote again, it should work..

They worked fine with 0.8.9 yesterday but with the new version none can be shown, all showing the same error.. Ow well that explains a lot :) But maybe change the release page then, thanks for the very quick response!\n\nEDIT: I now notice I was looking at releases from this repository and not the boostnote-releases repository which got me confused. It's not released yet on the other, sorry for the inconvenience.\nEDIT 2: Since it now seems to have been officially released -> I still encounter the error. Version 0.8.10, built from source shows the previously described behavior.  . More specific error + a new one which pops up after switching between notes:\n\nSo to summarize my problem:\n- Notes can not be shown, screen remains on create a new post\n- Clicking on different notes leads to the errors shown in the previous image\n- Not happening in 0.8.9 (same note storage, did not add anything new with 0.8.10)\n- Happens in 0.8.10 on Arch Linux (x64) when compiled from source, being from the tar.gz provided in this Boostnote repository https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/archive/v0.8.10.tar.gz\nEDIT: Continued doing research and tried some different things but no effect. Experimented with different yarn/node versions, .zip or .tar.gz all to no avail. The exact same procedure to build and use the application works perfectly with v0.8.9 but not with the new version.. Continuing to identify where the root of the problem is I finally found an actual helpful error which might give you an idea of where the issue can be found:\n\nWhich leads to a real error message pointing to an actual function:\n\nSo something related to the MarkdownNoteDetail rendering method passing a wrong element type or so.\nEDIT: Found the file where the problem is. Alright the error is to be found in MarkdownNoteDetail.js, the reason why is that I placed the old version of the file back (from v0.8.9) and everything works! So something inside that file leads to the errors.\nEDIT 2: More info. Looking at all the changes made I eventually was able to isolate the problem to TodolistPercentage.js. Something there leads to the error, trying to find the real issue but I'm not that familiar with React.. Fixed with v0.8.11, thanks!. The problem is that for the Arch Linux package we build from source, compile for production and install it (roughly said). But since the source code does not contain the correct url with id building from source and compiling will lead to failed requests.\nSo to summarize the problem:\n- Package for Arch Linux is build, compiled for production and then installed all from the source code (this repo)\n- Url present in the source code does not contain the analytics id so requests to that url will fail. Arch package maintainer here. Fixed it by moving to yarn instead of npm during installation so you should be able to install now. Issue seems to be related to a recent npm release since it did not happen when the latest version of Boostnote was released. I will look into it but by using yarn everyone should be able to install it without issues once again.. Do you by any chance have the analytics enabled? Maintainer of the Arch package here and since we build from source analytics does not work. I have no problem creating notes while it\u2019s disabled (latest build + up to date Arch + analytics disabled). Tried looking for different causes but did not find any.\nFor those wondering why, also the reason why @PureCS his build fails, is that the ID for connecting to their analytics server is not present in the source code (just a placeholder). It\u2019s added during packaging the releases. Seems a failed connect that isn\u2019t yet caught.\n. I have pushed an update for the Arch package @xguse which should already fix the issues you're experiencing. Let me know if any problems remain and I'll try to find a solution for them.\nAlso I've published #950 as a pull request which should fix this error in general, so also your windows compile case @PureCS.. Isn't this the normal behaviour of SQL comments?\nA comment can appear between any keywords, parameters, or punctuation marks in a statement. You can include a comment in a statement in two ways:\n\nBegin the comment with a slash and an asterisk (/&ast). Proceed with the text of the comment. This text can span multiple lines. End the comment with an asterisk and a slash (&ast/). The opening and terminating characters need not be separated from the text by a space or a line break.\nBegin the comment with -- (two hyphens). Proceed with the text of the comment. This text cannot extend to a new line. End the comment with a line break.\n\nVia the Oracle website. These are the two accepted ways to add an SQL comment, which both work in Boostnote:\n\n. Arch package maintainer here. I've been looking into this issue and none of the patches applied during installation seem to be the issue. All works fine as long as the dev dependencies are present, however during the installation we remove all dev dependencies since they should not be needed. When that is done the bug you describe shows up. \nI will continue to look into this and try to find a solution.\nEDIT: Seems more complex than that, needs more looking into\nEDIT 2: Related to npm/yarn difference. When packages are installed with yarn all works without any issues, however when done with npm the bug appears. No idea why since I can't find any changes that could trigger this behaviour done since the previous Boostnote release.\nEDIT 3: Can reproduce the behaviour on Windows. If dependencies are installed with npm the bug appears, if done with yarn it does not.. I've pushed an update to the Arch package that should fix the issue.. I've pushed an update to the Arch package that should fix the issue.. Thanks for the tags! The package is once again up to date.. The jest tests are actually being executed on Travis:\n\nThe Travis CI build however still fails due to following 3 linting errors:\n\n. Thanks for the release tag!. What operating system are you using? For Arch Linux they moved Electron 2 to stable (which is incompatible with Boostnote) where the behaviour you describe appears. However I've already updated the package with a patch (although after your issue was created).. Hmm, so I would say it's Electron related. Is there an error visible on the developer tools console? You can access it with Ctrl+Shift+I.. Yes of course, no problem.. Thanks for the v0.11.11 tag!. ",

    "tonywoode": "Boostnote is amazing! From a users perspective though, i woiuld say this is more than a minor issue, because it troubles using boostnote as a reader of its own documents. \nHere's one of many examples: consider that, whenever i'm in reading/preview mode, reading any previous document I wrote, i want to make minor syntax corrections and other amendments as I go along reading. Consider the user experience of doing that when the cursor jumps back to the top of the page or last edit location on every mode switch. What do you think I'm thinking the 20th time that happens ;-) \nHeres another example: often, unintentionally, i click the mouse on the main pane in boostnote when in preview mode. One reason I might do this, is because, on the web, if i'm reading something, i can highlight the part of text i'm reading with the mouse  to help me concentrate on it. So its muscle memory, and, for me,  it means \"i need to concentrate on this particular line now\".  I think its a fairly common tick, sometimes to click rather than highlight when doing that. But in boost note, the opposite of concentration happens, the cursor jumps to the top of the file / last edit location and i get taken to edit mode. And the way out of edit mode and back to where i wanted to concentrate is not to simply click again: i have to click at the top of the pane then scroll back down to where i was. If there was a one-click way of getting back to where i was, it wouldn't be so much of a problem. thanks @ZeroX-DG! Nice work!. great work and all, sorry to say this is the single app i have on my mac that doesn't have a setting to turn off update notifications and auto-downloads. The latter is regrettable, but its the notification nags that kill me....i use brew and other tools, i update frequently: i want to update when I want to update, not when you want to nag me to update, which distracts me from my work.

After that I sort of realized that something must have been getting a lock on the temp files as soon as the installation process created them in the %APPDATA% folder. It then hit me that my (corporate) machine has an automatic backup of my Users folder. I disabled that and tried installing Boostnote again. This time it worked just fine.\ntl;dr: I had an automatic backup software that was potentially locking the temp files during installation causing the failure. Temporarily disabling the backup software allowed me to install Boostnote without issues.. @emanuelstanciu yep it was CrashPlan for me, that I had to disable until the installation completed. Glad it worked for you as well. I think a long term fix for this would be to allow the user to pick an installation path. I don't know enough about Squirrel.Windows to comment on that but if that is possible, that would be good.. This is perhaps still the same problem as #447.. @Nexxado do you have any other backup software or perhaps an anti-virus software that might be interfering with the installation?. @Nexxado well, I am out of things for you to try. The problem is with the update manager, which Boostnote uses, called Squirrel.Windows. I would search their issues or perhaps try posting this issue there about issues with updating Squirrel based apps on Windows 10.\nAlso, do you recognize the users in the folder paths of the errors?

How to reproduce this bug:\n(note the distinction between the ; key and the : key)\nhold down shift + ; and then release shift before releasing ; then try hitting ctrl. You will get asterisks. (ctrl + :) is the shortcut for surrounding words with asterisks (bolding).\nThis happens because of how Boostnote detect multiple keys. When you hold down shift + ;, shift and : are registered as being \"down\" but then if you release shift first before releasing ;, then Boostnote will only detect that shift and ; are released (instead of :, because : is shift + ;), but internally the : key is still registered as being held down even though it has already been released. For : to be detected as released, both shift and ; have to be released at the same time or ; before shift.\nSo if  you hit ctrl after, you get asterisks, which is ctrl + :\nThis is a tough one to explain but here's the internal key states when this bug occurs:\n\n\nhold down shift + ;\nkeys that are down: {Shift: true, :: true}\n\n\nrelease shift:\nkeys that are down: {Shift: false, :: true}\n\n\nrelease ; :\n(by now both keys are up)\nkeys that are down: {Shift: false, :: true} (because ; is detected as released, NOT :)\n\n\nhit ctrl now:\nkeys that are down: {Shift: false, :: true, Control: true}\nHence you get asterisks.\n\n\nThis isn't really limited to shift + ;, it could happen to any characters that require holding down shift.\nI'll look for a way to fix it in the mean time.. please refer to #540 \nIf key codes are used, that bug will not occur when user try to input something that combines the shift key because for example in key codes, the key : is handled as shift + ; (16, 186) instead of being treated as :. So when user releases shift before ;, both key codes are removed from keyPressed properly. \nWhile previously when Strings are used, shift + ; is pushed into keyPressed as {Shift: true, :: true} so when user releases shift before releasing ;, then shift and ; would become false in keyPressed but : would remain true, resulting the bug in #540 \nStrings are definitely more readable, I would prefer strings too if you could find another solution to the bug in #540 \nedit: keyPressed should become {Shift: true, :: true} instead of {Shift: true, ;: true, :: true}. I don't use it personally but I think it doesn't hurt to have a few keyboard shortcuts in the program. Some people might use them, you never know :)\nI would rather the shortcut be ctrl + b for bold though, don't even need to hit shift then.. By the way, is it really caused by the difference between US and JP keyboards?\nI believe it is caused by the shift key being released early causing keyPressed to have incorrect values.\n\nhit shift + ; will result in {Shift: true, ::true}\nrelease shift first while still holding ; will result in {Shift: false, ::true, ;:true}\nrelease ; now will result in {Shift: false, ::true, ;:false}\n: remains true in keyPressed even though all keys are now released, which causes the bug. Oh ok, good to know :). \n",

This is similar to storing the meta-data of the book/collection of notes.\nI suppose the tension is what, if any, meta-data is related to the organisation of notes vs the note itself. ie maybe we still need to have meta-data stored in the head of a note?\nNote Gitbook has a second file book.json for enabling plugins/additional functionality associated with that book. eg youtube viewer.\neg. This is the RootSystems (the dev owned company i work with) handbook: https://github.com/enspiral-root-systems/meta. @SMontgomery thanks for mentioning typora - it looks rad! I\u2019m downloading it now. Are there any features you wish it had that BoostNote does?\nLike you this issue is the make or brake for me so I stopped using BoostNote a while ago and was just following this issue waiting for a solution.\nIf this were stackoverflow I\u2019d vote for this to be the solution to this issue. . Maybe - it would be implementation dependent.\nIdeally, it would do both - but I have a suspicion its an either or. Which would probably make it a non-core feature.. For me this is out of scope for what boostnote does. Currently I have a private bitbucket repo my notes are saved in and after I finish editing a Note I git commit it. This is nice as I also get some content versioning as well. This is also why the current naming of the files and non JSON shape is annoying. Ie I need to look at the content to work out which file it is. Anyway other that's another issue...\nI think it is more important to develop the message protocol of a note so that it can be used with a variety of systems. Eg pouch, secure scuttle butt/dat decentralised db, git, Dropbox, etc these can all then be extensions/services. ",

I believe this will also work with YAML as well.\n\nUsing an external JSON file to hold metadata is an OK workaround, but I'd suggest storing metadata related to the file in the individual file itself as YAML frontmatter (or MMD), and album and editor-specific metadata in the external JSON file.  This would keep the formatted notes independent of the editor, and allow you to edit them in any markdown editor if you need to.\n. ",

Atm i'm thinking about putting the description in the front matter and all snippet \"files\" in the markdown content, separated by lines (--- tags). A heading could be used as file name and a code-block tag with language tag for the file content. This way the snippet notes could easily be rendered by any markdown editor, too. \n```\ntype: 'snippet'\ntitle: 'snippet title'\ndescription: 'snippet note description'\ntags: [ ]\n\nFirst file\n```javascript\nlet someJSFunction (arg1, arg2) {\n    ...\n}\n``\n\nSecond file\n`html\n<body>some html here</body>\n```.

This appears to make the text editor repaint itself and work out where the cursor should be is.\nI imagine a programmatical fix for this would lie somewhere in that - somehow invalidate the state of the CodeMirror editor when the internal UI changes size (even if the window doesn't) the same as you presumably do when the window itself is resized.. This appears to be fixed for me now.

I'll also gladly help but I'm afraid my front-end development experience is limited.\nAnyway, before too much work is put into the folder hierarchy idea, I would like to suggest going back to the original idea proposed in this issue: having the notes themselves arranged in a parent/child hierarchy. I find this approach more flexible when you use the hierarchy for topics and subtopics - you often want to add some general information about a topic that is not specific to one of the subtopics. And of course, you can still imitate a folder by using an empty note as parent for the notes you want to group together. This model is similar to how OneNote works and it also would allow Boostnote to more naturally replace popular hierarchical note taking programs such as Workflowy and Dynalist.\nFrom a UI standpoint there are several ways we could show this kind of hierarchy, and I'm not sure which would be the best. I think the simplest option would be to have the notes list as a collapseable tree (possibly as a third mode in addition to the flat default and compressed views), but it would also be possible to put the parent notes in the folder list like in louiealmeda's implementation..

    "nadr0": "eslint is now passing but for some reason a linux test case is now failing when it didn't before. . I don't think the rebase ended up working? . my git skills aren't up to par :sweat:. Thanks for all the help @kazup01 , @asmsuechan! I look forward to working on new features with you in the future!. I had to give them Ids because they don't have any other classes on them. err, you still have to leave the fa in the front.. haha totally tunnel visioned what you said and didn't realize you mean take off the {}. gotcha, I ended up having to wrap the show/hide code inside the callback of the setState. It wasn't being updated properly so I read the react docs and found \" React does not guarantee that the state changes are applied immediately.\". . Yeah I was concerned about that from the start. I ended up moving the logic/event into browser/main/Main.js like you suggested. I just have emit's inside the MarkdownNoteDetail and the snippet file. I tried to follow the code from the PR you recommend.\nAlso, thanks for all the help!. What were you thinking it would look like? \nAlso I am switching the code to use the electron clipboard but when pressing the button in the preview mode, the handlePreviewMouseUp changes the view to CODE state so it doesn't stay in the PREVIEW state. It is hard to put a button inside the markdown preview because the onclick eats everything. I need to figure out some way that you can click on things inside the preview state without changing to the code state. . sliderRight and sliderLeft are important because if you are in the editor mode, the slider bars to move the lists appear through the editor. You would be able to drag those sliders which is not good. I need to turn those off or display none them while you are in fullscreen. \nI do like how you separated the code into 3 functions. I do not like the name leftLists, it is not descriptive. I do not quite know what to call them. If they have different names we should use them? I just called them lists because I don't know what else to call them. . If you scan your mouse left to right very slowly in the edit mode. You should be able to find the vertical sliders that allow you to move the lists left and right. That is if you turned off the slider code, so that is why I did display: none. \n\nI think those names are better, columns make more sense. . Are you saying edit the CSS files or do it dynamically in the javascript? I can do this tomorrow. . ",

    "nagledb": "I just tested with 0.11.10 and could not reproduce. Maybe it got fixed somewhere along the way?. A robust plugin system would be fantastic. A lot of requested features and a lot of existing features would honestly be better off as plugins.. This was bugging me today so I spent some time investigating. It looks like syncing is not content-aware. Instead, it simply syncs up the two windows based on where you are in terms of pixel distance in the rendered version of the scrolled window.\nSo for example, let's say your markdown window's content has a total rendered height of 10,000 pixels and your preview window's content has a total rendered height of 12,000 pixels. You scroll your markdown window so that the top of the window is at pixel height 2,500. That means the top of your markdown window is now 0.25 (25%) of the way through the document. The rendered window then gets scrolled so that its top is also at 0.25 (pixel height 3,000).\nThis doesn't necessarily work well because the rendered height of a given markdown element can vary considerably. Some examples: Some lines of markdown don't get rendered at all. Headings are much taller than paragraph text. Word-wrapping can cause the number of lines to change.\nAs a real-world example for how bad that can be: I'm currently editing a markdown document that has 418 lines of content. I scrolled my markdown pane so that lines 271 to 297 were in view; the preview window showed me the content for lines 334 to 351. Those ranges don't even overlap.\nA better solution might be to sync the windows based on the content. For example, look at the line number for what's at the top and then scroll the other window so that the same line number is at the top. I spent a bit of time trying to implement that today but couldn't get it to work right.. Further oddity: the backslashes go back to their original form if you close and reopen Boostnote without editing the note.\nSteps:\n1. Create a note with content containing slashes, such as example / and \\\\.\n2. Clone the note.\n3. View cloned note and observe that the slashes have modified (to example / and // in my case, on Mac OS X).\n4. Quit Boostnote without modifying the note.\n5. Reopen Boostnote.\n6. View the cloned note and observe that the now matches the original note (i.e., example / and \\\\).\nHowever if you modify the cloned note before quitting Boostnote (between steps 3 and 4), the slashed get fixed in their modified state.. It looks like it's possible to hook into Chromium's built-in print-to-pdf capabilities via WebContents.printToPDF, which should preserve the links. I wasn't able to figure out how to get a WebContents instance from this.refs.root.contentWindow though.. Browsing the source code, it looks like note filenames use Version 4 UUIDs. So my best guess is that you could use the built-in uuid.uuid4 to generate filenames.. Using Boostnote 0.11.10 on Mac OS X 10.13.6, I actually see the inverse behavior: backslashes become front slashes.\nThis:\n```md\nNote test\nThis is a note. It has some / and some \\.\n```\nwhen cloned, becomes this:\n```md\nNote test\nThis is a note. It has some / and some //.\n```. Actually this is a duplicate of #2310. Maybe also have it run the tests?. The fact that there isn't already a markdown-it plugin for this suggests that it's not something widely wanted. I'm skeptical of adding a completely new and unique markdown syntax for a very niche edge case.\nPutting that aside, I'd suggest making your own markdown-it plugin for it and then having Boostnote use the plugin, rather than embedding the whole thing into Boostnote. That way whatever syntax it ends up with has a chance to catch on outside of just Boostnote.\nRegarding the Markdown syntax:\n- I don't find the syntax intuitive.\n- I think that the summary line should be marked differently from the content.\n- There should be a way to denote whether it starts in the open or closed state.\nRegarding the Rendered content:\n- I really don't like the eyeball icon.\n- The default styling that you get if you just use <details> and <summary> directly looks good enough to me. I don't see any need to change it.. Please use the default styling for <summary> and <details> rather than the custom eyeball thing. The default styling is more consistent with what's used elsewhere and looks more professional.\nEnd users can always customize their CSS to add the eyeballs if they want.. Are you using a custom font? Some fonts have ligatures, I wonder if that's what you're seeing. You can test by selecting the \u2199 and copying to your clipboard, then pasting into something like notepad to see if it shows up as </ or \u2199.. I'd also like such an option. It'd also be great if it were accessible in the editor directly rather than in the preferences dialog. Maybe as a toolbar button or an (optional?) key-binding? That way we can easily switch back and forth based on what we're currently doing.. I'd especially like the ability to specify which delimiters to enable/disable.\nA good example is $. I use that symbol a lot, but never as a paired delimiter. Sometimes I like having quotes and parens paired, but I never want $ paired.. I updated the PR: Added preferences to support toggling front matter title extraction on/off and to customize what field is used for the title.. Rebased against current head (without any changes).\nTested to verify that it also fixes #2514. I'm on macOS 10.13.6 with Boostnote 0.11.10 and do not see this behavior. Maybe it's specific to macOS 10.14.. Possibly related to #2463? Maybe see if this workaround works for you.. Similar discussion at #2475. That behavior is explicitly part of the CommonMark Spec:\n\nA link destination consists of either a sequence of zero or more characters between an opening < and a closing > that contains no spaces, line breaks, or unescaped < or > characters, or [...]\n\nThis is necessary because you can optionally include a title for the link, like so: [example](http://example.org \"This is a test\"). Which renders as: example. (Hover over it for the title.)\nMaking spaces in links work correctly would thus be non-trivial. There was CommonMark Spec discussion about this in 2017 but it apparently didn't go anywhere.\nRather than changing the behavior here, I would suggest convincing someone upstream to change it -- either at markdown-it or at CommonMark.\nAs a workaround, try escaping your spaces: [example](file\\ with\\ spaces.md). This is non-standard and doesn't work on GitHub's markdown, but it worked in BoostNote when I tried it.. Actually I was wrong on one point: It looks like this will be changed in the next release of the CommonMark spec. Per here, link destinations have the option to contain:\n\na sequence of zero or more characters between an opening < and a closing > that contains no line breaks or unescaped < or > characters\n\nIn other words, like so: [example](<link with spaces.md>).\nSince markdown-it is 100% compliant with CommonMark, I imagine they'll adopt that when the next spec revision is released (no idea when that would be). If Boostnote does decide to change the behavior here, at least that would be a forward-compatible way to do it.. Good idea on the hotkey. I'll see if I can figure how to to do that later.. I did some work on adding a hotkey but couldn't get it to work. I may revisit later but I currently don't plan to update this PR further.. Thanks for the feedback. I'll start working on a PR to break up CodeEditor and to update the other 3 places to use it.. Hmm, I think that change would definitely make sense but I'm not sure where to add it. It doesn't look like any of the other fields do any kind of validation/cleanup currently either. For example, I can change \"Editor Font Size\" to \"12a\" and I can change \"LaTeX Inline Open Delimiter\" to \"  $  \" (two leading and two trailing spaces).\nI also don't see that there's any existing test infrastructure for the UI tab or for the underlying ConfigManager.\nMaybe that kind of stuff should all be done as a separate set of changes?.

    "vilmes21": "So @huettenhain , you meant it once had it, but no longer does now. Correct? I have Boostnote on Windows and Mac, neither has search text function.

I saw this new feature on MacOs, awesome job! However, on my Windows machine, there's no such feature yet. By the way, where should I report some bugs for the newest release? I'm no longer able to save my UI preference settings once I quit the program. In fact, it's even hard to save my UI preferences when I collapse the left-hand sidebar..

    "lewisdiamond": "I don't think Boostnote should ever store users notes as it may contain personal information.\nI vote against using PouchDB or CouchDB for storage. There are already very good synching tools that could be used with Boostnote (I use Syncthing).\nI suggest using plain files, organized in directories with names matching what's set up by the user in the UI.\ni.e.: If I have a folder called \"Notes\", with notes \"My Note\" and \"Some Other Note\", I'd expect the following:\n/home/myhome/MyBoostnoteDirectory/Notes/{\"My Note\", \"Some Other Note\"}\nOf course, this may result in conflicts if you allow notes to have the same name. The easy solution is to append the first few characters of the note's UUID, e.g. \"My Note-abcdef\", \"Some Other Note-012345\", \"My Note-67890a\".\nThis makes it very easy to sync, view and edit notes, even without having Boostnote installed.. ",
    "vvs": "Here's what I figured so far. If the note is not locked, as soon as I pick up any image in the Windows Explorer, the Boostnote goes out of focus, and the currently edited note gets into \"view mode\". Dragging the image into this note does nothing.\nIf I lock the edit mode, then dragging the image does work in a sense that the image is copied into my storage's images files, and some text is appended to the note. But the image is still not visible.\nHere's what is being appended:\n![Anomalies.png](P:%5CMy%20Docs%5CBoostNotes/images/Anomalies.png)\nPlease note that my storage location is: P:\\My Docs\\BoostNotes\n. It looks like the URL inserted is wrong. If I replace '%5C' with slash, then the image is OK. :)\nBut what I really wanted is a local, relative path, relative to the 'STORAGE/images'. So, in my case, the ideal case would be:\n![Anomalies.png](Anomalies.png). Is this really desired behavior when the .boostnoterc settings always override the user settings set in the UI?\nSo, a user modifies something in the UI, everything works as he/she likes, then he/she restarts the app, and the settings is gone, replaced by the one from the .boostnote file.\nOr is this .boostnoterc file not really designed to be used by users, and only be used to fix/reset some of the user settings (for example, to be able to reset the settings if they gone bad for some reason)?. Same here, my preferences are gone, and are being reset after each restart.. I am on Windows 10. Creating the .boostnoterc file did not help, including the fix with removing comma.\nI am also seeing some network activity when trying to monitor the Boostnote behavior (figuring out where it reads/writes).. @asmsuechan It is the standard C:\\users\\vvs. And looking at the procmon, I see that Boostnote accesses the C:\\users\\vvs\\.boostnoterc file, but its content never changes, and all the settings are reset after each restart.. Also, looking at the devtools, I see various errors popping up from time to time, when I open/edit/save the preferences:\n\nloadmode.js:61 Uncaught TypeError: instance.getOption is not a function\nmain.js:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'className' of null. @asmsuechan Ok, figured this stuff out. Basically, the .boostnoterc is READ-ONLY, so it never changes when I modify preferences in the app. The problem I had that the referenced Menlo and Lato fonts were not found. Once I removed them and replaced by \"Roboto\" that exists on my system, the app reads the rc file and adjusts the settings accordingly.\n\nSo, at the moment, I can configure BoostNote to what I need, but not via the app, but rather via the direct file editing.\nAlso, I had to figure out how to disable the analytics (by default, the setting is enabled), and the setting for that is:\n\"amaEnabled\": false. @asmsuechan When the app is able to save the .boostnoterc, then yes. But currently, it is a one-way road for me, settings are being read from the file, but never written to it.. The following patch fixes the problem of inability to save the user configuration for me:\n```\ndiff --git a/browser/main/lib/ConfigManager.js b/browser/main/lib/ConfigManager.js\nindex 505e7ab..59e2c4d 100644\n--- a/browser/main/lib/ConfigManager.js\n+++ b/browser/main/lib/ConfigManager.js\n@@ -67,7 +67,7 @@ function get () {\n config = Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_CONFIG, JSON.parse(config))\n\n\nconfig = Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_CONFIG, boostnotercConfig)\n\n// config = Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_CONFIG, boostnotercConfig)\n     config = assignConfigValues(config, boostnotercConfig, config)\nif (!validate(config)) throw new Error('INVALID CONFIG')\n```. Yes please! Any kind of advertisements would be really nice to be able to close/hide. There is no point of showing that annoying button with the link on the bottom of the page forever, it looks ugly and it distracts my attention.. @tatoosh I meant the separate pop-up window with a configurable keyboard shortcut (the window had convenient search on top, active by default). It is gone now, no window and no possibility to configure the shortcut for such a window in preferences.. I was using this feature on Windows 10 x64. Mostly for copy-pasting my most often used data, stored in the same Note.\n\n\nWith different shortcuts, for the main window and for the pop-up window, it was very quick and convenient. When I wanted to open the main app, I press one shortcut, but when I quickly wanted to copy-paste something, and not interfere with the main window and the currently opened Note, I just press another shortcut to get the pop-up window with my data.\nI will be grateful if this pop-up feature is returned in some form and it could be optional. But please, personally, the feature will be needed only if the shortcut for opening the pop-up window is re-introduced as well.\nP.S. As for telemetry, I have it disabled, and I assume many others did the same. ;). ",

The underlying scrollbar is still shown in the beginning, but disappears instantly after I start scrolling.. I mean that after I close Boostnote, Ctrl-f works again on Firefox, Atom, Okular etc.\nSo, I cannot use Ctrl-f to toggle the \"Find\" in any program if at the same time Boostnote is open.

    "TeHMoroS": "Making an ebuild for a .deb package is pretty straight-forward, when installed \"1 to 1\". Looking at Boostnote however I would do some modifications (like adding a \"system-electron\" USE flag to let people decide if they want to use their own Electron installation or the bundled one).\nThat being said, @jolenzy you don't have to have an ebuild to use Boostnote on Gentoo. Just use \"ar\" (a little archiving utility from the binutils ebuild, that is used to create .deb. packages) to extract the .deb file, then extract data.tar.xz file to a directory of your choice and make yourself a .desktop file (the icon is in the package).\nJust be sure to check if you have all the necessary dependencies (\"ldd directory_of_your_choice/usr/share/boostnote/Boostnote\") and emerge them if needed (although if you have Chromium or Electron emerged already, you're good to go). \nMore of a workaround than a solution, but it'll get you started. :).

    "BobTB": "Is this included / released in the latest version? Without full text search the thing is almost useless.. OK, it took me a while ti find it! It is only for searching the currently selected note. A really good search would be a single one, global for the whole app, which would filter the notes containing the searched string and at the same time showing it on the \"edit\" panel highlighted for the currently selected note. Search as you type thing is also good, not that I have to enter the search string and then hit enter for it to show the results. \nCheck out resophnotes ( http://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html ), a 7 years old app, it has all of this and works just beautifully, this is how the search functionality should be implemented.. Oh,... this note taking app also does not have this.... I had so high hopes for this. It is very hard to use if search result is not highlighted in the text.. Ok, now I know exactly what is wrong. It does not search code snippets, which is quite a problem, how am I supposed to find something in the notes if it is in the snippet?. Ok, I know there is Finder, but how can I find the note which has the string in snippet I am looking for in the first place? I have to click through all and every note and then search for the string in finder? There should be a global scope search box and not two searches with different scopes. This is almost useless for me, and I believe for many other users too. Fix that and Boostnote will have a lot more users :). Actually there are three ways to search:\n-a regular search box\n-a 'finder' search \n-and a Search box in Editor mode\nAll three should be combined in just one search box!\n. Check out simplenote, one search finds everything, simple and great, of course its lacking in other functionality, as far as I was able to look boostnote is as close to perfect as it can be, just if the search was more usefull / intuitve,. I really tried now for three days, but this search functionality as now is not useful at all, it is a hinderance instead of help. I have a specific text in a code snippet. I just can not find the note in which this snippet with the text is. I can not find a way of doing it. Sadly I have to use something else, these three different ways of searching for the same thing is really a major setback. . Exactly my thoughts! It very hard to use as it is now.. ",

It will also download and upload the files from the cloud storage faster this way. I would like to see this feature in boostnote :). Im using Win 10 Professional Edition, and i get the same \"display bug\".. Does Squirell or the used packager even generate a uninstall.exe?.

Hi @asmsuechan,\nRunning it via yarn run dev-start works fine provided you have node, npm, yarn, etc. installed on the Mac you're trying to use it on.\nHowever, I'm also trying to run it on some Macs that don't have node, npm, yarn etc. so unfortunately have to compile it for them.. @asmsuechan my understanding of what they were saying, is that they want the option to change the default font color in code blocks for the text.\ne.g. When using the 'Light' UI theme, they want to be able to change the code block text from the pink to a colour of their choice.\nSo basically adding a setting to change this color code for the Markdown Preview:\ncode {\n    color: #CC305F;\n}\nDefault Syntax Highlighting with Light theme uses Pink text:\n\nSo say there was a setting to change code block default text to Black, it'd then look like this:\n\n. +1 for encryption, that'd be a really nice feature.\nI mainly use Boostnote for taking notes at work and wouldn't want to have any of my notes stored on an external storage platform without them being encrypted first, as some of the information is confidential.. Great job \ud83d\udc4d. I agree, in my opinion there should be a way to remove the bar - preferably either via the app settings or perhaps a configuration option in ~/.boostnoterc\nI've actually just gone back to the previous version of the app (and disabled the app from connecting to Github to check for updates via my firewall) because I don't like the bar. I've already downloaded the Mobile App, I don't need the bar taking up my screen space.. Based on what @kenthannigan provided, here's a more complete set of replacements that should put everything (as far as I can tell) back to how it looked previously.\nIf you don't want to do the find/replace yourself (instructions below), you can download a main.js with these changes applied for Boostnote 0.8.15 only from this gist.\nIf I missed anything, let me know and I'll update this.\n\n\n\nManual Find/Replace instructions for main.js:\nFind:\n.MarkdownNoteDetail__body___browser-main-Detail-{position:absolute;left:0;right:0;left:25px;right:25px;top:87px;bottom:36px}\nReplace With:\n.MarkdownNoteDetail__body___browser-main-Detail-{position:absolute;left:0;right:0;left:25px;right:25px;top:87px;bottom:24px}\nFind:\n.StatusBar__root___browser-main-StatusBar-{position:absolute;bottom:0;left:0;right:0;height:36px;bottom:16px;\nReplace With:\n.StatusBar__root___browser-main-StatusBar-{position:absolute;bottom:0;left:0;right:0;height:24px;bottom:0px;\nFind:\n.RealtimeNotification__notification-area___browser-components-{z-index:1000;font-size:12px;position:absolute;bottom:0;background-color:#ebebeb;width:100vw;height:30px;text-align:center}\nReplace With:\n.RealtimeNotification__notification-area___browser-components-{z-index:1000;display:none;font-size:12px;position:absolute;bottom:0;background-color:#ebebeb;width:100vw;height:0;text-align:center}\nFind:\n.NoteList__root___browser-main-NoteList-{position:absolute;left:0;bottom:0;bottom:30px;top:59px;background-color:#f3f3f3}\nReplace With:\n.NoteList__root___browser-main-NoteList-{position:absolute;left:0;bottom:0;top:59px;background-color:#f3f3f3}\nFind:\n.SnippetNoteDetail__body___browser-main-Detail-{position:absolute;left:0;right:0;left:25px;right:25px;top:87px;bottom:36px;background-color:#f4f4f4}\nReplace With:\n.SnippetNoteDetail__body___browser-main-Detail-{position:absolute;left:0;right:0;left:25px;right:25px;top:87px;bottom:24px;background-color:#f4f4f4}\nFind:\n.SnippetNoteDetail__override___browser-main-Detail-{position:absolute;bottom:0;left:0;bottom:30px;left:60px;height:23px;z-index:101}\nReplace With:\n.SnippetNoteDetail__override___browser-main-Detail-{position:absolute;bottom:0;left:0;left:60px;height:23px;z-index:101}. @urda unfortunately I'm super busy for the next few weeks, I'll have a look into if there are any changes needed to remove the bar using CSS on the updated version of Boostnote when I get a few minutes, but anything more than that is unlikely to happen any time soon.. Nice idea \ud83d\udc4d and if the colours were user configurable, if someone didn't like the change they could just set both checked and unchecked to use the same colour.. @kazup01 I like the design change, but if you do it I think the corners of the app should be rounded so that they match other mac apps (and the bottom).. @asmsuechan It looks like that issue has been caused by this change: https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/899\nWith the default Boostnote configuration (dracula code block theme), text is no longer visible in code blocks after that commit.\n\nWith solarized code block theme it's fine.. Fixed #1244 . This issue was introduced back in 0.8.16 (#1048) but was never fixed/commented on.\nAnother workaround is to only specify a single font which is what I had to resort to, e.g. in my case just putting: SF Mono. To add to this, if you're not using the split-screen editing mode, the website takes over the entire note view (screenshot 1), it also causes an additional issue - the styles from that website stay applied even if you switch to different note (screenshot 2).\n\n\n. There is already an option to disable this, under Preferences -> Interface it's just not something you're likely to notice (due to the way it's phrased) unless you look twice.\nUntick the \"Bring in web page title when pasting URL on editor\" checkbox, then click Save.\n\n.

    "pfftdammitchris": "Nice!\nSent from my Samsung SM-G900T using FastHub. Yeah this actually sounds like a great idea. I'd like to make a pull request for this soon. Do you know if this happens only after syncing between two computers?. Yes please do because I am a little curious as well. I recall this happening to me when I manually dragged .cson notes (that was created from a different boostnote app folder) into the notes folder, and it began bugging. I want to look into this issue and find out how it is syncing so I can try to help find a better solution to make it less buggy (Internally though boostnote uses a local storage which saves data in a json file if I am understanding this correctly, so these \"outside\" .cson notes are not being picked up by boostnote's startup scripts unless the local storage data file is mutated as well)\nIf I am correct then I have an idea and will look into this this week to find better solutions and try to make a pull request. I'm working on this now. Pull request will be ready today. Sorry I think I misunderstood the post a little bit, but I think I know what you are trying to tell now.\nI have a solution and idea for this, i can proceed it to #1556 and show an approach. I think coloring the icon is a good elegant approach in the storage view.\nColoring the title of the note could be good too but I think if we do that then the icon next to it becomes redundant. What do you think?\nI feel like it would be good to just add a folder label in storage view on each note, like what I did to the All Notes view at #1556 (when I added the storage labels on each note) and then color the font (maybe reduce opacity by 0.3 or something as well to make it less vibrant in the storage view)\nIf you like this idea maybe I can try this out soon and see how it goes. I like the feature request so far overall and it would be a great honor to help implement this. I cant reproduce this issue. How does this occur?. Could get some help as well. Damn on second thought I think it would be a lot more nicer if only the storage's text is colored in the side navigation.... maybe the background is a little too much?\nI'm undecisive on a lot of things and i'm not sure if I am breaking any boostnote code guidelines in regards to the architecture. Someone review and let me know if I am on the right direction and it is ok to proceed\nIf this goes well then I will most likely become an active contributor for boostnote since I love the app and it is my first project I went crazy with!. Going to work on this again in a little bit.\nFor the mean time, could I get some opinions on my contribution so far?\nI'm not sure if I'm wasting my time or if I should stop now (If people disagree and do not like what I am doing, I prefer to be told so so that I can go on ahead and think of other ideas and approaches. I am perfectly fine with anyones opinion). . I haven't done that but I agree, I thought it was just me that it looked like that. I'll try it and update the post with the new looks :)\nBy the way for the \"All Notes\" view, I have a huge hunch to put a storage icon next to the colored storage labels in the nav list, like the side nav has for the folders. What would everyone think of that? Would an extra icon might be redundant to the eye? It's also a little hard to decide on a \"storage icon\" maybe the closest relative icon I can find is the fas fa-hdd one. Im probably just going to scratch this and do small pull requests at a time\nI'll re-code this .

Will work on this feature if no one takes it. @Rokt33r needs close. If no one works on this i'd like to implement this one soon. ## Updated:\nWhen in \"All notes\" view, note items will display their storage names\nWhen viewing a storage (Clicking on a storage header in the side nav), note items will display their folders\nNote items do not display any folder/storage when clicking on any individual notes in the side nav (because it is redundant)\n@nlopin How about this? \n\n. @Rokt33r thanks :) hearing that definitely motivates me to provide more help to the project since I feel assured that I am going in the right directions!\n@nlopin I haven't tested that yet but that will most likely have to be a concern. I was thinking, maybe, to truncate at a certain length (maybe 12-15?) while concat-ing with three dots (...) when over the length, allowing the user to hover over it to display a small popup of the full length on top of it? Something simple like that\nAlso, I'm thinking to probably provide the user the option in the preferences to show the colors of the folders when viewing the storage only. I think that is better than the gray dull coloring (whereas it is ok for viewing \"all notes\") \nWhat do you guys think?\nIf all goes well, that might be completing this pull request finally unless there are other things I should do. Got that in. \nWe're probably going to have to use the title attribute for now until there is a better solution. Tried using the stylus tooltip approach used elsewhere in the boostnote app but its very hard to make a smooth implementation inbetween because it conflicts with the note item UI. (Will probably come back to this using portals in the future)\nOk, I think the pull request should be complete now. I was deciding whether to continue progressing the color ideas but I can make a separate pull request for that. This pull request is pretty important IMO so we should get this into the next version first\n\n. Close #1555 . ### edit: It seems like null == undefined in non-strict mode so this post might now be irrelevant. But we should still consider to write in strict mode IMO. I will continue to try to find the bugs in the tests\nI'm looking at the test files and some of them are checking only for \"null\" types when they create mock storage . This seems to be creating a lot of \"undefined\" values if we aren't checking for other falsy values (the tests seem to be failing due to undefined types)\nThe reorderFolder-test is failing checks, showing that prop \"key\" cannot be read from \"undefined\".\nWhen I checked back, the createFolder-test created the beginning storage with TestDummy.dummyStorage(storagePath)\nWhen we look at TestDummy.dummyStorage function, there is a second argument which defaults to an empty object. This looks fine so far but look what happens in the function:\n```javascript\nfunction dummyStorage (storagePath, override = {}) {\n  var jsonData = override.json != null\n    ? override.json\n    : dummyBoostnoteJSONData()\n  var cacheData = override.cache != null\n    ? override.cache\n    : {}\n  if (cacheData.key == null) cacheData.key = keygen()\n  if (cacheData.name == null) cacheData.name = faker.random.word()\n  if (cacheData.type == null) cacheData.type = 'FILESYSTEM'\n  cacheData.path = storagePath\nsander.writeFileSync(path.join(storagePath, 'boostnote.json'), JSON.stringify(jsonData))\n  var notesData = []\n  var noteCount = Math.floor((Math.random() * 15)) + 1\n  for (var i = 0; i < noteCount; i++) {\n    var key = keygen()\n    while (notesData.some((note) => note.key === key)) {\n      key = keygen()\n    }\nvar noteData = dummyNote({\n  key,\n  folder: jsonData.folders[Math.floor(Math.random() * jsonData.folders.length)].key\n})\n\nnotesData.push(noteData)\n\n}\n  notesData.forEach(function saveNoteCSON (note) {\n    CSON.writeFileSync(path.join(storagePath, 'notes', note.key + '.cson'), _.omit(note, ['key']))\n  })\nreturn {\n    json: jsonData,\n    cache: cacheData,\n    notes: notesData\n  }\n}\n```\nWhen cacheData is being declared, override.cache can be undefined (since we just defaulted to an empty object) but still passes the null check and is assigned undefined when its supposed to fallback to an empty object\njavascript\nvar cacheData = override.cache != null\n    ? override.cache\n    : {}\nIn the end the dummyStorage returns an object with prop \"cache\" which is now undefined, when we go back to reorderFolder.test it seems to fail at this line const storageKey = t.context.storage.cache.key\nWhich seems to be something like this:\n\nIf these incomplete checks are what makes the test fail, shouldn't we test for all falsy values including undefined? (And probably use a === check instead of == to be safe). This will definitely strengthen the app and introduce tons of new ideas/features for Boostnote! I am excited to see this. I found that adding an overflow: hidden would help the overlapping of the note list part.\nHowever the real problem is that the toggle mode button isn't even responding correctly to any resizing events. \nIt seems that the absolute positioning of the togglemode button isn't benefiting from the display flex mechanisms of the top bar\nThe answer might be found at: https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#abspos-items\nCouldnt think of a solution yet. Actually I figured a solution. Will submit a pull request. Great,  thanks for the answers! . Looks great, I like it. What about vertical lines to separate each note?. Probably not, it is a great idea and I recently thought of this as well. I would like to implement this and submit a pull request--it is similar to a feature I am working on in my personal project and Boostnote uses the same packages so I'd like to figure the solution for Boostnote and hopefully it will get accepted/integrated! (Will work on this and my other pull request in the weekend starting  this Friday). I'll have this pull request ready in about thirty minutes. Working on windows for me. Seems like a macOS issue. Hmm. That was actually noted down in my to-do notes for this feature! A note can be linked to one evernote note, a folder can be linked to an evernote notebook/category, and a storage can be linked to an evernote notebook. The boostnote note to evernote note will be my first concern and should be the main target feature as far as my concerns are. It is definitely possible to code that.\nSeeing as how the notes are stored in boostnote, syncing a batch of notes with the evernote api needs some thinking though. I'm going to work on this atm and find solutions. But first, I must map this plan out, take notes, draw charts, etc and how I am going to design this :D will submit a pull request and hopefully will get accepted.\nI am a huge evernote fan so I will run the extra 20 miles to implement this. I can see where you are coming from.\nThe thing is I'm trying to think of a solution for someone who is trying to take notes for their coding career in one app but still keep their personal notes next to them somehow without leaving the boostnote app\nThe way it is now for someone like me who takes a lot of personal notes down (writing down on what time I planned to go grocery shopping, etc) who decides to code notes, this is what happens every day:\n-Open up boostnote, start coding\n-Open up evernote, leave it opened for that one (or 2 or 3) important notes that I need to have readily-available next to me just in case something personal pops up\nIf the user is able to keep their personal notes next to them without leaving the boostnote app (which is where my small idea of an evernote integration comes in), they can quickly glance/edit their personal notes and go straight back to coding in boostnote)\nJust opening up evernote and minimizing it is a solution but now you have a separate app to put beside you\nMy main goal is to integrate a one to one sync of a note, not syncing a user's entire evernote notes that they stored into their account over there (syncing their entire notes from evernote might be too much to build into boostnote) - syncing evernote notes to a boostnote folder/storage was just an idea that sounded cool but syncing one boostnote to one evernote note is my main proposition and a really cool sounding feature\n. Trust me the feature I want to build will not be a big deal. It will probably just be a simple icon on top of a note item where a user can click and provide details to sync that into their evernote note\nIf you have an evernote note to look after or put beside you and you want to stay in the boostnote app, you can choose to sync it with a boostnote note\n. That is great :) . I will submit a pull request after work for this if no one takes it\nI should be able to fit this one on my time schedule for my weekday. That is good information! Definitely can be solved with a better way.\nI'm at work right now and will provide a solution/fix within the next 2 days if there isn't a pull request yet. Thank you :) . Draft.js is a great editor for this. I had spent a great time with it in the past and there is a high learning curve with it so it is a high risk and may take weeks/months to implement correctly to a production-ready boostnote integration if going further than implementing the basics (bold, italic, etc). But once you get the hang of it it becomes a really really powerful editor. I had to read through the official docs over 30 times and there is understandably lack of documentation and tutorials out there for this editor. . ",

Any ideas what can we do here? \n. @Rokt33r thanks for your response. \nLooks like you didn't catch the issue in the first question. The question is not about where should we put styles.

I'm working on it right now.. @Rokt33r @kazup01 I've finished. \nExport is divided by two parts:\n1. export additional files and paths modifications\n2. export the content of the note\nAdditional files are exported via copy tasks. Task is an object {'src': pathfrom, 'dst': pathto}. Destination path can be relative or absolute. \nIf all additional files are exported, the content will be exported at the end. If an error happened during export, boostnote remove all already exported files and folders.\nFeel free to ask questions here or at Slack.. @tatoosh yes. If you export to HTML two additional folders will be exported \u2013 images and css. No, it will export the same styles you see on preview. Create feature request if you need it. @Rokt33r done! Thank you. Could you explain what do you mean? \nThere is no sense in current version of HTML export, because it doesn't work properly. I think it's ok to merge PR because it fixes that issue. . @kazup01 @Rokt33r I'm worried that leaving this PR without merge will lead us to new set of conflicts.. This is the fundamental issue. Some styles applies directly to Preview HTML in rewriteIframe method. It's not a good practice, so I removed that. \nI add class to the li tag at markdown to html transformation and then style it with css. @Rokt33r  Please, have a look.

This pull request is currently on review.. @kazup01 @Rokt33r  we can close the task. #1306 is merged . Do you mean, that if user wants to detach a storage, they need to remove (or move) storage folder from the filesystem? . Sorry, but It doesn't sound good. Why user should bother deleting anything manually?. I am still not getting the idea. Can you provide an example of other software sharing with Boostnote storage folder? For me It looks like very rare scenario of usage and most users don't mix their storages with other apps.. We need to find more elegant solution. The one with icons is too aggressive. Thanks for your contribution! It looks pretty cool so far.\nIn my opinion It's too much color for storage menu item in the left menu. Have you tried to color the font? . Looks great! How does it look if the title of a note is long?. @Rokt33r I can't start with this until PR #1566 isn't merged. Can you look at it?. I'm really looking forward to it. Mardown-it support becomes more and more painful. Do you have a plan how to migrate seamlessly? Boostnote is dependent on markdown-it. Sorry for delay, guys. It's coming. @Rokt33r I've finished this. I had to add manual animation for scroll, because current version of Chrome doesn't have smooth scroll on scrollIntoView function. Feel free to ask any questions.\nI'm not sure what happened with test, I've changed nothing in move folder part of the app.. @Rokt33r @kazup01 Could you please review the code?. @Rokt33r no, let's do that in separate PR. Is it possible to attach this notes? It could be helpful, maybe there is a format issue. Hi @kikyoulin! \nWhat version of the app do you have? Can you show the original content of the note?. You have an image with a link. I'll test it today and fix on weekend. Hi, @shogochiai \nExport to HTML currently exports the same CSS styles Boostnote uses in the preview mode. If you set custom font, it will be in the exported HTML. \n\n\nHTML is portable. If you copy HTML to another computer where there is no such font installed it will use fallback font. Currently, I don't know good way to export font file together with HTML. If you have any idea how to do that, please let me know.. Can you describe your issue? What problem are you trying to solve?. I can do Russian. The snippet in Boostnote is similar to gists at Github. A snippet here is just a bunch of tabs with only code in them. This is the main difference between a note and a snippet \u2013 note can mix markdown with code, snippet is just code organized by tabs. \nIt's not the same as snippets in IDE for now. So, you can't assign a hotkey to a snippet and expect for replacing. If you want to have such snippets you should probably use a special tool, i.e. Alfred for Mac.. Let's try Jest, it's just a matter of choice. I can add it to the project today. > The html export of notes containing images is broken -> no images present\n\nMarkdown export with embed files/images is broken -> links are broke\n\nDo you use the last version? \nAll exports were fixed some time ago. If you do use the last version, please, provide a video and console output after the export.. @Rokt33r put it on me. One big issue I'm thinking about. Jest doesn't work with refs properties, but MarkdownPreview is the wrapper around iframe and we interact with that iframe via refs.. Boostnote exports css folder together with html file, so the path is correct. The font issue is well known, there is no good solution of it.. Could you explain, why do you think it's bad?\nI think it's a reasonable solution. There are a lot of styles in those CSS and you probably don't want to have 40KB of styles in your HTML file.. @Rokt33r What is the core team vision of the product? You have stats and probably it's possible to understand how often people use HTML export. \nIf you want to support one-file HTML export we should:\n inline CSS styles\n has a cloud image storage to include them into the HTML file\nI've check the Notion app and their export process (they export to Markdown only), they load all images into cloud and include links to them.. Can you attach Markdown with local image and HTML made from it via pandoc?. dataUri sounds like reasonable solution. I'll do some research to understand is there any restrictions and how does it work with big images.. Fixed. Have you tested the speed between the current and new version of the function?\nFrom my point of view, 6 replaces is the slower solution than previous. Instead of searching the whole text (which can be big) only once it is done 6 times in a row.. ",

Probably not that straight forward though.\nI think the way it's done on desktop is that instead of having a big open text editing area for the markdown, is that you capture text into floating edit areas, and those areas are what sit on top of the main area. Penning would be done the same way. You enable it and it's captured in a drawing area.

I checked the boostnote.json and the hashes within that file matched the individual CSON note files.\nI then poked around (using Notepad++) the most recent notes to see if there was anything different and I noticed that some of the newest ones were missing data from the top of the file:\nNewest files:\ntype: \"MARKDOWN_NOTE\"\ncontent: '''\nAll of the older files:\ntype: \"MARKDOWN_NOTE\"\nfolder: \"e426e73a60c6f2be2752\"\ntitle: \"Notes\"\ncontent: '''\nThe missing information was put into the footer alongside the creation dates/star status but only for those newer files:\n'''\ntitle: \"Notes 2\"\nfolder: \"f1dc007582502d2f7111\"\ncreatedAt: \"2017-12-20T17:55:53.329Z\"\nupdatedAt: \"2017-12-20T17:55:53.329Z\"\nI simply moved these files out of the folder and then imported the data storage again and it worked.

Looks like copy-as-markdown uses reMarked.js internally, another option besides node-europa for the putative Boostnote plugin.\nScreenshot comparing reMarked.js vs pandoc - reMarked has trouble parsing the code blocks for some reason:\n\nreMarked code blocks fenced with 'true'?\nThis is funny. I couldn't figure out why the reMarked demo was fencing code blocks with 'true'. I think it's just a mistake in how the reMarker object is configured on the demo page:\n```javascript\n// code blocks will be delimited with the string 'true'\nvar reMarker = new reMarked({gfm_code: true});\n// this is what we want\n// try it by pasting into the console at reMarked demo site\nvar reMarker = new reMarked({gfm_code: \"\"});\nreMarker.render(document.getElementById('html-inp').value)\nexample reMarked.js output w/ {gfm_code: \"```\"}:\nThe basics\n----------\n\nTo create an executable Node.js script all you need is a Node.js shebang at the top of the script and then some code to execute.\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\nconsole.log('hello world');\n```\n\nAssuming you are on a UNIX like system you can do this to make the script executable\n\n```\nchmod u+x yourscript\n```\n\nNow you can run it and you should see \u2018hello world\u2019 printed.\n\n```\n./yourscript\nhello world\n```\n\nHandling arguments\n------------------\n\nAs you get beyond basic scripts you\u2019ll want to pass arguments into the script. The arguments passed to a script are available as `process.argv`.\n\nIf you pass arguments to the simple example above and add `console.log(process.argv)` you\u2019ll see the arguments are available as an array. For example if you run\n\nconclusion\nI think reMarked.js - when properly configured - produces better output compared with pandoc, and possibly node-europa.. I've tried the recently released v0.11.10 and also cloned the repo and built the latest master branch, and in both cases I am noticing that mermaid gantt charts seem to be scaling in such that they are rendered at a higher resolution then shrunk to fit my window, or they are too tall.\n\n\nThe mermaid(40h):graph2 height syntax in the latest build worked for me and helps a lot - thanks @daiyam!\n\nQuestion: if we are setting the height of the mermaid svg via 'vh' units AFTER the svg is rendered, perhaps mermaid first renders the graph at the full width of the screen, then scales it down proportional to vh? that might account for what I was seeing in the master build. \n\n\n\nit looks like mermaid gantt charts have an undocumented config option useWidth: <px> - see mermaid/blob/master/src/diagrams/gantt/ganttRenderer.js#L35 source code and try it in the online editor. 1) Mermaid renders the chart at the width specified by this config option if it is provided; 2) otherwise it uses the width of the containing dom element; 3) otherwise it defaults to useWidth=1200.\n\n\nHere is where useWidth is set in gattRenderer.js:\nhttps://github.com/knsv/mermaid/blob/master/src/diagrams/gantt/ganttRenderer.js#L35\n```js\nexport const draw = function (text, id) {\n  parser.yy.clear()\n  parser.parse(text)\nconst elem = document.getElementById(id)\n  w = elem.parentElement.offsetWidth\nif (typeof w === 'undefined') {\n    w = 1200\n  }\nif (typeof conf.useWidth !== 'undefined') {\n    w = conf.useWidth\n  }\n```\nI've been playing around with it by hardcoding useWidth: 800 in Boostnote/browser/components/render/MermaidRender.js#29:\njs\n// line 29\nmermaidAPI.initialize({\n  theme: isDarkTheme ? 'dark' : 'default',\n  themeCSS: isDarkTheme ? darkThemeStyling : '',\n  gantt: { \"useWidth\": 800}\n  // useMaxWidth: false  // <-- I don't think this maps to a valid mermaid config option;\n                         //     should be `sequence: {useMaxWidth: false},`\n                         //     https://github.com/knsv/mermaid/blob/master/src/mermaidAPI.js#L156\n})\n\nIf others want to set a minimum width, maybe the same result could be obtained more cleanly by configuring min-width of the parent element of mermaid's svg in the boostnote theme; it has class .mermaid: <pre class=\"mermaid\">... In theory the mermaid gantt renderer would set width based by picking up the parent element's offsetWidth?\nIf you want to experiment with this useWidth config option, you can try the mermaid live editor:\ndefault theme\n\nconfig.gantt.useWidth:\"600\"\n\n\nfor posterity - this is what the current build (w/o the fixes made earlier in this PR) looks like\n\n.

I've made it so it works with windows now and has the menu bar. I was still testing this on a mac, hence why it has the extra menu options. But it will adapt to all the menus for the specified operating system. Here are a few images, let me know what you guys think.\nSo the mac version looks like this\n\nAnd now the windows version will look like this\n\nYou might want to play with the svg icons for min/max/close and make them suit your style a bit better.

I fixed most of the review comments, except the last one: if I use export default the index.js in the dataApi folder, where this file is required, will fail, because it won't load the correct file. Or do I something wrong?. That's also a good fix, I didn't see it. You can close my PR.. can be closed, is also fixed by #1258. This is how it looks like now:\n\n. I removed the gitignore changes and created a new PR with these changes: #1242. What do you mean by 'share notes on the web'? The feature request was about\nexporting notes to HTML (including images and other references), so what\nwould this export to the web look like? Where on the web would you export\nit?. The cause of this issue is in CodeMirror, not in BoostNote. It happens whenever you have those two brackets next to the bullet point, see this simple Plunkr. I created an issue at CodeMirror for this. Let's see if they will pick it up. . On my Windows 10 laptop is the other way around: only with my changes am I able to open the Finder window. . I've got a couple of clarifying questions:\n\nWhich particular version of LinuxMint 18 did you try to install Boostnote? The latest, 18.2? \nWhich windowmanager do you use (Cinnamon, Xfce, Mate or KDE)? \nHow did you install Boostnote? . I just installed that version in a VM and downloaded and installed Boostnote. It started without any issues.. we could also show a confirmation dialog before deleting notes.. You see the same behavior on every OS: they all remove the files to the trash, but also show a confirmation dialog. . I know that, but we discussed it in #1317, saying that removing file to the trash in the OS also shows a warning, the same as emptying the trash. Now we just show the warning when permanent removing the file from the trash. So you think we should not implement this?\n\nJust a general question: Who is the product owner of Boostnote and decides which feature requests are going to be implemented?. sorry for the delay, I haven't been working for some time, because of the holidays.. It would also be great to be able to copy the selected text/image/code snippet directly to a new note in Boostnote. When selecting a code snippet, it would be nice that Boostnote creates a new snippet instead of a markdown note.. this has already been implemented with issue #1062 in Boostnote 0.8.17 with PlantUML. @sosukesuzuki can we include an official version number in the notifications.json, so the comparison will be much easier. Now it's just a random string which may or may not include the version number (in whatever form). I suggest to add a version property in the same format as electron.remote.app.getVersion() (which you see in the InfoTab). . Boostnote does not have access to your volume design so it cannot create the storage folder. Are your sure this volume is connected?. I would suggest trying to remove all Boostnote config files, because it appears that Boostnote is trying to store your storage config in a file which doesn't exist. When you remove all config files, Boostnote should still be able to startup and will create new files for you in the default directory.. it's stored in your home folder (~/Boostnote), which contains a notes folder and a config file (boostnote.json). If it's not in that folder, you should search for boostnote.json. . It still tries to write the config file to volumes/design. Try clearing the localStorage from the developer tools (under the Application tab).. You're welcome, please close the issue.. will it take so much more time to process? I think this way it more consistent with Github and you need more info in order to compare the current version of your app with the latest release.. what do you with this feature request? There already is an option to delete tags, just press the cross next to the tag name.... I started with using onDragStart and onDragEnd, but decided that I needed the onDrop for this job. I removed the handler.. sorry for my late response @kazup01, I was very busy lately. I fixed the bug, I forgot to reload the tab at the oldIndex. Now it's working again.. I just added them, because I use both editors and always have to be careful not to commit those IDE specific files. Is it a real problem that we add them here?. what do you mean by .mjs? The deflate script is just a normal .js file.... I often get the request to make changes to code I didn't (have to) touch, which sounds like refactoring to me and in my opinion should be done in a separate PR. What is your stance on that? Do you want me to make changes to code that isn't part of the bug I am fixing with my PR, such as this one? In an earlier PR I did just that, and then I was asked to make those changes in a separate PR, so that's why I am reluctant to do it (I saw those unused imports already). . Sorry, you are right, I should've removed the imports as well. I'll do that in a minute. . ",

In fact these issues don't directly come from boostnote but from code mirror which is used to highlight code. I will create a PR in codemirror repository to support these commands.. \n.

The plugin has two options you can set:\n\nAutosave when a notebook is closed (a \"notebook\" is where Zim stores notes -- basically a folder). Although I've noticed it seems to only make a commit when opening Zim and detecting changes -- not on close.\nAutosave every \"x\" minutes where \"x\" is configurable.\n\nBoth of these options do an add/commit to the local git repository.  In addiiton, you can manually initiate an add/commit via a UI option.  There is currently no automatic push/pull option in the Zim version.\nIt's a nice way to get versioning of your notes.  I use it to keep my \"home\" and \"work\" installations of Zim on separate branches.  I usually don't edit the same notes at home and work, but if I do, I can simply merge the two together pretty easily via git since Zim, like Boostnote, saves notes as plain text files.\n. ",

It that way, Boostnote does not have to carry and maintain the IMAP overhead in the main project.

And, if trying to edit, then I will get a warning message. Then, in order to edit I would need to unlock the symbol and editing is available and note will be saved automatically after anychange. (Hahahaha, my understanding is that its like completely the opposite of the saving button. Now we need to protect ourselves against autosaving.) Anyways, with the button locked I'm still able to edit after clicking on the note, so the locked or unlocked button is meaningless (or the lock option is not working and then we have a bug.).

First thing I did was to install Boostnote to keep using my notes and generate new ones. Problem is that the new generated notes are disappearing in the front end, although the files generated for the notes seem to be there. Exactly as vnadella1 described above.\nPLEASE SOLVE THIS! Boostnote is fantastic but it would be a shame that I won't be able to use it with the Mac system at work!. @Rokt33r In my case I do not have error messages and not corrupted files. Problem is that I create a note, I can work on it, I can see it perfectly, but when I close boostNote, the notes dissapear from the list when reopening! As you can see in the boostNote list, (top right corner of screenshot) Supercomputing, CSIRO and Prueba1 storages all have 0 elements in the list, even when I already created many notes for them. All is lost when closing and opening Boostnote again!\n\nNotes are there, I have tried to create many of them (as you can see in the finder window left low corner). Notes are not corrupted as you can see in the text editor (top left corner). Your tool is fantastic. Please try to solve this.

It now seems to be fixed for v 0.11.4 in Mac, which is really cool! Thanks a lot! (I still need to confirm for  windows 10 and other systems, but this solution is looking supercool.

This superannoying bug crashes all the storage/folders organisation making it painful to work!. Yes, this issue was also solved in v 0.11.4 for windows 10. Thank you very much.. Yes, I can't see the scrollbars either. It is now version 0.11.3 In windows 10.. Still a problem in v 0.11.4 I need to resize the windows (or the storage/folders section) from its right side to make the scrollbar appear. This is annoying, hopefully you can solve it. Many thanks!. I use many (Mac, ubuntu and windows10). Right now I'm sitting in front of the Mac. And it have just updated to 0.11.4. Is this the latest release you were talking about? Many thanks Rokt33r. You rock!. Notes now do not disappear which is fantastic. Thanks a lot for this fantastic tool and all your efforts.

    "pmood": "@kazup01 Any update on this? Do you need more information? Just making sure it's been seen. . While it would be a neat feature to have js-enabled files... it's definitely something that should be approached carefully. The code snippet must actually be sand-boxed (unlike current JS running in BoostNote as per #1443 ). Even without the code execution/sandbox escape, it's going to be hard to implement in a safe way. \nI think of it like macro-enabled office documents. If JS gets officially supported, perhaps a banner should show before executing any scripts letting the user know that a \"live\" markdown file is being used, with some kind of warning? ex:\n\n. Hey guys, I reported the referenced batch of security bugs - thanks to everyone involved for your effort in fixing. I'll definitely re-test upon release and report any new XSS if I find some as a new issue. I agree with @Redsandro on pretty much all fronts. Allowing HTML while trying to prevent JS is a very painful path to go down. The side effect of this XSS allowing arbitrary code exec makes it even more dangerous. I think the whitelist approach is a good compromise. I don't think it's necessarily a bad decision to allow some html/css - it allows for a ton of cool features. Even my workflow depends on some html to format my notes appropriately, but I may be misusing the product a bit, haha. \nI regretfully don't have much time to help during the development phase, as my bandwidth is a little limited at the moment, but I can try to help on the pentesting front as much as I can.. Expressions should be impossible since that only works with old versions of IE as far as I know. Being limited to arbitrary CSS, the worst someone could do would probably be a keylogger. For ex: https://css-tricks.com/css-keylogger/ \nBut even that's no big deal really since it would require you to type your sensitive information into that markdown file (like, honestly, what's the attack vector there?). You may be able to use it to load things like local images or fonts into the page. Again, not really a big deal. You can probably crash the program by loading huge images over and over... but that's pretty meh. You could have it automatically make requests upon opening the file which would reveal your IP if the attacker controls the server.\nThe thing I am most interested in testing is the change to iframe and the filtering. I also started looking into maybe finding an issue to get XSS (or just flat code exec) using the existing markdown features rather than relying on inputting html directly.. If it's fine to allow style attr, then style tags could be added as well so that people don't have to copy and paste. I don't know of any XSS that would work in CSS in Chrome, so it should be fine. . @Redsandro @Rokt33r I am going to have to disagree with the comment that <style> is less safe than using style attributes. Anything that can be done within the <style> tag can be done with the style attribute of a specific element (I am not sure about including remote stylesheets - that should probably be excluded for now). If the project allows arbitrary CSS through style attribute, I don't believe there is any additional risk from allowing the style tag. All of the XSS attack vectors that use CSS do not affect webkit's rendering engine, and only apply to ancient versions of Internet Explorer. \nI don't disagree with OWASP's advice in theory. If a user can control the stylesheet of your website, they can indeed cause all sorts of chaos. Something as simple as html {display:none} or making a malicious link scale to take over the whole page, or as advanced as a CSS keylogger (source: https://css-tricks.com/css-keylogger/). However, disallowing the style tag prevents none of that from happening. It just means that users will have to copy and paste inline styles to their notes. \nPerhaps a \"global stylesheet\" would be a nice feature - though, this is kind of what themes are already. More of a user-specific one. \nThanks again to you both for the awesome improvements to the security of the app. I spent a few hours yesterday banging on it for a new XSS vector and came up empty. Awesome work! Now it's just about tweaking things to make sure everyone has the features they need while also doing what we can to keep them from shooting themselves in the foot. . @Redsandro I definitely respect your conservative approach to the security of the product, especially since I am almost always dealing with the opposite! I agree about Electron - it almost feels like the Adobe Flash of 2018 with the various security issues related to it, haha. \nWhile, sure, it is possible that an XSS vulnerability in Chrome that allows for XSS via CSS could be discovered, this would be a HUGE deal. To my knowledge, Chrome has never allowed JS to be executed via CSS, and no such vector has existed in any modern browser for quite a number of years. There are a lot more high value targets out there that would be picked on first before Boostnote (fortunately for Boostnote!) if such an attack vector was discovered. \nAll I am really trying to do here is describe the risk as accurately as possible. I am not personally advocating that allowing arbitrary CSS is 100% safe, but rather - if we allow style attributes, I think we should allow the style tag just to save people the pain of using inline styles. The attack surface is the same. Blocking both is another story. I personally feel just as safe with arbitrary styles being allowed as I do with links being added (even if it's part of MD, I found some potential issues that I will share when I get some time). \nI understand that a lot of notes are stored on dropbox (or similar), but we should also keep in mind that that such an attack would require a very advanced attacker and/or be heavily targeted. If I had access to your dropbox and wanted to take over your computer, I'd definitely look for executables first before finding a 0-day in a relatively small (but growing!) product. You know what I mean? It's not that your concern is crazy, it's just that I think the likelihood is very low due to all the moving pieces. It'd be different if there was an easy/known way of getting XSS/RCE (like before).\nSorry for being sooooo wordy! I know some of this probably belongs in another thread, but it's all kinda related.. For more details on HTML sanitization, you can check this out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_sanitization\nIn short, allowing ALL types of tags could result in very serious security issues. \nThe recommended option allows only certain HTML tags to be used - the ones that don't have any known security issues like <strong>, <summary>, and <details>. Same goes for only allowing certain attributes. \nThe \"Allow Styles\" option expands this list to include the style attribute as well as the <style> tag. This lets you customize your notes a little using CSS. Unfortunately, there are some rendering issues when mixing markdown with html that results in something like this:\n<details>\n\n* list item 1\n* list item 2\n\n<details>\n\nTo render as:\n<details></details>\n<ul><li>list item1</li><li>list item 2</li><ul>\n\nThe HTML rendered from the markdown is not nested inside the <details> tag like you would expect due to some sort of bug/issue when passing the note through the sanitization process. This makes styling markdown pretty difficult depending on your goal.\nWhen you allow dangerous HTML, that means that everything is allowed. Things like <script> tags that can not only execute javascript, but can actually run commands on your computer to do things like... download and run files, delete files, mine bitcoin, etc... Anything malware normally does, a malicious boostnote file could do as well. \nWhen you allow dangerous styles, the sanitization step is skipped, so the rendering bug does not occur, and your page renders precisely as you typed it. \n. Disclaimer: have not verified the bug, but just as a workaround in the meantime, anyone who needs this feature right now can go to view > Toggle Developer Tools, then go to the Elements tab and copy from there and save it as an html file. .

If any external process changes a note the app just picks it up and integrate into the database. By this file could be editable but we still gain from the use of database. (the usability of current filesystem storage by any external tooling is another topic to discuss - there open issues about it already). Considering the current \"plaintext\" cson format as something to read without Boostnote is far from reality. Neither the naming convention, nor the format is suitable for a human to work with.\nWith real plain text with front-matter to store metadata AND and a practical file naming convention could make it useful for non-boostnote use.\nIncremental synchronization should not be an issue. As I mentioned it could be imagined as \"primary\" or \"operational\" storage. Where boostnote would be working. It would be a perfectly viable solution to \"synchronize\" between file system periodically and frequently.

Thank you for your review!\nIt may take time for me to fix it, because I don't know what is best for this problem...\nI have two ideas about this.\n1. adding <br> tag to the number of code line.\n2. using other codemirror type? like CodeEditor.\nSorry for my confirmation. \nThank you.. Also, it is not good to break DOM structure and I reverted the commit.. Sorry for my being late and a mistake to close pr.\nI'm currently so busy with my work, and the request will not be satisfied soon.\nThe modification causing a bug was already reverted.\n. ",

    "jonblack": "In version 0.11.4 the hide preview (eye?) icon shown above isn't available (or I can't find it), so I'm not able to hide the preview.. Why not just make the \"Toggle Mode\" a tri-state? Sometimes I want the preview (plant-uml for example) and other times I don't. Having to go into preferences every time would be irritating.\n\nSo in the above image, the green toggle button would have three states instead of two.. In the new version (0.11.6) images are broken. The error in the developer console shows that it's looking for images in a folder called attachments, but they are in a folder called images.\nDid the root path for images change in the update but no process was added to move existing images from the images folder, perhaps?. I think there are multiple problems. If I manually move the images to the attachments folder it still doesn't load them. The path it's trying to load has the following prefix: file:///file:///, which obviously doesn't work.\nRe-adding them by dragging and dropping does work, and now I can see that there should also be a folder for the image, and that folder is the uuid of the note the attachment is in. So I guess the only thing to do is re-add for now.. I'm on Debian unstable.. The error doesn't happen all the time. Every week or so it seems to happen. Next time it occurs I'll open up the console, take a look, and report back.. This is going to sound weird, but I'm going to write it anyway. After a long while the problem has happened again, and I can sort of reproduce it.\nI have an ultra wide monitor (3440x1440) and use the i3 tiling window manager. When I run boostnote when no other windows are open, it takes up the entire screen. This is when it freezes. If I have one open window and start boostnote, causing it to split the screen in half vertically, the same thing happens - it freezes.\nHowever, if I have two windows open and start boostnote, causing it to split the screen vertically in three, it works fine. Every time.\nI opened a terminal and started boostnote (resulting in two windows) and saw these error messages:\n[6231:0730/132638.957548:ERROR:gles2_cmd_decoder.cc(17518)] [.RenderWorker-0x351cba3d8c00]GL ERROR :GL_INVALID_OPERATION : glBindTexImage2DCHROMIUM: no image found with the given ID\n[6231:0730/132638.957707:ERROR:gles2_cmd_decoder.cc(16743)] [.RenderWorker-0x351cba3d8c00]GL ERROR :GL_INVALID_VALUE : glCopySubTextureCHROMIUM: source texture has no data for level\nI'm not sure what to make of this. It's also worth pointing out that when it freezes, I'm unable to open the developer console either. It's fully non-responsive.. It's not that nice to have to setup a local plantuml server just for boostnote, and I can imagine some users aren't able to do that since the you need to clone the repository and either run maven or the docker image, which is quite technical..

Gotcha, I wasn't sure if it was a bug that the strikethrough text was shown when only ~~test was typed in the edit view. The issue really is that dispatchHandler is never called.

I am sure the update policy will involve an outdated folder removal in the future.\nIf they were to put all updates in the same folder they would have to pull a secondary branch or global file set which could provide a lot of unneeded issues.. I agree with you; I believe right now the export functionality for HTML is still in its infant stages. An option should be available to each do (Documents - Current) or All (which should include all project files). I think the only way to achieve this would be to have a 'Project Folder' of sorts to handle the export. For this type of functionality I still utilize Sublime Text but I do hope Boostnote has it in the future.. @ericchang00 - For writing technical documentation with coding notes yes. The company I work for does not allow data to leave site so having the ability to encrypt files/storage would allow my personal code to stay confidential in the event if I leave or someone accesses my computer.. @ericchang00 - Yes, I currently need to utilize Transcrypt which I have built into Sublime Text and then decrypt every morning. Would be nice if a simple password and encryption method was used per-storage in BoostNote as doing this with multiple document points can get tedious.. I would simply just bind the text into ```jscript tags before switching to the normal view or utilizing the snippet note function for these notes. If they are just meant to be 'old school books with text' this could handle it fine. If not I think this leads back to your other question and the official support of the Jquery library.. Unless they change how snippets function, no. It currently pulls the ID attached to the .CSON file. As snippet notes are all bundled in a singular file you would need to be able to pull the URL via the name.. I know Boostnote supports Java and JavaScript but maybe certain aspect of Jquery library which cause the editor to freak out? Also it should be noted that the stable version of Boostnote is 0.9.0 so I would try upgrading before posting.. I think the current premise is Markdown Notes are meant for Checklists and intensive documentation well Snippet Notes are just meant for multiple snippets with simple syntax formatting. I think giving Markdown Notes the ability to have tabs would help a lot of these requests.. Each storage location can point to a different folder so essentially this can be utilized? If you mean in regards to Projects and not note taking other applications such as Sublime text can allow opening multiple files within a project.. For us people slow to this thread; any suspected release date and renaming the folders on the Boostnote side or folder side? -Thanks. ",

I'm using Boostnote on Arch and OSX.\nBoostnote is opened on both computer, but if i already have a note opened on both, to refresh it, i need to close and restart.\nIMO,\n- any filesystem notifier can be used to reload the note if there is no changes unsaved. If there is, then adopt a notification same as an editor like the file got updated and should be reloaded (if saved, you can destroy changes made somewhere else)\n- when a note is opened, save the last modified date (and/or) hash of the content. When saving, ensure the current note still have the same last modified date (and/or) hash. Otherwise, adopt the same approach for conflict resolution.\nNot knowing that the note you're actually viewing / saving got updated before because your Boostnote instance was still running is a big deal :)\nAnd no, there is no need to constantly check for it, notifier and a basic check can be really useful to prevent loosing data and make Boostnote usage really powerfull across devices :)\n(by the way, congrat on the project, loving it. =).

I'd fix #1443 before addressing this.  This is a similar issue to that of Office document macros.  \nMy first thought would be to have localized settings for Boostnote that grant permissions for individual pages to execute scripts.

If I forget to CMD+R it will replace what I wrote on another computer.. Ever seen what they do in Keepass? Every time it is about to save, it checks whether the underlying file is changed. If it is, it will offer to merge.. I don't really care about teams, I just want it to work across multiple always on computers without having to reload the app..

You could always open it in a git client and find anything that went missing\nEven with file monitors thrown in the mix, external syncing with no internal consistency is always going to be a wildcard\nYou can script all the operations you need via the git CLI, I maintain a node package for it. That approach is nice because it's easier to audit commands and co-develop along CLI, but it would require users to have a git command on their system. A more portable approach would be to use a package that binds to native libgit2. On every save you compute a new commit, and when you go to update the master pointer you can easily ensure moving to the new commit is a fast-forward. Most conflicts could be merged automatically by git, and it cases where automatic merging fails you can just replicate the current behavior of overwriting with the current save, but also backup the other path to a branch. Doing the if-newer check would be a quick improvement over the current behavior, and stop some easily prevented loss.

The board view needs a filter to pick one tag that is common to a set of notes such as 'project name'; of course, this could also be blank so all tasks of all projects are visible. Under that should be a definable number of columns with filters to set e.g. 'backlog' and so on. \nI like the idea reassigning tags when moving a note from column to column. . ",

I use HTML and Javascript for Rapid Application Development Concept Demonstration (A Lot!!!). When I take notes, I would like to explain the concepts in a workable way, so that the demonstrated action reinforces the notes taken/stated. \nI can work around it for now, with the iframe tag, but this disconnects the notes from the HTML/Javascript, which means on export, I would have to pay close attention to the paths of these files, so that they go along for the ride in the export (and if they are going to be shared with anyone else, they would have to potentially re-path to not have broken iframe locations).\nTo work around the XSS/attack vulnerability, it seems like there could be a container (safe script) location, to allow them to only run within the context of Boostnote.\nMy initial thought on this, is that this could be an embedded apache/node.js server for local (localhost / http://127.0.0.1/), but could also be ramped up via security configuration to expand its network usage. For me the reasoning for this would be for things like Three.js to be hosted, as it would need a web server to serve it up. However it would also serve as a standard way to serve up resources that could then be archived and exported via .zip/.rar/etc... (something that is capable of saving relative paths) when you want to share the contents of your total note package with others, or archive a snapshot in time of what your notes were describing.\nAll that being said though, I could also do all of this manually for my purposes, and use the iframe object to serve it up within the notes.. Hopefully this comment is helpful as well...\nThere is a lot of Javascript libraries that would be useful to use inside of the editor as well, such as Mermaid, or Railroad-Diagrams, or custom JS class files that I would like to build and reference/use for myself inside a simple markdown like context.\nTo be able to serve these up locally and/or just reference them for use via something like cdnjs, would be extremely useful.\nThe list goes on from here, because what can be served up is almost limitless...\nThis would make Boostnote shine above the rest...\nThink about just from cdnjs - you could:\nload jQuery, bootstrap, use svg font libraries like font-awesome, etc...\nThis would seriously bring the world of web development (along with all of its super useful tools) right into the context of Boostnote.\nEven live connectable APIs - Google Docs, Dropbox, Github pull-requests, TFS, etc....

    "libeanim": "@Redsandro Thanks for your work and the explaination :+1: seems to be a real pain to solve xss without restricting users too much! \nLet me quickly outline some broken usage patterns caused by this fix here (please correct me if I'm wrong, I can then transfer them into a new issue if required)\n\nonly iframes from youtube.com are allowed. Iframes to any other video platform (e.g. vimeo)  don't work anymore. It seems odd to favour one platform.\nvideo tags are not allowed. Notes that link to a video on a server or a video file at local path won't work. (Same is true for audio)\nIf a user uses <p> to introduce a specific text styling/aligment that won't work.\nAlso divs which can be used to for example allow multi column text or to enable other text layouts, won't work.\n<mark> to highlight text or <ins> or <del>.\nsetting width and height of images\ntables which allow multiline rows need to use the table tag (and <tr>, <td>)\nAnd three things I do (might not be applicable to the majority):\niframe to import zoomable graphs (local html file) into my notes when I document data analysis results.\niframe to google drive maps for travel planning.\niframe to embed podcasts I wrote a summary for so I can quickly replay a part inside the note \n\n\n\nThis list can be endless and there will be almost certainly a broken usage pattern as long as the markdown implementation doesn't provide all possibilities that html does. Guess the question is what usage patterns boostnote wants to encourage (+ the majority needs) and which it wants to restrict.\nMy guess: Boostnote is specifically advertised as \"note-taking app for programmers that focuses on customizability\" so I guess in the long run restricting all html tags when there are no alternatives in markdown might be annoying for some users. What about allowing to deactivate sanitisation but activate it by default?\nBut I agree it's better to extend the markdown implementation so people can write everything in it.\nLet me know what you think about that.. @Redsandro Thanks for your response! Yeah, I agree to all of your points. Maybe I have some time in the next weeks to implement the one or other feature :relaxed:\nFor your interest regarding no 5:\n\nTrue. I think divs are safe and can be added to the whitelist, but I have never seen this in a note. Are you using this, or are you thinking of potential repercussions from this PR?\n\nyeah I used it to have an image on one side and text on another. Would be ace if multi-column text can be supported with markdown. I don't know whether there is any specification for that tho. Might look into that / create an issue. Cheers. Another option would be Quill.js which provides a lot of features and seems easy to use.\nBut Draft.js is specifically designed for react, so probably easier to integrate / maintain. :+1: . Cool thanks @Rokt33r for creating this issue!\nMy personal opinion is, to have a strict sanitisation as @Redsandro suggests containing some whitelisted html tags and urls (which are safe). We could then add a user configurable whitelist of allowed tags and the option to enable html in general with a clear warning.\nSo something like this:\n\nMarkdown Sanitisation\n:radio_button: :heavy_check_mark: Only allow secure html tags (recommended)\n:white_circle: :warning:  Use my own configuration\n:white_circle: :x: Allow dangerous html tags \n\n(the last two options could be combined)\nAdditionally we can add new features to the markdown renderer (provide [youtube-]video support aso) so that the need for html tags is no longer there.. @Rokt33r \n\nSo, I think we should hosting the app on electron via http\n\nHmm hosting via an http server seems to be a bit overkill (to my mind) and it would be best practice to sanitising the markdown/html anyways.\n\nAs long as I know, if the URL of BrowserWindow is starting from http://~~, global objects of Node.js, like require, and the local images are not available\n\nNot sure if I got your suggestion, but as node is integrated into the electron javascript engine, it doesn't matter whether one loads an html file locally or via http in the BrowserWindow object. So e.g. require('fs') would work in both cases.\nIn theory one could host the notes via http and reference them via iframes in the main app, but I would not prefer that to sanitisation.\nTo my mind the best way would be to use proper html sanitisation as @Redsandro did, make it configurable and add more features to the markdown implementation to reduce the need of html tags in general..

    "emrusso": "A quick +1 to @libeanim - I frequently use spans and divs to style definitions for class notes - I was pretty cranky to update my version in the middle of finals and lose all the styling I use to distinguish between concepts within notes.

Didn't mean to undercut the importance of security at all - I definitely appreciate (and prefer) the fast action on that, especially considering the prevalence of XSS. My main intent was to give more feedback on what html is used in the wild.

When I restart, the issue is present again (and is again resolved by refreshing the view). . \n@ZeroX-DG here is what happened. Not sure if that error is what's causing the issue with the editor pane or not though. I ran through the following test scenarios to reproduce the error/get it to stop:\n\nOpen Boostnote application to a note that fits all on a single page. The result was that attachment folder did not exist message. No editor pane cutoff occurs, but the note it loaded into didn't require any scrolling.\nFrom an open Boostnote application, I navigated to a different note. The message was logged a second time (I couldn't get it to log a third). Editor pane is cut off at the bottom.\nAfter refreshing the view (ctrl + r), the message is no longer logged, and I cannot get it to appear again. Also, my editor pane is normal at that point.. That's interesting! So yeah, if that's the case, there are no errors logged/thrown for the weird editor pane situation.

Sorry for the delay things have been super busy irl. @sosukesuzuki Thank you for making those changes \ud83d\udc4f . @romainwn Good to know thanks, will get right on that :). Tested on windows and it works fine.. @Rokt33r Sure thing will get on it this evening \ud83d\udc4d . @romainwn @Rokt33r I changed the logic to be either of the fullscreen methods depending on the platform. Having said that @romainwn that error you mentioned about it focusing on the search input is on master as well. :/. Ok so that change doesn't work on windows. So I have reverted the commit and will leave it until we find out if the issue comes from the master branch.. I'd like to suggest we change the focus on search bar shortcut to Cmd/Ctrl + L which is a more standard shortcut that I have seen in various apps for focusing the main input/search box in an app. (i.e. Chrome, Spotify)\nAlso @romainwn are you referring to this issue https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1803 specifically a shortcut for the editor fullscreen option?. This branch does exactly that :) All we need to do is change the focus on search bar to a different keyboard shortcut so that it doesn't interfere with the fullscreen shortcut and once we confirm that everything works correctly again then we are sorted \ud83d\udc4d . So I have tested by changing the top:focus-search as mentioned above. The fullscreen shortcut then works perfectly. @Rokt33r Should I put these changes in a separate pr and leave this one alone for now?. @Rokt33r Changes done, and I have tested on windows and everything works correctly \ud83d\udc4d . Fullscreen shortcut is happening \ud83d\udc4d https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/1754 \nWith regards to the top bar fullscreen option I agree with @ZeroX-DG for ctrl + shift + f.

Great idea I'm also a fan of one dark! :)\nQuick workaround that you can do for now that I have used in the past.\nDownload this https://github.com/Aerobird98/codemirror-one-dark-theme \nOn macOS you can copy the .css file into the app directly in /Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/codemirror/theme not sure about windows or linux but I assume it is similar.\n@Rokt33r @kazup01 Are we allowed to merge that repo into the existing BoostNote themes?\n. @bhrd Fixed :) https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2075. Sure will look into it this weekend!. @modmod24 Would you mind sending me a screenshot please? I'm using 0.11.7 and can't see the issue. Thanks :). Hey @modmod24 sorry it took so long to fix but see here https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/pull/2209. Nicely done @zhouxiaoxiaoxujian you beat me to the bug (was planning on fixing it this weekend), just tested it and looks good \ud83d\udc4d @kazup01 @Rokt33r lets get this merged in :). Hi @onlyphantom! I made the Monokai theme through trial and error so it is rough around the edges :) If you want to have a go fixing it I suggest you use the developer tools in the BoostNote app (Look under View).\nThen if you press the little mouse button in the top left corner of the inspector you can then inspect different elements on the page. This is how I find the correct classes that need to be updated. From there it is just a matter of finding the correct file in the code base :) . Let me know if you get stuck.

I also just had this behaviour, it went away for the moment when I opened the inspector.. @ZeroX-DG, seems to be fixed for me \ud83d\udc4d . @ZeroX-DG Looking at it I agree with you so I've made some alternative versions.

Some placeholder text for when the box is empty and not in focus such as \"Add Custom CSS\" may help make the purpose clear. Alternatively, perhaps making sure that the box is not the same colour as the interface theme. \n It's much more clear that the box is there and serves a purpose when they aren't the same colour, as seen below.\n\n\n. license updated as requested..

Your issue has been addressed in Pull request #2805 \nThank you for submitting an issue report!. May be related to issue #2803 . Sorry to say but what I linked to is not a solution. It is a person having a separate issue that may be related. I referenced it to help aid in finding the cause of the problem. . @wacsintegra At this time I don't really have an idea of what would be causing that, so until that's narrowed down and patched into the app by someone that does seem to be the case. . @wacsintegra If you could have the developer console open \n\nView -> Toggle developer tools -> Console (in the new pane)\n\nand then reproduce the issue and post the output from the console that may be incredibly useful.\nIn particular if some sort of stack trace somes up that will look something like this:\n\n. I believe the cause of this error to be related to \nhttps://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/blob/master/lib/main-window.js\nI think that Boostnote is trying to load a window location/size that was valid when it closed but is no longer valid when it opens, attempting to write display to a device that no longer exists. \n. https://askubuntu.com/questions/842409/what-is-run-user-1000-gvfs\nTo help narrow this down, have you manually set a storage location on a device such as a phone in direct file access mode?. Great feature!. Can confirm that this error is present on Windows 10 with the official Boostnote release.\nIt is not present when on the masterbranch of 0.11.13. I think this issue has been addressed and fixed in the new version. . It seems you've found the solution on your own. May I ask, what is the usecase in which you need to do this? . Issue looks to be related to lib/dataApi/attachmentManagement.js\nIn the function handleAttachmentDrop:\n\nA call to fixRotate is made\n\nfixRotate redraws the image by mapping it to a new canvas and saving. This would strip metadata and potentially change the file format.\nWhat is the purpose of fixRotate? Is the issue fixRotate is designed to fix more common/important than not changing the metadata/file format? Maybe it can be removed entirely.\n. Could perhaps be better implemented by an option in preferences? I'm not sure if it's something people would switch between frequently enough to need a dedicated button on the UI, and the logo for it is very close visually to the one next to it.. This doesn't appear to work correctly when used alongside toggling the code editor from split to full screen.\nResults in unexpected behavior counter to button purpose. \n. Actually pushing the written code would have been a great first step on my end.. The merits between those two choices I'm not sure of, this is just the recommended method from the official Electron guides.. electron-is-dev is pretty lightweight \n\n. This was a consideration I had but felt there may be some value in making it explicit for functions that call checkUpdate that it does not run in dev mode. Computationally it\u2019s a lightweight conditional check but the concern was for future coders to have more clarity why the update check is not running in development mode. Feel free to remove.. Code has been changed to this style, package has been removed.. Duplicate test removed, added a catch block to hedge against future exceptions.. Change made as requested.. Changed as requested. ",

    "nmearl": "Was this changed recently? I feel like a few versions ago, it was either editor view or preview view, and it was great. Now we're unable to have an editor-only view?. ",
    "reyes-c1": "I agree with it needing to be 3 state. If I'm editing I want to see split view sometimes and full editor sometimes. If I am not editing I only want to see preview. What's the point of putting all the markup in there if you never get to see the preview? I guess if you are only using it for plaintext like Asitis then that makes sense. Different people will use it differently. With 3 state people can work how they want.. I see the same problem. I was pasting some SQL from Visual Studio Code on Mac. Saw it happening both when pasting into a regular note inside a code block section (three back ticks) and also when posting it into a new snippet note. \nI just installed Boostnote an hour ago and was in the process of evaluating it. I think the only settings I changed was to Dracula theme.\nI can replicate it with this :\nselect col_one, col_two\ncase \nwhen col_three_jan is null then 'no value'\nwhen col_three_jan is not null and col_three_jan = (substr(col_four_jan,2,6)) then 'match'\nelse 'no match' end as col_three_match\nfrom sometable\nwhat showed up in the editor was:\n```\nselect col_one, col_two\ncase\nwhen col_three_jan is  null  then  'no value'\nwhen col_three_jan is  not  null  and col_three_jan = (substr(col_four_jan,2,6)) then  'match'\nelse  'no match'  end  as col_three_match\nfrom sometable\n```\nextra backslashes, double spaced, extra spacing in the line (e.g. around the word null). Not sure what mangled it. \nIf I copy the code from Visual Studio Code and paste into Atom it looks fine. \nIf I paste the code into Atom and then copy it to the clipboard again and then paste into BoostNote it looks fine, so it seems like it's specific to VS Code. \nI have no idea how the clipboard on Mac works, but I know on Windows, you can copy multiple formats onto the clipboard (i.e. one copy to the clipboard action may result in both plain text and RTF versions of the text in the clipboard) and it's up to the consumer of the clipboard to choose a format it supports from the available formats. Maybe VS Code is providing an RTF or other format that preserves color syntax highlighting and you all are just grabbing that instead of plain text... That would be my guess anyway... . Using the wonky old clipboard viewer I found at :\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/ClipboardViewer/Introduction/Intro.html\nand tweaking to to build on 64-bit MacOS, when I copy text from VS Code I see 4 formats put on the clipboard:\npublic.html\nApple HTML pasteboard type\npublic.utf8-plain-test\nNSStringPboardType\nThe last 2 look like plain text and the first 2 look like HTML. \nWhen I copy text from Atom, only the last 2 formats are put on the clipboard. \nOddly enough if I paste it into a normal note I see the _ in the editing pane but not in the pane where the markdown is rendered. Anyways, not sure what the intent was on the BoostNote side that led to this behavior was but for a programmers note app, you really need to be able to handle pasting from VS Code better, even if you just add a paste without formatting menu item or make that configurable. Since it doesn't actually replicate the HTML formatting in BoostNote when you paste one of those clipboard formats, not sure that it makes sense to use them. From the Electron docs it looks like you can query the clipboard formats available and ask for which you want. At a minimum you might want to change the code so that if you are pasting into a code block or snippet that you take the plain text option. Anyways, like I said I'm not clear on what the intent of the existing code was so something to think about... . That should have been that I see the \n\\_\nin the editing pane but of course the markdown here also ate the backslash. . @ZeroX-DG I  can reproduce it on Linux (Ubuntu 18.10). \nCreated the following sql in VS Code: \nselect col_one_one, col_two_two\ncase when col_three_three is null then \"no match\"\nwhen col_four_four = substr(col_five_five, 6, 5) then \"match\"\nelse \"well darn\" as match_game_over\nfrom sometable\nSave the file as junk.sql. You must save the file to engage color syntax highlighting.\nSelect all and copy.\nIn a terminal you can check what formats are on the clipboard like this:\nxclip -o -t TARGETS -selection clipboard\nand you can see what it has for html and text like:\nxclip -o -t text/html -selection clipboard\nxclip -o -t text/plain -selection clipboard\nCreate a new note in Boostnote. Type three back quotes and paste between the beginning and ending back quotes.\nWhat shows up is\n```\nselect col_one_one, col_two_two\ncase  when col_three_three is  null  then  \"no match\"\nwhen col_four_four = substr(col_five_five, 6, 5) then  \"match\"\nelse  \"well darn\"  as match_game_over\nfrom sometable\n```\n.

I just realised if you move the cursor by adding another photo or pressing enter the photo gets displayed.\nThere is an error but I think it is unrelated.\n\n\n\n. Thank you for responding.. The problem with having a link back occurs when you have more than one note linked to the same note. The linked note would require a list of links back to each note. It isn't intuitive to have a list of links in a note just for the purpose of getting back to other notes. However if feature request #1364 is implemented then a link back wouldn't be required.\nIn this case the link could open the linked note to the right in a side by side view. In which case closing the linked note restores the current note mode state(whether preview mode or split screen mode)\n\n.

Maybe it is because I don't know much css.This is what I did.\n\nonly the paragraph is being manipulated the math block stays the same.\n\n. Nope. I just did but it doesn't seem the change anything. The justification is still the same(a little bit to far to the right).\nAlso I don't necessarily want it to be left justified. Because it wouldn't look right.\nFor example, here is the document that i copied into boostnote as an example\n\nIt is centre justified but is displayed properly because of the page width.. It's not the convention, But I like it. It isn't left justified and everything lines up this way thank you.  . This isn't a bug the problem is that \"$$...$$\" is being used for inline Katex code\nEdit: I meant to say \"text can't be on the same line as the katex code block\"\n\n  . It is outdated. That was the way it used to work before. now it is customisable.  with the defaults being $...$ for inline and $$...$$ for block\nYou can change them to work the way they did before if you like, but i prefer the way they work now.\n\n. It only works if you change the Editor Font Family* to a Monospace font like Andal\u00e9 Mono for example, rather than Segoe UI**.

There may be some edge condition here I am unaware of. Will keep my eyes open.. Well that didn't take long, but I am still not sure why this is happening - I started editing a new document and this issue started happening, but only for a brief moment. After toggling back and forth between an alternate application and back to Boostnote a couple of times, the issue resolved itself.. Last observation for this issue - it seems some pattern of key strokes may cause this issue somehow. I noticed when typing while the document is locked in edit mode, it will automatically toggle the view mode right before the lock icon stops working. \nI realize this is a hard-to-follow issue, so I am doing what I can to get relevant info, but I think the best thing here would be a video of the issue. However, I have not been able to capture the issue in a recording since it's so inconsistent. . Figured it out. The issue is that the hotkey for 'Toggle Editor Mode` [CMD + M] is somehow messed up.\nReplication Steps\n1. Create a new document\n2. While in edit mode, press the \"M\" key several times > Observe Boostnote incorrectly toggles the edit mode\n3. Now, continue doing so, but press and hold down the COMMAND button > Observe nothing happens when this is pressed\nI am certain my keyboard is not broken and I have verified that the hotkey is still configured to be CMD+M, but that doesn't work - only pressing the \"M\" alone key will toggle the editor.. An additional little \"quirk\" about this issue - it never happens when typing capital \"M\" - only lower-case \"m\". It seems Boostnote is detecting that the command key is always being pressed down when it's not.. (Last comment, I promise) Updated the title to reflect the issue - I think it's simply a matter of the app thinking the CMD key is constantly being held down. This is why the \"edit\" lock issue also happens. This issue will presumably affect any hotkey that requires the use of the CMD key.. @zhuzelong as a rough \"workaround\" you can just delete the text from the key bindings fields. (You can't delete the keybindings themselves, but you can just delete the text and exit the settings - should auto save)\nIt might not auto-save now that I think about it. I tried saving and got an error, but after I exited the settings menu, the issue stopped (and the keybinding no longer worked, so I assume it either auto-saved, or the error was for something else I didn't notice)\nIt's not perfect, but it's made this issue much less annoying :). @dbburgess confirming your suspicion - I created #2098 and it is the same issue as this one..

I added a comment here https://github.com/BoostIO/Boostnote/issues/1988#issuecomment-457833469 .\n. > \n\nA quick fix for this is to change the last non-trailing slash ( \\ ) to a trailing slash ( / ). This worked for me on Windows.\nSo in the case of\n![Google_2015_logo.svg](:storage\\65473ce7-2769-4949-ad80-e348f9f261c6\\e78c79d4.svg)\nchange it to\n![Google_2015_logo.svg](:storage\\65473ce7-2769-4949-ad80-e348f9f261c6/e78c79d4.svg)\n\nThat seem to work but it is possible to result in error after the issue is resolved. So maybe we should just wait.. @CarinaGood @Devsper @dayfuaim @ZeroX-DG \nIt will work if you allow \"dangerous html tags\"\n\n. ",

You'll also find the image in a similar path under attachments. So this means :storage actually points to the attachments folder.\nYour paths may vary depending on your application version.\n\nFix\n\nFirst, move all your images into the attachments folder.\nThen, you'll need to remove the leading slash from all the image paths in all your notes. You can do this by going into your notes folder and running:\n\nsed -i '' 's/\\/:storage/:storage/g' *\nThat command will work on OSX. You'll have to figure out the equivalent sed command for Linux.

Since I first reported it hundreds of commits have been made. I am not criticizing anyone, I just think someone involved with the project needs to care about it for the sake of the users.. @ZeroX-DG Just curious, are you capable of attempting to fix the first issue yourself? I am only caring about this for the good of the projects users.. @ZeroX-DG Just curious, are you really sure you can't reproduce the second issue? I've tried it on 3 devices and I see it every single time.. @ZeroX-DG Well done!!!!

It might be helpful for anyone affected by this and wanted to use more recent version (until my fix is merged and officially released). At that moment only for Linux (rpm + deb), I'm planning to prepare Windows + macOS later. \nYou can find the binaries here : https://github.com/mbarczak/Boostnote/releases/tag/v0.11.8_2088_fix.

Hi, just throwing my 3 cents here : I think that the history menu could be very useful and not confusing, if it\u2019s exposed properly to the end user. An example of good implementation could be back/forward feature from Thunderbird : \n\nSo the main functionality is going back/forward, and if anyone requires deeper control , can use the \u201chistory menu\u201d available as a pull down menu glued to the back/forward button. @SubtleParesh  worked hard on this feature, and It would be a waste to get rid of the \u201chistory menu\u201d feature, especially if most of it is already coded ;). @ZeroX-DG , I've introduced change you requested, and indeed, it's more usable now. Also, I've added additional tests with CodeMirror mock.. @ZeroX-DG , all requests solved ;). Hi @Rokt33r , work is done here. Ready to be merged.. I like this idea. @ehhc , it would be just for sake of convenience. We could prepare a whole toolbar with handy shortcuts, similar stuff github is doing in the comment editor : \n\n. Probably the simplest way to combine them would be just to create another snippet in your collection name \"description.md\" and  move all contents of your current Markdown note to it. .

I use lists a lot, and this behaviour is a big hindrance to productivity - enough to push me away from Boostnote a bit. I wouldn't even want it enabled when there's selected text or depending on what follows the * - principle of least surprise. Of course, others like @palermog might prefer that behaviour, which is why there should be an Editor option to customize it. \nThe person who introduced Boostnote to me said it was \"highly customizable\", but at least when it comes to the Editor it's really not. There's no option to disable this auto-closing, none to disable the auto-placement of asterisk on the next line when the previous line has an asterisk (I often want to create sublists, and prefer using - or + for those, not *), the Editor section of the Interface preferences is in general very barebones.

Believe I've encountered this issue myself - It's not that the note fails to be created, it's that the created note doesn't match the search criteria, and doesn't get shown.\nYou can see this in the gif on this issue, as the count next to \"All Notes\" is correctly incremented each time a new note is created (starting at 1846, it increases to 1850 by the end of the gif).\nA possible fix could be to simply clear the search when a new note is created.. Hmm... that's true.\nThe more I'm looking into this issue, the more confused I'm getting. I'm starting to think that the root issue is that the code for jumping to a note by hash (using the list:jump event) doesn't work if the note is not visible in the note list.\nThat event gets fired when a new note is created (hence this issue), and also when clicking a link to a note from another note (browser/components/MarkdownPreview.js:826). I've tested and found the same issue when clicking a note link; if there is a search active which the linked note does not match, then it will not jump to the linked note.\n\nHowever, just to add to my confusion, it is possible to jump to a linked note which isn't in the current note list when looking at Starred notes, or notes within a particular Storage folder - in this case, the note is shown in the preview, but doesn't appear in the notes list on the left! I have now idea how this behaviour works, but I'm tempted to say that it is a bug in itself (or at least unintended behaviour), since it leads to a very weird scenario where the note which is in the preview is not the focused note in the note list, and in fact doesn't even appear in the note list.\n\n\nThis has led me to thinking that perhaps it should be switching to the /home route whenever we jump to a note by its hash. This provides consistent behaviour for all of these scenarios;\n\nCreating a note with search active\nJumping to a linked note with search active\nJumping to a linked note while looking at Starred notes\nJumping to a linked note while looking at a Storage folder. I've changed my fix in this PR to switch to the '/home' route when jumping to a note by hash. This should solve all of the issues described in my last comment in a consistent manner.. Sorry, I completely missed your comment back in October about it not working :S not sure why it wouldn't have worked when you tested it, but glad it's all sorted now \ud83d\udc4d. \n",

Glad to be able to work with you guys on this!. In general, console.log won't offer much information to users unless they are devs, and if they are devs, they can easily add it back in.

It turns out all you need to do is run yarn add markdown-it-admonition in the source code root folder after running yarn the first time, and this'll cause the packages to be built with it when you run the build commands.. @saaguero Great idea, I submitted a pull request here: #2214.

I think it has been merged into 0.11.9 and can be closed?. yeah, best feature ever! :+1:  I was longing for this from the first time I've used BN. So many redundant tags due to inconsistent letter case, plural / singular, synonyms, etc. \nI had a script before to rename all tags to clean it all up.. I just recalled vaguely there have been PR's for audio player and slide show so I wondered if they've been released yet. \n@ZeroX-DG can you add your player to the Welcome to Boostnote! note that ships with BN? That would highlight the feature. What do you think? \nI think the slide show was also from you? I can't find the PR / issue. \n. I disagree. . @FabioRosado I started a PR to your branch. . @b-fishr @nagledb another workaround would be to use character codes for empty space:\n```\nDemo Note\ntest link broken\ntest link working\n```\n\nDemo Note\ntest link broken\ntest link working\nthis is 100% compliant with markdown and works with Github's, Boostnote's and any other markdown renderer I've seen so far. The downside is it is less intuitive for the average user. . @kazup01 this is not a bug its a feature :smile:. resize.sh is recognized as URL with the domain http://resize.sh/. \nsh is the country code domain of Saint Helena. \nit only works with valid country codes, like *.com, *.fr, *.it, which is intended. :us: :fr: :it: \nit does not work with invalid country codes, like *.ccc, *.abc, *.ss, which is also intended. \nConsider this example:\ntest.sh. @ZeroX-DG this should be a feature request IMO. Pretty sure I have a few manually typed links in my notes that would break otherwise. . @ZeroX-DG I'll disable it forever. had the same problem.\nit doesn't happen when typing text but rather while pasting text containing a mixture of character encoding.. @gregor-d @whr94621 can you tell us which interface theme, editor theme, code block theme you are using in your preferences?

I would be prefer to be able to set certain pages to default to the read-only view so I can see my notes without the editor view taking up unnecessary space. I think it would be as simple as add another toggle between editor+preview view and preview-only view.. Thanks @matthaliski! \nFor anyone else having the issue, I had to change the \"Switch to Preview\" setting to \"When Editor Blurred, Edit on Double Click.\" Then, while toggling to preview mode, I had to move the mouse away from the toggle before mousing up.

Didn't really make sense that it would've been broken on Object.assign(). Made too much assumptions it would be broken on createNote() as I did not use any attachments during testing.\nThis explains why the behavior is different in Windows vs Linux/Mac. The flipping forward or backslash reverting after restarting an unmodified clone also makes sense now. browser/main/NoteList/index.js cloneNote() first creates note and saves it to disk, after that attachmentManagement.cloneAttachments() is called which bugs out the note, but does not save to disk. This also causes a bug where a cloned unmodified note will have the original note's attachment identifier when Boostnote is restarted.. I realize this is not a real fix for this, but for time being you can use plantuml skinparam to change the background to be able to read the text. It seems Boostnote makes white background transparent which causes issues with dark themes.\nYou can use skinparam backgroundColor #FFFFFE or similar to get almost white background. Another quick one if you need something more dark is skinparam monochrome reverse. \nYou could probably define custom colors for all the elements, but the definitions depends on type a diagram, so not really feasible to do that manually everytime (you could copy-paste though). Probably the real implementation to fix this would define hidden defaults for each Boostnote interface theme, but still allow user customization with skinparam if needed.. Bug seems to also trigger if you have normal text directly before the code block. If you leave an empty line before code block shows only once as expected.\nTested on Windows 10 and CentOS 7.3, so it's probably not OS dependent.. ",

Would it be possible to do it as a block instead, so each line does not need to be modifed? Something like:\n```\n%>\nTitle\nfoobar\n```\nprint \"Hello world!\"\n```\n%>\n```\n. @daiyam is a syntax change required at all? I envisioned this as a UI change when the markdown is rendered: all code blocks are collapsible and either all, or just ones with >10 lines, default to being collapsed.\nAs mentioned, these blocks can reach hundreds of lines. Requiring the user to add a couple characters to the beginning of every line is a significant burden. If a syntax change is required, can a start/end tag be used instead, like how the triple backtick for code blocks currently works?\nEdit: Another alternative would be to limit the size of rendered code blocks to 10-15 lines and include a vertical scrollbar to navigate within them.. Looking into it, it appears you're using CodeMirror to render these blocks. CodeMirror has built-in support for dynamic height. Right now the height is always set to auto, which will show the full contents. The collapsing could be implemented by adding a collapse icon above/next to the block and having the onclick toggle the height between auto and a fixed value. There should probably also be a hidden overlay that becomes visible when collapsed and provides a visual hint to the user that there is more content.. @daiyam I've attached a quick PoC I drew up. The important bits are all in index.html:\n- The style element at line 12285\n- The script element at line 12343\n- The added button element inside the span.filename element of the code block, at line 12382\nboostnote-poc.zip\n. @daiyam yes, that looks great!. @daiyam thanks! I've tested it and posted a few issues in the PR thread.. 1) The icons for btn-clipboard and btn-expand/btn-collapse do not render properly:\n\nSame note in 0.11.9:\n\n2) The btn-clipboard icon moves when the code block is expanded:\n\n3) The expand/collapse button is at the bottom of the code block. Convention for expand/collapse icons is to have them at the top and to the left of the container (e.g. \\<details> tag, code folding, etc.).\nHere are the display settings I used:\n\n. ",

Having two different modes does not make much sense. For instance, Bear (which is hands down the best markdown editor I used) has one mode - it's a combination of Boostnote's preview and source views. Basically, it creates the preview on the fly in the same view as you edit. So it looks nice and is easy to use.. This is how it looks:\n\nSo the markdown is already parsed on the fly and you can type in the same view.\n. @ZeroX-DG OK, after a few hours of use, I noticed a bug when using \"Switch to Preview: On Right Click\". Basically, it works fine until reopening of the app. When I shut it down and re-open it, I can't start editing. I click on the editor view, but the cursor is not placed anywhere. To solve this, I have to click on \"Toggle Mode\" twice, then I can start editing. Basically, the \"on right click\" is definitely broken.\nTested this on Windows and macOS with Boostnote 0.11.10. The same buggy behaviour on both platforms, sad to say.. @ZeroX-D What I meant is that every time i restart the app, it shows the editor in the edit mode (not preview), but I can\u2019t edit.

    "galian123": "Why the image added into one note can not be added into another note?\nIn my opinion, an image is not bond to any note. One image can be added into several notes.\nNow, if one image is added into some note, like this ![](:storage\\246c4991-7b59-44ce-8ff4-955a0328e5ec\\9c6ca173.png), it can not be added into another note.\nWhen I copy/paste ![](:storage\\246c4991-7b59-44ce-8ff4-955a0328e5ec\\9c6ca173.png), a warning shows to me: \n\n\u26a0 You have pasted a link referring an attachment that could not be found in the storage location of this note. Pasting links referring attachments is only supported if the source and destination location is the same storage. Please Drag&Drop the attachment instead! \u26a0\n\nBut, actually after I pasted ![](:storage\\246c4991-7b59-44ce-8ff4-955a0328e5ec\\9c6ca173.png) to other notes, the image can display well.\nSo the code to check file exist may be not incorrect. . ",
    "Diomas": "As to me this automatic deletion of unused attachments is quite annoying. At least in it's current implementation. Even if I copy/paste attachment references inside the same single note, I ended up with a deleted file sometimes. So to be safe i have to copy attached files somewhere outside boostnote storage, do bunch of edits to note then close boostnote app and copy missed attached files back to attachment folders.\nI'll try to capture exact steps to reproduce and create bug for this.\nDuplication of the same file if it's used in different notes is also strange. Update: attached PNG images don't grow in their file size (the size becomes even slightly smaller), but they do loose all image metadata as JPG images do. I have to comment out the code that manages attachments because of that. It deletes files not only while directory sync process but when a note is edited and attachment references are copy/pasted inside the note itself.\nThis:\n// const {\n//   storageKey,\n//   noteKey\n// } = this.props\n// attachmentManagement.deleteAttachmentsNotPresentInNote(\n//   this.editor.getValue(),\n//   storageKey,\n//   noteKey\n// )\nAnd this:\n// } else if (attachmentManagement.isAttachmentLink(pastedTxt)) {\n//   attachmentManagement\n//     .handleAttachmentLinkPaste(storageKey, noteKey, pastedTxt)\n//     .then(modifiedText => {\n//       this.editor.replaceSelection(modifiedText)\n//     })\nNow everything works just fine.
