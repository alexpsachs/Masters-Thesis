Generally, if the OK button dose work, then there is no problem with application.\nMaybe is Chromium problem.

Hi @lukashillebrand, can you help me test.\nopen a terminal window cd to the directory where your app reside and launch your app via the command line like this:\n./koala.app/Contents/MacOS/node-webkit \nyou should be able to see error messages in the terminal window if any.\nThanks.\n. Thank you. \nThis  error message is not enough, try run this command: /Applications/koala.app/Contents/MacOS/node-webkit, can see more detailed information.\n. run /Applications/koala.app/Contents/MacOS/node-webkit  directly, without open\n. This should be the real reason. Koala is build with node-webkit, I will to the community to find a solution.\n. @lukashillebrand \nThere may be package problem, I was in the windows for packaging.\nI repackage the app, download form here: https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/share?s=Nf4Jhgg8SOYhWV30NxCtb4\nCould you test it again.\nThanks.\n. You need add ruby.exe to path. Here's the document Ruby Installation - Windows\n. Cheers. \n. Not all people like to use the beta version, and the beta version of the update faster, I don't have enough resources to package the new version and testing.\nYou mention a good idea.

Do you want to compile a less to multiple output style css, like a normal\nfile and a compress file.\n. I'm sorry, can't output css to several folders at the same time, but there is another way, add the same folder as multiple projects, koala will watch the file of the last added project, set the different output of each project. When your development is complete, compile the other projects manually.\n. After version 1.4, you also use this way. Create a project settings first(here docs), set the \"css_dir\" field.\nwhen development is completed, change the \"css_dir\" value to another directory, select on all the files, right-click on them and click compile.\n. Sorry, it will make program more complicated.\n. Is really necessary to output multiple folders at the same time, what is the difference between to synchronize file at the end?\n. Thanks. \n.

You mean that the \"variables\" file does not be watched?

I get it.  @import \"includes/test\" the real imported file is \"_test.scss\". If there are two files \"_test.scss\" and \"test.scss\" at the same time, Sass is preferred to use \"_test.scss\".\nI'll fix it in next version, thank you  for your feedback. ^-^\n. \u662fless\u7f16\u8bd1\u5417\uff0cless\u5df2\u7ecf\u5347\u7ea7\u5230\u4e861.4\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0d\u5728\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u3002\nNote: prior to LESS 1.3.1 a (~\"@{name}\") type of selector was supported.\nSupport for this will be removed in 1.4.0.\n\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u8bf7\u5230less\u5b98\u7f51\u67e5\u770b\u3002\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u5e0c\u671b\u7ee7\u7eed\u4f7f\u7528\u8001\u7684less\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u672c\u5730\u5b89\u88c5less\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728koala\u8bbe\u7f6e\"\u4f7f\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u4ef6\"\u4e2d\u52fe\u9009less\u3002\n\u5728 2013-6-25 \u4e0b\u534811:18\uff0c\"hubo\" notifications@github.com\u5199\u9053\uff1a\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/oklai/koala/issues/42\n.\n. \u53e6\u5916\u8bf7\u7ed9\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\n\u5728 2013-6-26 \u4e0a\u53488:06\uff0c\"Ethan Lai\" lain.z.q@gmail.com\u5199\u9053\uff1a\n\u662fless\u7f16\u8bd1\u5417\uff0cless\u5df2\u7ecf\u5347\u7ea7\u5230\u4e861.4\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e0d\u5728\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u3002\nNote: prior to LESS 1.3.1 a (~\"@{name}\") type of selector was supported.\nSupport for this will be removed in 1.4.0.\n\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u8bf7\u5230less\u5b98\u7f51\u67e5\u770b\u3002\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u5e0c\u671b\u7ee7\u7eed\u4f7f\u7528\u8001\u7684less\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u672c\u5730\u5b89\u88c5less\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728koala\u8bbe\u7f6e\"\u4f7f\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u4ef6\"\u4e2d\u52fe\u9009less\u3002\n\u5728 2013-6-25 \u4e0b\u534811:18\uff0c\"hubo\" notifications@github.com\u5199\u9053\uff1a\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/oklai/koala/issues/42\n.\n. \u67e5\u770b\u4e0b\u4f60\u662f\u5426\u5728\"\u4f7f\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u4ef6\"\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u52fe\u9009\u4e86Less\uff1f\n. \u52fe\u9009\u540eKoala\u5c31\u4f1a\u8c03\u7528\u4f60\u672c\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684Lessc\u547d\u4ee4\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6ca1\u5b89\u88c5Less\u5c31\u4f1a\u62a5\u9519\u5566\u3002\n\u5982\u4f55\u5b89\u88c5Less\uff1a\n1\u3001\u9996\u5148\u5b89\u88c5Node.js\n2\u3001\u5b89\u88c5Less\uff0c\u6253\u5f00\u7ec8\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u547d\u4ee4 npm install less@1.3.3\n.

Thanks.\nI have a plan, develop a new interface to do the compression function. Generally, we compress the static files only in the final stages, not necessary to real-time compression when the file has been modified.\nI imagine features include the follow:\n- compress image, css, javascript\n- ftp or remote directory sync after compression\nHave any Suggestions?\n. Here the compression component.\nJavascript:\n- UglifyJS\n- YUI Compressor\n- Google Closure Compiler\nCss:\n- YUI Compressor\n- clean-css\n- sqwish\nImage:\n- OptiPNG\n- PNGOUT\n- libjpg\n- libjpeg-turbo\n. aha, image compression feature in our next development plan. Let us discuss here #220.\n.

In less 1.4, default behaviour of import is to import each file once, @import-once has been removed. Changelog\nYou can use @import directly. If you do not want to modify your code, you can install Less compiler manually, than set kaola to use the system libs.

Hi @TisRyno, please also help to check out the homepage if there is any wrong place.

Hi @TisRyno,\nI have merge this commit into master branch.\nCheers.\n. @niklas-heer \nThanks for your translation.\n. @niklas-heer \nYou said that there are some strings are not internationalized, please tell me which, what are your suggestions?\nThanks.\n. Thanks for your suggestion, you have done well. The option names is not description text, make them be consistent with the names of compiler docs will easier to understand. \n. Hi @keeev @niklas-heer ,\nThe next version Koala is still in development, if there have some new context, I will tell you in here.\nThanks for your help.\nCheers.\n. Hi @niklas-heer ,\nKoala 2.0 development has completed, and there are some new language field, can you compare with the language template and translate the new field. \nLanguage pack template: https://github.com/oklai/koala/tree/master/src/app/templates/locales\n. Are you use the linux version? or Mac version?\n. Hi samacs,\nIf you use Mac, you can modify the ruby path in this file: koala.app\\Contents\\Resources\\app\\app\\compiler\\compass.js:34 and koala.app\\Contents\\Resources\\app\\app\\compiler\\sass.js:34\ncommand.push('ruby -S'); --> command.push('custom-ruby-path -S'); \nFor linux system, use this command: sudo ln [custom-ruby-path] /usr/bin/ruby.\nCheers.\n. Hi @samacs,\nThe custom ruby path feature has been achieved, you will see it in the next version Koala.\n. If you can, welcome to join to develop Koala. If you are interested, please check out this branch https://github.com/oklai/koala/tree/concept.\nI also don't understand what is the function of frameworks, can you describe it. And I found bootstrap less file here https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/master/less, are these you are looking for?\nWe are developing the compiler modular functions, it will be easy to add a new comipiler of some language(such as jade, haml, stylus), and the minify and concat js/css function has been in the development plan.\nCheers.\n. I understand, you can use the project settings function of Koala, docs: https://github.com/oklai/koala/wiki/Using-project-settings. It allows you to specify the import include paths.\n. \nYes, once for all is a great idea, I will add a global include paths option in settings window, it will be applied to each project.\n. Hi @bachy ,\nIf you are interested, you can join and welcome.\nI'm not good at English and I don't know graphics, and Koala is built with web technologies, so if you join, you can help us.\n. Guys,\nI have another idea, how about just use one import rule, @koala-include or @koala-import. Single rule easier to use, and is easier to maintain the javascript code. You can see LESS, Sass, CSS, or Server-side language php, they are all only has one rule.\n. I dont like import code in the middle of the current code too, I misunderstood thought codekit allowed to insert the code in any place. So we can only match the import file in file head.\n. include_once is nice!\n. Hi @JerryWenlong ,\nThe default encode is \"utf-8\", what is the problem you are experiencing?

Error notifications:\n\nDo you want show the error notifications, Koala already have this feature.\n. It's just a habit, no need to focus on whether the code compiles successfully, the default is a successful.\n. Ok, it should be supported, it's useful in some case.\n. Good news, this feature has been completed.\n\n. If you have not specify the output directory and the scss/sass files in a directory named sass, Koala will auto create the css folder. About the stylesheets, it's may created by compass command, I will find out the reasons.\n. Does anybody would like to join Koala project to add this feature, now I'm\nvery busy with my job. I also want to add this feature, but I do not have\nenough resources.\n2014-04-17 0:46 GMT+08:00 RomainSauvaire notifications@github.com:\n\nI definitely need it to make the switch from Prepros to Koala !\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/oklai/koala/issues/108#issuecomment-40622648\n.\n. Hi @RomainSauvaire \nIf you know JavaScript, try it. Koala not use ruby, it built with web technologies and nodejs.\n. Nice!\nThe next work is make it support running autoprefixer on Less/Sass/Compass compiled.\n. https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer#compass\nI found a way to use autoprefixer for Compass, and I have test it on Koala, it works fine.\n. Latest news, I added autoprefix for all.  We will see it in the next version, and the next version come soon.\nCommit https://github.com/oklai/koala/commit/e7fd73077013037d4d8cb156ebfb9f299c7b86c5\n. Koala 2.0.3 has been release, update your koala to the new version,\nthen select someone file, you will see the \"Autoprefix\" option.\n\nangoras notifications@github.com\u4e8e2014\u5e745\u670823\u65e5\u661f\u671f\u4e94\u5199\u9053\uff1a\n\nGreat news, thank you!\nIs there a way to configure the autoprefixer settings?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/oklai/koala/issues/108#issuecomment-44004460\n.\n\n\nSent from Gmail Mobile\n.

Is  the problem  resolved? Try reload your project, then will watch the file again.\n. @ifaris7  Find the \"main.less\" file path in ~/.koala/imports.json, is the \"posts.less\" file path in the array field? If yes,  maybe file watcher has bug. \n. Do you installed \"libudev\" ?

Fetch files from urls is not good  way, I think the way import the libraries from local is more safe and easier to manage.\n. The layouts.less file does not need to compile separate, and you can cancel the auto compile option at the sidebar.\n. Sure,  the sourcemap feature useful, I like it too. I know the LESS 1.5 version has supports sourcemap, I will add the sourcemap option in the next update of Koala. \nThere is also a ready-made way to add source map option, please see the docs Using project settings, add \"--source-map\" into customOptions field.\n. Hi @helgatheviking , I have create a wiki page here. Add Source Maps option\n. Yes, need the \"-g\" option, I forgot this. I've updated the wiki.\n. May be permissions issues, you can make Koala to using system librarires to compile the Sass file.\n- install Sass and Compass\ngem install sass\ngem install compass\n- Open Settings: Compass --> Advanced Settings, select the \"Use the System Compass compiler\", and you also can set the Compass executable path.\n  \n. \u4e2d\u56fd\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e2d\u6587\u9875\u9762\u4e0b\u8f7d\uff0c\u7528\u7684\u662f\u5fae\u4e91\u5b58\u50a8\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5e94\u8be5\u5f88\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0cAmazon\u5728\u56fd\u5185\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u5899\u3002\n\nCheers.\n2013-10-29 \u4e0a\u534811:56\u4e8e \"Wang Zhuochun\" notifications@github.com\u5199\u9053\uff1a\n\n\u6bcf\u6b21\u4e0b\u8f7d\u523010MB-15MB\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5c31\u88abAmazon Cloud\u7ed9\u65ad\u4e86\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u7ee7\u7eedDownload\u3002\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/oklai/koala/issues/115\n.\n.

Before Koala add this option, there is a way to make Koala using the SourceMap option, please refer #113.\n. Hi @TH-NK-MichaelOrd, thank you for your suggestion, it's nice, I would consider support this.\n. Hi @TH-NK-MichaelOrd , please seed the code to me, let me have a look first. \nKoala has support  make compiler extension, refer here https://github.com/oklai/koala/wiki/How-to-create-a-compiler-extension%3F , and there is an extension case https://github.com/zaygraveyard/koala-dust. You can write an extension to replace the built-in compiler.\n\nCheers.\n. I'm tracking this bug, but when you reload the project or re-add the project, the problem is gone.\n. Delete this forder %userprofile%/.koala, will clear all program data, then add your project again.\n. maybe is this %userprofile%\\AppData\\Local\\koala, the cache forder of node-webkit.\n. @yanxyz Thanks.\nBut now can not be directly merger into the master branch, I plan to use a new git branching model, I will create a new \"develop\" branch, then we will work on the develop branch.

Hi @dannystyleart \nThanks for your suggestion. Supports wildcards will cool, but it also will be complicates, I have not seen anyone do so.\n. @zaygraveyard Here's a great suggestion, about js file combine feature. How do you think?\n. After the test, I found, SASS default on removing the @charset parameter. And I found some docs here http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#encodings , hope useful to you.\n. It's a good idea, but I don't sure node-webkit whether to do it. I will have a try, and this is not the highest priority function.\n. The line numbers is throw from internal LESS compiler, I can't to make the same thing for coffee, sorry for that  :( .\n. Yes, Koala now only watch the first-level imports, it's yet  not perfect. I  have plan to supports deep imports watched.\n. This feature has been added in this commit https://github.com/oklai/koala/commit/ab45e45cdb8b60180c390bf39997baee19a38698\nPlease wait for the next release.\n. What system you are using? Koala need ruby has installed.\n. For Windows and Mac OS X, ruby is ready. For Linux, need to manually install it. e.g. $ sudo apt-get install ruby\n. https://github.com/oklai/koala/wiki/Docs#use-custom-compiler-versions\nPlease  try set Koala to use the custom compiler, maybe will be work.\n. Please keep the config.rb file in the root directory of the project, Koala only to find the config file in the one-level directory. When the config file is modified, Koala wil auto reload the project, or you can reload the project manually.\n. Hi  @khaustic, what system does you use, I have test the same config under mac, it work fine.\nAnother way to fix this issues, install Compass and set Koala to use your local Compass path.\nCheers.\n. @khaustic Sorry for that. After testing, I found the problem, but still not resolved. \nTemporary solution is move config.rb to --src directory, then edit the config.rb file to reflect again. After done that,   remove the old project form Koala and re-add the --src folder.\n. @khaustic Good news, I have fixed this bug, and the next version will be release soon.\n. @sebklaus  Thanks.\n. Of course, if there is a better way, I prefer to put them in the local language pack.\n. https://github.com/oklai/koala/commits/develop\nHi @sebklaus, we are work in the develop branch, I have merge this pull into develop .\n.

Find %koala%/app/scripts/compilers/SassCompiler.js:SassCompiler.prototype.sassCompile, add this code global.debug(error) at the bottom of the function.\n\n``` js\nexec(command, {timeout: 5000, maxBuffer: 2000*1024}, function (error, stdout, stderr) {\n    if (error !== null) {\n        global.debug(error); // for debug\n        emitter.emit('fail');\n        self.throwError(stderr, filePath);\n    } else {\n        emitter.emit('done');\n        //add watch import file\n        var imports = common.getStyleImports('sass', filePath);\n        self.watchImports(imports, filePath);\n    }\n// do awayls\nemitter.emit('always');\n\n});\n```\nRestart Koala, then press F12 to open the developer tools, switch to the \"console\" section, if error when compile sass file, the detailed error message will be printed out.\n. Thanks. But this information is not enough, please continue test.\nFind \"argv.push('--cache-location \"' + path.join(FileManager.userCacheDir, '.sass-cache') + '\"')\", and comment this line, add the no-cache option.  \njs\n//argv.push('--cache-location \"' + path.join(FileManager.userCacheDir, '.sass-cache') + '\"');\nargv.pus('--no-cache');\nand print stdout and error.\njs\nglobal.debug(error); // for debug\nglobal.debug(stdout);\nglobal.debug(error);\n. There is no other way.\nWhat is the system and the ruby version you are using? \n. Try update ruby to the 2.x version, and set Koala, Settings --> Use Custom Ruby --> checked.\n. Thanks all, I will set the default value of maxBuffer to  10000*1024.\n. Hi @MuruganGee,\nYou need reload your project after you change the Output Style option of Default Options.\nIf you using a koala.config file for the project, you should change the option in it.\n. @AdrianTP \nThanks, I have merge this into the develop branch.\n. Hi @ArchCarrier ,\nI have create a wiki page for this issue Install other libraries or Ruby gems in Koala.\n. Sorry, I gave the wrong address.\nHere the correct: https://github.com/oklai/koala/wiki/Install-other-libraries-or-Ruby-gems-in-Koala\n. I agree with this. How about delete projects with DEL key too?\n. And press F2 to rename the project.\n. Good. Thanks. :)\n. Do you mean the \"debug info\" option?\n. The  \"debug info\" option corresponds to the parameter \"--line-numbers=mediaquery\" of lessc.\n. Hi @spacelab-x ,\nconfig.rb\nruby\nhttp_path = \"/\"\ncss_dir = \"_css\"\nsass_dir = \"_sass\"\nimages_dir = \"images\"\njavascripts_dir = \"javascripts\"\nI test by this config, it works fine.\n.

Please see #131 \n. Hi @jourant \nI  tested, There is a bug to read the config.rb file. (environment == :development)  cann't be read correct.\n. Hi @Hobokens \nTry to install Koala on another system drive such as D:/Program Files/Koala, or run as administrator to open Koala.\n. First, you need compile the file \"main.less\" once, so Koala to know witch files been imported in \"main.less\", and you can only add the \"main.less\" into Koala.\n~/Library/Application Support/Koala/UserData/imports.json, this file has save the imports relationship, please search the \"main.less\", so that to know which imported files are not been watch.\n. Is the main-imports.less been imported in main.less and the other less file are been imported in mian-imports.less?\n. Koala only watch the one-level imports, it means files in main-imports.less have not been watched. I think this is the reason.\nI have plan to supports deep imports watched. #137\n. Hi @JohannesFerner \nThere is a way to create a config for the project, then the new file will apply the default-settings.\nhttps://github.com/oklai/koala/wiki/Using-project-settings\nThe auto-compile option has not been support in the default-settings, I will add it in future versions, thanks for your suggestion. But now you can make batch settings, select multiple files, then right-click.\nCheers.\n. Good idea.\n. @jgo4th \nThe lastest verstion has a bug on Windows 7 64bit system, if koala can't run, please install the old verstion 2.0.0. \nHere the history versions: https://github.com/oklai/koala/blob/master/Changelog.md#200\n. Hi @stockman \nWhat is the error message? \nThe example path D:\\Program Files\\Ruby193\\bin\\ruby.exe . \nIf ruby is already in the system environment variables (using ruby commands directly in the terminal), the path option can be empty.\nCheers\n. If there has a config.rb file, Koala only watch the sass directory, obviously there will be some problems doing so. Temporary solution is independent add the js directory.\n@spacelab-x, here the wiki how to use js compress feature: https://github.com/oklai/koala/wiki/JS-CSS-minify-and-combine .\n. Hi @JeffB-14 \nPlease follow this issus #259\n.

The _ means it is a partial.  I was wondering shouldn't changes to these files trigger it to be recompiled?  Eg, in the _variables.scss case, you can have colour, sizing, font (and more) definitions so surely changes should trigger a recompile?  Is there something I'm doing wrong?\n. Yep _variables.scss not watched when imported like:\n@import \"global/variables\";\nI've done some more testing and hopefully this makes it easier to replicate, files are:\n/master.scss\n/includes/_test1.scss\n/includes/_test2.scss\n/includes/_test3.scss\n/includes/_test4.scss\nmaster.scss\n@import \"includes/test1\";           // no\n@import \"includes/_test2.scss\";     // works\n@import \"includes/test3.scss\";      // no\n@import \"includes/_test4\";          // works\nFrom my testing above, it appears that imported files are watched if they have the filename spelled out exactly (extensions can be omitted).  From above, _test2.scss and _test4.scss are watched, the others are not.  Not sure if this is a Sass or Koala thing... According to the Sass docs, the _ is omittable.\n. ",

Hi @zeltice, you might want to check-out issues #62 where we discuss js minification and imports in js, we currently use UglifyJS2 for concatenation and minification of js.\nAnd from the looks of it, you know a lot about minifiers and we (or at least I) could use your knowledge, so if you have any suggestions let us know.\nCheers\n. so can we close this issue?\n. Hi, thanks for help, but there is some points you should know:\n- You should work from the \"feature/make-compilers-modular\" branch which is the latest and has all the new change.\n- In the locals files the part to the left of the column \":\" should not be changed as it is used be the code and will be used to lookup the one on the right (e.g. \"non localized string\":\"localized string and ready for display\") and as you might have guessed ${...} is a place holder.\nIf you can redo the changes but from the \"feature/make-compilers-modular\" branch (which is somewhat different) and sent a new pull request, I'll happy to merge it in.\nIf not, I can try to cherry pick the fixes and apply them to the \"feature/make-compilers-modular\" branch.\nCheers\n. :+1:\n. Hi @bachy, do you prefer to import js files using @import or CodeKit's @codekit-prepend and @codekit-append?\n. I see, so you don't like @import.\nAnd do you use @codekit-append or just @codekit-prepend?\n. for now it will be //@koala-append \"path/to/file.js\"; and //@koala-prepend \"path/to/file.js\"; much like CodeKit, unless @oklai has any suggestions.\n. And @bachy Koala is like Brackets, built with the web for the web, so if you know JavaScript, CSS, HTML, graphics creation, node.js, jade, and/or multiple languages, you can contribute to this project.\nSo what do you say give it a try?\n. @bachy, I'm glad you feel this way :), and if you need any help let us know.\nCheers\n. @oklai, the creator of CodeKit explains his reasoning in this video, and if @bachy agrees with your idea, I will not oppose.\nCheers\n. Hi guys,\nSorry for the delay but I'm having some computer crises (my computer isn't turning on) I finished the import feature it works similarly to php's include_once in the sense that the file gets imported only the first time\nExample:\nFile a.js:\njs\n//@koala-prepend \"b\"\n//@koala-append \"c\"\nconsole.log('a');\nFile b.js:\njs\n//@koala-prepend \"c\"\nconsole.log('b');\nFile c.js:\njs\nconsole.log('c');\nMinify a.js --> a.min.js:\njs\nconsole.log('c'),console.log('b'),console.log('a');\nWhat do you think?\n. @bachy, \nyou are correct about the typo, I fixed it (it was only in the comment, not in the code). \nAnd about the debug info, UglifyJS can generate a source map, will it help?\nYou see the UglifyJS2 for full documentation about what it can do.\nI just go through the js files and collect the all required file, put them in order and hand them to UglifyJS.\n. Hi @bachy,\nthanks for letting us know of this bug.\nthis should fix it 132a447.\nit will be awesome if you can try this fix, and let us know if it works.\ncheers\n. The append/prepend multiple files syntax is discussed in #196.\n. Thank you\n. @Muco-Tresor Can you give us more details? Like how did you install it, and what's the error.\nThanks\n. Hi @vlkz, what version of Koala are you using?\n. @vlkz if its v1.4.1, I detected the problem and it should be fixed the upcoming new version.\nif @oklai can release a new patched version before the upcoming one, I'd be happy to commit a patch.\nThanks for reporting the bug.\nCheers.\n.

Hi @krazyjakee, sorry for the delay, if your folder doesn't contain a config.rb file, then I don't know how this could happen.\nMaybe @oklai can help shed the light on this issue.\nAnyway the next release of koala will soon be out, and this issue might already be resolved.\nCheers\n. Hi @ezmiller this is a duplicate of #70, please see this comment for a work around for this bug.\n. does this help?\n.

Hi @beldougie, \nCan you please give me an example project (the js files) that cause this unwanted behavior?\nAnd I'll try to fix it.\nCheers,\nZaygraveyard\n. Hi @bwente,\nYes I think its a node issue, try running node --version in the Terminal.\nCheers,\nZaygraveyard\n. I wanted to know if the command can be ran in the Terminal (which means node is installed in a directory included in the PATH environment variable).\nIf it is then this problem shouldn't happen.\nCheers\n. You can also try env node\n. This indeed means that node is in the correct path.\nTry running /usr/local/bin/lessc.\n. So I guess its a Koala issue, :(\nWhich version of Koala are you using?\nAnd how can I reproduce this problem?\nI'm on a Mac OS X 10.9, and I have node v0.10.16 and less 1.5.0\nCheers\n. Good news, I found the bug.\nBad news, I don't know how to kill it.\n. This bug is on every Mac yours and mine, and its as follows:\n1) On Mac when you lunch Koala, it gets lunched with the environment containing a PATH = \"/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\".\n2) Node.js gets installed in /usr/local/bin/node.\n3) Koala executes the lessc with the same environment.\n4) lessc is a node.js program which starts be #!/usr/bin/env node\n5) env can't find node\n. I found a quick fix:\n1) sudo nano /usr/local/bin/koala-lessc\n2) write:\n```\n!/bin/sh\n/usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/bin/lessc $@\n```\n3) sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/koala-lessc\n4) use usr/local/bin/koala-lessc as compiler path in Koala\nHope it help\nCheers\n. Hi everyone, \n@dannystyleart thanks for the great idea.\n@oklai we can use watchr to watch the files and node-glob/minimatch for globing and matching.\nI'll try to work on it as soon as I can.\nCheers\n. @Nightink thank you for this contribution.\nI'd like to add the link to the doc for grunt-node-webkit-builder.\nAnd if you can add an icon for the mac app, it be awesome.\nAnd I think we can't merge it to master so it be better if you could do the same changes in a separate branch.\nThanks again.\nCheers\n. Hi @Nightink,\nthanks again for your work, I merged manually into concepts/build-automation-using-grunt branch.\nAnd if @oklai agrees it can get merged into master.\nCheers\n. Hi @BethAr, the reason I started to work on this project (Koala), was because I wanted to add support for Dust. And we succeed in making Koala extensible which allows the addition of compilers, and with it the Dust Compiler.\nSadly I'm very busy these days, so I can't create a compiler for the demanded engines. But I hope you can help by creating the compilers.\nFor more info on how you can create a compiler to add support for a specific template engine you can check the wiki page on how to create a compiler extension.\nIf you need any help ask us and we'll be more than happy to help you.\nCheers\nPS: A Jade compiler should be fairly easy to implement, so I'll try to find some time to do it.\n. @gaberankin Did you try to close and reopen Koala?\nif nothing happens or what should happen does not, please let us know and if you could give us the extension (dropbox or github or anything) it will help a lot in finding and solving the issue.\nCheers\n. Hi @mistergraphx ,\nthe package you made contains a folder containing the files, and the package should contain directly the files.\nso on a mac you need to select all the files for the extension, and then control click and select compress.\nI hope this help.\nCheers\n. @mistergraphx @gaberankin \nGlade to help.\nIf you're creating an extension for Koala, It would be great if you could share it with the community.\nAnd if you decide to share (or you are sharing) your extension, you can give us the link to your extension so we can add them to the list of extension on the wiki.\nThank you all for you interest in creating extensions for Koala.\nCheers\n. @gaberankin Thank you for sharing.\nThe link has been added to the wiki List of compiler extensions.\nCheers\nPS. Thanks for the mention in your extension. :)\n. @BethAr can you try this Koala-Jade extension?\n. Thanks for the suggestion.\nNow waiting for @oklai to take a look at it.\nCheers\n. @oklai DEL or Backspace (for mac users) removes files and if none is selected removes the project.\nAs for renaming can RETURN be also used for mac users, 'cause on mac renaming is usually done with RETURN?\nCheers\n. @oklai check this commit 053fbb16213eaf5781d106f4ebb02734891db36c.\nI added F2 and RETURN (for mac) to start renaming and ESC to cancel renaming and RETURN to accept it.\nWhat do you think?\nCheers\n. @stockman the path needs to be absolute, so you should replace ~ with the path to your home dir (ex. /Users/your_user/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p545/bin/ruby. Is this still an issue in the latest version?. Hi @jsoucheray, this syntax is not yet supported by Koala, but, thanks to your suggestion, I going to add it.\nFor now you need to put each append/prepend on a separate line.\ne.g:\njs\n// @koala-prepend \"test.js\";\n// @koala-prepend \"test2.js\";\nCheers\n. Hi @zzguo28,\nThanks for your suggestion.\nBut we already discussed this idea in #62, more specifically starting from this comment.\nIf, after you saw the discussion, still have something to say, please feel free to let us know.\nCheers\n\nGoogle Translate:\n\u55e8@ zzguo28\uff0c \n\u611f\u8c22\u60a8\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002 \n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u8ba8\u8bba\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u60f3\u6cd5\u5728 #62\uff0c\u4ece \u672c \u8bc4\u8bba\u66f4\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\u3002 \n\u5982\u679c\uff0c\u4f60\u770b\u5230\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u540e\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u8bdd\u8981\u8bf4\uff0c\u8bf7\u968f\u65f6\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u4eec\u3002 \n\u5e72\u676f\n. Hi @ystarlongzi, \nThanks for the feedback. I like you idea, but I don't see where we can put this option. Any ideas?\nBTW, thanks for trying to write in english.\nCheers\n. Hi @vkovic,\nCheckout 67de1eb191f8594be50145868667e3b0f9b8d9d8\nCheers\n. @BarbzYHOOL it sure seams that way. Plugin?. Still an issue?. See #384. Added to the List of compiler extensions page.. @timfayz It appears @oklai mistook @debug for :debug_info.\nSo Koala doesn't have a way to see the @debug output \ud83d\ude1e . Merging with #367 . Fixed in the recent versions. Hello @illusionfield,\nStill interested in adding Koala to homebrew-cask?\nNow there is a direct download link for the dmg, will it work?\nThanks. Which OS are you using?. Sorry for the extremely late response (I hadn't seen this issue)\nKoala is not intended to be run from command line.\nBut an independent CLI app can be create for the @koala-prepend if needed.\nPersonally I find that its not needed since there are other alternatives like cat.. Still an issue?. Fixed in v2.2.0\nAlso duplicate of #621\nRef #384 for native notifications. Probably fixed, can you verify?. See http://osxdaily.com/2012/07/27/app-cant-be-opened-because-it-is-from-an-unidentified-developer/. Option added in v2.2.0. I think it can be done by using two build steps:\n1. style.scss -> style.css (no minification)\n2. style.css -> style.min.css (minification)\n. @ferbarra2207 which version was working fine?. @Mostomostomosto which version are you using ?. Still an issue?. Thank you!\n@oklai can we merge this?\n. Thank you!\n@oklai can we merge this?\n. Koala is not written in Ruby nor is it a Ruby gem.\nYou should just run koala. Thank you @JoseBarakat . Thank you!\n@oklai can we merge this?\n. I see that the only commit in this PR is also part of #494, so can we close this and deal with #494?\n. @ghost if you are using ubuntu try https://github.com/oklai/koala/wiki/Unable-to-run-Koala-in-Linux. Closing for now, please reopen if the problem persists. Hi @wykydtronik,\nSorry for now a file is compiled only once (one output compiled file).\nBut I see why you would need to have such a setup.\nWhy are the deployment and the repository different? And can't you just copy the files form one to the other?\n. @oklai Can we close this?\n. @philnickel Sorry it is not possible, and I don't know if it will ever be.\nKoala is a GUI front-end that uses other compilers.\nOn a remote server you could use the compilers directly.\nCurrently used compilers:\n- clean-css\n- coffee-script\n- less\n- uglify-js\n- Sass\n. @hellolee2 What do you mean \"can't turn to css correctly\"?\nWhich language are you using? LESS? SCSS?\nFYI calc() is a valid CSS function\n. Is this still an issue?. @tommaso-bissoli thanks for the update \ud83d\ude04 \nAnd sad to see you go \ud83d\ude22 . @WangYang-Rex Is this issue been resolved? Can we close it?\n. Still an issue?. Because it's not that easy, Koala does more that just run a command when a file changes.\nBut maybe in the future this might be possible (something like tup).. Do you mean having a notification on successful auto-compile?\nIf so it's already in place.. Ref #625 and #626. Sorry I don't think it's possible, Koala uses UglifyJS2 to minify the JS files and UglifyJS2 doesn't support ES2015 string templates (nor any ES2015 feature for that matter) :(. This project is not abandoned, but I don't know it's in development anymore\nBut I'll try to maintain it, and maybe one continue to develop it\n. > whether you maintain an alternative branch?\nI currently don't have an alternative branch\nI want to replace NW.js with electron, but unfortunately I don't have enough free time.\nI'll update this issue there are any changes.\n\nwhere can we keep up to date koala compiler?\n\nKoala is not a compiler, it uses known compilers\nSo compilers can be updated independently from Koala\nAs for the latest version of Koala, for now there are no new updates\nI hope this helped you\n. @Alecto If by compilers you mean lessc and sass, then you can simply install whatever version you want on your system and tell Koala to use it:\n1. Open the \"Settings\" of Koala\n2. Select the compiler section on the left (ex. LESS)\n3. In the \"Advanced Settings\" section on the right, check the \"Use the system .. compiler\" checkbox\n4. Enter the full path to the compiler in the field below the checkbox.\n. You probably already have Ruby installed, so I suggest verifying before install it.\nThan you need to install sass.\nAnd finally you can try to leave the path field empty (it will be set to sass by default), if it doesn't work then you need to find the full path to sass and put that (the path) in the field.\n. I'm glad it helped\n. @Alecto you are correct. I will try to update them soon and cut a release.\nUsually @oklai makes the releases (since I'm just a collaborator), but as he is no longer responding I'll try to do it.\n. I updated nwjs to the latest version and I'm working on creating a release (the packaging)\nOnce I successfully package it for Windows, OS X, and Linux I'll update the packages (LESS, SCSS, ...) and do a release. @RangerGH you only need to install Ruby if you want to install SCSS on your system. Koala includes a version of Ruby which is used to run SCSS without having to install it on the users system.\nBut @Alecto found that the version of SCSS included in Koala was old so I suggested that he installs the new version on his system independently from Koala and tell Koala to use it.. node-sass's CLI seams to be different from sass's.\nBut I wrote an adapter script that I think will allow it to work.\nNormally you would need save the script somewhere on your system and make it executable.\nThen tell Koala to use it.\nThis code is not tested\nLet me know if you find any problems.\n```bash\n!/bin/bash\nARGS=();\nscss=false;\nwhile [[ $# -gt 0 ]]\ndo\n    case \"$1\" in\n    --load-path)\n        ARGS+=(\"--include-path\");\n        break;\n        ;;\n    --require)\n        # not implemented in node-scss\n        break;\n        ;;\n    --style)\n        ARGS+=(\"--output-style\");\n        break;\n        ;;\n    --scss)\n        scss=true;\n        break;\n        ;;\n    --sourcemap=none)\n        break;\n        ;;\n    --sourcemap=)\n        ARGS+=(\"--source-map\");\n        break;\n        ;;\n    --debug-info|--line-numbers|--line-comments)\n        ARGS+=(\"--source-comments\");\n        break;\n        ;;\n    )\n        ARGS+=(\"$1\");\n        ;;\n    esac\n    shift;\ndone\nif [ \"$scss\" = false ];\nthen\n    ARGS+=(\"--indented-syntax\");\nfi\nexec node-sass \"$ARGS\"\n```. Sorry for the delay (I've been very busy) \ud83d\ude13 \nThe mac package is good to go, but I still need to test the windows package and the linux ones.\nI'll try to do it tomorrow and let you know.. I have successfully packaged Koala for Win 32bit, macOS 64bit, Debian 32/64bit, and RedHat 32/64bit (although I have not tested installing the \".rpm\" yet).\nI'll try to update the compilers tomorrow and do a release.. \ud83c\udf89 Koala 2.1.0 is here \ud83c\udf89 \nThank you all for sticking around \ud83d\ude04 \nI haven't had time to do thorough tests, so if anyone find problems or bug, please let me know \ud83d\ude05\nI'll try to update the website soon\nThe latest version of LESS is 2.7.2 (and 3.0.0-alpha.2) which has different API and CLI, I'll update it soon\nChanges:\n change the default value of maxBuffer #162\n support for AutoPrefix Config on CSS, LESS and Sass\n fix backslashes in map source paths on Windows\n update node-webkit to the latest version of nwjs\n* update LESS(@1.7.5), Sass(@3.4.23), Compass(@1.0.3), CoffeeScript(@1.12.4), uglify-js(@2.8.21), and clean-css(@4.0.10)\nDownload from:\n Windows\n macOS\n Linux 32 bit\n Linux 64 bit\n Debian 32 bit\n Debian 64 bit\n RPM 32 bit\n RPM 64 bit. > support for AutoPrefix Config on CSS, LESS and Sass\nI just copied it from a commit that was already on the master branch but after the v2.0.4 so it's possible that @oklai updated the app binary without creating a release.\n\nYou should create a github repository though (with a release section :) )\n\nFor now I'll update this repo, because the website is linked to this repo (plus all the issues are on this one).\nBut eventually I'll fork this project (I was thinking of doing it when I replace nwjs with electron)\nThank you for the support \ud83d\ude04 . I updated this repo \ud83d\ude04 \nAnd trying to update the website now\nBTW this version of Koala uses the same major version of LESS (1.x.x) so it's still the same LESS (at least for now \ud83d\ude09 ). Updated the website \ud83c\udf89 . Closing this issue because the answer, at least for now, is no it not abandoned (not by me that is).\nFeel free to reopen this issue if the question arises again.. I'll try to test it as soon as I can and let you know what I find\n. I just installed a fresh Ubuntu 16.04.1 - 64-bit in a VM (VirtualBox)\nAnd then installed ruby and the Koala version from koala-app.com\nAnd then followed the steps in https://github.com/oklai/koala/wiki/Unable-to-run-Koala-in-Linux\nAnd it worked!\n. @jzhang28 can we close issue?\n. @Peripona Does this help?\n. @Peripona it seams the error is originating from ModularJS/sass/base.scss, can you try adding @charset \"UTF-8\"; at the beginning of that file?\n. @Peripona any updates?\n.

Fixed in v2.2.0\nAlso duplicate of #621\nRef #384 for native notifications. Hi @LDSign \nThank you, I'm glad you like it \ud83d\ude04 \nCan you give me an example?\nI tried to compile LESS to compressed CSS, and it removed the comment.\n. Its not the /* comment */ that are not removed but the /*! comment */ (special comments)\nKoala uses cleancss as the CSS minifier/compressor.\nAnd in order to tell cleancss to remove these special comments we should pass it the --s0 option.\nAnd currently it's not possible to set this option in Koala.\nAs for the minified JS, Koala uses UglifyJS2, which has an option max-line-len:\n\nmax-line-len (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n\nWhich why there are several line breaks in the minified output.\n. For now they can't, but there needs to be a way for users specify any option they want (that's why I assign the label \"feature\" :wink:).\n. Tell Less to ignore calc: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16323310/how-can-i-instruct-less-to-ignore-math-for-certain-styles (or use the Strict Math option). Sorry I don't think it's possible (I didn't find any program/library that does it).\nYour best bet is to generate a diff of the CSS and apply them manually to the SASS.\n. Hello @talal424,\nThis might shed some light sass#1122\n. Hi @keizaiweb,\nCan you give me steps to reproduce this error?\nThank you\n. Thank you for the clarification\nCan we close this issue?. Hello @csuntitle,\nThis is a duplicate issue of #367 \nYou can check this comment on that issue for a workaround.\nI hope this helps.\n. Hi @mokorana, what can information can you give us?\nWhat did you try?\nWhat's happening?\nThank you\n. @jawadcode There is no need to post the same comment 10 times.\nYour request has been noted.\nI'm working on updating Koala so that I can add more compilers.\nBut for now, you need to wait a little.. @jawadcode It's ok, I understand what you are feeling.\nThere are lots of markdown flavors out there. Do you have a compiler in mind?. You can check this fantastic css-tricks article about markdown parsers.\nBut after looking at the JS options I think I like remarkable the most.. No not at all.\nI try to create a Koala plugin for that compiler.\nThe packages that can be added to Koala must be Koala plugins.. Is hamljs an acceptable compiler? (not as the tool you're asking for but to be added to Koala as a plugin). If you are interested in creating a Koala plugin, you want to take a look at this wiki page on how to create a compiler extension?.\nIf you have any questions please let me know :smile: . Not yet, currently Koala is built on nw.js.\nBut I'm planning on switching it to electron.. You don't need to know NW.js to develop an extension for Koala.\nCan at a look at the Dust compiler that I made when I first started working on Koala.. First I want to clarify that both electron and nw.js execute JS code using node.js the only deference between them is the added API related to the web part (window, HTML, ...)\nAs for the for your script, it had to work as a standalone script. Which is not the case in Koala.\nIn Koala you (as a compiler I mean) don't worry about finding the files you need to compile (HAML to HTML). You just worry about compiling a single file.\nTo do so you can either run JS code or execute a system command (anything that you can run in a terminal).\nI prefer if you use a JS compiler (like hamljs) but if you find that the haml command is better suited you can use it.\nIf you look in the Dust compiler, you will find a function named compileWithLib that will compile a single file using a JS module (or library hence the name of the function) and an other named compileWithCommand which will compile a single file using a shell command (again hence the name).. > As koala knows which file is being compiled?\nDid you mean \"How does Koala know which file to compile?\"?\nIf so, there are a few reasons why a file is compiled:\n It was just added and its marked to auto compile when added (category of the file is \"style\" or \"script\")\n It or one of its dependencies has changed and its marked to auto compile\n* The user manually asked to compile it\n\nWhat are the functions Which I recommend to modify to use haml ?\n\nAfter reviewing the code (it's been a long time since I worked on Koala), I saw that a compiler if only required to implement a single method compile(file, emitter).\n The file parameter is File object representing the file to compile\n The emitter parameter is an object with an emit method:\n    * you should call emitter.emit('fail') if the file could not be compiled (additionally you can call this.throwError(errorMessage, filePath) to an error notification)\n    * you should call emitter.emit('done') when the file has been compiled successfully\n    * you should call emitter.emit('always') after the compiler has finished successfully or otherwise\nThe File object has, among other things (the full list here):\n name which is the base name of the file\n src which is the full path of the file\n output which is the full path of the output file\n settings which is the settings used to compile this file\nI hope this helps\nIf you have any other questions please let me know.. hamljs does compile \".haml\" to \".html\"\nYou can use it like this:\n```js\nvar HAML = require('hamljs');\nvar options = {\n  // ...\n};\nHAML.renderFile('/path/to/file.haml', 'utf8', options, function(err, html) {\n  // save the html to a file using the nodejs \"fs\" module\n});\n```\nPS: I haven't tested this so it doesn't work let me know.. Still an issue?. Hello @lkeeney, I'm sorry to hear that\nI just downloaded Koala from http://koala-app.com and installed it in a windows vm\nTried to compile a .scss file and it worked.\nCan you describe what you tried?\nThank you. > I found the problem. The check box called \"Use The System Sass Compiler\" was checked. I unchecked this and it now works.\nGreat \ud83d\ude04\n\nDo you consult on all different web development problems?\n\nI'm the maintainer of this project (or at least trying to be) since @oklai (the author) is unreachable.\nSo if you have any problems using Koala, please let me know and I'll try to help.\nIf you mean in general and not just Koala, then I don't but I'm open for it you find my email address on my github profile page.\n\nDo I owe you for this contact?\n\nNo you don't\nCheers,\nZiad. I'm glad to hear that.\nNow can we close this issue? \ud83d\ude04 . What version of Koala are you using?\nDoes this happen every time you open Koala?\nThank you. You can try https://autoprefixer.github.io to see what is prefixed and what isn't.. Which download link?. The download links on the website all point to drive.google.com.\nCan you open https://drive.google.com ?. Thank you for sharing. Still relevant for v2.2.0?. @vbmade2000 does Koala v2.3.0 require this to run on Ubuntu and CentOS?. @vbmade2000 ok, thanks for sharing \ud83d\ude04 . Can you try to enable \"Strict Math\"?. @xiaoyexiang any updates?. Hi @yamlfd,\n@oklai was the one that created the windows install (as well as the packages for the other OSs).\nBut since he is no longer reachable, I started to trying to create the packages and installers then I got interrupted \ud83d\ude05.\nI would be interested in seeing how would one create such an MSI installer (preferably on macOS or linux)\nThank you. > It is also not multi-os capable.\nYes, each OS has it's own package.\n\nIf you are fine I would implement it and give it to the project to help your project.\n\nThat would be fantastic :smile:, thank you very much. I've recently released a new version of Koala.\nI would much appreciate it if you could give my an example of a simple install wix XML config.\nThank you :smile:  . @NuliNuli can you try the solution shown in #539 ?. @NuliNuli any updates? Did you solve the problem?. 1. What language are you using? CSS? LESS? SCSS?\n2. This is probably not a comment, but a syntax error (ignored by CSS engine).. In that case, you can try it in http://less2css.org/. Can you give me source code (LESS) that I use to reproduce the issue?. Did you find a solution?. I'm sad to hear that \ud83d\ude1f \nAnd do it work in prepos?\nCan you give me a snippet of LESS that will produce the error?\nThank you. What language are you using? LESS or SCSS?. Unfortunately the SCSS compiler doesn't support it \ud83d\ude1e . Koala uses UglifyJS internally, to see the result of UglifyJS you can use UglifyJS-online.\nIt looks like the option \"hoist_funs\" is true by default and for your case it needs to be false.\nUnfortunately, at the moment, there is no way to specify options for UglifyJS in Koala :disappointed: \nBTW, I would like to note that, unless this is a thirdparty code or you really need the function to be inside the if, it's a bad idea to put functions inside if bodies.. > But the issue that remains is code which was tested working correctly before minify is then broken after. Is there any warning or safeguards can be triggered in this case?\nUnfortunately UglifyJS does not provide warnings when hoisting functions.\nSo the only safeguards are your tests.. Closing as this falls outside the domain of Koala. I didn't find anything that indicates that this tool is available for offline use.\nAnd the same functionality is probably achievable using normal CSS minifiers.. Thank you for reporting this bug, I'll fix it ASAP. These links should work:\n Windows\n macOS\n Linux 32 bit\n Linux 64 bit\n Debian 32 bit\n Debian 64 bit. @SoYoureAWaffleMan thats because it is v2.0.4, I'm working on a fix for this bug.. You can download the previous version from the links here.\nCan you keep the new version aside for now,\nI'll check it out when I get home and I might need you to do some tests, if it's ok with you that is.\nThanks. It seams this issue is very similar to an issue in an electron app (electron-userland/electron-packager#323)\nCan anyone try to move the old version of the app to the trash (via the Finder) before installing the new version?\nThanks. Can you try this version?\nIf it works I'll do a proper release.\nThank you. Great thanks everyone :smile: \nI'll do a release tonight.\nFor anyone interested, the source of the problem was the latest version of nwjs (v0.22.0), by reverting to v0.21.6 the error is gone.\nI'll file a bug report when I get the time.. Can anyone verify that v2.1.2 still works?\nThanks. @xyboox Thank you \ud83d\ude04 \nI just wanted to make sure that this (the crash) is not happening\nbecause I restored the version of nwjs to the latest one\nbut I found out that for some weird reason when nw-builder downloads it automatically it crashes but not when I download it manually.. @xyboox Interesting, I'll look into it tonight.\nCan you open open a new issue for this problem?. @xyboox Thank you :smiley: . For reference the new issue is #608. Duplicate of #579 . Duplicate of #579 . I'm working on it, so hopefully before tonight. Duplicate of #579 . Thank you reporting it.\nI'll fix it ASAP.. @Bessonweb this is actually a different bug see #579 . Fixed by 9104be10c8aa2450dd445d962b5c3994d892035c. Thank you for reporting the problem.\nI will investigate it tonight.. Can anyone try this v2.1.2?. I'm assuming this was fixed.\nIf not please reopen this issue.. Merged into #652 . Is it the same as #580?. Duplicate of #580 . Thank you for reporting, I'll fix it ASAP. @xMrKrisx the issue you are experiencing is the one refereed to by #579.\nSorry for the inconvenience, I fixed this bug and will do a release tonight.\nIn the mean time anyone having this problem can downgrade back to v2.0.4.. Duplicate of #579. Does the new version (v2.1.1) have the same problem?. Any updates?. For anyone having this issue, try to quit Koala completely (make sure that there is no Koala tray icon)\nAnd then retry installing it. This might be related to #623 . Still an issue with v2.2.0?. Duplicate of #580 . Duplicate of #579 . Duplicate of #579 . What does it say?. I'll look into it. Are you on windows?. @sclovecds\n@oklai used to create the windows installer but now he is unreachable.\nAnd since I don't know how he created them, I had to start from scratch.\nI'll try to add the custom installation directory, and probably create an MSI.\nAs for the slow open on windows, I'm looking into it.\nSorry I didn't understand your before last point, can you clarify.. @Her-ero @walidream see #598 . @sclovecds Can you try this v2.1.2?. Merged with #598 . I'll look into it tonight. @sclovecds can you give me an example scss file that this happens on?. Can anyone try this v2.1.2?. @Neo-NMO See #607 . Hello @edudix, this issue is the same as #579\nAnd normally it was fixed in the version 2.1.1. Duplicate of #598\nLooking into it. Does this help?. Which version of Koala are you using?. This issue should normally be fixed in version 2.1.1\nIf you are experiencing this issue in that version please reopen this issue.. Sorry I had miss analyzed this issue, but the good news is that it has been fixed in v2.1.3 (soon to be released). Thank you for the info.\nDuplicate of #598 . Duplicate of #598 . @xMrKrisx it is true, but I'm close to finding one (the false directory issue is fixed but an other issue poped up and that the one I'm trying to fix)\nIt's taking me more time to find a solution 'cause I'm on a mac and I'm having to use a virtual windows machine (which slows down my whole system). @mrcoolbiz you downgraded to v2.0.4?. @stavros3006 the startup delay has been fixed and will be in the next release\nand as @timpowersdesgin pointed out the uninstaller is found in the Koala.exe's directory.. Can anyone try this v2.1.2?. @xMrKrisx v2.1.2 is currently still in pre-release mode so Koala doesn't notify of it's existence (and it's not on the website either).\nBut you can find it in the releases page of this repo or by following the link I gave.. @srcreative-steveporter Thanks\nSee #367 and #339 (this feature is next on the list). @Pulsahr yes please and thank you. @Pulsahr this is not an issue with Koala, SCSS files that contain UTF-8 characters require a @charset \"UTF-8\"; at the beginning of the file.. @englishextra \nsass requires it see sass/sass#1663\nThe original ruby sass is different than node-sass and Koala uses the original ruby sass.. @englishextra \nAfter more digging I found the encodings section in the SASS documentation.\nAnd it appears SASS will check the Ruby string encoding.\nSo I will force the Ruby string encoding to UTF-8 in the next version hopefully this will help.. Duplicate of #598 . Thank you for reporting this bug.. I'll do a release tonight.\nBut for now a workaround is to apply 60b001903048a00dd46bf12dbdf6bee937046ddc to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Koala\\app\\scripts\\compilers\\CssCompiler.js. I'll fix it tonight or tomorrow\nSo hang tight @CrixuAMG :wink: . Fixed in the new version v2.1.4. Which version are you using?. Duplicate of #611 . Sorry you are right it not the same issue :sweat_smile: \nWhich version are you using?. Great, new issue is #611 . Duplicate of #611 . Does NW.js have a virus?. Is this still valid for version v2.1.4?. ok thanks. Does NW.js have a trojan?. @timeceeper Does NW.js have it?. Can anyone please check NW.js\nkoala.exe is nwjs.exe with minor modifications so if nwjs is clean it means that the build system is the cause.\nThank you. Thank you @AleRob90 and @timeceeper, I'm looking into it. Can you try to replace koala.exe with nw.exe:\n1. Rename koala.exe to koala.exe.bak\n2. Copy nw.exe to the Koala dir\n3. Rename nw.exe to koala.exe\nThen try to run it.\nThanks. @timeceeper Thank you\nTo create koala.exe from nw.exe, I use winresourcer (which is a wrapper of Anolis Resourcer running via wine on my mac) to change the icon.\nI'll try to use rcedit to do the same this and see if the result is also marked as trojan.. @lifenstein I'm actually on a mac (and creating the packages on mac also) so I don't think it's machine is infecting the exe.\nBut I am going to try rcedit, maybe the problem is coming from winresourcer.. @lifenstein Yes it is improbable, at this time, (but not impossible) that a mac is infected with a virus.\nAnd even if it was I highly doubt it will infect a windows executable on my machine.\nCan you scan v2.1.0?\nv2.1.0, v2.1.2, and v2.1.3 uses nw.js v0.22.0\nv2.1.1 uses nw.js v0.21.6\nv2.1.3 uses nw.js v0.22.1. I think it's a problem with NW.js and a false positive.\nRelevant links:\n \"nw.exe\" on EMSISoft's Is this file safe\n nwjs/nw.js#4023. @lifenstein Thank you\nThat's interesting because v2.1.0 and v2.1.1 both where created with the zip option enabled, which means that all the resource files get bundled, zipped and concatenated to the original nw.exe (requiring a decompression on each lunch of the app resulting in a very slow lunch)\nIn the newer versions I disabled this option.. I tried to create the Koala.exe in a virtual Windows machine using Resource Hacker, the result got the same virus report as the original nw.exe\nSo the origin of this problem is probably wine\nI'll try fix wine, but in the mean time I'll use my virtual machine to create the executable.. This should be fixed in v2.2.0. @timeceeper does Windows Defender say why it's blocking it?. @timeceeper can you check the History page of Windows Defender?. @timeceeper and if you don't find anything in the History page, maybe there's something in the event logs\nThank you. @timeceeper it appears that the problem is not that Koala is infected but that its not signed, see this.. @timeceeper before v2.1.0 I don't know if they were signed, but starting with v2.1.0 they are not signed. . If you manually compile (by clicking on the compile button) the sass file, does the output css update?. Thank you for the detailed analysis.\nIs the \"Compass Mode\" checked on the scss file?. Try this:\n1. Go to the install dir of koala\n2. Apply this commit (manually). Forgot to mention you also need to restart Koala after the change (quit completely then open it). 1. In the same file you modified recently (SassCompiler.js), add alert(command); before the exec() call (line 150)\n2. Restart Koala\n3. Try to compile the SCSS file\n4. You will see an alert popup, copy it's contents\n5. Open cmd.exe (the terminal on windows)\n6. Paste the contents of the alert from earlier (to paste on cmd.exe right-click in and select \"Paste\")\nLet me know what happens. Fantastic :smile: \nI guess this will remain a mystery forever :wink:.. Which version are you using?. > File download always fails, can add a new download address.\nWhich link are you referring to?\n\nCan increase the ES6 syntax recognition, to avoid errors\n\nKoala uses UglifyJS2 so when uglify adds support for ES6 Koala will automatically have it.. Still an issue with v2.2.0?. @koosabang does it say which one?. Thanks @lifenstein, I'm closing this for now. Did you try to add @charset \"UTF-8\"; at the beginning of the file?\nI refuse to edit the sass gem, if you think this is a bug in sass you should file an issue on their project.\nI am aware that Koala is not Linux friendly and this will hopefully change once I replace NW.js with electron.\nI might try create an AUR package for Koala, but I have never don't it before so don't hold your breath.. Let me know if adding @charset fixed the problem.\nThanks. Fantastic :smile: . See #625 and #626 for progress on linux packages. Just found out that reatlat is maintaining a koala-bin AUR package \ud83d\ude04 \nThe readme should be updated with this fact.. Can you try again now?\nThanks. Thanks for reporting, I'll check it out tonight. @AlexKlaus80 ruby is not required, Koala has it's own copy of ruby bundled with it.. It seams that there was a problem with the binary I used to create Koala.\nI recreated the Koala and now it should work normally.\nI'm uploading the new KoalaSetup.exe\nI'll let you know when it's done.. All done, can anyone try it?. Great, thank you guys :smile: . Duplicate of #630 . Duplicate of #630 . Sorry this might be because of the translation but I didn't understand the problem you are facing.. I didn't forget\nI'll try to sign it but I am enrolled in the iOS developer program and not the mac one so I don't know if it will work. Can I see the file that caused it?. Are the files saved using UTF-8 encoding?. I'm glad it worked  \ud83d\ude04 . I'm assuming you are compiling a SASS/SCSS file, right?\nCan you make sure that all the files used in the compilation are UTF-8 encoded? . @szhbkw any updates?. Thank you @sergiodlopes.\nBut just to sure, you have all the files used in the compilation in UTF-8 (all included/imported files also), correct?\nCan you post the error message?\nCan you post a sample file that has the problem?\nThank you. @duodou Thank you, this in very interesting.\nAre you on windows too?. @szhbkw @sergiodlopes @nataly247 Any updates?. I highly doubt it's an infection on our side.\nOne thing that can explain this is that the installer deletes all the files in the install directory (the destination) before installing the app.\nIt does that to handle the case when the user is reinstalling Koala (e.g. to update it).\nDoes this explain what happened with you? . No but this is the line of the install script that is responsible.\nI'll try add a confirmation dialog for when the install dir already exists.. Fixed in v2.3.0. How did that happen \ud83d\ude15 ?\nCan you reinstall Koala?. Any updates?. Sorry @ajayrawat4217, I'll not implement this feature because I'm working on using native notifications which do not allow custom positioning.. It should already be possible.\nWhat OS are you on?. To see where output is saved you can right-click the LESS item in Koala and select \"Open output folder\", to change it you can select \"Set output path\" or click on the icon shown in the figure (red arrow)\nAnd the output path is shown is highlighted in the figure by the green underline.\n. @labradorconnect There is nothing attached \ud83d\ude1f . This is the correct output, variables.less contains only variable definitions and comments which don't generate any CSS.\nYou can try to compile LESS into CSS independently from Koala using the online tool less2css.. What are you expecting to get?. Any updates?. I can't reproduce it!\nCan you post a snippet?. Can you try selecting the file in Koala and in the side menu verifying that the \"Autoprefix\" is checked?\nThe ones in the picture is the setting that are the default settings that get overwritten by file settings. This is a bug in UglifyJS, see mishoo/UglifyJS2#2028\nAlso while test this I found another bug mishoo/UglifyJS2#2027. I will improve the error message so it more descriptive.. Improve the error message so it more descriptive in v2.3.0. The issues of this project are not the right place to learn coffeescript or  jquery.\nThat said, I'll try to help you if you can give me more information about what you are trying to do.. Can you try to replace each of the lines 74 and 197 of the file ...\\Koala\\app\\script\\compiles\\SassCompiler.js with command.push('-E UTF-8');?\nI don't know if it will fix the problem but it might.. Are you importing any third-party files in any of your files?\nIf so are they UTF-8 encoded?. Can you send me a file (as is not it's contents) that will cause this problem? (so I can reproduce it)\nAnd in the mean time you can remove both lines 74 and 197 of the file ...\\Koala\\app\\script\\compiles\\SassCompiler.js to fix the problem.\nOh and which OS are you using?\nThanks. Usually sending the contents of code file is equivalent to the file (because the code is just text).\nBut in this case I'm asking for the actual file.\nI think you can add it as attachment in the issues here, but it should be a .txt file otherwise Github wont accept it.. That would be great \ud83d\ude04, Thanks. @ArizonaInkStudios @hulkyuan Can you verify if its the same problem as @duodou or @UNICORNIOSDECOLORES?\nThank you\n. @chylex Sorry nothing yet but it's the next thing on my list.\nI'm on a mac and using a VM to run windows so it's a bit difficult for to work on this.\nAnd the handling of UTF-8 characters in paths on windows is awful.. @NelGarbuzova the other problem you faced is AFAIK a requirement for Compass. @lduhaut I don't know if it works but its worth trying:\n1. Create a link (using MKLINK in cmd) from your project(s) folder to somewhere safe (without unicode characters)\n2. Add the newly created link to Koala\nOr move your project(s) folder to somewhere safe and link it the other may around (from new path to old path). @lduhaut I don't think this folder is affected by this bug. It's just for the SCSS and Compass compilers. @lduhaut it seams you are right, as this line shows.. @lduhaut AIR, last time I checked this problem I found that there's something weird happening when nodejs execs a ruby command with non-ascii arguments.\nUnfortunately I don't have a windows but on hand to do more tests :disappointed: . Can anyone verify @lucas201's solution?. Can you try running NW.js to see if it works? (you can get it from here, use the normal version)\nThanks. In the mean time you can revert back to the 2.0.4 version.\nDownload links can be found in #579 (comment).. I afraid this means that the new version of NW.js (which Koala uses) no longer support Windows Server 2003r2 \ud83d\ude1e. There is no version 2.2.2 do you mean 2.2.0?. Does the file %USERPROFILE%/.koala/imports.json exist? and if so what's it's contents?\nThanks. Sorry, Github doesn't accept email attachments!. No its not.\nIt should be JSON!\nCan you quit Koala, delete the file, and restart Koala to see if the problem is fixed? . Great \ud83d\ude04 \nLet us know when you finish your tutorial \ud83d\ude04 . Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't WXSS exactly CSS with a .wxss file extension?. Merging in #652 . It is possible that ruby.exe and conhost.exe are related.\nAs to why, something must have triggered a compile of a lot SCSS files (add a project folder to Koala or an autocompile was triggered).. What was your previous version?. How long has it been approximately since the last time you updated? more than 3 months?\nThanks. Then it was probably v2.0.4. BTW you can revert back to the previous version, while I try to fix it. . Merging in #639 \nPlease can you try to reinstall Koala?. Can you give an example?. Closing since it seams unrelated to Koala. Can you try to:\n1. Quit Koala\n2. Delete ~/Library/Application Support/Koala/UserData/imports.json\n3. Lunch Koala. @brubie any updates?. Great, thanks. This is similar to #639\n@jenerse can you try to reinstall Koala?. @jenerse can you let me know if it works.\nThanks. Thanks for reporting this.\nBut, unfortunately, I was unable to reproduce it!\nBTW eval is evil and you shouldn't use it unless absolutely necessary, and in your case it isn't:\njs\nif (HXWebDynamicPage != null && HXWebDynamicPage._Internal != null)\n{\n  fnEventHandlerFunc = HXWebDynamicPage._Internal['_OnHXPage' + strFuncBaseName];\n  if (fnEventHandlerFunc != null) {\n    fnEventHandlerFunc(arrHanlderCode.slice(1).join(\".\"), evt);\n  }\n}.

Sorry for the delay.\nI think I fixed the problem\nI'll cut a new release tonight. Can anyone verify that this is fixed in v2.3.0?. Fantastic, thank you @PAULUSfranCIRCUS. Koala v2.3.0 should work out-of-the-box, without having to run anything (unless you are using a custom command in the settings)\nIf it's not the case please let me know.. @harrycb if you are use using Grunt then you probably not using Koala.\nThis a thread for Koala.\nUnless you updated Koala and now experiencing this problem, please don't comment on this issue.

According to a scan on VirusTotal.com, the Koala installer is clean (except when check with MalwarePatrol).\nSo you could tell Windows Defender to ignore it.\nMaybe this will help.. It's probably a false positive.\nI highly doubt that there's a trojan in the installer, since I created it using an off-the-shelf NSIS compiler and simple NSIS install script.. I scanned all versions of KoalaSetup.exe from v2.0.4 to v2.3.0 with VirusTotal and found them all to have the same result (1 / 66) with MalwarePatrol being the only AV to flag it as Malicious.\nSo probably aa false positive on the part of MalwarePatrol.. @Jaded-Design's concerns are being discussed in #732 and #718 . *:root and :root are equivalent so you actually need to add the *\nAnd BTW it's not Koala that's making this change but the compiler LESS, SASS or clean-css (whichever you are using)..

Great \ud83d\udc4d \nThanks for sharing the solution \ud83d\ude04 \nClosing since it's resolved.. Hi @brasileric,\nKoala can handle files with names starting with an underscore just fine, just chooses to ignore them \ud83d\ude05 \nI don't know why it does, but this is the line responsible and the commit that first introduced it:\nhttps://github.com/oklai/koala/commit/aa72bfd387b16cc646e578cfac6561956a3076b2#diff-cfca341a52018d3931bc2743fa173023R309\nI think it has to do with files with names starting with underscore being partials in SASS or Compass!\nI'll try to fix it soon.\nUnfortunately I'll be on my Xmas vacation starting tonight so it won't be before the end of next week \ud83d\ude25. Related to #137 . If you are using compass see https://stackoverflow.com/a/11745813/2168921\nOtherwise it's not currently possible but can be add to Kaola in the future (more details on how in https://stackoverflow.com/a/8038592/2168921)\nBut for a quick patch, you can add the following line to https://github.com/oklai/koala/blob/master/src/app/scripts/compilers/SassCompiler.js#L146 which can be found at C:\\Program Files\\Koala\\app\\scripts\\compilers\\SassCompiler.js (or something similar):\njs\nargv.push('--precision=5');. @Lakro is correct about the customOptions (I don't know how I missed this \ud83d\ude05) but looking at the code that handles it indicates that it should be as:\nThe recommended way:\n\"customOptions\": [\n    \"--precision\", \"6\"\n],\nAnother way:\n\"customOptions\": [\n    \"--precision 6\"\n],\nAnd again, looking at the code indicates that this will only work for SASS but a config.rb solution exists for Compass.\nIt would be good to have a confirmation if this works or not.. @danielocdh Thank you for sharing.\nI'll try to fix this ASAP.. I apologize but I don't understand what you're asking.\nBut this might be relevant https://github.com/oklai/koala/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AUTF-8. @Jaded-Design is referring to #732\nAs for this being a \"Chinese\" software, I can assure you, it is not. Although the author @oklai is Chinese, there are a few points I would like add:\n1. Koala is 100% open source so anyone is free to analyze the code and look for security issues\n2. The author is no-longer maintaining this project, so I stepped in because someone had to.\n3. In @Jaded-Design's issue he mentioned that he's using v2.0.4 which was packaged by @oklai so it's \ntheoretically possible that it wasn't \"clean\", but starting for v2.1.0 I started packaging it and I documented the process so anyone can do it.\nAs for the OP, sorry I don't have a windows box so I can't test it. But it's possible that the CPU usage you are seeing comes with the chromium inherited baggage (since Koala uses NW.js which itself uses chromium).. Sorry kind of a known issue (https://github.com/oklai/koala/labels/UTF-8).\nBut no solution yet, I'll work on it ASAP. This is not currently supported\nBut it's good idea. Is this the first time you install Koala on your machine?. Can you delete %USERPROFILE%\\.koala and try again?. Does %USERPROFILE%\\.koala exist and is not empty?\nIf so, can you paste the contents of %USERPROFILE%\\.koala\\settings.json here?. Sorry normally removing %USERPROFILE%\\.koala, uninstalling Koala using the uninstaller (D:\\Program Files\\Koala\\Uninstall Koala.exe), then reinstalling it should fix the problem.\nIf it doesn't then I don't what could be causing these errors \ud83d\ude1e . You can try running Koala as administrator. What is your download speed?. Fantastic \ud83d\ude04 . Yes Koala ships with LESS v1.7.5, but this will change soon (if find the time to update Koala). Which macOS version?. I'll test on the latest version of macOS tonight.\n@zeewelc all the config/perfs are saved in ~/Library/Application Support/Koala. Duplicate of #726 . It's not a problem with Koala but with the SASS compiler, I tried it on codepen and I get the same result!\nI don't use SCSS so I don't know if we are doing something wrong \ud83d\ude1f . I found the culprit, in v3.5.0 the way CSS variables are handled has changed\nSince in Koala v2.3.0 the Sass compiler has been updated to v3.5.2, you need to do something like:\n$backgroundColor: #fff;\n:root {\n  color: $backgroundColor;\n  --backgroundColor: #{$backgroundColor};\n  --backgroundTransparentColor: #{transparentize($backgroundColor, 0.2)};\n }\nAs for installing a custom Sass compiler, it is possible as long as it has the same CLI (Command Line Interface) and you would have to install ruby too. In the Koala's settings you can specify the path to the sass executable to be used.. This is real scary indeed. But before we jump into conclusions, @Jaded-Design:\n Have you installed a custom compiler plugin?\n Is any of you projects or files on the network? (the usage your showing us is labeled Ethernet which includes local traffic not just internet)\n* Can you update to the latest version of Koala (v2.3.0)?\nKoala only uses the internet for checking for updates, which happens once on startup.. @alicex0error2 What do you mean same issue?\nDoes Koala communicate over the internet when it shouldn't have?\n@Jaded-Design Didn't say that an antivirus blocked it, why did yours block it?. Koala v2.3.0 uses UglifyJS 3.1.9\nAnd UglifyJS 3 by default doesn't care about IE8, but you can enable it using the ie8 flags.\nYou can try it out here (You only need to set output.ie8 to true).\nIn Koala setting custom options for Uglify is not currently possible, sorry (see #703). I understand and I'm not saying you should drop support for them.\nI was just explaining the situation.\nI hope I can find time to add support for specifying custom options soon.\nUnless you or someone else can submit a PR, in which case I'd be happy to review and merge it \ud83d\ude04 . ~/Library/Application Support/Koala/UserData/. Only the latest version of Koala is supported, so you should update to it.\nAnd if this problem happens again please reopen this issue.. Thank you for this detailed description of the issue and your tests.\nI'll try to reproduce it and get back with my findings.. You can try deleting %USERPROFILE%/.koala/settings.json. @brettr91 thank you. Thank you for this info, I feel it's very valuable. What do you mean?\nIs it a bug report?\nIs it a feature request?. What are you using, LESS or SCSS?. This is actually an issue with the SCSS compiler, not Koala, see https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/818. Koala is not a LESS compiler, it uses the official LESS compiler\nYour example is not valid LESS, try it online. Prefixes are added (I think) but not for flex because of the browser list autoprefix is using.\nYou change the list in the project settings, see the property autoprefixConfig example in koala-config-of-less.json.. Duplicate of #740?\nYou can try deleting %USERPROFILE%/.koala/settings.json. I'm glad it helped :smile: . Can you try: \"requireLibs\": [\"sass-json-vars\"], ?. Can you try installing sass-json-vars with gem install -i \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Koala\\rubygems\" sass-json-vars?. Fantastic \ud83d\ude04 . Try #476. When you close Koala, it's not quit but minimized to the tray icons (on bottom right). Thank you for the info\nI'll check it out when I get the chance. That's the first time I see those, does it work?. The \"line comments\" option is translated to \"--line-comments\" when passed to the sass compiler, which enables the line numbers option.\n\nWhen set to true, causes the line number and file where a selector is defined to be emitted into the compiled CSS as a comment. Useful for debugging, especially when using imports and mixins. This option may also be called :line_comments. Automatically disabled when using the :compressed output style or the :debug_info/:trace_selectors options.. I hope to work on new versions but currently, I don't have a lot of free time on my hands\nSince I don't use Koala anymore (I use command line tools) and the original author has probably abandoned this project, the development kind of stopped (unfortunately) \ud83d\ude13 \n\nBut if anyone wants to help maintain Koala I'll be more than welcoming \ud83d\ude04 . His latest activity online (that I can find) dates from 2017\nBut the domain koala-app.com's registration has last been updated in December of 2018\nSo I don't know what's going on\nI don't know what I can do, but I know what I tried to do\nI'm a collaborator so I can:\n push to all branches\n edit and close issues and PRs\n create new releases\n update the website (which is in a specific branch of this repo)\nAnd can't:\n edit the repo's settings (probably including adding new collaborators)\n manage the domain koala-app.com\n\nIf not it would be better to create an org with teams and create the next version there for easier maintenance with others.\n\nIt definitely would be, and I was thinking of creating a fork (kind of) with maybe a different name (since I don't know if we can use the same name) and it would be a complete rewrite that uses electron probably.\nAnd I would probably need some colaborators willing to help since I don't know when I'll have enough time to work on it\nAll ideas are welcome. It's in the tray icons section of your taskbar. I mean like #360 \nIs this your case?. Any updates?. You can replace @koala-append ... with @-koala-append ....

I like this concept of compressing all the images, css and javascript. That'll be really handy. For image compression look into http://kraken.io\nKraken is known for having the really good image compression, although I believe there is a size limit for uploads which could cause an issue.\nAs for the remote directory/ftp sync, it's a good idea but might not be useful for everyone, e.g. I use Git and SVN for my projects but that doesn't mean I'd want any new features instantly being committed to my repository as they are just a work in progress.\n. @zaygraveyard\nThe Microsoft ajax minifier technically is Windows only but it could be ported to work for linux and mac.\nI did not notice the 50 images per day part for Kraken.io, I don't really use it unless I really need images to be compressed.\n@oklai\nNice list of compression software there, glad to see this will be implemented!\n.

It made my life easier and better :)\n. Hey, oklai!\nSince I can't speak (and even read) chinese language I don't know what have you discussed before, so sorry if I'm repeating a request.\nI love the prepend and append features but I'm missing the pre-/append function by pattern. So linking files by * wildcards.\nIt would be very nice if we could use prepend like //@ koala-prepend \"myfolder/*.controller.js\" for example. Same about the append function.\nFor the last I would say a huge thanks for this app, I love to work with it.\n. Hi @oklai \nThis feature could done in grunt.js but grunt has no ui and always have to create a whole config by typing. I know there's some complicating aspect in this case like exclusions and so on...\nBut here's why do I'd like this feature:\nMy javascripts are mainly in a folder structure for example:\n/...\n/config - inside some config javascripts\n/controllers - inside controller javascripts\n/classes - inside some classes\n/mixins - inside some mixins\n/vendor - inside some js libs or scripts from other sources\nAnd I'm using js files that contains only the pre/append rules, and I'm compiling only these files to the needed location.\n/koala.config.js\n/koala.controllers.js\n/koala.classes.js\n/koala.mixins.js\n/koala.vendors.js\nIt would be very nice if I just could make only one koala.js where I could use pre/append rules with wildcards like:\n//@prepend \"vendor/.js\"\n//@prepend \"config/.js\"\n//@prepend \"controllers/*.js\"\n....\nAnd koala would get each js files recursively. If you have a long coffeetime you might add a feature  to order the files by some aspects and the ordering direction DESC or ASC...\nI hope you'll like and add this feature to js. Also I'm looking for the image compression feature.\nIf these could be done. This tool would be the best tool in 2014 for the webdevelopers.\n. Hi all,\nHope this feature will be there soon :)\n. ",

No more copying files into every new site.\"\n. yes i'm already doing that, \nit could be great if we could do the same with js files : import functionality (for helpers function) and include_path in project settings.\nAlso, the include_path could be added to ~/.koala folder once for all. \n. nice !\n. should i create an other issue for the import functionality for js files ?\n. i used to think that i would prefer //@codekit-prepend and //@codekit-append as i can keep compatibility with my collegues working with kodekit \nbut these names //@codekit-preppend and //@codekit-append are not really generic.\nthe best may be to use //@koala-append, as we can put the two lines together and codekit will simply ignore the //@koala-append statement, and koala will ignore the //@codekit-append statement.\nor it could be something else, it's open ...\n. ok great ! i'm really happy with that, thank you :)\nit's not that i don't like @import, i think it could be confusing.\n. @zaygraveyard ha ha ! \ni know js css html and graphics, but never try node.js, and don't know jade, i'll check these two.\ni know english and i am french :)\nyes it could be cool to contribute to koala ! \n. Hi,\nPrepend and append allow to \"copy/past\" some extra code from external file only at the begining or at the end of the current file (like helpers functions or libraries). So i think that the real question is : do we need to import some code in the middle of the current code ? Maybe but a it's not a usual practice with js, is it ? I think the prepend and append are safer than include/import (at any place).\n. Codekit allows to import at the beging of the file (with //@codekit-prepend) OR at the end (with //@codekit-append) but actualy i can't remember if i already use the append one ...\nWe should keep the two options, just like jquery $.prepend() and $.append(). Is it realy more work ?\n. great ! \ncarefull it's prepEnd and appEnd.\nis it possible to have a minification which keep the lines return (for debuging purpose ) ?\n. hello,\nthanks again for koala, i'm using it every days !\nmabe i missed something : in koala-config.json i can give the path to \"frame works\" with \"include_paths\" propertie, and it works with @import for less.\nBut it does'nt work for js @koala-prepend or @koala-append, is it ? i really misse it.\ncheers\n. @oklai ok done. please see my pull request\n. hi,\naccording to this post https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/light-table-discussion/B-slal7KX5o\nkoala 2.0.0 start normaly after i removed ~/.koala\nmaybe the issue is similar\n1- Create a project\n2- Open LightTable\n3- Add the project to your workspace\n4- Close LightTable\n5- Delete the project from disk\n6- Try to reopen LightTable (BUG!)\n. thank you for the trick !\n. sorry to reopen this one but the trick does not work any ore for me, javascript doesn't auto compile anymore. \nI realy need that not for compression but for prepend feature // @koala-prepend \"your.js\"\n. hi @oklai,\nthanks for your reply, but i already did that of course, and now my less files are not auto compiling neither :(\nwhat can i give you as information to help to find the probleme\ni'm on linux\n. ok i deleted the project and re-imported it and now js and less autocompile works again\n.

I've misunderstood you. Yes @oklai that would be great \n. +1\n. +1\n. @oklai \n. @oklai When do you want to support this \"bug\"? It is essencial when developing big projects.\n. Thanks. I will test it\n. Can you please write us here when the fix is released? I've just tested it with the latest release and it doesn't seem to work.\n. Seems still not working with deep includes and using include paths\n. @clemorphy Dafuq, how old are you?\n. IMHO source maps should be also available for all files in a directory recursively. For example if I have a .scss file inside /somedir/subdir/ and another /somedir/subdirtwo/ I currently would have to add two mappings. This should not be necessary.\n. reinstall it. if that does not help install it on another PC and check if the same error appears with your projects. If so, please post again.\n. Notice: The mapping-option in koala is no solution, because I would have to add one mapping-object for each module (subdirectory). So I am searching a way to achieve this recursively. As a example I only want to define a output directory just for a complete project inclusive subdirectories.\n. Try rightclick on \"SCSS\" and rename the project!\n. Push\n. I know this is not very beautiful but since the developer thinks this is not so important to work on it, this is the only workaround:\nGo to the directory where the .koala-folder is saved locally (C:\\Users\\YourName). Open a CMD and type in:\nmklink .koala [YOUR PATH] /D\nThis will create a symlink to the portable koala installation (e.g. on a USB).\n. Just recompile the source file which includes all nested files manually\n. I can confirm that Koala will not recognize each @import in nested files! Maybe some one will take on and work on it!\n. I just want to make the bug clear: After the second level of @import Koala will ignore changes. Also if two files import the same file the recompile will only be triggered at once.\nIMHO this should be fixed asap!\n. Speak english!\n. Duplicate oft https://github.com/oklai/koala/issues/105#issuecomment-59326221\n. Yes, that is true, the action synchronisation is not includeet with LiveReload. But I don't think it is a task for Koala, since it is launching on a desktop.\n. speak english please\n. I want to make sure that this a important bug since you have to add the copyright manually to each file. This is the opposite of automation..\n. Will you add this option to the GUI?\n. Thanks\n. Push!!!\n. @oklai\n. Please speak english so that other people can also comment...!\n. english please\n. Rightclick on the project in Koala and \"reload configuration\"\n. Do not click on the assets, click on the project name\n. Ok. Well, that is the only way I know.  @oklai do you know something more?\n. @oklai\n. @oklai\n. Well since this features is supported not long ago it would be great to define a custom Regex for copyrights in projects. I for example have a lot of projects realized in combination with Koala. But I don't use the copyright structe @preserver or @license. So to be backward compatible it would be great to have the possibility to define the copyright regex in the configuration of each project. @oklai what do you think?\n. Or allow to define the parameter defined here:\nhttps://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2#keeping-copyright-notices-or-other-comments\n.

If it's all grayed out, you need to click the little lock on the bottom left corner to change this.\nAlternatively, if you don't want to change your preferences, and want to do it for this app only: \n1.In the Finder, locate the app you want to open (don\u2019t use Launchpad to do this)\n2.Press the Control key, then click the app icon.\n3.Choose Open from the shortcut menu.\n4.Click Open.\nThe app is saved as an exception to your security settings, and you will be able to open it in the future by double-clicking it, just like any registered app.\nThis is beyond Koala's control.\n.

    "fvsch": "I don't understand why tools such as Koala (including Prepros, LiveReload, and probably others) default to compiling files unless you uncheck them or exclude them or import them.\nOn the CSS side, a typical project has one main stylesheet (Less, Sass, etc.) importing a few or sometimes dozens of \"partials\" or \"module stylesheets\". When you default to compiling everything you can, you end up with lots of false positives, compilation errors, etc.\nMaybe that's helpful for people new to preprocessors, but if you know what you're doing you don't want your tools making those kind of decisions automatically.\n. That's a Less, problem, not a Koala problem.\nLess cannot substract pixels from percentages, since it doesn't know how many pixels is \"100%\" or how much in percentage is \"40px\" (this is bound to be different depending on the viewport width in many cases, by the way).\nYou have two options:\n1. Write your styles differently altogether (are you just trying to add 20px margins on each side of an element, for instance?).\n2. Use the browser's built-in calc function, in which case you don't want Less to process calc(100% - 40px), you want it to output it as-is.\nBrowser support for calc: http://caniuse.com/#search=calc\nTell Less to ignore calc: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16323310/how-can-i-instruct-less-to-ignore-math-for-certain-styles (or use the Strict Math option)\n. We'd be interested in libsass support as well.

But Koala is far easier to set up and I'd like to continue using it on older projects. My guess is that you need to have SASS installed along with AutoPrefixer before selecting that option would work. Ain't tried it though. \n. I'm thinking that if one does a gem install sass and gem install autoprefixer and then selects the Use the system SASS compiler checkbox, that this could work. I don't have time to try it right now. Does someone?\n\n. The autoprefixer is not working for me at all even after \"gem install autoprefixer-rails\" (which installed) and adding \"requireLibs\": [\"autoprefixer-rails\"] in koala-config.json (The later spits an error saying file not found)\n. It is possible.\n- In your koala-config.json file of your project, make sure to adjust the part as follows:\njson\n    // Add the ignore rules that Koala will not search them.\n    // e.g. [\"*.json\", \"*.txt\", \"test\", \"path/libs\"]\n    \"ignores\": [\"*.css\"],\nIf you have .css in the ignores property, remove it:\n\"ignores\": []\n- Then open Koala app.\n\n- Click the edit icon to change the Save as path and file name.\n- Click the CSS tab.\n- Adjust the following settings to your preference. Be sure to keep Auto compile checked.\n\nThat should do it for you I hope.\n. Hi AnaCamelo,\nI can't say exactly why that problem has arisen, but you can try some few troubleshooting tips to get you much closer to the particular file or line that causes it.\n\nThere should be a file from where you include all the other LESS files, right? Comment out all but one of your LESS includes in that file and then compile.\nFor each LESS file that compiles successfully without errors, uncomment another file and compile.\nKeep uncommenting and compiling until you will get to a file that will cause the errors.\nOnce you pinpoint the particular file spewing those errors, Proceed to comment our huge blocks of code within that file and uncomment block by block as you compile.\nYou will eventually get down to the block or line of code that is causing the problem.\n\nThis is exactly what I would do in your shoes since I can't tell by looking at the errors (after of course I've googled the matter and no one has a solution already existing).\nI wish you luck in fixing this issue.. Okay, good to know you figured it out. :) \n. Real scary stuff. What version of Koala are you using? I suggest you downgrade to v2.0.4. No hitches there.. @zaygraveyard is right. Every traffic on your local dev machine could be routed via Ethernet depending on how your network is configured. In fact, this would be the case even if you turned off your internet. I in fact suggest you do that and then see if the usage stats continue to ramp up despite internet turned off. The way my own dev environment is configured, I don't even use Ethernet at all.\nIf problems persist, I suggest you use an app like IOBit Uninstaller to clean uninstall Koala App. Then restart your system and check if the problem persist, (perhaps the rogue app doing this has found another app to latch onto and abuse).\nThen re-install Koala App and continue using it and then see if the problem returns. If it does return to Koala, heck, switch to Grunt or Gulp or Prepros. . ",

Everything got added and everything auto-compiled.\nHaving the default to auto-compile is beyond annoying, especially when starting a project can only be done by importing an entire folder!\n. You need to upgrade your server and network, or stop abusing this software with \"auto compile\"\nEvery one of your computers has your server locally mounted.  Auto-compile requires each machine constantly checking the files and looking for updates, then reading all the files and writing new ones.

I have now managed to get scout running which has no such issues (thought your javascript has to be in correct location on PC, a whole different story :-)), I also found that koala only triggers files when they are two deep max, scout will trigger compiles at whatever level your partial includes are edited.

Mmm right now I'm learning electron and I do not know what decision to take is to say: 1-Learn NW.js and do the extension for HAML or 2-Finish to learn electron and try to do it with it.. Previously I developed a script to compile HAML and SASS but from python, I used the Ruby geml from Ruby and from the script I look for all files with .haml extension that are inside the directory where the script is executed, after having all the Files I proceed to execute the following command from the terminal in my linux case: haml index.haml index.html where index.haml is the uncompleted file and index.html is the ready file. That is the logic I use in my python script I do not know if it is the same with nw.js.. Now if I understand the operation of koala and the compilers I have been investigating some things and I realized that it is not so difficult to do, now I only have some doubts as they are: As koala knows which file is being compiled?, What are the functions Which I recommend to modify to use haml ?, as I realize what are the things that I must change, osea you told me that you do not have to learn nw.js to create the extension but there are certain functions and reserved words which I do not understand so that are used. I have already investigated how to use the hamljs of node I just have to add it as dependency and create the respective functions that will use the library but I do not understand the part of how I should interact with the compiler that uses koala.. I have already managed to understand 85% the operation of the compilation extensions, I learned from the dust-compiler and the jade-compiler I have put to look at the code and I understand how it works, now my problem is the following: it happens that hamljs Is used to compile js files with haml syntax towards a common html file, but what i actually need is to convert the .haml files to .html i have managed to do using the ruby haml gem but i have not found any npm libraries ..

    "zaros": "I think it's arguable if the function should be in the if block or not -- in this case the developer in my team had some good reasons, but it became a bug in our app due to this unexpected behaviour.  Of course now that we know, it's something we would avoid in the future, and we should also test more rigorously post-minify.\nBut the issue that remains is code which was tested working correctly before minify is then broken after. Is there any warning or safeguards can be triggered in this case?. Have updated the JSFiddle with output from UglifyJS-online as third test. As @zaygraveyard  wrote, if hoist_funs is false, it will work as expected.. I guess at the end of the day it's going to be a debate whether UglifyJS is correct to hoist functions within if blocks like this.   \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n. ",

    "ArizonaInkStudios": "Unfortunately no.\nI tried compiling via right-click.\nI tried compiling via the compile button.\nI even deleted all the contents of the output file and compiled with no luck.\nAre there logs I can look at to help out better figure out what is going on?\nI am on Windows 10.. I have tried version 2.1.4 and I am seeing the same issue.\nI am using a recently already used project that I was using on 2.0.4.\nI had the idea of removing the files and re-adding them. I do not want to do this for all my files in the project, but I will if I have to. I removed one just for a test and after adding it back it still will not output.\nI also now know that the output issue is only occurring with scss files. I tried this with my js files in the project and they work just fine.\nI added a very simple scss file with only one statement and attempted to compile and it errored.\nI should mention I did this from an install as an \"upgrade\". In other words, I installed 2.1.4 right over 2.0.4 without uninstalling. Note, when I go back to 2.0.4, I do not uninstall either and it works fine.\nAfter a clean uninstall of 2.1.4 and ensuring all previous versions were gone and uninstalled as well. After doing a clean install I still get this behavior. It says it compiles successfully but nothing happens in the output file.\nWhat else can I try to help diagnose this issue?. No. Only auto compile and prefix are checked.. I will do so and let you know!. Unfortunately that did not change the behavior.. Ok so this is the most bizarre crazy software bug ever! I have done all of those things you suggested and first off the alert did not do anything. I am not really sure why, but true story nonetheless.\nAs to the weird part of this. I received some windows updates recently and my machine rebooted. Guess what? Version 2.1.4 works without issue. Without the added force argument. I do not know why. I do not understand why a reboot would have helped, but alas it did.\nThank you for all your time and for this GREAT awesome software. I am sorry for making you scratch your head over a bug that was not a bug. But good news, nothing to fix!? LOL. I guess reboot really is the answer? :laughing:. I also did not do a full install I just did an upgrade. Just wanted to make sure you had all the information.. I changed both of those lines and still received the same error.\nI have tried multiple files and even changed the file encoding inside of IntelliJ to make the files UTF-8 encoded; alas, none has worked.\nI then opened one of the files in Notepad++ and forced the encoding there to be UTF-8, even though that file was already showing as UTF-8 (I resaved it to be sure), and still I get the same error.\nWhat else can I do for you? I am willing to help out in anyway possible.. I am not. The only thing imported into my scss files are other scss I wrote. No third party injection at all.. It also was NOT an issue on the previous version I was using.. I will remove those lines and see what happens.\nI am not sure what you mean by as is, but I can send you a file.\nI am on Windows 10, developing with IntelliJ.. Oh I am with you. Ok, I will do that. I will use the actual file instead of the file from bitbucket just in case something happens in the conversion.\nIn fact, I will put my local copy AND my bitbucket copy so you can test with both; not that it will matter, but it is at least another road to eliminate.. This is my local copy.\nstyle.txt\n. That was the same issue I was having before I put in your temp fix. My files were all local and had nothing to do with a shared drive. I am still unsure how the error is occurring as IntelliJ is setting the encoding to UTF-8; I even verified that with Notepad++.\nRegardless, I did use your temp fix and I am using 2.2.0 flawlessly.. I would also like to point out that I am having the issue from path 'C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\project\\scss'.\nI have no non-ascii characters and I have no filenames that include non-ascii characters. The only non-alphabetical character is the hyphen in my filenames. For example, 'page-one.scss'.\nI hope that helps in the continued troubleshooting.\nI am going to upgrade to 2.3.0 and see if I have any issues. If I do, I will apply the original fix that was given to me by removing both lines 74 and 197 of the file ...\\Koala\\app\\script\\compiles\\SassCompiler.js to fix the problem. I will let everyone know of my outcome.. With the upgrade to 2.3.0 I am still receiving the same error:\nArgumentError: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8\nUse --trace for backtrace. After commenting out lines 74 and 197 of '...\\Koala\\app\\scripts\\compilers\\SassCompiler.js' I am now working without issue.\nI hope this helps, but doubtful as this is the same outcome as the when this bug was opened.\nLet me know if I can help!.

Maybe something here?\nAnyway, I can successfully use it on other stations :). Hi @luabfr \nYes the problem in my case is for sure the \u00ef letter.\nThe thing is that Lo\u00efc is my username, and this folder is managed by windows, so I cannot (/ don't know how to) modify it easily. I tried changing my windows username, but it kept the old folder name.\nSo my only option there would be to create another account and switch between to use Koala... a bit to much for me!\nI'll pick my window username more carefully next time :). @zaygraveyard thanks for the command, didn't know about it.\nHowever, in my case, my project is not under C:\\Users\\Lo\u00efc. What I said is that I think Koala is storing things under the user profile (that is C:\\Users\\Lo\u00efc.koala folder). \nSo is there any way to configure Koala not to use the user profile folder (If this is the issue, because all these are assumptions for now). @zaygraveyard My problem is about SCSS compiler. In the first time, I placed my project under C:\\Users\\Lo\u00efc\\myproject, hit the scss compile button, and had the same exact error message (that is : \nC:\\Users\\Lo\u00efc\\myproject\\css\\style.scss\nArgumentError: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8\nUse --trace for backtrace\n)\nThen I tried to move my project under C:\\test, and still have the same error : \nC:\\test\\myproject\\css\\style.scss\nArgumentError: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8\nUse --trace for backtrace\nSo having the same error, I looked where I could have special characters related to Koala, and only found this folder : C:\\Users\\Lo\u00efc.koala (which has an empty 'compilers' folder). So, now way that this is linked?\nIs there any place where logs are generated, so I could be sure it is not? And if not, you might want me to create a separate issue?\n. Just to complete my previous post, I just tried to: \n- create another window account, with 'loduhaut' as a nickname, instead of 'Lo\u00efc'\n- On this account, use the same exact installation, add the same exact project under C:\\test, and hit compile\n-> works fine.\nSo I can't tell if this is the same issue, but I conclude there is a compiling issue linked to the user profile path under windows.\nTo go further, I did compare the contents of C:\\Users\\Lo\u00efc.koala\\ and C:\\Users\\loduhaut.koala\\\nAnd in the latter, there is a imports.json file that is generated, and that does not exist in the first one. There is also a new 'cache' folder in the second case.\nSo it looks like, on the scss compilation, Koala tries to create these files, and is not able to (probably because of the \u00ef char of this path).\nWhat do you think?. @zaygraveyard \nSo adding something like \nif (!fs.existsSync(exports.userCacheDir)) {\n    fs.mkdirSync(exports.userCacheDir);\n} \nin FileManager.js might be enough for my case?\n(I'm trying to reproduce it locally, but for now struggling to have ruby and all gems correctly installed ...)\nEdit: No, as I already tested adding it manually. It's only a proof it uses this folder.. @zaygraveyard I successfully ran it from the sources. However, the command with the special character works well in source mode ...\nC:\\test\\koala\\src\\ruby\\bin\\ruby -E UTF-8:UTF-8 -S \"C:\\test\\koala\\src\\bin\\sass\" \"C:\\test\\myproject\\css\\style.scss\" \"C:\\test\\myproject\\css\\style.css\" --load-path \"C:\\test\\myproject\\css\" --style nested --cache-location \"C:\\Users\\Lo\u00efc.koala\\cache.sass-cache\"\nSo, not able to reproduce :/. @zaygraveyard \n\nUnfortunately I don't have a windows but on hand to do more tests \ud83d\ude1e\n\nIf there's something I can do to help ...\nAlternatively, would it be possible to check another custom environment variable (i.e. KOALAUSERDATA or something)? If exists, use it, else use the system ones? That's not pretty, but that would prove the origin of this problem, and allow a workaround for people who cannot easily change their username. ",

I just discovered Koala has been sending/receiving roughly 900kbps non-stop everyday... In the last month I discovered it had used over 405 GB of data... No idea what it is sending or where it is sending it to - but I wonder if your processor workload is related. \nMy biggest concern is that this app is being used maliciously to send sensitive data or something else sinister. That would explain both the obscene network usage as well as the increase in CPU use as that would be needed to compress the data before it is sent... \nHate to jump to conclusions but something seems really fishy with this app and of course it is essentially a \"Chinese\" software package - which I didn't realize when I started using it. \nPersonally, I am going to go find another program to use to compile my SASS. \nI wouldn't touch this thing with a 10 foot pole now. . @PhilipsEkuma Actually, I am using v2.0.4 - I've updated my post with the version as well. .

It works! Thank you!. ",
