    "maxogden": "I recommend https://github.com/mafintosh/prebuild for the binaries part, it even has a feature to upload the binaries to GitHub Releases for you\n. ",
    "rgbkrk": "Awesome. Do you think I should just create a zmq-prebuilt for now, similar to electron-prebuilt?\n. Seems like I'll need Electron support in prebuild: https://github.com/mafintosh/prebuild/issues/61\nFor now I've submitted a PR to zmq relying on node-pre-gyp (https://github.com/JustinTulloss/zeromq.node/pull/486), now that node-pre-gyp supports Electron directly. \n. Now that zmq-prebuilt exists (though not finished), yes!\n. Re-opening until we fully resolve this for nteract/nteract. We made a release with a built binary for some platforms, yet it requires that you still have zmq headers installed.\n. Current pre-built status:\n\n. and so it is, we must trudge these waters of electron builds for the future of all of us\n. @lgeiger has totally demolished this issue - from incredible cross-platform work in zmq-prebuilt, to creating zmq-static, and upstream fixes in zeromq.node.\nWe even have Windows builds now. \ud83d\ude04 \ud83d\ude31 \nClosing this issue with much appreciation.\n. Leave a deprecation notice in zmq-static, pointing to zmq-prebuilt. You apparently stirred a little bit of buzz by creating zmq-static, and if people found that over zmq-prebuilt we should at least do the service of redirecting it.\n. One way to \"deprecate\" while being backwards compatible is to make zmq-static's index.js be:\njs\nmodule.exports = require('zmq-prebuilt')\n(while also noting they should use zmq-prebuilt instead)\n. Ah, ok, that works.\n. As part of this, we'll want to make sure we adhere to the way that Jupyter paths work across kernels (so users can install others). This is the reason jupyter-paths exists for node - we'll need to make sure this adheres to the right spec (it was ported directly from the original Python).\n. > Can you run Electron apps inside Docker?\nElectron is a desktop application framework. It can launch Docker things. What are you wondering about with regards to Electron and Docker?\n. > I assume you are referring to things like ipywidgets and nbextensions with this statement?\nYup. The entire diaspora of crazy fun. @jdfreder and @sylvaincorlay recently adapted ipywidgets to work outside the notebook for these cases.\n. Probably worth noting this will not include nbextensions in their current form, especially those that are Python based.\n. I'm going to close this one now that there's an embedded roadmap in the README + a series of issues to scope some of this out.\n. Related: https://github.com/nteract/composition/issues/9\n. Other questions:\nWhere is a user's workspace?\nWhen you launch a kernel, is it relative to the save path of the notebook? \nStoring last session\nWe'll probably want to store data to the jupyter config directory. You can get this via:\njavascript\nrequire('jupyter-paths').configDirs()\n. :boom: We're done here\n. Delegating the Python kernel bundling to another issue.\n. Closing, deferring to #1067.\n. The first was done by #101 \n. We're now in a state of running notebooks in individual windows. Native menus for selecting documents, just like other apps.\n. Well, I'm thinking more about if we have a workspace view like the notebook does. When you open the notebook, there's a dashboard view with all your files (relative to where the notebook was opened)\nHome folder is an easy choice to just get started, unless they opened it from the command line.\n. cwd is currently set to be the location of the file itself\n. Interesting problem I just realized on creating a new notebook. Steps:\n1. Create new notebook (kernel cwd now defaults to process)\n2. Save notebook somewhere other than cwd\n3. Re-open, and the kernel is in a new spot\nIt's a bit late so I'm not sure I conveyed that well.\n. Notebooks now get saved... where you save them with the dialog.\n. We're currently missing the prompts\nIn[0]:\n. Closing this, moving the math to a new issue.\n. Markdown isn't rendered above, though that's not a big deal here.\n. Deferring to #1067 for this. React handles most of our XSS bits.\nWe do need to watch out for what our Markdown renderer does.\n. Also made the simplified version at https://github.com/rgbkrk/nbschema that doesn't enforce any particular validator (there were too many options and I couldn't decide on an interface).\n. Now that commutable exists, we can move discussion over there. Conversion from disk format --> in-memory format is done, as well as loading and saving.\n. With our switch to consistency with commutable, we'll rely on that and make sure we keep it consistent internally.\n. With this last one, I think it's time to extract the display area out into a well tested React component.\n. :boom: It's green! :boom:\n. Build fail is unrelated (fixed in #28). Merging.\n. Verified this is good to go with a fresh install and can be run with either electron . or npm run start.\n. This keeps us at the ABI for the current v5.x release.\nNode 5.x:\n```\n$ node\n\nprocess.versions.modules\n'47'\n$ node --version\nv5.1.0\n```\n\nIn Electron:\n\n. Closing, since this will now be tracked in https://github.com/nteract/react-jupyter-display-area/issues/1, under react-jupyter-display-area.\n. Doing this in commutable.\n. I'll circle back on this one later or let someone else tackle it.\n. While I was at it, moved commutable to nteract.\n. \n. Something I don't think I've put anywhere else, though is currently in the implementation.\nWe only support code and markdown cells. No raw nbconvert and certainly no headings (those are deprecated anyways). Cut down on complexities of the original notebook UI.\n. I'll put the \"running\" indication in a new issue.\n. Closed since we have the draggable cells now thanks to @jdfreder \n. Went ahead and cached both node_modules and electron-prebuilt to speed up builds.\n. Done in #108 \n. Now I recall that @willwhitney already broke this out into a package in jupyter kernel launcher. Have at it, work with it, submit patches, ship it.\n. Split this into two issues:\n- Node packages for launching them\n- UI for selecting a kernel for launch\n. Done.\n. :shipit:\n. Since we're going to be relying on Rx for kernel messaging, it's ok if we scrap this and expose the right parts there.\n. :shipit: Thanks @kenwheeler!\n. We've now got this as part of the design in mocks:\n\n. Done in #183 \n. I'm assuming you ran npm install first?\nAlso... I see PipBoy in your errors, did you clone this one or robcoindustries/pipboy?\n. Oh ha, nevermind. I see it in the package.json...\n. Can you share your npm install output?\n. That did at least cause me to address #52. Thanks!\n. Closing, leaving it to be a research area and collaboration with nbdime.. Had no idea what email to use with TODO group's, used my own. If anyone else in the org would like to be added in as a potential contact, please add yourself in a follow up PR!\n. Need mocks for this!\n. At the very least we have the kernel name. If we want the logo again later we can revisit it.\n. I knew as soon as I introduced zmq into composition I would want zmq-prebuilt ready for us...\n. Alright, @kenwheeler and @knowbody let me know what you think here.\n. You know, caching the built zmq in Travis may be ok...\n. I must be missing some fundamental Hot and Cold Observables stuff here. When passing these new channel subjects around, if I subscribe on them and use onNext nothing. Yet if I assign them to window while in debug mode, later when I rely on them in other code they just work\n. The channels get created over here by the way:\nhttps://github.com/nteract/enchannel-zmq-backend/blob/master/src/subjection.js\nAlso noting that Ben Lesh had some feedback here (about the same code): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34845778/create-an-rx-subject-using-subject-create-that-allows-onnext-without-subscriptio/34862286#34862286\n. Closing this to implement it again with the current arch.\n. Nice mini-tutorial/how-to for Releasing for Windows.\n. Makes sense. We can package just the main app right now and rely on Jupyter kernels being installed. It would not be hard (or so I assume) to package ijavascript as a \"bundled\" kernel.\n. This has since been done. Updating the top to reflect what we've done.\nFor auto-update, we'll want to hook into squirrel.\n. Animated GIF of colaboratory in action:\n\n. Here's an iteration based on feedback from Kayur and Colaboratory's design:\n\nCells not hovered over or active are flush on the page. That's the first cell you see here.\nThe second cell is hovered over and is raised slightly.\nThe last cell is the active one and raised the highest.\nContext is king. Next up, the cell context menu.\n. Cell context menu, shown when active in a cell:\n\nThat's Play, move cell up, move cell down, and delete.\nWhen a Markdown cell I'd expect it to not have a run button, though it doesn't really hurt anything.\n. Little bit smaller icons:\n\n. In case it's not clear from above, those icons are totally from Font Awesome. :smile:\n. \n. Fonts are the same fonts currently bundled with Composition:\n- Source Code Pro\n- Source Sans Pro\n. Lowered the blur a bit on the context menu:\n\n. Now with input numbering!\n\n. Ah, the grey comes from all the current notebook variants. Are you thinking full screen document?\n. \n. Closing now that we have the UI mocks repo\n. One approach for sanitization: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/192\n. We've now got this as the notebook preview package!\n. This should probably be incorporated as a new nteract project.\n. - packaged-python\n- prepack-python3-kernel\n- prepackaged-python3\n- packernel\nYeah I'm not sure. Seems like something we can be somewhat verbose in naming, since it's solely a vehicle for install by nteract.\n. @ssanderson totally said he has the best ideas for doing this.\n. Closing, tracking progress in snakestagram.. That makes me wonder if you have to be logged in. I just switched to a fresh node version with a fresh clone and the install went fine for me. Trying again in a Docker container.\n. Well, that worked too. Time for me to check out the log you posted. Thanks for being thorough.\n. Doing some digging, I see that others report a similar thing when their connection is slow: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/11169 I'll see about limiting my bandwidth to attempt to reproduce. Update: Comcast is awesome, limited my connection to \"why would I do this to myself levels\" and still had no troubles.\nPossible workaround: try to npm install @reactivex/rxjs directly. We're using the scoped module to get all the module types: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reactivex/rxjs#all-module-types-cjses6amdtypescript-via-npm\nYou're already on npm3, so I haven't suggested trying npm install @reactivex/rxjs@5.0.0-beta.1. That's worth a shot as well.\nThanks for your patience, hopefully we'll make the developer experience better through this. :smile:\n. Another thing to try based on a comment on npm/npm:\n\nI'm going to guess that this is caused by your login credentials being stale or otherwise incorrect. Run npm login again, and if that doesn't work, move $HOME/.npmrc out of the way and run npm login again.\n. :tada:\n. It would be awesome if you add that suggestion to the README as an alternative/troubleshooting thing.\n. Thanks @phfrohring!\n\nWe follow C4.1, so we're really happy to welcome you to the nteract party! :tada: Would you like to join as a maintainer, following the C4.1 contract?\n. Thank you @phfrohring and no problem at all.\n. Exciting! This is because we introduced our core binary dependency in #69 (which happened after the first install issue of the day :wink:)\nHere are some instructions we should port over: https://github.com/nteract/enchannel-zmq-backend#zeromq-dependency\nIf you're using homebrew on your Mac, brew install pkg-config zeromq. You may run into other node-gyp fun times.\nLong term solution: prebuilt versions of zmq for everyone: #1 \n. This should be going ok now and upstream work is ongoing for zmq and node (as well as the zmq-prebuilt library that @minrk has been working on). Feel free to re-open if you run into more troubles.\n. /cc @kenwheeler \n. Done in #75.\n. Tests pass locally and the channels are all set up for me.\n. The Travis error is from nvm stalling out, I think we can ignore it.\n. Glaring omissions (on purpose, for scope):\n- Keyboards\n- Layouts (e.g. languages that flow right to left)\n. Since I wasn't sure myself, I looked up the definitions and difference between localization and internationalization.\n\nLocalization refers to the adaptation of a product, application or document content to meet the language, cultural and other requirements of a specific target market (a locale).\nInternationalization is the design and development of a product, application or document content that enables easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language.\n. Here at least we're not using webpack (yet), and we have access to the full file system (since it's an Electron app).\n\nI'd love to find out what a common practice is for the messaging, hopefully finding some example JS apps that do this well.\nThanks for showing how easy the initial \"rtl\" setting is! I really hope we can make this work well for both layouts by default. What's the expectation for how the input cells and output area appears in right to left mode? Are code blocks still left to right? The markdown/text is simple since that should be rtl, love to see a mockup of what you expect.\n. Usage:\n```\nimport { createExecuteRequest } from './api/messaging';\nconst msg = createExecuteRequest('print(3)');\nshell.subscribe(console.log);\niopub.subscribe(console.log);\nshell.next(msg);\n``\n. Tests pass locally,nvm` is stalling out again.\n. Of note: something is munging up the channels/subjects, resulting in non-fun Rx errors:\n\n. sayyyyy what??!?!?!?\n. That's crazy.\nBy the way, I did this direct with zmq and jmp (no RxJS) and it worked just fine. Sample script:\n``` javascript\nconst jmp = require('jmp');\nconst uuid = require('uuid');\nconst spawnteract = require('spawnteract');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst IOPUB = 'iopub';\nconst SHELL = 'shell';\nconst DEALER = 'dealer';\nconst SUB = 'sub';\nconst MESSAGE_EVENT = 'message';\nconst ZMQType = {\n  frontend: {\n    iopub: SUB,\n    stdin: DEALER,\n    shell: DEALER,\n    control: DEALER,\n  },\n};\nconst session = uuid.v4();\nfunction createMessage(msg_type) {\n  const username = process.env.LOGNAME || process.env.USER ||\n                   process.env.LNAME || process.env.USERNAME;\n  return {\n    header: {\n      username,\n      session,\n      msg_type,\n      msg_id: uuid.v4(),\n      date: new Date(),\n      version: '5.0',\n    },\n    metadata: {},\n    parent_header: {},\n    content: {},\n  };\n}\nfunction createExecuteRequest(code) {\n  const executeRequest = createMessage('execute_request');\n  executeRequest.content = {\n    code,\n    silent: false,\n    store_history: true,\n    user_expressions: {},\n    allow_stdin: false,\n    stop_on_error: false,\n  };\n  return executeRequest;\n}\nfunction formConnectionString(config, channel) {\n  const portDelimiter = config.transport === 'tcp' ? ':' : '-';\n  const port = config[channel + '_port'];\n  if (! port) {\n    throw new Error(Port not found for channel \"${channel}\");\n  }\n  return ${config.transport}://${config.ip}${portDelimiter}${port};\n}\nfunction createSocket(channel, identity, config) {\n  const zmqType = ZMQType.frontend[channel];\n  const scheme = config.signature_scheme.slice('hmac-'.length);\n  const socket = new jmp.Socket(zmqType, scheme, config.key);\n  socket.identity = identity;\n  socket.connect(formConnectionString(config, channel));\n  return socket;\n}\nfunction main() {\n  spawnteract.launch('python3').then(kernel => {\n    const config = kernel.config;\n    function cleanup() {\n      kernel.spawn.kill();\n      fs.unlink(kernel.connectionFile);\n    }\n    process.on('exit', cleanup);\n    process.on('SIGINT', cleanup);\n    const identity = uuid.v4();\n    const iopubSocket = createSocket(IOPUB, identity, config);\n    const shellSocket = createSocket(SHELL, identity, config);\n    iopubSocket.on(MESSAGE_EVENT, (msg) => {\n      console.log(msg);\n    });\n    shellSocket.on(MESSAGE_EVENT, (msg) => {\n      console.log(msg);\n    });\nconst msg = createExecuteRequest('print(2+2)');\nshellSocket.send(new jmp.Message(msg));\n\n});\n}\nmain();\n```\n. Well derpy derp.\nIf I change\niopubSocket.on(MESSAGE_EVENT, (msg) => {\n      console.log(msg);\n    });\nto\niopubSocket.on(MESSAGE_EVENT, console.log)\nthen I get the Illegal Invocation error. Chalk that up to poor bounding on my part. Since it worked in node yet not in Chromium, this really confused me. Thanks for the help @jdfreder.\n. annnnd I'm not alone:\nhttps://gist.github.com/euank/7523581\n. Great idea, glad you looked over at what Atom did.\n. What do you think about Atom's CompositeDisposable?\n. inspired by https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/command-registry.coffee\n. Since Travis hasn't been happy with nvm, here's the locally run tests:\n```\n$ npm t\n\ncomposition@0.0.1 test /Users/kyle6475/code/src/github.com/nteract/composition\nelectron-mocha --renderer --compilers js:babel-core/register 'test/*/.@(js|jsx)'\n\ncommands\n    registerCommand\n  \u2713 registers a command\n\n  \u2713 does not allow overwrite\n\n  \u2713 accepts metadata\n\n  \u2713 checks validity of the command\nunregisterCommand\n\n  \u2713 removes a command\n\n  \u2713 is case sensitive\n\n  \u2713 does not error if a command does not exist\nget\n\n  \u2713 gets a command\n\n  \u2713 is case sensitive\n\n  \u2713 returns undefined for commands that do not exist\ninvoke\n\n  \u2713 invokes a command\n\n  \u2713 is case sensitive\n\n  \u2713 does not fail if a command does not exist\n\nNotebook\n\u2713 accepts an Immutable.List of cells (79ms)\n\ncreateStore\n\u2713 sets up our store model\n\n15 passing (229ms)\n```\nTempted to set up strider for us.\n. Closing for now, will be coming back to this again while leaving my branch to look over it again.\n. Taking a step back here, we need to draft up some mocks and specs for creating new cells in general.\nHow does a user create a cell in between two cells?\nFor a mouse based flow, the way colaboratory did it in the past was a hover between cells:\n\nwhile also having buttons for adding text and code in the toolbar\n\nIn fact, the whole toolbar is trimmed down:\n\nThat can be refined further of course, I'm only posting those as prior examples.\nThe current notebook has a single button for add (+), which you then have to toggle to make it a text cell.\n\nOnce you round out that workflow, does default become more simple? Maybe not all the way.\nAs for that one, I'm imagining a menu item that flows like:\nCell\n  Default Cell \u27a1 [x] Code\n                 [ ] Markdown\n. I still like the idea of this.\n. What do you think about this now, given where we're at as well as our current UI?\nI'm noticing myself just click the \"new markdown\" cell on the cell creator toolbar really fast to get new markdown cells.\n. How would someone go about implementing this? What would you want to see for config/menus, UX flow?\n. We currently use a model of \"Whatever the last cell type was is the next cell type\" when using shift-enter or repeatedly holding down in the notebook. Would you say this suffices or should we still have a configurable default?. IIRC, what it seemed like we got to was that our current actions were roughly equivalent to the command palette and that the command palette would be built upon our central actions.\n. I definitely see how we can rely on some of this with a web based version too, straddling similar actions. Don't activate on coding or designing for that yet, just a thought.\n. Weird that the first menu item is Electron here (on Mac at least):\n\n. > Really what we need here is an action that displays an open dialog and then invokes readJSON for the user selected path.\n\nIt's important to note that with the menu, only actions that accept 0 parameters can be invoked!\n\nohhhh, so the action needs to be one that triggers the open dialog and then results in reading the notebook\n. Yeah, that's cool. I'm stating it as an understanding mostly for myself and others to know what follow on PRs for other actions needs to be.\n. Looking awesome. I've merged nteract/react-jupyter-display-area#4, are you currently linking? We can make a patch release on react-jupyter-display-area - I've also added you on npm for it.\n. Commenting on this makes me realize that a cell should have it's prop be the actual cell data. If cell is passed in (looking at Notebook.jsx), then the executionCount is at cell.get('execution_count') when its a code cell.\n. I definitely agree with this one, I'm frequently getting tripped up by it.\n. ```\n$ npm t\n\ncomposition@0.0.1 test /Users/kyle6475/code/src/github.com/nteract/composition\nelectron-mocha --renderer --compilers js:babel-core/register 'test/*/.@(js|jsx)'\n\nNotebook\n\u2713 accepts an Immutable.List of cells (73ms)\n\ncreateStore\n\u2713 sets up our store model\n\n2 passing (182ms)\n```\n. I'd like to follow this one up with removing the need for an index (some sort of ref to a cell). Not sure how to do that, but I think it will lead to less asynchronous errors (what if a cell is in flight and does an update?)\n. > So during save/load we'd strip/add these ref guids?\nWe'd have some way to go from our internal structure to the disk format. The current way to do it is to take the immutable.js notebook structure and run toJS(). We'd keep the API simple on the outside for our own contributor experience.\nAs for the internal structure, I'm not sure yet. When a cell gets new data (outputs, source/input, execution_count), the action we're aiming for is saying \"this cell has updated\" and all we have right now is the index that was supplied to the cell. It's tempting to use a uuid for each cell and map between the list of cells and the current cell version:\n``` javascript\nnotebook = {\n  cells: [id1, id2, id3, id4],\n  ...\n}\ncells = {\n  id1: cell1,\n  id2: cell2,\n  ...\n}\n```\nThis seems like it's adding indirection rather than solving the root problem. A cell still needs to know its ID (which could also be the key prop). This at least clarifies that the notebook is maintaining the ordering of cells while the cells map is able to track state of the individual cells over time. We have to maintain two data structures with this.\n. I've taken Travis down for now, going to start investigating Strider for our workflow.\n. Now that zmq-prebuilt is out, I can't wait to re-enable Travis. :smile: \n. Super done by @jdfreder, complete with zmq artifact caching.\n. Alright, let's charge ahead with nteract/nteract!\n.

Great reasons to use MathJax, I definitely agree with you. KaTeX also doesn't get as much development as it used to while still not quite there. We should definitely do mathjax in the same way as the notebook.\n. Since @lgeiger created mathjax-electron and @jdfreder did #443  we can call this one closed.\n. \n. Yeah our cleanup isn't fully happening right now, leaving the connection files around.\n. The awkward part here is the difference between OS X and all the others. cmd-q should tell each running window to close their kernel (which means ipc) or we'd have to track the kernels on the main thread to shut them down there (what if the BrowserWindow is no longer responding).\n. Ok, I've noticed that beforeunload and unload events are both fired when you ctrl-c kill an application, as well as the rest of the quit action. What we're definitely running into though is that we've been relying on an asynchronous flow for killing the kernel. When these two are triggered, we need to handle them immediately.\n. Basically we can't (and shouldn't) rely on dispatch for killing a kernel for forced lifecycle events. Otherwise our dispatched kill kernel won't happen because the reduction won't happen until the next tick.\n. I'll be posting UPDATE_CELL_OUTPUTS later.\nI almost turned this all into only UPDATE_CELL, accepting the fully changed cell, then it occurred to me. A single change being propagated through will be simpler for handling changes during multi-user contexts (that would be changing state as well).\n. Alright, we now have basic execution running. Lots of missing things here: detecting the status change to busy followed by idle, updating the input numbering, etc. Many of these can be brought over from ick pretty easily.\n. One thing I'm not sure of for fixing - shift-enter currently causes a newline. I'm not sure how to prevent that yet.\n. @jdfreder tested your language switching!\n\n. > Let me check this out...\n:eyes:\n. Haven't tried yet! I expected fixing that to be tricky enough that I didn't want it tangled in this PR. If it's as simple as you say, then a follow on PR should be pretty quick.\nLittle iterations over time to refine towards the experience we want.\n. Super awesome, thanks @captainsafia and @kenwheeler\n. Awesome.\n. I'm all about being pragmatic, this sounds like the best choice. :+1: to the refactor and setting it in a style guide.\n. OMFG, while trying to fix this I'm finally seeing the case insensitivity issues on OS X. wat.\nAnyway, fix coming.\n. Ha! The biggest one.\n. I also avoided changing the CSS for the \"composition theme\". I leave that as an exercise to the reader.\n. ha, of course this has conflicts now\n. I'll just re-open\n. This one was going to drive me crazy if it wasn't implemented.\nIt's worth having a look over our data path after this. Some of this duplication may be easier to encapsulate into reductions on a cell which reflect into reductions on the notebook state. shrug\n. \ntap tap tappity tap, hold that key down\n. Ruh roh. We need this fixed today. This breaks master for anyone installing since the version is the same to npm between beta-1 and beta-2.\nFound it out while helping @philpl get his dev environment set up. o___O\n@freeman-lab @andrewosh - I was leaving this one in case you wanted to tackle it, I'm going to go ahead and fix it though.\n. https://github.com/andischerer/atom-keyboard-localization#this-package-tries-to-fill-the-gap-till-the-following-issues-are-fixed\n. Great! What was the problem you ran into?\n. Hmmm, might be seeing something else needing some reflection:\n\n. :+1: \n. Since we have the main catch in index.html now, as well as the provider component from Redux I think we're in good shape here. Closing.\n. shift-enter runs and creates a new cell\n. Now that cells are referencable by ID, I think I'll be able to move the asynchronous code execution out. :+1: \n. This is all wrapped up and has been for a while.\n. Technically, we could pass them in to the dispatch function since they're part of context. That may be what I do here to make this simplified.\n. What's it like if I dispatch while in a dispatch? I realize I need that here too (looking at the code cell component right now).\n. At least for now, the code running is now in an action. @kenwheeler suggested creating a services layer to replace this.\n. What I'd like to do after this is figure out how we can handle not having to pass dispatch or channels in here.\n. This makes it easier for follow on actions that use the kernels like completion, doc requests, etc. while muddying what the story is for our redux-like store.\n. Should we be viewing actions as UI triggers?\nWhen a new kernel is loaded, how do we update that service?\n. Yeah I think we can move forward with making services. We have a lot of unanswered questions there.\nAt the very least, this is no longer coupled to the cell and people can start iterating on some of the other interactions with the kernels.\n. Ah, here we go! We can control this directly on our BrowserWindow: https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/web-contents.md#event-will-navigate\n. That is an impressive shattering of the cube. We can certainly pick something more sane on startup, like a fixed image.\n. > (This is actually a little less cool than it should be as it should be returning a random image each time)\nHa, I wondered so I reloaded the page. Maybe cached?\n. Oh, the link shows me a github URL. GitHub proxies image loads.\n. I think GitHub does it for privacy reasons, to not expose referring host and URL path (within private repos especially).\n. Solid idea, I like the daily tip. Quick to load and show.\n. It can be fun and quirky like the startup messages in Slack.\n. This is all set, albeit with our newer animated logo. :smile:\n. I like the Atom status bar too.\n. If you want fancy graphics (kernel logos), I'm guessing you're better off with something DOM/React based.\n. Gutter made this awesome. Closing.\n. Closes #130, as best as I can for now.\n. CodeMirror hints\n. Being done in #318 \n. Done in #318. Thank you so much @Carreau. \ud83d\ude04 \n. Nice! I look forward to using this.\n. Before I opened this PR for viewing I had hoped the drop target would be a region in between cells. Then I read and wondered how the IDs would work, afraid of using them. At the very end when handling the state update, it came out very clean. Well done!\nWe should probably handle the case where one of the IDs doesn't exist, resulting in no changes.\n. \n. /cc @jdfreder \n. This should come down to setting the draggable section to be the sidebar (left on code cells at least).\n. /cc @kenwheeler \n. :tada: \n. Amusingly, I used the horse from React DnD first. I thought this handled arbitrary DOM nodes for rendering, it didn't like my <pre> block. :wink: Now it's a simple PNG of our input numbering.\n. Heh maybe this needs to be a div with a class for styling.\n. We try not to disagree too much here, welcoming small changes via C4.1. Let's give it a spin. If someone doesn't like it, they can change it again and we keep evolving.\nThank you @freeman-lab!\n. Ok, yeah I love having these transitions sped up. It took me a sec to see the difference between selected and hovered, though now I have the cue!\n. Weird that it doesn't use the local version. You're launching via npm run start?\n. Done in #149 \n. Right now the default is:\n$ nteract nb1.ipynb nb2.ipynb\nwill open a window for notebook 1 and 2. Without arguments, it opens the intro.ipynb notebook.\n. My thought: no arguments should open a new notebook\n. Flows at the CLI:\n- npm run start opens a new Untitled notebook\n- npm run start {filename} will create {filename} if it doesn't exist\n. > Any thoughts about what npm run start . should do\nO___O Haven't thought about that or the case of any dir/.\nI think it means undefined behavior, we don't open folders. *.ipynb is do-able though.\n. Closing since we have a baseline right now of opening files at the CLI.\n. Options I've been thinking about for loading files after looking at other electron apps:\n- Query params\n- Hash parameter (as used here)\n- The IPC module\n. Yeah, definitely something. I was really hoping I could just pass in something to the BrowserWindow at the start - some sort of context object that would be available.\n. Done in #151, #152, with final cleanup in #153.\n. Yay, tests fixed.\n. Most excellent refactor!\n. I'm going to have to get used to this new drop. I rather liked how flush it was against the cell, as it didn't push the cell up or down on movement.\n. I'm definitely done pushing commits to this branch.\n. LOL, and just like that I find one more thing to tweak.\n:sleeping: \n. Took a try at the empty notebook creation for commutable in https://github.com/nteract/commutable/pull/11.\n. Flows at the CLI:\n- npm run start opens a new Untitled notebook\n- npm run start {filename} will create {filename} if it doesn't exist\n. Whoops!\nThis comes down to fixing up the handling of the notebook launch to check if fname is not undefined:\njavascript\nif(fname) {\n  launch(fname);\n}\n. Welcome to the nteract party! :tada:\n. We'll work together no matter what. C4.1 is our contribution and maintenance guideline, feel free to ask questions in issues or Slack too. :+1: \n. I like how you chose a notebook that has a message we don't implement yet (clear_output). :smile:\n. Woo!\n. Follow up to #162 \n. Hey @willingc, great to see you!\n. Problem: You know, it's grinding on me too.\nSolution: Stop using it\n/cc @jdfreder \n. Amusingly, I wrote a PR that I closed that didn't use the Problem/Solution jazz. https://github.com/nteract/react-jupyter-display-area/pull/7\n. Of note - you can write commit messages however you like. :wink: We accept patches here readily.\n. As long as you're not repeatedly hassling people. I've stopped using Problem/Solution now Paul.\n. Symbols force developers to use the exported constants instead of hard coding strings.\nSymbol(\"foo\") !== Symbol(\"foo\"), so the constants in the constants file must be used. I've tripped myself up at least once with the strings before. We can always swap back to strings if we have to, since they're exported constants and all usages rely on the constants file.\n. Ha, yeah. Would have been happy to break it up too. No one was around. :sob: Just kept going for testing sake.\n. Seems like it's working well enough now that we have Agendas in place, flux cleaned up, and channels as a context type.\n. Ken Wheeler let me know about a few more options and some patterns with shouldComponentUpdate. Then @kenwheeler had this to say:\n\nKen: Most of the time we do it by hand for micro optimization\nKyle: Ok, I'll not worry about it for now\nKen: Perf day will come\nKen: Oh it will come\nKen: You will be so glad you used immutable\n\nOn the right path then and we can keep on going until that optimization day. Great engineering mindset.\n. I'll close this and when we're focused on perf, we can dive in direct with real benchmarks to motivate how we proceed.\n. Wonder if it's time to turn on Travis? Everything we're testing right now doesn't use zmq, I wonder if there's a way to install most of a package and ignore one.\n. Feel free to turn it back on, hopefully now it's not being flaky. We need CI so if we run into more problems we'll run strider or something on carina.\nFor now we'll assume people run npm t and try out the notebook locally. If it breaks, we fix it.\n. Closing this since it needs a healthy rebase and a healthy dose of rethinking.\n. Definitely agree we need this, it's scattered across the README at the moment as we figured out more we needed to say. Time to simplify and provide clean easy to read prose.\n. Ah, cool.\n. Cool, this is pretty clean.\n. We do still need to implement the XDG specification in jupyter-paths as well: https://github.com/nteract/jupyter-paths/issues/8, to, at the very least, find all the kernels available in Linux.\nI lean towards the config folder of Jupyter (with our own namespace) just so we don't have to establish yet another standard. I do recognize that ~/.nteract is far more convenient in docs. At least in Atom, they make it discoverable within both the command palette and the top level Atom menu:\n\nOnce it's discoverable that way, it's less relevant where we store them. We can then rely on the Jupyter config directory.\n. :tada:\n. Ah that's true. Simple easy to read language. Enchannel is just what we call it so we can ship with a short name.\n. Sweet!\nSomething I haven't stated for why I tend to use gray in design - there's less focus on the colors and more on the contrast, layout, architecture. We definitely need more contrast in the above mock, which can even be in black and white too. This helps steer us clear of the risk of colorblind discussions when we're trying to lay out the content/prose.\n. @captainsafia I'm going to create nteract/docs for now and look forward to your PR!!!\n. One of those times I wish I could move an issue over to another repo, comments and all.\n. :boom:\n. :dancer: well done\n. Great having that clear \"hey here's what you need to know\" blurb at the top. Thank you!\n. No matter what, this highlights our bootstrapping problem in nteract right now in terms of how the notebook gets loaded initially. This does make me reflect on thinking about external actions affecting the state of our rendered notebook (filesystem changes, git status, etc.), though I'll have to come back to this again.\n. Of note - I left a boilerplate function in to be fixed (needs to launch the right kernel). This was mostly about setting up the menu, not the real action behind it.\n. :boom:\n. That's clean!\n. Looks like the app isn't launching after this, digging now.\n. Tests pass with this though the notebook doesn't boot properly (actions aren't registered).\n. \n. Got one!\n. As suggested by @kestertong, we should check out Google's closure library for making our safe mode include HTML.\n. New to me too. Looks like the goog require is a global. I'm not a fan of that (non idiomatic for JS/node), though I'm happy to learn from what's here.\n. This definitely works for now and breaks us away from that messy encodeURIComponent. :+1:\n. Possibly to be superseded by #444 \n. #444 handled this quite well. I'll make a new issue for the top of the state being Immutable.js\n. Very glad we're testing the main and renderer process now.\n. You did this work!\n. > Whoops\nNo need to Whoops! I was clearing through issues during a clean npm install and felt like putting in text while closing.\n. Awesome.\n. Ok, after playing with this for a bit here's my current feedback:\n- If possible, it would be nice for the +text and +code buttons to not always be shown (possibly based on mouse position?). I'm not sure what the right thing to do is, just that we want to encourage thinking about their current editing.\n- New text cells definitely need a min-height - it was hard to discover how to start editing them\n  - Maybe we even need a placeholder when an empty markdown cell - \"double-click to edit\" or we default to edit mode?\n- We need to make a mock for the cell creation buttons and work towards a design that works with the rest of our design\n. While I'm at it, I think I made a mistake in updating the mock for cell toolbar to be something flush with the cell. It should hover as a menu too (possibly...). That or we need the gray tones to match.\n. That's a good start!\nI'd instead have this conditionally choose what to render based on what's in this.props.cell.get('source'). Could display a placeholder div instead of changing state.\n. componentWillReceiveProps is going to happen for every character you type within this cell\nThere may be more props coming in that need to be cleaned up from the ...this.props passed in by the parent element that we don't need updates from.\n. This certainly captured the intent of what I said!\nI was thinking it would be a div you add in conditionally, this works even better since you get to set the message using Markdown. :wink:\n. One thing I noticed here is that we're not focusing the editor when we double click (were we before?)\n. :+1: @betatim \n. :boom:\n. :100: \n. Awesome.\nStyling matchup :100:\nThe before/after notion when between cells is a bit odd since it belongs to each cell.\n. Percentages for where my mouse are definitely seem about right for me. :+1: \n. Thanks for the comment on the hot region.\n. Hopefully this is easy enough to adapt for use with generators and redux sagas. At the very least, this encapsulates an Observable that emits actions.\n. Heh, CodeMirror provides the most warnings with react-a11y.\nTo take it for a spin yourself, npm install react-a11y then stick these lines in after the React and ReactDOM import:\njs\nconst a11y = require('react-a11y');\na11y(React, { includeSrcNode: true, ReactDOM });\n. There are reactions on GitHub now??!?!!?\n. /cc @betatim \n. Alllll done. No more touching lint rollers for a while.\nThe remaining warnings are all related to console.* except for one, which suggests that code cell should be a stateless function. Naively, I set shouldComponentUpdate to return false and that definitely broke it. Leaving that one alone.\n. 9.3 MB for source-code-pro\n8.6 MB for source-sans-pro\n356M for material-design-icons\n. I... think I'm going to trim down material-design-icons to only include the ones we need.\n. Done \"enough\" in #302 I think.\n. If for any reason we switch to webpacking this up, this transition makes that a lot simpler.\n. Sweet, yeah.\nI'm writing a README in the src/ directory as well right now to clarify the distinction between main and notebook.\n. /me whistles\nFinally tried these out at the CLI, fixed some bugs.\n. If I spun these out as another package (to be used elsewhere), I'd probably make them return Observables and rely on the user running toPromise directly if they want that interface.\nenchannel-messaging anyone?\n. I'm noticing there are a lot of \"nice to do\" follow ups for the native APIs of OS X, Windows, and Linux like these: https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/api/browser-window.md#winsetrepresentedfilenamefilename-os-x\n. Since the keymap was deleted, this can be closed.\n. Definitely fine to be deleting it now and letting someone come in to make the button later.\nIt seems like the pencil/edit icon would work well here for entering edit mode on a markdown cell.\n. Had to set white-space: pre to make it work. Back in business.\n. \n. I'm not sure what's going on (environment variables?) but I'm getting stripped plain text in both the jupyter notebook and in nteract:\n\nNot on tmpnb.org though:\n\n(though also wrong in a different way).\n. If I load that same notebook from tmpnb.org on nteract though, we get the right colors. :smile:\n\n. This is definitely the wisest thing for us to do until we make the shutdown cleaner. Thank you @betatim!\n. Neat! I know @kenwheeler is working on a branch to handle the UI/UX portion of focus cell, we could merge just the action, constant, and reducer right now without the next step too.\n. The codemirror react package were using probably does need more (P.S. There were two different codemirror react setups, not sure if this was the best one). We're also going to need to get into the tab completion machinery of codemirror too.\n. Since it's just a function, seems like a good idea. Peer dep on codemirror?\n. Duplicate of #389, I'll keep yours @Carreau. \n. Ah, unless broken up by display data:\n\n. We currently do an overall reduction on the outputs for all the relevant message types:\njs\n    // Handle all the nbformattable messages\n    subscriptions.push(childMessages\n         .ofMessageType(['execute_result', 'display_data', 'stream', 'error', 'clear_output'])\n         .map(msgSpecToNotebookFormat)\n         // Iteratively reduce on the outputs\n         .scan((outputs, output) => {\n           if (output.output_type === 'clear_output') {\n             return new Immutable.List();\n           }\n           return outputs.push(Immutable.fromJS(output));\n         }, new Immutable.List())\n         // Update the outputs with each change\n         .subscribe(outputs => {\n           subscriber.next(updateCellOutputs(id, outputs));\n         })\n    );\nwhereas it seems like we'll need to do a scan on stream that merges in selectively or we reduce prior outputs delimited by display_data.\n. Ok, I find it a little odd that stderr is always on the bottom...\n\n. Thank you for the feedback Min!\nThis at least makes me feel better about aggregating according to whichever came first. I was aiming to be as close to the notebook as possible while handling ANSI escape codes properly.\n\nAlternately, you could completely ignore the difference between stdout and stderr, which is what a terminal does.\n\nThis made me curious about escape codes and how they're handled when mixed between stderr and stdout. Of course it's literally what you said. Example script:\n``` python\nfrom colorama import Fore, Back, Style\nimport sys\nsys.stderr.write(Fore.BLUE + 'blue!\\n')\nsys.stderr.flush()\nprint(Style.DIM + 'STDOUT DIM')\nprint(Style.RESET_ALL)\nsys.stderr.flush()\nsys.stdout.flush()\nprint('back to normal now')\nsys.stderr.write('woo\\n')\n```\nTerminal output:\n\nIt's super simple to implement merging the streams in the frontend. However, that diverges from the notebook format. I honestly think that we would be able to support more escape codes in the frontend for view; complete with erase, cursor movement (for display), and text attributes.\n. > does running the notebook in nteract produce the exact same notebook as the existing notebook app\nno\n\ndoes it produce a valid notebook\n\nyes\n\nindeed we made this change in the notebook for performance reasons without changing the notebook format\n\nI'm noticing the same thing, since we have to keep appending strings. It's making me want to explore another model.\nThe nice thing about semi-rigorous terminal-emulation is that we could reduce the final string to the representation that a terminal would show. This:\n\"\\u001b[?25l\\u001b[0G\u2584 \u2562\u2591\u255f\\n\\u001b[?25h\\u001b[1A\\u001b[?25l\\u001b[0G\u258c \u2562\u2591\u2591\u255f\\n\"\nbecomes (roughly):\n\\\"u001b[?25l\\u001b[0G\u258c \u2562\u2591\u2591\u255f\\n\"\nWe then get \"terminal animations\" while the resulting notebook file is more compact (as well as in-memory representation).\n. The way this differs from the Jupyter notebook is that stderr can be buffered before stdout (if it receives stderr first). This made the implementation simpler.\n. OMG this is gorgeous ken. Tried it just now, shift-enter is working beautifully.\nAnother thing to either do in a follow-on PR or as part of this is to create a new cell when a user runs shift-enter in the last cell.\n. Cool, last commit is perfect - able to switch between cells all while output is flowing in.\n. One thing I'd love to see is for the hover cell styling of the input prompt to be used instead on the focused cell:\n\nMain reason is that while I was using this branch, noticed that my mouse cursor was keeping the styling fixed on a cell above even though I was executing below. It was hard for me to tell where my cursor had jumped to.\n. For a follow up PR:\n- [ ] Arrow key focus jumping \n- [x] Auto create new cell when end of cell list is reached\n- [ ] scrollTop adjustment to maintain focus on parent execution\n. Some other related bits that Ken suggested in chat:\n- Move the cell execute action to be more top level (can run on a focused cell without codemirror)\n- Have the focusNextCell action work on Markdown\n. Whoa, that's a great UI tweak!\n. We could do the longer form React way of doing this which is to not even render a display area on the DOM if the output is empty.\n. diff\ndiff --git a/src/notebook/components/cell/code-cell.js b/src/notebook/components/cell/code-cell.js\nindex 699c793..73046e7 100644\n--- a/src/notebook/components/cell/code-cell.js\n+++ b/src/notebook/components/cell/code-cell.js\n@@ -46,12 +46,16 @@ const CodeCell = (props, context) => {\n           focused={props.id === props.focusedCell}\n         />\n       </div>\n-      <Display\n-        className=\"cell_display\"\n-        outputs={props.cell.get('outputs')}\n-        displayOrder={props.displayOrder}\n-        transforms={props.transforms}\n-      />\n+\n+      {\n+        props.cell.get('outputs').isEmpty() ? null :\n+          <Display\n+            className=\"cell_display\"\n+            outputs={props.cell.get('outputs')}\n+            displayOrder={props.displayOrder}\n+            transforms={props.transforms}\n+          />\n+      }\n     </div>\n   );\n };\n. Very cool Electron API usage there.\n. That's peculiar. They're not a shared filesystem in any way are they?\nIn the past I've had to run npm install twice. If that's still an issue, then blech.\n. Thank you for your time in working through what is a fairly awkward startup process for the development environment. We're looking forward to refining it, including making prebuilt zmq for node so install is way easier.\n. @willingc you'll need to be on node 5, at least for building/installing, which apparently we nested much further in the README after saying \"you need node\": https://github.com/nteract/nteract#install\n. Closing since the github user has disappeared and this is more of a support/help question.\n. Prior to this, ctrl-enter was inserting a newline (and running).\n. The React lifecycle cheat sheet was super helpful here, since a new cell won't run through componentDidUpdate. For a brand new cell, we need to check for focused after mounted and focus if so.\n. \n. I'd love to make it so that on initial notebook load we focus on the first cell. I can do that in a follow up PR.\n. This was not related to #262, re-opening.\n. There we go! Now @Carreau's awesome OS X stuff handles the cli opening of a notebook well.\n. ~~Ah, we should take it out of our menu, based on that issue.~~ (not even there).\n. I'm going to go ahead and close this since there is no way for us to handle this in a nice cross platform way until Electron supports it. Re-open if/when it seems feasible.. Seems like a wise idea. It wouldn't be so bad for us to maintain our own LRU cache on disk.. I'm going to pin this one since more than one person has weighed in over time as a major requested feature. Thanks all!. Thank you! I was griping about this earlier in the morning while trying to make a demo GIF.\n. Nice!\n. If you think the other codemirror react is better, feel free to switch it up. I can't recall why we chose one over the other.\n. New styling:\n\n. While I was at it, since I'm using these notebooks, I'm finding other tweaks to make including on images.\n. Finished off the required ones!\nTempting to do edit, though I assume that would be a rather tricky cross platform one so I'm not going to do it anytime soon. Open for someone!\n. Stubbed out some warnings for the other types. Need to hone in on a design for the pager.\n. As a user, I never thought of the response to ? or ?? as a pager. It was always, to me, a doc lookup.\n. It would be really cool if we could do the pager inline with block decorations like Atom can do. Not sure if that's possible with codemirror.\n. Another, demonstrating that it's a native app:\n\n. Actually, nevermind this one, I hate the discoloration.\n. This is working really well across the whole notebook.\n. Actually, it looks like this is switching cells right yet not running the code in code blocks.\n. I'm working on packaging right now and recognizing that trimming down our babel plugins makes our releases much simpler (because of defaults in electron-compile-prebuilt).\n. This is working really well, thanks!\n. My opinion is as the same as above, that it runs in place and doesn't focus the next cell. I'll go ahead and close this since the opinions were uniform. If anyone ever wants a different behavior they can open a new issue or re-open this one.\n. /cc @willingc \nI'm sure you'll have more substantial and clear docs than what I put together here. This is a stopgap.\n. I wonder if a prior failed build didn't run through the rest, maybe a new npm install after deleting node_modules?\n(Sorry this is being painful)\n\nWe don't have stage-0 explicitly defined in .babelrc\n\nThis seems like a dependency from electron-compile (which includes a bunch of defaults)\n. Woohoo! Yay. We'll get the eslint bits sorted out. Now that my brain is thinking clearly, it's because we bumped our version of eslint to 3.x. We likely need a bump of babel-eslint as well. I'll tackle that now.\n. This is only my first stab at it. I'd love to have an alternative design where docs could appear inline where it was run.\n\u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n. All the cell ops from the jupyter notebook:\n\n\n\n. Some of the Jupyter ones will collapse into common actions:\n- Copy pasta will be the native buffer, not a separate cell menu action\n- Merge cell is already folded into one action (since it lies between cells)\n- Insert cell is also folded into one action (since it lies between cells)\nThe experience for run could be simplified. We should probably add some of the Run commands to the native menu. Run cell is already on the cell.\n. If you're in favor of codemirror keymaps, I'm certainly open to it. Jon experimented with the atom keymap module (which was a pure node module) and it was very nice as a top level module for electron. Deep down into codemirror I have no idea.\n. Looks like these got finished off by @captainsafia and @betatim! :tada:\n. /cc @willingc all set on the grumpy eslint!\n. Went ahead and bumped our version of electron, since it has good bug fixes and changes nothing about the ABI version. It does rely on node 5.10.0, though you can be on a prior 5.x release.\n. @cfljam On the left side of the cell (the input area) you can click to drag and drop cells. I'll chalk that one up to us needing better discovery of the drag and drop location and likely an alternate way of moving cells up and down.\n. I went ahead and completely nuked all of my installed node versions from nvm (as well as all the node_modules), removed node_modules within nteract, installed a fresh node v5.10.1 using nvm, then installed nteract. nteract launched and worked perfectly with a notebook as arg and with no args.\nA few tips:\n- npm cache clean -f - make sure your cache is clean since you bumped your version of node\n- Rely on nvm for node version management\n. Done in #300 \n. You will see this warning:\n$ npm install\nnpm WARN react-code-mirror@3.0.6 requires a peer of react@>=0.12.0 <0.15.0 but none was installed.\nDo you think that's ok for now?\n. Alright, patch submitted upstream: https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/react-code-mirror/pull/18\n. @jdfreder If you think so, I'm game for going ahead with this then.\n. Closing in favor of #1346.. Just an update -- there is now a web version of nteract that runs on top of the jupyter server. You can try it out on binder!\nThe jupyter extension is called nteract_on_jupyter on PyPI and there are install instructions here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/applications/jupyter-extension\nBeyond that, there are related packages for building your own using @nteract/core. I don't think the API is stable yet, so you'd have to build along with us..

Yay! Hi @szeitlin! Thanks for joining via my random summons there and welcome to nteract!\nThere is a quicklook plugin for IPython/Jupyter, though I have not tried it yet:\n\nThe way we open notebooks natively from the nteract notebook right now is like this, which leaves viewing and sorting up to the folder you're in:\n\nDoes that help with the experience or are you looking for more?\n. This now works well on OS X, still needs work for Windows and Linux.\n. Oh yeah, this should be good on Windows. I can try it tonight.\nReally need to circle back on the whole Quicklook plugin.\n. I'll go ahead and close this. We can re-open, though if it manifests as an issue I think it's something for us to help fix in electron-builder.\n. OMG Paul\n. I'm laughing too hard.\n. I mean that when we install, we want to have quicklook support for notebooks also installed so when they browse through they see:\n\n. Yeah, that's true. We can also use the components we've been putting together here in it.\n. What's the word on this? Would it help if I put up a mock that had a dark theme that was similar to our current theme?\n. Our transition to the assets folder off of LFS was awkward. Hopefully we can clear right through that from here.\n. The only thing I'm noticing missing here is that the cells aren't flush when \"inactive\", as they are with our default theme.\n. I must be missing something. Assets aren't all loaded.\n\n. ~~There are no errors reported at the command line for npm run start intro.ipynb to say anything about the menu. Digging into that now.~~\nNevermind that one, looks like I wasn't looking in the right spot. It's View --> Theme\n. Looks like the CSS is one path too deep, tackling that now.\n. Oh noes! Where is this going!?\n. Once #417 is merged, this is completely finished off from the git based loading. Later we'll want to switch to only WOFF2 format for the fonts, which trims our size quite a bit.\n. This totally takes the file out of git and git lfs, as far as I can tell. How about we go with @jdfreder's #311, and make this repo simpler to digest?\n. Since #311 overlap in the right ways, I'll just merge this and clean up the README to take out the LFS usage.\n. Hmmm, I'm not seeing that in my console. Do you have a notebook this is triggered on?\n. Oh great, I've been hoping for that. I'll check out the code thoroughly since you're asking.\n. This reminds me that I need to get my split cell branch up. I still have it sitting around, haven't pushed since I got distracted with right-click context menus.\n. Merged the Merger!\n. \nSadly this doesn't show the publish menu, which looks like this:\n\n. Missing pieces to follow on with:\n- Auth\n  - For GitHub, we could assume an environment variable for the token (as other services use) \n- Public vs. private gist selection\n. Of note: the gist extension on the jupyter notebook defaults to public. I defaulted to \"secret\" gist here, as well as anonymous (for the time being).\n. This now authenticates with GitHub if GITHUB_TOKEN is set as an environment variable, which lets you update the same gist each time you publish.\nLet me know what you think of the flow.\nI'm now mildly irritated with nbviewer's caching. :wink: Tempted to switch the resulting URL to be the gist URL or creating a client side renderer using nteract components.\n. When you publish again, it updates the gist (new commit).\n. We definitely need to figure out an auth flow here.\n. Thanks Safia.\n. This makes me wonder where the getName was pulling it from before.\n. Ok, awesome. I'll be glad to help.\n. Whoa! It's alive! \n\nExtremely well done @Carreau!\n. > Pleasant side effect, nteract seems to launch quicker!\nThat's definitely going to happen since it doesn't have to compile on start everytime (production mode for electron compile does this too).\n. There's currently a merge conflict, though I'm in favor of switching to the build system to make distribution simpler.\n. Curious what made you choose es5 instead of dist or build.\nIt will take me some time mentally to wrap my head around the new hierarchy with static resources in a separate folder rather than being grouped logically with the app using them.\n. ```\n$ npm t\n\nnteract@0.0.1 test /Users/kyle6475/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract\nnpm run test:main && npm run test:renderer\nnteract@0.0.1 test:main /Users/kyle6475/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract\nelectron-mocha --compilers js:babel-core/register 'test/main/*/.js'\n\n{ [Error: Cannot find module '../../es5/main/launch'] code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND' }\nError: Cannot find module '../../es5/main/launch'\n    at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:339:15)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:290:25)\n    at Module.require (module.js:367:17)\n    at require (internal/module.js:16:19)\n    at Object.

Sweet packaging.\n. Epic. Short, simple, works. Yay.\n. I should have recorded a GIF with this, I'll do that later when I'm on one monitor.\n. Not sure how one registers openers, we should figure that out too...\n. Oh hmmm, yeah it doesn't accept the file. There must be some handler that has to be specified on it. I can record a GIF later today.\n. The currentnpm run dist:osx` now builds with a plist that allows you to drag a file to the nteract app icon. \n. Hold off on merging, I think I got the top level type on CFBundle wrong as well as the name itself...\n. Woo! This now works for accepting a file dragged and dropped on the icon either in the Dock or within Finder.\nStill unsure how to make it work for spotlight. Maybe the plist has to be indexed?\n. Of note: the plist changes only apply to the built app. You can't try this without building it and working with the built copy.\n. This is all set now, and if we want to include the script that I use to generate this we certainly can. The JS is much easier to read (and much shorter) than the plist file.\n. There's always the cheater mode from right click ipynb file -> get info:\n\n\n. The bottom screenshot is me setting it manually since I couldn't open it from Finder.

We could probably do without the little n(t) that I put together on a whim to think about alternate icons.\n. This is quite an enhancement on the sloppily chopped logo I handed Jon for testing. :wink:\nWe have a logos repo for us to iterate on the logo by the way.\n. Yay for less typing on the CLI to build a dist locally for us OS X users. :smile:\n. Wowsers. We're going to have to learn how to profile electron apps.\n. I think this one has been sorted out with our current startup flows and epics. Feel free to re-open if you're still seeing it.\n. While I agree that we should do functional tests, I'd rather test src/ directly for quicker dev workflow and feedback (as well as not having to run the build to run a single test).\n. Closing in favor of #331 \n. Reasonable first pass.\n. Love these kinds of updates, thank you!\n. Just a note to get started and make your life simpler - @kenwheeler suggested we use enzyme which we've started using in transformime-react.\n. Nah, not yet. I'm going to prep and eat some lunch then I can tackle coveralls.\n. I've switched over one test to enzyme, rebasing will make your work easier here.\n. Since @jdfreder cherry picked the commit from here in #362, closing.\n. Since we're using electron-mocha, which is a node process that spawns an electron process that in turn spawns a renderer process when using --renderer, istanbul doesn't hook into the right require. We have to run istanbul from inside the electron process.\n. Since we're running multiple processes (main & renderer), this is useful: https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul#multiple-process-usage\n. Related issue: https://github.com/jprichardson/electron-mocha/issues/44\n. I think before_install needs to run ./travis_before_install (note the ./).\n. That's great!\n. Looking forward to Travis working again\n. Looking good!\n. Looks like I need to adapt this for the test matrix.\n. I got codecov working, I'll be posting a PR when I get back home.\n. Them angry robot legs.\n. Done in #371 \n. Ah, there may be a neat way of handling this within launch.js. \n. Right now our function for launching URLs has the native browser open it instead:\njs\nexport function deferURL(event, url) {\n  event.preventDefault();\n  shell.openExternal(url);\n}\nThat can do other logic on the passed in url to check if it's a local link that ends in .ipynb. No messy handling of the links on a page, letting Chromium/Electron just hand you the URL when ready.\n. We've definitely got a bit of a problem in terms of how electron views the page - we have to track the user's cwd while keeping Electron's relative asset loading intact.\nSeparate from that issue, there is a helper path to finding the relative path: __dirname.\nFor instance, in the main window __dirname is /Users/kyle/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/static for me.\nAnother note: If we notice the prefix is not file: we must do openExternal, even if it ends in .ipynb.\n. Hmmm, well this is interesting. I may have figured out something wonderful while exploring the browser window docs. We could set the open-url handler in nteract and consistently rely on that for opening .ipynb links. This would solve another problem we have with loading relative assets that are next to the notebook.\n\ud83e\udd14 \n. When we launch kernels we use path.dirname(path.resolve(filename)) to get the directory for the notebook.. State tree wise it's in state.metadata.filename. I'm going to try the <base> element real quick.. I knew this would be a problem for loading our CSS and yet it's also kind of awesome:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/src/notebook/components/notebook.js b/src/notebook/components/notebook.js\nindex b54f201..654f196 100644\n--- a/src/notebook/components/notebook.js\n+++ b/src/notebook/components/notebook.js\n@@ -24,6 +24,8 @@ import {\n } from '../actions';\n import type { CellProps } from './cell/cell';\n+const path = require('path');\n+\n type Props = {\n   displayOrder: ImmutableList,\n   notebook: any,\n@@ -39,6 +41,7 @@ type Props = {\n   CellComponent: any,\n   executionState: string,\n   models: ImmutableMap,\n+  filename: string,\n };\nexport function getLanguageMode(notebook: any): string {\n@@ -64,6 +67,7 @@ const mapStateToProps = (state: Object) => ({\n   stickyCells: state.document.get('stickyCells'),\n   executionState: state.app.get('executionState'),\n   models: state.comms.get('models'),\n+  filename: state.metadata.get('filename'),\n });\nexport class Notebook extends React.PureComponent {\n@@ -211,6 +215,7 @@ export class Notebook extends React.PureComponent {\n     const cellOrder = this.props.notebook.get('cellOrder');\n     return (\n       \n+        ${path.dirname(path.resolve(this.props.filename))}} />\n         \n``\n.

Closing as \"feature\", deferring to #1067.\n. Currently working on executeCell, which may take me a good bit of time. I'll take the WIP tag off for what's here and handle the harder and more interesting ones. Going to need to take some time to bone up on testing with Observables next.\n.

I wonder if codecov doesn't know how to deal with JSX.\n. Merging because obviously this is more than before. :smile:\n. Closing in favor of #377, will want to fully test the NEW_KERNEL reduction though.\n. We've now got an explicit error dialog when no kernels are found, as well as instructions (#759, #716). It's also in the most recent alpha release. Closing!\nThanks for trying nteract out and opening this.\nWe'll keep #357 around as we need to figure out how to detect conda environments soon.\n. Thanks for the detailed report @parleur. I haven't tried getting nteract to work with Anaconda, though I imagine it's related to the sys.prefix when it launches.\nWithin the console on nteract itself (it's chromium under the hood), run require('kernelspecs').findAll().then(x => console.log(x)). You'll probably get different results than plain node.\nAdditionally, I'd run\nrequire('sys-prefix-promise')().then(x => console.log(x))\nand in ipython run:\nimport sys; print(sys.prefix)\n. /cc @jdfreder\n. Here's the approach I'd like to take on startup (likely within kernelspecs):\n- Check if conda is available on the PATH (which we now have thanks to #842)\n- Run conda env list --json:\njson\n{\n  \"envs\": [\n    \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.12/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/envs/distie\", \n    \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.12/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/envs/ipy\", \n    \"/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.12/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/envs/another\"\n  ]\n}\nNote: This is missing the root environment (that you would normally see with conda env list) - https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/3541.\nIf this is the root environment, I expect to be able to run\npython -m ipykernel -f {connection_file}\nregardless, even if the kernel is not installed.\n. Ok, great. I've got a working setup for a conda-kernel provider to get all the sys prefixes by name.\nI'm forming up an array of objects like this:\n[{'name': 'distie',\n  'prefix': '/usr/local/opt/python/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/envs/distie'},\n {'name': 'ipy',\n  'prefix': '/usr/local/opt/python/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/envs/ipy'},\n {'name': 'microbots',\n  'prefix': '/usr/local/opt/python/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/envs/microbots'},\n {'name': 'root',\n  'prefix': '/usr/local/opt/python/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7'}]\nThe next problem is detecting installed jupyter kernels. Within those sys.prefixes, I'd want to look for share/jupyter to find kernels. If they're not in there, I have to slightly assume that I can run python -m ipykernel -f {connection_file} whether or not I know that ipykernel is in the env.\nThen again, I can check for ipykernel, but this all impacts startup time for the user and making the logic a bit more crazy.\n. Seems like something we can do, if theres an environment variable for the current conda environment that is stable to use.\n. In #847, I'm pulling up all conda environments which have the IPython kernel installed. Eventually I'll move that to the main thread (since we want to populate the menu), and we can also make sure that the default notebook on launch case uses the current conda environment.\n. @NHDaly Absolutely! I've been chasing down some other fixes and haven't been able to devote my time completely to this. Some changes generally need to be made to how we\n- [ ] register kernelspecs in the menu, in the main process\n- [ ] provide all the kernelspecs to a notebook process to use\n- [ ] send a particular kernelspec to the notebook process\n847 completely creates all the kernelspecs necessary, most of what we need next is organization around how we handle actions for kernel start. Deep within our epics is a little document/outline on how we can start to approach this.\nIf you want to start off on a precursor PR, it would be to change our menu logic to sending the full kernelspec from the main process (instead of a kernel name). After that, we can set up the conda kernels in the main process (as a one time cost, since we now have a loading menu).\nWe also need a way to provide all the kernelspecs, on startup, to the notebook process (since we load which kernelspec to launch from a notebook's metadata). Really happy to have you work on this with us!\n. To start things off, I can extract a portion of that conda kernel finding setup to a module separate from my PR (which I'm happy to close and only refer to).\n. Beautiful. 10/10 best use of undefined.\n. At least we'll very clearly know what code path our users went down to get to the hidden theme.\n. It's currently hidden behind the theme variable being unset. :wink:\n. We should definitely enable a konami code here.\n. RxJS 4 (with RxDOM) has an example for konami codes.\n. ```\nEnable disco mode\necho '{\"theme\":\"undefined\"}' > ~/Library/Application\\ Support/nteract/theme.json\n``\n. @Carreau Is electron-json-storage putting settings in the wrong spot? We can move things to the right spot. I was thinking in #180 that we would colocate with other jupyter config.\n. Ah, cool. Thanks.\n. Since switching over to [react-codemirror](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-codemirror) I haven't seen this issue again. I'll go ahead and close it. If anyone else notices it, feel free to re-open.\n. This issue. Guh. @jdfreder told me to make sure to take a screenshot with the codemirror dom nodes showing in the inspector next time. Will do.\n. Keep rolling!\n. I've seen cachingnode_modulesbe a problem at times, though I don't have anything concrete beyond that.\n. :boom:\n. Looks like the cached builds are running into issues @jdfreder.\n. For further good bash practices, check out the [Google Bash Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml).\n. On a side note, we should switch toobama` for linting JS.\n. We can put it in now and do styling after.\n. Not sure why this fails on project coverage with codecov.\n. Nice. I've been stopped from patching for not testing. :smile: I'll be on this again later tonight.\n. This is all set now, complete with tests! Ok, slightly tested.\n. I'm going to give you a pass on the codecov and fully expect us to run tests against the high level notebook component soon. :smile:\n. With the current component, this isn't possible. Shelving for now.\n. We definitely need a test kernel... I'm in a bit of a predicament because Travis has a Python2 kernel whereas locally others might have a Python3 kernel.\n. Done in #379.\n. Hints are all set. This has parity with the prior implementation. \ud83d\udc83 \n. We'll want to filter out pure whitespace lines or some other heuristic as well because of IPython's global mode responses.\n. Did some basic whitespace checking. We still need to fix the \"open-parens\" case. I'm digging into this now.\n. I probably should have put a \"please discuss\" tag on this one. This needs some more work.\n. What do you think about this one now that jedi is integrated (or so I thought)?\n. Literally just experienced this out of muscle memory and realized it was a common binding on other editors.\n. If/when we switch to non-node output areas (sandboxed iframes), users won't have any access to run code on kernels (nor node itself). The vector I'm thinking of here would look like:\n<img src='/some/path' onload='' />\nwhere onload gets access to the \"image\" itself.\nIt seems that normal fetch and XHR disallows a lot of sane defaults:\n\nAdditionally, we can lock down our content security policy to a great degree, just like Atom currently does.\nMeta: @#(%&@#(%\n. Closing as \"feature\", deferring to #1067.\n. Whoa, you're the first Windows user to try it out! Thank you! We're definitely going to provide Windows support so I'd love to track this down.\nIt looks like it's the kernelspecs module that is causing trouble (and it could be down inside jupyter-paths). Let's see if we can find a smaller test case.\nTry running this in node:\nrequire('kernelspecs').findAll().then(console.log)\nCouple other diagnostics that I'd like to know about:\n- Are you using Anaconda's Python distribution?\n- How is the Jupyter kernel installed?\n- What version of Windows are you on?\n. Cool. I just reproduced this on a clean Windows 10 machine.\n. Still more to do it looks like, in terms of sys-prefix-promise:\n```\nPS C:\\Users\\kyle\\kernelspecs> node\n\nrequire('.')\nrequire('.')\n{ findAll: [Function: findAll] }\nrequire('.').findAll()\nPromise {  }\nrequire('.').findAll().then(x => console.log(x)).catch(err => console.error(err))\nPromise {  }\n{ [Error: Command failed: python -c 'import sys; print(sys.prefix)'\n  File \"\", line 1\n    'import\n          ^\nSyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal\n]\n  killed: false,\n  code: 1,\n  signal: null,\n  cmd: 'python -c \\'import sys; print(sys.prefix)\\'' }\n\n``\n. Since you did a node upgrade, make sure to deletenode_modulesandnpm install` again, as the native libraries need to be built for the new version.\n. That certainly ensures a clean setup! You're all set there then. I'll be back on later to keep going with my Windows build as well as the fixes that come up. Hopefully you and I will get the Windows setup in excellent shape!\n. Directly in PowerShell this works with Python:\nPS C:\\Users\\kyle\\kernelspecs> python -c \"import sys; print(sys.prefix)\"\nC:\\Users\\kyle\\Anaconda2\nSame thing with singlequotes too.\nTime for me to find out why the sys-prefix-promise code is not spawning properly on Windows.\n. Fixed up sys-prefix-promise https://github.com/rgbkrk/sys-prefix-promise/pull/3 and followed it up by bumping the dependency for jupyter-paths. Now this works:\n```\nPS C:\\Users\\kyle\\jupyter-paths> node\n\nrequire('.').dataDirs({withSysPrefix: true}).then(console.log).catch(console.error)\nPromise {  }\n[ 'C:\\Users\\kyle\\AppData\\Roaming\\jupyter',\n  'C:\\Users\\kyle\\Anaconda2\\share\\jupyter',\n  'C:\\ProgramData\\jupyter' ]\n``\n. Yay,kernelspecs` is ready to go too!\n\n```\nPS C:\\Users\\kyle\\kernelspecs> node\n\nrequire('.')\n{ findAll: [Function: findAll] }\nrequire('.').findAll()\nPromise {  }\nrequire('.').findAll().then(console.log).catch(console.error)\nPromise {  }\n{ python2:\n   { name: 'python2',\n     files:\n      [ 'C:\\Users\\kyle\\AppData\\Roaming\\jupyter\\kernels\\python2\\kernel.json',\n        'C:\\Users\\kyle\\AppData\\Roaming\\jupyter\\kernels\\python2\\logo-32x32.png',\n        'C:\\Users\\kyle\\AppData\\Roaming\\jupyter\\kernels\\python2\\logo-64x64.png' ],\n     resources_dir: 'C:\\Users\\kyle\\AppData\\Roaming\\jupyter\\kernels\\python2',\n     spec: { display_name: 'Python 2', language: 'python', argv: [Object] } } }\n```\n. > I cant still get there.\n\nI'm not there yet either, whittling off little issues here and there. The harder one is going to be ZeroMQ since I have the Visual Studio C++ tools installed directly instead of the old one that node-zmq requires...\n. The log helps! I'll be digging in. Thank you @klonuo.\n. I've changed the title since the title that was in the issue before has been fixed, yet we're not all the way there for Windows.\n. We switched to zmq prebuilt recently to try to get it so people don't have to build it locally, which apparently broke it for your local build (reliant on the original zmq). A next first step on the prebuilt setup is to make it default back to the original build (which is what prebuild normally does).\nThank you for taking the time to get it working and to comment here.\n. We now have a shipped release for Windows as well as testing on Windows and a plan for the future with building on Windows. I'll go ahead and close this. Feel free to re-open if the core problem is still there. \n. Also, noted about the Windows label. Creating that now.\n. @mangecoeur Neat! I was talking to @nathansobo about extracting the editor component out of Atom a few days ago, so I think this in on their roadmap as well. Relatedly, I posted about it over in https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/issues/122 (though the wrong repo for that issue).\n. @Carreau has this been exported as part of the JupyterLab effort at all?\n. Done in #871. Magics not set correctly though.\n. That makes sense. We do have status in the store as well. However, I think it gets queued up regardless.\n. This sounds like a neat little Rx problem that I can tackle.\n. Oh awesome! Didn't know about this.\nWe could even move this check up into a filter operator prior.\n. This is sooooooo smooth.\n. I'm guessing we'll only be running this from a Linux machine to build the icons.\n. Now that's a sneaky handle\n. Since we're variablizing our CSS anyways, we should probably make this match the input area width directly.\n. Looking great! This works quite well. It feels (as a user) that the selection region should start a bit further in on the left of the output area.\n. Yeah, thinner drag handle width.\n. All good!\n. ok wow. This feels \u200breal\u200b good. What a great tweak. As a user it feels natural to select within the output area now, regardless of when the I appears.\nHowever, when a markdown cell is in edit mode it shouldn't be draggable.\n\nOtherwise you can't select your beginning text very easily.\n. The only reason I kept the markdown cell as full width before was to match the old notebook. Open to trying this!\n. What an angry looking chart.\n. Must be. They let you set what you enable and disable, I think I'll turn whatever that is off.\n. Awesome, thank you. I just added this same YAML to the whole org.\n. You'll need to modify index.html too\n. Ah, nteract/assets needs to vendorize that then. #308 is explicitly calling for not installing source code pro from git, which is currently being done.\n. Thanks Jon!\n. That's alright, I didn't realize either when I first started with the native menu stuff.\n. We'll go ahead and iterate on fixing up the cell run ordering after.\n:+1: \n. Very true. That could be slick. In general I hope we get to a point of stability to export more here for use by other new packages.\nIf the menus in Electron (ok, on OS X) weren't funky with multiple windows, we could easily launch a side console. I'm game to hack on this with you after we make an initial beta release of nteract/nteract.\n. I still want to do this, I have not had the bandwidth to do so though. \ud83d\ude1e . Done in #410.\n. Closing as this was purely speculative and we went a different route.. Whoa, that's pretty neat. I've been wondering about the right way to do mocks with these.\n. Should we go ahead and close this now that we're on redux with redux-observable?\n. Sounds good to me!\n. Closing due to inactivity.\n. This looks like a good idea to me. I'm not sure how/why this failed the functional tests, so I re-kicked it.\n. We do have our own home directory function (that is used within jupyter-paths). Coupling that with this function\nfunction tildify(home, p) {\n  const s = path.normalize(p) + path.sep;\n  return (s.indexOf(home) === 0 ? s.replace(home + path.sep, '~' + path.sep) : s).slice(0, -1);\n}\nand we're well on our way.\n. Weird, doesn't pass locally for me either. I wonder if it's the synchronous home directory call that tildify makes.\n. Awesome! I'm going to merge and then make some notes inline.\n. Legit, this is good. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Super outline @jdfreder \n. Worth bringing Jon's outline over, probably in the main PR text (or a new issue with a checklist).\n. That table is so fat.\n. What do we need to do for this? What's the expected layout?\n. Just \"figured out\" one of our performance problems. React is always running in dev mode right now because we don't set process.env.NODE_ENV to \"production\".\n. This seems to not be an issue right now, feel free to re-open.\n. This is where I must admit that I will always make packages start at 1.0.0 and then bump the patch release earnestly. It was such a trickle to get ansi-to-react bits moved up.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Since we do the same thing with gists, perhaps we need a stringify for our commutable notebooks.\n. Related to #490 \n. #357, #356\n. The two remaining issues in here I'll defer to new issues instead of sub points.\n. This one definitely needs some thinking and iterating.\n. Done in #1167.\n. IJulia\nIt's possible @jdfreder \"fixed\" this with a delayed startup from the kernel, waiting for the first idle status (done in widgets PR #487).\n. The \"don't execute too early\" bug has been fixed by making our epics more resilient. We need some better UI/UX when a kernel is slow to start, which I'll outline in another issue.. Looks like it was https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1116, which was a wholly different use case than I outlined above, also assisted by the frozen/pinned cell. Another semi-related concept is @minrk's scratch cell.\n. Sticky cell! I love that name.\n. Popping out a cell would be wonderful!\nDoing so does completely break some features that people come to rely on:\n- Globally defined JavaScript (from another cell) would no longer be defined/shared\n- HTML templates (declarative widgets) would not work\nThat being said, we could do comms across to another window with no problem and would be a really good introduction to doing our model for realtime (just for yourself).\nI'd start with only the local pinning for now and come back to the \"separate window\" idea.\n. I'd love to see that too!\n. This was implemented sometime ago. The subtopic for popping out a cell should be opened as a new issue if folks are interested.\n. Great! I've been hoping for this.\n. This does make me wonder if there's a zoom role or set of defaults so we don't have to implement this all the way through.\n. that starts us off!\n. My hope was that we would send the current time stamp over with the actions, as would be useful for realtime, instead of using marks. I'm going to try this current implementation out soon though.\n. Well that's awesome. \ud83d\ude04 \n. Ah yeah, rendered markdown focuses the cell and then kind of \"gets stuck\".\nCode cell up/down is awesome though.\n. Much better. Way less boilerplate.\n. I'm glad you made enter work on the markdown cells for getting into edit mode! It does introduce a newline though.\n. We're now on commonmark again, issue still prevails.\n. This works now! Not sure when it was fixed, just noticed though.\n\n. Looking quite good.\nWe'll probably want to change up our LaTeX transform too. If KaTeX errors, the whole show is brought down.\n\n. Some interesting little bits of inconsistencies we have here - redux-observable has a peer dep of rxjs@5.0.0-beta.6 and a require('rxjs/Rx') import whereas the rest of our Rx stack is from the @reactivex/rxjs import/install.\n. We don't have too much worry about the bundle size since this is an Electron app, so we can use the var Rx = require('rxjs/Rx'); form to get all the core Rx functionality and work around the differing imports.\n. That makes sense. For ease of development, I think we'll pin to match the version you're using in redux observable, 5.0.0-beta.6.\n\nwe also need to a solution for normal web users as well...though this might not the correct forum\n\nYou're more than welcome here - we're happy consumers of RxJS 5. Thanks for chiming in.\n. Very closed. :heart: \n. We should at the very least color the left hand draggable margin too.\n. Really unsure what's going on with Travis. I have a nice clean install working locally just fine. Travis keeps bombing out trying to require('rxjs/rx'). There is a warning about not being able to build native modules (even though zmq appears to be built just fine).\n\u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n. The part that is worrying me right now is this:\n```\n\nexecSync@1.0.2 install /home/travis/build/nteract/nteract/node_modules/execSync\nnode install.js\n[execsync v1.0.2] Attempting to compile native extensions.\n[execSync v1.0.2]\n    Native code compile failed!!\nzmq@2.15.1 install /home/travis/build/nteract/nteract/node_modules/zmq\nnode-gyp rebuild\n``\n. Since I'm on a Mac, the _one_ place where I usedrxjs/rxwas fine for me everywhere (because of case insensitivity). For some reason everywhere else I usedrxjs/Rx. Thanks for diagnosing @jdfreder, followed by merging the enchannel-zmq-backend patch. \ud83d\ude05 \n. Did you want to adjust the offset now or after?\n. Yup, this is pretty slick even when fading into the dark theme.\n. A precursor notification, like \"uploading\"?\n. omg, we need those for the loading screen. I forgot about that.\n. We can test the literal structure usingenzyme`.\n. We're now missing the padding on outputs.\n\n\n. Since only #429 is left here, I'll close this and defer to that issue.\n. omg, so classic\n. \ud83d\udc4d I've seen these \"ghosts\" too, all themes\n. We do have access to the DOM with electron-mocha for testing. setCellHoverState seems like the most likely candidate for testing.\n. One day I look forward to deeper testing than this. Good framing for a later pass. :smile:\n. I can no longer click trash before the upper right cell toolbar disappears.\n. This is making me wonder if the notification belongs in actions and that the notification system should be in context, like the channels. Reduction should not be doing anything asynchronous.\n. From a conversation with Jon (copied with permission):\n```\nJon: I'm frustrated in this PR. I shouldn't be accessing the state in the actions\n     BUT\n     not doing so means I need to pass the execution state down through all of the components, all the way to the cell toolbar with the play button. that or pass down a callback, all the way... ug\nKyle: The notificationSystem should be a context type, just like the channels\nJon: ah yeah, that solves that, but what about execution state? Surely it doesn't logically make sense to pipe it all the way down.\nKyle: Now what you're saying about execution state. Let's take a step back\nJon: execution state is required because the launch of a kernel is only half of the story. so channels are only half of the story.\nKyle: The goal here is to not execute if the kernel is not connected\nJon: we need to hear from the kernel that it has been launched successfully\nKyle: should these executions get queued up ahead\nJon: no, I don't think so\nKyle: k\nJon: because, for example, my computer has a Py3 kernel which launches but never \"starts\"\nKyle: What if the prop we were passing (or context) was whether the kernel was connected. I realize we can't check that channels is available, because it might still be connecting.\nJon: Still seems like the toolbar shouldn't have to know about that\nKyle: I think this check needs to be performed higher up. More than one piece of the app can do a run. It's the core feature\nCell -> Run All\nShift-enter\nCell Toolbar\nJon: Yeah, so the information will have to be propagated to all of those\nKyle: yeah, right off the store you can select that prop off\n```\n. I'm laughing so hard about this.\n. Anything you can do in a browser, you can do in Electron. Better yet, you're able to load them direct from disk. :smile: Personally, I'd aim for just a couple of these for now until the rest of our platform is fairly stable.\n. \n\n\n. > That was a rhetorical question.\nHahahaha.\n. \nThe pumpkin stays fixed in one spot, I was kind of expecting it to hang out in the corner.\n. > Linting fixed, and introduced : npm run lint:fix\nWell done!\n. I'm guessing you'll want to install the Python 2 kernel locally. Our default in tests here looks to be python2, for the sake of ease on Travis.\nbrew install python\npython2 -m pip install ipykernel\npython2 -m ipykernel install --user\n. We should make our tests work whether python2 or python3 is available so you don't have to have both, though I don't think you have to address that for this PR.\nThanks for this awesomeness @kenwheeler. \n. Notes so far:\n- I haven't been able to switch to another kernel successfully\n- Cell focus is a bit... odd. It seems like I can't select into codemirror to type into a cell above - I have to select the cell then click in the codemirror area to execute. This could be related to the changes with the cell toolbar (#465), though I can't tell for sure.\n. Everything else is quite flawless, all execution and cell ops work really well.\n. Ok weird, I can no longer reproduce the lack of ability to switch kernels. Not sure what's up.\n. \ud83d\ude08 \n. My favorite example of this is hyperterm, particularly in defining a structure for registering and relying on Redux as the plugin mechanism (actions, middlewares, etc.). I think we could build something pretty cool here.\n. Oh, and the quintessential nylas - building plugins for react apps post!\n. Now that we've been at this for a bit, I think there are three main points of extensions we should aim for supporting:\n- Themes\n- Custom renderers #670\n- Publication\n. We currently have a simple configuration file so in lieu of letting us expand our scope too much, I'll close this and we can open it again at a later date.. Betcha want to write a test or two. ;)\n. :grin:\n. Whoa! Great to see.\n. There's a high likelihood there will be other themes, as we already have three themes: \n- light\n- dark\n- classic (Jupyter)\nnteract currently relies on CSS variables, which I'd love to adapt to make frontend widgets and plots adapt dynamically to the user's theme.\n. That would be really nice.\n. nteract is currently dependent on class hierarchy and CSS variables. The DOM structure does have to stay consistent in order for us to write multiple themes.\nCurrent \"spec\": https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/460\nIf there was a way, I'd prefer for us to rely on more CSS variables instead of class hierarchy. The DOM structure may need to change after all.\n. Nice, all set with tests.\n. I'd love to see the pure component render stuff extracted, but I think I'll go ahead and merge this. I personally feel conflicted in that this directly ties us (yet again) to a specific version of the widgets.\nCurrent cons:\n- elevates the widgets to having their own specific section of the document as part of cell areas, not leaving room for how bokeh, matplotlib notebook mode, and others that use the comms\n- ties us to a specific version of the widgets. This is the same problem we were facing with Thebe and generally across the notebook; it is shelved here again. We need a static resource spec to fetch. Relatedly...\n- our shim layer has to match the version of ipywidgets in use\n. Actually, I'll step away from merging in case others have comments. Following C4.1, this PR is much larger than we should be dealing with. Where indicated above, also in accordance with C4.1, we have ourselves a \"lack of spec\" issue. This is technical debt brewing in our future.\n. The npm package approach sounds worth exploring.\n. > I'd be happy to create a widget communication spec here, but it really belongs in Jupyter.\nIt's ok for it to exist in Jupyter, that's where the notebook format and message spec come from after all.\n. > it would be easy to implement other renderers that were just as powerful as widgets (for example, dynamic charting, etc.).\nI've definitely been hoping for a vega-lite mimetype that we could use regardless of the rendering environment.\n. \ud83d\ude38 \n. and so it is. NODE 6\nMake sure to nuke your node_modules before doing a fresh npm install when on node 6.\n. The IPython kernel is not installed into the kernelspecs directory that Hydrogen, nteract, and other non-Python frontends to Jupyter look for. Instead, Jupyter treats python as a default kernel. To install it yourself, use:\npython3 -m pip install ipykernel\npython3 -m ipykernel install --user\n. Thanks for trying this out and rolling through the growing pains @robintw!\n. I'll get some tests on this one while I'm at it.\n. I'll get some tests into here with enzyme that test keyboard actions then this will be ready to go.\n. This one is more of a lead up to doing a top-level immutable state, which I've done in a separate branch that I'm breaking apart in pieces now.\n. Oh, sweet. Thanks @jdfreder. I was about to add more coverage.\n. Want to rebase?\n. This was partially done in #498. I'll update a todo list above.\n. Now a duplicate of #616 (ok, the other way around). I'll close this one since #616 is more specific and this has partially been handled.\n. What happened during the npm install?\nI'm guessing that it failed, likely choking on zmq and then didn't leave some dependencies behind. Since commander is one of the first that are loaded, that's the first to error. Open to digging further.\nWhat OS are you on?\nWhat's the output of node --version?\n. Alright, this is all set!\nThere are some massive improvements that can be made to the reducers here. I was aiming for correctness first, hand-tuning afterward.\n. These are all things I missed during the Immutable refactor because they weren't tested (there's coverage, though it doesn't appear to be checking the logic).\n. How's this work UI/UX wise?\nMakes me think we'll want to make this into an observable action later, for the way we use it. I'm guessing for slow startup languages like Julia we'll want to show to the user it's still warming up.\n. Sounds good!\n. Slick, this is working quite well. Thank you!\n. That's definitely the approach for history! The extra detail we run into is that not all of the document is intended to be undo-able (primarily outputs).\n. Happy to review soon, looks like you'll need a rebase. It would be cool if you squash the merge commits as well.\n. We're all set here then? Exciting! I'll go ahead and pull the trigger!\n. Sadly the animation will pause as soon as any synchronous code is run cough require. We tried getting around this before with no luck. Since our policy is to merge with positive intent, I'll bring it straight in for now.\n. Thanks for contributing this! Once you get it up and running with node 6 (from #512), or using electron-rebuild, let me know how this works out for you and if you have a new solution. Much thanks for taking the time to make a PR!\n. Yep, we're on node 6 because we're using Electron 1.1.1. The reason it fails is because of our one native module, zmq. There is another workaround that we could add in, using electron-rebuild.\n. Markdown cells are working again yet cells are not.\n/cc @jdfreder @lgeiger \n. Ohhhhh, we should switch that over then. Thanks for digging into it.\n. Thanks! That will help when I convert the app state to immutable.\n. Yusssss I dooooo\n. This only keeps the app state as a Record before the first reduction. It's a normal object after (need to change all the reducers too).\n. (I'll tackle this right now, amusingly I have this in a branch too).\n. Now we await news from Travis and CodeCov!\n. Oh wait, tests pass yet the app is not running locally. Hit the pause button on this one for a bit.\n. Back and forth, ready to go now. Rebased this down to more sensible commits while I was at it.\n. This also fixes a bug where the filename state wasn't properly updating in the title. Hoorah!\n. Good catch codecov!\n. Cool, looking good.\n. Closing in favor of #578 \n. If you split this component into dumb and smart components, you can test with the dumb component + enzyme much more simply (full control of context, props, etc.).\nIf it makes sense, I'd keep the default export:\nexport default connect(mapStateToProps)(Toolbar)\nWhile also exporting Toolbar as DumbToolbar (or some other name like UnconnectedToolbar).\n. On a totally separate note, if I saw the :zap: I would have no idea what that was for. We can put it in for now (as the background engineering needed to be done), while I think that several of the other cell actions should be in a dropdown menu ... with readable text (no requiring hover).\n. It's ok about the uncertainty with Windows. What does jupyter/notebook do?\n. > There is probably a way to clean this up and limit the amount of code duplication that is going on across these two files but I can't think of any at the moment.\nAll good, I'll happily play with refactoring this later.\n. I'll figure out the functional test issues now, trying out spectron.\n. > chicka, chi-kaah\n. That appears to come from codecov, which is a dev dependency. There's a semi-recent PR to clean that up, though I don't think we're going to see a fix land anytime soon:\nhttps://github.com/codecov/codecov-node/pull/14\n. By the way, if you become successful in installing this and running it on Windows I will be super thrilled. I cleared through some of the hurdles for install on my Windows machine as written about in #388, haven't gotten the whole way through.\nSeparately, I made a PR to remove the execSync package from use in codecov in PR https://github.com/codecov/codecov-node/pull/22.\n. Alright, codecov (node version) and therefore execSync are now gone from our packages. Can you try again and let me know how it goes? On a separate note, you'll need to use node 6 when building nteract.\n. If you want to try an alternate route, you can test out electron-rebuild, which should hopefully build it for the right version of Electron.\n. From the current clone that you have, try out:\nnpm install --save-dev electron-prebuilt\n.\\node_modules\\.bin\\electron-rebuild.cmd\n. We found out there was a mismatch for later versions of electron-rebuild that affected the binaries for node zmq, including on Windows. We've gone back to a stable version. However, the state of our node zmq prebuilt setup is now written such that you probably can't get the Windows build working right out of the box. Since you were able to get it to work in the past, I'd love to pair with you so that this is done well for all Windows users.\n. We've now got a shipped release for Windows as well as testing on Windows and a plan for the future with building on Windows. I'll go ahead and close this. Feel free to re-open if the core problem is still there.\n. Not quite yet, though I'm planning to work on that myself. We'll likely export more components from this repository (or bring them out) so you can put together what you want.\nIf you're open to exploring it, I'd love to work together.\n. Closing as duplicate of #301.\n. Just an update -- there is now a web version of nteract that runs on top of the jupyter server. You can try it out on binder!\nThe jupyter extension is called nteract_on_jupyter on PyPI and there are install instructions here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/applications/jupyter-extension\nBeyond that, there are related packages for building your own using @nteract/core. I don't think the API is stable yet, so you'd have to build along with us.. I'll merge it as is and look forward to you addressing the rest.\n. You should move these over to the functional suite or an integration suite, since no replacement (proper mocks, better stubs) is provided here.\n. Going ahead and merging since the test is passing for now. I'm assuming you'll follow up with moving it to functional or mocking later.\n. What's up with that cell hover state problem? Is the new component grabbing events needed elsewhere?\n. Super sweet by the way, loving it.\n. May want to rebase with the new setup now that #543 has been merged.\n. YaY!\n. I'd check that the copy action was dispatch (using sinon spies or otherwise). Checking state will work for now if it at least gets the coverage though.\n. Well this is awesome.\n. Is this still WIP?\n. This was BSD in the past and the most likely if we were to shift licenses again.\nWhat's your intended use? What do you want to build?\n. @sirinath Go ahead and create a checklist of all the authors in this issue and ask for their approval in changing the license. You can count me as a \ud83d\udc4d already.\nBear in mind that one reason that we're on MPL 2.0 (aside from the license itself) is that it's part of our contribution contract: C4. We'll need to adapt that as well.\n. #836\n. Since the relevant tests are passing and it's the kernel lifecycle tests that are failing, I've gone ahead and merged this.\n. /cc #1, #59, #416, #452 \n. I just packaged a release and am running into this issue:\nUncaught Exception:\nTypeError: Path must be a string.

Same thing if I run the nteract app with a file. Digging into it now.\n.  It's only happening for me on the version built with our npm run dist:osx setup. I'm beginning to think this is an issue of the electron version we're on right now, based on my debugging. Since we need to get up to date anyways, I'm going to try updating electron.\n. Another component I think we'll want to bring into here is enchannel-zmq-backend as well as spawnteract (I'm guessing we'd make it based off of spawn-rx in here). jupyter-paths can likely stay separate though.\nI've updated the issue description with this great article too: http://www.macwright.org/2016/07/08/lerna-npm-organizations-new-wave-modularity.html\nSoon I'll provide a better outline of what we can do collectively. We'll likely want to turn our redux / context focused components into components that accept callbacks (onExecute, etc.). Here's how mapbox-gl-js organized it: https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/3656. Wish I had noticed this before:\n\nYou can use lerna import <package> to transfer an existing package into your Lerna repository; this command will preserve the commit history. lerna import <package> takes a local path rather than a URL. In this case you will need to have the repo you wish to link to on your file system.\n\nCould have used that rather than the way we did it in the rush for time.. Closing this since we're now in a good setup with lerna.. https://twitter.com/paulcbetts/status/755530992379568128\n. Now that the WIP has been taken off and the tests are passing, is it ready for a merge?\n. \ud83c\udf70 \n. Let's go with it for now. I have a feeling there's still going to be an issue because our npm run start args are longer than when it's packaged and run with electron.\n\u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n. It's working locally for me here.\nEDIT: Well, since I'm specifying a notebook directly.\n. > Yea I was trying to say that that's wrong. It prints out to the terminal just fine.\nIt does indeed! However, our linting config explicitly forbids the use of console.log, causing Travis to return a big ugly \u274c. The options to get around this include:\n- using console.warn\n- using console.error\n- popping up a dialog box using native electron APIs\n- using eslint disable line\nHowever, all use of console should likely be forbidden in the main process as you can only see this when launching nteract from the command line (my comment will make more sense when you're using the built app).\n. :shipit:\n. At the very least, you can add the icon for our new BrowserWindow call following the native image doc. You'll want to case it off so that on windows it uses the .ico and on linux it uses .png (or so I suspect).\n. I'm going to assume yes, which means we'll find out soon.\n. Yes please! :bow:\n. Interesting. Any way of pulling this up?\n. If something fails catastrophically, it seems like reductions stop happening. We need some \"oh shit\" mode here.\n. On a separate note, our lint runs shouldn't have to install a kernel (let alone zmq + everything else). ;)\n. Interesting.\nError: Module version mismatch. Expected 48, got 49.\nConsidering the node 6.x series has ABI 48 I don't see how electron now has 49 unless they're pulling from master or the future (7.x).\nI'll get this working later on. Shelve this for now.\n. Sure enough, others are running into this: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-prebuilt/issues/172\n. Ruh roh. More work to do here.\n\nhttp://redux-observable.js.org/docs/FAQ.html#why-were-thunkservables-deprecated\n. Need to rework the epics next...\n. Woo! Glad to be bringing this back in.\nIn order to make the test suite run here (and nteract to boot up), you'll need these changes:\ndiff\ndiff --git a/package.json b/package.json\nindex 6295c7c..e4969e4 100644\n--- a/package.json\n+++ b/package.json\n@@ -60,6 +60,7 @@\n     \"immutable\": \"^3.7.6\",\n     \"jupyter-js-widgets\": \"^1.1.1\",\n     \"kernelspecs\": \"^1.0.1\",\n+    \"lodash.difference\": \"^4.4.0\",\n     \"mathjax-electron\": \"^1.0.0\",\n     \"normalize.css\": \"^4.2.0\",\n     \"nteract-assets\": \"^2.0.0\",\ndiff --git a/src/notebook/widgets/manager.js b/src/notebook/widgets/manager.js\nindex 61ba7bb..736683e 100644\n--- a/src/notebook/widgets/manager.js\n+++ b/src/notebook/widgets/manager.js\n@@ -92,10 +92,7 @@ export class WidgetManager extends ManagerBase {\n   callbacks(view) {\n     const callbacks = super.callbacks(view);\n     this.lastTouchView = view || this.lastTouchView;\n-    return {\n-      ...callbacks,\n-      cellId: view.options.cellId,\n-    };\n+    return Object.assign({}, callbacks, { cellId: view.options.cellId });\n   }\n }\nIn order to get widgets all the way working, I think we need to upgrade from our thunkservables to epics (redux-observable went through some changes).\n.

I learned quite a bit and it evolved both the comms implementation here as well as specifications for the future.\n. Just a linting fix needed, I'll merge and do it myself.\n. Thanks for this!\n. An alternative \"derived\" approach would be to treat the \"is it modified\" as a view that updates based on if state.notebook is the same as the previous state.notebook (kind of like a shouldComponentUpdate).

Are you suggesting https://github.com/trxcllnt/rxjs-fs or a different one?\nTackling this now that I've done a separate project with redux-observable and proper epics+actions.\n. This is now all done!\n. Thanks again @jayphelps, filing this gave me the direction and extra motivation to finish this off quickly.\n. Of note from #574 - since the notebook document tree is immutable we could be comparing past and previous tree instead of watching actions (some of which we might miss). This should greatly simplify the code and maintenance.\n. Closed by #815 and #821.\n. Woo!\n. Time to make another nteract alpha release!\n. I'll make a signed release later tonight or tomorrow morning. Thanks much @captainsafia!\n. In a complete reversal, I've downgraded electron prebuilt at the advice of @mafintosh and @maxogden.\n. \nForgot to note why certain ones here won't be upgraded:\n- We are pinned to commonmark 0.24.0 because of our commonmark React component\n- We're using 1.1.3 of electron prebuilt until https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/5851 is resolved\n- We need to upgrade to epics for redux-observable 0.9\nThe only one we can take action on right now is the epics and redux-observable.\n. The commonmark and epics issues mentioned are complete. Now just waiting on electron/electron#5851.\n. Enabled greenkeeper and declining the first PR since I know these break things!\n. I'm cool with it, we can always decline these PRs and then do them manually when they make sense.\n. ohhhh, this issue is related to the fact that it's not upgrading the config and eslint at the same time.\n. PR incoming.\n. eslint-config-airbnb@10.0.0 && eslint@3.2.0 \u2705 \neslint-config-airbnb@10.0.1 && eslint@3.2.0 \u274c \nThat sure seems like breaking semver to me (within eslint-config-airbnb).\n. Thanks @jdfreder! \n. You got this one @greenkeeperio-bot!\n. There's a bit of linting touch up necessary here as well as a failing test from what looks to be related components:\n3 failing\n  1) Cell handleKeyDown sets ctrlDown properly:\n     AssertionError: expected undefined to be false\n      at Context.it (cell-spec.js:47:5)\n  2) Cell handleKeyUp responds properly to Ctrl + C:\n     TypeError: Attempted to wrap undefined property copyCell as function\n      at Object.wrapMethod (node_modules/sinon/lib/sinon/util/core.js:106:29)\n      at Object.spy (node_modules/sinon/lib/sinon/spy.js:41:26)\n      at Context.it (cell-spec.js:58:23)\n  3) Cell handleKeyUp responds properly to Ctrl + V:\n     TypeError: Attempted to wrap undefined property pasteCell as function\n      at Object.wrapMethod (node_modules/sinon/lib/sinon/util/core.js:106:29)\n      at Object.spy (node_modules/sinon/lib/sinon/spy.js:41:26)\n      at Context.it (cell-spec.js:72:23)\n. Tests pass and coverage is down on the project. That's OK though, as we'll seek to make this better after (as discussed in #613). \n. > I'm a registered member of the Green Party - does that count?\nYour PRs for green keeping are given greater credence than the bot.\n. Oops.\nindex.html:56 Uncaught TypeError: require(...).inject is not a function\nOur version of Electron doesn't work with the React dev tools. @captainsafia totally told me about this. Sad \ud83d\udc3c \n. It's expecting define to be set because it's relying on the (jupyter) notebook to be using requirejs. /cc @jdfreder \n. Closing this one since we have native support for it and other data types directly.\n. Derp. Looks like I fixed it by... fixing it.\n. Good job \ud83e\udd16\n. Re-kicked the build, looking good now.\n. I figured this would drop coverage. If I test 14 lines I can make this pass. Sure why not, I'll go for it.\n. \ud83d\ude01 \n. It's ok if coverage drops. I promise to help with those tests since I'm cleaning up execution right now.\n. This is now fixed, yet now I can't copy cells (was only trying for fun).\n. Assigning @captainsafia though @jdetle is happy to pair on this one.\n. Whoa, do we still have these cases still out and about for our epics logic?. The coverage drop is insignificant and a little bit expected.\n. Very legitimate.\nOn a first usage, would you say it's fair to pick the first kernel we see and from there on users can pick a default kernel?\n. This was \"done\" in #763 as a useful side effect of our app startup. Still want to think on configuring the default kernel as well as the order (we're currently at the mercy of Object.keys, which means we're at the mercy of property order).\n. @captainsafia - here's a good one to add to the new config setup - default kernel (by name)\n. So awesome. Thank you.\n. I'll go ahead and call this closed. I don't think it needs to be in an epic, it's local state to the focused codemirror and largely based on codemirror events.\n. Slickkkkkkkkk\n. Amusingly, this un-does outputs and numbering which should likely be atomic.\n. Another quirk: because of cell focus, this will only undo until it focuses a codemirror cell which then switches to the undo/redo of the codemirror cell itself.\n. > Yeah, I was debating whether or not to add those actions to the exclude list.\nAt the very least, since I know how the app works it's kind of hilarious to play with code like:\npython\nimport time\nfor ii in range(20):\n  print(ii)\n  time.sleep(1)\n. Well this rebase sure got ugly.\n. If I don't rebase, it works out just fine. If I do rebase, even with a reword, git has a bit of a fit. Worth noting that to do this merger I had to use --allow-unrelated-histories with git. Messy.\n. Not going to do this directly.\n. Will be superseded by #638 \n. Done in #649. \n. Thanks for alerting on this one Min, this also addresses the issue with new kernels launched from the \"language\" menu.\n. Addressed the linting in 3a52d60aab74418c0a8e872748b6b39aaf6b7ccd.\n. Thanks Min!\n. This makes me realize we were operating on the wrong version of the format I think. The top level structure for this metadata should be:\njs\n{\n  \"metadata\" : {\n    \"kernel_info\": {\n        # if kernel_info is defined, its name field is required.\n        \"name\" : \"the name of the kernel\"\n    },\n    \"language_info\": {\n        # if language_info is defined, its name field is required.\n        \"name\" : \"the programming language of the kernel\",\n        \"version\": \"the version of the language\",\n        \"codemirror_mode\": \"The name of the codemirror mode to use [optional]\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"nbformat\": 4,\n  \"nbformat_minor\": 0,\n  \"cells\" : [\n      # list of cell dictionaries, see below\n  ],\n}\n. > Can you add some tests?\nCan do, captain.\n. Someday later I'll want to check out why we were setting (and reading) kernelspec in the metadata... That wasn't an old notebook format thing was it?\n. Closes #639.\n. Sounds like a good way to start approaching it.\n. > we'll just make it so that the toolbar is always visible\n\ud83d\udc4d \n\nAdditionally, the context menu will be set as a dropdown on the toolbar.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d \n. > It appears that the issue is with the role feature in Electron. I'm not sure if this is due to some electron upgrade. I don't think we've made any recently.\nWe did revert to an old version due to issues with native modules and the more recent versions of electron.\n. That seems fine to me. I'd like to rely on less local state and have less reliance on hover in general.\n. Woo!\n. Nope, let's use it!\n. This has definitely been fully fixed by handling a buffer of open-file events directly and comparing with args after.\n. Might as well cc @mathisonian. \ud83d\udc83 \n. ~~Ok yuck, loading victory.ipynb is kind of weird because our field is pure JSON. Checking that out so y'all can play.~~ Fixed\n. \nUpdate: fixed!\n. I'll fix that in commutable so that JSON can be included as is. That's what the notebook format spec says anyways. https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_description.html#display-data\nNeed to fix cleanMultiline.\n. Fixed the commutable library up. This is good to play with and run locally with either:\nnpm run start victory.ipynb\nor with the redux logger enabled:\nNODE_ENV=development npm run start victory.ipynb\n. \n. Now with props passthrough!\n\n. \n. My hokey little victorize function could really do with auto-determining label names and other bits from data frames for plotting with Victory. Totally out of scope for this PR, more of a mantle to be taken up by the Python library that chooses to implement this.\n. Since we really need a spec for both sides here and it was fairly ad-hoc from me I'll go ahead and close this. Still awesome. Cool if someone wants to pick the mantle back up.\n. I'll rebase this one and hopefully get it working soon. \ud83d\ude04 \n. Since this one needs rebasing, a good bit of work, and we have another transform in I'll leave this one on the backburner for now.\n. :boom: This is beautiful! \ud83d\udc4d \n. > A thin representation of the cell would replace null on this line, right?\nYeah, that's where the thin cell would go.\n\nWould you like both of the suggestions for fixes to be implemented?\n\nMy initial read on this issue is that the menu one is far easier and will be the most stable to deal with. We should have the menu option no matter what - it's a failsafe with a single event to unhide everything.\n\nFor the thin representation, should the toolbar show up on hover so you can toggle the visibility again?\n\nYeah, I think so. I'm not sure of the best approach -- it's ok to iterate on the design.\n. You're right, this is handled across all the themes. We can close this issue.\nIt still seems a bit off, in terms of typography and outline.\n\nThat's a further refinement though.\n. What jumps out at me is that the borders don't match the soft glow of the cells and the menu is pure white.\n. Try borderless\n. I've been thinking lately about passing comms in as a Subject for a display/transform:\njsx\n<InteractiveMap\n  data={data} // raw data from a mimebundle that targets the mimetype of this display\n  comms={comms} // Two way binding for pure comms messages (with Observables)\n/>\nIt would be a two-way binding to send and receive comm messages.\nPerhaps the surface should be wider for what you can listen to/operate on. Perhaps it's context, not props. \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Researching it over the coming months.\n. Related exploration: https://github.com/rgbkrk/synchronized-object-diff-spec\n. Also related: #840\n. We've got a decent path for this and the answer is not extensibility. For application developers (us), we configure the transforms we want, passing them in at the top level.. Only opening this branch to store off for reference. I'll close it after Travis finishes.\n. Added some notes about how to test the other new bits being introduced here.\n. Woot!\n. Not quite, I ended up resorting to switching to electron-mocha which breaks coverage reporting.\n. Now it's ready @jdetle!\n. At least only one chainsaw is on fire.\n. I wonder when/how the inputs broke for classic mode.\n. I seriously have no idea why Travis is not behaving well today. Since these are just CSS changes that don't affect our CSS structure (which is specced), I'm going to go ahead and merge.\n. This is perfect!\n. Travis is being super flakey today. Merging, I think this is solid.\n. You got that right!\nConsidering we have to support the shortcuts we choose in the long run, what's the reasoning for this key set?\n. It just now occurred to me this is the same keybinding as incognito mode in Chrome.\n. I'm calling cmd-shift-p for default publish, leaving normal cmd-p for printing.\n. Don't merge me yet!\n. Busting cache to make sure.\n. Good thing I busted the cache!\n. Ah, the issue lies with the gl module that plotly incidentally requires.\n. This is good to go now!\n. This is SO awesome.\n. \n. Slick and easy!\n\n. :boom: Most excellent.\n. Oops! Just realized the media type should be application/vnd.geo+json. I'll make a follow-on PR.\n. This one is no longer relevant with the React error boundaries we implemented. Closing!. Included the license in the notebook. This is good to go.\n. > If you want to avoid the extra unnecessary render, you can extend constructor instead and perform your logic / state setting there.\nInteresting. When does the extra render happen here?\n. Ah yeah, we're not doing any setState in cDM here (it was in cWM before). Thanks for the tip!\n. Closing in favor of #702. Thank you @greenkeeperio-bot, you're one of my favorite bots.\n. Re-kicked the one failed build, a-ok to merge now.\n. I haven't looked into it yet, worth investigating a design for it here.\n. We respect the metadata if it was already on a notebook document, we don't have any UI to control it though.\n. Cool, yeah, we're certainly open to having the slides.\n. > Gonna try and include tests for our epics in this as well. Reading up on it now.\nHow about just keeping this as new focus cell tests and making a new PR?\n. :tada: Thank you @aleury!\n. Whoa, fetching your remote now.\n. Are you planning on coming back to this one or should we close it for now?\n. Still going after this or should we close it?\n. I just noticed I made the same comment 30 days ago so I'll go ahead and close this. Feel free to come back to it any time @philpl. Thanks!\n. Yay!\nSomething else from chat discovered by @lgeiger: electron-packager doesn't grab the prebuilds for the target machine - the OS X zmq prebuilt was packaged with the Linux version.\nSolution (if I do the next release): build it in Docker\n. Such a great suite of tests, thanks @captainsafia!\n. I'm guessing we only want to apply this to some output types, happy to test with some of my notebooks.\n. Note: we'll also need to make sure these don't end up in the serialized notebook (on disk).\n. Awesome! I'll have to check out the move cell tests soon.\n. @captainsafia your choice, we'll just make it consistent. I prefer the kabob case on files. The _spec you see in the wild is \"mostly historical\", coming from RSpec.\n. You're on :fire:!!!\n. Ok, I've cleaned up a lot of this. Need to update my todo list above.\n. Just wait until you see how fast the app boots now!\n. Going to let CodeCov finish the next cycle and then see if there are other tests I can instrument.\n. Once codecov updates again, this is ready to go. I need to do some thinking on how to do duplicate notebook.\n. Incredibly great cleanup and fix here. \ud83d\udc4d \n. I like that text!\n. Maybe swap:\n\nrelaunch the kernel to synchronize it with the new location of your notebook?\n\nwith\n\nlaunch a new kernel to synchronize it with the new location of your notebook?\n. Aiming for simple language, another revision:\nlaunch a new kernel to match it with the location of your notebook?\n. > launch a new kernel to match the directory with that of your notebook?\n. ok awesome, that looks great\n. Heh, not much. Clearly not really testing anything other than \"can it be run?\".\n. \n. Hopefully this didn't break codecov... Please report back codecov, I miss you.\n. Getting us out of the D brigade!\n. Alright, this is good to go!\n. Amusingly, we don't actually use this code anywhere - it's part of the setup for the widgets.\n. Yuck.\n\nThe CSS part is definitely new contributor friendly.\nThe long term typeahead fixes likely are not as they involve either a custom component (might be the wisest) or digging deeply into CodeMirror.\n. I've done the digging into the long term typeahead fixes and worked with a coworker on helping him patch this. Hopefully we'll see something soon.\n. Luckily I'll be shipping a new release today!\n. We now have a conformance test that runs on Travis and our further flow typing is ensuring consistency at build time (at the very least). I'll go ahead and close this for now.. \ud83d\udcd4 \n. Awesome!\nAs for the latex rendering flicker, we can probably make that a lot cleaner by actually coordinating with MathJax. Our LaTeX render is a bit greedy right now.\n. I'm not a fan of using the input/output semantics here, hiding the \"input\" on markdown seems weird - it is the text after all. We default to render when not in render mode after.\n. > nbd I just increased coverage by 2% 0.o\nand then... not?\n. Codecov so silly.\nYou have a wonderful day too John!\n. That was totally me, wasn't it? Thanks @captainsafia!\n. :bow: \ud83c\udf62\n. Amusingly, I'll bet this increases code coverage. I'll be writing some tests now.\n. whoa whoa, I'm deep in tests, it's cool\n. \u2757 \n. You'll need to rebase this one since #751 conflicted.\n. Ok, there we go.\n. Hey there! Great to hear your interest.\nJupyterLab already has a notebook plugin. What does nteract's notebook solve that is not addressed in JupyterLab's notebook?\n. The nteract desktop app's primary goal is to only serve as an editor for notebook files. This means that you have to use a text editor for your non-notebook scripts, a native terminal for the terminal experience, and your native OS file manager for navigating.\nIf you want a desktop app for JupyterLab itself, you should push for them to make an Electron app or lend a hand with them to package up an Electron app (what nteract relies on).. Closing since we're heading towards a path for shipping the components for a web app version (see #1346), which someone can use to build a jupyterlab plugin. . Whoa, whoa that's above and beyond man.\n. GPG and 2FA are completely unrelated.\n2FA is for login verification.\n. This has now been done.\n. Since I had to rebase on top of changes from #761, I re-used the kernelspecs promise to launch the default notebook based on what's available. I could still make the default Python3 but this seems sensible. My default is now 2... Dun dun dunnnnnnn.\n. This should increase coverage by 0.026%. \ud83d\udc45 \n. Fine codecov, fine.\n. Woohoo!\n. :shipit: \nWell done y'all.\n. Oh that's the extra jank I'm seeing on the outside of the map in #770.\n. This was fixed recently wasn't it?\n. Yeah this was totally fixed.\n. @prafful002 Since you've posted the same across several issues - pick one, make a pull request, then we close the issue.\n. Yes\n. Thanks again @jkornblum!\n. We'll still need to remove these from the saved notebook too, otherwise jupyter won't be able to open it (probably worth checking on this).\n. > Oh drat! Totally forgot about that. Let me fix that.\nAll good. Probably worth noting that I think you can do this in nteract, making sure to use the same function in both saveNotebook and publishing.\n. I actually forsee us having other changes to the in-memory model here that we may want to keep experimenting with them here until we're sure about changing the interface in commutable.\n. It's ok if we go with undef, one of these days we'll want to remove some of our escape hatches and line up with upstream (if it makes sense).\n. > Do you mean if you were trying to Save As an already Saved Notebook the Save As dialog show default to the path of its previous filename as opposed to the home directory?\nOh yeah, that's one of them. I went ahead and merged so we can iterate on this and get a feel for good defaults (or write logic to detect what we should be doing).\n. Awesome!\n. Sheesh Safia, I thought you wanted to be at 80% by today -- not 38.24%!\n. Yikes! I didn't want to freak you out. I was joking about codecov being odd.\n. Might as well rebate out the executeSpec if it's going to show a revert. It's not like we've already merged this.\n. Oh whoop, I included the dep bumps in here too. Certainly working well. \ud83d\udc83 \n. We can go with this for now, then we can adapt to what atom does for launch.\n. Awesome, love it.\n. Wow, um. What's going on with coverage?\n. Reproduction steps:\n- Open a new notebook (npm run start in dev for example)\n- command-s (to save)\n- Error notification pops up\nNote that saveAs totally works fine. It's the \"whoa we can't save, let's saveas case\", which is triggered by save.\n. Wow, an increase of 42.84% in one commit! :wink:\nThanks for coming back to fix this.\n. > be mindful of how frequently pushes are made\nYeah I think people will keep pushing regardless. I actually like the updating comment feature, I wish it just somehow informed you about updates.\n. I seriously need a video recording of cell drag and drop on linux. It's hilarious. It does the strangest thing. As you move the mouse, the [ ] get bigger and bigger. It works fine though.\n. Oh you know what, it's not the [ ] itself, but the surrounding padding (margin?) around it. The most laughable bug I've seen in nteract so far.\n. Not sure if it matters, but I'm running Linux off a bootable USB drive on a Mac.\n. Oh wait, this is on master for OS X too. Something changed with the CSS.\n. \n. Thanks!\n. Awesome, this is exactly what we needed for a fresh notebook.\n. Wish the spammy collapsed if it's the same message.\n. Sure does! Thanks.\n. Nice, glad you only needed an electron dialog.\n. > Not sure how to test triggerKernelRefresh yet.\nMock dialog, ensure that showMessageBox is called with question and that (for now at least) 'Launch New Kernel' is the first button.\nFor the next part, I might make it so that dispatchRestartKernel dispatches a RESTART_KERNEL action. Then, you'd have an epic that listens for that kernel restart which sends off the kill kernel and new kernel actions.\n. I'll go ahead and merge this even with the slight drop in project coverage. There's a plan above we can come back to for closing in on these tests.\n. Improving test coverage ever so slightly. Originally I started this off as a refactor to make this an epic. @captainsafia wanted to have me post this even though I was going to toss the branch.\n. Should we do the little output notch that's in Jupyter notebook or something else?\nDefault to big or default to small and expect the user to expand it?\nI lean on the side of full output and a simple way to collapse.\n. As a user, for the tables I work with, I always have to click to expand that. Drives me bonkers, makes me feel constrained.\n. > it should be at the top of the cell instead of at the side.\nThat's what I thought too, but what do you do when you're halfway through a long cell and you \"just want it to go away\"?\nI guess I'd hit \"up\" and then click the collapse.\n. Wow. Thank you so much for writing this up with such great detail. I'm extremely frustrated with this behavior too.\n\nWhat if running a cell didn't adjust the scroll position?\n\nWe could do that. On first pass, that's the easiest for us to do - rip out the current scroll behavior.\nStep 2 if we want a version of this that is a little bit more intelligent: We do actually know when outputs will finish coming in for most kernels based on the busy --> idle response from the kernel. The scroll handling is some of our oldest code that hasn't been through a refactor. \n. Thank you so much for reporting these in such great detail. It beats my light reports, so I'll stick this on the beta milestone too.\n. Done in #1167.\n. Actually, this discussion has more nuance, re-opening.\n. /cc @peggyrayzis \n. Closed by #1046\n. Yikes. Definitely not your fault.\nThat's happening on launch, let me give the release a try again now that I'm on a different machine.\n. This release works when you run it from the CLI like open ~/Downloads/nteract-darwin-x64/nteract.app, yet not when opened from the icon. Admittedly, that's the only way I tested it after I made the release. \ud83d\ude22 \n. This also has an annoying bug of only failing on the first launch from the app icon.\n. I'd really love to see a spec form from the widgets dedicated to object synchronization from JS <--> kernel before tackling widgets again (we had support for it for a little while then took it out).\n. Basically, I'd love to see widgets carved up in to separate pieces that are currently unsolved specifications:\n- Object Synchronization over the messaging protocol\n- Frontend asset loading (or expectations)\n- UI toolkit\nI realize that ipywidgets has an implementation of these, all in one (slightly by necessity), and that there were IPEPs and implementations in flux (as a writer of a custom DOMWidget, I felt that pain).\n. My current thinking on synchronized objects.\n. Wow @jdetle I found out something weird that \"explains\" what's happening. I went ahead and created a release with some more logging with the arguments and this is what they were:\n[ '/Users/kylek/Downloads/nteract-darwin-x64/nteract.app/Contents/MacOS/nteract',\n  '-psn_0_8046508' ]\nOnly shows up on first launch. It makes me think it's a launchctl thing on OS X. \n\u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n. Tempting to go ahead and do a regex to ensure the paths given are sane. We should also be checking that the files exist from the main process too. Anyways, PR incoming.\n. This is apparently the Process Serial Number and we only see it on first launch.\n. Note: I left some other logging in that will end up in ~/Library/Logs/nteract/ in case we want to debug this further later. Happy to take it out, and we should take this out before the beta.\n. psn everywhere\n$ ps aux | grep psn\nkylek             490   2.1  0.8  3948660 128720   ??

Should we turn our aggressive typeahead off?\nAlso, if you feel liking daring into our hackery for triggering autocomplete based on change events, it's here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/src/notebook/components/cell/editor/index.js#L106-L115\nThat's admittedly some of the sketchiest code here, very heuristic driven.\n. Are you trying to start a fire with 3 spaces?\nThe rub is going to be that \"most\" JS is 2 spaces and \"most\" Python is 4 spaces.\nWe definitely need to have our own CodeMirror config. Sounds like I need to lay the foundations for the config file and you can make the codemirror setup part of that. Want to start figuring out what we'll need to pass through for a CodeMirror config that is JSON serializable?\n. Whoa whoa, @captainsafia is the captain.\n. I think it's ok for you to start proving out what the top level config is in the app, which can later assume we'll load it from a JSON file on disk.\n. @jdetle do you have a fix that can be put in place without doing the custom config setup?\n. Fixed in https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/873.\n. A new release just went out, let us know how it is @chriddyp!\n. Nevermind! We do. We just haven't been passing it to transforms.\n. @captainsafia @jdetle What do you think of this? I'm inevitably lowering coverage a bit for code we can't test without setting an environment variable.\n. Totally agree about the RC or later sentiment.\n. I think with where things are now, we could run autosave with an epic that is just emitting the save event every N seconds or so, assuming they've already saved at least once (or we opened a saved file).. That's looking goooood.\n. I'll check out what's up with coverage before merging. Excellent stuff here. This means we can go back to the native document title, which comes complete with a few other niceties.\n. Absolute coverage decreased but relative coverage increased. This is due to how much code was here before that was tested (yet way verbose).\n. :boom: Thank you! :boom:\n. Welcome to the nteract party!\n. Open to exploring it, even if a bit ugly. It only has to be cased off for Darwin though, which is nice.\n. Yup, we'd love it.\n. Closed by #842!\nVerified this works with a packaged app.\nStartup is a bit slower (to be expected). Probably a good time to make a standalone watermark BrowserWindow with the animated logo.\n. This is all set now. I opted not to case off using platform and instead use property checking so it's easier to test (yay for coverage when testing on Linux).\n. A generic remote kernel would have to implement these functions (TBD: how these are named, loaded):\n- getKernelspecs() : Promise<KernelSpecs>\n- newKernelObservable(kernelSpecName: string, cwd: string): Rx.Observable<Kernel>\nWhere Kernel is an Object with these fields:\n{\n  channels: Rx.Subject // just like our ZMQ one, can be over websockets using a WebSocketSubject\n  kernelSpec: string // to have again while using this observable\n  kernelSpecName,\n}\nAt least in nteract right now we also have connectionFile and spawn (child process), when it should probably be some sort of cleanup function (?).\n. This side-steps auth, which we'll need to think on for all the remote cases.\nPerhaps the Observable has access to the store (I'd rather it not)?\nSee:\nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/e25986ac4b6269bb468c3e931559a91d9e885d9c/src/notebook/epics/kernel-launch.js#L124\n. Ah, the kernel provisioner. This is intended to be carving out a plugin space (in JS) to interact with remote kernels via nteract.\n. Yeah. Same kernel APIs, which means it can come from the gateway like we planned long ago.\n. While not remote, this is helping me think about non-local-jupyter kernelspecs: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/847\n. Now that our channels (our term for connection and messaging to the kernel) are the same between jupyter and raw zeromq, the only thing that has to be tackled is the UI for this!. Since we now have epics for local vs. remote hosts, the next step for this is Host Discovery and UI.. @fabric-8 it would be really great to have a document icon, likely with our current logo + some representation of a page (like Atom has).\n. All good, we weren't sure if you were too busy @fabric-8. Happy to get an icon whenever, I only opened the issue to request and track it. :smile:\n@temogen - for context - the person who created all our logo assets and site design (nteract.io) is @fabric-8. We're big fans of the fabriverse, having found out about it via @philpl's fluorine:\n\nThat being said, it's totally ok to make mockups @temogen. I've done the same in collaborating with @fabric-8. That's how the notebook cube logo came to be, after iteration.\nOther cool related repos:\n- nteract logos\n- nteract mockups\n. We now ship a basic little icon crafted from our main logo, I'll go ahead and close this.. Great idea!\n. > Number fields should be right-aligned but I have no idea how to do that at the moment.\nThe response back from (e.g. Pandas) would have to provide a CSS class for us to know, if it's a plain HTML table. We have no idea what the type is when we get it back.\n. This is also why I'm interested in a JSON Table schema, because then we can layout according to the actual data not a rendered view after the fact.\n. Seems like we need more margins between some outputs\n\n. From \"trying\" this branch out, we'll want to make sure to use the notification system to display information about being logged in. Either that or... the gutter!\n. Open up a new repo for our oauth server too (even though it just uses github-oauth). We need a reproducible artifact for deployment.\n. Yay buffers.\n\n. This is ready to go for us to be able to use for prototyping, as well as conforming to the spec by closing down comms we don't have a matching target_name for.\n. Woo!\n. Hey @jkornblum. It would be awesome to have your help as a Windows dev. We haven't figured it out yet. The prebuilds work in regular node on Windows, yet not for Electron (for OS X and Linux, we can share the prebuilds).\nHere's our current thread in zmq-prebuilt: https://github.com/nteract/zmq-prebuilt/issues/2\nMore relevant information is at the bottom of the thread.\nI think you should be able to cd into node_modules/zmq-prebuilt and run node-gyp --target=1.1.3 --arch=x64 --dist-url=https://atom.io/download/atom-shell to install the proper bindings. Really happy to pair with you on this.\n. How's this working out now @jkornblum? I'm slightly assuming that since you were able to make a PR that it's much better.\n. Woo, Awesome!\n. Reviewed (with some sections that need testing updates), went ahead and merged since it pushes us ever so forward. \ud83d\ude80 \n. Since we have all the copyright holders for the MPL-code in favor, we can now make a PR to change it.\n. Done.\n. As part of this, if it turns out to get easier to document React components if we're using flow for our proptypes, I'm happy chasing that down.\nGreat presentation that made me realize how wonderful flow + PropTypes can be.\n. Now that we're in less flux I think we could create that presentation. Just plain writing it would likely help firm up the why of the infrastructure. Want to start writing it and see where you get?\nCould even use spectacle to create the presentation. :wink:\n. What's missing here is what a View for these models are and how we handle change events from the UI.\n. \n. \n\n\n. ``\n@jdetle: What falls undermodels`? Data for a visualization? That sort of stuff?\n@rgbkrk: The transient models are associated with comms.\n@jdetle: You say transient because its so dependent on user input / quick to change?\n@rgbkrk: Transient because we don't store it on disk in the notebook format\n@jdetle: Ah\n```\n. I'm going to see about bringing more of this into a new PR and close this one.\n. There's another update we'll likely need in our JSDom configuration for Leaflet. I've created a way to reproduce this easily that I've reported to Leaflet:\nhttps://github.com/rgbkrk/leaflet-issue-reproduction\n. Closing in favor of #872 and later resolution either in our JSDOM setup or upstream in Leaflet.\n. Excellent! Thanks @philpl. This sets us up well for several environment issues we need to work through.\n. Welcome to nteract! :tada:\n. Slick!\n. User Gist makes sense.\n. Now that I've got this working, I'm tempted to move it and all kernelspecs usage to the main thread, only to run once on startup, providing the kernelspecs to all BrowserWindows. The main thread could also watch to see if any environments are deleted or added.\n. Step right up! You have nothing to lose and only something to gain! Conda based kernels! Environment synchronization!\n\nOk, no, startup for the main app is going to become a tad slower while investigating all the conda environments (if you have any). However, running it in the main thread means it's only slow once on app startup.\n. Yeah, it's pretty arbitrary. We can evaluate based on how things work with users. This slows things down for people with conda, who are also likely the ones to want this. If they don't have conda it's really quick, little cost. I feel like the tradeoff here is worth it if we manage it well. It's still < half a second on my machine with many conda environments.\n. Rebased on master now that a bunch of pre-requisites to making this work well are done or outlined.\nStill a WIP, I'm back to hacking on this.\n. Closing since we have part of this implemented for the main process now.\n. wooooooooooooooooow\n. Updated the other babel dep and cleared out our Travis cache.\n. Excellent!\n. Yup, this is great with the dark theme.\n\n. I'm somewhat thinking the bar line should be thinner next, but I could squabble about CSS all day and get nowhere. This is awesome!\n. > This is a good time to run our app through react-a11y.\nMost definitely.\n. From https://medium.com/@addyosmani/accessible-ui-components-for-the-web-39e727101a67#.jbzfgni08:\n. Funny thing though: new notebooks or loading new notebooks won't have a conflicting splash though - they'll be showing the splash for their own loading. Perhaps it's time to think about another loading screen within the notebook window. \ud83d\ude15 \n. Excellent!\n. Thanks for removing this leftover!\n. Oh I bet this is the \"all windows closed when not Darwin\" logic.\n. Resulting from the splash page being closed.\n. Closing in favor of #872 and later resolution either in our JSDOM setup or upstream in Leaflet.\n. Glad you're giving things a go from Linux.\n. In return for being a Linux dev on the project, I promise to keep taking on Windows pain.\n. Not what I want permanently, but it fixes #248 \n. With our current multiplexed channels that keep the session ID and username, I think we're in a good state and this can be closed!. >  is that an overlap with the cell at the bottom and status bar in your video?\nYeah, it's been that way since the status bar was introduced. I assumed you did that on purpose or didn't notice before.\n. > I'm trying to see if there is some combination of operators wherein I can say \"If this is the second time this event is triggered, show the dialog box and then load Google Analytics into the webpage. For all future emissions, just load GA into the webpage.\"\nI'd make this a global \"configuration\" thing, just like our theme setup - rely on electron-json-storage for now until we have a main thread config system. The config for this can likely be:\njson\n{\n  \"hasBeenPrompted\": true,\n  \"send-metrics\": true,\n}\nthen again, you may only need the one field (if this wasn't set up, then we can assume a dialog):\njson\n{\n  \"send-metrics\": true,\n}\n. Created a StackOverflow Question for this issue.\n. Very much needed, I'm going to merge all the find/replace issues in #1817 and close this one.. /cc https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/822\n. If this was nested deeply, that would make sense. This isn't a README for the epics.\n. Oh, thanks. I'm planning to work on this over the weekend so I'll certainly fix up the doc here too.\n. No prob. Figured this was a quick fix while I'm thinking about the store in the main thread (right now thinking on it for the multi kernel specs).\n. This is really awesome.\nIt makes me think we should expose a class name for running cells (and a running notebook in general) -- when I saw the vertical stripes I figured they were for the running cells which would be pretty awesome.\n. Whoa, I love this dimming! It gives the app an entirely different feel - the focus is on the \"active\" cell, which hones you in. I could see myself swapping between themes just for that - the current light and dark themes are great when I'm reading content as a whole, this new theme feels like the right environment for focusing on exactly the code segment I'm in.  So neat to evoke new emotion out of the same environment.\n. There are so many aesthetics in this theme that I wish I had in the dark and light theme: the curved edges on the toolbars, the shadow on the cell toolbar, the color on the pushpin when pinned, the list styling, ...\n. Added a CSS class for running cells in #900!\n. For styling: http://codepen.io/rgbkrk/pen/ALbkPo\n. I'm going to go ahead and close this, will likely make a new PR later.. Done in the referenced issue, #933.\n. That would be so nice, we need a design / mockup to get started on this.. Our frontend background section has a bunch of this that could be moved over into CONTRIBUTING.md\n. @Subway19 is there another issue you would be interested in? Some of this was already completed and I just finished off the rest in #960.\n. /cc @Jaykul who asked about this in Slack.. Thanks for kicking off our flow setup. :D\n. Oh my gosh, thank you! It makes me laugh every time the easy fixes on CodeMirror are just adding addons. This is so great, thank you!\n. It looks like there are a few linting touchups to add on which you can find out by running npm run lint locally or by viewing the travis log for our linting check.\n. Everything else looks spot on here, this definitely closes #816.\n. Awesome! I've updated the title to match the changelog standard we've adopted to promote this as a feature for our next batch of release notes. Thank you so much, this is going to help me and others during the day so much!\nWelcome to the nteract party! \ud83c\udf89 \n. To get around the nteract-assets \"issue\", I ran:\ntouch node_modules/nteract-assets/index.js\nThen was able to run:\nflow-typed install\nflow then runs like a champ:\n$ flow\nLaunching Flow server for /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract\nSpawned flow server (pid=255)\nLogs will go to /private/tmp/flow/zSUserszSkylekzScodezSsrczSgithub.comzSnteractzSnteract.log\nNo errors!\n. With the last nteract-assets update, this is now ready to be used with flow-typed install.\n. Awesome, thanks. In terms of the commit prefix, this should be chore instead of feature since it's not adding a new feature.\n. There is exactly one linting \"issue\" to be adapted here:\n8:3  error  props should be placed after setHoverElement  react/sort-comp\nWhich just means you have to move the props further down in the component (this comes from our AirBnB-styled linting config.\n. As for updating the commit message, if you're comfortable with rebasing feel free. Otherwise, let me know and I'll fix it up while I merge.\n. Ah, yeah. The rebase didn't go very well. I can get it fixed up for you.\nHere's a decent tutorial on likely rebase ways. In particular, you'd want to do an interactive rebase against master.\n. You did the reword part perfectly. What I ran to fix it up (while on your branch):\n$ git rebase -i origin/master\nSuccessfully rebased and updated refs/heads/add-flow-to-cell-creator.\n$ git push -f\n. Awesome, thank you. \nAgain, welcome to the nteract party! \ud83c\udf89 \n. I'd err on the side of making a PR for each. If you end up doing several in one PR, that's ok too.\n. That's a peculiar location for the python3 kernel. Was that installed in a virtualenv?\n. Does the path to that python3 still exist?\n. What's the jupyter notebook report for kernelspecs that are no longer valid.\n. That's ok, seems like something easy to reproduce by writing another direct kernelspec that is invalid.\n. How's this look now for you? The message now bubbles up to a notification.\n. Some unit tests for main are up, I'll go ahead and close this.. Take it while it's hot, feel free to ask questions.\n. It's hard to tell if anyone is working on it without a PR. You're free to explore the space. Make a pull request, even if partially done, and set the title to include [WIP]. People will be happy to help you work through it.\n. On a Mac, this menu is under nteract > About nteract (and in dev mode Electron > About Electron).\n. Luckily we have Help > Release Notes, so I think it's fine that no one is working on this for now.. This is so great.\n\n. By the way, if we've made choices that make it hard to do certain things for styling I'd love to know. This is definitely not my domain area, no matter how much I wish I understood more of it.\n. Oh great, I would hope to be able to apply the CSS for themes afterward. I was unsure how CSS variables behaved. Thank you!\n. Do you think we're ready to pull the trigger on switching to zmq-static?\n. I summon @jdetle to the conversation since I know he both wants new Electron and is closer to the feeling that new contributors face.\n. Since we're actually shipping builds, at the very least it means that trial users can just roll with nteract directly and not have to build from source.\nMy original hesitation to enforce all the build tooling setup was barriers to entry for those that are more on the frontend dev side, less astute with Jupyter.\n. > though that pretty much means reverting this PR\nWe still have to do the rebuild though right?\n. Is there a reasonable way to make zmq-prebuilt rely on zmq-static?\n. I'm only asking that because of the node kernel I've been hacking on - I want to keep it relying on prebuild - it makes install so painless.\n. I need some sort of excited emoji.\n. Woo!\n. Awesome welcome to the nteract party @aleury! :tada:\n. On a separate note, are other people getting 404s for tiles from MapBox? Admittedly, I figured this would come up at some point - where they would reject the client key. There are other tilesets from other vendors available, the potential to include tiles, letting people configure a key, etc.\n. Yeah the notebook diffs are simply me running straight on through to make sure they were updated with the new mime type.\n. Awesome.\n. When I run flow on master now I'm seeing a lot of reports from flow:\n```\n$ npm run flow\n\nnteract@0.0.13 flow /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract\nflow; test $? -eq 0 -o $? -eq 2\n\nsrc/notebook/components/cell/cell-creator-buttons.js:21\n 21:     this.shouldComponentUpdate = PureRenderMixin.shouldComponentUpdate.bind(this);\n              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ property shouldComponentUpdate.

Hey there!\nWe take the approach of relying on native windowing. To put two notebooks next to each other on your screen, open two windows. Each window maps to one file.\nOptions for multi-pane right now include Atom and JupyterLab. The atom plugin for notebooks needs love, and I'm hoping we can tackle it after we've solidifed nteract, likely post-beta.\n. Longer form answers, which is more architectural in nature:\n- nteract can be viewed as a single document editor, where you can double click .ipynb files from your desktop or in search to open them\n- We need a consistent state tree (in terms of the document state) in order to approach real-time collaboration later.\n. You can absolutely ask here! We're not drowning in questions yet - if we ever are, we would probably create an AMA or help repo (a la nodejs/help or jupyter/help).\nThis also is a legitimate feature request, even if I personally think it's out of scope. Thanks for posting!\n. Excellent.\n. Forgot to note - we can declare whatever prefixes we want to use. Right now we're running under the assumption that we're similar to Angular (given what we link to for the conventional changelog standard). For us, a breaking change isn't in terms of the JS APIs but the userland behavior. However, if/when we export our packages then we will have a strict contract of API behavior.\n. I'm guessing the README needs a once-over as well.\n. Prefix should be docs or chore, rather than fix. This doesn't fix a bug.\n. I love regex.\nHowever, we have to take a step back here to understand and resolve the core problem while assisting the user as much as possible. Spaces have a specific meaning in Markdown URLs both in CommonMark and the original Markdown \"spec\":\n\nTo create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text\u2019s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses, put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an optional title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:\nThis is [an example](http://example.com/ \"Title\") inline link.\n[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.\n\nA URL with spaces is not a valid URL. The URL with %20 is URL encoded, quite valid. There is an important reason to support the title attribute - for accessibility and screen readers. This becomes more important when doing links on images from Markdown.\n. In this case, I think the original jupyter notebooks (that I see above) need to be patched to match the markdown standards. If you copy a URL directly in Chrome that has spaces (assuming you're on the page, not that you've just typed it), Chrome copies the URL encoded form of the link.\n. > Sorry my previous response came off as rude, didn't mean it to.\nGosh no, I just didn't want you to think that using regexes themselves were bad. They're one of the fastest features to use in JS (perf wise). When used on the right problems they solve issues with alarming precision.\n. We should probably move some of this discussion to https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat, since this affects the format.\n. Heh, trying this over in http://spec.commonmark.org/dingus/ and it looks like title isn't supported - just rendering raw [stuff](url title)\n. Awesome! Great to see you find out where to dig into the parser here.\n\nWell, one problem: Commonmark is typing these links with spaces as \"text\" and not \"link\", and it's splitting them up into multiple nodes vs. one text node.\n\nOh yuck.\n. That looks like some \\ needs to become / for the directory paths. I'll send a PR your way.. \n. Awesome! I won't update this branch anymore then, I'll leave you to data-science-fu it after.\nMy ideal for getting the data over time -- we're going to have to run a job that continuously polls the releases API and captures this for us.\n. /cc @parente bet you'd be interested in this\n. Welcome!\n\nHere's a list of the remaining Flow errors, I'd be happy to clean them up for you! :)\n\nYes please!\n. We're new to flow, having only started to adopt it this week. I noticed this earlier today and asked @alexandercbooth to see if he could tackle the bits that weren't covered. It's ok with me if you both end up tackling getting that cleaned up.\nWe could enable flow on Travis as well so we'll notice these in advance, which is open as an issue here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/896\n. There's one tiny linting change (which annoyingly happens for each flow PR), related to where props are in the ES6 class. We'll either have to move the props or adapt our linting config.\n. Wow, you are incredible. Thank you.\n. Welcome to the nteract party! :tada:\n. I forgot we even had a watching setup for tests..\n. Reproduction steps:\nLaunch the example intro notebook\nnpm run start example-notebooks/intro.ipynb\nRun\n!pwd\nexample-notebooks is the directory\nRestart the kernel (by menu) and run\n!pwd\nhome directory is the result\n. Thanks for making the note about open-url only working on OS X. Glad you thought through the problem and didn't rely on my misinformation. :wink:\n. Looks like this isn't working for the case I just tried (while also not reporting a good error). I'll see if I can dig in.\n. Awesome, glad that's in now.\nThe next hard problem is making our config be .js instead of .json. :wink: That way we can do the transform registration, etc.\n. By the way, I changed the commit message verb to refactor since a bug wasn't fixed (though it does close an issue). Thanks for tackling this one!\n. Ah, that was mislabeled then. Thanks for pointing that out.\nIt's ok to make a new PR for the feedback, I wouldn't worry about an issue for it.\n. Awesome!\nDid you mean to close this? I'm happy to review it (and be influenced if we should adjust style).\n. Whoa, that is weird... I can't click it either.\n. I wonder if this is related to me locking the branches and settings down. Let me dig...\n. Ah. Look at that tooltip.\nTo a new PR!\n. I posted some questions, but this is good to go - it makes our flow runs pass.\n. Coverage will be getting bumped momentarily.\n. Rebased, we'll let Travis, AppVeyor, and CodeCov crunch on this now. We'll want to update some of this later (flow type annotations, perf), but they're good follow on tasks for just about anyone.\n. Ohhhhh OK, thanks.\n. Do you have any idea why Rx is not showing up in my flow-typed folder:\n```\n$ head flow-typed/npm/rxjs_vx.x.x.js\n// flow-typed signature: 92666ab12556f8797740e7ed3562dae4\n// flow-typed version: <>/rxjs_v^5.0.0-beta.12/flow_v0.33.0\n/\n * This is an autogenerated libdef stub for:\n \n *   'rxjs'\n \n * Fill this stub out by replacing all the any types.\n *\n```\nI see that there are Rx definitions inside of https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed/tree/master/definitions/npm/rxjs_v5.0.x. Is it related to how we pin it?\n. Now that we're in this state, we can probably do https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/896\n. Sweet, this should be pretty simple. I'd start with looking at the text transform:\nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/src/notebook/components/transforms/text.js\nand then import and add it to the list of transforms + display order:\nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/src/notebook/components/transforms/index.js#L21\n. Closes #885.\n. You know, I'm not sure we named lappy. I guess that's lappy's name. It's featured on https://nteract.io/. \n. Awesome!\n. Yup!\n. Went ahead and added on the commit to see if Travis passes.\n. Welp, I made that worse.\n. I just rebased the commit I added on out. :-/\n. Added some linting configuration to handle import type appropriately. Time to see what Travis and AppVeyor think.\n. Is this still WIP? I'm happy to merge it and look forward to your next PRs. \ud83d\ude04  Totally happy to get typing on the Redux code.\n. I'm about to work on some minor refactors on the notebook focus cell mechanics, so I'd love to have all your changes here. I'll go ahead and merge. It's ok to open lots of PRs. :smile:\n. > By the way why aren't the unit tests running on travis as well?\nThe unit tests are run in the coverage group.\n. > Ahhhh this breaks the coverage script since zmq is now compiled for electron but run from within node.\nGah, foiled again. We shouldn't be using real kernels inside of the unit tests so we should get that cleaned up.\n. Trying this out now, Electron is certainly working well!\n. Ok, it looks like tests aren't using kernels directly (thankfully). It's merely trying to resolve the dependency to zmq as part of the overall import that happens.\nI've \"mocked\" enchannel-zmq-backend so that the require \"works\" and the tests can pass.\n. The only thing that scares me now is if any Electron APIs are deprecated. I tried out launching the app, running various menu options, and opening an external link that was within an HTML output.\n. It passes!\n. @nteract/notebook please give this branch a spin and let us know how it is\n. > libzmq is bundled with zmq-prebuilt\nohhhhhhh\nThey only really have hassle with needing Python2 then.\n. > Windows is ready since #903\nYou're too awesome, I forgot.\n. > We could upgrade electron one minor version at a time to see if any deprecation warnings come up.\nNah, let's rip this bandaid off and go with it.\n. And so it is\n. Thanks!\n. This is a feature - it's something new exposed to users.\n. It's ok, not silly at all. Keep asking questions, happy to work with you.\n. Fun fact: PowerShell does not like emoji branch names.\n. /cc @lgeiger \n. That's ok, it's a new standard for us. I'm on the fence about whether I care too deeply about the \"conventional change log\" commit message format. Commit messages can always be changed before merge, feel free to do what makes you productive and happy - we can always change things later.\n. @jkornblum Absolutely! Feel free to make a PR. I'd love to use this.\n. Done in #1044.\n. \n. Since the flow run had a hiccup, I both re-triggered the build and made our travis_before_install skip the IPython + widgets deps.\n. I'm surprised that this worked so well. o______o\nGuess this is fit to ship.\n. Super awesome, thank you.\n. Let me get some extra tests in here.\n. Oh, thanks for merging. I've got some tests I haven't been able to commit yet because I've been talking to people.\n. Tis ok, I'd rather see this in. It solves a lot of issues. I'll be increasing code coverage later tonight for this, just a few lines.\n. I think we could add this to our toJS stage or do it on notebook load.. Just a minor note on this since there are many things labeled \"metadata\". This will belong in the metadata of the notebook document state.document.getIn(['notebook', 'metadata', 'nteract', 'version']).. > And I don't know if this will break npm publish \nGuess we'll find out. I've only been doing npm publish to bump the version and, for later, for us to handle nteract as a monorepo (#549) where we can use the components in other projects.\nWorking first is awesome, we can adapt later for the monorepo stuff.\n. It's ok if we lose greenkeeper, it used to be me running npm-check -u and submitting PRs with updates.\n. For the signing, I have keys. I'm slightly willing to put them up on Travis, encrypted. I'd rather not, but hey.\n. I'm assuming you cleared the cache to get Travis to work? Looking good.\nI'll try the signed builds now.\n. ```\n$ npm i\n\nundefined postinstall /Users/kyle/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract\ninstall-app-deps\n\nInstalling app dependencies for arch x64 to /Users/kyle/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/app\nError: /Users/kyle/.nvm/versions/node/v6.2.0/bin/node exited with code 1\nError output:\nnpm ERR!

I'll give it another go and review. We should probably rip this band aid off soon.\n. I think the main thing we'll need addressed is an update to the README since the build process has changed. Other than that, I think this is fit to ship.\n. :shipit: \n. After pulling I had to:\nrm -rf build/main/ build/notebook/\n. Getting extreme strangeness on startup.\n\n\n. Oh right, I have to do the npm install over again because of the new path for node_modules in the main app.\n. Something is up with the electron logger though:\n[14:39:59:0554] [info] args { _: [],\n  kernel: 'python3',\n  k: 'python3',\n  '$0': 'node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron .' }\n[14:39:59:0561] [warning] electron-log cannot read a name from package.json\n[14:39:59:0561] [warning] electron-log.transports.file: Could not set a log file\n[14:40:00:0553] [info] launching an empty notebook by default\n. Solid idea!\n. ...since I keep telling people to do this\n. If you make this executable chmod +x scripts/kernelspecs.js and add the #! line, we can have people only running this with scripts/kernelspecs.js.\n. > What do you think about adding a script to package.json?\nSure! We could make:\nnpm run diagnostics\nor something, even reporting node versions, etc.\n. I'll merge as soon as appveyor passes, for good measure.\n. Super!\n. From Python, here's how you do custom raw mimetypes:\npython\nIPython.display.display({'application/json': data}, raw=True)\n. Any screenshots?\n. Lookin' excellent.\n. Just take the WIP off the title when you think you're ready. I think we're fine to iterate on this one after. Up to you, this is looking solid.\n. Thanks!\n. This is quite good, thank you!\n\n. I'm going to go ahead and close this unless there's a way to reproduce it.. D'oh! I meant to change the merge commit message since it was a refactor, not so much a chore. Tis ok though, it's one of the filtered prefixes.\n. Yes please, thanks!\n. If we support metadata, then the user could write:\npython\nIPython.display.JSON(myData, expanded=True)\nWhen they explicitly want to see it all and\npython\nIPython.display.JSON(myData, expanded=False)\nWhen they don't (maybe a lot of data to take in, all at once.)\n. As for the spec, if we want something nice for kernels and frontends to provide to users, we have to  adapt the message spec in Jupyter (we don't run our own specs here in nteract, we keep collaborating in Jupyter -- several of us are devs there too).\n. > as easy as passing shouldExpandNode={() => true} as a prop to the JSONTree component\nYeah I'd make it:\njs\nshouldExpandNode={() => {\n  if (this.props.metadata && this.props.metadata.expanded) {\n    return true;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\nUnder the assumption that we would want to hide by default. We can do this before we propose changes in Jupyter to specify this.\n. Definitely not time sensitive. I only outlined it so that we know what our next actions are.\n. Awesome!\n. > I think I would need to modify the JSON class to accept the appropriate parameters and call the constructor of the base class. However, I'm not sure where to go from there. Where would the expanded property of the JSON class instance be used for metadata in the response? Thanks! \nThe only other display class that relies on custom metadata is Image, which defines a constructor that accepts metadata. Based on what I'm seeing, it appears like you can\nself.metadata = metadata\nin the constructor. If you wanted to add the expanded arg, you would need to form the metadata object:\nself.metadata = metadata\nself.metadata['expanded'] = expanded\n. The Image class init\n. Silly me, I answered your questions well after you already answered them yourself. Sorry about that! Looking awesome.\n. Woo! Excellent work, you completed this in nteract, ipython, and jupyter_client. \ud83c\udf89 Bravo!\nReady for a related hard problem to solve?\n. That definitely helps. We have a config setup that we're planning to expose for CodeMirror. Part of the resulting config for you includes loading CodeMirror's built in emacs mode 'codemirror/keymap/emacs' and then setting up the config.\nIn the meantime, here's a diff you can apply on master (probably to be out of date soon):\n``` diff\ndiff --git a/src/notebook/components/cell/editor/index.js b/src/notebook/components/cell/editor/index.js\nindex 7742614..e82204f 100644\n--- a/src/notebook/components/cell/editor/index.js\n+++ b/src/notebook/components/cell/editor/index.js\n@@ -17,6 +17,8 @@ import 'codemirror/addon/edit/closebrackets';\nimport 'codemirror/addon/dialog/dialog';\n+import 'codemirror/keymap/emacs';\n+\n import 'codemirror/mode/javascript/javascript';\n import 'codemirror/mode/css/css';\n import 'codemirror/mode/julia/julia';\n@@ -245,9 +247,15 @@ export default class Editor extends React.Component {\n           Right: pick,\n         },\n       },\n-      extraKeys: {\n+      extraKeys: Object.assign({\n         'Ctrl-Space': 'autocomplete',\n-      },\n+      }, CM.keyMap.emacs, {\n+        'Ctrl-Y': (cm) => {\n+          const originalBehavior = CM.keyMap.emacs['Ctrl-Y'];\n+          originalBehavior(cm);\n+          cm.setSelection(cm.getCursor(), cm.getCursor());\n+        }\n+      }),\n       indentUnit: this.props.tabSize,\n       tabSize: this.props.tabSize,\n     };\n```\n(@tacaswell and I sat down at PyData DC to figure this out)\nThis definitely motivates that we need a js based config on the desktop app, similar to ~~hyperterm~~ hyper.app so that people can write custom functions for codemirror.\n. I guess if it's just a package plugin with namespace nteract-codemirror-emacs, then the user could add it to their plugins list... \ud83e\udd14 \n. Definitely need an expansion on how we do our config file, likely to take a raw javascript file.. I think this is much easier to support now that the codemirror component and our other components have become more compound. If folks are interested and want to lend a hand, I'll happily put together what to do for this.. Ah that's great. We adopted this convention without knowing too much about standards, so we can evolve to what seems to be consistent across projects.\n. Looks like you're testing it perfectly, even both cases. Excellent!\n. Thank you so much! This looks excellent.\n. I'm tempted to make a job that continuously updates a gist with a csv (something I know @parente has done), so we can collect download information over time.\n. As for updates, we could probably have a CI trigger. \ud83e\udd14\n. ~~We do scale it right now (which might be part of the cause for blur).~~ We have an SVG version of a static logo. I wonder if we could create a full CSS animation for this... \n/cc @fabric-8 \n. Web video is definitely an option.\n. It's a local file at least, so there's not much of a bandwidth issue.\nBeyond that, videos are much smaller than GIFs and can also be autoplayed.\nRef: http://rigor.com/blog/2015/12/optimizing-animated-gifs-with-html5-video\n. Excellent work here.\nWould you mind rebasing interactively to get rid of the merge commit and merge conflict?\nAlso, let us know if master builds well for you or not. We recently switched to a process that demands more upfront tooling installed. :worried:\n. The easiest option is to have me do the rebase and then post about what steps I took.\nI can either do the rebase, force push the repo, and have you pull or I can just post my steps to follow/learn from.\n. Rebasing is one of the most persnickety git flows, I hate asking it of people but it's also super useful to know. Thanks for rolling through it.\n. Wow this rebase is hairy in the json.js component.\n. \n\n\n\ngit wants to me to see that I need to resolve and then git add\n\n\n\nMissing part here:\ngit add src/notebook/components/notebook.js\ngit rebase --continue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. I might be missing some screenshots in there. \u00af_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n. Oh I also didn't show that I did a git fetch origin (noting that my origin is this repo).\n. > Yeah, that's why I needed a second pair of eyes :/ I know how to rebase, git just refuses to accept that the conflicts are fixed after I resolve them and rebase --continue. I'd love to see how you fix it!\nSorry! I didn't mean to overexplain or step on your toes. I wanted to make sure that if there was anything I could help teach for the future, I wanted to be able to.\n. Went ahead and force pushed.\n. Great! Thank you so much!\nNote for the future: we don't merge our own PRs in nteract\n. My feeling on this is that we should integrate with the language server spec and go from there. Thoughts?. Excited for this one.\n. > I noticed that we weren't using enzyme in the tests for Display. I assume this is a consequence of bringing the DisplayArea in. Do we want to move the tests over to using enzyme so it is consistent with the rest of the code base?\nYeah, that's a consequence of bringing DisplayArea in. We should definitely switch to enzyme.\n. I think a post install will not run if the build fails.\n. I'll go ahead and merge, and test out my assumption.\n. Yeah I'm pretty surprised about pkg-config.\n. The only true way we can test this on OS X is to put it on a fresh Mac.\nFor Linux, we can test this in Docker or a VM. \ud83e\udd14 \n. Even if we have to add them back in later, the brilliant thing is that the dep check script here can be updated and we'll still inform devs in automation.\n. > Fun fact: 2GB RAM isn't enough to build zeromq on the first try\nWow that is a very important fun fact.\n. /cc @tacaswell @lgeiger \n. Awesome! @lgeiger is prepping installers for OS X and Windows in #952. I wonder how this all works with Linux.\n. Yes please! I think that would go with the other OS specific stuff that's in static/ (extend.plist is for OS X). Not sure how we need to present it, though it sounds like we can adapt it for electron-builder after you submit the .desktop file @chendaniely.\n. How's this now? I'm guessing the apt packaging in #1299 probably made this a bit easier for us to also have an Arch Linux release.. Since the AUR package exists, I'll go ahead and close this. If I'm wrong on this, feel free to re-open!. I'm working on this in https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/847. We've got a bit of a ways to go to make conda kernels show up.\n. @jdetle - @chendaniely is working with the released app, not in dev mode\n. To make at least one conda kernel show up in nteract, you can install a kernelspec from the environment:\nsource activate envName\nconda install ipykernel\npython -m ipykernel install --user\n. I see a couple of action items we can address to make our user experience better here until we solve the core issue in #357:\n- [ ] Provide a way to do diagnostics from the released app (no access to node at command line)\n- [ ] Provide a way to report an issue that encapsulates the diagnostics report\n- [ ] Report a simple message noting \"hey I see you have conda installed - we're still working on it\"\n. Instead of me closing the issue and saying that this is reported in #357, would you be alright if we change the issue to be about reporting better messages for conda users (it can use my current bullet list, feel free to add on)?\n. With the work that wasn't merged in #1384, we could have had conda support. I couldn't finish that up given some other priorities, it would be great if someone looked into where I started it to finish it off.. #1384 will get you partway, in that it will find your base python installation and pave the way for exposing environments. For detecting virtualenvs though, we'd have to have a way to find them on disk. @minrk has voiced that trying to hunt around on disk for virtualenvs that have ipykernel is rife for disaster as opposed to setting up a named kernel within a virtualenv using e.g.\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name other-env --display-name \"Python (other-env)\". These gifts of flow are so incredible. Thanks for following up after my ref refactor. :bow:\n. Now I understand why you said there was more to fix for flow after my PRs. I blindly accepted that the green check mark was showing for flow, wondering if my local setup was just not right. After your next fix we should make npm run flow explicitly fail the build as needed.\n. Thank you for taking the flow errors on. We'll make sure it falls on all of us to keep flow in check.\n. Thank you so much.\n. Time for the human greenkeeper! :wink:\n. Excellent, I'll merge after CI passes.\n. I like how this was broken and not broken. I'm guessing it was a matter of the prebuilds not being ready yet.\n. Looking excellent!\n. One AppVeyor run didn't pass. It's the functional test that failed, which is unrelated to the CSS so I'll merge this.\n. That drop down looks much better! Would you be willing to do something similar for the other themes?\n. What I tend to do for the lint update PRs is either do the package bumps + the linting or submit commits to the branches that greenkeeper created.\n. > Whaaat?? \nThe linting rule changed, you'll also want to bump/update the dependency to the levels that are in the greenkeeper PRs.\n. Alright, let's bring it in and see if all is passing. I'll clear the Travis cache.\n. I'm not sure where this would belong. I'd rather we finish off handling line feeds and other ANSI/terminal codes before we add automatic linkification.\n. While convenient to use the linkify, it comes at the cost of reducing what can be displayed in untrusted notebooks. All outputs from streams would not be shown on opening the notebook.\n. Yeah, an approach that keeps content as textContent, can be displayed. When strings are the children of a React Element, they are done as textContent which is what you've done above.\nThere's going to be some amount of tripping on escape codes here. An admittedly naive approach that would keep the console consistent would be to do a second pass on the bundles returned by ansiToJson.\nAs for rolling our own, I recall ~Hyperterm~ Hyper.app talking about trying to do terminal state in a way where they could push down state into a React component more effectively. At a high level, the current state of the terminal is an intermediate reduction on the stream of character. Stepping out of that abstract way to say it, I wish we had a function with a signature like this:\nfunction ttyReducer(state: ttyState, text): ttyState\nWhere ttyState is (in all likelihood) a string. This is important to me because we'd be able to store the last state in the notebook document rather than the entire stream of text from stdout.\n. Somehow I missed this - yes, I think we should be able to go from source text on stream output (or text/plain) and include linked URLs.. Yeah that sounds like a good option. If it makes it easier to work with, feel free to bring it into nteract/nteract as yet-another-package-for-export.. Now master should pass again.\nFor further context, our cache needed clearing and the Travis cache API was erroring.\n. The \"just works\" line is likely aimed at how you can treat jupyter notebooks as native files using finder, etc. (For the built release).\nThis brings up an even more pressing issue - how does a complete beginner to jupyter get introduced at the beginning of the readme? You're a well practiced user of Jupyter @hainm so if we confused you, we confused way more people.\n/cc @willingc\n. Pertinent easy to start part for this issue is updating the user installation of nteract in the readme.\n. Awesome, looking forward to it.\n. I will giggle at Pumpkin Spice every time.\n. Awesome!\n. While you don't have to do it in this PR, it would be great to create a new file if a file doesn't exist.\n. We read the file before we write the file. We'd need a new handler in launch (part of main).\n. What does Atom do?\n. Ok, cool. That's a good solution for how we run as admin.\nAs for setting the location, that's what I'm wondering about Atom. Where do they install atom and apm?\n. Thanks!\nI left one note that you're free to make a follow on PR for (path.resolve of the dir).\n. 'Tis fine. Style-wise, you may like this better:\njs\nconst exampleNotebooksDirectory = path.resolve(\n  path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', 'example-notebooks')\n);\n. Generally I think our functional tests have gotten a bit flakier since the Electron upgrade. Worth making a pass over them.\n. Could we do --kernel kernelName instead? Otherwise we won't be able to have other arguments later.\n. > I understand it now.\n\nOne has to use npm run start -- --kernel javascript to make it work.\n\nOh my gosh, why didn't I think of that?\n. Based on what I'm seeing, we'll need a separate export for the main module and the renderer(s).\nelectron targets\n.

The webpack stuff here is good to go, it mostly needs someone else to check it out and help decide of we want to go this route.\n. We don't have a pure-web version yet, though when we do it will probably be backed by the jupyter notebook APIs. Thanks for posting an issue!\n. Awesome, we'll keep it in mind for any future web version. I'll close this since this repo is for the native desktop app.\n. Just an update -- there is now a web version of nteract that runs on top of the jupyter server. You can try it out on binder!\nThe jupyter extension is called nteract_on_jupyter on PyPI and there are install instructions here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/applications/jupyter-extension. When this gets used in the main process, we'll want to make sure we cache the result (share/publish - I'm spacing on what exactly we have to do to not replay the observable). There are two intended receivers: knowing if the app is still loading - our \"keep running the logo\" part, as well as the main menu.\n. /cc @philpl \n. > not everyone wants all their conda environments showing up as kernels so I hope it's configurable\nThank you for raising this up! I've been erring on the side of making things \"just work\" out of the box for users, so we have less users complaining about python not working (i.e. not having a python kernelspec installed). We don't read any jupyter notebook configuration, as it's implemented in Python with full allowance for Python\nWould it be ok for us to detect the root conda environment and provide that? I did feel a bit scummy implementing this - I'd rather people install kernels directly or that conda provides a means of providing kernels without overriding the notebook server.\n/cc @minrk for thoughts on conda + jupyter\n. Note: this code that went in provides the ability to locate the kernels and is not enabled. I'll think on configuration for this if we enable it. Open to ideas and PRs.\n. Excellent!\n. Time to have everyone give this a spin on master.\n. Since I wanted to double check after merging, saving, loading, and config are working perfectly.\n. \n$ nteract --help\nopen: unrecognized option `--help'\nUsage: open [-e] [-t] [-f] [-W] [-R] [-n] [-g] [-h] [-b <bundle identifier>] [-a <application>] [filenames] [--args arguments]\nHelp: Open opens files from a shell.\n      By default, opens each file using the default application for that file.\n      If the file is in the form of a URL, the file will be opened as a URL.\nOptions:\n      -a                Opens with the specified application.\n      -b                Opens with the specified application bundle identifier.\n      -e                Opens with TextEdit.\n      -t                Opens with default text editor.\n      -f                Reads input from standard input and opens with TextEdit.\n      -F  --fresh       Launches the app fresh, that is, without restoring windows.

Looking great!\n. Now the bug reports will come in for when people use this CLI to create new notebooks. :smile:\n\nWe need to do some detection on the main process and an event on the renderer process to handle creating new named notebooks.\n. One thing we probably need to make sure of that I'm not seeing here -- each time you launch nteract a new instance is created. On the Mac, this should default to the already created nteract main process.\n. We probably want it without the -n. It does look like they're opening new instances then. It usually seems like they defer to a previous window when I run atom . several times in a row.\n. Oh I see, we would want a new window if the notebook wasn't already opened.\n. Looking at the Travis log for flow:\n43: function isDragUpper(props: Props, monitor: DropTargetMonitor, el: HTMLElement): boolean {\n                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ identifier `DropTargetMonitor`.

Unsure what to do here.\n. > I think it might have something to do with the types not being exported\nPerhaps we can make a PR or raise an issue on the flow-typed repo.\n. In the meantime, we could declare the types here I suppose.\n. Only on x86 too, let me restart the build.\n.

Posting in flow-typed?\n. That sounds perfectly fine, plenty more to tackle here.\n. Thanks for trying nteract and reporting this! There's active work to detect conda environments and have them show up as kernels -- this is certainly on our beta milestone.\nI'm really happy you were able to install the ipython kernel directly. You can also install named kernels when in a conda environment like so:\nipython kernel install --name 'conda-kernel-myproject' --user\nThere's also a display-name option (which is shown in the UI).\nClosing this to defer to #357 for the conda kernel issue. Feel free to re-open if you'd like it open. Thanks again!\n. Great feedback!\nTwo long term answers:\nRemote kernels\nThere's a current initiative to support kernels remotely where you can use the notebook server as the backend for your kernels. This server could be tunneled like you described or served over TLS with auth (API token or password on server).\n@captainsafia is leading an effort around this.\nWeb version of nteract\nOnce we have the components exported, we can put together components from nteract on top of the Jupyter Notebook server.\n@rgbkrk is leading an effort around this.\n\nIn service to both of these, there is already effort to expose RxJS bindings to the Jupyter Notebook API, which makes it plug in well with the rest of nteract's architecture.\n. See #1346 for the current outline, progress, and direction.. Closing since this was primarily a question and we have an issue for tracking the web app progress.. Just an update -- there is now a web version of nteract that runs on top of the jupyter server. You can try it out on binder!\nThe jupyter extension is called nteract_on_jupyter on PyPI and there are install instructions here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/applications/jupyter-extension. > I noticed when writing out some directions for this that there is not a way to create a markdown cell from the menu/keyboard shortcut. I would be happy to add this as a feature if you're interested (keyboard shortcuts for markdown is something I use all the time in jupyter). What do you think?\nSure, what's the keybinding?\n. Excellent! I pointed out a few things if you have time to address them. Either way, this is great and moves us forward!\n. > is there a specific name for what I called the \"hover menu\"?\nI think the code says \"CellCreator\". Hover menu is way better for an end user though, so I think you've chosen well. We can always adapt it again later if we think of something better.\n. We don't have configuration available for that yet. However, our path for it is pretty clean. I made emacs bindings work in https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/963.\nClosing, since this is a duplicate of #963. Feel free to re-open if you want to. We'll keep on this and make sure you have a nice way of setting your keybindings.\n. Closed by #2350.. We definitely still need this. Please freshen the issue stale bot.. Is there a way for us to touch a file with node?\n. Closing in favor of #1046. Thanks @captainsafia \n. One thing you can do from the command line is activate the virtual environment then install the kernel specification from within the environment:\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name some-env --display-name \"Python (some-env)\"\n/cc @minrk @takluyver\n. Closing as this can be done with a kernel for the virtual env.\nAfter thoughts: perhaps we need some built in help that can assist users in creating kernels for virtual envs, conda environments, or generally debugging.. There are two sets of node_modules now. At the basepath and in app/\n. @lgeiger make it a little easier by providing npm run reinstall (so we don't have to tell people to nuke and install again).\n. Excellent follow on commit @lgeiger!\n. Thanks for this @jkornblum! I'm looking forward to it.\nIn order to make linting pass, you'll need to do the require separate from the call:\njs\nconst initContextMenu = require('electron-context-menu');\ninitContextMenu();\n. Welcome to the nteract party! \ud83c\udf89 \n. I just noticed that if you don't have rimraf globally and you didn't have it installed as part of deps here before, this will fail to run the reinstall. Not sure we have to fix that, just a quirk.\n. Wow, there were two issues for this apparently. I suppose I'll keep this one open, though we do have some unit tests for main here.. Yep, we can always use new tests for main. \ud83d\ude04 . Yeah, nteract runs on chromium which accepts changing the scroll bar styling with those webkit prefixes.\n. Looking at this one again, I'm thinking I'd want something at the top or bottom. Our scroll bars are styled (can't remember which PR). I'll go ahead and close this PR since it's not likely to happen anytime soon.. > You could use the extraResources option and move the example notebooks out of the app directory. This way we could keep using ASAR.\nLove that plan.\n. Oh my gosh finally thank you!\n. According to linting it looks like this outputFocused prop might as well be deleted since it's not used. When it's in use we can bring it back.\n. Woo! Love it when the linter helps us delete more and maintain less! The flow types likely need an update too (run locally, our Travis setup doesnt reject for flow yet).\n. What happens when you hit up and down when inside a cell? Does it still navigate to the next and prior cell?\n. I'll revisit this one after @lgeiger puts us back on one package.json with the new electron-builder setup.\n. Luckily there is next to zero JS to write for this - it's primarily writing a print stylesheet that incorporates the theme (CSS variables): https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/how-to-set-up-a-print-style-sheet/\nOn the JS side, it's a matter of adding in the menu option.. Done in #1358 (as well as some follow on PRs)!. Thanks for chiming in on this, we went through the work of getting the Windows build setup yet don't know what choices are the best for all users.\nIt looks like there are options for the tool we use, electron-builder, via some combination of .build.nsis.oneClick and .build.nsis.perMachine that would end up in the electron-builder section of our package.json.\n. It appears like:\njson\n  \"nsis\": {\n    \"oneClick\": false\n  }\nwould work inside the build config. Are you able to build, try it out, and make a PR @dhirschfeld?\n. The Plotly.py one was recently completed by @theengineear. All that is left is R support.\nBonus points: Scala!?!. Awesome, that's great.\n. Hopefully outlining this helps us fix #429, #803.\n. > I like these user intents. It's unclear to me from the diagram but is the drag cell intent directed at the gutter out of the output area or the input area or both? The current implementation does it along the entire gutter.\nThe entire gutter, only because that's what we have now. As long as there's an area and that we define what it means for focus, editor focus, and scroll when dragging, I'm happy.\n. Great exploration, I like this!\njsx\n<CodeCell id=\"1\" />\n<CodeCell id=\"2\" />\n<MarkdownCell id=\"3\" />\nI'll explore a couple of these for a sec\n\nUser clicks the display area on , the state is now {editorFocusedCell: 1, cellFocused: 2}.\n\nI think we want editorFocusedCell to be null in this case. We want focus from the cursor/editor to go away (prevent accidental typing, allow other text input to be used).\n\nUser clicks the cell editor on , the state is now {editorFocusedCell: 2, cellFocused: 2}.\n\nHere's where it's a bit strange (and where you fixed it in #1055). We want to lose focus on any other editors (maybe it doesn't have to be explicit) and allow CodeMirror to do the focusing so the user ends up clicking exactly at the cursor position they want.\n. We probably want the state structure to be something like:\njs\n{\n  focusEditor: true,\n  focusedCell: '1',\n  scrollToFocus: true,\n}\nWe run into a problem though in scrolling/focusing in which we want to make sure that we don't re-scroll as other state changes in the document (focusedCell remains set to '1' for example while scrolling around and outputs are coming in).\n. > Yeah. So I have a feeling I might need to pull some nasties with React to get this working right. Because we would need the Editor to change the state on editorFocused and then that change would have to bubble up the DOM tree to the parent CodeCell, Cell, and Notebook components.\nThere's an onClick handler for the CodeMirror component where we can set focus and yet not focus the editor (codemirror is doing it) and not scroll (implicitly done by user).\n. That state structure likely matches the event as well (unless we turn them into discrete actions that match our roughly two events above).\n. Oops! Wrong button while commenting. \ud83d\udc45 \n. Sweet. This could probably be a bigger size now too. It's really crisp.\n. I'm beginning to lean towards using null origin iframes for HTML outputs and sanitizing markdown HTML with caja (though https://github.com/google/caja/issues/1977 is a likely prerequisite).\n/cc @craigcitro.

Well that was fast, thanks @LBKinson. :smile:\n. Welcome to the nteract party! :tada:\n\nthat's my first OSS PR...ever! would love feedback\n\nWoo! You did it perfectly, so I don't have anything to add on (other than my one small comment about commit prefix). Let us know how we can help. We also have a slack you can join.\n. This was one was done at some point in the last month, based on what I see in the code, closing!. We definitely need to bring in the conda support all the way so we can even tackle this one. \ud83d\ude43. Our main -> notebook load is now cleaned up and this isn't a problem anymore (as far as I can tell).. Incredible. Thank you!\n\n. There is one additional thing we require of collaborators, which is to format commit messages with a prefix. In this case it would be chore(cleanup): convert todo to issue. However, I'll just merge this one and set the merge commit to show the chore prefix (they don't end up in the changelog anyways).\n. > I was unsure of PR title verbage... My PR title and commit messages...\nWhoa! Totally. Glad you noticed.\n. Hey there! Thanks for making the PR. Did you mean to close it?\n. Ah I see, you've made a new PR. Thanks!\n. Ah, cool. You can also click the pencil icon in the upper right of each message/PR/issue to edit the description next time. \n. Thanks!\n. It's ok - in other test we create an observable with actions like this:\nconst actions = Rx.Observable.from([{\n      type: 'something'\n      data: {},\n    }]);\nNow you have an Observable to work with for pumping through an epic.\n. Here's a way to at the very least call the function and test that it handles an ActionsObservable:\n``` js\nimport { ActionsObservable } from 'redux-observable';\n...\ndescribe('watchExecutionStateEpic', () => {\n  it('returns an Observable with an initial state of idle', () => {\n    const action$ = new ActionsObservable();\n    const obs = watchExecutionStateEpic(action$);\n    expect(obs.subscribe).to.not.be.null;\n  });\n});\n```\n. Here's an example out of our current code base of tests that properly pumps through actions and makes sure that it recieves a series of response actions:\nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/67f7964970541e12341b645f184c2b5667a812a8/test/renderer/epics/comm-spec.js#L161-L185\n. Basically, the pattern we want to aim for with testing observables from observables on the outside is:\n``` js\nconst actionBuffer = [];\nconst responseActions = someEpic(mockActions, store);\nconst subscription = responseActions.subscribe(\n  actionBuffer.push, // Every action that goes through should get stuck on an array\n  (err) => expect.fail(err, null), // It should not error in the stream\n  () => {\n    expect(actionBuffer).to.have.whatever.structure.you.think(); // ;)\n    done();\n  }\n``\n. I'll go ahead and merge it as it moves us forward with testing. Hopefully my comments help and that I'll be able to dive in with you again on this.\n. This got fixed up with the metadata reducer -> document reducer migration.. This has been addressed by moving thesessioninto ourchannelsobjects.. Part of this was done in the refactor of main's launch.js (to keep launching with a default kernel consistent).\n. We are now consistent with our kernel now that main loads kernelspecs and sets up the default.. We've got it now!. Taking away thenew-contributor-friendly` tag on this one because it involves a lot more coordination with the main thread.. I think we're alright with our current OS checking now. Closing!. This has been done as part of our state tree refactor.. Now that we have a config, we could probably allow folks to set this as part of their nteract.json.\n. That's unrelated and fixed on master now. Your theme is nteract and instead of replacing the theme name with light or dark it put the nteract name in the tile URL.. Alright, let me see if I can fix this.. Thanks!. Our current strategy is to default to light unless the theme is explicitly set as dark. A \ud83c\udd92  \ud83d\ude0e  thing we could do is to set it based on:\njs\nwindow.getComputedStyle(el).backgroundColor. Oh yeah, that's a good one to clean up now that we have the error middleware for our redux store.\n. This is now cleaned up.. @jdetle did you handle this recently?. This is a bit more cleaned up, I'll go ahead and close it since this TODO Issue is a bit ominous.. This affects kernels that are a bit slower to start, which includes Scala and Julia.\nWe primarily need to do a retry of the sending of a kernel_info_request if we don't get it in time.. Yeah, I also wish for expanded by default or at the very least a bigger default collapsed version.\n. The default size for expansion is bigger nowadays. We should probably revisit this one.. Woohoo! Thanks.\nWe've got some typing work ahead of us (including filling out some defs)!\n. Every little bit matters!\n. The reason this is failing so many tests is that many of the tests are running without a store configured. This is a good thing, in my opinion.\nRight now, if we force the store down into the tree we're stuck with a component that must know about that top level state tree. I'd much rather prefer that this component take a prop for expanded (what it did prior) and that on the outside of this display it gets configured.\nWhat that means is that you'd have to pass this prop all the way from the <Notebook/> down deep within.\n. Note: I increased the size of the collapse tolerance in https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/1142. Most of the time I want it collapsed when it's way bigger than my screen can fit.\n. I'd like to take a step back and consider what this config option is intended to provide. I'll try to summarize and we can explore what the intended behavior is.\nUser story: I want all my cells to be expanded by default.\nSuggested name for config: autoExpand\nThis would imply that you would still be able to collapse a display area (expands by default with this configuration). There are a couple ways of approaching this from that perspective: expose two settings on the display: defaultToExpanded and expanded OR in the reducer for SET_NOTEBOOK apply the config setting there as well as on new cell creation:\n``` js\n  [constants.SET_NOTEBOOK]: function setNotebook(state, action) {\n    const notebook = action.notebook\n      .update('cellMap', (cells) =>\n        cells.map((value) =>\n          value.set('inputHidden', false)\n                .set('outputHidden', false)\n                .set('outputExpanded', AUTOEXPAND) // Loaded... somehow\n                .set('status', '')));\nreturn state.set('notebook', notebook)\n  .set('focusedCell', notebook.getIn(['cellOrder', 0]));\n\n},\n```\nEven with this, I'd consider that maybe the new larger by default before collapsing may suit your needs well (try out master now!) without us having to maintain more config options.\n. Hey \ud83d\ude0e!\n. This isn't meaningless - we certainly want the edge cases tested. Before this merely went through the .do without ever invoking the error. \ud83d\udc4d \n. We want this so that running !npm install inside the notebook doesn't store or show all the lines of output. It also means you get the ASCII animation for install.\n. Done deal.. Thanks for cleaning this one up.\n. Looks like this is passing now - still need folks to check on stuff or is it ready to merge?\n. \n. \nAltair's declarative syntax makes this all just too easy. \u2764\ufe0f it.\n. Note: until ipyvega exports the vega mimetypes used above, folks have to wrap altair objects with the little vegify function I wrote:\n``` python\nimport IPython.display\ndef vegify(spec):\n    IPython.display.display({\n        'application/vnd.vegalite+json': spec.to_dict()\n    }, raw=True)\nv = vegify\n``\n. Does it finish building for you though? I can add an escape for that, as we have native browser canvas as soon as it's in the Browser Window.\n. :boom: zeromq\n. Switched tonpm install` @lgeiger.\n. Thanks again @darshan934!\n. Looking good.\n. Thanks @jdetle!\n. Excellent, thank you!\nOur coverage reporting tool runs no matter the pull request, so it's just a silly artifact here. :smile:\n. Very. We'll definitely want to come back to these.\n. We are so close to 90%!\n. ~14 more PRs like this\n. Though you'll be saddened to see the coverage drop if we start testing main. \ud83d\ude09\n. Thanks for the additional patch @lgeiger. \ud83d\udc83 \n. Every single jupyter message is going to need the session ID.\n. I'd aim at passing the session ID into create message (it doesn't and shouldn't have access to the store)\n. Not broken anymore!\n. It sounds like we may be doing things in the shell script that are not fully cross-shell compliant (similar to how dvm.sh and nvm are implemented).\n. @desilinguist can you open the dev tools on the splash screen by running command-shift-i?\n. Intriguing.\nThe splash screen's primary purpose is to deal with the slow startup that occurs when we run our shell-env stuff as well as the :soon: to be implemented conda kernel finder. My shell is a bit slow to start, so the splash screen has been good feedback for me. It does run in a separate process and is completely dependent on asychronous events from the requested notebook(s) - it shouldn't affect startup (at least, not much). Timing data could convince me otherwise.\nIf loading and running the video is straining resources, the user will have more problems with the core notebook as well.\n. I'll be happy to dig into this one next week, I'm not sure I'll have enough time to fully invest in the command line interface in the next couple days.\n. I haven't played much with this, it would be cool if you're able to run from master and help us fix this @tylerwince.. That's sounding great! Thank you @lgeiger and @tylerwince. Would you say the nteract cli is in a good state now for the purposes of this issue?. Running from master will always show Electron, due to the fact that it's not a packaged release (that happens as part of our npm run dist process).. Do you want to just go ahead with this? I think you're the one most likely to know whether or not this is good to iterate with.\n. Closing as advised\n. Little bit on the commit messages: I'd use the prefix refactor since this isn't fixing a bug, it's refactoring the sticky cell state.\n. I think what John is saying is that he's really excited that all his work to test this (including a mock for the notification) is alive. Tests can now be greatly simplified because of this fix.\n. Interesting. Sounds like I should be able to reproduce this with a notebook created in Jupyter that uses tabs instead of spaces?\n. I think this issue was fixed by @mpacer with a recent <Editor /> refactor. I'd love to see if that's the case.. Awesome, thanks @alexandercbooth!\n. Thank you!\nPlease keep filing issues, we want to build a really solid experience out of the box. This feedback helps.\n. Done in #1146\n. Going to fix up appveyor next.\n.

One more patch to clean this up then.~~ Nevermind, good to go.\n. Heh, last night (my time) there was only the 7.20.0 pre release. This looks ready to go now.\n. You need to set the e.returnValue to false - see the Electron docs for an example on the close event: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/ef9d8fe9bd54e9c57568d7dd09d578034eebfb3d/docs/api/browser-window.md#event-close\n. This event happens synchronously (since it's handling SIGINT, quit, etc.). You'll need to unconditionally set e.returnValue to false and then do a proper quit based on the dialog after.\n. Yeah, this is why I think about us moving more to the main process closing down kernels, saving files, etc. (or at least access to it), since we can handle signal interrupts and more directly.\n. Want to re-tackle this one now that main does a bit more event handling?. I'm hoping we can get this one working in today's release, I'll see what I can do.. Opening a new PR, since the branch here is gone.. Two takeaways here:\n1. put outputExpanded within a cell's metadata (note: there's already a collapsed flag in use across jupyter within the cell metadata)\n2. introduce conformance tests by creating a notebook through nteract, possibly running through a series of actions\n. Last time we asked about picking some fields, @takluyver said that it was entirely the point of metadata.\nWhat we really need to outline carefully as a project is whether something is:\n- Transient (at runtime)\n- Persisted (in the notebook document)\nAs we explore multi-user collaboration, we also need to concern ourselves with what is local transient state for that user. For now, we can largely divide between transient and persisted and learn what works with multi over time.\n. Sure.\n. Not going to press forward with this one.\n. Thanks for cleaning up the linting @lgeiger!\n. Our peer dep on this with our airbnb config requires us to be on a lower version.\n. Accepting the coverage drop for now.\n. Thanks @ivanov!\n. Thanks @ivanov! This sets us up to be able to handle https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/issues/209 more easily.\n. Thank you for tackling this one and cleaning it all up!\n. \n. Got the clean up working, even if a bit inefficient as a first pass (see bd28431).\n. To play with this PR, in your notebook you'll want:\n``` python\nfrom IPython.display import display\nip = get_ipython()\niopub = ip.kernel.iopub_socket\nsession = ip.kernel.session\ndef display_with_id(obj, display_id, update=False):\n    \"\"\"Create a new display with an id\"\"\"\n    data, md = ip.display_formatter.format(obj)\n    transient = {'display_id': display_id}\n    content = {\n        'data': data,\n        'metadata': md,\n        'transient': transient,\n    }\n    msg_type = 'update_display_data' if update else 'display_data'\n    session.send(iopub, msg_type, content, parent=ip.parent_header)\ndef update_display(obj, display_id):\n    \"\"\"Update existing displays with id\"\"\"\n    return display_with_id(obj, display_id, update=True)\n```\nProgressBar, traitlets based\n``` python\nimport os\nfrom binascii import hexlify\nimport time\nimport traitlets\nfrom traitlets import observe, Int, HasTraits\nclass ProgressBar(HasTraits):\n    capacity = Integer(100, help=\"capacity for progress\")\n    progress = Integer(0, help=\"value of progress\")\ndef __init__(self, capacity):\n    self._display_id = hexlify(os.urandom(8)).decode('ascii')\n\ndef _repr_html_(self):\n    return \"<progress max='{}' value='{}'></progress>\".format(self.capacity, self.progress)\n\ndef display(self):\n    display_with_id(self, display_id=self._display_id)\n\n@observe('capacity', 'progress')\ndef update(self, change):\n    update_display(self, display_id=self._display_id)\n\n```\nInvoking:\n``` python\nbar = ProgressBar(100)\nbar.display()\nfor i in range(101):\n    bar.progress = i\n    time.sleep(0.01)\n```\nEmoji Updater, also traitlets based\n``` python\nimport os\nfrom binascii import hexlify\nfrom traitlets import observe, HasTraits\nclass Emoji(HasTraits):\n    emoji = traitlets.Unicode('\ud83d\ude01', help=\"emoji to show\")\ndef __init__(self):\n    self._display_id = hexlify(os.urandom(8)).decode('ascii')\n\ndef _repr_html_(self):\n    return '<h1 style=\"font-size: 100px\">{}</h1>'.format(self.emoji)\n\ndef display(self):\n    display_with_id(self, display_id=self._display_id)\n\n@observe('emoji')\ndef update(self, change):\n    update_display(self, display_id=self._display_id)\n\nem = Emoji()\nem.display()\n```\nInvoking:\npython\nemojis = \"\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude03\"\nfor i in emojis:\n    em.emoji = i\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n. /cc @minrk ^^ WIP for update display\n.

This notebook has a really great narrative Paul. Love it.\nThe last part of the notebook is where the update display doesn't seem to work, because \nThere's only one spot in the notebook that doesn't update, yet I expected it -- we don't have support for execute_result nor a display id property.\nSee https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/issues/209#issuecomment-260182391\n. Updated the notebook, love the \ud83c\udfc7 race.\n\nAlso noticed something wrong in the notebook format related to fields that should be in metadata. I'll get that fixed on master.\n. @ivanov do you think it would be ok for us to introduce readers of the notebook to traitlets to make updates automatic on change of progress + capacity?\n. Oooooh I like the idea of using @property and @property.setter here! Less cognitive burden (and dependencies) for folks.\n. > should we have the ProgressBar class handle the updates right out of the gate, or should we have another example, so that they all build on each other.\nIf we create a new ProgressBar later on that introduces the use of the property decorator that's cool.\nPossible Flow:\n- Outputs you can update by name\n- Creating a Progress Bar\n- Progress Bar that uses @property and @property.setter\n- ThreadPool Executor linked up with the progress bar for jobs\n. I'm not sure if we can do much about the JSON key order churn. If it's simple enough to do while running a JSON.stringify, might as well add it on.\n. Two cells with a threadpool + progress bar:\n``` python\nimport time\ndef progressive(bar, timeout=1):\n    for ii in range(bar.capacity):\n        bar.progress = ii\n        bar.update()\n        time.sleep(timeout)\n    bar.progress = 100\n    bar.update()\nfrom concurrent import futures\ntp = futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10)\n```\npython\nbar1 = ProgressBar(100)\nbar1.display()\ntp.submit(progressive, bar1, 1)\nResults:\n\n/cc @glyph\n. What do you have in mind?\n. @glyph - as long as the message can be passed through to indicate that you want to print to a named display (display_id=...) then it will get directed to the right cell. This has to be for structured displays/objects - it won't work for stdout/stderr/print out of the box (unless you override the print function). I used a thread pool because it was the easiest. If you show me another paradigm you want (you mentioned background callables), we can try that out.\n. Just read the update to the notebook\n\nThis is good, but it would be awesome to have a progress bar that would automatically update whenever its progress was modified - that would be truly progressive.\n\nhahahahahah\n. Time for me to tackle a few more mimetypes. I'll take images and plotly now.\n. Rebased to bring in the testing changes from @alexandercbooth.\n. Next up, javascript.\n. This now implements everything we set out to do in the TODOs above and is thoroughly ready for review.\n. That's the \"right\" numbering since it's broken up by a cell block in between. As for the lack of numbers when there is only one element, that comes from some CSS for when there is only one item. Perhaps we should only enable that for ul li instead of across all li.. Closing since we show the numbering now and since these are different markdown contexts they can't continue between code cells.. Fixed in #1204.. I think this one is definitely open for implementing still. \ud83d\ude09 . Atom must be doing something similar we can swap builtins etc. for. I'm not sure how the Atom stylesheets work though.. One thing that @captainsafia's PR #1055 exposed was that we needed to use the onClick handler from the CodeMirror component: \nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/1055/files#diff-d28163d397f24b7e0cde9ddf00d9cb0dR263\nEffectively, let CodeMirror handle the click into the editor (which it will regardless) while registering that click as setting the focus cell (without changing scroll).\n. Also, thank you thank you thank you for working on the cell focus - this is the most important user experience piece we've needed to address.\n. Tried this out just now, it appears to be working exactly like I expect as a user. \ud83d\ude04 \n. Also looks like unfocusing from the codemirror editor happens properly now!\n. The only thing that I think we probably want to refine later is scroll within larger notebooks. I don't have anything concrete to articulate yet, I'll do some thinking. As it stands, this PR is excellent and I look forward to bringing it in!\n. As noted above, the markdown editing still needs to be addressed.\nMost of the markdown cell appears correct. The primary fix here is that when a markdown cell switches to edit mode from view mode, either by:\n- hitting enter\n- double clicking the markdown cell to edit\nthat the codemirror editor will be focused.\n. Awesome, markdown is working stellar now!\n. \ud83c\udf89 \n. This is confirmed fixed on master.. Are there any more like this?. @ivanov @jdetle - We can/should rebase our display PR after this is merged.\n. annnnd I've already been bitten by the lack of source maps... grumble\n. I would love to go back to one!\n. We technically need to skip the pre build entirely for electron anyways.\n@ralphtheninja - are there any workarounds for prebuild with the style electron builder uses?\n. This is awesome. If it's working, I'm happy to just merge it and move forward. The only necessary change is bringing back index.js (I think).\n. Time for some rebasing on my own PRs.\n. Yay, I can close this. We still need to refine the UX. I can say we're good to go here with a sensible start though!. I hope there is a way for us to catch this and deal with it so it doesn't break the main app.\n. Better error message when it breaks since we're on a newer version of Electron!\n\n. We've now got some try catch wrapping on some of our remote objects we were using. I'll close this as something that's slightly out of our overall control, we've mostly mitigated issues.. I'm all for adding linting to the default npm run test setup!\n. Oh you're saying adding some text to the contributing guide - also super cool\n. Well, we want it to fail locally when it doesn't pass linting so we'd want:\njson\n  \"test\": \"npm run test:unit && npm run test:lint\",\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. This is looking excellent to me, certainly an improvement. Thank you. We can keep refining after so feel free to take the WIP out of the title here if it's ready to go!\n. @michaelaye Couple things to run for diagnostics -- at a terminal run\njupyter kernelspec list\nAs well as\nls ~/Library/Jupyter/kernels/\nThanks for trying nteract out!\n. @carsonfarmer I am absolutely stunned that Python works and the others are running into problems. Usually it's the other way around.\nWhat do the kernelspecs look like for your ir and javascript kernels? One reason we won't be able to launch is if the executables are not on the PATH.\n. Sorry I had not looked at this again, got caught up with some other things. How are things now? How do they behave in the jupyter notebook? Are you on master or the latest release?\nWe'll be getting out a release on Wednesday that is far more stable than any previous release, still more to finish up for our beta.. Seems like a fine spec to me, I can't tell why it's not working right in nteract. We need additional diagnostics on kernel error within our UI to make this easier to debug remotely.. Nevermind, everything is fine now because we merged in the mega cell focus PR.\n. Woo!\n. Went ahead and merged, feel free to make another PR with the suggestions I made if you like.\n. Awesome, great to have more tests!\n. I'll go ahead and close this and open an issue about supporting this.. I'm going to submit a PR bumping each of these deps so they pass together.\n. Whoa, I think this version fixes some of #1179. Let's use this.\n. > @rgbkrk, getting an error saying action$.filter(...).ofType is not a function, any idea whats going on here?\nThat sounds like the observable prototype isn't being patched with the filter operator. This tends to happen if two different versions of Rx are installed locally (one for redux-observable and one for our base app). There are ways to work around it, I'd dig into what you have locally though.\n. TIL of can take more than one argument.\n. Thanks @captainsafia and @jdetle!\n. I just realized... We're missing logic for saved. All we know is if it was modified from last time.\nThe logic should be\njs\n  modified: saved.notebook !== current.notebook\nYet we don't have saved.notebook available here.\n. It fixes a bug yet doesn't fix the modified feature. It can be merged, we've just got some work ahead of us. I think I know what to do for a follow up PR.\n. Yeah, we should definitely figure out how to encode the entire codemirror config from within the nteract config file. I feel like we'll probably have to switch to nteract.js based on #963.\nIn the future I'd love to see us do the config from the main process, pushing changes to all the notebook/renderer processes. We'd then be able to handle the checkbox state appropriately.\n. This whole non-checkbox thing is so annoying. :-/\nAlso want this type of setting available to turn code completion typeahead off.\n. Thanks for adding tests in here that end up increasing coverage in general (the componentDidUpdate and componentShouldUpdate cases).\n. > Oops I just introduced conflicts by merging #1199. I'm going to rebase.\nAll good, thanks!\n. I'm going to submit a PR bumping each of these deps so they pass together.\n. > this could be really useful if a path property were provided that would accept a module path or if a require property that would accept a require path\nThat would be really useful! However, that would also be very brittle and tied to the environment:\n- What does it mean for non-electron, does a webpack bundling strategy have to be defined like in JupyterLab when on the web?\n- How do you show this with nbconvert, on nbviewer, etc.?\nAs for callbacks, I definitely want to explore that space... \ud83e\udd14 \n. This is some great direction @gnestor -- I like the jupyter react ideas. I've seriously hoped not to tie things straight to React, yet it seems like it would be the easiest way to experiment with writing the layout and user event handling portion to match the models I wrote a bit on in synchronized-object-diff-spec\n. I'm currently \ud83d\udc4e  on auto-importing node modules notebook side. I like the idea of it, it's the likely implementation and maintenance burden that would worry me, not to mention the new security implications.\n\nThe synchronized object spec describes a general way to synchronize state between front-end and kernel. When implemented, this will effectively make the core of ipywidgets much more accessible to other widgets\n\nYeah, largely speaking I was iterating on it to explore the space of only the models part of the widgets (no views). You've got the right idea on handling the change sets. I'm not sure what the frontend ---> backend changes look like, how you'd propagate from nested React components. It's at least clear to me that changes should bubble up as actions which change the overall model (while informing the backend).\n. Fantastic!\nIt's going to be hard to warm me up to dynamic imports from a CDN or otherwise.\nWhat I am a fan of here is that a notebook implementation/deployment can choose to provide some modules, even if some implementations do the wildly dynamic thing.. Also, amusingly, I was literally sitting down to think about an updating models structure with some sort of nested updateIn like mechanic. I'm not sure how to convey what I'm thinking of yet so I'll keep working at a whiteboard and come back with more.. > Beyond the scope of this conversation, I see a big opportunity with inferring JSON schema from arbitrary data + querying React components that can render that schema = inferring visualization from arbitrary data.\nGreat note.. Hi again @nelix! Haven't seen you since... pipboylib. :wink:\n\ncould the object not be walked and everything not a string/arr/obj/null gets daturi`ed and then the same thing on the other end... maybe a ref system for anything the hash datauri gets used twice?\n\nAs long as we can carve out a consistent spec, I'm game for experimenting. How would/should we serialize functions for this? When writing these components from Python, I imagine they'd be pure strings (with some helper to demarcate as a function).. Super healthy discussion here, closing this for now to focus my own efforts. Happy to revisit this later or to have someone else jump in with this mimetype + example usage in Python. This pairs well with #1313.. I'm going to submit a PR bumping each of these deps so they pass together.\n. As a WYSIWYG editor like with Draft.js or how it renders when unfocused in Beaker?\nWhile editing:\n\nWhen editor unfocused:\n\n. Yeah I'm unsure too. @jdetle - can you provide more context?. I totally agree. It's tempting to take it out until we have something sensible.\nIf we had multiselect of cells (again), I could imagine the cell toolbar having a \"merge cells\" option. No other ideas from me there.\n. Great, thanks!\n. Just to clarify - it sounds like the discovery of the interrupt was hindered by the fact that kernel operations are under \"Language\". Then, beyond that, interrupt wasn't performing a true interrupt (and not providing much feedback).\n. Now that I've had more experience with other notebook UIs, we should incorporate a Cancel button for when work is in progress or queued up.. Cancellable execution from the Spark Roadmap in Jupyter. > I tried converting the busy cell to markdown by pressing m which effectively stops execution for that particular cell.\nNeat! Yeah we actually do have logic for stopping listening to messages for a cell when the cell type is changed.\nAt least as a mockup, I'd like to see what a cancel field would look like as well as a little hokey barbershop progress bar.. Awesome, thank you!\n. I went ahead and opened all the notebooks we had after making sure they conformed first - the only that I'm seeing here that persist that shouldn't now is status as a top level key inside a cell.. Woo thank you!. Welcome to the nteract party! :tada:. Thanks for reporting!\nWe can switch those to literal ->, they're currently some unicode character that renders well on my Mac and Windows machines.\n\n. I so want a nice way for us to do this.. Still need to figure out what was up with 2.x. This is good though.. Ah I see, we definitely don't have flux standard actions ({type: ..., payload: ...}).. We don't support the jupyter notebook's reliance on requirejs / define (AMD). We do have support for plotly embedded directly with an application/vnd.plotly.v1+json mimetype. An initial version of this is in https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/562 and needs to be revisited.\n/cc @chriddyp - do you have cycles to finish up the plotly.py support?\nIn the meantime, here's a function that will work with plotly data and layout objects:\n```python\nimport IPython\nimport plotly\nimport json\ndef plotize(data, layout=None):\n  \"\"\"Plot with Plotly.js using the Plotly JSON Chart Schema\nhttp://help.plot.ly/json-chart-schema/\n  \"\"\"\n  if layout is None:\n    layout = {}\nredata = json.loads(json.dumps(data, cls=plotly.utils.PlotlyJSONEncoder))\n  relayout = json.loads(json.dumps(layout, cls=plotly.utils.PlotlyJSONEncoder))\nbundle = {}\n  bundle['application/vnd.plotly.v1+json'] = {\n    'data': redata,\n    'layout': relayout,\n  }\nIPython.display.display(bundle, raw=True)\n```\nThis is available as an example notebook in File -> Open Example Notebooks -> Plotly, at least on master (new release likely tonight!).. Closing since this has been implemented in plotly.py.. Neat, seems like some simple fixes.. Yeah I suppose it can, can't believe I missed it. It's also ok if you want to close issues you think are done @Madhu94. I'll grab it now. :smile:. We'll need this one fixed before we make another release.. Fixed in #1233 . This makes me hopeful for when we do redux or more tests that address the actual functionality more directly. This one was passed over sadly, the test that is there only ensures the cell type has changed - not that the additional fields are gone. We could start using the JSON schema that is set up for whole notebook to verify cells, outputs, etc. too. \ud83e\udd14 . Awwwww.. \ud83d\udc4d \nAnother way to do it, since we have a modern browser is to use a DOMParser:\njs\nconst domParser = new DOMParser()\nconst doc = domParser.parseFromString(`<svg width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n  <circle cx=\"50\" cy=\"50\" r=\"40\" stroke=\"green\" stroke-width=\"4\" fill=\"yellow\" />\n</svg>`, 'image/svg+xml')\nThat doc is a document fragment that can be added to the DOM wherever needed.. I wanted to tackle a smaller issue than my other PRs, so after seeing your comment I went for fixing this @fil. :smile:. We'll certainly be including this in the next release too, amongst other features and stability improvements.. This is fixed in master and has not been released yet. :soon:. We've now made a release, go grab it at https://github.com/nteract/nteract/releases!. Wow that's pesky.. As for the absolute URL you're using there -- it needs to be without quotes.\nFor local images, there is a bigger problem. The page is relative to the install location, not the notebook file. We have to change our architecture to handle relative assets.. Suggestion by @smashwilson: use <base> and set the href to the notebook path. This would likely have to occur after we load our other assets.. We definitely have to solve this one before the release candidate and have it kicked around during the beta or alpha stages.. Thanks @lgeiger . Thank you!\nPart of this was done in https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/src/main/kernels.js, we need more adaptation to finish this off. I'll register this mentally as another vote to finish off #357. I know the next steps to take, I haven't had time to do this yet.\n@lgeiger -- this relates to how we should be able to take any kernelspec in our current setup to do a run (rather than relying on name alone). We run into an issue when trying to detect the kernel from the notebook vs. a new notebook. . Closing as duplicate of #357. #1384 took us partway, I would need more time to finish that. Alas, I must admit I don't have time to fully finish that and need someone else to dive in.. Trying out the branch now, a couple things missing once this \"command mode\" is enabled - I'd like to be able to hit enter to get into edit mode in the cell as well as create new cells when at the bottom (like the current behavior).\nOn further evaluation, I notice that it does go back into edit mode style navigation when hopping over markdown cells.. To clarify, what was brought up in slack was that page down didn't work in the document when the codemirror editor was focused right?. Excellent!. Note: this is the introspection API, which we have available for business logic. Most of the work that needs to be done is UI -- if anyone wants help, let me know.. Great!\nPrecursors\nRead up on how we do code completion. The messaging pattern is pretty similar, except you'll be sending an inspect_request and receiving an inspect_reply. The introspection docs in jupyter-client are really specific about what is provided.\nIn CodeMirror you're going to want to play with cm.addWidget which lets you add a DOM node at a position in the editor. You'll have to clean up that DOM node somehow, I'm not sure what the best user experience will be there yet. \u2757\ufe0f \u2755 \nLikely steps to iterate with\n\nRegister a key binding to invoke a function for introspection (you can just make this console.log stuff)\nCreate the observable similar to our completion logic\nHook that observable up to the callback created above\nIn the subscription to the observable, have it create a silly widget (for now)\nSince the introspection API returns display_data style bundles, you'll want to use our transforms which means you'll need to use React (ReactDOM.render(<Component />, el))\n\nGood luck, let me know if you get stuck with any of this. It's quite a bit to figure out and manage.\n. We now have the comment addon setup. How's this on master now?. On master and in the latest release, automatic commenting is not happening. This is still a fresh feature request.. \ud83d\ude22 I like some of the scrolling, I wish there was a way to capture scrolling down the document on shift-enter in a way that is less obtrusive. People also use shift-enter as a way to go through a notebook and read their way through it.. > Maybe throttling the notebook scroll slightly so it's closer to the speed of cell scroll would help? \nThat's an interesting idea!. Let me give it a try. I spoke too soon, it was general remorse about even what we have now being awkward. You're making terrific progress on iterating this part of our UX.. Alright, I've tried the branch out side by side and I definitely agree that the default scroll behavior of the browser provides a more consistent user experience.. > One thing I would like to improve is the transition from scrolling at the top/bottom of the cell output to the notebook scroll \nWould love to see that.. Hurrah!\nHowever, it looks like you'll need to rebase against origin/master.. . Little drop in coverage, @captainsafia promised to do tests later. :smile:. Cases for an existing gisted notebook:\nAuthenticated gist\nIf the user \"owns\" the gist, they should be able to publish (and also update the metadata if necessary).\nIf the user doesn't own the gist then they can't publish, yet they could make a new gist (new metadata).\nUnauthenticated gist\nCan't ever write back to an unauthenticated gist, have to make a new one (I think...)\n. Oh whoop, I thought I merged this. Glad you're revisiting this now. When you get a chance, I'd try describing in Markdown the user and event flows, resulting states, and expectations.. This PR is excellent proof of missing tests for main. :wink:. > I'd be happy to start chipping away on some tests for main, if someone wouldn't mind giving me a little guidance on where to start.\nI'm going to break so many things right now that I might as well make a testing harness for some of what's in main here.\nThe main thing is that much of main can be tested just like the notebook. Try to find functions that don't require the filesystem or electron APIs (there are a few I know of) and you'll be off to a start.. Ok this is now \"ready\". By that I mean that it's ready for me to update tests now that I have it working.. This still fails conformance tests, I'll come back to it later.. Rebased, going to see what likely lint errors exist now.. Sure enough, this PR still has an issue with conformance:\n```\n$ npm run test:conformance\n\nnteract@0.0.15 test:conformance /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract\nnode scripts/conformance.js\n\n\u2705   /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/example-notebooks/altair.ipynb\n\u274c   /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/example-notebooks/blah.ipynb\n[ ValidationError {\n    property: 'instance.metadata.kernelspec',\n    message: 'requires property \"display_name\"',\n    schema:\n     { description: 'Kernel information.',\n       type: 'object',\n       required: [Object],\n       properties: [Object] },\n    instance: { name: 'python3' },\n    name: 'required',\n    argument: 'display_name',\n    stack: 'instance.metadata.kernelspec requires property \"display_name\"' } ]\n```\nI'll see if I can iron that out. Otherwise, kernels are executing just fine.. Finally finished off this branch -- the kernel info is set properly in the document now. It's very ready for review. :smile:. We definitely need to figure out how we want to allow external themes. We do have an nteract.json file that is placed in your jupyter config directory. It lets you swap out the theme by name, yet not a reference to (or override of) the CSS file itself. It's tempting to allow custom styles in something like a user's nteract.css (in the config directory). We'd need to be fairly committed to our DOM and CSS structure though.\nIf you think others would like your theme @laymonk, feel free to submit it for inclusion in the main app! We could generally use better default table styling, so I certainly welcome it. \ud83d\ude04 . I'll go ahead and close this. Feel free to re-open if you think this is still open. Seems like the question of direction was carved out. Would still love to see your theme. \ud83d\ude04 . Done deal #1358 . So good.. This is the day I've been waiting for.. Thanks!. It's so weird to me that there is no print role for menu items.\nI'm guessing there's a print preview when using contents.print, perhaps we can provide both options in a reasonably simple way. Does this have to go to an epic or can this menu option only handle the event and take action, since it doesn't change state?. Also... Woohoo! Thank you for tackling this.. Seems like we still need the state to get the filename, it just doesn't have to dispatch an action.. This needs a rebase and I think there are remaining TODOs you were looking to. Are you still coming back to this one?. No problem, I'm just going through open PRs and some issues since we've been doing a fair bit of refactoring and I'm trying to carve out the module exporting for use in a web app version of the notebook.. Sounds good, thanks.. I've been able to reproduce this after having a notebook open for a very long time on a mac that has gone through sleep and awake cycles. My kernel connection has been fine throughout but I can't seem to save and replace the filename:\n\nNote: this is current master, I'm on OS X El Capitan, and using a Node.js kernel.\nSince I know where this is occurring, there are two things we have to address:\n\nSometimes electron remote objects disappear and have to be recreated. I don't actually know how to deal with this so at the very least a try-catch around the section seems good.\nThe entire observable that's handling updates here needs to retry (more like rewire) the originating observable on failure, making sure to catch failures (see #1177). Oh hey, I know how to fix this a bit better now than our current try catch. At any rate, this is \"closed\" in the sense that we've mitigated it. Need to fix (or document) better how to handle situations like this up in Electron.. /cc @TomAugspurger. Went ahead and created the table directly, mirrored the current structure style of the pandas HTML we're used to seeing. Check the source out \ud83d\udc40. Result:\n\n\nI haven't used the typing information yet, this only sets us up for later allowance of theming and utility across other languages - we've broken up the presentational components and the data.\nWhat's missing?\nThe indexes on the data frame. They're not captured with this current data, schema approach.. > Could you create a todo list in this issue so I can track what you've done and what you're working on? I'd like to help but I don't want to overlap.\nSure. I'm not working on this in any serious sense, it's only up as a prototype for the pandas discussion (this doesn't have to be the end component, just enough to rely on the JSON spec and messaging).\n\nWhy not use the FixedDataTable component?\n\nMy first commit and comment used the fixed data table component. It required a lot more configuration to get right as opposed to creating the table directly. Feel free to iterate on a component that uses this { schema, data } spec to match pandas while using the FixedDataTable. I don't have the time to fuss too much with it.\n\nI updated the mimerender extensions today to provide their own display method, which would allow something like...\n\nCool! I'm glad you're making Python side versions for exploring. I tend to defer to either providing these methods directly in IPython.display.* utilities or in the core libraries. In the case of Plotly, it would be cool if you picked up https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/562 from where @chriddyp left off. I'd rather the support be built into the libraries being supported and used by users.\n\nis it possible to register new transforms/mimetypes that are not bundled with nteract?\n\nNot currently, continue the discussion in #670. An externally facing API is not something I want to support until we finish up higher priority issues. For now, bundling many renderers is the approach I've been going with. The API in this case is the mimetype and the expected payload. We rely on specs, not the implementation.. Technicality:\napplication/vnd.dataresource+json is what we want and the structure is:\njs\n{\n  \"resources\": [\n    {\n      \"schema\": {...jsonTableSchemaHere},\n      \"data\": [...rows],\n    }\n  ]\n}. Closing for now to reimplement later instead of rebase.. You'll need a rebase since I merged the other PR. \ud83d\ude04 . It's annoying that comments in a review that are responses aren't grouped with the original message. :frowning_man: . change\nexport const saveConfigEpic = actions =>\nto\nexport const saveConfigEpic = (actions, store) =>. Ooooh that's new to me. I had not heard of PureComponent yet!. We're getting there!. Another one checked off!. I think we're on a pretty good level with this now with the packages in @nteract/core and it's getting better each day. One note for historical record -- at least at the time of writing this, we've kept providers and made the \"views\" just be called \"components\". \ud83d\ude04 . This is looking pretty trim!. I agree we should definitely get this in sooner than later, we can revisit the DnD tests later.. Thanks for this mega refactor, driving us toward completing #549 and #1288. :smile:. Thank you!. Thanks! I was seeing this intermittently, glad you fixed it.. Nice!\nWe should start doing the operator patching for Rx soon too.. Based on reviewing the Travis logs and our current setup, we should take mkdirp out of our package.json's devDependencies, leaving it only in dependencies.. Thank you!. Hi @gVallverdu! Thanks for trying out nteract.\n\nIf I launch nteract, I got a notebook like page but at the bottom left there is Loading ... | not connected. If I try for example to run 2+3 in the cell, there is a star and nothing append. After this, at the bottom left there is ir | idle. This last message appears when I run ctrl+enter.\n\nI've been running into this with the R kernel too. I think this stems from the R kernel not booting as fast as we expect and so it misses our kernel_info_request. In general we need to retry our initial kernel_info_request so that we can serve kernels that are slower to start more effectively. I could be wrong on this one for R -- either way I'd love to see this experience get better.\n\nMoreover, I think nteract does not find python because in langage menu, there is only R. Again, in File -> New, there is only R.\n\nIn order to have Python kernels be detected, they need to be installed in a similar manner as the R kernel:\npython -m pip install ipykernel\npython -m ipykernel install --user\nThis installs a kernelspec for Python. You can also run ipykernel with options, including the name you want to make the kernel (in case you want individual ones for conda environments).\nIn the long run once https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/1264 is finished up, there are small PRs ahead to detect and use the default Python kernel as well as conda environments.. That ipykernel command places a kernel.json file in the jupyter kernels directory. In a coming release we'll do detection of a python installation that doesn't include the kernel.json.\nClosing as duplicate of #1327 and #1384 for now. Thanks again for trying nteract out!. Thank you! It's great to have people looking after the Linux side now that I'm primarily on macOS and Windows. \ud83d\ude04 . > Determine package maintainer email address, valid .debs should have one.\nIf you're willing to represent and handle responses, you can put yours in. Otherwise, you can put rgbkrk+nteract-debian@gmail.com. If it doesn't have to be a literal person, we can use the jupyter google group jupyter@googlegroups.com.\n. > Are there man pages already written, or some documentation similar to it? typing man nteract in a terminal should give usage documentation.\nWe don't have a man page for nteract. It's ok to add that on to this PR or post an issue after merging.. > Determine apt-get dependencies and add those to package.json. This would allow automatically installing eg. pip along with the nteract package.\nThese are optional dependencies for nteract, as it doesn't require jupyter to be fully installed. It only relies on kernels to be installed into the right directories (my Windows machine only has a js kernel for example and no jupyter installation whatsoever). However, I recognize that in order to fully realize nteract's potential you need the python kernel and the whole ball of wax involved with installing the basics.. It's ok for them to be .so files inside the package. Electron apps are fairly self contained, which goes against principles on Linux and makes things easier for the other OSes. There's probably a way to break this out, forcing a build from source for zeromq + others. It would likely not be fun.. Wow great demo!. > I can make individual issues for things that require further work ... I'm ok, with this being merged in its current state, but also open to suggestions.\nThat's cool with me. Feel free to take the WIP tag off and iterate with issues and new PRs.. I normally don't like having people rebase but can you take out the commit with message: 0.0.16. > The 0.0.16 was there by accident, I didn't realize what npm version did exactly. I'll remove it.\nIt bites us all, no problem. \ud83d\ude04 . Since you ran npm version directly you'll probably want to delete the local tag it created too (same name as commit).. Great, thanks!. Welcome to the nteract party! \ud83c\udf89 . Sure enough, that test fails for me locally too. Running the app was fine with this dep though. Closing this PR.. Nevermind, this had the same error after I nuked node modules and installed again.\nPosted an issue in vega-embed: https://github.com/vega/vega-embed/issues/15. @mathisonian - would it be worth us asking if canvas can be made a peer dependency for vega-scenegraph?. I'm making a bit of a backwards ask, in that I'm hoping that I can have node-canvas not be installed in Electron environments and forcing other node users (that would not have a native canvas) to install it directly when they need it.. When canvas fails at building on folks machines, it doesn't always gracefully complete. See https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/1456. Thank you for the fix.\n\nRight now, you have to press delete for as many spaces make up a tab.\n\nYuck.\nI'm wondering if there's a built in way for codemirror to handle what we added on here (more bundled codemirror extensions) so we don't have to add on these functions in general. \n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Thank you for reporting this!. In the meantime, https://slackin-egwcornswi.now.sh works.. I've gone ahead and aliased the slack to https://slackin-nteract.now.sh, we'll keep that as our canonical one now.. As for updates client --> backend, I'm expecting for unidirectional data flow with a bit of a twist in that we'll both update our own version of the model while sending an update to the kernel backend and expecting to see the same update come across the wire as well. This makes for good reasoning why we want setIn and not allowing push as a mechanic.. Concrete example of updating the user's model after working through it with @peggyrayzis:\nIn the user's output is a slider that controls r and the view of an image called image. The model ID will be my-image-model for this little example.\njs\nmodels = {\n  'my-image-model': {\n    'image': 'binaryData...',\n    'r': 200,\n  }\n}\nWhen user slides slider r, we emit a Redux action like:\njs\n{\n  type: \"UPDATE_USER_MODEL\",\n  modelID: 'my-image-model',\n  value: \"200\",\n  path: [\"r\"]\n}\nWithin reducers, modify ['models', modelID, \"r\"], updating the value for r in the model while also sending a COMM_MESSAGE to the backend to also update the model in the kernel.\nThe kernel responds by sending a COMM_MESSAGE with { \"path\": [\"r\"], value: \"200\" }\nand then also sends the a COMM_MESSAGE with a payload for the modified image:\njs\n{ \"path\": [\"image\"], value: \"somebinarydata\" }\n. I definitely still want this in so I'll be rebasing this again in hopes we can start experimenting with the VDOM views and set based model updates.. Rebased, now to see if I did that well... \ud83d\ude05 . Update: tried this out using the notebook I included here - working quite well!. Extremely ready for another review here! Cross reference Jupyter custom / comm messages while you're at it.. Excellent! Thanks @jdetle. More to come now that this is merged, mostly via the VDOM mimetype and passing messages up from the components/outputs!\n\ud83d\udc83  . Awesome, thank you. This one totally got mixed up after I broke up the cell clearing for the update display feature.. I just realized that my \"review\" was in progress from this morning. Pushed the button now!. This needs a rebase, I'm going to try the web editor.. Ew, it creates a \"Merger branch 'master' into X\" commit when you rebase.. Good catch! One thing we should change is to make this component extend from React.PureComponent. D'oh!. As for what test you could add you could write an enzyme test that updates the props and makes sure that the proper markdown menu is shown, etc. I can dig up an example shortly.. These are some quality tests ensuring proper behavior, much thanks @betatim!. We could switch our guidance to python instead of python3.. Thanks for reporting the issue, we'll detect the non registered python kernel by the next release (in flight PRs that address this).. What's in ~/Library/Jupyter/kernels ?. We don't currently detect conda environments or base python installations. All kernels detected come from looking at the kernel paths for jupyter. If you want nteract to see your current conda environments, you'll need to create a kernel for the conda environment you want to use. We've certainly been figuring out how to support this and even have code for detecting conda environments that have ipykernel installed as a python package.\nThis comes down to two choices:\n\nWait for us to finish off https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/357 and https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/1264 as well as ship it\nRun the ipykernel install command inside your conda env:\n\nsource activate myenv\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name \"Python (myenv)\"\nThanks for your patience as we get it all situated.. Cool, we'll keep on keeping on so that it can work for you soon.\nTo answer your question, encoded in the notebook metadata is information about which kernel to launch. It's the same metadata that is used by Jupyter notebook and we intend to match the implementation there so that it's a consistent experience. Our conda env detection is the same namespace setup as nb_conda_kernels.. Wow I'm surprised that the embedded terminal in Spyder has such great support for nested objects! Thanks for reporting this.\nMy jupyter notebook server and local IPython both show this:\n\n. Tab does not trigger completion in nteract. There is a way to trigger the completion though: ctrl-space. Since tab is also setup for indent, the logic for tab-completion in Jupyter is a bit hairy. We simplified the approach for now to have something while lowering our maintenance burden.\nIt looks like we support the greedy completions -- our typeahead is apparently holding back some completions that I had to trigger with ctrl-space:\n\n. Woo!. Note: I'm lacking specificity in the above example, hoping someone can collate good information in the guide.. Oh interesting - we need to make sure to fallback to a different python kernel if the exact one from the notebook format is not available.\nDoes \"Python 2\" show up in the Language menu?. Does it let you switch to Python 2 via that Language menu?. When you create new notebooks do they work properly?. Opened https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/1328 as the issue for falling back to a different Python kernel.\nAs for the app generally not working after kernel failure, we need to set up explicit recovery / \"retry\" flows for our epics: #1177. One more related issue I've posted: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/1329. This is now done on master due to how we do language selection.. Right now the error message reads ERROR_KERNEL_LAUNCH_FAILED with little extra detail.\nSuggested changes:\n\nLeave the error message up longer\nProvide more details, including:\nwhat kernel was launched\nwhat kernels we see available\nsuggest steps to take\n\nI'm beginning to wonder if we should devote time to investigating and designing better error interfaces within the app (likely just CSS on top of our current notification system).. Trying out markdown-it sounds like a good option. The only thing I'd probably be wary of is how/if HTML is sanitized (or not). I really wish we had a way to go from:\nmarkdown source (string) --> AST --> React Elements. Closed by #2350.. This last commit is going to fail due to flow. \ud83d\ude22  Immutable's Record is missing a definition for the constructor call of the \"class\"es it returns.. Now for a commit that fails in the other direction:\nsrc/notebook/index.js:33\n 33:   document: DocumentRecord(),\n                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ function call. Callable signature not found in\n 33:   document: DocumentRecord(),\n                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Record. Since Record's returned objects also don't have a Callable signature, also stuck there. \ud83d\ude22 . and this last commit will pass. . If I set the container type for a Document Record as:\nexport const DocumentRecord: Immutable.Record<Document> = Immutable.Record({\n  notebook: null,\n  transient: new Immutable.Map({\n    keyPathsForDisplays: new Immutable.Map(),\n  }),\n  cellPagers: new Immutable.Map(),\n  outputStatuses: new Immutable.Map(),\n  stickyCells: new Immutable.Set(),\n  editorFocused: null,\n  cellFocused: null,\n  copied: new Immutable.Map(),\n});\nthat's when it's unable to determine that it's a Callable. Any ideas for workarounds @peggyrayzis?. Solid SO answer here about why: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37033339/how-to-describe-immutable-js-map-shape-with-flow. This makes me want to switch off of Immutable because I love flow so much, yet there are no other good libraries in this space that have a good flow story either (playing with lodash/fp taught me this).. However, with lodash/fp these type definitions would match really well.. Interesting way to do it that lets you use Records in the way we expect:\n```\nexport type DocumentSpec = {\n  notebook: Notebook,\n  transient: Immutable.Map,\n  cellPagers: any,\n  outputStatuses: Immutable.Map,\n  stickyCells: Immutable.Set,\n  editorFocused: any,\n  cellFocused: any,\n  copied: Immutable.Map,\n}\nexport type Document = DocumentSpec & Immutable.Record\nexport const DocumentRecord: Document = Immutable.Record({\n  notebook: null,\n  transient: new Immutable.Map({\n    keyPathsForDisplays: new Immutable.Map(),\n  }),\n  cellPagers: new Immutable.Map(),\n  outputStatuses: new Immutable.Map(),\n  stickyCells: new Immutable.Set(),\n  editorFocused: null,\n  cellFocused: null,\n  copied: new Immutable.Map(),\n});\n```\nStill can't have the Callable signature.\nAlso Function cannot be called on any member of intersection type. > Also, thank you for typing all of this. I like having the types in records, I think it makes the code more discoverable \ud83d\ude00\nYou make me feel more positive about including this since at the very least the types can be used with the reducers.. > Do you think it would be worth working on a PR to the flow-typed immutable libdef to make records callable?\nThe libdef for Immutable is in the Immutable.js repo. The number of open PRs attempting to fix the flow definitions as well as the unshipped commits make me worried about whether there's a good way to even go about this. . Alright, pushed a commit that at least passes and will be useful for people to see/use.. Good to go!. I'm going to be trying out https://www.npmjs.com/package/flow-immutable-models with jscodeshift today, seeing how the code generation works out.. > The idea is that upon committing changes to a module one would add their name to a list of authors given as a comment at the top of the file. Feel free to let me know how you feel about adding this to the workflow of a standard Pull Request.\nI'm not at all interested for several reasons:\n\ngit blame and GitHub's blame view are designed for this.*\nNot everyone who has contributed is working on the project any more (it happens - they change jobs, choose something else, people die) - people tend to forget why they did things a certain way in little chunks of the code base, it's your job to figure it out and leave it better than you found it.\nThis is a process that will be harder to maintain than you think.\n\n@peggyrayzis' suggestion is spot-on for large projects that receive a lot of pull requests. We're so small that it's easy to reach pretty much everyone by posting a single issue like this -- even if it was to open a discussion about the module you're wondering about.\n* Blame doesn't always give you the best view when files are moved around, so you end up having to do a lot of extra digging if the code is really old after surviving refactors. Probably even old enough that trying to bring someone from the past to look at the new version would be disorienting.. > We should consider dropping the eslint-plugin-react no-unused-prop-types rule. It throws a false positive if you destructure your props in your component.\nSounds good to me!. If folks like this I'll happily tackle some other ones.. Since we're getting to the point of exporting all of the modules, we'll probably want to combine action creators and reducers into the same module file.. I really need to write up a manifesto on our state, so I'll do a light treatment here:\nNotebook Document\n\nEverything that eventually ends up persisted to the notebook document\n\nTransient, Associated with Kernel\n\nDisplay ID\nComms, Models (ipywidgets)\n\nTransient, Associated with Document\n\nCell view output\n\nTransient app state (local to single user)\n\nFocused cell\nCopied cell (?). For those following along, I'm amending to the same commit every time it's in a nice stable state rather than creating lots of commits. This is quite a heavy refactor to undertake.. Created new notebooks, loaded old notebooks, and ran the conformance tests -- looking good from a compliance standpoint!. This should now be fully covered after the next test + codecov run!. > Thanks for getting the ball rolling w/ typing the reducers\n\nMy pleasure, I'm glad we took the time to do this. Helped me see a lot of the state we need to clean up.. To clarify my squeamishness about the globals - I'd rather we manage the state on the main side with another store and have an explicit ipc structure.. Let's go with this!. Feedback from video chat this morning:\nWe should probably build on top of jp-kernel for our embedded kernel or we'll have to build a lot more into ikernel (which was largely created as a demo js kernel by myself).. I'm a bit hesitant with bringing in something that relies on a github repo directly, want to publish a namespaced package of ijavascript as @lgeiger/ijavascript?. Should we label this as \"node.js (nteract)\" for the display name so it doesn't confust/conflict with an installed JavaScript kernel?. We should switch our status bar to showing the display name of the kernel I think:\n\n. Wow, I've yet to have that happen to me though I'm downloading with Chrome on my Windows machine. I'll try it on internet explorer next (is Edge ok?).. You will need to install node.js >= 6.0 and follow the instructions for setting up nteract in dev mode.. Let me know if the 0.8.x release series works for you!. Thanks @JRehn!. I wish this showed flow coverage inline to show why I'm approaching a bunch of these - this file now has 96% type coverage.. > After the provider refactor, I think we should spend some time making our components more composable.\nTotally agree.\n\nFor example, we embed the StatusBar into the Notebook but what if the end user wants to embed their own status bar?\n\nYeah I think the status bar will probably be way different for a web app. I'm guessing the <Notebook /> component shouldn't even have the status bar - it should be some higher component up that looks more like this for the opinionated electron notebook (note: as structure, not as the actual components):\n<App>\n  <Notebook />\n  <StatusBar />\n</App>\nThe pinned cell(s) could be outside of <Notebook /> here too. As long as configuration is composability rather than inheritance (yay for functional principles that React leans towards) then I'm happy (you can easily get me to rant about ultra-configurability).. I'll have to spend some time learning about how we'll package / use CSS in that way. I've been really happy with our theming stylesheets and have lately wondered how we're going to expose the current styles in a good way.. > you're looking to pass down dispatch-y props to child components\nYep, that's what folks are currently tackling as PRs for https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/1288.\n\nI wonder if in-lining styles will couple React code a little too tightly with the style?\n\nI'm a little afraid of this too, though I think it's not a decision that will paralyze us. We can always change it again later as many of these function more like a library than a site we run. The pressures will likely come from us using nteract components in different fashions.\n\nAlso, you'd mentioned something about creating menu mocks / components. Is the intention to create this from scratch (at some level), or just rely on some 3rd party menu?\n\nIf the 3rd party menu works, I'd much prefer to rely on something well supported by others. \ud83d\udc4d As long as we can style it similarly to the rest of our theme(s), branding, and experience I'm certainly game.. Ah, I see you linked a context menu (amusingly, we did use this one a few months ago). The menu mocks I'm talking about are top level app style for documents:\nJupyter\n\nGoogle Docs\n\nAlternatively, there's the sidebar nav approach:\nDatabricks\n\n. Quick mock for nteract:\n\nI'll post a Sketch file from that to https://github.com/nteract/mocks as well as one for the dashboard view.. As promised: https://github.com/nteract/mocks/pull/14. Just an update -- there is now a web version of nteract that runs on top of the jupyter server. You can try it out on binder!\nThe jupyter extension is called nteract_on_jupyter on PyPI and there are install instructions here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/applications/jupyter-extension. My notebooks are big enough locally that it would be an improvement even on the desktop app.. There's now a placeholder type in our contents setup now with plans to make a placeholder notebook component.. > Are we eventually going to have no constants for our redux actions?\nYup, flow determines these for us. We could still have constants if we want them as is though, because flow figures out constants.BLAH properly too.. Couple things this PR made me realize:\n\nThe ZMQ/native local kernel portion of the state should be separate to make exporting easier (can't and won't be used by a web app)\nThe github state should be in a separate module too. Digging into this one now.. I've done the work of updating our flow type definitions, upgrading React, and digging into issues across flow, flow-typed, flow-bin, and fbjs. No one else has run into this as far as I'm aware. Our build still fails.\n\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Thank you @lgeiger!. Build now passes with the fbjs release!. Super happy this provides a link out for help with creating new kernels.. \ud83d\ude47 Thanks. You are on quite the warpath for kernel spec lookups! \ud83d\udd0d . Great addition!. We should probably find a better verb for changes like this other than refactor. ui? ux?. Woo!. %matplotlib notebook doesn't work in nteract, you'll need to use %matplotlib inline for now.\n\nBackground\nIt says IPython is undefined because matplotlib's js is expecting the javascript object IPython to exist, which definitely doesn't in nteract.\n/cc @tacaswell. Same issue in Hydrogen, yes.. The core of this issue is output expecting us to have the IPython or Jupyter classic JS objects on the page. Just like JupyterLab, we don't support the old JS APIs. I'm going to close this issue and make a new issue for interactive matplotlib.. This was partially closed #1409. I realize now that we may want to switch up how we do cell components. The <Editor> component for a cell should remain the same when switching between markdown and code cells.. This was fixed after our refactor of the core cell!. If you think it's a good notebook for general demonstration. We should probably include a bit fat JS logo at the top then.. Updated with a JS logo, I'll add it into the menu too.. Menu in now, just have to wait on Travis. I'm at least glad I put this notebook together even though it seems I probably won't use a custom reviver for the loading of the notebook.. Yay, I've got the app back to working and tests passing.. The big next piece I'll be doing tonight or tomorrow is a renewed toJS which will complete the current crop of commutable functionality we need.. This is ready for some review, especially since it touches our core state tree so deeply. I'll be getting tests fixed up and will have toJS done today as well as integration with the two epics that use it, saving and github publishing.. After having several rounds through the conformance testing, I've made our transforms handle frozen objects rather than Immutable. \ud83d\ude08 . After codecov finishes this next time I'm going to take note of each section that is not covered then bring in tests. After that, rebase and it's good to go (pending review :wink:).. Oh! I was going to handle increasing coverage. I can follow up with a new PR for that.. Or one commit and more to come again shortly! :wink:. Amusing that this increases coverage and yet hits 0% of the patch.. The second part, https://nteract.io/kernels for listing our editorialized version of which kernels to promote is done.. Next up is going to be me playing with lerna for our app and likely getting it wrong. :wink: Will use commuter and my sample lerna project as examples.. I made a tradeoff here to make commutable not be transpiled (including keeping the flow annotations). It's expected to be transpiled at time of webpack build (whether for the Electron app or otherwise).. Next up will be exporting all the transforms.\nStay tuned @gnestor :soon:. \ud83d\ude09 . Definitely still need to address this as part of the protocol. I think the current reducer for outputs just needs to relax execute_result being allowed for update displays now.. Closing, someone else can pick this up. I'm going to focus on some peskier bits as well as exporting more packages for use in the web version.. Looking back at this with @lgeiger, this would be much simpler and we could finish it off if we only do the default python here and not worry about all conda environments.. Thanks for posting. No one is currently working on supporting the current version of the ipython widgets. It's open for someone to work on.\nWhen the version for JupyterLab is more finalized, I'll begin working on integration if no one else gets to it.. If someone is able to support widgets, I'd be happy to have them.. Closing in favor of using flow-copy-source, see https://medium.com/@ryyppy/shipping-flowtype-definitions-in-npm-packages-c987917efb65#.gvhlo1tqb.. I'm going to try out a fresh install here, this might relate to how I switched us over to freezing objects on JSON.parse.. Confirmed. They load properly from a notebook but not when run. I introduced a regression, I'll fix this pronto.. Thank you for being such a diligent tester @dhirschfeld, very happy you noticed this before a release. \ud83d\ude05 . Now that's some linting! Time to let Travis do its thing. :). ~~More to do here to finish this up.~~ All set!. Ready for review here.. Like the last time lerna was updated, you have to update the version in lerna.json as well. We need to add the lerna bootstrap to the install steps here so this is caught next time. \ud83e\udd14 . Hooray! Happy to be in this thread again.\nAre you wondering where to go/what to change on the nteract side to view these responses?\nI'm assuming the structure is going to swap out the list of string matches with a list of these objects?. > Should type be a restricted enum, or a \"string with recommended values\".\nI assume it should be a string field. What does Atom do?. /cc @rdblue who is working on improved completion for Scala kernel(s). > Yes, or work with SO that want to work on it and is familiarish with the codebase.\nI'm am more than happy to get started on a branch we can both push to and change - I'll kick that off after I finish #1390.. Oh hey this was completed!. I keep noticing this while I'm in development and it totally relates to #1177. I'll make it my other big focus here.. nteract is now much more resilient to this, I missed something obvious in how I setup our error handling originally. The UX still needs work (to show that it's not really connected any more e.g.).\nThanks again for posting this again, motivated me to figure it out. We've got to nail this experience!. Yes, an issue about caching execution requests while waiting for kernel startup would be good. Thank you @dhirschfeld!. I'll answer the easy ones first. \ud83d\ude04 \n\nIs the license 3-clause BSD?\n\nYes.\n\nThere are quite a lot of binary files in the package, which is against conventions. It still works fine, though.\n\nThat's probably going to continue. :man_shrugging: The zeromq (zmq) ones come from us (not just by introducing it here, @lgeiger and I are maintainers on zeromq.js). The amount of work that was done for zeromq + Electron cross-platform was incredibly lengthy. The other dependencies I'm not sure of. The ffmpeg one is brought in by electron itself.\nI'm happy you're going through this. @chendaniely set up the Arch Linux packaging, maybe there's some good ways to collaborate across here and electron-builder too.\nThank you again.. Great!. I'm loving how much you're splitting this here and cleaning up in the process.. Woo, this puts us back in the 90%+ range!. It's taking forever for me locally too. I think it's a paired problem of eslint enabled for everywhere (not just src) and it is checking eslint within the node_modules of packages/. . From chat, Peggy is adding \npackages/**/node_modules\ncoverage\nto our .eslintignore. @jdetle The name \"coverage\" in our test suite is also unit tests. If that fails, it's definitely failing. Make sure to look at the traceback in the runs themselves, we don't want to merge anything broken on master. When coverage is decreased we get a different message here on GitHub.\nLooking at the results, @lgeiger is right. It retries infinitely (as we want it to for these). I'll need to adapt the tests to handle this.. > increase coverage by -0.09%\nHa.. I've confirmed that while a kernel is booting up you can try to send when it's not ready and it will let you send after. We at least have something recoverable, even if not very informative.. Made this even better by wrapping all the epics with a default catch/retry mechanism.. Woohoo for stability!\nFrom chat:\n```\n@lgeiger: One thing I\u2019m unsure is: what happens if a epic keeps failing after the retry,\n          will we just retry and retry again?\n@rgbkrk:  Yup. It's not the epic itself that is retrying. We basically start listening\n          for redux actions again from a clean slate.\n@lgeiger: Oh I see, that makes totally sense!\n@rgbkrk:  Before we were just letting the entire app die and then users had to restart\n``. Closed by #1407.. This makes me wonder if there is a way to reflow the CSS prior to the printing.. Thanks @jarmokivekas!. @jdetle - Jarmo [made nteract much better for Debian based Linux distros in December](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/commits?author=jarmokivekas).. Thanks for the extra commit @lgeiger!. Thanks!. I like that idea. . Mega \ud83d\udc4d . With this eslintignore we no longer have to set thenpm run lintto be specific here. I'm going to go ahead and merge this as is though!. Yay for thegofmtof JS!. About ready to make a new release, which appears to be working even amidst our lerna monorepo work.. Since we finished off the alphas and are now on our betas, we can call this done.. \ud83d\ude02 . This was aspirational at best and not something I can prioritize relative to other needs. If someone wants to tackle it, feel free to go after it!. Oh wait... this is the old commutable one. Closing, finding my transforms branch.. I'm looking at the flow types for Immutable and thegetIn` definition is very wrong:\ngetIn<T>(searchKeyPath: ESIterable<any>, notSetValue: T): T;\ngetIn<T>(searchKeyPath: ESIterable<any>): T;\nA deeply nested value may not actually be T.\n@peggyrayzis what's the best way for us to ignore bad parts of definitions that come as part of the library (not in our flow-typed directory)?. Then again, this was passing on master.\nHave you run into anything like this @thejameskyle or @hzoo? We're trying to adapt to using lerna (amidst shipping an Electron app), running into trouble with the flow definitions for Immutable.. > For what it's worth, I get the same flow error on master. :\\\nAh, that must be because you and I have both done a lerna bootstrap, which means that it's resolving the Immutable in its node_modules.. > It looks like Paul already fixed the issue, but I would put a line in the [ignore] section of .flowconfig like ./node_modules/immutable/dist/.. This is an OCaml regex, so it can can pick up on any subdirectories, like the directories in packages/, that also contain this file pattern.\nTried it, didn't work. \ud83d\ude2d . I wonder if this is because we listed it as a dev dependency:\nhttps://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/505\nWe could switch back to a normal dependency, the reason I didn't want to go that route was so that people could rely on it as a peer dependency. . I'm trying some things and will post a new commit when I think it's in a friendly state.. It passes! \ud83d\udd28. Whoops, because of me there's a merge conflict with the geojson transform. I'll handle that now.. Rebased, brought in the background color -> GeoJSON tile support.. Yay, new lerna release fixes it for us! Thanks all.. Something I noticed while doing repeated iterations of prettier 'src/**/*.js' - the output is not always a stable state. I eventually got it to one here.\nOne thing to be really careful of / look over in the changes here - the comments sometimes get mangled or end up fully deleted. We should comb through to see if they're all right.. On a separate note, I thought we would lose semi-colons with prettier. Drat!\nP.S. We could totally do standard js instead, hint hint wink wink.. Closing, not moving to prettier (for now). In other news, I've enabled my eslint plugin in Atom to auto-fix.. Shift-tab should de-indent.\nAre we overwriting something that codemirror would normally support out of the box?. @dhirschfeld, you do such an excellent job of filing issues for what's happening on master that I've added you as a member of nteract - thank you for these contributions. Welcome!. No worries about code contributions, it's really excellent getting all the testing feedback as a user.. Thank you!. No significant reason. Happy to switch to OSM, especially if that helps for packages we export from here.. I ended up not using the streets tileset in this PR because it didn't quite match the style of the notebook, whereas light and dark drop in pretty well. It does look like it would be a much better map to use when doing urban work (note: there are tilesets better suited to topographic analysis too...)\nMakes me think we should establish a metadata standard just like we have options for Images and JSON, then people could set the tile pattern directly if they like.\nIt's also tempting to make this component have some additional options that could be exposed with a menu.\nWe can wait to see what geo users think too, especially on releases coming this year.. That wouldn't be proper GeoJSON if you embed spec and data in the JSON structure itself.\nI'm talking about the metadata key within a display_data message (i.e. display(data, metadata=dict())).  Check out the payloads for metadata within the display_data message docs.. > What I meant was that GeoJSON could accept additional arguments:\nAh I see, yes that's what is done for JSON. It ends up in metadata on the protocol (where my brain space is for the frontend, since that's how we'll get it here).\npython\nJSON(data, expanded=True). At least for GeoJSON, I think I'd want to use:\nGeoJSON(data, tileUrlTemplate, tileLayerOptions)\nmatching the Leaflet API as much as possible.\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. ```\n  1) Text renders plain text:\n      AssertionError: expected ' react-text: 3 hey /react-text ' to equal 'hey'\n      + expected - actual\n      - react-text: 3 hey /react-text \n      +hey\n  at Context.it (test/renderer/components/transforms/text-spec.js:14:31)\n\n```\nWas that a change in React handling? It seems like maybe this is a result of not setting key on each child.. Thank you!. Fully closes #1310 with updates in our documentation here.. Overriding the default shift+tab to match the jupyter notebook sounds good to me. Based on how you did the tab override, I think I might try adding in jupyter's introspection API right after your PR.. I think this one is a little easier to tackle now and should definitely be done.. Great to see this solution! This component is supposed to be a presentational component and as such should not have access to context - props are intended to be the only API in accordance with #1288. I'd like to solve this either with the <base> (and required loading changes) or by passing the cwd down through the entire tree (yes, that would be a lot of boilerplate to pass it through).\nThe other issue with relying on context for this is that it will not necessarily re-render when the filename changes as opposed to when its a prop.. > I get that, but why does MarkdownCell and others define contextTypes then?\nThe cell components are currently open check boxes on that issue. I'd rather not introduce more to refactor when we have other options for doing this in line with the architecture plan.. From direct messages, I'd love to see this done with <base> so that MarkdownCell can be used without knowledge of cwd. It should work like any other relative notebook asset.. https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/349#issuecomment-278180910. Closing in favor of #1720.. To get nteract to detect this kernel you'll have to take one more step:\npython -m ipykernel install --user. ```\n$ $(npm bin)/lerna publish --skip-git\nLerna v2.0.0-beta.37\nIndependent Versioning Mode\nChecking for updated packages...\n?

Closing since I already published them. \ud83d\ude04 . Oh hello new lerna! I'll go ahead and upgrade you in the transform packages PR.. I'll be updating this in our current lerna packages PR, closing this for now.. Not a big priority, we've got some decent functions for this now.. One added note, these callbacks receive more information that we can pump through if we like to inform users (and ourselves better). That can come later, just a note if you want to make this \u2728 .. This is certainly an improvement on what we had before. Happy to get this in before the next release and kick it around.. Code coverage will go down just a bit here, which I'm ok with for the purposes of this PR. Once this passes, we'll merge it. I'll be trying out the release lifecycle next for the main app, making sure our packaging is still ok.. Ok I think I'll let it be and ship a release tonight then. :). It's disconcerting for me while I'm working through current notebooks, I find it rather distracting and it ends up taking up more vertical space. ctrl-enter also doesn't work to switch it back to view mode.\nIt also breaks up/down handling in the notebook.. This was fixed up in the 0.2.x line.. I'm currently uploading with at least these settings so we have a windows release. Technically this means they've been snuck in after the fact for the Windows release. We'll be making another alpha release within the next two weeks though, so I'm not too worried.. Ooooh, neat. Thanks for raising this issue!\nI think something like quiver could certainly be built with nteract's packages. I say it that way because core to the current nteract desktop app's philosophy is that we work with documents on disk (to saved locations). This also has an impact as the running kernel's current working directory is supposed to be the same directory the notebook is stored in. Now to respond to specifics.\nYes! We should totally do autosave, also posted in #814.\n\nEvery note I make is automatically saved in the \"inbox\" folder, and I can move it to another folder to categorize. I can also add tags to these notes.\n\nThis cross over from hierarchical and into tag based indexing is something I want to explore for a web version of nteract (see https://github.com/nteract/mocks/pull/14/files and https://github.com/nteract/commuter for the current in progress). Whether that means in the documents themselves (which can be properly indexed) or a separate running service, I'm not sure. I would hope that the native OS could support this more easily -- it's pretty clear though that the best UI for this will come from within the app.\n\nI think the automatic saving and collection will be a welcome addition for a lot of people. As long as you can still save individual notebooks in custom directories, no functionality would be lost.\n\nI like this! It would mean we're performing the indexing yet allowing freedom around the files themselves. Yes! I'd love to see this happen in the long term.\nOnce you have the notebooks indexed, you can certainly set up the organizational columns, allow for full search (since we're indexing them, might as well).\n\nAn aside - on the Mac I use spotlight to find notebooks frequently, though we're missing a Quicklook plugin (#305) as well as any way to help macOS with indexing notebooks properly.. This still stands true. \ud83d\ude1c. We support shift-enter for run cell and move down, and curl-enter for run cell in place.\nWe definitely need to figure out ergonomic bindings that match the notebook's fairly well, though we can pick any we want since we're in control of our renderer window.. Command mode is discussed in #1467. For me it's in a state of \"I'm personally choosing not to do it and maintain it\". If someone is interested in contributing it and helping maintain the overall application, it's certainly of interest to folks.. It's worth acknowledging that there will always be an upper limit to the velocity and volume of messages from the kernel that we can handle on the frontend. Same goes with the size of the notebook document. There's some practical upper bound in which we can say \"yes, we should be able to handle this much data\" and above that limit figure out a way to gracefully fail (as much as we can).\nThis is, at its heart, an optimization and UX problem for us. It would help to learn how to measure our code to find out where it's taking the most time and if there's anything that can be done. Chrome (and by extension Electron) have tools to profile code and there are good blog posts out there on generating and interpreting flame charts.\nIt would also be wise to read about Backpressure and node as well as backpressure within Rx - https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/issues/71.\nSince some of your questions involve React's own rendering, read up on React's design principles, particularly Scheduling. It explains a bit on how it chunks work, in particular:\n\nIf data is arriving faster than the frame rate, we can coalesce and batch updates. We can prioritize work coming from user interactions (such as an animation caused by a button click) over less important background work (such as rendering new content just loaded from the network) to avoid dropping frames.. You're right!. Now that I've done a bunch of refactoring work on our streams in #1998, I think I'm ready to use bufferTime to batch output updates together, letting the reduction happen on the batch instead of a single output each time.. This is now in a state that others can try it from this branch.\n\nCurrent view:\n\nI've made a mess in creating stripped down components and may very well be missing all the dependencies that need to be interlinked. Other than that it's clear the styling is not quite there.. To try this out yourself, I think this will be the right path. From the nbp branch off my remote (https://github.com/rgbkrk/nteract):\n~/nteract/$ npm i # Install all dependencies, bootstrap lerna\n~/nteract/$ cd packages/notebook-preview-demo\n~/nteract/packages/notebook-preview-demo/$ npm run start\nThe app should now be running on http://localhost:3000/. If you want to build/watch the @nteract/notebook-preview component, you'll want to run:\n$(npm bin)/babel -d lib src --ignore '**/__tests__/**' --watch\nwithin packages/notebook-preview. Compare to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/anonymous/8ea760c2e2a6bba2ebff27125a548508 for the moment.. Worked with @peggyrayzis on figuring out what to do next for our editor component and the future of all our components. In a separate PR I'll be creating a package for our current editor (without exporting the provider or view mode ones).\nWent ahead and cleaned up the commits here after putting some finishing touches on styling:\n\nSyntax highlighting is not working yet, I'm not sure what's up with that. \n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Full styles are in and we're using our actual editor component from nteract here in the notebook preview. Probably want to figure out a way to cut out some of the Rx / completion stuff (providing it only when necessary). Not likely to happen for our first releases here.. I need to customize the editor component somehow to put it back in Read only mode, I'll try that out now.. \n. I feel like there is some missing inline style related to padding or margins. \ud83e\udd14  The code cells butt up against each other.. \n. Rebased, now the editor is readOnly. I'm now a big fan of the wrapper with customOptions.. This is almost done. A couple items for me to handle tomorrow morning:\n\ndelete the yarn lock \u2705 \ndecide on how to repackage styles (right now it's copy paste with some light modifications)\n\n. Big annoyance with our editor styling and CSS - we have a particular DOM+class structure that makes using a static runMode version of CodeMirror really tricky.\nI got partway using this and I'd like to revisit it, so I think I'll post an issue about refactoring some of our CSS here.\n```js\n// Wish I could use this, we need to fix up \nexport class StaticCodeMirror extends React.Component {\n  props: Props;\n  el: HTMLElement;\ncomponentDidMount(): void {\n    console.log(this.props);\n    CM.runMode(this.props.text, this.props.mode, this.el);\n  }\nshouldComponentUpdate(nextProps: Props): boolean {\n    return nextProps.text !== this.props.text || this.props.mode !== nextProps.mode;\n  }\ncomponentDidUpdate(): void {\n    console.log('update');\n    CM.runMode(this.props.text, this.props.mode, this.el);\n  }\nrender(): ?React.Element {\n    return (\n      \n\n { this.el = el; }} />\n        \n\n    );\n  }\n}\n```. I started going down the path of simplifying to runMode thinking that it would clear up several things and make it so I didn't have to pass dummy values through to satisfy flow.. Sweet, after you get it running it would be super cool to add a README that says how to start up the demo.. This should now pass tests assuming everything gets built in the right order. Returning to this tomorrow (or Monday).. Note that this is a breaking change in terms of the published package (namespace changes), yet our package was not consumable for ES5 users yet.. > Why was the ES5ification necessary? Shouldn't babel handle this for us.\nSince we weren't using any classes here I figured I could trim down on what we end up exporting vs. a little more explicit.. Yeah it definitely goes against what's in other parts of our code base. If I didn't enjoy the declarative nature of JSX so much, I'd do the same with the transforms. ;). Thanks @peggyrayzis! I'll add babel-cli to our packages here as well.. Thanks for finishing this off @peggyrayzis!\nOn to even more maintenance work to get our monorepo packages in a good state.. I'm getting the same error and it sadly should fail gracefully as an optional dependency for vega. I'll get this cleaned up, I'm facing it too.. Let me know if this is really fixed, I'll be continuing to improve the packaging setup (while I inevitably make it worse while exporting more components).. It closed automatically because I said fixes #1456 in the PR. I think it's resolved now.. I'll try to replicate on my Windows machine tonight.\nIn the meantime I recommend running:\n$(npm bin)/lerna clean\nrm -rf node_modules\nnpm i\nand seeing what it reports back. We'll get this fixed.. Right, I'm not sure what the windows equivalent is.\nDifferent thing to run:\nnpm install -g lerna\nlerna clean\n. phew I was really worried I broke things for Windows machines in the midst of the package exports.. Gah, thank you. I used the wrong issue number.. I'm going to take this as a chance to move tests for the transforms as that's where the problem lies here.. Turns out I'm going to have to go ahead and do all the transpiling and testing migration here as well. This is probably what I'll be working on throughout the day. Moving to jest for these tests for simplification as well \ud83c\udccf . Tests pass by virtue of moving code. Our codecov status is going to be so out of whack with our separate packages now. \ud83e\udd14 . From chat in the lerna slack:\n```\n@rgbkrk: How do folks recommend doing coverage testing when using lerna?\n     We have our old coverage testing which is about to drop as we extract\n     more to individual packages.\n\n     Current: mocha + jsdom + enzyme + chai, nyc + codecov\n     Future: jest + enzyme\n\n@evocateur: jest from the root with a little config globbing works great\n@rgbkrk: Sounds like we have to go all-in. We can do that, makes sense\n@evocateur: jest is totally worth it \ud83d\ude42\n```\nOur code coverage is likely to go up and down during the next couple weeks while continuing on with the modularization and exportation.. Thank you! I'll keep on moving with all this!. Sweet, thanks. I need to make changes to our webpack setup to resolve more for #1458, I can finish that up after the webpack 2 updates.. Turns out the problem I was running into wasn't webpack related - it was module loading for tests.. We're on 3.5 at this point, so I'd say this is finished. \ud83d\ude04 . Sweeeet, thank you!. I miss when I could make small PRs. This package movement stuff is not for the faint of heart.. In order for this to work, I need the transforms to all be transpiled. That's what I'll be onto next.. Rebasing soon now that I have this in a decent state.. As part of this PR I had to finish off the transpiling of all our other components.. I thought that creating \"dev-scripts\" would be super great at encapsulating all our common dependencies just like react-scripts, then I noticed it doesn't provide you the binaries for the dependencies -- I needed jest, babel, and flow-copy-source available.. I should be doing this from the base anyways it looks like:\n$(npm bin)/jest packages/**/__tests__. Even better:\n$(npm bin)/jest packages/**/__tests__ --coverage. One problem we run into running jest from the root -- we would need our @nteract/mockument available for the jest config. It looks like we'll have to run these separately.. Once I have the plotly tests fixed I'm ready for a full rebase. I haven't been able to diagnose the Plotly test error yet (though I've fixed some things with it):\n```\n\njest\n\nFAIL  tests/plotly.test.js\n  \u25cf PlotlyTransform \u203a plots some data from an object\nSyntaxError\n\n  at HTMLUnknownElementImpl.<anonymous> (../../node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/living/nodes/ParentNode-impl.js:83:11)\n  at HTMLUnknownElementImpl.querySelectorAll (../../node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/utils.js:133:45)\n  at HTMLUnknownElement.querySelectorAll (../../node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/living/generated/ParentNode.js:39:62)\n  at d3_selectAll (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:11772:14)\n  at HTMLUnknownElement.<anonymous> (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:11828:14)\n  at Array.d3_selectionPrototype.selectAll (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:11819:55)\n  at Object.plot (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:146696:18)\n  at plotOne (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:119599:17)\n  at Object.exports.plot (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:119563:9)\n  at drawData (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:110301:32)\n\n\u25cf PlotlyTransform \u203a plots some data from a JSON string\nSyntaxError\n\n  at HTMLUnknownElementImpl.<anonymous> (../../node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/living/nodes/ParentNode-impl.js:83:11)\n  at HTMLUnknownElementImpl.querySelectorAll (../../node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/utils.js:133:45)\n  at HTMLUnknownElement.querySelectorAll (../../node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/living/generated/ParentNode.js:39:62)\n  at d3_selectAll (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:11772:14)\n  at HTMLUnknownElement.<anonymous> (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:11828:14)\n  at Array.d3_selectionPrototype.selectAll (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:11819:55)\n  at Object.plot (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:146696:18)\n  at plotOne (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:119599:17)\n  at Object.exports.plot (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:119563:9)\n  at drawData (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:110301:32)\n\n\u25cf PlotlyTransform \u203a processes updates\nSyntaxError\n\n  at HTMLUnknownElementImpl.<anonymous> (../../node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/living/nodes/ParentNode-impl.js:83:11)\n  at HTMLUnknownElementImpl.querySelectorAll (../../node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/utils.js:133:45)\n  at HTMLUnknownElement.querySelectorAll (../../node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/living/generated/ParentNode.js:39:62)\n  at d3_selectAll (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:11772:14)\n  at HTMLUnknownElement.<anonymous> (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:11828:14)\n  at Array.d3_selectionPrototype.selectAll (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:11819:55)\n  at Object.plot (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:146696:18)\n  at plotOne (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:119599:17)\n  at Object.exports.plot (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:119563:9)\n  at drawData (../../node_modules/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js:110301:32)\n\nPlotlyTransform\n    \u2715 plots some data from an object (458ms)\n    \u2715 plots some data from a JSON string (217ms)\n    \u2715 processes updates (191ms)\nTest Suites: 1 failed, 1 total\nTests:       3 failed, 3 total\nSnapshots:   0 total\nTime:        3.659s\nRan all test suites.\nnpm ERR!

For the time being we can run:\n$(npm bin)/lerna run test\nto test across all the exported packages. Rebased, ready for review. phew \ud83d\ude05 . Yeah the other dev dependencies are still available so this makes it more like \"nteract-presets-and-dev-stuff\".. One thing I'd like to go ahead and start prototyping is a comments field, something like:\njs\n\"metadata\": {\n  \"nteract\": {\n    \"comments\": [],\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n  }\n}\nThis is completely ignoring authenticated usage. With a server side notebook model, this is a bit easier to deal with. The key benefit of putting it in the document is that you can view the comments offline (or leave more for yourself).. An aside - when we start indexing notebooks in Elasticsearch we'll need to be fairly explicit about what fields are indexed, etc.\nAs part of this, we need to take a look at the current tagging metadata.. Expanding on the notebook metadata that is in current v4, we can now provide some metadata that would be useful for display in a gallery as well as for indexing. The fields we have to work with for this are title (string) and authors (Array<Author>; Author = { name: string }). Some common fields that are used in knowledge repo and other environments include tags and a tldr / description. Since we'll namespace our chunk of these fields, a fleshed out metadata section could look like this:\njson\n{\n  \"title\": \"Named Display Updates\",\n  \"authors\": [{\"name\": \"Paul Ivanov\"}, {\"name\": \"Kyle Kelley\"}],\n  \"nteract\": {\n    \"tags\": [\"ipython\", \"display updates\", \"progress-bars\"],\n    \"description\": \"A Progressive look at updating outputs programmatically from IPython\"\n  }\n}\nI'd love for us to be able to provide an image or otherwise for a summary card.\n\nI'm not too terribly pleased with the design of the card I sketched out above, brings the point across though. Since I couldn't help myself, here's another design:\n\n. \nMinor tweaks. Ok, I'm off to bed. \ud83d\ude05 \n\n\n\n. All set here!. Thanks for the support!\nFor some users, the command mode is needlessly complex and for other users it doesn't do nearly enough. In the desktop app we're currently catering to the much simpler end of the UI/UX spectrum on purpose to enable users that are not familiar with command mode interfaces (students, analysts, etc.). We've been fairly deliberate in not focusing attention on implementing the command mode and edit mode.\nThis isn't to say that command mode is not useful - it is! nteract is not seeking to be a replacement for all users - people can and should still flock to the classic Jupyter notebook as well as JupyterLab.. Thanks @captainsafia.\nI certainly would like to have a command palette and would be amenable to implementing it someday.. Reciting Linus doesn't help your case. It completely dismisses the users we are accommodating while casting negativity to maintainers. We can find a way to discuss and improve the experience without attributing malice on the efforts of the people who come together to build this.. > Perhaps the sidebar could be made sticky and scroll with the cell. Or the output of the cell could have another sidebar. \nReally good point. It makes me think that a vertical bar that tracks along with the cell would be nice.. Keep submitting issues, it's good to have them outlined. I think this one was mentioned in an issue yet didn't have a good issue all on its own. I'm glad you've brought this up, I face this problem too.. This has come up again as I've been asked about supporting R Markdown in our jupyter extension.. Awesome! One approach could be to make reading from and writing to our in-memory format work well with rmarkdown. Then at least for now we can use the same UI and make sure to output to the right format.\nThat being said, I think we'd be missing a lot of knitr / code chunk options. Perhaps I'm overestimating that though?\nOne potential option -- if you'd like to go after this in person with folks we're holding the nteract global sprint at the end of July: https://github.com/nteract/global-sprint. This has gotten quite a bit better with our current kernel cleanup machinery.. Here's what I'm getting right now after logging in to publish:\n\nnteract 0.1.0\n. Note: our github publishing app now stays online with at least one node at all times now.. I think this is all set. Closing!. I'm going to leave the messaging/session refactor for another day as it would make this PR messier than intended. Mostly just want the editor component out.. Once this is in, I'll bring it into the notebook preview PR.. If I recall correctly, we read in raw cells with commutable. However, we don't have a cell component for raw cells.. \nknowledge_template.ipynb.zip\n. Reopening, we'll want to do a few more things:\n\nCreate a RawCell component that is merely an editor so that markdown isn't even attempted to be rendered\nExplore UI around raw cells - I intentionally left them out of the cell creator toolbar because I wanted the interface to be simple - perhaps we can put it in the top level menu (not the in-app menu)\n\nIn the future, I'm tempted to make some very tailored \"cell types\" that could rely on raw. The metadata.format field can be a mimetype (which could mean PNG, SVG, JSON, etc.) which could lead towards things like being able to draw in the notebook itself.. We now have a raw cell type, I think this is good for now.. Works for me, we'll figure out what raw cells mean to us soon enough.. This has been pretty well cleaned up. Since this is a pretty broad issue, I'm going to close it and we can create more focused issues.. This was addressed with our adoption of styled-jsx and bringing the codemirror styles in.. Every single <Editor> is a standalone CodeMirror area per cell. If you enable the linting or find-replace (which we do have!), it only applies to each cell individually. What you'd have to do is create a codemirror addon that is cognizant of every single cell. I've never gotten too far on this -- when doing find/replace I looked into it and it looked a bit overwhelming to do in any short amount of time.. I have new thoughts about this, especially since our document has totally searchable state. Getting those to match up with CodeMirror may prove to be tricky, I think it's pretty doable though. Probably a couple weeks of dedicated work. Note that there is per cell find/replace (cmd-f on mac for find, I can't recall the binding for replace).\nAs for CASH MONEY, the best route is through NumFocus:\n\nPage with all projects (so you can click through): https://www.numfocus.org/open-source-projects/\nDirect nteract page for donating through NumFocus: https://www.flipcause.com/widget/give_now/MTA5ODg=. Search and Replace is tracked in #1817 while linting is also tracked in #1790. Could we make this thread title and description only about linting @betatim?. Right now I've been running npm run build inside of the package I'm modifying.\n\nIf you want to auto-build it, run\n$(npm bin)/babel -d lib src --ignore '**/__tests__/**' --watch\nI definitely agree this is not the best developer experience. Teeny bit better than if these were in separate repositories though. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Closing, bit of a wishlist item I'm not real worried about now.. I like the approach in #1485, it lets a base setup be picked up in packages so we don't have to cargo cult it everywhere and we can still modify it for any particular package.. I look forward to when the display area has its own inline styles which can be overridden by a top level theme.. > Also, looks like CI failing from Cannot find module '@nteract/transforms' (besides flow). Is there somewhere I need to list @nteract/transforms as a dependency or do something else with it?\npackages/editor/package.json will need to have @nteract/transforms. After you add that in, run npm run lerna at the base of our repository and it will link up the packages for you.. For at least this flow error:\npackages/editor/src/wrapper.js:155\n155:             ReactDOM.render(<Transform data={bundle.get(mimetype)} />, node);\n                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ React element `Transform`. Expected React component instead of\n153:             const Transform = transforms.get(mimetype);\n                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Transform\nI think it's the Transform definition that is wrong, not yours. I was having trouble making that one work because of the MIMETYPE static property, so it's not in the best of states.. If we merge this in as is, I must say that I'm not a fan of having this in a pager at the bottom. I much prefer the inline display shown in Jupyter for inspection.\nPerhaps @Carreau has some good ideas here.. That's looking really good! The only things I'd worry about completing on this now is:\n\nGet tests passing\n(optionally) put an X in the close box. packages/editor/lib/wrapper.js.flow:179\n179:           ReactDOM.render(<Transform data={bundle.get(mimetype)} />, node);\n                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ React element `Transform`. Expected React component instead of\n175:           const Transform = transforms.get(mimetype);\n                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Transform\npackages/editor/src/wrapper.js:179\n179:           ReactDOM.render(<Transform data={bundle.get(mimetype)} />, node);\n                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ React element `Transform`.

Our current transform interface is a module which has an export of a React Component with a static property called MIMETYPE. I'm not sure how to get around the flow typing of this, so it might be that we change the interface to an exported object { transform: ReactComponent, MIMETYPE: string} then we'd be able to declare the type for it.\n. > I don't fully understand the implications of how changing the transform interface would affect the other parts of the codebase that utilize it.\nI'm effectively saying we would have to refactor all the transforms to conform to one new interface with the module exports, which would mean they would all be a major bump, semver wise. We could straddle the old API with the new one and make it a minor release, seems like it would be ok to just do the major release thing. We can make a separate PR that does this refactor.. I think for now the $FlowFixMe is fine. Add this line to the .flowconfig in the [options] section:\nsuppress_comment= \\\\(.\\\\|\\n\\\\)*\\\\$FlowFixMe\nThen where necessary to supress, comment with // $FlowFixMe: Some Reason.\nFor more on this type of suppression, check out the Flow docs.. This is looking real good. It's saying this needs a rebase -- can you do an interactive rebase here?. If it helps, I can rebase it for you. Otherwise, I'm more than happy to screenshare and pair to fix this up.. I'll have to do tomorrow April 4 or Thursday April 6.. Paired with Alex on a call to get this rebased as well as fix the build (enzyme & React 15.5 changes). I think this is in a good state to iterate from here on. :smile:. Looking at the flow output reminds me that we should set up flow to ignore the lib/ directory amongst all the packages. \ud83e\udd14  or is that the one we need since it's the one referenced by other libraries. \n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. I added on another type annotation to your last commit, though I think there's one more flow issue to fix up. If this passes let's merge it!. Oh I see, what's failing for me locally is an artifact of notebook-preview coming after this commit. This should pass shortly.. Thanks again for doing the v3 to in-memory v4 notebook conversion here. \ud83d\ude04 . Awww Appveyor, what's the issue?. Rekicking the appveyor build for now.. Looks like a hoisting problem, I think I better do some lerna package cleanup here (or make them depend on jest: *). Everything passes!. Hmmm... seems like it doesn't like what we add on to the Observable prototype. \ud83e\udd14 . Yeah the little raster looking thing that is on the left or right side. https://i.stack.imgur.com/FNfcn.jpg. Note: that's not my image I just grabbed one from Google image search that had arrows. :smile:. This one gets to me too, addressed it in https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/1500.. We write directly to disk and work with kernels directly over zeromq. Using the notebook server as is would not be easy within nteract. This is not something I personally would want to support or maintain.\nIf you want to start a project using the server directly, I recommend starting with electron-quickstart, having it start up a jupyter notebook server on the main process, and embedding URLs inside of it. From there you'll be able to gauge how difficult or easy it will be to build, even without nteract.\nThis at least illustrates that you desire the complete and original Jupyter notebook server. My recommendation there is to get involved in Jupyter to (1) get packages exported that you can use outside of the web app and (2) create a new electron app.. Great! @minrk also pointed out to me that they're using jupyterlab and jupyter js services for rendering notebook diffs in nbdime, worth checking out!. Thank you!. Sticky would be really cool, since you might be halfway through your document and want to update the header information.. That's definitely a good point too. The prototypes above are about as far as I'm going to go with this in the next few days, so it's pretty open for someone to tackle.. /cc @mpacer - probably worth having you see what I'm thinking about for editing the \"header\" information in the notebook. We're experimenting with some other metadata under an nteract key as well.. Yeah I was thinking this would be hidden by default and exposing some way of trigger it to show/hide.. Re: sticky, I was thinking of this like an overlay that shows up only as you edit it.. I'd still love to see this. We've got the mocks, our models for contents are getting more refined. It's probably worth tackling this during the next quarter.. Our tab completion is currently triggered by ctrl-space (manually) and otherwise behaves in a typeahead automatic mode. The reasoning behind this was that tab handling with codemirror was tricky since we also wanted it to respect tabs appropriately. We tinkered with the original Jupyter implementation and decided that it was a lot for us to maintain at the time. That being said, it's certainly open for an enterprising individual to handle.\nIf you're wanting introspection too, check out the work in progress PR #1488 by @alexandercbooth.. ctrl+. is the current way we trigger this now, though it definitely needs work. Would you want to help improve it @arudhir?. If I had to guess it's a case of needing all the packages upgraded together here.. Heh, the S3 outage means we can't download Electron. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Rekicked your appveyor build, we're probably in a long backlog for Travis.. I'm letting appveyor be the source of truth on this since you've tested this locally. I'll be closing greenkeeper's PRs too.. Oh hi greenkeeper! I'm the one that just upgraded that package. \ud83d\ude09 . The output looks alright, we should change the test up.. Thanks! I think we'll want a check that's more agnostic of inner structure in the future -- works for now though!. Thanks!. Looks like we've definitely got some windows work ahead of us to make this work on Windows out of the box without Python.. Is the choco setup for nteract now up to date?. > Although I have to say it would be really cool if at least one of the example-notebooks worked out of the box with the Node.js kernel \nThe \"Exploring Custom Revival with JSON.parse\" notebook used to, back when it was able to reach the dependency on Immutable.js. I'll make an issue for re-invigorating the example notebooks and grouping them by language type.. Are the packages being built on initial install?. I do want to move the Electron app inside the packages folder, wasn't sure when we would do it.. We have new commits since the last release, should we cut a new release of zeromq.js?. https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq.js/compare/v4.1.1...master. I wonder if we could set up some detection on pull to let developers know they need a clean slate.. It makes bootstrapping faster while filling your disk more. You'll have N copies of React and Immutable for instance.. Someday I'll come back to this. For now, I'm cutting down on my open PRs.. Thanks!\nMind bringing that over to notebook preview's themes as well? It's in packages/ here, sadly has separate themes... . Thanks!. We definitely need to figure out why those aren't loaded properly.\nAre you setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your startup scripts for your shell (.bashrc)?\nOne annoyance on OS X is that it invokes Applications with launchctl and does not create a shell for you. The shell-env was put in place to work around this issue by spawning a shell for the user.\nI'm installing Tensorflow on my mac now, I've only used it on remote systems prior to this.. Side question so that I can experience this - what kind of Mac do you have, what GPU do you use? My Macbook Pro (2015 model) only has the built in Intel GPU, and the newer Macs use AMD GPUs.\nAs for if you're able to extract the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, my first thought is adding to https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/2fec84bd74d92b8be88f6c9399e59993f703b59a/src/main/prepare-env.js#L5\nOff the cuff, I'm guessing it would look something like:\n```js\nimport shellEnv from \"shell-env\";\nimport Rx from \"rxjs/Rx\";\nconst spawn = require(\"spawn-rx\").spawn;\n/*\n * Observable of environment variable mappings\n * @param  {string} name environment variable name e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n * @return {Object}      { [name]: env_var_value }\n /\nfunction extractEnvVariable(name: string) {\n  return spawn(\"bash\", [\"-c\", echo $${name}]).map(\n    value => value === \"\" ? {} : { [name]: value }\n  );\n}\nlet env$ = Rx.Observable.fromPromise(shellEnv());\n// Possibly a workaround\nif (process.platform === \"darwin\") {\n  env$ = Rx.Observable\n    .merge(\n      env$,\n      extractEnvVariable(\"LD_LIBRARY_PATH\"),\n      extractEnvVariable(\"DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\")\n    )\n    .reduce((env, moreEnv) => Object.assign({}, env, moreEnv));\n}\nconst createEnv$ = env$\n  .first()\n  .do(env => {\n    Object.assign(process.env, env);\n  })\n  .publishReplay(1);\ncreateEnv$.connect();\nexport default createEnv$;\n```\nHowever, if I had to guess we probably need to look into how the kernel gets spawned (the above code is for locating kernels and other necessary paths).. This seems like an issue we should move into some docs. Is anyone game for making a page encapsulating this?. I feel like we've mostly gotten rid of our use of redux-actions, I'll go ahead and merge this regardless. \ud83d\ude04 . Ah great, thanks for moving the dependencies out from the electron app that are actually in packages/.. I like the ignoring option.\nGetting rid of the demo would make me a teeny bit sad, it was nice using notebook-preview-demo  to work on frontend bits with live reloading and avoiding all the other electron app build stuff.. This package has been deleted! Also it's now part of @nteract/showcase. \ud83d\ude04 . Thanks!. Since I couldn't help myself, here's it being used in notebook-preview for a statically rendered table (like on commuter, nbviewer):\n\n. Now if only we had some built in table -> vega React component here as well.. Rebased to get up to date dependencies.. Investigating https://bvaughn.github.io/react-virtualized/#/components/MultiGrid next.. Sweet! I tried it out locally and see what you mean quite well.\nI have a feeling that we need to move the functions inside of CellMeasurer out and focus on making the (table) cell rendering be very fast functions. Right now there's a lot of computation performed that could be cached and updated only when the props have changed.. Oh ha, and I just noticed CellMeasurerCache.. An alternative that we use at work is ag-grid.. This is definitely really slick now. A few notes on things we should either fix up or think about long term:\n\nHeader should be bold or at least stand out compared to cells\nIndices should also stand out as distinct (either of these could use thicker borders instead)\nSometimes the indices aren't lining up with the rows when I scroll (maybe the measurement is off?)\n\n\nSome optional things:\n\nRight align numbers\nLeft align strings\n. I just noticed the styling is top notch in the \"nteract\" theme. I'm just missing theming in the light version I suppose.\n\n\n. Super sweet stuff here, thanks @gnestor and @lgeiger!. Awesome!!!!\nI modified the notebook just now to include when there are multiple primary keys so we can pin them to the left.. Let's talk about height now!\n\nWe can dynamically set the height based on row height, number of rows, etc.\n\nnteract, like the jupyter notebook, has a way to expand the size of the cell to fit its contents. What I'd love to see is that the virtualized table is able to grow to the size of the window or be collapsed. Not sure how to achieve that though. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. We're not storing or passing height through currently. We do have available if they've expanded the outputs or not. When it's not in expanded view we could make it N pixels high and if it's expanded make it window.innerHeight? I guess we'd need to be tracking the change in height during a window's resize event which means we'd need to pass size through on the state.... > it might make more sense to listen at the top and pass it down as props to transforms\nI agree, we should make it top level somewhere, probably on the Notebook component.. > Expanded height probably shouldn't be full height because then the user can't see the source at the same time? Or maybe that's the whole point of collapsed?\nThat's the point of collapsed, though you're right about possibly not taking up the full height.. Since this passes tests and works pretty well, I think we can move the checklist to a new issue and merge this.. Woo! What a big feature.. Hey Francesco,\nWe don't currently have a way (or plan to) edit code from non-notebook files within nteract. Right now the pattern is to open a separate editor for scripts. Some productivity changes I think we could make would be:\n\na Show in Finder option that would open the folder where the notebook is located\nan Open Terminal Here option that would open a terminal in the same directory\n\nThis doesn't get you quite to editing scripts; I hope it would get you closer to an ideal state because those two we can get done pretty quickly.\n/cc @lgeiger - time for term launcher!. Ha, I wait for CI to pass and another version comes out.. Welcome to the nteract party! \ud83c\udf89 . Totally forgot about this! It's in last night's v0.2.0 release (finally shipped!). Fully expected linting to fail because I have prettier enabled right now. X____X. Ran npm run lint:fix over that.. Ah, it's the JSON schema validator. They made a release 6 days ago. Perhaps we should pin explicitly to a version that works for us (or submit a patch for this).. This is no longer occurring (unless I'm mistaken). Closing the issue, feel free to re-open.. Great!\nThere's work in progress by @alexandercbooth in #1488. I'd see where you can lend hand in testing that and figure out where Alex is at with it. It looks really close to being ready.\nClosing as duplicate of #1254.. Excellent! Thank you.. We should try this again on the latest 0.8.x series. Thanks for reporting this @essicolo.. What was the output when you ran\npython -m ipykernel install --user\nWhat's your output when you run:\njupyter kernelspec list --json. There's a tradeoff here -- if you want to be able to double-click to install notebooks, you have to install a copy (afaik). If you want to use the development copy in-place, you can still open notebooks with File -> Open. You're free to figure out a way to register your local dev copy on linux as the main one. @jarmokivekas is one of the developers on Linux -- the rest of us are on Windows and macOS.. Duplicate of #1242. There's also an open PR that attempted to fix it in #1432.\nMy main suggestion in the issues related to this is to use the <base> element to allow resolving relative files. The reason they don't display is that the \"location\" of the browser is our index.html inside the package.. More refactoring would need to be done, here's a good start @jdetle: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/349#issuecomment-278180910. Now that GitHub released a formal spec for GitHub flavored Markdown we'll likely adopt it, which would include tables. There's not a JavaScript implementation that is compliant yet (this one is written in C), I'm looking forward to it though!. > I know in the backend jupyter uses pandoc but not for browser stuff, right?\nThat's mostly correct, depends on what's being used in nbconvert.\n\nWhat does Jupyter Notebook use?\n\nJupyter notebook uses marked, which is not as maintained as we would like it to be. It also has subtle differences with the spec for commonmark (ex-standard markdown). We're discussing the future in Jupyter there as well and want to be as close to the formal specification for commonmark as well.. > I would like my notebooks to have a layout language that allows me to refer to the input or output of a cell and to sections in the text\nMe too! We'll need a totally separate notebook format for that though. No time for me personally to charter or implement that.. Closed by #2350.. We implement Jupyter's version of MathJax which allows for inline \\LaTeX between $ and $$ for block/multi-line. To use a literal $ on a single line you have to escape it with \\\\$. There's a longer, more detailed explanation and (hopeful) extension point on the commonmark forums here: https://talk.commonmark.org/t/mathematics-extension/457/11. > possibly because mathjax gives up on my notebook\nThat's interesting. I wonder if that's because nteract does mathjax rendering per display area rather than globally.. :smile: That's only going to get better over time too, there are a lot of optimizations to our loading of initial assets that we haven't gotten around to yet.. Electron does the native bits (menus, dialogs, ...). We make React components for the notebook UI.. Likely not, I'm guessing it means that CSS wasn't written for h5 onwards.. We have the styles for this colocated in one spot, it shouldn't be too bad to fix. I added some labels so I can group it with other output changes I was planning on making.. Thank you!. No problem, it's looking pretty good on the data side. We've mostly got UI/UX work ahead of us. I know what people are going to ask for next (filtering, sorting, etc. kernel side, triggered from UI)... Not touching that anytime soon though. We'll aim for consistency first. :smile:\nThank you again so much for pushing forward with a spec and getting it out there so we can make the table experience much better across Jupyter (and likely elsewhere)!. Published this component just now!\nnpm install @nteract/transform-dataresource\nSince we're missing a README on npm, I added it to the checklist here.. Another thing we should also do is try to get this mimetype into IRkernel and PySpark.\n/cc @rdblue @flying-sheep @takluyver @janschulz @holdenk. Updated the todo above.. Thanks to @gnestor this renders CSVs on commuter too, demo here: https://nteract-commuter.herokuapp.com/view/test.csv. Done in #2732. Yeah I'm thinking two different ways of setting it in order of least to most precedence:\n\nThe default as is here\nAn environment variable NTERACT_TILE_SET or NTERACT_MAPBOX_TOKEN\nMetadata from the output. For example, like this:\n\nIPython.display.display({'application/geojson': '...'},\n  metadata={'application/geojson': {\n    'tile_url': 'https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/{id}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png...'\nHowever, in looking, I see that @gnestor added on to the new IPython.display.GeoJSON to take these fields in https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/10288.\nWe'lll need to handle this metadata in our frontend components for the shipped app.\n. Whoooooa, that's super cool.. Bonus: Whiteboard Pictures!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. OMG yes! \ud83d\ude47 Thank you thank you thank you.. > Do you want the application \"nteract Helper.app\" to accept incoming network connections?\nThat's the mac firewall (you won't see this if you turn it off). After approving the first time for a signed app, it won't show up again. Since, as you said, every opening of the unsigned app creates a separate dock icon, this annoying dialogue comes up.. Would be cool to see that integrated @AlJohri! We just shipped 0.2.0 and I'm putting together release notes now.. > my main use case is database credentials - I use notebooks pretty often to store mongo/sql queries\nThat makes sense.\n\nif the cli integrates with an existing nteract instance, what do you think would be best practice for env vars?\n\nI can't think of a good way really. Stewing on it a bit, one way to do it is to set environment variables in your kernelspec file. \n\nThere are some drawbacks of multiple instances of the app, primarily taking up more memory than necessary (which is pretty big for these electron apps) as well as making it really confusing when viewing it in the switcher (how do you figure out which one has the notebook you're working on).\nIt's pretty clear we've got some tradeoffs here. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. I've labeled this as new-contributor-friendly and am more than happy to guide anyone who attempts to document any of these packages.. > Would you like a README to be created that explains how the component works?\nYeah, similar to how we do transfroms:\n\nHow to install the package\nBasic usage of the component\n\nOn a side note, the easiest to start with are likely display-area and notebook-preview. Admittedly, as I look at <Editor /> myself it's pretty unwieldy. The start might be to just list install there and how it gets used in notebook-preview.. It's ok if you do them one at a time too.. New list:\n$ while read d; do   [[ -r ${d}/README.md ]] || echo ${d}; done < <(find . -type d -depth 1 -print)\n./commuter-frontend\n./dropdown-menu\n./editor\n./fs-observable\n./markdown\n./messaging\n./octicons\n./transform-dataresource\n./types\n./vega-embed2\n./webpack-configurator. I wondered how discoverable / easy the in between buttons are. You're making me think it should be one long flat button with two sides for code vs. markdown.. > to appear around the cursor when moving it between two cells instead of in the middle\nYeah, I think we need to make the hover boundary much larger and then we can have that.. > Can you renew the mapbox access token?\nWe should probably switch to openstreetmap for the defaults.. Also I think I took the token from sample docs originally, can't find another one without creating one that would be associated to a mapbox account.. Thanks @gnestor!. Thank you for all the excellent issue writeups and making this PR.\nWelcome to the nteract party! :tada:. In the interpreter, ipython console, and jupyter notebook, __file__ is not defined as well:\n```\nIn 1: file\n\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n in ()\n----> 1 file\nNameError: name 'file' is not defined\nIn [2]:\nDo you really want to exit ([y]/n)? y\n$ python\nPython 2.7.13 (default, Dec 17 2016, 23:03:43)\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.42.1)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\n\n\nfile\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nNameError: name 'file' is not defined\n```\n\n\n\nWhile we do have a file here, IPython has no way (currently) to identify it.. Likely in ipython/ipython. However, you'll probably get some push back about how jupyter takes a position of kernels not knowing what frontend they're in. If it were to be supported, new messages for the jupyter protocol would have to be established to make a cross-language way of handling this.. From #1467:\n\nFor some users, the command mode is needlessly complex and for other users it doesn't do nearly enough. In the desktop app we're currently catering to the much simpler end of the UI/UX spectrum on purpose to enable users that are not familiar with command mode interfaces (students, analysts, etc.). We've been fairly deliberate in not focusing attention on implementing the command mode and edit mode.\n\nAs a follow-on -- someone can implement and maintain this. I've been steering clear of implementing it personally.. Thanks for updating this, it's awesome.. Background: our editor component is causing the entire notebook to scroll to the bottom.

From https://status.npmjs.org/incidents/t4l5hdlgw1mq\n\nWe are investigating lag on replicating publications to our leaf nodes as well as downstream to registry mirrors.. Thanks for putting this together!\nwe would only package the default theme and let the Electron app be the implementation of our components + themes\n\nThat is sounding pretty good to me.. Now that I've been using several of these in different capacities, I'll first admit I love styled-jsx quite a bit. What pains me though is that we're stuck with some amount of global css due to codemirror. :(. We're on styled-jsx now, wooooo! \ud83c\udf89 . The main way that jupyter does multiple outputs is with display_data messages. Roughly, they look like this:\n```\ndisplay_data.content: {\n  data: {\n    'text/html': 'hey'\n  }\n}\ndisplay_data.content: {\n  data: {\n    'text/html': 'woo'\n  }\n}\n```\nRecently, update_display_data was added which allows for updating prior displays by way of a display_id inside the transient field:\n```\ndisplay_data.content: {\n  data: {\n    'text/html': 'hey'\n  },\n  transient: {\n    'display_id': '1234'\n  }\n}\nupdate_display_data.content: {\n  data: {\n    'text/html': 'HEY'\n  },\n  transient: {\n    'display_id': '1234'\n  }\n}\n```\nIt seems like a TensorFlow summary object could end up as a mimetype here rather than going out on the stream interface, which lets you emit to same parent message (which goes to a cell in nteract & jupyter notebook).\n/cc @craigcitro for thoughts on stream messages. Very valid. Here's some example IPython code to do it in one cell:\nimport IPython.display as d\nd.display(d.HTML('<b>within display data</b>'))\nd.HTML('<b>an execute result</b>')\nThe execute result (at least in python) is the last evaluation. You can fire off as many display data messages as you want before an execute result (or even after, really).. I'm going to redo this on top of changes in #1595 . Some suggested text to add in:\n````markdown\nRender Jupyter notebook outputs in a trim little React component.\nInstallation\nnpm install @nteract/display-area\nUsage\njsx\nimport Display from '@nteract/display-area`\n<Display outputs={outputs} />\nHere outputs is an Immutable.js structure with all the outputs of a cell. Note: this does require trim, clean editions of the multiline cells as is done in @nteract/commutable.\nUsed in context of a notebook, you will likely be extracting it from a cell:\njsx\n<Display outputs={this.props.cell.get('outputs')} />\n```. We can keep iterating on this -- it's worth checking out what's in [notebook-preview](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/packages/notebook-preview/src/code-cell.js#L73-L82), one of the components that uses this.. As for CI, I'm going to get that situated / fixed up.. [L1587](https://travis-ci.org/nteract/nteract/jobs/216103384#L1587) is a good spot.. Maybe we can globally installprebuild-install` early on just to make our builds a bit faster?. Woo!. Thanks for finding and fixing this John!. Solid intro README!\nThere are conflicts here and it looks like you did a merge commit locally. Could I have you do an interactive rebase against master? You should make this on a separate branch, github flow style, rather than master of your fork.\nLet me know if you need help with either of those.. No problem, thanks for continuing this!. How's this nowadays?. I think that expanded by default on printing makes complete sense. We do the same thing for notebook viewer-like things. I realize this means it's not as easy as a stylesheet with that change.. Side / separate note -- the hidden inputs/outputs settings should remain consistent while printing though (then you can have reports backed by code that don't show the code).. Is this one done now with the current PDF code?. Oh we're using a proper spawner now I can fix this up.. Oh whoops, thanks.. This is fixed on master.. Thank you!. The other part about the cell toolbar that irks me is when I can't click the text in the cells. Makes me think we should have it placed higher. What do you think?. Thanks!. I'll come back to this one tomorrow when I have all my brain cells so I can answer your questions. I'll give this a spin too.. This makes good sense.. > Also question, is it worth doing the focused/hover in react while it can\njust be a css display option that could also have animations ?\nWe use the hover state in other areas, so we'll probably be in a dual mode. It's ok to experiment with introducing animation into this. :smile:\nP.S. Came back to this PR because I'm compiling the 0.2.0 release notes.. That seems reasonable and matches the up/down expectation at boundaries.. Just checked, this is still an issue.. Whoa.. Now that we have better kernel management (and unique internal IDs for them) I can't reproduce this at all anymore. What do you think @Carreau?. Thanks.. Wow, keep it coming!. Ideally it would only be one. This could be fixed if we only do the area below the cell as a drop target and then have the top area as a special drop target.. Is this still happening?. We now set fresh notebooks to use a new Date() so I think this is A-OK now.. /cc @jayphelps. It seems this is actually fixed on master, so I'm going to close this.. Thank you, this is looking good.. How's this nowadays?. Ok cool, I'll pin to 16.8.0.. Thank you for repeating, Kyle not read so good.. Taking https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/releases/tag/v4.0.0-rc.2 for a spin now too, though we could merge this before I go crazy upgrading all the lerna packages. :wink:. Ok since the changes enclosed here pass and the app is currently working, I'd like to go ahead and merge this.\nI'm working with the newer Immutable and React+ReactDOM, it will take a bit to get us up to date.. Looks like we'll be ok bumping this, the warnings are coming from within Enzyme. We'll need https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/pull/876 to get rid of the warnings.. Does it say any more about what or how? I'm not sure what to make of this. Does any other standalone electron app report the same?. We still need to sign our windows application. If you're worried about it, build it from source.. Closing, since it's not our issue and Windows signing is tracked elsewhere.. I'm not sure. This seems like something we should have in metadata, either under our own nteract namespace or in whatever the standard metadata is for this.. That's great, thanks @jkornblum! We may want to have some code in that does a migration from outputExpanded to (!) collapsed when we load to support current nteract users.. Something else I'd love for us to standardize on -- the hide_input metadata: https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/blob/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/hide_input/main.js. /cc @jcb91 - any gotchas on us making the metadata from the hide_input and hide_input_all be standard in nteract?. I think we've standardized this a bit better now, so I'm going to close this.. This is pretty strange to me, I upgraded my ipykernel and it's working fine. Are you using Anaconda as well @bgarchow?. I think we're going to have to get what we can from the dev tools. I'd be happy to screenshare with you to try to figure it out. My other suggestion would be to re-run the python -m ipykernel install --user step and fully restart nteract.. We just did a screenshare and made a new kernelspec which only differed in name (folder name) and display name (in the kernel.json). I'm at a loss for words for why the kernel was hanging. The only thing I can see different in this setup is that python was the root conda environment.. I am definitely a fan of a reduced Plotly package, like our Mathjax one. It could probably even be built from the non-dist version so that it doesn't bundle it's own versions of d3, regl, etc. (That's part of the size problem). Considering even Mathjax electron is due for a name change, I'd call the repo minimal-plotly. Package name @nteract/plotly sounds good!. Ah yeah, for namespaced packages you have to set the public part yourself.. https://github.com/nteract/minimal-plotly/pull/3. We shouldn't worry about this one anymore and just embrace the monorepo.. Seems like our linting is compliant. \ud83d\ude04 . Normally electron builder should handle rebuilding the native module for you, @lgeiger would know best there. You may also need to add the module to our webpack config (look where zeromq is listed).. LOL, amsters, love those hamsters.. oh, for tests, you'll probably want to add it to our current mocking setup -- I think we have mock-requires for a lot of those modules. > Would it instead be appropriate (or even preferable), to write a custom script that accesses the user's own git client (and disables the functionality if they don't have git installed)?\nI would not enjoy maintaining scripts cross platform (both running and parsing), I'd rather work with git-utils.\n\nwe ask the git-utils team if they would be interested in providing prebuilt binaries via prebuild\n\ncertainly worth an ask, we could show them how the zeromq one works \ud83d\ude04 . Ready to come back to this @alexandercbooth?. I'm going to go ahead and close this, we can pair on it later or feel free to reopen when you're ready.. This is so cool!. ~~Looks like one of our dependencies had an in-place change. I'll be spending some time this week bringing us up to date, then you can rebase.~~ All set!. Sweet.\nThe Travis error I'm seeing looks related here, perhaps just a missing property in the tests?\n```\n  \u25cf complete \u203a handles code completion\n    TypeError: Cannot read property '_experimental' of undefined\n  at MapSubscriber.project (packages/editor/src/complete.js:115:191)\n  at MapSubscriber.Object.<anonymous>.MapSubscriber._next (node_modules/rxjs/operator/map.js:77:35)\n  at MapSubscriber.Object.<anonymous>.Subscriber.next (node_modules/rxjs/Subscriber.js:89:18)\n  at FirstSubscriber.Object.<anonymous>.FirstSubscriber._emitFinal (node_modules/rxjs/operator/first.js:135:25)\n  at FirstSubscriber.Object.<anonymous>.FirstSubscriber._emit (node_modules/rxjs/operator/first.js:118:14)\n  at FirstSubscriber.Object.<anonymous>.FirstSubscriber._next (node_modules/rxjs/operator/first.js:97:18)\n  at FirstSubscriber.Object.<anonymous>.Subscriber.next (node_modules/rxjs/Subscriber.js:89:18)\n  at MapSubscriber.Object.<anonymous>.MapSubscriber._next (node_modules/rxjs/operator/map.js:83:26)\n  at MapSubscriber.Object.<anonymous>.Subscriber.next (node_modules/rxjs/Subscriber.js:89:18)\n  at SafeSubscriber._next (packages/editor/node_modules/@nteract/messaging/lib/index.js:105:20)\n  at SafeSubscriber.Object.<anonymous>.SafeSubscriber.__tryOrUnsub (node_modules/rxjs/Subscriber.js:236:16)\n  at SafeSubscriber.Object.<anonymous>.SafeSubscriber.next (node_modules/rxjs/Subscriber.js:185:22)\n  at Subscriber.Object.<anonymous>.Subscriber._next (node_modules/rxjs/Subscriber.js:125:26)\n  at Subscriber.Object.<anonymous>.Subscriber.next (node_modules/rxjs/Subscriber.js:89:18)\n  at SafeSubscriber._next (packages/editor/node_modules/@nteract/messaging/lib/index.js:70:20)\n  at SafeSubscriber.Object.<anonymous>.SafeSubscriber.__tryOrUnsub (node_modules/rxjs/Subscriber.js:236:16)\n  at SafeSubscriber.Object.<anonymous>.SafeSubscriber.next (node_modules/rxjs/Subscriber.js:185:22)\n  at Subscriber.Object.<anonymous>.Subscriber._next (node_modules/rxjs/Subscriber.js:125:26)\n  at Subscriber.Object.<anonymous>.Subscriber.next (node_modules/rxjs/Subscriber.js:89:18)\n  at Subject.Object.<anonymous>.Subject.next (node_modules/rxjs/Subject.js:55:25)\n  at Object.<anonymous> (packages/editor/__tests__/editor-spec.js:115:14)\n\n```. Wow!\n\nLooking pretty slick. :smile:. You can do checks on individual elements instead of the whole object.. Yeah, I think we'll handle the coverage drop for now.. Guess this means we've got nteract and hydrogen support ready to go!. Thanks for reporting! I had no idea this behavior was happening. It seems we'd have to provide a dialog ourselves since it's not built in.. Woo!. There are a few flow issues:\npackages/transform-dataresource/lib/index.js.flow:23\n 23:       <VirtualizedGrid\n           ^ React element `VirtualizedGrid`\n 61:   props: Props;\n              ^^^^^ property `height`.

I'm going to go ahead and bring this in since flow is passing, even though the coverage dropped a little bit.. Looks like there is some lerna dependency synchronization I should do before publishing:\nThe repository root depends on jest@^19.0.0, which differs from the more common jest@^19.0.2.\n\"@nteract/transform-dataresource\" package depends on jest@^19.0.2, which differs from the hoisted jest@^19.0.0.\nThe repository root depends on rimraf@^2.5.2, which differs from the more common rimraf@^2.6.1.\n\"@nteract/transform-dataresource\" package depends on rimraf@^2.6.1, which differs from the hoisted rimraf@^2.5.2.\n\"@nteract/notebook-preview-demo\" package depends on react-virtualized@^9.2.1, which differs from the hoisted react-virtualized@^9.7.3.. We've been on an older version because of a scrolling bug, we should test this out before merging.. Does this no longer show the scrolling bug?. Closed by #2350.. Sweet stuff. How should we hack on individual packages while working on the main app? Same build steps as before?. At least two travis failures right now:\n\nhttps://travis-ci.org/nteract/nteract/jobs/227225050\nhttps://travis-ci.org/nteract/nteract/jobs/227225049\n\nLooks like the same one, while building native modules.. The data key came from an update to github?. Perhaps we should pin this more tightly (only patch releases with ~) since we don't touch this section of the code all that often. Then again, I guess it forces us to keep moving it forward. . Thanks all!. I'm going to assume this is good, bringing it in and doing the yeoman's work of getting everything in line here.. This will likely conflict with your PR @carreau, yet should provide much easier ways of overriding behavior here.. Don't merge this, I'm going to learn how to use var.ci and adjust the config here. :smile:. I'll play with this another time.. I'll give it a go with my windows laptop this next week, devoting time to builds across platforms so we can ship on all the platforms soon.. Great, thanks all.. The tests still get run on the data resource package if you take out the test line? When rebuilding a single package can we still do it from within the package for? Do we have to have jest, etc. all installed globally?. Thanks for bringing this back, when we were waiting on fbjs we had to hold back for a bit.. I can go ahead and ship this too for Hydrogen's sake unless you've got some more things.. If this is for use with the javascript kernel, it picks up node_modules relative to where the notebook is created. Example:\nmy_notebook.ipynb\nnode_modules/\n  d3/\nTo install packages, you'll have to use a terminal separately to npm install them as ijavascript does not support magics (iirc).. No problem, happy hacking!. > I think your 'hidden' wording is a better expression, so perhaps we should migrate to that as well...\nAs long as we're consistent I'm happy. I've been hoping to standardize the metadata we're using in #1518, but I haven't been able to come back to that PR again for a bit.. We now have a saveFailed action this ends up triggering.. > Looks like we're missing lodash.debounce\nI see how I made that fail now.

The warnings come from within webpack land -- perhaps what we need to figure out is why this dep is being webpacked since we don't want this on the frontend anyways. Actually... I think I know... It's in the main process code within prepare-env.js. It looks like this is addressed in cross-spawn@6.0.0\nProbably the most relevant PR I made for this, since it's for shell-env: https://github.com/sindresorhus/shell-env/pull/7\n. Sweet!\nIIRC, they were taken out because npm run build:renderer:watch would run out of memory. That was webpack 1 though. On to the new future. Thanks @jdetle!. You'll have to trigger successive builds to see the memory leak's effect.\nSince all seems well, let's go with it!. For reference, Altair / VegaLite output these as separate display data messages:\ntext/html:\n```html\n\n\n.vega-embed svg, .vega-embed canvas {\n  border: 1px dotted gray;\n}\n\n.vega-embed .vega-actions a {\n  margin-right: 6px;\n}\n\n```\napplication/javascript:\n```js\nvar spec = {/ bunch of JSON /};\nvar selector = \"#079a8a85-5f07-45e3-94bf-6331df611979\";\nvar type = \"vega-lite\";\nvar output_area = this;\nrequire(['nbextensions/jupyter-vega/index'], function(vega) {\n  vega.render(selector, spec, type, output_area);\n}, function (err) {\n  if (err.requireType !== 'scripterror') {\n    throw(err);\n  }\n});\n```\nOriginating python from VegaLite's _ipython_display_:\npython\n    def _ipython_display_(self):\n        \"\"\"Display the visualization in the Jupyter notebook.\"\"\"\n        id = uuid.uuid4()\n        publish_display_data(\n            {'text/html': self._generate_html(id)},\n            metadata={'jupyter-vega': '#{0}'.format(id)}\n        )\n        publish_display_data(\n            {'application/javascript': self._generate_js(id)},\n            metadata={'jupyter-vega': '#{0}'.format(id)}\n        ). I'm going to rebase on top of #1714 and see about making a separate little requirejs shim combining these two.. I want to come back to this at some point, not sure how it will play out in the electron app though so I'll be closing #1714 as well.. > Update reduceOutput to always use createImmutableOutput.\nOh right, you already said here that we'd move reduceOutput into here. Silly me.. By the way, my approval here means that I think the approach is :cool:.. Now that I'm thinking about this some more, I think we should handle this at the level of the message processing from the stream. We'll be able to handle backpressure further up the stack and only present to React what's ready in a reasonable time.. Did you have any more thoughts on this?. That would be cool, I'd like to see that feature here too.. This is reachable today via hitting ctrl-space (that's what triggers our completion).\n\n\nI suppose the real issue here is the supporting of tab for completion (we have an issue somewhere for that...). It works!\n\nTime to push the code.\n. Ready for feedback @lgeiger, primarily for the sake of Hydrogen. I started with \"just make it work\" and haven't adapted the webview stuff yet. Outline a plan and I'll tackle it. :smile: I'm still iterating a bit with the requirejs setup, as I want to use something similar in #1709 for the web based frontends too.. Full query across all public notebooks for use of requirejs calls: https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/savedquery/300830567303:6116513b17ca4a77b58fec869fe5a846\n\ud83d\ude04 .

Note that I filtered out any occurences that were less than 2.. Note that dato / graphlab / turi come up often in the results as well, as part of a coursera course. I can't tell if they're well supported any more -- I'd like to use a canonical version as much as possible.. Ok now that I've had a go at this for a bit, it's definitely seeming like we'd need to approach parts of this differently:\nLong term plan\nJS output and HTML output should have the same output context / area. This likely means doing a unified iframed (webview for electron) display area. We'd still inject dependencies (vega, plotly, etc.)\nShort term plan\nProvide document and window to the \"sandbox\" so we don't break current functionality. The only thing that's changing here is that we're providing a requirejs \"shim\" of sorts and for Atom, we'll be using vm. We'll also be able to provide better error messages for use of objects we don't have (e.g. IPython, Jupyter).. Once this passes, it's ready to go and provides us a nice path for supporting vega/altair, d3, and informing users in a much richer way about what we can and can't support.. Whoa! Ok I'll check that out.. I'm beginning to think that HTML output should end up in an iframe that we provide certain libraries into, while also handling the resize. I'm going to try out a little mockup.. Will come back to this again later. Cleaning up PRs for now.. Still waiting on that Immutable 4.0.0 release, hopefully that will fix it.\n/cc @leebyron. Never!\nOk, just not until later.. Just tested this out and it works beautifully. Much thanks for this simplification.. Gosh, has it been this long since May??!\nAt least a lot of things have been fixed since then. \ud83d\ude04 \nSome of the big items that were blocking me on release before are now cleared up (npm 5, flow and immutable partially fixed up), so I'm hopeful about getting the fixes in that were mentioned above within this week.. Alright, I think this is in a good state for me to try to package another release. It's definitely happening tonight... Probably after the kids go to bed though. \ud83d\ude04 . We're well past 0.2.0, time to close this one!. Definitely in favor here.. I'd just call this a minor release. If someone wants this explicit behavior they can override the text transform.. Certainly patch for this one, though since it's part of the other change you'll have the overall minor release.. Woo, local links are working now!\n\nThere's a bit of pain in initial refresh while the <base> tag gets changed up.. Coming back to this one now, rebasing. I'm going to see about closing down a bunch of my open PRs while I get cranking on the web nteract again.. I think I'd rather use this PR as a reference if/when I take on implementing it again, so I'm going to close it for now.. weeeeee. \ud83d\ude82 \ud83d\ude82 \ud83d\ude82 \ud83d\ude82 \ud83d\ude82 \ud83d\ude82 \ud83d\ude82 \ud83d\ude82 . This will be a nice stability change -- background output from the kernel on stdout and stderr will be dropped and stdin is not available (just on the kernel process).. Assuming we don't end up with the travis train of commits, this will be good to merge in.. Uh oh!. Thanks.. Let me get the yarn update in here too.. I assume this ok nowadays?. Hurrah! I'll help work this through with you. I'm in favor of switching all of commutable over to plain objects (frozen objects too pretty please).. Once we tightly specify these, we'll be able to have exact definitions of the metadata we support for each transform too. \ud83d\ude04 . This highlights to me that we need tests for notebook-preview, even if a super simple one. We have to adapt that package to the new API too.. Now that I'm looking at this again I'm surprised you didn't modify commutable to no longer have the outputs in immutable form.\nIt just dawned on me that display updates might not work now because of how we use keypaths. Try out the example notebook at example-notebooks/display-updates.ipynb. > Just checked, I didn't experienced any problems with the display update notebook.\nTry running through the display update notebook, saving it, then reopening it.\nI'm suggesting this because of how the keypaths work.. Ok, I've tried this out too. I think we should push this out for the sake of Hydrogen. We can adjust things for the desktop app and figure out any edge cases as we move completely off of Immutable.. I'm running into a build error locally that I think is related to the prepublish mechanism being different in npm5. I'll be back with some other fixes shortly. :wink:. I'll go ahead and close this in light of other refactors and major changes going through. When we touch a file it will get prettified anyways.. After this next one passes, we're set and ready for npm5+ (while still supporting npm4).. > Looks like we run into lerna/lerna#856 with npm 5.\nohhhhhhhhh. Definitely going to rebase this one to squish down the changes after its working.. Cool now Travis is passing and appveyor is failing. \n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Fixed up some pieces, rebased. Time to see how this fairs across 6 and 8.. There's an issue with fcopy-pre-bundled's latest release on node 6 it seems.. xref: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/1651. Woo, everything passes!. Closing in favor of #1738.. Two things were causing this issue -- the classic theme and an overriden line-height. Now that we've removed the classic theme and the typography is not awkwardly changed, this is not an issue.. Woo!. Done in #1781. About to be shipped in 0.2.0 too!. Thanks for reporting this!\nThe light theme has a stylesheet for printing that makes the selected cell styling not show. It seems like the same work needs to be done on the classic theme.. @Madhu94 You can hide inputs and outputs using the cell's toolbar. Only visible cells will be printed.. I totally agree that ctrl-enter should hide the text editing box on Markdown. This was a regression in 0.1.0.\nxref: #1444 . Since we've finished off some recent refactors I decided to go after this one, fixing it in #2327. One thing with markdown and cell focus that I'd love to have back is the ability to move between cells when markdown is in view mode still. Something to tackle later!. Went ahead and tackled the markdown navigation issue too. We will get a release out shortly.. Is this better now that we've added more padding?. Everything passes here too!. Oh wait, I have some more to make this use all the yarn steps.. I'll go ahead and merge this since it keeps thing as they were with yarn while allowing npm 5 to work.. Thank you!. I left some notes, I think this is fantastic to bring in for now though. :smile:\nThe approach I originally wanted to take was to make this part of commutable -- I now see that it pretty much has to be done by the originating app on save.. annnnd welcome to the nteract party! :tada:. Since commutable works outside the electron app, it's perfect where you put it.. I'd certainly like that to be configurable and easy to setup. I don't have the cycles for it at the moment personally though.. Thanks @Madhu94! We do have an nteract.json that gets placed in jupyter config dir you can persist to that lets you set the theme by name, which at least makes it a starting point to work at this for persisting the setting and where to read it from.\n\nI understand, you've got a lot going on here. I figured I'd submit the issue and whenever it gets tackled (weeks, months, whatever) is fine.\n\nThanks @airdrik, happy to see you're using nteract. :smile: I'll be spending more cycles :soon: so we can get the next release out. \ud83d\ude00 . In the time since this issue was opened we both gained new themes and then reduced back to only light and dark due to a lack of cycles to keep porting themes to new structures. We now have a declarative set of base styles and really need to figure out how we'd expose configurability for theming.\ncc @theengineear . @essicolo can you make new issues for each of those feature requests?. Hmmm, that's an interesting one. UI wise I would hope it come out to something fairly native like the <details> tag.\n\nExpand me\nInside pieces\n\n. I'd certainly like to. Most of my time lately has been focused on getting a web app version of nteract going. Here's everything we did for milestone 1 of the jupyter extension: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/milestone/8?closed=1\nHere's our current milestone: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/milestone/9. Plan wise, I'd \u2764\ufe0f to have this and would absolutely support efforts to build it. We haven't slated it for a milestone though given everything else we need to get in.. Thanks for doing this!. We've... taken out pinned cells so... I think this is fixed by virtue of there not being a feature to fix...\n\ud83d\ude2c Let me know if you badly want pinned cells back, they were a bear to maintain.. Look at you go! Thanks for doing the necessary gardening. :smile:. \ud83d\ude47 Thank you!. Great, thanks! I've been looking forward to this change. :smile:. Reopening now that I'm trying more modules..

We are super SSR ready nowadays, closing!. One major drawback in my PR here is that I copied over CSS to make it available for next.js to serve from /static when I really wish I was loading from /node_modules. In reality, I don't want to use any css in this way -- I'd rather just embed it with styled-jsx.  \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. We also should tweak the editor component some more so we have the static version of the codemirror cells here. Otherwise there's a little bit of a flicker waiting for codemirror to instantiate (I think).\n\nHowever, as you can see in the GIF it loads super ffffast (I did not modify the video there).. Ok, I've ported over some of the styles to the default <textarea> so it's a bit less jarring. We need some adjustments to how we do the css to make this maintainable. Works for now though!\n\nI'm about ready to change up the HTML transform so that it dangerouslySetInnerHTMLs when on the server while doing the proper thing on the client side (the current document node creation).\n. From Travis build logs:\nnpm ERR! peer dep missing: ajv@>=5.0.0, required by ajv-keywords@2.1.0. Uh oh, that's master failing: https://travis-ci.org/nteract/nteract/builds/251355182. All is set now after #1773 . \ud83d\ude47 Thank you!!!. Thank you so much, I'm super happy about npm 5. One less default tool required.. Closed in #1774 . On a separate note, I configured my remotes wrong apparently. Oops. Stuck waiting on multiple Travis builds now...\norigin  git@github.com:nteract/nteract.git (fetch)\norigin  git@github.com:nteract/nteract.git (push)\nrgbkrk  git@github.com:nteract/nteract.git (fetch)\nrgbkrk  git@github.com:nteract/nteract.git (push). It's looking like the issue stems with something in ajv (which we don't directly depend on). nbschema only exports the literal schema and we use jsonschema for validation in the conformance tests.. Oh whoops, now that I've changed remotes I'm not pushing to the right branch.\ntries again. /me whistles\nI'll turn caching back on and resolve to the fact that it's npm ls that isn't working (likely with our lerna setup).. cache back guarantee. Thank you!. Went ahead and shipped patch releases since it's a nice thing to add on.. For the sake of code coverage, I could bring in tests directly from the package I yoinked from: https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-js/blob/master/test/infer.js\n\ud83d\ude08 . Added another commit on to demonstrate using this with the notebook preview. Working pretty well:\n\n. Thank you!. > Now the only thing that flickers is the code mirror wrapping which cannot be fixed with simple CSS.\nSweet. Yeah that's since we (or CodeMirror) relies on CodeMirror-lines. If this wasn't a <textarea> it would be easy to split them (and it has to be a textarea for instantiating after).. Added some comments to hopefully make what should otherwise be a really simple component very clear.. Trim down finished, and followed on with https://github.com/nteract/enchannel-zmq-backend/issues/55.. Thanks for coming back to this and incorporating feedback. \ud83d\ude04 . I do believe this is thoroughly closed.. In reality, plotly is the dominant part of our bundle (and doesn't get tree-shaken since we're using the dist version). It's good to have this trimmed down though.. Found a potential \"offendor\" keeping our bundle from being small:\n./node_modules/stream-to-observable/rxjs-all.js:var Observable = require('rxjs/Rx').Observable;. It looks like it should detect using any-observable so that's probably not a problem. \ud83e\udd14 . Ok, that's a red herring.\n$ npm ls stream-to-observable\nnteract@0.1.0 /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract\n\u2514\u2500\u252c lint-staged@4.0.1\n  \u2514\u2500\u252c listr@0.12.0\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 stream-to-observable@0.1.0\nLooks like we are where we need to be. \ud83d\ude04 . Thanks for the contribution, I think this is great. I don't have a chance to test, certainly in favor of CSS based changes for printing. :smile:. @jkornblum I added you as a reviewer since you've worked with these quite a bit. \ud83d\ude04 . Thanks and welcome to the project! Great to have your help.. Yeah I think the screen shouldn't refocus when running a pinned cell. It should stay fixed.. Haven't worked on any linting tools, would be nice to have.. /cc @BenRussert -- also worth consideration for Hydrogen. I like what @theengineear did in https://github.com/nteract/commuter/pull/210 and think we should do the same here. Closing, in hopes we'll follow suit with the commuter implementation (except using the bundled Plotly instead of the CDN).. Closing in favor of nteract/commuter#210 to be brought into here.. As for the quick previewer, see #305. I'm certainly a fan of us having a quicklook plugin. I don't have the stomach for an XCode project at the moment though \ud83d\ude05.. The way I'm currently doing this:\nIn the original package:\n```\ngit checkout -b move-to-monorepo\nmkdir -p packages/NAME\ngit mv !(packages) packages/NAME/\ngit mv .SOMEFILE packages/NAME # Catch the dotfiles\nDouble check things first\ngit commit -am \"preparing NAME for move to monorepo\"\n```\nIn the monorepo (on branch \"another-merger\")\n```\ngit remote add tmpNAME /Path/To/NAME\ngit fetch tmpNAME\ngit merge tmpNAME/move-to-monorepo --allow-unrelated-histories\nMake commit message be:\nchore: merge X into monorepo\n``. It should be easy to import the other 3 now, not a big deal at the moment though.. Finally bot, I agree with you. We likelywontfixthese. \ud83d\ude04 . Closing as dupe of #263, totally agree we need this. :smile:. I'm going to ship after this because I noticed that it was only showingtext/plainon notebooks on commuter.. Oh look a%%dot` magic:\n\n\ud83d\ude08 \n. > This one's cooler http://js.cytoscape.org/ ;-)\ncytoscape is cool! Is the cytoscape JSON format pretty well standardized? That's the main requirement for a supported transform (mimetype & spec).. My chief concern on this one is if it increases the overall app size considerably (since it's effectively graphviz run through emscripten).. Closing this for now, if someone wants it I'd love to measure the bundle size to make sure this is appropriate later.. I've unlocked this since @mpacer wants to open this up for discussion. I'm a fan of having a graphviz transform. Now that nteract is about to support dynamically import()ing transforms I'd be fine having this one loading that way since it's pretty mega.. As long as we agree on a mimetype and what the raw format is, I'm happy. \ud83d\ude04 \nIn your demo you used application/vnd.graphviz and in this PR I used text/vnd.graphviz. Doing a bit of digging again, it appears text/vnd.graphviz is the officially registered media type. I'd ask to switch them out, it looks like @PhE's repo has been going for about a year though so I only want to slightly nudge that it should align with the registered media type.. I'm cool with using a node module that we can require. We keep a separate module for the ipython mode and could easily move that one to a separate module too.. Amusingly, we just adopted monaco for the file editor on the nteract jupyter extension. It's still codemirror in the notebook app though.. Yup, I don't want to breakaway from CodeMirror within the notebook yet as I understand it deeply and I'd have to do a lot of :new: hand tuning to get Monaco to work well in our notebooks (mostly because of what's enabled by default and the sheer number of web workers that would be on the page per cell...). \ud83d\ude22  Yeah I've been meaning to dig back into this one. For now I've resorted to help(obj). I'll prioritize this for the next release.. Fixed in https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/1965, we'll get this shipped out within the next day or so.. I wonder if this is related to the change on codepoint handling for codemirror.. On my mac it's ctrl+... However, I can't seem to close the little popup for it. \ud83d\ude32 . > It would be nice if it were Shift-Tab as in jupyterlab to better make use of muscle memory.\nYeah I think it's about time we bring in the Tab and Shift-Tab bindings.. > This branch cannot be rebased due to conflicts\n\nRebasing the commits of this branch on top of the base branch cannot be performed automatically due to conflicts encountered while reapplying the individual commits from the head branch.\n\nHere I thought I was doing this properly.

Uh. I don't think I should try this with the vote of confidence coming from the originator of git.\n\ud83d\ude28. > Um. Uh. I don't think I should try this with the vote of confidence coming from the originator of git.\nTried this, git-*-cache (and git checkout-cache etc.) are not commands on my system.. Heh, I tried using an orphaned branch. That was a terrible idea.\n\n. This is everything from spawnteract and enchannel-zmq-backend.. Closing in favor of #1807.. This does still require the initial setup that was done in #1806 (for the originating repo).. Since this one seems fairly reasonable, I think I'll do this for all the packages we want merged into one.. Yeah I can take those out. I was aiming for purity first, ensuring I gave out credit to the contributors then I figured I'd clean it up for our monorepo. I may not clean up all the tests in this first go round, just making sure it all passes for now. Modernization :soon:. Closing in favor of #1810 and follow on PRs.. noooooope. Totes not mergable without a rebase.. used: \nNAME=enchannel-zmq-backend git subtree add --prefix=packages-${NAME} git@github.com:nteract/${NAME}.git master. Would have been sweet, there were many conflicts for merging though.. > Rebasing the commits of this branch on top of the base branch cannot be performed automatically due to conflicts encountered while reapplying the individual commits from the head branch.\nMostly files in the base, like the README.md, index.js, etc.\nIt wants me to rectify the changes between 2016 READMEs amongst both projects.\nI can do a squash merge from the GitHub UI here though. \n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Going with one of #1810 or #1807, closing this.. This actually works, :cool:.. This is insanity mode. Sorry to keep giving you all notifications. It's for your credit. \ud83d\ude04 . DONE. Ok, I can confidently say that now we have a monorepo. All the very core components are together here now.. There is so much administrative work we need done across the nteract org with these though:\n\nUpdating the git URLs for each of the packages\nUpdating the original repos to point to the new locations\n...more\nPublishing. This is now the PR I favor, I'll do enough cleanup to get tests to pass.. ```\neslint .\nOops! Something went wrong! :(\nESLint couldn't find the plugin \"eslint-plugin-babel\". This can happen for a couple different reasons:\n\n\nIf ESLint is installed globally, then make sure eslint-plugin-babel is also installed globally. A globally-installed ESLint cannot find a locally-installed plugin.\nIf ESLint is installed locally, then it's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:\n    npm i eslint-plugin-babel@latest --save-dev\nIf you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://gitter.im/eslint/eslint to chat with the team.\n\n```\nOdd, I'm facing this locally too even though it's installed.. * Lint \u2705  \n Flow \u2705  \n Tests \u2705  *\n* - I haven't actually updated the tests on these though I could do that.. Currently getting the main app to work again. It boots, but then no cells run and there are no errors in the console.. It's pretty apparent we need to move the electron app to a lerna package now. One of the reasons is that I can't mock the packages properly since they're a relative import.\nUpdate: \ud83e\udd14  Though now that I think about this again hours later I wonder if it just needed to be relative to the mockrequire file modified in 9a49bbc.. In these last few commits, I've begun the process of migrating the top level package to be just for lerna and the desktop app to be a lerna package.\nWebpack build is \u2705 \nLaunch is :x:\nThe step I'm missing is rebuilding the native modules with electron builder. When it's run, it does the following:\n$ $(npm bin)/electron-builder install-app-deps\nelectron-builder 19.17.0\nNo native production dependencies\nSince we're hoisting, the native dep isn't within the desktop package (instead coming from the top):\nnteract/nteract/packages/desktop$ ls node_modules/\n@nteract              enchannel             enchannel-zmq-backend jupyter-paths         kernelspecs           spawnteract\n@lgeiger I could really use your help on this one. \ud83d\ude4f . Ok, I've done another thing which is to turn off hoisting so that the electron packaging setup builds zeromq properly.\nHowever this breaks some of the RxJS code because of the patched prototypes not existing everywhere (these need to be imported in each of the packages).. Now that I've done #1833 separately and I know what we ran into with this PR (specifically about the zeromq tests), I'll do some more PRs that only bring in some of these.. Ok I can rule out any that are used in the main module.. Closing in favor of #1839 and #1837. Still need to follow on for spawnteract, jupyter-paths, kernelspecs. Those require some investigation though since they're used by the main process in the electron app.. Alright, this finishes off the must-haves I declared above. I wouldn't say this is a useful extension yet by any means. It just paves a little setup for us to hack on and start distributing.. I'm hoping I \"fixed\" the flow errors and everything is situated pretty well now.. What the fresh hell?\n```\nLogs will go to /tmp/flow/zShomezStraviszSbuildzSnteractzSnteract.log\nsrc/notebook/reducers/document.js:62\n 62:   // $FlowFixMe: Not sure what the issue is for why it doesn't think the List is not the same as a List\n       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Error suppressing comment.

Just an update -- there is now a web version of nteract that runs on top of the jupyter server. You can try it out on binder!\nThe jupyter extension is called nteract_on_jupyter on PyPI and there are install instructions here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/applications/jupyter-extension. The kernel info response usually contains this (from the kernel), so we'd be able to handle converting to a script directly.. We now store the kernel info with the kernel object and could start using that with a new menu entry.. Missing feature, thanks for adding it to the tracker.. Since there are multiple issues for this same feature request, I'm going to consolidate them in to this one.. Pinning this issue as it should never go stale. We definitely need to implement this one. As our data structures have gotten more normalized, I'm feeling better about going after this.. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Thanks for reporting.\nAre you willing to run from master to see if this is any better?. This is still an issue, I just tried it with the latest release..

Oh nowwww you show up @codecov-io. Come on AppVeyor, these PRs are readddddyyyyyy.. I'm just going to merge this one now so it helps the other builds I'll be making today. \ud83d\ude04 . I can work on the files handler and the webpack setup for that. I can't recall why we made github separated at the top of the webpack commonjs ignores..

We'll put in place some automating mechanisms and see what we can do.. I think I'll defer this one to the autosaving issue #814. I'll put autosaving on the next milestone.. This is a super smart idea. Wowsers. Too bad we can't comment inside package.json to make it clear why.

I've been doing a bit of thinking on this, talking to @ewmassey and @adparker.\nI'll describe this on a components level (per project / concept), then we can tie it all together.\nCommuter API Endpoint\nPublishing a new notebook (or an old one for that matter) as a new published entity:\nPOST /api/v1/published/\n{notebook content, could be similar to the contents API}\nResponse:\n{\n  id: \"the-id-of-the-published-document\",\n  version: \"1\", # This could be a hash of the notebook too\n  url: \"\", # Path to the notebook, for linking out to\n}\nPublishing a new version of a notebook\nPUT /api/v1/published/123\n{notebook content}\nResponse is similar to the POST\nNotebook metadata\nA published notebook updates metadata under .metadata.papermill.publish\njs\n{\n  cells: [...],\n  metadata: {\n    papermill: {\n      publication: {\n        id: \"1234\",\n        endpoint: \"https://mycommuter\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nThis captures the endpoint so that publishing again will update the published copy, allowing an author to iterate and publish again.\nClients - nteract, papermill\nnteract will include a button to publish, including a way to set up credentials\npapermill will have a publish command like so:\npapermill publish myNotebook.ipynb\nThey both modify the notebook in place to include the above mentioned metadata.\nVersioning\nIn terms of UI on commuter, I want people to be able to:\n\nLink to a published notebook\nLink to a specific version of a published notebook (by hash or version number)\nPublish from the commuter browsing interface straight to published\n\nOpinions on getting started with storage and indexing\nIn terms of storage and indexing, I'd imagine we could start off by storing the notebook blobs in S3, relying on Object versioning\n\n. For ease of use, I'd assume that we'd create a dotfile for papermill / commuter that would have their default endpoint and any other information. Auth details should get stored in keychains properly. The key goal here is to make it easy on users for the long term. \ud83d\ude04 . I'd certainly be a fan, so long as we can swap out backends. I don't really want to deal with nonlinear histories of these notebooks (otherwise they should be using git directly), which is why I want to have a single linked list.\nHow do you want to handle git as the backend for this? We do support publishing to gists now, we don't store any other metadata to an external service though.\nSide note -- I just noticed this great little article on libgit2 backends.. @MSeal and @cHYzZQo we should set aside some time to evaluate how we'd do versioning and publishing of notebooks, especially as we progress further with scheduling of notebooks.. @lgeiger did you already finish off parts of this?. Oh ok, I'll close this for now. We do need to revisit kernel cleanup as it isn't done quite properly yet.. Works well though. :smile: I was able to work with @captainsafia's https://github.com/captainsafia/jupytercon-tutorial/blob/master/1-javascript-primer/1-javascript-primer.ipynb in like zero time. Zero-to-hero is pretty strong here. :smile:. In particular, this super cool feature was the nteract shell commands.. Ah ok, I was just clueless where to find it on linux.. :tada: Thank you!. This uses node/v8 under the hood, so the behavior matches exactly that of node itself (you can see this with the chrome devtools for instance). The workarounds I've been using are to use var, like you suggest, on cells I know I'm going to tinker with/reassign and/or restarting the entire kernel (Language -> Restart Kernel). Under the hood we're using ijavascript, though I don't think it's necessarily behavior we can change.\nBit of a counterpoint -- when teaching let and const, I'd prefer they match the behavior in all the runtimes available. The only place I'd end up running over them more than once is if they're in a function.. Seems like something we should do. It can either be done in the bound event in src/notebook/menu.js or throttled in the saving epic. I think I'd prefer it being at the bound event.. Oh hmmmm, on the mac we set the title. Not sure what's available for Linux here.. Branch is worth trying out at least!. Figured it out, object-to-react is mutative.. I've updated the spec here to be:\njs\n{\n  tagName: string, // Must be an HTML tag\n  attributes: Object, // attributes must be valid for setting on the element,\n  children: Array<VDOMEl>,\n}\nThis is to me a little more agnostic of React (the implementation here) and match more closely the language within the DOM.. Interesting, thanks for reporting this.. When it comes down to it, this looks like an issue where we don't swap to a different kernel type if we don't recognize what's in the notebook metadata.. :cool:, let's go with it.. Not currently. Are you hoping for just a static view export?. Hard-coded shortcuts are likely new-contributor-friendly for implementation, so long as they're key combos (not a command mode). I may (personally) be a bit picky about what combos they are, we do have flexibility though since we control the whole app / window.. I think I like those keys! I also think we already have ctrl-shift-c / x / v (cmd-shift-c on mac) available for copy/cut/paste for cells, but the cell has to be focused. That could be refined.\nWould \"add cell\" default to code or to what your last cell type was?\nSince movement between cells can be done with only up/down alone, I'd be tempted to use ctrl-shift-up to create cells (or does that make more sense as \"go to the top cell\")?. Awesome, thank you SOOOOOOO MUCH @lgeiger!. Thanks! \u2728 . I'd be fine with prettier greenkeeper.. Fantastic, that's great to hear you'd like to use it with your high school students! @willingc and @captainsafia will be happy to hear about this. \ud83d\ude04 \nAs for the Jupyter directories, nteract adheres to the Jupyter file paths (or at least purports to). You can set environment variables to override JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR for Jupyter and IPYTHONDIR for IPython. The second one is created by IPython, not by nteract. There is a difference when running nteract vs. the notebook in a conda environment, since it will use the sys prefix within the conda env.\nOverriding IPYTHONDIR\nThe kernel for the conda environment can set keys in env, including where you want the IPYTHONDIR to be. Example:\njs\n{\n \"argv\": [\n  \"C:\\/python\\/python\",\n  \"-m\",\n  \"ipykernel_launcher\",\n  \"-f\",\n  \"{connection_file}\"\n ],\n \"env\": {\n  \"IPYTHONDIR\": \"C:\\/temp\"\n },\n \"display_name\": \"Python 3\",\n \"language\": \"python\"\n}\nAdmittedly I don't know where you'd pick the temp dir or how the paths would look inside the JSON without my Windows machine with me.\nOverriding JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR\nThe only option I can think of here is to either:\n\nmodify the global environment variable (this seems rough considering the restrictions on the school systems)\ncreate a shortcut to the app that sets the environment variable (at least I think this was available)\n\nFuture\nI'm open to ideas for how we could make this easier.\n. > don't know which json file it is.\nIt should be in a file labeled kernel.json, likely inside a kernels/python/ folder.. It's probably possible.. The files we write out, which don't have to be in standard jupyter folders, though it's really nice if they are:\n\nnteract.json - configuration file for theme (in ~/.jupyter on *nix)\nkernel-UUID.json - the connection file (goes in ~/Library/Jupyter/runtime on the mac). This one is fixed (I think).. Closed by #2350.. I commented inline, though you'll probably have to read them in the order I posted them rather than right at the file with the github comments.\n\nI used the metadata from https://github.com/nteract/papermill/pull/32 to prototype this.. One terrible thing with my prototype above is that I faked the notebook. I wasn't actually running papermill, I crafted the metadata that would say which cell was running and uploaded it to a gist. This notebook, if run through papermill would look like:\n```\n OUTPUT\n\n--- Executing with Papermill ---\n[*]: CODE RUNNING\n     OUTPUT\n[ ]: CODE WE RUN LATER\n     OUTPUT\n```\npapermill writes to disk (or straight to S3) after each cell finishes, which is why we wanted this intermediate state. \ud83d\ude09 . I felt like \"pending\" and \"completed\" were duplicative information, considering null entries for execution count are \"pending\" and numbered execution counts are \"completed\". These fields are only supposed to exist at runtime IIRC @ewmassey.. Let me fix the prototype notebook since I chose metadata setting arbitrarily.. Alright, I changed the graphic which is more representative. It's not perfect, it's certainly workable though. This does tell me I should make the * appear when papermill.status === \"running\". Oh! One thing that may not be clear here @mpacer! The component being modified here is only the notebook preview -- it doesn't affect the desktop app whatsoever -- this is for use in commuter and other web apps that use this component for rendering a notebook from some storage location.. The <inputs> component has a boolean flag that I updated to use the papermill status here\njs\n             <Inputs\n                executionCount={this.props.cell.get(\"execution_count\")}\n                running={running}\n              />\nInside of that component, it puts a nice little star (or could be modified for any UI really).. > My only remaining question is why the \"Executing with Papermill\u2026\" is necessary once you have the ability to reinsert the * to the execution count without relying on its existence in the notebook file.\nThe users I work with have hundreds of notebooks each, any of which can be currently running. This gives it a slight more amount of lineage about where it's running (or who/what is running it).. Looks like introducing flow here highlighted an issue (possibly):\n```\nError: src/notebook/epics/config.js:69\n 69:         JSON.stringify(store.getState().config.toJS())\n             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ unused function argument\n   62:   static bindNodeCallback(callbackFunc: (v1: T, callback: (err: any, result: U) => any) => any, selector?: void, scheduler?: rxjs$SchedulerClass): (v1: T) => rxjs$Observable;\n                                                                                                                                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ function type expects no more than 1 argument.

This is now coming along swimmingly. I think I know how we'll carve more of these out, which means I could probably group this work for others to tackle if they'd like.. This now does the full round trip with the contents API, putting data back into the store. I've been running on a subpath to make sure that we handle JupyterHub deployments successfully. Hooking up all the other APIs is fairly trivial here sincerx-jupyteralready has all of these implemented. Most of the work is creating the epics and figuring out how our state tree will look.. I've got a critical decision about how we do routing next -- do I adopt the same router from next's router since we usenext/linkin commuter?. Looks like there is some flow to address inrx-jupyter`. I'll fix that over there.. What do you think of the epic structure here @jayphelps?. > If you mean like directory/file structure, looks good to me \ud83d\udc4d\nI meant the structure of the epic, and you found issues in there that I hoped you'd uncover. \ud83d\ude47 . Yet another thing I've cheated on by having it loaded from the base desktop app!. We ran into rebuild problems with the desktop app when I moved it into a lerna package, which is why it's at the top level still. :(\nI'll get those deps in.. This is our current markdown cell:\nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/aaf987d14412367048e7ba960279c9375a3bed2a/src/notebook/components/cell/markdown-cell.js\nand the basic function for text --> Markdown is set up here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/aaf987d14412367048e7ba960279c9375a3bed2a/src/notebook/components/cell/markdown-cell.js#L33-L37\nYou'll have to put markdown-it into packages/desktop/package.json and install it, followed by configuring markdown it instead of the commonmark-react-renderer that's used currently.\nIf you get stuck, feel free to post again and ask questions. I'll be out quite a bit this week, so hopefully if it's not me then someone else will be able to chime in. \ud83d\ude04 . As much as possible, we want markdown to be sanitized. Since the notebook can run arbitrary node code with a simple require, we don't want the markdown rendering to be able to control the user's computer (think word macro viruses). As much as possible, we need to lock things down.\nIt might be the case that we need to go from an abstract syntax tree (if using commonmark) or markdown-it's tokens to React elements.\nIn fact, looking at markdown-it's debug output, they even have tag and children.\nAs an aside (read: slight diversion), I decided to look at how the html renderer is implemented for commonmark.js and noticed that it would be pretty interesting to create a React renderer based directly on this -- https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark.js/blob/master/lib/render/html.js\n. I'm a little saddened, I thought there was a react renderer for markdown-it that was up to date and used the tokens well rather than using dangerouslySetInnerHTML.. Heh, I just noticed that's exactly what https://github.com/rexxars/commonmark-react-renderer/blob/master/src/commonmark-react-renderer.js does, so we're pretty well situated there. We just can't handle extensions on the commonmark spec with it.. > BTW, I think this topic is not new-contributer-friendly any more.\nYeah, I agree. Thanks for giving it a go and scoping out options. I misinterpreted the level on this one. I'll swap the labels on it. There will be other issues to tackle here. \ud83d\ude04 . Closing in favor of #2350, tables + more coming soon!. I'll assume you opened this on accident. \ud83d\ude04 . How old exactly? I thought we did v3 -> v4 conversion. Anything earlier no one has attempted as far as I know. We should definitely give better error messages on v3.. Do you have an example notebook @juandesant?. There is some work in progress in #1860. It's definitely a bit annoying right now, as you always have to dismiss it. I put the current version in as a safeguard until we have the proper UX.. We're good on this one.. Oh wait, no we're not.. I think it's ok to hoist still. The annoying thing is after you do this, you'll probably have to git clean -xfd.. > Do we really need to run flow-copy-source in the prepare script during bootstrap? We only need them when publishing the packages, right?\nThey also provide flow types during development, so while not frequent if they're out of sync you'll get weird flow errors.. Alright, I'll give it a go!. I love seeing all these references to the packages by name rather than relative path.. I see now rxjs and uuid are hoisted. What made it so you had to hoist uuid?. Took 133s to install from scratch (I did the git clean -xfd first).. ## Bugs encountered\n\nnone of the examples load. It looks like they're one path too far.\n\n\nExtra things I tested:\n\nBuilt in node.js kernel is working like a champ\nVarious renderers (vega, plotly) are all working\n. One extra thing -- running the command line tools install created packages/desktop/bin/nteract-env. Maybe that's normal behavior? Maybe it's just something to gitignore?. Fixed the one issue I saw, now to see how changing other packages goes.. Working like a champ, webpack is correctly building from our src folder in respective packages.\n\nThe only weird thing is that lerna masks the current status of webpack:\n```\n$ npm run start\n\nnteract@0.2.0 start /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract-maint\nlerna run start --scope @nteract/desktop\n\nlerna info version 2.1.2\nlerna info versioning independent\nlerna info scope @nteract/desktop\n\u2e28\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2e29 \u2839 run: info scope @nteract/desktop\n```. This is AWESOME. Thank you @lgeiger!\n\ud83c\udf89 . The only other script I'm seeing as needing to move is scripts/make_icons.sh. Then again I haven't used that script in a while.. Guess I should test by making a fake release too.. ```\n~/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract-maint/packages/desktop$ npm run dist\n\n@nteract/desktop@0.2.0 dist /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract-maint/packages/desktop\nnpm run clean && npm run build:webpack && electron-builder\n\nnpm ERR! missing script: clean\nnpm ERR!

I can fix the other two issues you mentioned.\nCool! Yeah I haven't figured out the dist issue, even after doing the pieces here.. I'm going to have to play with the uuid one there, it's weird that it matters that it has to be hoisted. I wonder if it's because we don't add it into the webpack build.. Hey! Travis is passing. Should I give this another spin?. There's some \"prettier churn\". I'll go ahead and upgrade and do a npm run prettier. Expect at least one commit. \ud83d\ude1c . Oooooh the latest lerna has beautiful outputs. Examples are working well!\nRunning the dist is currently in progress \ud83e\udd1e . The dist is very successful. I'd say we're fit to merge this after CI passes!. \n. We won't have these fixed in time for your current homework submissions. We'll keep at it to make this better though. \ud83d\ude04 . D'oh! Of course. I think it's the same?. It happens in the markdown cell (as well as in Markdown outputs) here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/src/notebook/components/cell/markdown-cell.js#L170\nThe css is separate, part of main.css -- https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/static/styles/main.css. > if you align the * with the text above (I.e., one more space before each of them) how well does that work\nSounds like a good idea to me!. You're on a tear today!. \u2764\ufe0f . Oh yeah, our old mock setup used mock-require and was doing it with relative paths.. I'm not sure what's up with codecov saying CI failed. Does it seem like a fluke and that we can just merge this in?. Oh interesting, oops.\nWithin the desktop app's tests: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/packages/desktop/test/setup.js#L82-L87. Yeah, this is definitely the right behavior now. Especially since we do similar handling in the notebook process.. Hurrah, flow is passing! I'm adding something else on now to make install work again since I rebased against master and webpack was missing as a dependency here.. Hmmmm, seems the rx hoisting is now breaking things instead for this app. \ud83e\udd14 . > rx_jupyter_lib.contents.get(...).do is not a function\nI am sad.. Wow looking over this after we've done all the pipelining, I kind of want to just grab the pieces I want  here and make a new PR instead of fixing this up.. \ud83c\udf1f Now updated to match the lettable style \ud83c\udf1f . :tada: Thanks @kayur!. I'm beginning to regret my decision to rebase merge rather than do a merge commit. You'll have to rebase this against master now since I merged the other.. We can hyper optimize later by only storing a hash of the notebook object. Since our Immutable.js structure is impure (the mutable data objects within display_data), I'm not sure if the iterable.hashCode() will be valid.. Sure enough, can't use hashCode for fast comparisons because of the mutable leaf nodes:\n```js\n\nm = Immutable.Map({'a': {'b': 2}}) // the top level is immutable here\nMap { \"a\": [object Object] }\nm.get('a') // The inner object is mutable\n{ b: 2 }\nm.get('a')['b']\n2\nm.hashCode()\n-356504055\nm.get('a')['b'] = 3\n3\nm.hashCode()\n-356504055\n```\n\nMaybe it's not a big deal since display updates actively change that entire data payload.. > I don't know if there is a canonical for these kind of tasks in redux.\nNon-redux, had we stuck with full immutable\nIf the full structure was Immutable.js, then you'd only store the notebook.hashCode() for the saved notebook and compare it to the notebook.hashCode() for the current notebook. I'm only noting this to show what the benefit of truly immutable data structures are (when deeply immutable).\nRedux way (proposal)\nI think the way to do this is to register certain kinds of changes as dirty for the notebook. Then, everytime someone has a successful save we set dirty = false (in the state tree).. > only seems to work with ipykernel~=4.6.x, at least in some of my envs where the version is 4.3.x executing a cell never completes. Just seems to hang and I can't find an error message anywhere.\n~~That might be related to the whole ipykernel_launcher switchover.~~ yes yes indeed. > Maybe the real way to do this is to add a kernel spec like this if we detect that we are in either a virtualenv or a conda env and do \"the right thing\" for either to work.\nSounds about right.. For a random user with a standalone install on a mac who is using anaconda, their flow might end up looking like this:\n\nInstall desktop app\nLaunch by double-clicking a notebook (yes outside your use case)\nThis kernelspec will (possibly) be their system python (ew)\n\"It's named nteract, is this the right one?\"\nBe confused\nLearn about the \"right way\"\nComplain that this didn't make things simpler\n\nI'm not actually sure so I think this could be destructive at the moment. I think there's a decent way to do this that is going to involve checking some environment variables as well as seeing which version of ipython is installed (I did some of this in a branch I closed a while ago). However... I think there's a way to do this for today in a way that makes the nteract shell script work ok in a way that the naming (hopefully) makes sense:\nSpecial case CLI launches\nWhen the nteract app is started from the CLI, set a special environment variable that says NTERACT_SOURCE_FROM_ENV_AT_CLI=1 (I'm being a little verbose). Then, make this kernel's display name be \"python (current env)\". It can also be a little more aware of whether it's in a virtual environment or a conda environment, showing a bit more information.\nGenerally that would make me a little more comfortable for one of these semi-generated kernelspecs.. > So I'd propose to only add this kernel spec if we detect/are convinced we are being started \"inside\" a conda environment.\n\ud83d\udc4d \n\nWouldn't checking for CONDA_PREFIX in the environment take care of the NTERACT_SOURCE_FROM_ENV_AT_CLI=1?\nShould also work out what virtualenv does which is the other popular way of having virtual environments.\n\nCombine these two questions/statements and this is why I'm suggesting you set a var to communicate the intent of launching from the CLI. You can make the \"Python (current env)\" spec use whatever Python is on the path here.. > If we can track down when/where PATH gets modified maybe we can prevent it from removing (or re-add) the path for the current conda environment.\nRight here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/d813188524733b825b3150b7be833912246c3d22/packages/desktop/src/main/prepare-env.js. I'm going to add some notes to that file to state why we're doing certain things before they're lost to time. \ud83d\ude1b . Damn it, I just committed straight to master in the GitHub UI instead of making a PR like I meant to for the the comments on the env prep. See the updated version here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/d84fcc3d2ac3b16987ba3b6548fdeda76feda91d/packages/desktop/src/main/prepare-env.js. Thanks for tackling this and going back+forth on it Tim to find the simplest way to solve this.. Did you mean to respond in https://github.com/nteract/vdom/pull/44 @mpacer?. Closing for now, let's revisit this next week during the nteract winter sprint if we make time.. Maybe I'm missing something else here... this seems fine now.\n\n. whooooop, no wonder. What a silly mistake. Thanks for the note!. I'm going to come back to this one since I went ahead with React upgrades.. Verified that the app runs well. Now to fix up all the test harness gunk.. Currently trying to figure out what all needs to be configured for enzyme: http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/installation/index.html. npm ERR! code E404\nnpm ERR! 404 Not Found: enzyme-react-adapter-16@^1.0.0\nnpm ERR!

Just the enzyme bits I need to fix (Rx notwithstanding, for a separate reason...)\nlerna ERR! execute   8) toolbar provider toggle Sticky Cell works:\nlerna ERR! execute      Error:\nlerna ERR! execute         Attempted to access ReactWrapper::node, which was previously a private property on\nlerna ERR!

Hurrah, it passes!. I think we could probably step away from sinon and our mock-require setup in favor of jest, we're mostly living in a hybrid because of the original mocha based tests for the desktop app.. Lukas is totally finishing this right now because he's the hero of the Sunday before the nteract winter sprints.. This is so awesome! I've been looking forward to this since day one!. Let's do this!. The only thing I want to answer now is if we should ship a release or not. I was hoping to finish off the package upgrades first, make sure things were in a good spot, and potentially fix a few things. Could be fine to ship now though. Anything glaring?. We're now on the Immutable RC for 4.x and while it's not perfect it's pretty good. Immutable.Records are \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 \ud83d\udc8b. I'm not sure if you still see this. If you do, then look at the logs in ~/Library/Logs/nteract/log.log on your mac.. That is super neat! I'd probably want the nteract frontend locked down a bit more, largely to assume that the kernel is potentially untrusted, since nteract can run anything on a local user's machine. One way of doing that would be to only allow certain media types. Another would be to actively iframe outputs and sanitize markdown completely. Someday I think all of the frontends should end up like that.\nBeyond my gut reaction from a security standpoint -- from a UX standpoint this would be super exciting! Launching straight from the app would be a great way to get people started using it without having all the local kernels and dependencies they might need, all while working with a document they can save and version control on their own system.. > The browser based notebook does horizontal scrolling per cell.\nSounds like we should too. Seems we're missing an overflow.. With the last Rx upgrade, I'm going to make sure things are working well with the jupyter serverextension and then do that major bump.. \nWe're going to need the pipe operator available on rx-jupyter. \ud83e\udd14 I wonder if I should just bring rx-jupyter into the monorepo too so that Rx is versioned in tandem here.... Ok, now that the nbextension/serverextension is fixed up, time to tackle notebook preview.. ```\nChanges:\n - ansi-to-react: 1.6.1 => 2.0.0\n - @nteract/commutable: 2.1.1 => 2.1.2\n - nteract: 0.2.0 => 0.2.1\n - @nteract/display-area: 2.4.1 => 3.0.0\n - @nteract/editor: 2.3.1 => 3.0.0\n - enchannel-zmq-backend: 4.0.2 => 5.0.0\n - enchannel: 3.1.1 => 4.0.0\n - fs-observable: 1.0.0 => 2.0.0\n - @nteract/messaging: 1.2.0 => 2.0.0\n - @nteract/nbextension: 0.1.1 => 0.2.0\n - @nteract/notebook-preview-demo: 0.7.0 => 1.0.0\n - @nteract/notebook-preview: 2.5.0 => 3.0.0\n - @nteract/transform-dataresource: 1.2.1 => 2.0.0\n - @nteract/transform-geojson: 2.1.0 => 3.0.0\n - @nteract/transform-model-debug: 2.1.1 => 3.0.0\n - @nteract/transform-plotly: 2.2.0 => 3.0.0\n - @nteract/transform-vdom: 1.1.1 => 2.0.0\n - @nteract/transform-vega: 2.2.1 => 3.0.0\n - @nteract/transforms-full: 2.5.1 => 3.0.0\n - @nteract/transforms: 2.4.1 => 3.0.0\n - nteract-on-jupyter: 0.1.1 => 1.0.0\n?

Good idea! Also we shouldn't publish nteract_on_jupyter or the nteract nbextension since those are distributed on PyPI.. Closing since we did get those published and I just published again.. Oh my gosh, thank you for taking this on.. All notebooks I tested, including some rather obscure messaging payloads, are working quite well.. I think this is good to go and I'm more than happy to rely on the RxJS 5.5 beta. We could probably run this through uglify. Luckily the size of the js bundle isn't a big issue considering what users currently deal with -- this still loads faster than the classic jupyter notebook.. \ud83e\udd14  Those are probably from the \"old\" https://github.com/nteract/commutable, we should probably figure out a way to document all our packages in one handy spot.. nteract transforms are similar to the notebook's custom mimetype. They take mimetyped data and turn it into a react element. The nteract transforms library has some helpers for picking which of the transforms to use given a bundle of output data from a notebook file.. Yeah I've been really hoping we could feature them on the main site in a nice way.. I'd also love a version where clicking on the output makes it \"focus\" and allows scrolling within. Otherwise it's a container that doesn't \"hijack\" scroll.. This one is definitely open!. Ok, great this is working locally. I'll rebase #1899 and get that up to par to bring in right after this.. I went crazy and cleaned this up just a little bit ago.. Smart! I didn't even think of that.. Alright, I'll get this shipped then. It will be the first version that the macOS and Windows versions get an auto-update for amusingly. \ud83d\ude09 . Full blown enterprise level <marquee> support coming your way soon!. (build running...). > I'm wondering if it's because it's build on mac instead of on Linux.\nYeah that could be. I would hope webpack doesn't take a selective path while building the JS with an electron target..

Mine takes a bit longer because of scattered kernels I have on my system, and the fact that the app isn't ready until we know of all the kernels that are installed.. Lukas must have a turbo charged mac that isn't bogged down by a bajillion other things. \ud83e\udd23 . 0.4.0 was shipped, closing this. Rockin'. I wonder if we could/should move plotly to vendor. Or wait, we run it as a top level global don't we? I feel like that's what we do for commuter, I'm not sure if that carried over here.... With all these sweet changes you're putting in so quickly along with autoupdate, I'm definitely ready to start shipping regularly.. \n. > I wonder if we should move back to the static splash screen since the video still takes quite a bit to initialize.\nI'm ok with the video for the moment. I think it's the electron app readiness that takes the longest here, not the video.. > Also it would be great to initialize the browser window with the correct background color to get rid of the flickering with dark themes.\nThat would be nice.

Closing since we resolved with pinning.. \ud83e\udd14 I wonder if I should have travis run npm run dist:all as a sanity check.... I don't really want to enable shipping from Travis, this was more of a sanity check.. Closing since I think you fixed this right up @lgeiger . Looks like I'll need to re-kick the appveyor build when I get a chance.. Wow this is a lot! Did you use a codemod or did you refactor by hand?. Bye bye coverage and hello new coverage coming soon!. I should probably just disable codecov for now.... Looks like my trying to turn off codecov being a requirement didn't work too well.. At least for now, we now have a way to toggle parameter cells without needing to add tags manually.. Thanks for tackling this! I know some users have wondered about this for both jupyter + nteract (\"how do I get to tags?\") -- https://github.com/nteract/papermill/issues/20\nI'm really looking forward to having a cell configuration \"area\", which I've been mentally seeing as if you could flip the \"card\" that is the cell over. Great to explore.\nI'll go ahead and comment inline.. I'm going to go ahead and close this PR since I've talked to Casey in person about this one fairly recently. We'd like to wait on tackling this until we refactor the cell context menu's design.. Super awesome, thanks for continuing this.. Just keep on lowering that coverage!. niiiice. FAIL  packages/transforms/__tests__/text-spec.js\n  \u25cf Test suite failed to run\n    TypeError: /home/travis/build/nteract/nteract/packages/transforms/__tests__/text-spec.js: Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined\nInteresting, I started seeing this one locally a little bit ago too.. I'll entrust that these are good to go and get them merged in as is then.. This one will need a rebase though.. My rebase from the github ui did not make this work cleanly apparently. Oops. Let me fix this up.. Rebased it locally, force pushed the fix.. Guh, it shows the wrong author, let me redo that.. Same tests that are failing on master, I'll go ahead and merge this since we're in the middle of a testing overhaul.. Thanks again for fixing this.. We're using a next preset + preset env, so I think we're right on track here.. Bringing this in for now, I really need to figure out what's going on with the test setup. It seems like bb5d387a9372f4b28a5f52fc2e4bb70ccbffa286 should have fixed this.. I'm going to err on the side of going with this so tests pass for contributors. I'm surprised the env config isn't being respected here.. Sorry I made the bundle bigger @lgeiger, I wanted to get things passing for now -- we can fix before the next release. I'd be ok with switching to writing explicit lodash imports if you'd prefer here. I wonder if it's a dependency that's actually \"introducing\" the issue (enzyme, jest, etc.).. Just tried a npm run dist:all, app is looking good! I need to work on some other things, happy to make a release in a few hours though. \ud83d\ude04 . There is a serious amount of refactoring due for the editor files to make it simpler to pass the right option through... Guh.. What's the reason for this? I'm guessing you created this PR on accident using an old greenkeeper branch. Closing for now, let me know what we can help with.. I've found these while doing some crazy generated things, figured I should lock this down better until we have a json schema (https://github.com/nteract/vdom/issues/3).. /cc @dhirschfeld. All set, enjoy the patches!. Alright then! At least that was the quickest way for us to try out those changes for windows. We'll have to make a different dialog for the versioning.. Yeahhhhh, I was really hoping that would work. I figured it wouldn't explicitly break anything.. Lukas has something in progress for everyone :soon:.. Gotta fix those tests. \ud83d\ude09 . All set to go!. I'm going to go ahead and get this out the door so we can ship it along with the fix for help (?).. Nice, I love it.. \ud83c\udf89 Thanks!\nI was tempted recently to take the pinned cells out entirely because there were a bunch of undiagnosed issues I'd run into if demoing with them. I suppose if we fix them up it would all work out but wow is it tempting to \u2702\ufe0f  snip out some code. \ud83d\ude04 . ~I'm going to tackle the first one I listed there, collapsing reducers.~ Done.. I'm started on it in #1974, if you want to work on it today that's cool with me! My next step was going to be setting up the hover region in CSS that would affect if the toolbar is shown and remove our current JS solution. . Sounds good to me! I'm looking forward to it. I'm flying today and need to do some writing anyways so I'm happy for you to take it over. Feel free to open the PR early and seek feedback or ask questions as soon as you're ready.. Oh hey we finished all this.. Almost did CHANGE_OUTPUT_VISIBILITY and CHANGE_INPUT_VISIBILITY until I realized they'd have to be a TOGGLE_IN_CELL action.. Addressed the (lack of) use of constants, all set now (other than Travis).. Wow, this is going to increase coverage by removing untested code? That's fantastic!. @aaronraff -- I just pushed one more commit I had sitting locally since I was partway. Feel free to ignore / update this with how you're expecting it to work. \ud83d\ude04  I'll happily close this PR in favor of yours.. Closing, fixed in #1975 . ~Tried this out locally, it also fixes an outstanding bug where the dropdown menu would go transparent and the user wouldn't be able to click some items in the dropdown.~ \ud83d\ude47 \nEdit: Actually, the bug is still there, it's just a bit lessened.. This is fantastic, I can't wait for this to go in the next release!. Welcome to the nteract party! \ud83c\udf89 . Great, we have much ahead. If you want a next issue to tackle, the dropdown menu could use a fix:\n\nIt's a little better than before, where it was completely unclickable because of the cells underneath hijacking it via that mouse handler. Now at least I think there's just a bit more CSS to get it right.. In fact, here's the editor component used for cocalc's jupyter implementation. Keep in mind it's AGPL with the caveat that @williamstein tends to be open to relicensing portions of code for reuse.. That's fine I'll install glib. . /cc @klebba . Nice! Complete with the commits.. Appveyor is definitely just having a fluke there, I'll go ahead and merge this as it shouldn't block this PR.. I approve, in case that wasn't clear. \ud83d\ude04 . Rockin'. Behavior wise this looks great! We do have a focused prop for the editor and cell, nothing about tracking output focus state. I'm looking at this from my phone so I can't tell if any of that logic is useful to incorporate from here.\nWhen I get a free chance I would love to take this for a spin.\nCouple questions I have for the future:\n\nCould we make outputs scroll to the bottom automatically as new outputs come in, provided that the user isn't actively scrolling on it?\nWould it look good if we showed something visual for when the outputs are focused or unfocused (yet larger than the minimum)?. Ok, cool. By the way, it would be great if your GIF had some more cells to drive home the scrolling a bit more. It's usually a notebook somewhere in the middle of the document with large outputs that \"hijacks the scrolling\".. You'll need to rebase if you go after this again, though you'll probably want to start again from the current components. Closing for now, feel free to re-open or start a new PR. Thanks @aaronraff!. Closing, I'm going to touch this again after finishing more of @nteract/core.. Looks like this one is not fixed in #2350, we'll probably need another remark plugin. After we finish #2350 we can investigate this one.. @aaronraff want to check this one out?. You're not pushing your luck on number 5. It mostly depends on what kind of \"equality\" you want. You can do direct equality between two notebooks made with commutable using Immutable's isEqual:\n\nnotebook.isEqual(otherNotebook)\nor\nImmutable.is(notebook, otherNotebook)\nThis is a fast O(1) computation because it's checking the hashCode between the two objects. It has some caveats to it though:\n\nThe notebook itself needs to be a fully immutable object for this to be accurate\nThis is useful for in-memory comparisons (has the notebook changed), not for comparing two notebooks on disk\n\nGenerally speaking, commutable is a utility wrapper around immutable setting up an opinionated data structure. What we probably need to do is link out to Immutable docs more. With that, I'll answer a few of the others:\nfunction getCellById(notebook, id) {\n  return notebook.getIn(['cellMap', id])\n}\nfunction getCellByIndex(notebook, index) {\n  const id = notebook.getIn(['cellOrder', index]);\n  return notebook.getIn(['cellMap', id])\n}\nThose would probably be fine to add to commutable itself. They're definitely useful for testing, though I imagine I probably wouldn't use them in applications built on top of commutable because I tend to use updateIn for performance when I have multiple operations on the document.\n\nI'm sure commutable isn't meant to be tied to nteract.\n\nThat's true. Originally it got built well before the desktop app, it was the start of opinions for what the in-memory data structure would be. I've been thinking on how I would use just the cells from commutable for things like https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/1986 or even dashboard / grid layouts.. I think, now that records have gotten a lot better, we should switch to using Records for the core notebook format like in #2742 . Would this be within the document window or in the native toolbar?. How's this now?. What's this look like now?. Oh I see, yeah that's perfect.. > store is stored in a global variable (gasp). This should be moved to a closure.\nThat's definitely ok for now, we can leave it for a refactor. We may want to leave a TODO: or HACK: comment for now.. Thanks for tackling this one, it's definitely a yucky one!. Awesome, thanks!. This is finished up. . All good, we'll look forward to another PR.. Let me know if there's anything I can help with.. ~I completely broke all the tests as I suspected on this as I took out all the action specific functions that took observables and created operators.~ All set.. I'm now wishing that we had a few namespaces for this stuff:\n```\n// all our operators for working on streams of jupyter messages\nimport { outputs } from '@nteract/messaging/operators'\n// Basically all the createXMessage functions, except as clean composable names\nimport { displayData } from '@nteract/messaging/messages'\nof(\n  executeInput({ execution_count: 1 }),\n  executeReply(),\n  displayData(c1),\n  executeResult(c2),\n  stream(c3),\n  stream(c4)\n).pipe(\n  childOf(message),\n  outputs()\n)\n```\nThe result of that would be (since filtered on outputs):\nof(\n  displayData(c1),\n  executeResult(c2),\n  stream(c3),\n  stream(c4),\n). Now that I've written that out, it must be done. I'm drooling at the declarative-ness.. Something seems a bit off with the coverage reports.. This last commit should be it -- the only open questions for me are what namespaces we want. My first inclination is:\n\n@nteract/messaging/operators\n@nteract/messaging/messages\n\nI could make them all just be part of the top level @nteract/messaging namespace too.. Since this is working well and I'm ready to iterate on other parts that build on this, I'm going to go ahead and merge it. Thanks all!. Does electron builder have an option for that? Flatplak seems like something that would sandbox enough that we wouldn\u2019t be able to connect to kernels, I could be wrong though.. It looks like there is not flatpak support yet for electron builder, which we use to build our electron desktop app: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/512\nI'm going to close this issue and we'll wait on upstream to support it. If you wish to engage there, you can help implement it in electron-builder.. Yeah, I think the print stylesheet should be able to take into account non-shown cells by setting them as display: none when printed.. My comment was about how we should likely go after this, which means changing the source for nteract itself. It's pretty easy to make a release so if you fix it then we'll get it out to all users pretty quickly.\nHere's where the print CSS is: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/c24d6dc30de111db5d29495a4db85d742fc4f197/packages/desktop/src/notebook/main.css#L19\nI think we'd have to apply some easier classNames to those cells, I can't tell if what's in https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/b6168bb9db266ea83857a315f21aa3b81b850995/packages/desktop/src/notebook/components/cell/code-cell.js#L69 right now is flexible enough to make the CSS styling easy.\n. Closed by #2003.. /cc @klebba. We did all this! \ud83c\udf89  Hooray!. Thanks for going through this!. This is looking nice and trim. I just tried it out and love how it looks.\n\n. Oh man, I've made this come up by trying to use the devtools too. :( I'll look into this on the weekend if I get a free chance.. Done!. > A hacky solution might be to just show a disabled, empty Editor component when the input is hidden.\nWith display: none?\nHow are we doing navigation between markdown cells that are in view mode? Do we register something on the div?. Thank you for looking into this one by the way! I don't think it's absolutely essential right now, it was just a quirk to me.. I wish I would have put skip ci in my commit message \ud83d\ude04 . Merging since it's a README addition that will be way more transparent than our current empty view.. Ok, now that we've done quite a bit on master I'm getting a little anxious about the fact that we haven't had a release in a while. I'm tempted to do an unfix for the menu + refocusing to just make the menus always show (keeping the redux store on the main process in place).. We're on the 0.4.x line so we can close this..

This needs to handle our display updates mechanisms though, otherwise they're handled out of order.\n\n. I suppose a simpler way here that won't break updatable displays is to only buffer stream outputs, which are the primary offender.\nAnyways, I'm going to table this as I need to do more for the web app and it was just a short experiment.. Ok this now works for display updates. It would be nice to move our own reduction steps around for injecting into the bufferTime setup. Knobs to fiddle with I suppose.. I forgot you added on to this @captainsafia! Should we rebase it and take it for a spin again?. Closing for now, let's revisit this later.. Awesome, thank you!. Done!\n@dhirschfeld Yes! I'd love to do that. Can you open a new issue about grouping kernels? (sorry I missed this one until now).. Closed by #2350.. Since this can affect accessibility, we should definitely have this as part of some globally allowed CSS setting.. Old discussion for tabs & spaces is here: #1238, #1261, and #1256. We have the default set to 4 spaces for the sake of keeping the Python consistent with PEP8 (I might even so far as to say we'd adopt yapf for Python).\nFor javascript, I'd prefer it was two spaces. Since I don't like going back and forth on these though, I'd prefer we stuck with something like prettier for autoformatting of JS.\nWhat I need though is someone would take up the mantle of codifying our config setup for codemirror, implementing it, and maintaining it. We have a config setup that is persisted, it requires some tying things together to get the options you want though.. Sure! That could be set by the user individually. We'd need someone to implement it and maintain it.. Here's a CodeMirror discussion on FIXME highlighting. Seems it's not so simple to add them on as tokens individually, we'd probably have to add them on to all the existing modes similar to how we define an ipython mode.. Adding on to my old comment, would it be ok if this was only done in Python by extending our ipython mode?. @alexandercbooth had some starter work with this that was looking pretty good in #1649. I'd love to see that visited again. \ud83d\ude04 . Since we did some major refactorings underneath, you may want to start a new branch from master since the desktop package is now properly part of the monorepo.. P.S. Great to see you again!. Feel free to submit feedback later, I'll go ahead and build on top of this. The plan here is to bulk export portions of the desktop app that feel stable.. This was done in applications/showcase for those interested in fleshing this out.. Bokeh puts itself on the page with the output_notebook method. It then expects to be available later on in the page everytime Bokeh is \"used\":\n\nWith iframes, the assumption that you can do javascript in one cell (like loading a library like bokeh) and then using something from that same global scope is no more. Every iframe has its own sandbox.. Nice, that'll be excellent. Then we can integrate that directly in.. @captainsafia -- here's where we can start from for execution, hooking up to the jupyter API. Changes need to happen on rx-jupyter to handle tokens though. I'm going to let @captainsafia pick this up (even if as a new branch) while I'm doing other @nteract/core cleaning and integration with the original reducers.. \ud83e\udd14 Oh yeah I should delete the tag commits probably. Did I do that for the other imports? I'll come back to this after family things.. Oops I meant to delete the old release commits / reword them to match the lerna style like I did for other PRs.. All good, I'm going to see if I can fix it real quick. I will either rebase master or just revert this PR. I'm really sorry, I should have put WIP in the title after I initially noticed the tag commits.. Since the revert is a single commit and all the commits are interwoven, I think we'll just go with this. \ud83d\ude2c  Time to make my clean up PR next.. We so need this still. \ud83d\ude0f . That's correct. The @nteract is the name of the actual package as published on npm -- look in their respective package.jsons.. @nteract is a namespace for scoped packages on npm for the nteract project.. Oh that makes sense. \ud83e\udd14  I wonder if there's a way for spawn to check that the right webpack files are on disk and ready first.. Can we close this one, now that we've updated a bunch of the initial startup gunk?. I think this is ok now right @mpacer?. Yeah instead of doing these at each individually, I go for the top layer which is at https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/packages/display-area/src/richest-mime.js instead of building in the MimeWrapper into each of these.. This is looking good, I\u2019ll take it for a spin locally later today. Thanks for finding the cleanest way to go about this.. Looking good.\n\nI'll get the tests updated and put some formatting in for the message.\n. \n. Expanded:\n\n. Thanks for tackling this @mpacer, glad we have it in!. Since I see you're making similar PRs across several projects (for example https://github.com/owtf/owtf/pull/899, https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/pull/6255), I'll take the liberty of saying don't do that here and please don't waste maintainer's time. We tend to be happy to help people work on real changes and don't appreciate what is effectively spam.. /cc @theengineear . > Looks like all of this is coming from one package. Were these actions already being imported by other packages then?\nThe @nteract/core package was empty before this, all the logic here is being extracted from desktop so that we can use it in multiple web apps.\n\nSide note, I noticed that the types don't seem to be namespaced. E.g., const SAVE = \"SAVE\". If we end up having a central place for this information, we should make sure we're namespacing correctly.\n\nThat would be fine. Are you thinking something like NTERACT@SAVE?\n\nAlong those lines, it might make sense to eventually organize these files by purpose, maybe nesting these particular ones under /desktop or something? Just a thought, I haven't had as much 1:1 time with these packages yet, so most of these suggestions are really just questions :)\n\nIt's probably hard to see this from the changes but that's basically what's in place here now. Some reducers stuck with the desktop app and some went into core. The ones in core are intended to be used by any app that wants full notebook use. If I've put desktop specific things into core, I should take them out. \ud83d\ude04 \n. This is insane. Since I needed to change all the tests for components and whatnot, I ended up moving the components in as well... and... it works!\n\n. Alright, I'm back on this and fixing tests now.. This PR may or may not be insane to review. It's a good chance to shake off some cobwebs and help firm up the base here. We can iterate from here though, as I don't think we have to stick entirely to the current interface provided by the core package (it has a massive disclaimer on it).. I'm going to make a TODO list above to state where I'm headed with this, as well as capturing any review feedback.. Tests pass locally!\nI'm running a clean install, run, and dist now. \ud83e\udd1e . Thus far, things to fix:\n\nwebpack output\n\n```\n    ERROR in multi react react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend react-dom react-redux react-simple-dropdown redux redux-logger redux-observable immutable rxjs codemirror commonmark commonmark-react-renderer date-fns\n    Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'commonmark' in '/Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop'\n     @ multi react react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend react-dom react-redux react-simple-dropdown redux redux-logger redux-observable immutable rxjs codemirror commonmark commonmark-react-renderer date-fns\n\n    ERROR in multi react react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend react-dom react-redux react-simple-dropdown redux redux-logger redux-observable immutable rxjs codemirror commonmark commonmark-react-renderer date-fns\n    Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'commonmark-react-renderer' in '/Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop'\n     @ multi react react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend react-dom react-redux react-simple-dropdown redux redux-logger redux-observable immutable rxjs codemirror commonmark commonmark-react-renderer date-fns\n\n    ERROR in multi react react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend react-dom react-redux react-simple-dropdown redux redux-logger redux-observable immutable rxjs codemirror commonmark commonmark-react-renderer date-fns\n    Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'react-dnd' in '/Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop'\n     @ multi react react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend react-dom react-redux react-simple-dropdown redux redux-logger redux-observable immutable rxjs codemirror commonmark commonmark-react-renderer date-fns\n\n    ERROR in multi react react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend react-dom react-redux react-simple-dropdown redux redux-logger redux-observable immutable rxjs codemirror commonmark commonmark-react-renderer date-fns\n    Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'react-dnd-html5-backend' in '/Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop'\n     @ multi react react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend react-dom react-redux react-simple-dropdown redux redux-logger redux-observable immutable rxjs codemirror commonmark commonmark-react-renderer date-fns\n\n    ERROR in multi react react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend react-dom react-redux react-simple-dropdown redux redux-logger redux-observable immutable rxjs codemirror commonmark commonmark-react-renderer date-fns\n    Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'react-redux' in '/Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop'\n     @ multi react react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend react-dom react-redux react-simple-dropdown redux redux-logger redux-observable immutable rxjs codemirror commonmark commonmark-react-renderer date-fns\n\n    ERROR in ./src/notebook/index.js\n    Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'react-redux' in '/Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop/src/notebook'\n     @ ./src/notebook/index.js 17:18-40\n\n    ERROR in multi react react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend react-dom react-redux react-simple-dropdown redux redux-logger redux-observable immutable rxjs codemirror commonmark commonmark-react-renderer date-fns\n    Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'react-simple-dropdown' in '/Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop'\n     @ multi react react-dnd react-dnd-html5-backend react-dom react-redux react-simple-dropdown redux redux-logger redux-observable immutable rxjs codemirror commonmark commonmark-react-renderer date-fns\n    Child extract-text-webpack-plugin ../../node_modules/extract-text-webpack-plugin/dist ../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js!src/notebook/main.css:\n         54 assets\n           [1] /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/node_modules/css-loader!./src/notebook/main.css 14.5 kB {0} [built]\n            + 62 hidden modules\n```\n\n\n\nBased on the above I think this is because @nteract/core is the user of these packages but we've put it off to the side as a vendor bundle in webpack.

Woo, tests are passing and the app works. I'm ready for this to go in and for me to build some standalone pages to be able to work on UI features without having to run the whole desktop app.. WIP tag is off, this is ready for review and merge!. codecov, you really confuse me. I'm thinking you're getting coverage reports from only the desktop app for some reason.... I guess maybe things are fine, we just need to increase coverage overall: https://codecov.io/gh/nteract/nteract/compare/af7b5bc515a9928e89a6ae1991a1a71d24526674...431efc9fac57033c367bd13c8d7afd23ea159df1/tree/packages. Totally forgot to note in this issue that our GeoJSON transform is currently broken as a result.. You still came around to it. \ud83d\ude04 . Same issue under the hood as #2012.. Closed by #2350.. Definitely, thanks.. Oooh, looks like the yarn.lock is only at the base and that you can cd into a directory to run commands as is... \ud83e\udd14 . > Do Yarn Workspaces make Lerna obsolete?\n\n\nNot at all. Yarn Workspaces are easily integrated with Lerna.. So I guess we could be using it today by adding it to our lerna setup...\n\n{\n  \"npmClient\": \"yarn\",\n  \"useWorkspaces\": true\n}. > Could we add this flag to our bootstrap process?\nYeah, we used to use it. @lgeiger swapped it out due to an issue with electron builder -- he told me that it's since been fixed so we can switch back. I'll see if I can make our repo switch over to this today.. The only major annoyance I'm seeing for us + adoption is that we have to make contributors install yarn and set this:\nyarn config set workspaces-experimental true. I've changed everything locally that is necessary, time to push a PR and see what folks think. \ud83d\ude2c . \nCurrent run\n$ yarn\nyarn install v1.3.2\ninfo No lockfile found.\n[1/4] \ud83d\udd0d  Resolving packages...\nwarning babel-preset-es2015@6.24.1: \ud83d\ude4c  Thanks for using Babel: we recommend using babel-preset-env now: please read babeljs.io/env to update!\nwarning sinon > build > wrench@1.3.9: wrench.js is deprecated!

Nice!. Thanks for reporting.\nRelated issues (in the opposite direction): #1940, #1921 \n/cc @betatim . I'm assuming no errors showed up to give us any more insight?. I wonder if this is related to #1626. After cloning this branch and installing it (since you'll need the new dependencies), cd into packages/core and run npm run storybook. The server should start on 127.0.0.1:9001.. Closing in favor of #2057.. Closing, we should revisit this at some point.. This happens a little more gracefully with webpack 4, closing.. Probably not going to take cycles to do this, especially because we don't want to impact the epics.. Oh hey we've done this already! \ud83c\udf89 . Definitely warranted, along with turning the entire Notebook into a Record. I am super in love with Records now. \ud83d\ude04 .

When I brought dummy in as part of core, apparently I didn't realize that it was using one instance of jest.fn(). I'm seeing about deleting that now and setting the mock up elsewhere. \ud83d\ude04 . Now that tests pass, this is ready for review and merge!. Now that we have record makers for all our base state now, I'm beginning to think we should have less use of the dummy module. It's got a weird interface we haven't been maintaining well. \ud83d\ude12 . As well as a complete switch over from the mocha based tests. \ud83d\ude04 We're almost there! @lgeiger did most of the conversion already, a few stragglers remain.. This appears to be all finished off! No traces of sinon in the code base.. nteract does interact with the system differently than jupyter. We launch a subprocess directly based on what's in the kernel.json that goes along with your kernel. This isn't a Python process doing the launching nor started from your terminal so it doesn't pick up your defaults. \nIn order to fix this for your system, add the path to cudnn64_6.dll in your %PATH% environment variable on Windows.. Going ahead and merging because this is definitely the simplest usage possible with the security recommendations we ask of users (\"use tokens, don't disable them\").. Bringing this in as its iterative on the nbextension. Keep on moving forward.. It's odd to me that local git know this is a name swap:\n```\n$ git commit -pv\nNo changes.\nhusky > npm run -s precommit (node v8.0.0)\n\u2714 Running tasks for .js\n \u2193 Running tasks for .json,!package.json [skipped]\n   \u2192 No staged files match *.json,!package.json\n[next-gen-as-default 6acf40ac] set core as the default page for the showcase\n 2 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n rename packages/showcase/pages/{core.js => index.js} (100%)\n rename packages/showcase/pages/{index.js => transforms.js} (100%)\n```\nYet GitHub thinks the changes are in the files and that we changed three.. Woo, three left to go on my checklist. \ud83d\ude04 . Yeah I don't think this theming is fully fleshed out here.\n\n. (looks like I need to make sure that rendered markdown and outputs are using the themes... I'll have to do some other checking here...). Looks like it's likely because of the lack of the top level styling from main.css:\ncss\nbody {\n  font-family: \"Source Sans Pro\";\n  font-size: 16px;\n  line-height: 22px;\n  background-color: var(--main-bg-color);\n  color: var(--main-fg-color);\n}. @tlyon3 -- this is the work in progress re-write / simplification of <NotebookPreview /> using the @nteract/core components and a static viewer (no codemirror). It would be great to have you look over it, especially with regards to how you're currently theming Quantecon  bookshelf.. Everything is lookin' good. Time to fix up flow and tests.\n\n\nThis is definitely ready for reviewing!\n. Note: our use of react-syntax-highlighter will need adaptation to match our code styling. I would love if someone picked that up as another PR.. Here's where I'm stuck after doing a fresh git clean -xfd && npm i:\n```\n FAIL  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/index-spec.js\n  \u25cf Test suite failed to run\n/Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop/node_modules/@nteract/core/src/components/notebook.js:3\nimport React from \"react\";\n^^^^^^\n\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token import\n\n  at ScriptTransformer._transformAndBuildScript (node_modules/jest-runtime/build/script_transformer.js:305:17)\n  at Object.<anonymous> (packages/desktop/src/notebook/index.js:13:17)\n  at Object.<anonymous> (packages/desktop/__tests__/renderer/index-spec.js:1:116)\n\nSummary of all failing tests\n FAIL  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/index-spec.js\n  \u25cf Test suite failed to run\n/Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop/node_modules/@nteract/core/src/components/notebook.js:3\nimport React from \"react\";\n^^^^^^\n\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token import\n\n  at ScriptTransformer._transformAndBuildScript (node_modules/jest-runtime/build/script_transformer.js:305:17)\n  at Object.<anonymous> (packages/desktop/src/notebook/index.js:13:17)\n  at Object.<anonymous> (packages/desktop/__tests__/renderer/index-spec.js:1:116)\n\n``.

This hasn't been an issue recently, I think we're good.. Ok, this is super ready for some initial review @captainsafia! I'm going to take a break for a bit and look forward to feedback or questions you have. \ud83d\ude04 . Ok, I'm going to see if I can fix tests up. I recognize that I made it harder on myself by having more in theCellcomponent that was previously tested in theCodeCellcomponent.. Alright, tests are passing on Travis and Appveyor!. Ok, everything is in a really good state except one... It's one of my favorite themes,theme-nteract.css`. \nThe nteract theme (not to be confused with the default which is called light) does a bunch of deeply nested changes that are dependent on the original DOM structure. I'm tempted to bring in some of the opinionated styling from the nteract theme into the base components (especially the barbershop stripes).\n\nAll the changes (open me)\n\n```\n/*\n  General note on this theme: the class \"notebook\" is used before several\n  selectors to override collisions with the main stylesheet.

We've taken a slightly different direction by making our components include much of their styling, while the themes are now intended to be included to swap out CSS variables. If you're up for it, I'd love to pair and figure out a good direction to go with it.. Now that I've looked at both the currently released app and this copy, I see that the new CSS encapsulation actually fixes some things:\nv0.3.4:\n\nThis branch:\n\nWhile not all of the stylized nteract theme carries over cleanly (and I'm not sure how it can), this approach is leading to components that are better encapsulated.. I think this PR is good to go and I'm looking forward to the next round of this work. \ud83d\ude04 . Rebasing this PR since there were a bunch more changes to main.css that led to conflicts.. main.css is so much smaller, this is awesome.\nI can't wait to do the draggable cell component next, that one is going to get severely cleaned up. \ud83d\ude01 . Once Travis passes, we'll be good to go.. Still gotta do this, I'm actually going to target this for the current milestone.. Woo, everything passes since I re-kicked AppVeyor. \ud83d\ude04 . We're off Appveyor so we won't worry about this one anymore.. > I gave AppVeyor a wangle-jangle to get the funky-gunky out of the way.\nwangle-jangle is my guiding phrase for today\nI'm happy to rebase this directly since it's likely conflicts in the main.css.. On github, for me, it's still showing This branch cannot be rebased due to conflicts. \ud83d\ude26 . Guess squashing is probably fine though, my default UI just shows that mergability is nil.. ~~Time to fix tests and possibly flow.~~ Done. This was not nearly as bad as I thought and I think I've got a little more I can clean up in the big notebook component. I can leave it in a new PR though. \ud83d\ude04 . The way to fix this is to make the cell-drag-handle a child of the <Cell /> component. The cool thing is that we literally just have to pass it through to the <Cell /> as a child since the <Cell> component is just a styling container.. I'll fix this one, just possibly after I finish some other things today.. Still an issue, it relates to the relationship of the element with the hover and that the prompt is not a descendant of that element.. Also fixed something else I noticed, which was that codemirror hints were appearing below sticky cells. I made CodeMirror hints' z-index high to counter this.. Thanks @betatim. Luckily this PR is more shuffling than additions.. This doesn't go the whole way for unifying the codemirror component and our little wrapper -- it gets us started though and I'm happy to say that we now have some basic flow types here.. A little more work to do here and I think we'll have a nice clean surface for our editor.. Rockin'! Thanks.. Omg, I'm loving it. This interface is looking good. . One thing we'll end up doing after this is provide the mapping function for going from these messages to the Jupyter multiplexed version:\n\njs\n(enchMessage) => Object.assign({}, enchMessage.body, { channel: enchMessage.type }). Now that I know this is working, I'm tempted to do the style extraction in a separate PR.. Fixed the tooltips! (Howdy @alexandercbooth! I didn't realize we broke it -- oops).. Fixed up the rest of the tests, I'll come back to put the default values on CSS variables and then this will be all set. Super ready for review, I seriously hope I'm done with these shuffling PRs soon. \ud83d\ude09 . Still an active bug, definitely see about killing it with this milestone.. This is currently fixed on master, we'll get a new release out :soon:. Thanks for reporting!. I wonder if there\u2019s a way to test the script from appveyor. I really wish there was some magical way to only test the code that only affects windows (path handling). We end up mocking all the things that touch the system when we probably should have a few integration or functional tests.. I'm going to operate under the assumption that this is in a good state and make it part of the shipped app tonight.. This should be good to go, I fixed this a few releases ago and haven't triaged all the issues to the degree I've done in the last few days.. That would be really cool! It seems like a difficult feature for us to implement and maintain, as we'd want to build a standard around it. There's already a lot of difficulty in maintaining the current markdown implementation without having competing camps of people wanting conflicting grammars in markdown.. This one is so strange and is the next for me to tackle this morning.. That's a regression from me doing an overall components and CSS refactoring. I'll get this one matching up and a release out in the next couple days with fixes for each of the recent bugs.. I'll see if I can get this one fixed too since I knocked the other recent regressions out, and then we'll make a nice happy patch release. \ud83d\ude04 . Ah I see, the queued state is not trickling through here. I'll work on this. Sorry about the messiness of this release, I did an overall refactor of the components to make them simpler to work with and missed quite a few edges while simplifying the components. Thank you @dhirschfeld.. What do you think of the new queued marker \u2026 and the ol' busy marker *?. We now have a queued marker and a busy marker. \ud83c\udf89 . Erring on the side of getting these regression fixes shipped quickly.. Took out my cutesy delta in favor of the word change for the sake of commit history cleanliness. . Oops!. Jay is a great linter! I\u2019m surprised our old linter settings didn\u2019t pick this up (and that we didn\u2019t notice it).. Thanks for resolving this.. Now that I'm working with tests for enchannel at the very least, it looks like the tests are running against lib instead of src for quite a few so there's a mismatch. \ud83d\ude15  Some things definitely to fix up in the repo here.. Rebased this just now, time to see about getting it working.. Rebased this, should hopefully be in a passing state now.. Our core tests do run, they have to be run from the top level though:\n```\n (core-test=) kylek@nfml-83G ~/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract$ npm t\n\nnteract-monorepo@0.0.0 pretest /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract\nlerna exec --scope enchannel-zmq-backend -- npm rebuild\n\nlerna info version 2.5.1\nlerna info versioning independent\nlerna info scope enchannel-zmq-backend\n\nzeromq@4.6.0 install /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/packages/enchannel-zmq-backend/node_modules/zeromq\nnode scripts/prebuild-install.js || (node scripts/preinstall.js && node-gyp rebuild)\n...\nnteract-monorepo@0.0.0 test /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract\njest\n\nPASS  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/epics/execute-spec.js\n PASS  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/reducers/app-spec.js\n PASS  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/epics/loading-spec.js\n RUNS  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/index-spec.js\n RUNS  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/epics/index-spec.js\n PASS  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/menu-spec.jss\n PASS  packages/notebook-preview/tests/index.test.js\n PASS  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/epics/index-spec.js\n PASS  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/epics/comm-spec.js\n PASS  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/epics/kernel-launch-spec.js\n PASS  packages/editor/tests/editor-spec.js\n PASS  packages/transform-vega/tests/vega.test.js\n PASS  packages/transform-plotly/tests/plotly.test.js\n PASS  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/index-spec.js (5.004s)\n PASS  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/epics/config-spec.js\n PASS  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/native-window-spec.js\n PASS  packages/core/tests/providers/cell-creator-spec.js\n PASS  packages/transform-geojson/tests/geojson.test.js\n PASS  packages/editor/tests/tooltip-spec.js\n PASS  packages/editor/tests/complete-spec.js\n PASS  packages/display-area/tests/display-spec.js\n PASS  packages/transforms/tests/index-spec.js\n PASS  packages/messaging/tests/messaging-spec.js\n PASS  packages/display-area/tests/output-spec.js\n PASS  packages/display-area/tests/richest-mime-spec.js\n PASS  packages/enchannel-zmq-backend/tests/index_spec.js\n PASS  packages/fs-observable/tests/fs-spec.js\n PASS  packages/core/tests/components/notebook-spec.js\n PASS  packages/rx-binder/tests/index.test.js\n PASS  packages/core/tests/providers/editor-spec.js\n PASS  packages/transforms/tests/json-spec.js\n PASS  packages/core/tests/components/cell/cell-spec.js\n PASS  packages/core/tests/views/toolbar-spec.js\n PASS  packages/core/tests/actions-spec.js\n PASS  packages/core/tests/views/draggable-cell-spec.js\n PASS  packages/transforms/tests/javascript-spec.js\n PASS  packages/core/tests/document-spec.js\n PASS  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/global-events-spec.js\n PASS  packages/transform-vdom/tests/index.test.js\n PASS  packages/core/tests/views/cell-creator-spec.js\n PASS  packages/transforms/tests/markdown-spec.js\n PASS  packages/ansi-to-react/tests/index-spec.js\n PASS  packages/transforms/tests/latex-spec.js\n PASS  packages/core/tests/components/cell/markdown-cell-spec.js\n PASS  packages/core/tests/components/status-bar-spec.js\n PASS  packages/transforms/tests/html.test.js\n PASS  packages/transforms/tests/image-spec.js\n PASS  packages/transforms/tests/text-spec.js\n PASS  packages/transform-model-debug/tests/model-debug.test.js\n PASS  packages/desktop/tests/main/reducers-spec.js\n PASS  packages/desktop/tests/main/actions-spec.js\n PASS  packages/desktop/tests/renderer/path-spec.js\n PASS  packages/core/tests/config-spec.js\n PASS  packages/core/tests/comms-spec.js\n PASS  packages/core/tests/middleware-spec.js\nTest Suites: 1 skipped, 53 passed, 53 of 54 total\nTests:       11 skipped, 326 passed, 337 total\nSnapshots:   5 passed, 5 total\nTime:        9.544s\nRan all test suites.\n```\nand developers can run specific suites from the top with:\nnpm t -- core\nSince that passes it straight through to jest.\n. Wow, that does not sound good. On my copy of 0.4.0 I'm not able to reproduce this issue. Does this work with new notebook files too or maybe you have a small example notebook?. Oh interesting! That looks like the \"classic\" theme. Perhaps there's some styling interfering with the hover mask, I'll dig in. Can you try the light theme?. I'm fairly tempted to only support the light and dark themes unless other maintainers work on our theming interface. I may fix parts of the classic, though it's likely that it won't look / work quite the same given our overall CSS refactoring that is going on.. We've since deleted the classic theme due to maintenance issues. Long live the light and dark themes! Thanks for the report @jocago.. Extremely odd, though I know the likely culprit for this. Thanks for reporting.. Thanks @dhirschfeld.\nNote for maintainers, myself included:\nstyled-jsx has created three total class names for the editor on the markdown cell and it looks like styling just ain't happening here:\n\nBoy did I make things difficult for this release series. The hurrah is that we have standalone components with built in styles we can use elsewhere, the OH NO is that it's completely broken the desktop app.. All fixed and released in v0.4.2! Thank you @dhirschfeld.. Closing, I'll revisit this in the coming weeks.. As of #2103, master now is. I'll rebase this PR.. Ok, rebased against master and running into the same issue as before.. As pointed out by @lgeiger in chat, https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/2222 is a culprit for this.. Just to see what else might be an issue, I disabled the postinstall of desktop to go ahead and run tests. Across the board jest couldn't resolve uuid (which is at the root):\n```\n FAIL  packages/editor/tests/tooltip-spec.js\n  \u25cf Test suite failed to run\nConfiguration error:\n\nCould not locate module uuid (mapped as /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/packages/commutable/node_modules/uuid)\n\nPlease check:\n\n\"moduleNameMapper\": {\n  \"/uuid/\": \"/Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/packages/commutable/node_modules/uuid\"\n},\n\"resolver\": undefined\n\n```\n. Oh wait, that was hardcoded into the moduleNameMapper. $ ./packages/desktop/node_modules/.bin/electron-builder install-app-deps\nelectron-builder 19.46.9\nNo native production dependencies\n~~Um what?~~ Edit: oh right, I need to be in the desktop package directory. Interesting, on travis desktop is failing to build because it can't resolve nteract asset's css files.. Closing, let's revisit after the next electron builder release.. I am definitely prioritizing a release after this is merged.. Forgot to ref #1920, which isn't closed here as this is just a building block. \ud83d\ude04 . One more commit headed over with some basic tests and flow.. Possible (untested) usage with rx-jupyter:\n```js\nconst { binder } = require(\"rx-binder\");\nimport { kernels } from \"rx-jupyter\";\nimport { filter, switchMap } from \"rxjs/operators\";\nbinder({ repo: \"nteract/vdom\" }).pipe(\n  filter(m => m.phase === \"ready\"),\n  switchMap(msg => {\n    const serverConfig = {\n      endpoint: msg.url,\n      token: msg.token\n    };\nreturn kernels.start(serverConfig, \"python3\", \"/\");\n\n})\n);\n```\nFrom there you'll want to run kernels.create to get the websocket subject for working with.. Oddly, Appveyor ended up passing after I merged this. https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nteract/nteract/build/1.0.3955\nI've filed a support ticket with them since we keep having AppVeyor errors non-deterministically.. Thanks for looking this over @jameswomack!. We're in a happy state with our webpack configurator so I think we can close this.. Totally cool, I'm really happy you report these and are having patience with this release series.. /cc @captainsafia -- fixed up the kernel creation with rx-jupyter here.. I was running this server side with node, no browser.. There are tests for the reducers, it looks like they need to be reorganized though since they're not in a reducers directory. Here's the document one for instance: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/packages/core/tests/document-spec.js. Thanks! I'm going to ship these now so I can keep using them without a local fork.. I'm going to close this since we deprecated the nteract theme. I'd like to incorporate some things from this theme into the main themes though, especially the stripe animation.. /cc @mpacer . Want to make a new issue for the idiosyncrasies between rendering on each of lab, nteract, and classic?. To run this, after doing the initial dev setup of the repo:\n./node_modules/.bin/lerna run dev --scope @nteract/play --stream\n(or plain lerna at the front if you have it installed globally). \n\n. Once this is brought in, I'm going to deploy it. Heck, I think I'll deploy it now.\nOh wait, I'd need the changes to rx-jupyter deployed too.. Very cool extremely neat side effects of this work:\n\nAn application using a channel no longer needs sessions. This has been a thorn in the desktop app implementation for a long time. I'm going to follow up with session cleanup there too. This will make the nbextension / web app way cleaner\nMultiplexed channels are much easier to work with. \n. \n. so ready. I think we'll just merge both. Since this one is passing already, I'll go ahead and bring it in.. As is customary after your first PRs, welcome to the nteract party @yuvipanda! \ud83c\udf89 . It looks like the build is failing on master, which is my fault in hastily fixing certain things for packaging so we could ship the app. I'm getting this locally on master now too... O_____O. Hmmmm only with a fresh install, one dep must have changed that affects the flow definitions. It's bombing on all:\n\nexport type ...\ndeclarations.. We'd need all the packages it relies on to be released too. It would be nice to have a travis group that only runs on tagged releases and it would build & ship the docker images for apps that are webapps.. Seeing if the close and reopen works, since it should be testing the merge commit rather than as is.. The JS package releases are pretty simple. I think things are just changing for the likely proliferation of apps built on the packages here.. What's the notebook API shutdown call? It's just a POST to /api/shutdown right?. We can put this in, though there are some caveats to how I'll implement this:\n\nWe have to intercept the onbeforeunload\nWe will send the shutdown request and expect a response in ~500ms\nWithout a response in time, we're going to allow the tab to close, navigate, whatever regardless\nUsers can still force close their tab / browser\n\nFor reliability with this though, it would be tempting to somehow be able to lower the cull time based on active connections within a shorter time span.\n. This is indeed an issue that we have to fix up by changing where the electron app \u201cloads\u201d the page. Right now it\u2019s relative to our \u201cindex.html\u201d which is not what users need.. Thank you for the reproducible example. We've been working on some refactors that will make it likely that we'll be able to fix this for all notebooks. I'll let you know when we have updates. Thanks again for reporting @litaxc. The core error is that webpack is choking on the flow types:\nERROR in /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract-ext/packages/notebook-preview/node_modules/@nteract/core/src/actions.js\nModule parse failed: /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract-ext/packages/notebook-preview/node_modules/@nteract/core/src/actions.js Unexpected token (4:12)\nYou may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.\n| import * as constants from \"./constants\";\n|\n| import type {\n|   ImmutableCell,\n|   ImmutableNotebook,\n @ /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract-ext/packages/notebook-preview/node_modules/@nteract/core/src/index.js 3:0-37\n @ /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract-ext/packages/notebook-preview/node_modules/@nteract/core/components.js\n @ /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract-ext/packages/notebook-preview/src/index.js\n @ ./components/notebook.js\n @ ./views/contents.js\n @ ./providers/contents.js\n @ ./index.js. Usually these get resolved successfully with the babel-loader. The reason they get loaded from src is that we set the main field for the packages. It seems like that's not occurring now.. Some general suggestions from @lgeiger:\n\n\nWe should switch to uglifyjs-webpack-plugin\n\n\nThis may not be an issue, it is something we should do though since we allow up to date ES Syntax\n\n\n\"maybe it doesn't find the right babel config\"\n\n\nLooking at cat packages/**/.babelrc, they all have transform-flow-strip-types. Looks like I may have figured it out. When I borked the publish yesterday due to losing connection, it was in a partial state (after I hit ctrl-c) and not all the packages' dependencies got updated which meant that desktop was relying on the \"old\" @nteract/core from a prior release and not the local copy. Strange, but I figure it's best to document it in case we run into it again.. and sure enough I've got it! PR incoming.. > This causes a color difference on the left side as you scroll down. Is that intentional?\n\n\nNope. Definitely need to make that full height with both. Not sure how to fix that at the moment. \ud83e\udd14 \n. Yeah it\u2019s ok to call this an iterative improvement and create an issue for the color on the left down below.. I'd provide a GIF for this normally but screenflow is not working on the machine I'm on.. /cc @betatim @yuvipanda. Whoa I didn\u2019t know that term! Cool!. Once everything is adapted to the one multiplexed interface, a lot of the boilerplate in this code base can be cleaned up. We'll have one clean Subject.create that handles the session ID and username directly, like is now done in rx-jupyter.. ```\n FAIL  packages/enchannel-zmq-backend/tests/index_spec.js (9.984s)\n  \u25cf createMainChannel \u203a pipes messages from socket appropriately\n    TypeError: shell.source.map is not a function\n  at createMainChannelFromChannels (packages/enchannel-zmq-backend/src/index.js:155:2605)\n  at Object.<anonymous> (packages/enchannel-zmq-backend/__tests__/index_spec.js:33:58)\n      at new Promise (<anonymous>)\n      at <anonymous>\n  at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:188:7)\n\n```\nOdd, this passes locally. source should exist on an AnonymousSubject, which is the return from a Subject.create.. The error is quite legitimate, apparently with a fresh install the desktop app is now broken. I'll figure it out!. Oh of course! This was implicitly using map when we need to bring in the operator. Fix underway.. I think I'm going to preemptively merge this instead of waiting on AppVeyor. Thanks for checking it out @theengineear!. Woo, that was an overhaul. Really wasn't too bad, at least up until I have to fix tests (doing that soon). I'm really happy with these multiplexed sockets and the simplifications it does for messaging since it wraps in the session ID and username. Desktop is about to get cleaner, as is the nbextension. \ud83c\udf89 . By the way, this will definitely be due for some rebasing + squashing from me. \ud83d\ude04 . Ok I'm going to tackle getting all the tests fixed up here next.. Tests should now be passing, time for another review pass.. Tests not quite passing yet! Workin' on it.. Ok, these last remaining tests that need to be fixed are old Desktop tests that aren't on jest yet. I'm getting them adapted.. Woo! I think that covers it for tests. I almost went in a little over my head in bringing in all the leftover mocha tests to jest then realized I should definitely scope this to only the kernel related bits. Onward!. Going after my review TODOs now.. Alright, time for another earnest review.. Clean one mess, make 10 new ones I think that's the motto.. This PR will likely slow your browser, I am very thankful for anyone who has the patience to go through it (as @captainsafia already has). This is ready for a final review now beyond my initial pass.. Woo, ducks are in a row \ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\udd86, coverage is up 2.2%, and this is fit to ship.\nCoverage is up mostly because I moved old mocha tests into the covered jest tests.. thank you sooooo much. Are you cool with those two todos coming via new PRs?. Sweet, squash merged it and cleaned up the overall commit message. \ud83d\ude04 . Thanks for reporting this, we should definitely make this a part of configurable editor settings.. ## Prototyping Category\nWithin the prototyping category, I'd like to focus efforts on discovery tools for notebooks.\nIdea 1: next gen notebook viewer with indexed contents, ways to search it\nCommunity Building\nProvide a workshop on jupyter protocol + format fundamentals. Participants will build a new frontend on top of jupyter, backed by binder, using nteract components. Beyond their own personal knowledge gain, they'll also be ready contributors to projects across the Jupyter ecosystem.\nCurriculum\n@captainsafia suggested we could focus on some documentation efforts. Given that we have ourselves a nice suite of components, we could develop materials woven into our main site that provide an overall narrative and learning experience.. Note: since I noticed the initial submission was pretty simple, I submitted the \"jupyter infrastructure fundamentals workshop\". Also still happy to pair or help others with other categories.. Deadline has passed, I'll go ahead and close this. We can revisit if/when we make the next round on any of our proposals.. Thanks for going after this, it's going to be awesome to be able to change the image backing the play instance on demand. Once we get this situated, we should figure out how we want to represent a particular fiddle / pen.\nRight now I'm thinking query parameters would be fine. We shouldn't make them part of this PR though, as this one could just be for setting up the initial form, state handling, and server/kernel lifecycle. I'll post a new issue for the query parameter & persistence layer.. > Is there a good way to get the list of available kernels inside an environment directly from binder or do we use the kernels from rx-jupyter to accomplish that?\nWe'd have to use the jupyter kernelspecs API to find out.. A GET on /api/kernelspecs with no kernel name in the path returns the full list of kernels as JSON\n\nLet's mark switching the kernel for another PR though, as it's an additional complication. We should just assume our current default is fine for iterating on only the form field for the repo.. By the way, this is the notebook source file you'd want to look at for that API: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/services/kernelspecs/handlers.py#L49. New review comments, since I've taken it for a spin -- when the form is submitted, I'd expect the logs to be cleared out, ready for the new logs.. > So, if we only clear the logs (see recent commit)\u2026 this results slightly bizarre behaviour if you submit multiple times in rapid succession:\nThat's totally fine for now, we'll want to interrupt the previous call to binder once another submission is hit (in Rx parlance, we'd use a switchMap and we'd also want to shutdown the previous server to be kind). The way play is written right now, it's fairly unavoidable (without more state management around events).. There's an API, see https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/2126. This is working pretty darn well!. I'll check out the lint thing now.. Based on the docs for jsx-a11y/label-has-for sticking the input inside the label will make this succeed, even though they also say to use htmlFor here. I'll push up a commit fixing it then come back to review again.\nI ended up getting rather busy last night so I wasn't able to touch this until now. Apologies.. Oops, I just realized that fixed it while also breaking our previously good CSS. I'll fix that next.. Good stack exchange post on why it\u2019s good to put inputs inside their respective labels: https://ux.stackexchange.com/a/47920. \n. As long as you're cool with it (and don't want to do the component refactoring suggested above in this PR), I think we can merge it.. For the sake of fixing master, I'm merging this. Thanks y'all.\n(and sorry for the earlier breakage).. This is not too big a deal anymore, especially considering we're on dedicated workers on CircleCI. Punting on this.. Since I'm doing a bunch of movement in #2149, I'm going to close this and redo it.. Thanks for fixing this one, I've been annoyed with this on the desktop app and wasn't sure what was going on.. It does indeed, thank you!. /cc @willingc I'm shuffling a lot of things here and changing the READMEs around so they reflect our current state, which is that we have many modules in here for general use as well as applications in development (desktop, play, jupyter extension, showcase).. Rebased since I merged @mpacer's recent PR. After Travis passes, let's merge this!. That's ok, we can do the next part of the refactor to compose them from pages/index.js in another PR.. The build:flow part isn\u2019t actually doing any type checking, it\u2019s just copying over type files for us so the types are up to date inline.. This is getting sooooo close.\nYou can now run npm run app:commuter from this branch to run the commuter app. It's using our core components and renders a bit faster (not by any metric, by my own account). We probably need to bring our styles to non-codemirror code rendering though:\n\n. Aw crap, some of the subtree import ended up hitting the root. Time for git-fu. Guh. This duplicated things due to how I rebased. I have to run to something so I'll come back to this again in a couple hours.. Closing in favor of #2162.. Oh interesting, you only have to do that for shell, control, and stdin?. Soooooo even after the monitoring setup I'm running into this. In fact, it's almost worse now. Things I can tell now after logging more:\n\nThe kernel is very much alive and can be connected to with a separate jupyter console --existing ...\niopub is still functioning, and is passing on through our subjects\n\nIt seems like it's the sending that isn't working. There was a new jmp release that we went ahead with upgrading to. Is that the root of the cause?. One definite strangeness in our app is that it appears that the channels are being created twice in a row.. Whoops, that was just on my branch.... Thanks!. The emoji is awesome and yeah we will have to use backticks. :smile:. oooook, this is in a good, working, non-conflicting state with a working app using npm run app:commuter\nTime to find out all the flow and lint quirks that need to be tackled.. Current holdup is now react-timeago, which appears to have gone into a bit of stasis as well as mismatches between releases on GitHub vs. releases on npm. 80% tempted to bring it into our monorepo as well.... This is now ready for an earnest review. If you skip the first 3 commits, the rest are the adapation code to look over. You can now run npm run app:commuter to run commuter within the monorepo.. That is a legitimate and totally valid error, apparently only showing on Windows:\n```\nFAIL packages\\timeago__tests__\\index-spec.js\n  \u25cf TimeAgo \u203a just now\n    expect(received).toEqual(expected)\nExpected value to equal:\n  \"0 seconds ago\"\nReceived:\n  \"0 seconds from now\"\n\n  at Object.<anonymous> (packages/timeago/__tests__/index-spec.js:11:28)\n      at new Promise (<anonymous>)\n      at <anonymous>\n\n. Went with `then <= now` so that when it's the same time it reads as `0 seconds from now`, while also making the timing consistent with a fake `now` function.. One omission on this PR \u2014 I think commuter front end is still depending on the official octicons package and it should get deleted out of the package.json.\n    Expected value to equal:\n  {\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"}\n\nReceived:\n\n  {\"Authorization\": \"token \", \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"}\n\n```\nSure enough, that needs a fix since the token is not set.\nIt doesn't appear to be 96f83b920d86d622151d30ac791b49106822183f though as that's adding it to query params, not the headers. I can investigate and submit a fix.. Cool by me.. Oops, looks like we need a .npmrc with package-lock=false at the base of this app as this PR created a package-lock.json.. I think with the dropdown menu killed off, we're all set on this front.. Oh my gosh, thank you.. Thanks!. Thanks! That really helped me understand.\nIt seems like we should probably not pin our packages/ tightly and do pin applications/ (libraries vs apps).. I suppose this one only makes sense if we were actually building and shipping the base docker image.. :)\nWhat I mean is that this docker image at the base is pointless and a bit unused, and our Travis build doesn\u2019t use it either. We\u2019re using dockerfiles inside of applications/play though.. I'll just go ahead and merge this so renovate can steam on ahead, and I'll worry about Docker later. \ud83d\ude04 Thanks for all the getting started help @rarkins.. This one is going to fail. \ud83d\ude1b . Should I set the renovate config to include:\n\"packageRules\": [\n  {\n    \"packagePatterns\": [\"^flow-bin\"],\n    \"enabled\": false\n  }\n]\nJust as a key at the same level as the extends?. I'm not sure if this can have an update yet, so I'll close this one for now.... Not sure if we can upgrade this, though we probably should. I'll just close this one for now.. Yeah, we've pretty much broken away from semantic commits.. Thanks @rarkins!. Now that we only have light and dark themes, I can close this since we won't support the other themes again.. @captainsafia is going to upgrade this one while adapting.. It's mostly that uglify does not handle ES6+, I believe most folks have been switching to uglify-es and we'd need next to do the same for us.. I think if you rebase this one @thomasballinger we can merge it in and plow ahead.. Thanks all!. This is looking great! We can probably extract the pinned cell and other component to nextgen or otherwise here.. I forget, was this superseded by another PR @lgeiger & @captainsafia ?. I\u2019m so close on the drop down! After I\u2019m done Ice skating with the kiddos I\u2019ll finish it up.. Oooooook the dropdown menu, and by extension the toolbar, is ready to go so you can rebase and charge ahead here.. I've taken over this branch while @captainsafia is doing the valiant effort of upgrading our immutable to 4.0.0-rc9 and the latest in flow technology.\nSome initial TODOs / steps ahead to take note of where I think this needs to go:\n\n[x] Create this current notebook as a provider component\n[ ] See if there is a \"view\" level of component we can have as our base component\n[x] Move StickyCellContainer and PinnedCellPlaceholder to their own component files\n\nI'll keep adding to this list (and moving it to the top of this PR).. Ok this is mostly in order here. Seems to work well with desktop, I'll do some more checking of behavior here and review this thoroughly. Next up is tests. I'll add on to the PR description for the TODO.. Finished up each of those, now for the exercising of the app in case this touched parts that it shouldn't have.. Lookin' good on the apps side!. :shipit: . TODO: take this upgrade for a spin and update the vendorized CSS.. Travis continues to timeout during the jest runs. It looks like other projects have experienced similar issues. Some people \"fixed\" it by switching to yarn. Many of tests appear to be taking > 1 min. to run on travis for some reason now.. I'm going to go ahead and just merge this, then I'll exercise master and make sure things are alright.. Time for me to rebase this one.. All set and integrated with @nteract/core! Tried it out in desktop. Time to fix up tests now!. Tests updated, now to wait for Travis.. Ready! Check it out @captainsafia and @lgeiger!. Addressed review feedback, time to see what Travis thinks. \ud83d\ude04 . Fixed up the linting issue, tests are running again. \ud83e\udd1e \nI've also verified this is working well in desktop. \ud83d\ude04 . With @lgeiger's approval and passing tests, I'm going to go ahead and merge this since it was one of our release blockers.. \ud83c\udf89 \nOne thing we could/should do with enchannel is move parts of the README to a top level docs directory. However, it would need to match the two current enchannel implementations -- the one in rx-jupyter and the one in enchannel-zmq-backend. We could/should switch enchannel-zmq-backend to be named @nteract/zmq-backend (or similar).. Ok this now works for the webpack build yet not the server side bit because node doesn't resolve it. However, using babel-plugin-module-resolve is completely an option and matches up pretty well:\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\"module-resolver\", {\n      \"alias\": {\n        \"^@nteract/(.+)\": \"packages/\\\\1\"\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n}. At the very least I've figured out a great way to handle aliasing styled-jsx so that there's no initial flicker. Also, I think we can probably keep the old showcase now and have it resolve the appropriate src directories too. \ud83d\ude04 . Probably the best PR to watch for current ease with lerna: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/3319 (it's a PR for transpiling certain modules as part of the build). I'm going to close this and do over small parts of this as separate PRs.. Awesome!. You have the power @betatim!. Fantastic.. Sounds like it's fixed and certainly shipped since we've made many releases since January.. > Clear outputs each time source is run \u2014 that would seem to be done in an epic\u2026how would we ensure that it is cleared before the output messages are received and not after (which would be a fairly unpleasant UX)?\nThis seems like we'd have to do something \"cell\" like, which is tracking the originating message id to a collection of outputs.. > My intuition is that we should start the kernels clean and therefore start the source clean as well.\nI agree with this in spirit. Here's a user workflow that flies in the face of this:\nUser is writing python code, connected with a python2 kernel\nThey realize they meant to connect to python3 (and a different binder)\nThey expect to be able to finish what they were working on (and share it). The output should be immediately cleared after running code.. The kernel can respond with more than one output message (which is currently handled properly here). This is inherently asynchronous (and subject to the halting problem \ud83d\ude09 ).. The easiest way to do things \"too quickly\" is to press execute code really fast (at least with the old UI). Old outputs will come in slower than the clear outputs action does.. I'm totally reading this thread upside down so bear with me here. \ud83d\ude04 \n\nanything else you'd like to add to the list?\n\nI think it's ok to table a few of these, in particular:\n\nAdd functionality to interrupt kernels\nAdd functionality to kill kernels\n\nSaving them for another PR. When messages come in, they have two headers to pay attention to: header and parent_header. Within each there's a msg_id. For cells in a notebook (for reference), we effectively associate a cell id and their last parent message (for an execute_request).. We created one nice little operator for this in @nteract/messaging too -- childOf.\nchannel.pipe(\n  // filters all those that have parent_header.msg_id === req.header.msg_id\n  childOf(req)  \n). However, I think with this renewed epic setup and messages that pump through the central store -- I think you could just group messages that have the same parent_header.msg_id in the store. The outputs that show are those that go with the last execute_request's msg_id.. One excellent reason to have a CLEAR_KERNEL_OUTPUTS action is that the Jupyter kernels themselves can send a message called clear_output. You can do this via IPython with IPython.display.clear_output().. This whole discussion is making me think that the reducer from inside @nteract/core for document could be made to be a reducer for cells without a notebook (or we just manage this as a single cell notebook).\nAlmost always in most of the reducers they navigate through the notebook document state into the cells by ID, like this:\njs\nstate.updateIn(\n      [\"notebook\", \"cellMap\", cellID, \"outputs\"],\n      (outputs: ImmutableOutputs): ImmutableOutputs =>\n        reduceOutputs(outputs, output)\n);\nWhen I think we could make a reducer/action pair that would use the state of just a single cell (so a reducer per cell in the notebook app) and return the state of that single cell. The update display stuff makes this a bit more complicated, we can figure it out though.. Yeah we don\u2019t keep the package lock files in the repo. They\u2019d probably be fine within application directories, it\u2019s better for us not to at the moment.. I'm going to add one commit fixing up the flow and I'll comment inline as to why I went with particular changes.. Based on where this is at and how we need to keep evolving inner packages, my personal opinion is that we should merge this in and leave the TODOs as new issues to tackle after.. Yeah, I would aim for \"make things pass\", then we merge and move forward. There are a few improvements related to packages (namely @nteract/editor) that I want to do for the sake of all the apps, and I'd like to keep them separate from this one.. I'm definitely in agreement with @mpacer that we should keep the source code in the ui independent of the kernel.. All the tests pass locally for me, we're still running into issues with timeouts with jest on Travis and we're unsure as to why. As long as folks are ok with going ahead with this, I'd like to merge it.. I'm going to merge this now and create new issues for each of the todos with a play label + title tag.. Since this is going to the branch, I'll just go ahead and merge it and review the PR in whole.. I'm personally in favor of merging these in. If we need/want to move the record types up somewhere else later, that's totally ok. @captainsafia knows best as the one who has been working with the immutable 4.x upgrade.. Yeah I think that's smart @mpacer. Are you cool with taking that on?\nI'm going to go ahead and fix some of the warnings and errors I'm seeing in the jest suite, just to make sure we don't have an undiagnosed problem in the suites that should be handled regardless.. A few of the test cleanups:\n\nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/2247 (ready to be merged)\nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/2248 (ready to be merged)\n\nMy next step is looking into the github bits. I think I need to delete all my local github env vars to make sure I'm running the \"same\" suite as Travis.. Now that we're on CircleCI and the test times are better, I think we're good.. Oh right, this one is fine. It's the outputs that are currently tied to the kernel.. I feel like this is closed thanks to @captainsafia's refactor. \ud83c\udf89 . I think it's ok to use the nested bit. What you'll probably want to do is use mapStateToProps to create exactly the language prop you want from the overall state.. Something else you may end up looking into / asking about: \n\nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/1479\n\nIn particular, we currently pass a string for the language when ideally we'd be able to send the exact codemirror mode.. I don\u2019t think it has to be at the \u201cui\u201d level in the state object, only that we derive the value from the state. You can use other properties to craft this if you need to and if it\u2019s already in the state somewhere.. I'm saying that you can form the state however you want in mapStateToProps, computing values based on other values in the state tree.\n\nAn aside:\nProperties are an association of keys to values in objects. They're what you'd call attributes with Python objects. To make matters worse (better?), HTML uses the term attributes.\nhtml\n<a href=\"https://nteract.io\" /> <!-- href is an attribute -->\na = document.createElement('a');\na.href = \"https://nteract.io\"; // href is a property that becomes an attribute on the page\n. Yeah they\u2019re pretty cool! I love that you can use them to do reactive things like with traitlets.\nDefinitely separate concepts.. I would change this to using an action creator that takes:\n\nthe server ID\nthe kernelName\nthe language info\n\nWhich would mean that when the kernel_info_reply message comes through, the action is formed like this:\njs\nactionsArray.push(\n  actions.setLanguageInfoForKernel(serverId, kernelName, message.content.language_info)\n)\nI'm not sure how the reducers would need to be situated to make use of this though, I'd have to understand the utils.createObjectReducer used here. . Okee dokee. Want me to merge this as is then or wait for the languageInfo bits?. By the way, I'm not holding this PR back because of the single state comment above, there's a typing issue with the Editor and the current code here:\nError: applications/play/components/Main.js:134\n               v----------------\n134:           <CodeMirrorEditor\n135:             // TODO: these should have defaultProps on the codemirror editor\n136:             cellFocused\n...:\n180:           />\n               -^ React element `CodeMirrorEditor`\n159:                 : null\n                       ^^^^ null.

See: packages/editor/src/index.js:46. :rotating_light: I rebased this branch :rotating_light:. Ok, flow should be fixed. Time to let Travis do its thing.. Passes! Merging.. uglify-es upgrade under the hood, woo!. Why bot, why?. Oh I suppose that's in the config. Thanks for the nit PR. \ud83d\ude09 . Working on fixing up the tests and adding new ones. . This will soon be good to go and we'll have a much more stable app as a result. \ud83c\udf89 . Readyyyyy. Luck of the draw, I've still gotten the app to boot with a kernel not really quite attached / ready.\nI'll debug now.. Ok, things are more stable now. If I go after anything similar again, I think I'll bring the message encoding and decoding in from jmp, handling it inline with enchannel-zmq while having more control / insight of what's going on with zeromq.. @captainsafia check this out when you get a chance. . Now I fully understand how I fixed then broke this. The monitoring did patch around the sockets to make sure they're ready. Where I made a fatal mistake was when I did a refactor I connected to zeromq twice with the same identity (two socket connections). This completely broke all the ROUTER sockets (shell showing the most glaring of symptoms). After noticing this and cleaning it up, the sockets connect properly and stay connected.\nAll that's to say -- \ud83c\udf89  this is now working and stable and I learned a bit about how to break zeromq connections.. Sweet! We'll get a new release out soon.. It is!. Now saving you a whopping 20 seconds.. Looking forward to this!. Woohoo!\nWould you want us to bring in #2263 first then or do you want me to tackle the last few types on CellCreator?. Ok I'll merge it in and then git rebase -i origin/master this branch.. Rebased, time to see what issues I can address.. Danger mode time, I'm nuking the old Rx definitions and letting flow-typed generate RxJS 5.5.x defs.. Everything is about to pass!. Can't nuke Rx without nuking other definitions:\n```\nLibrary type error:\nflow-typed/npm/redux-observable_vx.x.x.js:31\n 31:       scheduler: rxjs$SchedulerClass\n                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ rxjs$SchedulerClass.

Oooook, I'll bring back the pretty good definitions here and we can fix them up.. Alright, back to me working through Rx + flow. \ud83e\udd1e . We are off to the races, time to see what Travis thinks.. Everything passes! \ud83c\udf89 . Yeah, mergeMap is right here since you want to make sure to handle multiple servers being killed in succession. What's not quite answered here is what would happen if the same server was requested to be deleted in a row (and there are Rx ways of handling that).\n\nI'll finish reviewing though.. > Not quite sure how to force serverId to be removed from the store\u2026which in light of your comment seems like the right thing to do.\nYeah, after successful shutdown (with that killServerFulfilled) we'd have to update the reducers to use that action to ~delete~ omit that server. Normally, if you want to delete a key out of an object, you use delete. With our store though, we shouldn't mutate state directly:\n```js\n\nx = {'a': 2}\n{a: 2}\ndelete x['a'] // Let's not do this\ntrue\nx\n{}\n```\n\nI tend to use omit from lodash for this:\n```js\n\nimport { omit } from 'lodash'\nx = {'a': 2}\n{ a: 2 }\nomit(x, 'a')\n{}\nx\n{ a: 2 }\n```. Since we just hashed this out a bit in chat, I'll port over the convo:\n\n\nWe'll likely wrap the call to createObjectReducer so we can delete the key on some actions or change up how createObjectReducer works\nWe keep having to recall how createObjectReducer is working, so we need to figure out a good balance for readability and maintainability around using it\nIt's ok to punt on deleting the in-memory references to the servers after they've been deleted by binder. It's pretty small and we can fix up the above later.\n\n. > ok i made some progress on this but now I'm running into a really strange issue:\n\nthe shutdown api is returning a 405 Method not allowed.\n\nThat sounds like the token isn't being done properly for the shutdown request. Do you have the full traceback? Sometimes it's a matter of a preflight being rejected (OPTIONS method).. Talked with M in chat, since the app still works yet doesn't shutdown properly I think we're ok to merge this in and file a bug. If I had to guess, it's on the rx-jupyter side.. Very much needed, I'm going to merge all the find/replace issues in #1817 and close this one.. Yuck. The cell isn't really disconnected from the store in this component now as the toolbar is still a provider component.... Getting closer though. \ud83d\ude04 . All set now for the first round.. Luckily I know we're not breaking things with upgrading a dependency for testing for sure if the tests pass. \ud83d\ude04 . We did this with metadata, should be good to go.. Nice!. Oooook, this makes the core package a bit more reasonable to read, with regular (no redux) components in @nteract/core/component and the connected ones in @nteract/core/providers. I also cleaned up all the _nextgen stuff. Next gen is here now and we won't have to differentiate. \nWe still probably want to do #2218, this at least makes a clean distinction here.. Thanks for the super earnest review @mpacer, I definitely want the nomenclature here to make sense, be approachable, and very useful.. > At the least, with them having the same names, there would be no way for someone to import both providers and components without renaming some of them or using the module itself as a namespace (which seems potentially annoying).\nYeah that's a very good point.\nNormally, as you see with the Toolbar component and the provider version of the Toolbar component, they do map between the view component and the provider. The provider version merely augments the view to have callbacks hooked up to dispatch.\nThe two that don't follow this pattern are Cell and Notebook. The plan in #2218 was to do away with the Cell as a messy component you have to pass things through and make Notebook act more like NotebookApp. On some level, this just goes to show that we're bearing the legacy of learning React while building the app.\nRight now I think I'm in favor of calling all the provider versions Connected, so ConnectedToolbar, ConnectedNotebook, etc. What do you think?. I've done some thinking while away for a bit and I'm thinking the following for a few components:\n\n<Notebook /> (from @nteract/core/components) --> <Cells />\n<Notebook /> from @nteract/core/providers --> <NotebookApp />\n<Cell /> from provider will get broken apart as it's one of those components that get too much threaded through. That's what #2218 was seeking to accomplish.\n\nPart of my rubric here is from the Presentational and Container Components post from Dan Abramov.. > I still think that \"functional\" vs. \"display\" split should also occur. But perhaps that should occur later\u2026\nIn some cases, they're intertwined -- especially as it relates to \"active\", \"selected\", etc. We'll figure it out together over time here.. > do you also mean creating separate components rather than working over one gigantic switch statement?\nAs much as possible I want to be able to pass the props for display area, editor, etc. directly, without having to pass it through a component above it (as currently works with NotebookApp's <Cell />). Right now that likely means a large component for the <NotebookApp />.. By the way, what I mean by threading is that, for example, with the <Editor /> component, if I wanted to change things on (the old version of) the component, I had to thread (read: sew) all properties through each component above it. The hierarchy used to look something like this:\nNotebook\n  --> DraggableCell\n    --> Cell\n      --> CodeCell\n        --> Editor\n          --> CodeMirror\nAs you can see now, most of those components are gone and we've been favoring:\n<Notebook>\n  <Draggable>\n    <Cell>\n      <Editor>\n        <CodeMirror>\nThe distinction being that we use children in the same way as you would with HTML.. I'm going to go ahead and merge this, let's keep refining our interfaces with new PRs. Luckily, unlike Python, we're only exporting some of the interfaces here so we can keep changing the underneath bits. As it stands though, we'll be making a major release of @nteract/core (which is currently at 0.0.8).. Adding on a little more details about the subscriptions -- we need to unsubscribe when the component is unmounted (or maybe also takeUntil).\nWithin our epics, that cleanup happens naturally. With standalone Rx, you need to track the \"subscription\"\n```js\n\nvar Rx = require('rxjs/Rx');\nundefined\nvar obs = Rx.Observable.interval(2000).map(i => i*100)\nundefined\nvar subscription = obs.subscribe(x => console.log(x))\nundefined\n0\n100\n200\nsubscription.unsubscribe()\n``. It's the component you'd wrap around the` instance like this:\n\njs\n<Editor>\n  <CodeMirror value={source}/>\n</Editor>\nWhereas if you were merely showing it as a read-only display you'd use:\njs\n<Editor>\n  {source}\n</Editor>\nThe component primarily exists to make sure that the style stays consistent between static rendering and codemirror rendering, while also working in tandem with the <Prompt /> and overall <Input /> component:\njs\n<Input hidden={sourceHidden}>\n  <Prompt />\n  <Editor>\n    <CodeMirror\n      tip\n      completion\n      id={cellID}\n      value={source}\n      language={this.props.language}\n      cellFocused={this.props.cellFocused}\n      editorFocused={this.props.editorFocused}\n      theme={this.props.theme}\n      focusAbove={this.focusAboveCell}\n      focusBelow={this.focusBelowCell}\n    />\n  </Editor>\n</Input>\n. I want to use the postfix Container because I personally think of these as containers, however the current standard nomenclature in the React community is that a\n\nA container does data fetching and then renders its corresponding sub-component. That\u2019s it.\n\nI have to wonder though... Maybe I could make <Input /> work with only <Prompt /> and \"whatever other child\" is within <Input />... Then people have to make a choice between using CodeMirror and the ReactSyntaxHighlighter. That does mean that @nteract/notebook-preview has to explicitly switch to using ReactSyntaxHighlighter. That or we detect that they're passing a string as one of the children and assume that it should be a ReactSyntaxHighlighter block.. Source seems ok. Usage would be:\njs\n<Cell>\n  <Input>\n    <Prompt />\n    <Source>\n      <CodeMirror />\n    </Source>\n  </Input>\n  <Outputs />\n</Cell>\nI'm not particularly keen on it. Maybe what we expose for static viewing vs. editing is a different component, but they both use the same component underneath for slotting themselves for <Input />.\n. I'm going to merge this in since it provides an explanation as to what the component is doing at the moment. Feel free to make PRs updating the text or making an issue for the further discussion.. yayyyyyyy. We can probably forgo making better icons, I'll get to working on that one over the next month or so.. > work making plotly plots rendering async and faster by using imperative interface\nWe can leave that one up to @theengineear later on, I think it's ok to be less performant and we can fix it up later. The Plotly transform itself could probably use the same fixes, so I think it's ok to say that it's out of scope for this PR.. > would it make sense to allow the backend to specify a push down which has already been run (eg buckited)\nWhat would the specified push down look like?. \u26a0\ufe0f I rebased your branch \u26a0\ufe0f \nGood news though!\nIf you do a nice fresh install at the base with:\nlerna clean\nnpm install\nRunning:\nnpm run app:showcase\nWill be wayyyyy faster, tests are cleaner, as is Travis. Happy hacking!\n. Also, if lerna clean doesn't work well, feel free to do the git clean -xfd thing.\nThis comes by way of https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/2285. One more commit and a notebook demo coming. \ud83d\ude09 . \nCertainly displays and can be toggled properly in the notebook, not the most useful thing though. It seems that indices should either be switched out or form the x-axis in most cases.. \nWhat do you all think of these introductory messages?. I incorporated the metadata.sampled proposal from @holdenk here. It's not much of a message, but it's something. \ud83d\ude04 . Rebased to match up well with master.. > Perhaps we can make a new issue and just assign me to it after we merge this in?\nThat works for me.. I'm going to see about fixing tests and go ahead with merging this in. I'll then create the follow on issues.. Alright, this passes. On to making issues!. This is currently failing because I didn't run the jest snapshots after running a local build of @nteract/core. Since @nteract/notebook-preview is resolving modules within lib, it's missing the current version. Commit coming shortly.. It looks like the tags created above totally failed.... I have the tags locally, and the commit.

New failures with the above approach:\nlerna ERR! publish Retrying failed publish: @nteract/commuter-frontend\nI'll get each of the issues fixes and update all release docs. Sorry about all the patch releases, folks. \ud83d\udea7 \ud83d\udc77 . If I had to guess while waiting on the current publish, commuter-frontend is failing because of mathjax asset copying.. Sure enough:\n```\nlerna ERR! > @nteract/commuter-frontend@3.0.4 prepublish .\nlerna ERR! > npm run copy-static\nlerna ERR!\nlerna ERR!\nlerna ERR! > @nteract/commuter-frontend@3.0.4 copy-static /Users/kyle/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/packages/commuter-frontend\nlerna ERR! > npm run copy-mathjax\nlerna ERR!\nlerna ERR!\nlerna ERR! > @nteract/commuter-frontend@3.0.4 precopy-mathjax /Users/kyle/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/packages/commuter-frontend\nlerna ERR! > mkdirp static/mathjax-electron\n... and a bunch more logs\n```. Oooook, it looks like the ship of all the packages and apps is all set except for the desktop app. I've got to run but I'll get that one out soon after lunch.. Oh wait, nevermind that... commuter-frontend broke because of uglify. Let me see if I can fix up that next.js setup.. Successful full publish with:\nlerna publish --force-publish=* --ignore nteract --ignore @nteract/commuter-frontend\nNow to figure out what's up with those two... \ud83d\udd1c . What even is this?\nNo prepublish script found at /Users/kyle/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/applications/desktop/scripts/prepublish.js\nWe don't have a scripts directory with the desktop app.... Woo! nteract \"published\". Stage 1 done, now on to the real publish of the built app!. I'm thinking now that our top-level npm run publish command should be something ships everything but applications. I'll then do the desktop release separately.. Ok I've fixed all the packages (I hope), do I try to ship as is, with patch releases across the board?. More notes from the trenches:\n\n~~npm install from the root should not run the desktop app's webpack build~~ Nevermind, that was me making a mess. I just made a release of all the packages with no problems just now so I'm closing this. We're in a good state now.\n\nSome things I did to double check that publish was going to go ok:\nlerna run prepare\nlerna run prepublishOnly\nThis forced making sure that all the publish related steps work appropriately.. This probably has to go in tandem with #2279 . This conflicts with the lerna hoisted setup, so I need to turn off the root level pinning somehow.. I wonder what our target should be then.\nOn another note, I'd love if styled-jsx was included in our babel config always because I want to keep the same config across all the component libs.. All set here!. Now that I've gone down this path with a freshened look (and the fact that I can troubleshoot it in between things), I think I may get this one wrapped up.. My most recent step was to make a way to inject the jmp dependency into enchannel-zmq-backend, so that the non-hoisted zeromq is the one that enchannel-zmq-backend uses. It's tempting to instead move this into the desktop app and let it carry its own copy of zeromq. We'd still extract what's effectively EventEmitter style hookup to multiplexed channels, which could be nice on its own since we use a similar setup in testing.. This... works!. Wow, we could even do yarn workspaces with this setup now. \ud83c\udf89 . No longer WIP. Since we're in a bit of a pickle with regards to:\n\nCurrent master exceedingly slow\nTravis having a large backlog due to failures at the start of the year\n\nI'd love to see if you think this should me merged in @lgeiger and click that green button. I will of course update anything that goes wrong and keep this moving well forward. Afterward I'd like to make a patch release of the packages because they weren't all linked up to the right versions.. Hey TravisCI is back, yay!. Now that it's back, we're at ~5 min. for the whole test suite too. Woooooo.. Sweet!. Thank you so much!. Well awesome.. We're in a good state on this due to #2338 and the follow on PRs implementing this for the Host and Kernel records. \ud83d\ude04 . Sure enough, those are still doing ye ole setState, no going through redux.. Ah, we're not using the submitBinderForm action yet.. Ok, all set! Now we've got eminently sharable URLs (sans content publishing).. Fair warning on the PR though -- while I was hacking on it I was able to crash my devtools (in Chrome) several times. I'm not sure if/what caused this and if it related to the router updates. I really only care about the shown location.. No more WIP tag, ready for review (especially the actual routing bit).. Since I think we've got some more to fix up here, I'm going to ship the current packages as is and we can refine this before shipping play again.. I rebased this, though I haven't addressed the concerns about location state. Still need to tackle that at some point.. The way this used to work was that it would show the drawer until the build was finished. We've got the actions in place to notice that, the behavior didn't port over.\nWe're also missing the provisioning display we used to show in the upper right too huh?. Dev mode:\n\n. Local \"production\" run:\n\nThis was performed by:\nlerna run build --scope \"@nteract/commuter-frontend\"\nlerna run start --scope \"@nteract/commuter\" --stream. Actually... it does. Had to make sure to rebuild @nteract/core first.. Ok, I'll work on making the labels consistent and possibly delete some of our old ones.. Some of the labels I'm going to keep around that have issues attached and we can clean them up over time here.. I went with what jupyterlab had as standard in their monorepo for names, though I'd be ok if the names had spaces in them. Guess I'd want to know what folks think.\n\nFWIW: I've also found more transparent colors work better for readability than the darker colors.\n\nI've tried to use lighter colors in these new tags. Feel free to adjust any that you think are abhorrent. \ud83d\ude04 . On a separate note, what if our default was DeepPink. Then it would be like a glaring\n\n:warning: :warning: \"You haven't included the theme on the page, so there are undefined CSS variables lurking about\"\n\n\ud83d\ude1d \n  . Done in #2732. Probably good to link this up with #2732. /cc @thomasballinger @theengineear \nAlso, I just noticed zeppelin has their own little suite of viz \"plugins\", I'm tempted to check out more of their approach and how well users are taking advantage of it.\nhttps://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0/development/writingzeppelinvisualization.html#how-it-works. nteract only ships one kernel built-in, which is the node.js kernel. As for all other kernels, nteract just loads all jupyter kernels installed. Run:\njupyter kernelspec list\nto see the kernel directories that you'll want to delete.. Fixed the above and noticed something else. Since the div for the markdown cell has no tabindex, the keydown and keyup events aren't doing anything. It's entirely handled by a higher level keydown handler we have in the notebook and in the cells. I'm going to tear it out since it's unused. I see what the behavior was for in the past (handling inter-cell navigation from the markdown cell), this has to be on the outside now.. I both tore it out just now and brought it back. We have fully navigable Markdown cells within a document again. \ud83c\udf89 . Well this fixes a bunch of regressions. Time to get this shipped. \ud83d\ude04 . I'd go ahead and merge @lgeiger, however I've made a bunch of new changes since your first approval. Check it out when you've got a chance.. If that works, awesome! Otherwise, since we have a pretty custom setup now and it works pretty well, I think what we'd need to do is:\n\nfigure out how to run the webpack dev server with our setup\n\nmodify the index.html template to check for the webpack dev server, only checking for it if we're clearly running it in dev mode. Mostly looking at https://github.com/jsdf/posts/blob/master/content/Make-Jest-tests-run-fast.md and the jest monorepo to figure out how to fine tune this. I think some of these changes we can keep, others not so much.. This is worth a gander @lgeiger -- let me know what you like and don't like. \ud83d\ude04 . Whoops! I broke coverage testing for a second here. \ud83d\ude04  I'll have this back to normal shortly.. I think I can reasonably say that this hasn't really changed the speed much, if at all.. Locally I'm sitting at 5.524s which is a good improvement. I don't know about Travis though.. Ah, that may be true. I'll make a smaller PR for just some cleanup of the top level testing commands.. Now that I've run npm t -- --coverage locally, I can see that this did help with the speed quite a bit.. The tests that could use the most speedup include:\n\n\npackages/core/__tests__/providers/notebook-spec.js\n\npackages/core/__tests__/actions-spec.js\npackages/core/__tests__/providers/cell-creator-spec.js\napplications/desktop/__tests__/renderer/index-spec.js\n. Nice, I was able to update the flow types, set up the DocumentState type properly (follow up to @captainsafia's excellent type work) and delete something like 6 FlowFixMe (though I did have to add one, we'll get to it though). This turned out to be a nice little flow upgrade.. Cancelled the middle build since we only care about the recent commit.. Nice, the env var expansion worked. This was in the Travis logs:\n\njest \"--coverage\" \"--cacheDirectory=/home/travis/.jestcache\". Since it seems like the kernel setup is pretty vital here, I'm going to carve those bits out too following on from #2338.. handy reference: https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Record.Factory. I would \u2764\ufe0f  a look-over of this PR.. Since this all passes, @captainsafia said it was great, and I've fixed the flow issue by adopting the official AppRecord, I'm going to go ahead and merge this. \ud83d\ude04 . > having kernel and kernelSpecs know about their host just feels oddly circular to me. I sorta feel like just having some component have host and kernel in its props will do the trick? I'm just wary of adding more state keys than are really necessary.\nThat's fine let's just set the type here instead of a reference to the host.. I think we're ok to merge this and keep evolving this with new PRs. I'll go ahead and rebase this.. @captainsafia -- would love your thoughts on this one, including if we need to document more in here. Something I learned a bit more fully via this plan doc and #2385 -- having old kernels that have to be cleaned up be able to be shutdown cleanly in epics is highly important, both for ensuring we're leaving the users' system in a good state and for giving us opportunity to see if/when the lifecycle isn't going well by inspecting the store.. In particular, these hokey little reducers should be in epics that can clean up old kernels rather than only being able to see current kernels: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/2385/files#diff-cefd1a3d3e94e5d5e684286dd7a56c21R41. We should probably rebase this so that it gets the updated circle ci setup.. Another addition we'll probably want to add to this plan is how we'll represent the contents API entries.\nGenerally, it's a map from path (/reporting/constructive-model.ipynb) to the contents API responses. I'll use https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nteract/vdom/master?urlpath=%2Fapi%2Fcontents%2Fexample-notebooks\n for this example.\n```json\nGET /api/contents/example-notebooks\n{\n  \"mimetype\": null,\n  \"writable\": true,\n  \"name\": \"example-notebooks\",\n  \"last_modified\": \"2018-01-02T21:44:05Z\",\n  \"format\": \"json\",\n  \"path\": \"example-notebooks\",\n  \"created\": \"2018-01-24T17:47:24.918265Z\",\n  \"type\": \"directory\",\n  \"content\": [\n    {\n      \"mimetype\": \"text/markdown\",\n      \"writable\": true,\n      \"name\": \"README.md\",\n      \"last_modified\": \"2018-01-02T21:44:05Z\",\n      \"format\": null,\n      \"path\": \"example-notebooks/README.md\",\n      \"content\": null,\n      \"created\": \"2018-01-24T17:47:24.914265Z\",\n      \"type\": \"file\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\nHere's https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nteract/vdom/master?urlpath=%2Fapi%2Fcontents%2Fexample-notebooks%2FREADME.md\n```json\nGET /api/contents/example-notebooks/README.md\n{\n  \"created\": \"2018-01-24T17:44:14.577890Z\",\n  \"path\": \"example-notebooks/README.md\",\n  \"last_modified\": \"2018-01-02T21:44:05Z\",\n  \"writable\": true,\n  \"type\": \"file\",\n  \"mimetype\": \"text/markdown\",\n  \"name\": \"README.md\",\n  \"content\":\n    \"Please submit your own notebooks built with vdom here!\\n\\nWe need your notebooks and we need you, join us!\\n\",\n  \"format\": \"text\"\n}\n```\nHonestly we're really going to be mapping (HostRef, Path) to a Contents entry. This one needs some thought. For now, since I'm working on the jupyter extension I'll only work on the one host case.\n. \n. Opting for a refs approach here too, as it will allow us to do renames successfully from the tree view.. I'm going to go ahead and call this on the path to where we want, let's go ahead and merge it. We can follow up with new PRs against the plan document.. Heh, apparently lerna publish with --ignore will not do the publishing of all the other packages. Cleaning this up some more. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. If I had to guess then, I'd say it's something with Uglify.. Sure enough, I took the uglify plugin out and it worked. I'll see what I can tweak.. https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/4359. Not that I think it's our internal use of mapbox-gl-js, that was just a decent thread with what could be the right issue.. Just for fun, I'm trying the google closure compiler now.. With Google Closure Compiler:\n\n. And the source of the issue:\nvar d3_document=this.document;\nNormally, this is window.\nhttps://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1330\n  . Options for language with closure-compiler:\nhttps://github.com/google/closure-compiler/blob/839656d772ae2dd5bbcc448442105422cb548ca1/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CompilerOptions.java#L2949. Ok, back to using uglify and figuring out what's going wrong.. Great thing to do when \"debugging\" Uglify -- set mangle to false in the build.\njs\n  new UglifyJSPlugin({\n    parallel: true,\n    uglifyOptions: {\n      ecma: 8,\n      mangle: false\n    }\n  })\nI think that's ok for us too to have in our prod build since we'd want a better error message if a user hits a catastrophic issue:\n\n. Better config for debugging:\nnew UglifyJSPlugin({\n    parallel: true,\n    uglifyOptions: {\n      ecma: 8,\n      mangle: false,\n      keep_classnames: true,\n      keep_fnames: true\n    }\n  })\nI need to work on other parts of the code so I think I'll leave this alone for now. Current options I'm seeing that are more workaround than solution:\n\nDisable uglify in general, just ship it\nDisable uglify on the webpack build of the main process'\nKeep tuning uglify parameters (possibly disabling some things) until it builds. Running the dist now works, so I'm going to ship the app :soon:!. annnnd the dist is still working, so I'll be shipping again soon with 0.7.0 (this weekend, pending Hydrogen's compatibility with the new mathjax setup).. By the way, I realize how silly the babel setup is for this package -- I left it consistent with the other packages just so they're all the same. It's been problematic when I've started (solely) ES5 packages in here in the past that turned out to need transpilation after new contributions.. Merging this so @nikitakit can head forward with this.. One other thing you'll want to do is add canvas to the no-hoist section of the root level package.json, right here:\n\nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/464e17003b4ba745776cbd386a354c094473cb3a/package.json#L24. Yeah I definitely wish that vega didn't have canvas as an optional dependency, it forces us to have it try to install even though we don't want it.. This is working well for me, though I don't have data to test with for the newer vega.. Let's do this!. I'm just shuffling files so the code coverage change should be a non-issue.\n  . https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript-plotly is probably the right way to go about it, @n-riesco is the maintainer of the ijavascript kernel too (the one we bundle).. That being said, we could probably use an example notebook that shows how to use it (and somehow includes the dependency...). This was so thorough @lukejanicke, thank you!\nWhat this comes down to is that nteract runs as a native app and relies on whatever PATH is available to it from launchctl (the process manager the Mac uses for .apps). We do some shell initialization so that we can find your proper python, node, etc.\nIt could be that our shell invocation this isn't completely working or is a deeper sign of the default python on your system not being the python3 executable, which means that the installed kernelspec is referencing the wrong python altogether. Since we don't launch in jupyter's python process, this doesn't get corrected by assuming that the python given is the sys.prefix of the current jupyter.. Heya, thanks for trying it out!\nYou still have to install plotly, it's not a builtin. Inside a notebook you can run:\n!pip3 install plotly\n(unless pip is your default python setup). IIRC, this is likely a case of needing to acknowledge the specific CSS classes defined between pandas HTML output and Jupyter. Jupyter notebook recognizes these directly, so they're a bit of an unstated CSS contract.. We should probably still do this.. Would you be willing to standardize the markdown setup across the entire monorepo?\nIf not, I can likely do that -- then we could just make one @nteract/markdown package we use internally that uses the LaTeX and markdown setup here, in all markdown contexts.. > Am I correct in thinking that nteract doesn't and won't support the double slash LaTeX delimiters (\\\\(\u2026\\\\) and \\\\[\u2026\\\\]; n.b.: the dollar signs are technically TeX delimiters and so are dispreferred by some)?\nDollar signs are the simplest to support, in terms of not conflicting the with markdown grammar whereas \\\\[ is completely plausible in markdown and should be able to be written without being treated as LaTeX. That being said, the mathjax config we have for mathjax-electron does allow for \\\\[ -- https://github.com/nteract/mathjax-electron/blob/master/resources/MathJax/config/electron.js\n\nHow does this handle multiline LaTeX blocks defined with \\begin{.}\u2026\\end{.}?\n\nI don't think this does. This swaps out the markdown parser and renderer to not be commonmark anymore so that the entities we want, particularly $$. Everything else is up to the mathjax config from mathjax-electron. I'll be taking a look at this next and rebasing against master. Stay tuned!. Fully rebased. I've put basic snapshots in even though they're kind of useless since they're not deep. Next up is switching our <Markdown /> transform to use this and getting rid of our old LaTeX handler.. Notes from me for things to fix:\nlerna WARN EHOIST_PKG_VERSION \"@nteract/markdown\" package depends on react-markdown@^3.1.4, which differs from the hoisted react-markdown@^3.0.0.\nWhereas this can only be fixed by making a totally separate package:\nlerna WARN EHOIST_PKG_VERSION \"@nteract/transform-vega\" package depends on vega-embed@^3.0.0-rc7, which differs from the hoisted vega-embed@^2.2.0.. OMG, this is looking so good and editing LaTeX has zero flicker.\n\nThank you so much for kicking this off @tlyon3!\n/cc @jeffwong -- LaTeX is about to be way better now in the notebooks, both in the coming nteract web ui and in commuter!\n. /cc @lgeiger and @BenRussert this will cause changes to our handling of the LaTeX and Markdown transforms, so you'll want to take a look at this. It does however handle things the right way in that math segments are formed during the AST created from the markdown source.. Ok I've forked @wko27's most excellent handling of react-mathjax into @nteract/markdown, included flow types and caught a few edge cases as a result.\nHi @wko27! Love what you've put into the component. I ended up forking it so we didn't have to rely on a particular git commit for our use in nteract projects.. Yeah, those are the transforms for the output mimetypes for LaTeX and markdown. This PR unifies what markdown and latex setup is used for:\n\nMarkdown Cells\nLaTeX mimetype\nMarkdown mimetype\nMarkdown (file) rendering in commuter\nMarkdown rendering for Zeppelin notebooks in commuter\n\nWhile also fixing a crap ton of outstanding LaTeX bugs we've had for a while.. Wow, Co-authored-by actually works in the UI.. > What is the Remark-math plugin doing now?\nIt's only use in here is for demarcating what denotes an inline math or math block, which are then rendered using that mathjax component.. git shortlog -sne | cut -f2 | sed \"s'^'Co-authored-by: '\" is my new yoink+give_attribution.

There is likely additional logging output above.. If I disable builds for play and notebook-on-next then all is well. I think I'll just upgrade the next apps to use a new version of next + styled-jsx in another PR.. Thank you for the outline and edge cases @mpacer! I take it what we could do for now is go with this current setup, following it up with adjusting the inline and block plugins from remark-math?. As for the ugify bits, master is not failing when running the build of the apps. If I had to guess, either the code here or one of the dependencies has untranspiled bits. Options:\n\nDisable the build for apps (for now)\nSee if bumping the next.js + styled-jsx versions works out\nAdjust the webpack config for play + others to use the uglify-es (again...). annnnnd it's the remark-math plugin that has untranspiled bits\n\n\nI might just fork that into here too since we are inevitably going to be changing how the parser works anyways.... Woo! Ok now to fix up desktop so that it includes our bundled mathjax still because it should work offline. I commented out the include from the index.html here.. Hmmmm... Now that I see how this all works, it's apparent that most apps should have <MathJax.Context> at a much higher level, since it's literally for setting MathJax via the context API. Any component that wants to opt in to the configured mathjax can use contextTypes.. I tried an experiment where a <MathJax.Context> can opt in to a parent <MathJax.Context>. It seems impossible to do that, based on when the context is set. \ud83e\udd14  Maybe though if I have a different context variable to set.. Took another stab at this, in order to have <MathJax.Context /> be a child of another <MathJax.Context />, it would somehow have to trigger once the parent is loaded.. The biggest nit I have with this setup is that in notebooks with N Markdown cells there will end up being N many <MathJax.Context> which each load a separate MathJax. The only way to get around that, since my multiple contexts approach didn't work, is to enforce that users of @nteract/markdown declare their own <MathJax.Context> at a high level.\nThe other reason it's annoying to have separate contexts is that they're deeply nested. For the desktop app I want to set it to use mathjax-electron because it's a local copy. For <NotebookPreview /> a CDN is fine.. OMG. Actually, I think I might have had the context stuff working right. I instead was running into an issue where it just wasn't rendering the mathjax on initial load.. :boom: We can now define custom MathJax config much higher up in an nteract app, and all the children will use the same MathJax setup, whether they're a markdown cell, a LaTeX transform, or a Markdown transform. \ud83c\udf89 . I had to pin react-virtualized in the midst of this, as they had a bad release in the middle of doing successive builds here. We can unpin it later.. Tests pass, let's get some reviews in (because this is a bit of a fundamental change) and then let's merge it!. Tests updated, we're more covered now!. As is customary with nteract contributions that demonstrate a spirit of positivity and continued collaboration, I'm inviting you to the org @tlyon3. Welcome to the nteract party! \ud83c\udf89 . Doing this now. I'm thinking this is where the flow types for actions should go too. \ud83e\udd14 . Done. Next PR will make sure that epics don't have their action creators next to them (this is entirely my fault...). This is ready for review!. I extended the comment so we can wait on Travis for this one.. Anything in the dev console?. Hmmm, I'm going to change our current behavior of erroring the stream when the parent_header.msg_id is not present to instead just log and ignore the message. We'll still want to do better handling and reporting of this.. Oh hey! Because of our logging I was able to find out when this happens. Sometimes the first status message from IPython has no parent header because there isn't a parent header (it's the first message and also distant from any request).\n\n. This is fantastic, thanks.. Nice! We can then switch to proper shouldComponentUpdates here.. /cc @captainsafia . Oh hey, this is fixed, thanks stale bot.. I'm thinking that somehow locally my setup wasn't fully bootstrapped (each of our packages weren't linked in these apps for some reason).. I was able to fix it locally (and quite sadly) by doing the git clean -xfd && npm i trick.. /cc @captainsafia -- for us to chat about and make a plan when you've got time. At first I was like \"that's silly, we don't do any binding anywhere that's passed through\". Then I realized that all our cells are passing in arrow functions that call to dispatch with their ID... \ud83e\udd14 . It turned out to be much more than the bound functions. Because the <NotebookApp /> had cellMap as a prop, literally any change to any cell was causing the whole tree to render because the root was. I'm looking forward to finishing this up in #2402, it's working really well now!. I think we can declare this one as iteratively improving, though it would be super neat if we measured performance on CI someday.. Closing for now since this is basically just me wanting to track stuff to see what I did previously.. Yes please!. Now that I've gotten used to Immutable.Records, I look forward to switching from Immutable.Map in all the places we have consistent keys.\n\n. Well now, I've got something to rectify for the NEW_KERNEL action. It currently requires the kernelspec and other bits for desktop, while the webbie version doesn't. Need to update the TODO with a plan.. I'll be closing this PR soon and making a new one with just the epic, since I've done a lot of the work in other PRs.. Now that I've been working with this, I think I'd like all the action types to be in the action creator files (actions.js), enforced as return arguments. Then the reducers will import the types from the actions file.. Hey this was finished!. This is some pretty interesting flow error stuff and is fairly illustrative of an issue some of our provider components have. Flow is erroring on props that are intended for the unconnected component which we pass via {...props}. Many of these have defaultProps which should make them not have issues.. If I switch ownProps to the exported CodeMirrorEditorProps, all the errors drop away. however, they're completely missing the actual props. Waaaaaait actually that is the solution. The ownProps are the ones intended for the raw component. Commit incoming!. Ruh roh, looks like Travis is stuck on the app builds.. \ud83c\udf89 . Since this is cosmetic / cleanup, I've made sure everything passes locally and that the apps work, I'm going to go ahead and merge this.. Yuck. That is not sounding good. I'll see if I can reproduce that with those steps.. This is the latest version of nteract too?. I've noticed locally that on master that if I run \"kill kernel\", messages are still coming in, so our cleanup isn't completely happening.. Nice, this also got rid of a $FlowFixMe since we're actually using the ownProps properly here.. Travis is currently in outage / backlog mode -- https://www.traviscistatus.com/incidents/c1s4dlyxd4lf\n. I'm going to err on the side of merging here since I've run tests and apps locally, as well as the fact that appveyor is passing.. This is done now.. \ud83e\udd14 Circle CI only builds specified branches (?). Ok I've fixed the circle ci config for this repo. Should be good to go for new PRs.. > Your tests passed on CircleCI!\nNoice.. Going ahead with closing this one since it's not a priority by any means, just a thing we could try out.. Now that we've got CircleCI (and damn do our builds finish faster now), I think it's ok for us to just disable Travis until they're back up.. I've marked Travis CI to be inactive within the GitHub integrations for now.. Oh my. So much to adapt with executionState.. Do you think I should switch all use of executionState to kernelStatus where components are using it?. > like the components are using the variable name executionState? If so, ya, we should switch to kernelStatus in this PR.\nYeah and as one of their props.. Kernel restarting is failing, I've got a bit more to fix up here.. Switching kernels is a-ok though.. Restarting kernels should definitely be an action + epic pair in the future -- right now it's hidden away in our menu as two subsequent actions killKernel and launchKernel.. Ooook, this is good to go.. Hope this works!. Flow typed now, though it could use better coverage.. Wow, that one went through some large refactors.. One thing that rx-jupyter doesn't do that it probably should -- if it's not passed the full URL for the endpoint it should construct the full URL (especially for the websockets) using location.origin and the baseURI. Another slight annoyance is the different names we have for some of the same bits:\n\nbaseUrl - our current jupyter extension base URI (e.g. /user/fvzhyd)\nserverUrl - what we've set up for host records\nserverConfig.endpoint || serverConfig.url same thing in rx-jupyter, which is used as the full base URL https://hub.example.org/user/fvzhyd yet can also function as the pure base path on a localhost server /user/fvzhyd but not in all cases (notably websockets)\n\nThoughts @theengineear? We mostly just need consistency among these while being able to straddle localhost (HTTP) and remote authenticated servers on HTTPS.. Notes from the jupyter notebook server as to why the jupyter extension used baseURL -- the server itself uses baseURL for that base URI.. > Is there any reason for us not to required that users of the lib just pass in the full URL, else we just bail in rx-jupyter?\nI think that's a good standard.. Rebased this one to stay up to date, going to town on finishing it off now.. The way I'm running this right now (since we don't have the contents API and SET_NOTEBOOK integrations setup) is firing off this action with the redux devtools:\njs\n{\n  type: 'LAUNCH_KERNEL_BY_NAME',\n  kernelSpecName: 'python3',\n  cwd: '/'\n}. :boom:. This now also sets the kernel into the app record. Execution works as does autocomplete. \ud83d\ude04 . \n. I'm not really sure why you're thinking the byRef objects would sometimes be non immutable JS objects wouldn't we just create the records when they're first created and then work with them as immutable objects from there on?. Going ahead and merging as this can be started to be out into place on all the root reducers for each app.. Ah, cool yeah. Since we have the flattened structures we can use well typed Records and Refs liberally.. Feature is only partially implemented, it always unconditionally asks if you've saved.. This was fixed in the 0.8.x series.. We had a regression in the last release that caused performance issues on notebooks, even on smaller sizes. We're looking to get a new release out soon.. Individual reducers are all immutable now. The only thing missing now is that our root level reducer still uses combineReducers.. > Should we have these types in a separate package? Or, should the core stuff be in core? What's the common convention?\nMy personal take on this is that the records should be in core. The @nteract/types package was created for us to unify a lot of the types that were being used all over the place where there's a general type (jupyter messages, notebook format bits, ...). I think it makes sense to actually move the records bits from @nteract/types to @nteract/core. The raw kernelspecs structure (as exists on disk) is probably wise inside of @nteract/types.. I'm going to go ahead and merge so you can keep on heading forward, though I'd love simpler names for EntitiesKernelspecsSpecProps, especially considering it exactly represents an actual kernelspec (of the jupyter sense).. We haven't taken much practice and care to it before, so I'm really happy to make it standardized so it's easy to read and understand all over the place.. I'm totally cool with the entire proposal as is, the \"hidden\" prefixes included and the matching action verb names.. > This sorta breaks down when you don't have a noun... fetchInterrupt\nFor the less REST-y ones like this maybe issueX makes more sense. They're more RPC than they are REST. issueKernelInterrupt, issueKillKernel. Do those seem sensible?. Yeah that sounds good. Those are the verbs. Silly me.. I'm a fan of the payload convention, it's just enough of a refactor that I haven't wanted to change things up just for the sake of doing it. There have definitely been some areas where it could have been easier to work with it.\nAt any rate, yeah I'm certainly open to payload envelopes.. Merged #2399, so you can rebase this.. > I've set up my own ways to mock out things like ajax and provide mock schedulers (so you can test things with debounceTime, etc), but I'm wondering how that's handled in here?\nIn https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/2391/files#diff-bf4f11387916efdb1656d04751fe4e5a, I created __mocks__ for rx-jupyter, only for @nteract/core. I only \"implemented\" kernels so you'll have to add on kernelspecs. I'd be cool with mocking ajax too, I figured that can be tested inside of rx-jupyter though.. Rockin', will do.. I would say that something which does the full setup should be part of a functional testing suite rather than part of our unit tests.. And then... if we really wanted to we could be doing integration tests backed by binder or a launched server. \ud83d\ude09 . No probs, rebases are my jam.. Alright! This should now pass and is ready for review!. Fixed up the tests, now to watch CI run. \ud83d\udc41 \ud83d\udc41 . I've viewed kernelspecs as the entire list of all the individual kernelspec. Technically, the spec is the actual kernel spec. However, the Jupyter Notebook API has an \"envelope\" around this that has the name and resources.. Hooray! I'm so glad this one is finished!. Thanks for tackling this!. \ud83e\udd14  I look forward to seeing how this one goes. . Got some tests to fix up here, it looks like they need adapting to the now proper behavior. \ud83d\ude04 . Woohoo! Now the kernel is kicked off when the notebook is loaded. \ud83d\ude04 . I'm confused as to why that's failing on Appveyor, I'm going to go ahead and merge it, clear the cache on appveyor and figure out the build setup.. Interesting, we need to make sure we keep our split of old Vega and new Vega here. I'll just close this so it stays as is. We will have to do manual renovate work for Vega.. Hey @rarkins is there a way to find out all the ignored updates for our project? Seems like renovate could tag these ones when it writes the ignore notification.. Can you post a notebook, that uses these kernels? I'd love to see what the kernel info metadata is that's stored in the notebook itself. This totally relates to the codemirror mode we're setting.. Ok, cool this helps. Thank you for the example notebook for us to test against!. This might be fixed on master now that we've adapted our codemirror language settings into one central spot. Hopefully we'll have a release out this week to test.. Something I've been thinking about, regarding how we handle execute_all -- we could \"lock the cell UI\" when waiting for execute all to finish (or error), which could either be just graying it out or literally preventing edits while it's in process. Something to think about for coordinating with the epics some day in the future.. To make the above a little easier to triage what's done and where we're at I'm going to type the above up as a TODO list.. After #2448 is merged, I'm going to move the menu order to match the above:\nFile  |  Edit  |  View  |  Cell  |  Runtime  |  Help. I've just checked off a few here, and there are few that are trivial now because the actions and epics have been implemented (or they're a short distance away):\n\nClear All Outputs\nKill\nRestart\nRestart and Clear All Outputs\n. > If notebooks are quite large (which i imagine they could be), it'd be cool to flesh this out and alternatively stream the notebook to disk if we hit a limit on the blob size. \nChrome's blobs cap out at 500MiB according to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28307789/is-there-any-limitation-on-javascript-max-blob-size. Any concern there?\n\n\n\nIf they get that big, the notebook is way too big. Most notebooks are < 5 MB, some large plots put them ~25 MB, and I've seen some astrophysics notebooks that are ~100 MB. There is a /files/ endpoint that you can stream the files from that this usually uses, so I'd use the size as a heuristic for choosing whether to serve it in-memory or via the server.\n\nAlso, @rgbkrk (+ all nteract folks) thanks for having a repo with nice surface area to write tests in. It's been a breeze so far.\n\nWoo!\n. We used to have a moduleNameMapper in our top level jest config that locked the uuid that was used, I wonder if that has to be brought back.. This is what it used to be: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/2285/files#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2L70. One little comment you can address in a follow up PR. Thanks for kicking the File menu off!. Woo, initial cleanup / refactor done. Now for the web based epic!. Oh hey I just fixed our whole \"Are you sure you want to exit before saving\" issue. The state was being changed on save and was set as the savedNotebook, which would never be equal to the current state.  \ud83c\udf89  It's working properly now! Hurrah! \ud83c\udf8a\n/cc @lgeiger . This is worth a look over @theengineear! I'm finding the not-closing-after-click behavior of the menu rather odd. Is that configurable?. Super ready for review. I've grouped the commits in a way that you could review them individually, however it's fine to review in whole.. Cleaned up a bunch of inline TODOs that I addressed in other commits as part of this PR.. > Also... Why did you change the title from Here I come to save the notebook!? That was great!\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nI at least kept the branch name.\n. Ok, this is all set, at least for the bits we weren't going to punt on.. Thanks for reporting, we'll take a look at this as part of our current sprint.. Nice, that means another issue closed for this milestone. \ud83d\ude04 . Here's how the classic notebook does it:\n\nUser clicks New \u02c5\nA GET for each of Contents (on /), Sessions, and Terminals is done\nThe Contents one is notable here because the new notebook is created to be a one-up from the last Untitled${number}.ipynb\nA POST to /api/contents/Untitled${number}.ipynb is performed with payload:\n\njs\n{ \"type\": \"notebook\" }\n\nNote: :warning: possible race condition possible between when the directory listing is performed and when this new notebook is created. This is probably more likely with multiple notebook servers running at the same location (NFS, EFS backed)\nThe user is redirected to /notebooks/Untitled${number}.ipynb\nPOST to /api/sessions with:\n\njs\n{\n  path: `Untitled4.ipynb`,\n  type: \"notebook\",\n  name: \"\",\n  kernel: {\n    id: null,\n    name: \"python3\"\n  }\n}\n\nServer responds with the created session and kernel:\n\n{\n  id: \"35aeee00-79f9-43ad-b674-20618d91adf5\",\n  path: \"Untitled4.ipynb\",\n  name: \"\",\n  type: \"notebook\",\n  kernel: {\n    id: \"816af886-ede7-47bd-bc93-6cdcfe7fedd2\",\n    name: \"python3\",\n    last_activity: \"2018-02-14T21:34:49.945834Z\",\n    execution_state: \"starting\",\n    connections: 0\n  },\n  notebook: { path: \"Untitled4.ipynb\", name: \"\" }\n}\n\nChannels are connected to, noting that the session_id is not the same as the session's id .____.\nContents are fetched\n\nSome of the above can be looked up and provided in the initial state of the document in our jupyterConfigData bundle for us.. Well I had the above wrong. You POST to /api/contents with only the base directory. The server does the work of creating a new Untitled.ipynb.. Yeah you shouldn't have to change anything for rx-jupyter's contents module. The epic is just notebook specific at the moment.. > Is it possible to make a request for just the metadata about a file? I.e.,\nnot get the whole file?\nYes! A GET on the contents API allows additional parameters: http://jupyter-api.surge.sh/#!/contents/get_contents_path\n?content=0 will return only the metadata. Which I think with rx-jupyter's contents API you'd write:\ncontents.get(serverConfig, path, { content: 0 })\nWe should/could normalize that in rx-jupyter to convert true / false to 1 and 0 respectively, hiding the quirk.. > I plan to make a new Directory component inside /core, though I think we may want to refactor that later if /core ends up too bloated.\nYeah that's totally fine. Commuter would end up using it anyways.. Piling on to this issue, since you're setting up other handlers we'll want a path for creating new notebooks. Classic notebook does it like this:\nhttp://localhost:8888/notebooks/Untitled.ipynb?kernel_name=python2. Closed by #2680. I'll open new issues for some of the current pitfalls / needs.. When the kernel is starting, we need to show:\n\nwhen the kernel is being launched\nany other states. That whole kernel lifecycle is better tracked now, as are the logs. I'll make new issues for milestone 2.\n\nFor our serverextension, we should support a /api/kernels/{kernelId}/logs endpoint that we'll fallback to nothing if it 404s.. Nice! I have yet to use React.createPortal so I look forward to learning from this PR.. Since our bundled styles may need an upgrade and this is the first time I'm doing it, I'll document how I'm going about it.\n\ngit clone https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror\ncd CodeMirror\ngit diff 5.33.0 5.34.0 -- lib/codemirror.css (nothing for this one)\ngit diff 5.33.0 5.34.0 -- ./addon/hint/show-hint.css (nothing for this one)\n\nLooks like we're good for this round. Another manual way is using the compare UI in GitHub: https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/compare/5.33.0...5.34.0. I think since we have multiple uses for modals, we should probably outline the differences and some of the expected user experiences.\nOur editor has two different kinds of modals, both of which get triggered by codemirror outside of the React flow and are rendered using their cursor stuff. Those two are:\n\nCompletion (typeahead, ctrl-space completion)\nIntrospection (the tooltips as in #2443)\n\nThose two modals can technically be up more than once. Ideally though we'd only have one at a time. The completion one does follow the cursor, so we do want to stay hooked in to codemirror for it.\nNow, other modals we likely need including the mentioned about menu:\n\nabout menu (desktop gets to cheat for this one)'\nmetadata editing (unless we do it inline, kind of like a \"drawer\" for the cell)\n\nThat's all I can think of. Guess I'll look into these options so I can journey with you all. \ud83d\ude04 . We won't support nbextensions so that one is not a worry.. I was kind of thinking that kernel logs could be in a drawer too, pulling up from the bottom (in play style, reversed).. Definitely still want to carve this one out for our own sanity.. > Had I gone with the longer approach of creating an actionType/action/reducer/ControllerComponent setup, we could really have this in isolation.\nThat's totally fine if you want to do that.. Oh hey that's even better since the linter prompted better a11y conformance. :smile:. P.S. I have watched a lot of The Crown in the last few months, so I was torn between posting a picture of the Churchill and John Lithgow's Churchill. \ud83d\ude09 . Rebased this to bring in the About Menu (and deal with the resulting merge conflict).. Darn that react-virtualized bug I noticed last night while working on #2350 is coming to bite things here.. https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/issues/993. Rebased to take in the react-virtualized pinning.. Addressed all the feedback, this is ready to go!. No one saw those last commits right? Noooooow this is good to go. \ud83d\ude38 . You'll need to rebase since I merged the other PRs (?).\nSome comments that I put in chat (that should have been here in the PR):\n\nI think you'd have to tear our the key handling from the markdown preview component. That needs to be done anyways so that keybindings are top level. I think you'd be able to use mousetrap then.. Ok cool, taking a look now.. Something we should probably look into for our own ANSI coloring (ours comes via anser): https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3773\n\nI really love the soft palette that the classic notebook has currently:\n\nvs. our current style:\n\nThose probably do have to be part of our theme setup, though I think are out of scope for this PR.. At least for Circle CI, it looks like you need to update the snapshots.\nFor your local copy, you may need to do a git clean -xfd && npm i because I upgraded lerna.. The current CI error is not your fault (at least, not necessarily), it's due to the old uglify in the next.js apps. It usually happens when a dependency is not transpiled.. Woo fixed!. OMG the Pager! I personally have just been running the cell again to clear that out.\nLuckily that's not stored in the notebook. Would you want to just collapse it or full on delete it?. I edited my comment so hopefully that shows up now, I delayed a bit in fixing what I wrote.\nBasically, the R docs are coming through something separate from outputs even though we put them in the output area. We could actually convert them to an output, store them in the notebook, and if you clear or collapse them they'd be handled like normal outputs.. This will end up in the next desktop release (likely this weekend).. I'm going to err on the side of \ud83d\udc4c  here and keep hacking away.. I'm going to err on the side of \ud83d\udc4c  here and keep hacking away.. This PR was insane and all too necessary.. I'm going to tackle unload tomorrow.. Reference of another app that did a workaround for app closing: https://github.com/xodio/xod/pull/838. We had an extra slash in our tests, I'll fix the tests for this.. Running the dist takes ~5 minutes, so we could add it to the build. For now, I won't stress that.. Odd. I'll give that try to reproduce, there may be logs in the dev tools for this View -> Toggle Developer Tools.. Also: I've only done limited testing to make sure that the changes I made to appease flow didn't break things. I'll come back to this PR to double check.. Lookin' good, erring on the side of getting this out so I can continue refactors of the main process with some sense of sanity.. Oh my gosh! Yay! Maybe now we can do away with worries about the uglify-es setup. \ud83c\udf89 . This spares me from upgrading to the next.js canaries, so I'm going to merge this in and say \ud83c\udf89  \ud83c\udf8a  woohoo \ud83c\udf8a \ud83c\udf89 . In the latest 0.7.0 release (literally released 7 minutes ago), this should show up well. How's this:\n\n. Done in #2715 . Rock in'!. Interesting! Luckily it's a failure to cleanup the old kernel during a restart, so that's probably why it seems to work afterward. Super helpful to see these messages, thank you!\n/cc @theengineear. Finished this in #2614 and #2602.. Weird. Do we need underlying upgrades to zeromq in our code base / jmp then? I was getting module version mismatches.. So happy to say we good now. \ud83d\ude04 . \ud83d\ude47  Thank you so much!. > removes the body margin so that the menu extends across the whole page\nHurrah! \ud83c\udf89 \n\nremoves box-shadow from the menu (I don't think it's super helpful)\nremoves radius from menu items (i think the blockier style looks better)\n\nTotally agree, good choices.. Ruh roh, I think I've unraveled some major typing issues. I'm going to make a new approach that doesn't move core records for a moment.. Closing in favor of #2516 and other refinements.. Awesome! Thanks for pulling this through @tlyon3 and @mpacer for reviewing!. > naming: holy getCurrent*, batman! It's a little wordy! Maybe current should be the default thing we assume to be getting when we're using selectors.\ncurrent* is way better than getCurrent*, especially since every selector is a get*.. Separately, we should extract getCodeMirrorMode out as a selector too: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/packages/core/src/providers/notebook-app.js#L295. We'll probably want to switch a lot of our mapStateToProps to using these as well.. Since I'm in the midst of other fixes, I think I'll also fix the other types while I'm at it in this PR.\nEdit: not the records though. Snippet from release logs:\nnteract:   \u2022 uploading       file=nteract-0.7.0-x86_64.AppImage provider=GitHub\nnteract:   \u2022 GitHub release not created reason=existing type not compatible with publishing type tag=v0.7.0 version=0.7.0 existingType=release publishingType=draft\nnteract:   \u2022 skipped publishing file=nteract-0.7.0-x86_64.AppImage reason=existing type not compatible with publishing type tag=v0.7.0 version=0.7.0 existingType=release publishingType=draft. and of course that's because I tried to manually publish without bumping the version.... Yeah I think that's perfect, I don't really know any alternatives.. That is, other than figuring out some way that we'd do it through our state tree similar to modals. I think this is wayyyy less complicated though. I'll assume this works well and just merge it on in.. I've definitely noticed this one. I think it would be far easier for us to tear out the sticky cells and come back to them as a separate feature someday -- docked (and mirrored) output or something similar.. From https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/2507#discussion_r167042929:\nYes! We ran an informal poll on twitter in October of 2017.\n\nDo you use \"pin cell\" in nteract desktop?\n|  # | % | Choice | \n|---|---|------|\n| 5 | 26.3% | Never, it's so not for me  |\n| 5 | 26.3% | Once for funsies |\n| 7 | 36.8% | Hardly ever |\n| 2 | 10.5% | All the time, it's my jam |\n19 respondents\n\nI'm willing to say, based on those results, that it would be ok to remove it in favor of maintainability. We can always keep the component + styling in core, just rip it out of the standalone notebook app.. Thank you!. Ah, we started passing the whole thing to MathJax to typeset within our LaTeX transform. Looks like we need to do parsing here or a MathJax setup that will only look for the right elements. I'll dive into this.. I'd certainly prefer assuming it was fully valid LaTeX with a _repr_latex_, though I'd have to assume we'd have no support for stylesheets, no having to use \\begin{article}, etc.. /cc @tlyon3 . We'd like to conform to the same specification for both, the implementation just released was an oversight that I'd like to fix soon. We improved our Markdown rendering and took a step backward for LaTeX outputs. In #2510 I'm using qutip's outputs for regression testing, and I'll incorporate it in a test suite.. I'll be knocking each and every one of these anti-patterns in menu out and making them reusable across all apps. \ud83c\udf89 . I seem to have found a case for a selector that will have a specific implementation in desktop and the webapp version -- cwd (current working directory). I'm going to see how I can factor out the current way it works in a stable way. I'm starting with making the kernel keep track of its cwd. The reason I need this is to make a everything available that is needed for a kernel restart without having to write two separate epics.. Sorting by display name would be cool.. There's too ways about it -- either the payload is an Error with extra properties on it or the payload has both the error and all other data we want to keep. Doesn't matter to me, just as long as if it's the payload option that we go ahead and standardize it and update the error middleware (which I think is only on desktop, though it should be in core).. > Still plugging away at this. It sure does touch a lot of code \nIf you find smaller PRs or things that could be done separately, let me know. I'm happy to help. \ud83d\ude04 . This became smaller PRs so I'm going to close it.. Thanks for reporting this, which is a duplicate of https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/2458 (though hard to tell they're the same issue).\nWe store those messages separate from the outputs (structure wise), yet they look like outputs to the user. I'm going to switch them to become an actual output so they're clearable and end up in the document if saved (which would also match the actual input, so I think it's a good fit).. Thanks. Yet another reminder I should switch us off of now.sh. \ud83d\ude1e . Ok I've made a fresh deployment and switched it to default scale to two nodes and never go to sleep. I'll do the same for play.nteract.io as well.. Closing in favor of #2525. Yeah it's pretty confusing. Users shouldn't have to understand and this data has never been stored in the document previously. We (nteract) interwove the help doc and the output to make them colocated with the cell they were requested from. Jupyter made it a little popup drawer that came up from the bottom (and there could only be one).. It's too bad that flow doesn't recognize that the function passed to catchError must return an observable. I'm going to update the flow definition.. Hmmmm... Looks like catchError is any currently.. Welp, it looks like all operators are currently untyped. \ud83d\ude2d  Of course, I've already reported this (and made some PRs): https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed/issues/1688\n/cc @jayphelps. Gawrsh node.. Closing in favor of #2541 . You're right, I should put in the specs for this. \ud83d\ude04 . (Another PR coming soon). Extra note as to why I moved the fs mock from desktop:\njest-haste-map: duplicate manual mock found:\n  Module name: fs\n  Duplicate Mock path: /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract-ext/packages/fs-observable/__mocks__/fs.js\nThis warning is caused by two manual mock files with the same file name.\nJest will use the mock file found in:\n/Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract-ext/packages/fs-observable/__mocks__/fs.js\n Please delete one of the following two files:\n /Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract-ext/applications/desktop/__mocks__/fs.js\n/Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract-ext/packages/fs-observable/__mocks__/fs.js\nBecause we use a global jest configuration, all mocks go together. We could/should put the mocks at the top level of the monorepo then. For now, this is alright since we (currently) only test against fs-observable usages.. All set!. Woo, I fixed the tests! On to addressing feedback.. Last up is tests and then I'm ready for review.. Upgraded flow!\nJust a note -- I had to kill off all previously running flow servers before I could get this running. Ended up restarting my machine.. Thanks for pointing that out. We use now.sh for the sites. I wonder if the root domain needs a different configuration:\n```\n$ now dns ls\n\n16 records found [0ms] under nteract\n\nnteract.io\n                              id  name                                   type   value                                                   aux  created\n    rec_1e306fdc3ead06ca39e70ef4  *                                      CNAME  alias.zeit.co.                                               113d ago\n    rec_56bcea48688828a08e486f9b  31385febe65945ddc99261e89bfe5d50.blog  CNAME  38db503421fe6f59e01615bf4d56714c14228649.comodoca.com.       113d ago\n    rec_f1f1feda028d7d4520ed0a10  blog                                   A      52.0.16.118                                                  113d ago\n    rec_4c5ffd2284666ef7c49b8d91  blog                                   A      52.1.119.170                                                 113d ago\n    rec_4d9c2648d05ecd85006ca41f  blog                                   A      52.1.147.205                                                 113d ago\n    rec_bc247050e0d7414ce1584ec2  blog                                   A      52.1.173.203                                                 113d ago\n    rec_eafeb3580b9adbe328bbcbae  blog                                   A      52.4.145.119                                                 113d ago\n    rec_745f14d260d45702080bd07d  blog                                   A      52.4.175.111                                                 113d ago\n    rec_e1f19e99b0e6e4048f1c3e42  blog                                   A      52.4.225.124                                                 113d ago\n    rec_1188e8f59de647aefe6d59ba  blog                                   A      52.4.240.221                                                 113d ago\n    rec_10da15e596ec8a31fcbcbee9  blog                                   A      52.4.38.70                                                   113d ago\n    rec_182302ac302f57ce3982ff40  blog                                   A      52.5.181.79                                                  113d ago\n    rec_854e15e47ece81acc37e6ba0  blog                                   A      52.6.3.192                                                   113d ago\n    rec_7f433e0d836a24b14a060320  blog                                   A      52.6.46.142                                                  113d ago\n    rec_f853a0789e4866b59e2e004b                                         ALIAS  alias.zeit.co.                                               113d ago\n    rec_0e40b83c3bc7b2861adfc818                                         CAA    0 issue \"letsencrypt.org\"                                    106d ago\n$ nslookup nteract.io\nServer:     2001:558:feed::1\nAddress:    2001:558:feed::1#53\nNon-authoritative answer:\nName:   nteract.io\nAddress: 52.8.142.115\nName:   nteract.io\nAddress: 52.52.224.46\n$ nslookup *.nteract.io\nServer:     2001:558:feed::1\nAddress:    2001:558:feed::1#53\nNon-authoritative answer:\n*.nteract.io    canonical name = alias.zeit.co.\nName:   alias.zeit.co\nAddress: 52.52.224.46\nName:   alias.zeit.co\nAddress: 52.8.142.115\n```\n/cc @rauchg. Oooh that's an easy fix!. All set, and www.nteract.io points to the same server as nteract.io. > As far as --theme-scale-idx-[index], i think we should likely give ourselves wiggle room to have a multiple scales, right? I.e., we might want to call it --theme-scale-category10-1. Right?\nTo give ourselves room for a 10 color palette and a 20 color palette?\nMaybe what we do, on the theme side, is make this specific to the intent. --theme-completion-idx-1 or if the completion types are truly known --theme-completion-function-color. Then it's all just based on the naming instead of indices (even though they're index based underneath).. > Also, these will change with light/dark theme ya? We'll have to be pretty careful about these if we're going to be changing colors in a chart based on theming... That might get confusing fast.\nHopefully not confusing in the sense that it would stay consistent for the given theme. People shouldn't toggle between and expect them to stay the same (I think).. > Yah, naming the themes is what I'm getting at for sure. If you want, you can do --theme-category10-[index] and then alias it to --theme-completion-[index] as well. But either way, let's sneak another piece of context in there as you're suggesting :+1:.\nI'm assuming here too, category10 just means \"a category with a 10 color range\" rather than vega's literal \"category10\" (which is the one we're using here).. Tabling this for later.. The benefit of these aliases is that you don't have to rebuild those packages to see updates in the jupyter extension UI. The benefit of a library approach to it is that we'd maintain the webpack aliases in one location.. Whoops! Yeah I upgraded recently.\nLuckily I've got an automated setup for this that I'll post as a PR soon.. Tests: \u2705 \nFlow: \u2705 \nBuilding next.js apps: \u2705 \nBuilding Desktop: \u274c . Happy to report that play does live reload \ud83d\udc4c \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 \ud83d\udc8b . Well, all except for the fact that it seems to re-invoke the binder server on live reload when we could just work with the connected server.. Notes on things to cleanup --\n@nteract/showcase: [BABEL] Note: The code generator has deoptimised the styling of \"/Users/kylek/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract-ext/node_modules/@nteract/plotly/plotly.min.js\" as it exceeds the max of \"500KB\".\nYet again I am wanting to rip plotly out to a separately included script.... I need to make this babel-loader setup skip @nteract/plotly... It's currently making the build fail.. Now to figure out what's going on with the json loader:\nlerna ERR!     ERROR in ./node_modules/github/lib/definitions.json\nlerna ERR!

Oh I bet the JSON issue comes from when the package.json is loaded for grabbing the version. I don't know what's up with that. Only affecting the desktop build at the moment..

Tests: \u2705 \nFlow: \u2705 \nBuilding next.js apps: \u2705 \nBuilding Desktop: \u2705 . Now I'm going to evaluate how the desktop dist does as well as commuter.. Dist: \u2705\nThis was working much earlier than the last few commits, I couldn't help myself in cleaning up more of the old webpack config tonight. \ud83d\ude04 . I think this is in a good-to-go state and is very ready for review. I'm going to do another once-over to make sure all is well with fully built production apps.. Oook... It looks like commuter in dev mode is just fine. In prod mode though, it seems like some styles aren't propagating through properly with styled-jsx.\nDev:\n\nProd:\n\n. It looks like I didn't bring the next.js config in, so I'll see what's going on there (and I suppose I'll need to do the same with checking on the prod setup of play, etc.). New error! It's the classic \"some dependency is locking in your version of util and inherits\"\n\nand thereby breaking webpack (client side).\nRelated issues for tracking purpose:\n\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/1019\n\nhttps://github.com/webpack/node-libs-browser/issues/59. Current failures with my util switcheroo:\n\n\nbrowserify-zlib. I think my follow up to this PR will be creating a simpler @nteract/webpack-config that has the aliases first, then we can follow on with more complex stuff. \ud83d\ude04 . Now that most of the good bits from here have been merged in separate PRs, I can close this.\n\n\nSadly next.js is not on the next version of webpack yet so I can't hook those up. The jupyter extension is good to go with the latest bits though in #2599.. Thanks! This is a duplicate of https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/1116. While we know about it no one is working on it or has plans to, though it's deemed possible by the lead author / maintainer of CodeMirror (the editor we use underneath).. Don't merge this until we check on the styles! \ud83d\ude04 . No CSS changes from this release, we're good to go!. Verified this is good to go across the apps, in dev and prod.. Yeah, you'd have to trust that I matched up the numbers from the other packages inside the repo (which is how I figured out these were out of sync).. Perfect!. Rebased this against master, still more to go.. This will definitely be rebased.... Stopping this one without doing selectors. I'll do a separate PR for that ball of wax.. The font looks distinctly different to me:\n\nHowever, it looks like Python treats these as the same character:\n\nIt's the same behavior for me in both Jupyter and nteract. What happens in your version of Jupyter and IPython (+ Python)?. I'm going to go ahead and merge this so I can charge ahead with rebasing.. I'm fine with agreeing on the root metadata key (or even rootName). Originally @gnestor forked the json transform package from here for JupyterLab, so it's roughly the same implementation.. Running this locally:\n\n[x] Desktop\n[x] Jupyter extension\n. Looking great! Thanks!. Oh interesting. Thanks for reporting. I don't know what's reading from stdin.. I'm sure we can figure it out together.\n\nCuriosity -- what's your plugin for?. Thanks for the quick review! I changed the dispatch props as requested, I don't have time (right now that is) to update comments for the other ones. Feel free to add new commits to this one or new PRs, I'll be gone for ~6 hours.. Thank you! Extra thank you for the detailed description.\nThe cloud download icon gets used by the commuter front end package (or at least is supposed to) for downloading notebooks. The beaker is not used in an interactive way, though it does get used in the data resource transform package. Between the time I wrote that issue and now quite a bit changed. We might want to just pass title as a prop and set the intent in the apps in the future.. Welcome to nteract, happy to have you!. Wahoo, all is passing and working! I'll rebase this first though.. The current built in node.js runtime is ijavascript which operates in a similar fashion to node scripts -- it resolves based on local node_modules. You have to npm install dependencies \"next to\" your notebook files.. Can you try to run open HelloWorldNodeNteract.ipynb, seeing if it works in a fresh session? It would be good to print out what the current working directory is too. Is this with the built in node kernel or a separately installed one?. I'll check the master branch issue out, thanks for sorting these @jkornblum . Thanks! I'll also get this updated with the webpack 4 upgrade. \ud83d\ude04 . All these old prefixes will make me super ready for the next stage.. Thanks for making this issue and leaving comments for it to make it really easy to do a clean sweep + close this issue. \ud83d\ude47 . You do have to install R and Python locally (as well as their kernels) in order to use those languages with nteract.\nThanks for using it for teaching others programming. Please also contribute to https://github.com/nteract/education to help all educators with tooling and curriculum. \ud83d\ude04 . I'm going to assume this is \ud83d\udc4c , and I'm merging it in to keep going.. > Yah, this was honestly just because I was not really trusting flow at the time and didn't want to make more waves than necessary. We should be able to sync them though in the follow up.\nWorks for me, I'm happy to keep this all moving forward.. Everything passes and yet I broke desktop. \ud83d\ude05 . Found it and fixed it all!. Ok, new notebook is a-ok. Switching kernels needs a fix. I think it all comes down to when the kernelRef gets set.. :boom: desktop is working and refs are in place!. Since I've rebased, tests are passing, and so is flow it's time for me to exercise the notebook really well again and I'm eager for a review. \ud83d\ude04 . Back to work in progress, I'm going to get the kernel out of the app record.. Allllllright! AppRecord no longer has kernel gunk. We are fully on kernel refs. No looking back now!\n. Oh I just noticed Runtime -> Kill doesn't work in the desktop menu... Lemme fix that.. In that last commit I corrected the selector for modalType since modals are in entities now.. Loving this.. I'll rebase my branch against this.. Now for me to actually review. \ud83d\ude04 . Looking good. This seems like a reasonable transition point.. I'm going to err on the side of A-OK here and merge this since it's really minor.. \n. A walkthrough on how to use showcase to prototype (it's next.js underneath with our custom webpack setup) or how I literally built this component?. > Sort of\u2026 both? I was thinking that this would be a good example of a component that I wouldn't have had a good idea of how to properly prototype inside showcase.\nYeah that's simple enough to kick off. I'll add on to showcase's README.\n\nI had thought of showcase as a way to display the notebook components in a standard structure \u2014 it makes sense for it to be used more generally, I just hadn't thought about that in that way.\n\nThe entire purpose of showcase is to display and develop on small UI components, similar to storybook.\n\nIn any case, even if it's not this component exactly a complete walkthrough of how you prototyped an entire actual component (i.e., not a toy example but a component that was actually built for use in the nteract repository) would be super helpful.\n\nAt some point, I could imagine live streaming something like this. I don't know how I'd put together a decent tutorial on this because most of it is:\n\nMock a design (inspired by Google docs template selection)\nMake boxes with divs, color them various grays\nSearch the web for each of these (in order, from my actual search history):\nflex row (Oooh, I want to line these up)\nflex row scroll (Oh, I just want only these notebooks to scroll when page is small)\nflex space between items (I want some space between them)\nonly scroll div, not page (Why is the entire page scrolling while scrolling these little notebook icons)\nno overscroll chrome (how do you get rid of that annoying bounce?)\nmargin width and scrolling (ok, I think it might be the margins)\nvw css (I wonder if I should size according to view width)\npadding overflow (ok, maybe it's padding)\nNote: It was totally the padding making the \"width\" of the notebook selection area bigger than 100%\nAmong each of those terms, I was iterating to make the design I wanted\n\nAs with all learning and exploration, there's a wide amount of knowledge of CSS that I both don't have and do have. There's also a lot of content out there on how to build particular site experiences. My favorite of the sites I found on the journey above was https://iamsteve.me/blog/entry/using-flexbox-for-horizontal-scrolling-navigation (and as always, both MDN and CSS Tricks https://css-tricks.com/fun-viewport-units/).. Turned this into a proper component into core, now to see if I can make each of these notebooks <button />s while retaining the style I was aiming for.. Now they're buttons and I'm pretty happy for the moment. \ud83d\ude04 . Trying something a little fun on hover and focus:\n\n. I think I should switch this from a <button /> to an <a /> so that it's ctrl/cmd-clickable to allow the user to open in new tab and to eliminate weirdness around button focus for an element like this. \ud83e\udd14 . Whoops, just noticed I alternated the order of yellow and blue for the Python logo. Here it is fixed:\n\n. > We might want to flesh out how this stuff will change under a dark theme, but we can fuss with that down the road.\nYeah, that would be good to do. I aimed for matching my original mockup for better or worse, relying on the palette but not the theme due to not having everything available. Rather than get stuck in analysis paralysis, I went with getting this up as a prototype (albeit with tests and examples \ud83d\ude04 ). Thanks for merging it as it is!. We could always merge these part way ones, especially since you're doing a lot of moving things into payload objects.. Cool, let's move this forward.. This will probably fail and if it doesn't, it certainly will on npm run dist.. Actually... This appears to be working... \ud83d\udc4d \n\n[x] npm run start\n[x] npm run dist && open applications/desktop/dist/mac/nteract.app\n\n\ud83d\ude0d . Howdy! There's also a jupyter extension in the works, it's not ready for wide consumption yet. We'll be pushing out a new (alpha) release tomorrow as well as a wider beta in the coming weeks. You can try an old version out on binder via the example notebook(s) here: https://github.com/nteract/vdom/tree/master/example-notebooks#example-notebooks\nLet me know if you'd like to contribute, I'm happy to facilitate others to join our team. \ud83d\ude04 . We've released a beta of the jupyter extension and are about to come out with another release of the beta super soon!. I think I was matching what next.js was using so I'll just close this for now.. Same as #2636, I matched next.js here.. /cc @yuvipanda @mpacer and @theengineear for reviews. Whoever merges it has made master work for play. \ud83d\ude09 . Oops, this broke master.. \n. Uh oh, I might have gotten myself into a pickle with that electron upgrade. The dist copy works fine, the dev copy does not. The NODE_MODULE_VERSIONs mismatch even though the ABI really is the same (all are node 8 here).. ### UI features\n\nKernels now sorted by display name in the menu (#2591)\nImprove messaging about kernel state (#2628, #2495)\nLog \"extra\" stdout / stderr streams from kernel to chrome console (#2646)\nTheme aware title bar in the webapp (#2551, #2547, #2545)\nClear pager on output clear (#2525)\nAlways create block math if $$ occurs in markdown (#2499)\nNew Menu Items (webapp):\nHalt Kernel (#2529)\nRestart Kernel (#2528, #2512)\nUnhide and Clear All Outputs (#2517, #2520, #2512)\nExecute All (#2518, #2519)\nImproved menu look (webapp) (#2494)\n\nStability\n\nEditor now tracks subscriptions and closes them (#2505)\n\nAccessibilty\n\nAll octicon SVGs now have a <title> tag to describe their intent (#2587)\n\nNew components\n\nNotebook selection menu (#2623)\nNote: not integrated in any app yet\n\n\nBig repo changes\n\nNo more @nteract/types module\n@nteract/commuter-frontend has moved into @nteract/commuter directly to simplify publishing releases (#2634)\n\nDeveloper Experience\n\nElectron is upgraded to 1.8.3 (#2632)\nAddressed (almost all) flow type misconfigurations -- you're more likely to have a safe and sane setup (#2563, #2570, #2571, #2572, #2573, #2581, #2583, #2584, #2588, #2594, #2595, #2600, #2605, #2607, #2606, #2609, #2611, #2612, #2613, #2621, #2539, #2529, #2515, #2507, #2501)\nRefactored core into a new \"core state\" that switches us to a byRef structure and relies heavily on selectors to get state (#2592, #2601, #2603, #2605, #2602, #2614, #2619, #2616, #2620, #2626, #2642, #2541, #2522, #2514, #2511, #2500, #2490, #2493)\nExtract core components into pure and connected (#2578)\nWebpack configurations are more unified across all apps using the nteract webpack configurator (#2593, #2597, #2599, #2627, #2622)\nHooked up showcase with new monorepo-aware webpack setup (#2622)\n. Probably a more practical example, using pyspark since it launches a JVM process underneath:\n\n\nI look forward to when we have a little kernel logs drawer instead. \ud83d\ude04 . To make it easier to discern the kernels and to not have all these kind of useless collapsers (since you can't bring it all together from separate logging \"sessions\"), I switched to logging with colors and alternating colors if you restart or launch a new kernel:\n\n.

The super bad thing about --ignore is that it doesn't just skip publishing -- it also skips bumping up the version numbers. \ud83d\ude20 . The desktop app itself doesn't actually need to be published to npm, but we do want to bump the version and run our publish command (that runs the electron builder flow). Something needs to change with our setup.. Time to run through those verification steps again... \ud83d\ude02 . I've changed nteract desktop to a private package in its package.json to make this simpler, and I'll be running the shipping steps for desktop separately now.. No more nteract desktop publishing breaking the publishing of the monorepo! It's now a separate step to ease our pain.\nlerna run publish # version numbers bump here\nlerna run ship --scope nteract --stream # try to really ship the desktop app. I'm really curious if things pass after this, it was a bit odd to have master locally failing. \ud83e\udd14 . Not sure what's up with my local copy here. \n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nClosing.. Ah, I see. create-react-app won't allow template literals. It's bombing on:\nmodule.exports = `\n:root {. We'll have to change our babel configuration to make sure template literals are transpiled.. In the next release of create-react-app it looks like they'll transpile dependencies, based on https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/3776 being on their next branch since January (it's not on master, so not shipped). . Ok, so our babel config would create the right output. The issue is that this file in particular is generated javascript:\n// Generate themeable css. Overwrite the whole file for the first write.\nfs.writeFileSync(\n  CSS_PATH,\n  \"// This file is auto-generated. See buildStyles.js for details.\\n\\n\"\n);\nfs.appendFileSync(CSS_PATH, \"module.exports = `\\n:root {\\n\");\nlodash.toPairs(declarations).forEach(([cssProperty, cssValue]) => {\n  fs.appendFileSync(CSS_PATH, `  ${cssProperty}: ${cssValue};\\n`);\n});\nfs.appendFileSync(CSS_PATH, \"}\\n`;\\n\");\nInstead we have to create one long string there instead of using a `.. Closed as of #2674.. Fixed tests and some of the review feedback. I'll touch this again in the morning. Thanks for the review @theengineear!. Tearing out that top level document reducer now!. Ready!. \n. Note for users who stumble upon this -- we'd love to support this kind of feature with some rethinking on how it's implemented. More than once it's been a stumbling block to maintaining the overall app. \ud83d\ude47  Thank you.. Very happy to have menu closing after clicking entries.\nWhat happens if you click on one of the sub menus -- like change cell type. Does it close those when they should remain open?. Ok sweet.. /cc @jarmokivekas @chendaniely @lgeiger . Ah! Maybe I should change the site to just link to the page for the installers. If I was on Ubuntu or Debian I'd just use .deb. I think I took someone's recommendation of the AppImage and just went from there.. Definitely something we'll be fixing in a later release. We made some changes that helped us with maintenance that likely led to performance regressions. Can you post a notebook for me to try out? (or even likely code you'd run). Master:\n\nThis branch:\n\n. I've also got an alternate way of doing this, but what I might do is just switch commuter to using codemirror so it matches exactly. I'll leave the core module for highlighting to be without codemirror as requested by @tlyon3 originally.. Great, all the apps are failing because of vega's use of util. \ud83d\ude2d . I'm going to aim at merging this and fixing the build for master in another PR.. This is ready to review! I'm going to do a self-review now.. > Awesome. I left some comments, but I'd rather merge this now and you can take a look and decide if things need updating in a subsequent PR. Nice work!\nThank you!. I've switched this up to use babel to do the transpile for lib so we can look at the full output in build.. Is that \\begin{align} inside of a $$ block too (not that it should)? I think we'd need the markdown package to also treat those as latex sections if that's the expectation.\nJust like how you added a way to keep the block mode as is. We'd have to extend the markdown parser to detect \\begin etc. and send to mathjax. What's the expectation for this text in the classic jupyter notebook?\n\n. cc @mpacer . Awesome. I love Gatsby!\n@tlyon3 has a PR that handles the environment rendering differently -- #2691. Could you check it out?. I wonder if there's a decent way for us to allow that top level Maths context API to accept an arbitrary component or render callback so it can use KaTeX or our MathJax helper.\nIt's totally fine if you create a new package in the monorepo for doing it with KaTeX. It seems like KaTeX development has picked back up and they now handle a lot more that was missing.. Since there is a pretty darn opinionated routing thing here for the \"directory app\", I'm thinking I may just move this into the jupyter extension for now to make it easier to iterate without conflicting with core itself.. Next up for me is unifying the dummy, empty, and placeholder types.\nMy current thinking is that FileContents is really the placeholder type for truly unknown files, and it's the model attribute that holds a potential EmptyModel. This reflects the Contents API itself really well since when doing a contents listing, each entry's \"content\" key is null. While we could keep it nullable, it's muchhhhh easier to reason about with flow if we have a type on a model (currentModel).. commuter is a static only view, like nbviewer. Amusingly though, this is fixed now! There was a bit of an oversight in a previous release.. Closing in favor of #2778.. Wait do you really rotate your monitor for that? \ud83d\ude04 \nHaving code and outputs appear side to side is an interesting idea. I haven't thought through the implications of it much though (mostly as it relates to being able to set/change this setting on all cells, some cells, etc.). I'll be thinking about it!. No CSS that we're using is affected here. Only the merge addon was affected.. > This functionality is different to how jupyter runs.\nAs in the current behavior is different and this brings us closer to parity?. I'm sure edge cases will come up in the parsing, we'll shake 'em out though. \ud83d\ude04 \nWe should definitely put in an error boundary on this in case there are errors.. I've got some cycles this week to look at this while I'm also going to move our MathJax context API over to the new React 16.3 Context API.. nteract uses any jupyter kernels it can find in the standard jupyter kernelspec locations. If you're using conda, it won't pick up your environments though. You'll have to register the kernels like this:\npython -m ipykernel install --user\nSame thing applies to virtual environments. One way to see which kernels are installed is using jupyter kernelspec list.\nYour issue highlights that we need to offer some transparency into what we see as kernels and point people to docs on how to register more environments.. I think what I'd want to do for this is to do dynamic loading of the transforms. We'd boot up the app as fast as we can, run the import() calls (the promise backed version) through an epic, and update what the current transforms are. The outputs would then re-render with the better mimetype.. Not sure if we're ready for this. We probably want our d3 to match the versions used by our dependencies (maybe I should take this out of the top level...). Closed by #2788 . Based on the webpack import docs, it might be easier to do this at a top level within our app providing hints as to what we're loading and what chunk to place it in.. Another way of doing it is with some setState tinkering inside of componentDidMount(). /cc @theengineear -- this is more of me trying to make the page load background things asynchronously, MathJax is the next problem (I promise not to touch this stuff again for a while).. > I'm assuming that handling some of the kernel actions directly via the kernels API is OK for now, then?\nYeah, interrupt, restart, and connection all are supposed to happen via the kernel API. Only create and stop need to happen via the sessions API (note -- this includes changing kernels, which we don't support yet).. We used to have many themes included then started to feel the pain of maintaining multiple themes, especially as we started changing the CSS structure. We now only support CSS variables in themes (and can introduce more).. There's not a way currently.. This is great, thanks @jkornblum!. I forgot to hit that merge button! Whoops. Now it's in. \ud83d\ude04 . Jupyter extension is working well\nDesktop needs some work due to me locking down the contentRefs on the notebook app.. Desktop all set now, though we certainly want to clean up how we render contents for the placeholder gunk.. You'll have to run the ipykernel install step like documented here: https://nteract.io/kernels/python. I wish we could automate it. The only hope we have of automating it in a reasonable way is to bundle a python kernel with our app, because then we don't have to mess with people's systems.. > I really enjoy nteract and I am developing a course to introduce nteract to Chinese users.\nThat is super exciting! Hopefully we'll be able to make it better and better.. Gotta fix up the tests then this is good to go.. Super good to go now!. > Cool. I feel like it's a little odd that download / save share the epic as far as organization goes. We could potentially factor out the common code and create two epics... Not sure how you feel about it.\nThe amount of boilerplate we've been writing for this stuff has been driving me slightly crazy. I'm going to push up a commit and see what you think.. \n. \n. Wow, this is super slick @theengineear, love it.\n\n. Time to get this moving forward!. Tests need a fix. Amusingly, they now catch the proper behavior for us. \ud83d\ude04 . For posterity, it takes roughly this:\n```diff\ndiff --git a/applications/play/components/Main.js b/applications/play/components/Main.js\nindex c1811e11..370c9761 100644\n--- a/applications/play/components/Main.js\n+++ b/applications/play/components/Main.js\n@@ -179,8 +179,16 @@ class Main extends React.Component<, > {\n             gitref={gitrefValue}\n           />\n         ) : null}\n-\n         \n+           {\n+              this.handleEditorChange(event.target.value);\n+            }}\n+          />\n+        \n+\n+        {/ \n {\n             value={sourceValue}\n             onChange={this.handleEditorChange}\n           />\n-        \n+         /}\n     <div className=\"play-outputs\">\n       <Outputs>\n\n@@ -240,6 +248,16 @@ class Main extends React.Component<, > {\n           --header-height: 42px;\n           --editor-width: 52%;\n\ntextarea {\nwidth: 100%;\nbox-sizing: border-box;\nfont-family: \"Source Code Pro\", monospace;\nfont-size: 12px;\nline-height: 22px;\npadding: 10px;\nborder-top: 0px;\n}\n+\n           header {\n             display: flex;\n             justify-content: space-between;\n```\n\nand you'll have a working textarea that's \"hooked up\" to the kernel.\n\n. It looks like the wrapper component  shipping non-transpiled JS in that package. We only build / transpile our own packages so to make this work we'd have to either make our webpack config / babel loader transpile that package or fork the component (or write our own).\nIt looks like there's another option too. In the example next config they provide, they explicitly override fs to empty to make their package build. You'd have to add that to the next config for play as well.. Oh nice, https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor/pull/767 was a good read. Based on that, I'd say that we create our own wrapper component around Monaco, similar to what we have for codemirror.. > not really understanding why I don't need to manually kill the kernel? Is it possibly that that's just getting taken care of under the hood for us?\nAs you pointed out to me on slack, when updating the session with a new kernel it will kill the old kernel: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/services/sessions/handlers.py#L144\n(noting this for the sake of having a record). Ok, this made something explicit that was always hidden away -- the ui state for the kernel status should come from the kernel, not from what's in the notebook document. This gives them a consistent view of what they're really connected to, rather than what is in the document. I've made the \"choice\" of what the language to come from the kernel first and then fallback to the notebook.\nA follow on PR needs to do several things:\n\n[ ] Track the codemirror mode, display name, etc. inside the kernel object\n[ ] Move the notebook fully off of current* selectors. I'm going to fix all the tests and then do an earnest review.. No problems with this one, I think it would be good for us to bring it in after the current release slated for today.. Opted to bring it in because of some of the bugs flow ended up fixing.. I think I probably shouldn't have changed the font-size here. I brought it down so it wasn't so \"loud\". \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n@mseal, @mpacer, @willingc - thoughts?. Changes look good!. Update: we don't have an action for this. We need to make an action that will do a restart and then run all the cells once we know the kernel is ready.. This is the first time we've needed any amount of options/selection UI so it's totally fine this is (self-described as) rough. The main focus is the visualization from rough user-provided data and this is looking pretty darn great from an interactive standpoint!\nWhat I think would be useful, as a project, is if we provided some UI components for options/selection that work well inside the app. Happy to help carve them out in here or as a new PR/new package. I know @theengineear is interested too.\nI'm going to be on the road tomorrow so I think what I'll do is make sure I have this cloned / installed so I can try it out. . Related issues for this component:\n\nMost similar issue, bringing us closer to Zeppelin's data viewer: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/2324\nImproving the icons https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/2321. This is working pretty well inside the showcase!\n\n\nOn Desktop (and likely the jupyter extension), I'm getting errors:\n\n. That might be because we have Immutable.JS structures going in and we're not converting them (?). I'll tinker with it to figure it out.. Ok I've snuck in a default height property for semiotic to work with. Still rendering issues for some of the chart types, I'll keep at it. I'd really like to start breaking components up into separate files here.. It's amusing how much we ported over from the infer code from frictionless tableschema.. This is a bit of an aside to this component, likely essential for maintenance though.\nWe've got some decisions to make about the table schema inference. I recall we forked it internally into here to reduce dependencies originally. It's not currently flow typed (and doesn't match our current style well). The original library we built from is now using an asynchronous interface.\nSome thoughts / direction:\n\nWe tear all the inference code out, require that a schema is passed in\nWe re-write the inference code ourselves\nWe move over to the current version of https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-js, which means we probably need to do it at the top level component, relying on setting state internally to the component and potentially memoizing\n\nAt the very least, I'd like to group the inference code in a separate module . @emeeks is this getting close enough that we can merge the first pass here and then iterate with new PRs? I believe from our in-person work that you also upgraded the semiotic version.. Let's keep this moving on forward, thanks @emeeks!. Nice!\nI've been running\nDEBUG=true npm run spawn\nThis is super handy to have a shortened command at the root, thank you!. Thank you, this is great!. No changes needed to our CSS. \ud83d\ude88 . Tabling this one for now, I need to do this in a less drastic way so we can iterate on it.. pyechart will need to switch to detecting if requirejs is available. Both nteract and jupyterlab don't support the old requirejs setup that the classic notebook used.\nxref: https://github.com/pyecharts/pyecharts/issues/351. We don't support the classic jupyter notebook extensions and don't really have a paved path for including them.\nMy answer is a little bit different depending on if we're using the desktop app or the jupyter extension. With the jupyter server we can load arbitrary files that get served from /static or any other extension (assuming they're not requirejs based). Is the main dependency that echarts js lib?. nteract responds to the same payloads that come from _repr_html_.\nOne thing we started adopting a few years ago (and jupyterlab eventually brought in) was custom payloads, particularly where there is a specific schema between a JS library and what the python side would send. We do this for vega, plotly, and others by allowing them to send their own data type + mimetype. For Plotly, they wrote a versioned schema that we happily send on to their JS library. In order to do this though, we bake in access to these visualization libraries as part of our shipped app. So long as pyecharts has their own schema that would be adhered to as well as maintenance work on supporting the React component that wraps it, then we can incorporate it. We don't have a dynamic way for users to add on new libraries in nteract yet.. In summary, your method of pulling the JS from CDN is likely the only solution for today. Long term we'd have to do development work as mentioned above.. I think that would be cool. Within Electron it uses the HTML5 API for notifications, which means we can enable it for the jupyter extension too. \ud83d\ude04 \nThe only difference between the jupyter extension and the desktop app is that notifications are by default granted to the electron process. Run this in the dev console in nteract:\nNotification.requestPermission(perm => console.log(perm))\nNOTE: notifications will only show if they're not blocked at a system level\nShowing the notification we can do as a side effect inside the executeCell epic or as another epic that notices that the cell finished, checking to see if the window is in view or not.\n\n. Oh fun, actually I found out that MERGE_CONFIG was using a Map (yet not the Immutable kind). That may need a touchup.. > Here it also seems to be enabled by default, which makes me doubly uncomfortable.\nOops! This should be an opt-in, where the script would only get written when the google analytics code is defined.\n\nHowever, I always feel extremely uncomfortable when Google Analytics code insertion is a core part of an open source project\n\nI wanted to make this easier for others to use the work I'll end up doing around hooking up actions to google analytics events. I could just provide it as redux middleware though and then they'd have to get the index.html instantiated if they want to use it. It's basically build your own nteract_on_jupyter at that point though.. Working my way towards fully working.

Since this passes and is already super good, we can make new PRs for improving this further. Thanks again @yuvipanda!. Implementing directly based on your event system seems like a great way to keep it exactly in sync with matplotlib. What events / data would we expect to receive on the frontend?. CI bots have approved our social bots. \u26a1\ufe0f . I think after I introduced the last modified checks the saving stopped happening. I need to fully flesh this out and test it. Marking as WIP.. Rebasing and coming back to working on this feature.. Finished off making autosave based on the actual last modified timestamp. \ud83c\udf89 \nNext piece is tracking when we keep auto save on or off. Originally @yuvipanda and I thought about beginning autosaving once an initial autosave action was been kicked off, just like in the redux-observable 1.0.0 example:\njs\nconst autoSaveEpic = (action$, state$) =>\n  action$.pipe(\n    ofType(AUTO_SAVE_ENABLE),\n    // The use of an exhaustMap here is basically a flipped switch to say\n    // \"we are in autosaving mode, don't re-enable it again until requested\"\n    exhaustMap(() =>\n      state$.pipe(\n        // Note that our setup is a little more complex because we have multiple documents (potentially)\n        // and are autosaving per contentRef\n        pluck('content'),\n        distinctUntilChanged(),\n        throttleTime(500, { leading: false, trailing: true }),\n        concatMap(content =>\n          saveContent(content).pipe(\n            map(() => saveContentFulfilled()),\n            catchError(e => of(saveContentRejected(e)))\n          )\n        ),\n        takeUntil(action$.pipe(\n          ofType(AUTO_SAVE_DISABLE)\n        ))\n      )\n    )\n  );\nInstead we'd like to store it in the state tree for each content element, and update the state for that field.. Something deeply needed here is a last saved (and saving) indicator which I think belongs in the upper right of the title bar. I'll make a new PR for that.. Since this is pretty workable at the moment, I'm going to open new issues for things that I want to refine for it.\n\n[ ] Propagate errors when unable to autosave due to another tab being opened. The way to override it is by literal saving.\n[ ] Visual indicator for saving and last saved. /cc @yuvipanda @theengineear . I've fixed all the issues that were simple enough with a light pass. I don't know how to fix the \"Missing type annotation for React.ElementProps\". Note that this has been reported to the flow team here: https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/6161. I had a hunch that it was related to our (old) practice of specifying the return type of render to be React.Element<*>. Turns out, that was it!. \ud83c\udf89 We're on track! \ud83c\udf89 . I don't have the bandwidth to evaluate this upgrade so I'm going to close this.. Closing in favor of #2785. Gotta handle vega upgrades manually due to us straddling multiple versions..

Only CSS changes here are themes we're not using, ssms, idea, and gruvbox-dark.\nExpressions in f string syntax highlighting are now supported for the Python mode!. Jay and I also talked about an approach that would automatically check for the heartbeat on a kernel connection and attempt to reconnect if the heartbeat isn't happening. The implementation we ended up at was something like this:\n```js\nconst originalWebsocket = webSocket(\n  formWebSocketURL(serverConfig, kernelID, sessionID)\n);\nconst wsSubject = merge(\n  originalWebsocket,\n  timer(5000).pipe(\n    exhaustMap(() => {\n      const waitTime = 10000;\n  originalWebsocket.next(heartBeatMessage);\n\n  return throwError(`timed out after ${waitTime} ms`).pipe(\n    timeout(waitTime),\n    // Effectively, if we get _any_ message we assume that the connection is live\n    takeUntil(originalWebsocket)\n  );\n})\n// Somehow this needs to cause a reconnection\n\n)\n);\n```\n. This is working pretty well, even on play. There are some pieces we need to refine in terms of what users see (they should know we're reconnecting and that they're disconnected). I'm not sure how we should expose those from this subject.. This also seems to miss the case of when the websocket gets stuck in a pending state.\n\n. I'm going to merge this as something that's a bit better, even though it doesn't cover all the cases we'll need. We'll keep on improving from here!. This doesn't quite work so I'm going to go ahead with just refactoring the github publishing to use Rx directly and play a little better with how our state and event flow works..

I'm unsure what's going on...~~\n```\n$ curl \\\n\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\"files\": {\"Untitled.ipynb\": {\"content\": \"some file\"}}}' \\\n  https://api.github.com/gists\n{\n  \"message\": \"Not Found\",\n  \"documentation_url\": \"https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/#create-a-gist\"\n}\n```\n\n~~I reported it to GitHub support as well since everything appears right to me.~~\nThis happens when a token doesn't have gist scopes. I'm going to make sure that gets detected as part of this PR.. Hey @jdetle, I took the liberty of completely refactoring the github publishing flow. Wanna check it out?. Hey no problem. Since the module we were relying on was going through enough changes I figured it was time for me to take a full look at this.. Wow. Thanks for noting. That one was still running on my personal account.\nhttps://slack.nteract.io/ should work, I'll fix that one up and also fix the links to the slacks.. Thank you so much for reporting this. I've switched this over to the paid nteract account and was able to clean this out of my personal account (which got switched to a free plan, causing this problem). We don't support STDIN from nteract clients (yet). Thanks for reporting this.. cc @nikitakit . Thanks for raising this up as a potential option. Locking cells could be possible. \ud83e\udd14 . Woo! So begins our design docs. \u2764\ufe0f . Desktop app totally not published.\nWe also should address https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/2878#issuecomment-389426085. Woo, this is working really well. Can't wait to switch webpack to loading this component with import(). . Definitely.. Closed by #2813. Closed by #2813. This is working really well for the jupyter extension and the desktop app. However, all next.js apps are breaking in the same spot:\n```\nUnexpected token import\n/Users/kyle/code/src/github.com/nteract/nteract/node_modules/roughjs/lib/generator.js:1\n(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) { import _regeneratorRuntime from 'babel-runtime/regenerator';\n                                                              ^^^^^^\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token import\n    at createScript (vm.js:80:10)\n    at Object.runInThisContext (vm.js:139:10)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:599:28)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:646:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:554:32)\n    at tryModuleLoad (module.js:497:12)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:489:3)\n    at Module.require (module.js:579:17)\n    at require (internal/module.js:11:18)\n    at Object.

Ok, everything is patched up to work for imports, I'm going to see if I can cut the babel config down again.. Just an idea of what this helps keep out of our main bundle:\n4.0K    plotly-412cc5768c73c5d737ae.bundle.js\n 52K    tabular-dataresource-642ec9c72b58e09398fe.bundle.js\n3.4M    typescript.worker.js\n4.0K    vega-transform-34d3a88282d23797f8f3.bundle.js\n2.1M    vendors~plotly-ff6afe7ca61e4d55299f.bundle.js\n1.1M    vendors~tabular-dataresource-24a83b53c1b5fd181c1e.bundle.js\n1.5M    vendors~vega-transform-b77a2bd4a48d8057f22b.bundle.js\n. One major note though -- modifying things in @nteract/core tends to cause a full reload instead of an in-place reload. \ud83d\ude2d \nModifying the jupyter extension itself is pretty good though. \ud83d\ude04 . Since our webpack build is a bit weighty though, it does take a while to go from blank page to full app right after running the command. Sometimes you have to reload the page. . Oh interesting -- for any compound components that check child.type we'll have to use react-hot-loaders areComponentsEqual.. This is now working. I think I'm going to go ahead and refactor the stateModule export usages though while I'm at it.. \u26a0\ufe0f I did notice that hot reloading of styled-jsx does not work (it will fail) so that's going to take some digging into what @zeit does for next.js.\n\n. You're so right. This gets wayyyy complicated. I'll go ahead and close this.. Thanks for reporting this. I'm guessing that this is a result of our more recent handling of the kernel status and I should dive in with a slower to start kernel. We've been a bit blocked on a desktop release for a bit here, so this does need to get revisited.. Hey thanks!. Fantastic!. ## Plan\nWhen a kernel gets connected, it sends all messages in batched collections as a new action:\ntype BatchedJupyterMessages = {\n  type: \"BATCHED_JUPTYER_MESSAGE_ACTION\"\n  payload: {\n    contentRef: ContentRef,\n    messages: Array<JupyterMessage>\n  }\n}\nThese then get routed to the contents model that is the intended receiver. Since this is now devoid of a CellId, we have to do a different kind of tracking. Within the notebook for instance, the last execute message id would need to be tracked for each cell (this is similar to how the classic notebook does the tracking). We then drop any messages that aren't \"assigned\" anywhere.\nI'm guessing that the generic action that needs to be sent is:\ntype SendExecuteRequest = {\n  payload: {\n    contentRef: ContentRef,\n    message: JupyterMessage\n  }\n}\nWhat I'm a bit unsure of is how we'd track the CellID for the notebook. There seem to be a few options -- we could store some info in a metadata field in that SendExecuteRequest action or we can create this new action from the ol' execute cell action. \ud83d\udcad . Now that I've been able to think of this overnight, I'm going to see about introducing it as a new action and epic.. Great, thank you. I wondered what the semantic difference was.. Howdy @jdetle, good to see you again!. Thank you both so much for fixing this!. Probably want to remove the changes to the notebook file here.\nThanks for making these fixes!. Ah, cool. I'll go ahead and merge this in then.. Great, thanks for adding these!\nIf you ever want more bugs shaken out here, swap d: Object out to d: *. That will make it infer more types. Better yet though would be if you create types for these d: MyThing.. Awesome! Thanks for making this better and better.. This is some really great feedback, thanks for posting. I love the idea of storing snapshots somewhere. We could put them in the .ipynb_checkpoints folder used by the notebook as well.\nKnowing about the three options on close is really helpful, that didn't occur to me. Does Save both do the save and close?. On master we've got autosaving setup. Since we don't have global undo (you have it per text area) though, it might be best for us to have snapshots in before the next release.. I love that you kept hamster.. I think it's totally fine to make the tradeoff of making a dummy commit message for now. We can always introduce a UI for filling it in later.. So great to see you again @alexandercbooth! This is really well outlined so far and I love where you've put the UI right now. Glad you've picked up the new contentRef setup as well! \ud83d\ude04 . Sometimes, sadly, you have to make sure you're updated with the remote repo and run git clean -xfd && npm i to make sure the dependencies all match up nicely. \ud83d\ude2d . There we go. Things were failing because the monaco webpack plugin was expecting a higher version of monaco that was not part of our semver range.. @loganfsmyth - thanks for answering questions over in https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/4417\nCircling over to here -- I'm currently making our babel 7 versions match exactly that of what next.js currently has (looking forward to the RC and final!).\nWe... have a bit of a crazy monorepo, though it works well for us. We use mostly stock lerna for our setup. Within lerna terms, we have two different sets of packages, packages and applications. Everything in packages we \u2764\ufe0f being able to edit along with the applications that use them, while also making sure that we transpile the versions we publish. This is the layout, just to help make some sense of it in here:\n```\napplications\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 commuter           \u27a1\ufe0f Next.js app, with an express server\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 desktop            \u27a1\ufe0f Electron app\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 jupyter-extension  \u27a1\ufe0f Python app with a webpack build\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 notebook-on-next   \u27a1\ufe0f Next.js app\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 play               \u27a1\ufe0f Next.js app\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 showcase           \u27a1\ufe0f Next.js app\npackages\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ansi-to-react\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 commutable\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 commuter-frontend\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 connected-components\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 core\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 display-area\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 dropdown-menu\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 editor\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 enchannel-zmq-backend\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 fs-observable\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 logos\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 markdown\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 mathjax\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 messaging\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 monaco-editor\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 notebook-app-component\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 notebook-preview\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 octicons\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 presentational-components\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 rx-binder\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 rx-jupyter\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 styles\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 timeago\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 transform-dataresource\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 transform-geojson\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 transform-model-debug\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 transform-plotly\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 transform-vdom\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 transform-vega\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 transforms\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 transforms-full\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 types\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 vega-embed2\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 webpack-configurator  \u27a1\ufe0f Common webpack configuration to allow apps to build\n```\nAs you noted in https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/4417:\n\nMy main concern however is that your logic there relies on the using having configured a .babelrc, since your logic on its own will compile those modules, but not enable any plugins/presets on its own.\n\nWe have an individual .babelrc for the lerna root that mostly gets used by the packages (and the jupyter extension and then a separate config for the next.js apps.\n$ find . -name \".babelrc\"\n./.babelrc\n./applications/commuter/.babelrc\n./applications/commuter/backend/.babelrc\n./applications/jupyter-extension/nteract_on_jupyter/.babelrc\n./applications/notebook-on-next/.babelrc\n./applications/play/.babelrc\n./applications/showcase/.babelrc\nCome to think of it though... we could make a babel preset within our monorepo that the other packages use. \ud83e\udd14 Could write it in js and make it require-able. \ud83d\udcad \nIt's funny that as I write this out, it's clear the monorepo has helped simplify our days of N repos while at the same time being its own kind of chaos (albeit managed).. I'm going to go ahead with this build out.. Awesome! Thanks for taking the jupyter extension for a spin!\nThis whole setup can be synchronous and part of the connected menu I think.\n\nwindow.open is synchronous (and there's not an asynchronous variant)\nwindow.open's side effect doesn't change anything on our page\n\nYou are right in catching if window.open failed or not since it can return null. \ud83e\udd14 I suppose we need a flow for popup handling detection.\nHowever! There's another way to do this without having to deal with any JS issues. Create an <a> link that matches the style in the menu, likely like this:\n<a href=\"/nteract/edit\" target=\"_blank\">Open Directory View</a>\nSince this comes from user interaction, it doesn't count towards the browser's built in pop up throttling.\nAs an aside, the nteract logo in the upper left also has the behavior of navigating up a directory and showing the directory listing (though it's clearly a kinda hidden feature).. Now that I've taken this for a spin locally, I think we should make a few style changes:\n\nPut this menu item at the top of the list\nLabel it \"Open...\" (mostly to match the jupyter server)\nOverride the color to match that of the other items (and not inherit the a style). It might work to write color: currentColor.. Thank you!. Alright!. Gah! The errors are the same things I'm seeing in https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/2888, and must be some issue in eslint land because the anchor links referenced definitely have content. I'll investigate, this is affecting master.\n\nAs for the codemirror changes, they look good. We don't have any CSS or JS to adapt with this.. @wip, you rock.. I'm just going to turn the failing rules off for a bit and come back to them at a later time.. Ah... I see why here. I included styled-jsx as a peerDependency for that component (mostly so we can rely on having the same copy used by all components): https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/e3903d5f164ae202499641b924cbc051e45b3280/packages/notebook-app-component/package.json\nWe could make that a direct dependency. I'm not sure if the babel config would still have to be there unless you're also using styled-jsx inside your app. . Nice, that todo bot is already on a roll.. I think with the query param stuff this will be off to the races very soon.\nOne issue I'm expecting to run into though is what happens when you hit the back button navigating through the directory listing. Those won't have the temporary contentRefs in the URL.. I'm seeing an error that's also on master due to vega's requiring of css (totally unrelated to your PR):\n```\n    ERROR in /home/circleci/nteract/packages/transform-vega/node_modules/vega-embed/node_modules/vega-tooltip/vega-tooltip.css\n    Module parse failed: Unexpected character '#' (1:0)\n    You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.\n    | #vg-tooltip-element {\n    |   visibility: hidden;\n    |   padding: 8px;\n     @ /home/circleci/nteract/packages/transform-vega/node_modules/vega-embed/node_modules/vega-tooltip/build/defaults.js 1:0-47 56:11-23\n     @ /home/circleci/nteract/packages/transform-vega/node_modules/vega-embed/node_modules/vega-tooltip/build/index.js\n     @ /home/circleci/nteract/packages/transform-vega/node_modules/vega-embed/build/embed.js\n     @ /home/circleci/nteract/packages/transform-vega/src/index.js\n     @ /home/circleci/nteract/packages/transforms-full/src/index.js\n     @ ./src/notebook/index.js\nERROR in /home/circleci/nteract/packages/transform-vega/node_modules/vega-embed/vega-embed.css\nModule parse failed: Unexpected token (1:0)\nYou may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.\n| .vega-embed {\n|   position: relative;\n|   display: inline-block;\n @ /home/circleci/nteract/packages/transform-vega/node_modules/vega-embed/build/embed.js 10:0-43 116:75-85\n @ /home/circleci/nteract/packages/transform-vega/src/index.js\n @ /home/circleci/nteract/packages/transforms-full/src/index.js\n @ ./src/notebook/index.js\n\nat Promise.all.then.arr (/home/circleci/nteract/node_modules/lerna/node_modules/execa/index.js:236:11)\nat <anonymous>\nat process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:188:7)\n\ncode: 2,\n```. I'm going to rebase your PR, merge this, and look towards a release today.. Wow, you know what you're doing renovate!\nSadly we need to stay pinned to babel @ the .42 beta:\nhttps://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/canary/package.json#L56-L65. Oooh, I think we want this one.. Wow I've also broken master in new ways with the new babel setup. I'm going to merge this since it fixes vega. I'll have to keep working at fixing the babel + jest setup.. Nope.. Nope!. Yay back to normalcy!. Can't do this yet \ud83d\ude11 . The babel issue on master is fixed now so I'm going to go ahead and merge this since the python bits here look good.. Vega fixed this for us (and others).. Ok, we can close this for now.\n\ud83e\udd14we could make the page show \"You can close this window now\" and have a button to close it, once we know background resources have been cleaned up.. Yikes!\nWe have one muscle memory mismatch which is that we don't use the tab backed implementation in nteract. It's ctrl-space to trigger manually (otherwise it comes up automatically) and enter to pick.\nThank you for logging this so we can revisit this and refine the autocomplete UX.  \ud83e\udd17. This is all getting so awesome!. I've rebased this to get it working with everything on master while Carol has been meeting with folks. . The _hovered prop I put in the last PR that's now documented was a bit of a \"how the heck can I describe the levels visually when I can't trigger :hover\". Now I'm a little worried about exposing this prop out. Do you think I should just document \"hey this prop is merely here for demonstration -- please let the browser do hover for you\"?. Deployed! https://components.nteract.io/. Cc @willingc. Cleaning up the kernels definitely needs better handling in the main process.\nI wonder though... in the meantime if it would be quicker for us to switch spawnteract's child_process usage to execa as it cleans up spawned processes when the parent process dies.. Would any of you be willing to try out a PR for spawnteract?. It looks like some imports need to be re-arranged, possibly just in tests:\n```\n FAIL  packages/dropdown-menu/tests/index-spec.js\n  \u25cf Test suite failed to run\nCannot find module '@nteract/dropdown-menu' from 'index.js'\n\n  12 | import { DropdownTrigger } from \"@nteract/dropdown-trigger\";\n  13 | import { DropdownContent } from \"@nteract/dropdown-content\";\n> 14 | \n     | ^\n  15 | export { DropdownMenu, DropdownTrigger, DropdownContent };\n\n```\nTo get this across the finish line, I'm going to see if I can fix it locally and push up some changes. Thank you for joining me on this React documentation adventure!. Oops, I broke the styling within the main app while trying to make this work well inside of our docs. Definitely a WIP here. I'll see how far I get tomorrow. \ud83d\ude04 \nThanks Carol!. Excellent! Thank you for adding this! I've been wanting for Open Recent for a loooong time.\nOne thing that's held me back from adopting a new version of Electron was builds of zeromq.js working with our setup across platforms. I'll have to check that aspect out.. Ooook, now that the desktop build is fixed (thanks @lgeiger!) I'm going to give this a spin.. Since I need the latest changes on master to evaluate if the production version can build with electron 2.0, I'm going to rebase this PR and force push it. I'll keep you posted @piercefreeman!. Verified that Electron 2.x works on Windows and Mac! Merging! Thank you so much @piercefreeman. Welcome to nteract! \ud83c\udf89 . Nope, doesn't work on my mac. Perhaps I should try again with a fresh build on master.. Now that this passes CI, do you think this is still WIP?\nI can do an earnest review of the PR if you're ready for it too. \ud83d\ude04 . Ok fantastic! I'm super looking forward to using this with gatsby, I've been hoping to tinker with using it for our own docs. \ud83d\ude04 . Fantastic! Happy to merge this in and ship soon so we can iterate on everything.\nBy the way, if you'd like we can certainly host the gatsby transformer in nteract as well.. Thank you again for submitting this! I've also extended an invite to join the nteract org both on github and on npm. Welcome to the nteract party! \ud83c\udf89 . > Maybe we could move the showcase from next to gatsby.\nThat's totally cool. We were mostly using showcase to hack on components without the full blown app having to run, switching to gatsby is cool since it has a live reloading setup.\n\nBit of an aside --\nWe should probably tinker with gatsby in general for documentation, since we've been using React styleguidist for light component documentation. The react style-guidist setup uses react-docgen underneath to grab all the type info + comments, so I imagine we could build some cohesive site(s) on top of that data. Likely docs.nteract.io for user facing documentation, devdocs.nteract.io for nteract libraries and components.. Thanks for reporting issues so continuously, even though we haven't been able to address everything (mostly due to bandwidth). You've been so diligent on reporting these issues and categorizing them, would you like to join nteract with a role of labelling and triaging issues with us?. By now you'll get an invite to join which you can accept by visiting https://github.com/nteract (look for a banner at the top). Being part of the org does require using GitHub's Two Factor Auth.\nWelcome to the nteract party! \ud83c\udf89 \nFirst steps I'd love to have:\n\nGo through unlabeled issues\nMark it with pkg:PACKAGE_NAME and/or app:APP_NAME\nIf you don't know what app or package name, it's ok to mark it with triage and I can come back to label them\nIt's also ok to just label it with the apps you know it affects (desktop, jupyter-extension, etc.)\n\nSeparately, create a new issue, labeled pinned (that's a label to let the bots know not to mark it as stale or lock it), that outlines our issue triaging strategy above as a bit of a meta issue. Then we can all discuss the issue triage / label / maintenance efforts.. Woohoo!. Probably default to expanded.. You'll need to update the jest snapshots by doing this:\nnpm t -- --updateSnapshot\nAs for size, I've noticed that everything looks a bit better at 90%. That's a totally made up Kyle heuristic though. I think we should go with this and try it out for a bit. \ud83d\ude04 . I think I'm going to call this pretty darn good, and we can keep iterating on it before release. I'll go ahead and bring it in and connect it up to some examples. \nThanks @alexandercbooth!. Admittedly, there are some rough edges in this code base as I was prototyping. Probably good to clean some of those up.. cc @gnestor @yuvipanda @willingc @alexandercbooth \nQuestions:\n\nShould we include the React Component(s) that use this host cache and return a host?\nI could also include it in a @nteract/experimental package or something. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nHow do people feel about the current interface?. Ok, I say we roll with this for now since @alexandercbooth had a look. Time to ship our first @mybinder component and library. \ud83d\ude04 \n\nLet's try using these!. I'll go ahead and implement the Kernel provider you outlined above. If we do one called <Session /> then I think that it would likely need to be mapped to /api/sessions, which gets you a kernel while also establishing a link to some content.\nI've been a bit more iffy on what the interface should be for anything that passes back the messages and the way to execute. Mostly because if we send all the messages down, the entire tree will re-render on every single message received. \nThe interface that gets to just messages or just outputs seems like a good area for us to explore with new libraries in the monorepo.. Oook, this branch is worth trying out now that I stuck some of the component we hacked on inside the styleguide.\nClone this branch, npm install it and run:\nnpx styleguidist server\nThen open http://127.0.0.1:6060/#!/Kernel. Alright I'm going to get this PR passing and then we can merge it on in. \ud83d\ude04 . Away we go!. Whoa nice! I've been thinking of bringing in the iron icons as a new React library inside our repo for now. This is looking good.\nI think we probably want to use a React transition group to make sure to animate when saving is rather fast, so we don't have a flicker. We can do that after this PR though.. Thank you @alexandercbooth!. Oh nice, if you leave a TODO within a PR, it creates an issue. Next time I better make the comment more descriptive and not have assumptions about the surrounding code. \ud83d\ude05 . You know, I think we probably can remove ../lib/vendor.js from the index.html as well. I noticed on the jupyter extension that app ended up with the dependency as well. What we really need to do is make sure chunks are able to be created and loaded on demand via webpack.. You need chunks to load properly if you're going to use dynamic imports, they're not the same thing though.. I'll go ahead and assume lowercase is the right thing considering what I see in Atom's source. We definitely need to work on this feature some more. Thanks @piercefreeman, I'm looking forward to using this. \ud83d\ude04 . Great, I'll get this in and go ahead and do the publish. The monorepo does have to publish together, however it will only publish packages with changes. I've been planning on releasing today anyways. \ud83d\ude04 . I'm going to skip on fixing #2984 in favor of getting a release out since so many are requesting it. I'll work on the perf issue right after.. I may have to say that the monaco editor webpack plugin is upgraded at this point, though non-functional: #2992. Oops! I noticed I linked #2990 as the blocker above when it was really #2984. \ud83d\ude05 . This fail to build:apps is unrelated. I'll go ahead and bring this in + the vega fix PR.. I'm planning on making a release tonight or tomorrow anyways, so you'll have access to it :soon:.. \ud83d\ude04 . At runtime, at the very least, we should check that we're on the right notebook version and that the serverextension is enabled. Since our registration of jupyter nteract is successful, we should be able to detect this on launch. \ud83e\udd14 \ncc @mpacer . I've gone ahead and updated the article to make note of jupyter serverextension enable nteract:\n\nWe should still do something for runtime though. Thanks for reporting this and for giving nteract a spin @nickynicolson!. Closing for now since this didn't work out as intended and isn't worth a bother at the moment.. Thank you!. This is ok to bring in for now, though we'll want to handle #2997 as well.. Before we merge this we need to:\n\nCheck to see if CSS has changed, as we have our own vendorized version of their CSS here\nUpdate jest snapshots. CSS change we likely should make:\n\nhttps://github.com/react-component/menu/compare/6.2.11...7.1.0#diff-0e1130f84eefdbec26836cf3da534eb4R113\nThere might be other code changes for this as well.. Darn it. I had to set these up in order for hot reloading to work within the monorepo on components that check children type:\n```js\n// react-hot-loader uses proxies to the original elements so we need to use\n// their comparison function in case a consumer of these components is\n// using hot module reloading\nimport { areComponentsEqual } from \"react-hot-loader\";\n{React.Children.map(this.props.children, child => {\n          if (areComponentsEqual(child.type, DropdownTrigger)) {\n            return React.cloneElement(child, {\n              onClick: ev => {\n                this.setState({ menuHidden: !this.state.menuHidden });\n              }\n            });\n...\n```\nI should have added react-hot-loader to these components as a direct dependency because of what they list:\n\nNote: You can safely install react-hot-loader as a regular dependency instead of a dev dependency as it automatically ensures it is not executed in production and the footprint is minimal.\n\nIn further thinking though, this is affecting all components and all libraries because of the babel config. I need to just set this react hot loader babel setup for the components that definitely need it.. The packages and apps that actually need this babel config:\n\nnteract-on-jupyter\ndropdown-menu\nnotebook-app-component\ntransform data resource. Yeah, it's our babel config that's injecting these. We need the packages that require these (primarily using areComponentsEqual) to set a custom babel config and keep the rest with simple configs.. I'm working on this now. It's tempting to further segment the components, which mostly have a need for both this and styled-jsx. I'll do my best to rectify this for the libraries first though.. Fixed and published. The next thing we need to do is segment all the components so they include styled-jsx as a peer dependency.. Testing this out locally to be sure, time to see how this fares. \ud83e\udd1e . Likely unrelated to this change, I noticed that switching kernels is not cleaning up the old connection files.. Connection files are definitely cleaned up on close of the app though!. Does the .deb work for folks on Ubuntu for the time being?. Since we've got the spawnteract change in (thank you again by the way) and we've pinned electron builder, I'll make a patch release this evening.\n\nI wonder if we could also detect that the user downloading is on a Debian variant, using the user agent and headers like we do now for detecting Mac, Windows, and Linux. Then we can default to the .deb.. v0.9.1 is now out. Give it a spin and let me know how it goes!. I sure wish we had a nice way of doing that.\nWe're not currently targeting support of it because there is not a non-python specific way of handling this way right now, with the jupyter protocols. Perhaps @Carreau knows where things are at for a variable explorer protocol or where we could take things.. Thanks for outlining that @yozlet!\n\nyou'd only need to define that once per kernel, and you'd have some control over the serialisation, so that might make the front-end easier and more powerful.\n\nI'm in agreement there. As long as we do it in a good enough way for Python, R, and Scala, I'm not too worried about making it super generic. I think I'm even ok with something that's Python specific so long as the user_expressions don't cause any side effects.\n. Interesting! I looked at what those are under the hood and each execute_result should be a block level element (in HTML parlance). I need to make this fix. Thanks for reporting!. Fantastic, this is great. I can ship this right now too.. ```\n$ lerna publish\nlerna info version 2.8.0\nlerna info versioning independent\nlerna info Checking for updated packages...\nlerna info Comparing with @nteract/commuter@5.4.0.\nlerna info Checking for prereleased packages...\n?

I'm seeing the data and schema fields in the right place (I think). I'll look into this with Elijah to figure it out.. It looks like the AppImage fix went in so we can bring this back up to date. After renovate does a rebase we can merge this in.. Looking good on the CSS changes.. I can help tweak that styling to get it working out. What would you like me to start helping with first?.NewNotebookNavigation` should be its own component, not part of the directory listing component.\nThe \"directory listing 'app'\" uses the navigator while also using the directory listing components.\nThe basepath stuff I need to fix with a proper routing setup. It's something we'll pass into the respective <Link />s or <a /> we pass as children to an entry.\n\nCould you also help me get started on testing \ud83d\ude2c?\n\nSince these are visual components, I'd start with using jest snapshots. That way you can write declarative tests and just make sure the \"rendered\" versions look like the right output.\n. As for styling, I'll come back to help you with this soon. \ud83d\ude04 . > \nAs much as possible I'd like to see the components get used only in the \"compound\" sense from this one, which likely means writing <DirectoryListing /> for each separately since they both use different routers (basepath handling, Links, etc.).. Now that we're super close on interface, I'd say it's time to add this to the styleguidist so it can be documented and experimented with as an interface.\ncc @willingc \ud83d\ude04 . Oooook, let's give it a shot. I'm cloning this locally now. I'll also help get it into the styleguide.\nIt's totally fine by the way if you use :global as it's still scoped to just that component and its children.. How's this?\n\nNeeds more style changes I think. This just relocates the styles.

I'll go ahead and tack this on as a commit.. Slick. I think we should use commuter's blues inside the directory listing too (I think ?). I played around with these components inside of the react style guide (I'll add a commit once you're ready) and noticed that we should change a few things:\n<Entry.Name> should take children rather than as a link prop, especially since we really use it as a child element.\nWe should export the components as named exports export class Entry for each separate component. Also! We should structure the directory like this:\n$ tree\ndirectory-listing\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 components\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 entry.js\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 entry.md\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 listing.js\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 listing.md\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.js. > Are entry.md and listing.md for the react style guide?\nYeah. That's where you document how to use the components, using react styleguidist.. I think at this point it's cool to take the WIP tag off and we can merge this!. Away we go!. Heh, that TODO issue now exists. It's probably a good thing though. \ud83d\ude05 . Wow, I'm much happier with this and at a much quicker pace than I expected! Care to check it out @alexandercbooth?. Thank you so much for checking this out John, it gives me much more confidence to have another pair of eyes on it!. Made sure Immutable was included as part of display area so the release goes well.. This should be closed by #3003. A release is coming out within minutes that you'll be able to upgrade to. The AppImage was definitely broken in 0.9.0.. We'll need to upgrade this in tandem with RxJS 6.x. We don't wrap up any jupyter dependencies inside of nteract, it uses the protocols without having to run python (unless using a python backed kernel).. Amusingly, I believe that this was fixed in a newer version of electron builder. Since the latest version of breaks a different issue with AppImages (on Debian distros), we're in a tricky spot.\nThank you for maintaining AppImage Hub @probonopd!. Love when PRs go through while I'm not watching. \ud83d\ude0a . Howdy!\nWe started this up in https://github.com/nteract/snakestagram though we haven't made further progress. Right now there are releases in https://github.com/nteract/snakestagram/releases\nWhat we need is to make the bundled assets npm installable. What this comes down to is creating an npm package that will:\n\nCheck for the latest release on https://github.com/nteract/snakestagram\nDownload it to a specified location\n\nThen in the electron app (here in applications/desktop) we need to set a few things:\n\nThe conda environment needs to be downloaded to somewhere like applications/desktop/bundled-kernel\nNOTE: This must be the right version for the platform it's being used on (Linux, macOS, Windows)\non build -> extraResources in applications/desktop/package.json we would need to include the path to this bundled kernel\nsimilar to how we do the bundled js kernel, we need to write a kernelspec for the bundled kernel that is embedded as part of the app\n\nSome of these items are also outlined across https://github.com/nteract/snakestagram/issues\nMuch thanks for kicking this off!\n\nAs an aside, @jdfreder is going to work at integrating ipywidgets into nteract (again) within the next month. Should be a good time to get all this working in tandem!. Did you mean to close this?. Sweet, this is a good suggestion.. The jupyter extension is taking a long time to build and this only affects the top level package.json so I'm going to merge this in now.. Alright, I'm going to give this a spin and do some rebasing.. Oh hey now that we have real type safety on Rx, it found real bugs:\n```\nCannot call catchError with function bound to selector because FetchKernelspecsFailed 1 is incompatible with\nrxjs$Observable [2] in the return value.\n packages/core/src/epics/kernelspecs.js\n  53\u2502             kernelspecs\n  54\u2502           });\n  55\u2502         }),\n  56\u2502         catchError(error => {\n  57\u2502           return actions.fetchKernelspecsFailed({ kernelspecsRef, error });\n  58\u2502         })\n  59\u2502       );\n  60\u2502     })\n  61\u2502   );\n\n flow-typed/npm/rxjs_v6.x.x.js\n\n[2] 887\u2502       selector: (err: any, caught: rxjs$Observable) => rxjs$Observable\n packages/core/src/actions.js\n\n1 108\u2502 }): actionTypes.FetchKernelspecsFailed => ({\n``. Note: I'm copying definitions of creation operators likeforkJoin` from later on in the file to add them to the top level namespace. There's got to be a better way to share those across the flow definitions. :-/ Just going to make this work for now. \ud83d\ude2c . > My atom has strip whitespaces enabled- is that okay @rgbkrk ?\nYeah prettier usually normalizes things for us.. Thanks for going after making dev work on Windows again!\n. It looks like the style building stuff is failing in the prepare step on CI. Can you check that out? I can't tell what the issue is at first glance.. I'm going to go ahead and merge this since it passes, then I'm going to remove the extraneous dep.. \ud83c\udf89 \ud83d\udda5 . Hey no prob, easy to fix up. \ud83d\ude04 . Just merging this and seeing how it goes!. Thanks for looking this over @alexandercbooth!. Woo!\nI've gone ahead and published the current docs at https://components.nteract.io/ again, even though we haven't published the directory listing or binder components to npm yet.. cc @willingc ^^ \nComponent docs getting better and better!. > If you are a collaborator on this repository, consider making this Pull Request from a branch on the same repository instead of a fork.\n\ud83d\ude36. Backing away from the now experiment, deploying by hand. Docs above are still accurate. \ud83d\ude04 . > Saving deployment image (218.0M)\nLOL, this is a terrible idea.. If we just moved the electron app out to another repo, we'd sure have a differently shaped monorepo. \ud83d\ude11. What I was hoping for with this would be that we could continuously deploy sample versions of our UI, backed by binder for kernel compute, that we can tinker with. May have to build something a bit custom for this to work. \ud83e\udd14 . Oh yeah, the build is still huge. I'm thinking the only reasonable option we might have is to take the built apps, put them in circle ci artifacts, and then publish to now.. > How long do your builds usually take?\nSo long as we're not building the desktop app, it's under 4 minutes.\nThis repo is a big monorepo with ~3 next apps, a hefty desktop app with native deps, and the static styleguidist setup I was hoping to push out (which ends up being tiny). If anything, I feel bad about all the things I need to tweak on my end. I would love if we could deploy several next.js apps from our monorepo.\nHappy to collaborate to make our overall setup easy for collaborators and make full use of zeit!. Oh nice, you can view them on circle CI: https://2136-37496521-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/styleguide/index.html\nWithin the build, click \"artifacts\", then open \"styleguide\". Click index.html \ud83c\udf89 \nThis could be automated to be easier, though it would take a bunch more bot work (like I did for galleria...). I'm going to aim for simple and not try to do more.. Super cool! I think I can trim down that logo so it's only the icon and give you a higher resolution version. This gives a good idea of it though!. Slick.. Now that I'm using this, can we make the launcher just be \"New\" and \"Open\" instead of \"Launch New Notebook\" then \"New\", \"Open\", etc.?. Interesting. With the upgrade, running a dist expects a github token to be set even though we're not publishing.. Excellent!\nDon't forget to plug in and charge your battery! \u26a1\ufe0f . Uh oh, there's a merge conflict ^^. Fixed it, I'll merge once it passes.. Thank you!. Another thing that can be cleaned up is the dependence on @nteract/types which we ended up migrating.. Ok, this is ready for a review. I included babel-runtime as a dependency in all the packages based on https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-runtime.html.\ncc @jdpigeon @lgeiger . I'm going to err on the side of getting this out and shipped since we're in a current funky state. Thanks all for reporting this and helping make external usage of the packages easier. \ud83d\ude07 . Reason I lean towards a peer dependency -- styled-jsx will end up \"flickering\" on first load if there are more than one copy of styled-jsx on the page (especially of differing versions). It does cause friction for users of our libraries though as they're required to install to use it.. Cool, let's get this shipped soon. Thanks!. Whoa \ud83d\ude2e . On to yarn!. Welcome to the nteract party! \ud83c\udf89 . Noooopeeee.\nCC @trxcllnt \ud83d\ude43 . xref: #3130 . All well now.. Whoop, I actually meant to ask you about these. While I was trying to figure out that thrown Header issue, I was making these explicit so I could read tracebacks more easily while injecting some debugger statements neatly.\nWhat does declaring these as anonymous functions provide when they're exported? It seemed like this was a clean way to prevent monkey patching by declaring this as a const, though I wasn't sure what it was for.\n. Yeah, I'm also expecting us to evolve these over time to better reflect the body of knowledge we're building together.\n. On a similar note, @odewahn has stated an interest in developing a tutorial on the Jupyter message spec via enchannel and ick.\n. Good note!\n. Good idea, we should break that out.\n. Since this function isn't exported, don't worry about the pseudo-hiding with leading underscores.\n. All the messages appear in the chrome console here (see screenshot).\n. This field is actually part of the notebook document itself, labeled execution_count (check out this raw notebook document).\n. I'd probably call this prop executionCount. It also only belongs to the Code Cells, as they're the ones that run execution.\n. Assumption here is that these get executed in order?\n. :+1: \n. One cool thing I didn't bother implementing in kernelspecs yet - we could be watching for new kernelspecs all the time and triggering on changes. First boot will be the simplest for us to start with though.\n. Totally!\n. We need to define a story for error display, both for users, debugging, etc. Haven't done it yet, so we're logging for now!\n. It's at this point that I would wonder if the save dialog should be triggered from within the menu before it reaches the frontend. \n. If we block here, it blocks all rendering operations.\n. this is also kind of bad if used with anything asynchronous inline, as the state will not be the same deeper in. Basically, we have to tread carefully until we find a better design pattern.\n. Of note, this doesn't actually exist yet... I just wanted to outline how it could be used.\n. What makes this need to bind to this here?\n...\nOh, because you pass it to the onClick\n. Ok, fixed this in https://github.com/nteract/commutable/pull/18\n. I'm probably just going to toss it and think about it again renewed. It at least helped me understand some issues in handling focus.\n. Heh, just noticed that this uses node-uuid while our package.json is using uuid.\n. This same logic was in here before we refactored how save-as works, I'm definitely wondering how to make this approachable in general.\n. Let's try to make this like the language menu next.\nNew Notebook\n  -->\n    Python2\n    Python3\n. I mean more like doing the logic in the main thread, since the running notebook doesn't need access. Other reason is that on OS X if I don't have any windows open, these menu items still need to work.\n. Semantically, I'm saying we would make new notebook open a brand new window.\n. Ah, I'm seeing now. I thought this was operating on the notebook we just created. Since we don't have something on disk and we need the structure in place for a default notebook, this is the bootstrap.\n. This does make me wonder if we can make the default notebook be an empty notebook, relying on the commutable helper.\n. This misses passing the language_info, that's ok for now though.\n. It occurs to me that we no longer get good autocomplete with the constants being generated directly.\nIf we switch it back to explicit exports, we get named exports to come up complete with type information:\n\n. Cool, thanks for updating the name to make it specific.\n. All about hints and developer experience here. I'm not going to argue either way, I noticed the limitation and pointed it out.\n. Ah yeah, the commutable fromJS and the immutable fromJS.\nWe wrote commutable to have a fromJS so it was familiar, semantically as commutable.fromJS(notebookJSON)\n. fromNotebookJS seems good\n. I'm going to go ahead and say that spawn is a weird name for creating cells, since we use spawn elsewhere in the code base for launched processes/kernels.\n. Symbols don't show up in getOwnPropertyNames, won't conflict with other strings (unique), and are the simplest properties to use in a closure. My favorite introduction to metaprogramming with Symbols comes from Keith Cirkel's blog.\n. The benefit from the constants angle is that it requires us to require the constants directly rather than short-circuiting and hard-coding a string anywhere.\n. This is an unused import now we can delete.\n. Yep! It works by returning a promise for the last element of the observable. This means that you need the observable to complete, done here using .first().\n. Also of note: this function is broken, fixed in #232 \n. The secret to everything here - don't re-focus if focused before.\n. This likely needs to be this.props.focused && prevProps.focused !== this.props.focused, for when the component updates yet is not focused (output coming into another cell).\n. Ah, yeah, I just had a weird flip-back-and-forth behavior between two cells just now.\n. How about\ncss\n.cell.focused {\n  box-shadow: 3px 3px 9px rgba(0,0,0,.12), -3px -3px 9px rgba(0,0,0,.12);\n}\nThat was our old CSS for selected, courtesy @freeman-lab (I rewound the history to ddeb07d0ac6dbeb4a1a1c1bc43c33e7e5ad74f17 to find it as my refactor of src/ ended up making finding it not be so great). It was taken out when the selected cells feature was removed.\n. Could turn this into:\njs\nnotebooks.forEach(f => {\n  launchFilename(resolve(f))\n})\n. that is very readable\n. It would be ok I think to make these be at the top level, since require is going to cache the imports anyways.\n. That makes sense. The current API that I put in place for this in messaging/completion returns a promise though you can also work with the RxJS streams. I'd need to look more deeply at the codemirror hints API to understand the flow.\n. This little tutorial helped me a bit, though I suppose I should dive into jupyter/notebook for an implementation. Gonna head out for a bit, good luck and I'll certainly see you tomorrow!\n. Ah, that makes sense.\n. I wondered about providing a --kernel argument, then realized it wouldn't make sense when you have a list of notebooks.\n. Took this out because of https://github.com/rexxars/commonmark-react-renderer/issues/16\n. This will get overriden by the this.setState from the above store.subscribe though right?\n. Ok that's sweet and simple.\n. I learn much from you, thank you.\n. Our current setup relies on setting innerHTML (as is done via React's setDangerouslyInnerHTML), which means inline scripts don't actually run. I'm not sure about handlers like onload or onerror though.\n. This looks like it will run all javascripts on every render call.\n. :+1: \n. Whoa I didn't know about this command. Thank you.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Ah cool, new button.\n. What happens when the cells are of different type?\n. Would a \\n style newline still work here or do you have to break it apart for backtick strings?\n. Good to cover this case. In addition, we can make sure the button doesn't appear in the UI for that.\n. Looks like the right approach.\n. Alternatively:\njs\nconst source = cellMap.getIn([id, 'source']).concat('\\n', cellMap.getIn([nextId, 'source']))\n. Ah, hmmm. Not sure of the right thing to do. Seems like you'd keep the output of the bottom cell?\n. Stolen straight out of @minrk's extension to the Jupyter notebook. :smile:\n. Since this defaults to anonymous, it may not work for updating unless authed.\n. As name or was there another function?\n. The undo redo stack would also be for cell operations as well, really anything user initiated on the document.\n. You're so right @Carreau. Possible flow:\nPublish\n  -->\n    to same Gist...\n    new Gist...\nUgly...\nHmmm... What if it was in the file menu like this:\nFile\n  -->\n    Save\n    Save As...\n    Publish\n    Publish To...\nWhere Publish knows where you were previously publishing to.\n. Thank you.\nThe steps for a new contributor right now are:\nnpm install\nnpm run build\nand if that same person wants to create a release\nnpm install\nnpm run build\nnpm run dist\n. Ah, cool. If we end up wanting another that chains these together we can do that too. Looking good. Thanks for breaking this down into nice small pieces for us to compose together.\n. If the module only exports using export default function blah() then you can import blah from './wherever'. If it's a named import you have to use the destructuring assignment.\n. Hmmmm.\nThis sounds like a case of not subscribing before sending. The channels require that you subscribe to the one you expect to receive on before sending. I've probably made this more difficult with that initial promise implementation I threw in api/messaging.\n. Where does the send occur?\n. How I eventually got this to work was to take a plist from an application I know well (Sketch), and apply it over here.\n. On a side note, the JS for this is way smaller:\njs\nconst data = {\n  CFBundleDocumentTypes: [\n    {\n      CFBundleTypeExtensions: ['ipynb'],\n      // CFBundleTypeIconFile ?\n      CFBundleTypeName: 'io.nteract.notebook',\n      CFBundleTypeRole: 'Editor',\n      LSHandlerRank: 'Owner',\n      LSItemContentTypes: ['io.nteract.notebook'],\n    },\n  ],\n  UTExportedTypeDeclarations: [\n    {\n      UTTypeConformsTo: ['public.composite-content'],\n      UTTypeDescription: 'nteract notebook',\n      UTTypeIdentifier: 'io.nteract.notebook',\n      UTTypeTagSpecification: {\n        'public.filename-extension': ['ipynb'],\n        'public.mime-type': 'application/x-ipynb+json',\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n};\n. NICE!\n. Pretty slick here.\n. Noticed that data.length is not defined on initial state in the storage, which results in this being false and the state being set to undefined.\nDisco mode.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. I snuck this in here to force a build on run. This doesn't impact the packaged app though.\n. In the future I would use installZMQ() instead of function\n. This binding should be moved up out of render and into the constructor.\n. I suppose this too.\n. Can you elaborate on why this ref has to passed around?\n. Isn't this an action creator though? Wouldn't the reducer be handling the immutable conversion?\n. Now I realize that some of our other action creators use commutable directly as well. Here I thought we wanted the actions to be able to be sent over the wire.\n. \ud83d\udc4d to all this.\n. I never knew about this and CSS. \ud83d\ude27 \n. role is a construct for native menu actions, you'll want to use click instead, sending a menu action onward to the renderer process.\nclick: createSender('menu:run-all')\nAs an example, check out the language menu below this section.\n. You're going to want to rely on cellOrder in tandem with cellMap, because you can't guarantee order of the cellMap.\n. What led you to this binding?\n. I like \"run all\" too.\nWe need to put keymap on the roadmap, if even just to pin down our design of the menu. I'm hesitant to add too many bindings for fear of entrenching a binding we have to support forever.\n. Since the function is not exported / not given as a public API, we don't need to use a leading underscore.\n. You want this in the props change setup too, likely in componentDidUpdate.\n. If componentDidMount is firing all the time, we have another problem. From what you linked, you'll want to add this to componentDidUpdate as well.\n. :+1:\n. End is a bit of a misnomer since this is more like \"sent\", the finish will be later.\n. This function, out of all of them, definitely needs a comment at the top. In context, I know what this is exactly for right now. Later, I'm not sure.\n. \ud83d\udc4d glad to see this out of inline style\n. What's the reason for flipping these? I'm assuming that the CSS vars aren't defined at first, then Chrome resolves it?\n. We're charting into that \"should we generate this\" territory. :wink:\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. This makes me wonder if we should be submitting an action for name change.\n. This is a peace offering to the rest of us using eslint and wanting a consistent style. :wink:\nnpm run lint\nIf you're in Atom, I recommend installing package linter-eslint\n. Should we be checking on the state of channels at this point?\n. awww, don't sneak the store back in\n. > Could not execute cell\n. This check needs to performed higher up, as it's needed by the run all menu option, the cell toolbar, the shift-enter run, etc. It can be a new prop or a context type.\n. Primarily because we're going back to real Redux and can't make this worse before we make it better.\n. Oh my.\n. whoa whoa whoa, what are you doing to disco mode?!? \ud83d\ude1d \n. To try this out, I set\nconst today = new Date('December 25, 2015');\ndirectly in source\n. \ud83d\udc4d glad you extracted this in general\n. Later we can probably refactor this to merge the observable from save instead of doing another dispatch.\n. Note that because we're using transform-object-rest-spread below, we have to have a reduced version of this preset.\n. Our base store is now proper Redux, paired with redux-observable. The way to cancel async actions is through other actions:\n`` js\ndispatch(\n  (actions) => Observable.timer(1000)\n    .map(() => ({ type: 'TIMER_COMPLETE'}))\n    .takeUntil(\n      actions.ofType('ABORT_TIMER')\n    )\n    //actions.ofType('ABORT_TIMER')is equivalent to\n    //actions.filter(action => action.type === 'ABORT_TIMER')`\n);\n// elsewhere in your code you can abort with a simple dispatch\ndispatch({ type: 'ABORT_TIMER' });\n```\nYou're absolutely right about using subscriber.next({ type: 'ABORT_EXECUTION', id }) here. I'll have to update and rebase this PR.\n. We do get access to the store as the second item after actions.\n. Yeah this needs to be extracted as well using .get\n. Update: um, what? store is undefined here\n. This looks like it predates our Redux Observable setup, since store.dispatch is our actual dispatch now.\n. Further update: the store needs to be instantiated properly for both redux and Immutable.js in the test using it. See 5dbb43063f05753eb7051075031b501c7b2e8182\n. This should probably be cleared up higher, before the cell association.\n. We do have a helper for this - isChildMessage.\n. Oh I see, sorry.\n. This means current cellID is the same as the originating message id?\n. These are the ones I wondered about you extracting to a separate PR.\n. Ok, cool. This puts the widget area into its own subsection like the current notebook. Still a bit awkward on the document, though it's pretty much the same setup as we do for the pager here.\n. Any of these that are pure functions use the pure rendering by default if it doesn't use context. You don't need the change for this one.\n. Same with this one, we shouldn't break these out into classes again. Of note: we can now return null in these functions now that we're on React 15.\n. Nevermind me, I've got this wrong I think. Ping @kenwheeler for interpretation of pure functions and whether React now optimizes them for shouldComponentUpdate.\n. \u0ca0_\u0ca0\n. ...observable...\n. ...convenience...\n. This is quite a sweet encapsulation of the widget machinery. :smile:\n. What's the end of this comment?\n. We actually do something similar at a top level too, we may want to refactor that higher up.\n. how is store used here?\n. Derp me, it's retrieving the message id by cell id. Thanks.\n. Hmmm...\n. We should still have the defaults broken out I think, so we're not mixing what's configurable and what's not.\n. You too sneaky.\n. This should probably be a more user-visible error, using the notification system.\n. Should probably be state && state.metadata && state.metadata.get('filename')\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Check out the markdown cell tests if you want to see some action handling. You can get pretty sweet tests out.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Careful using statSync without a timeout. If someone tries to use this against a file that's on a network share (likely on campuses, corporate networks), the entire application will freeze waiting for the response of the stat call.\n. Rather than write these two functions, I'd check out https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp using its async filename generation.\n. Hmmm, this looks like duplicated logic between the main and renderer process for launching a new window.\n. Ah, going back to it now.\n. Interesting, I had not checked out a React component for a context menu. I was planning on using the context menu and events. Using React for this should prove fruitful!\n. It's ok to do the logic here for now and then add it to commutable.\n. I'd look to the markdown test to see how to test these two keyboard driven functions.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. I'd make this changeCellType, though that's a small nit.\n. Nice and simple, I like it.\n. Ditto here on the naming. CHANGE_TYPE --> CHANGE_CELL_TYPE.\n. For the opposite case, the outputs and execution_count keys be deleted when going code -> markdown.\n. It would be nice if this operated based on from and to. When from === to, this function returns the same notebook. Otherwise, the cases down below happen.\n. To clarify, from would not be part of the action. You'd pull it out like is done below.\nconst from = state.getIn(['notebook', 'cellMap', id, 'cell_type']);\n. Note that I tossed the kernel arg since we weren't even using it.\n. This should be ../\n. This one seems a little bit off.\n. One reduction we could do, if not too expensive, is to see if the notebook tree has changed.\n. That is, derived instead of computed.\n. We can dig into these ones later, since they impact the code itself.\n. https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/no-string-refs.md\n. https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/no-find-dom-node.md\n. @kenwheeler contests this one, will take airbnb to the ring to duke it out\n. This one I adapted for one package that had a single export. The other will likely follow.\n. This propagates to the final copy?\n. Weird, I thought I trimmed these pip installs out and stuck them in the travis_before_install.\n. These ones are ok since it's a Record (or so I think...).\n. This is the line the linter is warning on (two spaces then an =).\n. We could always make this part of the execution epic to close out I think... Then again, maybe this is the same as when we clear outputs.\n. Something strikes me as odd that we would create the widgetManager on every render here.\n. You could just make the widget ones explicit here too.\n. We need to figure out the right path for doing this, otherwise this subscription is going to stay open forever. This really needs to get managed by the epic or otherwise.\n. I hope the promises here are mostly an artifact of the underlying jupyter widgets machinery.\nIs there a good guide for me to read on the comms architecture if I want to start taking a stab at a new version of the widgets that is more Observable based?\n. Normally you'd close things up in the close callback, which is the third argument - order: (next, err, close).\n. I'd look to the execution epic for this, as the way we handle new channels is to close the previous observables for each cell when the right action is seen .takeUntil(action$.ofType('NEW_KERNEL')). \n. This setting should stick around (otherwise lots of false linting errors will come up).\n. Do we need to e.preventDefault() here so that copy and paste doesn't do the normal thing too?\n. Yeah, subscribe takes three arguments - the first is onNext, the second is onError, the third is onClose.\n. still need to bring the settings back here\n. The cell allows the output to be any size it wants to be. We can set it explicitly here like you said.\njs\nrender() {\n  const { data, layout } = this.props.data.toJS();\n  const style = {}\n  if(layout.height && !layout.autosize) {\n    style.height = layout.height;\n  }\n  return (\n    <div style={style} ref={(el) => this.el = el} /> // eslint-disable-line\n  )\n}\n. Testing the action creator will increase coverage in a pretty simple way here (pretty much a copy paste of other action creator tests).\n. If you use a similar test to the Markdown cell key handling, you can check to make sure that this function gets called.\n. This can be mocked with a fake dispatch to ensure it generates the right action.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Heh.\n. Nah, I'm giggling because you had to update our hidden themes. :)\n. Mega \ud83d\udc4d \n. What's this part?\n. :cool:\n. Love it when bugs are uncovered in testing. :smile:\n. Slick. :bow:\n. :smile: :100:\n. setGithub is an action creator (redux parlance). It returns a plain object that gets merged into the state tree for everyone.\nHere it takes the GitHub auth object and creates proper action format for setting our GitHub context.\n. The observable that epics return must emit redux actions like that of SET_GITHUB\n. Thanks. :)\n. It's actually synchronous because it doesn't do the auth call - just storing it for later.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. This could probably be decoupled a bit more - this is doing two things:\n- Setting the title based on filename and execution state\n- Dispatching a saveAs\nThen you can test those side effects individually\n. Where's the setTitle check to make sure the title was changed?\n. Either use the .catch operator here or use the error callback in subscribe (it's the second one).\n. You'll need to use the done parameter in the callback to it above to take the Observable approach.\n. >_____<\n. Thanks! Funny we both decided to test this one right now.\n. typo here: somehow an i got introduced after the r, making ri. I'm guessing.... vim\n. Excellent!\nWe should probably link to a help page for this too. They need a next step so we don't leave them lost.\n. Note: users that run the app from the Dock or Finder can't actually see these console.error messages. They get gobbled by launchctl. You'll need a full blown dialog.\n. We may want to point to a page with common kernels in the future so we don't hold on to our Python bias.\n. Yeah, I'd actually move this code to our own toJS helper, maybe with a file named:\nnotebook-model.js\nnotebook-memory-model.js\nOk, I'm out of ideas for naming here.\n. There's one way to do it! This must be new.\n. Thanks for digging deep into these options.\n. Ah, great!\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Oh wait, this ripped out the formatting for nested views that R spits out. Can you add this back in?\n. :+1:\n. :)\n. Woo!\n. This should likely be cased off by process.platform === 'darwin'\n. What's this count part?\n. Can you not JSON.parse it?\n. Since this is browser side, you could use document.querySelector to get more specific with the element and what you want to extract.\n. Next steps to follow up on (for this and later tests):\nApply the take operator to the observable from createPagerActions:\njs\nconst pagerActions$ = createPagerActions('1', msgObs).take(1);\nThis is so that the observable \"finishes\" (otherwise it would stay open forever). This will make more sense at the bottom of this comment.\nCreate an Array of the actions\njs\nconst actions = []\nThen the three callbacks to subscribe should get fully used:\n\nonNext - should push each action onto actions\nonError - should fail the test (errors should not happen here)\nonComplete - pass done as the callback\n\njs\npagerAction$.subscribe(\n  (action) => actions.push(action),\n  (err) => expect.fail(), // Should not error\n  () => {\n    // In reality, you want to verify each action within actions\n    // Since we used `take` though, that's kind of silly.\n    const action = actions[0]; \n    const expected = [{ source: 'page', data: { 'text/html': 'this is a test' } } ];\n    expect(action.id).to.equal('1');\n    expect(action.pagers.toJS()).to.deep.equal(expected);\n    done();\n  }\n)\n. We can leave it as localhost for now, but we should probably do https://oauth.nteract.io/github.\n. Look at all this cleanup!\n. Our assumption now (based on the default state) is that if they don't set the token and they publish, it goes out as anonymous. We can figure out the other flows later.\nWhat I'd like to see is:\n- Publish to Gist will authenticate if not, then publish the gist\n- Publish to Anonymous Gist will let you always publish with a fresh publish\n. This thing is going to get really hairy with models, I highly suggest keeping it together in its own segment.\n. The linter made me do it.\n. ~~Feel free to open a PR to do so.~~ All set then now that it's been merged.\n. Alright, use https://nteract-oauth.now.sh for now while we wait for DNS name servers to propagate since I switched us off CloudFlare.\n. This definitely highlights that the code hasn't been run through here. We can test handleFormattableMessages and createSourceUpdateAction (with replace set) in another PR.\nHowever, this does make me notice something we can abstract (if you feel like it) -- we can provide a helper that binds the id as the first argument (or you can bind it directly):\njs\nfunction bindById(id, func) {\n  return func.bind(null, id);\n}\nThen we can .map(bindById(id, updateCellSource)).\nHowever, you could also:\njs\nreturn setInputStream.filter(x => x.replace)\n  .pluck('text')\n  .map(updateCellSource.bind(null, id));\nand not worry about a helper (we don't really need it).\n. Yay, thanks for doing this!\n. Please set these up like the review/instructions in the pager actions PR so that we make sure no errors are happening.\n. This can and should be tested as part of this PR - follow the action creator tests from other action creators. It seems simple, which only makes it more necessary (in case of changing APIs internally).\n. This one can be tested with a mock like this:\n``` js\nconst dispatch = sinon.spy();\nconst store = { dispatch };\ndispatchPublishAuth(store, {}, 'TOKEN');\nconst expectedAction = { type: 'SET_GITHUB_TOKEN', githubToken: 'TOKEN' };\nexpect(dispatch).to.have.been.calledWith(expectedAction);\n```\nYou'll need the chai sinon boilerplate that's in other tests.\n. For this one, you'll want to mock github.authenticate using a sinon spy.\n``` js\nconst mockGithub = sinon.spy(github, 'authenticate');\n// Call into the reducer with your action\n// TODO: Code here\n// Check that your spy/stub was called with the right args\nexpect(mockGithub).to.have.been.calledWith({ type: 'oauth', token: 'TOKEN' });\n// Check that the state set your new github object\n// which means you'll need a sinon stub instead\n``\n. These are super solid in that you're able to keep the widget state and views as Immutables. I was wondering if this was possible.\n. Ah, I see you started making an epic as a plugin here,  cool.\n. \"Message that has content which can be converted to nbformat (e.g. display_data)\"\n. I wouldn't use the word dispatch here, sincedispatch` goes with redux which we are certainly using here. Maybe \"emits\"?\n. Let's call them Observables since that's what they are. The name stream I started using to make the variable make sense.\n. Return type can be:\njs\n@return {Observable<Action>}\n. iopub and shell are both Subjects, created like this:\njs\n/**\n * Helper function for creating a subject from a socket\n * @param {jmp.Socket} socket the jmp/zmq socket connection to a kernel channel\n * @return {Rx.Subject} subject for sending and receiving messages to kernels\n */\nexport function createSubject(socket) {\n  const subj = Subject.create(createSubscriber(socket),\n                              createObservable(socket));\n  return subj;\n}\nWhen you chain off of it (not shell.send), you're applying functions to create new observables/streams.\njs\niopub.filter(x => x.header.msg_type === 'awesome') // Rx.Observable\n. Complete mind-shift: \"Observe all the reactions to running code for cell with id\"\n. \"to be dispatched as a redux action\" - since there is zero dispatch - it's intended to be consumed by the user via redux-observable.\n. Hopefully this doesn't dilute this too much - these observables can still be used with @philpl's https://github.com/philpl/redux-fluorine since they emit actions.\n. This should be Observable<jmp.Message> or jupyter.Message if you prefer.\n. Looks like you've handled it already. :smile:\n. This should probably have\njs\n@see https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_description.html#code-cell-outputs\n. I'd use their username instead of their email address.\n. Relying on an environment variable for authenticated is a bit strange here, I need to look into the intent soon.\n. You can do all of the analytics loading as part of a dynamic epic or another way with the redux state tree, coordinating using ipc on launch. Then we don't have to duplicate all the code in the html below and startup can be faster.\n. How icky would it be if we converted this plain value to \"stdout stream\".\njs\n{\n  parent_header: executeRequest.header,\n  header: {\n    msg_type: 'stream',\n  }\n  content: {\n    name: 'stdout',\n    text: value,\n  }\n}\n. Then we'd simply fold this observable into the ones that get nbformatted.\nWhat doesn't please me about this stdin setup is that it doesn't appear to map cleanly for multi-user cases in the future, while the rest of our model here could run server side (/main thread).\n. These two lines need to be re-indented.\n. Does this fire more than once then?\n. Awesome, thank you for the comment as well. I can barely do CSS, so I like learning from others.\n. That's probably fine. prepublish is a likely candidate, but I don't know the lifecycle/order for electron-packager. If it's working, lets go with it for now. I'm assuming this doesn't run within the dist copy - anyone doing an install is in dev mode.\n. Excellent\n. While I'm a fan of this, what are we re-doing that's already done in electron-rebuild?\n. Love that you left this open for styling directly.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. With tests too, next level! Thank you.\n. chores can also include linting\n. The important distinction with these is that fix and feat are the prefixes that we use to create changelogs (other prefixes are ignored, which means they can be anything).\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. I'm assuming you did this to appease the linter.\n. Took me a sec to remember why this has to determine the static path.\nIt would be good to include a comment here about why.\n. Yeah, we'll figure out a way to refactor this after.\n. If you want to suppress the linting warning, you can do:\njs\n(ref) => { this.stickyCellContainer = ref; }\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Took me a second to recall why we set the focus cell on unmount, then I realized it's about bringing focus to the unpinned cell. We should probably leave a comment here to that effect.\n. See note below about how to get around this linting warning without disabling it for the entire file.\n. This action name doesn't tell me well enough what it is (other than the context of this PR). Can we make it \"setConfigKey\" and SET_CONFIG_KEY here?\n. A+\nWe could rely on readFileObservable for both save/load notebooks and this one in one file. How about creating fs-observable.js in the same directory?\n. Why have a top-level config key in the JSON file? Assuming you change it to the file itself being the raw config,  this can be switched to a simple map:\njs\n.map(configLoaded)\n. We so need to figure out our error story in nteract, how we'll do these flows.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Oooh, good plan on the merge.\nSemantically, we should change this to MERGE_CONFIG as the constant unless we're directly setting.\n. It's ok if we do this after the PR, just something to note that seems clean to abstract (and you know I hate over architecting abstractions).\n. Wow, this is pretty easy to declare with flow (you're paving the path for most of us, it's new to me).\n. Interesting - is there a type on the React.Element container that folks end up declaring?\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. I'll bet this can be of type HTMLElement\n. Would it make sense to make the type here be Event?\n. Oh wow, that's crazy. I guess the nice part is that we already have the Props declared at this point so passing them on isn't too bad.\n. Superb!\n. Why are we having to load config here?\n. Resolved.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. I have a feeling this gets tested as part of the notebook load epic, so when you do the refactor after this will be covered.\n. Same thing here for saving.\n. This whole block inside the switchMap can be brought out into a function for testing.\nIt's basically action -> loaded config testing\n. These all map to React Components, which can be the big ol' classes or the stateless function.\n. Also, uh-oh, we're totally going to conflict in https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/928.\n. annnd maybe not, looks like we'll be good to go after CI passes\n. @captainsafia already merged and it looks like we're ready to go here!\n. We'd probably need flow-typed install here too I presume?\n. Oh! This should also be npm install flow-typed, flow-type is a different package.\n. According to the linter, we somehow have to import Cell from './cell/cell' as well as import type { CellProps } from './cell/cell'; on one line. I'm not even sure how to do that with the type construct added on.\n. We... could probably remove these methods. This is the top level notebook component.\n. Wait, wait, the folded diff threw me off.\n. I'll check this component out directly, I'm having trouble looking it at it through an old PR.\n. After reading some more of the flow docs as well as how these get stripped out, I'm beginning to think that maybe we ignore this line with\n// eslint-disable-line no-duplicate-imports\nThese imports get stripped anyways, as stated in the Flow FAQ:\n\nWait, but what happens at runtime after I\u2019ve added an import type declaration?\nNothing! All import type declarations get stripped away just like other flow syntax\n\nTurns out that there's an open issue for this in eslint-plugin-babel: https://github.com/babel/eslint-plugin-babel/issues/59\n. Which... reading some more, it looks like we could use eslint-plugin-import...\n. I'm so happy to switch to the electron namespace - we'll be able to clean up some linting config because of this (minor).\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. This should probably be console.error(stderr)\n. Would it make sense to move the if (err) to the top of this callback?\n. Why use ImmutableList instead of just List?\n. Awwww, ok.\n. Ohhhhhh, that's the native Map type which we don't use here. We want people to use immutable data structures for everything regarding state.\n. To match the Chrome menu, I'd make this \"Actual Size\"\n\n(I didn't notice this until a second ago)\n. New commits are fine, we don't need things squashed here.\n. Would you want to tackle the test for this? There should be a similar test for dispatchZoomOut you can borrow from.\n. By the way, feel free to find me in the table area in the Atrium at PyData DC.\n. Awesome thing we can do here:\njs\nexpect(setZoomLevel).to.be.calledWith(1);\n. I just merged this, but you can make another PR if you like.\n. Above this, I would put #!/usr/bin/env node\n. We definitely don't want to case here, it needs to come in as application/json.\n. Without the #! line in the script, this needs to be \"diagnostics\": \"node scripts/kernelspecs.js\".\n. Rad.\n. Wow, this was definitely some next level work here. Stellar.\n. Somehow we're going to need to map to our CSS variables so that styling happens via CSS, even if translated here. Not for this PR though, we can figure out an approach later.\n. This should likely be false right now, or it needs to check on the theme (similar to how the Leaflet one works). this.props.data won't change (because of how the Jupyter messages currently work).\n. According to their docs, these are also class names. I'm happy to play with that after we merge though.\n. \ud83c\udf89 \n. Thanks.\n. Do you want to keep these constants in the constants file or in the epic?\nI lean on the side of keeping the constants in epic module, for the sake of future monorepo. Either way, one set needs to be deleted, and all references need to point to just one.\n. :smile:\n. Now that you've come this far, it's probably about time to extract this arrow function out to a named exported function so we can unit test it. \ud83d\ude04 \n. > Unfortunately coverage is going down because this is succinct code.\nIt's this function that is dropping coverage (nothing touches this).\n. Yup, epic is good. Just delete the ones in the constants.js.\n. Well it is true that this is way more succinct and clear. Top notch stuff here John.\n. Uh oh, now you're finding our wartiest code. :wink:\n. @peggyrayzis do you know how I'd specify this monitor with Flow? It's not an exported type from react-dnd yet is in the flow-typed repo (I also have no idea which monitor this is at first glance). \n. Yeah, I've run flow-typed install. I guess I'm not sure how to \"require\" it?\n. This one isn't covered by the tests and should be a quick and easy action creator test.\n. Use enzyme's instance to get the React Element then run this function.\n. This looks pretty testable as a reducer.\n. This is pretty awesome. I wonder if we could do something where it doesn't scroll unless you focus on it too.\n. Well we need to focus some efforts on exporting these components for external use soon anyways. I'll have look here in a moment to see how the npm release flow can work. We can always create tags manually.\n. Wow this is great.\n. \ud83d\ude04 \n. Well done with the cross platform setup here. How did you know which belonged to which menu?\n. You'll want to use __dirname to resolve the absolute path to these notebooks.\n. js\nconst path = require('path');\nconst exampleNotebooksDirectory = path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', 'example-notebooks');\n. Awesome!\nOne tweak, make sure to use path.join when creating the path for the notebook:\njs\nlaunch(path.join(exampleNotebooksDirectory, 'geojson.ipynb'));\nThis allows the notebooks to load on Windows too.\n. I just realized we should probably make this:\njs\nconst exampleNotebooksDirectory = path.resolve(path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', 'example-notebooks'));\n. should this end with .parse(process.argv.slice(sliceAt))?\n. Not even the parse?\n. Ah, ok.\n. With the monorepo + lerna stuff, we'll end up having N package.jsons.\n. One thing of note here, this should be of the form:\ndescribe(...\n  it(...\nwhich would also make it easy to skip this test by changing it.skip. I wonder if the lack of it makes it so it's not an individual test.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Nah, I can delete that.\n. I'm guessing you didn't mean to commit this file.\n. I'm beginning to think we should carve out fs-observable as a library to share across these.\n. Depending on what this is for, the behavior you want may be mergeMap. What's SETX doing?\n. Ah, are you wanting to SETX each of these environment variables in sequence or in parallel?\nI would probably do:\njs\nreturn Rx.Observable.merge(\n  spawn('SETX', ['PATH', `${envPath}`]),\n  spawn('SETX', ['NTERACT_EXE', exe]),\n  spawn('SETX', ['NTERACT_DIR', rootDir])\n);\nIf I want to run all of them in parallel.\n. Yeah that sounds good, we keep needing these across the project. I was hoping to use something for checking if a file exists when doing startup as well (so we can create a new file).\n. Instead of switchMap, I'd use flatMap/mergeMap. switchMap has a particular meaning with new items in the sequence, running the inner observable here.\n. This is awesome, well done.\n. existsSync is the one call that is faster than the async version. :smile: Don't worry, I skimmed right on past that one when I saw it - it has a history. :wink: I'm happy about the undeprecation.\n. The prior stream is returning parsed JSON data, so you'll want to turn this into:\njs\n.map(configLoaded)\n. As for testing these, you can write a sinon spy for each of the functions on fs, including existsSync and unlink.\n. If the file doesn't exist, we regard it as already gone/deleted?\n. For writeFileObservable we don't need to send the data on (or so I think), since we only have to write it to the file.\n. Ok, just double checked the other usages of this and we tend to throw away both args. Returning the filename isn't bad by any means but we don't need to bring this potentially large data around (like with notebooks).\n. \ud83e\udd14 Hmmmm, well we can always see how we use this in practice.\n. Incorporate the feedback from @willingc in https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/995#issuecomment-253535469 here too:\n\nIt wraps up the best of the web based Jupyter notebook and embeds it as a desktop application. Now, you can open notebooks natively on your system. Double click on an.ipynb file to open and begin using the notebook. It Just Works\u2122\n. You may enjoy using backticks (like a code block) and using literal spaces in markdown instead of &nbsp;.\n. We probably need a caveat here since I think we've only registered the filetypes on OS X.\n. Yeah that would be good.\n. I like that the keys for code cell and text cell are next to each other. I'm a fan of this. \n. I thought this part was going to fail CI then I saw that the NEW_CELL_AFTER code uses a null id as well.\n. yep!\n. This makes me want to move example notebooks to a separate File -> \"Open Example Notebooks\" so we don't have to nest the default.\n. That would be great. I'll go ahead and merge this as well since it's solid progress forward.\n. Setting it to false for now?\n. I mostly left it out to provide flexibility for you later. Otherwise how will you prompt for it in the future?\n. If I leave itundefinedor set it tonull`, when you implement the metrics setup again you can check for nulliness so we're not missing all the early adopters.\n. Scary name to keep!\n\nTis ok for now though.\n. Welcome! \nIt's all good! I too used to be more a Python and C person. The javascript has absorbed me ever since I realized I needed to do more of it to express the ideas I wanted to. :smile:\nFor this PR, I wouldn't worry about knowing if a notebook successfully loaded. We can't actually know from here without more event handling. I think that's out of scope for this PR. \nSafia wants you to move this function call over to src/main/launch.js as well as adapt the way it's called.\n. Bye bye HACK!\n. This should move out of the launch function itself. It applies to all BrowserWindows and only needs to be run once, after the require.\n. This does leave us open to allowing the user to get to dev mode if they want to, without having to run off master. Alternatively, I could move this to the devdeps inside app/package.json.\n. Ooooh, nice.\n. If you make the store the first argument you can create this anonymous function earlier and bind it:\nconst boundHandleGistError = handleGistError.bind(null, store)\nThen pass boundHandleGistError to the catch.\n. This highlights something important which is that we could be propagating these errors up as actions.\n. Yeah, before the actions of type pary\n. Why err here?\n. Since this comes from a remote, I'd wrap this in a try catch block.\n. Since this component is flow typed, I'd make the arg here be el: HTMLElement\n. This could return document.body.scrollTop instead of undefined.\n. Also, since this is now out of context I'd put the JSDoc in that includes a description of the return.\n. This needs checking now that scrollToElement can be set to undefined. You don't want to set that on the DOM.\n. This should be number in the type for return, not a big deal though - can be done in a follow up PR.\n. It looks like we never get to this case in our tests. Is there a way to reach it?\n. Oh yeah... this one... the main reason that we need to move more over to the main process...\n. A+ commit message here\n. The only problem with this is that it's a global spy, which means that once anyone calls it \"calledWith\" will be true.\n. I'd set up the spy in each of these functions that need it (still making the mock require in the other file) by doing\nspy = sinon.spy(fs, 'unlinkSync')\nYou can then disattach the spy at the end of this test.\n. Ah ok. We can iterate after.\n. You can just return Observable.of here. I would also include the error similar to our other payloads so this is easier to debug/deal with.\n. js\n.catch(error => { // <-- This one\n. You would make this:\njs\nObservable.of({ type: 'ERROR_SAVING', payload: error })\n. If they're in this fail state though, would an npm install really save them?\n. We'll probably want to verify the arguments passed in later.\n. Did you move the catch up for easier testing?\nTheres a semantic reason to catch on the inside, which is specificity. It doesn't look like it matters here though. You could also test this simple observable error action creator\n. That would not be overkill, depending on how it's used.\nCool things you can do with Rx's catch (unrelated to this one):\n- Return an observable that retries the entire observable\n- Try something else entirely as an observable\nSince this one is only reporting the error directly (and generically), it's fine to be moved out like it is now.\n. Should we do this check in the code for the path helpers?\n. \ud83d\udc4d Mega thank you.\n. :smile:\n. Rockin.\n. This belongs in the createGistCallback doesn't it? You don't want the complete to run before any next.\n. This makes me wonder if our channels object should have the session. \ud83e\udd14 \n. Can also use hasIn here.\n. You can use hasIn here.\n. Could we label this one \"Analyze nteract download metrics\"?\n. While not a big deal, we could switch these to remove (it's an alias in ImmutableJS).\n. Woo for simplification. Could easily test this one by the way -- it's a single observable that creates an error.\n. Could just use handleGistError here now that you don't need it bound.\n. Missing a comma right here which causes tests to fail.\n. Heh.\n. This still runs the prestart (which invokes a build) so we want to keep this the same (except without the app line).\n. This file will still need to exist for the released copy, yet pointing to ./lib/main/index.js.\n. Yay for back in one package.json!\n. This is my favorite test that I've written in this code base so far.\n. Great, if we don't need this anymore then sweet!\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. I would go ahead and generate the sessionID here so it's generally available with the channel rather than needing to propagate it with loading files in general. If we have a new kernel, we have a new session.\n. s/code cell cell/code cell/\n. Comment I'd love to see here if the check for code isn't on the same line for the filter:\n// Only run on code cells\n. :+1:\n. Good naming here.\nHowever, I'd do this setup and tear down in each it block or use a beforeEach.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. ...when given one (?)\n. I realize now this wording probably came from other text I put in saying \"X with message given\". The when threw me off I think. I was about to merge, wasn't too big a deal to change.\n. I'm guessing this comes from https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/issues/988#issuecomment-14921785\nThat thread had a lot of discourse.... This needs to be in the state tree somewhere, we can't have module-level singletons. Reasons:\n\nFor codebase style, this goes against our flux principles\nFor testing, you can't assume that the module is in the same state. Every single function in here now has access to these variables as part of the module closure.\nFor modularity reasons -- you can't use this module now to publish multiple gists with one single page app; every single notebook document would have the same gist ID and gist URL\n\nAs for what to do, rely on the state tree to set these, even if they're transient data (not in the notebook tree). What was the problem with the metadata field inside the notebook? It's also the one used with @minrk's gist extension.. In this case, in tests, I think it's fine to repeat the setup code for the beforeEach and afterEach.. Ok, this is better.\nI'd walk through the user expectations with this, listing out different scenarios and the events you expect to see.. Should probably delete this comment.. We still need these though right?. Sounds good, let's go with the trim down.. I think we should show a notification if they haven't set the filename by saving. I'd rather they be able to choose where to save it than making a default.\nOther related feedback for this filename extraction:\n\nsomething.r.ipynb would become something.pdf - use path.basename to extract based on .ipynb at the end:\n\n```js\n\npath.basename('something.r.ipynb', '.ipynb') + '.pdf'\n'some.file.pdf'\n```\n\n\n~ as part of the filename is not a good default on Windows and may not always resolve correctly. If a user misses the notification, we're also overwriting the same file over and over\n. Love this extra touch with the notifications to let them open the PDF.. I would probably write two functions, one that takes the store and one that takes only the filename.\n\nThis should be able to stand on its own as a function that prints-to-PDF the current file. The store adapter around it encodes our business/state logic rather than it being part of the exportPDF function.. Since this is used by an event handler, this error will either not be seen or thrown at a global level. It would be better to show a notification.. One thing you may want to do is to have this function accept a callback rather than do the notifications in here (to make it easier to test).\njs\nfunction exportToPDF(filename, cb) {\n  ...\n  remote.getCurrentWindow().webContents.printToPDF({ printBackground: true }, (error, data) => {\n    if (error) {\n      cb(error);\n    }    \n    fs.writeFile(`${filename}.pdf`, data, cb);\n  ...\n}. :+1:. \ud83d\udc4d . Improved!. Excellent handling.. This swapping of arguments scares me (need to make sure all calls to it are updated). I do prefer this store, action ordering you have here as its consistent with our other functions that include the store (which doesn't change, allowing for bind and partial usage).. \ud83d\udc4d . This is the only segment of code that is not tested, should be a pretty simple one to test since you just verify that the structure conforms to missing the one field in metadata.. Looks like you've updated these appropriately. :smile:. Good thing there are tests!\nYou named the constant DELETE_METADATA_FIELD in other sections, you'll want to update that here.. To make sure this test is actually doing something, make the initial document state include some metadata.\njs\ndocument: monocellDocument.setIn(['notebook', 'metadata', 'name'], 'something')\nHint: this test should fail based on what I noted above about the constants.. Woohoo! Thanks for cleaning this up.. Ah, we must have had a sneaky dep that had lodash as a dep. I'm ok with us including lodash in general, especially since we can use lodash-webpack-plugin.. Great to delete these since they're largely unnecessary copy paste.\nIf we wanted to trim this down more and not create new arrow functions these could also be:\njs\nclick: launch.bind(null, path.join(exampleNotebooksDirectory, 'intro.ipynb')),\nThat or use a partial.. Yay for getting rid of findDOMNode!. Looks like it!. _.merge and Object.assign are not the same - _.merge does a deep merge of keys which we need here with this spec merge.. Ah good a cleanup from an old refactor.. Not really. This did make it a lot easier to work with. I'm a-ok with lodash because of how it's maintained and how I don't wish to maintain utility functions within our package (unless domain specific).. Oooh much better form, great!. Based on the the usage docs for es2015-node6 preset, do we need to use es2015-node6/object-rest as the preset?. :smile:. Neat, didn't realize this would work so well with React synthetic events.. \u2764\ufe0f  that you documented the packaging for everyone to read and contribute to, thank you. probably mean /opt/nteract here. \ud83d\udc4f . Should these have a leading /?. Can this be lowercase?. Can this also be lowercase nteract?. Is there a category for Analysis?. I can't wait until we can get rid of our implicit canvas dependency. Alas, I think we would have to repackage plotly.js for our own use. :man_shrugging: . Oh wait, plotly no longer has this as a descendant. It's vega that does.. Looks like an ar that isn't meant to be here.. Where do the id come from, Immutable.js?. Ah ok. pager.id is undefined here - it looks like they were using that for illustrative purposes. In our case here because of how outputs and pagers work (outputs do not get reordered), the array key is fine.. Yeah that's the intent with using this in tandem with a vdom style mimetype like we talked about over screenhero. This component is only here for debugging/utility.. That's a good idea.. It's ok for cases like these if we only turn it off for this section or file, adding in a comment as to why.. This handles the case of an initial render, you'll still want to do a setProps after this first expect.\n```js\nconst toolbar = mount(\n  \n);\nexpect(toolbar.text()).to.contain('Convert to Markdown Cell');\ntoolbar.setProps({ type: 'markdown' })\nexpect(toolbar.text()).to.contain('Convert to Code Cell');\n```. \ud83d\udc4d . I'd split this off in two:\n```js\n const kernelSpecsPromise = prepJupyterObservable\n    .toPromise()\n    .then(() => kernelspecs.findAll());\nkernelSpecsPromise.then(saveKernelspecs);\n```\nThen make it so saveKernelspecs doesn't have to return the kernelSpecs.. Super cool!. The send should go after the on is registered, just in case the response happens before the registration.. Amusingly, this was python2.8 here on purpose so that it would not exist to ensure we're testing the right thing and mocked properly.. This line is not covered by our current test suite.. This line is not covered by our current test suite.. @captainsafia do we want to be persisting outputHidden to the notebooks or is it only for at runtime? The fact that these get cleaned up on load seems like we're currently:\n* Setting metadata on the notebooks\n* Saving with the metadata (woo my hidden setting is acknowledged)\n* Resetting them on load?. When a user is using this, it must be getting hit because otherwise cells would stay fixed in the prior order. \ud83e\udd14 . Ok, cool thanks for clarifying it! This helps me see why these are being set to false here. It isn't to wipe out what the user may have had set in the notebook, it's for the structure to be available within this cell when rendered. The colocation of the data here is for our internal use (it makes sense to have it as part of the cell), and not persisted to the document.\nNext steps as we start refactoring state to scope is to figure out if we:\n\nKeep state like this colocated with the cell, initialize on load, delete/sanitize before save\nCreate a separate state structure for transient-at-document-runtime (as opposed to the current transient which is transient-by-kernel-runtime). > there was some discussion about persisting arbitrary (not defined in the notebook format) values\n\nIs this a feature where we should persist them and use our own prefix:\nmetadata: {\n  \"nteractOutputHidden\": ...\n}\nWe would definitely be on the hook for maintaining this as our own spec (including migrations in the future).. Where we've run into issues before with not conforming to the spec was when keys were set above metadata, which does allow for additional properties.. I've submitted a test that covers this now, it seemed important enough to make sure we reach it with enough edge cases.. These are void returns with necessary side effects. \ud83d\ude09  I can add some on.. Added on some return types. There was one with a Promise<undefined> which I switched to Promise<boolean> (it was only there to signal completion).. If we pin exactly we'll be alright.. Had to double check this was inside @media print first. :wink:. Yeah there's zero UI for it, we can bring the reducer back later.. I think I can go ahead and delete it for now and we can iterate on this together later if you like.. Yeah, reported it there too since it wasn't clear to me it was mutative from the docs. https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/1339\nAmazing what you can find by having your objects be frozen in advance. :smile: \u26f8 . Yeah I'll put in a comment here. This relates to how the data passed in is frozen yet we need to create a mutated copy below (and aren't using the Immutable.JS structures in here anymore).. Done.. Room for coverage in these thrown errors.. Same here for covering thrown errors.. I totally forgot I did this! \ud83d\ude04 . Yeah I kind of skirted this for now.. I suppose so?. The part I was unsure of here was whether the Electron app itself would have to be a lerna package in order to use this namespacing or if we need to do a massive multi-package transpile before the webpack build.. That's right! I also really have no idea what I'm doing so we should keep feeling this out in case we should do it a different way.. Hmmmm, I definitely don't want to get rid of our subtle animation cues within the notebook.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/11131875/what-is-the-cleanest-way-to-disable-css-transition-effects-temporarily leads me to believe we have to do a bit more work to straddle this print CSS case.\nCan we go with only the print media for now and work on a longer term solution to the in-between-states?. I'm happy this got moved out.. This portion is one of our remaining untested parts, I should probably extract these to functions afterward to test. It would involve a lot of mocking I think though.... Probably a good one for us to test that is currently not covered.. Wow it's great to see that this is where it comes from. I've been annoyed with the 4 spaces when I'm working in a Javascript notebook. We should probably case this off based on language (or see if CodeMirror provides defaults per language).. Here's an untested section we'll want to extract (possibly).. At least for Python we need to ensure it's at 4 spaces for PEP8 compliance within notebooks (our primary user base). At the same time, I'm largely more and more of a JS user within the notebooks, so we should have something sensible for those.. I've been meaning to move the main.css stylesheet up for a very long time. Thanks!. Neat!. We shouldn't be relying on this.context in these components. Perhaps we could pass down what the cwd is?. As in from a top level.. \u2764\ufe0f  this is definitely moving along. <base> is an HTML Element that specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document, it's not a React component. With the power of React though, when the filename changes, so would base's href and thereby the interpretation of all relative paths.. Yeah I was thinking that since we're doing webpack anyways we could make sure the base assets are loaded first. The ones that are gunked up in the little prototype I showed was only the theme css (which can change).. If you want this to be covered, you could probably do:\njs\n'Shift-Tab': editor.execCommand.bind(editor, 'indentLess'). That or use lodash's partial.. This will be a stopgap for us until the next lerna release (which will probably be today).. You had me a bit worried when I saw the commit before your comment.\nThe component you've added Base into is supposed to be a disconnected component, in line with #1288.. Excellent!. This makes me think we need to complete when the spawn also exits gracefully. Is there another event we should add a callback for?. Looks like both disconnect and exit should be handled - https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_event_exit. I assume you meant 'disconnect' here.. We totally can, I'm hoping we can transition to the built versions of all of these so that we straddle both the electron app publishing and npm publishing.. I think I'll counter that with adding some tests here. \ud83d\ude09 . Might as well, I can switch that. The reason I usually tend to do it is so we're explicitly picking what we want to export/maintain, to ease semver.. I badly wanted to use snapshots here. Problem I ran into was that I needed to do native DOM operations so I switched to the enzyme instructions (which ended up being the same as our original test). Ever used create-react-app? That's your hint.. Yeah I think this happened because I created this package with create-react-app. I'm not intending to ship this app, it's only a demo.. Worth noting that the reason notebook-preview-demo can use yarn is that it's an app that can be deployed vs. the libraries which must employ pure npm & semver.\nThe real reason that the yarn.lock was created was because I used create-react-app to bootstrap this and it noticed I use yarn. I'm going to delete this yarn.lock file.. I had trouble mocking one function from complete here so I've skipped this test for now.. I just modified the animation they provide with the boilerplate.. \ud83d\udc4d  That's our trick for now until #874. \ud83d\ude04 . The order of the arguments looks a bit strange to me here, subscribe's arguments should be:\njs\nsubscribe(onNext, onError, onClose);\nFor now you probably want to only use onNext to create the node on response.\njs\ntool(channels, editor)\n  .subscribe((resp) => {\n    const node = document.createElement('pre');\n    const text = document.createTextNode(JSON.stringify(resp));\n    editor.addWidget(editor.getCursor(), node, true);\n  });\nNote that the response comes in async, we probably don't want to add a widget if they've moved the cursor. We can fix that later though.\nAs for rendering inline with React here -\njs\nconst node = document.createElement('div');\nReactDOM.render(<Something />, node);\neditor.addWidget(editor.getCursor(), node, true);. Woo!\nLooking forward to this, UI definitely seems a bit tricky here.. This is looking pretty stellar so far.. Since you're in here working with these, what do you think of the current CellStructure that has both cellMap and cellOrder? I've begun to wonder if we should solely have cellOrder and nest an ID into the cell (that would not persist to disk).. Wow these are pretty pesky. I definitely like the current v4 nbschema better!. Perhaps we should call this VALID_KEYS since it's verifying all the keys.\nOr wait, it looks like there's an explicit check for metadata, output_type, and prompt_number. Could take them out of this list then.. Something I can't completely recall from how I did the v4 version - was it only display data that was kept as a frozen object rather than Immutable? (I'll hunt to find out after posting this).. One nice effect of having the module.exports being explicit here was that we could see everything that was exported. Of course... I realize I shifted us away from our original style so :100: for bringing it back.. Looking slick here. Should this do notebook.worksheets[0] since it's stripped off at the end here?\nThis also looks like a section that should have some bounds checking so we don't access [0] when it doesn't exist.. Turns out that doesn't matter because we didn't have JSON types in the display bundles before, so it wasn't a big deal.. Mostly just uncertainty from me. The other way around this for safety sake is another flat map like you did with [].concat.apply([], .... This was the annotation I added to make this work, I'm not sure why it though this was a number as it's mapping over the object keys Object.keys({'a': 'adsf', 'b': 'basdg'}) ---> [\"a\", \"b\"]. Note: this function here is not used, and is a carry over from the conda kernel stuff.. Note that the bin here is for the conda environment (admittedly, this should be\njs\npath.join('bin', 'python'). \ud83d\udc4d . I'm particularly interested in if this can be stored whenever this.props.schema changes (including the first one). This reduction is called quite a bit in my cursory look at this.. In fact, this overall structure should become normalized and then used as:\nvirtualGridData[rowIndex][this.schema.fields[columnIndex].name]. What's up with these tabs?. Could you add an intro to this document that says something about GeoJSON and needing IPython 6? Something like:\nWith the release of IPython 6 (coming April 2017), there's a GeoJSON display class that allows you to visualize GeoJSON data quickly.. I was mostly curious if this was being introduced by nteract in some way. My primary concern is that if someone copies this code they may end up with mixed space types which are a cause of disaster in python..

Here's the line that actually changed for fellow reviewers.\nI'll be making another PR to finish off our transition to prettier.. Instead of creating a new class, target this with:\n.cell-toolbar > div\n\nIf I had to guess, @carreau set this up so we could do media queries for touch screens to show a toolbar like in this mock: https://github.com/nteract/mocks/issues/15. I agree, I prefer the horizontal toolbar on my mac.. There's nothing available to catch this error -- it should likely be dispatched so that the user can see it failed. Otherwise you're getting into undefined handling by electron.. Then again, I see that's the default from their docs. For our case though, we'd still want to log it, which means dispatching an error action.. The fact that we're changing the document and putting it back asynchronously (depending on how long it takes to printToPDF) has the smell of race conditions. The only way I can think of to make this better is to make a separate document that gets printed (using the same state tree). \n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nAt any rate, what you've done here is great. Thanks for doing this.. I'm really happy we're bringing this in because I'll be able to do readonly mode of codemirror for notebook preview :soon: after.\nThere's a lot we can clean up from this original source.. Yeahhhhhh definitely.. This should probably be a fully qualified name like nteract-display-area-stderr . If we ever want coverage here, we should have a test for the traceback. Then again, our jest tests are not connected to our overall coverage. \n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. excellent, this is exactly what I was hoping for.\nWe'll also set up ansi-to-react to not handle carriage returns inline I assume?. If you view it as a terminal, the terminal keeps track of its internal state and can get carriage returns without a newline while waiting for the newline character to show up.. This is only intended for at-runtime right? We still want to end up with text/plain for the notebook format.\nAlso... text/plain won't get additional text. New display_data are wholly distinct.. Smart.. Yeah I'm definitely liking this approach, it's handling it as it gets it.. Fixed it!. Yeah I'm thinking we should make the interface for transform modules to effectively be:\njs\nmodule.exports = {\n  component: ActualReactComponent,\n  MIMETYPE: 'actual/mimetype',\n}. Interface wise then I'd assume it would be like this:\n```\nimport * as JSONTransfrom from '@nteract/transform-json';\n// JSONTransform.component\n// JSONTransform.MIMETYPE\n```\nUnless there's some better way to put static properties on React classes and declare those as a type. I suppose we could extend React.Component even though people don't recommend it.... Perhaps we keep the default export actually and do this instead for the import interface:\njs\nimport JSONTransform, { MIMETYPE as JSONMimetype } from '@nteract/transform-json'. Objects are good here -- we'll be able to tightly declare the structure.. Ok, I can take a gander at this.. ooooook\nThe reason I did it is because I updated a definition and the prettier plugin automatically formatted it. After that I went \"eh, why not do all of them\".. You no longer need this call since you use toJS below.. Given what I've figured out in https://github.com/rgbkrk/electron-protocol-play, I'm going to move this to the main process, creating a template instead of our current index.html. It's going to be nice and clean. :smile:. I lied and am making a terrible mess of things. Since I need to clean this up I'll have to visit it again later.. Sweet!\nOne caveat though -- sometimes the remote module disappears so you'll want to require this dynamically and wrap it in a try catch.. require('electron').remote.app.getVersion()\nshould be good to go for now\nThen again... maybe it's because of our webpacking that the weird behavior of remote intermittently not being available.. Where does this one come from?. Oh hmmmm, perhaps we need that in main.css then?. Those are all easter eggs. :smile:\n:warning: the undefined theme may not be safe for people sensitive to color flickering. It was put in place to notice a certain class of theme related bugs for humor.. The Christmas and Halloween ones only come up during certain times of the year (and it would be ok if we had more). undefined has only one way of coming up, though you can enable it using the ~/.jupyter/nteract.json file. :wink:. > I'll add an Indian holiday soon if I can come up with the colors \nThat's awesome!\nBy the way, I'm trying out packaging of the app again to prep for another release.. Note: you can have notebooks with zero cells. The edge case should be handled, possibly by the caller of this function.. What if we bumped this amount up higher? It does currently allow for a pretty big buffer at the moment without having to have another element.. Oh I see you did handle it. Never mind me.. I just tried using the style you used in the special element above as the padding here calc(100vh - 110px) and it works quite well.. ohhhhhhh, in that case there's one more thing to add to the top level:\ncss\n@media not print {\n  .notebook .cell-container:last-child {\n    padding-bottom: calc(100vh - 110px)\n  }\n}\nThat way we're only targeting the non-print view.. If we do dangerouslySetInnerHTML, it will create those DOM nodes on mounting. They have to be removed before we create the document fragment.. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . It took me a sec to recognize these were under the print stylesheet segment. \ud83d\ude04 . It was using just fine logic when this was using Immutable.js. sort now needs to return -1, 0, or 1 because it's a regular js sort. This was making all outputs end up as text/plain.. It was really hard not to precompute these, which makes me want to create a real class for the displayOrder and transforms (which would likely be mutative for adding in new mimetypes or replacing old ones).. These are the extra definitions I snuck in on top of what was in https://gist.github.com/dperetti/d44379562fb656a5cf39f57ab6cc28f4 (as of https://gist.github.com/dperetti/d44379562fb656a5cf39f57ab6cc28f4/085e30aed7ed055cf2ae5d00f75342a44c64aa05). Typically with network latency (remote deployments, crappy wifi) and with slow kernels (Toree, other JVM based kernels) this comes up. What makes matters a little bit worse with nteract is that we do typeahead instead of tab complete. CodeMirror seems smart enough to ignore it if the cursor is not where the suggestion is though, with my limited testing.. I hope webpack bundles this as a constant so it's not a pain point on the built app.\nActually... wait a second... I think this is available via an Electron API. \ud83e\udd14 . Why did this change? Oh! Because the built file is now at lib/webpack-main... right. \ud83e\udd14  I wonder if there's a way to reach these assets in an idiomatic way in electron.. This reminds me that we need to make sure to include this specific module in our files array for electron builder.. I had no idea you could do this with webpack!\nI wonder if they could/should share the vendor bundle (mostly to deduplicate RxJS).. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . Yeah not a big deal, we can come back to optimizing that part.. Ok, great. That addresses a comment I was going to make on another one too (the splash).. It does help with debugging. Then again we can always add it into a released copy into the packaged app after we want to some debugging. Doesn't help in the moment though. I'm on the fence here, leaning towards no source map in production release.. Cool, this paves it for the others to override if they want to.. Thanks for making these fairly specifc.. We don't want this to call the objectToReact function repetitively (since I know that our components are not very perf optimized). Seemed like a simple quick check.. Here's where the papermill metadata gets passed through (if it exists in the notebook).. When a cell's metadata.papermill.status is set to running, we display this \"banner\" above a cell.. @jayphelps is there any way to pick up addons to the prototype for Observables? maybe I should handle these differently?. rxjs-fs covers a much larger surface area (that we wish was available here), while also having some nice helpers. I'm not sure we'd be ready to take over with rxjs-fs, especially since it really needs to be brought up to RxJS 5 (https://github.com/trxcllnt/rxjs-fs/issues/2). Happy to coordinate on that!. At this point in time I can't focus much on our desktop app which extends to not needing to do much on this module yet. I think I'd rather collaborate on yours, as well as generally learn from you. An initial glance at the rxjs5 branch makes me pretty hopeful.. For the external reader, \"can't focus much on our desktop app\" means \"desktop app doesn't get as much love as the current web app bits, I'll be back to doing more for desktop :soon:\". :smile:\nWe could probably just make ofMessageType be a function that takes an observable and the message type, returning an observable.. Now that we're on next.js, it's probably not too bad to build notebook-preview-demo. No big deal here though.. Oh whoa, thanks for catching this.. That was totally me spelunking to figure out why things weren't configured right. I'll put that back together.. \ud83d\ude05 . At least it's explicit here for now. :smile:. Wow this came out way simpler than I expected, if a little indirect.. I was thinking it would be better to do this in the reducer for SAVE, then I realized that by doing it as a result of successful save we know if it actually saved. Brilliant!. You won't need this here since this was just something we passed through to enable our embedded JS kernel.. We really need this to get merged successfully in with the user's default python if they happen to be the same path as you'll want the notebook to point to the right kernelspec in the document (here it would identify as python_nteract). I'm trying to say that if this kernelspec is exactly the same as their python kernelspec (by name -- folder on disk, key in the overall kernelspecs object here).\nHowever, I'm thinking that naming it by env and only populating it when we know we're launched from the terminal may be a better approach (see below).. oops. I can't seem to figure out why the tests are not noticing our custom observable operators. I'm hoping to switch us over to lettable operators soon: https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/doc/lettable-operators.md. I was going to fix this! Guess I'll do a follow up. \ud83d\ude09 . Seems alright to me. Nice.. I may not totally understand this part.. I'll have to remember do that. \ud83d\ude09 . Is this at the base level or into what's now the nteract package that's deep inside our tree?. Doesn't it look it up by tag? I feel like it's ok for the name to get updated.. True true. We do need the tag though right?. I'm ok with merging this if it's working on your mac if you make the conditional process.platform !== 'darwin' || !process.env.TERM (or you can DeMorgan's Law this and do !(process.platform === 'darwin' && process.env.TERM)). \ud83d\udc4d . This is looking so good, thank you.. These are so good now.. Wow do I love the lettable operators, these come out so much cleaner and look way easier to refactor for the future.. This very well could... It won't affect commuter since we load this css explicitly later.. Yeah it makes it useful when working on the desktop app, because webpack only has to rebuild the source we're changing here (instead of Rx + React + everything else).. It's also useful on the web app too, and is primarily here for developer experience.. \ud83d\udc4d . Nice, glad CSS imports can work here and that webpack will handle them.. Oh wait, now I see. You're introducing the css here. This does enforce that users of this component are using the webpack css loader.. Oh cool, this takes all the css imports and creates styles.css.. Is this because I ended up copying in what we needed for tableschema into here?. Rockin'. We do need flow-bin here for when we install new dependencies into this package. It has to be installed at this level in order to run the flow-typed install (though the flow definitions do end up in the right spot).. Yeah that sounds good to me.. Super slick, gotta love webpack. Thanks @TheLarkInn and pals.. Ok, cool!. What a superb idea.. I've got a funny feeling about this not being a require statement, though I can't recall why.... Maybe it was pre-webpack days that this not being require'd was odd.. Good catch. Yeah, this would also fix up the current flow error.\njs\n  inputProps={{ className: \"react-tagsinput-input\", placeholder: \"Add tag\" }}. I would probably make this be tags instead of to, to be explicit.. Since pretty much all the metadata setting reducers are exactly the same, it's really tempting to make a SET_IN_CELL_METADATA action/reducer pair, where the utility functions like updateCellTags only returns the metadata data change update:\njs\nexport function updateCellTags(id: CellID, tags: any) {\n  return {\n    type: constants.SET_IN_CELL_METADATA,\n    id,\n    path: [\"metadata\", \"tags\"],\n    value: tags\n  }\n}. You don't have to worry about it in this PR, I'm thinking we can trim a lot of boilerplate in this repository now.. Amusingly, I think we could probably make a reducer that's literally setInState. It would miss a lot of error checking though, so maybe the highest granularity we could do is:\njs\n{\n  type: 'SET_IN_CELL',\n  id: string,\n  path: Array<string>\n}\nThat loses type information, though I suppose at the point of that reducer, perhaps we have enough context to know if what we're doing is \"safe\".. Heh.. No, I'm sorry. Also I think it's cool if we stick in a static version thing here.. \ud83d\ude04 . Makes sense to me here.. As I was scanning through the code I did a double take here, only to realize that if I would have commented about this in the first place it would have been quicker to read through.. \ud83e\udd14  Should we make a TOGGLE_IN_CELL action? It would always be a bit flip for boolean fields.. I'll fix this up, thanks for noting it.\nI coupled a bit of my concerns from #1970 here, as I've been hoping to get rid of the constants due to a flow limitation. Last I checked, flow interprets the type of type here as a string rather than the explicit literal. When I was doing a bunch of the flow typing for the reducers and action creators I ran into this issue and was hoping to fix it. The other reason I wanted to break away from a constants file was so that it would be easier for us to export the reducers for the web app (some are electron specific, some are not).\nIn the interest of consistent readable code, I'll get this into the constants.. Since we need to know the value at action creation time, I think it won't be able to use the SET_IN_CELL machinery. I can make a follow up PR for that tonight!. \ud83d\udc4d . There we go, this is great!. There's a current flow error here, you'll want to set this to React.PureComponent<CellProps, *> . Yeah. We should have @betatim follow up on this one with snakestagram.. Sharp! I see why this has to be redone on focus, show, etc.. I look forward to us reacting to new kernelspecs and changing the Menu as a result. I wish our API (internally) for this was:\n<Menu>\n  {bunchaMenus}\n  <ViewMenu />\n  <KernelMenu kernelspecs={kernelspecs} />\n</Menu>. \ud83d\udc4d . One way you could make this testable is by accepting the store as a variable and letting it default to using the global store:\njs\nexport function loadFullMenu(store=global.store) {\n  ...\n}\nOr exporting a bound and unbound version.. Yeah I can do that and I think I'll clean up some comments that are in here too.. I'm a little confused about how this code isn't covered. I thought our messaging tests were running through the jest apparatus and that codecov was getting these. Any ideas @lgeiger?. Ok, this is the commit you should all see. Look how clean and declarative this is. \ud83d\ude04 . /cc @captainsafia @lgeiger . How is this being reported as not being covered (it's a test that jest targets)?!. Smart!. Excellent.. I'm glad you kept the original catch in here too, since the case I wanted to make sure was covered was during the ReactDOM.render which is called at the root level while this local catch here makes sure that React.createElement goes properly.. I'd be happy if you made this PR only the vdom stuff, since we can handle the individual cases separately.. I'd put a componentDidCatch here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/packages/display-area/src/richest-mime.js\nSince that's the rendering spot for any generic transform. I'm guessing you can trigger it by putting in junk data -- json when it's expecting a string for example with the image transform.. To get this to pass flow, you'll want to set the function signature to:\ncomponentDidCatch(error: Error, info: React.ErrorInfo) {. This should be:\nreturn this.componentDidCatch(err, \"\");. Running through why I made some changes...\nThe default export on React should be preferred here.. Actually maybe I shouldn't have changed this one.... I wanted to have a consistent type here, I imagine we'll move these into a package we use across the overall app.\nI wonder if we could/should use these types directly: https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/2b3592331efd4b41f19de521528f664b870393e5/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberScheduler.js#L70. Amusingly my next commit completely counters that by making RichestMime be an error boundary itself.\nMotivation:\n\nSimplified testing around the one component\nSemantically, we care about a single output that doesn't render properly in that we can take other actions based on this (scrubbing it from the notebook, reporting errors specific to this, etc.). Since React 16 is pretty new, I think they wrote out ErrorBoundary as a concept when really there's only one new lifecycle method -- componentDidCatch. The way I'd probably shape this after is to list the offending mimetype, data, etc. since we can give more context right here.. The reason I put these in at the top level (with no transpile) is so that we can write:\n\nimport actions from '@nteract/core/actions'\nwhile allowing tooling (including webpack, node) to resolve their choice of mainField, whether they want our opinionated ES6+flow or fully transpiled code.. console is an arg so that we can override this for tests (or even cause a different path for this side effect).. This is one of the dummy notebook usages that I need to extract to a separate package.. Ooh that\u2019s a great idea. I can do a follow on PR later for this.. I think originally @jdfreder set this up to make it so some of the initial state could get passed into this store creation, abstracting around it a bit. I'm thinking this could probably be deleted and any code that is using it should be refactored.. welp, now I've found more to clean up from the old utils folder. (in trying to find more uses of the dummyStore, I found out there was some utils code that still didn't get deleted). Wow, this gets used a whopping once:\n\n. annnd I'm thinking I'm just going to keep it since I don't want to adjust all the config right now.\nI think the dummyStore should take in an object that can be merged with the defaults for the state.. Just a note that these are some of the old sinon based tests that still need to be moved to jest. I mostly just made it work here and broke away the implicit dependency on jest within the core dummy package.. When the user doesn't use a token (by setting token=\"\" on the Python side), what does this end up doing? Does the Jupyter server still take it?. I ask because I absolutely don't know. Thanks for diving into uncharted territory for us here. \ud83d\ude04 . Also in notebook-preview-demo, showcase (and commuter externally).\nI should make sure this can work without the top-level babelrc. It was just easier to place it at the top and ensure our babel setup was consistent across components.. I was extremely scared of the fact that they're not really the full Cell and Notebook components yet, when right now desktop is using the \"old\" notebook.js.. At some point we need to put styled-jsx back at the top level, after we have hoisting back in place (yay for yarn workspaces #2039). The main reason is that there is flicker on load when there is more than one version of styled-jsx on the page (even if the same version, as with non-hoisted lerna they have an independent version).\n\nI could also make the lerna app do hoisting as is for styled-jsx.... I'm tempted to provide an optional onClick to our next gen cell or at the very least access to the element directly. What do you think? We also use the ref below.. This should possibly just be React.Node. We just have specific behavior inside the render method that uses when it's a raw string directly.. Oh thanks for looking at this one, I totally forgot about it.\nIt will be my first look at including print stylesheets for styled-jsx components... I wonder how  :global will work there.. When we start using the components on nteract.io, I think we'll see some of these tradeoffs and hope no one tries to print our site out. \ud83d\ude1b . I also included some missing defaults from #2069.. Inside this component we only ever use cellMap and cellOrder so this reduced the amount of this.props.notebook.get('cellMap') that was going on. At some point this file should probably be re-named since the nextgen components have their own <Notebook /> container while this one is more like <NotebookApp />. This is the original code so I left it as is. However, I think that this likely misses some of the resizing it would need. I'm not fussing with it though. I think the real solution is some proper CSS that would adapt to the changing size.. Oh whoop, I snuck this one in. I can make it another PR, it's just cleaning up what ends up being only one field in use.. I'm the one that put this in as a partially complete implementation (that isn't even referenced locally here). I'm also the one that's happy to remove it. \ud83d\ude1b . Yeah I don't think we need this class anymore, I'm looking to remove all the unused divs here and end up with the same styling.\nFor the line wrapping, I'm curious if codemirror itself has an option to enable it instead, which we'd override per Markdown and Code Editors.. ohhhhhhh yayyyyyyyyy\nwell that's about to be 8000x times easier to deal with now. I think I can delete this whole defintion here. Yay for soon to be sane styles.. This one is for you @betatim!. /cc @alexandercbooth -- I made a bit more of this inline React. I think we can do even more with a React Portal. I aimed for \"just work\" for now. Would love to make the styles nice and easy here while also having clean DOM ops. \ud83d\ude04 . I kept getting an error for this import after a clean rebuild. Definitely need to finalize this refactor so it\u2019s not doing a deep grab of an unsupported API.. Yep, this is pretty slick.. Whoa, I didn't know you could get straight at the source like this. This turned out way more simple and easy to understand than I expected!. One thing you might want to do for testing this is to make a non exported or slightly hidden function that can take shell, control, stdin, and iopub. Then you'd have a Subject that you can send raw JSON objects through to make sure they get the right envelope.. ```js\nfunction mockSocket() {\n    const sent = new Subject();\n    const received = new Subject();\n    return Subject.create(sent, received);\n}\nconst shell = mockSocket();\n...\nconst mainChannel = createMainChannelFromChannels(shell, control, stdin, iopub);\nconst messages = shell.pipe(first()).toPromise()\nmainChannel.send({ 'type': 'SHELL', body: { 'a': 'b' } });\nexpect(messages).toEqual({'a': 'b'})\n```. It's either that or extract the exact functions you want to test on the inner piece.\nI think my example test could be way simpler, I'm mostly pulling from an old test here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/996cc702fa66b4066b7f48a4735fdd631f439230/packages/editor/tests/editor-spec.js#L19. Since this will definitely open up sockets if not mocked underneath, this should be closed down at the end of this test.. The fonts themselves I'm unsure of what to do about when I do the <base> changing. Guess we'll see here!. \ud83c\udf89  Hoorah! :tada:. The top level jest config uses a different setupFiles and it's the global one, so the enzyme adapter configured in test-setup.js isn't showing up in the npm run test:coverage run:\n```\n  \u25cf CellCreatorView \u203a has create text cell button\n      Enzyme Internal Error: Enzyme expects an adapter to be configured, but found none.

What's up with sticking an adapter for react 15 in? We only use 16 in here right?. I wonder if now that you've moved things to the top level if it's the dual configs conflicting now.. This should be react 16 here I think.. Oops, yes, thanks!. No real rationale. I used the API surface from [another implementation](https://github.com/minrk/thebelab/blob/master/src/thebelab.js#L234) and when I wanted to inject a dependency I just tacked it on. We could still make this part ofoptions`, it's totally fine to change it now. Want to make a PR to bring it into the options object?. That's very true.\nSince it's the README, I left it being super explicit purely to be demonstrative. I tend to find I have to explain less / answer less questions if I pass a declared arrow function rather than pass a function by name.. Old habits die hard. \ud83d\ude04 . Yeah, these could be unified now and the comments can be merged together. When I first started on this I made failed do an observer.error only to realize that the failed message should really be part of the stream (and up to the user to handle).. This overrides the defaults that RxJS sets up for an XMLHTTPRequest, including setting some headers that for CORS Jupyter does not accept.. Oh wait, I should remove this since it should get set from the call / setup in our serverConfig.. This should be deleted.. The node based library for url was not getting properly imported with webpack, so I used this \"polyfill\".. Oh yeah, let me dig into that. It seemed like I was running into an issue with EventSource not liking this be bound with a different this.. That\u2019s exactly it. setState takes a callback for when the state is really updated and rendered. Since I wanted to stay within this async await setup I used a promise to wrap around the callback.. node's new Date() serializes to an ISOString whereas browser implementations can differ. Explicitly using toISOString is much wiser here.. This matches the parent element's height and in desktop is basically a no-op due to other CSS. Here in play, this makes it fit the page.. This allows our multiplexed websocket subject to pass the message straight on the through. Coming to the desktop / raw ZeroMQ version will be routing based on this.. I look forward to nuking all the sessionInfos here due to better Subject handling in Rx-land.. Gah, our prettier hook got rid of mixins rxjs$Observer<T>. ref: https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/3390. This was unintentionally increasing the size of the bundle since it was bringing in all of Rx.. I deleted createChannelSubject as it was not providing type safety given that createSocket takes an enum for CHANNEL_NAME. All the usage switches to direct calls of createSubject(createSocket(...)) now.. All these comments for internal functions for creating subjects are overkill with the flowtypes in place.. The merge creation method is different from the operator I think, but I'll check it out.. It is ever so slightly different, though it does use the operator for mergeAll under the hood: https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/src/observable/merge.ts#L83. What was the reasoning behind using .source @captainsafia? It works just fine to use the raw shell as is since they're observables. Was this for purity around returning only an Observable or am I missing something else I should know about?. To cut down on globals (as was evident for how we did sessions and usernames prior), I'm doing like I did in rx-jupyter which is to set the header before the message reaches the socket.. I have no idea, seemed odd and there weren't any uses of fs anywhere else here so I made this consistent with the rest of the time we use fs. This whole file needs some re-engineering to handle the lifecycle and state as part of our epics + redux setup so we're managing the state well. I've gotten this to get into funky states before and it's tricky to debug since it happens on close.. Yeah I'd really love to find out if there's some event the socket has when it's really up that we can track / check.. Oops! I'll fix that up.. Thanks!. I just realized we can add \"ipc\" here.. Ok, I've put in some backchannels for now while working on this PR to help me see what's available on the sockets. I think we'd have to set up zeromq monitoring to be really sure, as the connect events and other events only get propagated when zeromq monitoring is set up. I also have no idea if it's a good idea.. Wow does our unified channel setup simplify a lot of tests.. TODO: Rely on one type definition of Channels from enchannel.. TODO: Make this a high level message for @nteract/messaging. TODO (probably not as part of this PR): switch these tests to jest and put them in the right place organizationally.. TODO: Delete this test since it now gets covered below.. TODO: Describe how to use this script to use enchannel headless. I suppose this slightly belongs in an examples folder.\nTODO: Delete or fix the repl script.. TODO: Clean up all these socket.on that are unused.. Done.. TODO: Now that all our enchannel setups plug in the session info, we can remove all this extraneous SessionInfo gunk.. Took this out to switch to pure jest tests and take out this fake bit of non-test with mocha.. Goodbye direct channel access, hello multiplexed everywhere!. While trying to get all the tests inline here I noticed a promise rejection that wasn't breaking tests but certainly needed to be added in (use of dialog via electron.remote).. At some point, I'd love to have a TestSocket that is this implementation as part of a new enchannel-test-backend. We'd probably want the current multiplexing exported from enchannel-zmq-backend.\nOr maybe it should just be an event emitter that emits the multiplexed versions as is. \ud83e\udd14 . Switching to jest, yay!. I'm pretty unsure of why I had to update these snapshots midway. Didn't work otherwise. I'm guessing there was a change from a dependency we rely on and a fresh Travis install was noticing it.. All these message creators are much simpler now that you don't have to cart around the session info (and developers using this can always set the session info themselves if they want).. These can and should be deprecated now that this PR is wrapped up. Will make sure to do that before a release.. I'm soooooo happy this module global is gone now.. enchannel is not much of a package (again). I wonder if the mock / test setup I mentioned above belongs here or elsewhere. Perhaps it's time to retire the \"enchannel\" name and just call enchannel-zmq-backend \"multiplex-jupyter-sockets\".. Oh hey I should delete this, I'll do it now.. Brought these in to make doing integration tests easier, since we need to launch kernels and interact with them.. At some point I want to visit doing the shutdown with a proper epic + actions combo here as the nature of shutdown is asynchronous and has multiple dimensions:\n\nIf it was requested during closing of the app, we need to allow the app to close at some point. This is perfect for managed events with Rx.\nIf it was requested and a new kernel is coming up, we need to only close out the old kernel.. The intention for play is to provide a http://jsbin.com/ like experience -- code on the left, outputs on the right. The binder image is the dependency behind the scenes (as is the kernel that gets launched). We don't want to do the full binder experience, as people can go to mybinder.org for that.. I'd bubble the onSubmit up to a passed in prop:\n\n<form onSubmit={this.props.onSubmit} />\nYou may still end up having a handleSubmit if you want to do any cleaning or normalizing before passing it up to the parent component via the callback prop, so it's also fine to keep handleSubmit. I just wouldn't make handleSubmit do anything to the page.. I'd use a <fieldset> and a <label> here for each of these in keeping with the accessibility of plain HTML forms. I can help style them if they feel hairy to work with, CSS wise.. We're going to want to keep this as a \"controlled\" component, so I'd use value={this.props.ref} and not use defaultValue, while also setting the default prop for value.. When exposed as a prop use a leading on -- onGitRefChange, onRepoChange, onSubmit.. Follow up to above comment about the naming patterns. Here it will look like:\njs\n<BinderConsole\n  onGitRefChange={this.handleGitRefChange}\n  onRepoChange={this.handleRepoChange}\nYou can still use handle locally. The common practice on props is that you'll lead with on. This makes them match the interface for pure DOM components too.. I think you're going to want to make this run this.initialize() so it does the kernel lifecycle too.. To be a bit more explicit, don't use <p> here, use <label>. Then group the <label> and the <input> in a <fieldset> like this:\njs\n<fieldset>\n    <label htmlFor=\"repoInput\">GitHub Repo: </label>\n    <input id=\"repoInput\" type=\"text\" name=\"ghrepo\" defaultValue=\"binder-examples/python2_with_3\" />\n</fieldset>\nMy general rule of thumb, for the sake of making sure to accomodate accessibility, is to always use elements that describe their intent by being those elements. Screen readers know how to treat those, the tab behavior gets naturally handled by the browser, other accessibility tools know how to work with them, and quite a bit more that I have no idea about as a non-expert in a11y. While I'm not super worried about accessibility, I prefer to do the light easy steps when I can.. Perfect!. With a test too! You're awesome!. oh gosh I just realized the folly of a package named @nteract/core -- github will now mention that team directly... I'll... go ahead and change the core team name.. As soon as you see a pattern like this, you begin to see this should be a different set of components altogether.\nI think we're going to end up wanting to make this:\njs\n<Drawer>\n  <BinderLogo />\n  <BinderForm onGitRefChange={} />\n  {/* Note that I'm not reciting the exact props, just that these should be split up at some point */}\n  <BinderLogs logs={} />\n</Drawer>\nI think it's ok to bring this in, but we should probably change this soon so we're not doing too much in this one component.. I repeated this on purpose to make sure that at the top they get directed right away to the desktop app (the original purpose of this section). This second section is here to not break the old links to Installation---Users.. Yeah I like that. I kept the old text and just moved it up here. We can change it up.. Since I can't change the current npm run build to take extra args in a simple way, I think we'd have to try a new command name:\nnpm run build:only -- packageName\nWhich under the hood would be defined as:\n\"build:only\": \"lerna run build --scope\". can do. If you have lerna installed, it does. Since currently I'm the only one that can publish the desktop app (due to certificates), I haven't dictated everyone install lerna globally. We could switch these to the $(npm build)/lerna setup though.. Removing this section since you're definitely right and we no longer have to worry about the version number update here.. ah this is definitely one that could be adapted to the singular lib:watch like we've done. The es5 is an old carryover. No special things here.. Note that above here prebuild (which runs before build) does an npm run clean. Since you changed clean to build:clean you'll have to change up the prebuild above here (that's why the build is failing).. Odd yeah, that's the only one doing it. Seems like you could remove it. I think this predates when babel wasn't creating the lib folder for us IIRC. I think it can be taken out.. total nit, but I'd prefer to have this as build:watch:only, noting that I'd read it as \"build watch, only for packageName\":\nnpm run build:watch:only -- packageName. I'm not seeing this className anywhere above. Is this supposed to be for the <option> in KernelOption?. You can move the kernelspecs import down into the other rx-jupyter import (and it would be ok to switch the below to import instead of const.. \ud83d\udc4d I think this is good for now.. I just noticed these need to be cleaned up since we're not using greenkeeper and the repo for this package is nteract/nteract.. This link needs to be a relative path to the ROADMAP now.. These instructions need to be changed for the new development setup.. Since I ended up having to switch gears to do the jupyter server extension, this probably serves only as an aspirational statement.. Note: next.js, which we're using underneath, is planning to add support for designating a prefix to mount an app on. We'll need that as a prerequisite here.. URL needs to be fixed.. Same here.. Now that these repositories are joined, we should probably make a package that is possibly only types for Jupyter standard APIs (message spec, notebook format, HTTP requests and responses). That or make it part of @nteract/core.. Since these were deleted, we should clean up the gitignore.. Delete this comment. Also, I think the type can be React.Node IIRC.. After this PR we should move these octicons in with the ones we have in core. It's probably time for @nteract/octicons. \ud83d\ude04 . This probably isn't the case now, I should double check this.. Can probably clean this one up too.. Now that I see these types again, I think it's ever more important to extract these types. After this PR is merged I'll make an issue for it.. $CleanMe. Fix the URLs in this package. I think all this CSS can be deleted now.. TODO: Switch to the @nteract/transform-plotly package that now supports this same functionality well.. Buried deep within this PR is an update to @nteract/transforms to provide default props to the JSON transform. \ud83d\ude04 . We should be able to delete all the fontawesome here as we're using octicons now.. Note: I started doing this then realized that the commuter version uses a version of plotly already on the page (as a global).. Doing this one now!. Oh man, these are so outdated now but way easier to implement.. All awesome here.. We definitely need to spend some time writing that build-your-own-repl tutorial over with the new API, so I guess we can flag that as an issue to tackle. I think we can leave this paragraph as you've worded it for now.. I'd add on that it makes it easy to iterate on applications that share common components. As an example, when we update the our jupyter message handling, if we were changing it for the desktop app and happened to break it for use by play.nteract.io we would notice them in tandem.. \ud83d\udc4d . Whoa didn\u2019t realize you could mock in-line in a test. Goodbye dependencies!. Rockin. Getting more and more trim. We probably need the last two commands to run in parallel.. \ud83d\udc4d . Goodbye old themes!. I'm going to miss Pumpkin Spice most of all.. Should we bring these into our styled jsx themes by creating new CSS variables for the scrollbars?. Yeah I'm thinking we should port these over with new vars.. wooooooo, almost there. We still need app:commuter to do the lerna run dev command, as it should run the app locally for us.. \ud83d\udc4d . The lerna bootstrap symlinks and installs all packages.. Oh really? I didn't realize that.. We should provide the fallback values for these from the light theme.. var(--cm-background, #fafafa). var(--cm-color, black). var(--cm-variable, black). var(--cm-variable, black). var(--cm-string, #a22). var(--cm-builtin, #077). var(--cm-builtin, #077). var(--cm-number, #3a3). var(--cm-keyword, blue). var(--cm-comment, #a86). var(--cm-link, #3a3). var(--cm-meta, #555). Ah yep that\u2019s exactly what I was expecting.. You should be able to put literally these into a <style> block. I also removed pretty much all the normalize too.. ahhhhh. I think many of these can be simplified (if in the @nteract namespace and using the same directory name) to:\nmodule.name_mapper='@nteract\\/\\([^/]*\\)' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/packages/\\1/src/'\nPerhaps it means we should switch everything to the @nteract namespace and make it consistent?. Oh cool are these fixed now?. Oh thank you for exporting these for use.. Looking good.. Do we not need these ones then?. \ud83d\ude04 \nI was tempted to just make these separate packages, this works quite well though!. Ah yeah I think I just deleted the print media queries for our use here when I first vendorized.. \ud83d\udc4d . I like that they lightened this a bit. \ud83d\ude04 . The correct flow type for an Object is Object. Instead of changing it to that though, I made these inferred types. When we use Object, it's basically a catch all for any object with any properties. Using the * is also a catchall, however it will be informed based on our usage. We can still make a more explicit type here too. Not particularly pressing though.. Since we rebased (hurrah :tada:!), we can rely on the proper flow type for ofType here.. I didn't dig far into these, as I was primarily just making sure that the types were all set here. The editor implementation needs to have more defaultProps set, as well as allowing these functions to not have to be passed. For now, I made it work as is and didn't muck with editor (setting up defaultProps and figuring out how these should be used should be a different PR).. Since our channels format is now the same between desktop and web apps, enabling completion is a \"simple\" matter of passing the currentKernel.channel to the editor and setting ctrl-space to autocomplete.. Ah yeah, we're going to have an interesting set of choices to make for the app records since the desktop and web versions will probably need different app states. Something to figure out in the future though. I really like the entities approach that is on the current play PR. The sprints were really good for shaking out some new approaches to our overall app handling. \ud83d\ude04 . \ud83d\ude04 . Good point, I\u2019ll make an issue.. Free!\nTry hitting ctrl-space inside the editor on play (when it makes sense for an autocomplete).. Oh right, we may need these to be separate from here, kept in core.. At some point, when we're able to get on Immutable 4.0.0-RC*, we'll be able to use the RecordOf<T> type.. Since it's within the types directory, perhaps we should call this @nteract/types/notebook or @nteract/types/immutableNotebook? I'm not quite sure. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f . Unless we're using these elsewhere (by more than one package, other than using the editor), I don't think these have to be extracted from inside of the editor package as they're really just here for codemirror usage.. \ud83d\udc4f . Cool, works for me!. Yeah my purpose was getting away from cryptic names since we use an @nteract namespace now. Back when commutable was created we didn\u2019t have much for options other than creating crafty names. Not that I would name it this but if we went by purpose we\u2019d call it immutable-model-of-an-in-memory-notebook-and-related-data-structures. I think it would be ok to surface the overall language info, cached on the kernel object located on that entities.serversById[serverId].server.activeKernelsByName[kernelName].kernel path.. It just dawned on me that this was doing a combineReducers for each and every one of these so that their name exactly matches what they are on the state tree here and that they only have the local currentKernelLanguage state.. Yeah, as long as that makes sense.. This is more of a comment on me realizing how the architecture was setup here by you and @theengineear -- it's super clean. There's a 1:1 mapping between the function names and the state it's resolving.. Goodbye old imperative code from react-simpledropdown.. Goodbye unnecessary refs.. This dependency really only belonged in core. It's now replaced with our implementation in the right spot.. You can only find the dropdown menu contents on the page when it's open, so we simulate a click on the .toggle-menu first.. The only annoying thing about not including the devDeps is that if someone is using this package outside of the monorepo and wants to modify it locally, they need to figure out the dependencies they need instead of npm i and making changes.. Smart!. I would check to make sure that serverId is in the serversById here and if it's not, either return:\njs\nempty() // this is an observable creation method, like \"of\"\nor\njs\nof(actions.killServerFailed({ serverId, error: \"server not known\" }))\nwith a sufficient error message. Fantastic, this is a good first pass at closing that codemirror issue about using the mode.. superb. Since you now have languageInfo in the tree, you could switch this function up a bit and trim out the highlighted language action.\n```js\nconst mapStateToProps = state => {\n  const currentKernel = objectPath.get(state, [\n    'entities',\n    'serversById',\n    state.ui.currentServerId,\n    'server',\n    'activeKernelsByName',\n    state.ui.currentKernelName,\n    'kernel',\n  ]);\nconst highlightedLanguage = objectPath.get(currentKernel, [\n    'languageInfo',\n    'name',\n  ]);\nreturn {\n    repo: state.ui.repo,\n    gitref: state.ui.gitref,\n    source: state.ui.source,\n    platform: state.ui.platform,\n    showPanel: state.ui.showPanel,\n    currentServerId: state.ui.currentServerId,\n    currentKernelName: state.ui.currentKernelName,\n    highlightedLanguage,\n    currentKernel,\n    currentServer: objectPath.get(state, [\n      'entities',\n      'serversById',\n      state.ui.currentServerId,\n      'server',\n    ]),\n  };\n};\n```\nThen you can do away with the action set up for the highlighted language.. The main reason we don't want to track the same state in two different sections of the state tree is that they can become out of sync. We want one source of truth, otherwise all developers have to know that a change in that field has to also effect it in another location.. Let me know if/when you're tackling this one. Otherwise I can merge this as is and make it part of the overall deployment of everything tonight.. It should be coming from @nteract/types/core/records, though it looks like this is never being called and not causing an issue?. oh I should change this name, thanks. Nope! This one (in showcase) was demonstrating how to use the next gen components.. Nope! We only use the presentational Outputs components in play, it's a totally separate redux store setup in play.. The notebook provider uses Cell directly and we used to have a CellComponent prop where we passed the Cell implementation. That's completely gone (and has been for a bit), so I cleaned up this part of the test.. This is probably a bad sign for the <Editor> component's naming. \ud83e\udd14  It's designed to be used like this:\njs\n<Editor>\n  import this\n</Editor>\nwhich by default just shows a syntax highlighted representation of the text and has some attached styling. When you want an editable one, you pass in a child component that is actually editable:\njs\n<Editor>\n  <CodeMirror>\n    import this\n  </CodeMirror>\n</Editor>. yeahhhhhh... We should probably call it <NotebookApp /> or something for the provider version. It's way different than the presentational <Notebook /> which just does styling for between the (non-provider) <Cell />s.. We don't have any multi-cell select logic.\nThe keyboard shortcuts are handling of when you have the cell focused so that you can flip back and forth between view mode. I've got to run, for the time being though I'd suggest playing with up/down on the current app. I can do a GIF and explanation later.. Nice! Even if we don't end up using these octicons for this data component, we'll have them ready and available for more uses. \ud83d\ude04 . I didn't realize we had this in here before -- we should probably use just one of the two json schema validators in this repo. You don't have to change it here though, we'll just want/need to address it sometime later to make our footprint a little smaller.. Sneaky.. Looks like State should now be:\ntype State = {\n  view: \"line\" | \"bar\" | \"scatter\" | \"grid\";\n}\nYes, the literals, not the constants. Flow knows that the properties of viewTypes are not immutable properties.. \ud83d\ude04  Since we have the buttons now \ud83d\ude05 . Ooooh this is such a nice and easy pattern to use, sweet.. Ahhhh, ok. Thanks.. lodash was one of the ones that electron-builder was saying it couldn't resolve.. Rockin'. style-jsx can't do nested, like with @media print. I tried to use a fragment here, but the webpack build was failing with it. Not sure if it was a next, babel, or flow issue.. styled-jsx can't handle the css variable :root appropriately, the build will just fail.. Oh hey I didn\u2019t realize I could use React.Fragment. I can change that here.. Eh, all good. Leaves it as an opportunity for someone else. \ud83d\ude04 . Nice!\nGood to know that our names match up well.. > On the initial page load, we should be able to more-or-less kick off the same action from componentDidMount, right?\nAh yeah we could do that.. > is there any reason that we'd want to have this information live in our ui state and in the url?\nThe way I think of it is that there are two views (that are stateful) that show the current true state of gitref and repo:\n\nURL\nform\n\nThe way I triggered this right now is that the URL only shows the current state of actual submitted binder so that's it's copy-pastable by user. I don't have much opinion on this other than making sure that the user has a nice URL to copy that reflects what they'd like to share with others.. Since prefetch usually happens in parallel, I did this so that the browser fires off requests for:\n\nThe actual image on giphy\nThe bitly link\n\nWhich would typically mean that once the bit.ly link is resolved the browser already has (or knows about) the actual image asset.\nAn unstated part of this is that I used the bit.ly link just so the python code is smaller within the play app. \ud83d\ude04 \n  . oh snap!. I originally made this a span([span(...) ...]) then switched to an array to make it smaller.. Whoops, yes!. Ah yeah definitely. I suppose we could. I think it only will if we group the \u2018test\u2019s.. Done.. Yeah...\nI suppose we'd need to be explicit for each type of app since desktop, the jupyter extension, and the next apps are pretty different.. this allows us to not have to transpile packages when building apps -- it should probably be called \"nteractAppEntry\" or something. It's the equivalent to the main field.. Thank you!. That\u2019s cool with me!. For this one I\u2019m not sure, I copied it direct from the google doc. I think it\u2019s probably because we\u2019d need to know which host to launch a kernel from given a collection of them. We do need all the server connection info for the binder launching.. Yup.. Resources is part of the response from the kernelspecs API (which I should probably note is different from local mode as we just see these as files). Example GET on /api/kernelspecs:\njson\n{\n  \"default\": \"python3\",\n  \"kernelspecs\": {\n    \"python3\": {\n      \"name\": \"python3\",\n      \"resources\": {\n        \"logo-32x32\":\n          \"/user/nteract-vdom-6m4yabcq/kernelspecs/python3/logo-32x32.png\",\n        \"logo-64x64\":\n          \"/user/nteract-vdom-6m4yabcq/kernelspecs/python3/logo-64x64.png\"\n      },\n      \"spec\": {\n        \"display_name\": \"Python 3\",\n        \"language\": \"python\",\n        \"argv\": [\n          \"python\",\n          \"-m\",\n          \"ipykernel_launcher\",\n          \"-f\",\n          \"{connection_file}\"\n        ],\n        \"env\": {}\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n  . hostType seems sensible for kernels. We could also call it socketType. However, I'm curious what we'd need available when we want to restart or interrupt a kernel on a jupyter notebook server, as we'd need access to the host URL and token.. It certainly belongs in the notebook document.. It's shown in the start here: https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_description.html#top-level-structure\npython\n    \"language_info\": {\n        # if language_info is defined, its name field is required.\n        \"name\" : \"the programming language of the kernel\",\n        \"version\": \"the version of the language\",\n        \"codemirror_mode\": \"The name of the codemirror mode to use [optional]\"\n    }\nso:\nlanguageInfo: {\n  name: string,\n  version: string,\n  codemirror_mode: string\n}\n. Nice, does this work as is without their remark-math plugin? xref: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/2115. Good catch! It's not a problem here as we have no reducers or anything else that relies on it. This output currently goes nowhere, we just emit it through redux so that we can see it with debugging tools. I figured the name could be more specific so I took the liberty to change it.. The only way we'll have kernelRefs is if an app uses multiple kernels in one page. I think we can delete this one.. Oh I see, we could have multiple. I have them called activeKernelRefs in my other PR. Is that ok wording choice?. Oh, should this be an Id type here?. Ah, it's not -- I ended up faking the message below.. This happens when you use %load in IPython. I'll add a comment about this here.\nExample:\n\n. Thanks! I've swapped this out to use the proper AppRecord now. . I'll expand this a bit locally to explain --\njs\n// getInitialProps is a function unique to next.js, not normal to React\nstatic getInitialProps\n// Apparently our flow setup doesn't have this definition already situated\n// The first (and only?) argument is an object\n// which has a property called renderPage\n({ renderPage }:\n// Everything after the \":\" is the actual type definition for this\n// so we're saying the type of this argument is an object with property renderPage,\n// which is a Function (which I could have typed out the type of more explicitly --\n// I aimed for passing for now)\n{ renderPage: Function })\n. The reason that we've been aiming at putting the hostRefs and other *Refs at the top level is to create a structure that can be re-used in non-notebook apps (like in play). I also think that, nomenclature wise, we should probably call any structure detailing the notebook app as notebookApp.. An inactive kernel would be any that might still be shutting down, or, in the case of play (currently), be a kernel that just isn't the currently selected one by the user.. This will need to merge in ownProps (the second argument to mapStateToProps). We could probably move this into the defaultOptions below and just make the defaultProps here be an empty object, then instead of just super(props) we could do something like:\nsuper({ ...props, {options: { ...props.options, defaultOptions }}})\nMaybe we can't though because of the bound functions there. \ud83e\udd14  . ok, that's fine\nWe're not actually using onScroll (?) so maybe it's best to remove it completely, which I guess would remove preserveScrollPosition too. IIRC this came from the original component we forked.. This needs to be this.defaultOptions since it's used in other functions on this component.. That or later usage of it needs to be trimmed out. Either way, this is making the tests fail at the moment.. Todo: use the action creator. This should be ACTIVATE_KERNEL_FULFILLED. Yeah, I'll update it now.. I look forward to when we can have a generic codeMirrorConfig as part of our state.config so people can opt in to exactly the changes they'd like.. In #2385 I ended up switching (mostly) everything to kernel.status, since we also use this to depict the other states around the kernel launch I think it fits better as the status of the kernel.. I just noticed this TODO can be deleted.. We should leave a comment here outlining some of our states for this, we'll want to make proper constants at some point I think.... One minor issue I see is that redux-immutable's peerDep is not set to handle our range on immutable. You might have found it to be a non-issue though.. null\nThis is twofold as to why:\n\nIt gets loaded from disk or API, so we can't guarantee that they set this key\nThis one has a big impact since the name is supposed to be unique. null here too as the default. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . thanks for making the case consistent. I mean, unless we do validation before creating a \"real\" record.. Could we just call this one KernelspecProps?. The previous casing standard came from the Record.Factory docs, particularly the Flow typing records section.. A+ to new style being introduced as part of new actions.. Reminder to myself that I have to return this file back to how I found it. \ud83d\ude09 . This brings back EXECUTE_CELL, which is requesting that we execute a cell with a given ID. This helps us not have to have the cells and their contents bound to actions that will cause cell execution -- they should only have to have the cell ID.. I should probably add a comment in here that we create create the execute request based on the source of the ID from the EXECUTE_CELL action.. The more I was able to take out of our top level component here, the better it got.. Clarification on this comment, as well as a todo for me:\n\nThere should be a way to dispatch something like focusTheCellAfterTheCurrentFocusedCell. Just the same, we should be able to run executeFocusedCell.. Can't merge until the functionality here is brought back. I tore it out to reduce how much information the top level notebook was getting so I could get the nice update highlighting. \ud83d\ude04 . Thinking about this one in particular, I think the transforms could/should opt in to the models via contextTypes. Only model-debug is using this currently, so I think that's a fine assumption while we carve this out.. From the flow docs on React\n\nNote: We import React as a namespace here with import * as React from 'react' instead of as a default with import React from 'react'. When importing React as an ES module you may use either style, but importing as a namespace gives you access to React\u2019s utility types.\n\nMost of the code base is this way as well and occurred on some combo of React 16 and a more recent flow release.. The EXECUTE_FOCUSED_CELL action has no id, and relies on what's in the store for the current focused cell.  If for some reason a cell is not focused and they hit shift-enter, I figured this should be thrown (and caught in the epic as catchError (not in the diff here, it's in the epic much lower).. You know, I'm not sure. I just switched this to export so I could explicitly use it in the provider component.. Whoops!. kernelspecs is an array of kernelspec which sadly includes a key called spec. This comes entirely from the Jupyter nomenclature for kernelspec. As long as we're consistent and it's easy for us to read, I'm happy.. Awesome description and link back.. This could just be:\njavascript\nrequire(\"./../../package.json\").version\nat this point now. Ok, cool, I'll just merge this in. No worries if the package.json ends up in our bundle, it's teeny compared to everything else.. Not yet! My TODO here is more of a \":warning: once this is hooked up to run the kernels, it could end up firing off actions that will cause binder to launch a server\". I wonder if we should leave commentary in these places about why we have this ref and what the function of the current \"single-server\" literal is for.. Since you're using .set anyways here, I'd probably just do this:\njs\nreturn Immutable.Map(action.payload.kernelspecs).map(\n  (value: KernelspecProps) => makeKernelspec(value)\n);. Whoops, value comes first. Make sure to switch that up if you read that before I edited it.. Looking good to me.. This could push the full object and do checks that ensure we get roughly the right actions with:\nexpect(actions).toEqual([\n  {\n    type: \"OVERWRITE_METADATA_FIELD\",\n    name: \"whatever\",\n    dunno: expect.any(Object)\n  }\n]). No further operators will run in the pipe, only a catchError operator will catch the error thrown here.. That's a prettier thing.. I kept with the original nomenclature of this action as it was written, which was filename. We've got some incongruence between desktop and webapp here since the desktop app uses paths which many times need to be path.resolved and the default should be their current working directory rather than /. In the case of the web app, / is the root of the notebook server.. This is beautifully organized.. Yeah that's a tricky one. We probably need to work with the focused cell and if we need to create more actions (like the \"run all\").. Assuming this is all nested under \"communication\", \ud83d\udc4d . Yeah, that makes sense.. Here's a good reference, from deep within our monorepo -- full on flow types for the content API response: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/fe09bf9ae5f77473dab2e2eec9a290ec2d80ca22/applications/commuter/src/content-providers/base/index.js. The content API response is like a stat call + raw content inside of the content key:\n```js\nexport type FileContent = {\n  type: \"file\",\n  mimetype: null | string,\n  content: null | string,\nname: string,\n  path: string,\ncreated: Date,\n  last_modified: Date,\n  writable: boolean,\n  format: null | \"text\" | \"base64\"\n};\n```\n. I'm not completely sure if we're using this still, I'll go ahead and merge anyways.. This all makes me wonder if we should have an action for \"EXECUTE_ALL_CELLS_BELOW_FOCUSED_CELL\". Same with Execute all. Force the epic to do the coordination with the state and cellMap.. I think we have functions for some of this in desktop that could end up in core.. The type for this likely exists in commutable or in types (though I think the latter may be one of those that is currently wrong and not used...). There's a function for this in @nteract/commutable that you have to use because our in-memory structure is not the same as what the on-disk format has to be.. ```js\nimport { toJS, stringifyNotebook } from \"@nteract/commutable\";\nstringifyNotebook(toJS(notebook))\n```\nThe way it gets done in the desktop app (since it also sets the version when saved): https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/d40b6de052bf6c034b1bd07cc9c1ade5268c4c61/applications/desktop/src/notebook/epics/saving.js#L39-L45. The mime type here should be application/json i believe. We only plan on having two themes, light and dark, and this can be cleaned up so feel free to pick what you think is best here.. Ah yeah now that I read it, yes this would be better if they were each named.. Always make sure to use what the light theme uses for the second arg / default so these components work without explicit theme.. I think that'd be fine. I was mostly following the old order. Let me make this all in one here.. There is a saveAs action, which is how this comes to be in the first place. I was a little worried about changing the current state of how the desktop app worked in the process of doing this. Then again, save used to take the filename and notebook so I suppose this is a bit different now.... It doesn't change the filename until changeFilename is dispatched, though it seems like the way this works -- we could possibly get rid of changeFilename and make a reducer for saveAs?. Ah, I had not done that. Good catch.. I think the weirdness about this is that we're not tracking a ref to denote that we finished saving a particular file. Right now we're in a state of our app having only one file at a time.. Done.. Cleaning this one up now, I want to make sure to test things out just to make sure.. One other potentially weird bit to this is that if anyone mutates the action, every other receiver of this call gets the changes. Not that we use any fields here, but that would be very gross.. That or mapTo(Object.freeze(doneSaving())). \ud83d\ude04 \nTotally cool to switch this to a map operator, that's a welcome quick fix.. I'm lost on this -- where does state come from? Is that intended to be createSelector((state) => [...]. We lowercase \"nteract\".. Oh did it actually let you use @media queries? I thought for sure these fell under the \"no nested\" category. \ud83d\udc4d \ud83c\udf89 . I think if you use currentTarget and separate the two divs here so they're not nested you can go without the ref.. Wow this is a really neat pattern, I like this.. Pro-level flow.. Would it make sense to use a ref here instead?. For eslint, you're going to have to set:\n/* eslint jsx-a11y/no-static-element-interactions: 0 */\n/* eslint jsx-a11y/click-events-have-key-events: 0 */\n/* eslint jsx-a11y/no-noninteractive-element-interactions: 0 */\nSince there's a click event on a div here.. Superb TODOs for the eslint ignores. \ud83d\ude04 . \ud83d\udc4d . What's the reasoning behind pointing to this particular fork?. I think I'll bring this one in directly into the @nteract/markdown package.. From the flowtype docs for React:\n\nNote: We import React as a namespace here with import * as React from 'react' instead of as a default with import React from 'react'. When importing React as an ES module you may use either style, but importing as a namespace gives you access to React\u2019s utility types.. We can bring this back once https://github.com/nteract/mathjax-electron/issues/30 is closed. The config within the desktop app will then be:\n\njs\n<MathJax.Context script={false}>\n  {appStuff}\n</MathJax.Context>. Here's where it's weird (and I clearly should leave a comment). This code is checking if MathJax is defined globally by running a typeof on a potentially not set value then explicitly setting the MathJax context to undefined.. I should sneak some more snapshots in here. :) Because of how React.Node doesn't render until mount, it's only a null. I'll get some better tests here. I was over reliant on flow for helping me figure my way through this.. This change could go in a separate PR, it was in solely to deal with a regression in react-virtualized that broke our tests.. This could probably be 'Source Code Pro', courier.. \ud83d\ude04 . I've got a funny feeling that you have to encode styles when this is used in any server side rendered setup... I can't recall if/where that came up.. Oh I suppose this is where you'd set the mono to Source Code Pro.. \ud83d\ude04 . ooooooh maybe that wasn't the weird case then. Yes! I'll do this now. \ud83d\ude04 \nThey can probably fail, and if it's not the server the user's internet could always go out. I think every ajax request should have a catchError.. Yes. I'll go after this too.. ignoring which part here, the action?. This is the ol' desktop electron ipc -> dispatch setup. interruptKernel is now also a proper action creator instead of a frozen object. \ud83d\ude1c . Ya know what, I'll do that anyways.. Working on it!. Thanks for making sure desktop gets that base config. \ud83d\ude04 . I like that semantically it's theme first so I can read it as being a theme-able property. \ud83d\udc4d . Could probably delete the div above this I assume. Also, since the styles don't need the Provider, could they go one level above the provider?. should probably have the white fallback here, as one of the core components that are style only.. \ud83d\ude47  Thank you for switching this to the right name, prompt \ud83d\ude4f . Probably need to include the fallback here as well (of black).. Fallback of #fafafa here. Fallback of #fafafa here. This is likely the only file that I'll nitpick on having the defaults, only because these are the cell building block components you should be able to start working with, without having to have the Style provider.. Superb!. In adopting package.json scripts, if you've got pre steps you should prefix the command you want to happen first like this:\n\"prebuild\": \"npm run build:clean && npm run build:styles && npm run build:copy-files\"\nnpm will then run that before build.. Is build only a staging directory and lib where the final assets go when published?. Now this is nice and easy to read, structure wise.. Still want that Source Code Pro here. \ud83d\ude09 . What's the basic usage story here?\nFor fonts, we probably want to give the guidance of using:\nhtml\n<link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Code+Pro|Source+Sans+Pro\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\nThough we could always include the import in our base:\ncss\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Code+Pro|Source+Sans+Pro');\nFor desktop we'll still have to go with our packaged version.. Errrr actually I think these need to be:\nhtml\n<link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Code+Pro:200,300,400,500,600,700,900|Source+Sans+Pro:200,200i,300,300i,400,400i,600,600i,700,700i,900,900i\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\nand\ncss\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Code+Pro:200,300,400,500,600,700,900|Source+Sans+Pro:200,200i,300,300i,400,400i,600,600i,700,700i,900,900i');\nso we have the full range on Source Code Pro and Source Sans Pro. We'll want an action creator for this -- note that it's distinct from the KILL KERNEL action in that we're allowing for killing the old kernel while we create a new one. We can't fire off KILL_KERNEL because we could run into a timing issue where we end up killing off the kernel we just launched. Up until refs, we can't go down that path.. I thought I could use empty() here -- that returns an undefined item though (?). We do have an action creator for the above, I should adapt that.. Since I was unsure about how we'd want these setup, I've just made plain actions. What do you think about this stream @theengineear? (we can make action creators after we scope out what this lifecycle looks like). Another action to think about.. These actions are more for transparency while debugging. At this point, we know the kernel has been formally cleaned up if it reached here (or so we hope).. Yeah that makes sense. I could call it killKernel and we'd know the return type is an observable based on usage here?. \ud83e\udd14  There might be a better way to group these so that we catch timeout errors separate from any other errors.. When I was using empty, I was getting an undefined action passed to redux. I wasn't able to trace where it was coming from and it cleaned up after switching out the empty. \n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. I guess as long as we track the types of ways it fails well. In my limited testing with these, I've been able to get the python kernel to not respond to the shutdown request some of the time. At least, I only care about this for the sake of debugging kernels (and informing users where possible). We'll have the error, either way, I just wouldn't want to have to parse the error when we already have the information.. Heh, I made this a separate function then realized I needed the kernel in scope... so I cheated and moved this back in.. This is really useful feedback!\nThe reasons that I made a separate function for this include:\n\nNeeding to handle killing of kernels in a different way when\nthere's a new kernel being launched\nthe user requests to just kill the current kernel (this is likely when an interrupt just isn't cutting it)\nThe fact that we don't have refs to keep track of kernels yet \ud83d\ude05 \n. This segment is simultaneously killing me and delaying the ease of finishing this PR. \ud83d\ude30 . This centers around that issue I described above with empty() where I was getting an undefined. I safe guarded this just so things didn't bork out while I was debugging.. \ud83d\ude05  This was a bug we didn't experience yet because we were using a separate reducer in desktop.. Yeah once we have refs we can break this apart.. I can yank it out. It added some additional runtime safety, no big deal though.. We'll want to be pinned to 2.2.3 for styled-jsx, this is ok though.. copy pasta bad, let me fix these. Another cool one is expect.any -- I probably could have made this expect.any(Subject), though I wasn't sure.. Total cop out answer: The users are not fast enough with the desktop ui to launch a kernel while already launching a kernel *\n\n* This is totally a lie, if the first kernel is slower to start and the second kernel is faster to start, you'd definitely have this problem\nI only think we can get around this by having refs. You're probably right though that this should be a concatMap instead.. I think model is fine. I think it's cool at the top of core.. from \"@nteract/core/selectors\". solid cleanups in here. This should all make @jdetle happy! \ud83c\udf89 . \ud83d\udc4d . heh. How'd an action sneak in here?. I think null is fine. Since we're having to put the selectors here for the github functionality, we might as well move the reducer from desktop's app reducer (and maybe the epic...). Not for this PR, but it'll be nice for desktop to have no custom reducers now.. At some point we'll want to re-evaluate how we do run-all and run-all-below, since they belong in an epic that tracks the execution rolling on through.. Looks like this didn't mean to be here. Ooooohhhh cool, we didn't need the notebook here anymore.. This could be an isSaved selector.. That or emptyNotebook (from commutable). Yup!. \ud83c\udf89 . We can't do that with (direct) flow types (there aren't utility types like the React ones here).. Yeah, that's fine for now. We probably want to tear out the sticky cells at this point.. On some level, I think it's ok to only use the state we're actually using for the selectors.. Refresh my memory, why does the notebook-menu need the whole cellMap and cellOrder?. We could / probably should emit an error rather than the empty.. Aren't you able to return the empty() observable as is?. Since we're only using cell type and cell source here, I think the selector used above could be:\njs\nconst source = cellSourceById(store.getState(), { id });\nconst type = cellTypeById(store.getState(), { id });. Good old silly one configurable bit for codemirror here. \ud83d\ude1d . This could be simplifed back to identity by making the call above be:\nstate.document.get(\"notebook\", null). Took me a sec to realize that instead of accumulation, it's replacement of a falsy (likely null) value. . Since I think this gets used for timing, we should probably call this currentLastSavedTimestamp or something.. Personally, I'd aim at just doing:\nstate.document.getIn([\"notebook\", \"metadata\"], Immutable.Map())\nso we can rely on this being a map unconditionally. It helps with a lot of the code below that uses it and I think is a fair tradeoff.. There's disparity here in that if [\"metadata\", \"gist_id\"] is not in the notebook, this will return undefined. If the notebook wasn't defined it returns \"\". I'd aim to return null in this one as:\njs\nnotebook.getIn([\"metadata\", \"gist_id\"], null). I see what you mean by if we should throw here... If it's not set we should fail and know where it occurred. Do people normally allow for throwing in exceptions?. \u26a0\ufe0f I'm a little afraid of us accidentally saving at some $PATH an empty notebook. I think I'm a fan of throwing here (or in stringifyNotebook). Perhaps the right choice though is to handle it in the epic -- if it returns null for instance, we should take a different path. I guess maybe that's the right choice though -- we do the handling in the epic where we have an ability to inform the UI and the user.. This seems like one we'll want to do as a byRef setup :soon:, since no component ever needs all the cells.. I look forward to this being replaced by a selector which is cellByRef. Saving I definitely want to make sure we're propagating enough information back up, both for trust and transparency for users, and debuggability for us.. Updating the above comment to match the use of our cell ids (which of course are in fact refs).. Yes! We ran an informal poll on twitter in October of 2017.\n\nDo you use \"pin cell\" in nteract desktop?\n|  # | % | Choice | \n|---|---|------|\n| 5 | 26.3% | Never, it's so not for me  |\n| 5 | 26.3% | Once for funsies |\n| 7 | 36.8% | Hardly ever |\n| 2 | 10.5% | All the time, it's my jam |\n19 respondents\n\nI'm willing to say, based on those results, that it would be ok to remove it in favor of maintainability. We can always keep the component + styling in core, just rip it out of the standalone notebook app.. Ahhhhhh yeah. I suppose the records make it easier, which means using makeAppRecord and makeDocumentRecord should make building a dummy simpler than having to change dummy on the fly (or rely on its values).. ooooooook\nI'll get that into an epic since that would help both menu implementations. Okee doke. Metadata is an unstructured Immutable.Map because we don't know what keys they're using.. I think returning null and handling it elsewhere is perfect, unless there's some sensible default (like with codemirror mode, etc.). I do wish we provided more context here, so we know that it's because of a lack of notebook.. Fantastic!. I assume you meant to stick the hostRef in the kernels byRef as well.. \ud83d\udc4d . This is much more cleaned up relative to what we've done in the menu in the past!. What I wish we currently had in the kernel is either the kernelSpec itself or a kernelSpecRef so that we could just launch with a known kernelspec (at least for desktop, where we have to do a lookup).. I became just a little bit more sane after switching to a actions.whatever() all over here. Much easier for me to scan through and refactor (though the types aren't really loaded because of that weird pseudo namespace).. Yes!. \ud83d\ude01 . Sorry, I should have left a comment. I didn't understand why saving a PDF would force the kernel to reload here.. Gosh golly, lemme switch it.. It'll be even better with the refs here, since we'll be able to say \"kill this one, start this one, and make this one the current one\".. concatMap is probably best, though it may be a bit silly since the observable returned in both cases are completely synchronous. I'll switch to concatMap for consistency.. \ud83e\udd23 . In clearAllOutputs there's a check to see if the restart kernel action has payload.clearOutputs set to true.. This is all looking super good.. What's the byRef doing with the loading states?. Woo, yeah!. Looking solid, glad you typed the Map above.. Wait, why does host have an isSaving?. I feel like the core plan has some bits about what we wanted to capture for communication about hosts.. Oh myyyyy \ud83d\ude04 . I'm guessing this was all just copy-pasta'ed from how contents was working -- what's isSaving here for? Are there other properties we care to communicate from here?. ohhhh, now I'm understanding -- perhaps this is for isLoading -- that's probably what we want here. \ud83d\udc4d . This is intended to be our in-memory version and likely different from the Jupyter API response, is that why that isn't used here?. \ud83d\udc4d . Earlier today I saved my lats by stretching. . In the lifecycle of the application we never want the path to be null. Probably inevitable for startup though that we don't have this set so we could default to \".\" and default the type to \"directory\" I suppose.. We do have an option for enforcing they get set on creation -- the publicly exported makeContentRecord can be a function of our own design that uses the real RecordFactory underneath. We can enforce that these properties are set when that function is called.. The BaseHost shouldn't have kernelIds, those only apply to the Jupyter server. Then again, I think maybe the uuid on the server neatly matches the connection file name written to disk.\nAt any rate I think kernelIds only belongs in the JupyterHost. It's ok to default this to python. Note: we'll want to make sure we can look up a kernelspec by name in the kernelspecs structure. Names are unique per set of kernelspecs. We'll be able to get the collection of kernelspecs using the hostRef since that will give us the kernelSpecsRef (sorry about all the crazy plurality naming and potential confusion).. \ud83d\udcaf . Most excellent.. Ok, this is where things will probably start to get a bit confusing.\nKernelSpecsRef gives you access to a collection of KernelSpecs each of which is identified by name.\nExample lookup:\njs\nfunction kernelSpec(kernelSpecsRef, kernelSpecName) {\n  const kernelSpecs = kernelspecs.byRef[kernelSpecsRef];\n  return kernelSpecs.byName[kernelSpecName];\n}\nDoes that clarify it?. Interesting.. \ud83d\udc4d . Ok, yeah this makes sense since we have to take a string in from externally and declare them as \"IDs\".. This makes me wonder if I should change the nomenclature and pattern to action.payload.outputHidden.. Yeah we can have multiple kernelspecs, my brain was stuck in jupyter extension / one kernelspecs mode when in fact we'd want to support multiple since we support multiple hosts.. I suppose, looking over this again, that we could always have kernelRefs for both. Maybe that's duplicative though. I guess what I'm saying is that we'll want to be able to list all the running kernels on a jupyter host and then all the ones active for the document are in kernelRefs?. I think maybe both isSaving and isLoading is fine, since we could have both in process technically (even though we shouldn't).. That'll work.. Yeah, the main reason we'd want to know all the kernel IDs is so that on the dashboard we are able to list which kernels and notebooks are currently running.. ~~Are we just going to have selectedHostRef etc. be defaults for now in the state? It's probably ok to have a simple reducer action combo for SELECT_HOST where we'd pass a ref.~~ Already answered below with it being part of the state, though we could still do a reducer.. A+ to see all this.. Total nit, but I'd probably call this makeKernelspecByNameRecord, noting lack of plurality, just so we don't confuse it with the kernelspecs related ones.. Ah ok, I see this answers what I asked above.. Yeah, that makes sense. It's nested under the byRef version since you have to have the ref and the name.\nresources belongs inside an individual kernelspec though.\nGET on /api/kernelspecs returns\njs\n{\n  default: \"python3\",\n  kernelspecs: {\n    python3: {\n      name: \"python3\",\n      spec: {\n        argv: [\"python\", \"-m\", \"ipykernel_launcher\", \"-f\", \"{connection_file}\"],\n        env: {},\n        display_name: \"Python 3\",\n        language: \"python\",\n        interrupt_mode: \"signal\",\n        metadata: {}\n      },\n      resources: {\n        \"logo-64x64\":\n          \"/user/nteract-vdom-q5kh4u9v/kernelspecs/python3/logo-64x64.png\",\n        \"logo-32x32\":\n          \"/user/nteract-vdom-q5kh4u9v/kernelspecs/python3/logo-32x32.png\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}. Placeholder for #2483. The web app isn't invoking / creating the notification system, so I set up a hokey one here. I could make this part of the default state tree so we at least have it defined (though we still need to move to our own managed notification system).. Ok, I've done that just now. Just a heads up here @theengineear.. ok, I can move that back in. ooooops. Fixed it for both interrupt and kill just now!. Yeah I can do that, good idea.. Yeah, path should be used here. path (the node module) is also in scope so I was working around it. The current commit should now be clean (and I've exercised it quite a bit locally).. This was the one I worked around with since node's path module needs to be used in this function, the parameter passed was filepath and I was reconstructing it (pointlessly) as filePath.. I like that, I'll switch the name up here.. There won't be more than one epic listening for this (I think).. Pretty handy since we don't have the rxjs operator types via flow. \ud83d\ude04 . \ud83d\ude04 I'll take it out now.. Ah, cool. What should I be using here?. If only I could have used negative numbers!. I put this in mostly to get around a flow issue, I'll clean this up shortly.. In an attempt to make sure that react is loaded before react-hot-loader to show instrumentation steps, I put React early on in these files (and added them when they weren't here as is \"ok\" with next.js apps).. During hot reload, this constructor is called again... I tried to do this to make something do-able. It still errors when running npm run app:showcase and changing nteract libraries. I'll post the error in a little bit.. This was causing issues with running @nteract/play.. \u26a0\ufe0f  Put this back.. Since this has to be loaded at the stage of use by webpack and won't be transpiled, all flow in this file uses the \"comment style\".. Yeah, it's what we're using for styled-jsx & other transforms on the next.js apps. I'm happy keeping it all the same transpiled JS.. This is a precedence order for webpack to choose a key from a package's package.json to determine where to accept the main of the package. Classically, this is main in node apps:\n{\n  \"name\": \"wat\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"author\": \"Kyle Kelley <rgbkrk@gmail.com>\",\n  \"license\": \"BSD-3-Clause\"\n}\nSome people have been setting another field for ES6 code, jsnext:main:\n{\n  \"name\": \"wat\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"jsnext:main\": \"src/index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"author\": \"Kyle Kelley <rgbkrk@gmail.com>\",\n  \"license\": \"BSD-3-Clause\"\n}\nSince nteract has been using flow in our source, which isn't pure ES6 I used nteractDesktop (prior to other apps existing) to denote the src directory.. Woo, no more duplicate classNames here, I always thought that was silly and couldn't understand why.. Done!. Extra note -- we don't provide any of these other main field options (like es2015) -- it's other modules that do that.. The \"reverse\" exclude here needs to disregard @nteract/plotly, or we need to change the plotly setup.. This is a colossally bad idea because so many packages rely on this package deep internally, and we'd likely need to support (most) of util.. It's been fun shaking things out and finding packages that use util. \ud83d\ude09 . Works for me!. It's fine iteration!. These are perfect and I can completely understand them in one quick read.. \ud83d\udc4c . I'd probably leave comments in here that say\n// This sets the kernelspecs as kernelspecsRef to contain\n// a map of name -> KernelspecRecord. Woo!. \ud83d\udc4d. Yup!. This makes me realize something. A host only has one set of kernelspecs.. \ud83d\udc4d. Yup, props to get the arbitrary keyed elements.. Works for me, might as well have them situated since they're part of the core plan.. Woohoo!. Nice. \ud83d\ude04 . This would take DesktopHostRecordProps | JupyterHostRecordProps. Not sure what this type would be since we don't have fetching specced at all yet. I would personally put a big TODO: Determine what fetching a host even means -- this type is not used yet. Ok now that I've looked below, this is more like setHost rather than fetchHost. We're not making an ajax request whatsoever here. You could use the fulfilled version at this point.. Awesome, very easy to read here. ^^. These are so awesome now.. We are definitely overlapping now with #2563. \ud83d\ude04 . so true. Not now. Let's create that in the future.. That makes sense. Do we also allow a way to select while adding this host?. A+. Probably want to have a selected property so that we're both adding and selecting this host.. The host has its own ref too right?. As you'll see in most of this PR, it was a lot of turning @nteract/types/core/records into @nteract/core/records. Since the top level packages/core/records doesn't re-export the types, we pull these out of src.. Wise change I probably could have done in another PR. It was confusing me as to if this was a type or something else, when it was another record creator.. I'll fix this in a follow up PR when I do the selector bits.. I'll merge this into a later import in this file.. Note: This type isn't used at all here.. Did this just to increase coverage.. We were missing this property on the document record.. The type here should be HostRecordProps for the payload (right?), so that would require a ref.. > I think we discussed having selected content, not a selected host? Right? Like our model puts the document at the center of everything, and then uses that to set all the other context?\nOh right. Yeah.. Why do these have to reference index directly?. Ok, I'll hold off on merging here. \ud83d\ude04 . Ok, this was done in #2558 . Not really, lemme switch it to make it consistent. oh, the rest of these down below have a trailing slash so I think I probably kept it consistent there.. Yeah. Figured I might as well push this to stay consistent for now at least. Once we've switched them, let's take the rule out.. Oh I could switch this to the export * from 'providers' setup in @nteract/core and just go from there.. Yeah they're basically just styled divs that take certain kinds of children. Open to naming on these. I just moved them out of index.js so I wouldn't get a circular dependency.. I'll make the next PR that just moves this into the components.. These make sense since our kernel is nullable. It's only too bad that the rx types don't pass on through because then we could do a filter that ensured there was a kernel and that it was a zeromq / local type.\nI'll stick in some workarounds here at least.. Yeah, most of the time (maybe all the time) the generic type is string here.. Every call to this function is in this file and their type is based on the config value they're setting and the action type they expect to return. Look for the calls to this as well as the other uses of SetConfigAction<. LMAO, yeah this threw me completely off.. Yeah, * would be better. I'll change these real quick.. It would be really tempting to call the state module \"core\".. Yeah my only worry is the super common use of the variable named state.. Mega :+1:. What's this refs structure? Is this all the available sessions that are also in byRef?. I'm going to take a guess this is for showing all the running sessions, which we get by making a GET against /api/sessions. Is that what this is for?. \ud83d\udc4d . Could be. I just matched the regex string patterns used by our own config and next.js'.. Yeahhhhhhh. I took the json loader bits out as Webpack 4 no longer requires them.. Great to see this linked up well.. This would take a kernel ref right?. No these are on the main process. The actual new notebook action in the renderer process will coordinate that kernel ref. It happens in the file that accepts all the ipc.on. I'm assuming this will get a kernelRef too.. I'm assuming this will get a kernelRef too.. It is so good seeing all these attached refs here.. \u2764\ufe0f . This one is a funny one as its basically a synchronous call that sneaks in before unload finishes.. I suppose we'll have getKernel(state, ref). \ud83d\udc4d . If it helps our work we should probably move notebook-on-next into a \"not ready yet\" state, since we want to finish what we're doing for M1 on the jupyter extension before we maintain notebook-on-next.. Do commOpenAction and commMessageAction get used below?. Happy to see so many of these adopt the payload structure.. \ud83d\ude47 . I now feel silly that I left comments about providing kernelRefs. Sensible, yeah.. Excellent, I figured there'd be some passthrough here.. \ud83d\udcad . I look forward to when useCore is gone. \ud83d\ude09 . Very happy you cleaned these up to use the proper records. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\ude0a . Hooray for a fixed dummy store!. Maybe we need to set the status in the kernel object when we see a kill kernel for a given ref.. True true.. It scares me a bit that these are copied over from old when they're exactly the same. We should make one rely on the other or just get things aligned.. On further digging, these came from the previous kernel refs PR (that we closed) and they're not consistent with the ones used in old currently.. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\ude04 . Where are modals now?. Ah in entities along with hosts! Hurrah!. Dang it! No. I apparently created an extra. I'll clean that up.. It should make a new kernel -- let's rename it. The \"refresh\" is a re launch with a new current working directory.. The reason there's a restart flag is that the shutdown / kill Jupyter message accepts a restart flag (if this shutdown preceded a restart).. Roger that. Yep!. Yeah I definitely agree. I'll clean this up too.. oooook this is now kernelRef all over. I could use a second pair of eyes to make sure I did this refactor alright.. Rockin'!. oh lol, my refactor changed the wording here -- I'll fix this. Bye bye old kernel status!. Note: we should ensure that we've gotten access to the proper old kernel. If the reducer and this epic are out of order we won't end up cleaning up the old kernel.. This has been re-named to promptUserAboutNewKernel. I've taken the liberty of calling this the oldKernelRef and switching the top of this to grab the original kernel by kernelRef.. Extra note: This works right now as is. Seems like we need a decent safeguard here though for the future. . Making a new PR for these fixes.. Oops, didn't mean to leave this one in. To answer your question, it will be caught by flow -- however it won't be caught at runtime though. It would be kind of nice if we had a filter operator in place that ensured the object structure of an action (and just dropped the bad ones).. This file is missing an @flow at the top.. That was all that was missing here. Everything now passes!. Yes! Oops! I'll make another PR.. I suppose these are things we'll have from the original stat call.. I feel like we have this info in the original stat call.. I love that you made this opt out so transition bugs could be shaken out.. If this was a makeContentCommunicationRecord then you could set all the fields you want on the records below by doing:\nstate.mergeIn([byRef], {\n  loading: true,\n  saving: false,\n  error: null,\n})\nThat way, you wouldn't have to set loading and saving at the same time for example.\nAh, but this doesn't work for the cases where the record would be new. The merge would create a Map in those cases, even though this state here is typed as Map<ContentRef, ContentRecord>.\nNevermind this one!. Noice.. You probably could have made this whole thing the default, assuming it would use document's reducer underneath.. Thanks for marking this.. I can't wait to switch this over to the contents setup!. Super clean overall.. \ud83d\ude0d . \ud83d\ude0d . Ahhhhh. I'll miss this most of all, as I tried to make some pretty sweet CSS for this feature I wasn't enjoying supporting.. That is correct!. Only on the mac can you set if a file was edited. We no-op otherwise. Instead of baking that into the observable I just let later code (which is already checking on it) handle this (with the electron APIs).. You're so right on this one.. Save as is a little trickier than a rename as it's literally saving again with a new path. The original pathed file still exists (if it wasn't the first save).\nHere in desktop though, I can clean these comments up as it really is just one content ref.. I ended up not needing to fix it for this PR. I can unify that in a new PR.. Yeah. \ud83d\ude04 \nIt helps that selectors isn't widely checked. Wait until my next PR. \ud83d\ude1c . The electron API returns undefined when the user didn't select a file, and we handle that with invocations of this function.. ~~Yep (not that it should, just that it's how it's written at the moment both prior to this PR and now).~~ It ends up as /some/long/path.pdf. Ohhhhh.. Great catch.. This will be much clearer now. \ud83d\ude47 Thank you.. I... uh... may have just been working around flow here for a sec. I'll come to FIXME this one (and also fix it).. Excellent choice sir. \ud83c\udf77. Now that we have dedicated content refs and know that if we're working on a notebook document that the focused cell is unique to that notebook document. Since there are so many occurrences where the callee to an action creator was getting the focused cell then dispatching an action, I'd really like to simplify this to state the intent as -- if the id isn't set, assume it's the focused cell.. You're going to want to keep this using lodash.toPairs -- the node version you were using before (maybe you're upgraded now) was what led us to switching to lodash.toPairs.. Ref #2498. Note how we're rid of the \"extra\" name here.. IIRC, we have a content ref at this point and could use that to getNotebookByRef or something... A future enhancement perhaps?. This comment was odd as it literally described the implementation and was a bit out of date.. The filepath here comes from electron's dialog.showSaveDialog and is a new filepath. We could change this to handle null, undefined, and \"\", returning undefined explicitly in that case.. Ah, hmmmm. I'll \nFor (1), yeah that sounds good.\nFor (2), it's what we show as the \"display name\" of the file, so maybe this should be changed to displayName or something? It's the name when we have a filepath and Untitled when we don't.\nFor (3), maybe for a new selector that derives from filepath. (2) explains that reasoning, since this is basically used for what's displayed to the user rather than for file system operations.. Yup.. Sooooo much so.. \ud83c\udf89 . Yeah we should definitely clean this up to know what our consistent view on the filepath is. We probably should be returning null in the unset case. It made it easier to reason about if it was a string that I could manipulate in other selectors and uses, while still being falsy as needed (since an empty string). Perhaps that's poor form.. xref for why I did this: https://github.com/webpack/webpack-cli/pull/349. Since I can't import them at a top level (or can I?), I pulled them off the stateModule.. New tab for the notebooks certainly. I'll file this as a TODO above.. Added to the TODO list. Will do. \ud83d\ude04 . I was definitely trying to get a prototype up quick, so this is one of those quick-and-dirty bits I'll clean up. \ud83d\ude03 . Heh, I should probably incorporate some of the handling from commuter or include the mimetype field we don't currently have on our Contents.\nI'll add a few more TODOs for that.. We can type the state here. I'll update the TODO. It's better for us in the long run to be specific (if not truly a type for inferring).. Seems sensible to me.. If it ends up as \"\", it's because the user went to /nteract/edit instead of /nteract/edit/. We could also make sure that the server side does a redirect -- I figured it would be ok to handle this case here. I'll add a comment.. hahaha, I forgot I did this. Ah yeah, we could do that. I split it up while I was figuring out what to do here.. I think this will get better if we switch to selectors that operate only on NotebookContents or a NotebookModel instead of AppState, which has to dive in via byRef and might be undefined.. Flow is being extremely accurate, because of how we use this in other areas it made logic simpler.. I suppose in my mind, these were just an existence of entries. Any sorted behavior would come from an additional property that declared an ordering of the original set. \ud83e\udd14 Maybe this should be a Map and a List. One for the actual items, and another for the view we're giving users.. \ud83d\udc4d . Something that made working with our selectors, reducers, and flow is to have a type for our \"unsets\" instead of null.. Looking at that again, seems like List is the way, and we'll just be sorting / displaying that one. Key is still the ContentRef for the React elements.. Updated this, provided a comment about the way ahead for groupedBy and sortedBy.. Done.. Done.. I like isDirty since that's what we end up using this for, I'll switch that up.. Done!. \ud83d\ude03 . These actions are not used as I was able to simplify the kernel/session creation within the websocket kernel setup. I think I'll go ahead and delete these so they're not confusing by being with the other types before we really use them.. Totally fine to make a new-contributor-friendly issue to go through updating these, as this library was in place wayyy before we came to the casing agreement and it wouldn't be too hard to get these in line. \ud83d\ude04 . Note -- these tests got moved into the contents tests (of which there were none previously).. Yeah I was going a little crazy with the import type then use pattern happening in here. Way simpler to get going and enforce a type on the action creators now. \ud83d\ude04 . Perhaps I should have left this as a comment instead:\n// NOTE: assumption is action.type === actionTypes.SAVE at this point. ohhhh, I was thinking we'd set it with initialState like we do for currentContentRef. \ud83d\udc4d  Looking great\nOne thing we probably need to add on to the reducer is making this an Immutable.Map(). Why does launch kernel successful need the content ref?. On first glance (linear viewing based on the GitHub UI), I thought this was two events under the covers -- \"create a new kernel with this kernel ref and set this contentRef to use this kernelRef\"\nAfter reading the epic though, it's \"for this contentRef, create a new kernel using this name, and also here's the current kernel ref so it's easier to get access to the session\".\nWe should probably allocate the new kernelRef at this point and optionally include the old kernel ref.. Yay for actual flow type checking. \ud83d\ude04 . We need to make this come through with the current reduction step that handles this for the notebook and set it in the kernel record.. What's the difference between CHANGE_KERNEL and RUNTIME_CHANGE_KERNEL?. Ok now that I see this I see my confusion with the action's types. We could just be setting the contentRef here since we're not creating a new kernel.. This could probably be created in the mapStateToProps call right? Since the Provider component handles shouldComponentUpdate for us, we could pass an object that has just what we need into this component.. I feel like we should be:\n\ncreating the new kernel ref outside of here (part of the action)\nthis action (change kernel by name) should be used on reduction to set the new kernel for the content\n\nIf necessary, we can track the oldKernelRef in the action as well. We should make a note in here about how the sessions API closes down the old kernel for us. If the old kernel doesn't exist in this case, we need to create a new session with the requested kernel name (so the user can get to a working state).. Immediately. If the kernel is already being changed out, they shouldn't remain connected (visually) to the old kernel they were done with.. Yeah that makes sense. I definitely think we could make this action be:\n{\n  oldKernelRef,\n  nextKernelRef,\n  contentRef,\n  kernelName,\n}. Oops, I meant to delete this comment after I found out. I take a lot of notes in the review, expecting to answer my own questions after. Sorry bout that.\nSeems the answer, assuming we agree on my statement, is that we change the kernel in the CHANGE_KERNEL_BY_NAME rather than the successful launch. A successful launch merely updates the kernel record to provide the up to date info.. Ohhhhhh. Thank you.. The one earlier about what kind of kernelRef this was in the lifecycle -- was is the old or the new. It's the old kernel and the new kernel is launched here.. Totally. I think for a bunch of these we can just add TODOs and go from there. This is super solid as is.. \ud83d\udea9 Follow on PR for state reduction switch up.. Definitely something for another PR.. Going to defer this for another PR, namely the PR that uses this same info for the New Notebook menu entries.. I'll handle this in a follow on PR. The tricky part is likely instantiating a kernel object without some of the info.. Yeah, works pretty well and forces these types to all be set and not have to do a big null hunt. The only strange thing is our creation of records. I wonder if I should make sure that two equivalent set of props passed into would evalute Immutable.is(a,b) to true.. I've fully disabled notebook-on-next until we have time/resources to work on it again.. Now with real tests (compared to what this did before)!. In particular, I noticed I couldn't reliably rely on model.kernelRef being set and didn't want to add on the reducers refactor here (yet).. Is there a pattern for returning an alternate component if we can't create the suite of props that we need to in mapStateToProps?. \ud83d\ude2d \n```\n\nImmutable.is(Immutable.Record({a: 2})(), Immutable.Record({a: 2})())\nfalse\n``. Seems like we'd have to have some wrapper component that delegates to a component based on whether we have \"real\"contentandmodel. Something likely calledas the export still, yet has its ownmapStateToPropsto basically dictate if we're showing a placeholder or the real notebook app. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I'll get something better written up for this.. I should really learn better that I shouldn't have stray gunk in my commits so you don't see me fooling with data. \ud83d\ude04 . Tackled this one by the way.. I did switch this to doing the proper thing with records by the way.. In the Jupyter [notebook format](http://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_description.html#cell-metadata) (within the last year),tagswere introduced as anArray` on cell metadata.\n\nI'm taking the stance that we'll only take unique tags so that in memory we can represent them as an Immutable.Set.. This is what papermill expects for cells tagged for parameters.. This is at the level of needing payload vs. record typed appropriately. I suppose if I made these generics instead that would help.. \ud83d\udca5 . so true. Oh I see. Yeah this doesn't have to say \"Papermill\" to the user. I just put that in the mock originallly and then put it in here.. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . Sweet, glad you figured out how to make the base page. \ud83d\ude04 . SoS looks pretty cool! Integrating with it is certainly possible, though it might be a little bit too much for me (personally) to take on any time soon though.\nSide note: Users can use magics to reach other languages %%R, %%scala, if they have them installed / available. Users can use the single line variant %R or the whole cell variant %%R.  There are interfaces to pass data between these, there just isn't a UI control to toggle languages like is shown in SoS. It goes something like this:\n```\nIn [14]: Z = np.array([1,4,5,10]) # Python land\nSend Z over to an R session\nIn [15]: %R -i Z mean(Z)\nOut[15]: array([ 5.])\nBring an R result over to Python\nIn [16]: %R -o W W=Z*mean(Z)\nOut[16]: array([  5.,  20.,  25.,  50.])\n\ud83c\udf89\nIn [17]: W\nOut[17]: array([  5.,  20.,  25.,  50.])\n```\nGranted I don't think that's the best way (or the only way) to pass data between processes. It's certainly possible though.. need to swap this over to play-extension. Oooooh, I've not seen a Pipfile yet.. Part of pipenv goodness!. Ok I'll stop commenting on copy pasta that needs updates here. \ud83d\ude09 . In order for the app to bootstrap properly, you'll want to change this one the most. \ud83d\ude09 . My only hesitation on this PR is that it's going to recompute this every time it renders.\nPerhaps we should just memoize the processEnv function. At least on desktop, it'll be expensive for anything that renders within the tree.\nat least on desktop, it'll be expensive otherwise. Probably could delete this since we don't have a kernel here (yet).. Oh, will codemirror just recognize this based on the mimetype?. This works for now. I'd rather save be separate, especially since this is going to trigger a save on every single keystroke.. You figured this stuff out quick!. Easy peasy. \ud83d\ude04 You did exactly what I expected to be done for this.. Make sure to use === as standard practice when comparing.. Just creating the serialized data and then passing on to contents is plenty smart here. \ud83d\udc4d . Super!. This should only be \"text\" for the content.type === \"file\". Notebooks are sent over as a JSON payload.. For a first React/Redux PR, complete with having to work with epics, this is so well done.\n. \ud83c\udf89 . There are ways to debounce it locally here. The better option is definitely in an epic where we can debounce or throttle the same save action for the same document.\nI like the button approach for now. I'll target autosaving for this release as well.. Is this a semiotic pattern where these function signatures are not a props bag but it returns a React.Element?. Rockin'. Yes*\n* I'd really like to auto-adjust this according to how long it last took to save the current document. I'm a big proponent of not making things too configurable on the user side and instead wanting to rely on finding the right balance of UX (and in this case ops). If it's configurable for the sake of the server operator though, I can be swayed.. @tlyon3 turns out there was likely a simpler fix of just removing this unused dep on editor here. At any rate, should be much trimmer now.. Does this work when the file being edited is on some path? /user/kyle/nteract/edit/some/path/to/file.py. The way we've been handling css includes is to embed the css directly with our components using styled-jsx (which does mean copying them in...). The main reason has been to ensure that our components can be used without including a css import on the page. Since it looks like Monaco's is entirely done as a css import within a js file and we're only using this in the jupyter extension so far, it's probably not a big deal yet.. Probably want to remove this dep within the codemirror editor.. Probably should take this test out.. Probably can get rid of this test file too since it's targeting the codemirror editor.. \"A React component for the monaco editor, tailored for nteract\". This makes me wonder what else is exposed about the model that would be worth controlling in a higher level model that we're keeping in our state.. \ud83d\udc4d . It's time like these that I'm super happy we centralized our webpack configgy bits into a package for re-use.. Forgot to return here, and the default case was returning empty() so kindly for us. \ud83d\ude43. In the codemirror component we grabbed all the css (from source) and exported it as styled jsx css.. > does that mean if you update codemirror you've to redo that?\nEvery time we upgrade codemirror we go through the diff between the last version we used and the update. If the CSS changes (hardly ever), we update it directly.\n\nAnd what do you recommend we do here? :)\n\nNothing for the moment. Not until we need this component to work outside of the jupyter extension (where people have their own webpack setup) do we really need to worry about it.. It's annoying that it's relative to the html file rather than the js file. I wish we could rely on __dirname as the base (by some magic \u2728).\n. Ok I think I've got this working for other dynamically requested chunks and web workers in #2798. I'm going to see if that will work well for this PR too.. I found out that this bundle wasn't actually being used. This was being set as an entrypoint, literally as if vendor.js was a separate app.. Oh I should update this since section I borrowed it from @theengineear and I's plan doc and we've diverged a little bit here. Thanks, I'll update this.. \ud83d\udc4d . Behavior wise, in this instance the link moves them to the directory the file is in.. \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks for outlining all of this.. I'd probably call this Configuration for Operators or something similar. I'd still want the asset_url instructions here too, which people can use to host a copy of our app on a CDN (or internal network) to keep users up to date while keeping their notebook servers running for kernel goodness.. Good cleanups in here.. I don't think you have to escape this ' since you're using a double quoted string here.. Rockin'. sweeeeeeeet. > Well\u2026 I fear people who are new to this stuff might not know what \"Operators\" means.\nMaybe \"Advanced Configuration\". Annnnd I already want to call this componet <LastSaved />. \ud83d\ude04 . A+ much better titles, I clearly didn't go over these with a fine tooth comb earlier.. Totally forgot to note -- the reason that some of our other icons have \"Octicon\" in the name is because we used Octicons from GitHub. These could be renamed in a future PR.. If you add the //@flow at the top of this file it'll really ensure the flow types in here. \ud83d\ude04 . I can't tell if I like that there's a full Git Menu or if it should be grouped under another menu. I'll come back to my thinking on this.. Hmmm... Do we have to specify these or can this git binding autodetect the name / email from their gitconfig? If it's not defined are we able to help them set it up?. Each of these git operations return a promise. I'd love to get these into epics that we work with, both for sending off the initial addToGitAction as well as responses. Same applies to init, etc. as we also need to handle their failure cases.. \ud83d\udc4d . Style wise, I'd prefer to name this component here, even if it ends up the default.\n```js\nconst HTMLLegend = ...\nexport default HTMLLegend\n```\nOne thing I tend to do is move props to their own type with something like:\njs\ntype HTMLLegendProps = {\n  values: Array<string>,\n  colorhash: Object\n}\nputting it right before the function itself. With only two props it's not a big deal, as soon as it gets bigger I move them out.\n. A+, much better. \ud83d\ude04 . What might be a little scary here is that kernel might not be killed before the window is closed. This epic probably belongs in either the websocket kernel or as part of the jupyter extension itself. We need to wait for the server to respond after killing the kernel before we can close the window.. This will need to be:\njs\nimport { Input } from \"./components/input.js\";. Input here too. \u2764\ufe0f . \ud83d\udc4d . Adding on, the kill kernel action will end up triggering the killKernelEpic from packages/core/src/epics/websocket-kernel.js (see\n https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/packages/core/src/epics/websocket-kernel.js#L297-L310)\nI'd probably make the callback to the concatMap here use the sessions API directly\n```js\nconst state = store.getState();\nconst kernel = selectors.kernel(state, { kernelRef: action.payload.kernelRef })\nreturn sessions.destroy(serverConfig, kernel.sessionId).pipe(\n  map(() => {\n    window.close();\n    return actions.killKernelSuccessful({\n      kernelRef: action.payload.kernelRef\n    });\n  }),\n  catchError(err => {\n    // Not sure if we want to error here or just close anyways\n    window.close();\n    return of(\n      actions.killKernelFailed({\n        error: err,\n        kernelRef: action.payload.kernelRef\n      })\n    );\n  })\n);\n```. Excellent! Thank you for kicking off this new package so we have another version people can work with.. This is definitely the same as NotebookPreview, so I'm pretty surprised by this not working. . I'm running this locally now to check it out.. I ran:\nnpm t -- --updateSnapshot\nFollowed by\nnpm t\nand all is passing now with the expected incrementing IDs (1,2,3,...).\nIf I had to guess, locally on your machine things aren't linked right somehow @benjaminabel. You may have to run git clean -xfd && npm i.\nIf you like though I can submit a commit that fixes things up with new snapshots.. \ud83d\ude06 \n. For the in-memory types I'd prefer to keep camelCase, keeping with JS conventions. For the messages and nbformat, we'll go with what the spec has (snake_case, unless otherwise indicated).. I think the traceback in our data structure here should be a single string, joined.. Now that we've done all this work, we should also make a JupyterMessage -> Output function.. Whoops! No I thought I read this as output_type. Nevermind!. Ah right, this one is weird because the message spec returns them like this.\n{\n   'status' : 'error',\n   'ename' : str,   # Exception name, as a string\n   'evalue' : str,  # Exception value, as a string\n   'traceback' : list(str), # traceback frames as strings\n}\n\ud83e\udd14 \nMaybe nothing to do here then, we'll keep them as Immutable.List. Part of the reason I was hoping to step away from having fields that are immutable is that we can support components that take non-immutable and immutable Record varieties when they're records. When they're Immutable.Lists we're tied into it.. Yeah that's pretty good. Since there's not really an unrecognized output type of message really, I wonder if we should just return null. Perhaps we could just use the unrecognized type, using the header.msg_type and content.. I suppose we could make it Immutable.List<string> | Array<string> or even just Iterable<string> (this is the general form for iterables in JS).. I need to make sure to export this name again since I changed it to only export the component . I seriously have no idea what to call this component that is, in my mind, a redux like Provider (when it uses a named provider). We want to leave it in localstorage because it's what provides the cache. We could provide a utility to clean the cache keys that are ours though. \ud83e\udd14 . I should also fix that!\nI was saying that src/index.js doesn't export LocalHostStorage, so I need to export it again.. So right, cleaned up. Thanks!. Yeah, I can switch it back. yapf was automatically doing this (that or Atom). I'd love for us to adopt black, as recommended by @willingc so that we have one consistent style.. nice!. \ud83d\udc4d . You can just return this.props.children here since no props are being added on with cloneElement.. The EntryProps will be:\nchildren: React.Node. I'm doing some thinking on the interface and it seems like we should make <Entry>'s render be:\njsx\n<tr>\n  {children}\n</tr>\nso that it really is the row. The great thing about us having the children interface is that you can swap order of the icons, names, etc. by swapping where they appear in between <Entry></Entry>. With the change suggested below (making <Entry> contain a <tr> will eliminate the need to use the <tr> here (and leaking the implementation details).\nThis code will then be:\njsx\n<Entry key={index}>\n  <Entry.Icon fileType={row.type} />\n  <Entry.Name link={link} />\n  <Entry.LastSaved last_modified={row.last_modified} />\n</Entry>. The <table> and <tbody> portion of this should end up as some <Listing> component, whose render probably looks like this:\n``jsx\nclass Listing extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <React.Fragment>\n        <table>\n          <tbody>{this.props.children}</tbody>\n        </table>\n        <style jsx>{\n          .table {\n            ... all them styles ...\n         }\n        `}\n\n    );\n  }\n}\n```. Then it would get used like:\njsx\n<Listing>\n  {contents.map((entry, index) => (\n    <Entry key={index}>\n      <Entry.Icon fileType={row.type} />\n      <Entry.Name link={link} />\n      <Entry.LastSaved last_modified={row.last_modified} />\n    </Entry>\n  ))}\n</Listing>\n. Yep! This is the view-only suite of directory components that can be used in these slightly overlapping apps.. This is definitely looking beautiful now. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 \ud83d\udc8b . The styles are all the same here so I'd make this component be:\n```jsx\nlet icon = ;\nswitch (fileType) {\n  case \"notebook\":\n    icon = ;\n    break;\n  case \"directory\":\n    icon = ;\n    break;\n  case \"file\":\n    icon = ;\n    break;\n  default:\n    icon = ;\n}\nreturn (\n  \n    {icon}\n    {<code>.icon {\n        padding-right: 2px;\n        padding-left: 10px;\n        width: 17px;\n        vertical-align: middle;\n        text-align: center;\n        opacity: 0.95;\n      }</code>}\n\n);\n```. I'm beginning to wonder if we can make our interface a bit more generic by doing this:\njsx\nreturn (\n  <tr className=\"directory-entry\">\n    {React.Children.map(this.props.children, child => (\n      <td className=\"directory-entry-field\">{child}</td>\n    ))}\n  </tr>\n);\nor even just detect if it already is a td:\njsx\nreturn (\n  <tr className=\"directory-entry\">\n    {React.Children.map(this.props.children, child => {\n      if (child.type === \"td\") {\n        // Already a <td>, pass it on through\n        return child;\n        // Could always supplement this child with an additional className too for CSS reachability\n        //\n        // return React.cloneElement(child, {\n        //   className:\n        //     typeof child.props.className === string &&\n        //     child.props.className !== \"\"\n        //       ? child.props.className + \" directory-entry-field\"\n        //       : \"directory-entry-field\"\n        // });\n      } else {\n        return <td className=\"directory-entry-field\">{child}</td>;\n      }\n    })}\n  </tr>\n);\nThis will make it easier to drop in new fields without having to change the directory package.\njsx\n<Listing>\n  <Entry>\n    <Icon />\n    <pre>\ud83d\udca5</pre>\n    <LastSaved />\n  </Entry>\n</Listing>. When the component is the one that matches the file you don't have to do the require, you can use it directly. \ud83d\ude04 \njsx\n<Icon fileType=\"notebook\" />. Super legit. And one day we will rid ourselves of this dependency. \ud83d\ude08 . Smart.. \ud83d\udc4d . This one shouldn't be needed any more as electron ships its own prebuilt version now (electron prebuilt is deprecated).. Nice, thank you.. Ok cool, that can be a new PR. \ud83d\ude04 . I think Icon, Name, and LastSaved are still required (unless I'm mistaken), since they're not Entry. . I was totally mistaken. This is awesome! It works if they're in the same directory. \u2764\ufe0f . We can totally make the presentational components simpler now too! \ud83d\ude04 . I was wondering what other apps and native mac utilities report in their tooltip and only my VPN shows one. Based on that, I'm not sure if we should.\nMy thinking here is totally counter to what I usually say with web tools and toolbars. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. \ud83d\udc4f . It looks like we can create multiple resolutions of this same image: https://electronjs.org/docs/api/native-image#high-resolution-image. I realize this is notation from before -- what do the p and c signify? . It looks like d needs a type annotation, based on the flow output.. This works. We could instead return null in render when hidden though.. Could we use typeof id === 'string' instead of checking length?\nThe reason I ask is because if I'm reading this my brain immediately wonders if it's checking to make sure that id is long enough (as if it's a container, like an array).. I wonder if these types are inside react-dnd and that we could use them here instead of having them written by us.. Was this meant to be ErrorOutput?. We should just replace all usage of StreamOutputRecord with StreamOutput here.. Rather, like I said for stream, we should get rid of the *Record types and just use the data structure type since they should be one and the same as one JS object structure.. This is an improvement!. I think the backticks above here need to be deleted.. Oh this was merged, I'll make a PR. \ud83d\ude04 . https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/3172. Hey all good, better to have fixes than staying stale. We can always keep adjusting docs. \ud83d\ude04 . The end parens here can be deleted.. We are on it!. Since right now this is darker than the other icons, we should get/make an SVG that is our divider here.\nHow's the dropdown menu look / work when we have this?. This might be able to be simplified to React.Node.. What's the difference in these? Asking so I know how to apply this in the future. \ud83d\ude05 . \ud83d\udc4d . Ahhhhh, yeah. In the long run we'll want to explicitly set the type for these (actual object structure) and we did a bit of cheating here with Object originally. \ud83d\ude04  I'll use {} now instead of Object from here on out when we haven't scoped it well.\nThanks @jdetle!. rockin'. Yeahhhhhh back when I wrote this it was playing in the background \ud83d\ude01. In development, immer does freezing for you. It might be better to just use immer like was being done before so we're not having to do it ourselves. \ud83e\udd14 . Oh right, one of the reasons that I ended up not using produce was for display_data and execute_result where the mimebundle payloads were different. For flow to accept it, it had to know that we were matching the right type.. I think null is the way to go. People sometimes emit mimetypes that aren't for rendering and are just for forming records. Papermill does this.. Oh excellent, I'll incorporate this today.. Yeah, especially since this is an output type to match the jupyter type.. Whoops! Fixing now.. it might be best for us to bring this function outside the scope of this function and just make it take text1 and text2. . Here's the PR: https://github.com/alexandercbooth/nteract/pull/1. This icon can be kept for now, so we don't have to make a major version change.. :100: This looks like the best of the cookie libraries on npm.\n\nWorks in all browsers\nAccepts any character\nHeavily tested\nNo dependency\nUnobtrusive JSON support\nSupports AMD/CommonJS\nRFC 6265 compliant\nUseful Wiki\nEnable custom encoding/decoding\n~900 bytes gzipped!\n\n\ud83d\ude04 \nThanks! . We may want to enable opting in to this because we use this library in environments where the cookies are not associated with the jupyter API (or even a way to pass it in). For now this is great and I'm happy it closes issues where people are trying to use the jupyter extension!. The from and to are definitely costly. We definitely want to be switched over to Array<Output> as our objects and not use the Immutable.List<ImmutableOutput>. The main motivation was to make it so that we could use the new record output structures directly as the props:\njsx\n<Stream \n  text=\"hello world\"\n  name=\"stdout\"\n/>\n(we totally met in person to work through some of this, figured I'd share the context \ud83d\ude05). Ooh, smart yeah we probably should/could.. I wonder if we want to take note of this class name being old (maybe deprecated). It's primarily Hydrogen that's using the class names to target some styling.. Ha!. I wonder if we should call this component KernelOutputError or KernelError. . Guess we need that named export for easier exporting here. \ud83d\ude04 . I think that's great, want to go ahead and make a PR?. Perfect, this is exactly what I was expecting.. It's pretty neat how this tests the output of Output. \ud83d\ude04 \nWe may want to have a test that exercises DisplayData directly, since this shallow test is only a top level render.. I think it's cool for tests like these, especially since these are stateless functional components that we just use a jest snapshot.. I'm guessing you pulled these tests from the old setup, it might be worth it to switch these to snapshot tests instead.\nThen again... the setProps tests for the component updating is probably a good idea. Might be able to snapshot there too?. Cool, thanks. I might be wrong too, so it's worth looking at what the snapshots look like.. This definitely shows off where we were mid-migration to a new structure for the actions and reducers setup that @theengineear and I went through. Probably worth us figuring out what our final direction is for our state structure and finish that work off as a milestone item.. I'll document this one better. Basically, the consumer's context will be the default value passed in the React.createContext call. When there is no <Provider /> somewhere in the tree (above it) that has this node as child, then hasProviderAbove defaults to null. When this is the case, we can create a provider and render the requested MathJax node.. The reason I tried to implement this API was because the latex and markdown outputs were using this property.. I'm basically saying this.script got set via document.createElement in the above code, though Flow is saying that this.script can be nullable (because of type), even though we've set it earlier on.. Yep!. Each of these seem good to encapsulate into constants. That or make individual actions for each of these that get handled by the epics ofType(RestartAndRunAll, ClearAll, Restart).. I'm so happy you've dove in to using the TestScheduler. It's been needed for a while here.. I'm assuming this is here for overriding for tests?. Excellent, this is looking like a great flow. I'll be curious to see how this works out in practice with flaky kernels or poor connections.. Since flow is happy with these, I'm alright. As long as it feels good to work on, I'd say this is forward progress.. Is the dist ok after all this? I suppose it is since webpack handles building these in.. You are definitely picking it up at rapid pace.. Ideally, we were aiming for the reducers to be composable enough that some things could live next to the core entry on the tree. That or we flatten the structure some more. I'll check out the comment.. One option is we get this to a working state and set aside this as its own issue to make sure that we rectify the types. We're hoping to get off of Immutable and onto immer, though clearly with everything already built that's a long path (we'd be able to do chunks at a time with a perf cost though).. ^^ @jdetle . In that case, I'm happy for us to switch to just src. This will be a major version bump anyways.. Thank you for these notes, hope it helps another person (at the very least I'll know where to point people for this). \ud83d\ude04 . Wow, this is all fantastic and exactly the coordination I was hoping would get tackled. \ud83d\ude0d . I'm super happy to see this moved into an epic.. Nice.. Hmmm... This is likely intended for the jupyter extension and would be in response to a failed DELETE against  /api/kernels/{uuid} (?). . Smart.. We should so extract this into a variable within this function in another PR. \ud83d\ude05 . We definitely need shortcuts, people have been asking for them. I'd like to integrate blueprint's hotkeys since we're likely adopting other components from there (beginning in #3412).. Hmmm, this should be something that stays in sync. I can check out what's going on here. @lgeiger may have a clue too.. @jameskoch hopefully getting you unblocked \ud83d\udd1c , we're pretty close here. The only thing I think we'll need to do is re-bloat the mathjax electron config to match up with ?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML. Yeah this is great!. Oh ha, we'll have to take that out. I added it in thinking we'd use it to manage some local state. \ud83d\ude2c . Smart!. Good catch, this came from a prior iteration I think.. It was a little bit easier to work with this in a flat structure. What happened in the discussion that led to us adding it as an object? Was this to leave room for institution and other undecided bits (email, etc.)?. This is an area where I'm less knowledgable about internals. @tlyon3 brought forward this setup which added in more LaTeX features (?) that people said resembled the current notebook better. We really need a definitive answer on this we can document here in our own docs.\n@mpacer -- what's the ideal mathjax configuration to match well with both classic and jupyterlab?. Now that we've done all this work for tag creation, I just found blueprint's <TagInput /> component which also has some other nice props. \ud83d\ude04 \nI also really like that their examples make sure to point out anti-patterns and what should be done differently in real use cases:\nhttps://github.com/palantir/blueprint/blob/ac38072b019a21bd6d1fc302180010711610363c/packages/docs-app/src/examples/core-examples/tagInputExample.tsx#L72-L73. ~~Not that you need to go after fixing this, but I wonder if there's a good way for us to run this directly with yarn.~~ \nI just found out this can be yarn build:only packageName, which has to be the fully qualified package name like yarn build:only @nteract/transforms.. We could probably make this part of our package now to iterate forward without having to go full zeromq-ng right away.. In fact this whole section is eminently testable since it's well specced (jupyter protocol) and the interface here is nice, clean, and standalone.. This command, as a global command should either be:\n\nthe npm instructions as it tells people how to install the package (rather than work in the monorepo)\nyarn global add @nteract/commuter (that's the command for yarn's global install. It's nice seeing what these docs have, here's another inconistency where it has to be installed globally. Again, we should use either npm install -g @nteract/commuter (recommended for user facing directions) or yarn global add @nteract/commuter.. Does closing automatically remove listeners now?. Oh hey look, you did test it already. Would you be cool with either you or me putting the messages code in a new PR?. Like mentioned above, these sections are npm install --save and yarn add. Sucks that there are two options, that's the life for the libraries though. \ud83d\ude05 . Thanks for the pointer to the right mathjax config @mpacer!\n\nPeople can use our setup along with KaTeX too, this component is scoped only to MathJax. In fact that's exactly what @benjaminabel did for the gatsby notebook renderer.. Also I swear I'm listening now @lgeiger, I'll head over to the mathjax electron issue. \ud83d\ude04 . We're setting the property BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length > 0 in many of these menu items. It only needs to be calculated once, before the creation of this object.. > really I should also do a unique check when updating the list\n\ud83d\udc4d \n\nIf we do want to allow duplicates then we need to change this\n\nNah I think these should be unique, even though this list of objects isn't unique as it doesn't have a key for each entry. Maybe it makes sense to have duplicates for Authors, just not with Tags.. \ud83d\udc4d. \ud83d\udc4d good cleanup . Right now the desktop app only uses ZMQ kernels. We did want to set up a way to do remote kernels, this never got driven all the way through though.. I think hard coding this one to websocket is probably fine.\nIdeally, it's about the host we're connected to for which we're local or remote. It's either a native zeromq host (I think we called this desktop host) or a jupyter server host (which we called remote, even if running on localhost). This area definitely needs a revisit.. Excellent, thanks for the dynamic loading.. Before I forget, we should probably call this nteract/jupyter-widgets and drop the transform name (it can still obey the interface though). Thank you for the README! Probably want to update this path so it's not referencing your local system.. I am expecting to fear what's next to come since this expects a kernel.. \ud83d\udc4d. +1. I think there's a better way to type this in accordance with React 16.. Let me think on what API we should expose here at the top level of the component.. Ok, I'm glad I made note of this. I would make this package expose an interface where it's required to get a kernel object instead of binding it to the whole currentKernel thing when a given page may someday have more than one kernel or content on a page. The default prop can be null and we'd pass the kernel object directly like this:\njsx\n<RichMedia data={data}>\n  <JupyterWidget kernel={kernel} />\n  <DataExplorer />\n  <Media.JSON />\n  <Media.HTML />\n  <Media.Plain />\n</RichMedia>. Yeah, we could make a more ideal interface here. Originally @lgeiger just extracted this from https://github.com/n-riesco/jmp and added types. I think we should make this line up with @nteract/messaging (or maybe even stick this logic in there?). I'm definitely a fan of this not started type, it's explicit in intent.. Thanks for adding these notes.. This won't actually pass the channels down (check out Output in the display area package for why). You'll want to pass channels directly and only to the widget media type. Since this component doesn't actually need the channels yet, you might want to just forgo passing it through for the moment.. Oh nevermind, you wove it through. We'll just have to refactor that later once we integrate the compound version of the Output component.. To make this forwards compatible with the Media components, create a propType for mediaType that is the same as the constant used in the static MIMETYPE used below. I'm going to go ahead and merge this though, so a new PR is welcome.. We use prettier and it automatically does this. I'm surprised the post commit hook wasn't doing this for you already.. Great, this was a good idea. Thank you for the comments explaining why here.. The original amount was arbitrary from me, I'm glad you've bumped this up and stated the intent for cleanup.. This is a definite improvement since the subscription above technically could have been attached forever. Because we take only one event and make sure to timeout, that's not quite the case though. Still wise to unsubscribe in the unmount like you did above though.. This file should probably be called redux-observable.js, though it doesn't affect anything since these become global types.. babel 7 has made this too easy. The main thing we probably have to test is that blueprint css -> styled jsx code. I think we can readily assume blueprint is testing the component behavior (and that we'll contribute more tests to the blueprint code base when we find issues).. Wait, so paths is package names?. Hmmm yeah we want both here.. I keep getting tripped up on this too. \n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. ah that's probably true since we're using babel 7. yeah. This line needs to stick around.. Wahoo!. Finally.. This one was outdated, @lgeiger removed it after @jameskoch's review.. I think once we're on typescript here, we can use the rxjs of.. I'd probably Object.freeze this as well.. Good plan. It's probably a good idea to freeze this too.. The jsx-no-new-object-as-prop rule shouldn't be triggering on style.. The interface I think I'd want is to just have plain objects and functions, rather than this class structure.. This whole time, based on the electron builder docs, I thought asarUnpack went inside the asar config: https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration#overridable-per-platform-options. Wow. No wonder. I thought this opted it out.. Perhaps the electron API for the app root might be even better.. Was this too noisy in this demo code section?. If you rebase, this is CSS is now available via\nimport { blueprintSelectCSS } from \"@nteract/styled-blueprintjsx\";. include this as a dependency\nsuggestion\n    \"styled-jsx\": \"^3.1.0\",\n    \"@nteract/styled-blueprintjsx\": \"^1.0.0\",. suggestion\n} from \"@nteract/styled-blueprintjsx\";. \ud83d\udc4d . I see you're using it below so you can git rm this file now.. Yikes!. \ud83d\udc4d . Wahoo!. It was me trying not to trip on the same logger variable name. I'll switch these around as I was thinking the same as I made this PR.. Yeah this is much clearer, can't believe we didn't have this check before.. This should be media type, we're switching off the mime type naming (same as IANA).. A bit of feedback I've gotten from folks that I should pass on -- it would be fantastic if this variable was named. datum is probably fine, open to something better that will make this easier for other contributors to dive into. Just enough that people can figure out the context.. We can't remove this yet, as we need the current app to work until we switch over to this component.. Within the <RichMedia /> component let's document how we'd set up the 3 component handlers for the two other image types:\njsx\n<RichMedia>\n  <Image mediaType=\"image/png\" />\n  <Image mediaType=\"image/jpeg\" />\n  <Image mediaType=\"image/gif\" />\n</RichMedia>. I think it's ok for us to handle this in a future PR to further en-rich the overall Media portion of the docs.. I'd probably point out here that if folks are looking for a pure markdown component (for rendering notebook in non-jupyter output contexts), I'd point to the @nteract/markdown package.. Excellent, thank you for adding this note.. An aside from this PR -- I wonder if we should splat the metadata as individual props so that we can write:\njsx\n<Json\n    expanded\n    data={{}}\n  />\nI've been thinking about this the more we have to deal with these untyped metadata structures and wanting to identify settings quickly. \ud83e\udd14 . For individual components they should likely just take the literal types they accept. For this one, just text/html.\nsuggestion\n  mediaType: 'text/html'. For this one we can say it only takes a literal (even though it can be changed at runtime) and is fully just application/javascript.. Probably want to stick a warning in about this component, similar to the Media.Markdown docs.. Nice, I just tried the whole \"Apply Suggestion\" inline thing. Pretty cool.. Thanks for making these available to do the migration.. Now that we're on yarn workspaces I think it's much better for us to have devDependencies with each individual package (like you've done here). We were seeing a bit of a speedup in the past to have dependencies like these in the top level so that lerna wasn't going through installing it N times, then reducing it. Nowadays, it's much smarter about creating symlinks for the individual packages.. Ha, I'm the one that put in \"could be an enum\".. looks like a little typo\nsuggestion\n      components: \"packages/transform-dataresource/src/*.js\"\n. Thanks for cleaning out this old unused static API.. \ud83d\udc4d . From the TypeScript handbook\n\nobject is a type that represents the non-primitive type, i.e. any thing that is not number, string, boolean, symbol, null, or undefined.\n\nI am going to have quite the time adapting from flow to TypeScript. \ud83d\ude43 . This is smart for now.. These are all the main fields we currently accept in our webpack config:\nmainFields: [\"nteractDesktop\", \"jsnext:main\", \"module\", \"main\"],\nnteractDesktop is more a legacy than anything else, as it's largely meant \"our nteract babel configured src directory\". Wait, this isn't a hardcoded bit from the happiness dataset is it?. I love that we can import typescript types without an import type syntax.. Excellent. What's the magic number 18 mean?. Each of these thresholds... how were they tuned? How would you want us to evaluate if someone seeks to change this later?. Classically, Pagers hold the introspection output (? and ??).\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nin outputs\ndisplay(pd)\nin pager\npd?\n```\n\n. \ud83d\udc4d  This is a solid intro.. \"This tells our users that the cell hasn't been run yet\". I'm not sure about the ordinal position here, though I don't know how else to describe what is effectively the N-th execution. \ud83e\udd14 . Some form of this summary might be good to describe just above this line, as a comment.. This would make a good comment just above the line.. The main thing is that either the content below this has to have padding that matches the height of this element or that the margin of this element matches the height I think.. Separately, I'm assuming you meant to add this CSS to the notebook app instead of the directory listing (though I suppose we'll want it here too).. The change to cell heading hot keys I'm not a big fan of.. A+. \u2728\nOne extra thing about ExecuteResult that we aren't using at the moment is the execution count.\nThis component is the result of the cell execution (as opposed to display data).. Oh no, I totally don't want to make this class be an interface we have to support.. suggestion. Let's trim this out for now and then update our component to not rely on this class name.. What made this file be required? Isn't our usual index file as src/index?. Is there a necessity for jumping out from the typical node.js callback style of (err, ...data) here? We don't export this file so it's ok that it's an inner API change, would love to know the reasons (typescript ease of typing?). \ud83d\udc4d . Forgive my lack of experience, I'm curious if there's some way to write it like this (example on ts playground):\ntsx\ninterface Callback<Result> {\n  (error: null, result: Result): void;\n  (error: Error, result: null): void;\n}\nthen declare the callback directly like this:\ntsx\nconst logIt: Callback<number> = (err, num) => {\n    if (err) {\n        console.error(err);\n    }\n    else {\n        console.log(num);\n  }\n}\nIt does mean we have to explicitly call with the last argument having a null when there is an error.\n. Oops, hit the wrong button there.\nThere are other spots in the code base using the node callback pattern though they're probably interfacing with node APIs directly. The way ahead is probably to adapt this to a promises backed interface.. I seem to recall from an earlier review that we don't have to declare the React.ReactNode return type here. Perhaps that was only for render() and not for functional components.. Yeah I'm not sure either, this was borrowed and refactored code. @tlyon3 . That's ok for now. We can have a de-any party someday. . The way I think of our @nteract/markdown package is that it's a manifestation of how we render markdown since there are competing ways of extending on top of commonmark. This provides a way to have a consistent render across different apps.. These make me think we should make them named exports instead.\nThere is a way to work with styleguidist where you don't have to do the requires though. Check out how presentational components does it.. ohhhh I looked in here earlier and thought it was transform-widgets. At least for me, it appeared that notebook wasn't being narrowed to a v4.Notebook for me here.. Could have sworn I did a git mv index.js index.ts. Perhaps my rebasing and the size of these changes caused git to say nah.. Now that commutable is completely typescripted with some nice records, we could probably use the definition there. This component probably takes the raw notebook format or commutable format as props and stores the derived state as a commutable notebook. Both those types are in commutable.. There's a part of me that wants to convert these to typescript next. . That would probably explain why this one hasn't been working. I think we could / should just upgrade this one and make sure it's working.. Ohhhh this is so helpful. I wondered how to handle the \"only initialized on mount\" case.. @rgbkrk smacks his forehead. Wow I don't even know what this original type was.. It's ok if these are optionally null though for tileLayer right?. We can probably remove the return here and let TypeScript infer it instead. A lot of these got encoded due to an old flow limitation that no longer exists.. I think so.. For better or worse, VDOM is close to but not quite a total match to the React types. We support a subset React does, though we could allow it to expand a little bit.. This is a slick little subject setup.. Is it expected that the subscriber of this will have to do their own catchError handling?. I think we could probably move these up into the base test config so we can write more tests in typescript.. Or perhaps you don't have to since it's getting tested as is.. In the future you may want to copy the lines directly from the typescript conversion doc in whole, just to make sure we stay consistent.. We're supposed to put the types packages in the root level package right?. We can probably make this one be just a React.ReactNode so that it can also accept a single child.. This is new to me. I thought React preferred null instead of undefined as the return.. We should only need the config at packages/presentational-components. This seems like a good case for using a default prop.. I feel like the prop types can go here too, not sure how the hand made flow defs for react components should work.. Is it ok that Attributes can have other properties at runtime?. This description belongs above counter.. Since they're now pure components, we don't have to test the sCU.. We'll definitely want to fully type our segment of metadata since we're going to have to track and adapt to previous versions of our own metadata (a notebook created today should render next year).. The Immutable.Record is a generic, so you can swap this over to:\njs\nexport const makeContentCommunicationRecord = Immutable.Record<ContentCommunicationRecordProps>({\n...\n})\nSame thing for all the below ones as well. This also makes sure our default params match.. For reference, check out how commutable does it for outputs now.. Then for all the cases in the rest of this PR where you had to as it, you can just rely on the generics in the Record<T>() call. It used to be that this worked on newer setuptools and pip. I think for now this is the right option for us.. Now this one is going to be interesting for the long term.. I think at least for jupyter extension and desktop we make sure to fill this in, it's just interesting to have our default value here.. Nice, I didn't know about this one.. Works for now I suppose.. \ud83d\ude0e . Yay for more specific!. I think it can be switched since it's internal. I'm guessing it's based on the fact that this used to rely on a different codemirror component and now we use codemirror directly here.. Uh oh, this is probably a result of old cargo culting from jupyter land. I'm not sure anymore.. According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50857298/how-to-use-rxjs6-partition-in-typescript:\n\nThe typings for pipe are currently not flexible enough to support partition as a pipeable operator. This code has been fairly old, though it looks like @Carreau may have made this API in codemirror much better since https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/issues/3971 and PRs that resulted.. Wait is this right? Aren't we depending on bundled Vega in the Vega transform?. Looks like a git add markdown-draft.js didn't happen here.. I think we're sending a reduced subset based on https://github.com/nteract/vdom/pull/76, though it does seem that based on the Attributes we're losing a lot of nice built in types here.. I think, though I could be very wrong, that you can put the blueprint CSS at the top level component because of how it's done as global for the top level component. Then you don't have to include it on each of these.. Probably want to delete these. \u2702\ufe0f . Oooooh, I'm loving Partials. This seems like the right kind of thing for jupyter messages that haven't been validated yet too.. \"On this web page,\". I realize that I lean heavily on the phrase \"interactive experiences\" which is kind of meaningless to frontend developers \"isn't that what I'm always building?\". Maybe we should end on \"build your own notebook, console, or your own unique interactive computing experience\".. \ud83d\udc4c . This seems more like replaceEventHandlerPlaceholder.\n\nI think it also belongs in object-to-react's setup, passing in the onVDOMEvent function to object-to-react.. Ok cool I'll check that out now.. We need to make this optional for the moment (with checking in the functions that use it) or provide a default prop for onVDOMEvent, so it doesn't break the current nteract app.. \ud83d\udcaf . Instead of moving the function in, I think we should just pass the onVDOMEvent as the second argument just like is done for objectToReactElement. It just dawned on me these types are likely wrong. We're on immutable 4.0.0-rc.12. Ah we can delete it: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/immutable\n\nThis is a stub types definition for Facebook's Immutable (https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js). Facebook's Immutable provides its own type definitions, so you don't need @types/immutable installed!. I'm surprised each of these packages aren't causing merge conflicts. \ud83e\udd14 \n\nOh you know what? It's probably just writing over this line each time. Git won't merge together little word changes like this.\nWe may have to update this package:docs line after merging these.. This is done now, mostly thanks to @CeaMonster. . Since I realize this is going to conflict with my work in #3718, I'm going to go ahead with this.. Definitely a follow up since I think we shouldn't be doing too many refactors amidst the typescript refactor, especially since they're not hooked in the main apps yet.. This seems reasonable as a step to perform.. I don't think it'll be possible to grab and drop a file to a relative directory below. With the copy config above, have it run in a prepare script.. Oh I just realized this is in the webpack configurator.... Ha, good edition for now.. Smart.. That was from me trying to figure out why builds would complain about overwriting lib. Turns out that was related to the cyclic dependencies. I'll get this removed.\nThanks for spotting this @captainsafia!. Thank you for grouping all of these.. I'm somewhere between this being too verbose and maybe not enough (no use of dispatch with an action creator).. This seems like a bit of a backwards step.. So great to have this package documented.. \"for allowing for practical undo\"\nI realize the absurdity of calling this out since we don't have it. \ud83d\ude22 . > Maybe we can document it into existence?\nOooh good plan. I mean this does lay down the foundations so we don't have mutable gunk leading to absolutely no undo.. Made this use @nteract/messaging. From convo (adjust if I have this wrong), it seems the codemirror type definitions are not complete.. We still need this though right?. The way you can fix this typing is to call partition directly (it takes an observable, as all the pipeable operators do).\nWrite it as:\njs\nconst [debounce, immediate] = partition(ev => ev.debounce === true)(this.completionSubject);. You might no longer have to do this declaration as Observable<any> with the code change above.. Yep, this will need to be set again, otherwise codemirror won't have the callback property on the event down below.. This'll still need to be deleted.. If this ends up getting to be a messy PR for review, you might want to move this to a new commit on a new branch + PR.. Likely example to pull from is how desktop stitches together epics.. I'm assuming you'll bring over the tests for the current epics (assuming we have those...). \"Redux-Observable epics for nteract apps\". This comment belongs above the ofType operator since it's describing that we launched a new kernel and are switchMaping to kill off old comm listeners.. We may want to make AppState a bit loose (maybe this already handles it) so that this epic only has to recieve our base state. Mostly so that any apps that with additional properties can still use this typed epic.. We're now on redux observable 1.0.0 so we can use the state$ stream. Probably good to update this TODO and possibly leave it as a note instead.. This is all definitely highlighting that something is consistent about our prettier eslint setup. Not sure what's going on.. Could probably move this out to another PR, as well as any other messaging changes, then do an interactive rebase.. This 40px is the title header above I assume?. Can this be removed now?. Probably want to point out folks should use react-timeago instead.. I'm glad to see how much this typescript migration has helped find missing areas in the actions.. This needs a few dependencies right? redux and immutable at the very least, not sure what else.. Oh right and @nteract/actions.. Glad to be rid of this!. Since everywhere else uses this as actions we should do that here too.. Did each of these specs not get git mv'ed?\nOh wait they're in core so they got copied from the other PRs into individual packages.. It seems awfully suspect that there's an index.ts in the root, are you sure this is being resolved here? Wouldn't it be using main?. We should probably leave a comment here about the strangeness of <style jsx> not working in this instance (?). Thanks for moving this up to the app level!. A+. Great. This shouldn't import from src . Wow this turned out to be a simpler fix than I thought.. One day I should rework how this all gets called & set up.. You don't want to be using this.state since this should be coming from the props.displayName exclusively via the redux store. Otherwise you have to handle many more lifecycle methods.. We shouldn't need a kernelRef for updating the name of the file.\nAs for the name of this action, I'd call it CHANGE_CONTENT_NAME or something similar (otherwise it sounds like we're updating any number of other things).. Really only need the contentRef and filepath here.. This should be coming from the action rather than the current window's location / path name. The contentRef allows you to grab the content record and the new filepath should be in the action.. We definitely don't want to do a reload, as we'll lose out on anything the user currently has in progress. What was this used for?. You can use state.setIn to alter just the filepath in the reducer, instead of setting up a new object on that contentRef.. Is this coming from the API now?. That's because of the reducer for UPDATE_CONTENT. Right now this PR is completely wiping out the prior state of the content instead of just updating the filepath.. This is effectively deleting all of the content -- it's replacing the original content record with an object (not to mention an object without all the fields).. I stand corrected, you've totally got this covered.. +1, glad you figured out where to add new epics in. Now that we have things broken up, you can import the actions from @nteract/actions. You may need to build core in this case as well yarn build:only @nteract/core. I'm liking the naming structure now.. I'm totally surprised it needs all of these. Then again, perhaps it has to hit the sessions API as well to update that.. When testing, you probably want this to return at least just state so it stays consistent.. Right now this is passing through the action below (falling through to the next case statement).. Wow this is much cleaner now, I shouldn't have done run against an object called middlewares since the usual practice was to have an array of middleware as middlewares. Thanks for both cleaning this up and adding in the error middleware.. Passing mimetype as one of the arguments is making this more complex than necessary. I'd go for bubbling up the metadata like this:\n```js\nthis.props.onMetadataChange({\n  ...this.props.metadata,\n})\n```\nso you don't have to bubble the mimetype up and re-work it above.. This should be an Immutable.Map.. This looks like it's setting the metadata on the cell rather than the output, where the metadata belongs.. Should switch this over to UPDATE_OUTPUT_METADATA. Instead of typing this as Function, you can make this explicit with a type (metadata: Object) => void.. There can be more than one execute_result in a collection of outputs and the data explorer can also exist on output type display_data. Since we don't have IDs for outputs, you'll have to pass the index of the output that got the on metadata change callback.. Was this import necessary?. This was something I thought we needed for the docs pages. I saw it on cell.tsx and applied it here as well.. Yep, can do. I can make this a functional component and then wrap it like this: const Prompt = styled(BarePrompt).. Good idea.. Yeah, in fact what I should do is just make a function that returns the css string literal here, like is used in Prompt.. The Fragment wrapped around this can be deleted.\nAdditionally, for the sake of Hydrogen and others if they want to override the style here we could make this whole thing a styled component they can set things on.. ```jsx\nconst _KernelOutputError = (props: Props) => {\n  // ...\n  return {kernelOutputError.join(\"\\n\")}\n}\nexport const KernelOutputError = styled(_KernelOutputError)& code {\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n  }\n``. You can delete the React.Fragment here as well.. What prompted you to switch to using blueprint's classes instead of?. We may want to put this in an epic that listens forchangeContentNameFulfilled`'s action, so that it's a side effect we're opting in to only for the jupyter extension.\nconst changeTitleAndHistoryEpic = action$.pipe(\n  ofType(actions.ChangeContentNameFulfilled),\n  switchMap(action => { window.history.replaceState(...); return empty(); })\n)\nThere's also one extra thing that needs to be handled here -- the path needs to include the basePath ${basePath}/nteract/edit/${filepath} so that in a multi-user environment it keeps their username /users/kylek/nteract/edit/filepath. It's in the serverConfig -- I can't recall the name of the property off the top of my head.. We probably want to make sure that we apply displayNames to our components so that React tools show the name of the component.. Since no other props are used here, the NameTD can just be the Name component instead of having this extra class.. The React Fragment can be removed here.. Not sure if we need to but we could make this be a styled.table and switch to margin above (so it's outside the table).\n``jsx\nconst ListingRoot = styled.table\n  margin: 0px 0px 20px 0px;\n  width: 100%;\n  border-collapse: collapse;\n  border-radius: 2px;\n  border-spacing: 0;\n`;\nListingRoot.displayName = \"ListingRoot\";\n```. You could let this override the color with the prop like this:\nsuggestion\n  color: ${props => props.color || \"#0366d6\"};. This is just a regular string literal.. You could make this styled.td and delete PlainName entirely.. I feel like this has to run yarn too. Guess we'll see!. Worst that can happen is we have to delete this workflow or fix it, so let's try it out.. \ud83d\udc4d . I feel like @willingc would tell me to also upgrade pip right here while we're at it.. Nice!. Needs more slashing.. I can tell this is now cleaner than the original jupyter-paths code now. \u2728 . \ud83d\udc4c . The only scary thing in my mind about this is that if this fails at any point, the rest of the cleanup won't happen. A case where this matters: Process is already dead (died on its own), connection file still needs to be cleaned up.\nIn case this goes really poorly and someone needs to work around it, it'd be useful for this.launchedKernel to stick around.\nProbably more alarming though are the various cases around kill:\n\nThe ChildProcess object may emit an 'error' event if the signal cannot be delivered. Sending a signal to a child process that has already exited is not an error but may have unforeseen consequences. Specifically, if the process identifier (PID) has been reassigned to another process, the signal will be delivered to that process instead which can have unexpected results.. We also need to make sure stdin, stdout, and stderr get closed (if opened). Perhaps we want the users to register their own onCleanup that we run?. Makes me think we could cache the specs ourselves here.. It's .end() for the streams of stdin, stdout, and stderr. Note:\nif a child process waits to read all of its input, the child will not continue until this stream has been closed via end().. In order to alleviate this error in the CI:\n\nsrc/new-notebook-navigation/index.tsx(51,9): error TS2448: Block-scoped variable 'DisplayNameLong' used before its declaration.\nsrc/new-notebook-navigation/index.tsx(51,9): error TS2454: Variable 'DisplayNameLong' is used before being assigned.\nsrc/new-notebook-navigation/index.tsx(60,9): error TS2448: Block-scoped variable 'DisplayNameLong' used before its declaration.\nsrc/new-notebook-navigation/index.tsx(60,9): error TS2454: Variable 'DisplayNameLong' is used before being assigned.\ninfo Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.\nmove this up above the NewNotebookDiv declaration.. I believe the term is smoosh.. Let's remember to delete this commit before we merge this. I'll get going on the strangeness of deps here.. I just realized I didn't look at this well in the other PR... We may want to include the styled-components server side rendering bits here (if necessary).. We should make this npm run build:packages -- --verbose for our future selves.. These index.ts files at the root of each package were not necessary (we resolve from lib), and weren't doing anything.. I just noticed this one is probably in here erroneously and that we'll need to add it for the data explorer TypeScript migration PR.. I'm noticing we can switch all the includes back to src. I'm going to go ahead and do that.. Done.. I'm going to delete it for now so there's not a merge conflict with the data explorer PR.. Done, will push shortly.. We'll need references to used packages here.. At least this will make sense for folks within our ecosystem.. \ud83d\udc4d . It means you can't have null values in the array and the array itself can't be null.. I agree. Oooh. This makes me realize that some of the magic that enchannel does we'll need to explicitly set here. Enchannel applies generated session IDs and other header info if not set.. IIRC @jameskoch was pinning this to keep builds reproducible, we might want to keep this pinned.. wait really connected components doesn't need these?. Is this because the editor is passed the transforms stuff now, with no default setup for media type handling?. Good little cleanup. Checks out. This one was mostly left here for @jdfreder future work on widgets, though if nothing is in flight it's probably fine for now.. Heh, thanks for finding this.. +1. oh right these were basically jupyter-extension / web specific connected components, and don't include the notebook app component stuff. I see.. /me whistles. All set now!. So good to be rid of this.. Oh, I should go through and delete these FlowFixMes. Admittedly I was being a little loose on this one, not thinking of a name for the key here just wanting to make this match what was there before + pass.. Added this to match the TS definition (this is the param for dependency injection).. Since the type on record only appeared to provide getIn with one param, I opted for the || fallback approach. @captainsafia does this seem alright?. I'd prefer these to be dates, but I need to track down where this payload gets used (is it similar to how the jupyter extension uses the jupyter payloads?). \ud83d\ude2c  I'm glad that we are now on typescript so issues like this one are found (jmp is being injected as a dep here).. This code was wrong yet working, as this was !ing a string type then checking equality, in the desktop app where we only have zeromq kernels. \ud83d\ude05  Thank you TypeScript!. These should be switched to that Actions type I used elsewhere.. Samesies.. This can be switched to Store from redux I think. That or just use the typeof here.. This one is really a reference to the React element for Notification System. I'm not sure what the type needs to be.. These two lines can be grouped.. To try to make it easy to track down where I was inevitably going to type any for common things, I grouped all of them in one spot.. Just looked this up, this can be Promise<void> when the promise has no data to return (just forms a signal).. This bug was sitting around loose it looks like? Or at least, that's what the typescript definitions told me.. These two lines above can be combined.. Probably should declare a type for this.. I think something is up with the selectors or something about our models right now. This refactor has definitely uncovered some strangeness.. This all was way easier than I expected to convert over to TypeScript.. The in-vs-code error for this was one lengthy set of generics and records so I just forced it while getting other things set up. It's shouldn't stick around.. Intent-wise, I didn't want this to be undefined or not set.. Lengthy typescript error involving records and generics that were hard to read in VS Code. \ud83d\ude05 We shouldn't keep it.. \ud83d\udc4d . I didn't even realize we made this. Must have been created during the typescript migration and I was none-the-wiser. \ud83d\ude05 . \ud83c\udf93 . Oh sweet, does this work super simply with this, even with no changes to our configurator? That's awesome. Makes the commuter transition more simple.. Does next-typescript implicitly include typescript as a regular dependency? I'm curious about what the prod build looks like.. Ooooh, this must have been all the magic to make this work!\nDoes the composite: true and references setup work here too?. I'm going to replace this with a NOTE. We should definitely figure this one out before merge.. I think it's ok for us to just make this a new issue.. This is the likely source of our confusing mismatch and lack of reliable typing info about the document objects. My next step for cleanup is locking this down which I think is going to show some incongruence between desktop and web (mostly the datetime format)... I wonder if this is related to how jmp provides an interface for direct ZeroMQ communication as well as an event emitter. I look forward to coming back to clean up the jmp bits, so no worries here.. I think you've captured it best here, which is that it should be an object. Looks like the old code was incorrect.. We could make the timeout configurable by passing it in here.. Slick. I think you can switch this to:\nreturn observable.pipe(first()).toPromise();\nThen we can declare the promise as returning either the success object or the error object types here.. This seems comfortable to provide the timeout as a parameter to this function, defaulting to the (totally made up by me) 2s.. Oh I see, nevermind. There are follow on events there.. Probably good to include a comment here stating: \"Whether the shutdown_request got a response or not, go ahead and clean up the rest\".. This all can be a\njs\nfrom([\n  action,\n  {id: this.id},\n  {status: \"shutting down\", id: this.id}\n]). action isn't defined here (which I assume is a cargo cult from the original shutdown epic). Should it just be omitted?. I'm guessing this was a VS Code autoimport to remove.. I think we should get rid of all the kernelRef logic out of here for a few reasons:\n\nrefs are for the frontend to denote resources that may still be in creation (prior to a POST call)\nThe user of this API is calling this API directly to shutdown and already has a reference to our kernel object itself. They can choose how to route the response messages.\nFor a user of refs, they expect to be able to create it themselves and re-use it. Now I realize since there are multiple events and that we'd want to expose them for transparency, we should either return the observable or possibly make an async iterator(?).\n. In this function we should probably propagate the error from above, even though we're also going to force shut down fully. Something like:\n\n```js\nmergeMap(async (event) => {\n  this.channels.complete();\n  await this.shutdownProcess();\nconst finalResponse = {status: \"shutdown\"};\n  if(message.error) {\n    finalResponse.error = message.error;\n  }\n  return of(finalResponse);\n}); \n```\nNot the cleanest, but does provide transparency for failure here.. \ud83c\udf89 . As long as these match our prettier config I'm happy. Oh wait, add in tslint-config-prettier.. I'm going to merge so we can start using this, feel free to make a fast follow.. This should be done in an epic instead of a reducer for the following reasons:\n\nFor the sake of clean invariants, no side effects should occur in reducers\nThe path must include the user's baseURL. Nice, complete with styled-components conversion!. This looks suspect. I think the return type for setInterval is just number.. Not that you have to, but you can remove the classNames here now.. The class name I put on here before was silly. I'd just call this ListingRoot.. I think you can just load it from @nteract/monaco-editor now.. Definitely get rid of this :global. You can just use .monaco now, since the styled components will target everything below.. Some of these are so simple it's nice. \ud83d\ude04 . Can remove this flow strict line.. Need to come back to finish this comment, got a little distracted trying to figure out how to telltslint how to respect inline code blocks in tsdoc (it should accept GFM, and VS Code will render this inline).. This is a conditional type from typescript that can check that something is a particular type or even a literal (as is done here by checking for false). Down below we check for string literals for FT in order to determine the content model type. Note that type in this interface above is also FT. This reduces boilerplate yet makes this a bit lengthy. I'm curious what people think.\n\nThe Jupyter API will return contents with the content field set to null in these cases:\n\nWhen ?content=0 is set as a query param on a GET\nWhen the content is an entry in a directory listing\n\nOtherwise the match up goes like this:\n\nnotebook -> Notebook JSON\nfile -> raw string of file\ndirectory -> Content[]. Typescript (or tslint?) wouldn't let me write IContent<FileType>[], saying that I needed to use Array for more complex types.. It's ok to leave this with .monaco, just remove the :global part.. Oh whoops that was the next commit.. Oh whoops that was the next commit.. This is great to point out, especially the article. I'll make an enum or use a literal for this.. Yeah let's keep it consistent.. You could probably just turn PaddedDiv into PaddedContainer and delete this extra component.. A+. I'm going to go ahead and merge, then you can do a fast follow up PR here.. The send is missing here now.. Funny how easy it is to make this all fall in place now. \ud83d\ude04 . Ohhhhhh. Oh yeah, that annoying lack of recognition of defaultProps from TypeScript. I wonder if we should use !.. If this doesn't validate, we definitely want to show an error page. Is this handling the case of dataEl.textContent being null? Order here should probably be something similar to:\n\nconst rawConfig = dataEl.textContent || \"\";\nif(rawConfig === \"\") {\n  throw new Error(\"Unable to find jupyter config data\");\n}\nconfig = JSON.parse(rawConfig);. This was a flow workaround iirc while letting us set this global for webpack. In TypeScript we probably want:\ndeclare var  __webpack_public_path__:string;\nset within a globals.d.ts according to an SO post on setting the webpack public path dynamically in TypeScript.\nAmusingly, check out https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/842#issuecomment-323217716 too. . Wow that definitely needed to be deleted. \ud83d\ude05  I remember doing the refactor that led to not needing this.. Otherwise, this is defining a new local var __webpack_public_path__ and we won't affect the global variable we have to change in order to have nteract work on JupyterHub, tmpnb, etc.. Way cleaner than my suggestion, thanks for this.. I was going to use it to target in the button-group above the selector currently written as button-text. Something like this:\njsx\nexport const StyledButtonGroup = styled(ButtonGroup)`\n  ${StyledButton} {\n    margin: 0 10px 10px 0;\n    -webkit-appearance: none;\nSince this button was being used in different ways, I opted not to refactor too much here.. The only other reason I left this was to have one consistent import when refactoring this.. Are there reducers that are going to expect and use these?. We can probably add applications to this setup shortly after types are all set.. This is great to see what the definition needed to be here.. Note: this isn't the only file in this package that uses JSONObject -- I just made it consistently use the top level package entry for this across all of them (only this offender was different).. Probably a good idea, though because of TypeScript's type aliasing it's still a string at the end of the day.. suggestion\n            window.history.replaceState({}, filepath, urljoin(host.basePath, `/nteract/edit${filepath}`));. suggestion\nimport urljoin from \"url-join\";. These actions definitely need a kernelRef though otherwise these actions shouldn't even be created.\nDo we still have stuff that assumes there's only one kernel? Even on desktop we have to assume N kernels because of restarted kernels, switching kernels, etc.. Something cool @stormpython and I noticed -- if you want to use just the payload portion of an action, you can index into an interface or type like this saveNotebook?: (payload: actions.Save[\"payload\"]) => void;. This seems a bit off, but hey if this all passes for now, I'm going to assume we can re-look at this after we're done with data explorer.. I was a little afraid to change the structure too much (I actually heavily modified this one then backed out of it). For this one though I'll at least break out of this nested ternary.. \ud83d\udc4d . I think Payload can be IFileContent<FileType>. Changes were made to make the epics and actions using these to be less any-prone, which led to the creation of IFileContent. I'm happy to do a follow on PR to rectify this, as this PR has been through the paces long enough.. I'm guessing you didn't mean to change fetchContent as part of this, must have been an accidental happening on a rebase.. Same file, above Payload here.. Webpack configurator doesn't have a tsconfig, don't add it here. It's pure ES5 code at the moment.. ```\n$ tsc -b applications/jupyter-extension\nerror TS6053: File '/home/circleci/nteract/packages/webpack-configurator/tsconfig.json' not found.\nFound 1 error.\nerror Command failed with exit code 1.\n.suggestion\n. I'm inclined to think that we should try to make it so that we can pass this as a child from a higher level component. I understand making this work for now on master, so as long as we're not exposing this as a react component interface publicly (consumed as part of a library), I think it's fine for now.. This reminds me that @captainsafia and I both want to turn off the tslint recommended setting of the leading `I`.. @captainsafia what's your preference?. Wow I didn't realize these functions were cheating to get access to the global store rather than get passed it.. Since I had to disable `noEmit`, I wonder if I need to change how reporting works.. Whoops. I sure do, otherwise the type checking generates `.d.ts` files.. Ok, I'm wondering if I should just emit these to an untracked-by-git-location.. My prettier markdown formatting snuck in here.. Reminds me we should probably run `yarn prettify` in the root and make a PR.. We deleted `packages/styles` in a prior commit, you must have had this sitting around and accidentally `git add`ed it.. I find it super weird these are coming up as `Component`. They're not `styled-components`, these are just functional components.. Oh whoop, either that or I should take out `async`.. I've manually set the display name here and it fixes it up within the jest snapshots. That's kind of gross to have to do for all these lightweight functional components.. As pointed out to me by @captainsafia others have faced the same: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51045532/ts-jest-component-name-disappears-in-snapshots. Added the done in and called it at the bottom.. Opting to just not fix these up and instead hope for resolution in the upstream tools (unless we take it upon ourselves to fix this up).. Note: this removes host checking (for now) until we upgrade webpack-dev-server. Otherwise we get spammed with lots of logs. I'll follow up with a fix for this by upgrading webpack-dev-server and related bits.. This reminds me we should disable the `I` `Interface` setting on our tslint config (it comes from recommended).. Super!. This isn't meant to be in the `Nav`?. \ud83d\ude0e . I think it's ok to just make this template string go ahead and use `createGlobalStyle` up here.. Addressed.. Does `dispatch` allow for `makeMapDispatchToProps`? If so, this'll make my editor conversion easier.. Oh my gosh, that's great. I'm going to go ahead with using that in the editor component instead of making a bigger refactor.. Ah yeah definitely..suggestion\n                    \n``. Oh... Interesting. I wonder if there's a good paradigm for having a version that can take a partial and another that must have the props set. We're probably safer if this isPartialand checked below though. One thing though... I feel like we have to requiremediaTypeeven though we set it as adefaultPropso that theOutputcomponent can use it.. Good catch on this incorrectoutput_type. That's the old messaging spec there. \ud83d\ude2c . I just noticed that we're missing the passing of aclassNameinto the<Ansichild ofPlainKernelOutputError.styled-componentswon't actually style this component as a result.. Each of these props should also be optionalheight?: numberin casemetadatais defined.. Could probably name this varmediaType` to match down below.. Oh wait. We don't need this function any more.\nThe order is picked below by the order of when the children appear.. This is documented well in the markdown in https://components.nteract.io/#richmedia yet not in the component.\n\nThe <RichMedia /> component accepts the whole media bundle from a kernel via the data prop and all the elements for rendering media types as children. The order of the children states their richness from highest to lowest.. This original check basically made sure that the mediaType of a child matched that of one in data, checking in order.\n\njsx\n<RichMedia>\n  <Plain />\n  <HTML />\n</RichMedia>\nmeans that Plain is preferred over HTML whereas \njsx\n<RichMedia>\n  <HTML />\n  <Plain />\n</RichMedia>\nmeans that HTML is preferred.. Glad I saw this. The output_type name needs to match the jupyter spec so something (before this PR) was erroneously using the camelCase displayData instead of display_data.. Yet this one has the write casing for display_data. Must just be the test above.. Good way of handling this for now.. A+. @alexandercbooth and I wrote this one like 4-5 months ago. Since we had not done the integration work (like you've done here), we never got to kill off the old richestMime.. \ud83d\udc4d . I still don't want these as direct dependencies within the notebook app component. There must be either a prop ready for deletion or a defaultProp that needs to delete these transforms.. I wonder why this is all being written out here.... The className should be this.props.className. That's what styled-components is going to pass through as the className(s). Typo here, though I think you can now just convert this whole thing to:\ncss\nwhite-space: pre-wrap;\nwith no extra qualifiers.. Doesn't this need to stay as standardTransforms?. Since we're talking about merging this in sooner rather than later, maybe we should take out the custom transforms for now and only stick in the default media ones.. I also just noticed this... Which is definitely going to cause some perf thrashing. It's going to create the object each time. I think because our records have the same structure now due to how you aligned everything on camel_case we can just pass the record output.. suggestion\n  makeTransformsRecord. suggestion\n        transforms: makeTransformsRecord({. What's up with the splat prop on the pager? Should this just be explicit about data={pager.data}, etc.?. We should put these connected components within notebook-app-component since nothing else in this outputs package is a connected component. The @nteract/outputs components shouldn't have to rely on core, types, redux, etc. as we want Hydrogen to be willing to adopt it. The main barrier would be that this would install a lot of things on atom plugin install that isn't even used.. Is the id being put in here for the future of having output IDs? If so, we should remove it for now so we're not leaving clutter that we have to clean up later (in case we don't get to revisit it).. Ahhhh! I suppose you need it for the action though so it's probably fine. Should just call it cellId. I should see if this tslint setting is actually checking for pure immutable props... otherwise it may be suggesting the wrong thing in some cases.. Whoa this shows we were duplicating. Do we need this still?. Smart to do this for now since we can re enable this later.. Something I've pointed out in past PRs. There's a simple cleanup here that would apply to the whole menu. We can store `enabled in a variable before this segment is created:\nts\nconst enabled = BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length > 0;\nThen use it in each of these\nts\n      {\n        enabled,\n        click: createSender(\"menu:new-text-cell-below\")\n      },\n      {\n        label: \"Insert Raw Cell Below\",\n        enabled\n     }\nThat can be done in another PR though.. For now, the way to handle this is with an as StyledComponent<\"div\", any, OutputWrapperProps, never>; after the component declaration. I had to do this in https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/4036 as well.. This looks like an erroneous import.. I'm assuming we're not even using it here then. \ud83d\ude06 . \ud83d\udc4d . Done.. The translate here needs to be wrapped in quotes. Likely:\nts\nconst TooltipContent = styled.div.attrs((props: Props) => ({\n  style: {\n    transform: `translate(${props.x < 100 ? \"0px\" : \"calc(-50% + 7px)\"}, ${\n      props.y < 100 ? \"10px\" : \"calc(-100% - 10px)\"\n    })`\n  }. Below here there's one more styled-components cleanup in &:before that is passing a function in called beforeContent.. Are handlers and byId overlapping in data? Do we only need byId?. I'm really liking how you've done the addTransform here. This is solid.. I look forward to when all the tslint and prettier stuff is automated so we don't sneak in accidental changes to review. \ud83d\ude05 . Not sure when we'd use this but it makes sense.. You don't have to do it in this PR if you don't want, thought I'd point out though that you can use payload: actionTypes.RemoveTransform[\"payload\"] to tie this to the action's payload type directly.. With the refactor you've done here I think you can delete these from the package.json and the tsconfig.json. This is at least cleaner than before and now we have a nice connected component to work with. Well done.. I enjoy that this is clean enough we can optimize it later nicely.. I'm really happy about this overall setup! It simplifies our rendering of rich outputs while optimizing how we work with them. One thing I feel like with this partial rewrite though is that we're missing some of the comments in either the old display-area bits or the rich-media component docs that provide context about selecting the richest. A few of these functions look eminently testable that we might have had prior tests for(?).. Since pagers haven't been showing anything much richer than HTML or Plain most of the time, I think this is a good solution. Also it's ok to use <RichMedia> from @nteract/outputs here.. Yup, looks like you can take transform-* and jupyter-widgets out of here since they're not getting used in notebook-app-component anymore.. Thanks for declobbering this namespace. \ud83d\ude04 . OMG. You have opened my eyes to a typescript feature I have always needed. Thank you.. I can not handle all this power.\n\n. That's looking cleaner to lose the indirection. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\ude0e . Hmmmm... Is jupyter extension missing @nteract/outputs or is it not relevant here?. Oh I see. This dep needs to be moved into applications/jupyter-extension/nteract_on_jupyter/package.json. In case you're wondering, the two package.json are here because of how python modules are always one extra nesting and we ship the assets with the package.. Does RichMedia come with default children to handle media types?. We need to do one of two things with notebook-preview. Either we deprecate it entirely (and people are expected to build their own notebook with our other components) or we have to allow accepting some kind of prop for the media stuff. It could be a children prop that we re-use wherever we need it. We'd iterate through the children to see if there's a RichMedia defined within:\ntsx\n<NotebookPreview>\n  <RichMedia>\n    <FancyTable />\n    <Media.HTML />\n  </RichMedia>\n</NotebookPreview>\nI'm not sure I'm real worried about making more APIs so maybe deprecation of notebook-preview is fine?. Same comment I made about notebook-preview applies here too.. Typically we get back text/plain for this message type on the overall bundle. Trigger it with ctrl-shift-space on a module or keyword I believe. Probably worth clarifying that we mock / fake implement properties on the window object because JSDOM either doesn't support them or has only a partial implementation.. At the top of this file I think we can disable these 3 rules for the whole file:\njavascript\n/* tslint:disable:no-empty no-console only-arrow-functions */. I wonder if the reason we defined these as regular function is so it doesn't have a bound this (?). For this file we should add // tslint:disable:object-literal-sort-keys to the top so that tslint doesn't warn when it's for files we write to disk that we want to match the order jupyter writes them in.. This still remains to fix, since it's basically a mixin that needs to move up into our props section. May take a bit of thinking to refactor up.. Do we want all these skipped?. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . I'm not sure if we should force the gitlens one on folks.. Alright, that works for me.. These are wrong... I'm not sure what they're doing here.. I wonder if it's from redux-immutable implicitly. We specify 4.0.0-rc.12 everywhere.. Whoops!\nThis should be the version in the repo itself.. Since I think all that @captainsafia was trying to incorporate here was cpu and memory, perhaps I should tidy this up to only surface those two properties.. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Oh I bet it's parent PID.. You know how our the .ipynb files on disk show source code like this:\n\"source\": [\n        \"import IPython\\n\",\n        \"IPython.display.display({'application/geo+json': geojson}, raw=True)\"\n      ]\ndemultiline turns that into:\n\"import IPython\\nIPython.display.display({'application/geo+json': geojson}, raw=True)\"\nand remultiline turns it back into the array of strings.. In this case we don't because they're Immutable.Records. Much better read, thank you.. I'm going to submit a slight change to this wording, though I'm not sure how much better I made it.. Good catch.\nMedia types everywhere. I'm not understanding what to do here.. Oh darn this should be switched to that JSON item we use in other places, to include the other primitives.. Ha. Now everyone knows how I check to see if typescript is really checking things.. I honestly borrowed this from MDN, so I would hope there's good reason. I'm with you on the assumption strings are immutable. Maybe it's properties aren't?. 0_____0. Whoops that's what was meant to be used.. Wow I think this is a result of multiple iterations of flow and typescript that led to this happening. Our code is close to what's on MDN for deep freeze. This seems like something I can clean up and provide a better readonly type for it.. I'll go ahead and merge this, though we can now make our import be import DataExplorer from \"@nteract/data-explorer\". Nice! That turned out to a be a nice tidy change to the test shim for these.. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . reasonable. I feel like these == checks are making sure we're not getting null | undefined.. Thanks for dropping some of the rules for now so we can iteratively get to a better state.. \u2764\ufe0f . Nice to see these little cleanups throughout.. Wow to this day I still haven't tried n. I've been using nvm.. I suppose we should export these too.. Tests! \u2764\ufe0f . This puts the bundle.bg as the className. Does this... only make sense when useClasses is true? Would this end up putting rgb(0,0,0) as a className with the right conditions?. Answered my own question just now. It's either the inline style from the bundle or the classes.. Nice! Yeah I've been using this one with much developer happiness.. Wow I didn't know about this. I wonder if this means I should disable csslint in my vscode setup.. Wow these are all so much more readable for intent now.. Can remove the comment at the end here now.. Is this able to be satisfied because of the codemirror definition now?. Probably a good call to leave a note for this. \ud83d\ude04  \ud83d\udc4d . This is one where I don't think it matches quite right. If portFinderOptions is not sent in with one of the values then the default is not applied for the other options.\nHowever since this function is only used internally I think we can just assume they have to pass this object in.. There's one other channel type we likely have to keep though it's not represented here with any messages -- control.. Might as well.. Could be good to look more deeply at the definitely typed types for Editor to see if it already exists or there's another way to look at this(?).. It seems so strange that this snapshot is removing the end of a fragment yet not the start of one. \ud83d\ude27 . Did you end up finding out what was going on here?. Superb.. A+. Everything else in the PR looks A-OK. Want to remove this debugger line then we can merge it?. As in export the names that will be used, so someone can read/use them programmatically or at the very least be able to test against them.. It'd be alright to use jest snapshots here too. I do realize some of the old tests had some anti-patterns. In the future it'd be cool to make the tests something like:\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport renderer from 'react-test-renderer';\nit('can render with classnames', () => {\n  const tree = renderer\n    .create({hello ${GREEN_FG}world})\n    .toJSON();\n  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();\n});\n```\nHowever I wouldn't worry about it for this PR. Would be a nice follow up if you've got the time.. Now that I see the snapshot below, it's probably best we don't include className if we're not using it.. suggestion. This caused a regression, as switchMap sends 4 arguments on each item passed through. We only want the first and don't care about the rest. Without this, the of gets all the arguments which ends up turning each of the arguments into new items in the stream. This tslint rule assumes too much from the callee.... All good, I put a fix into https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/4098. Is tslint trying to make you specify it here? If the type isn't getting auto-determined, I wouldn't explictly make it any for these. It should pick up on the fact that we're creating functions that take state and return props.. Is selectors.content not returning a decent type here?. Should we be providing some jest mocks for kernelspecs and launching, or just assume we want full integration tests here?. We could use jest snapshots here! Then, coupled with the mock for the raw call this would come out consistently. We'd assume our fs-kernels does the heavyweight lifting and real testing there.. I'm assuming this is for testing? Can you leave a comment about this?. One of the reasons I put the server inside the main is for if/when we need to create other resources asynchronously.. I think, instead of exporting server that we export a function called createServer for the inevitable day when we have to pass options. Otherwise we're exposing ourselves to having the same singleton class in every use of this server.. Should we have a cli.js and a server.js file?. The reason we were using ImmutableMap as the name was to make sure we weren't shadowing the ES6 Map.. Not that you have to here, but Map takes a generic. Perhaps typescript is autodetecting this one properly.. Yeah, it's less of a typescript issue and more of a human-issue. Since we get random contributors, it makes it explicit which is which within here.. With hotkeys we have to register it with both their callback and create our own global document listener for the keybinding?. Oh I see, one for keydown and one for keyup. What's the background on this?. I'm glad to see this is react-hotkeys' KeyMap so that we're not creating our own setup here.. Is it ok that these annotations aren't in the snapshots anymore (should they be here)?. Wow that's quite a change in definitions. I'll hope for correct here now. \ud83d\ude05 . I just noticed I deleted the wrong one of these, though this is fine since we already moved these styles up and out. Time to see what CI says. . I probably should have noticed this before, but this should be in a makeMapDispatchToProps since the content ref should remain the same and we shouldn't re-create these on every render.. Feel free to come back to this in a new PR (unless you're already making the change).. Is title only ever going to be the constants above or is it really a string?. I'd probably leave the TODO out or reference dx since todo bot will immediately make an issue after we merge it.. If you wanted to, since you don't have to have an exact action to match each handler, you could make CHANGE_CELL_TO_MARKDOWN even though it's going to use the same actions.changeCellType.. I'm a little bit confused about the necessity of this because we can tell if bookstore is enabled by looking at self.config.NotebookApp.nbserver_extensions[\"bookstore\"]. This can be set in an init for NAppHandler like this:\npython\n    def initialize(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.bookstore_enabled = self.config.NotebookApp.nbserver_extensions[\n            \"bookstore\"\n        ]\nThis does mean we'd want the bookstore module to be in charge of its own validation.. \ud83d\udc4d . Whoops! You're so right and bookstore needs to switch to using initialize too for its handlers. \ud83d\ude2c . Guh, I did git mv, but apparently I changed too much for this to be counted as the original version of this file. If anyone wants to see this history together, let me know and I'll re-do this as new commits.. Ah, looks like we're passing in metadata as an Immutable.Map, which is great for performance and not very good for components to deal with.. Note: this is 2.0.0 because we used to have an @nteract/styles package that we aren't using.. This might all be optional since we are only using this package for css. Figured it didn't hurt to put some ts boilerplate in to make it part of the project references.. I'm a little nervous about this being a side effect in an action creator. I think we can just put the window.open call into the menu directly as a special case. If we still want to log something / have it noticed in the reducers, we can dispatch this still, just without the side effect.. Just realized this should be window.open(urljoin(appBase, \"nteract/edit\"), \"_blank\") or something similar to that.. This is the majority of the fix we needed, though it's buried under the necessity of passing cellFocused through. Since plucking that property off again was needlessly complex I just refactored the components in this file to take props.. Instead of creating this here, I'd do it at the top of the module.. Wait, so is the kernelRef here even used? I'm assuming it's looked up via the contentRef instead?. This TODO can be removed so that the TODO bot doesn't add this (again). @captainsafia handled this for the GeoJSON transform IIRC.. The way I'd do this is:\n```ts\nconst makeMapDispatchToProps = (dispatch: Dispatch, ownProps: NotebookProps) => {\n  const { contentRef } = ownProps;\n  return function mapDispatchToProps(state: AppState) {\n    const content = selectors.content(state, { contentRef });\nif (!content || content.type !== \"notebook\") {\n  return { \n    // likely just return some unbound segment of these?\n  };\n}\n\nconst kernelRef = content.model.kernelRef; // this is the active kernelRef\n\nreturn {\n  addTransform: ...,\n  INTERRUPT_KERNEL: () => dispatch(actions.interruptKernel({ kernelRef })),\n  // ...the rest of them\n\n}\n}\n``. Alternatively, we can set thekernelRefin thepropsviamapStateToProps` then pass them to the respective handlers (?).\nThis leads me to believe we probably shouldn't use state in mapDispatch though -- https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/535#issuecomment-257692617 . Whoop!\nYeah we'd have to weave in kernelRef via mapStateToProps via the state, then pass the kenrelRef into the functions for dispatch.. O_____O. ",

I think it's a good new-contributor-friendly issue. I cannot speak to everyone's workflows but I've seen the issue brought up quite often on the Jupyter list so it doesn't hurt to have it.\n. To start (read: beta), we would have all our configuration options \"hidden\" in the nteract.json file. We would have them documented in a release README but there would be no preferences panel for users to graphically change their configuration. Similar to what I did with the theme configuration, we would have a defaultCellType attribute in the ConfigRecord. The Add New Cell keyboard shortcut would be replaced so that instead of adding a new code cell by default it would add a new defaultCellType cell. Also, we would read from the config when the notebook component is mounted to figure out what the first cell in the notebook should be (right now, it is a code cell).\nLater, perhaps for RC, we could add a visual configuration panel where someone could hit nteract > Preferences and a new BrowserWindow would pop out with our preferences pane. Considering the kind of events we want to make configurable now (default kernel, default cell type, theme) the preferences pane will likely just be set up as a form with select dropdowns or whatever other form input makes sense for the data type of the configuration.\nThen we would just hook up the onChange event for each select with a dispatch to the SET_CONFIG_KEY  action.\n.

Yeah, now I just gotta see if they have an electron API for status bars.\n. That makes sense. Might makes sense to also use React for the status bar since we used it for context menus...\n. :dancer: \n. Heck yeah! We've got a menu!\n:sparkles:\n. Sehr gut, @rgbkrk!\n:dancer: \n. Yay!\n:+1: :smile: \n. I got 99 problems....\n. Closed.\n:tada: \n. This can be closed since it was implemented in #922.\n. I think the mockup is a great design, but I would make some adjustments to the colors. For the sake of improved accessibility for vision-impaired users, we should increase the contrast in the colors that we use for the webpage. I'll cook up my thinking of the colors in Sketch.\nLet me  try writing the Immutable/Commutable dev guide in the same voice as the CONTRIBUTING.md I just PRed.\n. sweats nervously\n\nOn Feb 29, 2016, at 10:15 PM, Kyle Kelley notifications@github.com wrote:\n@captainsafia I'm going to create nteract/docs for now and look forward to your PR!!!\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n.

It should've used name from package.json after checking to see if productName was null per this. For some strange reason, maybe Electron is pulling the name from its package.json inside node_modules?\n. I found this, but can't confirm its the cause.\n\u00af(\u30c4)/\u00af\n.

This also applies to any commands that are sent to the kernel. So for example, something like training = pd.read_csv('data/training.csv') would not work. From what I looked into, this happens because process.cwd() points to the directory the application is being run from, ~/dev/nteract in this case and /Applications/Contents/nteract/blah when we package it.\nI'm looking into how the current working directory can be changed in Electron apps, and specifically how Atom does it. This seemed to be the most relevant issue specifically, the last comment. I tried this on launch but it didn't affect pwdinside the notebook.\nI know that in jupyter/notebook the KernelManager sets a path that is relative to the current working directory when it starts a kernel so maybe we have to do something like this?\nAnyway, this is a bit of an incoherent brain-dump but this issue makes writing notebooks read/write commands relative to the \"real\" working directory no fun!\n. Just kidding, I realized while working on something else that newKernel takes a cwd so maybe there was something funky going on when I ran it. I'll have to look into it.\n. This is no longer an issue.\n. Hello @ankostis! The error that you are getting is due to the fact that Windows is unsupported at the moment. We are working on creating statically-built bindings for zmq on Windows over at zmq-prebuilt. We currently have OS X support and I'm currently working on Linux support. I'm hoping to tackle Windows next.\nIf you'd like to help out with the effort, I'd be glad to talk with you through it, otherwise we should have a Windows version by the end of this month.\n. Ha! You beat me to it, @rgbkrk! I'm a bad little programmer who doesn't read the docs!\nI'll take a look at how things are done in the language menu.\nI will cherry-pick my commits when this is done.\n. OK. This \"works\" but might be \ud83d\udca9. Also, I'm thinking that we could test this (and other menu handlers) with spectron (per #411) eventually.\n. Will be making updates to commutable in parallel.\n. This is stale. Opening another.\n. I migrated Jon's comment and added checklist to the new PR: #510.\n. \ud83d\udca9 !

Hello, @rkpatel33! Thanks for opening this issue. Let's see if we can figure it out.\nCan you try doing View > Toggle Developer Tools and see if there are any errors in the console?\n. Hm. I see. It looks like you are working off the latest master and don't have everything set up properly since we've upgrade to Node 6.\nMake sure that you have Node 6 installed, if you installed node using brew you will need to run brew update then brew upgrade node to get Node 6. After that, remove (rm -rf) your node_modules and run npm install again. Let me know if that works!\n. I think this was addressed in #518 and can be closed.\n. Guh. I'm not sure why this executeCell test keeps timing out and why it only happens on this PR. I'll investigate later, but these should move us forward on coverage.\n. I think this is good for merge. To resolve the issue with the executeCell test I took some code out of @jdfreder's widgets PR which retries the test until whatever weird race condition with executeCell is happening is avoided.\n. Hello, @ZECTBynmo! Welcome to nteract and thanks for opening this issue.\nI'm going to assume that when you say CoffeeScript mode, you mean you'd like to run CoffeeScript code in the executable code cells. If that is the case, you will need to install the CoffeeScript kernel on your machine. Afterwards, you'll see CoffeeScript under the \"Language\" menu in the nteract application. Give that a go and let me know if you need help with anything.\n. Hello, @ZECTBynmo! Checking to see if you got this working so I can close this issue if possible.\n. Nice!\n. I'll open another PR later today with fixes and do a more thorough pass for this in the code.\n. Jon's summary from #419:\nOkay, this post may not be comprehensive, but it's all I've thought about now.\nI think you'll want to tackle this in steps,\nFirst\nYou'll want to make sure that the document state is decoupled from the rest of the application state.  For example, in the following app state:\njs\n{\n  cellPagers: Map,\n  cellStatuses: Map,\n  channels: Object,\n  connectionFile: \"/run/user/1000/jupyter/kernel-aaf19a34-c0da-4968-bc2f-d2f8c8ba904b.json\",\n  executionState: \"idle\",\n  filename: \"/home/jon/github.com/nteract/nteract/intro.ipynb\",\n  focusedCell: \"260f6a26-9623-46b7-a83f-ce5f1830d21a\",\n  github: module.exports,\n  notificationSystem: Constructor,\n  spawn: ChildProcess,\n  notebook: {\n    cellMap: {\n      \"260f6a26-9623-46b7-a83f-ce5f1830d21a\": {\n        cell_type: \"markdown\",\n        metadata: {},\n        source: \"a\"\n      },\n      \"2bc3af2b-43e7-4284-94a4-1bf135b15110\": {\n        cell_type: \"code\",\n        execution_count: 2,\n        metadata: {\n          collapsed: false\n        },\n        outputs: [ ],\n        source: \"b\"\n      },\n    },\n    cellOrder: [\n      \"260f6a26-9623-46b7-a83f-ce5f1830d21a\",\n      \"2bc3af2b-43e7-4284-94a4-1bf135b15110\",\n    ],\n    metadata: {\n      kernelspec: {\n        display_name: \"Python 3\",\n        language: \"python\",\n        name: \"python3\"\n      },\n      language_info: {\n        mimetype: \"text/x-python\",\n        nbconvert_exporter: \"python\",\n        name: \"python\",\n        pygments_lexer: \"ipython2\",\n        version: \"2.7.10\",\n        file_extension: \".py\",\n        codemirror_mode: {\n          version: 2,\n          name: \"ipython\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    nbformat: 4,\n    nbformat_minor: 0\n  },\ncellPagers, cellStatuses, focusedCell, notebook probably should be\nrecorded in the undo/redo stack.  It may make sense to sort the state (this is\nsomething we'll have to do when we get to implementing RTC anyways):\njs\n{\n  appState: { ... },\n  userState: {\n    cellPagers\n    cellStatuses\n    focusedCell\n  },\n  documentState: {\n    notebook\n  }\n}\nSecond\nYou'll want two stacks in the application state, undo and redo.  \njs\n{\n  appState: {\n    undo: [],\n    redo: [],\n    ...\n  },\n  userState: {\n    cellPagers\n    cellStatuses\n    focusedCell\n  },\n  documentState: {\n    notebook\n  }\n}\nand two corresponding reductions, SET_FORWARD_CHECKPOINT and \nSET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT.  SET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT takes the current userState\nand documentState and stores it in the appState under an undo stack.  For \nexample, this would result in:\njs\n{\n  appState: {\n    undo: [\n      {\n        userState,\n        documentState,\n      },\n    ],\n    redo: [],\n    ...\n  },\n  userState: {\n    cellPagers\n    cellStatuses\n    focusedCell\n  },\n  documentState: {\n    notebook\n  }\n}\nYou'll want to have sane limits on the number of recorded undo and redo actions.\nSET_FORWARD_CHECKPOINT does the same thing but into the redo stack.\nLastly, the corresponding action for the SET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT reducer should\nhave a flag that optionally clears the redo stack (via a CLEAR_REDO reducer).\nThird\nCreate UNDO and REDO actions & reductions.\nUNDO action will do the following:\n- abort if undo stack length = 0\n- SET_FORWARD_CHECKPOINT\n- UNDO reduction: pop state from undo stack over userState and documentState\nREDO action will do the following:\n- abort if redo stack length = 0\n- SET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT (clear redo = false)\n- REDO reduction: pop state from redo stack over userState and documentState\nForth\nCall SET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT (clear redo = true) at the beginning of relevant, \ntop-level user actions.\nFifth\nImplement menu items that point to the UNDO REDO reduction actions.\nChecklist\n\n[x] Add SET_FORWARD_CHECKPOINT and SET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT reducers\n[x] Add tests for SET_FORWARD_CHECKPOINT and SET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT reducers\n[x] Add CLEAR_FUTURE reducer to erase entire future stack (stack of redos)\n[x] Add tests for CLEAR_FUTURE\n[x] Add clearFuture flag to SET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT\n[x] Add tests for SET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT with clearFuture flag\n[x] Add UNDO and REDO reducers for popping items of past and future stack\n[x] Add tests for UNDO and REDO reducers\n[ ] Identify notebook actions that should trigger an push to the past stack\nDelete cell\n[ ] Remap Undo and Redo menu options\n[ ] QA test entire thing\n. I'm a little bit stuck on how to get the UNDO/REDO reducer working.\n\nSo far, I'm thinking of having a an UNDO/REDO app reducer that pops out the appropriate element from the list.\nI'm also thinking of having an UPDATE_DOCUMENT document reducer that overwrites the current document with a newDocument.\nI'm a little confused as to how to connect the two since each reducer operates on a certain part of the state and there is no way to access the document state/reducers from inside the app state/reducers.\nAdvice appreciated.\ncc: @rgbkrk @jdfreder \n. @jaredly \u2014 Yep! That was the approach that I started in #419. But we've since upgraded our state store from holding everything in a single store to holding the state relevant to the app and the state relevant to the document in separate stores.\nThe problem would persist in that implementation as well because you would need a reducer that has broader access outside just app or state.\nI'm reading up on how to create reducers with broader access at the moment.  \nEDIT: Or whether it is a good idea to do this.\n. This is close to done-ish. I'm working on QAing and making sure that everything works squeaky clean. Hoping to have it wrapped up either tonight or tomorrow AM!\n. OK! I think this is good to be merged. I did some QA and it seems to be working as intended. You can currently undo and redo cell deletions, additions, and sticky celling. More actions can be added as it makes sense.\nHere's a quick overview of how it works.\n1. SET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT appends items to the past stack.\n2. triggerUndo middleware calls the SET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT reducer on store.document if action.type is one of the actions that is considered undoable.\n3. UPDATE_DOCUMENT overwrites store.document with the newDocument passed to it.\n4. When the user hits undo, the last items is selected from the past stack and set to UPDATE_DOCUMENT. Then SET_FORWARD_CHECKPOINT is called to add it to the redo stack. Then UNDO is called which pops the last item off the stack.\n5. When the user hits redo, the last item is selected from the future stack and passed to UPDATED_DOCUMENT.\nAnyways, I think this is good for review and entry into master and we can iterate on it from there.\n. OK! Rebased!\n. Nice! Thanks for submitting the PR!\n. > This only keeps the app state as a Record before the first reduction. It's a normal object after (need to change all the reducers too).\nOHHHH!\n\n(I'll tackle this right now, amusingly I have this in a branch too).\n\nSweet! I'll merge when you're ready.\n. Waiting on our old pal, Travis! \ud83d\udc66 \n. OK. I reworked this a little bit from.\n{\n  app: {}\n  documentMetadata: {\n    past: [],\n    future: [],\n    filename: '',\n    document: {}\n  }\n}\nto\n{\n  app: {},\n  metadata: {},\n  document: {},\n}\nI did this for a couple of reasons.\n1. I read the Redux docs a little bit more and learned that there really isn't a way to do the undo/redo thing across parts of the state tree without referring to the other part of the subtree.\n2. I couldn't get the nested reducer thing to work, but that might be because I am a newb.\nSo the next best thing I figured is to move the information that document needs to know that isn't pertinent cells or the actual document to a metadata subtree. That way, when that subtree has to (irrevocably) be passed to the document reducers, we are at least passing the most pertinent information and not the entire app subtree.\n. Oops. This is opened in #405 but wasn't referenced in #461.\n. I'm trying to figure out how to test this (and by extension all the other actions in the toolbar), but I'm having trouble because it looks like I need some way to stub the context variable in the component.\nI found an npm package that creates a stub of the context in a component but it ends up overwriting the actions in the component so I can't actually call clearCellOutput.\nAny other ways to do this?\n. > On a totally separate note, if I saw the \u26a1 I would have no idea what that was for. We can put it in for now (as the background engineering needed to be done),\nYeah, I had trouble picking something from Octicons that fit this action. But yeah, it makes more sense to have some of our actions in a dropdown menu with plaintext, especially when there isn't a meaningful icon like in this case.\n. > If you split this component into dumb and smart components, you can test with the dumb component + enzyme much more simply (full control of context, props, etc.).\nI'm a silly goose! Enzyme allows you to pass in the context as the second parameter to the mount function.\n. Hard to add Windows support when you don't have a Windows machine \u2014 so I just set it to error on  Windows for now.\nTest for this is very meh. I'm not entirely sure if there is a way to check if a process has been interrupted, at least a way that is evident in state.app.spawn.\n. jupyter/notebook uses its own Windows interrupt module.\n. This should be ready for review and merge.\nI did commit a developer sin in this. Since the duplication happens inside the renderer process of Electron, I couldn't use the launchFilename function located in src/main/launch.js because it relied on the BrowserWindow object from electron whereas I needed to use the BrowserWindow object from electron.remote.\nMy solution to this was very hacky. I copied the launch and launchFilename functions from src/main/launch.js to src/notebook/native-window/index.js where they relied on the BrowserWindow from the renderer process.\nThere is probably a way to clean this up and limit the amount of code duplication that is going on across these two files but I can't think of any at the moment.\n. @rgbkrk: Peek-a-boo!\n. > All good, I'll happily play with refactoring this later.\nOK! I will address your other comments and push. \ud83c\udf89 \n. OK! That cleans it up a whole lot. Although, it is a bit annoying that you can't configure tmp to differentiate using numbers instead of cryptographically generated strings.\n. OK! I feel like this can be merged because I don't want it to be a huge PR.\nThe next steps for this are.\n- Fix bug in commutable and make it so that the newly created cell is added after the current one not at the end of the file\n- Get the position of the cursor and use it when splitting, this will be made easier once I get context menu working\n. cc: @rgbkrk @kenwheeler \n. > What's up with that cell hover state problem? Is the new component grabbing events needed elsewhere?\nDebugging that now. It seems to be specific to the way that the Cell is configured in the test suite.\n. Hello @zackargyle!

Silly Travis!\n. :shipit: !\n. > I'd check that the copy action was dispatch (using sinon spies or otherwise).

Me so happy.\n. Yeah. One of the tests for scroll isn't finished and I'm still having trouble testing keyboard stuff. I suppose it can be merged as is but there is still more stuff that needs to be figured out on the notebook tests.\n. Closing this issue as it requires too much consensus and contains noise. Discussion will continue with relevant parties in an new issue. Thanks! \n. @jdetle and I ran into this yesterday when we were pairing on his Linux machine, as well.\n. > Under the tutelage of @captainsafia\nHarhar!

We can close this an rely on separate issues for 0mq and the associator stuff.\n. I'm down for monorepo.\n\n. Closing this at the moment.\nelectron-spellcheck relies on the Chromium browser's spell checker. Browser spell checkers do not work on CodeMirror elements since they are not recognized as editable by the browser.\nOur implementation for spellcheck will either have to rely on an alternate editor for CodeCells or implement spellcheck via something like typo.js.\n. OK! I will fix those things.\n. OK. Once Travis does it's thing it should be good to merge.\n. I've got the solve for this in an ongoing PR.\n. The linter is still complaining about the console.log on line 65 in src/main/launch.js.\n. YAY! Ready for merge.\n\n. One another note, someone who actually knows how to make things look pretty should take a stab at prettying up the context menu.\n. OK. This should be good to merge.\n. What?!!? Crazy. Somehow this didn't happen when I tested before submitting the PR but I just did it now and it broke. Fixing it now....\n. Wow. What a silly bug. Fixed now.\n. This should be fixed now that we've moved copy-paste logic into the Notebook component. This means that the cell copy-paste key will not be inadvertently triggered when the person is typing in the cell.\nWe can close this for now and re-open if the issue persists for whatever reason.\n. I'll have to check again if this fails now that we've refactored save as into an epic.\n. Closing because I haven't been able to reproduce this.\n. Beautiful! \n. Hi! Thanks for opening the issue. I couldn't reproduce this on my fresh clone of nteract.\nWhen you start nteract does the window with a new notebook open up properly? Also, what version of Node are you on?\n. Bother \u2014 still can't reproduce. Something seems to be up with the way that CodeCell is imported. Did you get any Babel related errors when building?\n. Thanks, @jayphelps! This has been on our radar since we made some upgrades in #571 but we haven't had the chance to get around to it. Your comment is really helpful. I'll work on taking some of your insights into a clean and tested PR and ping you on it for review/pairing.\n\ud83c\udf89 \n. OMG SO HYPED.\n. Hello, @ankostis! Thanks for opening this issue. Let's see if we can figure out what's going on.\nLet me try and reproduce the error on my machine and see if it occurs and if upgrading resolves the problem without causing any other issues.\nTo cover our bases, can you let me know what version of npm you are using and the commit hash of the version of master that you are on?\n. OK! I can reproduce the error but it's simply a warning on my end. Does this issue halt the npm install or are you able to complete it?\n. Yes. #592 should fix this. This happens because we currently have the keyboard handling for copy paste at the cell level.\nI have some tests to push to #592 and then it can be merged. It'll drop coverage because I can't figure out how to test for the execution of instance functions on the Notebook component. \n. Actually, this is a duplicate of #180 so closing.\n. Ready for merge!\nAwkward GIF to show how it works.\n\n. > Amusingly, this un-does outputs and numbering which should likely be atomic.\nYeah, I was debating whether or not to add those actions to the exclude list.\n\nAnother quirk: because of cell focus, this will only undo until it focuses a codemirror cell which then switches to the undo/redo of the codemirror cell itself.\n\nYeah. Cell focus does make this funky. Not sure if a fix is possible.\n. I like this in the fact that it has optional spell-check integration so we can kill two birds with one stone.\nI wonder if we can move our cell-based functions into this menu as well. It looks like you can configure to act on textareas only but you can probably have it run on non-text areas as well.\nLet me dig into this more. I think it would be really cool to have our cell functions in a native looking context menu.\n. This can be closed since we are no longer using context menus for cell actions.\n. Can you add some tests?\n. We just got off a call and decided that we'll just make it so that the toolbar is always visible. Additionally, the context menu will be set as a dropdown on the toolbar.\n. Ugh. You know what. @rgbkrk go ahead and review and merge this.\nIt appears that the issue is with the role feature in Electron. I'm not sure if this is due to some electron upgrade. I don't think we've made any recently.\nEssentially, the role feature that sends special actions for system functions like copy and paste is not working regardless of where the role is set (in an application or context menu).\nI'll work on the role issue in another PR.\n. Any reason you aren't using redux-logger?\n. > Need to fix cleanMultiline.\nYeah I think there was an issue open for this on commutable for a while now.\nPlaying with this now.\n. Merged! \ud83c\udf89 \nSlight coverage drop but we can address that in subsequent PRs.\n. Is there a reason you didn't just rely on react-simple-dropdown?\n. > The main change I'm a little concerned with is in the test utility file. I needed the emptyCodeCell to be initialized as hidden so my test could pass. Is there a better way to do this from inside the test case, or do you think it's okay?\nI think you meant to post this in the PR. If so, I answered this question there. \ud83d\ude04 \n. Updated. I've got another PR going with some component tests so I'll address the component-related issues there.\n. @kenwheeler and I briefly discussed exporting Notebook documents to Spectacle, a presentation tool.\nMarkdown cells would be exported as Spectacle Slide component with the Markdown converted appropriately to JSX. Code cells would be exported as CodeSlide components.\nIt's not exactly what you are asking for but it's an idea that's been thrown out regarding getting presentation formats out of nteract.\n. Gonna try and include tests for our epics in this as well. Reading up on it now.\n. Sure! Merge away!\n. > We can't rely on coveralls for great coverage reports but we can rely on @captainsafia for great tests!\nYou'e too kind!\n. > Note: we'll also need to make sure these don't end up in the serialized notebook (on disk).\nMost def.\n. OK. This should be good to merge. The only untested line of code is in moveCell and I wasn't entirely sure what the function was trying to do so I opted not to do it. For some strange reason, the case where the current ID and the destination ID match is covered but the situation where they are not is not?!!?\n. OCD Safia here \u2014 should our spec files be named using '-' instead of '_' to match how it is done in src/.\n. > @captainsafia your choice, we'll just make it consistent. I prefer the kabob case on files. The _spec you see in the wild is \"mostly historical\", coming from RSpec.\nOK. I prefer kabob case as well (more delicious anyways), I'll submit another PR moving to kabob case on all the test files.\n. Oh wow!

For some strange reason, spies on triggerWindowRefresh and triggerSaveAs are not working.\nI'm instantiating the spy as such.\nconst triggerSaveAs = sinon.spy(menu, 'triggerSaveAs');\nThe test suite claims the functions were never called but that cannot be the case because console.logs that I place inside triggerSaveAs are printed while the test suite runs.\nAnyway, this helps us move along so I guess it can be merged.\n. > That was totally me, wasn't it? Thanks @captainsafia!\nYou need to seek forgiveness from our master, the Great Kabob.\n. Go ahead and merge this. I'll refactor DraggableCell and write more tests for it in another PR.\n. > I should be paying @captainsafia for the tutelage hours.\nI'll email you an invoice tomorrow morning. \ud83d\ude1c \n. > We'll still need to remove these from the saved notebook too, otherwise jupyter won't be able to open it (probably worth checking on this).\nOh drat! Totally forgot about that. Let me fix that.\n. OK. Updated. Although we probably wanna move this code to a utility function within commutable.\n. > In some of these cases, when you already have a notebook it seems to have defaulted in the past to the other notebook which is really sensible.\nDo you mean if you were trying to Save As an already Saved Notebook the Save As dialog show default to the path of its previous filename as opposed to the home directory?\n. Hi! Thanks for opening this issue @darthoctopus. We've experienced something like this before and thought we had fixed it, but it looks like it might've popped back up again.\nAre you currently running off the latest alpha?\n. > yup! on further inspection seems to have some overlap with #548, which remains open. My bad, sorry for duplicating :(\nNo worries at all! We \"fixed\" the issue that you reference but there have been several changes to our launch process then so I suspect this new/old problem is a result of those changes.\nI'll see if I can get a fix in for this in the next alpha.\n. We've fixed this in the current release (0.0.11) via #783 so I'll close this.\n. > Sheesh Safia, I thought you wanted to be at 80% by today -- not 38.24%!\nHahaha! Didn't realize this until I was up in the air and I was totally mortified. Weird that CodeCov isn't retriggering though because my run of npm run coverage is showing a slight increase.\n. Bleh! Go ahead and merge this. I'm trying to take a stab at testing some of the epics but I think I should leave that experimentation for another PR.\nAlso, yay, new PR/commit convention looks great!\n. > Might as well rebate out the executeSpec if it's going to show a revert. It's not like we've already merged this.\nDone! \ud83d\udc4d \n. I think this one is one me. Can you reproduce this consistently on Save As?\nI encountered this when updating the dialog menus to show the home directory on start. It's complaining because it cannot find app from Electron in this case. I wasn't able to reproduce consistently so I figured it was just some voodoo.\n. Another curious thing \u2014 this only happens when Save As is done via a keyboard shortcut, saving through the application menu works fine.\n. Ah! Got a fix for this. PR inbound.\n. I think this might have something to do with the \"fix\" I made in #771 for #420. I think the best setting is probably overflow-y: auto.\n. Ugh. What is it with this test failure?!!? Let me look into it.\n. > I lean on the side of full output and a simple way to collapse.\nI actually thinking have a collapsed output and giving someone the ability to expand it is the more intuitive process (and also in line with how the notebook currently functions if I recall).\nAs a user, I wouldn't want to consume more information from an output unless I had to.\n. This was addressed in the latest release.\n. > Here's another scroll behaviour that I find a bit disorienting. When I click on a cell, the notebook scrolls to the top of that input cell.\nI believe this is a consequence of #429 which is on the beta milestone.\n. @chriddyp: To what extent do expandable outputs (#972 and #1010) and disabling of focus on input (#1055) address this issue?\nI suppose the one case where it would still happen is if you have an input expanded that you are rerunning the scroll to next would constantly get you. Hmmm. \ud83e\udd14 \n. I think we can close this now that we have 0.0.12 out?\n@fperez \u2014 Hope you enjoy trying nteract! \ud83d\ude04 \n. What is this?!!? Insubordination on my own ship?!!?\nUnacceptable!\n. It's probably better to target this for RC than for beta.\n. So I'm not the greatest with CSS and there is a problem with the float on the saved value in the status bar. Does anyone know why it might be happening? I've already tried tinkering with clearfixes.\n\n. > That's likely a issue with the padding. If you like I can push a fix to this branch.\nYes, please! Thanks, Lukas!\n. Yay! This can be merged now.\nAlso, I'm not entirely sure what is up with CodeCov but I've got an updated master and running npm run coverage on my local returns a coverage of 81.75% not 81.55%. \u00af(\u30c4)/\u00af\n. Woot! Added the tag so you can get your free shirt. \ud83d\ude09 \nThe configuration that you will need to change is in our Editor React component. We utilize a JavaScript library called CodeMirror that takes care of syntax highlighting and tabbing and all that good stuff. However, paren matching doesn't seem to be configured properly. You'll have to read through the docs to find the correct configuration for paren matching and update the Editor component appropriately.\nLet me know if you have any other questions, Alaina!\n. > There are shirts?!\nYes! Check out the webpage. You bring up a good point, I should tweet out that nteract is participating...\n. Oh, I see how you are doing the check now.\nParanoid me wants to check for both properties on win. \ud83d\ude28 \n. > Up to reviewers whether we should add tests and additional flow improvements here or in a separate PR.\nI think it is fine to add tests. Looking at this the only things that really need to be covered are the setGithubToken action creator in src/notebook/actions and the actual reducer for that. Flow improvements are probably better for another PR.\n. I feel like the code clean up commits and the comm epic commits should be in separate PRs.\n. CAUGHT BY THE LINTER AGAIN.\n. > Reviewed (with some sections that need testing updates), went ahead and merged since it pushes us ever so forward.\nMost def. I'll see if I can submit a PR to address your comments above later today.\n. > Website still reads MPL: https://nteract.io/\nFeel free to submit a PR to fix.\n. > This is not meant to be a tutorial, but a visual collection of relevant links and tangible examples of areas where the tech stack is used in nteract.\nA consequence of using a presentation is that it general requires a lecturer to augment the material presented. Lacking this, I imagine we'll have a lot of people approaching us with questions or falling victim to information overkill early on, especially with links and jargon they might not understand yet.\nI think the better route to go is to clean up/finish the how to build a notebook documentation that Jon and I started. It presents the same information that you provided but in a more tutorial style which is a more effective way of on-boarding new devs.\nThe best combination in my opinion is light documentation around what parts of the code base contains what (\"src/notebook/actions.js contains our action-creators\") and the notebook documentation that will inform new devs what an action-creator is by having them build it.\nThe documentation for building a notebook is here. I have an open PR (that can probably be merged at this point) here.\n. You can use JSDoc syntax -- they just wouldn't have a returns field. \n. Now that I think about it we probably want to use a different term from Authenticated Gist. I'm not sure what the best word would be but maybe User Gist or something? \n. You need to update your test cases as well.\n. > I feel like the tradeoff here is worth it if we manage it well.\nYep! If we end up having other things happening during startup that slow us down, we can go ahead and implement that loading splash screen we've been thinking about.\n. Oh wow, Stephy! That's an absolutely gorgeous design. I'm really looking forward to your PR.\nWelcome to the nteract community! \ud83c\udf89 \n. > Somewhat related, support for screen readers would be awesome.\nA brief test of VoiceOver on Mac shows that it works decently well. It doesn't recognize some things, for example if I click on an output area it just reads out what it says without saying it's an output which can be confusing. This is a good time to run our app through react-a11y.\n. @AbhishikthaReddy: A new theme will need to be created in static styles that styles the components on the page per the things I outlined above.\nIs there a specific question that you'd like answered about the issue?. > I was talking with a family friend at edX and she was saying that they don't let any product through that doesn't comply with WCAG.\nProduct through for what?\n. Wow! Nice!\n\nWe may want to take out the extra GIF inside the notebook window as well.\n\nYeah definitely.\n. Perhaps a spinner?\n. Closed in #856.\n. I got a little inspired by some of the work that React did without their code overview page. We have the opportunity to turn our documentation to a walk through of our codebase as well. \nWe can accomplish this by having module level comments that describe the overall purpose of the file and its part in the application. \nFunction level documentation can remain as is. \n. Thanks for the pull request, @AndreeaEne, and welcome to the nteract community!\nI posted a quick comment for you to update the code.\n. Also, we follow the conventional-changelog-standard for writing our commit messages.\nDo you have experience editing existing commit messages to comply to the standard we use or would you like me to edit the commit messages once you've made your updates?\n. > @captainsafia, can you please edit the commit message, I'd rather see the way you're writing for the future commit changes. Thanks :)\nNo problem I can do that! If you'd like to see how we format our commit messages, you can take a look at our commit log.\n. Can you add screenshots of the things you discussed above?\n. Nice! I'm curious \u2014 is that an overlap with the cell at the bottom and status bar in your video?\n. > Does this fire more than once then?\nYeah, the skip is so that it doesn't run this on the initial splash window. But as before, it runs every time the user opens a new notebook.\nI'm trying to see if there is some combination of operators wherein I can say \"If this is the second time this event is triggered, show the dialog box and then load Google Analytics into the webpage. For all future emissions, just load GA into the webpage.\"\n. Closing in favor of another PR with the config approach.\n. Mind changing the document name to README.md so people are more likely to read it?\n. Nice! Is there any way to add a background color to the status bar?\n. Yay! Thanks! Definitely easier to read the status bar text now.\n. By the way, @blindingstars \u2013 do you have a Twitter? And if so, are you comfortable with us giving you a shoutout for doing this on our Twitter account?\n. > First, thank you for helping to create a great tool (particularly enjoying the Halloween theme right now)!\nThank you Alexander and welcome to the nteract community! \ud83d\ude04 \nAnd I just realized it is October so our Halloween Easter Egg has been revealed! \ud83c\udf83 \n\nWhen I do that and run the flow script, it creates no new errors.\n\nYep!

Welcome to the nteract community! \ud83c\udf89 \nI placed a couple of comments in line for you to take a look at. Let me know if you have any questions about those comments. \ud83d\ude04 \n. Great! One last thing, we follow the conventional changelog standard for structuring our commit messages.\nDo you know how to rebase your PR and reword your commit messages or would you like us to squash the commits and create a single commit that adheres to the standard?\n. > @captainsafia Sorry but I don't know how to do that =( (rebase your PR and reword your commit messages), may you fix that for me please?\nNo problem, Estevan! I'll make the appropriate changes on my end. Thank you so much for submitting this pull request!\n. @estevanjantsk: Can you give me push access to your fork of this repository? This will allow me to make the changes necessary. To do this you will need to.\n1. Go to your fork of the nteract repository.\n2. Click \"Settings\" in the top bar of the repository.\n3. Click the \"Collaborators\" tab and add my username to as a collaborator.\nThanks!\n. Thanks for the PR, Adam! I posted some comments inline. Let me know if you have any questions.\n. > Do you have any suggestions on how I should fix this?\n<div className=\"input-container invisible\" /> oughta do it.\n. Perfect! Thanks so much Adam! \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\n. Yay! Glad that you're a part of our community! Looking forward to more PRs. \ud83d\ude42\n. Beautiful! Thanks!\n. Hi Grant! Glad to see you're enjoying the nteract theme! \ud83d\ude04 \nWe're using CommonMark which doesn't support spaces in links per its spec so I'm not sure this is something we can fix.\n. Oh wow, what a coincidence! I was just looking into making a command line tool for this so we can get stats to use in grant reports. This is better though!\n. I think this is due to the way that we are passing data from our action creators to our epics.\nThe newKernel action invoked in the menu sends a dispatch to the LAUNCH_KERNEL action which expects the action to be structured like this {kernelSpecName: 'python3', cwd: '/usr/blah/blah'} what we are actually doing now is passing it {kernelSpecName: 'python3', cwd: {cwd: '/usr/blah/blah'}. I believe this triggers the fallback code that has fresh kernels unassociated with a notebook launch at ~ to start.\n. OK. Loading the config on startup works.\nNext step is to update the theme setup so that it relies on the theme key in the configuration.\n. OK. The theme is now set up to read in from the config.\nNext up, set up saving for the config record on app exit.\n. Yay! This works now.\nCheck out this video where I change themes and the nteract.json file automatically updates.\n. Coverage drops with this. Gonna try and figure out testing for those epics as well as refactoring out the fs observables in another PR.\n. This closes #180.\n. > By the way, I changed the commit message verb to refactor since a bug wasn't fixed (though it does close an issue). Thanks for tackling this one!\nWe actually don't have refactor defined as a verb in our new CONTRIBUTING.md so we probably should update it.\n. @peggyrayzis: I'm certainly not opposed to adding typings to our reducers. That would set it up really nicely for new contributors to help out with documentation as well.\nEverything looks good! Except it looks like you must make a sacrifice to appease the Great Linter. :bowing_woman: \n. So say we all.\n. > I don't know how the two package.json structure will work with greenkeeper.\nIt looks like greenkeeper just ignores package.jsons in sub-directories (for now) so it'll be up to us to keep app/package.json green.\n. Most definitely! I'll merge this and feel free to refactoring and test in another PR. \ud83c\udf89\n. OK. This should be good for review.\n\nI noticed that we weren't using enzyme in the tests for Display. I assume this is a consequence of bringing the DisplayArea in. Do we want to move the tests over to using enzyme so it is consistent with the rest of the code base?\n. > Yeah, that's a consequence of bringing DisplayArea in. We should definitely switch to enzyme.\nYep. I can address that and the coverage drop in another PR.\n. Solid! \ud83d\udc4d \n. This is closed in #1016.\n. Huh. That's weird. You first get the JavaScript traceback and then the message that we created. I think perhaps we've added something in our code that tries to loop through the kernelspecs before the app is ready though I'm not sure where that might be...\n. I think the blog post on our Medium is a solid run through. \n. > It wraps up the best of the web based Jupyter notebook and embeds it as a desktop application. Now, you can open notebooks natively on your system. Double click on an.ipynb file to open and begin using the notebook. It Just Works\u2122\nThat sounds solid. I also think this issue falls under the general need for a User Guide for nteract that outlines things like opening/savings, using the cell dropdown to change cells, adding new cells, etc. I think that can be added as a new-contributor-friendly issue for people who are willing to do some self-testing of that app.\n. This is closed via the addition of a user guide in #1032. Let us know if you have any other questions about using the app, @hainm!\n. This was closed in #1032.\n. This should be good to merge. Is something going on with our Appveyor CI?\n. Welp! This one's on me. Wasn't expecting that a failure to read in the ConfigObservable would prevent kernels from connecting. I suppose a good fix is to create the file on read failure.\n. Gorgeous! \ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf2e \nTada and taco are right next to each other. I hereby declare \"Tada Taco\" a thing. It's a taco you have when you accomplish something.\n. Thanks for opening the issue @rornor!\nThe pull request you cited actually allowed undoing cell deletion, addition, and a whole bunch of other stuff, but it was quite buggy so we ended up taking it out. We could probably add it back and  give the ability to undo cell deletions but my hope was to get it closer to a native experience and allow people to undo a variety of actions.\nSo yes, it'll be coming back (most likely in our release candidate) once I get the kinks figured out.\n. @arudhir: That's quite a wonderful idea! Would you be interested in implementing this? It's quite simple and I'd be happy to mentor you through the contribution process.. @arudhir: Fantastic! You can join our Slack community. Once you've created an account, say \"Hi!\" in the general channel and I'll reach out and help you.. I assume you nuked your node_modules and reran npm install?\n. So awesome, Joshua! Thanks!\n. Hi, @HackersSpirit! Thanks for stopping by. You can absolutely work on it. Feel free to reach out to us on this issue if you need any help.\n. Bleh! Linter just caught me on to the fact that we really don't need to propagate the focused property down to the individual CodeCell at all. I can remove outputFocused and all that other stuff because the only thing the focused is used for is setting the styling at the <Cell/> level. So focused is really just a relationship between Notebook and Cell not Notebook and Cell and CodeCell and MarkdownCell. I think we can safely remove the property from MarkdownCell too.\n. > What happens when you hit up and down when inside a cell? Does it still navigate to the next and prior cell?\nArgh! Good catch. It only navigates well between adjacent cells. So pressing up and down repeatedly doesn't work. Hmmm. \ud83e\udd14 \n. I guess this just means that focus needs to be propagated down to CodeCell and MarkdownCell but not Editor.\n. Closing in favor of a fresher PR.\n. Hello @beojan! Thanks for opening this issue!\nPrinting support is indeed possible. Since we are using Electron (a boiled-down version of the Chrome browser), we have access to the same printing functionality that is available in your browser.\nIf you're interested in helping build this, let me know and I can guide you through a contribution.\n. I like these user intents. It's unclear to me from the diagram but is the drag cell intent directed at the gutter out of the output area or the input area or both? The current implementation does it along the entire gutter.\nI closed the PR I was working on (#1055) to start off a clean slate with implementing a solution for this. It looks like we'll have to manage multiple focused states for the CodeMirror editor and the CodeCell/MarkdownCell so there is lots of fun state juggling to be done. \ud83d\ude1b \n. Here are more thoughts on this. Specifically, here is how user intents would map to changes in the state. Let's assume we have a simple document with <CodeCell id=\"1\"/>, <CodeCell id=\"2\"/>, and <MarkdownCell id=\"3\"/> . The two state elements that we have are editorFocusedCell for the cell that has CodeMirror focused and cellFocused for the Cell that is focused.\nLet's say the user starts off with {editorFocusedCell: 1, cellFocused: 1}.\n1. User presses down arrow, the state is now {editorFocusedCell: 2, cellFocused: 2}.\n2. User presses up arrow, the state is now {editorFocusedCell: 1, cellFocused: 1}.\n3. User clicks the display area on <CodeCell id=\"2\"/>, the state is now {editorFocusedCell: 1, cellFocused: 2}.\n4. User clicks the cell editor on <CodeCell id=\"2\"/>, the state is now {editorFocusedCell: 2, cellFocused: 2}.\n5. User presses down arrow, the state is now {editorFocusedCell: 3, cellFocused: 3}.\n6. User presses shift+enter, the state is now {editorFocusedCell: 4, cellFocused: 4}.\nThere are probably other combinations of moving between editor components that need to be considered but I think this is a good representation of how the visual representation can be shown in the component state.\n. > I think we want editorFocusedCell to be null in this case. We want focus from the cursor/editor to go away (prevent accidental typing, allow other text input to be used).\nAh yeah! This makes way more sense.\n\nHere's where it's a bit strange (and where you fixed it in #1055). We want to lose focus on any other editors (maybe it doesn't have to be explicit) and allow CodeMirror to do the focusing so the user ends up clicking exactly at the cursor position they want.\n\nYeah. So I have a feeling I might need to pull some nasties with React to get this working right. Because we would need the Editor to change the state on editorFocused and then that change would have to bubble up the DOM tree to the parent CodeCell, Cell, and Notebook components.\n. > We probably want the state structure to be something like:\n\n{\n  focusEditor: true,\n  focusedCell: '1',\n  scrollToFocus: true,\n}\n\nYeah, this makes more sense actually. I hadn't throughly thought out how scroll would fit in with all of this. \n. To elaborate further on this, the code in kernels.js currently only checks to see if the Python IPyKernel is available. Ideally, we want to iterate through all the kernels in ${condaEnvironmentSysPrefix}/share/jupyter/kernels/*/kernel.json and check that they exist as well.. I'll mark this as new-contributor-friendly since it is a pretty straightforward change to folks with experience in Immutable.JS or JavaScript.\nMentorship available from me via our Slack.\n. We'll need to use the dialog option in electron in order to facilitate this popup. There are a couple examples of us using Electron's dialog menu in our code to impact user action. Here is an example.\nMarking this as new-contributor-friendly with mentorship from me available via Slack.\n. Hey, @alexandercbooth! One thing you can do to try and get this working is add the definition of the store context to inside the display component like so.\nstatic contextTypes = {\n    store: React.PropTypes.object,\n  };\n. Looks good!\n. > Every single jupyter message is going to need the session ID.\nIsn't that the case since it's in createMessage?\n. > I'd aim at passing the session ID into create message (it doesn't and shouldn't have access to the store)\nGreat point! Code updated.\n. Oops! Missed some stuff. Don't merge yet.\n. Ah. Good idea. Updated code.\n. Bleh. Updated. I keep forgetting refactor is a verb.\n. Yeah, I actually have to update the tests for this.\n. Yay! Great to see a PR for this in.\nCan you edit the commit messages and PR titles so that they conform to the convention we follow as specified in CONTRIBUTING.md?\n. Got it! Debugging an issue where the dialog won't stay and wait for user input now....\n. > This event happens synchronously (since it's handling SIGINT, quit, etc.). You'll need to unconditionally set e.returnValue to false and then do a proper quit based on the dialog after.\nYeah. That's what I'm currently doing. There is no opportunity to do a proper quit (or to dispatch the save action) because the dialog immediately closes the moment it appears.\nAn interesting update \u2014 this problem (dialog window immediately closing) only happens on the first window that is opened in a particular nteract session. It works alright for any new windows opened afterwards.\n. Similarly, we should also move outputHidden and inputHidden to metadata. I thought there was an issue open for this from a while back but it looks like this is not the case.\nThis would also make it much easier to clean up the notebook JSON when it is saved to an ipynb.\n. Also, do we wanna submit a proposal upstream to nbformat to provide more flexibility in what options can be set in the metadata field? We do run the risk of turning it into an unregulated zone for metadata but it might help to provide options beyond scrolled and collapsed.\n. Nice! This would be a good thing to discuss during this week's dev meeting. Mind bringing it up and reporting back any discussions/decisions made?\n. This is different from the previous implementation because it now stores the sessionId in kernel.channels.\n. OH WOW I REALLY SCREWED UP THIS REBASE. CLOSING. BYE. OH NO. NEVER AGAIN. \ud83d\ude28 . This would tie in nicely with the spellcheck issue as well. As for editing inline, I believe he means the way that styling is added to certain elements when you are editing. For example, the italics and bolding are done here while I edit, although not rendered.\n\nJust kidding, CodeMirror already does this so I'm back to not knowing what this means.\n. Thanks for opening this issue, @cfljam! The split cell feature is hidden now as we are working on improving it's ability to split cells.  It'll take some thinking but I anticipate it'll be done soon especially now that we have more people using the app.. Thanks for letting us know, @blink1073! I'll take a look at the resize/refresh approach.\nClosing this.. @rgbkrk implemented an SVG renderer in #1369. To utilize it you will need to create a notebook with the following code.\nimport IPython\nsvg_string = \"\"\"\n<svg width=\"100\" height=\"100\">\n  <circle cx=\"50\" cy=\"50\" r=\"40\" stroke=\"green\" stroke-width=\"4\" fill=\"yellow\" />\n</svg>\n\"\"\"\nIPython.display.display({'image/svg+xml': svg_string}, raw=True)\nLet me know if that helps!. Hello Francesco! Thanks for opening this issue! \ud83c\udf89 \nThis is certainly possible using the comment add-on in CodeMirror and some JavaScript on our end. If you're interested in implementing this, I'd be glad to help you through it. Otherwise we can leave this open and see if anyone else can tackle it!. Bleh. I dunno what's wrong with my rebases. I did a rebase against master and origin/master but none seem to wipe out the commits.. OK I FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT AND MY GIT SKILLS HAVE LEVELED UP WOW.\nGive me two seconds to clean this up then it should be good for review and merge.. OK THAT ONLY WORKED FOR SOME COMMITS LET ME TRY A DIFFERENT THING FOR THE OTHERS.\nWow.\nThis is a saga.\nSafia and the Very Messy Rebase.. IT IS DONE MERGE IT!. Hi @jkornblum and @dhirschfeld! Thanks for opening this issue.\nCan you confirm whether or not you are using the Windows Basic or Windows classic themes mentioned in the issue that @jkornblum linked to?. Thanks for the effort on this, @peggyrayzis! I'll review the changes you made and see if I can mimic it in the toolbar component working towards #1288. Will probably do that tomorrow or Wednesday.. Go ahead!. > We should switch our status bar to showing the display name of the kernel I think:\nThat makes sense. I believe I used to spec name when I first made the status bar just because it was what we stored in the state tree, so no real reason to have it this way in any case.. > please do not go Gnome way of assuming users to be dumb and limiting the functionalities. The targeted audience is data scientists who already have experience solving difficult problems .\nOur targeted audience goes beyond data scientists, this is highlighted in our website. nteract is a ultimately a design project, and like all design projects the problem at hand is delivering the best product to the most amount of users.\nAlso, please refrain from using pejoratives like \"dumb\" in issue comments.. Thanks for opening this, @ajasja! I think we might have missed this because most of us develop on OS X. I'll try and add this later tonight.. > @captainsafia Thanks! It's a minor detail, that you only notice when it's not there:)\nGreat! By any chance would you like to take a stab and make a contribution to fix this yourself? It's a relatively simple fix (an if statement plus a few lines of code). If you'd like, I can also provide mentorship/guidance on our Slack.\nLet me know if you're interested. If not, all good!. > Works for me, we'll figure out what raw cells mean to us soon enough.\nAs I work on the V3 converter, I think it might be a legacy carryover from older versions of the notebook.. Oh thanks for helping out with the flow errors here. You rock!. YYAAAAASSSSSS!. Thanks a bunch for bringing this through the finish line.. I think I can work on this (although not sure how soon).\nI assume by MiniMap you mean something like Sublime Text's source code map that appears on the right?. I guess you really can find anything on the Internet!. I like this! Per your styles, I assume the header will not be sticky?. Ah OK. I guess in that case we'd have to play around with the height to ensure that it doesn't take up a lot of real estate on the screen.. @jhslinkman: That's interesting. We're terminating the kernel by sending a SIGINT signal which Windows doesn't listen to. It seems like the most fool-proof way to issue SIGINT messages in Windows is to use readline ala what is being done in this module. Let me know if you're interested in taking this one and I can help you submit a PR.. I'm working on fixing this right now.. lol.\nI'll work on this.. I'm gonna extend the scope of this a little bit to affect all menu items (for example, the same thing happens when you select \"File -> Publish -> User Gist\" the dialog menu shows up).\nMenu items should be disabled if no active notebook window is open.. That set of accomplishments gives me feels.\nIt might be good to bring in the things in our initiatves repo to this conversation.. Ditto.. Closing as it has been resolved.. I'm gonna merge this for now and add a testing setup for main process reducers in an upcoming PR.. Oops. Yeah. I noticed this but couldn't consistently reproduce. I wonder if it is related to the keyboard action for focus that can't be picked up.. Hm. Let me look into this.. Figured it out. It's because when the input is hidden the Editor component isn't rendered and the focusAbove and focusDown events are attached to that.. A hacky solution might be to just show a disabled, empty Editor component when the input is hidden.. Very nice! I will merge.. Oops. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOn Oct 28, 2017, at 5:06 PM, Kyle Kelley notifications@github.com wrote:\nOops I meant to delete the old release commits / reword them to match the lerna style like I did for other PRs.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. That's the one! Thanks!. Hello @hugo-pires! Thanks for submitting this issue!\n\nUnder the hood, nteract uses the same PDF generation technique that your browser uses when you save a webpage to a PDF. As a result, it's a little difficult (and out of scope) to implement this at the moment.\nIf you'd like to find a resolution for this and contribute it to the community, I'd be glad to help you as you draft your pull request.. I did some research into this. I particularly like the fact that Workspaces removes duplicated dependencies. The lerna bootstrapping process takes quite some time and even gets my CPU going quite a bit.\n\nFor avid Lerna users this is similar to bootstrapping code via the --hoist flag.\n\nCould we add this flag to our bootstrap process?. Hello @jinxuan! Thanks for opening this issue!\nI was able to reproduce the issue! The problem is on our end and is a result of our OAuth gateway not being configured properly. I'll work on fixing it and get back to you once the issue has been resolved.. Alright! I've fixed this problem. Please let me know if you are still experiencing problems with gist publishing.. . Awesome! Let me take a look.. Merging. I made some issues to follow up on this.. Great stuff! Merging it!. This is very good. Thank you! \ud83d\ude47\u200d\u2640\ufe0f . Nice! Digging the SVG octagons.. Nice! I gave AppVeyor a wangle-jangle to get the funky-gunky out of the way. Once that is green, this is good to go!. > I'm happy to rebase this directly since it's likely conflicts in the main.css.\nI fixed the conflicts unless you're referencing something else.. I'm gonna merge this as including the code for this and also the moving to jest for tests.\nI'll follow up on the testing story in another PR.. Sweet! Let me take a look at this.. > Are you cool with those two todos coming via new PRs?\nYeah! I think they are both discrete and separate enough from the intent of this PR to merit their own PRs.. \ud83c\udf68 . Nope! It's WIP still. I think the thing that was holding us up was wanting to waiting for your new DropDown component so we could use that..... @rgbkrk: Thanks! Let me update this.. This is ready for a final look through and merge.\nDitto your commend on the core/records thing. Making a @nteract/types/core/web/records and a @nteract/types/core/desktop/records and a @nteract/types/core/shared/records seems a little verbose but maybe appropriate?. OK. I got this down to 5 errors with some $FlowFixMes. The remaining errors are related to types on the CellCreator. I avoided touching this for now as #2263 is open. The other error is a result of some of the typings in the RxJS library (I think that can be fixed with a PR that @rgbkrk  sent me a link to.). I think it makes sense to bring #2263 and see if that fixes in anything.... I think creating some definitions for RxJS will create the smallest footprint. . Oh these pesky bugs! \ud83d\udc1b \n. This passes the tests and does what it is supposed to.\nI still need to remove all of the unneeded code from the tips function.\nI'll do that tonight.. This is ready for review!. Thanks for submitting this issue @kubark42!\nAdding auto-saving has been one of our priorities with nteract. As per usual, we want to make sure that when we do add the autosaving feature it is a really good implementation. This requires that we refactor and clean up a lot of other things beforehand so it's taking a while to get this in.. Hi @paulnakroshis,\nThanks for opening this issue!\nUnfortunately, the Jupyter extension architecture doesn't translate well into the nteract desktop application.\nIn order to add the feature that you're looking for, the MathJax instance within nteract will need to be reconfigured to set the equationNumbers.autoNumber attribute.\nIf you'd like to submit a pull request for this, I'd be glad to help you figure out what would need to be done!. I was originally thinking \"Cmd+R\" but that was already bound to Reload so I picked \"Cmd+E\" for execute.\nI guess maybe I should also change the menu label to \"Execute All\"? Although that would differ from the language users are generally familiar with.\n. I think that's a good idea. I figure changing the window title is something we'll have to do quite often.\n. Yeah, I should probably add it as a pre-commit hook or something. \n. Whoops! Yeah, I missed this one. No PRs after midnight for me!\n. Yeah, I'm trying to debug a test failure that for some strange reason only happens in this PR. Prior to me making this change, the test would fail with:\nError: timeout of 5000ms exceeded. Ensure the done() callback is being called in this test.\nI tried a couple of things on my local.\n1. Passing done to the test case and calling it.\n2. Calling setTimeout(done, 5000) inside the test case and removing this.timeout(5000) in the test suite.\n3, Changing the timeout value.\nI'm not entirely sure it is something to do with the tests because it does not happen on others PRs where the test is set up this way (#459).\n\u00af(\u30c4)/\u00af\n. I've already rebased on master, the issue persists before and after a rebase. But I'll look into the trouble you went through with MathJax.\nI tried disabling the timeout all together to see if it picked up any errors but it just hangs forever (a long time) and it seems like the Promise is never resolved.\n. Oops!\n. Yeah, see my comment above.\n. Bleh! Yeah. I'll fix that. Let me know if there is anything else that I need to fix and I'll do it in one commit.\n. Yeah, I figured since we consistently use get everywhere else in our program we should do so here. More a stylistic fix than anything.\n. Yep, just pushed a fix.\nI still haven't added that pre-commit lint hook. \ud83d\ude1d \n. Good point. I'll add it in the other PR that fixes text copy and paste.\n. Ah. Whoops. Forgot about action creators tests.\nComing right up!\n. I think the gray we originally used for this was #ecf0f1.\n. I think you meant to delete this console.error.\n. Much nicer than the tests I had.\n. Good catch!\n. Fair. I suppose we should move the dialog box from the menu generation here then. Lemme do that now.\n. Is it safe to no longer check if setDocumentEdited is available?\n. I think it would be better if this githubAuth function was moved to src/notebook/menu and if the authentication menu element triggered an IPC event on click that was listened to in src/notebook/menu.\n. Maybe move this back up to where it was before so the diff doesn't have unnecessary moves.\n. I don't think your branch is rebased since this was added in #791.\n. Same as with the import. I don't think this has been rebased to include #791.\n. Meh. Fair.\n. For sanities sake, it would be great to see this dependency bumps in a separate PR.\n. Annoying white space diff!\n. Do we want to consolidate this into one of the other Record objects? I feel it would make sense to store this in the DocumentRecord.\n. Ah yeah, I realized this shortly after when I scrolled down to and re-read the reducers code.\n. I think the label on this should continue to be 'Publish' since it's an active verb and lends insight into what the user might be able to access from the submenu. A good arrangement might be Publish > Github > (Authenticate, To Gist).\n. msg isn't blank.\n. Should be pager data, not pager actions.\n. Same as above. Should be pager data.\n. It actually dispatches an action to update the source of a cell if the kernel has requested so by setting replace to true.\n. I would use dispatches instead of inserts here as well.\n. Dispatches an action to update the execution count.\n. It returns an observable with a stream of events that need to happen after a cell has been executed.\n. cellMessages is an Observable not an Object.\n. Same as above. cellMessages is an Observable.\n. The output is also an Observable.\n. This is also an Observable.\n. Both setInputStream and the returned value are streams.\n. Ish? All of the Observables in execute functions are subsets of the data that is returned by the shell or iopub subjects which are defined in enchannel-zmq-backend. If you read the code you'll notice that in lines 87 through 101.\n. IMO, a stream is a general term for a set of events that happen through time. In can be used in computational contexts that don't relate to reactive programming at all. An Observable is a wrapper around a stream that gives you additional functionality like merging and filtering. In our specific case, we are returning streams in the form of Observables in all our code so you need to write.\n@param {Rx.Observable} setInputStream\n@rgbkrk might have better ideas since he works with RxJS all day.\n. I think it would help to show that this connects to Redux dispatching eventually, hence the word use.\n. Since the code is version-controlled, we can actually just go ahead and delete lines 20 through 22.\n. Yes! I actually just realized you can delete the entire div. So you can remove lines 13 to 23.\n. You should also add the typing for tabSize in propTypes.\n. Maybe specify that it is a built-in JavaScript kernel?\n. Disregard that, maybe just say fallback to default Python since built-in implies some sort of packaging.\n. \ud83d\ude2e \u2757\ufe0f \n. Can you specify what you mean by interprocess boundary? I assume you mean between the main and renderer processes?\n. Can you add the test and static folders to this as well?\nAlternatively, I think you can move this file to src/ to have it run flow on only that subdirectory.\n. Can you move the props object into the component like this? The linter gets mad at this right now.\nprops: {\n...\n}\n. Do you think you can set up Flow with Babel as well? If not, no worries.\n. Yeah, I definitely hear you on that. I think once we've added Flow to all our components we'll make the appropriate updates to our linting setup. Good foresight!\n. Yes! \ud83d\udc4d \n. Can you change this so that the changes to the notebook document are made in the test as opposed to inside the utilities?\n. As mentioned below, the store should be configured to hide one of the inputs here. You'll notice that the dummyStore function takes a config object. You can add a hideAll config option to this and use it to conditionally set the notebook in the DocumentRecord.\n. Yep! Your hunch was totally right.\nAlso, it looks like you've got to make a sacrifice to appease our linter... \ud83d\ude1d \n. Welp! You're totally right, @blindingstars. I'll update in another PR that includes the updates to the README.\n. Oh good point. I was trying to get the verbs we were using in notebook loading and config loading to line up.\n. Yeah, I figured this needed to be refactored out. The only main difference is the .next call really.\n. Oh! I see. This is what I was intending to do but this is a consequence of me just following what was on the notebook observable without thinking critically about what each thing was doing. embarassed\n. You cannot use the notification system in the main process since it's a React component. I think using a dialog should do the trick though.\n. I think it would make more sense to do this instantiation inside the launch.js file within the launch function so you're only instantiating a context menu if you know a notebook is being successfully loaded.\n. Might also wanna include the sendMetrics in this config.\n. Yep! False by default. In the immediate future we can do the dialog box that asks the user what they want like before. And in the far future, we would have it as part of the config UI I outlined in another issue somewhere....\n. I think this would actually be much easier. As I work on adding the session to the execution workflow I'm realizing it would be so much easier to have it couple with one of the existing parameters passed in.\nAnd given what channels represents, it makes sense for the sessionId to go there.\n. It should actually be Supported language elements sine it describes a data type not an action.\n. Can you try moving this to the mapStateToProps in the Notebook component and then sending it down the component tree to the Display component?\n. OMG THIS IS WHY IT WASN'T WORKING! OMG I AM THE WORST PROGRAMMER. OMG WHY?!!? OMG THANK YOU!!!. Can you elaborate on this a little bit more?. Yeah, this is that tricky one where we couldn't figure out exactly how it was behaving because it seemed like that line would never be hit based on the conditional and the way that newIndex and oldIndex were set.. These values are currently persisted to the notebook on save. The reason we didn't do this was because there was some discussion about persisting arbitrary (not defined in the notebook format) values. So as of now, this configuration is only used during runtime and forgotten once the user closes out of nteract.. Ah! I think I get it! Thanks for the explanation!. This is me fidgeting with things to get Flow to be happy. Despite the if-statement being there, it doesn't like the fact that some keys in DisplayData and ExecuteResult are not present in VALID_MIMETYPES.. Mmmm. Yeah. This was me trying to work through the issue of whether or not it was possible for multiple worksheets to exist. I know there was no interface for it but is there any remote possibility that worksheets might actually be an array of length greater than 1?. It was both ExecuteResult and DisplayData.. You're absolutely right. Flow was angry about the mixed exports styles and I ended up tagging the export inline with the function because it was easier to consolidate.. We can probably set this aside as a Hacktoberfest ticket but it would be good to have this specified in the constants file.. That makes sense. It could be a wrapper around the SET_IN_CELL action that sets value to !value.. Sounds good! I'll add this change in the PR with the test cases.. Why does this ternary logic exist?. lol.. That makes sense.. If there is no token set, this will just be ignored. In the Jupyter server, there is a little handler that checks to see if the token is enabled in the config. If it is, it checks to see if this Authorization header is passed or if a cookie was given in the request.. LOL.. I'm curious: why not import each of these directly from @nteract/core/components instead of having _nextgen be an intermediary?\nAs in, could this be:\nimport { Cell, Input } from '@nteract/core/components';. Should this styled-jsx dependency exist at the top-level? We only use it in the core submodule right?. Me thinks yes. Keep the style as close as possible to the components that affect them.. Why is there a .js here?. I wonder if there are any other \"liveness\" checks that we need to add here to make sure that the multiplexed channels subject that is configured for all channels.. Any reason you aren't using the redefined Channels type that you made above?. I'm curious to know: was there a reason fs was aliased to filesystem prior to this?. Yay for async-await!. Oh! Nice little refactor here!. 300 points to Gryffindor for this pun.. Yeah. I think that is a good way to go. Furthermore, the other enchannel backend we have implemented enchannel-socketio-backend isn't getting a lot of love so it might be good to detach from that naming scheme.. I'm in favor of leaving the TestSocket contained in the enchannel-zmq-backend or whatever it ends up being renamed to.. I moved them here in anticipation of the upgrade to the 4.X.X stream. With the RecordOf<T> I think we'll be exporting a Record factory out of our @nteract/types package.. Good point! Let me revert this really quick.. I dunno how I feel about changing the name of the types to not match up with the name of the package they are used...\nThen again, calling it notebook does make it more friendly for external devs.. makeAppRecord is an initial step into the conversion of the new Records-with-types support in Immutable 4.0. makeAppRecord is a Record factory that creates an AppRecord. It is defined in pakcage/types/src/core/records.. In the future, we will have factories like makeDocumentRecord, makeImmutableNotebook for all the typed Records in the app.. Flow gets mad at this line because there is no kernel attribute defined in the app state. I think what we can do here is. I think you might need to add a kernel: KernelRecord attribute to the AppState definition in the lines above.. Adding on to this, does it makes sense to break down the notebook state to different pieces. Like so:\nnotebook: {\n   host: { the host details described above }\n   metadata: { top-level metadata here (for example, the language) }\n   document: the actual cells\n}. I think kernelRefs is a fine wording. activeKernelRefs implies that there are inactive kernels. What would an inactive kernel be? On that is running but you are not connected to, one that isn't running, etc.. I think yes. Since this is referencing the kernel id that the kernel and front-end agree upon for communication?. OK. I moved the preserveScrollOption setting into default options.\nI'm not sure what to do about the onScroll default prop.\nFor me, personally, the super thing looks a little bit hard to understand. It took me a while to figure out what was going on so maybe best to keep them as is for readability?. Welp! This is my bad. I totally just pushed to the branch without running all the Travis tests locally. Lemme fix.. Yes!\nAlso there are a few problems with this now that we have the ownProps parameter on. Specifically, it freaks out because the props passed to the component from a a code cell are different from the ones passed to the component on a markdown cell and reconciling those differences gets annoying fast.\nWorking on separating the Prop type into a MarkdownProp and a CodeProp with the distinct requirements.. Hm. Yeah. That makes most sense. TBH, I hadn't considered it because all the tutorials I read used the class name as the identifier. \ud83d\ude06 . Is there a particular reason this import style is used instead of import React from 'react'.. Super elegant!. Thank you for adding these tests!. Flow isn't a huge fan of this because the payload property is typed as any in type Action above. You probably want to check that the payload is an object first (action.payload instanceof Object && ...) to work around this.. This line is extraneous.. We can nuke the run bit in this line and the one above.. We might wanna just do yarn here to take advantage of Yarn's terseness. Ditto in the line above.. Can we use header as the parent tag so this component uses semantic HTML?. Is there a reason we are using p tags and not divs?. Does this account for the fact that the nbformat spec for author is a list of objects?. Yep. Looks like it was done for flexibility.\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/nbformat/pull/46/files#r80823257. Style nit: I think it\u2019s OK to have this handler defined without the \u201con\u201d prefix and just use \u201con\u201d for the event action below.. Based on the 0MQ docs on identities, I think it is OK to type this as Array<string>. . Is there a way to split out the properties into a type definition and use it to explicitly type this parameter?. Roger that! Done.. Is this addition intentional?. Can you give some context into why this wasn't easy to type in case someone decides to help with it in the future?. Any context into what made this hard to type?. Context into what errors you got while trying to type this?. I notice that of is imported in different ways throughout this PR. Is there a reason for this or can we standardize around a certain way?. I noticed the previous comment said this should be revisited after rxjs@6. Was this the change that needed to be made?. Does anser provide a type library that we can use instead of declaring our own types?. I believe the ReactNode type already includes string as a subtype.. I believe this type can be moved over to devDependencies.. Hm. Any reason we have the | null here if the previous type was a possibly-undefined HTMLElement?. Ooooh. Thanks for catching this. I think we should still keep the logic in the codebase. I suspect it was filed as a bug because people didn't recognize something was off right away.. Is there a reason we as casting it as any[] then as JupyterMessage[] message here and elsewhere?. I believe it's better practice (and cleaner) to use the Array<*> syntax for complex array types.. Mmmm. I guess my bias is showing. In other TypeScript codebases I've worked with, we use the array-type: array-simple constraint on tslint. I tend to prefer it because it makes things like this a little bit easier to read when you're skimming through code.\nI'm fine leaving it as is and setting our tslint configuration at a later time once everything has been migrated.. suggestion\nimport { JupyterMessage } from '@nteract/messaging';. suggestion\n  const wsSubject = webSocket<JupyterMessage>(. suggestion\n      (message?: JupyterMessage) => {. Thanks! I've updated the PR.. Nope. Didn't need this at all. It's an artifact from my export tinkering. Removing it.. Yep. TypeScript doesn't like it when you have a possibly-undefined variable before a definitely defined one.. That definitely is a way to do it. The original error was about error being potentially undefined.  TypeScript recommends that optional parameters follow required parameters so I think it's good to follow this pattern.\nIs this the only place in the code where we were using Node-style callbacks or is there more?. I added this any here to get around some type errors that were being thrown up in the ReactMarkdown component. As it turns out, the keys in the renderers object can only be one of the 16 or so node types defined in ReactMarkdown.NodeType. math and inlineMath are not in that set so it throws an error. I trued to expand the declaration of the react-markdown module but had trouble getting it working. I decided to just force it into an any type and call it a day here. Open to any advice on how we can work around this.. I didn't know how to type eat here.. I added the type on this here to get around an implicit any that it was throwing inside the function.. Once again, not sure what type node should be here.. I added type definitions for the trim-trailing-lines library since there were none.. I think this happens because we have the components property set in the styleguide config for Presentational Components. The docs for examples are set up as a single file markdown.. I believe the fix for this that you can do as a fast follow is to create an NbFormatEnum and use that as the type of the nbformat field and in this comparison here.\n```js\nenum NbFormatEnum {\n    \"v4\" = 4\n}\nif (notebook.format === NbFormatEnum.v4) {}\n```\nAlso, I'm not sure if the second clause after the && might be throwing it off.. Agreed! I mentioned this to @jdetle and I think he's working on it at the moment.. Done. I used Notebook | ImmutableNotebook.. Is this type supposed to be equivalent to the type defined in React.ReactArray?. There were some complaints here about the recursive definition in the ReactArray type.. I had trouble getting the circular reference to VDOMNode working here. TypeScript outlines a technique for using circular references in Array-like types which I used above but not for union types. I don't know much about the goal of this type to be able to define it without using circular types.. I refactored the way we create TileLayer options to match up with the type definitions for the tileLayer function in Leaflet.. The ! here is a TypeScript way of saying that I know this type might be undefined but trust me, in this case, it is not.. The ! here are a way to allow adding types for static properties outside the context of a constructor.\nI also pulled in some types from the Leaflet type definitions.. According to the type definitions provided by Leaflet, there is no geoJson function defined in the library, just geoJSON. I think this is a result of us being on an older version of Leaflet. I can try installing the older type definitions. Any context into why our implementation and the type definitions might be off here?. I upgrade leaflet and tested against the geojson example notebook.. suggestion\n      components: \"packages/host-cache/src/components/*.tsx\",. React.ReactNode captures the string part of this (and related DOM elements). I got around the circular definition error by just copy pasting the React.ReactNode | VDOMEl as the value in the array shrug.. I had to add some typecasting here to specify which specific type within the union type we were in based on the if-statement.. Good call on using PureComponent on these components.. Any particular reason you've changed the default data prop to an empty string here and elsewhere? I'm hesitant to introduce a non-nil default value here.. That makes sense.\nYou can go ahead and merge this. Once our TypeScript migration is complete, we can run through and figure out whether or not we have sensible defaults set on our props.\nThanks! :shipit:. Oooooh! Perfect. Thanks.. I was originally going for interfaces, not types because interfaces are extendable. As it turns out, in recent versions of TypeScript, types are also extendable. I just kept them as types here to minimize the diff.. Done.. Yeah. I didn't know what to do here. I figured we should just version the types separately in the split-out packages.. The code that we have here doesn't match the definition of defineMode in the CodeMirror library. We're passing 3 arguments when this function only expects two.\nAlso, there is no defineMIME function in the CodeMirror library.. Why is the binding different from the function name here? It is causing some errors in the component.. This is giving me a TypeError that I am not sure how to solve.\nArgument of type 'OperatorFunction<CodeCompletionEvent, {}>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'OperatorFunction<{}, {}>'.\n  Type '{}' is not assignable to type 'CodeCompletionEvent'.\n    Property 'editor' is missing in type '{}'.. Yep. I posted a note in https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/3690 that that PR should be rebased once this is merged.. Is there a reason the event is typed as Attributes and not React.SyntheticEvent?. I added it to include a type definition. I can remove it. It's a little overkill to include for one type.. I've been converting the tests to TypeScript as well so we might as well do that here too.. Some of these things are defined in @nteract/types. Do we want to import them from there to showcase that they are not unique to commutable?. You can choose to address this in this PR or in a follow-up but I think it would be very helpful if we split these actions up into different files based on what they are for.. What does this exclude help with?. Got it. In the future, we'll hopefully be able to link the @nteract/play tutorial to show people how to use the package in more full-fledged situations.. Yeah. That's why I was meh about using that phrase.\nAh well. Maybe we can document it into existence?. Correct. There are defineMime functions exported from the CodeMirror codebase but they are not in the type definitions.. Yes, we do! Bringing them in now.. Done.. Hm. I guess we can change this type definition to Partial<AppState> then. This way, it will accommodate objects that are missing some of the AppState fields and those that have extra fields.. I recently enabled format on save in my VSCode so I think it caught something that hadn't been formatted before.. I think it makes more sense to keep it here. The problem stemmed from the fact that our actions definitions had the Uint8Array type defined for all buffers. However, our custom type declarations for JMP used any[] as the type for buffers. Since messaging was converted before the actions and epics, it was set up to match up with the loosely-typed declarations we had. This makes sure that messages and JMP type declarations are using the stricter definitions everywhere.. I renamed this one because there was a collision in variables here.. Hang on! I think this might have been an artifiact from me trying different things to fix the error that ended up being a result of having a stale lib directory.. Bleh! Good catch. VSCode's autocompleter pulled it from here. I wonder why.... You'll probably want to replace this with JSONObject. In TypeScript, Object represents all JavaScript objects, not objects like {}.. Ditto here as well.. Would it be possible to create a variable to store the levels property in and not use a nested ternary here?. I think we probably wanna move this to our top-level debDependencies?. Is this code comment doing something special with regard to styled-component?. This style seems a little confusing to me. Can the content be rendered in the component instead of being set with CSS? . Style nit: maybe call this \u201cboxShadowLevels\u201d?. What is this new index prop being used for?. Yep. There was a minor fix to their type definitions that was pushed two weeks ago so it is one minor version ahead of the package.. What do the two exclamation points mean here? You can have null value in the array?. Me thinks we should track outbound messages.. It looks like CI is failing on this because the messages global isn't defined.. Have these been added to package.json?. I think the conversion for a question mark before a value in Flow is id?: string | null.. Yep. I've been using the || fallback in conversions.. I've used import { System as NotificationSystem } from \"react-notification-system\" elsewhere.. Is there a reason you used typecasting here as opposed to setting the type on the function parameter?. Yes, in the past I've used import { System as NotificationSystem } from \"react-notification-system\".. What was the problem going on here?. It doesn't include TypeScript as a dependency. The code is basically some Webpack configs to get all their hot-reload stuff working. In the future, we might be able to integrate their logic with our webpack-configurator or just fallback to theirs.. I actually included this from back when we were using the module remapper. Let me update it to use our composite set up and see if it still works.. This is a bit of a code smell. The tests kept failing because close was not defined on the socket but it seemed like Jest wasn't fully mocking out the JMP Socket object.. Other places in the code (here and here)seem to assume that content is a string when it is really the object defined above. Is there a reason for this?. The ambient type declaration for JMP was incorrect here.. Oooooh. Good idea!. Oh darn it! This is totally my bad. Hang on let me clean this bit up.. Yes.. Is it better to use the toString method here as in L319 below?. Is there a way to change the second generic to an enum or something to avoid a boolean trap?\nEdit: I see how this works with the description of conditional typing you wrote below. It still feels weird to read without knowing what the \"true\" is doing but I guess people can figure that out on Code through the type overlays. I still feel meh about it.. Yep. That's tslint. We have a rule that requires you to use Array<> for complex type definitions and [] for simple type definitions.. :+1: to this because it makes our TypeDoc setup easier.. I believe this needs to be report:desktop.. What's the point of wrapping this button as a styled component with no style?. This looks weird and is mostly a workaround to get the redux-observable to correctly narrow down the types in downstream clauses when filtering with ofType. This issue has more info.. From what I could tell, this action is only used as an intermediary message in the shutdown epic. The action that reducers process is the KillKernelSuccessful action which is sent when the kernel has sent a successful shutdown reply and the process has been killed.. Yeah. This was the type that was inferred by TypeScript but for some reason I had to explicitly define it to get the places where it was used to correctly recognize what OwnProps was supposed to be.. Yeah. I think all these actions/selector types need a good look through in a separate PR. I did this mostly to unblock data explorer.. Style nit: this would be much easier to understand if the contents of these string literals were assigned to variables and referenced here.. Do we need to invoke done here?. Nit: But I think this interface type should be defined under its own variable.. Yeah. What I did was search for the string makeMapDispatchToProps on the GitHub search and see how people were using it in their Redux projects and mimicking that. I tested this by editing text files in the Jupyter extension and clicking around to confirm the menu items still worked.. Here and elsewhere, I had to require that transform components take a Partial as a prop since the picker passes the props to the components using React.cloneElement and the props aren't set on these components when they are children of Output.. I had to set the props on the styled component because styled-components clobbers the defaultProps initialization for some reason.. Ooooh! Good catch. Thanks!. Oh! My bad. I totally missed this documentation (which is funny because didn't I write it?). I thought we needed to keep this richestMime logic back. This actually simplifies a whole lot.. Great call!. OK! That makes me feel a little bit better about missing this. Code is actually much cleaner without it. Feels good to not rely on all the displayOrder stuff.. Yep. You're right. Since they are no longer passed to the NotebookApp component, this can be standardTransforms. I had changed it to deal with a type error that no longer exists.. Yep. Passing just record works now. I can't recall what error I was addressing when I added this. I think it might have had something to do with a type error.. This is the cellId. It's used to pull out the cell so that the outputs can be pulled from that. I realize that we modeled this to take an output, not a cell, so I will update.. Makes sense. I'll move the file.. Yeah. We can be explicit here.. Oh gosh! I'm such a goof. I spent way too long trying to figure this out and didn't see that.. Good catch!. What is this doing? And will it work on non-Windows machines?. I think we can actually type this as a JSONObject.. Oh. Good call.. Makes sense.. Hm. Yeah. I'll have to look into this as well as updating the component docs.. Ah yes. Fixed.. Yeah. We only need byId so I'll remove handlers.. Got it. Thanks.. Oh welp. Yeah. This needs to be set. I think in this case it is OK to just have the JSON transform as a child since the bundle is a JSON bundle.. I was going for full integration tests. I'm still investigating the best options for unit testing our graphql setup. I think it makes sense to add mocks in there.. Oh yeah. I posted the comment above but I can elaborate on this.\n\nThe problem was the main that was being invoked in the Apollo server code. I added logic to only call it if the file is run, not imported.\n\nBasically, we don't want to run main if the file is being imported, as is the case when we use it in tests.. Yeah. I think I know how to refactor our file setup based on all the input you provided.. I think you can remove this disable and add a return type to mapStateToProps that defines the schema for object returned.. Ditto here. I think you can make the return type (dispath: Dispatch, ownProps: { appBase: string; contentRef: ContentRef }): object for this function.. For posterity's sake, why was this added to the config?. I think it would make more sense for this function to create a new resources object instead of modifying the one that is passed to it.. I notice that there's a few of these non-null assertions whenever the header data is referenced. Is it something to do with the way the type is defined? Could we possibly restructure the code to avoid having the ! whenever we access properties inside headerData?. Hm. We shouldn't need to add this here. Was there a problem with the compilation?. Hm. Is there no client-side state associated with publishing a notebook to bookstore (like a last published time) that would need to be stored here?. I see this type definition is also defined in the types package. Could we import it from there instead of redefining it here?. Hm. Shouldn't this return type be something like Map<string, HostRecord>?. Can we make this List<string>?. Ditto the comments about making the types more specific here.. Can we make this List<string>?. Might want to delete this code all together instead of commenting it out.. Can the Map be typed as Map<string, React.ComponentClass>?. ",
    "jdfreder": ":astonished: \n. I like the spinning bracket idea- that's cool!\n. Nice!  Why the grey background?\n. Nammmmmeeees?\n- pybox\n- pykernel\n- nteract-ipython\n. Begin discussion\n. :+1: \n. Thanks!\n. :heavy_check_mark: \n. One option is to have a set of asset folders.  We could have a common folder, then folders per language.  The loader would pick the correct asset folder and fallback to the common one for things that are missing.  ... this idea may complicate things with WebPack- we would have to have a static map of language name to require (folder name)\n. Lol - Pull requests that have a failing status can\u2019t be merged from a phone.\n. Looking into it....\n. Problem is the way the stream invokes the console calls.  A simple bind fixes this:  \njs\nconsole.log('prelaunch');\nlaunchKernel('python3')\n  .then(kc => {\n    console.log(kc);\n    const channels = kc.channels;\n    const shell = channels.shell;\n    const iopub = channels.iopub;\n    const msg = createExecuteRequest('print(3)');\n    console.log(msg);\n    shell.subscribe(console.log.bind(console), console.error.bind(console));\n    iopub.subscribe(console.log.bind(console), console.error.bind(console));\n    shell.next(msg);\n  }).catch(console.error.bind(console));\n. Thanks, I was seeing \"err\" in my console which made me go \"sigh...\".  I think you're right though, make errors display as user land popups will save a lot of frustration in the future.  The same kind of frustration we have in the live notebook.\n. Sweet, I'm trying this locally now..\n. Right now the 'Open' menu item is bound to the readJSON method which requires a single parameter, the JSON file path.  Really what we need here is an action that displays an open dialog and then invokes readJSON for the user selected path.\nIt's important to note that with the menu, only actions that accept 0 parameters can be invoked!\n. Yeah, but I bound to readJSON just to show that the dispatcher is working.\n. Thanks!\n. > I'd like to follow this one up with removing the need for an index (some sort of ref to a cell). Not sure how to do that, but I think it will lead to less asynchronous errors (what if a cell is in flight and does an update?)\nSo during save/load we'd strip/add these ref guids?\n. +1 for nteract/nteract\n. woot!\n. Looks slick!\n. These are great!  Thanks!\n. :tada: \n. ah, yes\n. Sweet!  Thanks Kyle!\n. Yay!  This is awesome, now we just need to enchannel -> dispatch this on display data\n. :tada: \n. +1 to not use CapitalCase, I always stick to hyphen-separated-filenames for JS projects.\n.js vs .jsx - would there be any reason to not run the react jsx transpiler against a module? i.e. any subtleties in js that don't work in jsx? \n. Then +1 to also use .js everywhere, @rgbkrk ?\n. misses README.md\n. rebase needed \n. ah beat me to it!\n. Thanks!\n. This is ready now\n. I opened an issue about it #119 , caused by me forgetting we were using immutable - I used [] instead of get(), see 5a22a27\n. I like @kenwheeler 's suggestion for an API module, or something, to store non-action things, but I'd like to know how that would work with something like the declarative menu.  Right now menuitems can define actions by name, and those actions get dispatched on click.  With an API, the menu code would either have to know to look in both the API and actions/index (and we'd have to figure out which had precedence) or you would have to define callbacks instead of actions (loosing some of the declarative goodness).  Do either of you see a way to deal with this in a clean way?\n. Let's continue the discussion here, I'm just merging because of C4.1.\n. #434 makes the kernel busy state available\n. Woot!  Thanks @rgbkrk !\n. Thanks!\n. thanks!\n. Actually there's a css property I think\n. Closed by #201\n. Totally agree.  Sorry I didn't respond to this issue earlier, didn't show on my radar for some reason...  Any thoughts about what npm run start . should do?  Nothing?  Open all notebooks in the immediate directory?  I guess npm run start *.ipynb should open all notebooks in the directory because the os will expand the glob\n. It's a start!\n. Thanks Kyle!\n. I believe this is closed now\n. Woah this is big, good work! \n. :cake:\n. Makes sense to me\n. I don't see why turning Travis on could hurt.  I don't think we should let it slows us down though, at this point in time.\n. Yeah, I think you're right about adding a menu shortcut.  That's a neat idea and really frees the user up from having to know the details.\n. I like the layout aesthetically, but I think the information could be rearranged.  For example, instead of saying \"Enchannel\" and having a list of implementations, maybe say \"Connecting to a Backend\".\nAlso, any mocks for one of the doc pages (not the homepage)?\n. Don't sweat @captainsafia !  I need to get around to doing a few other nteract things first, and then I can take a crack at this.  If I get to this, I'll ping you first to make sure I'm not stepping on your toes.\n. @captainsafia I really like the writing style you've used for this.\n. Hopefully we can get a fix for this\n. see https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/191\n. Awesome!\n. Thanks! :cake: \n. It's a start.  We still need to get electron-mocha using electron-compile instead of babel.  Once we do that I'll be able to check the contents of the spawned window for .cell !!  This should catch lots of bugs before they appear.\n. Whoops\n. \n. No, I don't think so.  In jupyter/notebook we do\n. Looks like that works too @betatim , thanks!  Want to open a PR?\n. Thanks @betatim !\n. :tada: \n. Licecap doesn't want to record my cursor today, but here's a cap anyways:\n\n. Thanks @betatim !\n. :cake: \n. I love seeing the codebase shrink!

I still need to get the full circle tests working for the different CLI arg patterns\n. aka electron-compile working on electron-mocha\n. Awesome!\n. :tada:\n. :sob: \n. Without this can we still go from unrendered markdown to rendered via the mouse?\n. Strange, what happens when you dump the whole thing, spans and all, into a pre tag\n. Awesome!  :cake:\n. Thanks @betatim :cake: \n. Thanks! :tada: \n. :+1: \n. Thanks @Carreau ! :fish_cake: \n. Hi @geekraver , right now an empty notebook is created.  You should see a single cell, like this:\n\nIf you don't see that cell, can you click  View->Toggle Developer Tools and then look at the web console.  Are there any errors there?  There are various failure modes that may cause the behavior you see.  We don't yet have a nice user facing error reporting mechanism.\n. woot!\n. Awesome\n. Will do mildu\n. :cake: :fireworks: \n. Sweet, thanks for sharing the cheat sheet too!\n. :fish_cake: \n. Thanks @Carreau !\n. Dude, awesome! \n. Much better!\n. :+1;\n. :fish_cake: \n. I think the play button should run in place as is.  I've always disliked mouse click induce scrolling\n. Simple enough\n. Fish cake! :fish: :fish_cake: \n. Thanks :sushi: !\n. I agree with what @rgbkrk is hinting, it sounds like an API change in the node path packages which suggests nteract is running in an older node than you expect.\n. The warning is probably okay, people may mistake it as an error though\n. Sweettttt!  :cake:\n. Hey @kerwin , very cool!  It's good to see that you were able to do this.  @rgbkrk and I were talking about doing the same thing at some point.  We want to be able to re-use the nteract interface in web/deployed contexts.  Ideally it would be a matter of swapping out the electron native components with web friendly analogs.\n. Wow 250 megs in the git folder, ouch\n. @Carreau I had this problem yesterday, the temporary workaround is to rm -rf the fonts folder ./src/notebook/fonts/material-design-icons and then git stash to force re-checkout.  I think the solution is to move the static assets into a separate npm package.\n. You meant add nteract rendering support to IPythonQL?  Shouldn't this be an issue in IPythonQL's repo?\n. :+1:\n. An alternative PR which does IFrames per output area\n. I'll attempt to share globals across the IFrames....  Not sure if I will have success though.\n. I think we should move the static assets, fonts and icon fonts, into a separate npm package.  That way it will be a one and done affair.\n. > This now authenticates with GitHub if GITHUB_TOKEN is set as an environment variable, which lets you update the same gist each time you publish.\nI think eventually it will make sense to expose this in the UI somewhere\n. > I'm now mildly irritated with nbviewer's caching.

I was able to reproduce the first error in the console once.  I haven't been able to reproduce it since.  Seems like a problem with kill kernel / launching a new kernel.\n. Killing a kernel, then starting a new one also doesn't update the title correctly.  I can reproduce that constantly.  For example\nrun \npython\nwhile True:\n    pass\nLanguage->Kill Running Kernel\nLanguage->Python 3\nThe title bar will still say busy even when executing other cells.\n. I've also noticed the title bar getting stuck on not connected, despite a connected kernel.\n. Thanks!\n. Lets depend on src for the unit tests, and build for renderer dependent tests\n. \ud83c\udf65 \ud83d\udc1f !!! :D\n. Closing and reopening to trick travis into rerunning...\n. I guess I could have just clicked the little restart wheel, but I was hoping coveralls was ready now @rgbkrk \n. note, I ended up removing the travis_before_install script, and hugging closely to the node-zmq travis file\n. gasp Travis is failing!!   ;)\n. This is awesome, thanks!\n. nice!\n. Yeah, there's also a failure when trying to run coveralls that I see on Travis\n. :tada: \n. Decrease of coverage ??????????? How's that possible!?\n. I'm surprised the create cell above function, the one that sits behind the store, isn't newly covered because of this...\n. oh aha, it's because of my spoofed dispatch\n. > Checks cannot finish quickly enough!\nYeah we need to cache the ZMQ stuff\n. :trollface: \n. > If anyone else merges this I will be a very angry cat.\nActually I didn't see this, sorry!\n. :zap: disco mode\n.

Which we may not want to do?\n. Actually caching node_modules should be fine as long as we don't cache package.json...\n.  4 min 46 sec -> 1 min 46 sec\nThat's 37% of the uncached time!\n. Test failing because of cache issues, merging\n. Looks like the testing cache is working again!\n. Ironically this PR net adds one line of code, but it's because of the dictionary expansion\n.

Test fails locally too\n. Test pass locally on master though...  So yeah, must be the tildify package..\n. :+1:\n. Okay, this post may not be comprehensive, but it's all I've thought about now.\nI think you'll want to tackle this in steps,\nFirst\nYou'll want to make sure that the document state is decoupled from the rest of the application state.  For example, in the following app state:\njs\n{\n  cellPagers: Map,\n  cellStatuses: Map,\n  channels: Object,\n  connectionFile: \"/run/user/1000/jupyter/kernel-aaf19a34-c0da-4968-bc2f-d2f8c8ba904b.json\",\n  executionState: \"idle\",\n  filename: \"/home/jon/github.com/nteract/nteract/intro.ipynb\",\n  focusedCell: \"260f6a26-9623-46b7-a83f-ce5f1830d21a\",\n  github: module.exports,\n  notificationSystem: Constructor,\n  spawn: ChildProcess,\n  notebook: {\n    cellMap: {\n      \"260f6a26-9623-46b7-a83f-ce5f1830d21a\": {\n        cell_type: \"markdown\",\n        metadata: {},\n        source: \"a\"\n      },\n      \"2bc3af2b-43e7-4284-94a4-1bf135b15110\": {\n        cell_type: \"code\",\n        execution_count: 2,\n        metadata: {\n          collapsed: false\n        },\n        outputs: [ ],\n        source: \"b\"\n      },\n    },\n    cellOrder: [\n      \"260f6a26-9623-46b7-a83f-ce5f1830d21a\",\n      \"2bc3af2b-43e7-4284-94a4-1bf135b15110\",\n    ],\n    metadata: {\n      kernelspec: {\n        display_name: \"Python 3\",\n        language: \"python\",\n        name: \"python3\"\n      },\n      language_info: {\n        mimetype: \"text/x-python\",\n        nbconvert_exporter: \"python\",\n        name: \"python\",\n        pygments_lexer: \"ipython2\",\n        version: \"2.7.10\",\n        file_extension: \".py\",\n        codemirror_mode: {\n          version: 2,\n          name: \"ipython\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    nbformat: 4,\n    nbformat_minor: 0\n  },\ncellPagers, cellStatuses, focusedCell, notebook probably should be\nrecorded in the undo/redo stack.  It may make sense to sort the state (this is\nsomething we'll have to do when we get to implementing RTC anyways):\njs\n{\n  appState: { ... },\n  userState: {\n    cellPagers\n    cellStatuses\n    focusedCell\n  },\n  documentState: {\n    notebook\n  }\n}\nSecond\nYou'll want two stacks in the application state, undo and redo.  \njs\n{\n  appState: {\n    undo: [],\n    redo: [],\n    ...\n  },\n  userState: {\n    cellPagers\n    cellStatuses\n    focusedCell\n  },\n  documentState: {\n    notebook\n  }\n}\nand two corresponding reductions, SET_FORWARD_CHECKPOINT and \nSET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT.  SET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT takes the current userState\nand documentState and stores it in the appState under an undo stack.  For \nexample, this would result in:\njs\n{\n  appState: {\n    undo: [\n      {\n        userState,\n        documentState,\n      },\n    ],\n    redo: [],\n    ...\n  },\n  userState: {\n    cellPagers\n    cellStatuses\n    focusedCell\n  },\n  documentState: {\n    notebook\n  }\n}\nYou'll want to have sane limits on the number of recorded undo and redo actions.\nSET_FORWARD_CHECKPOINT does the same thing but into the redo stack.\nLastly, the corresponding action for the SET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT reducer should\nhave a flag that optionally clears the redo stack (via a CLEAR_REDO reducer).\nThird\nCreate UNDO and REDO actions & reductions.\nUNDO action will do the following:\n- abort if undo stack length = 0\n- SET_FORWARD_CHECKPOINT\n- UNDO reduction: pop state from undo stack over userState and documentState\nREDO action will do the following:\n- abort if redo stack length = 0\n- SET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT (clear redo = false)\n- REDO reduction: pop state from redo stack over userState and documentState\nForth\nCall SET_BACKWARD_CHECKPOINT (clear redo = true) at the beginning of relevant, \ntop-level user actions.\nFifth\nImplement menu items that point to the UNDO REDO reduction actions.\n. Hey @jaredly , thanks for looking into this.  Actually, I think I may have \"fixed\" (maybe just covered up) the actual problem when I sped up nteract using the PureRenderMixin (in master).\n. :cake:s\n. Lot's of small version bump PRs tonight!\n. Yeah, agreed, it really is something that belongs at that level because it affects disk representation. https://github.com/nteract/commutable/issues/30\n. This is much harder to fix than it seems.  Simply not focusing the CM el on cell focus would break keyboard navigation.  We will need more state, specifically an \"input is focused\" boolean.\n. I have a mock for this, I'll try to upload it later today\n. > It might be useful to listen too these signals to select previous/next\n\ncell.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d \n. We can do that too, and remove the mark calls from everything but the agendas.  In the agendas we will keep the marks and measure call.\n. Untested :  behavior with rendered MD\nKnow awkwardness: CM cursor position is set to the top/bottom of the cell correctly and instead assumes last position\n. The Travis OSX builds are too slow, Linux will have to suffice...\n. > Not quite sure yet how all this is meant to work with their sanitize option which looks as it if it is expressly for people wanting to allow HTML in their MD.\nSeems like the default sanitize=false would mean don't sanitize and thus allow HTML.  Maybe this option isn't working as intended...\nOkay, I just fiddled around with the demo a bit.  \ninput:\nhello wor<b>l</b>d\nsanitize: true:\nhello wor&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;d\nsanitize: false:\nhello wor<b>l</b>d\nLooks like the render results need to be set using dangerouslySetInnerHTML or a document fragment.  I think this is something internal to the component itself.  The downside to this is that users can dump Javascript into the MD unless we use something like Google Caja.\n. Just to clarify, what I typed above is what the users sees.  For example, here is sanitize: true \n\n. \n. Okay, this is good to go I think...  I updated to process outputs too.\n. I forget in which PR I fixed it, but this is fixed in master now...\n. I wonder if something's up with the cache...\n. Looks like the problem is in enchannel zmq.  Specifically imports of rxjs/rx instead of rxjs/Rx.\n. :+1: \n. I think we need to adjust the offset of the toolbars to make things look nicer with the new icon set.\n. Later, I'm not sure how it should be handled yet\n. Woohoo!  Thanks Kyle!\n. Ah this was closed yesterday by #456 \n. Action shot:\n\n. I wish it was animated though...  I think I may look into the splash screen method @rgbkrk suggested in slack.\n. No, animations, svg, iframe, gif etc, don't render during the synchronous require call :(\n. I think in the jupyter/notebook if the kernel is not connected the \"executing\" execution state of the cell is set, is that right?  Should we use that behavior here instead of clearing the prompt number?  \nPersonal opinion, I think clearing the prompt number makes more sense, because the \"executing\" state implies that when the kernel is connected, the cells will be executed.\n. Love the idea to add a test, doing it now....\n. Okay, I just added a test.  I only test the CSS structure of things that aren't affected by user state.  i.e. .cell-creator is not tested because the mouse needs to hover between the cells.  Testing these user stateful things would be more complicated.\n. Oh you know what, I was testing on the classic theme.  It may be that the mask is different than the other themes.  I can look at this tomorrow\n. Thanks for opening this @kenwheeler , it's looking good!\n. I should be able to look at this and the bits you mention later today...\n. > Ok weird, I can no longer reproduce the lack of ability to switch kernels. Not sure what's up.\nI had this problem once locally, but I resolved it by reinstalling the kernels.\n. I'll take a look now :)\n. :+1: :fireworks: :100: Thanks @kenwheeler !\n. I just had this problem a second ago too in the sticky cell PR!  lol\n. Stellar :star: \n. Closing for #485\n. This is working now:\n\nIt requires you to have version 5.x of ipywidgets (latest stable).  Note, you don't need to install widgetsnbextension or activate the nbextension.  Just pip install ipywidgets\nThe Widget Javascript not detected.  It may not be installed properly. Did you enable the widgetsnbextension? If not, then run \"jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension\" message is showing because I haven't implemented the frontend version validation comm yet...  It should be a simple fix though.  \nSome widgets wont render correctly because there's a lot of missing CSS.\nAlso I haven't added any unit tests for this code.\n. cc @rgbkrk @sylvaincorlay\n. Okay, fixed the version validation:\n\n. Hey,\nI'm just dropping in briefly from Cancun Mexico via paid internet so not much time to type...  I think the idea of specing some type of styling, either CSS var based or DOM structure based, would be great.  I agree that CSS vars are probably the way to go as it allows lab/nteract/notebook to structure widgets differently if needed and also allows custom widget authors to \"recylce\" theme colors/styles.\nOn a separate note, if either of you want to jump in on the action while I'm away, or @captainsafia @kenwheeler , feel free to do so!  There's a lot that can still be done.  Otherwise I'll be back later next week and I'll try to drop in every now and then when I'm able to get access to the internet. :)\n. Widget theme support via CSS vars:\n\ncc @SylvainCorlay\n. > Cool! Does it come with an ipywidgets PR for the css?\nI think it would be great to use the CSS there too.  The CSS featured in the gif is a complete replacement for the CSS included with the widgets.  I did this to avoid dependency on bootstrap CSS and jqueryui CSS and to make sure everything used CSS variables where appropriate, for tight integration with themes. \n. However, it wouldn't be a direct port - this CSS is for ipywidgets stable, not dev.\n. TODO:\n- [x] Get sliders to render correctly\n- [x] Associate state update messages to sending cell\n. I've hit all the major goals for this PR and now I want to go back through and clean things up.  Also, it seems like there is a race condition somewhere in the RxJS stuff, either at the widget/comm level or lower.\n. /me hums cheerful tune :notes: \n. > elevates the widgets to having their own specific section of the document as part of cell areas, not leaving room for how bokeh, matplotlib notebook mode, and others that use the comms\nThere are a couple of alternative ways to handle this: \n- One is to dump widgets directly into the output area of the cell instead of a \"widget area\".  This would break simple animation, but this is the path JupyterLab chose.\n- The other is to have a page level widget area, that all cells share.  This could even live in a separate window.\n\nties us to a specific version of the widgets. This is the same problem we were facing with Thebe and generally across the notebook is shelved here again. We need a static resource spec to fetch. Relatedly...\nour shim layer has to match the version of ipywidgets in use\n\nThere is no way to avoid this- we can move the nteract widget specific JS into another package, but that package will still be dependent on specific backend version of the widgets, this is the nature of the beast.  See the \"versionValidation\" logic in the backend-sync module.\n\nWhere indicated above, also in accordance with C4.1, we have ourselves a \"lack of spec\" issue.\n\nI'd be happy to create a widget communication spec here, but it really belongs in Jupyter.\n. Here's an idea: let's move away from widget area, dump widgets straight into output, and I can make widgets a true and through npm package \"extension\" of nteract.  Of course, we'd need to spec how extensions get registered/loaded (my vote is for the npm API).\n. Overall codecov increased, but PR content had 0 coverage.  I decided to merge anyways.\n. > @jdfreder's widgets PR which retries the test until whatever weird race condition with executeCell is happening is avoided.\nAwesome, sounds good.  I'm working on a fix for the underlying problem in the widgets PR.\n. Thanks Kyle! :cake: \n. This seems to make the timeout more ... ug.  Will investigate more later\n. :tada: \n. :fish: :fish_cake: \n. I think it may make more sense to do the execution as a GUI test, since our current functional test is a GUI test and it would allow us to cover end-end. \n. negligible decrease, but we should strive for 100% coverage\n. BSD or MIT are okay with me too \n. Perfect, thanks @rgbkrk!\n. Okay, patch applied and rebased \ud83d\ude01 \n. Looks like the thunkservables need to be replaced by epics before this is functional again.  Also, the unit tests are being problematic.  I will need to think of a game plan for them.  I'm leaning towards nuking them, because they rely on a live kernel instance - which we know is far from deterministic and far from being a unit test...\n. Thanks for the patch :)  Applied\n. Thanks @captainsafia , this is excellent! \n. Thanks Kyle!\n. lol, I supposed it makes sense that lint configurations are not backwards compatible.  We should fix the linter config version....\n. woot :cactus: \n. Fancy bot :rocket: \n. > Sad :panda_face: \n\n. It'd probably make sense to find/make a shim for dynamically loaded AMD modules, because this wont be the only Jupyter notebook thing people will try to load- and it would be nice if we could fail gracefully.\nAs far as plotly is concerned, IIRC it's just defining an anonymous module, which the to-be shim should handle fine.\n. :+1: \n.

Might as well turn this into a link:\n(Slack)[http://slack.nteract.in]\n. I suggest putting this in a batch file under ./scripts and having the travis.yml call out to it\n. because it's just annoying to code in a yml or json file array\n. For some reason this is not triggering for me...  Looking into it....\n. Not here :(\n. Yeah, that's another case that the menu API does not handle yet but is a perfect candidate for incremental improvements!\n. whoops, thanks for removing this!\n. TODO: add roles to other menu items too\n. Ah @rgbkrk this is the part I missed, I wasn't sure how to get state anywhere other than in a reducer (which is why I put the save there)\n. Awesome!  Also, you'll need to rebase this at some point\n. I could have IPC'ed back to the main thread, but that seemed ridiculous \n. The new notebook menu item does open a new window.   I don't think the action should open a new window because the action's purpose is to dispatch state reducers.\n. +1\n. Yup\n. Purposefully excluded, kernelspecs does not provide that information, it is obtained from kernel start.\n. Yeah, familiarity is nice, but it's easy to forget which you have imported and which is being called.  This may just be a \"jon\" problem, else we may want to think about a name change, like fromNotebookJS ...\n. toPromise(), neat.  I learn something new everyday!\n. This implementation looks much tighter than the jupyter/notebook sibling\n. Slick\n. You probably didn't mean to leave this in, did you?\n. You know what I like even more, .map(resolve).foreach(launchFilename)\n. I :heart: commander\n. Much better\n. --kernel makes sense for the new notebook feature\n. Ditto!\n.

No,\nClone and \nnpm install\nIf they want to develop\nnpm run build:watch\nand if they want to release\nnpm run dist:linux64\ndist will run build.\n. @Carreau I don't know if this is a valid way of describing it, but I think of it like this:\njs\nimport c from './a';\nis like the following in Python\npython\nimport a as c\nwhere\njs\nimport {b} from './a';\nis like the following in Python\npython\nfrom a import b\n. I'm surprised this is that big!\n. At some point we will want the keymap to handle things like this.  For now we may want to change this to tab (if we can easily, without breaking indent).\n. :+1: \n. :heavy_check_mark: \n. @rgbkrk there was mutable state in our app state \ud83d\ude32 \n. Yeah :(\n. Oh, yeah, there are a bunch of different cursors you can choose from.  It's awesome. :heart: css\n. I did, and I tested the life cycle events by hand, this gets fired at all times.  The shouldUpdate life cycle event returns true by default.  Since this is passed as a prop, it triggers the didupdate method.  http://ricostacruz.com/cheatsheets/react.html#updating\n. When you're not in the context of an object, and don't need to use arrow functions, it makes more sense to use a named function because it's easier to debug in a stack trace.\n. Yeah, I can add a comment for now.  In the future this entire thing should disappear for a keymap replacement IMHO\n. :heavy_check_mark: comments added\n. User CSS should always be loaded after all base CSS been loaded.  This increases the specificity of the user's CSS selectors.  IOW it makes it so user CSS doesn't have to use !important.  Additionally, it allows CSS vars that are declared in the base to be overridden in the theme files, which is not possible without this change.\n. Channels is set even if the kernel hasn't started\n. To clarify, the channels observables exist but may point to a kernel that hasn't started\n. I know, I really didn't want to either\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. You need to add stickyCells to the document key of your originalState above.\n. Here you use state.document.executionState but above you use state.document.get to access notebook.  Is state.document immutable or not?\n. IOW, I think one of the lines is wrong\n. Ah, looks like you are using get everywhere.  This line should be a get call too.  If get causes it to break, that means the code setting the execution state on the state.document is doing it wrong\n. .dispatch undefined here is causing the tests to fail.  Isn't accessing the store in an action an anti pattern?  Also, in actions, don't we normally do this with a store subscriber and subscriber.next instead of store.dispatch?\n. This setTimeout line will cause the test to pass even if it should fail because of a timeout (set by this.timeout above).\n. :+1: \n. Actually, looking in test/utils.js at the liveStore function, that's not the problem.  It's correct here.\n. Ah, it's similar to a bug I just dealt with.  This same test copy and pasted into a test folder called \"widgets\" would fail because it was being executed after the \"components\" tests.  The trick in that case was that the bug was in the component tests, specifically with the Latex component.  I added a global flag to disable MathJax per test and that seemed to do the trick.  Maybe the timeout is something similar?  Have you tried making the timeout more verbose?  It may be eating an error which is causing the timeout...\n. Also, don't forget to rebase on master.  This test will timeout intentionally if code cell execution doesn't work on the branch.\n. cellMsgAssociations is a map of cell id to msg id\n. store is passed to commRelatedMessages which passes it to getChannels\n. Yeah, I can un-break this out.  It's a little akward though because the widget theme variables inside main.css depend on these, even though the way CSS evaluates everything will work regardless of order.\n. As an aside, I don't think it makes sense to add widget CSS vars to every theme, and yet I think they should work with simple theme defaults\n. I must have :sleeping: - strange, period and all...\n. Whoops, this was left over from early on.\n. :heavy_check_mark: \n. :heavy_check_mark: \n. :heavy_check_mark: \njs\n// Defer the initial value till the channels are subscribed to.  This will\n  // make it so the action of a subscription will cause the current channels to\n  // be emitted, regardless of whether or not they were set long before when\n  // the subscriber subscribes.\n. :heavy_check_mark: \n. :heavy_check_mark: \n. Ah, that was to deal with the jupyter-js-widgets API which is really Pythonic.  It can be removed, I just missed it on my pass through.\n. This doesn't create a widget manager, but passes a handle to the one created because it's needed to create the view elements.\n. No, not that I'm aware of.  The best guide for something like that is the widget source code itself.\n. Whoops, this was a rebase failure\n. Not sure what you're talking about, is that an argument of subscribe?\n. nit: Why don't you unpack this like you do on line 85?. nit: Since this is user facing I think it makes sense to add a period, right? Do you mind doing that while you're touching this file?\n . Do you want to actually throw an error since it shouldn't occur? Or log it somehow?. nit: \"If there is\". This seems a little weird to me for a couple of reasons:\n\nThis component is aware of the context which it is embedded.\nAbove is ambiguous, even within the context.\n\nMaybe to resolve both, invert it and call it addProvider so that the parents are telling the component what to do?\nOr if 1 is not an issue, maybe rename it to withinAProvider or withinProvider?\nPlease let me know what your thinking is here. I may be missing something fundamental (e.g. it's okay for children to know about their context).. Isn't this recursive, with hasProviderAbove always set to false? I'm having trouble seeing where you flip hasProviderAbove.. Oh I see, the provider sets hasProviderAbove!. I see now, provider sets this property. If I'm right, ignore my name change suggestion. I was just talking to M about this. Yeah, really it just requires access to msg channels. I'll restrict the API to clarify.\n... I juggled the idea of trying to record and replay comm messages on display, but that's not possible with the spec as-is because it's not symmetric. In other words, state changes caused by interactions with the front-end would not be captured and replayed when widgets are re-displayed (so the state would be butchered).. Whoops! Doh! Stupid copy pasta. Looking at flow's source (https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/lib/react.js#L231), looks like {current: null | React$ElementRef<ElementType>} is more correct, although I'm not sure that's what you were thinking. . ... although, changing it to this causes flowtype to fail on the line below where I <div ref=. So I've reverted it to its current state.. Looks like if I'm not going to connect() from within the Jupyter-Widget component, the next appropriate place is notebook-app,js, from which I'll have to tunnel the propert down through the <Output> component. Does that sound right?. So, in the current state of nteract, this would look like the following:\n\nConnect at notebook-app-component/src/notebook-app.js\nTunnel to display-area/src/output.js\nTunnel to display-area/src/richest-mime.js\nTunnel to display-area/src/richest-mime.js end at <Tranform which will point to the JupyterWidgets media transform.\n. Done.. Whoops, last I left nteract we were using trailing commas - I take it we aren't anymore?. Thanks!. I may have disabled git hooks at one point in time. I'll double check - it's only on my older Mac that the hooks don't run.. I don't think we actually need this line. Running tsc will try to compile, nothing, and succeed.. We may want to prioritize converting @nteract/transforms, because I don't think it's a good idea to turn off noImplicitAny for an extended period of time - it makes turning it back on difficult.. fixed - thanks. The asterisk is, yes. Thanks, yeah I saw the doc because Kyle shared it with me, it's very nice. I haven't had time to actually update this PR until now (I've just been rebasing it so that it doesn't fall too far behind). I'll ping back when it's ready for a review.. :heavy_check_mark: . :heavy_check_mark: . :heavy_check_mark: that makes sense. :heavy_check_mark:  - it was left over from earlier. Hurray for 3rd person descriptive comments!. thanks. For request/reply messages, I anticipate this being required, or a secondary message to communicate the failure. I wanted to make post message API transparent to the Subject's behavior, so that downstream you don't have to worry as much about what is happening upstream of you. \n\ne.g. Let's say the widget rendering code fails during rendering. The widget rendering normally results in a reaction which sends a resize request to nteract. In the failure case, the error would bubble up and on the nteract side of the fence the observable for resize requests would receive the error. With this, nteract could display an application level error message to the user.\n. \ud83d\udc4d . ",

You need to run Install Shell Commands from the menu before using the commandline interface. Thanks for trying it.\n. I updated it.\nIt won't work with npm run start --kernel python2 because somehow it doesn't recognize the kernel flag.\n. I understand it now.\nOne has to use npm run start -- --kernel javascript  to make it work.\n. @rgbkrk That's what I thought as well \ud83d\ude04 \n. \ud83d\udc4d \u23f3 \n. Fixes #979 \n. We should get the mathjax bits merged before the next release. It depends on how much time is needed for webpack.\n. CI is good now. I don't know why codecov is complaining.\n. I'm going to merge this since the appveyor failures are unrelated.\n. Wuhu it works on Windows \ud83c\udf89 \nTested with cmd.exe, git bash and powershell\n. I think it's fine to return the arguments even if nothing changed. \nFor example fs.readFile only returns the data. On the other hand readFileObservable returns the filepath (which was passed in as a argument) and the data. This is used here.\nWe could either change it and be consistent with fs or leave it and decide to allways return everything (which would require no change).\n. Great! Thanks for verifying \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hmm this is strange. We don't even use open in the shell script.\nCould you run wich nteract?\n. Excellent! \ud83c\udf89 \n. Didn't thought of that. We check whether the commandline option has a .ipynb extension but not if it exists.\n. What would the behavior be if we use open -a -n nteract_exe on OS X instead of nohup nteract_exe & in the shell script?\nThat's what Atom does.\n. OK if we use open without -n and nteract is running it would only bring nteract to the foreground without opening a new window. Is this the behavior we want?\n. @rgbkrk It looks like a network problem. We could tell AppVeyor and Travis to retry the installation if we experience more issues like this.\nAnyway, ~~I'll make~~ I made a PR to the shell-env package to remove the deprecation warning.\n. It's likely a problem with the commonmark parser.\nIn the markdown cell \\\\ will always render as \\ as well.\n. Thanks!\n. We can add rimraf to the development dependencies.\n. Oh I see we have it in the dev deps already.\n. You cloud use the extraResources option and move the example notebooks out of the app directory. This way we could keep using ASAR.\n. @beojan I guess we have to try it out \ud83d\ude09 \nYou can take a look at the Electron API demo app. They have a example and a style sheet there.\n. @dhirschfeld No problem. I can test it.\n. Right now it isn't possible to change the install directory with electron-builder: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/596\nThough we could add a option to install nteract only for the current user.\n. I can make it bigger if you like. It is now rendered @2x.\n. This was closed in #1082 \nThanks to @vperezma \ud83d\udc4d\n. @jdetle I think you are missing to call the done() callback on the in your tests. I suppose line 80 only works because it's synchronous.\nI can push a fix, but it'll probably make both tests fail :wink:\n. I removed the failing test for now until we figure out how to properly test publishEpic.\n. Webpack throws the following error on my machine:\n```\nERROR in ./app/~/vega-scenegraph/src/util/canvas.js\nModule not found: Error: Cannot resolve module 'canvas' in /Users/lukasgeiger/code/nteract/app/node_modules/vega-scenegraph/src/util\n @ ./app/~/vega-scenegraph/src/util/canvas.js 11:17-34\nERROR in ./app/~/vega-scenegraph/src/util/ImageLoader.js\nModule not found: Error: Cannot resolve module 'canvas' in /Users/lukasgeiger/code/nteract/app/node_modules/vega-scenegraph/src/util\n @ ./app/~/vega-scenegraph/src/util/ImageLoader.js 51:19-36\n```\n. Yes it builds fine\n. > We are so close to 90%!\nThat was the motivation \ud83d\ude04 \n. Closing in favor of #1131 \n. Thanks for the feedback!\nWhich operating are you on?\nDoes it open by running just nteract?\n. @desilinguist To eliminate variables, could you try nteract from a bash console?\n. Does nteract --verbose from your zsh shell work?\n. Thanks for your fast reply!\nIt's definitely failing here. It seems like nohup doesn't correctly disconnect the process from the terminal.\n@rgbkrk Any idea how to fix this? If everything fails we could spawn nteract from a node process like we do on windows.\n. @desilinguist Bare with me (I have no idea why it's not working), could you try if the following commands also fail:\n- nohup nteract --verbose &\n- nohup nteract --verbose > /dev/null 2>&1 &\n. I can reproduce this in my linux VM now which means it's not a OS X specific problem and we can't use open -a.\nI see this strange behavior: The splash screen stays open until I close the terminal, then nteract opens normally.\n. I can't get it to work. At this point (and since we are using a very similar script compared to Atom) I'm unsure if the problem is caused by the shell script or by the splash screen.\n. @rgbkrk It's a problem with the splash screen. If I start nteract from a simple node script (without nohup #1133 ) I get the following strange behavior.\n\nI also would vote for removing the splash screen all together. I always have the feeling it slows down startup. But that's a general feeling I get also from other apps that use a fancy splash screen.\n. That would be great!\n. @tylerwince After starting nteract with npm start run Install Shell Commands from the menu bar (you should find it in one of the submenus). This should initialize the shell commands.. Well, it doesn't really solve a problem. So I think we can close it.\nI shared it because this code eliminates variables when trying to debug #1132.\n. For reference: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/869#issuecomment-258255164\n. @rgbkrk The fix was released in electron-builder 7.21.0\nI pushed a commit to update it\n. One hour later and it would have been there \ud83d\ude04 : https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/releases\n. Only the saving and kernel restart dialogs are cut off.\nThe save notifications are also correct. I triggered them with cmd-s.\n. Hey that's great! :tada:\nI would start with a copy of the default or dark theme in nteract and modify the color values.\nFeel free to ask here or on slack if you need more help!\n. The colors are defined here: https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax/blob/master/styles/syntax-variables.less. > Are there any more like this?\nI don't know. Discovered this at random.. Wow, electron-builder doesn't recommend a two package.json anymore, since it supports rebuilding of native apps with one file as well.\nI think we should go back to one package.json file in order to improve the dev experience. What do you think?\n. \ud83d\udc4d  PR will come on monday\n. I have no idea why CI fails with:\nprebuild ERR! stack Error: 404 response downloading https://iojs.org/download/release/v1.4.6/iojs-v1.4.6.tar.gz\n. It's strange, I can't reproduce this on my local machine.\nThe problem arises when electron-builder tries to rebuild zeromq.\nTo rebuild it runs \nnpm run install -- --disturl=https://atom.io/download/electron --target=1.4.6 --runtime=electron --arch=x64 --build-from-source\nsince zeromq uses prebuild this will be expanded to\nprebuild --install --preinstall \"npm run build:libzmq\" \"--disturl=https://atom.io/download/electron\" \"--target=1.4.6\" \"--runtime=electron\" \"--arch=x64\" \"--build-from-source\"\nThe problem is target is a option for prebuilt defining the Node.js version to build against. Hence we get a download error because there is now Node.js version 1.4.6.\n@develar Would it be better to use\nnpm rebuild --disturl=https://atom.io/download/electron --target=1.4.6 --runtime=electron --arch=x64 --build-from-source\ninstead of npm run install for rebuilding?\n. @develar Thanks a lot for your help. electron-builder is working really great for us.\nWith prebuild one can provide prebuilt binaries for different node versions. For example prebuilt --target 7.0.0 would build the native module against node 7.0.0. Though this doesn't work for electron since prebuild doesn't support the --runtime flag.\nOne can also rebuild only a specific node module by running npm rebuild <module name>.\nI still don't know why the rebuilding works on my machine (OS X) just fine but doesn't work on Travis and AppVeyor. I'll investigate soon.\n. Wow @develar you are amazing! Thanks!\n. Woo Travis is green \ud83d\udc9a \nThis is ready to test now \ud83c\udf89 \n. Looks like https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/7918\n. They fixed the error reporter in https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8003. It looks like it's having issues because the path contains a space. I'll investigate.\n. @willingc This looks like a different error. It doesn't find your C compiler. \nMaybe there is something wrong with the xcode compilers. Could you run xcode-select --install and try it again?\n. Hmm I get the same message.\nDo you get a error if you run gcc --version?\n. > So I'm running in a conda environment with Python 2. Let me install python 2 from python.org and see if that solves it if I run without a virtualenv or conda env.\nI'm afraid this won't help since it fails while building libzmq.\n. That's interesting.

Closed by #1218. Oops I just introduced conflicts by merging #1199. I'm going to rebase.\n. Nice!. Oops You're right. But the issue with local images is still there.. I go ahead and merge this. Since it fixes the master build.. Closed in #1292. For reference: https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8205. Alright rebased and ready to go. @rgbkrk Thanks for the review \ud83d\udc4d . Just saw there is already a issue for that. I guess this fixes #1274.\n\\cc @jkornblum . > Are there man pages already written, or some documentation similar to it? typing man nteract in a terminal should give usage documentation.\nnteract --help will give basic usage documentation of the CLI.. Closing in favor of #1316 . Rebased and fixed my mistake.. Closing in favor of #1316. @rgbkrk Thanks for the feedback. I changed it to only rely on async ipc calls.. Against my assumptions ijavascript doesn't install the kernel spec on npm install which is awesome and makes it usable for bundling.\nLet's get this PR out of the demo stage \ud83d\ude80  \ud83d\udd1c . Ready to try out:\n. > I'm a bit hesitant with bringing in something that relies on a github repo directly\nMe too, if think we can wait till https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript/pull/92 gets merged. It looks like the new version of flow discovered a wrong type definition in fbjs. I'll take a closer look.. I made a PR to fbjs which should fix the typings: https://github.com/facebook/fbjs/pull/214. > I think we want to keep the edge case for no kernels around even if our configuration defaults to having one.\nAlright. I reverted 654f1ec6d3465c120374d1266d41ae68d13c7840. \n. We also need to bump electronVersion used by electron-builder.. @jdetle was faster \ud83d\ude02  -> #1353. > Where'd you learn about this?\n@rgbkrk mentioned it some time ago.\nI'm pretty sure we could also include source maps for easier debugging and do a more optimized build during packaging. @rgbkrk Are the restarts limited?\nIt looks like it retries infinitely: https://travis-ci.org/nteract/nteract/jobs/198150130#L2953. Fixed in #1401 . That's great \ud83c\udf89 \n\nIs there a way to force the @media type in View > Toggle Developer Tools?\n\nYes this is possible: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9540990/using-chromes-element-inspector-in-print-preview-mode?answertab=votes#tab-top. Looks like we need to change the build config: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Options#NsisOptions. With the React 16 release we might be able to revisit our strategy here.. > Since we weren't using any classes here I figured I could trim down on what we end up exporting.\n\ud83d\udc4d Thanks for the explaination. I was just curious.. This was fixed by #1608. Great, Thanks for getting this started!. > This flow error may be hard to fix\nFor now we could add a $FlowFixMe above this line to make the build pass.. Closed by #1700 . I guess this error is caused by the ansi-react upgrade in #1427.\nAny idea, how we should fix it?. \ud83d\udc4d I fixed the failing test.. Oh wait, I'm unsure if the packages use the correct .babelrc since there's no babel-preset-es2015 in the package.json which should be required. Yet the build doesn't fail.. I just checked, it's using the correct .babelrc with the es2015.. Just checked the Electron app still works as expected \ud83c\udf89 . Unfortunately lerna bootstrap --hoist is still very slow but with lerna bootstrap the Electron app won't work.\nOne could take a look at which packages need to be hoisted and manually add them with a glob pattern. Though I'm wondering if it would work without, if we move the Electron app inside the packages/ folder.. There a two possibilities: Either move everything inside the packages folder or leave electron-builder in the root package.json and point it to the right folder.. Oh, I think for this one we need new prebuilts of zeromq.\nI'll try to retrigger the release builds for zeromq on CI. If we have luck the missing prebuilts will be uploaded automatically.. I spoke to soon. We're currently blocked by https://github.com/mafintosh/prebuild/pull/167 before we can ship a new zeromq version for Electron 1.6.. The packages (notebook-preview-demo may be a exception) all have React and Immutable as peerDependencies so they won't install separately.. With this PR the size of packages/ is over 230 MB though 78MB are only from notebook-preview-demo. \nThat's definitely to much. I'm closing this one.. @alexandercbooth Thanks you for fixing it \ud83d\udc4d . New versions of OS X enable system integrity protection per default. Meaning that setting the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH will have no effects.\nI had this issue before in another context, but it looks like it's a common issue on other Node modules as well: https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/issues/231\nHere is a guide to turn of SIP: http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/05/disable-rootless-system-integrity-protection-mac-os-x/. Closed via #1534. @rgbkrk You're right it isn't used anywhere. I'll submit a PR to remove it.. Or which is even simpler, we can ignore it with lerna to not install per default: https://github.com/lerna/lerna#--ignore-glob. I made a PR to babel-cli which would allow us to transpile our packages from one place with a simple option and add file watching without using gulp or maintaining a build script.. @gnestor Thanks! Do you think this is good to merge?. Yep, the whole color palette got more colorful.. @amueller For building a release on linux with npm run dist you need additional dependencies. You can install them with:\nbash\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y icnsutils graphicsmagick xz-utils. I don't think it's a problem with your node version since npm start works fine.\nOn Linux electron-builder needs some dependencies that aren't installed with a normal npm install. Try the command I mentioned above \ud83d\ude04 . Random Travis hick-up: https://travis-ci.org/nteract/nteract/builds/212043616 \ud83d\udc9a . Eslint hickup: https://travis-ci.org/nteract/nteract/jobs/212942989. Random hickup: https://travis-ci.org/nteract/nteract/builds/213215738. No it doesn't: https://travis-ci.org/nteract/nteract/builds/213223244. It looks like for some reason the nohup command doesn't work on your machine. Which shell are you using?\nIf you feel adventurous you could install the development version of nteract and try out this branch. It uses a different method for spawning and detaching nteract from the terminal.. @AlJohri Excellent! Thanks a lot for trying!\nPlease go ahead and make a PR. It shouldn't need a rebase, I rebased it onto master before I sent you the link \ud83d\ude09 \n\nusing the CLI it always creates a separate dock icon each time you type nteract with or without a filename; clicking on the filename in Finder or App itself this doesn't occur\n\nYou're right, that's annoying but at the moment expected behavior. We should definitely improve this.. Closed by #1700 . Interesting, the logs don't really tell me anything useful but I can't find the error in the Travis log either.\nThis looks more like a electron-builder problem though.. That's interesting. Here it says it installed the prebuilt successfully, but it tries to install it again during the lerna build. It may fail there because the prebuild-install executable isn't available then?. It looks like we run into: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/1415. This was tricky to debug since electron-builder didn't log to stdout during rebuilding (https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/pull/1450). \nhttps://github.com/mafintosh/prebuild-install/pull/33 will fix this issue.. https://github.com/mafintosh/prebuild-install/pull/33 is shipped.\nOur builds are now 2 minutes faster than before \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\udc9a \n. Nice!. Closed by #1634 . Closed by #1634 . Great!\nYou'll probably need to use electron-builder version 16.8.1 since 16.8.0 has a regression: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/1415#issuecomment-292797981. > Ok cool, I'll pin to 16.8.0.\n16.8.0 has the regression. It should be fixed in 16.8.1. I guess this is because we don't sign our windows application yet. Here is a similar issue on the Atom repo: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3927. > It could probably even be built from the non-dist version so that it doesn't bundle it's own versions of d3, regl, etc.\n\ud83d\udc4d We can look into that in the future. For now, I think using plotly.min.js (2MB unpacked) is a good compromise and already a huge improvement.\nWhat do you think about calling the repo plotly-electron similar to mathjax-electron but releasing it as @nteract/plotly?. Closed by #1642 . Closes #1641 . Hmm I cannot reproduce the lerna error locally \ud83d\ude15 . \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f semantic-release published @nteract/plotly as a private package. Now it should work.. New versions of our lerna packages would be great so we can use it in Hydrogen.. Oh no, a native module... Just kidding \ud83d\ude09 \n\nError: Module version mismatch. Expected 48, got 53.\n\nThis error is due to the fact that electron-builder rebuilds the native module against Electron headers (53) to be able to use it. But the unit test run on your local Node.js version (48). \nProbably the easiest option is to avoid using git-utils in the tests and mock the behavior instead. Otherwise we would need to rebuild the module against the correct version.\nSince this adds a new native dependency we would need to revert #1268 (except for the package.json changes). Or we ask the git-utils team if they would be interested in providing prebuilt binaries via prebuild .\n. @Carreau Excellent work \ud83c\udf89 ! Great that https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/issues/51 is picked up.\nAtom's autocomplete API is definitely a awesome source of inspiration since it has support for a lot of additional metadata.\nApart from the custom icons depending on the completion type, I really enjoy seeing the function signature and a peak at the docs string.\nThere's a rather old branch on Hydrogen using https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/8720 to try out support for completion metadata.\nI'm more than happy to collaborate on supporting this in Hydrogen. It's probably a good place to try out more metadata since it's quite easy to implement thanks to Atom's autocomplete API.\n. > How should we hack on individual packages while working on the main app? Same build steps as before?\nIn theory lerna only uses a different client to install dependencies. I should test it though.\nI'll fix up the CI failures tomorrow.. > How should we hack on individual packages while working on the main app? Same build steps as before?\nI just checked this works the exactly the same.. It looks like prebuild-install doesn't download the prebuilt binaries:\nlerna ERR! execute prebuild-install info install installing inside prebuild-install directory,\n skipping download.\nI can't reproduce this error on macOS.\nCould you test if prebuilts are properly installed if you do yarn add zeromq in a empty directory?\nThis would help to narrow down the problem.. @bgatessucks Thanks for testing!\nIt looks like this check fails on windows if installed via lerna and/or electron-builder.. Did it ever work for you with yarn?\nIt's hard for me to debug because I don't have a proper windows machine.. > I'll give it a go with my windows laptop this next week, devoting time to builds across platforms so we can ship on all the platforms soon.\nThanks for taking a look. I'm happy to help debug, it's just very painful to do on my super slooow Windows VM.. > The tests still get run on the data resource package if you take out the test line? When rebuilding a single package can we still do it from within the package for? \nYes, all other packages don't have devDependencies either.\n\nDo we have to have jest, etc. all installed globally?\n\nNo, lerna should take care of that.. > I can go ahead and ship this too for Hydrogen's sake unless you've got some more things.\nNo rush, I probably won't have time to finish up the Hydrogen branch in the next few days anyway.. I guess we need to update yarn.lock to use the latest version of node-abi to support Electron 1.7+.. I can't reproduce this issue anymore on master. I think it was fixed with the latest kernelspecs update.. Strange, I just checked with latest master and still see this issue.. > Want me to ship a minor release?\nYeah would be great. No rush. Thanks for fixing this mess. That's awesome!. @rgbkrk Thanks a lot for the review!\nI did some further testing and unfortunately the ANSI parsing plays only a small part of the performance problem \ud83d\ude15 .\nI recorded a performance profile of different Ansi components while executing\npython\nprint(\"This is tooooooo long :(\" * 1000000)\n\nCurrent master took 9.07 s to render\nA functional component with no ANSI escaping renders in 8.34 s:\njs\nconst Ansi = props => <code className={props.className}>{props.children}</code>;\nA pure component with no ANSI escaping renders in 8.24 s:\njs\nclass Ansi extends React.PureComponent {\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps) {\n    return (\n      this.props.children != nextProps.children ||\n      this.props.className != nextProps.className\n    );\n  }\n  render() {\n    return <code className={this.props.className}>{this.props.children}</code>;\n  }\n}\n\nThe performance gain of precomputing the ANSI escape will increase when handling streaming output but this doesn't solve the rendering problem \ud83d\ude15 .\nPlease note, I only recorded the profiles once so I don't claim any statistical significance but it's clear to see that removing the ANSI parsing won't fix the rendering performance issues.\nI'm happy to upload the recorded profiles if someone wants to investigate further.. Since this doesn't solve the problem, I think we can close it for now.. Just tried out this branch :tada:\nI'm hitting a strange bug when trying a simple bokeh example:\n```python\nfrom bokeh.io import push_notebook, show, output_notebook\nfrom bokeh.layouts import row, gridplot\nfrom bokeh.plotting import figure, show, output_file\noutput_notebook()\nimport numpy as np\nx = np.linspace(0, 4*np.pi, 100)\ny = np.sin(x)\nTOOLS = \"pan,wheel_zoom,box_zoom,reset,save,box_select\"\np1 = figure(title=\"Legend Example\", tools=TOOLS)\np1.circle(x,   y, legend=\"sin(x)\")\np1.circle(x, 2y, legend=\"2sin(x)\", color=\"orange\")\np1.circle(x, 3y, legend=\"3sin(x)\", color=\"green\")\nshow(p1)\n```\nThis used to work in previous versions of nteract, but now the app completely crashes without any debug output.. Oh no, the immutable.js type are broken for flow 47. Should we ship a new major version, since this changes behavior? Or would you consider this a patch release?. \ud83d\udc4d  Sounds good to me.. Wow cool stuff \ud83d\udcaf . Woa what's happening with travis here \ud83d\udc40 . > This highlights to me that we need tests for notebook-preview, even if a super simple one. We have to adapt that package to the new API too.\nWe definitely need tests for that.\nI adapted it already in d5955d358b7e5a480d79bcb2e8bc61fe8ab65585 but haven't tested it yet.. I verified that nodebook-preview-demo still works.. > Now that I'm looking at this again I'm surprised you didn't modify commutable to no longer have the outputs in immutable form.\nYeah, I though this would keep the diff somewhat manageable.\n\nIt just dawned on me that display updates might not work now because of how we use keypaths. Try out the example notebook at example-notebooks/display-updates.ipynb\n\nJust checked, I didn't experienced any problems with the display update notebook.. Looks like we run into https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/856 with npm 5.. Woa looks like we run into: https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper-lockfile/issues/28. Thanks for fixing this!. Closed by #1824. One Appveyor build randomly timed out. I think this is good to go.. We want to have the following modules requireable:\n```bash\n\nnpm-remote-ls --development false jmp\n\u2514\u2500 jmp@0.7.5\n   \u251c\u2500 uuid@3.1.0\n   \u2514\u2500 zeromq@4.5.0\n      \u2514\u2500 nan@2.6.2\nnpm-remote-ls --development false github\n\u2514\u2500 github@9.2.0\n   \u251c\u2500 netrc@0.1.4\n   \u251c\u2500 follow-redirects@0.0.7\n   \u2502  \u251c\u2500 stream-consume@0.1.0\n   \u2502  \u2514\u2500 debug@2.6.8\n   \u2502     \u2514\u2500 ms@2.0.0\n   \u251c\u2500 https-proxy-agent@1.0.0\n   \u2502  \u251c\u2500 agent-base@2.1.1\n   \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 extend@3.0.1\n   \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 semver@5.0.3\n   \u2502  \u251c\u2500 extend@3.0.1\n   \u2502  \u2514\u2500 debug@2.6.8\n   \u2514\u2500 mime@1.3.6\n```\n\nUnfortunately electron-builder doesn't accept my settings \ud83d\ude22 . One thing we might want to check out is: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack. I'll look into tree-shaking and minification after #1934. > Are these Travis failures unrelated? This is weird, looks like lerna didn't bootstrap right.\nLooks like we still need to build the packages for the tests to run since our testing setup doesn't recognize the nteractDesktop main field.\nIt would be great if the tests would also use the nteractDesktop main field since we could remove one build step to speed things up.. > I have a feeling that more node_modules are being included from the @nteract packages, I'd love to look at what's still in the bundled app.\nIf you want to look into the bundled app just disable asar in the electron-builder config.. > @lgeiger did you already finish off parts of this?\nI haven't touched any of the specific points listed here, but I did implement a reliable \"unsaved indicator\". If there is unsaved content, users are now prompted if they really want to quit.\nIt solves the same problem, but in the most basic/simple way possible.. We could look at what Atom does to handle this: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/atom.sh. The menu with the app name is a typical \"Mac only\" behavior.\nThe shell commands should be under the \"Help\" item on Linux and Windows. Should we move it somewhere else?. de9381e, 1863748 and cleaning the cache helped. Now CI is happy \ud83d\udc9a \n. This looks great!\nOne minor thing I found: react-redux is missing in the dependencies.. Looks like HTMLtoJSX uses a older version of React which relies on React.createClass. This method was removed in React 16, that's probably why it fails \ud83d\ude15 . One other tool to checkout would be https://github.com/ccorcos/markdown-it-renderer.\nNot a lot of people are using it though.. > I think it's ok to hoist still\nIt is, but in my experience it makes it hard to ensure that all dependencies are included in a package. E.g. transform-vega requires d3 for webpack to do it's thing but it was never a issue with hoisting because d3 is a direct dependency of another transform anyway.\nApart from that installing packages with npm inside a package folder also can mess a things up in strange ways. So I opted for not hoisting packages for now.. Do we really need to run flow-copy-source in the prepare script during bootstrap? We only need them when publishing the packages, right?\nflow-copy-source takes a really long time to do it's job.. This is ready for people to try out and see if it works on their machines.. Thanks for the review!\n\nI see now rxjs and uuid are hoisted. What made it so you had to hoist uuid?\n\nThis mock didn't work otherwise.\nI'm happy to hoist more things but if we hoist things like jmp, we'd need to modify the electron-builder setup.\n\nOne extra thing -- running the command line tools install created packages/desktop/bin/nteract-env. Maybe that's normal behavior? Maybe it's just something to gitignore?\n\nYep that's expected. We need to modify the gitingore.\n\nThe only weird thing is that lerna masks the current status of webpack:\n\nAdding --stream to the command should fix it.\n\nGuess I should test by making a fake release too.\n\nThat would be great! I can fix the other two issues you mentioned.. > Yeah I haven't figured out the dist issue, even after doing the pieces here.\nOK, running the dist commands from the root seem to work. I'll push a fix soon.. Well hoisting uuid break the packaged app.\nDo you know a way to fix this test without hoisting?. I was able to fix the mocking by setting moduleNameMapper in the jest config. Let's see what Travis thinks.. > Should I give this another spin?\nYeah would be great.. Reseted the Appveyor cache. This should now be good to go.\nFor the desktop app, I think it's best to wait for sinon support in jest-codemods, before converting fully moving to jest.. > Oh yeah, our old mock setup used mock-require and was doing it with relative paths.\nWhich mock setup are you talking about?\nenchannel-zmq-backend tests did never run after we brought them into the monorepo and at the nteract/enchannel-zmq-backend they just used regular zeromq.. Oh I see, thanks. > I'm beginning to regret my decision to rebase merge rather than do a merge commit. You'll have to rebase this against master now since I merged the other.\nRebased it \ud83d\ude80 \n\nWe can hyper optimize later\n\nYes, storing the whole notebook two times seem kind of redundant. I don't know if there is a canonical for these kind of tasks in redux.. > I think the way to do this is to register certain kinds of changes as dirty for the notebook. Then, everytime someone has a successful save we set dirty = false (in the state tree).\nThis sounds like a good approach to me.. > Checking if TERM is set is the best idea I have for detecting if we were launched from a terminal or not.\nI think process.argv should be different in the main process if it's started via the CLI.. jest-codemods are very helpful for doing the conversion. Unfortunately there's no sinon support yet: https://github.com/skovhus/jest-codemods/issues/68. @souravsingh That's amazing. There're still a few left: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/packages/desktop/test/renderer. I'd be OK to shipping a new release very soon. Now we can start shipping more often since users don't need to upgrade manually.. Looks like code mirror has line wrapping enabled. I'll check it out.. :+1: for doing a major bump.\nOn the top of my head I cannot think of anything that would be a blocking issue.. Should we add\njson\n\"commands\": {\n  \"publish\": {\n    \"ignore\": [\"packages/desktop/*\"]\n  }\n}\nto lerna.json to prevent the desktop app to be published via lerna?. @rgbkrk thanks for testing. I tried to enable minification in the past, but it failed due to memory overflow on my system (at least when minifying the renderer bundle).. I don't know why this is necessary. updateAndNotify should just be a noop on linux.\nI'm wondering if it's because it's build on mac instead of on Linux.. Update for version 0.3.1 is not available (latest version: 0.3.1, downgrade is disallowed makes me think the update succeeded.\nIt's working fine on my system:\n[2017-10-04 09:05:08.886] [info] Checking for update\n[2017-10-04 09:05:10.993] [info] Found version 0.3.1 (url: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/releases/download/v0.3.1/nteract-0.3.1-mac.zip)\n[2017-10-04 09:05:10.995] [info] Downloading update from https://github.com/nteract/nteract/releases/download/v0.3.1/nteract-0.3.1-mac.zip\n[2017-10-04 09:05:11.040] [info] / requested\n[2017-10-04 09:05:11.140] [info] /app.zip requested\n[2017-10-04 09:05:11.561] [info] download-progress listener count: 0\n[2017-10-04 09:05:12.532] [info] launching an empty notebook by default\n[2017-10-04 09:05:38.095] [info] New version 0.3.1 has been downloaded\n[2017-10-04 09:06:06.373] [info] Checking for update\n[2017-10-04 09:06:06.480] [info] launching an empty notebook by default\n[2017-10-04 09:06:08.432] [info] Update for version 0.3.1 is not available (latest version: 0.3.1, downgrade is disallowed.. Auto updates seem to work fine after a restart, even if the app is in a weird state.\nI think we can close this.. > Are you sure you didn't leave this on 1.25 speed when recording the GIF? \ud83d\ude01 This is super fast!\n\ud83d\ude02  Yeah I'm sure. Rebased it, so we don't modify @nteract/editor. Looking great. The release build will be even faster ;)\nI wonder if we should move back to the static splash screen since the video still takes quite a bit to initialize.. Also it would be great to initialize the browser window with the correct background color to get rid of the flickering with dark themes.\nDo you know if we really need to wait for the did-finish-load and will-navigate events before we can load the notebook?. > We should probably do some \"templating\" of our index.html for this, unless you're saying a setting on the BrowserWindow.\nYes it can be configured in the BrowserWindow.. There has been some changes to AppImage and NSIS in electron-builder lately. Maybe we should try with an older version.. For Travis we'll need a few more dependencies: https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build. > Wow this is a lot! Did you use a codemod or did you refactor by hand?\nYeah I used a code mod.\nOnly sinon and the electron mocks needed some refactoring by hand.. Restarted the build, now we get another error. Time to clear the cache.. This is now good to go. The remaining CI failures will be fixed by #1956 . Thanks for fixing the tests :+1:. The desktop app still has the lodash plugin enabled: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/packages/desktop/.babelrc\nSo for me this is not a blocker for the release.. I'm happy to help!\nI haven't recently experienced any issues related with kernelspecs on my machine. I though this was fixed upstream by Electron.\nRight now we're using shell-env to get the current environment.\nRecently there were quite some reports about shell-env starting rogue bash processes on Linux, so I think this is a good time to revisit this: https://github.com/lgeiger/ide-python/issues/20\nAtom uses require('electron').remote.getCurrentWindow().loadSettingsJSON to load the shell env. I think we should do the same here.. We may be able to retry this with the latest release of electron builder: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/releases/tag/v20.6.0. We should chime in at: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/2222. :+1:. Are you on the latest version of electron-builder?. We experienced something similar in Hydrogen: https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues/591\nThis was fixed by initially monitoring the sockets until they are connected.. Let's not wait for Travis on this one. Could you try if this is also happening with the light theme?. Closing in favor of #2220. Closing in favor of #2226. Is this caused by our upgrade to jest 22?. Works excellent with notebook-on-next as well :+1:. Looks like a random Travis hickup. I took the desktop app for a quick spin and everything seems to be working great. Let's go with this \ud83c\udf89 . \ud83d\udc4d next.js 4.3.0 will include this: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/3150. We're using it in the babel config for our packages. > HOWEVER. I disabled the electron-builder install-app-deps just to make this work. \ud83d\ude22\nThis may work if you move electron-builder to the root package.json and adjust the app directory for the desktop app but it'll probably still fail when bundling the app.. > Locally I'm sitting at 5.524s which is a good improvement. I don't know about Travis though.\nIs it because we're now actually running coverage on Travis?. :tada:. Good news is, the problem lies in our production webpack config and not in the dist packaging. I can reproduce this by doing a production build and running npm run spawn.. As an very simple starting point we might want to enable the jsx-no-bind ESLINT rule:\n\nA bind call or arrow function in a JSX prop will create a brand new function on every single render. This is bad for performance, as it will result in the garbage collector being invoked way more than is necessary. It may also cause unnecessary re-renders if a brand new function is passed as a prop to a component that uses reference equality check on the prop to determine if it should update.. Here's a nice little tool that logs potential unnecessary renders: https://github.com/maicki/why-did-you-update. zeromq.js hast prebuilts for electron 1.8.0 that shouldn't be the problem.. Looks like the codesign failed.. Welcome to nteract \ud83c\udf89 . > Shouldn't there be a vendor.[hash].js removed from an index.html somewhere?\n\nAhh you're right. Guess this needs some more cleanup.\nClosing for now. Rebased onto master to make Circle CI happy. . Is postinstall the right place for this?\n. I tried electron-rebuild and it didn't work out of the box. Probably it was missing a --build-from-source flag somewhere.\n. It looks like I ran into this issue: https://github.com/electron/electron-rebuild/issues/53\n. I can change that. I copied it from zmq-prebuilt without looking to much at the code.\n. I'm pretty sure the two package.json structure breaks the npm release \ud83d\ude15 .\n. I'm sure we could also make it work with a single package.json if we end up needing it. \n. How can I add a notification?\nI tried\njavascript\n    const state = window.store.getState();\n    const notificationSystem = state.app.get('notificationSystem');\n    if (err) {\n      notificationSystem.addNotification({\n        title: 'Shell Commands not Installed',\n        message: err.message,\n        level: 'error',\n      });\n    } else {\n      notificationSystem.addNotification({\n        title: 'Shell Commands Installed',\n        level: 'success',\n      });\n    }\n. Just tried it on linux and it didn't work ;)\n. I removed the version since it wasn't working and I couldn't get it to work\n. Since we filter for .ipynb files this isn't necessary anymore.\n. > Since we filter for .ipynb files this isn't necessary anymore.\n. yargs docs say:\n\nIf yargs is executed in an environment that embeds node and there\u2019s no script name (e.g. Electron or nw.js), it will ignore the first parameter since it expects it to be the script name. In order to override this behavior, use .parse(process.argv.slice(1)) instead of .argv and the first parameter won\u2019t be ignored.\n\nI don't know why we would need this.\n. I was just stressing the it because I din't know if the npm release is important.\n. I have no idea why this test breaks the whole test suite\n. Oh that's why everything breaks if there is a failure.\nI'll change that! Then the test will give a meaningful error.\nThere's probably something wrong with the path on windows like C:\\\\tmp vs /tmp.\n. Yep. There are a few files here I need to delete. Used git to sync with my windows VM.\n. I was thinking about a new utility folder next to notebook and main where we could move them\n. I'll look at mergeMap \ud83d\udc4d \nSETX sets a global environment variable (technically a registry key). I use environment variables to make it work for a dev install as well. Otherwise we would need do some guessing based on the default install directories.\n. I'm using fs.existSync here because it seems to be fast. It was undeprecated in https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/8364\n. Thanks!\nI think I'll use dialog.messageBox here. It doesn't make a difference on OS X but on windows there is a red error sign.\n. That's the path we are checking for. Maybe we shouldn't return anything at all.\n. I'll check what fs does.\n. I can add test tomorrow\n. I tried it with sion spies but couldn't get it to work.\n. It looks like AppVeyor didn't start properly and I can't restart it with the UI. I try to close and reopen your PR.\n. We load the devtools only when inside a dev environment: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/app/static/index.html#L49\nIf we want to change that we should probably get rid of this as well.\n. > This does leave us open to allowing the user to get to dev mode if they want to, without having to run off master.\nOh I see. That makes sense. I'll probably add nteract --debug flag for this.\n\nAlternatively, I could move this to the devdeps inside app/package.json.\n\nThis won't make sense since I think electron-builder won't install them.\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. That's what I tried first but I can't get it to work.\n. npm run reinstall is a bit hard and it takes long. npm install should be enough.\n. We could, but I think the problem is cause by  the test and not by the function.\nI suppose process.chdir('/') fails since it's invalid path windows.\n. The fix was released in 7.21.0\n. Ooops. Actually the mock is unnecessary right now but it could be helpful for future tests.\n. I should've added a caution-late-night-PR label \ud83d\ude02 \n. It took me way too long to figure out that process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' doesn't work, despite dev tools telling me NODE_ENV is set to production. \ud83d\ude48 \n. The release build by electron-builder works just fine without this. For this I changed the main field in the package.json file.\nOr am I missing something?\n. Oh I see.\n. No need for human greenkeeper \ud83d\ude09 \n. javascript\nImmutable.is(prev.notebook, notebook) === false\nwill behave the same.\n. I guess this needs to be\njavascript\ntransient: ImmutableMap<string, any>,\nto make flow happy.. Would it work if we move beforeEach and afterEach to the outside of the describe function? This way we don't have to repeat them.. Yes. But I noticed that icnsutils, graphicsmagick and xz-utils aren't even detected by commandExists hence this check always failed.. And they are only necessary for packaging a release.. We use lodash but didn't include it as a dep.. \ud83d\udd25 . Unnecessary use of lodash.. I don't know if there's a easy ES6 method for this.. This may even fix a bug, since:\njavascript\nconst theme = this.props.theme === 'light' || this.props.theme === 'dark' ? this.props.theme : 'light';. I'm not sure if we really need them for nteract.\nI guess these are the dependencies for canvas. Since canvas is a optional dependency it only generates a warning that can be safely ignored.. \ud83d\udc4d . dpkg -> dpkg. I guess the maintainer field only supports strings.\nYou could use nteract <nteract@sharklasers.com> instead of the full object here.. I didn't know how to fix this lint error: https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/require-default-props.md. I'm not sure, I'm not very familiar with Immutable.js. I adapted it from the lint rule description: https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/no-array-index-key.md. Oh I see. Thanks for the explaination.. \ud83d\udc4d . I can change it back to python2.8 if you like \ud83d\udc4d  \ud83d\ude04 . Waiting for https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript/pull/92 to be merged.. A bit hacky but it works as long as ijavascripts folder structure doesn't change.\nFor the long term we can make a custom kernel as outlined in https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript/pull/92.. kernelSpecs will now always contain the bundled Node.js kernel. Shouldn't we use independent mode instead?. Aren't we supposed to use @nteract/commutable here?\nBut this would mean we have to setup the correct babel config for all of the individual packages and use lerna bootstrap.. Now, I get what you're doing here, thanks for the explaination!\nWe don't use lerna in the nteract electron application since we use webpack. Instead we'll use lerna only for publishing the packages. That makes sense!. Looks like eslint isn't happy with the space behind =.. GeoJSON tests should be fixed by #1401.\nYou can also run npm run test:lint if you only want linting or try https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint. I agree with @rgbkrk.\nI tried, but can't reproduce the problem on macOS. Could this be a Chrome related bug only happening on linux?\nIf so we could try out Electron 1.5.0 beta  which is based on a newer version of Chrome.. Since we don't have **/__tests__/** directories, I think we don't need exclude them explicitly.. If we use ./lib/index.js instead we shouldn't need a dedicated index.js file in the root directory.. Since we webpack the the electron app anyway, we may be able to directly use the src files.. I don't feel strongly about that. I'm totally with keeping it as is.. Even better \ud83d\udc4d . This would be the only package with a yarn.lock file. On purpose?. \ud83d\udc4d . I'm not 100% sure about how to do this. escapeCarriageReturnSafe only escapes part of the string and possibly leaves a few carriage returns at the end where it can't escape without knowing the future output (see my note).. That's what escapeCarriageReturnSafe tries to emulate. But without storing the cursor position it may not fully escape the last line since otherwise we would loose information.. This should be \"electron\": \"1.7.1\", otherwise we cannot start nteract because electron-builder builds against the wrong ABI.. Chai probably needs some extra care. Flow doesn't recognizes our transforms to be of type Transform.\nI tried to fix this by adding the missing MIMETYPE property in e02d843d49987cac3a03aab7665a4d67efd351c9 but unfortunately this doesn't fix the problem.\nI think it's the same problem that causes this error.\n. I though about using ES6 Maps here but decided it would be best to use objects since the kernels also send objects instead of Maps. This way we can get rid of one extra conversion/parsing step in commutable.. That's a good idea. I tried this, but couldn't satisfy flow.. I don't think we should prettify all the flow-type definitions.\nIn Hydrogen explicitly state the folders to prettify here and here.. It may be enough to remove only one of the folders. Is this still necessary since we now use dangerouslySetInnerHTML?. I just checked, this also works with the bundled app.. I'm pretty sure there's a better way to do this with webpack but I don't know one from the top of my mind :D. We could do this with webpack entry points but I don't know if we can define different targets/configs then. If they would share the same config I don't think we would gain a lot.. I think I should revert this change and add ijavascript to the externals in the webpack config. This ignores the quite big source maps.. I'm thinking about this again. Should we include the sourcemaps in our bundled app? @rgbkrk What do you think?. \ud83d\udc4d Happy to change that.. This should be in devDependencies instead. It doesn't hurt since it's only the top level package.json, but still \ud83d\ude09 . Is skipping here intentionally?. \ud83d\udc4d . Oops forgot about this comment \ud83d\ude04 . The auto-update didn't like @nteract/desktop. I'm sure it could be configured to work but renaming is the easiest solution.. electron-builder will use the version defined in the devDependencies.. I don't know if this is really necessary but I guess there could be problems otherwise.. Good point. It's the package inside the tree.\nWe could also remove this section and just manually bump the version number which is arguably easier. We don't need the desktop app published on npm anyway.. I'll check if it works with arbitrary names too.. I hope electron-builder has a nice error message. If not I can always wrap the publish script so it reminds you ;). No, electron builder will create the tag for us if it's not there.. Blindly copied this from the RxJS typescript defs. Could this break notebook-preview?. Is the code splitting into a vendor bundle even useful in the Electron context?. We could also import it in main.css if the css import in the @nteract/editor package breaks other stuff.. Should I just import it in the main.css style to be save?. Yep, otherwise it would inline everything. I can't find any mention of jsontableschema anywhere in the code so I think we're good to remove it.. > Yeah it makes it useful when working on the desktop app, because webpack only has to rebuild the source we're changing here (instead of Rx + React + everything else).\nRight now rimraf lib runs before build, so webpack doesn't cache it.. According to the electron docs, the about menu is only a macOS thing: https://electron.atom.io/docs/api/menu-item/#roles. When was this fixed?\nI remember https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues/597 and the issue on spawn-rx is still open.. The Cell import is now unnecessary, isn't it?. Want to bring over the tests to the @nteract/messaging?. Awesome thanks \ud83d\udcaf . We can now also remove normalize.css as a dependency from the desktop/package.json.. We could probably simplify our other mocks as well. \ud83d\udc4d . ~~I think the error came up when github didn't return a notebook. So I added the checks here.~~\nWhoops, that's unnecessary. :+1: let's fix this. E.g. this shows unnecessary $FlowFixMe's.. Yep. Yes, but this would mean changing a few package names. \ud83d\udc4dfor moving everything into the @nteract/ namespace.\nFo now this works well.. Flow failed in these files since ./ can't be resolved with the current setup.. Should we add a jest snapshot test here?. Since #2225 this should be\njson\n\"prepare\": \"npm run build\",\n\"prepublishOnly\": \"npm run build && npm run build:flow\",\n\"build\": \"npm run build:clean && npm run build:lib\",. I don't think we need those devDeps since we have them in the root of the repo.. Where is makeAppRecord coming from?\nIt's not imported above. On the other hand AppRecord wasn't imported above either.\n. Thanks for the explanation.\nI was just wondering about the import. It is used on line 20 but it's imported on line 27 (same as AppRecord before). I would expect flow or babel to fail here.. This uses the notebook component from core/src/components/index.js and not the provider\nEdit: Not relevant anymore since Kyle answered it already above.. These are coming mostly from the node-github, right?. Unfortunately this breaks github publishing since github@9 is incompatible with webpack: https://github.com/octokit/node-github/pull/593\nWe need to upgrade node-github for this to work and should move uuid and github to the devDependencies in desktop since it's now included twice in the packaged app.. Do we still need to ignore netrc,mime,https-proxy-agent,follow-redirects when github is bundled by webpack?\nWhy are we ignoring lodash?. Looks like we need to wait for babel 7 to support fragments: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/3356. Sorry, merged too fast. I should've read the whole issue.. Why do we prefetch both https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGcguWZHRC2HyBRS/giphy.gif and https://bit.ly/storybot-vdom?. \ud83d\udc4d . If the performance gain is noticeable, I'm good with removing this test.\n  . \ud83d\udc4d. Should we add <rootDir>/ in front of these, just to be sure?\nhttp://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#testpathignorepatterns-array-string. \ud83d\udc4d . Should we do the opposite and use collectCoverageFrom for more reliable coverage reports?. If it improves performance I'd say go for it.. Shouldn't we still return here?. What about the applications/ folder?\n  . Guessing from the CI logs, it's working fine. I guess you need to update the snapshot.. This is just for electron-builder to know what version to use for rebuilding native modules. We could also use the electronVersion key in the builder config, but then renovate wouldn't help us updating.. Yes, dist works fine. @rgbkrk Do you think we really need the onLoad and loader props? I think we can get away with only defining src for desktop and hydrogen.. This actually fixes a bug, when using connected-components outside the monorepo.. For the desktop this worked fine. I guess it'll work for Hydrogen as well then.. @rgbkrk  Is this what you had in mind for this TODO?. Switching mathjax-electron to CHTML would require a lot of tinkering (read: replacing all of mathjax-electron) since it's based on SVG rendering. Checkout https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/output.html for a comparison between the output formats. Is there a specific reason why you want to switch to TeX-MML-AM_CHTML?\nWhat's exactly missing. I remember closely following the jupyter setup when originally putting together the package.. Is there a reason why we need MML and AM support? Isn't TEX enough?\nThis way we could use the TEX-AMS-CHTML config, which may loads less javascript.. Cool, then I think our mathjax-electron setup is pretty close here. It renders with SVG elements, but we can handle this in future PRs.. I had a closer look at mathjax-electron and I think it's fine to keep it this way. Previous LaTeX issues we're mostly caused by our old Markdown parsing.\nI think we should move the discussion to the mathjax-electron repo: https://github.com/nteract/mathjax-electron/issues/30#issuecomment-428723578. This callback doesn't make much sense in our current setup, since mathjax-electron is configured to skip initial typeset after load.. Since flow is happy I assume we don't need to check existence of entry.header. We could build a real StateObservable here, but this does the job for now. Whoops, thanks. We need to change the npm cache folder since prebuild-install would fail with\nEPERM: operation not permitted, rename 'C:\\npm\\cache\\_prebuilds\\506537-zeromq-v5.0.0-node-v64-win32-x64.tar.gz.1948-53728ae7d9d52.tmp' -> 'C:\\npm\\cache\\_prebuilds\\506537-zeromq-v5.0.0-node-v64-win32-x64.tar.gz'\n@vijayma  Is there a better way to do this?. Can this be fixed by removing the ansi-to-react package from our .flowconfig?. Oh probably because it's still ignored then: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/.flowconfig#L21. > We would have to create some sort of stub for ansi-to-react if we didn't want flow to error, right?\nI don't think so, since we have a lot of packages in node_modules that don't have subs.. Shouldn't it be just tsc?  I don't see any tsc npm skript  here.. Do we really need this?  It should've been using babel-jest before anyway, right?. This should be already included in @babel/preset-typescript. I think we should stick to ^7.0.0 like we do on the other babel packages due to next.js. Why the switch to yarn inside npm skripts?. To be consistent we should move those to therootpackage.json. UsingActionObservables.ofwas mostly done to appease flow, everywhere else I tried to use the defaultofimported fromrxjs.. Oh yeah. Looks likeanserhas typings: https://github.com/IonicaBizau/anser/blob/master/lib/index.d.ts. This looks like you just installed it withnpmrather than copying it to from anotherpackage.json. We're requiring version\"immutable\": \"^4.0.0-rc.9\"instead of version 3. This needs to be changed in a few other places too.. These should all be dev dependencies since we're using webpack to bundle the app. Otherwise they would be included in the electron bundle two times. We're only requiring the ones we explicitly exclude from the webpack bundle as dependencies.. We're usingyarnto install our dependencies. Thus there should be nopackage-lock.jsonfiles in the repo.. Nice. Oh wow so many missing dependencies \ud83d\udc40 . This should be adevDependencysince it's required intestonly.. We're usingyarnto install our dependencies. Thus there should be nopackage-lock.jsonfiles in the repo.. We require^3.1.0every where else in the repo. It's better to keep the in sync.. We're usingyarnto install our dependencies. Thus there should be nopackage-lock.jsonfiles in the repo.. We're usingyarnto install our dependencies. Thus there should be nopackage-lock.jsonfiles in the repo.. Any reason why not using the [React.createRefAPI](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactcreateref)?. I guess this should beelRef: React.ElementRef<*>;to appease flow.. I think this can benefit from some cleanup. Instead of using a constructor:\n```js\nexport default class HTMLDisplay extends React.Component<Props> {\n  elRef: elRef: React.ElementRef<*>;\n  constructor(props: Props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.elRef = React.createRef();\n  }\n}\n ```\nThis can be simplified to:\n```js\nexport default class HTMLDisplay extends React.Component<Props> {\n  elRef: React.ElementRef<*> = React.createRef();\n}\n ```. Hmm, maybe it triggers because we're styling a component, instead of an DOM element \ud83e\udd14 . What happens when@nteract/examplesare bundled with webpack?. We could try out https://github.com/inxilpro/node-app-root-path here or rely onprocess.execPath` but this should work too \ud83d\udc4d . > I thought this opted it out.\nIt is. I just thought your path issues may resolve if it's still packed.... Why do we need tslint? We already use ESLINT and prettier, why the need for a second linter?\nI though usually tsc is used to do the typechecking: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Babel-Starter/blob/8c72057e6b74e1d3969a17be4e169621e0b991a7/package.json#L6-L10. > I believe having tslint gives us the ability to use prettier with typescript?\nPrettier has native support for typescript since version 1.4: https://prettier.io/blog/2017/06/03/1.4.0.html\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting to move away from babel in favor of the typescript compiler for building.\nI had a quick look at the official typescript babel starter example:\nThey're using babel to build, tsc --noEmit to typecheck, and tsc --emitDeclarationOnly to build the .d.ts type definitions.\nIt seams tslint needs quite a lot of configuration compared to using tsc. What are the benefits of using tslint for typechecking rather than the default typescript compiler?. > Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting to move away from babel in favor of the typescript compiler for building.\nThinking about this again, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to go full typescript for our packages later down the road, since our applications and docs all use babel through webpack anyway. Thus rapid prototyping without typechecking would still be possible, since babel just strips the types.. Sadly writing this with map->filter->map made flow fail again. Merge map works fine though. . We actually could switch to Observable<redux$Action> everywhere.. bindNodeCallback is now properly typed.. This should be \"nteractDesktop\": \"src/index.ts\", now. This will use the typescript compiler instead of babel and typecheck everything.. We don't need those anymore since we're using typescript to build the package.. Since @nteract/transforms isn't converted to typescript we need to allow implicit any.. Using the React.createRef API here may also help with properly typing this https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/3474/files#diff-4de70bc2c4e3ef16f6d02b74a92534dd. I think you can remove all of these scripts since we build the typescript packages from the root package.json. Since we rely on lodash in several places you could move this to the top level package.json.. I don't think we need a tsconfig in our application folder. To build the applications we use next.js/webpack which are configured via the webpack-configurator package to use the source .ts and .js files. . Our applications require the source files directly using webpack, we therefor don't need to execute the typescript build.. Do we really need to build all packages after install?. For webpack this is not the case. Webpack is configured to build the packages in our monorepo from source which allows us to hack on the applications or docs without a watching the tsc build.. > that's not correct. because the package.json's all point to a main file at lib/index.js and types at lib/index.d.ts -- webpack will look for those files and ignores the typescript in src.\nMaybe this behavior has changed in the last few days, I don't have time to verify this right now. But webpack should recognize the nteractDesktop key and prefer it over the main field. The same should be true for jest since we use a moduleMapping to enable it to read the source files. . I checked, it's not required anywhere.. It's implicitly used by @nteract/display-area but not directly required.. I think the build:packages:ci command can now be removed since, since build:all:ci handles everything.. ",

",
    "betatim": "loading and saving now work!\n. I think for pre-pre-pre-alpha it is too early to try and work out how to bundle a kernel, but maybe for pre-pre-alpha that would be cool. I did a bit of searching for this and got the feeling that it is impossible to bundle this directly with the electron app :cry: so we would need an installer.\n. :+1: for prepack-python3-kernel\n. Is this the issue about kernels being alive after quitting the app?\n. The process seems to keep running as well. Check pgrep -f \"python3 -m ipy\" after starting and quitting nteract a few times.\n. Pressing Cmd+q is wired directly to app.quit() without creating a KILL_KERNEL action or calling cleanupKernel().\nWe can add a send(focusedWindow, 'menu:kill-kernel') to the quit menu item, but then you need to delay calling app.quit() to give it a chance to do stuff. What is a good way of ipc()ing and waiting for that message to have been completed. Should we send a message back via ipc and then app.quit()?\n. Or https://source.unsplash.com\n\nwould make sure we keep the loading times minimal so people don't wander off because they got hungry.\n(This is actually a little less cool than it should be as it should be returning a random image each time)\n. > Oh, the link shows me a github URL. They're proxying image loads.\nJupp.com, :octocat: are sneaky like that. unsplash is probably the only image host in the world that wants you to hotlink ;)\n. With great power comes great responsibility! :dragon_face: \n. No worries, asking-questions-as-a-service could be the product I sell :sunglasses: \n. LGTM\n. Looks good to me, though hard to tell as a lot of lines have changed, but it started and ran stuff.\nCan you say a few words on the advantage/disadvantage of doing this?\n. Agree with @jdfreder that the witty names are cool but a bit tricky for newcomers. Could be solved by having something in the left hand column that uses plain language to walk you through the various parts and how they plug together so that you know the fancy names afterwards.\n. How do I use this in a nice way with babel and react? I made a codepen with react, babel and cosure and don't understand why I have to put my react rendering inside $(). My guess is that goog.require(...) only gets resolved/executed much later than the react component is first rendered. Naive question: why can't I just import it like other modules? Need more :mortar_board: :books: \n. Woah! +:100: \n. The other thing that would be cool is to delete that text as soon as someone double clicks (only to make it reappear if they didn't type anything)\n. Why the !==?\nthis.state.source !== '' ?\n                this.state.source :\n                `*Empty markdown cell, double click me to add content.*`\nvs\nthis.state.source ?\n                 this.state.source :\n                 `*Empty markdown cell, double click me to add content.*`\nDoes it make any difference in JS? I python I spend my time telling people to use if some_string :-/\n. I just came here to tell you how cool this is!\n. :spades: \n. :tada: \n. posting emoji is still way more fun than using reactions\n. :apple: one of your five a day\n. I spent a good few minutes clicking that play button the other day wondering if it should do raw -> rendered markdown.\n. For me the play button didn't go from raw -> rendered, which made me wonder if it should or not.\n. Having a button is probably a good idea. Not sure if it should have a different symbol as I can't think of one that really conveys \"rendering only\" without being totally abstract (but then I also have to think for a moment which one of the new cell buttons gives me a new code cell every time I use it ...)\n. Seems like working out how to actually focus a cell (bring it into view and place a cursor in it) is tricky I am :+1: for merging this and solving the hard problem later.\nCM: we could either contribute to react-code-mirror or be lazy and use JedWatson/react-codemirror which has a options prop that it passes along.\n. :surfer: \n. It really is gone, can't find it even with a :mag:! :grinning: \n. Merge first, substance later!\n. Switched to nvm and still no luck. Had several problems while npm install was running when it printed cb() not called as well as a sha verification failing. Those I put down to shaky internet. Successfully installed everything again but get same error when starting nteract.\n(this is more a note for myself than a question)\n. I never tracked down what caused this but it is fixed \"as if by magic\" now so closing.\n. @captainsafia the fonts moved to their own package, did you install that?\n. Don't merge yet, there is a left over action that should have been deleted\n. Ok, the mergeCellBefore is gone.\n. :shipit:'ing done. Merge at will.\n. \n. Ah, this answer my naive question of: where did you hide the magic of informing OSX that nteract is the new game in town for .ipynb.\n. \ud83d\udc8e \n. When launching nteract from the terminal with an active conda env I usually want to use that env. It would be good if that kernel ended up being the \"default\" in that situation.\nI don't know if it is worth it/faster to detect this and in that case not search for other envs and whether they have kernels.\n- active env -> look for kernels in that env and use them\n- no active env -> global search\nWDYT?\n. I used $CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV to decorate my prompt which has worked for a long time. Slightly confusing because the name makes you think it tells you about the default conda env, but in practice it tells you the currently active env.\n. actually, the merge button is green when coverage isn't done yet. :-/ slower merging in the future.\n. Yay!\n. #407 might be related or at least worth thinking about if they can be fixed in a similar way\n. Being able to pop-out a cell would be useful too. If the visualisation takes up a lot of screen space then it would be cool to have it in a separate window. Means you can see more than a few lines of the code that you are trying to edit.\n. sanitize: false is the default, and from what the docs say I'd expect that to do what we want it to do. \ud83d\ude15\nEven more weird is that if you look at the \"Elements\" tab in the inspector for nteract it shows you exactly what you typed, but for some reason doesn't actually render it as HTML. This is what made me wonder if someone in the chain does some kind of escaping?\n\nIt is really confusing to see what looks like valid HTML, but it does get rendered.\nIs this a bug in remark-react then? Not sure I can see how we are using it wrong or doing weird things that break it.\nDo you know what :octocat: uses? Seems like a common problem. Caja got mentioned before so \ud83d\udc4d.\n. \n. What was the thinking behind switching to MPL? Usually such choice are made with some reasoning behind them so we should check what that was.\nAs I understand it MPL does not stop you from selling a product based on nteract or even keeping your secret sauce secret. Doing the legal legwork seems like a small price to pay (both in terms of $$ and effort) in exchange for a high quality product like nteract. nteract receives support from two companies who have presumably found a way to give back under the current model and further their commercial goals. Another one supports the project by allowing staff to use work time.\nThe 0MQ guide (it is about the community) contains some reasoning behind why a license that allows remixing is a good choice.\nThe question of how to make your open-source community sustainable has been getting a lot of attention lately, and has been a struggle for a long time.\nGiven all this I think a more detailed motivation of why this change would make the community/project better is needed. If only to avoid the slight aftertaste of \"please make this easier to use in a commercial setting where we don't wish to contribute back\".\n. I agree with you that these are real issues for companies that do not wish or can not make their work available under a MPL compatible license. This is a difficult to navigate area for all of us who are trying to create software that uses open-source projects in a commercial setting. As a commercial entity with a business model that is incompatible with MPL like licenses it is in my interest to have work licensed under BSD.\n(Speaking purely for myself here) To make nteract sustainable I think nteract needs to work out what is in its long term interest and put those interests first. Anything else makes no sense. These interests might not overlap 100% with those of any other organisation or company. IMO the fastest way to reach a mutually beneficial position is to openly discuss the needs of each party and then make an informed decision.\nI would like to see some discussion and then conclusion on what nteract the community thinks is its long term goal and hence what is in its interest. Once this is clear it will be much easier for me to decide whether or not making this change to the license is a good move or not.\n. @rgbkrk made me do it \ud83d\ude2c \n\n. It already extends pure component?. :beers: . Added this to the wishlist and #963 is related.\nNot in a big hurry with this (and don't have the free brain cycles to spend on it myself). Just thought that linters are such a great thing, that we should have them for notebooks as well.. :art: . Wouldn't checking for CONDA_PREFIX in the environment take care of the NTERACT_SOURCE_FROM_ENV_AT_CLI=1? It is only set if you source activate some-env so if nteract is started by double clicking it won't be set. So I'd propose to only add this kernel spec if we detect/are convinced we are being started \"inside\" a conda environment. Should also work out what virtualenv does which is the other popular way of having virtual environments.. Some notes to (mainly) self: when launching the app by double click shellEnv gives me the following for PATH:\n/Users/thead/.nvm/versions/node/v5.11.0/bin:./bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/Users/thead/.dotfiles/bin:/Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-8.0/bin:/Users/thead/anaconda/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/Library/TeX/texbin:/node_modules/.bin:/Users/thead/git/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop/dist/mac/nteract.app/Contents/MacOS:/usr/texbin:/Users/thead/.rvm/bin\nThis is also what I get if I start a new terminal. So far so good.\nStart from terminal, shellEnv gives me:\n/Users/thead/.nvm/versions/node/v5.11.0/bin:./bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/Users/thead/.dotfiles/bin:/Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-8.0/bin:/Users/thead/anaconda/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/Library/TeX/texbin:/Users/thead/git/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop/node_modules/.bin:/Users/thead/git/nteract/nteract/packages/node_modules/.bin:/Users/thead/git/nteract/nteract/node_modules/.bin:/Users/thead/git/nteract/node_modules/.bin:/Users/thead/git/node_modules/.bin:/Users/thead/node_modules/.bin:/Users/node_modules/.bin:/node_modules/.bin:/Users/thead/git/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop/node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS:/Users/thead/.nvm/versions/node/v8.1.3/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/node-gyp-bin:/Users/thead/anaconda/envs/skopt/bin:./bin:/usr/local/sbin:/Users/thead/.dotfiles/bin:/Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-8.0/bin:/Users/thead/anaconda/bin:/usr/texbin:/Users/thead/.rvm/bin:/usr/texbin:/Users/thead/.rvm/bin\nthis somehow duplicates stuff. As a result the conda env path is towards the back and get's shadowed by the /usr/bin etc from the first set of paths.\nSo I (currently) think that all that needs to happen is to not use shellEnv when we detect that nteract was started from a terminal. If I by hand comment out the relevant bit in prepare-env.sh I indeed get a \"python 3\" kernel that matches my conda env. That is without the kernelspec hackery in this PR!. Checking if TERM is set is the best idea I have for detecting if we were launched from a terminal or not. Apparently you can also check if stdin is a file/tty??\nThe detection works for me on Mac. \ud83c\udf89. Waiting for travis, then good to go.. I got the following three values for process.argv: launch with npm run star: [ '/Users/thead/git/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop/node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron',\n  '.' ]\nlaunch with open packages/desktop/dist/mac/nteract.app:\n[ '/Users/thead/git/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop/dist/mac/nteract.app/Contents/MacOS/nteract' ]\nand when double clicking nteract.app from Finder:\n['/Users/thead/git/nteract/nteract/packages/desktop/dist/mac/nteract.app/Contents/MacOS/nteract' ]\nThe last two cases are the ones we'd want to tell apart, so sad panda.. Years of physics training make me be unhappy if the solution is too complex :p . Started looking into this. codemirror has https://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html#option_scrollbarStyle but setting it to \"native\" doesn't seem to do anything. Also tried https://codemirror.net/demo/simplescrollbars.html which puts scrollbars on each input area but I couldn't click on the input areas anymore to get text entered. Slowly random walking to a working solution \ud83d\uddfa .. Are you sure you didn't leave this on 1.25 speed when recording the GIF? \ud83d\ude01 This is super fast!. Nice!. LGTM. Related to #1920. \ud83d\udc4d for \"Language\" -> \"Runtime\". I think there should be a \"Restart&run all\" in that menu as well.. I'd be cool with togglable (per cell). And because I can't remember: do we currently soft wrap for mardkown cells?. + \ud83d\udcaf for softwrap in markdown cells :). This is too big for me to seriously review, but travis seems happy and coverage didn't go down that much so ... what could go wrong?. Why do you need the global.XMLHttpRequest = XMLHttpRequest;?. Now you are just horsing around .... I can't find any tests for the reducers, worth getting started now with adding one? A pointer to an example to copy would be good.. Could also add a second action, though you could argue that \"clear outputs\" always means \"remove the outputs and reset the exec counts\". At least as a user I'd expect that always to happen together.. LGTM, my comments are mostly for my education.. ~~add key press handler or~~ new PR?. Should we merge this then?. \ud83d\ude80 . LGTM, just to double check you tried 8.9 locally? I seem to still be on 8.1 which works nicely.. Should we close this in favour of #2124 ?. \ud83c\udf70 !. Prodded travis to see if the failure is random or not. Don't really see why this should be failing.. @yuvipanda \ud83d\udd04\ud83c\udfb8 (rebase) now that this is fixed, then we can merge this :)\nShould we setup building and pushing for releases?. > Seeing if the close and reopen works, since it should be testing the merge commit rather than as is.\nSmart!. \ud83c\udf89 . This has been built and pushed to dockerhub at least once: https://hub.docker.com/r/yuvipanda/play.nteract.io/. > It would be nice to have a travis group that only runs on tagged releases\nI had assumed you were  doing releases by tagging on GH and letting travis doing all the work.. Speculating here: which directory did you start nteract in? Is there a way for you to confirm that the current working directory of the kernel(?) is the one you think it is? In a python kernel I would run !pwd to check.. Just here to say: sweeet! This is looking nice. @lgeiger said we don't wait for appveyor .... Looks ugly but works!. Is there a post or something to read about pinning deps instead of what we have been doing so far?. One nitpick, otherwise LGTM. LGTM, merge?. Putting that time hanging around at airports to good use!. LGTM. I will stir my pasta sauce while travis does the testing, you can extend the comment now or make a mini PR, as you prefer.. My favourite kind of PR: deleting more code than it is adding!. Tests still pass so it must be correct :). What do we conclude from the fact that it did pass?. merges in return for eduction. I think this is what they call a win-win :). Merge?. This mostly brings in stuff that is already in use elsewhere (I think). So \ud83d\udc4d . Work on nteract as webapp is nteract-on-next. There is still a lot of work to be done though.. LGTM if the robots are happy too.\n(I for one welcome our new locking-priority-setting-testing overlords.) ;). Right now they get merged, and it looks weird ;)\n. Started with\nconst source = cellMap.get(id).get('source') + '\\n' + cellMap.get(nextId).get('source');\nbut eslint doesn't like that and recommend this backtick style. Means you can't indent L118 though as that whitespace becomes part of the variable's contents.\n. It gets clunky when you also want to clear the output of the cell you are keeping. Actually not sure if we should clear it or not ... right now I went for keeping the output as the code for clearing it looked ugly.\n. We merge no matter what the type, just like jupyter does.\n. jupyter keeps the output of the bottom cell. Not sure which one of the three options is best.\nI'll ponder it while \ud83d\ude34\n. I like this! Not just publish to gist but also update to gist!\n. True dat!. Double checking: You mean we should set the language to something else aka python_nteract?. for people from the future: what is the thinking behind switching from a notebook to having these two unpacked variables?. do you know if you really need CodeMirror-wrap as class? In my digging around yesterday I think I decided you don't want to hard this code (as well as removing something  in main.css:\n.CodeMirror pre {\n   padding: 0;\n-  white-space: pre;\n-  border: 0;\n-  border-radius: 0;\n }\nto get the lineWrapping option to have any effect.. Should have been clearer: lineWrapping is the name of the codemirror option to turn line wrapping on and off. So once we can pass options from the code and markdown cell parts down into code mirror we will be golden \ud83d\ude01 . Fixes half of #2040 !. Interesting that RxJS changes around XMLHTTPRequest.. why can't we keep the fat arrow?. this is a pattern to do \"promise where i don't care if you call resolve\"?. wrap something that doesn't return a promise so that you can await it?. executeRequest('print(\"hey\")', { 'silent': true }) (missing tick before print). For my education: why do we set this? I was expecting us to use this information to create a new/update a rx-binder observable.. Simple -> Edit?. do you ever get here with this.props.serverNotebook not being true?. where is this used later on?. could you extend this comment to explain when this happens? Is this the tab completer? That would be my guess. I can tell the cell source is being replaced from the code but not why or what with ;). Ha, guessed wrong :). What does this do? Not sure I've seen this notation before. renderPage is of type Function but renderPage is also of type hash with key renderPage ?. ah! I had forgotten about the unpacking via { keyHere }! Makes sense.. We contact mybinder.org from the server because SET_NOTEBOOK is executed there? And then again from the client where we also do SET_NOTEBOOK?. Maybe say \"... the last 90 days. Unfortunately we don't get around to dealing with every issue that is opened. Instead of leaving issues open we're...\".\nA pet peeve of mine is the \"Sorry for the late email reply...\", to which I think \"don't be sorry, just reply faster next time if you indeed put this off for no good reason or if you had a good reason then don't be sorry.\". Oups!. Remove me again. Tried to get the devtools installed/opened. This used to \"just work\" but now I think you'd also have to call the devtools from somewhere to make it work.. With or without this I don't seem to be able to receive any key events when you just single click on a markdown cell. Needed so that arrow up/down and \"return to open editor\" work.. ",

I'm \ud83d\udc4d  on whatever license changes Kyle's OK with. \nI'm opposed to classifying \"major\" \"minor\" and \"micro\" contributors by some arbitrary metrics. Furthermore, I'm strongly opposed to attaching \"vote needed,\" \"vote highly desirable,\" and \"vote desirable\" to those labels. \nA lot of people are pinged with this issue. And the majority of them are placed in the bucket of \"can weigh in but vote is not mandatory\" - I find that rather off-putting and anti-social.\nClassifying contributors as major and minor is an anti-pattern.  Anyone who's made a contribution should have their say. \n. \n. \n. I'm a registered member of the Green Party - does that count?\n. > Added the tag so you can get your free shirt.\nThere are shirts?!\n. Good idea, @jdetle ! The idea here is to be able to created named display outputs which can be updated later using that name... We will add some tests, and the longer explanation is in https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_client/issues/209 with a jupyter notebook implementation in  https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1879 .\n. @rgbkrk is updating the summary to be more informative.\n. Ok, I committed my explanatory notebook, but there's a problem with the updating HTML displays. Run through the example notebook (now in the menu list) to see what I mean.\n. I actually had a similar question: should we have the ProgressBar class handle the updates right out of the gate, or should we have another example, so that they all build on each other.\nI was thinking of doing it with @property  and calling update in the @property.setter - because at least properties come with the language, so if a user's never seen them before, they are being exposed to a core feature in the language.\n. cool, I'll add on to the end. \nUnrelated to this - but are you seeing the JSON key-order churn in our git history? Is this something we can (or want to) handle in commutable to keep diffs down to a minimum in the future?\n. Ok, I added a progress bar that calls update whenever its progress is modified:\n``` python\nclass AutoupdatingProgressBar(ProgressBar):\n    @property\n    def progress(self):\n        return self._progress\n@progress.setter\ndef progress(self, value):\n    self._progress = value\n    self.update()\n\n```\nThe horse race at the end now uses this version, so doesn't have to keep calling update.\n. Merging, thank you!\n. Thank you, this is lovely! \ud83c\udf70 \n. Thanks for this @thomasballinger ! It looks like flow is unhappy with this change set:\nsrc/notebook/components/notebook.js:54\n 54:   transient: ImmutableMap,\n                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ImmutableMap. Application of polymorphic type needs \n<list of 2 arguments>. (Can use `*` for inferrable ones)\nYou can run npm run flow locally to work through this and get it to pass.. Sweet, thanks @thomasballinger \ud83c\udf70 !. rebased, for starters.. Tests pass for me locally, let's see what our CI pals have to say about it.. Oh, I think it's because I ran lerna locally, which CI doesn't yet know about. Let me add that.. I think the flow errors we're seeing are similar to some of the issues reported on this thread: https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/issues/203 but I have not followed it all to figure out how to get around it.. I don't really know how flow works, but might it have something to do with the fact that we have 3 copies / version of immutable.js? \n$ find . -name immutable.js.flow\n./node_modules/immutable/dist/immutable.js.flow\n./packages/commutable/node_modules/immutable/dist/immutable.js.flow\n./packages/transforms/node_modules/immutable/dist/immutable.js.flow\nso the lerna-ed packages reference their own, but the main app references its own, and flow doesn't understand that they're the same?. For what it's worth, I get the same flow error on master. :. Ok, so here's how the errors can be eliminated: lerna bootstrap --hoist immutable... - This will not put immutable in the packages/*/node_modules, but only in the top level node_modules. \nexcept I think there's a bug in lerna, because running that with the --hoist immutable flag it just hangs there... \nsymlinking the root node_modules/immutable to the packages/commutable/node_modules/immutable also fixes the flow stuff. As does removing the latter after a lerna bootstrap by hand.. we upgraded to .37 which fixed --hoist! woot!. I noticed this behavior and find it \ud83d\udc4e for executing through narrative notebooks. \nAs @dhirschfeld mentioned, a dual mode would help with this, but I'm aware that I'm speaking as a dual-mode junky.. Is this a dupe of #1444. I'll be working on the dev-docs more tomorrow, but thought I'd slip this in to get a commit before the wedding.. \"not on\" you mean \"now on\"?. is this like :hammer: :clock1130: \n. yeap, I opened #1436 so we remember to do it in case lerna release gets held up..

The JSX transpiler is the babel transpiler (its on by default) so there isn't a clear advantage to the separation. \n. This is great. That logic doesn't necessarily belong in the component. That said, it also doesn't necessarily belong in the action. I recently did something like this on a react native app, where I abstracted service calls to an API module. See below:\n```\nimport Services from \"../services\";\nimport * as constants from \"../constants\";\nimport config from \"../../config/development\";\nexport const API = new Services(config.services);\n```\nThe idea here being, the API (or our channels), can be instantiated and exported right from the actions file. That way we get:\n- An abstraction to handle non-actiony logic\n- A testable service (or channels) layer\n- Access to the service (channel) layer right from actions.\n.

I used to include it in preview-inline with a fallback to MathJax, but I found that when you are running locally it doesn't actually make much difference on speed and you end up with the extra complexity of two math rendering libraries\n. @captainsafia FYI the spinning cube on the homepage is buggy in Firefox (FF45, OSX 10.11, MBP nvidia) \n.

Python support is already good, not sure what would need to happen for IPython...  https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/446\n. The JupyterLab currently uses the 'vanilla' jupyter notebook. The thinking here is that through the effort of making nteracts notebook compatible with JupyterLab, this could help avoid a divergence between the two notebooks and surface issues in their respective APIs. This is particularly relevant to notebook extensions and JS widgets such as plotting tools (plotly, bokeh). Additionally, it might simply be nice to use nteract everywhere - it does benefit from a much more modern architecture than the Jupyter notebook for example.\n. ",

I don't know enough about the nteract codebase, but one of the reason the tooltip was implemented outside of the cells in notebook was to be able to bleed outside of CP instance. \nWe may be able to pop-out of clipped overflow: https://css-tricks.com/popping-hidden-overflow/ but I haven't really digged into that. .

Just out of information here is the current  behavior of classic notebook\n - first press of shift-tab: show tooltip with a limited height ~10 lines, \n - second press : expand it and make it scrollable. (similar to clicking the + button)\n - third press: make it sticky (typing won't dismiss for 10sec, show a clock icon)\n - 4th press, send to pager and dismiss.\n\nIt's really rare to see people knowing about these behavior, and I definitely did a bad job of communicating this and having the UI for it.

How do I fix the tests, codemirror either expect a list of string, or a list of object that have callbacks.\nHow to I expect() something which is not json ? Do I drop the callbacks manually? can I expect a either/or ?. Also I just got IPython to show the function signature as well, I'm going to think about how to show that in the completer as well. What do you think? just push it in the displayed text ?\n\nYou can do checks on individual elements instead of the whole object.\n\nDuh. Yes, you are right. . Travis is happy, it work on ipykernel master. . Oops, commit -a I guess, after an git add -p :-P \n. or notebooks.map(resolve).forEach(launchFilename); ?\n. Ok, i'll do that. I'm looking on how to write a generic codemirror hinter, especially using es6, and promises. CodeMirror seem to still use callback, and  does not use Promises anywhere, so might want to wrap the hinter a bit, as my guess is the author want to keep things compatible with old browsers without shims. \n. You will need a way to \"publish to new gist\" or actually show \"update gist\" otherwise if you copy a notebook, you will have no way to distinguish the original from a copy and always clobber. \n. so here I watch for all messages, I never see a complete-reply.\n.

Make sens, that was roughly what I was thinking.

For example, on my system, I currently have two kernels installed (Python3 and Python2):\n$ jupyter kernelspec list\nAvailable kernels:\n  python3    /anaconda3/share/jupyter/kernels/python3\n  python2    /usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/python2\nFinding your python versions\nUnrelated to the kernels, I can find where I have Python installed by using the which command:\n```\ncarol at cw-pro in ~\n$ which python3\n/anaconda3/bin/python3\ncarol at cw-pro in ~\n$ which python2\n/usr/local/bin/python2\ncarol at cw-pro in ~\n$ which python\n/anaconda3/bin/python\n``\nMy system has the/anaconda3/bin/pythonsymlinked (i.e. aliased) to/anaconda3/bin/python3`.\nUnderstanding the nteract recommendation\nThe pattern that nteract recommends is a one that follows the Python Packaging good practice.\nLooking at the recommendation that nteract gives:\npython -m pip install ipykernel\npython -m ipykernel install --user\nIn the case of my system, the command python -m pip install ipykernel would be the same as if I typed /anaconda3/bin/python -m pip install ipykernel. When the command executes python, it aliases to /anaconda3/bin/python3. By using python -m pip, you are essentially telling the system to use the version of pip installed with the particular version of Python that which python returns.\nFor example, python2 -m pip install ipykernel would use /usr/local/bin/python2 to execute pip to install the kernel.\nSo to recap up to this point, there are different Python versions on my computer. I can find them with the which command. python -m, python2 -m and python3 -m are shortcuts to the different Pythons that are displayed when entering the which command.\nHope this helps a bit.\n  . Thanks @lukejanicke. Feel free to follow up with questions as well. The details of this stuff is confusing :-). Welcome Michelle :sunflower:\nI'm looking forward to working with you.. :heart:. Ooh...fancy. Off today and tomorrow but will check back on stuff :sunny:. @mpacer Given how big this PR is, let's merge and then refine the readme since the travis rebuild will be less on just the doc. \ud83d\udc4d . Absolutely, @mpacer! Let's wordsmith in a new PR after this merges :cake:. Now that enchannel is in the monorepo. Any additional changes here?. Makes sense to me.. Some additional suggestions:\nAs a container component, Pagers manage a collection of the cell's pagers.  A pager is used to provide, but not modify, additional information. Common uses include introspection with ? and ?? and help text for commands. For example, you might use a pager to display the output of a cell magic. \nA cell may have an Outputs component and a Pagers component. Outputs typically contain calculation results or actions on a cell, and Pagers hold information, like help text, found from introspecting a cell.. Looks like an extra space between Pagers and component. \n...that determines if a Pager component should be rendered.. Perhaps \"...used to render data returned by the kernel. The returned data may be in a number of output formats. Similar...the media type of the returned data...\". ...components needed for each output type.. Errors returned from the connected Jupyter kernel can be rendered.. containing. Is there a reason that the version is different here and in package.json at root?. Thanks @captainsafia for the explanation.. One small request for change:\nCan we reorder to the original order instead of alphabetical? The original order kept the four ports needed for the 0MQ communication protocol together making a bit easier to scan if all four are returned.. Ultimately, no. For now, they are causing an error.. Figured we can open issues re: clean up for the 3 files that have skips. vcore? Is this the percentage of CPU used including all cores. PPID?. local time?. demultiline and remultiline? Is this a toggle? Just curious.. Do we need to specify the return type is readonly?. Super nitpicky comment since this short circuits on the &&\nFind the first media type in the output data that we support with a handler. types for TypeScript? or something else?. mimetype or media type. See prior comment. Might be clearer to pull all the comments out for the function and make it a comment of the function.. That makes sense. Maybe unpackMultiline packMultiline?\n. More like a docstring instead of individual comments of the code. The comments sort of distract from what is happening in the code\n. help='The application name. Default: 'nteract'.

    "minrk": "@rgbkrk https://github.com/minrk/migrate-issues doesn't move, but it copies.\n. the output order is based on message order, which corresponds (in IPython) to the order of flush calls. If there's pending output still waiting when a cell finishes, IPython calls:\npython\nsys.stdout.flush()\nsys.stderr.flush()\nIf you call flush yourself, you can influence the order:\n\nipykernel 4.3 flushes asynchronously, so you will get some time-sensitive ordering if there's enough time between writes:\n\nWhich also demonstrates that we don't merge the streams, so there's a newline on every switch because we put each stdout/stderr switch in divs. This is not an accurate representation of stream output in a terminal, so if you wanted to do a better job, you could do something with spans for the switch instead of divs. Alternately, you could completely ignore the difference between stdout and stderr, which is what a terminal does.\n. > that diverges from the notebook format\nThere's two things here:\n1. does running the notebook in nteract produce the exact same notebook as the existing notebook app\n2. does it produce a valid notebook\nI think it is okay to diverge from the existing notebook implementation on some things like this. For instance, the current notebook chooses to merge consecutive stream outputs (from the same stream), but not doing so is perfectly valid, and indeed we made this change in the notebook for performance reasons without changing the notebook format.\nIn nteract, you could provide merged rendering of stream output by either\n1. matching the collation behavior of the existing notebook in the data structure, just merge them for rendering, or\n2. actually discarding stderr information, and turn the notebook into purely stdout, matching the primitive behavior of terminals.\nMy first inclination is toward (1), but if you want to get rigorous terminal-emulation of things like carriage returns (Jupyter's implementation does not behave identically to a terminal), you can't treat them separately at all.\n. It would also be cool if you could implement appending output in a way that doesn't require reprocessing the previous output in order to get the state to be correct. In the current notebook, producing stdout with many messages is an $O(n^2/2)$ operation because it has to append the new message, then redisplay the entire stream. I just don't know how to track the terminal state well enough to do that.\n. This is awesome.\n. nteract doesn't include non-installed kernelspecs. Jupyter special-cases the IPython kernelspec if it hasn't been installed, but nteract chooses (rightly, I think) to not do this. To install the IPython kernelspec, do:\nipython kernel install\nIf you want to specifically install it in the env, like xonsh has done, specify the prefix:\nipython kernel install --prefix=/home/parleur/anaconda3\n. If you install ipykernel from conda-forge, this will already be done.\n. Trust mechanics should only be relevant if the loaded output can execute code. Merely displaying a file shouldn't be an issue unless it's in a manner where it might be able to execute javascript. Showing the user their own private ssh keys isn't an issue unless there's js on the page where the notebook author could send that content to themselves, execute kernel code, etc.\n. Depending how many repos you want to set this in, there is a team config you can edit to set defaults at the org level.\nI learned this yesterday when trying to disable the comments that they suddenly enabled on all repos.\n. \ud83d\udc4d from me for BSD/MIT. I don't think the share-alike license clause makes much sense to be included in C4, so I would support any fork of C4 that removes the license clause altogether, or loosens it to allow any open source license.\n. New notebooks with a specific kernel from the menu get the right info.\n. You could separate the 'automatically discovered kernels from conda' as a distinct list (sub or sibling), so it looks something like:\n- Kernels (+)\n  - Python 3\n  - Julia\n  - conda envs (+)\n  - virtualenvs (+)\nThat way, any auto-discovered kernels are only visible on request, and clearly distinct from properly registered kernels.\n. Re: timing issue, you could cache the value keyed by the request msg_id and use that for transforming the value back. It might also be worthwhile to just dismiss completions if input changed since completion was requested, even excluding the potential (unlikely) surrogate measurement issue.\nI'm not sure how often import m<tab>atpl<completion arrives with matplotlib> happens or how well you handle it..

    "gnestor": "@estevanjantsk Let me know if I can help with this one \ud83d\udc4d \n. @estevanjantsk Thanks for working on this. However, it's not working as expected for me because getPath is resolving URLs to the nteract root (__dirname, '..', '..',) but it should be resolving URLs to the notebook directory. In my case, the notebook I'm using is located at /Users/grant/Sites/jupyter/ipywidgets/docs/source/examples and the link in it is Using%20Interact.ipynb (or ./Using%20Interact.ipynb). These links should resolve to /Users/grant/Sites/jupyter/ipywidgets/docs/source/examples/Using%20Interact.ipynb but instead are resolving to /Users/grant/Sites/jupyter/nteract/Using%20Interact.ipynb. \nThe question is: Does deferURL have access to the path of the \"sender\" notebook? If so, then getPath could look like path.resolve(path.dirname(SENDER_NOTEBOOK_URL), url). Using path.resolve vs. path.join will handle absolute URLs appropriately. \n. @rgbkrk Do you have any insights about how to get the CWD of the notebook vs. nteract?. Hmm, so is it possible to access this path from markdown-cell.js for example? The bug here is that clicking a relative link to another notebook inside a markdown cell will open a new nteract window but the url of the notebook is relative to the nteract static directory, not the original notebook's directory.. I like your <base> idea better, but I got it working for markdown cells.. Ya I get this for both the \"new\" notebook and the intro.ipynb. I'm running Node 6.3.\n. I wiped node_modules and installed from scratch and the error is gone! @captainsafia Thanks for looking into this...\n. @jdetle Commonmark returns a NodeWalker that would allow us to transform specific nodes before rendering. An example implementation for this specific use case:\n``` js\nconst CommonMark = require('commonmark');\nconst parser = new CommonMark.Parser();\nconst renderer = new MarkdownRenderer();\nconst mdRender = input => {\n  const parsed = parser.parse(input);\n  const walker = parsed.walker();\n  let event;\n  while ((event = walker.next())) {\n    const { node } = event;\n    if (event.entering && node.type === 'link') {\n      node.destination = encodeURI(node.destination);\n    }\n  }\n  return renderer.render(parsed);\n};\n```\n@rgbkrk I think this might work because Commonmark parses a link's destination and title, so transforming the destination shouldn't affect the title.\n. Well, one problem: Commonmark is typing these links with spaces as \"text\" and not \"link\", and it's splitting them up into multiple nodes vs. one text node.\n. @rgbkrk Does it make sense to add this feature to ansi-to-react?\n. I was looking at the anser library used in ansi-to-react and there is a linkify method which would require we use its ansiToHtml method vs. ansiToJson and then dangerouslySetInnerHTML. \n. True. What if we just rolled our own?\njs\nfunction inlineBundleToReact(bundle, key) {\n  // Very rough, use a URL regex and assuming that `anser.ansiToJson` parses URLs into separate items\n  if (bundle.content.includes('http') return React.createElement('a', {\n    href: bundle.content,\n    style: bundle.style,\n    key,\n  }, bundle.content);\n  return React.createElement('span', {\n    style: bundle.style,\n    key,\n  }, bundle.content);\n}\nWould we be able to display this in untrusted notebooks?\n. So how about we modify inlineBundleToReact so that it returns an  if the content is a URL and a  if not?\n. Ok, should it live in inlineBundleToReact? And should it just parse words and render them as an <a> if they match an URL regex pattern?. I tried out the GeoJSON example notebook and I'm getting the following error:\n\nIs this related or should I open a new issue?. I'm running master and still seeing this. Switching to \"Light\" or \"Dark\" themes fixes it.. I'm going to re-open this to address the original issue which is configuring the strategy for fetching map tiles.. @rgbkrk \ud83d\ude2e. @rgbkrk I think this could be really useful if a path property were provided that would accept a module path or if a require property that would accept a require path. This would allow users to render data using any React component vs. just standard DOM elements. \nImagine a React display method like:\npython\nfrom ipython.display import React\nReact('react-json-tree', {\n  'data': {\n    'foo': 'bar'\n  }\n})\nI implemented a \"React transform\" for magic console that accepts a path (path to module) property, hot reloads the component when the source changes, and evaluates props so that callbacks/functions can be passed as a prop. You can see the implementation here: https://github.com/gnestor/magic-console/blob/master/plugins/ReactComponent.js\n. I was reading about Carbide:\n\nOriginally, we had written our own tiny implementation of NPM which would run in the browser (calling the official NPM API endpoint, locating tarballs, unpacking them in the browser, and loading the files appropriately).\nBut over the past few months we discovered SystemJS, and ended up using JSPM to handle just about everything. In fact, nowadays Carbide's \"Current Window\" mode uses the same SystemJS loader for both the editor itself and the code which gets executed on it. This means that it'll technically be able to self-host, hot-reload, and instrument various parts of itself. That's kinda neat.\n\nI haven't been able to get SystemJS/jspm to dynamically import an npm module from within the browser (e.g. in a Jupyter notebook) yet, but if that's possible like they're implying it is, then we could potentially expose a module property and the value would be an npm module name!\nRegarding callbacks, ideally you would define a callback in the native language (e.g. Python) so that the kernel can respond to events in React. I really have no idea how to implement that but I think jupyter-react may have figured it out. jupyter-react involves:\n1. A notebook extension for initializing/registering React component(s) on the front-end\n2. Python classes for each React component to handle comm with its component on the front-end\n3. webpack for building the JS\nSo it's a lot of work to get just render some data in a React component. However, I imagine that:\n1. display_id could be used to send comm messages from kernel to front-end\n2. The display method could handle comm message from front-end to kernel\n3. Maybe SystemJS could allow React components to be imported from npm in the browser (no webpack necessary)\nThe dream:\npython\nfrom ipython.display import React\nquery = ''\ndef handleChange(event):\n  # how to serialize `event` for JS -> Python?\n  query = event.target.value\n  data = search(query)\nReact('input', {\n  'placeholder': 'query',\n  # `handleChange` becomes a JS function that sends a comm message requesting that `handleChange` be called with `event` arg\n  'onChange': handleChange\n})\n. Ok, let's see if I'm understanding everything:\nThe synchronized object spec describes a general way to synchronize state between front-end and kernel. When implemented, this will effectively make the core of ipywidgets much more accessible to other widgets (because ipywidgets is a beast and it only works with the ipython kernel). React components fit nicely into this picture because there are so many of them and they can easily be represented using JSON. Assuming that we can simply take an npm module name and dynamically import a React component instance into the front-end, then users of any kernel (that implements this sync object spec) could visualize AND interact with data using any React component available by doing something like:\n``` py\nIn[1]\nfrom display_lib import React\ndata=[]\ndef handleChange(event):\n  data = get_data(event.target.value)\nReact('input', {\n  'onChange': handleChange\n})\nIn[2]\nReact('react-json-tree', {\n  'data': data\n})\n```\n. Update: I got dynamic imports of npm modules working in a lab/notebook extension!\n\nTo clarify, the extension is actually fetching the npm module in the browser, so now you can render data in a Jupyter notebook using any React component on npm with only the name and valid props. The really interesting things are:\n\nRendering data is no longer dependent on the client or client extensions (meaning that users need not install an extension in order to render a specific type of data)\nReact components can be rendered as static markup (nbviewer)\nBeyond the scope of this conversation, I see a big opportunity with inferring JSON schema from arbitrary data + querying React components that can render that schema = inferring visualization from arbitrary data.\n\nThe catches are:\n\nReact version conflicts: https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/issues/1511\nReact components that rely on CSS styles (vs. inline styles)\n\nIt's using SystemJS to do the imports. The gist of the implementation is:\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nfunction render({ type, props }, node) {\n  System.import(type).then(type => {\n    ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(type, props, null), node);\n  });\n}\n```\nThe usage inside the notebook looks like this:\n```py\nfrom IPython.display import display\ndef React(type, props):\n    bundle = {\n        'application/vnd.react.v1+json': {\n            'type': type,\n            'props': props\n        },\n        'application/json': props,\n        'text/plain': ''\n    }\n    display(bundle, raw=True)\nReact('react-json-tree', {\n    'data': [\n        {'month': 'September', 'profit': 35000, 'loss': 2000},\n        {'month': 'October', 'profit': 42000, 'loss': 8000},\n        {'month': 'November', 'profit': 55000, 'loss': 5000}\n    ],\n    'theme': 'google'\n})\n```\n..or if you want to use a non-default member of an import:\npy\nReact({\n    'module': 'victory',\n    'member': 'VictoryBar'\n}, {\n    'data': [\n        {'month': 'September', 'profit': 35000, 'loss': 2000},\n        {'month': 'October', 'profit': 42000, 'loss': 8000},\n        {'month': 'November', 'profit': 55000, 'loss': 5000}\n    ],\n    'x': 'month',\n    'y': 'profit'\n}). > Beyond the scope of this conversation, I see a big opportunity with inferring JSON schema from arbitrary data + querying React components that can render that schema = inferring visualization from arbitrary data.\n\n[x] Inferring JSON schema from arbitrary data\nhttp://jsonschema.net/#/\nnpm: https://github.com/krg7880/json-schema-generator\n[ ] Querying React component that can render a schema\nTypescript to JSON schema: https://github.com/lbovet/typson\nFlow aliases to JSON schema?

I spoke to @ellisonbg about this earlier today!!\n. @rgbkrk Nice! A couple things:\n\nCould you create a todo list in this issue so I can track what you've done and what you're working on? I'd like to help but I don't want to overlap.\nWhy not use the FixedDataTable component?\nI updated the mimerender extensions today to provide their own display method, which would allow something like: \n\npy\nfrom jupyterlab_table import Table\nTable(df)\nSee jupyterlab_plotly for a reference implementation: https://github.com/gnestor/jupyterlab_plotly#usage\nI'd appreciate your feedback regarding this approach and I'd like to explore how our mimerender efforts can be better combined. For example, is it possible to register new transforms/mimetypes that are not bundled with nteract? If so, it would be nice if these mimerender extensions could also support nteract since they already support notebook and lab. I see some discussion at https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/670 and https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/481.. I tried this out! Nice! Streets is super nice. So jupyterlab_geojson is currently using OSM. Is it merely a matter of style preference or is there good reason to go with Mapbox?. Streets theme is nice though...\n\n. I was thinking along the same lines. Brian and I are thinking through the VegaLite display class as it involves both a spec and data, so similarly GeoJSON could accept an optional spec or options for configuring tilelayer, etc.. What I meant was that GeoJSON could accept additional arguments:\npy\nGeoJSON(data, options={\"theme\": \"streets\"})\nLike the existing VegaLite display method:\npy\nVegaLite(spec={\n  \"mark\": \"point\",\n  \"encoding\": {\n    \"y\": {\"type\": \"quantitative\",\"field\": \"Acceleration\"},\n    \"x\": {\"type\": \"quantitative\",\"field\": \"Horsepower\"}\n  }\n}, df). Sounds good to me! I'm going to chime in on the ipython PR.... > This component is supposed to be a presentational component and as such should not have access to context\nI get that, but why does MarkdownCell and others define contextTypes then? \n\nI'd like to solve this either with the \n\nThis is ideal.. Ok I see. Props-only approach is vastly superior \ud83d\udc4d . It looks like the default max rows is set to 59, so users will need to set pd.options.display.max_rows in addition to pd.options.display.html.table_schema = True.... I updated the MultiGrid but I'm having issue testing it in nteract... kernel is hanging. I might need to git clean -xfd and rebuild.. Ok, it's working now! I did my best to work with the existing styles but it's hacky because there are no row or column divs, just cell divs, so it's a mix of class names and inline styles. The VirtualizedTable will be much more straight-forward to style. I will save that for tomorrow...\nThe CellMeasurer doesn't work perfectly as you can see, and the ScrollSync performance leaves a lot to be desired, so maybe react-virtualized is not the best option. \n. Ya, we could try it without CellMeasurer.... @rgbkrk Good suggestion but ScrollSync is still pretty sluggish. I'll try removing CellMeasurer just to see.... ScrollSync perf is much better after removing CellMeasurer (which didn't really work anyway) \ud83d\udc4d\nI think we can implement our own cell measurer algorithm to determine the ideal column width for each column.. > * [ ] Figure out something better with height\nWe can dynamically set the height based on row height, number of rows, etc.. > I think we can implement our own cell measurer algorithm to determine the ideal column width for each column.\nDone!\n. Can we pass the height as a prop to DataResourceTransform?. Ok, so we need an expanded prop and we need to decide upon sensible heights for expanded and collapsed. I think the notebook's collapsed height 336. Expanded height probably shouldn't be full height because then the user can't see the source at the same time? Or maybe that's the whole point of collapsed?\nRegarding window size, we can listen to window resize events from the component, but I assume that most transforms will also want to know about the window size, so it might make more sense to listen at the top and pass it down as props to transforms.. @lgeiger Thanks! I just cleaned up that file and some comments. I'm going to leave the commented-out props in there for now as they sort of document the react-virtualized API. Once this transform is solid, we can remove.... As long as it passes! \ud83d\udc4d . The React components no longer depend on react-virtualized/styles.css and I just pushed some logic for handling expanded/collapsed output areas.. I'll submit a PR to enable this. It's already been done in jupyterlab_geojson: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab_geojson/blob/master/component/index.js#L25-L29\nThe usage with ipython 6:\n```py\nfrom IPython.display import GeoJSON\nGeoJSON(data={\n    \"type\": \"Feature\",\n    \"geometry\": {\n        \"type\": \"Point\",\n        \"coordinates\": [-81.327, 296.038]\n    }\n}, \nurl_template=\"http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/whereonmars.cartodb.net/{basemap_id}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\", \nlayer_options={\n    \"basemap_id\": \"celestia_mars-shaded-16k_global\",\n    \"attribution\" : \"Celestia/praesepe\",\n    \"minZoom\" : 0,\n    \"maxZoom\" : 18,\n})\n```\nAnd the result: no more 401 errors and you can map coordinates on Mars!!\n. @rgbkrk Can you renew the mapbox access token?. No more luma-based theme \ud83d\ude22\ufe0f. I think this is ready to merge!. react-json-tree has the hideRoot prop which will hide the \"root\" label.\nAdditionally, you can try passing a keyPath prop with a custom name to see if that works.... Sorry for chiming in late here, but I've been using these for the past week or so and I'm so happy \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\nShould we include the React Component(s) that use this host cache and return a host?\n\nI think it's good to include this in the Host component because it reduces work on binder's end, right? \nMy use case: giving code blocks in a markdown editor access to a Jupyter kernel so that they can run code, display output, etc.\nFor my use case, I ended up refactoring this so that they aren't components anymore, just a single function that can get a kernel for a repo/kernelName:\n```js\n// ./binder.js\nimport { kernels } from 'rx-jupyter';\nimport { LocalHostStorage } from './storage.js';\nfunction getHost(\n    options: BinderOptions = {\n        repo: 'nteract/vdom',\n        ref: 'master',\n        binderURL: 'https://mybinder.org'\n    }\n): Promise {\n    const localHostStorage = new LocalHostStorage();\n    return localHostStorage.allocate(options);\n}\nfunction getKernel(options: KernelOptions): Observable {\n    const { host, kernelName } = options;\n    return kernels\n        .start(host, kernelName, '/')\n        .toPromise()\n        .then(xhr => {\n            return {\n                ...xhr.response,\n                channels: kernels.connect(host, xhr.response.id),\n                last_activity: new Date(xhr.response.last_activity)\n            };\n        });\n}\nexport async function getBinder(repo: string = 'nteract/vdom', kernelName: string = 'python'): Promise<?Binder> {\n    const host = await getHost({\n        repo,\n        ref: 'master',\n        binderURL: 'https://mybinder.org'\n    });\n    const kernel = await getKernel({ kernelName, host });\n    return { host, kernel };\n}\n```\nThen, in the doc (above the code blocks) I create binder instance(s):\n```jsx\nimport { getBinder } from './binder';\nconst binder = getBinder();\n```\nThe binder instance is passed to a Session that provides an interface to a kernel connection:\n```jsx\nimport * as messaging from '@nteract/messaging';\nexport default class Session extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    messages: []\n  };\ncomponentDidMount() => {\n    this.subscription = this.props.kernel.channels.subscribe(handleMessage});\n  };\nhandleMessage = (msg: JupyterMessage) => {\n    this.setState({ messages: [...this.state.messages, msg] });\n  }\nexecuteRequest = (source: string): Promise => {\n    this.props.kernel.channels.next(messaging.executeRequest(source));\n  };\nrender() {\n    const { messages } = this.state;\n    return (\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n```\nFinally, messages and executeRequest are passed to a CodeBlock. With that, CodeBlock can consume message to derive output and kernel state and send messages to affect state.\nThe HOC interface could work similarly:\njs\nwithSession(CodeBlock);\nThe only thing that I don't like about HOCs is that they hide where props come from, whereas the context API makes it very visible (arguably too visible at times). After playing with this for a couple weeks, I think that an ideal interface would be:\njsx\n<SessionProvider repo=\"nteract/vdom\" kernelName=\"python\">\n  <Doc />\n<SessionProvider>\nThen, anywhere inside the doc (as there may be several Python code blocks that should share the same session/kernel):\njsx\n<SessionConsumer>\n  {session => <CodeBlock session={session} />}\n<SessionConsumer>\nIn conclusion: For my use case, Session -> CodeBlock is a better abstraction than Host -> Kernel -> CodeBlock because all CodeBlock needs is to be able to run code and display output. . I tried this branch and it works! It's great to see one of these binder component land in the style guide. This looks good. We can always add higher-level components later that maybe only pass derived state like output and kernelStatus and callbacks like execute.. Is it easy to publish a new release for just @nteract/transform-geojson?. Ya, I couldn't figure out how to access it otherwise. Your <base> idea sounds better if I understand it correctly: it's a component that has access to cwd among other things and it passes it down to other components via props.. Ohhhh! Ya, that's perfect except that it messes up relative URLs to nteract assets \ud83e\udd14 . I just pushed another commit that breaks the context stuff out into a Base component. I did this yesterday before I realized that <base> is an HTML element, so for what it's worth.... Just pushed a commit to fix that \ud83d\udc4d. Well, easier to read but take up more space.... I can't figure out a good way to test whether a component re-renders or not using enzyme/jest. Now that these components are using React.PureComponent, we know that they won't re-render unless the new props or state do not equal the previous. \n\nReact.PureComponent\u2019s shouldComponentUpdate() only shallowly compares the objects. If these contain complex data structures, it may produce false-negatives for deeper differences. Only extend PureComponent when you expect to have simple props and state, or use forceUpdate() when you know deep data structures have changed. Or, consider using immutable objects to facilitate fast comparisons of nested data.\n\nhttps://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent. Some were empty strings and some were null, so I decided to go with empty strings/objects because the prop types aren't expecting a null value. Currently the transform components are not doing null checks before rendering, but they could in which case defaulting to null would be better. In other words, if data defaults to null then components should handle null values.. Thanks for reviewing!. Yes, the serializeEvent function from event-to-object.js serializes synthetic events according to the spec. We are losing some good types, so we could do something like this:\n```ts\nexport type SerializedEvent =\n  | Partial>\n  | Partial>\n  | Partial>\n  | Partial>\n  | Partial>\n  | Partial>\n  | Partial>\n  | Partial>\n  | Partial>\n  | Partial>\n  | Partial>\n  | {};\nexport function serializeEvent(\n  event: React.SyntheticEvent\n): SerializedEvent {\n  ...\n}\n``. Ok, I moved this to object-to-react and just put it inline with the other property checks (e.g.if (obj.attributes.style == null) { ... }. I also movedarrayToReactChildrenwithinobjectToReactElement's scope so that it can accessonVDOMEvent` arg.. ",

So another way of orchestrating this is:\njust have a state_history list, that contains a list of states, and a current_position int that indicates where in history you are. The way I've done this in other settings, a current_location of 0 means you are at the most recent state.\nUndo increments current_position, and redo decrements current_position.\nTherefore, when accessing the current state:\ncurrent_state = state_history[state_history.length - current_position].\nActions that result in a new state do state_history.slice(state_history.length - current_position).concat([new_state]).\n.

    "benlesh": "That's an interesting wrinkle. cc/ @jayphelps\nPerhaps we need to remove the hard peer dependency and just document it clearly?\n. @rgbkrk I would definitely create a custom Subject that extends Rx.Subject for this. Be sure to override lift if you want to add custom operators. Otherwise all operators will return Subject, which is probably fine.\n. ",
    "jayphelps": "@blesh That won't solve the issue of us doing our imports from rxjs and not @reactivex/rxjs.\ne.g. we do\njs\nimport * as Rx from 'rxjs';\nBut that doesn't work with @reactivex/rxjs, it would need to be \njs\nimport * as Rx from '@reactivex/rxjs';\n...but then we have the inverse problem of not working with rxjs.\n. @rgbkrk you might have some odd bugs in the future mixing Rx implementations though, since the Observable you create in your action will be your Rx version, but the Observable of future actions we pass to you will be from _ours; perhaps not super likely, but we also need to a solution for normal web users as well...though this might not the correct forum.\n(instanceof Observable checks would fail too, but that's a pretty rare thing to do)\n. @rgbkrk sorry, I should have checked first. It appears rxjs-fs hasn't been touched in years and depends on v4 instead of v5. There isn't any maintained alternative I can find. It's fairly simply to implement something similar to what I showed with writeFileObservable. You also don't really need to do that, just thought it was probable you would need to read/write multiple times in different places.\n. @rgbkrk AWESOME!!! \ud83d\udc6f nice work.\n. Discussed with @jdetle on gitter, but recording here for posterity. The issue is that redux-observable doesn't currently implement its own ActionsObservable.from so it inherits it from Observable.from, losing the .ofType prototype extension. tl;dr Static operators don't currently use the lift mechanism like prototype operators do, but we've been discussing solving that in RxJS.\nFor this PR, you can just switch to using ActionsObservable.of:\njs\nconst action$ = ActionsObservable.of(\n  { type: 'EXECUTE_CELL', id: 'id' },\n  { type: 'EXECUTE_CELL', id: 'id_2' },\n  { type: 'ABORT_EXECUTION', id: 'id' },\n  { type: 'EXECUTE_CELL', id: 'id' }\n);\n\nWe will override from in redux-observable, if either of you want to PR it, I believe this works (but needs tests to prove):\n``` js\nclass ActionsObservable extends Observable {\n  static from(ish, scheduler) {\n    const input$ = Observable.from(ish, scheduler);\n    return new ActionsObservable(input$);\n  }\n// ... other existing stuff\n}\n```\n. @jdetle you're welcome!\n\n. > What do you think of the epic structure here @jayphelps?\nIf you mean like directory/file structure, looks good to me \ud83d\udc4d . @rgbkrk Looks like these are missing too: redux, rxjs, react-notification-system.\nI think the best way to prevent these sorts of things is to move everything that isn't a common build dependency into its own package, instead of having stuff in src/. Just to confirm, this imports all operators by using from \"rxjs/operators\"; whereas previously operators were individually imported. These new lettable operators are tree-shakeable, but I did a bit of digging at the various webpack configs and it doesn't appear it's configured to remove the dead code? (webpack itself only makes the exports unused, something else needs to then remove the deadcode, like uglify). Then again #1016 was done specifically to do shaking, so perhaps I'm mistaken? \ud83d\ude06  \nSomeone might want to confirm my theory. I think the bundle size likely increased, but it might be negligible since nteract already imports a good percent of the operators.. @trxcllnt is the owner of rxjs-fs, which appears mostly defunct (last release 4 years ago). So if you plan to release this package maybe he would be willing to part with that package name?. Not that I know of. I once tried to make flow types for rxjs's operator patching but I couldn't find a way to do this. It will always complain about \"Covariant property incompatible with contravariant use\".\nLooking again, I found someone who says that this prototype-patching style intentionally not supported--but they might not speak for the real official position.\nhttps://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/4643#issuecomment-323551894\n\nFlow is intentionally not focused on typing pre-class, prototypical inheritance code\n\nIf the rxjs community brought this use case up directly they might reconsider, but it really depends on their reasons and limitations. Even with the differences I'm aware of between flow and TypeScript, it's not immediately clear what they mean by \"unsafe\" as it seems to be relatively safe in TS. Maybe they just mean philosophically the act of modifying an existing type in-place is more unsafe than not allowing it; which is true and isn't ideal, but this is JS so.. \ud83d\ude1c . Yeah, dunno if you've heard about the whole lettable operators work that is coming shortly but you could follow the same approach.. this will sometimes map a LOAD_FAILED action into a nearly identical LOAD_FAILED action, if an exception was caught inside the above switchMap where you Observable.of(loadFailed(xhrError)). This feels a bit brittle as someone might come in here later and not realize that \"xhr\" does not always mean xhr (it might be that action).\nHow I usually handle things like this by checking inside a do and throwing, basically the same way you did it above for the !action.path check. Then just use a single catch\njs\nreturn contents\n  .get(serverConfig, action.path, {})\n  .do(xhr => {\n    if (xhr.status !== 200) {\n      throw new Error(xhr.response);\n    }\n  })\n  .map(xhr => ({\n    type: \"LOADED\",\n    payload: xhr.response\n  })\n  .catch((xhrError: any) => Observable.of(loadFailed(xhrError)));. looks like you exported an array of all epics in packages/nbextension/nteract_on_jupyter/epics/index.js but it's not used here. FYI. ",

In bqplot we have custom styling when the widget view is contained in something that has a css class theme-dark.\nThis made me think of what you mentioned earlier about having (some) standardization for the DOM structure and css classes, which would be useful to replace this.\n.

The 0MQ rationale as it is just arguments with not empirical or significant evidence to support their rationale. Share alike licenses do lead to fragmentation of open source projects due to license incompatibilities or asymmetric sharing as you cannot re license.\nAlso we have to be in line with reality. Many organisations have license whitelisting and also contractual clauses about code ownership and licensing. In these if the license is not whitelisted or incompatible with contractual obligation you cannot use it. This mostly affects outsourcing and contracting and more acute in outsourcing where contractual obligations are more stringent. In addition, more legal scrutiny and compliance on IP related issues become more costly depending of the dependencies you use. In case of prototypes and demos legal negotiation of these happen before entering into a contract hence upfront overheads increase before being assured of a contract hence it is more rationale to keep costs and potential of legal related questions to a minimum.\nThis is a minor annoyance with MPL and not the main issue. MPL can be used in commercial setting there you link to the compiled code. Issue comes in non compiled code like JS, HTML. Say you put a logo in the HTML what license coves this modified page. Since the image is separate it need not be MPL in which case what is the rationale of sharing the HTML without the image does the image need sharing also and becomes MPL? If you recreate the HTML with the logo then this is a form of copying hence the file you create is MPL. If you look into the source to see how X is done or integrate to implement / integrate new components Y then Y becomes MPL as you might have to use non trivial part in X to implement Y. Say I want to embed a cell evaluation into another application then studying how this is done and in the current file and implementing this by the same person will become copying unless a 3rd person comes in between to write a specification on how the integration is done. In an sharealike project it s a legal risk to look at the code learn how something is done as by implementing what you learned through looking at the code means the code will become tainted. If you use an IFrame or canvas to embed this will this combined canvas becovered under MPL? IFrame maybe not but forms of embedding / partial embedding this is problematic. None of these issues have be tested in court so lawyers can argue at length and then send you the bill. So best route is to have the option where you can use without have to jump over many hurdles or too costly or risky to use.\n. > can weigh in but vote is not mandatory\nI have included a list or other uses who might be interested in the project (contributors to sister projects and forks) but not contributors to this project. They have contributed to the project hence for the purpose of the license change their vote is not necessary in case they cannot be contacted or do not vote. They have begin CCed as a courtesy to make them aware of this issue than just limiting it to the project contributors so they can raise their issues or concerns if needed.\nAnyway I removed the particular wording.\n. I removed the classifications. \nAlso please record your vote by clicking on the relevant box.\n. Though nteract is open source for integration purposes if you look at the code there is a chance what you develop will become MPL. Also there are reasonable about of JS and HTML which will stay MPL.  E.g. Also there is a chance if https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen integrations similar to that of this project and no documentation on the contrary clear room process was followed the some of the code may become MPL without anybody thinking mainly due to the uses familiarity of code in nteract .  (I am just giving this as an example.) Similarly if this is integrate by studying some of the code into another project this might become tainted without a clean room design and worst without anybody's knowing. In commercial closed should projects involuntary training may not become an issue as there is little chance that this can be discovered and legally enforced. Bigger issue is if the code is open source or there is an intention or obligation to release under a different license (say ASL 2.0) where any similarities can easily be scrutinized and found in case of integration code and can be argued as copied. Also there is very difficult to ascertain if is any is actually \"copied\", could be legally held as copied or not copied, from external parties. Even in commercial closed source setting it always help to ensure the code is not encumbered by possible legally gray areas. In case there is a CLA and one party owns the code incase there is accidental tainting then you have to negotiate with only one party. In case there is no CLA these issues cannot be resolved as there might be many parties from whom you should get agreement.

I'm not exactly sure what you mean, but it would be difficult to integrate nteract components with Jupyterlab components, because nteract uses react and corresponding libraries in the react ecosystem, while Jupyterlab uses a similar-but-different library called PhosphorJS. \n.

I'll play it cool and see if anyone wants to tackle this.\n. I'm all for it, the logger can be very annoying when its not necessary.\n. Thanks @cabhishek!\n. ^ the hackiest of hacks :/\n. Up to reviewers whether we should add tests and additional flow improvements here or in a separate PR. \n. Erroneously thought dispatch would also cover the reducer. Taking care of that now.\n. Ayyyyyyyy\n. I would love to hear input from people with more experience regarding an idea. It would be really great to have a collection of slides that onboard new developers to how the app is organized. \nThe  idea being that one could go through a collection of annotated slides starting out with something along the lines of:\n\n1. \"Here is the base electron app. It is launched in `main/index.js`. This is a part of the main process.\" \n2. \"This is the menu, it communicates with various components, which are all part of the electron Renderer process...\"\n3. \"This is a code cell, it communicates with the kernel through these epics...\"\nThis is not meant to be a tutorial, but a visual collection of relevant links and tangible examples of areas where the tech stack is used in nteract.\n. Yeah I'll get to working on it tonight. Its bound to help me actually understand things as well.\n. Thanks so much @willingc!\n. Of course I'd love to help. I've been pretty swamped with worky-work so I can't commit to any deadlines. But I'd love to work with you and help you figure everything out.\n.

Or is that too arbitrary?\n. \ud83d\ude0d This looks so awesome!!!!\n. Welcome to nteract @evanuk! Hope this is the first of many PRs!\n. Somewhat related, support for screen readers would be awesome.\n. Edited: I was talking with a family friend at edX and she was saying that they don't let any product into the edX platform doesn't comply with [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag). \n. Hah that would definitely be me. Thanks @evanuk. \n. As an aside, linting the tests will be a pain but something we should do soon.\n. :shipit: \n. Yay for tests!\n. Thanks! Opening a separate issue because I still cant connect to a kernel :'(\n. Yeah I was in a rush to get to work but I'll get to it tonight when I get back to my linux machine.\n. Love me some increased coverage.\n. A related (possibly tangentially related) issue was the discussion of a 'fuse'-like mechanism (https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/1452) to prevent the subject from producing too much data such that the data-consumption+rendering can't keep up. I don't know if this could be solved by a custom observable, but @blesh, you certainly seem like the right person to ask.. TIL about z-indices! \n. Thanks for cleaning up after yours truly :)\n. @estevanjantsk What happens when you runnpm run flow`? I was having trouble getting it working on my machine this morning.\n. psssst You're also welcome to chat on http://slack.nteract.in/\n. @estevanjantsk, do you use a command line text-editor like vim?\n\nIf so, for the future you, you can go in and edit your commits with git rebase -i HEAD~4. You use your text editor see each commit in the form of pick <commit SHA> 'commit message'. \nFrom here you look at what you want to change, in this case it might be the commit simply named 'changes'. Rename this by changing 'pick' to 'reword'. After this step, exit the interactive editor. From here you will be taken to a prompt to write a new message. You can update it to what we want from there. When you're satisfied with your changes, you're going to have to 'rewrite history' and use git push origin <branch_that_you_were_working_on> -f\nSorry, just wrote this and realized that you two are going in another direction. Awesome PR! Really look forward to learning more about Flow.\n. @estevanjantsk I actually use both! \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af I look forward to seeing more PRs in the future!\n. You're always welcome on slack, where we keep you apprised of the best coffee making methods, white noise generation, and discuss ideas for where to take nteract! \n. I can't put words in Kyle's mouth but in my mind the best PR is the one\nthat keeps you coming back :)\n. Contents of my kernel.json file\n1 {\n  2  \"language\": \"python\",\n  3  \"display_name\": \"Python 3\",\n  4  \"argv\": [\n  5   \"/home/jdetlefs/github/nteract/bin/python3\",\n  6   \"-m\",\n  7   \"ipykernel\",\n  8   \"-f\",\n  9   \"{connection_file}\"\n 10  ]\n 11 }\n. Very possible\n. No, but I installed more kernels \n{ name: 'python2',\n     files: \n      [ '/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/python2/kernel.json',\n        '/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/python2/logo-32x32.png',\n        '/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/python2/logo-64x64.png' ],\n     resources_dir: '/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/python2',\n     spec: { display_name: 'Python 2', language: 'python', argv: [Object] } },\n. This still doesnt work,\n1 {\n  2  \"display_name\": \"Python 2\",\n  3  \"language\": \"python\",\n  4  \"argv\": [\n  5   \"/usr/bin/python\",\n  6   \"-m\",\n  7   \"ipykernel\",\n  8   \"-f\",\n  9   \"{connection_file}\"\n 10  ]\n 11 }\n. I omitted this error because I thought it wasn't relevant, but I also get this error.\nSubscriber.ts:210 \nUncaught Error: EACCES: permission denied,\n open '/home/jdetlefs/.config/nteract/theme.json'\n. Okay so things are working now. I nuked the kernels and reinstalled. There still might be an issue here with how we handle a broken kernelspec, but I'm not sure. Closing for now.\n. It was this one \n1 {\n  2  \"language\": \"python\",\n  3  \"display_name\": \"Python 3\",\n  4  \"argv\": [\n  5   \"/home/jdetlefs/github/nteract/bin/python3\",\n  6   \"-m\",\n  7   \"ipykernel\",\n  8   \"-f\",\n  9   \"{connection_file}\"\n 10  ]\n 11 }\nbecause this path didn't actually exist. Unfortunately I was stupid and deleted both of the kernels.\n. Alright, so it seems like a broken kernelspec causes this error Uncaught Error: spawn /usr/bin/python2.71.\nTo reproduce, change the path of the kernel.json file to anything that doesn't exist. In my case I changed /usr/bin/python2.7, to /usr/bin/python2.71. \n. ``` javascript\n!/usr/bin/env node\nconst spawnteract = require('spawnteract')\nspawnteract.launch('python2').then(kernel => {\n        // Returns\n        // kernel.spawn <-- The running process, from child_process.spawn(...)\n        // kernel.connectionFile <-- Connection file path\n        // kernel.config <-- Connection information from the file\n    // Print the ip address and port for the shell channel\n     console.log(kernel.config.ip + ':' + kernel.config.shell_port);\n\n});\nfunction cleanup(kernel) {\n     kernel.spawn.kill();\n     fs.unlink(kernel.connectionFile);\n}\n```\nworks fine with this python 2 kernelspec installed per the normal instructions: (kernel.json file)\njson\n  1 {\n  2  \"display_name\": \"Python 2\",\n  3  \"language\": \"python\",\n  4  \"argv\": [\n  5   \"/usr/bin/python2.7\",\n  6   \"-m\",\n  7   \"ipykernel\",\n  8   \"-f\",\n  9   \"{connection_file}\"\n 10  ]\n 11 }\nbut if I change that spawnteract script and run it with my python3 kernel: (kernel.json file)\njson\n  1 {\n  2  \"language\": \"python\",\n  3  \"display_name\": \"Python 3\",\n  4  \"argv\": [\n  5   \"/usr/local/bin/python3.5\",\n  6   \"-m\",\n  7   \"ipykernel\",\n  8   \"-f\",\n  9   \"{connection_file}\"\n 10  ]\n 11 }\nI get the same error: \nError: spawn /home/jdetlefs/github/nteract/bin/python3 ENOENT\n    at exports._errnoException (util.js:1036:11)\n    at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (internal/child_process.js:193:32)\n    at onErrorNT (internal/child_process.js:359:16)\n    at _combinedTickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:74:11)\n    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:98:9)\n. @rgbkrk at the cost of fixing this quickly I'm going to try to take a stab at closing this issue.\n. I'll check it out when I get home.\n. @prafful002 if you need help, I'm almost always available on slack\n. A wild @jdetle has appeared! I have no idea what the value of zmq-static is right now, but in terms of installing additional dependencies, I think we're fine. We can always post some sort of caveat, \"If you are having trouble installing dependencies for nteract, you're always welcome to ask questions in our Slack.\" (Of course I volunteer to help anyone having issues.)\n. Didn't really understand the notebook diffs but I'm going to assume everything is in working order! \n. Thanks for the PR!\n. ^ Confession time: I had no idea there were specific verbs that we had to use. Oops. \n. It's hacky and I know experienced developers hate regex but we could search/replace links before rendering them, no?\n. Sorry my previous response came off as rude, didn't mean it to.\n. Thanks for the issue! By any chance could to provide some code to reproduce the error? I can't seem to recreate the issue on my computer. \nSome questions: \nWhat OS are you using? \nWhat version of nteract are you running?\n. @aleury can you submit a work in progress PR so people can take a look at what you've done?\n. Nice! Does the laptop have a name?\n. :+1: for lappy 3000\n. My guess is that the more flow-typings we have the merrier ^Looks like @captainsafia beat me to it.\n. This was pretty painless to try out. Start up seems marginally slower. Now it is npm install --python=python2.7 but other than that I already had all the previous developer dependencies. I'll give it a go on my linux machine right now.\n. All good on Linux. I vote for :shipit:.\n. Also, thanks so much for doing this. I was trying to play around with similar problems for sidecar and I was way out of my comfort zone. \n. Includes the link to the andre staltz article we linked to previously.\n. I'll ask for a ready-for-merge next time, my bad.\n. npm WARN nteract No repository field.\nnpm WARN nteract No license field.\nI think we lost some stuff in package.json? Other than that running npm run pack works great on linux. \n. It produces an app/ folder containing build/ node_modules/ package.json and static/\n. Unfortunately, I'm running into some problems on Linux.

Ah, well then I imagine it will work fine when I do that. Sorry I couldn't take the time to debug.\n. ^ We could add this into the diagnostics script.\n.

Unfortunately coverage is going down because this is succinct code. \n. :shipit: \n. _I don't always ship it squirrel, but when I do, the linter fails 10 seconds later._\n. Hi Daniel!!!!\n. I'm fairly sure Darwin and OSX are the same, so maybe you can group those two plots together somehow?\n. Awesome! I really hope that we see more from you over the next days/ months/ years!\n. \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hey Daniel, I think the issue is that we do not yet have support for Conda kernels. (Coming soon!) If you runnpm run diagnostics`, this should list all the kernels available to you.\n. Ah I should have asked, so @chendaniely, if you open the dev console in nteract (View -> Toggle Developer Tools) on an open notebook page then run:\njs\nrequire('kernelspecs').findAll().then(console.log.bind(console)).catch(console.error.bind(console))\nthe kernels available to nteract will be listed. I think this does relate to #956 in that you should connect to an available kernel by default. \n. Hi @hainm! Thanks for trying it out. You bring up a good point, I think this might be meant for releases rather than developer installations, and perhaps we should make that clearer.\n. I was having trouble figuring out how it was supposed to work. Simply running nteract blah.ipynb didn't work (if it was supposed to.) I'm heading up to SF (and will be away from my linux machine) but I can continue working on it tomorrow night.\n. I assumed there was some step I was missing, thanks. I love me a good CLI.\n. Yeah I just double checked and unfortunately its still an issue.\n. Spitballing here but maybe it has something to do with the fact that I run node and npm locally as opposed to using sudo? Totally could be irrelevant, but doesn't hurt to mention.\n. You can just start calling me Patrick Star because clearly I live under a rock. Everything good after both npm installs. Thanks.\n. So at work I did something like this by keeping the scrollwheel showing if scrollable:\n::-webkit-scrollbar {\n    -webkit-appearance: none;\n    width: 7px;\n}\n::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {\n    border-radius: 4px;\n    background-color: rgba(0,0,0,.5);\n    -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(255,255,255,.5);\n}\nwill webkit work on nteract?\n. FINE. \n. Shucks well this isn't working:\nexport const publishEpic = (action$, store) =>\n  const boundHandleGistError = handleGistError.bind(null, store);\n  action$.ofType(PUBLISH_USER_GIST, PUBLISH_ANONYMOUS_GIST)\n    .mergeMap((action) => handleGistAction(action, store))\n    .catch(boundHandleGistError(err));\nI dont know if you wanted something else?\nI got an error at const boundHandleGistError\n. Okay, shoot, I found some problems with the work I did. \n. Thought: We could include Questions? Feel free to ping us on [slack](https://slack.nteract.in)\n. @captainsafia @rgbkrk I'm not sure if you'll laugh or cringe at what I did. Probably some combination of both...\n. Ideally, I would like to test the returned stream to ensure that the actions are of the appropriate type. Let me know how I should go about approaching this. It would probably require the creation of an actual observable and testing that this behaves appropriately, but then we run the risk of testing that RxJS works, right?\n. No, I did a different refactor inside that code. I'll tackle a refactor this weekend.. Gotta love that one line coverage increase.\n. Hi @alexandercbooth @captainsafia, I think regarding the toggleOutputDisplay issue, it should be a simpler fix than the one you're currently facing. There's probably just some conflict you created by adding the expanded boolean to the config, which will totally be fixable.\n. As far I understand it, the suggestion was to remove connect from display, and make sure that the notebook is still the only element that is connected. You would add expanded = state.config.get('expanded') to MapStateToProps in src/notebook/components/notebook and then pass it as a prop until it reaches the Display element. (@rgbkrk, @captainsafia, feel free to edit this post.)\n. Look at the reducer for ToggleOutputExpansion in src/notebook/reducers, I\nthink what that is doing is changing metadata for the individual cell. So\nin your display component you should ensure that Boolean value takes\nprecedence over the config. (This is a guess from my phone of what's going\non)\nOn Fri, Nov 4, 2016 at 9:02 AM alexandercbooth notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nWooWoo, it finally works and passes tests \ud83c\udf89\n@captainsafia https://github.com/captainsafia @jdetle\nhttps://github.com/jdetle @rgbkrk https://github.com/rgbkrk I\nappreciate all your input so much. You folks rock!!\nThe only thing now to address is toggleOutputExpansion. Any suggestions?\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/1102#issuecomment-258472774, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AKcARkXnPU8MzXL6uqROdBBOKQa-9g5gks5q61chgaJpZM4KkAD_\n.\n\nHave a wonderful day,\nJohn J. Detlefs\n. So I think there are few ways to go about fixing this. The way that would lead to the quickest fix would be to add some work  in Display. The notebook contains a cellMap, which is an ImmutableJS data structure. To get data from it you use functions that are a part of that library https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/. \n\nThe code in src/notebook/reducers/document: \n``` javascript\n[constants.TOGGLE_OUTPUT_EXPANSION]: function toggleOutputExpansion(state, action) {\n    const { id } = action;\nreturn state.updateIn(['notebook', 'cellMap'], (cells) => cells.setIn([id, 'outputExpanded'],\n  !cells.getIn([id, 'outputExpanded'])));\n\n```\ntakes the state of the notebook, and the id of the cell you want to change, and returns a new immutable data structure where the output expanded boolean is the opposite of what it previously was. What you want to do is something similar, but check if the outputExpanded boolean is different from that of the config, and if so, use that boolean instead. There might be some other fix that is easier and/or more sensible but this should at least point you in some possible direction to go to fix it.\n. you'd have a function in Display called something like, \nshouldOutputExpand() containing this logic,\nthis would involve binding the function in the constructor and defining in the class itself. The final step would be to pass:\n<Output\n                key={index}\n                output={output}\n                displayOrder={order}\n                transforms={tf}\n                theme={this.props.theme}\n                expanded={this.shouldOutputExpand}\n />\n. When I try to assert that it should error in the stream I get this issue regarding the error.\n1) publishEpic Epics in the right way:\n     AssertionError: expect.fail()\n      at SafeSubscriber.responseActions.subscribe.err [as _error] (test/renderer/epics/github-publish-spec.js:178:25)\n      at SafeSubscriber.__tryOrSetError (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Subscriber.ts:247:10)\n      at SafeSubscriber.error (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Subscriber.ts:205:16)\n      at Subscriber._error (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Subscriber.ts:139:22)\n      at Subscriber.error (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Subscriber.ts:109:12)\n      at CatchSubscriber.error (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/operator/catch.ts:56:26)\n      at MergeMapSubscriber._tryNext (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/operator/mergeMap.ts:117:24)\n      at MergeMapSubscriber._next (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/operator/mergeMap.ts:105:12)\n      at MergeMapSubscriber.Subscriber.next (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Subscriber.ts:95:12)\n      at FilterSubscriber._next (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/operator/filter.ts:92:24)\n      at FilterSubscriber.Subscriber.next (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Subscriber.ts:95:12)\n      at ScalarObservable._subscribe (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/observable/ScalarObservable.ts:51:18)\n      at ScalarObservable.Observable.subscribe (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Observable.ts:98:21)\n      at ActionsObservable.Observable._subscribe (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Observable.ts:158:24)\n      at ActionsObservable.Observable.subscribe (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Observable.ts:98:21)\n      at ActionsObservable.Observable._subscribe (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Observable.ts:158:24)\n      at FilterOperator.call (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/operator/filter.ts:61:19)\n      at ActionsObservable.Observable.subscribe (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Observable.ts:96:16)\n      at ActionsObservable.Observable._subscribe (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Observable.ts:158:24)\n      at MergeMapOperator.call (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/operator/mergeMap.ts:79:19)\n      at ActionsObservable.Observable.subscribe (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Observable.ts:96:16)\n      at ActionsObservable.Observable._subscribe (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Observable.ts:158:24)\n      at CatchOperator.call (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/operator/catch.ts:31:19)\n      at ActionsObservable.Observable.subscribe (app/node_modules/rxjs/src/Observable.ts:96:16)\n      at Context.it (test/renderer/epics/github-publish-spec.js:176:42)\n.

I want you to check what I added to the saving epic, but other than that I think its ready to ship.\n. 90% is so close I can almost taste it.\n. Thanks @lgeiger!\n. If we don't then we're just living a lie anyways.\n. So cool!\n. Closing, this, will try to refactor the github publish code to something that is less difficult to test.\n. Yayyyyy regression tests are working!\n. Oh, yeah. Didn't mean to be rude, I just thought it was cool that the tests failed when behavior changed. Tone is hard to convey over the internet.\n. Do you think this is ready for removal of the WIP tag @temogen?\n. Was just asking you if you could change the title! But this looks good to me too!\n. Congrats on a successful PR! Hopefully many more to come!\n. This definitely pertains to issues discussed in #1102.\n. Awesome, thank you!\n. Thank you, oh human greenskeeper.\n. Posted something without reading... oops.\n.

This is totally something on my todo list. The current idea would be to have some sort of setup where we could go to help > diagnostics and have a set of scripts ready to be ran for all sorts of common issues. In addition, the ability to post an issue to github from the desktop app if these common issue fixes don't help would be desirable. I'd love to hear your thoughts on how to best approach this problem @gvwilson! . Awesome, writing tests have helped me tremendously in understanding the\nnteract codebase. Good luck and don't hesitate to reach out to me on slack\nif you need help.. Thanks @greenkeeperio-bot! We missed you at plotcon!. Awesome, thanks!. Not noise at all! We really appreciate any user who takes the time to open (and close) an issue. Thanks very much @dhirschfeld.. \ud83d\udc4d . Gave gistID and gistURL module level scope to fix the problem, everything working now and its objectively cleaner code.. Unfortunately this is broken for overwriting gists. Will attempt to fix this after work tonight. . Need to come to a decision regarding how we want to handle metadata from previous notebooks, but for now I think this is mergeable.\n. > The main thing is that  \nI c wut u did thar. http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/web-contents/ <-- contents.printToPDF looks like the function we'd need to implement this. To the best of my knowledge we don't currently have it but I can work on it tonight for you @fbrundu! . Hi @fbrundu, I have working prototype up and this is the result I got: \nprintPDF.pdf\nIt looks like the shadows are rendered rather poorly, and in my opinion I wouldn't want this on my website. There's some work we can do to create a print style sheet to avoid this, it'll take a few more days, certainly.. @fbrundu @OliverEvans96, you're welcome to try to come up with a fix using nbconvert. I'll try to tackle that myself asap, but I just dont know very much about the project. Either way I think we'll need a special print stylesheet if you want to retain some amount of styling in a pdf.. Awwww yuss! Check it out: \nprint.pdf\nShould be up in the next few days.. Yeah I guess you're right that it should just be a function in main since it really doesn't do anything with state. Let me play around with that tonight and get back to you. Honestly I think print preview is something to work towards and mess around with but maybe its own PR. . Thanks for the very helpful feedback!. Yes, I've been putting it off because I'm not sure if I can do a good job on it. I'll take a stab at it tonight and tomorrow and if I cant get it up to par I'll close it and come back to it later.. @minrk https://github.com/jdetle/nteract/blob/f36a9b6668c98bf74d4eb3dfd0638bc3cea946f1/src/notebook/epics/github-publish.js#L63-L68 and https://github.com/jdetle/nteract/blob/f36a9b6668c98bf74d4eb3dfd0638bc3cea946f1/src/notebook/epics/github-publish.js#L105-L107 are what would be relevant to updating your extension.. Weirdness, the actions not getting emitted was fixed by moving complete into the gist callback. I imagine the complete call was getting registered before the observer.next in the callback? ... But that doesn't really make sense if the test was passing... more to be revealed later I guess.\n. Thanks for the rapid advice! Hope your holidays are going well.. I'll try to help out once I see your PR as a guide \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks for this @lgeiger!. Ready for a review?. Thanks for the awesome work, once again!. @michaelaye, @nicobrenner, thank you for the excellent report and quick fix. If there is extra documentation you would like to add such that future users can install and use nteract with less friction, please don't hesitate to make a pull request. We really appreciate any help we can get. . Hi @captainsafia, I made a change in #1403 that will cause a conflict for this PR. . I'm going to try to finish this off @captainsafia, hope thats okay. @peggy, This is ready for a review!. Think I took care of it, thanks @peggyrayzis . Thanks Greenkeeper!. Copying over comments and background given by @lgeiger:\n\nnteract adheres to the commonmark spec: http://commonmark.org/\nWhich if I recall correctly doesn\u2019t support this syntax\nAs a markdown parser we use: https://github.com/jgm/commonmark.js\nJupyter uses https://github.com/chjj/marked which is more or less unmaintained\nAn option would be to switch to https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it\nWhich also adheres to the comonmark spec and additionally supports GitHub flavored markdown with support for tables. Thanks @speakerToSystems! Welcome to the nteract community! \ud83c\udf89 . Ready for a review @peggyrayzis!. Done! Thanks.. Sounds good. I'll close this when I get home.. Very leet PR here.. Thanks @peggyrayzis . Thanks @rgbkrk, you're en fuego!. Thank you @rgbkrk . Thanks again!. I would think that once we are loading a notebook from S3 or some other\nremote location something like this will become even more useful, right?. Thanks greenkeeper!. cc @lgeiger . ^ works for me regarding adding that into the lexicon.. https://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/docs-testing.html it looks like we have to install some new deps to have test coverage for drag and drop.. Closing until I can figure out what exactly I'm doing wrong here.. I need to add tests but if anyone wants to check this out its ready for a review. @rgbkrk, @peggyrayzis, @captainsafia, @lgeiger. . I have absolutely no idea how to go about testing \njavascript\nexport function triggerSaveAsPDF(store) {\n  showSaveAsDialog()\n    .then(filename =>\n      Promise.all(\n        [triggerWindowRefresh(store, filename),\n          triggerKernelRefresh(store)]\n      )\n    )\n    .then(() => storeToPDF(store))\n    .catch(e => store.dispatch({ type: 'error', payload: e.message, error: true }));\n}\nand given that TriggerSaveAs seems to be uncovered as well, I think other people have had the same problem. Any ideas?. I could make the trigger functions take the functions that call inside as arguments, but I'd rather be able to stub them in the tests. Unfortunately that's not possible to the best of my knowledge.. Hi @peggyrayzis, are the changes ok?. @peggyrayzis, made that change you requested and squashed the commit :). Huzzah! Thanks so much for all the help. If any of you find things you'd like to iterate on and improve please let me know and I'll happily work on it.. Congrats on a solid conclusion to a hard week of work!. Awesome! Where'd you learn about this?\n. I played around with it and unfortunately none of the source-map methods for debugging worked especially well, but hopefully you can find something that works.. Welcome @arudhir! \ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf2e . It was inevitable that I forgot something, this is a quick fix I'll address soon.. Thanks @rgbkrk!. This will be helpful to look at when I'm flow typing in rx-jupyter. Thanks for all the hard work.. \ud83e\udd47 . Thank you sir!. Wow. \ud83d\ude47 . \n. Thanks for the catch @lgeiger. Made the fix.. I can tackle this now or if you'd like to make the change it would be very appreciated. Thanks for the catch, I really appreciate you trying it out! Brings a tear of joy to this contributors eye :). Fantastic! I will definitely merge any pull request I see addressing these issues. Thank you so much @jarmokivekas.. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83e\udd14  I would go for making the title of the \"Convert to markdown/code cell\"  in the dropdown menu be the text explaining the hotkey. If a user hovers on this while using the notebook, they would find the hotkey. That, or we could put it in parentheses in the same dropdown menu. This is definitely something I'd love input on from our other developers. \n\n-- edit, more thinking\nFor a while we have been fairly cautious about adding keybindings and config to nteract. Key concerns (pun intended) are to pick key combinations that are available to every system, don't conflict with other muscle-memory actions, align with hotkeys in Jupyter/RStudio (if they have them for the action in question), and to ensure its an action that is commonplace enough to warrant a hotkey. \nI think this issue is certainly something warranting a hotkey. #1360 mentioned the desire for a shortcut, but I think there is also an opportunity to enter the markdown editing upon changing the cell as well. My understanding is that this PR doesn't address this just yet, would you be interested in tackling it?. @jkornblum, I was thinking something similar while using the notebook today -- On a down arrow keypress event we create a new cell, I would like this cell to have the same type as the cell that was previously focused. What do you think of that as an idea?. @jkornblum note: edited my comment above to provide more thoughts.. @jkornblum, checked out your PR and ran into an unfortunate hotkey issue. Alt+m is a Mac hotkey to create the letter mu while in nteract. I think we may need to find another option. . Sorry I just edited it. I meant to say that we shouldn't have to double click the cell after changing its type with or without a hotkey. If we are editing the code cell, and switch to markdown, it should simply change to editing that text in markdown mode instead. Does that make more sense? . Oops, just checked it out and your work seems to address that issue perfectly. Thank you.. One potential fix for that issue is to unfocus the cell in question in the exportPDF function. That may be a somewhat hacky fix but I'd be okay with it personally. . @jarmokivekas Another thought is to hide scrollbars on outputs. The focus problem seems to be something that isn't as easily fixed. I'd be for hiding the scrollbars, merging this PR, and fixing that problem in a separate PR. . Oh man yeah I totally misunderstood the problem. If you move the style into main.css and get ride of the inline style, you could probably fix the problem, in addition, you could also override with !important as well. If you could get rid of the inline styling that's probably the more maintainable fix. . Thank you @jarmokivekas, is this your first merged pull request with\nnteract?. Awesome!!! Thank you so much Jarmo and I'm very appreciative of you fixing\nthese problems. A very belated welcome!. That's very kind of you to say, and warmly appreciated.. Thanks!. Thanks @peggyrayzis!. Thanks @gnestor!. I just merged it without attempting to fix the coverage issue that @rgbkrk mentioned, my bad @peggyrayzis!. Thanks @jkornblum!. \ud83e\udd47 . Closes #897 . Fixed and rebased typo.. Thank you thank you!. Thanks for this awesome maintenance work!. This is definitely buggy, the renderedKeyDown switch statement doesn't actually register the up and down arrow events, for example. I am going off to see John Wick, Chapter 2 right now, but I'm going to try and refactor this stuff to clean up dead code later and fix the UI/UX issues. . I think it may be worth considering other ways of handling output data in terms of the react component it is a part of? Possibly worth rethinking reduceOutputs?. ^ This response is extremely thorough and helpful, thanks.. ^ \ud83d\ude0e . Yes, sorry.\n. Look forward to trying it out!!. That was quick!. Its certainly not for the faint of heart, thanks for tackling it!. Oh no! I'll try to reproduce and figure out how to fix this issue.. Its secret by default? Or at least I thought... Will look into this right now.. Right, the problem here is that the current setup is that if the gist you're publishing has been made public, it won't set it back to secret. This is a legitimate concern though and I'll have to do some thinking on how to make this more straight forward, thanks.. If you want to test the notebook, I've posted it in the slack. . Closed by #1477 . I'm for it! There has also been discussion of implementing a better spellchecker, keeping track of history, managing keyboard shortcuts and exposing and interface to change notebook metadata. Some concerns I have over adding new features:\n- Minimize the amount of config that has to be maintained by developers\n- I dont know how rapidly we want to roll out new features. Generally I like moving fast and breaking things, but as we get close to a Beta and a Release Candidate I would like to keep d(Bugs)/dt negative. \nI think these are all features that should be added to the Release Candidate section of the Roadmap, what do you think @betatim?. Seems like updates to lerna and webpack have made this much faster. Huzzah!. Thanks for this catch! Awesome work.\n. I'm all for merging this as it is now and tinkering with it for a bit before we make another release. It looks like there are some issues with the flow typings that you're going to need to fix to get CI to pass. . Have you tried using the notification system? Curious to see how that would look too. . @alexandercbooth, I'm happy to either pair or make some commits to try to help fix the CI issues. Are you okay with collaborating?. Since I did the refactor I'll look at this tonight.. The world is on fire right now.. Hi @maphew, I'm reopening this issue because I'd like to learn more about your problem. Can you go back and try to reproduce the issue with the kernel discovery while you had an install of python and ipython? If you can, and have access to a command line, it would be useful to see the result of jupyter kernelspec list --json. We'd appreciate any help we can get since we don't get too many issue reports from windows users.. I completely understand.

Detlefs\n. Is it just me or are the comment and merge buttons a different color now?. Hi Francesco,\nThis sounds like an interesting problem, but I'm not sure its one nteract can solve. Nteract and all the kernels for nteract rely on the Jupyter messaging specification. My (rather limited) understanding is that the way Python handles package management is different than javascript, julia, and other languages for which there is a messaging-spec adhering kernel. In order to maintain a language agnostic specification, I'm not sure this is a goal of the folks maintaining the specification. Of course, as in all things I'm not super sure, I bet other people have some thoughts on this. . I'm going to trust that you've tested this on a windows machine since I don't have one. Thank you @jkornblum!. I was able to reproduce this, this is totally a bug, thanks so much for reporting it! . Ah! I think its your node version? A lot of us use https://github.com/creationix/nvm to manage our node envs, we require greater than or equal to Node 6. . Closing this in favor of alternate fixes in the middleware.. This seems to be a problem with how the file path is getting resolved. Definitely a bug in the dev install, not sure yet if it is the same in the distribution.. Thanks!. ^ It seems this is for PHP? I don't know how we'd port that extension to javascript.. @ProgramFan are you a student at an accredited university? A proposal for a Google Summer of Code project to make nteract conform with the jupyter notebook would be great.. If you find a graduate or undergraduate student who is interested in programming please encourage them to apply as soon as possible! Thanks!\n\nLink:  https://github.com/nteract/nteract/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code. No problem, thanks for checking out nteract!. I think it should also be text as opposed to logos for clarity.. @brenbarn, nobody said that. Nteract is indeed a desktop based Jupyter notebook. Before it becomes an issue this and your last comment seemed somewhat brusque and unfair to people who donate their free time to make this software. Please make an effort to be cordial when voicing concerns about our work. . I'm so happy to hear that. My apologies if I came off as impolite. The goal of nteract is to be a desktop based notebook that conforms with the standard UI established by jupyter while also minimizing possible sources of friction for interactive computing. . Looks good to me! I'm going to rebase against master now for the cell refactor.. Looks great, and it looks like regression tests are working ;) If you can mock some of the cellmap stuff I imagine these tests will pass.. Did you have some trouble rebasing?. Whatever git workflow is the least amount of time for you is the one I support fully! Good luck, I'm quite excited to see this get merged :). Hi, this is my fault. Would you like to pair program to fix it some time\nnext week?. No, I mean have a video call where we work on solving it together. I can\nalso try to figure it out myself, just wanted to extend the invitation if\nyou're interested. Also, thank you for the issue report, we appreciate it!. Closed by restarting the github.com/nteract/oauth-server and #1672 . Fuck. I'm going to revert this, my apologies.. Undone, my bad.. @mstewart141, first off, congrats on opening your first PR! Come join our slack and we can hop on a video chat, https://slackin-nteract.now.sh/. Welcome to the nteract party! For people confused about the diff, there was some formatting that went on because of some git madness, but as the changes seem to reflect prettier formatting, it seems like a welcomed fix! Congrats on your first PR stu! I hope its the first of many.. Thanks for the catch @alexandercbooth!. Looking forward to checking this out! Thanks @jkornblum.. Yes: https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github/commit/ceeefb2c478ca4302e1fe60dece10bc40075eaaf. I wasn't aware of that as an option, lets do it.\n. The changelog indicates that they fixed a lot of errors that were showing up in our app.\n. We were getting some issues with lerna + yarn at work on that 0.23 version so I'm pretty sure you're right @dhirschfeld. . Could you please elaborate on the issue?. I thought I had fixed this issue, I'll look into it. Don't merge this yet, I need to double check things.. \n. @rgbkrk @lgeiger, works great. Not hogging much memory with npm run build:renderer:watch as far as I can tell.. That looks right, please make a pull request to change it. . @megamindbrian, this is a known issue and something that is rather difficult to solve.\nI encourage you to look into both the jupyter messaging spec and our own source code in src/notebook/epics/execute, most specifically, \"handleFormattableMessages\". \nWhat is happening is that APPEND_OUTPUT actions are piling up without being handled. https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/gettingstarted/backpressure.md, checkout this link for more info on how to possibly fix this backpressure problem. . Yes! It looks like you're on the right path. I think we might be able to figure out how to spawn kernels with iopub rate limited https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/931, lets talk on slack. https://slackin-nteract.now.sh/\n. Awesome! . Oooh, I might try to tackle this on Sunday if I find the time. Thanks @rgbkrk.. Hey I'll look into this.. Yes! Thanks for messaging me, I feel bad about not getting around to this. . Looks good to me! Should I merge?. Thanks dave, it looks like there are no semiotic settings for the grid view.. There's no rush on my end! I hope you have a great weekend. . Okay, I trust that you know whats best for this code. Thanks!. Shouldn't there be a vendor.[hash].js removed from an index.html somewhere?. Alright, thanks for the PR. Hope you're doing well!. Is that the same as dynamic imports?. I checked it out and it ran great on my notebooks. It looks like some snapshots need to be updated before a merge.. closed by ##3132. :shipit:\n. This is an action too, no?\n. For whatever reason that did not actually work. Is static/icon.png better?\n. do you prefer \"gray\"?\n. its a little heavy actually\n. haha!\n. should be a space  after be? \n. Hmmm this weird thanks.\n. @rgbkrk was saying that we should probably keep this on the backend. In an attempt to paraphrase: \"There is too much indirection by having github auth in src/notebook/menu, by having it in the backend we can manage authorization across all open windows\"\n. Yea I have no idea where this came from.\n. I can probably do that with the query selected text, thanks!\n. So I think this stems from a lack of understanding. In the case of a new user authenticating, there will be multiple 'dom-ready' events, if that's the case I want to destroy the window after the first event. If there is a more elegant way of doing this sort of thing, please let me know.\n. typo?\n. Thanks, I was confused about this, does this come from enchannel?\n. This is totally still a huge pain point for me. http://jsfiddle.net/staltz/8jFJH/48/ Playing with this code leaves me to believe all streams are observables. Should I distinguish streams vs observables in the docs or are they synonymous?\n. \"Emits a createSourceUpdateAction to update the source of a cell if the kernel has requested so by setting replace to true. This is eventually dispatched as a redux action.\"\n...win win?\n. Observable doesn't get highlighted in my current state of atom. Okay if I just default to Observable?\n. Same with line 160 I presume?\n. (Forgot to add the changes in my last commit )\n. Up to you. I just was following your lead on where to put things.\n. Can do.\n. Okay. Will take care of this right now.\n. Doy ignore my bad math here.\n. Is this meant to still be here?\n. would that be inside the epic?\n. Good question, I'm not sure what we would want to do if the error message cant be parsed. But this was due to the fact that I was passing a message that couldn't be parsed.\n. Totally broke this unintentionally.\n. Sounds good. \n. What would that error be? My first thought would be to create a new error action?\n. Oh! Right. Silly me.\n. There were errors that weren't getting caught by the catch statement, so I moved it out of mergemap. I think I understand what you're saying regarding specificity. Would it be overkill to have two separate catches?\n. What do you mean by this? \n. yeah your probably right.\n. Can you fix this typo? Thanks\n. I'd love to see {Observable} - Emits supported language elements.\n. Thanks Safia!\n. fixed\n. Great thing about tests, when you change something it breaks a lot of things!. Why the change from declare type CellCreatorProps to type Props?. I dont think we do, you can search for other instances of the same pattern elsewhere in our codebase. I'd be happy to write up an error action creator and refactor all the instances of code that dispatch an error like this. . Thank you sir!. Will this be left to iterate on later?. Good catch.. Can you explain what this is doing?. What an improvement!. This makes more sense for a new developer to understand whats going on under the hood I think. Are we getting rid of split cell action for now?. Nifty little use of destructuring here.. TIL. \ud83d\udc4d . Yeah I couldn't run the linter because a GeoJSON test is failing on my machine :. Trying npm run reinstall right now. was this intentional?. Ahh yes, didn't see that, sorry.. Ugh, yes. Too excited about my first PR in a while.... ^ \ud83e\udd14  I wonder what this is used for.... Oh, I was suspecting it was an easter egg a la the untitled theme . Where is expect getting imported from now? Or is it no longer needed in jest?. Ahh, it appears this is a benefit of Jest, awesome!. OH. I get it. Let me see if I can take care of that right quick. . Sorry that you had to repeat yourself.. I love that mock, but until we figure out how to implement it I like the horizontal toolbar. I'm hoping you agree!. Didn't realize that Stephen Colbert wrote enzyme.. happy to do that.. Love me some console.log removals!. Totally makes sense, fixed it. { ?collapsed: boolean, ?autoscroll: boolean | 'auto', ?deletable: boolean, ?format: string, ?name: string, ?tags: Array<string>, source_hidden: boolean, ?outputs_hidden: boolean, ?isolated: boolean }. Object is any object, this is an object that never gets accessed. It seems to be a shortcoming (or feature) of Flow that an Object that is never accessed, but only checked for existence, is essentially an empty object. I'm also slowly realizing that type doesn't do type inference unless you specifically tell it to, which is cool. I figure if we ever start using a msg key or something similar, then Flow will error, so it acts a bit as like our snapshot tests. . Good catch.. Done. Yay types!. it looks like \"Clear All\" might be worth extracting out to a constant?. Why tsx versus ts?. We usually build packages with lib over dist I think? Or is this doing something else?. I just tested in hopes that it would and unfortunately no, it wont.. We would have to create some sort of stub for ansi-to-react if we didn't want flow to error, right? . Sweet, thanks @lgeiger . Yes. Thanks.. I think we don't want to use the ts-loader at all. We should be using the babel loader at all times.. I thought that was a thing we we're trying to move over to doing.. Tsc actually ends up compiling everything without any outDir, so it all gets compiled in place. I think we need to use lerna to invoke tsc from the actual package directory. Does that seem like it makes sense?\nI'm probably using tsc here when I actually should be using tslint.. Probably not, I'll check.. TIL, thanks. I believe having tslint gives us the ability to use prettier with typescript? Tsc also having an --emitDeclarationOnly, isn't the build step I was imagining. yarn build should build the javascript and the types simultaneously. Invoking yarn build as a type check in CI seems a bit weird to me.. Okay, this is all very helpful. Thanks @lgeiger. I think maybe I'm thinking about typescript the wrong way. I will remove tslint based on your feedback. From here we can rely on the build process failing in CI as a sign that our typings are wrong.. makes sense, thanks. In the future I think it would be nice to make these mediaType props an enum of different mimetypes.. I dont know if this is how we want to do things. I would just say \"tcp\" | \"ipc\" and \"hmac-sha256\". We can use type checking to determine whether we need to add to this.. I believe this should be moved into the root level types/ folder.. It looks like an enum :D. Yeah, our flow typings weren't perfect. I think taking the least-permissive route with enums whenever we can is the way to go.. I think you need to add it to the tsconfig.. what is the significance here?. What tsc-build process are you referring to specifically? I'm afraid I've lost context here.. As a matter of principle I have to remove this :D . Haha I just hated reading this back in my math days :D thanks for the great work.. Yeah, on my todolist for today.. are we makings props interfaces or types?. I'm thinking that I should delete this with the files portion in package.json, but I'm pretty out of my element here.. I need to look into this more.. Was this originally nonexistent or 20px?. I think this needs a build step, just did this and needed to run yarn build first.. I believe these are meant to exist at the root level? Still not sure about this.. ",

    "AlJohri": "@rgbkrk one really nice feature of the jupyter web interface is that using the CLI, if I run: jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb within a virtualenv, it will automatically use the virtualenv's kernel without having to run python -m ipykernel install. I find that running ipykernel install can quickly end up with a ton of kernels in nteract's drop down menu since I use a virtualenv for each project (related #1041, https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/1576#issuecomment-331669619)\nis there any way that running nteract analysis.ipynb within a virtualenv could automatically detect that its being run from within a virtualenv and start with the virtualenv's kernel if it exists? I know that running jupyter-kernelspec list within the virtualenv is able to find it:\n$ pipenv run jupyter-kernelspec list\nAvailable kernels:\n  python3    /Users/johria/.local/share/virtualenvs/hss-gPwjJtJU/share/jupyter/kernels/python3\nI do understand that this is a little more of an advanced user edgecase but, it would be great to sort of implicitly support this kind of usage when triggered from the CLI but don't surface it in the GUI in anyway. so in the end, I can run something like:\nenvdir envs/local pipenv run nteract analysis.ipynb\nenvdir creates a subshell with the environment variables defined in envs/local and pipenv creates a subshell using the virtualenv. thus nteract would start from a shell with an active virtualenv and should ideally be able to find the kernel accordingly\ndoes that sort of make sense? I already use envdir envs/local pipenv run jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb pretty regularly and it works great. closing in favor of #1584. hi guys,\ni'm getting the same issue. the console shows specifically this error:\nhttps://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=undefined&scope=gist&redirect_uri=https://oauth.nteract.io/callback&state=d4c921345af38373 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)\nguessing there's some error in here: https://github.com/nteract/oauth-server/blob/master/index.js. since we're on the issue of github user gists, it would be pretty helpful if the gists could either have an option to publish as secret or publish as secret by default (where users can choose to make it public when they're done). it's hard to use for work if its public by default. That could be the case! I just assumed it wasn't, haven't been able to try it yet. In which case, the wording should probably be adjusted to say private or secret gist.. closing in favor of #1579. @lgeiger I've used nohup a bit on my laptop and it should work. Doesn't the fact that I see /tmp/nteract-nohup.out with updated timestamps mean that nohup is working properly?\nI'll try out the development version when I get a chance.. @lgeiger great that worked for me!\nI ran:\nnpm install\nnpm dist\nAnd then opened the dmg and dragged nteract to the /Applications folder.\nI was able to start by:\n- typing nteract in the CLI\n- typing nteract Untitled.ipynb in the CLI\n- clicking Untitled.ipynb in Finder\n- clicking on the app itself in /Applications via Finder/Dock\nNotes:\n- using the CLI it always creates a separate dock icon each time you type nteract with or without a filename; clicking on the filename in Finder or App itself this doesn't occur\n- regardless of whether starting the app from the CLI or GUI, I am always asked: 'Do you want the application \"nteract Helper.app\" to accept incoming network connections?'\n  - this may be because its a local unsigned installation though\n. Cool. Is there anything else needs to be done before the @lgeiger cli branch can be rebased and merged in? I can make a PR if the rebase doesn't turn out to be to complicated.. closing in favor of #1581. Just came across the pycharm run script which has some logic for checking if the app is already running. Throwing a copy here in case its helpful: https://gist.github.com/AlJohri/67565210406871d4ac25c5bf5834d239. @rgbkrk one benefit of the way the process starts now is that it inherits the environment variables of the current shell. if the cli integrates with an existing nteract instance, what do you think would be best practice for env vars?\nmy main use case is database credentials - I use notebooks pretty often to store mongo/sql queries. I'd be interested to explore a little more how other GUI apps do it.\n\n\nexperimenting with pycharm, starting the app via the command line using charm . will take the environment variables of the current shell. trying to start pycharm again via the command line in either the same terminal session or another has no affect on the environment variables - they are frozen after first launch. this makes sense\n\n\npycharm also has an interface to set environment variables at a project level but its kind of a pain to use: \n\n\n\npycharm also has a EnvFile plugin which is what I currently use: \n it works fine but I'm not a big fan of env files - I prefer using envdir so its inconvenient to have to manage both. but perhaps that's more of a personal opinion, I suppose :)\n\n\nthere is always launchctl setenv VAR VALUE which I think mostly works but that is seriously a nightmare and a half\n\n\nI'll ponder on this some more, but I think telling someone to quit nteract and start it again from the command line to get the env vars is not the worst thing in the world for now since that should work OOB. Seems like R uses Renviron files but even Rstudio has some issues with this. Can only set like global environment variables not project / workspace specific.. ah got it. this should probably be closed then since its not relevant to nteract. do you know what repository would be best to raise this (if its something that should be raised)?. got it, I'm going to close this as wontfix for now. apparently I'm also pressing dd on top of cells to delete them. potentially a vim muscle memory but more likely from my notebook days as well. Good to know, thanks!\nI think I might be interested in implementing the command mode at some point, I have to read the code a bit more. Do you know off the top of your head if the state for whether a cell is being edited (edit mode) or a cell is just selected (command mode) is already implemented? Seems like I would have to first implement a shortcut for Esc that switches to command mode and then a series of shortcuts that only work when a cell is selected.\nAlso, to keep with the nteract shortcuts that are appended with Cmd-Shift and don't require  \"switching modes\", perhaps adding a Cmd-Shift-D shortcut to delete a cell would be a quick idea. Thoughts?. @ajasja Seems there's already Cmd+Shift+N for creating a new code cell below so it's already deviating a bit from standard notebook shortcuts.\nI think its reasonable to have a set of shortcuts that offer limited functionality without context switching like it does right now (i.e. only insert below, not above) and still have the full-fledged command mode that might take a bit longer to implement.. @blas-ko does this help?\n\n\n\n. fixed by #1608. Hi @currymj! There's some interest. PRs would be welcome for additional keyboard shortcuts.

So I have a JsonDisplay component made but am unsure on how to make sure that it's used. Is the plan to check if the data returned is able to be parsed by JSON.parse and return the application/json mime type if so, or will this be communicated in some other way?\n. Submitted the WIP PR.\n. If you execute a cell a with the following\npython\nperson = { 'name': 'John Smith' }\nperson\nthe mime type of the result is text/plain, so in order to display it as a json tree, I put a check in richestMimetype to check if it can be converted to valid json and if so, return the application/json mime type.\n. Ah! Okay, that makes sense. I'll try that. Thanks!\n. Updated the PR and added a couple of tests.\n. \n\n\n\n. Okay, I updated componentShouldUpdate and it should be ready to go! Thanks!\n. Any time! \ud83d\ude03 \n. Looks like we're missing style as commit message type from the contributing docs. I can add that if you like.\n. Making the json tree fully expanded by default was actually as easy as passing shouldExpandNode={() => true}  as a prop to the JSONTree component. \nDo you still think we'll need to use the metadata? Will the metadata prop enable the expansion of the JsonDisplay component to be configurable by the user? I'm still very new to how the ipython messaging spec works.\n. Oh okay! Awesome. That makes perfect sense. \nI can make the change to the JsonDisplay component. Would you, or someone else more experienced with Jupyter, like to make the changes to the Jupyter project if this is time sensitive? If not, I'd be happy to begin contributing to those projects as well.\n. Okay, that sounds good!\n. Hi @rgbkrk! Looking at the IPython source code I found that we can currently do\n\nBut inorder to enable \npython\nIPython.display.JSON(myData, expanded=True)\nI think I would need to modify the  JSON class to accept the appropriate parameters and call the constructor of the base class. However, I'm not sure where to go from there. Where would the expanded property of the JSON class instance be used for metadata in the response? Thanks! \ud83d\ude04 \n. Looks like I have something working! \ud83d\ude03 \n\n\n. Awesome! That's pretty much what I did. Thanks! I'll go ahead and open an issue and make a PR to the IPython repo.\n. Oh no problem at all! I appreciate the confirmation that I was on the right track. \ud83d\ude04 \n. Looks like this issue is ready to be closed! Thanks for your help @rgbkrk! \ud83c\udf89 \n. Of course! \ud83d\ude03 \n. I pulled the wording from https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli, but I'm happy to change it if you would like! \n. We could probably help the code coverage by making the anonymous function in shouldExpandNode a method and testing that.\n. Ah okay. My original desire was to configure it from the test case but wasn't sure of the best approach. Thanks for the suggestion!\n. Oh okay, awesome! Thanks!\n. Hi @rgbkrk, actually this line of code is in the resolveScrollPosition method. In an attempt to set the focused cell by a callback ref instead, I noticed that resolveScrollPosition isn't called when a cell is unpinned because it remains the cell in focus:\njavascript\n  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\n    if (nextProps.focusedCell !== this.props.focusedCell) {\n      this.resolveScrollPosition(nextProps.focusedCell);\n    }\n  }\nCommenting out resolveScrollPosition and componentWillReceiveProps has no noticeable affect. The body still adjusts to have the original position of the unpinned cell in view. Should these methods be removed, or am I just missing something? Thanks!\n. That's what I was thinking. I just attempted to come up with something that looked halfway decent for the time being.\n. Sounds good! I'll look over the docs some more.\n. ",

Sometimes it's nice to be able to scroll with the page on large outputs (e.g. when your looking for that 1 class method) but other times it's super overwhelming (when you accidently print out all 500k rows of a dataframe).\nNo strong preference from me.\n\nShould we do the little output notch that's in Jupyter notebook or something else?\n\nPersonally, I think:\n- it should be at the top of the cell instead of at the side.\n- you should be able to click and drag the height of the cell too\n. Here's another scroll behaviour that I find a bit disorienting. When I click on a cell, the notebook scrolls to the top of that input cell.\n\nFrequently, the output of my previous cell informs the input of the next cell - I like to have the previous output and the next input in the same viewport. In this case, I would prefer if the notebook wouldn't autoscroll and would prefer the viewport that I have set up.\n. > To what extent do expandable outputs (#972 and #1010) and disabling of focus on input (#1055) address this issue?\nWow, those are awesome. It seems like there were two issues that I found disorienting:\n- Auto-scrolling when executing a cell \n- Auto-scrolling when clicking on a cell\nI'm not sure if those issues end up fixing these but \n\nif you have an input expanded that you are rerunning the scroll to next would constantly get you\n\nsounds like the behavior that I'm thinking about.\n. And a related issue is that pressing cmd-] and cmd-[ (which I use a lot to indent blocks of code) defaults to 2 spaces instead of tabs! so it's very easy for me to get mixed up:\n\n. I'm not sure how the output cells work w.r.t. sizing, but we might need to set height here if layout.height && !layout.autosize.

I think Jupyter Notebook will always create a code cell by default (pressing + button on menu) and I know that this always bugs me because I tend to work using a couple markdown cells and then a few code cells in a row.\nI can add (Alt+m) and (Alt+c) text to the dropdown menu for shortcut hint on this branch  before it is merged.\nI will create another issue regarding creating cells of the same type.. @jdetle (at above comment) I can leave this open for a little bit to get some input from group and then decide on hotkey if any.\nCan you explain this a little clearer? What do you mean by enter markdown editing upon cell?\n\n1360 mentioned the desire for a shortcut, but I think there is also an opportunity to enter the markdown editing upon cell as well.\n\nRegarding staying in alignment with Jupyter and RStudio, I believe the only shortcut in Jupyter Notebook to toggle cell type is 'M'/'Y' when in command mode (press ESC) although I'll have to verify; nteract does not have such command mode.\nMaybe we could enter a command mode like Jupyter when Document.editorFocused is null? \nI do not really use RStudio or RMarkdown so maybe someone else can comment on the thread?. Thanks @jarmokivekas.\nI'm going to just close this PR and open a new cleaner one just addressing placing markdown back into edit mode. I'll comment on #1360 about how to handle keyboard shortcuts.. This is closed with #1435 . I'll change this to WIP while I fix/add unit tests.. Hmm I didn't think so but it looks something got out of sync....\nIf I can't get it back on track I might just close this PR and open a new one with a fresh branch.. Closing this for #1671 . Yes sorry it's in metadata under the cellMap, I've edited my first comment.\nIt looks like jupyter uses cellMap.metadata.collapsed. I can follow and update nteract to use collapsed as well.. The package we're using for our menu (electron-context-menu) is using another package (electron-dl). electron-context-menu defaults to download the image to the downloads folder (which is default of electron-dl). It looks like electron-dl has an functionality to prompt save-as as an option. It just needs to be brought upstream to electron-context-menu.\nIt looks like there is an issue open already for this on the electron-context-menu GitHub page\nhttps://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-context-menu/issues/13\nOnce I get through finals this semester :smile: I will try to fork electron-context-menu so we can use the functionality in nteract.\n. I've kept other pr much simpler (no special logic) but still allow use to scroll last cell to the bottom.\nClosing this in favor of #1781. Yeah I'm seeing worse time than this on master on an older 1.8ghz macbook air.\nThe file .ipynb file generated is about 5-6 MB.. Is this the same as #1610 or a different feature?. duplicate #2369. Are you running nteract from Windows and wanting to use your Python environments installed on your ubuntu subsystem?. Should be possible I think, you will probably have to edit kernelspecs yourself.\nWhen nteract loads it's looking for kernelspec files which define kernel details (name, location, etc).\nWhen you load nteract on Windows I think nteract is checking the Windows location but your kernelspecs are installed on the Linux subsystem.\nThe Windows user location is %APPDATA%\\jupyter\\kernels which on mine is C:\\Users\\<name>\\AppData\\Roaming\\jupyter\\kernels\nThe Linux user location for kernelspecs is ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels\nYou can try and copy your kernelspecs from Linux location to the Windows location and then try to launch nteract again. Windows needs to be able to access and launch Python from the linux subsystem file location. Check out the kernel.json file to make sure Windows can interpret the file location.\nhttps://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kernels.html#kernelspecs. I'm confused by what you're asking.\nI'm able to delete it but I was just trying to use the \"clear cell output\", I suppose I can just rerun the cell \ud83d\ude04 . I cannot switch kernels on ubuntu (errors out) on 0.7.0\nI can file separate issue if necessary. Closed with #2591 . Yes I'm getting the same error on Ubuntu as well.. Okay, I'm pretty new to nteract (and kind of to Electron/JavaScript ha! I'm more C#/Python guy). I've been familiarizing myself with this code base but help me out.\nDo we know a notebook successfully loaded in the 'did-finish-load' event listener for webContents? Or should I just throw the init at the top of the launch() function.\n. If you created (I added this) a \nconstructor(props: Props): void {\n    super(props);\n    ...\n  }\nisn't that redundant with that type definition at the top of class?. Yeah I agree, I looked into do that but didn't know a quick solution. I can try to revisit in the future. There are a few other print to PDF things I'd like to work on. . So how is this typically handled in JavaScript? In Python one would return None or raise an exception. Here the function returns undefined if .get(-1) does not exist. Is it bad practice to return undefined in situations like this, is returning null more typical?\nIn my my react component I added the if (this.props.lastCell) to handle that situation.. Yeah that's a styling/ux decision. I don't have a strong opinion.\nPro: It's a much simpler to just increase this padding value.\n       Can provide the same buffer amount if desired (100vh - 110px)\nCon: Will leave that spacing even when the last cell is not a \"new\" cell.\n        Will not allow user to scroll cell to top (if px value is not large enough)\nI find myself trying to scroll my last cell to the top when I work.. The issue with the static CSS is that when you go to export PDF or print the notebook it will have this large empty space. Another option could be to add a class to the last cell (if empty) just apply CSS styling to that class.. That's the approach I would have gone for.\nI googled it thinking the function was there for a reason and found some posts about using \nrequire(\"./../../package.json\").version could expose the entire package.json in bundled code so I thought maybe the function was there for that. I have no idea how webpack/bundling works under the hood so I just left it \ud83d\ude04 .\nCheers. ",
    "darthoctopus": "yup! on further inspection seems to have some overlap with #548, which remains open. My bad, sorry for duplicating :(\n. Jupyter itself uses marked.

    "dhirschfeld": "Note: In the existing notebook shift-enter will execute and move focus to the next cell (possibly creating one in the process) whereas ctrl-enter will execute the cell, leaving focus in the same cell but displaying the newly calculated output below.. xref: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab_app/issues/48. From a user perspective it's very valuable to be able to search your command history. As a point of comparison in ipython/spyder you can start typing a command, press the up-arrow and it will cycle through all previous commands starting with that text. In nteract the UI would necessarily have to be slightly different as the up/down arrows are used to move between cells.\nI can see two possible solutions to this:\n  1. Use a modifier key - e.g. ctrl-up arrow\n  2. Create a separate History-Palette dialog similar to the notebook's Command-Palette. This dialog would list the history of commands from the most to least recent and would be filterable as you started typing.\nIMHO I think option 2 would probably fit in more smoothly with a UI such as nteract.\n. I'm not sure what a design/mockup would involve but I'll note my current thoughts in case they're useful.\nI really like my idea above of a History Palette which you could bring up with e.g. Ctrl-Shift-H. Similar to the Command Palette it would have a text box which would dynamically search/filter the results. The text box could initially be populated with the contents of the current line when the palette was invoked.\nI think this is a more powerful UX than cycling through the history with the up-arrow so would probably be my preference. It might still be nice to have the ability to cycle through history with e.g. Ctrl-\u2191 but the History Palette should be sufficient on it's own.\nNB: It doesn't appear there's an existing UI in the current notebook:\nhttps://gitter.im/jupyter/notebook?at=5ad07825109bb04332ba9b0c. Hmm, just seeing this now and want to make the point that not everyone wants all their conda environments showing up as kernels so I hope it's configurable! I dislike that behaviour so much that I've resorted to uninstalling nb_conda_kernels.\nEither way it should probably respect the kernel whitelist in the jupyter notebook config (something which nb_conda_kernels didn't do):\n```\nWhitelist of allowed kernel names.\n\nBy default, all installed kernels are allowed.\nc.KernelSpecManager.whitelist = set()\n```\n. Most installs I only have  miniconda in the root environment so that wouldn't work for me, however I do explicitly install any kernelspecs I want to actually show up. I like how you have to be explicit and actually install a kernelspec for it to show up - no magic involved. I can see how that might prompt a lot of noise from your average user not understanding why it doesn't just work out of the box though...\nThis would be fine if there were a configuration where I could easily specify which of the environments I wanted to see as options for a new kernel. I'm thinking of something like a multi-select which could be populated by reading all kernelspecs and conda envs. If any kernelspecs were installed then only those would initially be selected as options for a new kernel. If no kernelspecs were found then all valid conda envs could be initially selected as options for a new kernel and the user could then manually deselect any they didn't want showing up.\nThe default kernel for an nteract session could then be the one in the environment (first in the path) where it was started, falling back to either root or some globally specified default.\nDoes that sound reasonable/sensible? \n. I'm away for a week and might be very busy when I get back so might not be\nable to get to it for a couple of weeks...\n. Also, From #1256:\n\nIt would be nice to have an option whereby tab always indented 4-spaces. It would also be nice to be able to configure whether or not to show \"invisibles\" e.g. spaces. Sorry, dup of #1137 . I see that it's available in the cell dropdown. Sorry for the noise!\n\n. Sorry, should have mentioned - also Win7. Happy for this to be closed if\nit's an upstream issue...\n\nOn 12 Dec 2016 9:15 pm, \"Joshua Kornblum\" notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nI also observe this on Windows 7.

I don't think I've ever use a Windows \"theme\" so I'm not sure how I would tell what theme if any I'm using. It's a corporate machine so I guess I'm not running any fancy themes.\n\nIt is a Citrix desktop though so it's likely that Citrix is also disabling DWM composition and causing problems for Electron.. For reference, here's the same from my IPython (Spyder) session:\n\n. Ah, that'll be because I use the greedy completer by default - it's very useful when mucking about interactively - which I think nteract is great for! You can test in IPython with:\n %config IPCompleter.greedy=True\nYou can't seem to enable that in nteract though? Also there remains the issue of having to delete the last letter of the object before typing the period to trigger completion. It seems tab doesn't trigger completion - is there any way to force it (other than deleting and retyping the last letter and period)?. Ctrl-space was the magic I was missing - given that I don't think there's anything to do here so will close.... Thanks for your help getting me up to speed!. I can confirm that plotly works again on this branch!. Thanks for fixing! I'm  on master and can confirm you can now simply restart the kernel if you get an error from trying to execute before the kernel is ready which is much better than having to reopen a new instance.\nI'm not sure if it's technically feasible but the ideal UX (IMHO) would be if interact cached the execution requests until the kernel was ready. On my machine starting a kernel takes a couple of secs so having to wait for it to start before I can execute anything interrupts my workflow (I'm frequently having to restart the kernel in nteract because I was too quick off the mark!).\nIt's only a minor annoyance but it would be a nice to have. As a point of comparison the current notebook does appear to cache execution requests:\n\nHappy to open a new feature request issue for this if it's worthwhile?. Opened #1431 to track the execution request caching issue!. Thanks @rgbkrk - I've been meaning to enable 2-factor auth so once I've done that I'll sign up.\nNot sure how much actual help I'll be as I still haven't learnt JS, but I'm happy to test on Windows.. Regarding the tab behaviour, I would expect/like tab to indent the selection 4 spaces and shift-tab to dedent 4 spaces. This is the behaviour of the current notebook.\nOn the latest master v0.0.15-317-g935444c6 the tab behaviour is the same as for the released version (0.0.15) which is to say that tab works as above but shift-tab doesn't seem to do anything. GIF below showing nteract master vs the notebook:\n\n. I opened #1430 to track the shift-tab behaviour. Thanks for this! I've tested on master and confirm that tab now works to correctly indent the selection. I did however notice that shift-tab doesn't work so I opened #1430 to track that.. I think codemirror is perhaps trying to be too smart here. Whilst in some situations it might be nice for the selection to be aligned to the \"correct\" indentation level, sometimes that's not what you want.\nI think the simpler rule of increase/decrease the existing indentation of each line by 4 spaces would give a better UX not the least because it's very easy to reason about what the result will be!. This sounds similar to the discussion below?\nhttps://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel/issues/508. I can confirm that on this PR both tab and shift-tab behave as expected (as discussed in #1430)!. I hadn't noticed the difference in handling markdown cells but I just gave it a go and it doesn't really bother me - pressing shift-enter will continue to execute and move down so it doesn't break up my workflow.\nIt seems this difference is perhaps driven by the fact that nteract doesn't have the command/edit mode distinction so it might actually be strange if it were changed so that you have to press enter a second time to actually edit the markdown cell. It make sense in the notebook because shift-enter puts you in command mode and the second enter changes you to edit mode.\nI have no strong opinions on the matter though.... Those are my most missed shortcuts too! Though I tend to just use X rather than DD.\nIn nteract because it doesn't have a command mode any commands would have to use modifier keys. At the moment Ctrl-Shift-N inserts a new cell below. Perhaps insert cell above could be mapped to Ctrl-Shift-A, delete cell could be mapped to Ctrl-Shift-D or Ctrl-Shift-DEL and to make the most  of muscle memory Ctrl-Shift-B could also insert a new cell below. Good to know! So long as it works I'm fine with some spurious error messages - thought I'd better check it wasn't important though.. \nJust a quick note to say that master fails completely to build for me\n```\n\n\nnteract@0.1.0 prebuild C:\\dev\\packages\\nteract\nrimraf lib\nnteract@0.1.0 build C:\\dev\\packages\\nteract\nnpm run build:renderer && npm run build:main\nnteract@0.1.0 build:renderer C:\\dev\\packages\\nteract\nwebpack --progress --colors\n\nHash: d47a73c050ab5680198f\nVersion: webpack 1.14.0\nTime: 21606ms\n                Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names\nwebpacked-notebook.js  12.4 MB       0  [emitted]  main\n    + 1747 hidden modules\nWARNING in ./packages/transform-plotly/~/plotly.js/dist/plotly.js\nCritical dependencies:\n7:479-486 This seems to be a pre-built javascript file.

I have noticed this behaviour too and was going to open an issue but @ajasja beat me to it!. I quite like the current notebook tooltip - for ref:\n\nIn particular I like that it only shows the signature / first line initially as some docstrings can be huge and  so would be unwieldy in a tooltip. You can expand the tooltip to see the full docstring in a scrollable window.\nYou can also send it to the pager which gives you way to view two signatures/docstrings at the same time. IMHO, the ideal UI here would be to be able to \"pin\" the tooltip so that it became a movable/draggable  floating, window and you could pin as many tooltips as you wanted to your workspace.\nJust some thoughts I've been mulling over, also in respect to the jupyterlab tooltip discussion\n. \n.

Exit status 1\nI'm behind a proxy but I've configured yarn for the proxy so I'm not sure what else to do :|\nIs this a known issue? Has anyone actually been able to build the latest version on win64?. I've found that javascript and Windows paths can often cause issues. I don't really have the JS chops to debug it myself though :/\n. The last build I did with npm worked. After the change to yarn I haven't been able to build on Windows which was why I was curious if anyone had been able to or if it was something specific to my setup. I just updated nteract to the latest git master, updated yarn to the latest 0.24.4 and the build worked. So maybe there was an issue with Yarn on Windows which has now been fixed?. Pretty low priority I'd imagine but I think it's useful to have an issue to at least record it.. It would still be nice to have feature parity with the notebook/jupyterlab. Just tested and it works great with Ctrl-Space so I'll close this as resolved.\n\nI suppose the real issue here is the supporting of tab for completion (we have an issue somewhere for that...)\n\nI found a couple of issues #963, #1870 - nothing specific about tab-completion.. xref: #263 . This is still the case in the latest 0.3.2. Just pinging this issue to make sure it hasn't been forgotten...\nBy-and-large I find nteract pretty slick! ...but I'm hesitant to recommend it to less experienced colleagues if the standard ? help functionality doesn't work - that's pretty important for new users.. With the latest 0.8.4 I still can't seem to bring up the function signature tooltip. Do you know the key combo for windows - I can't seem to trigger it. \nIt would be nice if it were Shift-Tab as in jupyterlab to better make use of muscle memory. . Potentially dup of #1584.\nI'd really like to have this functionality so I'm wondering if this is a new-contributor friendly issue or if it requires a deeper understanding of the nteract architecture? The initial goal would be to just add some hard-coded shortcuts and punt on the customization part for now.. I'm not advocating for a Command Mode for nteract as I know and understand the reasons why the core devs don't want to go down that route, however in the notebook the command mode allows you to perform operations on the cells themselves which can be a huge productivity boost as compared to having to use the mouse.\nMy suggestion would be to have operations which act on the cells themselves to use the Ctrl-Shift modifier. The three most important shortcuts I'd like to add would then be:\n * Ctrl-Shift-A - Add cell above\n * Ctrl-Shift-B - Add cell below\n * Ctrl-Shift-D - Delete cell\nYou could keep Ctrl-Shift-N as an alias for Ctrl-Shift-B but I think having the shortcuts mirror those of the notebook gives a huge benefit in terms of muscle memory and makes transitioning between JupyterLab, the classic Notebook and nteract much easier.\nOther shortcuts which would be useful:\n * Ctrl-Shift-Y - Change cell to code\n * Ctrl-Shift-M - Change cell to markdown\n * Ctrl-Shift-R - Change cell to raw\nDragging and dropping cells is a nice UI but it would also be good to have keyboard shortcuts to do the same. My suggestion would be that Ctrl-Shift-{click} would allow you to select one or multiple cells and then Ctrl-Shift-C would copy them, Ctrl-Shift-X would cut them and Ctrl-Shift-V would paste any copied cells.\nMy initial goal and highest value-added (for me) would be to just implement A/B/D. Would be interested to hear your thoughts on the above ideas and the concept of using Ctrl-Shift to indicate operations on cells.. I see Ctrl-Shift-X will cut a cell - cool! I can't seem to paste cells though with Ctrl-Shift-V or even just Ctrl-V\n\nWould \"add cell\" default to code or to what your last cell type was?\n\nI'd just follow what JupyterLab does in this instance to minimize any cognitive dissonance when switching\n\nSince movement between cells can be done with only up/down alone, I'd be tempted to use ctrl-shift-up to create cells?\n\nSimilarly, I'd be inclined to not stray too far from the shortcuts already used in the notebook - hence my suggestion of A/B. I could just be particularly bad at context-switching but I do currently find myself constantly polluting my nteract notebooks with random As and Bs! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \nAssuming you can select multiple cells I would use Ctrl-Shift-Up to include the cell above in the current selection if the current selection was above the anchor cell or to remove the last cell from the selection if the selection was below the anchor cell and vice-versa for Ctrl-Shift-Down\nSince that's probably as clear as mud, here's a gif of the intended behaviour:\n\n...i.e. Ctrl-Shift-Up/Down should behave similarly to extending a selection of cells in a spreadsheet using Shift-Up/Down\nCtrl-Home would be a useful shortcut to go to the top of the document.. NB: I'm running the latest nteract release on Windows - 0.2.0. I'll add another - Ctrl-Shift-Z undo last cell operation . In particular, undo delete cell :sob: .

There's also nothing shown in the developer tools console when you click on it.\nAlso, the \"Interrupt Running Kernel\" menu item doesn't appear to do anything. Again, there's no error in the JS console. Tested with:\npython\nx = 1\nwhile True:\n    x += 1\n...I had to restart the kernel to get out of that one.\nSo, sorry to be the bearer of bad news  :disappointed: \nOn the plus side, nothing new is broken and the help does now work great! :smile: . Always happy to test on Windows... it would probably be more useful if I tested before release  though :thinking: . @lgeiger - see also my follow-up testing in #1964. Code for repro:\n```python\nfrom numpy.random import randn\nimport pandas as pd\ndates = pd.date_range('01-Jan-2018', '01-Feb-2018')\ndf = pd.DataFrame(randn(dates.size, 3), dates, list('ABC'))\ndf.T\n``\nI'd create a gif  but it would just show my mouse cursor moving left and right :|.s/Runtime/Kernel/`?\nMaybe group kernels by language:\n * New Notebook\n    * Python\n      - Python Kernel 1\n      - Python Kernel 2\n    * R\n      - R Kernel\n    * Julia\n      - Julia Kernel\n\nRuntime\nRestart & Run All\nRestart & Clear All Outputs\n. That's fine - UI testing is very, very hard IMHO - especially in the face of large refactors. Sometimes the best you can do is to get a release out and fix the problems as they arise. Having the auto-updating makes it very easy for the users to upgrade and get any fixes. Hopefully the release process isn't too onerous for the devs!. Closing as fixed in 0.4.2!. Just reopening because I've noticed that whilst the currently executing cell is denoted with an *, if you queue up the execution of cells after that it's not indicated by anything. In the notebook/jupyterlab each cell you queue up gets an * so you know which are pending to run.. Just a note to say that both issues are present in the latest 0.4.1.\n\n\n\nAt least #2099 is fully reproducible by converting a cell to markdown then clicking on it.. Sorry for the trickle of bug reports but thanks for the quick fixes! I think the major issues have been addressed so no need to rush out another release for this one - it's just a mild annoyance.. Looks like this might also solve #1987?. I'm seeing this too - just hadn't worked out a reliable repro to post.... Hmm, heisenbug - can't repro at the moment. But will check the console if it crops up again.... NB: When I open nteract I see the same blank error as in #2346. And maybe when switching/restarting the kernel too.\nAfter opening nteract and seeing the error the console looks like:\n\nObjecterror: truepayload: Error: no parent_header.msg_id on message\n    at e._next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/webpacked-notebook.js:1:545819)\n    at e.__tryOrUnsub (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:8517)\n    at e.next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:7795)\n    at e._next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:6850)\n    at e.next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:6521)\n    at e._next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:6850)\n    at e.next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:6521)\n    at e.next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:11531)\n    at e._next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:6850)\n    at e.next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:6521)message: \"no parent_header.msg_id on message\"stack: \"Error: no parent_header.msg_id on message\u21b5    at e._next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/webpacked-notebook.js:1:545819)\u21b5    at e.__tryOrUnsub (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:8517)\u21b5    at e.next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:7795)\u21b5    at e._next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:6850)\u21b5    at e.next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:6521)\u21b5    at e._next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:6850)\u21b5    at e.next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:6521)\u21b5    at e.next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:11531)\u21b5    at e._next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:6850)\u21b5    at e.next (file:///C:/Program%20Files/nteract/resources/app.asar/lib/vendor.js:1:6521)\"__proto__: Objectconstructor: function Error()message: \"\"name: \"Error\"toString: function toString()__proto__: Objecttype: \"ERROR\"__proto__: Objectconstructor: function Object()hasOwnProperty: function hasOwnProperty()isPrototypeOf: function isPrototypeOf()propertyIsEnumerable: function propertyIsEnumerable()toLocaleString: function toLocaleString()toString: function toString()valueOf: function valueOf()__defineGetter__: function __defineGetter__()__defineSetter__: function __defineSetter__()__lookupGetter__: function __lookupGetter__()__lookupSetter__: function __lookupSetter__()get __proto__: function __proto__()set __proto__: function __proto__()\n(anonymous) @ webpacked-notebook.js:1.

Also, that idea about exposing a class for running cells is fantastic; I'd gladly move the stripes to that class!\n. Oh, not a matter of hard-to-do at all!\nThe trouble is the way that CSS is loaded. Here, the theme CSS is added first (via src/notebook/components/notebook.js) and the main stylesheet is loaded after (via src/notebook/index.js). CSS is cascading, so (assuming equally-specific selectors) the value declared last wins. To make the theme changes \"win\", we need to either get more specific (like prepending the .notebook class or adding !important after the value). If the CSS files were reordered so that the theme CSS came last, the theme would override the main CSS without additional selectors/specificity.\nI just did some quickie testing on my end and variables can be used (in main.css) before they are declared (in the theme's CSS), so we should be safe to change the order!\n. @rgbkrk Absolutely!\n.

I guess I'll have to be faster next time.\nThanks again, I appreciate it\n. Thanks for the feedback, @rgbkrk! \nI have tried to make the changes you suggested. Please forgive me if I made a mistake anywhere -- I had never rebased before. \nLet me know if there is anything further I can do. \nThanks! \n. Sorry about that, will do better in the future. Thanks for the reference, I definitely needed a better understanding on rebasing. \nThanks for understanding and fixing it up for me!\n. Thanks so much, excited to help out!\nWhat would you recommend for adding flow to other components, one at a time (with PR for each) or add it to multiple components and submit one PR?

Thanks @peggyrayzis! \nHappy to have help from someone with more flow experience.\n. I'm happy to try and tackle this. \n.

Hi @Carreau,\nKite looks really cool! I'd be happy to give this a shot if you would be open to some mentoring (I suspect I could learn a lot from this). \nThanks!\n. OK, I appreciate that. I'm still waiting for my invite from kite for now.\n. I'm happy to work on this. I'll submit a [WIP] PR for some feedback from everyone later tonight.\n. Hi @captainsafia\nI just submitted a PR for this (#1001). Can you check it over when you get a chance and let me know what you think? For some reason, the notebooks don't always open \ud83d\ude15. \nThanks! \n. My pleasure, will do!\n. Just realized there are some linting issues. Fixing up now, sorry!\n. OK, changed to this: \njsx\nconst exampleNotebooksDirectory = path.resolve(path.join(__dirname, '..',\n    '..', 'example-notebooks'));\nLooks kind of ugly, but no screaming from the linter. Is this OK?\n. I like the looks of that much better, thanks!\n. I noticed when writing out some directions for this that there is not a way to create a markdown cell from the menu/keyboard shortcut. I would be happy to add this as a feature if you're interested (keyboard shortcuts for markdown is something I use all the time in jupyter). What do you think?\n. Thanks, thrilled to help!\nThe key binding I registered for new markdown cell is shift CmdorCtrl M in #1034\n. Also, is there a specific name for what I called the \"hover menu\"?\n. git commit -m \"feat(tacoTada): add accomplishment taco \ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf2e \"\nThanks @captainsafia!\n. Hi @captainsafia! \nThanks for your suggestion! When I add that, I still get the same 6 errors. Adding a second connected component seems to introduce a lot of issues for the original connected component, too. Also, @jdetle was kind enough to work with me last night and pointed out that these changes currently break toggleOutputExpansion. Maybe I am approaching this in the wrong way? I appreciate any advice you have. \nThanks!\n. Thanks @captainsafia and @rgbkrk. I understand the general idea of what you are saying, but not entirely clear on implementing it. With what you're suggesting, would I remove the connect() completely and revert to dumb compnent?\nI will continue to plug away at it, thanks!\n. OK, I think this is finally clear to me. \n. WooWoo, it finally works and passes tests \ud83c\udf89 \n@captainsafia @jdetle @rgbkrk I appreciate all your input so much. You folks rock!!\nThe only thing now to address is toggleOutputExpansion. Any suggestions?\n. Thanks John! At the moment, I pass expanded to the display like this:\njsx\n              <Output\n                key={index}\n                output={output}\n                displayOrder={order}\n                transforms={tf}\n                theme={this.props.theme}\n                expanded={this.props.expanded}\n              />\nIs there a different way I can hand this down that won't override the toggleOutputExpansion? Every way I have tried so far breaks functionality. Is it an issue with not being able to hand anything back up the component tree?\n. I tried out the new default expansion and it is does accomplish what I hoped this PR would do, but better (and in a better way). I agree that it makes more sense to stick with that rather than make the code more complex. \nThanks for letting me work through this, anyway (I learned a lot!). Thanks to everyone for their help. \n. My pleasure!\n. Awesome, @souravsingh!\nIn addition to what @lgeiger said, some logistical things to keep in mind: you will want to follow the contributor guidelines here. \nAnd once you have it you can add it to the menu with something like:\njsx\n  {\n    label: 'One-Dark',\n    click: createSender('menu:theme', 'one-dark'),\n  },\nSomething to potentially keep in mind: I think the syntax highlighting from CodeMirror isn't necessarily as advanced as what you might see in something like Atom (I am thinking anecdotally/specifically of Python syntax and the variables/built-ins/keywords). Someone correct me if I am wrong here \ud83d\ude09. \nCould also possibly be a good opportunity for a PR over in CodeMirror.\nOnce you finish, you will want to check for linting errors with: \nbash\n./node_modules/.bin/eslint <Name-of-File-Changed>\nand confirm that tests still pass with:\nbash\nnpm run test\n. To be clear, I am not suggesting changing anything with CI, just also running these things locally to expedite PRs.\n. Ooh good idea, I hadn't considered adding it to default testing. Do you think something like something like this might be appropriate?\nnode\n    \"posttest\": \"npm run lint\",\n\nOh you're saying adding some text to the contributing guide - also super cool\n\nNice, I can add an extra step to npm run test after #5 in contributing.md \n. Ahh good catch. Thanks Kyle!\n. My pleasure, thanks for the help!\n. Closed by #1222\n. My pleasure!\n. I find this feature super useful, too. @rgbkrk I'd be happy to work on this if you wouldn't mind helping me get started.. This is really thorough, thanks Kyle! I'll work on a first draft and submit a WIP (with copious questions \ud83d\ude05) over the next couple of days.\nThanks!!.

Hi @laymonk, thanks for your question!\nIf you are building from source, you can create a custom theme by adding it to  styles and naming it theme-laymonk.css. \nAnd once you have done that you can add it to the menu with something like:\njsx\n  {\n    label: 'Laymonk',\n    click: createSender('menu:theme', 'laymonk'),\n  },\nThen install and restart.. My pleasure @laymonk, thanks for using nteract \ud83c\udf89.  Your feedback is really valuable!. Related to/duplicate of #1090.\nThanks for bringing this up again. I've definitely experienced losing my work and wished I had been able to save myself from myself \ud83d\ude05.. Forgot to say, the key binding is Cmd-.. Also, looks like CI failing from Cannot find module '@nteract/transforms' (besides flow). Is there somewhere I need to list @nteract/transforms as a dependency or do something else with it?. Oops, I seem to have created a conflict.. # UI First Draft\n\n\nSorry for the poor quality gif, which looks a bit fatter than intended -- guess I am a bit rusty with ffmpeg \ud83d\ude05. \nThis is just a first pass and meant to get the ball rolling on UI. Pressing the command launches it on the bottom of the notebook and closes it. I also included a button to close just to have the option to play with later.\nFormatting Issue\nI didn't use the addWidget from codemirror since, if I understand it right, it would have restricted the display to within the cell and I had a hard time making that work. One issue, however, is that with addWidget, the display is formatted how it should be (with whitespace included), but with insertbefore (what I am using here) it seems to strip this whitespace.\nMainly just starting to throw some ideas around here to see what might be useful/attractive to the user. I'll continue adding some ideas as I get the chance. Feedback most welcome \ud83d\ude04.\n. Same, now with new and improved gif \ud83d\ude04\n\n. Hi All,\nThanks for the feedback so far! This [W] is very much [IP] at the moment, so I think it might be safer to wait a little bit before merging.\n\nHave you tried using the notification system? Curious to see how that would look too.\n\nI have not yet, but I will definitely look into it, thanks!\n\nIf we merge this in as is, I must say that I'm not a fan of having this in a pager at the bottom. I much prefer the inline display shown in Jupyter for inspection.\n\nTo be honest, I am 100% with you on this @rgbkrk. Chucking a ? or ?? at a function in Jupyter and having it pop up on the bottom was always too disruptive for me to find it comfortable using and I ultimately stopped doing it. Then when I discovered the tooltip, I was very much \ud83d\ude0d. I started with the bottom version after hitting a small roadblock inline and since it was the easiest to implement (at least roughly), I figured it would be good way to get the ball rolling. I am working on an inline version and will share once I've got it working. Thanks again for all your help on this!\nThanks everyone for the feedback, very much appreciated!\n. ## Inline\nHere was the inline iteration. The place where I got stuck was how to make the cell expand and retract as needed. To get this I manually expanded the cell by pressing return before the video.\n\n. ## UI Update\n\nInline render\nI've now got the inline widget expanding/retracting the cell as needed. \n\nIn particular I like that it only shows the signature / first line initially as some docstrings can be huge and so would be unwieldy in a tooltip. You can expand the tooltip to see the full docstring in a scrollable window.\n\nThanks very much for your thoughts, @dhirschfeld! I really like this functionality, too. The gif shows how it can be annoying to automatically expand a large docstring -- I will try to incorporate handling this going forward.\n\nYou can also send it to the pager which gives you way to view two signatures/docstrings at the same time. IMHO, the ideal UI here would be to be able to \"pin\" the tooltip so that it became a movable/draggable floating, window and you could pin as many tooltips as you wanted to your workspace.\n\nI like the idea of potentially making it draggable/sticky. The limitation for this at the moment is that it is rendered inline in the cell, but I am definitely open to exploring it.\nAdditionally, I like @Carreau's idea of using css to break outside the cell (instead of expanding it), but have had trouble making it happen with the css. I'll keep trying, though -- thanks @Carreau! \n@rgbkrk @jdetle Do you have thoughts on a particular direction you might like to see this go in?\nThanks again to everyone for all your input! \nPS I'm getting better at gifs \ud83d\ude09 . @Carreau, you are right! I don't know how I missed that before, but that is really helpful. I will try to iterate around that. Thanks so much!. ## Update\nIt's not perfect, but it's looking better now. Once the tests are fixed up (and assuming I didn't blow the rebase \ud83d\ude2c), it might be in an OK place to merge (and continue iterating on design). Thoughts?\n\n\n. Awesome, thanks Kyle!. I'll try and clean up the flow issues this weekend. Thank you both!\nI am happy to go either way, although I don't fully understand the implications of how changing the transform interface would affect the other parts of the codebase that utilize it. . Oops -- did prettier make all those extra changes automatically (I only changed the .flowconfig and wrapper.js)?. Actually, just realized I think those extra changes were from when I pulled in the changes after the prettier adoption -- I think I accidentally just pulled in the changes and committed instead of rebasing.. Rats, it looks like the issue is still there. Do you think it's because I had forgotten to rebase after fetching in fb3050ca83846855ccdd34e5ab650122238f1ccf? Would I have wanted to cut that one out somehow and then fetch and rebase? I kept a local copy with that history in case I mix anything up here.. Thanks, that would be great to screenshare, do you have time this afternoon?. My pleasure! Absolutely, sorry I hadn't realized they were separate.. Hi @amueller,\nThanks for testing nteract! I think the following should work, but someone else please add to it if I missed something.\nDev install\nTo install the dev version so that you can just double click a notebook to open, you can run the following command,\nbash\nnpm run dist\nAnd then install the package from the newly created dist directory. After that you should be able to double click a notebook.\nKernels\nUnfortunately, virtualenv and conda env kernels are not installed by default, but you can install one in the following way,\n\nFirst, activate the env (example with conda below with env named amueller)\nbash\nsource activate amueller\nThen, install the kernel,\nbash\npython -m ipykernel install --name amueller --display-name \"Python scikit-rocks\"\nwhere amueller is the internal Jupyter name and Python scikit-rocks is the name that will actually be displayed.. Thanks greenkeeper!. My pleasure!. Thanks Lukas!. Thanks!. >You may also need to add the module to our webpack config (look where zeromq is listed).\n\nOK, I will play around with this.\n\nLOL, amsters, love those hamsters.\n\nHaha, thought you would like that \ud83d\ude04.. haha I know, I don't like it either \ud83d\ude2d. \n\nOr we ask the git-utils team if they would be interested in providing prebuilt binaries via prebuild\n\nI like this idea. If this is something they are not interested in doing, is it something we could do on our own (or is that even reasonable?). I want to avoid reverting #1268, so if not maybe this is not the right approach for git. \nWould it instead be appropriate (or even preferable), to write a custom script that accesses the user's own git client (and disables the functionality if they don't have git installed)? \nThanks Lukas!. My pleasure!. Thanks Lukas!. I think you're right, that is prettier.\nGood catch, thanks @jkornblum! . Thanks!. Thanks for the patience everyone, I will have some time tomorrow and will revisit this.\nPS @rgbkrk I am PSYCHED about papermill; what a fantastic idea!. Thanks @rgbkrk! Really excited to be able to work with you all again \ud83d\ude04. . ### Update\n- removed the placeholder user\n- git operations are now all epics\n- added notifications\n- added a menu option to copy a users global .gitconfig to the local repo\n- moved the branch determination to a selector (not really sure where this should go exactly, but it didn't seem right in the status bar file \ud83e\udd14). ### Update\n- moved currentBranch to app level of state\n  - branch is checked on save/saveAs actions\n- fixed up flow\n- next, I think general clean up & adding tests \ud83d\ude01. Hm, I am not sure why the test is failing here. It says the snapshots need to be updated, but I have done that with npm t -- --updateSnapshot and updated the PR \ud83e\udd14.. Ah that did it, thanks!. Oops, was fiddling around with flow errors before I saw this \ud83d\ude05 . That is a good idea, I will give it a shot tomorrow \ud83d\udc4d. I had noticed the logo behavior, but didn't think to mimic it -- I like it!. @rgbkrk I think that idea is better and keeps things more simple,  I could close this in favor of #2890 instead \ud83d\udc4d . Closing in favor of #2890 \ud83d\ude04 . Good thinking, that looks better with those changes. I opened #2895 \ud83d\udc4d . Since most browsers block pop-ups, a new notebook is created in the window that is already opened (tree view), so closing cannot happen from a new script. At the moment, this PR will only close a notebook that is being reopened. Unless we change how a notebook is opened, this might be better off closed for now and revisited in the future \ud83e\udd14.. Should default be expanded or collapsed?. Ahh I have been wondering how to update those! Haha, made up Kyle heuristic sounds good to me \ud83d\ude04. Sounds good, though!. Awesome, looks great! My pleasure to help \ud83d\ude04 . >I think we probably want to use a React transition group to make sure to animate when saving is rather fast, so we don't have a flicker. \nOo I like that idea a lot -- the flicker was definitely too fast to get much from.\nAnd that makes sense to create a new library for the iron-icons. I will create a couple of issues to track these ideas \ud83d\udc4d.\nThanks! . Great idea, thanks @rgbkrk! . Thanks!. We're glad you like nteract, @matanster! \nThis is currently being tracked in #1817, so I am going to go ahead and close this (but feel free to reopen in case I misunderstood). Thanks for the report!. Hi @matanster, thanks for using nteract!\nIn the menu bar, if you click \"nteract\", you will see the following:\n\nClicking \"Install Shell Commands\" will do what you are asking. After you have done that, from a new shell you can just nteract mynotebook.ipynb. That's a great point, thanks @matanster!  . :shipit:. Thanks @rgbkrk, that would be great! A couple of questions -- \nI am wondering about the design of <DirectoryListing>. Since commuter's directory-listing has only the tree view, it is easy enough to just incorporate that directly into this package (which I have done locally). If we do it that way, then for Jext, we could use the connected component we have already that would do the NewNotebookNavigation stuff plus get the actual contents of the directory and then be handed down as props to <DirectoryListing contents={this.props.contents} basepath={this.props.host.basePath} />. Is this the direction we want this to go in?\nCould you also help me get started on testing  \ud83d\ude2c?\nStyling help would also be much appreciated. With the compound component pattern I had to move it around and now it's just all over the place \ud83d\ude43. Do we want to include a theme that can do jext and commuter styles (like exists in commuter)?\n. >NewNotebookNavigation should be its own component, not part of the directory listing component.\nSorry, I don't think I explained what I meant correctly -- I wasn't suggesting including the  NewNotebookNavigation as part of this package. What I meant with \n\nwe could use the connected component we have already that would do the NewNotebookNavigation stuff\n\nwas to use the existing directory listing app and include the new<DirectoryListing contents={this.props.contents} /> from @nteract/directory-listing there.\n\nSince these are visual components, I'd start with using jest snapshots. That way you can write declarative tests and just make sure the \"rendered\" versions look like the right output.\n\nAwesome, I will do this \ud83d\ude04 . What about passing the routers and basepath as props instead? I tooled around a bit with that last night and it worked OK. It allows us to have just the one <DirectoryListing>, but I am not sure if this is a desirable or expected pattern \ud83e\udd14. It might over complicate things unnecessarily, though \ud83d\ude2c. I'll commit/push and let me know what you think.. Hm, not actually sure why this failed \ud83e\udd14. I think this is starting to be in pretty good shape now, but styling isn't quite right yet. . 99.999999% there, but I cannot seem to get the scoping right on the styles for <Listing>. I can only make it work by adding global, but I know that's not right \ud83d\ude43. What's the way out here?. That is awesome, thanks Kyle!. ### Commuter\n\nJext\n\n. Ahh good thinking. I added padding to match commuter too -->\n\n\n. > should take children rather than as a link prop, especially since we really use it as a child element.\nThat definitely makes sense, thanks! And that structure is cleaner/more professional \ud83d\udc4d.\nAre entry.md and listing.md for the react style guide? \n. Rats, I forgot that TODO was still there and boty \ud83e\udd16 is going to be yelling at me with each commit.. Ahh, gotcha. I can give that a shot \ud83d\udc4d . After discussing offline with @rgbkrk, I decided to try refactoring this so that Name, Icon and LastSaved would become separate components outside of Entry. Although a little larger, I think I like this much better \ud83e\udd17. The type annotations are more clear and the relationship between the components more explicit.. Great, will do. Thanks so much for all the help on this, Kyle!\n:shipit: . Works great on my end, too. Awesome to have a fix for this \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks @gnestor! . My pleasure!. Not passing circle at the moment because of flow, which doesn't like the simplified rxjs imports \ud83e\udd14 . >It's a low hanging fruit - and it will allow me to participate in the sprints from my gaming rig :)\nI do not know about everybody else, but I do not have access to a pc, so this is awesome! Windows support is vital. Thanks @jdfreder! . Thanks \ud83d\ude04 . Thanks @rgbkrk! . ## Update\n- fixed logo and much sharper \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\ude0e \n- included white logo for dark menu bar and windows\n\n\nThanks for the feedback and looking this over, @rgbkrk and @BenRussert! . Certainly!. Haha, good catch!  \ud83d\udd0c. Nice, thanks!. Thanks for tackling this, @BenRussert! I will test this out on mac tonight.. Hi @zaeemnalla, thanks for taking nteract for a spin!\nThe keyboard shortcut for this is control + period: \"Ctrl-.\"\nNote: you have to click the \"X\" in the upper right corner of the documentation to close.. You're very welcome. As far as I am aware, our only other non-menu-shortcuts are here.\nWe would love to have you contribute, @zaeemnalla! In fact, next week we will be having a global sprint (remote participation encouraged) and one major initiative is all about docs. This would definitely be good to have documented and is a great time to start contributing \ud83d\ude04 .. Good thinking, I will change it right away. Would you mind walking me through the best way to do this commit-wise (should I just do another commit and then rebase?).\nThanks!\n. Absolutely, happy to!\n. Will do!\n. Happy to, what would you suggest for commit message, chore, test, refactor (would have asked in person but had to leave early today, sorry)?\n. Thanks Kyle! I figured it was something with resolving the path. \nSince it looks like we already import the path at the top, this is what I have at the moment:\njsx\nconst exampleNotebooksDirectory = path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', 'example-notebooks');\nat the top. And then changing the launch of the notebooks to:\njsx\nlaunch(`${exampleNotebooksDirectory}/geojson.ipynb`);\nIf you're comfortable with this I'll make the changes to the rest and commit. \nThanks!\n. It loads up and the linter likes it \ud83d\ude38 \n. Ah good catch! Thanks for the patience with someone so new to react. I definitely wouldn't want to discourage Windows users (even if it makes me cry on the inside \ud83d\ude09 ).\nThanks Kyle!\n. OK, I'll fix it up and submit a new PR. Thanks!\n. Great point from @willingc, spotlight probably won't register with many users. \nWould it also be helpful to link to all the current available Jupyter kernels here (like this Jupyter kernels)?\n. Haha, true,  that would be more efficient \ud83d\ude38 \n. OK, I will make sure to note that. \n. Just to double check, something like this instead?\nFile\n    \u2b91  Open\n          \u2b91  Open\n. Great, thanks!\n. Hm, it looks like it did fail with AppVeyor. What should I do?\n. Oh OK, thanks Lukas!\n. That's a good idea, now that you mention it it does feel a little clunky going through two drop down menus. I'd be happy to change it (in nteract menu & here) if you'd like\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Definitely!\n. \ud83d\ude01. Thanks @rgbkrk, you rock!\nSo now I think all the plumbing is in place. Here is the updated transformed output:\n\nIf this looks good, I will start to think about UI.\nThanks as always!\n. Me too! Now the real challenge begins..\ud83d\ude05. Absolutely, it can autodetect from the local .git/config file currently (in the future, they plan to scan for a global config, but for now it's just the local). We can definitely help them set it up. I'd ideally like to have a config option under the menu, but with not being able to do prompts currently maybe it would have to be just an informational one that shows what's needed and where to put it. Or maybe it could put a template in the right place and direct them to add their name/email?. Perfect! I knew this was not the right way to do it \ud83d\ude05 , I will work on trying to change this tonight.. Haha, I might be obsessed... \ud83d\ude04 . Sorry, which ones do you mean? Do you mean type DisplayDataOutput should be type displayDataOutput?. Oh gotcha, no problem!. Do you mean like common.MultilineString and common.demultiline like with the stream text?. Do you mean something like this?\njs\nimport type { JupyterMessage } from \"@nteract/messaging\";\n.\n.\n.\n/**\n * Turn any output that was in JupyterMessage into a record\n */\nexport function outputFromMessage(msg: JupyterMessage<any,any>): OutputRecord {\n  switch (msg.header.msg_type) {\n    case stream.StreamType:\n      return stream.streamRecordFromMessage(msg);\n    case displayData.DisplayDataType:\n      return displayData.displayDataRecordFromMessage(msg);\n    case executeResult.ExecuteResultType:\n      return executeResult.executeResultRecordFromMessage(msg);\n    case error.ErrorType:\n      return error.errorRecordFromMessage(msg);\n    default:\n      // $FlowAllowFeatureDetection: At runtime, allow fallback\n      return unrecognized.unrecognizedRecordFromMessage(msg);\n  }\n}\nIf this is the right direction, I am not sure what the correct arguments for JupyterMessage<,> should be , though, as flow doesn't like these one bit..\ud83e\udd14 \nAlso, what would be the right default? Would we make a unrecognized.unrecognizedRecordFromMessage function?. Right, I am not sure of a way out here without Immutable.List, but that makes sense and it would be good if we could find a way.. \ud83d\udc4d. I apologize if I am mistaken, but do we need these two * imports?. Hm, I am not quite sure what you mean here. Are you saying you have this ->\n```js\nimport { LocalHostStorage } from \"@mybinder/host-cache\";\nconst lhs = new LocalHostStorage();\n``\nin here twice because you only export the component in host-storage?. When the developer calls this to cleanup, does that mean to clean the localStorate up? If so, would we need to also calllocalStorage.removeItem()orlocalStorage.clear()?. Oops, didn't realize that wasn't actually doing anything \ud83d\ude05 . \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d I like how easy that makes moving them around too. Nice, this definitely makes things look cleaner! Do you mean we should use thiscomponent in commuter's existingdirectory-listing(as opposed to the new one in this package)? Would we then use the...interface directly in Jext's existingdirectory.js(instead of using the new` from this package)?. OK gotcha, thanks! I'll give this a shot late tonight/tomorrow \ud83c\udf19 \ud83d\ude04 . Thank you \ud83d\ude01 \ud83c\udf89 . I really appreciate all the help on this. It can be difficult for me to see the larger picture sometimes, and I think this really looks/feels much cleaner than what I was initially thinking \ud83d\ude04 . Oh awesome, I didn't realize that -- will remove that this weekend \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\ude04 . Definitely \ud83d\udc4d! I think I am loving everything about react styleguidist \ud83d\ude04 . \ud83d\udc4dI definitely prefer camel case \ud83d\ude04 . Haha, this was making me a bit bonkers that the time was awkwardly hovering above everything. Nice thinking \ud83d\udc4d . I like this idea! For people who struggle with styling (like me, for example \ud83d\ude05) , I think this interface actually makes it easier \ud83d\ude04 . Nice catch \ud83d\udc4d . That's a good point, none of the others on my machine show anything either. Will remove \ud83d\udc4d . Oops, sorry about that \ud83d\ude2c!. I tried to move too fast \ud83d\ude05 . I am loving this new interface. It is so much clearer!. >\"it is love we must hold on to\\nnever easy but we try\"\nIs this Beauty and the Beast :lion:?. Ahh, this makes more sense to me now \ud83d\udc4d . \u2744\ufe0f . I think we can remove the immer import here and in error.js, since we are using Object.freeze instead. Is the reason for using Object.freeze that we don't need the stronger immutability of immer for streamOutput and errorOutput since we aren't modifying these outputs?. I love this! It is so much easier to understand this way \ud83d\udc4f.. Possible typo here?\n\n\"media types types\" . \ud83d\ude02 . Definitely good idea to note this \ud83d\udc4d . Right, I think I get what you guys are saying. That will definitely help simplify this \ud83d\udc4d. Will give it a shot tonight \ud83d\ude04  . You sent a PR? I don't I received it \ud83d\ude2c. Was it through slack? . This is a more clear name, too \ud83d\ude42 . Incorporating this means mixing our immer state (or I guess I should say our immutable state) with our Immutable state. At least immer objects are already JS, but I worry this fromJS(...toJS()) seems like it could be costly \ud83e\udd14. . Had to import as a different name here as we already have a reducer (in which this function is used) named appendOutput.. OK good, that definitely makes sense \ud83d\udc4d . This is great, @rgbkrk & @ivanov! I'm really liking this compositional style in general \ud83d\udc4d.  . Love watching this little one float on by. Reminds me of webpages I made about a 1000 years ago \ud83d\ude42 . Good thinking, more concise \ud83d\udc4d . We could also think about doing a named export here to match the other outputs components, but looks good \ud83d\udc4d . Ah gotcha, I think I see what you're saying \ud83d\udc4d . I like that idea \ud83d\udc4d . I was, good catch @BenRussert! Thank you \ud83d\ude04  . That's a good idea. I'll investigate \ud83d\udc4d . This was the only issue that jumped out at me. disabled={!editable}, nice idea @BenRussert \ud83d\udc4d-- the greyed out button looks more consistent this way.   . \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udcaffor animals \ud83d\ude04 . Since this is testing the update if the theme changes, would we want to include the theme change here with something like <Media.JSON data={population} theme=\"dark\" />?. Nice \ud83d\udc4d . This seems like the simplest way to add the styles, but to echo @captainsafia's point, it would be nice if we didn't have to pass in the whole css for each. . What are we thinking for how we want testing to work here? Since each wrapped component is tested on Blueprint's end, do we assume that they are unit/integration tested there and we just do snapshots for our wrapped versions?. \n",

Sorry, I'll make a note of that for next time :)\n. Anytime! \ud83d\ude04 I checked the build log and it looks like there's still some errors stemming from flow-typed. I'm going to work on fixing those today before I start on the Redux code.\n. I didn't realize that flow wasn't failing the builds either until I saw the ref errors pop up after your PR. Should be an easy fix though.\nI'm happy to draft up a quick flow style guide for the team if you would like. Flow is kinda weird when you first start using it & the docs are pretty confusing. \ud83d\ude15  The guide could help prevent new contributors from getting frustrated with flow build errors.\n. \ud83d\ude21  Travis is showing 4 Flow errors that aren't showing when I run Flow locally.

I'm going to mess around with it for one more day and try to use only their exported types, but if I can't get it to work, then we should def raise an issue.\n. Fixed the Flow errors but now we have a build problem! @rgbkrk any ideas as to why?\n. No prob! On to the Redux code \ud83d\ude80 !\n. I actually don't know if we need to. By using DragSource & DropTarget as our types, I believe it checks the subtypes of the monitor & connector through the third parameter (collect function) passed to the DropTarget/DragSource wrappers.\nWhat do you think?\n. Got it! \ud83c\udf89 I've never been so happy to see a failed build before! I'm going to clean up the error and remove the WIP flag.\n\n. Thanks so much for fixing this! \ud83d\udc4d \n. I changed the logic so CodeMirror solely handles clicking onto the editor, roughly based on Safia's earlier PR that you linked. The problem now is that we still need to keep some sort of focusing logic based on the editorFocused prop in componentDidMount/componentDidUpdate - otherwise, the editor won't focus properly when the user presses up/down or shift + enter.\n. I added the editorFocused logic back in componentDidMount/componentDidUpdate to preserve the up/down/shift+enter functionality. I think clicking works as expected now, but would love a second set of eyes to confirm!\n. Some weird stuff going on with the linter - AppVeyor fails because of this:\nC:\\projects\\nteract\\src\\notebook\\components\\cell\\cell.js\n  138:11  error  Expected indentation of 12 space characters but found 10  react/jsx-indent\n\u2716 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)\nWhen I fix the error and run the linter locally, I get this:\n/Users/mrayzis/projects/open-source/nteract/src/notebook/components/cell/cell.js\n  138:13  error  Expected indentation of 10 space characters but found 12  react/jsx-indent\nAny reason why there would be a conflict?\n. Whatever we decide, I want to make that function cleaner. \ud83d\ude1d The control flow is kinda nasty right now.. > Trying out the branch now, a couple things missing once this \"command mode\" is enabled - I'd like to be able to hit enter to get into edit mode in the cell as well as create new cells when at the bottom (like the current behavior).\nGood call. Just pushed some changes to fix both of these issues \ud83d\ude00 \nRendered MD cells are definitely funky in command mode right now because they handle their own key bindings at the cell level that conflict with the notebook level. This is going to take some work (possibly a new Redux action to toggle Command/Edit mode), so I wanted to get your opinion on the feature first before I started.. Here's the original message in Slack:\n\nI interpreted the issue with page down to mean that he wanted a way to scroll through the notebook without passing through the cells' editors. @jkornblum Was there anything else you noticed with page down?. We can revisit this later if necessary \ud83d\udc4d . > \ud83d\ude22 I like some of the scrolling, I wish there was a way to capture scrolling down the document on shift-enter in a way that is less obtrusive. People also use shift-enter as a way to go through a notebook and read their way through it.\nYou can still use shift-enter to read through the notebook, it's just that the default scroll behavior takes over instead of auto scrolling every cell to the top. If you check out my branch, what don't you like about the default behavior?. Thanks! Yeah, I still think the default needs some work too. \ud83d\ude1e The transition is still a little awkward & could use an animation w/ some easing to make it appear more fluid.. This is ready to go, I'll work on throttling soon :shipit: . Yeah it's pretty new! I'm willing to tackle this gradually throughout my provider refactor or offer help to a new contributor that wants to take this on. \ud83d\ude00 . Finally refactored those tests! \ud83c\udf89 Everything should be good to go now, except for the DnD test which we will refactor at a later date.. Awesome! Let me know if any questions pop up. \ud83d\ude00 . Welcome to the nteract party, @jurmarcusallen! \ud83c\udf89 . Closes #1287 . Also, thank you for typing all of this. I like having the types in records, I think it makes the code more discoverable \ud83d\ude00 . Yeah, I think it will definitely be useful as we start to type the reducers. Is this still WIP?. Keep me updated, it looks awesome!. Thanks for making the changes @jdetle! One step closer to completing #1288 \ud83d\ude00 . Facebook has something similar for their open source projects that might be easier to maintain. When you contribute (at least for React/React Native), they have a Github bot that analyzes git blame to identify and tag potential reviewers for your PR.\nhttps://github.com/facebook/mention-bot. Ready for merge \ud83d\ude00 . Feels awesome to merge this PR! Thanks for getting the ball rolling w/ typing the reducers \ud83d\udc4d . After the provider refactor, I think we should spend some time making our components more composable. Right now, we make a lot of assumptions about what a notebook should and should not have. For example, we embed the StatusBar into the Notebook but what if the end user wants to embed their own status bar? What if the user wants to display different buttons in the Cell Creator menu? Today, we don't support either of those use cases. I really like Victory as an example of a completely composable library - it makes no assumptions on what is included in a chart and leaves the decision completely up to the user.\nWe should also think about integrating our CSS into JS to allow users to pass in custom styles through a style prop that will override our defaults. I'm most familiar with Aphrodite because it's really similar to React Native StyleSheet, but I'm open to any other libraries here. Here's an example of what it would look like:\n```\n// our default\nconst ColoredDiv = ({}) => \nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({ coloredDiv: { backgroundColor: 'red' } })\n// we can concatenate their styles passed through the style prop onto our existing styles (it can take an array)\n// it works like object assign so whatever is last is what is rendered\n\n// div will render blue\n``. Thanks again for another great Flow PR \ud83c\udf89 !. Awesome! Thanks again for all your work on this feature. :shipit: . Really cool seeing a notebook used as documentation! \ud83d\udc4d It's super clear and informative.. Thanks for fixing this! Looks great \ud83d\udc4d . I'm going to add a couple more new tests to boost us even higher \ud83d\ude80 . Is eslint taking forever to run locally for you guys? It hangs for 3+ minutes before I have to kill it.. I actually tested settingnpm run linttoeslint .` as it was before, but it was still painfully slow for me. Maybe I'm just being impatient? \ud83d\ude06 . >@peggyrayzis what's the best way for us to ignore bad parts of definitions that come as part of the library (not in our flow-typed directory)?\nIt looks like Paul already fixed the issue, but I would put a line in the [ignore] section of .flowconfig like .*/node_modules/immutable/dist/.*. This is an OCaml regex, so it can can pick up on any subdirectories, like the directories in packages/, that also contain this file pattern.. I was hoping the output would be...prettier? \ud83d\ude48 I don't like how strict the max line length is and I'm not a fan of double quotes or semicolons.\nStandard is looking like a better option, which makes me sad because I really wanted to love Prettier.. That definitely could have been me, I pushed a refactor of editor yesterday. I'll take a look at it and push a quick fix this morning. \ud83d\ude0a. Thank you @dhirschfeld for reporting this \ud83d\udc1b! What is your desired behavior for pressing shift + tab (or de-indenting)?. > Shift-tab should de-indent. Are we overwriting something that codemirror would normally support out of the box?\nUnfortunately, Codemirror doesn't support highlighting + Tab to indent out of the box. Originally, we had a tabToSpaces function that converted our tabs to spaces & took care of the highlighting + Tab. Codemirror came out with a new option (insertSoftTab) that converts your tabs to spaces for you and I didn't end up checking that it supported highlighting + Tab.\nShift + tab currently de-indents to the beginning of the nearest code block.\n. Thanks for opening this, I really appreciate how detailed your bug reports are! \ud83d\ude00 \nThe default behavior for Shift+Tab is a little weird in Codemirror. It will de-indent up until the beginning of the proper indentation for that code block. I'm not well versed in Python, but I'm assuming that the for loop in your gif created a new code block, which is why you can't de-indent there. Here's a JS example so you can see what I mean - the curly braces indicate a new code block.\n\nI'm in support of overriding the default Shift+Tab to match the Jupyter notebook so the user experience is consistent. @rgbkrk what do you think?. Awesome, thank you both for your feedback! I'll have a fix up shortly.. No worries, I can make another PR!. @rgbkrk, idk why Github closed this automatically. I can reopen if you'd like?. I can take care of this, just completed the upgrade for MLS. I'll be posting a cool Gist later today w/ our Webpack 2 config + PWA support (code splitting, \ud83c\udf33  shaking, service worker). \ud83d\ude09  Shouldn't be too hard to figure out for nteract.. Just getting around to looking at this, it looks great! Thanks for extracting the editor package \ud83d\ude00 . @rgbkrk I was going to jump back on this after upgrading us to Webpack 2. Coming \ud83d\udd1c...HMR, working source maps, & an optimized build \ud83d\ude00. Ugh all my line numbers are all screwed up w/ this review \ud83d\ude21 . The React Element type is made up of the element itself, any props, keys, & refs: https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/master/lib/react.js#L121-L126\nI've never seen anyone declare these subtypes specifically, though.\n. Totally, I'll fix that w/ my next PR. I believe they have specific MouseEvent, KeyboardEvent, etc types - would you like me to get more specific?\n. Agreed. I'll update w/ my next PR :)\n. No biggie, do you want to merge first?\n. Haha oops, corrected the package name & added in flow-typed install. Hopefully this works :) !\n. @rgbkrk \ud83c\udf89 looks like the Travis build passed!\n. I aliased them because Flow has its own types for Lists & Maps:\nflow: https://github.com/facebook/flow/blob/v0.33.0/lib/core.js#L512-L527\nimmutable: https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/blob/master/dist/immutable.js.flow#L466-Lundefined\nI took out the alias to test and it still passes, but I thought it would be better to keep them separate because they look to be independent of each other. Do you know if they are fundamentally different? I haven't worked w/ Immutable much.\n. Thanks for looking into this & fixing it! \ud83d\udc4d  I had tried the one-liner before I submitted this PR with no success.\n. Ok cool, let's keep the alias then \ud83d\udc4d \n. Hahaha it was only a matter of time until I found some \ud83d\ude06 \n. Have you ran flow typed install yet? I think it's supposed to grab any available libdefs and import them automatically for us based on our npm packages.\nAs for which monitor, it looks like we're using several different monitors throughout the component:\nLines 52-53 could be any of the 3 since they all have a getClientOffset property. We should log out the monitor to see which one it is.\nThe monitor in lines 62-68 could be either DragLayerMonitor or DragSourceMonitor based on the isDragging prop.\nThe monitor in 70-75 is definitely the DropTargetMonitor based on the isOver prop.\n. Awesome! Stateless functional components are great and we should try to use more of them where possible in nteract.. We're actually listening to a DOM mouse event here instead of a React synthetic event, which is why it works so well \ud83d\ude09 . Hmm I'll look into this, thanks for pointing this out!. I think you could split the message action into two types here: COMM_MESSAGE_SENT (from UI to kernel) and COMM_MESSAGE_RECEIVED (kernel echoing back message to UI with updated value) to enforce separation of concerns.. Is this component like our ModelProvider that will talk to Redux and eventually render the UIView?. Ok awesome, it's all making sense now how this is fitting together. I'm going to draft up a quick gist today to nail down the component structure so we don't forget. Otherwise, this PR LGTM. \ud83d\udc4d . Everything is looking really great so far! One thing I think we should move to the ToolbarView is the ability to hide the dropdown since it deals with view state vs. application state. The easiest way to accomplish this is to create a method on the view class that hides the dropdown and invokes the function on its props. Then, you can pass that method to the click handler.. Adding Flow typing here such as removeCell: () => void should get rid of all your covariant Flow errors. I realized that I never added these to my provider (or Flow to the top of my file \ud83d\ude1e ) so I apologize for being unclear. I'll submit a PR to my provider to fix that tonight.. I think you might want renderToolbar here?. I think you can mark editorFocused & cellFocused as string|null here.. I think it was overkill for me to specify CellCreatorProps. We're checking the prop structure on the CellCreator view when the class is created so there's no reason for me to check that the {...props} being passed down in CellCreatorProvider's render method are also the same prop structure.. I fixed my provider with #1335. We should also be able to type Dispatch properly now too \ud83d\ude00 . Here, we should probably extend from Component. Extending from PureComponent would return false for all shouldComponentUpdate calls, which could interfere with what react-redux is doing under the hood.\nhttps://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/src/components/connectAdvanced.js#L142. Also, could you please rebase some of the linting/flow commits and reformat your PR title? After those small changes, we should be good to go \ud83d\udc4d . Haha you are definitely not the worst programmer \ud83d\ude1d sometimes a second pair of eyes makes all the difference!. Sure! \ud83d\ude00 Providers are only concerned with application level state and are connected to the Redux store. Views are unconnected to the store and should only be concerned with view level state isolated to that component (things like toggling a button or in our case, hiding a dropdown). This pattern helps us enforce separation of concerns.\nAnother reason we can't hide the dropdown on our provider is because we're using refs to invoke methods on the Dropdown component. Refs are destroyed when their children are destroyed, so we have to sync up establishing the ref with ToolbarView's render method instead of ToolbarProvider's.\nProvider:\njs\nclearOutputs() {\n  const { dispatch, id } = this.props;\n  dispatch(clearOutputs(id));\n}\n// pass down this method to the view through props\nView:\n```js\n// define a method called clearOutputs on the class & bind it in the constructor\nclearOutputs () {\n  this.dropdown.hide()\n  this.props.clearOutputs()\n}\nrender () {\n   this.clearOutputs()} />\n}\n```\nYou might want to move all of the content from renderToolbar into the ToolbarView's actual render method since there's no conditional logic. Here, you would want to leave out clearOutputs from the this.props destructuring since we want to invoke the clearOutputs function on the class.. Should we type the returns of these functions? \ud83e\udd14 Does it even matter?. Awesome, this is helpful for understanding what's going on!. At the end of the promise chain, we should catch any errors here with catch(e => console.error(e)). You can substitute console.error for however else we handle errors throughout the app.\nMaybe we could also display some kind of error message to the user via the notification system that their action was not completed? \ud83e\udd14 . Nice, that's definitely how you catch an error at the bottom of a promise chain but I'm not sure if that object is what we want to dispatch to Redux. Usually, dispatch takes a function (action creator) that returns an action with a type & payload. Although, maybe redux-observable handles things differently with the epics and I'm missing something here.\nDo we have an action creator that triggers an error action? @rgbkrk . No need to refactor, I totally wasn't aware of the error handling middleware. Sorry about that! Since the middleware picks up uppercase 'ERROR', I think all you need to do here is change your action type to ERROR_PDF_SAVED and we should be good to go. \ud83d\udc4d . Agreed, I'm going to make an issue to write the remaining Editor tests.. I think the defaults per language comes from the smartIndent property, which defaults to true. Not sure if setting indentUnit prevents smartIndent from working properly, but I'm down to take it out.. We're using babel-cli in our build:lib command but don't have it listed as a dependency - should we change this?. \ud83d\ude02 Love the package name!. Do we also need react-dom here? Looks like it may be an implicit dependency of Enzyme.. Should we start taking advantage of snapshots here or save it for another PR? Super excited we're switching to Jest \ud83d\ude00 . Good to know, we'll save the snapshots for another time. \ud83e\udd13 I'm just way too excited to snapshot all the things!. The same feedback that I gave to Safia still applies here. We want to control hiding the dropdown on the view, not the provider, because the view is where the ref is initialized. Passing the dropdown in here seems like we're introducing too much of a circular dependency.\nHere's the feedback I gave Safia for your reference. Please let me know if anything is unclear, I'd be happy to jump on a quick call if it's confusing. \ud83d\ude00 \n\n\n. No worries! I had to dig around to find my original feedback, GH hides it once you add new commits \ud83d\ude1e . Oops, I should have been more explicit when I sent you the config on Slack. I copied the config from a MLS Node service - totally should have mentioned that we still need \"browser\": true, \"mocha\": true here. \ud83d\ude00 . I think we can get rid of this one! \ud83d\udc4b . This comment is in reference to eslint-plugin-react. GH screwed up all my line numbers.\nWe can drop this one too.. This comment is in reference to eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y. GH screwed up all my line numbers.\nWe definitely need to keep this one.\nWe should add \"plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended\" to our extends array and \"jsx-a11y\" to our plugins array.. This comment is in reference to eslint-plugin-import. GH screwed up all my line numbers.\nDo we still need this?. That's an awesome use case for bringing it in! \ud83c\udf89 . We should try to refactor this function so it's more in line with React paradigms.. import { cloneDeep } from 'lodash' to keep it consistent. do we need the sCU check since there's only one prop?. I dont think this will ever be null so we can do React.Element<*>. \ud83d\udc4d . I would maybe combine constants & actions into @nteract/core/redux. ",

I'm trying out some nteract packages these days and would love more unified docs.\nedit:- Instead of saying I could use some docs, I should add more docs myself. :). Some functions that would be nice to have - \n1. createCodeCell\n2. createMarkdownCell\n3. getCellById\n4. getCellByIndex  - we have pinned cells and the cells can also be drag/dropped in any order, but I think this could still be a useful method.  I'm sure commutable isn't meant to be tied to nteract.\n5. isEqual - on the notebooks. I believe jupyter's nbformat module does something like this, when checking for trusted/untrusted notebooks it computes the hash of the notebook ( with all the metadata popped off ).  Might also make commutable easier to test. . I guess I'm pushing my luck with Number 5.. We could do pretty much everything with commutable and immutable.js today. It would be nicer to have more abstract functions though (as you noted in another ticket, like nbformat)\n. Why should this cause an issue for Bokeh ?. I think, as part of their work on Jupyterlab integration(https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/6774 - seems like a WIP ), they will have an extension that renders a custom mime-type. @vinzeebreak @olegantonyan I think after the fix in #2256 (it will be in the next release), this won't be an issue. @rgbkrk @captainsafia Thank  you so much!

    "jarmokivekas": "The maintainer and vendor fields in the generated debian control file are invalid (literally the string[object Object]), this is due to incorrect specification in package.json, I think.\nThe generated debian control file:\nPackage: nteract\nVersion: 0.0.15\nLicense: BSD-3-Clause\nVendor: [object Object]\nArchitecture: amd64\nMaintainer: [object Object]\nInstalled-Size: 309529\nDepends: libappindicator1, libnotify-bin\nSection: default\nPriority: extra\nHomepage: https://github.com/nteract/nteract\nDescription: \n  Interactive literate coding notebook!. I've manually tested the installation workflow and deemed that it works, although the packages are not elegant in that some of the metadata is lacking of incorrectly formatted.

This would allow automatically installing eg. pip along with the nteract package.\nWhile doing this I realized that most dependencies are packages as .so files inside the package, and end up in /opt/nteract/.\n.deb archive linters will complain about using embedded libraries, as most correct way is to list those libraries as dependencies in the package metadata, so that the libraries can be installed from their own packages. Using .so files works fine, it's just not the preferred way.\nI have a feeling that if it's  at all possible to avoid shipping libraries as .so using electron-build, it may be non-trivial (or at leat it's non-obvious to me). For the sake of this pull I'm not going to set this package to depend on other packages, and just let the libraries be shipped as .so inside of the package.. > - [ ] Are there man pages already written, or some documentation similar to it? typing man nteract in a terminal should give usage documentation.\nI haven't been able to figure out how to place arbitrary files in arbitrary location using the current build system, so I'm not sure how this can be done. At the moment nteract --help covers pretty much everything, since there aren't that many command line options as far as I'm aware. I may out-of-scope this task as well for now.. Thanks for the responsive feedbak. I think I've made all the suggested changes. I'm fairly happy with this as a proof-of-concept, although there is till much room for improvement. \nHere is a quick screen capture of a test install on a almost clean install on the latest version of Ubuntu (16.10).\nI can make individual issues for things that require further work. For example the menu item Help > Install Shell Commands attempts to alter /opt/nteract/resources/bin/nteract-env, which is owned by root:root and requires sudo privilege (besides, installing the .deb installs the shell command as well).\nI've done some linting on the .deb and ad-hoc testing of the install and removal process. There was some strange edge-case weirdness a few times, but nothing I've been able to reliably reproduce for debugging.\nI'm ok, with this being merged in its current state, but also open to suggestions.. I just tested this on a 32-bit (i389) ubuntu setup and it seems to work fine there also.. The 0.0.16 was there by accident, I didn't realize what npm version did exactly. I'll remove it.. I've now removed the offending npm version commits and tags.. I got a new update to  GitKraken today, and that process was quite nice as well, as far as self-updating applications on linux go.\nOn Linux their process is something like:\n\ninitial installation of the .deb\ncheck for updates on application startup\nnotify user if there are updates available\nthe notification has a \"download .deb\" button, clicking it downloads a new .deb\nwhen the download is complete, there is a \"show in file manager\" button.\ndouble click the .deb to open the system package installer and replace the current install\nback to 1.\n\nThis flow would probably be fairly straight-forward to implement using github releases mechanism to host the .deb, and I assume github has an API to check for new releases, since they seem to have most things. :thinking: . .deb packages include postinst maintainer scripts that are execute as root after installing the package. The current .deb created by electron-builder uses postinst to symbolically link nteract to PATH ln -s /opt/nteract/nteract.sh /usr/bin/nteract\nThis script could be used used to add an entry to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nteract.list in order to configure itself for automatic updates via the system update service (assuming updates are distributed using a package archive, not by self-update GitKraken style).\nAs an Ubuntu user this is the way I would personally perfer things to work. The installaiton flow would be:\n\nDownload a .deb from the nteract.io website or a github releases page\nInstall the package using the system installer like any other deb packages.\nThe installer postinst script adds an entry to sources.list.d for nteract\nThe system update service updates my nteract install along with all other software automatically whenever new updates are pushed to the package archive.\n\n. I think I got it fixed a few seconds ago. I noticed that also the cell-creator boxes between cells were visible sometimes.. In the Jupyter command mode, cells are added by pressing A (add above) or  B (below), you switch focus between cells with J and K (like in vim). The cell type is changed with M (markdown) and Y (code). Edit mode is entered with enter and command mode with Esc. Personally I have those quite engrained in memory by now, and regularly find myself trying to use them in nteract to no effect.\nI would love to see those in nteract, not only because I'm used to them, but I genuinely think it's a good may to interact with the notebook.\nKeyboard shorcuts are tricky, though, especially with multiple platforms. As a linux user I would by convention expect alt+c to open the Cell menu and alt+f to open the File menu and so on.\n . I think something in this breaks ctrl+enter for running/exiting edit mode in markdown cells. It seems to work on 5cacb0fd7 (HEAD~1). Interestigly, the media type emulation does not show the border, while it is still in the pdf anyway. Media emulation hides notifications and cell-creators just fine though.. I think the offending border is from a div like this:\n<div class=\"cell-draggable\" \"style=\"opacity: 1; border-top: 3px solid transparent; border-bottom: 3px solid transparent;\">\nEditing the CSS doesn't seem to help, since the border is defined in the html, therefore overriding anything in main.css?\nThere is a workaround: \"quickly move the cursor outside of the nteract window\" :smile:. Well, the problem wasn't actually the inline style, but a css transition that eases in the border on hover.\nSeems if the transition is in progress when exportPDF calls printToPDF the cell's border will show up in the pdf, so sometimes it shows, sometimes not. It's a weird edge-case. Removing the transition altogether fixes the problem in the pdf a, but removing it in @media print is not enough.\n. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4CRJznKbv1ATmh6d1owWGpBcnc/view?usp=sharing\nThe the box-shadow's ease-in transition is super subtle though. Old version to the left, and the new version to the right.. @jdetle It's my first pull request that touches the actual codebase. Earlier I did some stuff with package.json to make .deb archives for intalling nteract on linux. I've actually configured a way to autoupdate my nteract via the system updater on Ubuntu over this weekend ( issue #1400  << I have this actually working already on some level)\nAlso I should give kudos to the nteract project as a whole. As far as open source software communities go, I think this one does a lot of things right. People are nice, the feedback is quick, there is an active slack channel, documentation... I don't know, I've had many much worse experiences. :1st_place_medal: . I fought with this some more, and I don't know what I'm doing differently but the error is now gone... Yay?. @pachevalier  I assume that the \"binary file\" you've tried to install is the debian package for nteract v0.1.0, is this right?\nI'm under the impression that libappindicator1 is needed, since it is one of the default dependencies that electron-builder includes when creating the debian package.\nCould you share how are you installing the package? I've managed to install the package on ubuntu 16.10 both using Ubuntu Software as well as the command dpkg -i nteract_0.1.0_amd64.deb\n@rgbkrk as for #1458, libappindicator1 is a debian package, not an npm one, so these two I think are unrelated.. When I originally worked on fixing some of the issues with Linux packages I worked primarily on the .deb packages, which worked better than AppImage. I'm also quite ignorant about AppImage in general, I've never really used them much so I didn't debug them much in the first place. \nI just tested it, and can confirm, that the desktop launcher entry does not work currently using AppImage. I have a hunch that the .desktop (which defines the application launcher entry) file needs to be different in .appimage and .deb since the way the packages are installed on the system are quite different.\nThe .deb version of nteract works as expected for me on Ubuntu 17.10. It launches from the dash, and shows up in the context menu when right-clicking .ipynb files. Double clicking opens .ipynb files.\n@lucainnocenti You might want to try installing nteract_0.8.3_amd64.deb from the release page if you want better integration with the graphical environment.. My understanding is that AppImages have a wider support when it comes to Linux distributions, as their purpose is to be distribution agnostic.\nThe .deb package work pretty well in my experience, but it may be worthwhile to improve the AppImage packages, and once they work well, maybe even drop support for the .deb. If i remember correctly, and the build system hasn't changed too much, it may be difficult to maintain both package types. This is because the packaging system was not super flexible. If there is only one package type, it should probably be AppImage, so that distributions don't use .deb have a package too.  \nBut I haven't thought this through very thoroughly yet.. :heavy_check_mark: . :heavy_check_mark: . :heavy_check_mark: . :heavy_check_mark: . I think i will use \"nteract contirbutors <jupyter@googlegroups.com>\" as suggested by @rgbkrk . I've  commonly seen mailing list addresses as maintainers.. These are the apt-get packages I personally installed to get up and running. They seemed to reduce the amount of warnings while building the package, but I'm not sure which, if any are actual dependencies.. :heavy_check_mark: . :heavy_check_mark: . I don't love this solution, but I tried several other solutions, and can't find another other way.. In macOS the menu bar is at the top of the screen, right? To trigger this, when you click the Export PDF menuitem, your cursor needs to end up hovering above a cell that is not focused. Even then there are times where it isn't triggered, if there is no mouse event happening before the PDF is exported, or the 0.1s transition is already completed vy the time the pdf is exported. At least that's it seems to me. It is kind of an edge case.... ",

    "theengineear": "@rgbkrk just catching up on this issue and trying to get some bearings. I'm mostly just trying to learn more about how the repo is organized and such.\nSome responses\n\nPrecursors > Refactor components to remove Redux logic\n\nIf I'm understanding this right, you're looking to pass down dispatch-y props to child components? I've found that using connect and just defining mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps liberally helps keep logic inside the file you'd like it to be in. I.e., if you end up interacting with a component and something breaks, it's more likely that the problem is in that component file. I also prefer this for tests. Anyways, just some thoughts.\n\nWe should also think about integrating our CSS into JS to allow users to pass in custom styles through a style prop that will override our defaults.\n\nI wonder if in-lining styles will couple React code a little too tightly with the style? I'm not sure how you're planning on doing the overriding of things, but a well-organized set of scss files (using the 7-1 pattern https://sass-guidelin.es/) can be pretty clean! That said, I've never actually tried doing css --> js and have blindly followed articles like this.\nExtras\nAlso, you'd mentioned something about creating menu mocks / components. Is the intention to create this from scratch (at some level), or just rely on some 3rd party menu?\n. Re: top-nav or side nav, I definitely think top-nav is the way to go. I feel like horizontal space is always at a premium when I'm in a notebook.. >If the 3rd party menu works, I'd much prefer to rely on something well supported by others.\n\ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4d I think requirement here should be reasonably simple, I'd be surprised if an acceptable solution doesn't exist.. @rgbkrk , yep, moving the redux-y stuff to a single location makes sense to me.\nLooks like all of this is coming from one package. Were these actions already being imported by other packages then?. Side note, I noticed that the types don't seem to be namespaced. E.g., const SAVE = \"SAVE\". If we end up having a central place for this information, we should make sure we're namespacing correctly.\n^^ Along those lines, it might make sense to eventually organize these files by purpose, maybe nesting these particular ones under /desktop or something? Just a thought, I haven't had as much 1:1 time with these packages yet, so most of these suggestions are really just questions :). >That would be fine. Are you thinking something like NTERACT@SAVE\nThe pattern I've seen would have you doing something like NTERACT/NOTEBOOK/SAVE or some such. But we can pick any symbol (little \"s\"), really. As long as it's not _/-/etc... \ud83d\ude38 \n\nIt's probably hard to see this from the changes but...\n\nHa, ok, awesome \ud83c\udf89 .. @rgbkrk sorry for the ridiculous delay \ud83d\ude3f . @mpacer ^^ there's a short list of open issues in the description for this. Want to (a) add anything that you think might need adding to that list and (b) pick one you'd like to start out on?\n@rgbkrk anything else you'd like to add to the list?\nFeel free to just edit the description.\nI think the first check-box up there might warrant some more discussion. I think you two have more knowledge around it than I do, but... I'm sort-of thinking that it'd be a good user experience to have the source/outputs linked directly to each active kernel and then just display that information given the currently-selected kernel.. >Clear outputs each time source is run...\n@mpacer i think that you'd want to do a couple things:\n\n\nyou'll now want to return mulltiple actions from the runSourceEpic, so you'll need to change the map to mergeMap so that you can return an observable on this line https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/improve-play/applications/play/redux/epics.js#L192\n\n\nI think if you add a new CLEAR_KERNEL_OUTPUT (S?) actionType and a related action, you can basically return Observable.of(actions.clearKernelOutput({ serverId, kernelName }), actions.setSource(source));\n\n\nIs that what you're asking? I just saw @rgbkrk 's comment and now I'm not sure if I understood correctly.\n. >My intuition is that we should start the kernels clean and therefore start the source clean as well.\nYah, this is my intuition as well. Personally, I think we should move source from ui.source to serversById[id].server.activeKernelsByName[kernelName].kernel.source. I think Kyle had some interesting counter-arguments to this point though.. >The order of events matters (if I submit code & it comes back quickly and it only then clears the outputs we'll have a nondeterministic UI).\nWhen you click run code, are we expecting that:\n\nthe output is immediately cleared\nwhen the kernel responds, the output is populated?\n\nIf that's the case, since synchronous things will remain synchronous, there's no way the kernel will beat us to it. Do I have that right @rgbkrk . ah, i think i see the issue:\n\nclick run source\nkernel response with output 0-0\nclick run source\nclear output 0-0\noops, kernel responds with output 0-1\nkernel responds with output 1-0\nkernel responds with output 1-1\n\nthe user sees old output in the outputs panel. well, one solution to that is to revise how the ui works. we could (instead of clearing output), assign an id each time we submit source? is there a way to map a kernel output to an input @rgbkrk ? then the kernel state should keep an inputId hunk of state as well, right?. >RUN_SOURCE doesn\u2019t trigger any reducers currently?\ncorrect, it's just handled in an epic.\n\nIn which case creating a reducer that clears outputs would be the right way to go?\n\nyup, and that was my first suggestion. however, you could also just go ahead and have the activeKernelOutputs handle the RUN_SOURCE type by just returning [] empty.\nIn general, we shouldn't be afraid of reducers listening to multiple action types. Totally OK to do that.. >Would it be cleaner to have a CLEAR_OUTPUTS actionType in case other parts of the code eventually need to do this as well?\nYah, I guess that is clearer (no pun intended). It is the case here that we can just clear on RUN_SOURCE though. I'm fine either way. Whichever feels better to you. I can imagine other parts of the code wanting to clear the output, so I guess I'm more in favor of the CLEAR_KERNEL_OUTPUTS approach :+1:\n. ^^ @rgbkrk , not sure i can 100% \ud83d\udc4d / \ud83d\udc4e  your last suggestion, but if you want to try doing that in a subsequent PR, I'm certainly for it \ud83d\ude38 . Re: keeping source/outputs alongside the kernel state vs alone in the ui...\nUser is writing python code, connected with a python2 kernel\nThey realize they meant to connect to python3 (and a different binder)\nThey expect to be able to finish what they were working on (and share it)\n^^ CMD+C / CMD+P\nHowever, I do have another compelling argument for keeping it alone in the UI. It's how notebooks currently work, right? If this was just a single cell in a notebook, we wouldn't change the cell/outputs when the user changes the kernel right?\nHa, I'm a little torn on this one. I feel like keeping source/outputs per kernel makes the most sense. BUT, I'm more than willing to believe that I'm a newcomer to this ecosystem and my opinions may be naive.\n. @rgbkrk , it's the convention here to not commit package-lock.json files, yah? should we remove this file from the PR?. Rebased again to fix a merge conflict with master.. @rgbkrk had to rebase again for merge conflicts on master. You suggested that it might be a good idea to just merge this in since we keep running into issues with merge conflicts. I agree \ud83d\ude04 . >work making plotly plots rendering async and faster by using imperative interface\n(from the top comment)\nI have some stashed changes that attempt to do this on my machine. I'd like to handle this in a separate iteration though. Perhaps we can make a new issue and just assign me to it after we merge this in?. Yup. I think we can definitely improve the user experience here. I'm happy with making updates to this as long as we make sure not to overstep. For example, if we allow too much handy filtering in the UI for the visualizations, we may end up conditioning users to just select * all the time from tables.\nOne alternative is to try to nudge users into narrowing the number of columns they request in the first place. This is a super-common problem in viz. Another manifestation is creating tooling to handle down-sampling huge sets of data into a visualization. Arguably, the sampling should be done prior to visualization in many cases.\nAgain, I think adding more functionality is definitely appropriate here, but let's make sure we consider how any features we add will condition users to do analysis.. @rgbkrk I updated this thread based on some of the most recent changes I had made to that doc we'd been working with. I pointed out a couple open questions I have.. @rgbkrk having kernel and kernelSpecs know about their host just feels oddly circular to me. I sorta feel like just having some component have host and kernel in its props will do the trick? I'm just wary of adding more state keys than are really necessary.. huh... I thought I did rebase it. maybe I still missed some changes. @rgbkrk i'll update it now\nEDIT:\noop, right you were :). Awesome, thanks for beefing up the tests @rgbkrk!. >Do you think I should switch all use of executionState to kernelStatus where components are using it?\nlike the components are using the variable name executionState? If so, ya, we should switch to kernelStatus in this PR.. @rgbkrk \n\nif it's not passed the full URL for the endpoint it should construct the full URL\n\nIs there any reason for us not to required that users of the lib just pass in the full URL, else we just bail in rx-jupyter?\n. @rgbkrk thoughts? I started trying to implement some of these byRef functions and realized that I would have some really awkward places where the thingByRef object would keep coming in as a Plain Javascript object and the underlying thing would be a Record \ud83d\ude3f.. I wrote out the spec file as a sort-of POC that this should all work as expected.. >I'm not really sure why you're thinking the byRef objects would sometimes be non immutable JS objects wouldn't we just create the records when they're first created and then work with them as immutable objects from there on?\nI could have been clearer above. My comment was just pointing out:\n```\nconst resourceFactory = Immutable.Record({ name: \"default\" });\nconst resource = resourceFactory({ name: \"some-name\" });\nconst root = { byId: { someId: resource } };\nconsole.log(Immutable.isImmutable(root))\n// false\nconsole.log(Immutable.isImmutable(root.byId));\n// false\nconsole.log(Immutable.isImmutable(root.byId.someId));\n// true\n```\nI think we're on the same page. I just want to have the whole state tree be immutable. I think it's not actually so bad now that we've flattened the state. However, I was thinking about how play nests state, something like this:\n{\n    serversById: {\n        serverId: {  // server envelope POJO\n          server: {  // server object Record\n              config: { .. }, // server config Record\n              kernelsById: {  // ew, POJO\n                  kernelId: {  // kernel envelope POJO\n                      kernel: { .. } // Record\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n        }\n    }\n}\nAgain, since we flattened the state, we don't have any byId's that are nested inside Record's like this, so it's less of an issue. However, I'll still find it less confusing if our whole state tree is really in Immutable-land.. @rgbkrk ^^. Also, :tada: for Immutable.isImmutable!. Sorry, meant to start opening these branches from my fork.... @rgbkrk there's actually not too many places where this needs changing. play is a big one, that was built entirely without Immutable, but should convert if/when it starts using core state managerment.. Fixed.. >I think it makes sense to actually move the records bits from @nteract/types to @nteract/core\n\ud83d\udc4d . @rgbkrk I didn't really intend for this description to get so lengthy. This is a pretty simple ask, and I think we're all likely on the same page on this one, but I figured this might be a good time to bring it up to be officially discussed?. Great! I'll start adding the new action type strings / action types / actions according to that and we can create an issue to bring the other things into conformity down the road. . ^^ I think it'd be interruptKernel, interruptKernelFulfilled, interruptKernelFailed, interruptKernelCanceled though, right?. Related to naming conventions. I'm coming from using createAction (https://redux-actions.js.org/) which basically locks the action form to {type: string, payload: Object}, but I noticed that nteract tends to spread out what could be considered the payload into the top-level action. Any reservations if do envelope with payload?. Definitely just a work in progress at this point, but I wanted to throw this partial PR up here to make sure this is all looking like we want it to look.. @rgbkrk mind doing a quick peruse? Anything set off \ud83d\udea8s for you?. The only new commit is 4b7c9e0329491f15bc9f625d567e09f7714132f9. Rebased on top of some edits based off of your previous PR review. Going to start adding epics in now.. @rgbkrk Can you point me to a place in the codebase where we're mocking out rx-jupyter for testing epics? We do have to mock that out for testing, right? I've set up my own ways to mock out things like ajax and provide mock schedulers (so you can test things with debounceTime, etc), but I'm wondering how that's handled in here?. @rgbkrk just missing tests at this point. Want to do a review?. Hmm. Any opinions on how much of the state-management chain to test at once? I sorta feel like core's contract is:\nGive us actions, we update state.\n\nBut, when you test epics, you only test:\nGive us actions, we give you actions.\n\nAnd when you test reducers, you only test:\nGive us partial-state and actions, we give you partial-state.\n\nI.e., I feel like it's not that much more work to just configure a complete store, setup reducers/epics, dispatch actions and look for the resulting state? I'm not going to do this now, but maybe food for thought? I don't want us to get in the habit of writing tests that don't actually prevent breaking changes.. The test I just wrote really only tests actions in >> actions out, but that's not really the thing consumers care about at the end of the day.. @rgbkrk hey, sorry, i ended up rebasing again to update this pr in response to some comments.. \n. \ud83d\ude43 seems silly, but will you double check the contents vs content usage. I think it should mirror hosts, host, selectedHostRef. So, contents, content, rootContentRef.. @rgbkrk , ok, updated want to merge it?. @rgbkrk funny when you write your tests last, confirm that they work, and then accidentally checked a stale version in your browser before pushing it up \ud83d\ude05.\nSmall hot-fix, I'll just merge if I don't hear from you in ~1hr.. Also, @rgbkrk (+ all nteract folks) thanks for having a repo with nice surface area to write tests in. It's been a breeze so far.. Thanks! I'll finish this up tomorrow.. OK! I added a larger dummy notebook (it's called bigDummy) so that I could better test some of the execution flows. I'm glad you forced me to explore commutable a little more, this PR ended up become wayyyyy more solid PR because of that.\nBUT, I now need to fix a weird issue with how uuid is mocked in the notebook-preview tests.... OK @rgbkrk ready for review \ud83c\udf89 (thanks for your patience!). OK @rgbkrk I think that var( .. ) call is alright, it just wasn't set previously and should have been. The color from the rc-menu port was just close enough that I hadn't noticed. That's available in the light theme though, I believe.. Merge?. I'll let you take a look through the comments before merging. Let me know if you just want to handle them separately; that's cool too!. Also... Why did you change the title from Here I come to save the notebook!? That was great!\n. ## Problem\nWe need to get to parity with \"classic\" Jupyter with nteract's jupyter\nextension. Right now, we really only have a component in core called\nNotebookApp that handles the editing of a notebook.\nJupyter Extension requirements\nIn our Jupyter extension, we can have the following cases:\nNote that we don't necessarily know the type from the contents api ahead of\ntime. In this case, we may need to get the file and then redirect.\n^^ Is it possible to make a request for just the metadata about a file? I.e.,\nnot get the whole file? Probably not something that needs worrying about yet,\nbut it'd be wasteful to fetch the whole file and then just redirect.\n```\n/edit/ && { type: \"notebook\" }\n/edit/ && { type: \"file\" }\n/edit/ && { type: \"directory\" }\n/view/ && { type: \"notebook\" }\n/view/ && { type: \"file\" }\n/view/ && { type: \"directory\" }\n/tree/ && { type: \"notebook\" }\n/tree/ && { type: \"file\" }\n/tree/ && { type: \"directory\" }\n```\nPlan\n```\n/edit/ && { type: \"notebook\" } >> \n/edit/ && { type: \"file\" } >> ??\n/edit/ && { type: \"directory\" } >> redirect(/tree/)\n/view/ && { type: \"notebook\" } >> redirect(/edit/)\n/view/ && { type: \"file\" } >> ??\n/view/ && { type: \"directory\" } >> redirect(/tree/)\n/tree/ && { type: \"notebook\" } >> redirect(/view/)\n/tree/ && { type: \"file\" } >> redirect(/view/)\n/tree/ && { type: \"directory\" } >> \n```\nI plan to make a new Directory component inside /core, though I think we\nmay want to refactor that later if /core ends up too bloated.\nI'm not going to handle the File view yet, but I wanted to add it into the\nmix for discussion.\n. @rgbkrk ^^ I was just hashing a few things out on my end and I figured I might as well document my thoughts here.. Oop, looks like we also need a plan to add the rest of the contents handling.. ~~@rgbkrk just to be clear. It looks like the rx-jupyter contents.js file targets the notebook type, right? However, it needs to be generalized to any of the three recognized types?~~ nvm. i think i spoke too soon. It's just the epics that seem to only handle notebooks right now. I don't need to change anything in the contents.js file in rx-jupter, correct?. Noice! One comment, but looks great! Thanks for finally getting us on reselect \ud83d\ude01 . @rgbkrk Any opinions on this? I've successfully implemented modals without any stress using the approach mentioned above. One downside is it's verbosity, but that rarely makes me shy away from things \ud83d\ude1b.. I think that @captainsafia is working on using portals for things like tooltips. Perhaps you have opinions as well?. Some context, I'm simply adding an initial modal for the about menu in the jupyter extension. Nothing terribly exciting, but I'd rather we start off in a direction we all agree on.. >about menu (desktop gets to cheat for this one)'\nThis feels like it belongs as a full modal with a backdrop and all\n\nmetadata editing\n\nI like the idea of having this as a drawer instead of a modal. I think modals should be used sparingly since they pull users away from the context they were in.. There's a potential menu/edit/nbextensions config, right? That's another full-modal deal, IMO.. Things like showing kernel-messages / logs in a modal could be nice. Although, this could float at the bottom of the page as well without needing a modal.... >I was kind of thinking that kernel logs could be in a drawer too, pulling up from the bottom (in play style, reversed).\nYup. Agreed. I think that would be much nicer.. ~~I think I might just go with the Portal approach for now since you can group logic more easily. I'll keep this issue open while I work on that though.~~. Related https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/2446\nThis component now has to store state, which seems unnecessary. Had I gone with the longer approach of creating an actionType/action/reducer/ControllerComponent setup, we could really have this in isolation. I.e., the action would be the only thing coupling the menu to the modal... which could potentially be cleaner. I think this will work for now though.\nNote, reused bits of our set of css variables where I could in the modal css.. @rgbkrk  \u23ea \u23f9 \u25b6\ufe0f OK, re-implemented with a ModalController.. @rgbkrk, your comments made me realize I skipped some corners \ud83d\ude13. Now we:\n\nallow escape-key-exit from the modal\nhave a real dialog (yay new html tags). I like those eslint rules! Super handy!. Yay! All the menu items \ud83c\udf89 . Closing this down. We can revisit later.. @rgbkrk Might be worth your taking a gander at this point. I need to resolve conflicts and such, but I think this is finally in a stable place.. >Those probably do have to be part of our theme setup, though I think are out of scope for this PR.\n\nYah, agreed and agreed :). Hrm... @rgbkrk i just rebased on master and now I'm getting some build errors. I might have to circle back and ping you for help on it.. Ah, yup, git clean -xfd && npm i did it for me. Thanks!. Awesome! I'm going to merge as is, but let's discuss observable redux patterns a bit?. I haven't run this yet. At some point this weekend I'll pull this down and run things to take a deeper dive on this!. >current is way better than getCurrent, especially since every selector is a get*.\nCool. Accepted \ud83d\ude0e.. @rgbkrk I wanted to link an issue in a PR I'm about to open. Have you noticed this one yet?. Yah, I think ripping it out would be a good idea. Any idea how much backlash there would be?. @rgbkrk any objections?. ^^ some comments for you! This all looks great!. Still plugging away at this. It sure does touch a lot of code \ud83d\ude2c.\nOne thing that is sorta odd for us are failure actions... Take LAUNCH_KERNEL_FAILED. We want to type this as an ErrorAction and use payload: Error, error: true, yada-yada. HOWEVER, now that we have many kernels that can fail, we actually want the payload to be something like payload: { kernelRef: string, error: Error }, hrm...\nAnyways, I'd like to standardize on always providing payload as an envelope. I don't think I'll get there in this PR, but I wanted to throw it out there for thoughts.\nSlowly, but surely.... Great!. Just for context, because it wasn't clear to me when I first looked this over. The reason we want to do this is that the cell_pager which is the help-text that appears in the output area when you do something like list?. However, it's not output, so it previously didn't clear when you cleared all outputs. This is pretty confusing for users who shouldn't need to understand the difference between transient pager information and real cell output.. Looks great @rgbkrk !. Nice! One question in there for ya! Then I'll merge it for ya!. As far as --theme-scale-idx-[index], i think we should likely give ourselves wiggle room to have a multiple scales, right? I.e., we might want to call it --theme-scale-category10-1. Right?. Also, these will change with light/dark theme ya? We'll have to be pretty careful about these if we're going to be changing colors in a chart based on theming... That might get confusing fast.. One more comment... about comments. @rgbkrk and I chatted a little about wanting commenting for this config file. I think we'll likely change the input file to YAML so that it can support comments. What we don't want to do is add JS since it makes it far too easy to get too magical in what should be a very simple config file.. >People shouldn't toggle between and expect them to stay the same (I think).\nMaybe? I'm actually not sure on this. But I'm okay with making the assumption for now and seeing how it goes.. >Maybe what we do, on the theme side, is make this specific to the intent. --theme-completion-idx-1\nYah, naming the themes is what I'm getting at for sure. If you want, you can do --theme-category10-[index] and then alias it to --theme-completion-[index] as well. But either way, let's sneak another piece of context in there as you're suggesting :+1:.. First off, I'm totally going to merge this. However, I think aliases can be a little confusing for folks new to a codebase (and for IDE's!). We're saving ~4 characters (per usage) and adding a fair amount of complexity. Dunno if it's totally worth it. OK, now I'll merge and we can discuss later.. Or, is there some other benefit I'm missing?. >The benefit of these aliases is that you don't have to rebuild those packages to see updates in the jupyter extension UI.\nAh, ok, that makes sense then \ud83d\udcaf . AH! I'm on Node 8.2.1, I think you might just be ahead of me. Looks like it's supported in Node 8.6.0+. Let me try that real quick.. ^^ OK, updated my node and away we go. Duplicate declaration still stands \ud83d\ude1b . ~~Oop, missed a couple changes. Don't merge yet!~~ k, ready.. @rgbkrk as we talked about :). Ooh! Actually, I will make one more commit to start using the real KernelRef types instead of that hard-coded string...\n\n. ~~oop, missed one of my rebase cues :p temp: hosts types...~~ ok ready!. OK @rgbkrk, final review?. Eh, not so bad :). @rgbkrk thanks for the catch!. @rgbkrk A little overdue, but here you go \ud83d\ude05.. Thanks for the quick review!. @rgbkrk I need to fire up some apps to test all these changes. I'd love a preliminary review if you have a few minutes though!. @rgbkrk I tagged the code with something like TODO: #2608, since you're taking this on in #2616, you might find it useful to search for in the codebase.. ^^ Man, the difference in syntax in the flowconfig is brutal \ud83d\udc3c.. >I think the only thing that scares me in this PR is that types are copied from old in packages/core/src/state/entities/kernels.js when they should use the same type.\nYah, this was honestly just because I was not really trusting flow at the time and didn't want to make more waves than necessary. We should be able to sync them though in the follow up.. ^^ Looking amazing, Kyle! I left some comments, but didn't \ud83d\udc4d or \ud83d\udc4e yet. Hit me up when you've got another update!. I pulled down your branch, i see ref in this file still packages/core/src/components/notebook-menu/index.js. @rgbkrk I have a couple comments, but I'm going to merge it now so I can go ahead and rebase on it! Awesome work.. ^^ Not sure if you have light to shed on this flow error? Am I missing something dumb?. Apparently I was tired last night \ud83d\ude1b . @rgbkrk slowly, but surely. I'm literally going action by action so that I can just keep pushing things up here. Not done yet, but going steadily forth.. Just wanted to push things up. I'm likely going to redo that last commit.. @rgbkrk , ready for a full review!. Looking great @rgbkrk! It's satisfying that document is gone \ud83d\udc4b! No more comments from me, really.  Let me know when you're ready and I'll give ya the merge!. >What happens if you click on one of the sub menus -- like change cell type. Does it close those?\nNope, just on item click, those are \"submenus\". So that click will not close the menu, which I think is the right behavior.. Thanks for including the images \ud83d\udc4c. Looks much better.. @tlyon3 great! Other than @rgbkrk's comment, it looks good to me! Thanks for the change.. I'll fire this up locally after a review, but mind adding an image of the new feature in the top comment?. @rgbkrk want to pull this down and try it out? This is definitely missing some polish, but as a first pass, it should be switching kernels for us.. Is this a breaking change? If you're depending on whatever the sort order currently is, won't this new sort break your code?. Nvm, @rgbkrk and I chatted about it.. I think merge exists in rxjs/operators as well, fwiw. I think that might be the better way to import it.. nice clean up \ud83d\ude3a . Since we're always returning both actions from this, it might be clearer to just have:\nreturn of(\n    actions.clearKernelOutputs({ serverId, kernelName }),\n    actions.setSource(source)\n);. ^^ oops, edited, i had some bad copy pasta in there. :+1: cool, thanks for updating that!. If we're going to store the repo and gitref in the url, we should remove it from the ui state. I.e., we want a single source of truth.\nTo handle this, I think we have access to a url prop for our Page component as documented in https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#shallow-routing.\nI think the appropriate flow would be the following (not thinking about server failures yet...):\n\nUser submits binder form\nWe push a change to the url (shallow route)\ncomponentWillReceiveProps notices a change to the repo and/or gitref (might even want to store these together as a single query param for clarity) and dispatches an action to create a new server connection.\n\nOn the initial page load, we should be able to more-or-less kick off the same action from componentDidMount, right?. @rgbkrk is there any reason that we'd want to have this information live in our ui state and in the url?. @rgbkrk I think it's clearer to have a notebook hunk of state here. What do you think? One place where it relieves some awkwardness is:\nnotebookLastSaved: Date,\nconfigLastSaved: Date\nto\nnotebook: {\n    lastSaved: Date\n},\npreferences: {\n  lastSaved: Date\n}\nIt also makes the communication portion clearer, IMO.. @rgbkrk I know we talked about this, but I'm forgetting why this is? Something to do with sending a shutdown message to a kernel? Is it different depending on the host? In this case, I wonder if giving the kernel/kernelSpec a reference to it's host is an anti-pattern. Perhaps we should just have a hostType instead? These are the only two places where a child knows about its parent. I feel like we should limit that knowledge to just what these children actually need to know.. I don't recall what resources was, we should probably remove it until we remember :). Ditto here on this hostRef. Perhaps just hostType would do?. I guess I'm just looking for guidance on what sort of keys/values are appropriate. Is it just a single key language or something?. \ud83d\udea8  These are actually changing the string. Is that OK? \"RAW_STDERR\" --> \"KERNEL_RAW_STDERR\".. :+1: cool, then no biggie :tada:. \ud83d\udc4d yep, that's what status was meant to be used for. i'll make a note to change that to executionState. We should change this to executionState since that's what's been used previously https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/2385/commits/aeb4b0b39aa003512046624a3a7426ccf5d18c31#diff-cefd1a3d3e94e5d5e684286dd7a56c21R37. \ud83d\udc4d . Yah, definitely. I figured that was coming at some point.. Ping >> thoughts?. Ping >> thoughts?. Yup. I did the same in the plan.md doc ;)\nI'm all about consistency \ud83d\ude3a https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/2400. It's just occurring to me know that we should probably be capitalizing these? CommunicationKernelspecsFactory?. Additionally, we have the pattern make* for factories in other places here. I think that that is a little confusing. The Immutable pattern seems to be RecordFactory, so  think *Factory makes sense? Then, we end up using just like Map:\nconst map = Map();\nconst record = CommunicationKernelspecsFactory();\nYa?. @rgbkrk ^^. \u26a1\ufe0f \ud83d\udc80 . Does declare make the type available globally or something?. If this just throws in here, why do we allow id?: string in the type defs? . \ud83d\udc4c . \ud83d\udc04 isn't the canonical import import React from \"react\"?. \ud83c\udf89 . Gotcha! Cool. If that's what the docs say, then we should go with that. Thanks!. Yah, that's fine by me \ud83d\ude04. What does the s vs no s mean to you? Like, why do we call the \nobject:\n{\n  name: \" .. \",\n  resources: { .. },\n  spec: { .. }\n}\nkernelspecs (with an s)?. This sorta feels like it should be KernelspecsProps (with that s) for consistency?. Oop, nvm, I get it, the loss of the s is that you've got kernelspecs.spec, so kernelspecs is the whole object and kernelspecs.spec == kernelspec.. That's honestly a little confusing to me, but I'll go for it since it's a much shorter name :+1:\n. ah, awesome. thanks! that's really good to know. i'm positive that saved me like at least 10 minutes down the road somewhere \ud83d\ude1b . Oh, yah, good idea. \ud83d\udc4d . Almost! I forgot about how Immutable switches the expected order of key, value to value, key! Helpful in this case though:\nconst newState = Immutable.Map(action.payload.kernelspecs).map(\n  (value: KernelspecProps) => makeKernelspec(value)\n);\n. @rgbkrk this is all we should theoretically need to drill into content, right? There should always be some root to our content tree and that logically should be stored in the host, right?. Is there a better standard we should follow? I feel like I commonly think of the content of a directory as a list of children and the content of a file as text? Might be worth thinking a little more on.... yup, totally, i just didn't want to get that deep yet\n. ah, excellent. yah, i didn't want to over-think this cause i figured that might be the case. i'll grab that. i was just mapping to cells in here manually.. This one ends up being a little different from the one in desktop. I'm going to leave a TODO in here and we can continue to discuss. The difference is that when you download a file from the browser, you almost never want the full path, whereas desktop would absolutely need the full path on save.. Seemed to work OK for me and I'd rather not add another implementation of that type \ud83d\ude01 . Yah, bad copy \ud83c\udf5d !. @rgbkrk thoughts? I was going to add a top-level themeStrings key or some such, but then I found code in here that uses themes (from import * as themes...) as a map of keys to themes. Which feels like a weird way to use a module object? default is the obvious oddity there when you do an ES6 import (not there if you require).. Ah, cool. I'll just be explicit about light/dark then \ud83d\udc4d . Nice. Yah, this is way cleaner \ud83d\udc4d . This is a little weird to return this object that's not really an action. I see that it's basically just getting handled below. Not a huge deal, but I think it would make sense to just handle this section below in the mergeMap?. I wonder if we should create a saveAs action so that this isn't so order-dependent? Also not a big deal, \ud83d\udcaf for leaving a comment.. Does this not permanently change the filename in state or something? I left a comment above, but I didn't realize this action already existed.. Sweet! Mind doing a copy-paste job in the menu-spec? (reviewing commit-by-commit so apologies if you did and i didn't see it yet). You should be able to basically copy one of the little blobs there and change it to use this new constant.. Just noticed this, but we have two imports from @nteract/commutable in here that should get merged.. Maybe add a comment on the app.host.crossDomain vs setting this crossDomain to false?. mapTo. haven't used that one yet. handy!. Is there anything potentially weird about sending literally the same action a bunch of times? I guess not... feels sorta odd to me. But only because I guess I haven't seen the pattern before.. \u2764\ufe0f . ah. right, right. okay that makes sense. \ud83d\udc4d . Let's leave it as is for now \ud83d\udc4d . I think we could just listen to a new SAVE_AS action type in the same reducer that CHANGE_FILENAME is listening for. Even still allow a filename arg in the save action potentially. I think it's worth punting for now to have a proper discussion about.. Ha, yah, that's interesting. Well, we could prevent all that by just map(() => doneSaving()) \ud83d\ude38 . \ud83d\ude47 . Since serverUrl, crossDomain, and token are primitive types, you could also:\nexport const getServerConfig = createSelector(\n  [\n    state.app.host.serverUrl,\n    state.app.host.crossDomain,\n    state.app.host.token\n  ],\n  (endpoint, crossDomain, token) => ({ endpoint, crossDomain, token })\n)\nRight?. I'm sure it's not a big enough performance increase to make a difference, but maybe we should get in the habit?. \ud83d\udcaf . Good idea to not switch the naming in the args \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\ude2c shame.. nah, this is totally normal CSS, the bug is when you have a newline above a media query for some reason. it seems to flake on that parse. but yah, seems to work just fine \ud83c\udf89 . ah, yup, totally right \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83e\udd14 Was this supposed to supply a different default?. Sorta not testing much, right? Should this really be null here?. ah. gotcha, thanks for adding a note!. ^^ nice, that's a good call. \ud83d\ude47 . We wrap our components in this new provider (lots of wrappers).. This is the main file that we use to construct our theme.. For validation and programmatic access, we export all the available variables.. ^^ i'm just copying how this was setup in notebook-app.js. but I think there's room for experimentation here.. \ud83d\udc4c . And, here's a clear way to re-create the actual css files (an array, since that's how css works). Should we flesh this one out before merging?. \ud83d\udcaf . \ud83d\udc4d . Can we make an actual action creator for this?. I like the idea of just ignoring these, but then again, that's sort-of a silent fail, isn't it?. Can the kernels.interrupt fail? Do we need a catchError in this pipe?. yah, the action.. \ud83e\udd14 . Super minor, but you could use one of our dummy notebooks in here so that we continue to have richer mocks in our tests. Ya just never know when that will save you one day ;). \ud83c\udfc5 for sticking to the naming convention!. ah, i see \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . Hmm. Definitely just for discussion. BUT, we could also do a bit of indirection instead of filtering here. Like instead of ignoring these, we could have yet another epic that just handles all of these actions and maps them to more specific actions:\nhandle INTERRUPT_KERNEL:\n  if ({zeromq kernel}) {\n    return INTERRUPT_KERNEL_ZEROMQ\n  } else if ({ jupyter kernel }) {\n    return INTERRUPT_KERNEL_JUPYTER\n  }\nWhat I'm worried about is us getting into a pattern of swallowing actions. I think we could alternatively just be explicit about routing.\nI guess I'm thinking about trying to debug the INTERRUPT_KERNEL action (i know, i'm using nomenclature loosely). I'd probably grep for that string to see where it's handled. If it shows up in a bunch of epics, but is only handled by some of them, that feels like a non-linear debugging process.\nAnyways \ud83d\udc07 \ud83d\udd73 ... but I think we might want to rethink this pattern.. \ud83c\udf89 . ^^ Yup, that's definitely the intention there \ud83c\udf89 . Yah. Exactly. Guidance is welcome here. It's definitely a bit of an odd package setup.. I'm trying to understand why empty would not work here. I thought it would be something related to empty immediately terminating, but I don't think that matters (or would be different from of in this case) since you're merge-ing at the end here.. This sorta feels like a distinct thing to me. Why not just have another, small epic that listens to either of the two actions that are spit out from the above? I feel like that would be easier to reason about.. This might be misleading, it's not necessarily the timeout that caused the error, right?. I commented on this below.. I think just SHUTDOWN_REPLY_FAILED is more true?. awesome commenting \ud83d\udcaf \u2b50\ufe0f . Should this be named something like createKillKernelObservable?. TBH this code was a little hard to grok for me. It's nice that it is all packed away into a separate function here, but I'm so used to the notion of actions in, actions out that having a function that is kernel in, actions out feels weird. It might be my lack of familiarity though. I think we should probably keep it if it's working in the interest of time, but we might want to discuss further.. huh, i'm surprised that nothing else complains before this. isn't it expected that an action MUST have a type? I'm worried about being overly-defensive here. What's the rationale for this?. That didn't work, but just using a React.Fragment works fine to get rid of the div.. Ah, I'll fix this, it's really just a relic of the repo I basically ripped it from. . ^^ yah, that's fine as well. ah, gotcha, that's fine \ud83d\udc4c . Ah, ok, is it going to stay in the PR or get yanked before we merge?. \u26a1\ufe0f ?. \u26a1\ufe0f ?. oh wow. How did i not know about this? expect.anything() \ud83d\udca5 . In general, I actually think I have a bunch more questions, but thinking about whether or not this should really be a mergeMap is what kicked off some concerns for me. Like, what happens if you launch the same kernel twice, is it the case that kernel will be set correctly on the second one? What if it's still in the process of being killed? What if it hasn't been connected to yet... then can we even kill it?\nI'm wondering if we should have more guard rails here?. app? I didn't really know what to call this, it's really the top-most part of the core state. The alternative would be to assume that all of this is wrapped in core and so we don't need an app wrapper:\nstate = {\n  core: {\n    selectedContentRef: Ref,\n    ...\n    preferences: { .. },\n    communication: { .. },\n    ...\n  }\n}. I didn't want to call it content since I feel like that's confusing the strings returned from the contents api with our in-app representation... thoughts? Also, it's nullable since we might not have the information if we asked for only type and filename from the api.. \ud83d\udcaf . Awesome! These look great!. \ud83e\udd23 . ah, didn't even realize that these were being set in desktop.. \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\ude43 . \ud83d\udcaf flow caught this?. I almost wonder if we should namespace these types... is there any scenario where we run into possible collisions?. Should we normalize this to import * as Immutable from \"immutable\"?. \ud83c\udf89 \ud83d\ude01 . ^^ nvm, these won't ever bleed out of our repo, so it's not an issue.. Yah, the one thing I got hung up on was that it's common for use to use fromJS in tests, but that causes selectors to fail if they expect a Record and use . (dot) accessors. I changed all the selectors to use get and getIn, which is a pretty easy compromise, but It is a little odd. I guess records all have defaults though, so there's no reason you couldn't instantiate one in a test with only the bits you need filled in?. Not gonna tear them out in this PR, but I'm for doing it if we think that folks will not be terribly bothered.\nSpeaking of knowing if folks are terribly bothered, do we have any plans on trying to get anonymized usage data from folks? It'd be cool if we could see how many people are actually sticking cells. That's a whole can of worms, but I'm curious if it's been discussed?. It needs those because it needs to do runAllCells and such:\nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/packages/core/src/components/notebook-menu/extra-handlers.js#L19\nBUT, if (when) we have an epic that does this for us... we can rip these out.. \ud83d\ude2c ah, yah, you're right, this is returning an observable of an observable, so mergeMap will only shell off the outer one, leaving empty() instead of just er... nothing. thanks!. Good point!. K, i was just following the naming conventions in the state. I think it might be clearer to change them both at the same time later.. But it probably needs to be a Record?. Yah, i can clean this up.. I'm not sure! I think flow should protect us in this case when we try to do anything with the selector, so i guess I'd rather return something and then have flow remind us that it could be null? I mostly say this because the error would likely originate somewhere in reselect code, which feels like it might be odd to debug?. Cool. I think the moral here is to return null in these cases. I don't think I want to throw in the selectors.... also i double-checked this (for sanity) and yes, just empty() should be returned.. Gonna do this after, but \ud83d\udcaf . \ud83e\udd14should all of these .get operations return a default of null then?. ah, right, i was thinking for currentNotebook instead of metadata. yes, i agree \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83d\udcaf . Just to make sure I'm on the same page, when we have refs for kernels, these will all take a KernelRef as the payload, right?. Amazin'!. Refresh (\ud83d\ude09) my understanding of why triggerKernelRefresh is going away here?. \ud83d\ude06 ya.. Ha, so this is what I was saying about of. If you just have values (which actions are) you can of(action1, action2). Just to be clear, I think from can be misleading in that it handles a larger set of input arguments. I'm not really that opinionated on it, but just wanted to point it out.. Nice and clean \ud83d\ude0e . I feel like this keeps coming up, but, concatMap? Or, switchMap? I'm trying to think through what should happen for multiple kernel restarts.. I.e., what's your rationale for mergeMap here?. \ud83c\udfad ! Dramatic comment award \u2b50\ufe0f . Am I misunderstanding, or, are we just clearing all outputs on kernel restart either way here?. np, just wanted to make sure that was intentional. I auto-add these when I create files now :). OK, totally boiler-plate-y, BUT, the idea is that you just set it and forget it when you configure your store. The big win here is that selectors become the Official\u2122\ufe0f way to look into the state tree. That means that we ca finally say the core state acts like a black box to all the other packages/applications \ud83c\udf89.\nI want to keep pausing at nice stopping points to make sure we're still on the same page. This still seem reasonable?. The state should look something like:\n{\n  ...\n  communication: {\n    kernelspecs: {\n      byRef: {\n        [REF]: {\n          loading: true,\n          error: null\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nWhere this assumes that you might have multiple kernelspecs. If we know there is only one possible kernelspec, then this isn't necessary. I thought that was the case though right?. \ud83d\udc80 oh man, totally bad copy pasta. Thanks for catching this!. \ud83d\ude06. ah yah, that it confusing... OK, that makes sense though!. I don't think there's additional information for the communication plan (this should be loading not isSaving, btw). For something like contents, it might actually be nice to have isSaving and isLoading, which could of course be combined into status: \"saving\" | \"loading\" or something.. Yup, exactly.. \ud83e\udd14 not a bad idea!. I'm going to pass on that for now and just use the defaults you suggested though. I'll leave a comment about it.\n. I think we decided that kernels know about their hosts, but hosts only have the kernelIds (so we're not duplicating state). So we'd have this list of running kernels via kernelIds.. @rgbkrk am I getting warmer? \ud83d\udd25?. ah, excellent, that's super helpful!. heh, nice. good enough for now!. heh, nice. good enough for now!. \u2728 . \ud83d\udcaf . \ud83d\udc4c . IMO, this feels a little too clever. Just because you're passing the whole store into the function, if it was more than a one-liner, maybe, but I think the just seeing filter(() => selectors.isCurrentHostJupyter(store.getState())) is pretty clear. Anyways, just my opinion :). \ud83e\udd47 . \ud83e\udd14 this one always strikes me as funny. But... the thing that we're trying to return is the ajax response, which is why we have to flatten it. If that fails, we hit the catchError, which needs to match the nested structure of the failed ajax, right? I.e., don't we need like a catchError(err => of(actions.killKernelFailed(err))) here?. Hmm. Now that I'm thinking about it, should this be wrapped as well?. Ah, yah, this spec explains what's going on: https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/src/internal/operators/catchError.ts#L14\nWhen one of the observables fails, you just switch to the one provided in the catchError instead. So yah, we definitely need this to be an observable.. Thanks!. \ud83d\ude47 . ;). Could you use the filename from the createContentsResponse at this point? I.e., instead of action.filename?. Gah, comment got swallowed. Could you use the filename from the createContentsResponse here?. I think this is just path actually. Right? I.e., not filePath. Just pointing out what I'm talking about below ^^. I gotta remember to set the type here! Nice.. Potentially. Is there a case when we have multiple epics listening for the same actions? If not, it's sorta nice when the naming lines up.. Cool, so the load action is gone now, and we just hook up this epic in place of the core fetchContent epic. I wonder if we should actually call this the fetchContentEpic now so that it's clear that we're using the desktop-specific fetchContentEpic, not the core fetchContentEpic?. \ud83d\udc4c ha, i totally had this in a stashed change locally. you beat me :). This is just synchronously returning an action, right? Couldn't we just map here?. Then, \"yes\". \ud83d\ude04 but you don't need todo that in this pr.. \ud83d\udc4c . We have some spacing css variables at this point. Don't feel like you need to update this now, but it might help with consistency in the future.. \ud83d\udc4c . \u2728 . \ud83d\ude1b . so dark.. If we set up the scales this way, can we follow the convention that we just .join('-') the keys together? I'm fine with it being an array since the keys here are just indices. I just want some common rule that helps me look at this config and guess that I'd get #1f77b4 from --nt-scale-category10-0. I.e., you were slipping an idx in there, which isn't specified anywhere in the config, so you'd just have to know that.. That said, this format in the config file should work. :+1:. https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/packages/styles/src/config.json#L145\nI think var(--nt-spacing-m) and then var(--nt-spacing-l) might work? There are always going to be places where you just need to push pixels a little bit, but I think we should strive for as much consistency here as possible. @rgbkrk this line was failing for me when I ran npm run app:jupyter-extension. Do we (1) have something transpiling this file and (2) if we do, any thoughts on why it wouldn't be working on my machine?. excellent commenting \ud83c\udf89 . \ud83d\udc4c . ^^ Might want to provide that as a code comment.. I tried searching around for this, is this a zeit thing?. I think this is a nice pattern. It's definitely saving us a bunch of duplication.. What do all these mainFields do? Does this mean a module could set it's webpack target as es2015 and we're going to provide a separate es2015 build? I.e., are we saying we're providing 5 different builds for all our packages?. >it's other modules that do that.\nah, i see, that makes sense, then. Thanks for the detailed explanation!. fun!. Eh, we're not using this yet, but might as well actually hook it up \ud83d\ude1b . We're going to want to map over this in the menu, right?. I'm pretty sure these weren't being used yet.. core is our main point of entry for core state moving forward.. @rgbkrk this is more or less what you were thinking for our byRef-y selectors, right?. Not being used yet, but I snuck these in.... ^^ Not all being used yet, but I snuck these in.. Ah, yah, can do!. ^^ sg!. Yah, that's what I was talking about last night. Is there a case where we will need an async fetchHost in the future?. hehe, totally, i think that's ok though. i'd rather have some overlap and cruft for a little bit as we converge rather than have a huge pr that never gets merged \ud83d\ude1b . Going with addHost since I think that's clearer. Set sorta feels like select to me.. Thoughts on this? I feel like we're not really fulfilling what we spec'd out in the plan.md doc.. OK?. >Probably want to have a selected property so that we're both adding and selecting this host.\nI think we discussed having selected content, not a selected host? Right? Like our model puts the document at the center of everything, and then uses that to set all the other context?. >The host has its own ref too right?\nNah, not unless it needs it, right? If we get to a place where the host needs it's own ref and it's not already being passed by a parent component, I'm down to add it, but I'm not sure it's totally necessary atm.. I've added @nteract/core/types, do you think we should keep /records in that? We're starting to duplicate work as you mentioned, we should make sure we have a plan to resolve the duplication in the future. Thoughts?. hehe, cuz I let my IDE do the refact \ud83d\ude06 changing. thanks!. \ud83d\ude06 . \ud83d\udc4d . currentIdsOfHiddenOutputs?. I'm not sure on this one, but I feel like this should be === true based on the naming of these things.. \ud83d\udc4c thanks for this!. Any reason for the trailing slash?. We're going to eventually not allow @nteract/core/* imports, right? Like we're going to change this to be a defacto import from @nteract/core, ya?. \ud83d\udcaf this is much nicer, imo.. \ud83d\udc4b . Nice. So, the only time I've seen this get hairy is when you have a sneaky cyclic import. I.e., it's possible to structure your code such that that providers is actually not yet defined here if there's some cyclic stuff going on, which will set NotebookApp and Styles to undefined for the life of this module. I don't think we're going to run into an issue here, but it's something that I've seen with this pattern before and you just get a runtime error, which can be confusing.. Otherwise, this is totally fine for now with the hope that we'll actually provide these as a top-level export later.. woo!. \ud83d\udcaf . Cool. The /components/presentational works for me.. The idea is that presentational components don't need connecting or anything right? They're like dumb components?. \ud83d\udc2e just export { Styles } from \"./styles\";. Ah, nice! \ud83d\udca5 . Ha, yah, I tried to filter it above to no avail :(.. So, this means that we are able to type value to whatever we want? I'll leave another comment where it's used.. I guess since this is set to *, i don't quite see what this is helping to assert? Not a disagreeing, just trying to understand.. huh, I'm surprised this wasn't an error before? What was flow thinking here to not throw?. Should these be * since they do have some type? By calling them any, flow is forced to give up trying to understand this type, right?. Heh, yah that's true. We should figure out the right names for all this stuff soon. I like that all this is under /state though, it makes it really easy to manage in the repo.. Yup, definitely worthwhile to not block that variable name \ud83d\ude06.. Are there any other iterations of /node_modules/ we'd want to guard against? /node_modules?  This is probably a naive comment, but it feels like this might be overly restrictive.. \ud83d\ude38 . Yah, i figured we'd want to be able to list them.. I think you were going to make core/modals optional, right? Can we get rid of some of these $FlowFixMes?. \ud83d\udc4c . \ud83c\udf89 . \ud83d\ude06 . \ud83d\ude47 thanks!. \ud83e\udd47 . ^^ That's a lovely idea \u2764\ufe0f . Inside core so core.modals. \u2728One less top-level reducer \u2728. The !action seems a little overkill. Can that happen? Seems like something we should be able to depend on.. Did you rename the currentKernelByRefCore selector?. How/Where do we know to kill the old one? . Hmm, maybe the name triggerKernelRefresh is just tripping me up. This isn't meant to kill some other kernel, eh?. Huh, that restarting flag seems odd here. Don't we have a separate restarting action?. sweet, this seems like it wasn't too bad to sneak these in here.. I think we should likely change these to *Ref keys. It's already getting confusing to try to use ref since you'll likely need to ref multiple things in the action. I'll do this when I add contentRef's all over the place.. \ud83d\udd2a . \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83c\udf89 . \ud83d\udc4d cool. I think you added some duplicated selectors. Mind cleaning the ones I added earlier up? I like your naming.. \ud83e\udd47 . \ud83d\udd2a the comment?. This should be caught by flow though, right?. Yah, this is definitely a little touchy. I'm actually surprised it just works. I thought that we were setting the next kernel in the reducer before this epic is hit.. so nice \u263a\ufe0f. \u26a1\ufe0f . gawd, thanks for changing all of these \ud83d\ude2c . ouch. thanks \ud83d\udc4d . I don't get it. I'm exporting all-the-things from contents and all-the-things are getting re-exported from state/index.js in this file... flow fails, but tests pass.... face << palm. how many times.... \ud83d\udc4c . \ud83d\udc04 import * ... style is our standard Immutable import, right?. \ud83e\udd47 nice!. thx \ud83d\ude04 . This is in NewNotebook though. I know we have this info on FETCH_CONTENT_FULFILLED. Yah! That helped a lot!. \ud83d\ude00 okie dokie. ~kernel ref~ content ref. I think this all worked out pretty well \u2b50\ufe0f. I like that it's all just top-level in stateModule. Records are pretty nifty.. \ud83d\ude38 . \u26a1\ufe0f . TODONE?. \u26a1\ufe0f ?. TODONE?. \ud83d\udc4d . Hmmm, why would this be a new document? The name is just changing right? Wasn't that part of the motivation for the decoupling of name/content?. Seems reasonable for desktop.. \ud83d\udc04 if you're just using state in the selector, i think the state variable is redundant:\nconst contentRef = selectors.currentContentRef(store.getState());. we also have created, which i'm not sure if that would be first save? or this moment?. What was the deal with this?. I wonder if it makes sense to centralize this in the selector? Same with the not connected below?. We can officially \u26a1\ufe0f these (also in jext) by the end of this pr, right? no one will be using document?. Thanks for leaving a note! \u2764\ufe0f . ~kernel ref~ content ref. \ud83d\udc4d . heh. \ud83d\udc4d . slick \ud83d\ude0e . Just out of curiosity. Is this filename a filename or a filepath at this point? I can't recall if this variable name is being used appropriately.. \ud83d\udc4d . Should we just this in a future PR?. Oh interesting. Because it's already inside a particular entry in byRef, we don't actually need to specify it at this point. Either way, we should do some factoring-out of these as I think we've talked about and agree on \ud83d\udc4d . Is this still path? didn't we make a move to filepath? Or is that isolated to other parts of the codebase?. \ud83d\udc4d . Thanks for leaving a note! \ud83d\ude47 . \ud83d\udc4c . OK for now. Thanks for dropping a note.. Seems like this wouldn't be too hard. But no need to do it now.. heh. i'm surprised you didn't run into a crazy amount of flow errors here.. Can't we have a null here still? Is that going to be a problem?. Will this end up like blah.ipynb.pdf?. \ud83d\udea8 wait a tick. \npath.basename('/foo/bar/baz/asdf/quux.html', '.html');\n// Returns: 'quux'\n^^ from the docs\nI think we don't actually want to call this filepath here. It's not. maybe just basename and then compoese filepath later when it actually is the filepath?. \ud83d\udc4c . Did this come up as part of changing the selector types?. huh, what the heck is a truthy cellPagers that .get can be missing?. Should this be renamed currentFilepath?. I guess I meant, don't we set filepath to null in our Record and we only handle undefined above, not undefined || null.. \ud83e\udd47 . super nit, but, this variable should probably be filepath to be consistent?. Couple notes:\n\nfullpath$ --> filepath$?\n\"Untitled\" as the default seems not to qualify as a filepath, does it?\nselectors.currentFilepath(state) should likely handle returning this default.\n\nNon-blocking on these, just wondering if you had thoughts on it.. So, maybe this is actually just my misunderstanding. But something like fake.ipynb means that this exists at ./fake.ipynb? and . is the cwd where the notebook server was started?. Need to record-ify notebooks, eh \ud83d\ude1b. \ud83d\udc4d . Can use use \"\" instead of Untitled where we've defaulted to the latter in other places?. Like, some parts of the app have used this selector, but defaulted to Untitled. I'm wondering if we should (a) return Untitled here, or (b) use \"\" in place of Untitled?. \u26a1\ufe0f . \ud83d\udc4c . \ud83d\udc4c solid!. What's the limitation here again?. Should we be auto-opening this in a new tab? Or, is this the same behavior as the classic view?. Can we use a color from our theme?. Are you just writing this as an anon-function in the connect call to get around multiple mapStateToProps functions or something? I feel like we should probably just define it as its own function for clarity.. \ud83d\udc4c . Any issues around rendering images and such? Maybe we should leave a TODO in here?. Can we type the state here or will * get us the same answer? I'm actually a little unclear if being specific ends up being redundant if * can suffice in a lot of cases?. Define props / state types?. \u2728 squeaky clean \u2728 . I liked your idea on the ContentsPlaceholder idea here as a type instead of dummy. Not sure what the type string should be, \"placeholder\"?. Is this the default? Maybe a comment here on why we're assuming \"\" === \"/\"?. lol. Maybe a friendlier message \ud83d\ude00 . maybe opt for a switch? We seem to use that pattern elsewhere over this if-ing.. Are you creating a separate variable here for typing? I.e., why not map directly over action.payload.model.content?. \ud83d\udcaf for your comments.. \ud83d\udc4c . \ud83e\udd14 do we have a concept of non-notebook metadata? I'm fine with leaving this for safety. Just curious.. This is because we allow null, but not undefined in related action creators?. Ditto here, it's probably more accurate to return null here, but I get that this is likely easier on Flow.. Why Set over List?. We've now got empty, placeholder, unknown and dummy floating around. Let's consolidate our language around this to prevent future confusion.. Can you comment on when / why we'd have an empty host?. Awesome, thanks!. \u2728. Nice. Yah, this definitely didn't make sense before.. \ud83d\udc4c . Nice. I like that these are split out now \ud83d\udc4d . ~runs~ returns. Wait... this isn't true. You're returning an empty list above aren't you? What's the intended behavior?. nit, hasBeenSaved would be like !!disk and isDirty would be like Immutable.is(original, disk), right? Just a little confused by the naming?. \ud83d\udca5 . \ud83d\udc4c . \ud83d\udc4d . Were you intending to TODONE these in this PR?. Perhaps this happens in a later commit though. I'm going one-by-one.. nit: sessionId (not that you really changed that here...). Nice!. Oh dang! Good idea!. \ud83d\udc4d . :zap:?. Ah, I see where you're coming from... yah, i suppose that makes sense. I can make a follow up PR to do that.. This is why launch kernel successful is taking a content ref. I didn't know when the content should update it's kernel ref though. should it do it immediately? or only after success here?\n. See https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/2715/files#r178346701. Hmm. I was considering it like when you killKernel, you give it the kernel you want to kill. And change kernel gets the kernel you wan to change. Since the killing happens under-the-hood here in the sessions api, I think that fits a little better. Does that change your mind at all \ud83d\ude01?. Is that something for this PR or can it hold off until a later date?. RUNTIME_CHANGE_KERNEL is a menu. Whereas CHANGE_KERNEL is a menu-action (meant to be suffixed with a kernelSpecName). Heh. Not sure I understand that comment. What other comment / thought is this referring to?. Yep. Totally.. Ya! I wanted to ask you if you had thoughts on this one. I didn't really want to handle it here \ud83d\ude1b. Can we do a follow up for this?. Cool. You might be starting to convince me. I'll have a look and maybe update that!. Should this be Immutable here?. Nice, trying out the wrapper version of this?. Other than checking in the render method of this component of the parent component, I don't think there's a better pattern (if I'm understanding your question correctly).. Nice, thanks for cleaning these all up as well.. \ud83d\ude01 . \ud83d\udcaf for standardizing these!. Possibly fixed? https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/commit/0c5ca8f344908e3c5b106bae7b008948e6a9f859. \ud83e\udd47 . I think I left a comment on this before. But I didn't see the resolution. Should we have this as an Immutable List?. Better variable names?. Ah. OK, i see you handle it here. \ud83e\udd14 Still trying to understand why we need the Array? If anything, maybe the correct thing to do is type the API response and then type the resulting state separately?. \ud83d\udc4c . \ud83d\udc4d . \ud83c\udf89 . Yah. I think we want it to be model.kernelRef, but I'm guessing there's a race condition for getting that to be set? I.e., we might need to get here before the content gets returned or something?. You should be able to import all this at once from the top level state.. Minor, but it feels weird to set it to undefined here. Can we use null?. \ud83d\ude01 i like the generic default \ud83d\udc4d .. even better!. \ud83d\udc4d cool. i like it.. Are we allowing arbitrary tags? I.e., anything goes?. \ud83d\ude47 . Could shorten this one. tags => tags.has(tag) ? tags.remove(tag) : tags.add(tag);. Part of me is questioning wether it really makes sense to associate some tag parameters here with Papermill. The cell just has a tag, and we're currently using that tag in Papermill. However, I don't know if this code should really know about Papermill? Thoughts?. ",

    "BrenBarn": "What's the status on this?  I just encountered this problem.  Without nbagg, working in nteract is in some sense a step backwards from regular IPython/Jupyter.. > nteract is not seeking to be a replacement for all users - people can and should still flock to the classic Jupyter notebook as well as JupyterLab.\nWhat I'm seeking is a thing that is exactly Jupyter/IPython notebooks, but on the desktop, without a web browser.  Are you saying that's not what nteract is?. I apologize, didn't mean to sound harsh there.  I sometimes have to remind myself that issue comment threads are not one big conversation and things that might seem just part of the chatter to one audience can appear to come out of nowhere when I start commenting on a different project! :-)\nNteract looks very cool and in fact I'm using it even as we speak.  But, to ask the same question in a hopefully less abrasive way: My initial impression of nteract was that it was Jupyter wrapped in some kind of mini-browser that allows it to be used on the desktop.  I was expecting the usage to be exactly like regular Jupyter, but in this desktop interface rather than a web browser.  What this thread made me wonder is whether the scope of nteract is in fact that, or more than that (i.e., aimed at developing a richer interface), or less than that (i.e., aimed at implementing a simplified Jupyter-like interface rather than just straight-up deploying Jupyter in a desktop environment)..

Hi @v3ss0n!\nYes, that were my thoughts exactly over the weekend. Using, pywebview or cefpython to run an jupyter server and close the server when the window closes should be relatively simple. Unfortunately I tried both frameworks, but they do not work reliably on windows. \nThat said, I guess the nteract approach has much more flexibility and can go way beyond the browser interface. \n. @captainsafia Thanks! It's a minor detail, that you only notice when it's not there:). @captainsafia Thanks! You can leave it open, and I'll try to find the time in the next few weeks (I estimate getting the development environment set up will take most of the time).\n. PS: hope I'm not submitting to many issues, I do try to check if these are duplicates, but finding the right keywords is sometimes tricky. . @rgbkrk Thanks, I'll try either electron or QtWebEngine. I also looked at pywebview, ghost and NW.js.\n. @rgbkrk Thanks for the tips; even nbdime itself is well worth checking out! ('ve forgot about it for a year and now I'm very impressed).\n. @maphew I think the javascript kernel is included in nteract. For python you have to install jupyter notebook. \nDid you run python -m ipykernel install --user  as stated? Do you have jupyter package installed. \nI recommend the conda package manager, then you can just do conda install ipykernel.. I would guess this is a duplicate of #1470.. @AlJohri I guess shortcuts will have to become configurable when nteract start to become seriously popular.

    "robertmitchellv": "Hey @rgbkrk I would really love to try and help support this if I can--do you think this would be a 'first PR' kind of task? I would need some help/guidance (since I mostly do analysis work in R) but I'd really love to make the .Rmd file extension an executable in nteract \ud83d\ude4c \nI've really loved this app for a long time now and think it would be really neat.. No, I think you're right about the knitr code chunk options--there are tons of ways these can be really useful. The tufte package is a good example of this with options for margin notes, full-width visualization, margin visualizations, etc. There's also the yaml headers that also contain very useful options for converting EDA to a bootstrap style HTML document with syntax highlighting and other options. These things are all wonderful, but they are only really needed during rendering, and there are R functions to do this outside of an IDE, so, I think there can be a workaround to get the best of both worlds (abstractly/generally; since I don't know how hard it would be to do this).\nIs it possible to have rmarkdown supported (as you suggested above) where nteract knows to render rmarkdown as it would any notebook while ignoring most of the knitr options other than eval = F? Is it possible to have metadata associated with a code chunk so that nteract can operate from an Rmd file in a way that makes sense from the perspective that nteract was designed while also putting those pieces back together when finished? Sort of like abstracting the ipynb away from the user?

    "mpacer": "I'm intrigued by this possibility and feel like there are two aspects to this proposal. \nOn the one hand, having this information in an easily editable form would be amazingly useful.  \nLaying out the information like this would be great for a variety of use cases (quick publication or keeping contact information available to students throughout a tutorial or talk).\nBut the display and the editing don't need to be handled in exactly the same way and their unification may not be good for all use cases (e.g., I generally don't like editing text at multiple different font sizes\u2026 I don't know if others share this dispreference but I am guessing that I'm not alone in this).\nFortunately, that seems like it would be easy enough to solve by having it visible in one mode and have it editable in another (perhaps triggered with a little \u270f\ufe0f  type icon that indicates \"edit\" in other cases). \nIn terms of stickiness and ease of access vs. real estate concerns: is it possible to have an event trigger this to drop down attached to a small element (perhaps the same as the edit triggering element?), and make that element sticky (as opposed to making the title display itself sticky)? . I\u2019d be interested in working on it next quarter :), so I\u2019m looking forward to chatting more.. @bollwyvl, would your solution that you talked about today for lazy loading a graphviz emscripten bundle apply to nteract as well?. I don't see the Papermill metadata or is it just \"Executing with Papermill\" bit?. In a slightly different prototype, could you give an example of what the banner would look like in the case where one cell has been completely run, one of the middle cells with code has not yet completed execution and a third cell has not had its message dispatched? Those seem to be the three kinds of state that need to be expressed in order to give people an idea of the execution sequence (as exhibited by the difference between the status metadata values \"pending\", \"running\" and \"completed\").\nThe current prototype suggests that all of the cells have been run and so it's not clear what \"Executing with Papermill\u2026\" entails. \nIs it the first cell that is currently being executed? Then why haven't the outputs from the later cells been cleared and why do the later cells have execution counts? \nIf it is indicating that some of the cells are being executed\u2026 which cells are in the process of execution? \nIf all the cells have already been executed, why does it still display the banner at all? Is it merely stating that the execution was organised by papermill rather than via a standard notebook UI?. Shall I guess that the * is added by other machinery not touched by this PR (keyed to replace the execution count with the class \"cell-running\")? Because I don't see that being in the code you modified. But yes\u2026 this makes much more sense\u2026 my only remaining question is why the \"Executing with Papermill\u2026\" is necessary once you have the ability to reinsert the * to the execution count without relying on its existence in the notebook file.. There's no explicit jsonschema for v1 or v2 in nbformat which probably is\npart of why.\nOn Wed, Sep 13, 2017 at 09:11 Kyle Kelley notifications@github.com wrote:\n\nHow old exactly?

Where is the markdown rendering happening in the codebase?. Also if you align the * with the text above (I.e., one more space before each of them) how well does that work?. Shouldn't we be able to use the React.children.map trick to bubble up onClick events on arbitrary element types? Something like that which @rgbkrk and I stumbled upon at the react workshop\u2026\nI think it was a code pattern along the lines of:\n\njavascript\nReact.children.map(this.props.children, (child) => \n  {React.cloneElement(child,{\n    onClick: () => {\u2026}\n    })\n  })\nThat would mean not restricting to buttons.. I have a few clarifying questions. I'll have them written by tomorrow.. I'm guessing that this is supposed to map on to \n\n[ ] [@nteract/transform-vdom]transform-vdom\n[ ] [@nteract/transforms]transforms\n[ ] [@nteract/display-area][display-area]\n\nBut how am I to interpret the @nteract bits?\n[display-area]: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/master/packages/display-area. So there's nothing special about the @nteract name other than that's the convention used to describe a namespace for npm meta-packages that hold other packages? Is the / special? Or is it similarly just a convention? . OK, we worked it out. \nThis can occur when either of the two cases happen:\n\n\nyou don't wait long enough for the npm run build:desktop:watch to finish before running npm run spawn\n\n\nIf you are running npm run start in a third terminal at the same time as npm run build:desktop:watch\n\n\nSo the solution is to make sure that npm run build:desktop:watch finishes before running npm run spawn. My guess is the readme should reflect that condition.. it'd be better to figure out a way to delay the spawn before closing, since build:desktop:watch never really does finish (as it's watching for changes and occupies the terminal).. I feel like this approach to using didComponentCatch is missing the point of it somewhat given all the ways people have talked about using it. In no cases I've found are people explicitly passing in an error. . closing in favour of #2031 . I took this approach because the didComponentCatch method needs to be defined one layer above the component that is throwing the error, so wrapping everything in this manner seemed like the best way to go.. When i've tried doing it at the level of RichestMime it catches it but then stops rendering everything. When i do it at the lower levels it catches it and still renders everything else.. closing in favour of #2031 . I'm really confused, when I run this locally returning the childrens' props\u2026 \nany thoughts would be appreciated.. as commented here: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/2350#issuecomment-361791267, \nthere is an issue with remark-math and consistency with the Jupyter ecosystem. Specifically it treats within paragraph $$\u2026$$ as being an inline element, when the rest of the Jupyter ecosystem treats it as a display element.\nHere's a catalogue of ways this can diverge (in classic notebook & lab all of these would render as )\nConsistent (\u2714\ufe0f): \n(newlines) \u2192 display:\n\nInconsistent (\u274c):\n(no newlines) \u2192 inline:\n\n(no first newline, yes last newline) \u2192  undefined:\n\n(yes first newline, no last newline) \u2192 display + extra $$\n\n. Is there a good way to get the list of available kernels inside an environment directly from binder or do we use the kernels from rx-jupyter to accomplish that?. > We'd have to use the jupyter kernelspecs API to find out.\n~~Do you mean these: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/kernelspecs/handlers.py~~\n~~because if so, both of the handlers assume that you know the name of the kernel and so this may require a notebook server change to be possible\u2026~~\nAh! so /api/kernelspecs should do what we need to do. My guess is that should be done in rx-jupyter. Is that out of scope for this PR or should i work on that.. So, if we only clear the logs (see recent commit)\u2026 this results slightly bizarre behaviour if you submit multiple times in rapid succession:\n\nThoughts?. Can we shut down the previous server today? or is there no API for that?. why is eslint failing? I'm confused because both of the labels have an htmlFor attribute that matches the input ids\u2026. K, got the shutdown working before switching to a new image (with no delay unlike suggested in #2126 because we aren't shutting down the page\u2026 so we can wait until we receive the response rather than aborting after some period of time). I may not have implemented that 100% correctly, but I think it's doing its job.. I've got to call it a night, but I did track down and fix another bug in a somewhat hacky way. \nIf you were to go to an invalid address and then tried to go back to a valid address, it would fail because it no longer had a serverConfig.\nRather than doing that I'm now storing the old ServerConfig and messages and then setting them if it catches an error. I'm sure this is not the right way to do this\u2026 but at least it makes this substantially more functional than if you only implemented the killing of the server.\nNB: I would have moved the state setting until after the initialize function, but whenever I did that the state setting simply never occurred. I wasn't able to figure out why that was.. LGTM i think this is ready. This actually requires fixing the value in the main editor/styles.js file in addition to play.nteract.io/index.js.\nOnce we set word-spacing:0px everything is aligned.\n\nfixed with 3b548d9. I'll stop making comments on the doc changes! this looks good for now!. Doesn't actually make a file browser or anything, just dumps a payload to the console, but it doesn't error! And that's a great improvement!. No longer WIP!. LGTM. Made https://github.com/captainsafia/nteract/pull/1 to fix the ternary and imports so that jsx didn't get grumpy. \nThe styles still aren't quite\u2026 right (e.g., dark doesn't show the text right now) but with \n2622b85 they are loaded correctly.. > Do we want source/outputs in ui state? Or, should they belong per-kernel?\nWe had talked about not requiring a 1 kernel at a time model for everything\u2026 I'm not sure if my intuition is that you'd keep the code run in them around as well. \nMy intuition is that we should start the kernels clean and therefore start the source clean as well.. Clear outputs each time source is run \u2014 that would seem to be done in an epic\u2026how would we ensure that it is cleared before the output messages are received and not after (which would be a fairly unpleasant UX)?. > Is that what you're asking? I just saw @rgbkrk 's comment and now I'm not sure if I understood correctly.\nThe order of events matters (if I submit code & it comes back quickly and it only then clears the outputs we'll have a nondeterministic UI).  \nI'm asking how we can ensure that we don't clear output from the most recent submitted source.. If we give each source that is submitted an id, then mapping outputs to input should be straightforward, but would be more state to manage inside the kernel.\n\nis there a way to map a kernel output to an input @rgbkrk ? then the kernel state should keep an inputId hunk of state as well, right?\n\nyes, but we can just create the inputId as a uuid on the fly, i think?. am i correct that RUN_SOURCE doesn\u2019t trigger any reducers currently? In which case creating a reducer that clears outputs would be the right way to go? (since reducers are always run before epics?). > yup, and that was my first suggestion. however, you could also just go ahead and have the activeKernelOutputs handle the RUN_SOURCE type by just clearing itself.\nSo I think this won't deal with the delayed messages coming back from a different execution request. which is what kyle was pointing toward above.. Would it be cleaner to have a CLEAR_OUTPUTS actionType in case other parts of the code eventually need to do this as well?. So I\u2019ve been thinking about it and I think on the similarity to notebook grounds we should keep the source in the ui independent of the kernel. But that we shouldn\u2019t alter the source currently in the cell when switching kernels to address the \u201coh I meant python 3\u201d case since it then would be a matter of switching kernels and that wouldn\u2019t change what they\u2019ve written.\nRe:merging, What more needs to be addressed testing-wise? In terms of new tests and shouldn\u2019t we make the current tests pass before merging?. @theengineear would love to have your review.. It might be nice to go back to 5 suites for Travis (since it can run 5 test suites concurrently) and rennovate bot is not currently swamping the repo with PRs. It probably still makes sense to keep them 1 test for appveyor.. I think this is already the case?. For now I'm going to stick to setting the language with a string, as that we can reliably handle from the kernelspec info.\nSo you think this should be at the ui level? I can do that it \u2014 just seems strangely clunky that we can't set this at the same time when we set the kernelSpec info, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something.. In this case does \"properties\" == props? Or are properties a special kind of thing in javascript like they are in python? or what exactly do you mean?. > Properties are an association of keys to values in objects. They're what you'd call attributes with Python objects. To make matters worse (better?), HTML uses the term attributes.\nActually to make matters even worse(better?)\u2026 in Python, properties (as declared by the @property decorator or the property function) allow you to create functions that are treated as attributes on you classes. (slight hand-waving with \"treated as\", but I figure for asides this is an appropriate level of detail). \n. \n\njs\nactionsArray.push(\n  actions.setLanguageInfoForKernel(serverId, kernelName, message.content.language_info)\n)\n\nAh! That is beautifully clear! Thank you for addressing all of my questions so clearly!\nI'm going to keep the current mechanism because it's a simpler api for someone to implement in another part of the code (in case that is ever needed). Rather than creating an entire language_info if they only want to use that to set the  SET_CURRENT_KERNEL_LANGUAGE action (e.g., if the kernel_info doesn't match what the person was looking for & they want to change it). \nBut I will implement another for the mode as well (I see why you linked to that now), since that is a field inside kernel_info.. Realised that the currentKernelLanguage should be highlightedLanguage due to its different purpose while I was trying to figure out how to do the languageInfo bit which has turned out to be substantially more tricky than I expected.. Ok I think these should work now, including setting the Codemirror mode info (at least as retrieved from the kernel).. I should note that to actually use that CodeMirror mode info would require a more substantial restructuring of the way that the current editor handles setting the mode, it is currently works through setting the language string: \nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/82611f8e92949da8e145ecb38b19b6e828e13a1c/packages/editor/src/index.js#L98\nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/82611f8e92949da8e145ecb38b19b6e828e13a1c/packages/editor/src/index.js#L230-L233\nI'll try to include a refactor for there, but I'm somewhat unsure about how to handle that most safely without disrupting other parts of the codebase that are using only the language prop.. Not actually how to debug whether the way that codemirror is being set is appropriate because it's not a matter of setting the react prop (which I know works) but rather how codemirror is working on the js side. . I think this may close #2244 but I could be wrong since that's based on my reinterpretation of that issue.. Not quite sure how to force serverId to be removed from the store\u2026which in light of your comment seems like the right thing to do.. Thank you for the comment about omit I wouldn't have thought of that! \nOne of the things that I'm running into is the way that createObjectReducer works in combination with the way that reducers' keys map to the state inside combineReducers. \nAny pointers?. ok i made some progress on this but now I'm running into a really strange issue:\nthe shutdown api is returning a 405 Method not allowed.\nI'll push my changes so far.. It is a preflight being rejected in the console\u2026I wasn't able to trace down\nwhat that exactly meant\u2026 and it's getting the same config that all the\nother rx-jupyter calls were getting, but it definitely could be on the\nrx-jupyter side of things.\nOn Sat, Dec 30, 2017 at 1:36 PM, Kyle Kelley notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nMerged #2260 https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/2260.\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/2260#event-1405186112, or mute\nthe thread\nhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ACXg6IL_SqppVuROhv_rC8Hfm4fCprgHks5tFqz3gaJpZM4ROAKp\n.\n. So this is great! Much simpler! \n\nUnfortunately, it introduces some really confusing nomenclature things \u2014 we seem to have duplicate names for providers and components. Presumably these have different purposes and \"signatures\"\u2026 maybe we could postfix \"View\" onto all of the view only components with little logic inside them? . At the least, with them having the same names, there would be no way for someone to import both providers and components without renaming some of them or using the module itself as a namespace (which seems potentially annoying). \nI'm not really sure which should be the \"default\" though, the provider (implying that we postfix View or Component something to the component names) or the component (implying that we postfix App or Container or Provider or something to the provider names). \nMaybe to avoid confusion we could add both postfixes?. > Normally, as you see with the Toolbar component and the provider version of the Toolbar component, they do map between the view component and the provider. The provider version merely augments the view to have callbacks hooked up to dispatch.\nAH \u2014 so in that case the expectation is that you'd only want one or the other so they can easily be swapped out for each other.\nOk in that case, I think my comments on the MarkdownPreview class need clarification. I thought the primary distinction was between \"functional\" pieces (callbacks, event management &c.) vs. \"display\" pieces (styling, layout, class assignment, passing props, mapping props to children). That is pretty different from this distinction between the redux store connected components which I now understand this to be focusing on. It just happened to be the case that most of the components in components weren't too js heavy and focused on what I was calling display. \nI still think that \"functional\" vs. \"display\" split should also occur. But perhaps that should occur later\u2026\n\nRight now I think I'm in favor of calling all the provider versions Connected, so ConnectedToolbar, ConnectedNotebook, etc. What do you think?\n\nMy only concerned is that it doesn't actually specify that it's specifically intended to be connected to a redux store (not any generic state manager), but I think that can be mentioned in the docs and so should be fine.. > In some cases, they're intertwined -- especially as it relates to \"active\", \"selected\", etc. We'll figure it out together over time here.\nMakes sense! Happy to be on the journey with ye. \n\n (from @nteract/core/components) --> \n\nThat seems to fit its purpose more cleanly too. \n\n from @nteract/core/providers --> \n\nYou technically don't need to change this since you got rid of the old Notebook component.\n\n from provider will get broken apart as it's one of those components that get too much threaded through. That's what #2218 was seeking to accomplish.\n\nHrm\u2026 I see what you mean about the dethreading in #2218. But when you say broken apart do you also mean creating separate components rather than working over one gigantic switch statement?. If it's read-only, it seems a little bit odd to call it  <Editor/> wouldn't it be more accurately <CodeRenderer/>, <SourceDisplay/>, or <SourceView/> or something?. So then wouldn't it be more accurate to call it <SourceContainer/> (or even <Code/> or <Source/>) so that it doesn't imply that you can edit the rendered content?. Is there a reason why <Code/> or <Source/> wouldn't work? . Lgtm. Sweet! A few questions:\nIs import MarkdownRenderer from \"commonmark-react-renderer\"; still needed with this change?\nAre there any known quirks about react-markdown that we should look out for?\nCan you give a rough idea of how it avoids the problems with MathJax?  I ask both because I'm generally curious and because the classic notebook's solution (yank out the mathjax, run markdown and replace the mathjax) isn't my favorite and I'd love to see a better solution.\nDo our test files include commands with \n\na single punctuation mark following the slash: \\, , \\;\n? The example snapshots don't seem to handle that. \n\n@rgbkrk Am I correct in thinking that nteract doesn't and won't support the double slash LaTeX delimiters (\\\\(\u2026\\\\) and \\\\[\u2026\\\\]; n.b.: the dollar signs are technically TeX delimiters and so are dispreferred by some)?\nHow does this handle multiline LaTeX blocks defined with \\begin{.*}\u2026\\end{.*}?. @nteract What are the LaTeX and Markdown transforms? Do you mean the transforms for the output mimetypes?\n. What is the Remark-math plugin doing now? . ~~I'm going to see if I can get this working without remark-math since I don't get why that extra parsing should be necessary if react-markdown is doing its job.~~\nI understand now why it needs to be there, but it has some issues.. There are still some parsing issues (e.g., it shouldn't matter whether I put new lines after the $$)\nContrast:\nWith no newlines it renders this as a inline math element\n\nWith newlines it renders this as a equation math element\n\n. It appears that this is a feature of Remark-math (though I disagree):\n\nDouble dollars in inline\nSome TeX packages and Markdown processors use double dollars, $$, as a inline token. Remark Math will parse it also properly.\n$$\\alpha$$\n\nhttps://github.com/Rokt33r/remark-math#double-dollars-in-inline\nBased on some of the content at this math-in-markdown wiki, it's mostly git related applications based on kramdown (e.g., GitBook, gitter)  that have this convention (where $$\u2026$$ is treated as inline and not a display equation). \nThis is not what either notebook or lab uses for its interpretation of math syntax. It also is not, by default, what mathjax itself expects (where $$\u2026$$ is to be treated as a display equation). \nRemark math has a feature that enables something that is somewhat like a display equation if you add the right css, but that seems super fragile.\nSo this is going to be a huge improvement, but is going to move away from consistency (in this small regard) with the rest of the jupyter ecosystem.. Lgtm!. Merging because the only thing that I don\u2019t agree with is stylistic. Really nice & clear code!. shouldn't this change the results of some of the jest tests? If not, we should cover this test case in them.. Should the below actually produce a math object? I\u2019m not sure\u2026 I think that would be invalid LaTeX not sure about mathjax\u2026\n$$$\n    \\alpha\n  $$$. Why do https://github.com/tlyon3/nteract/blob/1ad8dfb268e880067b49d9eca54067d6e8e4fffd/packages/markdown/tests/remark-math-spec.js#L214 and https://github.com/tlyon3/nteract/blob/1ad8dfb268e880067b49d9eca54067d6e8e4fffd/packages/markdown/tests/remark-math-spec.js#L146 differ?\nCould you include additional text  surrounding the math in the inline mathblock cases to indicate that they are being treated appropriately? \nI really don\u2019t like remarkmaths distinction between inlinemathdouble vs math block. In LaTeX they\u2019re the same, & in mathjax they\u2019re the same. I think I\u2019d prefer us to keep to exactly one way to interpret math blocks rather than following down that path.. Could you include more complicated mathematical expressions that conflict with markdown (e.g., including underscores for subscripts vs italics). I\u2019ve found this to be a likely point of parsing errors in the classic notebook, so it\u2019s worth including.. Could you add some tabular examples that have dollar signs inside the contents? That\u2019s also a known place for parsing conflicts.. This looks great! \nWe could remove the commented out stuff, but I'm going to merge this as is and we can do that later in a cleanup PR.\nThank you for all the hard work!. I almost think that a nicer way to approach this would be to have a way to approach LaTeX and mathjax separately where they could play separate roles. (e.g., with _repr_mathjax_ rendering in the browser using mathjax and allowing _repr_latex_ to be used specifically for LaTeX). That way we could easily handle the two cases by having separate ways of specifying things depending on the appropriate format.. If you wrap the first part in an in-line equation ($\u2026$) does it successfully render in both cases? The issue with \\mathrm in LaTeX is that it\u2019s only valid in math mode.. having global .babelrc files seems reasonable, and deduplicating jsx classes seems to surely be an improvement.. merging. I don't know the differences for these version numbers, but it passes the tests. So, merging.. > Since showcase is now really nice for prototyping components, I've started it in there. I'll move it into core once ready.\nI can put this into a new issue\u2026, but I think it would help people begin working on the project if there were a tutorial showing a full walkthrough of how to use showcase for working on this kind of prototype.\nCurrently there is one design file in our doc/ folder, I'm not even sure where that tutorial file would go\u2026. Sort of\u2026 both? I was thinking that this would be a good example of a component that I wouldn't have had a good idea of how to properly prototype inside showcase. \nI had thought of showcase as a way to display the notebook components in a standard structure \u2014 it makes sense for it to be used more generally, I just hadn't thought about that in that way. \nIn any case, even if it's not this component exactly a complete walkthrough of how you prototyped an entire actual component (i.e., not a toy example but a component that was actually built for use in the nteract repository) would be super helpful.. in talking with @rgbkrk on slack I thought of a few things that might be useful to cover\n\n\u201cIn which directory do I need to create a new file? \u201d\n\u201cWhat libraries will I need (e.g., React), how do I import them?\u201d \n\u201cWhere do I need to add an object with what structure to be able to get anything at all on the page?\u201d\n\u201cHow do I start up the nextjs server to definitely show this prototype?\u201d \n\u201cHow do I know where I should be adding things into the page? Is there a good place to start adding things?\u201d \n\u201cHow do I figure out what data to fake (in what structure?) in order to show the prototype?\u201d\n\u201cDo I need to make this something that can be hooked up to redux to get actual data?\u201d. Great! I'll merge once circleci is done :).. I'm hesitant around this\u2026 \n\nPython packaging & virtual environments are complicated enough and extremely confusing to people. \nI don't know enough about how virtualenv works to know whether that would be an ok thing to do\u2026 with conda I don't know how it would treat pip . If we were going to do this it might be safer to do a python -m pip rather than plain pip the executable.\nAlso, this doesn't give them any insight as to how to uninstall it (which we should probably add to the README now that I think about it). Importantly, it wouldn't give you any idea of how to remove the configuration file (though of course\u2026 right now we don't mention this in the README either so that could be solved). \nAlso, I think it'd be nicer if people could learn about this app exclusively as \"nteract_on_jupyter\" and not \"jupyter-extension\", but that's going to require a more general renaming approach than can be fixed right now (which I think we talked about).\nAll that said\u2026  if we want people to install from the root of the repo they could do \npip install -e  applications/jupyter-extension \u2026 but they'd still need to run the serverextension enabling command. Is the key win here being able to run this from the root of the repo or only having one command to run for both?\nWe could put a config file somewhere for them as part of the install (at <your env path>/etc/jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.d/nteract_on_jupyter.json even though setuptools won't handle that itself with the data_files argument\u2026 but I don't know if there are any hooks in pip uninstall to then go back and remove it later (which is what a non-editable pip uninstall nteract_on_jupyter will do via the setuptools data_files logic).. Is there anything else you want me to add to this?. oh ok\u2026 well the vdom was the easiest to do\u2026 i'm having trouble even raising an error on the mimerender side i'll make a different branch for that. grazie! wasn't sure what type of thing the info would be.\nalso i'm wondering if we should just have a componentDidCatch method at the top level of the application\u2026. Great idea to make this a standalone component. This is making me think the ErrorBoundary should exist as a separate module so anywhere in the codebase can access it.. Yep I was thinking errorBoundary should be a module that takes a renderprop and as we need it we can customise the rendering (in this case using the Fallback Component).. To clarify, I think semantically it makes more sense to have an ErrorBoundary wherever we discover the need for  it, customizing the formatting to be specific to that case.\nAnd with that consideration\u2026 I would normally hesitate from making code architecture decisions on the sole basis of it being a test more akin to what was already present. \nBasically I think we'll eventually want error handling elsewhere and we should deal with these problems (incl. the testing issue) in a way that makes it easy for people in the future to add error handling without needing to work through these issues again.. Could you say more about what you mean?\nI assumed that we'd need to redirect to the standard binder interface since it provides a file browser. Given that repos can have more than one notebook I wasn't sure how the current play interface would accommodate that & introducing such a UI would have a much larger scope.\nBut I recognise that I may not be following you entirely, & in any case I'm definitely open to discussion.. I didn't address this in the most recent push. Will start on that now.. +1. \u2713. Sounds good.. When you say accessibility of plain HTML forms, can you point me to a resource as to what you mean by that? Is there something special I need to do to ensure that (e.g., am I not supposed to have a callback)?. Couldn't this begin with Edit code, write prose, and visualize data? It gives it parallel structure and if someone doesn't know what markdown is they can still understand the header.. This is repeated above in L22 can it be in only one place?. Could this be made into a npm run command that takes an argument? I don't know enough about the npm commands to know whether this is the kind of thing that can be customised for npm run. Not a blocker, but maybe an issue once this is merged.. link to above rather than duplicate text?. What about: \nEdit code, write prose, visualize data!. Does this work without the $(npm build)/lerna prefix?. Given that you've already introduced the lerna publish command might it be fair to only explain the second part? If not, I think this might confuse someone who has not published a package before since it presents a forked decision disguised as a unique instruction.. Agreed on refining after the fact!. That's still a huge improvement on readability I'll make a PR and test it locally.. does the prebuild step need to exist? it looks like it's primary purpose is to keep the lib/ directory around, which none of the other packages need. Either I need to change npm run clean to rimraf lib/* or make build:clean depart from the system used elsewhere (otherwise npm run prebuild just creates a directory if it didn't exist and then deletes it).. So then it should be good to go now (since now it just runs npm run build:clean like almost everything else).. Or if there's other cleanup you'd like me to do I can do that more broadly \u2014 I just don't know what is and isn't vital.. I don't think you need to have --scope repeated each time. . Did you make an issue describing more about this?. Ah, I didn't know the role of * ( the existential type) thank you for pointing that out. I put the link here for future reference of anyone stumbling across this note.. As in, we get a feature \"for free\" now? Or so do we need to do something more?. why are these exported as consts and not as types?. Are you saying I should create a new language_info field inside the kernel object created in activeKernelsByName?. I don't really understand what it would mean to \"make sense\" or \"not make sense\" in this case\u2026 I'm also not sure if you were saying to do this in lieu of adding a top level ui field (which I only am guessing based on https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/2250#issuecomment-354018740) or in addition to it. I think I'm going to put this down for the day and I'll come back to it later as I'm not making much progress.. I think I follow but I'm not sure if/how this is supposed to affect how I've written this.. Sounds good!. I specifically was leaving the action to set up the highlighted language because we might want that in the ui without actually changing anything about the kernel (). It's a simpler API for doing that kind of setting. Maybe that's not a useful feature (& I don't have a ui element for it yet), but I feel like I had a desire for that feature on a couple occasions. \nNB: I was also considering a separate epic to handle the setting as a consequence of setting the language info, but that seemed like a bit too much in that direction.   . I\u2019ll get to this in a bit; need to run a few errands and then it\u2019s first on the queue. I agree about having a single source of truth, I just want that truth to be overwritable without needing to change the kernel. I guess I'm thinking of the highlighting mode as something with a default determined by the kernel but with that default being potentially overwritten. I'll give this yet another refactor with this in mind to treat the mode as the single source of truth for the play component.. Why is MarkdownCell in markdown-preview (as opposed to markdown-cell)? . Much more reasonable! W00t!. shouldn't this be @nteract/core/providers?. Shouldn't this be @nteract/core/providers?. Why don't we need cells in the notebook tests any longer?. \ud83d\ude04 \ud83d\udc4d . Oh nope\u2026 actually it shouldn't be!. Actually\u2026 I think this needs to be split between those components that are in @nteract/core/providers and @nteract/core/components\n. I'd have imagined that this would require heavier logic and so would be inside @nteract/core/providers. lovely!. oh\u2026 i'm really confused now\u2026 above Notebook is a provider not a component\u2026. sweet! well done!. I'm actually with you on separating this, previewing markdown is it's own concept with its own (display) decisions & it's not a silly abstraction. \nWhat is handling the keyboard shortcuts that move focus between different cells? Is that separate from \"selecting\" multiple cells? How does it currently handle multi-cell selection (&c.). I don't think this split needs to occur yet\u2026 but if it doesn't occur I don't think this process of separating the providers from components is done. There's a lot of key handling logic in here when what matters is displaying the render from a view only perspective (in analogy with what you have above).. Could we use <style jsx-global> to avoid needing to use dangerouslySetInnerHtml?. Can\u2019t we return an array of elements with react 16? Unless there\u2019s a css rule expecting this\u2026 what do we gain from a blank wrapper div?. Same comment as above re: style jsx. Why did you add this here if you aren\u2019t also adding that action? . Why do we call it filename if it\u2019s actually a path? Technically aren\u2019t all filenames implicit (relative) paths while not all paths are filenames?  Wouldn\u2019t filepath be the more appropriate name? This might make more sense in a later PR but is definitely worth considering.. Also should this default to the root directory or is / here only being treated as a relative directory since it\u2019s to be treated as a relative path and not an absolute path?. Not a problem, just I\u2019m curious; does throwing an error inside tap propagate the error up and halt execution of the subsequent code inside the pipe? If so is the the common way to throw errors when using lettable operators?  . W00t!. Oh nvm, comma.. Is it possible to add a comma here for cleaner future diffs? Or is this a prettier opinion?. Is this equivalent to https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/2499/files#diff-44b50e8eee5aee1583efa30b48d59d94R221  because it uses toMatchObject vs. toEqual? I think I need to learn more about jest tests and their primitives, because that seems\u2026 strange since now they're literally the same string.. From the jest docs: \n\nUse .toMatchObject to check that a JavaScript object matches a subset of the properties of an object. It will match received objects with properties that are not in the expected object.\nUse .toEqual when you want to check that two objects have the same value. This matcher recursively checks the equality of all fields, rather than checking for object identity\u2014this is also known as \"deep equal\". For example, toEqual and toBe behave differently in this test suite, so all the tests pass:\n\nSo I think this test is redundant with the test below, which is stricter.. Why does this need to set the inlineMathDouble class? Do we really want to have different meanings for math blocks depending on whether they're surrounded by text?. Note \nhttps://github.com/Rokt33r/remark-math#inlinemathdouble-experimental-use-with-caution\nThey use the inlineMathDouble class to keep the same paragraph but to display it as though it were a different paragraph. Notice the spacing for the two cases is different:\n\nIn that case (from their docs), it doesn't look too bad because the text doesn't continue, but if you were to extend the text out it would be too close to the math. \nAlso, such a convention is a deviation from classic LaTeX and (I think) MathJax, and unless people feel strongly about it I'd prefer it to treat both $$\u2026$$ blocks in the same way. From this perspective, displayed math shouldn't be in the same paragraph.\nOtherwise we're right back to these actually producing different results (though they'd be more similar now than they were before):\n$$\u2026$$\n$$\u2026\n$$\n$$\n\u2026$$\n$$\n\u2026\n$$\n. oh yea\u2026not sure why i did that.. Fair enough on asset_url \u2014 will fix.. Well\u2026 I fear people who are new to this stuff might not know what \"Operators\" means.. how's this ### Configuration for deploying nteract_on_jupyter? Force pushing that change (with the others) in a sec.. could we unindent this line to what it was before?. the right part of the dropdown menu almost perfectly aligns with the cell's right boundary:\n\nIf you want i could add some more padding to see if I can get it more precisely correct.. So this is the default configuration from notebook: \nhttps://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/b663bf1b14734d68518e8cdcb1d993d034ede0f9/notebook/base/handlers.py#L245-L247\n@property\n    def mathjax_config(self):\n        return self.settings.get('mathjax_config', 'TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML-full,Safe'). Jupyterlab is more complicated since they also allow swapping out mathjax entirely with KaTeX https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers/tree/master/packages/katex-extension. self.config isn't the same object once we're inside the object iself. Also, we're currently using the initialize hook rather than overwriting the __init__ (which I think is actually the more idiomatic way to do it in tornado). \nSo what you're suggesting is that we don't actually do any validation in the nteract_on_jupyter extension, but that we only check to see if the serverextension is enabled? \n\nThis does mean we'd want the bookstore module to be in charge of its own validation.\n\nI was thinking that it would be in charge of defining it's own validation but allow others to actually perform some of the validation. My thinking was that, if it is going to have  \"bookstore-aware\" clients that are going to alter their UI on the basis of its functionality being available, it should provide a way for those clients to validate that the functionality is actually available in a manner that it defines. Adding the check that you're describing above seems like a great idea but I think it should supplement whatever we're providing in terms of bookstore self validation tooling.. from talking with @stormpython we realized we should only surface this if it's validated and that bookstore's different pieces of functionality will require different validation\naccordingly, this should become an object and not just a boolean.. proposed new name \"bookstoreValidated\".

But in this case, all other environment variables are loaded fine! I think the root of the problem is that for some reason, the env shell command (which shell-env relies on) doesn't include LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.

You guys should use conda ;). so npm run dist creates a debian file and I can install that?\nIs there a way to do development \"in place\"?. ok cool :) I think I'm all set for now.. What does Jupyter Notebook use? I think aiming at being as compatible as reasonably possible would be good. This renders fine in Jupyter.. I know in the backend jupyter uses pandoc but not for browser stuff, right?. somewhat off-topic: I would like my notebooks to have a layout language that allows me to refer to the input or output of a cell and to sections in the text. I want a cell to be able to say \"see In[10]\" in a dynamic way, or refer to sections. Markdown doesn't allow that and I think GFM doesn't allow that either.\nIt's a pretty big limitation imho :-/\n[Oh and I don't want to hack this with html because I want my latex conversions to also work and not just drop it]. Ok. My point is mostly: I like for stuff to look the same in nteract as it does in Jupyter Notebooks. I'm not sure what the timeline is for the GFM implementation in JavaScript but I think it would be good to prioritize this to make transition from Jupyter Notebooks as easy as possible.. I had not noticed the behavior in Jupyter Notebooks (possibly because mathjax gives up on my notebook), but you are right, the behavior is the same. Sorry for the noise.. Generally nteract seems to be quicker in rendering my notebooks than Jupyter Notebook is btw. At least that's my gut feeling, no data involved ;). Last question (for now): Showing how little I know about this world, what's the framework called that you're using that lets you create native apps with JavaScript? Or maybe rather: what's the gui part?. @ajasja you're right, thanks for pointing that out.. that was my guess ;). ",
    "ProgramFan": "How about integrating commonmark-table-extension https://github.com/webuni/commonmark-table-extension? . Sorry to have made the mistake. For pure JS implementation, Remarkable looks promissing. It support full GFM. Tables are handled. It also brings syntax highlighting for code blocks.. Unfortunately not any more \ud83d\ude03 @jdetle. I work full time as an associate professor and jupyter helps me a lot with my research, and I find nteract such a lovely tool. I like the proposal but just have not yet found the time. Maybe I can persuade some one to try it. . Of course.. Any where to start? I am new to the JS world but I would like to look into the issue if it is straight forward enough.. It seems straight forward. I dig in and find that the MarkdownRenderer is a component to transform the outout of markdown parser to a collection of React elements. I search the internet and found no such component. The existing component outputing React elements from markdown-it parser bundle markdown-it and leaves no option to configure plugins. So is it possible to use the html result of markdown-it directly in the cell?. OK. I find the https://github.com/sunflowerdeath/react-markdown-it code easy to understand. I can reuse the code and build a render myself in markdown-cell.js directly. I will try this when I setup the dev environment on my MBP. \ud83d\ude04 . Hi, I setup the dev env on my MBP and tried to integrate markdown-it. I have problem with the React part.\nI created a markdown-it render md and replaced the mdRender with md.render(input) . The markdown cell outputs raw texts of the generated html. It is not what I want but GFM tables are already correctly parsed. But when I implement something like in  https://github.com/sunflowerdeath/react-markdown-it , the whole cell would gone if I change the type to markdown.\nI guess I get the React part wrong, but find no way out. Would someone give me some pointers on how to correctly implement the component nteract want?. Thanks @aaronraff. I improved my approach but the error is still strange:\nThe only change I made to markdown-cell.js is to replace the code mentioned by rgbkrk with:\njs\nconst parser = new MarkdownIt();\nconst renderer = new HTMLtoJSX();\nconst mdRender: MDRender = input => renderer.convert(parser.render(input));\nAnd the rendered cells is:\nReact.createClass({ render: function() { return ( <div> <h1>This is header</h1> <p>This is content</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>TBL</th> <th>TBL</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>CONT</td> <td>CONT</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> ); } });\nfor \n```\nThis is header\nThis is content\n| TBL | TBL |\n|----|----|\n|CONT|CONT|\n```\nWhy??. So it seems we can implement a react renderer like https://github.com/rexxars/commonmark-react-renderer/blob/master/src/commonmark-react-renderer.js with the tokens.\nThe  https://github.com/ccorcos/markdown-it-renderer approach is also interesting. We just filter out unwanted tags by not defining its mapping.\nI will try them.. Table is just not parsed in markdown-it-renderer. And it just goes too complecated by first transforming markdown to html, then html to ast, then ast to components. Now the best option is to build our own markdown-it-react-renderer. It will take some time, though.. BTW, I think this topic is not new-contributer-friendly any more. \ud83d\ude22 . I can contribute to this issue, the downside is that I need to learn and experiment so it takes longer time than someone experienced.. I failed to allocate time for the task. Sorry.. ",

This is a great spec . \n\nIn regards to versioning and publishing.  What would you think about leveraging git and gist for versioning ?. That's a very good point. Certainly keeping the backends modular is the way to go. \nWith that said maybe the first iteration can be simple with the structure you proposed above, then potentially give the option to leverage git. \nI was more so thinking of a way that we can leverage the existing publish to gist option, but somehow also tie that in to what get's pulled into commuter. \nSuch as if the user published version 12 , if we could get to the correct notebook, and pass a param of ?version=12 or maybe it would know to pull the contents from gist. and display by leveraging the gist api. \nhttps://science.ryanwatts.me/view/commuter/testing/demo.ipynb?version=15\nThat may be too much at one level though.. Maybe even add a top level dropdown once you are in the view of a notebook, and the notebook's metadata has an endpoint to a gist. then you could select a different version or commit hash. . ",

I wasnt able to build the deb file on ubuntu, but figured it was something I needed on my system. (I can get dev mode to work fine). This is a good tip, maybe we should remember it for the dev docs. I wondered if <Plain /> should just be available by default. Or maybe an indication that the kernel did not output any mime-types that the client can support?\nOr is null the way to go?. \nSome ideas not necessarily for this PR: \nI think we could reword to be slightly more beginner friendly, example:\n\nJupyter frontends generally pick the \"richest\" output type they support, while ignoring any output types they do not.\n\nIf the audience is jupyter front end app developers, we could speak to them like:\n\nYour frontend should pick the \"richest\" output type it can support, while ignoring any other output types.\n. Calling this ExecuteResultOutput is an improvement. I'm thinking we might be able to make this more intuitive if we change the name of this type somehow: type ExecuteResultType = \"execute_result\";\n\nIt seems confusing to me that the ExecuteResultOutput type contains a type called ExecuteResultType, what do you all think? Bringing it up here since it will be easier to change sooner than later after releasing. Comment applies to the similar types as well.\nI was trying to look at the flow types with redux docs for inspiration, since actions are similar in a way with the string constant action types.. Somewhat similar to one of @rbgkrk's points, I think there is a way to wrap this whole function in one produce function, so you would be referring to and modifying draftOutputs the whole time.\nIf I'm not making sense I might have to code this out when I get home.\n. I sent a PR to you last night removing all the boiler from tests that was to accommodate Immutable.js. figured it would be easier than explaining in the comments.. Assuming the outputs object here is frozen/immutable, the outputs object wont be changed... right? It works with produce, but what if not used with produce?. Here is what I would call another \"quirk\" of immer. When you try to mutate outside of produce, it will either just not mutate (like a regular frozen object) or it might throw like here.. Interesting test here, I didnt know you could test that something throws!. I wasn't familiar with this pattern, is this preferable to writing as a class? It might transpile the same anyway, but I was just curious.. Along the lines of other todos, I'm thinking we should change to <OutputSwitch /> sooner rather than later. Or are we sticking to <Output />?. Were you meaning to go:\njsx\n <Output output={outputNoTraceback}>\nOtherwise outputNoTraceback is just hanging out there :smiley: . We use something like this  className in hydrogen today, but I think we could drop this class here in the stock error component. \nI have a long standing todo to create a custom error component for hydrogen, and this new api is going to make that happen I think! See this issue if you want to find out how long I have had this on my mind :calendar:  . I was all excited to see what you would do with immer!. Enter the same name twice then try to delete one, both would be removed. Just an observation, not going to come up much.. I noticed the add author button disappears if you haven't entered any authors yet. You could fix this to work like the tags do if you shift the logic around a little:\njsx\n<p>\n              {headerData.authors.length <= 0 ? null : \"By \"}\n              {headerData.authors.map(t => (\n                <Tag..... We could conditionally render this tooltip and add button so it doesnt show when edit is disabled.. Checking out the blueprint docs, you can just add: disabled={!editable} to both the tooltip and the button component props. . Thanks for all these key prop fixes as well!. Yep, that's what I meant to do! I'll fix that. One thing we've been changing vs the transforms is using mediaType instead of MIMETYPE so that these components work with the RichMedia component.\nstatic defaultProps = {\n    mediaType: \"image/svg+xml\",\n    data: \"\"\n  };. If you guys want I will change this back to a class with shouldComponentUpdate, but I thought I'd try this.. I amended and force pushed to fix the eslint error. The only change was moving the type import above the IconButton import and adding an empty line between them.. Wow, I did this quickly last night without realizing that point about the window count. This is pretty confusing.. Is there a reason we need grid to always be the default initial view? I wondered in the past if the view should just be a prop with \"grid\" being default. Updating after mounting will essentially do the same thing, but I'm wondering if I understand why grid has to be the initial view in the constructor.. I really like having these types declared up here personally.. onMetaDataChange?: ({ dx: dxMetaProps }) => void, right?. Why not use unknownOutput here?. undefined | undefined;. In my mind strings are immutable, so I'm just wondering if this does anything I might be completely unaware of?. Good advice. I love the unusual combinations of English words like this that make perfect sense programming :rofl: . I wanted to check my understanding of Object vs object. \nFrom the official docs, object, used here, refers to \"any thing that is not number, string, boolean, symbol, null, or undefined.\"\nSo metadata here could be an array, etc. . :fire: . :sunglasses: :sparkles: . ts\nlet classNames: string = \"\";. If you do \nts\nansiToJSON(children, !!useClasses).map(...\nthe !! will coerce useClasses to a bool instead of undefined to make typescript happy.. DataProps is describing the data from the kernel which looks like this:\n{\n  \"schema\": {\n    \"fields\": [\n      { \"name\": \"index\", \"type\": \"integer\" },\n      { \"name\": \"sepal_length\", \"type\": \"number\" },\n      { \"name\": \"sepal_width\", \"type\": \"number\" },\n      { \"name\": \"petal_length\", \"type\": \"number\" },\n      { \"name\": \"petal_width\", \"type\": \"number\" },\n      { \"name\": \"species\", \"type\": \"string\" }\n    ],\n    \"primaryKey\": [\"index\"],\n    \"pandas_version\": \"0.20.0\"\n  },\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"index\": 0,\n      \"sepal_length\": 5.1,\n      \"sepal_width\": 3.5,\n      \"petal_length\": 1.4,\n      \"petal_width\": 0.2,\n      \"species\": \"setosa\"\n    },.... The Display component will eventually be an error boundary and handle the different view components as children, but that would be in another PR.\nAlso, I'm thinking about calling this <Viz /> or something other than Display, since we've already had a Display component in the nteract ecosystem. What do you think?. I was stuck for a while tonight because I couldn't get jext to render a data-explorer, but it was due to this line. I got deep into the jext code in the process though, so I learned some things in the process.. ",

I close the issue, thanks very much for your help. But I'd like to open another issue: Add portable version of nteract as Atom did, is it doable?. Hi, I'm commenting on this issue because I made a gatsby plugin to parse Jupyter notebooks. When using the nteract Notebook-preview component for viewing file some maths equations are not rendered correctly.\nHere's the link to this preview: https://gatsby-contrib.github.io/gatsby-transformer-ipynb/Three-Body%20Problem/\nAnd here is the original notebook in GitHub: https://github.com/pjpmarques/Julia-Modeling-the-World/blob/master/Three-Body%20Problem.ipynb\nAny thoughts on the cause of this?. Ok I'll try the PR code and give feedback here.. The markdown package proposed by @tlyon3 gives the same result:\n\n. The notebook is on github: https://github.com/pjpmarques/Julia-Modeling-the-World/blob/master/Three-Body%20Problem.ipynb. Also I would like to render the notebook-preview component on the server with ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup(element), but it results in an empty string because it has some code that use document in the mathjax package. I'd like to provide a way to use katex instead of mathjax  if run on server. Should I modify the mathjax package or create a new package?. @rgbkrk, thanks for your answer. I'm pretty new to lerna, and it's not esay for me to hack on the nteract monorepo. I'm going to try to create a @nteract/notebook-render package that allow rendering notebooks in the server-side. I think i'm gonna handle maths directly on that package, and you'll see if it's possible to include it in the mathjax package.. This code may be considered malformed, you could use this pandoc rule from Extension: tex_math_dollars to parse rigorously maths:\n\nAnything between two $ characters will be treated as TeX math. The opening $ must have a non-space character immediately to its right, while the closing $ must have a non-space character immediately to its left, and must not be followed immediately by a digit. Thus, $20,000 and $30,000 won\u2019t parse as maths. If for some reason you need to enclose text in literal $ characters, backslash-escape them and they won\u2019t be treated as maths delimiters.\n\nOr if we consider mathjax is right as it parses this code correctly implement a parser like tex2jax.js used in mathjax.. @rgbkrk @lgeiger I'm trying to implement a simple test for this package based on the test you wrote for NotebookPreview.\nHowever I have a problem with the cell IDs that change on every test run. it seems that the uuid mock should fix this but it isn't the case. Can you give me some advices to fix this.. @rgbkrk I'm working in a page on showcase to test the katex rendering, and then I'll remove the WIP for a review.. @rgbkrk  I added the page to showcase and a simple server-side test, so I removed the WIP.. @rgbkrk I've prepared a preview of Notebookrender and Notebookrender side by side at https://gatsby-contrib.github.io/gatsby-transformer-ipynb/Three-Body%20Problem/.. @rgbkrk thanks for the invitations, I'm happy to join the nteract org. I'll submit the gatsby-transformer soon. Maybe we could  move the showcase from next to gatsby.. @rgbkrk I've moved the gatsby-plugin here, as you proposed it on #2947. I also updated the example site at https://github.com/gatsby-contrib/gatsby-transformer-ipynb/tree/move-to-nteract-monorepo.\nI'd like to publish it to npm, but I don't know if it is possible to publish packages in the monorepo separately.. @rgbkrk I added you to reviewers but maybe I could merge it alone and you'll review on next publish later.. Nice work :zap:. You're welcome, in fact you already done the hard job with all the packages provided with nteract.\nI'd like to use this component inside the gatsby-transformer-plugin, but it could be more generally used as an alternative to the notebook.js lib used to convert notebooks to HTML. . I already updated the snapshot, and every time I run the test cell IDs are changed randomly. I also checked that the uuid mock was never called.

That or maybe instead of scrollbars we show something to indicate there would be more content if it was expanded.\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/836375/30445660-9536a4a4-993b-11e7-8a3b-829f3ab0221e.png\n/cc @HenrikEckermann https://github.com/henrikeckermann\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/1893, or mute the thread https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AVqGVr5W4nwfWGeRnkSN1rake8TIGWp3ks5siWlmgaJpZM4PX9dx.\n\n\n. Yes I know. I meant I hope you generally keep going developing nteract because I like the idea and outlook.\nI will keep an eye on it. I also try to use it. If I cannot do something with it, I guess I can just save the notebook and try in Jupyter instead.\n\nAm 14.09.2017 um 20:55 schrieb Kyle Kelley notifications@github.com:\nWe won't have these fixed in time for your current homework submissions.

It worked in that it was fast... but then I (temporarily) gave up and disabled all that code, since it was too much work re-implementing everything myself given my goals/needs. The problem is that codemirrors static html export is missing much of the functionality of codemirror, and the author doesn't want to implement it, so you end up having to reimplement a lot (e.g., line numbers). \n\n@williamstein tends to be open to relicensing portions of code for reuse.\n\nI am very open.

This is replacing the commonmark-react-renderer with the react-markdown package.\n\nAre there any known quirks about react-markdown that we should look out for?\n\nI haven't run into any quirks in my usage of it.\n\nCan you give a rough idea of how it avoids the problems with MathJax?\n\nIf it finds a block of MathJax, then it won't escape single characters (\\,, \\;, etc) This issue doesn't come up with other MathJax that aren't single characters (eg: \\thinspace) which is why the issue was a bit obscure.\n. @mpacer yeah it does. I updated the test cases to make sure that $$ always returns a block math, but you might want to double check them. You can see the changes I made in the commit.

As you can see, it renders if it is wrapped inside a$$` block. \nAs far as expectations in classic jupyter, they render the exact same way:\n\nWe could modify the parser to find LaTeX environments, then wrap the environment block in $$ before it gets to the math renderer. Then it should take care of itself from there.. @benjaminabel would you mind sending me the notebook you used? Or at least a notebook with those specific cells in it?. I've tested this with my PR for environment rendering. Looking at the notebook source, the PR shouldn't affect the rendering of this notebook because 1) That block isn't in an environment and 2) it's already wrapped in a $$ block. The PR only comes into play with environments that are not in a $$ block.\nIt seems to be chopping off the left hand side of the equals sign. I'm looking into it a bit more to see what the problem is.\nBecause the math isn't inside an environment, I believe this is a different issue. . I've opened a new issue for this problem: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/2924. Correct. This helps bring it closer to how Jupyter functions. @rgbkrk I went ahead and put in a case if the parser can't find a matching end tag for the environment and it will return an error. The markdown component will then just fall back to the original, unmodified text and a console error will be logged.. I believe so. I didn't have to use that custom MarkdownRenderer. Just imported the package and used it. Looking through its source code, I couldn't find a reference to the remark-math plugin. The \"check set inline double\" test was one of the original tests that the remark guys made.\nI did read another thing in their docs as to why they treat $$..$$ and $$\\n$$ differently but it didn't seem like many people were happy with it. I also feel that they shouldn't differ, because they don't normally.. ",

Unsure.\nI do not know what to make of the nextjs example in https://github.com/superRaytin/react-monaco-editor/tree/master/examples/nextjs. The component wrapper sets things in the window object and hardcodes a baseUrl, which make me queasy.. Last week has seen movement in the monaco packaging space, apparently!\nhttps://github.com/superRaytin/react-monaco-editor/issues/108 has more info\nand links, and is possibly the 'right' way to go long term?\nOn Tue, Apr 3, 2018 at 6:20 AM, Kyle Kelley notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\nIt looks like the wrapper component shipping non-transpiled JS in that\npackage. We only build / transpile our own packages so to make this work\nwe'd have to either make our webpack config / babel loader transpile that\npackage or fork the component (or write our own).\nIt looks like there's another option too. In the example they provide,\nthey explicitly override fs to empty to make their package build.

I made up the title  for the page and the kernel selector. Happy to use whatever y'all want!. Thanks, @rgbkrk!\nI want to use play for the Berkeley Data8x course starting mid-May. I'll keep contributing fixes on/off.. The traitlet code looks good to me. However, I always feel extremely uncomfortable when Google Analytics code insertion is a core part of an open source project, rather than an extension. Here it also seems to be enabled by default, which makes me doubly uncomfortable. However, I'm only peripherally involved so my discomfort should not guide your decisions :). LGTM and GA is not on by default!. Yep, we can close this!. we don't have 2 jupyter extensions anymore :D . I've fixed all the flow errors I could, the last one eludes me.. Cell Updates are performed in the codeMirrorEditor component, while file content updates are performed elsewhere. I think the right thing to do is to move the current onChange and onFocusChange events in CodeMirrorEditor out of there to wherever notebook code is? But that doesn't need to be in this PR.... I think a better autosave would be something like 'after X keystrokes', and provide some indicators of saving being performed. Going to avoid buttons for now.. I think the TODO left for me is to move saving to a button.. I see SAVE events every 7s. I also see UPDATE_FILE_TEXT everytime I type. However, the contents don't actually seem to get saved.. With the last commit, I'm trying to use https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaco-editor-webpack-plugin. It sortof works, failing when it's trying to load 14.bundle.js from /nteract/edit/14.bundle.js rather than /nteract/static/lib/14.bundle.js even though output.publicPath is set.. It turns out my changes to webpack.config.js were never sortof taking effect. There was a error hidden in the mass of output that is produced by the dev command:\nnteract-on-jupyter: ERROR in /home/yuvipanda/code/nteract/node_modules/monaco-editor/esm/vs/language/typescript/lib/typescriptServices.js\nnteract-on-jupyter: Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'fs' in '/home/yuvipanda/code/nteract/node_modules/monaco-editor/esm/vs/language/typescript/lib'\n. The last commit fixed the webpack parts of this, woohoo!. I now need to clean up the code and fix all the flow errors I'm sure are there now. . @rgbkrk I've fixed all the flow errors I know how to fix! Unsure where the remaining one is coming from - I suspect the \"monaco-editor\" import is injected by the webpack extension?. The only missing TODO left here is the path problems, right?. @rgbkrk I think with your patches this is ready to merge. I'll open another issue to get this to work with different base URLs.. I filed https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/2819. Once #2846 lands, this should also update the  tag when the page title is changed. Perhaps change the URL too?. Yeah, I found it wasn't working either :) This got committed as an accident of git commit -p iwith the pre-commit hooks. Monaco already says this, but I'd like to change this text to point to:\n\nShortcut for summoning command palette\n\nShortcut for changing tab behavior. I'm unsure how exactly to do this :). You can press 'Ctrl+M' to switch these modes. . I'm doing this now.\n\n\nSetup a Windows Test VM from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/. I'm using Windows 10.\n\nInstall NVDA screen reader - https://www.nvaccess.org/\nRun nteract on your local machine, but listening on 0.0.0.0\nAccess nteract from inside the Windows VM, and see how NVDA sees it!\n. There's a bug in the Windows 10 Edge VM that prevents sound from working. See https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=81135 for a fix.. NVDA doesn't seem as great, so I'm using JAWS instead now. Much more usable!. With JAWS things seem mostly ok! Only problem is that the accessibility help popup window doesn't actually get read by JAWS, which is awkward. . This works, I'm going to close this now. We should do this again when we have 'run' functionality.. I want it to be delayed - something like '5s after the last keystroke, unless there is another keystroke in the interim'. I know how to do this in normal JS, but here I am guessing I'll need to make an Epic?\n\nI guess it'll be simpler to just make a button for this PR :). Yes, it will!. :D Thank you! The Redux docs are pretty good.. :tada: . Is there any way to make this configurable?. @rgbkrk I needed this to get Monaco to load at all. Otherwise it was trying to load a style and failing to load anything at all.. What's the 'right' thing to do here long term?. @rgbkrk does that mean if you update codemirror you've to redo that?. @rgbkrk here's docs for it https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.itextmodel.html. I just tested this.\n\nYou do need publicPath to be set for monaco language features to work\nIt doesn't work when the file being edited is on some nested path :'(\n\nUnsure what's the right thing to do here.. And what do you recommend we do here? :). This LGTM from a a11y pov!. ",

    "rarkins": "Hi @rgbkrk, thanks for installing Renovate. Feel free to @ me here if you want to ask any questions or confirm your configuration settings.. @betatim https://renovateapp.com/docs/deep-dives/dependency-pinning. Yes. Renovate attempts to detect on a per package file basis and only treats as an app of main is missing or private is true . Well, it\u2019s mostly about build reproducibility, ie avoiding the \u201cso what changed between this build that failed and the one before that worked?\u201d \nAlso doing this way ensures that when security updates are released for node that everyone\u2019s cache is broken and they download the correct image rather than using a cached insecure one. \nBut of course it\u2019s optional. @rgbkrk ok, noted. FYI, Renovate waits until all \"pin\" PRs are merged before starting on update PRs, so you will need to merge this or disable Docker renovation. To disable docker, add \"docker:disabled\" to your \"extends\" array.. plenty more fish in the sea:\n\n. Actually you can just add this:\n\"ignoreDeps: [\"flow-bin\"]\nwith \"ignoreDeps\" being at the same level as \"extends\".. FYI, Renovate will rename the Pull Request titles you have open once you merge this, but it won't regenerate any commits. i.e. won't cause unnecessary duplicate testing on your CI.\nHowever be aware that Renovate automatically regenerates existing branches if there is any conflict, so as you start merging changes to package.json you can expect to see the occasional branch recreated by Renovate in order to automatically resolve those git conflicts.. @rgbkrk right now there's no native way to view all ignored updates in one place, other than using GitHub's search, e.g. https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+%22Renovate+Ignore+Notification%22+author%3Aapp%2Frenovate+.

There could be other problems but I'd look at that first.. @jdetle I see what you were doing to make up for my mistake but I think it ultimately was too ambitious. I corrected the issue by changing the setGrid to simply fire setState rather than get into updateChart (which calculates all the dataviz stuff) and it seems to work fine.. I changed the filtering a bit on the DF to make it show two regions so that it would be a more interesting data visualization experience. But it's still smaller than the whole DF.. Will do. I need to think through how it relates to Semiotic and my own assumptions about what's being passed in and out. Which is great.. It can be made better but the current version includes an implementation of PC.. Sorry I never saw this. I'll take a look now.. Should be fixed with #3108 . Working on it in this branch: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/improve-data-explorer-colors. Look at this beauty: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/3116\n\nStill missing:\n Better UI components\n Some built-in options for different industry-standard palettes (colorbrewer, tableau)\n* Saved settings (along with other DE saved settings). Going to close this and leave the missing pieces for future separate issues.. In this branch: https://github.com/nteract/nteract/tree/de-help-text\nAdded some basic friendly chart definitions and added them as title style tooltips to the buttons:\n\n. This would be better if it was a more involved tooltip which should have:\nTitle\nFriendly Explanation\na sparkline version of the chart you're going to see if you click there?. Some simple explanations for the selectors.\n\n. Gonna turn this into a PR and leave the suggestions for later as well as upgrading the tooltips.. Should be resolved in #3106. #3109 . Should resolve https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/3095. Almost forgot to post an image.\n\n. Could you post a screenshot. Looking at the bar chart I see the same order in the legend. Is it that the legend is a multiline HTML legend? If so, what's a better way to show the legend or signal the order?\n\n\n. Or it could be that since I'm running it locally it's something that got implemented in a more recent version that isn't released.... may or must have one active kernal?. That's a good point they could all be called Icon couldn't they.. That makes sense. Will do in future.. \"Previous\" an \"Current\" in the reducer, in the logic of the reducer function I'm just trying to reduce the data to unique values baed on the selected dimension for coloring (dim1) and using the spread syntax lets me do it in a single line, which looks cool but if it's not the best approach lmk.. As I understood it, we aren't going to allow duplicate tags/authors. So really I should also do a unique check when updating the list. But if we do want to allow duplicates then we need to change this. :/. Good catch!. So weird I thought I was suppressing these when editable was set to false.. Accessiblicious!. Updated docs and component to expect an array of { name: string }. No I should have left this in, I didn't notice that it was in the demo code. I was just trying to clean up all my console.logs and must have cut this one unintentionally.. Oh good catch how did that happen? I'll correct this in a separate PR.. I have 18 colors in the default color scheme. It's hard to get color differentiability for points and lines beyond 18 and by hard I mean really hard. Maybe in the future when we have more palette functionality, I'll make this dynamic.. There's no good research on parallel coordinates styling, so I made a judgement call that we'd want to really scale back the appearance of points when they're not in the filter bands. Once we see people using this mode more, we might end up with a more user-driven approach but until then this is a good place to start. There's not a uniform opacity value that would be applied across lines and points, so I don't see much to pull out into a constant, but we might allow users to style things dynamically later on if we implement a more exploratory data explorer. I wouldn't want to invest too much into that right now, because I want to see if people are actually going to use it.. Oh I like the whole prop with grid as default, I'll add that.. Yeah, I'm still getting used to the whole \"More than me needs to understand this stuff\". The \"arc\" and \"matrix\" support is coming soon BTW but it's not in there yet.. Oh good point. Excellent!. Oh whoops!. That worked. The reason I was passing mimeType through was because I didn't think to pass the metadata through to the output and mimetype lets me do that cleaner setIn. How would I set the metadata of the output?. This is the right way to go once I figure out how to send it to the output rather than the metadata of the cell.. Weird, not sure how I missed this one.. Nope! Just left from some logging an issue and accidentally left it in.. Didn't realize, thanks!. It's used to know in the updateOutputMetadata in output.tsx function which output in the arrays of outputs to update.. No it's not that. It's that the map expected is a map of mediaTypes, when the map that's passed is just a toMap version of the metadata object that's sent back from Data Explorer. My assumption is that the corresponding entry in the map is supposed to be a plain js object, or if not is something that we should convert at this point.. Ugh you're right, good catch. I'm js-in-css-in-js-in-css-in-js-css always catches me like this.. I like that a lot. I probably won't get a chance to review this until tomorrow morning.. ",

On the other hand, that is not what packages currently do (mainly since they've just done what they needed to do in order for it to \"just work\" in jupyter.. I don't think the implications go that far back in the processing. For this specific case, simply changing _repr_latex_ to return '\\mathrm{Quantum~object: dims = [[2], [1]], shape = (2, 1), type = ket}\\\\begin{equation*}\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{*{11}c}1.0\\\\\\\\0.0\\\\\\\\\\\\end{array}\\\\right)\\\\end{equation*}' fixes it... in the sense that the text looks correct. It's still parsed by mathjax (which is fine).\n~~I think it's reasonable to expect things coming from _repr_latex_() to be stuffed into mathjax... and ask people to plan accordingly.~~\nNevermind, using \\mathrm{...} breaks nbconvert so isn't likely to be a workable solution.. I like the idea of a _repr_mathjax and _repr_latex since that respects the differences between the two systems. It seems easy enough to fallback on _repr_latex if there isn't a mathjax method (since that would likely do ok). A bigger issue may be why the behavior in nteract has diverged from jupyter notebook. Packages that define _repr_latex are likely to make sure they work in jupyter (and nbconvert). Seems like the safest bet is to replicate notebook behavior (or coordinate adoption of _repr_mathjax by both projects). @mpacer wrapping with $...$ adds literal $ around the output in nteract 0.7.1. I think this is because nteract is passing all of _repr_latex to mathjax in a math environment already. Essentially, that's why this issue started. It seems like earlier versions did not do that; in 0.6.2 the extra $'s do not appear, and nteract displays the resulted \\mathrm formatted strings.. ",

    "yozlet": "I'd also love this feature, especially because it's close to the Swift Playgrounds/\"Learnable Programming\" view. Is it doable by customising the CSS, or does it need more than that?\nTo start with: just having the row unconstrained in height would be great as is.\n(There would be open questions/possibilities about how tall a row should be: for me, I'd love to be able to limit the row to the height of one sub-cell (i.e. code or output) and constrain the other sub-cell to that height (by resizing a graph, or making it scrollable, or whatever). Anyway, this is all for later enhancement.)\nFor more horizontal layout options, check out Apache Zeppelin. I don't think it currently lets you put code and output side by side, but it does have some nice features for laying out multiple cells horizontally and constraining row/cell height.. Possibly related: Sometimes that box is too big, and there doesn't seem to be a way to shrink it. (Having manual control over sizing would also be useful, but that's a different issue.)\n\n. Caveat: I'm a relative newbie, but wanted to do a little research towards helping this happen, so here's what I found in 10 mins:\nThe Jupyter kernel API used to have a user_variables entry in the execute request/response, and this was for fetching the list of user-created variables in the current execution stack.\nUnfortunately for us, 5.0 of the API (a couple of years ago) removed this, and replaced it with user_expressions. This is for holding and executing code in the kernel's own language that will fetch metadata to go alongside the execute output. It's intended for things like custom prompts.\nSo, the good news is that it's theoretically possible, and there's a place to put it in the protocol. The bad news is that it's language-specific. For each kernel, you'd need an expression in that language to serialise the complete set of user-created variables. But, hey, you'd only need to define that once per kernel, and you'd have some control over the serialisation, so that might make the front-end easier and more powerful.. @mmagnuski Thanks for that, I didn't know about that project. The code is super clean and readable. Here's what I can tell from a brief browse:\n\nIt's mostly TypeScript, and it uses JupyterLab's TypeScript APIs to hook into kernel communication\nOn initial activation, it sets up some custom functions in the kernel's userspace (currently only supporting a few Python kernels) to do inspection & serialization\n(I'm unsure about this bit.) Instead of sending user_expression riders along with each execute request, it sends its own execute request as followup.\n\n(This is a really ignorant question, but: Seeing that it's mostly JS underneath, and it's hooking into the increasingly-popular JS API for JupyterLab extensions... could that same API be exposed in nteract? I realise the UI model's mostly different, but maybe the underpinnings are similar enough. I'm saying this with no idea of what nteract's current API is, or what plans for extension support are, so feel free to ignore.). ",

If not, it is not a big deal but it means no internet connection, no pyecharts in nteract: imagine you sit with your big data science project on infamous UK trains, where wifi/4G is laughable.\n2) Continue with no answer, what are the native(javascript) way of contributing extensions to nteract.\n. javascript assets of pyecharts can be included without require.js. It is jupyter notebook which uses requirejs hence we altered our implementation to suit jupyter notebook. We are NOT married with requirejs.\nI am interested in the way to place files in /static folder. To serve nteract desktop app user, how can I or your user get our files there? When nteract becomes jupyter extension,  does it mean that pyecharts packages can be installed to jupyter echarts in conventional way? And to display it, we in pyecharts team can remove requirejs in rendered result. \nIs there any flag to show that the script is ran in nteract environment?

What about nteract?\nHere are all js files(around 3,000 files) ever used in pyecharts:\nhttps://github.com/pyecharts/assets\nYes, we do not force our user to take all files in one go.

    "jameskoch": "Fixed. I rewrote my commit. Let me know if you all prefer a chain of commits for revisions like this. I've been away from github for a few years as well, so have fallen out of touch w/ the workflow.. Yeah.  I originally tried to address this by combining this epic w/ a dummyKernelStartingEpic that would receive the launchKernelByName(new_UUID) and respond w/ a launchSuccessful(new_UUID), but couldn't get the two epics to interact nicely, presumably because I'm working w/ pure Observables and not the full redux stack. My first time in this stack, so could be off base.... Something like constants feels better; will probably keep these bind calls, and the menu testing code, simpler and easier to grok than passing around higher-order action-building functions.\nTrying something along the lines of constants and not loving it:\n```\n// actionTypes:\nexport const RestartKernelOutputHandling = {\n  // Feels like some double-encoding going on here.\n  // Could just assign non-sense values like 1,2,3 but that also feels silly.\n  None: \"None\",\n  ClearAll: \"Clear All\",\n  RunAll: \"Run All\"\n};\n// And then to use these ...\n// ... either export a type w/ a different name ...\nexport type RestartKernelOutputHandlingType = Keys$;\n// ... or have downstream code just use Keys$ themselves. \n// Having to remember or consider using Keys$ vs. Values$ seems annoying.\n```\nSo none of these are feeling great to me. Notably the bind calls above are type-checked accurately by Flow, however the \"Clear All\" literal in notebook.js that John flagged does go unchecked. So keeping the literals would be somewhere between wildly unsafe and fully checked.\nI'm happy to change to whichever pattern you'd prefer.. I'm sort of bullying my way into the AppState here. Seems likely there are other ways to compose desktop/notebook-specific state/reducers atop the core ones. Shout any tips. Approach here caused some pain in Flow (see comment @ top of close-notebook.js).. You probably didn't intend to commit this. I haven't worked w/ yarn enough to know if there are easy ways to avoid this. I've just been catching it when manually reviewing my commits.. I imagine we'll want to add the new menu entries to the jupyter-extension as well, for consistency. Code here. I'm not seeing where, or if, that mode of operation includes many shortcut keys. @rgbkrk are most extension users you talk to just not leaning on shortcuts much?. Please keep the style nits coming; I've been out of the JS world for a few years and need the help.. Can someone confirm that the desktop app will only use ZMQ kernels? That's my read of the code, but want to make sure. If not, will need to figure out how to resolve name to type here in desktop.. This variant of launchKernelWhenNotebookSetEpic is NOT used in the desktop. Would we be okay w/ hard-coding it to use the remote/websocket kernel type for now? (Line above says \"zeromq\", ignore that, I'm proposing hard-coding it to websocket for now.) If we can't do this, will need an app-agnostic way to determine local-vs-remote here when opening a new notebook.. Or I can drop the kernelType from launchKernelByName, and force the two different epics we have for implementing that epic to do the dirty work.  Will play w/ that right now.... Accidental file addition here?. I might have renamed while in here because it's not obvious to me what this does w/o reading the impl. Or, I just don't get plumbing jokes.. The logic around quitting is really hard to follow, I've been trying to make it more sane, but haven't made great progress. I'm tempted to blame Electron.\nJudging by your change, would it be accurate to modify your commit msg to \"If user closes last window, window-all-closed is called, followed by before-quit which is then canceled because BrowserWindow.getAllWindows() thinks there are still open windows.\"? It seems like that might be the key diff between platforms here, and worth documenting a bit.\n. ",

I need to change that from any and create a type for it. Nope, you were right.. Not sure, let me check the history.. In the history before my commit, there was no margin set. That is, it was nonexistent.. I probably don't need all of these, so I will reduce this to just what is needed.. Is there a difference between using styled.div as a prefix to styled components and not using a prefix?. I was switching the input from a controlled to uncontrolled component. And I couldn't get the EditableText component to work as an uncontrolled input. So, I just used a standard HTML input element and used ref={input => this.inputRef = input} to grab hold of the value in the input DOM element, and the value is only stored when the input loses focus and therefore allows users to continue inputing characters without the component re-rendering until after the input has lost focus.. The blueprintjs classes were an attempt to get the input styled exactly the way that the editableText component get styled. This is obviously not the case, and I will need to add some other classes to the editableText component.. I replaced the input element with the EditableText element and used the defaultValue prop instead of the value prop to make the EditableText component an uncontrolled component.. \ud83d\ude06 . Should the type here be ContentRef and not string?. yeah, this happened with the last rebase. Let me correct this.. Which file is the IFileContent interface in? I am assuming the I stands for interface.. Are we going to go with the tslint setting prefer interface over type? Just read this blog post, which essentially says that in Typescript 3, there are very few differences between types and interfaces.. No, I don't think so. I will remove it.. Changing back to Component.. Will let @rgbkrk add a follow up PR for this change.. Removed with new commit.. Yes, I wasn't passing anything into the connect function because I hadn't completely setup the map...ToProps functions.. Not sure which type to put here, possibly () => void. Same goes for others like this one below.. Actually, I hadn't checked. Let me see.. This needs to be thought through more carefully as we may want to send more than just the contentRef to an action function.. Yes, it is. And when I specify the type that was given, it causes issues in the connect parameter types. I will troubleshoot further.. I think it does, but I need to import a bunch of stuff.. Good point.. Is this ok to do? I am not sure. The other option: I can require a kernelRef be passed to the <Notebook /> component.. The inner mapDispatchToProps function doesn't get state passed to it. It is the dispatch and ownProps that are passed.. It seems that state isn't passed into mapDispatchToProps at all. And, since I was setting the kernelRef as a prop from mapStateToProps, the initial value is undefined. And even after its updated, the mapDispatchToProps function still holds onto the initial value because the dispatch functions are not reattached unless ownProps, i.e. values passed into the component, changes. So, the kernelRef is never updated.. I am not so sure about this width being set here. What happens when users resize the window?. You are right. We should be storing a last published time. I'll write an issue an add it in a separate PR.. I'll remove this one.. I honestly don't remember. I was probably having an issue and tried many different things at once and forgot to revert back.. Absolutely, we can!. Ok, I am going to pull adding this functionality out of this Project, and open a issue to do it at another time.. Because a map is instantiated as a default if no state object is supplied, the type returned may not only be Map<string, HostRecord>.. Whoops, I figured out how to prevent the type warnings when making this more specific. Thanks @captainsafia!. ",
    "charlesjolley": "For TypeScript? tslint default rules strongly prefers the foo[] notation unless you're defining an interface. I can make it whatever you want though. . The mocks don't fully satisfy the JupyterMessage interface. We could add all the extra dummy properties to fully satisfy the interface, but is not needed and it would make the code a lot harder to follow, IMO.  Another option would be to relax the JupyterMessage interface but I assume that except for these units tests, we generally want to be strict so that we get the full benefits of typing.  I opted for a third route, which is to just coerce the types in this special testing case and leave the strict types in place for regular code.\nYou have to coerce the types to 'any' before TS will let you coerce into a more specific type. \n. Staring at the original code more, I realized that what this function actually expects is vargs of either strings or 1d tuple (i.e. array with a single string element).  I just pushed a change that makes that will enforce that. TS will complain if you try to call with empty arrays or arrays with > 1 string. . How about Array?. Is that what you had in mind?. Sure thing. While I'm at it, It appears that the only dependencies this package actually uses is the \"monaco-editor\" and \"lodash\" packages. want me to remove all of the others?\n\"@babel/runtime-corejs2\": \"^7.0.0\",\n\"@nteract/display-area\": \"^4.4.8\",\n\"@nteract/messaging\": \"^4.2.2\",\n\"@nteract/transforms\": \"^4.4.7\",\n\"babel-runtime\": \"^6.26.0\",\n\"monaco-editor-webpack-plugin\": \"^1.5.1\",\n\"rxjs\": \"^6.3.3\"\n\n. TypeScript was complaining because the value can sometimes be null. Right now we have TS set to a pretty strict mode so it requires you to deal with undefined and null cases independently (or at least acknowledge in the type as I do here).  \nWe could loosen that constraint a bit on the compiler if you want. I'd be for it.. +1. so you'd like me to drop the string generic type for signature_scheme and transport? Easy to do but just a note that the flow typings were open ended, so that would be tightening the API.. I'll try to make that work. At present TS doesn't seem to pick up types that I put in there. haha. that comment is left over from before. I'll take it out now that I added the enum. I tried that but it ends up causing some other issues because of how tsconfig projects work. In general with the projects activated, you can't have 'ambient' shared folders across all your TS.. I have an idea though on how to make this work. Will do. I figured that out eventually for the other pull requests.. I thought the purpose of monorepo was that you managed each dependency separately for the packages and lerna/yarn take care of collapsing the dependencies to a top-level node_modules?\nI'll follow whatever pattern you guys do, but it seems to me keeping shared dependencies doesn't get you any benefits but will make it harder for keep track of  which deps are still needed?. Changed.. Changes. yep TS has gotten more particular about this one over the years. Basically anywhere you use Object in flow, change to 'object'. OK. I can remove it.. that's not correct. because the package.json's all point to a main file at lib/index.js and types at lib/index.d.ts -- webpack will look for those files and ignores the typescript in src.\nPreviously this may have been partially obscured by having the paths property set in the base tsconfig.  However, using paths in this way conflicts with composite/build-mode [which requires you to specify all of your files and to keep them under the same root, which is src in each package]. \n. Because we are using packages in a monorepo, all of our tooling (webpack, vscode language support, babel) look for types and source in lib/ not src/.  this means that to even open the project in an IDE without the having it throw errors everywhere, you need to have at least an initial build of your source present. i.e. the first step after installing will always be a clean build anyway.\nI think it's worth hooking here so that developers don't immediately hit a speed bump when they first open the project.\n. See my note above. Our packages say to look for main and types in lib/ not src/ which means when you import via Webpack, it goes there.  Ditto when you're importing from another package via jest.\nFWIW - I think this is probably on balance the best behavior because it means that consuming a package local to the monorepo follows the exact same code path as if you installed the package from npm.\n. Thanks that's good to know. I missed that when I looked at the configuration. I'll go back and see if I can figure out why that wasn't working before.. why do we even have the tsc-build process then? It feels like a recipe for ongoing issues to have parallel build infrastructure.. OK. I did some investigating. There seems to be a confluence of things going here:\n1- I'm not sure why but it appears that if you have a lib directory in a package, then webpack will prefer to use that code instead of what it finds in src. Once you get into any compiled lib directory, you're in commonjs land using require everywhere and so then it expects all other packages to be compiled also.\n2- There isn't really a good way to do a build clean and even when I try to run the build:clean task in each project, it doesn't seem to consistently clean out the old lib directories in non-tsc-based packages.\nThus you end up in a situation where the webpack build is nondeterministic. If you've run a yarn build sometime recently, you can end up with old artifacts included in the build and unexpected errors.\nFurthermore, looking at the webpack config it feels like there are a number of overlapping methods in play here to try to resolve various paths in different ways. Further making it hard to reason about how to includes will happen.\nTo further complicate matters, vscode / tsserver doesn't see any of this custom webpack trickery which means that you must keep at least the built versions of your typescript packages up to date for intellisense to work across packages.  Which gets us back into the original problem of webpack getting confused if you have some packages built.\n\nI have a proposal on how to fix all of this. Maybe I should write an RFC as an issue and we can discuss it there?\n. I mean we have this entire setup to use the tsc build mode for packages.  (i.e. yarn build:packages:ts). PR's encouraged! ;). this script (and a few others I think) are wrong. Correct scripts are in the TypeScript Doc. I would omit the explicit type here, since assigning the createRef value will correctly set the type. createRef has a generic to set the element by the way:  container = React.createRef<HTMLDivElement>();. personal opinion, I would remove the type here altogether. I think this is unnecessarily expanding more strict typing you will get from React. I might be wrong though as I haven't tried it myself.. Why did you add the paths property back? I took it out because it was causing some conflicts with normal package resolution. Ideally we can find a way to avoid using paths since yarn workspaces already makes local packages available. Should be object (lowercase o). Should be string [] per our earlier discussion? (Simple srrays use bracket. Complex types get array<>). Can/should this be made more specific? You lose typing basically. ",
