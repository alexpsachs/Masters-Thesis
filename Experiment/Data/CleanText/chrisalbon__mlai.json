It immediately returns a dataframe.\npd.ExcelFile() is the constructor for an ExcelFile object, not a dataframe. This is how Chris is able to obtain the names of the sheets in the file (xls_file.sheet_names) and then load a specific one as a dataframe (xls_file.parse('Sheet1')). The sheet_names attribute seems to be the only thing you gain from using this interface, but it could be nice to have that intermediate step when processing a lot of workbooks automatically.
