    "perry-mitchell": "Yes.. We were using a project mgmt tool for github and it made a bit of a mess here. This task is still valid.\n. Perhaps refer to the clipboard notes on the electron repo.. I think this definitely should be enabled by default. Leaving stuff like that in clipboard is very dangerous. I think we could set a default time period to start with and perhaps add the possibility to adjust that later, imo.. Ok.. so it looks like we have something to go on then. Not sure if I love the 10s default (15 maybe?), but otherwise it doesn't matter (we can change it later of course). All we need is this and the UI for it #134 and it should be golden.. Not yet - only deb\n\nOn 24 Jan 2016, at 8:20 PM, Sallar Kaboli notifications@github.com wrote:\nIsn\u2019t this one done already @perry-mitchell?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. Yes, just need to decide how..\n. I think attributes will be more than enough.. but I'm not sure how the icon should be stored.\n\nIt comes down to the architecture of where the data is stored. If we don't store the image data inside the archive, then we have to store it in a repo which all Buttercup applications have access to (updating icons would be very hard).\nWe could just store the svg/base64 data in the archive as well.. that would make it more portable (but larger). This would also mean that if we update the icons later older archives won't get the updates.. We need to have a meeting on this.\n. But what if they use a newer version of the GUI than another component and the icon doesn't exist? I guess it could just show a question mark or something. \nThen we need to decide on the image format... Yeah, guess svg would be good. As long as it's an MIT license..\n. Ok, so latest update.. Using iconographer, this can be added quite easily. Storage for the icons should be on disk.. Oh yeah! That\u2019d be amazing!\nLet us know how it goes. You could also PR the iconographer repo if you discover issues. You\u2019ll need to setup file-based icon storage in the desktop app with regards to that \ud83d\ude0a. The auto updater looks shakey, so I suggest the following:\nStore a JSON file on the server with the current version and the URL to the installer. The file could look like this:\n{\n    \"version0\": {\n        \"version\": \"0.2.3\",\n        \"title\": \"Buttercup alpha 0.2.3\",\n        \"importance\": \"normal\",\n        \"readmore\": \"http://read.more/index.html\",\n        \"installers\": {\n            \"mac\": \"http://download.com/buttercup-0.2.3.dmg\",\n            \"win32\": \"http://download.com/buttercup-0.2.3-x86.exe\",\n            \"win64\": \"http://download.com/buttercup-0.2.3-x64.exe\",\n            \"linux32-deb\": \"http://download.com/buttercup-0.2.3-x86.deb\",\n            \"linux64-deb\": \"http://download.com/buttercup-0.2.3-x64.deb\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n. URL: http://buttercup.pw/update.json\nImportances: \"normal\", \"important\", \"critical\"\nreadmore: An optional property (may not be present) to provide a link to a notice (URL).\n. @snhasani Hmm.. that's interesting. I haven't actually installed the deb from the command-line yet, so I haven't seen any messages like that.\nAre you sure that's related to the \"bad quality\" of the package, and not just an error?\n. @cobbaroo1 @snhasani Are you installing by command line? I'm able to install fine in the ubuntu software manager, even though it alerts that it's a \"bad quality\" package.\n@cobbaroo1 Judging by your error.txt (thanks!), there's a myriad of problems, mostly permissions. I don't think we can solve all of them, which is a pain. Maybe someone knows a way around this?\n. Provided by @MHM5000 : https://gist.github.com/MHM5000/3b13bcd855061d5ccde13fc9892df1e5\n. Has this been addressed now? I'll probably re-test tomorrow.\n. Closing as no longer an issue on Ubuntu 16.04. If someone reproduces this again on the new build we can re-open.. Was not able to reproduce this.\n. Solved.\n. This is fixed now, right @sallar ?. Suggestions for implementation here are welcome - I have no experience doing this programmatically.\nPerhaps duti could work?\n. I can confirm this @naitian - The installed version doesn't respond to Cmd+A, whereas the development version does.\n. We currently have support in the core for this - But we need to add it in the interface. It's on the roadmap as an important feature.\n. #38 #39 #40 \n. @naitian I was thinking the latter, purely based on my own preferences. There may or may not be a time where the user has multiple archives, including if they store a \"shared\" archive for different purposes.\nWe could make a default path so that creating is quite simple, but I'd imagine that we wouldn't enforce it.\n. Well it's almost been a year @naitian \ud83d\ude05, but we're finally getting on to this. The \"Buttercup\" name is actually registered to me (at least in development). We should see support for this in Q1 hopefully, depending on how long DB approval takes.. Good point! This is definitely something we should include.\n. @emehran That's a good idea - Perhaps we should update this to be for a trash folder - what do you think? That way we could avoid using a confirmation dialog.\n. Ah.. Yes - The core uses a symlink to create a consistent pathing regime throughout the system - It's the only way to avoid global definitions of \"root paths\" and crazy breadcrumb directories like \"../../../../file.js\".\nSeems as though windows still doesn't like the symlink (\"__buttercup\") - that'll be why it's failing.\nEDIT: Obviously this'll be because our symlink creation is not cross-platform, while it actually should be. Let's see if we can make this work.\n. Related to the core: buttercup-pw/buttercup-core#32\n. Thanks!\n. Good point.. What do you think @sallar ?\nLet's create a sample record immediately and make it editable.. Perhaps for Beta.\n. This has been partially implemented with the addition of General and Trash (0.13.0 of core). Adding a sample entry in the general group should finish this off, but that may be a task for this repo rather than the core.\n. I believe this may already be done, right @sallar ?\n. Following up, you're right @sallar - specifically Cask is for GUI applications:\n\nHomebrew Cask extends Homebrew and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to OS X applications and large binaries alike.\n\nWould be amazing to get our next version published there!\n. Deprioritised.. Not the most important item right now.. This looks really good!\nIf you fix the merge conflict that's just arisen I'll merge it in. I will probably make the default-generated password a bit stronger (more characters and combinations) until we have a more custom approach.\n. @naitian I re-ran the single failed test - Travis is buggy imo. No reason for the failure. I'll merge this.\n. Thanks @mpourismaiel - That seems to be the case, we'll need to fix the search.\nThinking it might be wise to have it search the entire archive rather than just the current group.\n. Perhaps you could also share your node/npm/electron versions.\n. After checking a few other linux posts, most people seem to stop the GTK messages by installing the missing modules: sudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk-module. Obviously this is strange to have come up at all. I'm not sure these GTK errors even relate to your electron not starting.\nWhat distro are you on? Are you able to run any other electron apps? (eg. https://github.com/hokein/electron-sample-apps)\n. Hmm. That error will be in the buttercup-core project - __buttercup is actually a symlink that makes managing pathing much easier.\nCould you try going into the node_modules dir, into \"buttercup\", removing its node_modules directory and running npm install in there? Inside its node_modules, the symlink \"__buttercup\" should point upwards to its own source folder.\nYou should see something like:\nTrying to create buttercup symlink...\nSymlink created successfully.\nin your install phase of the whole thing.\n. Yes it's quite strange. It's part of the npm install command, so something may have caused it not to run.\nPlease re-open if it occurs for you again. Cheers.\n. This depends on #1 \n. Looks good, let's get it in there :)\n. Seems something was up with the current state of installation.. Hopefully this doesn't crop up again.\n. This requires buttercup-pw/buttercup-core#38 before the interface can be built in this project.\n. Key files are now supported in buttercup-core.\n. This is definitely an interesting area of work, but it should be noted here also that our app is built on Electron and therefore Chrome - which does not support most features boasted by Yubikey. We're limited by that and are very much downstream.\nIf there are ways for yubikey to provide a key as text input or some other way that's not hard to implement we could look at integration already. Otherwise I'm not sure that there's much to be done here... Is this still valid @sallar?\nThe save time due to high iterations is somewhat necessary - it provides a good layer of security. I imagine the time will grow longer when we up the default iteration counts on the core.\n. @sallar What do you think?\n. This currently does not look like an issue with our setup.\nCould you reply with your node/npm versions, OS, and the exact command you ran?\n. Closing due to no activity.\n. Related to #78. This is now possible to implement using Buttercup core version 1.2.0 (support added for changing the password). /cc @sallar . This one isn't so much a bug as it would be an improvement. Deleting or moving the file is a bit weird, especially if it's on a storage (webdav/dropbox) that's not easily/possibly checked.\nThis could be achieved for file-type archives only, by looping over them on startup and checking if they exist using an async call. Call could be cancelled if it takes longer than x milliseconds.. This may be auto resolved by @sallar's refactor.\n. Hi @srivignes - I don't currently see any need, in your example, to use Credentials. You can simply get the username and password by mainEntry.getProperty(\"username\") and mainEntry.getProperty(\"password\").\nCredentials were designed to store intermediate login details for services such as webdav etc.\n. Unfortunately it's probably not so clear in the docs, I'll try to make a point of it.\nCheers\n. This is stateful in the archive, and will requite buttercup-pw/buttercup-core#136 to be completed.. Hi David,\nThanks for researching the issue. I don't think that the windows have parents, so closing one should not affect another. At least that's how I recall Electron functioning.\n@sallar would be able to verify.\n. I'd love to speak more on this. Currently on leave with little access to Internet.. When I'm back I'll touch base with you. Apologies for the delay.\n. @aktary email sent.\n. This is a duplicate of #25 - I've mentioned your gist there, thank you.\n. Great suggestions - Must haves from a usability perspective.\n. Due to the core being updated, this also fixes #48 \n. IMHO it's pretty commonplace to have long-running PRs for a number of reasons. It makes it easier for others to follow the changes and progress, rather than just looking at a branch. A PR keeps the status of a project in a more visible location. I like seeing the issues it affects (closes) and if there were tests, we could see the stability of the work as well.\nJust my two cents \ud83d\ude04\n. Already fixed.. Better described in duplicate #124 . Were you still experiencing this @RyanCwynar? Did you do this through the interface?\n. Perhaps not.\nLet us know if you notice it again @RyanCwynar and we can re-open.. Please be aware that this should be implemented in parallel in the core. It's not enough that the interface protects against it, it should be blocked at the functionality level.\n. This shouldn't be closed until it's also implemented in the core.\n. I could also implement it, was just mentioning that they should go together \ud83d\ude42\n. This is already in progress in the core (I started it recently), so perhaps this should be blocked until that part is done (buttercup-pw/buttercup-core#121)\nEDIT: However this UI behavioural part is still free, of course. Please let us know @alireza-ahmadi if you're available to do this.. The core part (buttercup-pw/buttercup-core#121) is now complete and in production as v0.31.0.\nFirst come first served on the PR \ud83d\ude04\nEDIT: Of course the empty-trash functionality is still pending in core: buttercup-pw/buttercup-core#131. So i've released buttercup-pw/buttercup-core#131 (Trash emptying) as 0.32.0: https://github.com/buttercup-pw/buttercup-core/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0320\n~This is not yet in the core-web package so it can't be used here just yet, but this UI functionality can be added without waiting.~\nCore-web is now at 0.16.0 and includes the trash improvements.. I'm not sure this is a bug.. Just an enhancement? Right now they're not ordered at all, just random.\n. Thanks @alireza-ahmadi - Definitely a good feature to have.\n. Hmm.. I feel either option could work. Either clean quit (my preference) or spawn window when re-clicked. Maybe to just save on resources we should full-quit.. I don't see a use-case in leaving it running for nothing.\nWhat do you think @sallar ?\n. This bricks the application.. so I've raised the priority. In my opinion the app shouldn't close, but the main window should be re-opened when clicking the icon in this state:\n\n. Will be handled another way - #120 . That's a good idea. Obviously we'd probably need to show the length while typing, like the others do I'm sure, but when saving and loading it should definitely be a fixed length display.. And thanks for the remark! \ud83d\ude04. What do you think @sallar ?. > It's doable we just need to put in a bit of time.\nI guess the high effort tag is correct then. Well perhaps we need to brainstorm this a bit. Maybe some sort of update(mode) function could work. We could watch for focus changes and if on mac, do it slightly differently.. It is, but I closed the other as this was more descriptive..\n. @sallar Absolutely :) Since we can do most things from the keyboard on a Mac, for instance, it would be nice to be able to log into an archive doing the same. For instance on Keypass, the password is prompted immediately. I think this functionality is still vital for usability, especially for users (like myself) that have a primary archive or even only 1 archive.. @sallar @darsain I quite like the idea of this approach. Like you said, it's configurable without needing a specific configuration flag - having the archive in the first position would allow it to be unlocked automatically without having to select it.\nWhat I'd be interested in regarding this would be the UX - I don't know how much I like the idea of having the unlock dialog forced-open for all users by default.. Any ideas here?. It might be best to have #554 completed before attempting this as well (listing the archive name in unlock window). I guess having a setting to enable auto-login would be acceptable in my opinion. Pressing escape or clicking in the background is a low-effort action to choose another archive - having my \"main\" archive unlockable by simply booting Buttercup and typing my master password is definitely a desirable level of efficiency. . @sallar ?. > we don't have a specific Title bar section\nYes that is a problem.. What about clicking in the area beside the mac buttons? Left of the search box?\n\n. Hey mate, could you check this out when you get time? \ud83d\ude04 . So all fixed. Is this good to go @sallar ?. This is now dependent on buttercup/buttercup-importer#9 being merged and released.. Buttercup importer v0.8.0 has support for 1password.. This is strange, because some others are fine:\n\n. @sallar Ah, but that's a bit tricky when you don't know that. The hover only shows \"Copy\", so it's not immediately clear that there are any other features..\nWouldn't it be easier to also have a show button?. I think from usability that we should discuss how we could improve all interaction around the password field... I would say that having a reveal button is almost more important that copy, having thought about it. We could poll it. The copy password would almost be more intuitive on right click, and the reveal being the button:\n\n. I think we should poll it at very least, because I find myself copying it char by char onto my device sometimes (if I don't want to install a password manager there). That's more important than copying which I would normally do by right-clicking.\nPoll here: https://twitter.com/perry_mitchell/status/818157585543077892. I think the poll will show that 2 buttons is preferred.. which I quite like the idea of. It could simply be two permanent buttons visible in some neat way at the end of the input:\n\nWhat do you think @sallar ? (obviously prettier than my example of course). What about a simple bar like the following? https://github.com/react-component/progress\nIt could be only a slight contrast difference to the bg colour of Buttercup and could simply count down with the time left before clipboard clearing..\nWhat do you think @sallar ?. > it guesses the result from all chars in title and username\nBut should it show results that have no relation to the string entered in the search box? Seems a bit misleading. We could even do a case-insensitive contains search, and just let Buttercup manage it.... Yes, true.. but should a random group of characters match all results? Probably not. \nAnd it might be worth considering whether or not this plugin will allow us to deep-search the archive.. Closed in favour of #136 . @sallar Not yet, hopefully soon :). Yep! It's used in the browser extension..\n. So these areas use the title for navigation detection:\n\nhttps://github.com/buttercup-pw/buttercup/blob/2f1f3c697418a3359dfed2a92f8930bd618652fe/app/index.html#L5\nhttps://github.com/buttercup-pw/buttercup/blob/9ccc1261b6e7da90c7bbd5e7626c50afec0e7966/src/main/config/menu/file.js#L32\nhttps://github.com/buttercup-pw/buttercup/blob/2f1f3c697418a3359dfed2a92f8930bd618652fe/src/renderer/redux/modules/workspace.js#L27\n\nPerhaps something like browserWindow.webContents.getURL() could be used with some regex to detect if it's the intro or logged-in area?\nWe could also build a wrapper for when we create the browser windows, so that once the browser window is created, we listen for changes: browserWindow.webContents.on('did-navigate', ...), and then change a property on the window object: browserWindow.buttercupLocation = \"workspace\";.

Will try investigating more tonight.. A certificate has now been purchased so that we can perform code signing. After that goes through we should be able to code sign the binaries so that auto update will work.. I don't think this is necessary right now.. We can reopen if necessary.. @ws141 I personally agree with that point - it'd be better than leaving it open permanently. This is how our platform currently behaves:\n\nMobile app autolocks after 10? minutes\nBrowser extension locks on closing of all tabs\nDesktop doesn't currently autolock\n\nSo it would be very beneficial to have this feature. It would, in my opinion, have to:\n\nLock all currently unlocked archives\nListen for user-cues in terms of activity\nReset lock timer on mouse move\nReset lock timer on focus change\nReset lock timer on tray icon menu open\nDisable the timer while any item is being edited\n\nDoes that sound fair? What's your opinion @sallar?. Let's move the task of just auto-locking, without the setting, to here: #587. Hi @rohanthacker - Well the right repo will be one of the following:\n\nCore (only username + password required): https://github.com/buttercup-pw/buttercup-core\nCore-web (username + password, Oauth etc.): https://github.com/buttercup-pw/buttercup-core-web\n\nI'm not familiar with the Drive API, but I presume that it requires Oauth or some kind of user acceptance. I'd guess that it should be then in core-web.\nHow this is implemented is by simply adding a corresponding Datasource class so that serialisation works correctly.. @rohanthacker I'll probably close this issue, but please open one on core/core-web if you discover how Google Drive's API works. We definitely want all major cloud service providers supported!. Thanks @rohanthacker. Please let us know if you need any help/info.\nIf you're looking to confirm that the integration works, it might make sense to npm link it to the browser extension so you can test it in a live environment. The desktop GUI might be a bit more complex if user-authorisation is required, but @sallar can help you there if you choose to try that.. @guyromb @jsbberlin We're planning to add support for the individual apps very shortly, but in the meantime I have opened a new issue on mobile (buttercup/buttercup-mobile#148) and will reopen this one too, so we can track the progress \ud83d\ude0a. Oh yeah!. Thanks for filing an issue.\nAs we need to reproduce this, could you please try creating a new archive with your version of keepass, add some passwords to it (fake data) and see if that imports?\nIf it fails as well, you could send us that file and it's password for us to debug with. If it works, there may be some complication with your archive's data and the keepass library we use (we didn't write the keepass parsing logic). On that note, you could try using the library to see if the problem is on the Buttercup side or the keepass side.. This is still occurring with 0.10.1:\n\n. Thanks for the patience @vectorsize !. Can't reproduce currently, will reopen if necessary.. If it's a permanent option that has its last value remembered between closes of the application, that would be perfect.\nYou could sort:\n - alphabetically \n - last access?\nBut if we start with alphabetical sorting my default that would already be better imo.. Sure. I like that. I guess I mean that we could straight away sort it alphabetically without the need for a button until we make updates later?\nAlso, last access will need more implementation..\n. > I actually meant the default\nSorry, I'm thick. What do you mean by default?\n\nreal last access would be nice in the future\n\nAbsolutely. Having the a-z sorting now would just improve the locating of folders so much.. very low-hanging fruit.. No this is for archives on the initial screen :)\n. @sallar Any idea with regards to yarn handling these optional dependencies? Seems that macos-alias is the culprit but it doesn't even show up in @lietu's npm logs (I would expect it to read like the others).\nMaybe we add a note for windows users to stick with npm temporarily?. @dealloc What version of yarn did you try with?\n@sallar Seems to be some larger issue with Yarn atm.. perhaps we can recommend npm as the primary installation medium? \nThere's deeper issues here which we can't affect:\n\nyarnpkg/yarn#1059 Properly ignoring optionaDependencies\nyarnpkg/yarn#1233 Issues with the --ignore-optional flag. Would also obviously be a good idea to try with the latest yarn.. :)\n. If you could try it after clearing node modules and cache that would be awesome :). Thanks @lietu! Unfortunately our windows development processes are somewhat non-existent (although we want to support windows just as well as Mac & Linux). Hopefully yourself or someone might consider making a PR at some point to fix it, otherwise it might be a bit of a slow burn until we can wrangle together some windows machines (hopefully soon).. Seems to also not work on linux (ctrl-c on entries).. @lietu @sallar I agree - I think the shortcuts should be obvious. The less help users need to look up the better. Even if it's more painful I'd opt for the easier use.. @xtrasmal I don't think it's a completely bad idea using the local filesystem if the HTML5 API is straightforward enough, I've just never looked at it. Thanks for bring this up - we'll definitely look into it as an option despite your situation having been solved for now.. Hi @codeclown - thanks for making an issue.\n\nCurrently there is not, but there's no reason that we could choose not to support it. I'd just like to understand the use-case a bit better before fleshing it out fully.\nSo I understand basic auth, but I've never actually seen a site that uses it (or at least not to my knowledge). Do you know if any online that do, or demo projects that allow it? I could set it up myself but I'm afraid that I'd miss the point and not implement something entirely helpful.\nIt looks that basic auth is just continually sending a header like Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l for example, over and over for each request to that site.. right?. As this has to do with the browser extension, I've moved it there: buttercup-pw/buttercup-browser-extension#59. What do you think @sallar ?. What about a combination here? A font like Anonymous Pro or Roboto Mono with digit highlighting? What do you think @sallar?. Looks great! Could you show what the dupes look like beside each other? Like LlI|ij1oO0 for example.. :). Beautiful!\n. I quite like the idea, but is the domain something you fill in first @MahdiMajidzadeh? When I create credentials, for instance, title is usually the first thing I enter. In the browser extension I can see this being quite simple.\nFor this we could add detection so that:\n\nUser stops typing URL field (URL/url)\nCheck that the title is empty\nSet title to domain part. Hi @MahdiMajidzadeh - Just looking for your input on your usage of buttercup for this item. I can't currently see how this would work for \"regular\" use (I'm biased here obviously), and it'd be great if you could explain how you'd expect it to work.. Closed as the functionality will be handled by buttercup-pw/buttercup-browser-extension#58. Hi @smxsm - This sounds like you're getting overwritten copies (old versions) of your archive coming through. To confirm, you're using buttercup GUI and saving files in a webdav sync'd directory, right?\n\nI suspect that your webdav server may either be reverting to old file versions or is completely disregarding your updated copies (saves) and just overwriting them with old copies from the server. You could try saving several times and checking the file size/contents locally and remotely to ensure that the changes are making it to the server.. > already deleted entries, folders or custom values keep coming back like zombies\nYour case is interesting for sure. At this stage I'd still lean towards the issue being with WebDAV, however, as it seems more likely that it's overwriting your local copy.\nWhat you could try to do it copy the file out of your webdav directory and put it somewhere static. Load and save it from there for some time and see if the issue still occurs - my guess is that it probably doesn't - but I'm open minded.\nLet's go from there so we can rule some things out \ud83d\ude42. > Buttercup and WebDAV\nI agree that it looks funny here, but if you using a sync client then Buttercup doesn't have much to do with it. It writes to a file and reads from it in a very simple manner.\nThat being said - @sallar can you think of any peculiarities with our saving system in the GUI? The filesystem has always been a bit more custom here and just want to make sure that we're not missing some complexity here that might behave differently in this scenario... > So it looks like it was only a problem with accessing the file via Windows Explorer or MAC Finder.\nI really hope so. Let us know if it's still reoccurring. . Sorry to hear @smxsm. Currently it definitely looks like an issue with your WebDAV synchronisation - We can't really affect that with Buttercup so at this stage there's probably no issue with the desktop application.\nWe'll keep an eye on the webdav sync during our regular testing and will obviously let you know if we see anything of concern. If you do happen to discover what's causing the issue please don't hesitate in filing another issue... Seems that we've been able to reproduce this, though mostly just with trash:\n\n^ I've emptied the trash several times, so there seems to be some load issue coupled with webdav possibly.. Seems that trash is completely impossible to empty \ud83d\ude05. @smxsm please try the latest version - hopefully we've weeded out the weirdness. There's still some updates to come which may affect your case (#219), but this one should help immensely.. Thanks @jancborchardt. This needs to be added in buttercup-core also: buttercup/buttercup-core#147. > Will it work?\nIt should definitely, yes. That being said it would be nice to officially support it. Extending the datasource would be trivial across core+desktop+browser, but we'd just need to test it properly.. But let's not use the owncloud data source though :) That will create confusion with saved data source types..\n@sallar Let's alias this in the core so it's seamless :). Well it\u2019ll extend the nextcloud datasource.. so if next cloud uses /remote.php/webdav/ from the root then yes it\u2019ll be mostly identical. Having the name means that it can be treated separately and retain its own name and identity in all of our interfaces.. MR is blocked due to unexpected results from Nextcloud servers. Needs further assistance / investigation.. @C-A-T9LIFE Thanks for filing. Is there any way you could check using webdav-client? It's what we use in buttercup to connect WebDAV accounts.. > Make the compiled client under Windows?\nI'm not sure what you mean. If you're talking about this project it can be built on windows using the readme instructions. If you mean the webdav-client project then yes, it should also work on windows: npm install webdav-client. If you use the example in that readme with your credentials and the yandex path you're having trouble with, that would really help with debugging.. > Works, but it's bad.\nWhat do you mean?\n\nI meant need webdav-client-0.5.0.exe.\n\nIt's a nodejs project which needs to be run from the command line. There's only source code, no executable. If you don't have experience writing Javascript this may not be something you'll want to try.. @sallar Seems that there may be something wrong with WebDAV. I also couldn't get it to work with Yandex in the interface, but it works with webdav-client on the command line:\n\nI'll test with webdav-fs soon. If that works then there may be a bug.. @sallar It works in any-fs currently, so the problem must lie elsewhere:\n```js\nconst AnyFS = require(\"./index.js\");\nconst wfs = require(\"webdav-fs\")(\n    \"https://webdav.yandex.ru\",\n    \"username\",\n    \"password\"\n);\nconst afs = AnyFS(wfs);\nafs\n    .readDirectory(\"/\")\n    .then(function(contents) {\n        console.log(contents);\n    });\n```. Ok, so let's check this out as an isolated issue then. We might be missing something somewhere. Obviously 2-factor won't work with yandex, but regular user/pass should.\nI removed the milestone as we could fix this faster as a bug. Perhaps no need to add a specific datasource for yandex as they just promote their webdav connector.. @sallar Sure. I guess any broken connectivity on a working webdav service is a higher prio though, if people can't use it. Obviously if the bug lies elsewhere we can link from here - but the issue is still present in the GUI so it'll need to trickle into a patch release.\nI can handle this issue as I've now got a yandex disk account :smile: . So there seems to be some combination of factors here.. At least the reload happens due to some other error, causing the webdav request to fail. No idea why it doesn't happen with other providers (yet), but there's some complication with yandex and the dialog.. @C-A-T9LIFE You could give version 0.12.1 a try with Yandex, the issue should now be fixed.. > all kinds of wrong charatcers which are not valid as file name\n@sallar What do you mean? I guess it could of course contain other alphabetical chars from other languages.. but you mean slashes / and dots .?. > /[\\w\\-. ]+/\nWhat about underscore, square brackets etc? Maybe something like /[\\w._~$\\[\\]-]+/?. Thinking something like this:\njavascript\nexport function saveWorkspace() {\n  const workspace = getWorkspace().instance;\n  // return getWorkspace().instance.save();\n  return workspace\n    .localDiffersFromRemote()\n    .then(differs => differs ?\n      workspace.mergeSaveablesFromRemote().then(() => true) :\n      false\n    )\n    .then(shouldSave => shouldSave ?\n      workspace.save() :\n      null\n    );\n}. Thanks @sallar!. @sallar Is this new functionality that's needed or some kind of bug?. This could be detected by checking every entry's isInTrash() \ud83d\ude0a. Blocked by #221 . @smxsm Have you tried again on 0.12.2 at least? https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup/releases/tag/v0.12.2-alpha\nIt had some webdav tweaks.. This probably doesn't need a release I guess.. What do you think @sallar ?. @smxsm this is actually planned for a future product which is currently in development. Sharing via traditional sources (Dropbox/WebDAV) with read only mode is not really possible, as the user could still write to the cloud storage provider (even by accident), overwriting the original \"read only\" file.\nThe only way to do this is to have a service which manages \"accounts\", and permissions could be controlled in a more centralised manner. I won't reveal too much more, but this is in the works.. That being said, there will also be a host-your-own buttercup server option soonish. I think we would also be open to some kind of sharing there as well.. @smxsm for now I'll close this, as the work will be undertaken as in our roadmap.. 0 bytes? That looks interesting.. I wonder if it didn't initialise properly. What do you think @sallar? Also, we should figure out why the error is stringifying whatever data there is into [object Object].\n@scharepmc2hr we might need more to reproduce this.. Could you possibly try creating a local archive first, saving that, then upload that to dropbox and try to open it using the Dropbox option in buttercup? If we could narrow it down that'd help a lot.. @sallar @icetee I guess this has to do with browser integration with Yubikeys (and USB dongles in general)? I also have no idea how Yubikeys interact with the browser+dropbox, but I imagine it may be something we can address if Chrome supports it (depending on electron of course).. Thanks @icetee, this looks somewhat promising. That being said, we're currently blocked by this, so I'll place it on hold until upstream works out integration.. @sallar Did you get nextcloud working alright?. Any-fs 0.3.0 is out @sallar . Hi @jancborchardt - We're trying to get Nextcloud working, but there seems to be a 503 error coming when requesting the archive after we've created it (via WebDAV PUT). Accessing it later with GET works, but when trying GET immediately we get a 503 Service unavailable error. We don't see the same with ownCloud, though it's hosted in my house and not remotely (as such) like the Nextcloud demo we're using.\nAny ideas?. @sallar Let's have another look at this tomorrow so we can get some info back to the Nextcloud gents.\n@rullzer @jancborchardt It seems that there is, imo, some lag when creating a file via PUT. We create a new archive, PUT it to Nextcloud WebDAV, and then try to retrieve it immediately after that operation has finished - the resulting 503 makes it feel like Nextcloud hasn't finished writing the file, or it is delayed or not yet ready for consumption.\nIs there some difference between ownCloud + Nextcloud in how files are written to the database? Could the Nextcloud demo installations be any different to an average Nextcloud installation in terms of database / speed / asynchronicity?. @sallar After trying this again in the core, I can't get the error occurring again. Using the following code, I get correct responses all the time:\n```javascript\nconst Buttercup = require(\"buttercup\");\nconst { Archive, NextcloudDatasource, createCredentials } = Buttercup;\nlet archive = Archive.createWithDefaults();\nlet nccreds = createCredentials(\"nextcloud\");\nnccreds.setValue(\"username\", \"admin\");\nnccreds.setValue(\"password\", \"perrym\");\nlet ncds = new NextcloudDatasource(\n    \"https://demo.nextcloud.com/perrym/\",\n    \"/test4.bcup\",\n    nccreds\n);\nncds.save(archive, createCredentials.fromPassword(\"testing\"))\n    .then(function() {\n        console.log(\"Saved\");\n        return ncds.load(createCredentials.fromPassword(\"testing\"))\n            .then(function(archive) {\n                console.log(\"Good\", archive.toObject());\n            });\n    })\n    .catch(function(err) {\n        console.error(err);\n    });\n```\n\n. Perhaps it could even be under the same context item?\nCopy ->\n         Username\n         Password\n         URL (eventually, if set). Refer to #244 for implementation notes.. ~Blocked by buttercup/buttercup-core#124 and buttercup/buttercup-core#153, in order.~\nThis can be taken as a hard coded solution in the meantime. . @kanallie I can confirm this issue, but for me the www. prefix doesn't matter. It only works if the prefix is https:///http://. I'll open a new issue.. I've opened a new issue here: #440. Hi @d2s - Thanks for posting. Are you currently using windows to produce this issue?. @d2s @sallar So that looks correct to me - 0.14.3 is the latest version. Are there any further issues here?. @sallar One of the checks failed sir... And same here @sallar . Thanks @mikebowering - yes it seems as though they have reverted, also on linux:\n\nThanks for letting us know. This definitely wasn't intentional.. Let's do a private build first - could you send me the deb file after building @sallar? :). > due to missing \"Auth Header\" when using https\nI don't see how this can be the case, as I can confirm I see it sent all the time for several ownCloud instances (mine is also running HTTPS). The only clean/stable way we found was to use the Authorization header, which works the same over HTTP/HTTPS.\nThis line looks like the response from the server was bad ('response'):\nsetup.views.js:33 PROPFIND https://192.168.2.20:5006/ net::ERR_INSECURE_RESPONSE\nAs for the nginx server, this could easily be misconfiguration or some incompatibility we haven't foreseen. It would be best if we could see the interaction between the services - otherwise we can't move forward with debugging.\n@andre-dierker would it be possible for you to try the chrome extension? You could open up devtools while running it and export a HAR file - you could share this with us, obviously after removing any sensitive hashes etc.. You could also email it to us at info@buttercup.pw so that it's not shared to the public. This transaction would definitely help us see where the problem is.. Thanks @andre-dierker - this is slightly better. We can see the authorization here is mentioned there correctly, so the request from buttercup looks correct.\nWhat NAS are you using? Are you using a self-signed certificate at all (could be the issue)? Can you try on HTTP?. @andre-dierker I've edited your 2 last posts - just remember to hide sensitive information like the value in the auth header, and use github markdown formatting to make the JSON easier to read \ud83d\ude09\nI think in most cases self-signed certs will fail.. Browsers (like Chrome, which is used in this project via Electron) will by default reject self-signed certs unless you explicitly allow it somehow.. Well there's S.O. answers like this one which seem to show some way of handling self-signed certificates. If you're using the Chrome extension with buttercup with the self-signed certs this could help you - but not sure if it'd work.\nTo be honest, however, I don't particularly see the usefulness of having them supported. It would be substantial dev effort to build some kind of interface into the Electron app to support these, and this would also make using them in the Chrome extension very tricky. Free tools like LetsEncrypt allow for almost instant verified certificates for publicly exposed servers, and for internal use I would suggest just using HTTP (or, if your router works like mine and supports it, just allow it to route the external domain name internally so you can just hit the same server + SSL cert anywhere).\nRight now I don't see any use case for self-signed certificates. Glad you found the issue!. This is related to #78, and could be coupled together in the same release.. Hi @worldofsmarty - This is definitely on our todo list. The core of our application supports sharing, but doing so with archive files is not practical (merge conflicts, accessibility, encryption all make it close to impossible). We will be releasing a service this year where we'll support hosted archives, and this will support shared groups.. > What's this \"service's\" status - couldn't see anything hugely relevant on roadmap[r] (e.g. URLs/dates)?\nIt's been a crazy time since then, and we've delayed some of said service's features in favour of concentrating on some community open-source ones instead. It'll be ready very soon but no ETA right now. We're hoping for this year but just as 2017, we won't make any promises until we have the entire service running on our infrastructure.\n\nRelated to sharing, I would also like to suggest some type of emergency access for family/friends\n\nEmergency access is a nice idea, but I'm not sure that something in this area would help (rather than just sharing a master password, which I don't condone) and not cause security concerns at the same time. What would you propose?. @ldexterldesign Having such control as you suggest requires a service, which we're providing in the near future as a part of our business model for Buttercup. Buttercup's range of free functionality works by hosting the vault file on storage mediums, so there's no overhead for managing shared access besides the master password and the hosted directory itself.\nFor sharing to work outside of our hosted plans, a lock file of some description would need to be implemented to prevent conflicts while writing updates. That or the auto-consumption of conflict files as they're detected.. Thanks for reporting @valentinebm - What version of Buttercup are you using? If possible, could you also try to create a new archive through Buttercup and its Dropbox integration to see if that works? It'd help us narrow it down.. Hi @valentinebm - what I meant was create an archive in dropbox using the \"Load from Cloud Services\" option in the root menu. See if that loads..\nDid you have any luck with any Dropbox issues @sallar ?. Buttercup-importer v0.9.1 has the lastpass support.. Hi @matthaias - I'm not able to replicate this issue. Looks to be some problem with the update server and the versions exchanged between that and the app. \nCould you try restarting the application? Does it change anything? I have a feeling this one might be very hard to track down if it's repeatable.. It shouldn't automatically install the new version, that should happen once you click the update link (right @sallar?).\nSo you're saying that you're running v0.17.0 but still seeing the update message for 0.17.0? And if you click update, it remains at 0.17.0 and the update message comes back?. > I probably need to clear that message if you close the app without installing the update\nWhy would you want to clear it? Wouldn't you want it shown still if the app is opened again?\nThis is quite a quirky one. We could roll our own update notification with something like this. I couldn't get it to work in browser but the docs show it as available.. Closing the dialog and clicking the button half works:\n\n. Thanks @donty! If you discover anymore on FF sync we'd appreciate it. Having more of an idea of how hard it might be may make it easier for someone to contribute.. This is blocked by buttercup/buttercup-importer#5 and it's on our todo list. Apologies for the inconvenience. \n273 is also required for this to go through.. Thanks @hhdri . Moved to buttercup/buttercup-website#13. @xWayfarer Thanks for posting. Your english is fine, and your idea is great. We've previously spoken about this kind of system, but it's probably a bit more complex than it sounds.\nFor instance, I don't think that we should be connecting directly to a 3rd party API (you might not have meant this). This means that we need to host something ourselves. To avoid yet another NodeJS daemon on the server as a proxy or something, I would suggest that we store a JSON file there (along with deployment or auto updates etc.) that is downloaded by each Buttercup application so that all users get the warnings. That raises questions of its own:\n\nDo we store all hacked account details from the 3rd party so we can alert individual users? \nDo we notify account holders of some-hacked-website if a domain has been listed?\nDo we show the notification all of the time, or do we memorise them having seen it and then hide it? (If we remember, it has to be per archive due to multiple users. This requires even more work: Archive \"settings\".)\n\n@sallar definitely need more ideas here :)\n\nThere is a similar feature in 1password. Which has too, a time checker\n\nThis is a separate item altogether: Password expiry. Imo, like in Keepass, it should be optional and be customisable per entry. This requires additions to be made to the core (buttercup-core) (should include a notification centre of some sort).\n\nAnother feature can be \"Do you use your credentials safely\". ... It's a browser extension feature.\n\nYes, this should be created in the browser extension repo.\nThere's a lot here, and I think that once we've identified the tasks we should create them separately and perhaps even close this one.... > Sending private information to a 3rd party API does not sound safe to me.\nYeah definitely. It means that the whole list should be downloaded by the client (Buttercup).\n\nit will notify you of your account has been exposed\n\nYeah that would definitely be the more complete approach. I guess we have to store the lists on our server.. but we'd definitely need a CDN if we were to use those, which is another operating cost. We should discuss this from an infrastructure perspective if we go that way.. > This API remove this problem.\nI agree, and what I'm suggesting is merely mirroring their content in some format that makes it easy and practical for us to send to our apps. I don't think it's appropriate that every user connects to their API individually, for both the API's sake and ours, and so connecting to some source on *.buttercup.pw would be best.\n\nI don't kown very well but maybe we can have a JSON file \"security definitions\" in a Github repo.\n\nThis would be good for contributions, but if we have access to an API, why would we accept user additions/changes? The API would be a trusted source of information which hopefully does its own auditing.\n\nMaybe it can, too, be displayed like a red message \"You have security failure - Look more\" in the head of the app.\n\nAbsolutely! Being active like this is great, and it's something that'd put me at ease as well. Providing the process is seamless (the user needs to do nothing), this will work well. They already have domains and usernames in the each entry, so that should be enough to detect issues.\n\nThis is set globally in settings (for all password), and locally (each entry, if the user want too).\n\nThis is a good idea, but I would advise not to rush on it as it requires application settings.. which is a much bigger task (both in core and UI).\n\nWhat have been changed and what security failures.\n\nWhat do you mean by this?\n\nI will try to add the Password expiry feature in buttercup-core\n\nGreat! Please create an issue there first as we should discuss architecture before you begin. Due to the settings part not being done, the expiry feature will only be possible to do on a per-entry basis for now (using attributes).. Ok, so revisiting this, after such a long time, it might be easier to query haveibeenpwned's API directly. Here's some example GET endpoints:\n\nhttps://haveibeenpwned.com/api/breachedaccount/iamlegend@live.com - Gets PWN'd services for an account name\nhttps://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v2/breach/MySpace - Gets PWN details for a breach, which could be displayed to the user.\n\nThe rate limit is 1 request per 1.5 seconds per IP address, so we could implement some basic request-and-retry logic until the result comes back (with forced 1.5 second wait times of course).\nEDIT: This would also need UI work to show something on the Entry. Perhaps something to indicate one of 3 states:\n * OK: No breach detected\n * Breach-Inactive: Breach detected but password changed since breach date\n * Breach-Active: Breach detected, password should be changed\nThoughts @sallar?. Hi @morojgovany - Thanks for creating an issue.\nWhen using the desktop app, did you connect to your provider using WebDAV as well? Also, does your password contain special characters? If it does then there's an ongoing issue in the browser extension project which should hopefully be solved soon.\nIf this is an issue with just the extension we should move the issue there :). > Thanks for your answer and your app ! :+1:\nThanks a lot!\n\nwhich password is problematic ? The webdav provider's or the masterpass for archive ?\n\nThe webdav provider. In the current webdav module in the browser extension (the one in the desktop app is newer), URLs are formatted as so: https://webdavUsername:webdavPassword@myprovider.com/some/webdav/path. This is completely valid, but ugly and has the largest downside of all - No special characters will work because it's actually a URL. If your password were letters and numbers you'd have no problem, but this is of course impractical and stupid so we just need to update the webdav module (easier said than done) and this problem should go away.\nThanks for posting! I'll leave this open until it's solved.. We're using a new webdav library in this project, so for the desktop application this issue with the password and special characters should be solved.. > Hi, i'm realy excited about what you've done with this project, we've realy missed this kind of tools before and i think it's gonna help a lots of people.\nThanks!\n\nA nice feature would be to be able to export the database in a standard formats like csv or json, cause' one of the aspect to use free software is it's ability to be interoperable with other tools and standard formats\n\nAgreed.\n\nyou could use a gpg based encryption to protect, that way it could be easy for anyone\n\nMany platforms export to unencrypted formats for easy interop support.. which would probably be our first port of call. Having encrypted exports is nice for backup purposes, but backups as a whole is another task. Backup features need to support all of our remote sync systems (webdav/dropbox etc.) and it needs to be well integrated into the platform. I'd advise anyone reading this to keep export and backup separate for simplicity's sake :smile: . > Issue for making the master password changeable. Unfortunately with no news\nApologies regarding the lateness there - We're now working to complete the password-change feature. It's already been added in core.. I think you misunderstood- my colleague was referring to changing the master password, not exporting archives... An update on this: Exporting will soon be available to CSV. No other export formats are planned at this stage.. Thanks for posting @bagage - This really depends on two things:\n\nCommunity interest and support (PRs & maintenance)\nTestability\n\nFirst and foremost we'd need an easy way to test it so that would remain stable between releases. After that, someone would need to implement a Datasource in the core library. Once that's done and released, we'd need to add explorers to the browser extension and this desktop application. \nIf someone's willing to research it and put in the effort, we could definitely consider adding it. It would have to be for more than 1 person of course, so we'd need to know what the usage would be like.. I'm going to close this for now, as we definitely don't have the bandwidth to add this currently. We would definitely consider a PR to add this to the desktop application and maybe the core library. Further cloud storage integrations can be tracked on our roadmap.. I was able to reproduce on 0.17.1:\n\nSeems that the New Group button doesn't work at all with the latest release. @anarchogeek right-click seems to function. We'll get on this right away.. @anarchogeek we're checking on it now, and should hopefully have a fix out shortly. Sorry for the inconvenience... Thanks @llkiriell - This is blocked by #285. Although those files exist, we do not currently have any translations available. We're looking at adding a translation system so people can contribute and add localisations based upon demand. We should have this soon enough :). @simonbcn I've created an issue on the extension repo for this.. Hi @simonbcn - As we only have memory and localstorage really in the browser, we don't have many options in storing archives. We won't be encrypting your master password so that it stays open between browser sessions, and once you close your browser and re open it it has to be in the locked state as the memory was wiped.. Unfortunately this repo is also just for the desktop application, so I'll have to close this issue. Please open another issue here if you have a suggested implementation in mind. Sorry for the inconvenience.. @simonbcn @sum01 Thanks for setting this up. Is there something that needs to be added to this repo to make this process more efficient?\nIf not I'd recommend renaming this issue to better suite the plan - notifying users in the readme or something like that.. > I've decided that buttercup isn't for me\nSorry to hear that @simonbcn. We'll be continuing to improve it and we hope you'll check it out again in the future... Reopening as it seems that there is indeed work to do here. @sum01 would you be kind enough to suggest some text that could be placed in the readme? We're not so familiar with arch builds.. . Thanks a lot @sum01. I've made a PR to update the readme: #296.. > it doesn't remember the last selected group and it always goes to General\nThis doesn't happen now however.. It would be better than the current last created group which it seems to do.\n\nthis lastGroup thing can be also one of those. right?\n\nI think so.. that sounds easiest :)\nThis is extremely minor of course.. just a nice to have :). Checking in the desktop app would be a good idea. Did you @tomatlscomm enter it as https://XXX.com/cloud in the URL field of the new ownCloud connection? It won't automatically add the /cloud portion obviously... Ok, I can confirm that this is a bug. I've moved it to the extension where it belongs: https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-browser-extension/issues/80. Let's do it.. No harm in it. Let's do a sanity check afterwards to make sure our gear works as expected:\n\nWebsite & download links\nTwitter links (profiles)\nTravis\n\nAlso @sallar make sure to update the git url in the package.json ;). @Defman21 @sum01 Good call. I don't necessary like the idea of supporting 32bit platforms anymore, but if it's available then fine.. > I can remove the 32-bit stuff from the AUR if you want\nPerhaps it's more work to remove it than it is to update the readme \ud83d\ude05 - Thanks for the offer. Great that we've got yet another supported platform! \ud83d\ude4f. As we don't always have access to Lastpass archives, we would need someone to submit a small test export from Lastpass in CSV format with the following:\n\nSome multi-line values\nValues with commas (including password)\nRegular username/password\n\nThis could be submitted here or in the buttercup-importer project.. This is related to this issue on the importer.. This is good to go when you're ready @sallar \ud83d\udc4d. Ok.. apologies if I've missed something here. I think we want to keep \"buttercup\" for the installed package and not \"buttercup-desktop\" as is mentioned on AUR. . Well regardless, buttercup-desktop is not what we want for the final filenames.. and Sallar, correct me if I'm wrong, but the built source tarball on deployment should still be called buttercup and not buttercup-desktop right?\nI understand that there's a standard approach, but we don't have multiple packages being installed - we only provide \"buttercup\" - the naming of the GitHub repos should not affect the end product.. Just checked the releases and it seems that the filenames are just the tag name, at least for the source. It also seems that the tag is mentioned there:\n\n@sum01 where would you expect buttercup-desktop to show up? If you mean the downloading of master, that also seems kind of counter intuitive imo, but maybe I don't understand the AUR community so well.. Unless I misunderstand, wouldn't this install the package on an arch linux user's machine as \"buttercup-desktop\"? If so that's what we're trying to avoid.\nAll I'm getting at is that we won't be providing another executable really so having \"buttercup\" as the installed package name would be more fitting. I'm hoping the installed name is not tied to the repository name, as that doesn't make any sense imo.\nDoes that make any sense? \ud83d\ude05. Ok.. I don't think we completely see eye to eye but I don't feel it's important enough to keep debating the naming right now. I vote we move forward and merge. @sallar ?. Blocked by buttercup/buttercup-core#165. Ok, to follow up here..\nIt appears as though the issue has to do with the native window.fetch call we were doing here. We've since removed that call and are updating our software, which should hopefully fix the issue.. > I thought about this feature driving to work today, and was looking at the roadmap to see if was already thought of. Glad to see it's on the team's radar.\nYep! From an ease-of-use angle, this is a high priority.\n\nthe app could have an option to auto-push the archive whenever it's updated and the 'trusted devices' are on the same network\ndevice (desktop, laptop, phone) holds the 'master record', and would push the updated archive to the other devices\ntrue sync between the devices so that updates from the desktop/mobile apps are merged and shared\n\nWell, as nice as that would be - we're kinda already there with the app. Archives can be connected to using multiple devices. Changes are merged if 2 places are updated at different times. There's work to be done here in terms of stability, but it functions well. I'm not sure what pushing to trusted devices might accomplish over this, and how niche it might be (just my opinion, happy to hear that of others').\nIf you feel that you've got a good case behind such a feature, we'd be happy to chat more on it.. but perhaps it would deserve its own issue \ud83d\ude0a.\n\nThe roadmap mentions a self-hosted server version of the MyButtercup app/platform\n\nThis was the intention originally, but we're heading in this direction currently:\n\nArchive hosting using existing free/common platforms (many options to self-host your own server here too)\nPossible dedicated archive hosting server (OSS) - it would behave much in the same way that the current archives & cloud services operate\nA Buttercup hosting service for teams and businesses, which will be paid (but very affordable, when compared to competitor pricing). We want to run Buttercup full time, so our goal is to be robust and self-sustainable. A B2B offering would secure Buttercup's future, and this is what we care about. All of the current offerings and those I've mentioned above would remain free and open source forever, though (as mentioned in the roadmap).\n\n\nPersonally, I'd prefer the ability to have this sharing type of convenience\n\nWell we'd love for you to make an issue if you really want this - I'd be happy to hear more about its use case.\n\nparanoia and forgetfulness\n\nPretty much the entire reason we made this app \ud83d\ude01.\n\nKeep up the amazing work gents!\n\nThank you \ud83d\ude4f. > The one thing we don't have is the Archive Name. On desktop the archive name is the filename\n@sallar This is way old, but I was thinking that if we add this feature, the name could simply be like basename(filename) without the extension. The user could then of course change it once scanned.. @sallar The core uses archive names in the ArchiveManager instance, so everything should have a name. I don't think there's anything wrong with the filename currently in desktop, for now. Happy to look into that as well... @key10 Thanks for engaging! \n\nshare the archive files between my phone and laptop directly when on the same network, so that each device would have an updated copy to be able to use offline\n\nThis right here is quite advanced stuff! \ud83d\ude05 Wouldn't it be so that if you're on the same network, you're not really offline? If you were offline, then it's the network that's sealed and you'd want to have your archive in an accessible place within the network that all devices could access. The push-to-device thing would be like a decentralised way of sharing, right?\nIf we're going to tackle the decentralised approach of hosting archives, I'd definitely recommend starting a new issue - that's a big topic right there. As for the offline stuff, that's definitely on the roadmap (#307).\n\nI need to spend more time with buttercup to be more familiar, so I do apologize if these long-winded comments were naive :/ With that, I'm fine wrapping up this thought-thread here, and we can revisit at a later time if need be.\n\nThey're not long winded or naive at all - It's nice having these discussions, so please don't hesitate in raising them \ud83d\udc4d\n\nI suppose it's about time for me to learn React\n\nWell there's many ways to contribute that don't require React knowledge.. But it might be handy. The core will be undergoing a lot of work in the near future as well, and that's nice ground-work to play with.. That's a good point.. but I wonder: at this point, wouldn't it be more likely that a user is using a sync tool? If you're using Dropbox/ownCloud/Nextcloud/Seafile/Yandex etc., there's likely a sync client which you might've installed.\nIf we're to implement such a feature in light of the other option we'd need to handle all the syncing ourselves.. I personally think that there should be some community interest in such a feature before implementing it. This is a good idea, but having it as a feature would mean extra maintenance and testing, so I'm hesitant... > what happens if my computer is offline, I update a password, and while my computer is still offline, I update a password on my phone?\nYeah this is a good point. Ultimately offline usage is important, and is something we need to consider sooner rather than later. I think we should consider putting this on the roadmap, but it'd need core support. @sallar - opinions mate?. Thanks everyone - We currently don't have direct access to a windows machine, so any help would be greatly appreciated!. @4A616D6573 @metamorphosis-org-mk Hey guys, could you please show us the contents of your state? It's located here: ~/AppData/Roaming/Buttercup/storage/state.json - There may be some kind of corruption. If we can figure out what it is we can address it immediately..\nEDIT: By ~ on windows I mean the user's home. Full would be maybe: C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/Buttercup/storage/state.json where USERNAME is your username of course... Thanks guys! Sorry again for the outage. We're working to try and prevent this.. @sallar Agreed it is certainly difficult. Once it's going however, it'll be a massive help for PRs and gradual updates. Let's discuss this next meeting.. I have an idea for this one, which I might try to make today. The requirements of such a test:\n\nBe executable, which exits with success (0) or failure (1+) exit codes.\nWorks on windows, linux and mac\nHas tests for each platform\nTests the bare minimum, to begin with:\nBoot of application without error\n\nShould be started by executing the program with a flag, such as the following: ./buttercup --test=integration. It could then wait until the app boots and finishes, and then could execute some minor tests (to begin with). After which it could force close with exit code 0.. if an error occurs obviously the test should fail.. This is currently underway when fuzzy search is upgraded. Sallar? \ud83d\ude0a. This can be easily added to the desktop application using the EntryFinder class in buttercup core.. I actually quite like the \"All Items\" group.. That's a good idea. What do you think @sallar? It would most likely need to be made available in the core, so that every application could easily benefit from it.\nI think when searching it should clear the currently selected group... @sallar I didn't update package locks as I'm using node 6.. I suppose this won't be a problem?. Hi! Apologies for this.. seems we have some issues on our windows build. We'll try to get this resolved today (hopefully)... This is a duplicate of #311, so I'm closing.. This depends on #540 . Having another look at this issue, I don't think we want to set default labels.. I'll close this due to inactivity. If it's still occurring we can of course re-open it.. @sallar I was thinking that we might consider making this beta already.. and perhaps leap to version 0.20.0 to further that. What are your thoughts?. Hi @v0lv0x @morojgovany - Thanks for looking at this. We need to setup a dev instance of Nextcloud for future work, which should happen this weekend (hopefully). Providing that goes well, we'll look into this straight away.\nEDIT: I'll look at the browser extension at the same time, to add nextcloud support.. Great idea, thanks! I think we want to also have a host within a sub folder to maximise our testing with regards to different environments. Otherwise this setup may be similar to the demo accounts on the Nextcloud site. Will try this nonetheless..  . Got a nextcloud instance running and was able to reproduce straight away:\n\nError occurred immediately when saving a new entry. After then closing the archive and trying to log in again, a similar error occurs:\n\n@sallar I'll raise this to critical I think.\nEDIT: I seem to recall dealing with this sort of problem earlier. The 503 looks to be just a Nextcloud issue:\n\nThe access log shows the first (initial login) request works fine and the subsequent throws a 503:\n\nThe exact same processing on ownCloud causes no error.. which seems to indicate that something has changed with the Nextcloud fork of ownCloud.. > node-fetch is used in webdav-client (and webdav-fs and in result in Webdav, Owncloud and Nextcloud adapters)\nGood point! Well shall we try changing the fetch adapter? Buttercup core supports that now:\njavascript\nconst Buttercup = require(\"buttercup\");\nButtercup.vendor.webdavFS.setFetchMethod(window.fetch);\nor\njavascript\nimport Buttercup from \"buttercup-web\";\nButtercup.vendor.webdavFS.setFetchMethod(window.fetch);\nThat might help with the cookie. We still get problems regarding this in the browser extension. It's because the browser keeps and sends cookies regardless of what we try. Need to look into that a bit more.. Hi! That is unfortunate.. Do you have any other copies or history of the archive? If you use Dropbox or owncloud, for instance, you could restore older copies to try.\nIf none work or you have no older copies, could you download an older release and run that? If you disconnect from the internet to test to prevent auto updates, it should work fine.\nPlease let us know if it works... Ok.. well I guess I don't have to explain the likelihood to restoring a corrupt archive.. so I'm sorry if it turns out to be that way. Nevertheless.. can you open the archive with a text editor? Does it contain \"buttercup\" near the start?\nYou could paste some of the contents here if it's in string/hex form.. just not all of it of course.. first 50/100 chars should do.\n. Well that actually looks normal and not corrupt. Things are looking better already.\nI would suggest that you may have entered your password incorrectly at one critical juncture, but I'm not sure how that might be possible. Could you try with Caps etc? Do you have any alternate keyboard layouts?\nCould you have overwritten your file when creating a new one?. If you'd created a new archive with the same file name by any chance, it would've overridden it with an empty one. Impossible to tell if that's what happened here... Sorry to hear that @jprdev-paderick. We're looking in to ways to prevent corruption and accidental overwrites. We may add a built-in backup system soon. Hopefully you didn't lose anything too vital.. Hi. The error could be reproduced by simply typing the wrong password and trying to log in.\n. Yep, but still looks like the same case. The error formatting is still a bit ugly. Thanks!\n. Duplicate of #329, so I'll close this one.. Thanks for the contribution @montrueque!\n@sallar Is this how we want it? I guess it should be toggle-able. There are many important functions within the menu that are not accessible otherwise, and we wouldn't want to hinder usability.. We'll try to confirm. In the mean time, this could be fixed (most likely) by having #136 completed.. I'm closing this in favour of #314. Search is currently fuzzy on a single level. The update from #136 will allow deep searching.. Thanks @5k9m. @sallar mentioned that this is related to electron/electron#10521. We're blocked until that gets resolved.. Recent tests on High Sierra have shown that there isn't an issue any longer.. Relates to buttercup/buttercup-mobile#33. Thanks for submitting. We\u2019ll get this fixed shortly :)\n. Yes \ud83d\ude0e\n. Seems there are some extra parameters we can add from the documentation to help with tracking. One such item is _id, which is the unique visitor ID. Let's use the npm package uuid to generate a random ID, store it locally, and use that in the analytics tracking.\nWe should also specify rand as a random number (cachebuster). Check out the docs here.. Hmm.. that\u2019s interesting. Do you see any errors throughout the connection or usage of Dropbox?\n. That\u2019s weird.. Dropbox should save using the same method as the others. Have you by any chance tested a local file or another cloud source?\n. Yeah it definitely seems to be reproducible.

The issue relates to #352.. Great, thanks! Please make sure too that the app is completely closed before reopening.\n. @pelonchasva thanks! We appreciate the quick feedback. Cheers!. Hi @krominet - I'm sorry you feel that way. Please understand that we do indeed only collect anonymous statistics, and at no point is there identifiable or secure data sent via analytics. We believe that we have an important use case for these analytics, so let me try to explain:\nButtercup, as a platform, is something that we want to expand - global usage (people in every country) would be great, and for this we need to know what the uptake is. These launch statistics tell us how many people are launching our applications so we can determine a few things in the near future:\n\nIs this area showing significant growth - should we add additional localisation information?\nIs this greater area in need of more server infrastructure?\nIs there something wrong with this release/design and causing adoption to drop off?\n\nIn our eyes, that's a very good reason to have analytics (of the anonymous kind). You can also see in the code that we don't send anything besides the anonymous statistics, and we do the sending in the NodeJS side away from the archives and other sensitive information. Of course, we value our users' privacy and security over our analytics - and if it seems like it's too much to ask to have these launch counts, we will consider immediate removal of the analytics calls.. Would having the analytics in the app be enough to stop you from using it? Would this be resolvable if the analytics had an opt-out feature? What about opt-in?. The GDPR is for personally identifiable data (and data collected about users), primarily, and is still very-much in its infancy. I do agree that user consent is necessary, and my colleagues and I have been working with this area for quite some time.\nThat being said, your issue did spark some good conversations today. We may indeed be dropping the analytics for now, and may revisit the topic at a later date if required. Rest assured that we won't be adding analytics packages in the future that do not have an opt-in procedure (clarification: analytics off by default).\nThanks for posting and we'll update you with how this goes shortly.. Hi @pelonchasva - Sorry for the inconvenience. This looks to be an issue with race conditions during saving. I can't think of anything else that might cause this. Saving slowly and waiting in between saves might help.\nThat noted, I've created some tasks to address this in a proper way, which may take a couple of days:\n\nbuttercup/buttercup-core#182 - Save debouncing\nbuttercup/buttercup-core#183 - Save events\nbuttercup/buttercup-core#185 - Queue system for saving\n\nAnd thanks for the detailed description!. At this stage it's quite a bit of work to support 32 bit windows, for a number of reasons:\n\nNot straightforward (not possible?) with our build system\nNot easily tested (we don't have windows licenses and are limited to where we can test our windows builds - 32bit is very rare these days)\n\nSo unless we have some easier way to test the 32bit builds (perhaps Azure?), and someone wants to contribute to the build system so that it supports 32bit builds in a clean manner, I don't see us having 32bit support in the near future, if at all, sorry...\nThis might sound a tad harsh and I apologise - but in my opinion there should be little to no reason to be using a 32 bit build of windows. Obviously embedded systems and the like are a different matter, but with only 2 full-time devs we can't support every version of every platform.. Upon having a more detailed discussion with @sallar regarding this, we will try to enable the 32bit build flag. Hopefully we'll end up with out-of-the-box 32bit support. I would still consider marking it as a currently unsupported version in the readme, but of course if demand picks up then who knows, we may add a proper build+test pipeline for it.\nThanks for taking the time to drop us an issue - hopefully we can add support for your platform.. As discussed earlier, this project might be the answer when we finish it: https://github.com/buttercup/channel-queue. @sallar This is missing some eslint fixes (see end of appveyor output).. Good stuff!! \ud83d\udc4d. > when you hold the alt key (like normal windows apps)\nI'm not sure if holding is how it is normally.. At least I've always pressed it once to show the menu \ud83d\ude05. At this stage I think that we won't implement support for Sharefile - They support WebDAV, so theoretically their services can already be used with Buttercup already. We'll be recording planned/pending/blocked cloud storage providers in the roadmap.\nWe may reopen this issue at a later stage when we have more bandwidth, or if there are substantially more requests for Sharefile. Thanks!. All fields require unique names, so we do require users to actually enter names before saving. Perhaps an error message is inappropriate, but saving should be prevented and the user notified somehow that they should enter the field name.\n. What if a user painfully types out a large amount of text and we delete it when saving because it didn\u2019t have a label?\nI would still suggest blocking saving if any part of the form is invalid. Saving while there is invalid data, even by skipping fields, is misleading I feel.\nI think the whole red-highlight kind of style when submitting incomplete forms is a nice way to accomplish this, and isn\u2019t as in-your-face as an error dialog.\n. > We can just ignore that field when both of them (name and value) was empty.\nAh, I understand what you meant.. Yes that definitely sounds correct to me also. I would go as far to say that we could delete that row if it is entirely empty.. Closing as this should be in the website repo. Thanks for letting us know @regoremor!. Where did you see that donate link @regoremor? Can't seem to find it.. Ah.. good catch.\nI would personally prefer \u201cYou haven't added any archives yet. Why not add one?\u201d, as you recommended.. Hi @snhasani - Thanks for posting. You're right, especially in OSX - focus-out does in fact complete the group/folder creation. I would agree that this would be desired behaviour.. Hi @snhasani - I've assigned this to you. You can find the label definitions for Buttercup here (thanks for asking, I just added them).. Thanks @snhasani - I'll let @sallar review. I think it'd be best to hold this for a larger release once merged.. Looks good. Thanks @snhasani!. I guess it should fail silently?. What's your opinion on intro.js @sallar?. Hi @MR-Mostafa - I've moved this issue to its correct location: buttercup/buttercup-importer#23.. Guess we have to get that code signing stuff done for Windows.. it\u2019s been delayed for some time now.. \ud83d\ude10\n. Are you using the Nextcloud archive type? If so, you need only put https://xxxxxx, without the remote.php/webdav section. If you use webdav, however, you would keep that suffix.\nAlso, while I'm asking, are you by any chance using a self-signed SSL cert?. Ok, so you're using a recognised SSL certificate vendor, like Verisign or Geotrust, for example?. Ok, well this is an interesting problem. Could you perhaps try a demo account at https://demo.nextcloud.com? We'll be doing the same to check if there are any issues that have cropped up in say a recent update..\nEDIT: I can at least use the demo nextcloud account on the current Buttercup desktop version. Can you confirm that it works for you?\nEDIT2: If we still can't get it to work, then we have a couple of options. One, you can try to debug a bit further by digging into the code (running the project in dev) as it's trying to connect. Two, you could open up a temporary account on your server that I could debug with (You could share it to me using Keybase, for instance).. Interesting.. Have you considered my other proposals? \ud83d\ude42\n. > What other proposals? \n\nIf we still can't get it to work, then we have a couple of options.

Ok, so using just the webdav component I get the following error, even after you changed the certificates:\n{ FetchError: request to https://address/remote.php/webdav/ failed, reason: unable to verify the first certificate\n    at ClientRequest.<anonymous> (/Users/perry/git/webdav-client/node_modules/node-fetch/index.js:133:11)\n    at emitOne (events.js:115:13)\n    at ClientRequest.emit (events.js:210:7)\n    at TLSSocket.socketErrorListener (_http_client.js:385:9)\n    at emitOne (events.js:115:13)\n    at TLSSocket.emit (events.js:210:7)\n    at emitErrorNT (internal/streams/destroy.js:64:8)\n    at _combinedTickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:138:11)\n    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:180:9)\n  name: 'FetchError',\n  message: 'request to https://address/remote.php/webdav/ failed, reason: unable to verify the first certificate',\n  type: 'system',\n  errno: 'UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE',\n  code: 'UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE' }\nSo for some reason it seems like the certificates aren't accepted by our client. Will keep looking into this.. Thanks for following up @moulip, and as well for the opportunity to debug using your live server. Hopefully this remains a working solution for you, and it's help highlight the fact that we need some kind of SSL bypass in Buttercup (#398).\nAll the best!. Hi @Xavier73 - Thanks for taking an interest in adding support for new features. Often times we'll jump at the chance to have functionality added to Buttercup, but the cloud services are a bit different. They're integrations and as such contribute to the overall image of Buttercup as a brand. In my opinion, Hubic is not as mature as I would have hoped, and the reviews I've read are mixed at best.\nAt this stage I would say that we don't currently want to integrate with Hubic. To clarify this process for future queries, I've created a roadmap document for our cloud services.\nIf Hubic supports a protocol that Buttercup already uses, like WebDAV, I would suggest using that to connect your archives. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this might cause, but I hope that you can understand our caution around these integrations. We have to stand by them and maintain each and every one throughout the life of Buttercup as a platform - and this raises the entry bar to quite a strict level.. Thanks for understanding. I've been discussing with my colleague that there may be a future possibility here using a plugin-like infrastructure, but we don't have bandwidth to dig into that right at this moment.\nAll the best!. Also, this shouldn't be merged until we've had a review of the Spanish and German content \ud83d\ude0a. @ph1p That's awesome, and we appreciate it. As a matter of habit I would personally like all translations (first time) verified by at least 1 other person - it's not a matter of trust but more of habit. I can probably have that done today anyhow \ud83d\ude0a\nOh and thanks again for the hard work! This was a massive task, and we're just being extra careful with it. Because of this work, other translations will be much easier \ud83c\udf89. Also @sallar - Seeing as this PR adds language detection, would it be best to pre-release this to someone running under German/Spanish locale by default?\nAlso, @sallar + @ph1p - Are we able to verify what happens if a property in one language is missing? I was hoping that it might default to English, but I can't see yet from the code what the behaviour might be if a translation is not present in one locale... I've had the German verified. The Spanish may get a PR later today, but I'm happy with it being merged. Thanks @ph1p !. > I'll implement a fallback solution.\nIs that needed? I was just wondering what the behaviour of react-intl was when say a translation exists in English but not in Spanish - Does it fall back automatically?. @sallar @ph1p Seeing as this is already functional, do you think we could do without the fallback? Perhaps @ph1p could add it in a separate pull request?\nI'd love to see this get merged.. I have a feeling that this will open the flood gates on translations \ud83d\ude0d. > I can't find the word Trash\nAh.. well this is more complex. General and Trash are groups - content within the Archive data. These are created as boilerplate items in buttercup-core. I agree that these should be translated - I can add an option to the core for this, but it should be done later imo (not part of this PR).\nTask in core: buttercup/buttercup-core#191. > password generator, this must also be dynamic\nAgreed.. I think we need to figure out a nice way to pass translations around. I guess the generator, being a separate component, should have it's own internationalisation, but should take the current language from the host application (ie. the desktop application in this case).. Hmm.. appveyor is still dying. Issue seems to be with npm. @ph1p would you mind trying to add npm cache verify to the appveyor build script? Before npm install?\nIf that doesn't work, npm cache clean before npm install might fix it.\nEDIT: Just updated it.. let's see how it goes... > This was a stupid idea of mine\nNo such thing! This was a huge chunk of work. We obviously need to update packages anyway.. \ud83d\ude01. Nope! We definitely need this functionality. There is actually already an issue for this: #375..\nThanks @moulip :smile: . Thanks for the PR @ph1p - Unfortunately I don't know if this is the best way to accomplish this fix. It's absolutely a problem, but forcibly filtering out \"invalid\" or empty meta values is perhaps a bit heavy handed and dangerous. It would be best to have some kind of form validation that is executed when clicking save. Errors could be pointed out and saving prevented, if there are issues.. @ph1p Remember to not add to much to the same PR.. Every pull request should target perhaps 1 issue and not try to do too much else. I wouldn't personally add any more translation content because we have to re-verify all of that.\nKeep up the awesome work! \u263a. Nice @ph1p! I'll still let @sallar check the code as this is quite a large update.\nThanks... Thanks @multiservicio !!. Thank you @fmommeja! We really appreciate it. I'll have the translation verified (our practise) and will then merge. . I think that you've got the idea, besides maybe info. In my opinion it'd be best to sort by logical area of the app. Errors are their own thing (all messages), but the other areas of the app are very easily distinguishable:\n\nArchive(s)\nGroups\nEntries\nImporting\nMenus\nContext menu on archives\nWindow menu\nContext menu on entries etc.\nConnections (webdav/dropbox etc.)\nMenu actions (hide, reveal etc.)\nUser actions (Confirm, Cancel, Yes, No etc.)\n. Hey @hugo-cardenas! Welcome. That would be awesome! Let's get through that current PR and you could most definitely take this item :). This is now ready @hugo-cardenas, if you get time. I guess there are already some nested errors, but I think there's a lot that could be categorised. This can obviously be a partial PR due to the large amount of items that may need changing.. > I believe it would be better not to reuse items in different contexts, even though they might happen to contain the same value.\n\n\nit's nicer if you don't risk breaking other things which use the same item\n\nThoroughly agreed!\n\nAre you guys ok with the structure like this?\n\nPerhaps we should discuss that on the PR \ud83d\ude0a. Raising the prio due to the fact that there's no way to \"Check for updates\".. Yes, just saw this:\n\nWhen typing info into a new entry, focus is lost immediately:\n\n\n. I did notice this on 0.23.0 as well, so I'm not sure when it was introduced... ~~It might be to do with the react-intl package and the redux forms. There's a couple of issues hinting towards that.~~\nSeems it was Uglify which was breaking.. we'll switch back to babel minify.. @ph1p That's what we did. Thanks guys!!. Fixed in 0.24.1. Dupe of #410 . Thanks @ph1p - This will obviously need a test at some stage, for the build. The issue was only present in production builds, so I'll let @sallar confirm that this setting functions correctly.. Awesome @RakotStargazer! ~~Though I don't see the locales file.. Did you forget to push it?~~ Nevermind, I saw the other PR. Great!. Depends on #415 . I think this is probably fine to merge then - it's an ultra basic change. I'll merge and will keep an eye on the appveyor tests.. Amazing! Thanks @RakotStargazer @dmmmd \ud83d\ude01. I think this should be solved by adding a couple of features:\n\nTimeout on the fetch/network request (something sane, like 15 seconds)\nLogged error when it fails\nNo error shown to the user. @yasharAyari i18next looks a bit bloated when compared to os-locale. We already have the translation functionality working, all we need is the detection of the current locale on the user's machine.\n\nEDIT: Ah, my colleague just reminded me that i18next is actually an alternate solution to what we use currently, which is react-intl.. Having seen i18next several times we chose react-intl as we felt it was the best fit for Buttercup.. Yeah.. Let's close it unless it occurs again. If it keeps happening I guess we need to consider moving to another CI system. I'm considering self-hosting something if it gets bad (would need to do so for iOS tests too).. Well.. there goes that idea. AppVeyor.stability = null.. Confirmed.. Seems there's a UI glitch here. You're right in that the menu option should not be available. The archive data should always be fine though - At most it should throw an error and no changes be made.. Hi @BlueBeniHD - Can you confirm that you're on the latest version? Please try a full restart of the application and try again, if you wouldn't mind. I can't reproduce this on Mac, so I wonder if what you're experiencing is a windows issue.\nEDIT: Are you filling out the title and value?. @sallar The at u.setMeta seems to be when the meta is getting set.. Perhaps verification is failing here..?. At very least this error message shouldn't appear, so I'm marking this as a bug.. Ok.. Let's see if we can't narrow this down. Could you please walk me through the exact steps you take to reproduce the error?\nA video/gif recording of you recreating the issue would be extremely helpful also.. @BlueBeniHD It's quite late here in Helsinki, so if I don't get a chance to look at this tonight I'll continue first thing.. This is a great idea!. This is already possible on Linux using AppImage, so I'll localise this to only Windows/Mac.. As long as you use node and npm, the code should auto format when you commit it. We both use vscode as our preferred editor, and use prettier for formatting both on the command line and in the editor. I would recommend installing editorconfig as well in whatever editor you use.. This would require config files to be written in the working dir of the app, as well.. No point writing to the system when in portable mode.. Nice work @ph1p \ud83d\udc4c. Thanks @amin3mej - I added the WIP prefix while you're working. Please don't forget to remove it when you're done \ud83d\ude42\nEDIT: We of course need to see how RTL languages work in the interface with this one. This could end up being a bit larger if that's tricky.. Thanks @RakotStargazer - Good observation.\nThis has been mentioned in the original localisation PR comments: Basically the password generator and some other components, are external and need separate localisation support. For instance, I've added a task on the generator here. I'll close this issue as it has to do with the other components.. Hi @ph1p - Thanks again for the huge amount of work. We of course need to check this over and that might take a bit.\nI'm not completely sold on i18next.. and for one the react integration looks non-existent. The {t(..)} insertion into JSX looks quite bland compared to the dedicated JSX components in react-intl. At least I think it would be advantageous for us to wrap it in a JSX component if we're to go with this solution - thoughts @sallar?\nI'll have to have a proper review a bit later. In the future I would recommend starting an issue with a discussion before changing anything to this degree. If a feature takes us in a direction we're not 100% happy with it could end up being rejected that would of course be a massive waste of work. Just a friendly point to ask first if it's a large change like this \ud83d\ude42. @ghostd I do like the way js-lingui works, especially with these items: <Trans id=\"msg.simple\">Hello {name}</Trans>\nI think it's important that the translations in react are:\n\nJSX elements, not JS insertions\nEasy to read and understand without having to jump to the locale file\nShows the default in some easy way\n\nIf we're to stick with i18next or a similar framework, I would recommend using something like the above. I think having the default as the children for the translation element is a very good idea.. @ph1p I would actually hold off on changes at the moment mate.. I think we need to have a bit more of a discussion on this, this week, to see what we want to do.. If you wouldn't mind waiting on a decision, we could choose something and just stick with that. We don't want to waste your valuable time and effort..\nBut hey! This is really exciting.. I'm glad that you've gotten us to where we can make these choices. Let's see how we go. Maybe we start a discussion on Spectrum..\nEDIT: Conversation: https://spectrum.chat/?t=9c0e95b6-3c52-4375-be99-71563f82cd2e. @ph1p @sallar I do like the examples that I saw on their homepage a while back: here. Having the namespaced files is nice imo (errors, menus etc.).. but ultimately not necessary. It seems that it's fine to have just 1 file for the translations as with react-intl.. . Hi @ph1p, I've summarised my points below:\n\n~~I'm not sure that I love the <Translate> component.. Why not use react-i18next's <Trans> component? It'd be nice if we didn't have to invent anything new for this.~~\n~~I think the default text should be a child of the component, not a prop. Passing to defaultText on the Translate component is an antipattern, as some defaults can be long sentences and should be passed as <Translate>This is the default text</Translate>, for example.~~\nI think you've had some really good ideas on the <Translate> component, but I'm still not completely comfortable with how it might look. I'd like something solid that we can use throughout the entire Buttercup stack, something that reads well, but this is still a bit cumbersome. What about ditching the default altogether? We don't really need it as it should fall back to English.. and the default value only serves to complicate the component. Having something like <Trans i18nKey=\"userMessagesUnread\" count={count} /> would be amazing, in my opinion, without the default value (avoids all the complex react object stuff). What do you think? /cc @sallar \nI don't think we should do any namespacing in this PR.. it's already huge \ud83d\ude03 - Let's stick with the single file for now. Maybe something like base.json for a name would be nice.\nI like the folder structure you proposed - It will suit us nicely when we do begin namespacing.\nWhat do you mean by indenting? Such as with the phrase \"But we can also indent the error messages and have only one file.\" ?. @ph1p Just on my last notes - Just wanted to reiterate that in my opinion, it might be simpler having the <Translate> component with no children, like you suggested. Also, it might be easiest there if we have no default specified in code. Relying on the English fallback should be enough for all cases \ud83d\udc4d. Sorry @ph1p still a few points I'd love to get cleared up before merging. Thanks!. > missing translations as an empty string\n\nAh, I meant removing them entirely. My thinking was that if there are more texts added in the future that the default will be that some items will not be set in all language files. We can of course remove these too, you don't need to do it now. Will take a look myself tomorrow.. > when I take a look at all translations and everything is filled out\nYes but when someone adds new functionality, I don't think it's fair to ask them to add the entries to all language files. Like react-intl, the items should be added to the base/default language and not to the others. The missing translations should be provided by running a CLI application or the like..\nI think removing them is best as this will most likely be how we move forward with new features. Having empty entries I feel is still a bit misleading... Well I'm not so familiar with i18next. If it creates blank entries automatically, then we probably want to do whatever the default is. Something that devs don't need to think about if they're adding an unrelated feature. That's kinda what I'm getting at \ud83d\ude05. But let's go with what you have now.. this is fine. Thanks again!. Thanks @matteocrippa! \nJust one small thing: We need it to be hooked up in the i18n index here. Once you've connected that we can proceed.\nI'll also get the translation cross-checked, as is our practise.. Thanks again @matteocrippa! I'll merge now.. Sorry to hear that.. What happens if you save again using the iOS app (make a change)? Does it allow you to open it then on either desktop?. It's possible that there was some error during writing, but I've tried and have not been able to reproduce this. Please let us know if it occurs again, and we can reopen this.\nIf it's a reoccurring problem, perhaps you could make a sample archive and then send it to us when it breaks.. Otherwise, thanks for posting!. Hello again @Akimace - Do you mean like a tray icon? Like this:\n\n. Not currently no.. But it's something we may want to explore for Windows/Linux users.. @sallar I guess it would have to operate very similarly to the mac one. Mac runs as a daemon when closed unless it's forced to close. That allows for quick start up and I presume continual execution in the background even when no windows are shown.\nOn windows you could have the same, plus a context menu that could potentially look like:\n\nShow Buttercup\nLock all archives\nQuit. Agreed @sallar - Let's drop this for now. Thanks!. Made some comments @hugo-cardenas, in the way of a review. Easier to chat about the items that way \ud83d\ude01. @hugo-cardenas Looking good!. > I synced them, meaning that I added all the missing entries with the english value to each of the other languages, but now different people should review those again and translate them.\n\n\nI think the best would be to initially always add them to all the other languages even if just in english\n\nWe shouldn't set items to English by default.. The intention is that they should always be unset if not translated. Setting them to English makes it unclear as to what should be translated. There are also CLI tools that help identify what items need translating, and these would effectively not work if we set all items to English by default. The translation system will automatically default to English if an item is not found in the current locale.\nYou're not the first person to suggest this, so maybe we have to add this to our docs \ud83d\ude0a - Apologies for the confusion there.. I added some docs about this for future contributions: #448. react-intl (our previous system) and i18next (our current system) both support the same behaviour: Try to fetch the localisation from the current locale, and if it's not there, get it from the base locale (en.json).. I agree on adding the command. We can add it to the package.json.. I\u2019ll try to find it from another PR I saw it in. It\u2019s a specific tool for use with the i18n package we use.\n. @hugo-cardenas I really like the nesting you've done.. It's good from my perspective if you continue like that. @sallar ?. Good work @hugo-cardenas! Thanks so much for pushing through on this.. it was quite a fiddly task. I'll defer to @sallar to merge once he gives it a quick check (he's definitely more familiar with this project).. Agreed @jgtoriginal, that's what I meant by not going overboard.\nThe 2FA thing is not related in my opinion - 2FA requires a server and an account. This is something that our upcoming service will provide, but only for people wanting a hosted account and archive. Users may still opt to use Buttercup in the current standalone fashion (remaining completely detached from any central service). I definitely agree that two factor is the way to go for a more secure platform overall.. Good idea.. thanks @darsain, @jgtoriginal. I'll close this in favour of #531.. Absolutely @hugo-cardenas - But I would suggest that we take the cleanest route here. I've used rewire before and to be honest it's a bit of a pain to use. It also uses a bit of its own magic to overwrite values in-script which doesn't work for every declaration type - for these reasons and more I'd prefer not to use it.\nIdeally we'd pass dependencies into functions which really need testing, but this is untidy and obviously doesn't test all of the branches. Whatever we do in the end will still be a sacrifice but as long as we cover the most important areas... @hugo-cardenas Having an extra file for the wiring is a huge amount of overhead though.. The mobile app has 10s of modules and the browser extension possibly over a hundred by now.. If we adopted such a pattern the file overhead would be bonkers.\nI agree that we can give a little in terms of coding style to make testing easier, but that approach sounds a bit drastic imo.\nWebpack has a loader called inject-loader which allows for overwriting imported items. This helps in most cases where modules don't rely too much on internal functions (it can't rewrite functions within the same module file). For those, it's better to look at the test in the following way imo: You're testing the module, and thereby testing what methods it exposes.. if a method cannot be mocked within the module, test the items that use it and treat it as embedded functionality (as if it were in the function you're currently testing).\nUsing inject-loader might work well for this as we already use webpack. It won't help with the node side of things though.. More on this, due to the fact that I'm encountering the same thing in browser extension right now, core-dependencies (browser/electron etc.) should be moved into a separate module so using something like inject-loader can easily help mock those core methods.. Issue was during the autoupdate. Will watch for further problems.. I was able to reproduce this while I was back in Australia for Christmas. My server is in Helsinki so the latency was quite high compared to usual. I would add new items to a credential (new meta), save the changes and then immediately close.\nThe app closes straight away (no saving message), and the changes are not written to the remote.. Not 100% sure @sallar.. I'll try again on VPN shortly.. Ok, so this is still very much present.. I can confirm that it happens 100% of the time using a Dropbox archive, for example:\n. Ok so the Dropbox example has more far-reaching consequences. I can reproduce the credentials not saving locally by using the following steps:\n\nOpen dropbox archive\nCreate entry\nAfter clicking save, close window immediately\nOpen bcup again\nOpen file archive (local)\nAdd new entry\nIt never saves (Closing the whole app at this stage results in the image below)\n\n\n/cc @sallar . Thanks @hugo-cardenas - I'll review in a bit. On a side node, iconographer is out with your changes - version 0.2.0.. Some quick points @hugo-cardenas.. Looks amazing!. > encode/decode in Iconographer's StorageInterface\nThe encoding overrides (optional) configure how the content is processed before reading and writing the icons in storage. It defaults to using buffers, which is fine for files in this case.\n\nThis was just a temporary hack\n\nI'd say this is pretty neat. I might ask that you put the base64 in a constant first, before inserting it into the string, but other than that it looks fine to me. Might be that libraries in npm that serve this purpose even do the same :). @sallar No the image type can be anything.. For instance:\n\nBut it doesn't matter. Binary data is binary data, and base64 is base64.. Browsers (Chrome) will understand it when rendered as a CSS data URI, providing the icon is in a format that the browser would use anyway (guaranteed seeing as we fetched it from their webpage)..\nEDIT: Tldr; it's fine that we write, read and convert it to base64 as it is :). @sallar Mime type is not needed here, and would be extraneous effort for nothing. The headers in the data tell the browser what format it is.. we're literally storing a blob of data. \nEDIT: Ah I see what you mean.. one sec. Ok.. after all that misunderstanding (sorry guys), I think i have a nicer way. Perhaps we merge this and I could make a new PR though?. It could even be on hover, for instance.. there are a variety of options for this.. > Asking for master password when trying to unhide would be preferred though \ud83e\udd13\nI think that this would be overkill.. You've already unlocked the archive.. no point in unlocking something else a second time.\nThis feature would be great for obscuring sensitive details such as passwords. When autolock is implemented archives will be even more safe. That and the fact that the user could just copy the password out without needing to enter the master password again.\nIt should be assumed that if the archive is unlocked, it is currently being used by the intended user. It is definitely not intended to be unlocked for other people to see \ud83d\ude0a. This could be released with a larger update perhaps.. Hi @michaelcurry - This is interesting. I can currently open the dialog just fine:\n\n(After selecting 1password:)\n\nDo you have an archive unlocked while trying this?. ~~What about even changing the \"Import\" label to \"Import into existing archive\"?~~\nActually that does make sense.. if the final box showed, greyed out, \"No available archives\" or something... Just need to fix those tests :). Looks good!. This will require significant changes to the platform, but is doable. It'll need an attribute added to the core. It'll probably need the config library to be finished and integrated first.. Not yet sorry @codesmaker - There are many more higher-prio tasks before this one I'm afraid. It'll require that config library to be finished, which I'll hopefully get time for soon.. @pft Yes I think you\u2019re right - thanks!. Hi @GabrielCoelho! Thanks for creating an issue for this. We'd be keen to help you get this addition into the application.\nI think the best way from here would be to actually create a PR with your changes which we could review and test. This way we can find what the issue may be a lot faster, and you can see first hand what's needed to get it into the desktop application.\nHow does that sound?. So @hugo-cardenas & @sallar - This is what I use in the browser extension for processing blobs. I presume that it's most likely a blob seeing as the icon is processed in the front-end (so it seems), so it should work fine. FileReader is available in chrome.. Ok so I updated this.. turns out that FileReader with blobs is the right way to go, but we should write the result straight to the file cache. This data can be then used as is, because it contains the correct data URI when being processed by the FileReader.. Yeah we were thinking that\ud83d\ude0a\n. @sallar @hugo-cardenas Ok it seems that iconographer wasn't really 100% for show time, so I'm going to take it out of master.. @crazypingoo94 The next step here is to test this issue ourselves, if you're unable to debug it further.\nI'm contactable on keybase as perrymitchell - You could create us a limited and temporary account on your nextcloud system that we could test with. If you do decide to do this, remember not to share the credentials here (only on keybase).. Haven't heard anything from you regarding the possibility to have a test account @crazypingoo94 - Any chance you might be amenable on this front? \ud83d\ude0a. I walked through the setup with @crazypingoo94 privately, and even tested it myself. It worked for me with his account, but we weren't able to figure out why it wasn't working for him. @crazypingoo94 is it still not working with the latest version?. Closing due to inactivity. We can reopen if the issue persists.. Looks good to me @sallar!. > 6193359#diff-32607347f8126e6534ebc7ebaec4853dL19 removes 7zip-bin-linux\nWell, it's removed from the package-lock, which is updated upon each execution of npm install. There was no actual removal within package.json it seems (at least not on that commit in which it changed). Perhaps it was removed as a dependency by some other library we use? I couldn't see any using it there though.. I can confirm that I get this issue as well:\n\nUnhandled Promise Rejection\nVError: Failed removing sources: Source not found for ID\n    at file:///Applications/Buttercup.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar/dist/main.bundle.js:6:766235\n    at <anonymous>\nThis occurred when I tried removing a slightly older archive. It seems to be that they're out of sync - The records on the Desktop side, compared to those in the ArchiveManager.. @sallar @umutkacar I've updated the details of this issue to make it a feature.. This could be tested locally before release :). @sallar I don't see why not! \ud83d\ude0a. @moulip There are several linux install methods available:\n\ndeb/rpm: Packages which are executed by the OS' package manager\nAppImage: Executable installer compatible with most Linux flavours (sometimes needs to be run from CLI)\nSnap: Self-proclaimed universal linux packages. Currently neither of us have access to a Fedora machine, and have not had time to make a virtual machine to test this. We'd appreciate any help the community can provide in debugging this. If this is an issue with the packager we use we can make the necessary changes once we know what's causing the issue.. Thanks for the dump @eldragon87. Unfortunately python traces don't help much right now, as the whole library is configured with JS, but perhaps it might when we start digging into this. I'll try to get a Fedora machine up today.. Tested on a new Fedora 27 VM today and was able to reproduce. Tried both dnf and rpm for installs, both failed with the tag number mismatch error (dnf was much more verbose like @eldragon87 pointed out).\n\nIt looks like this is a somewhat common error, and I'm wondering if it has to do with how electron-builder creates the rpm (/cc @sallar). I wonder if it might be worthwhile using a separate rpm builder for rpm packages..\nEDIT: Perhaps entering all possible properties detailed in the electron-builder docs would be a good starting point.. @hidekiss @eldragon87 I was able to install the AppImage file easily on Fedora 27, so I would recommend going that route:\n\nDownload the AppImage and run chmod +x buttercup.AppImage (obviously with the correct filename). Then just run it: ./buttercup.AppImage. Say yes to integrating and it'll start up quite quickly.. > But I cloned the repo, rebuild the RPM package and I was able to install the package.\n@RaboliotTheGreat what system did you build on? We build on Mac, so I wonder if that has anything to do with it.. I doubt it, but it could be a system dependency different between yours and ours.. > you may need to build the package on the targeted platform\nIt seems like this didn't help you much though, right? I mean, you still had heaps of dependency issues. We've always built the linux binaries on Mac without issue before.. I guess either we haven't properly tested RPM builds before or there's been some kind of regression.\nI'd prefer not to resort to building on the native platforms as that's a lot of work for a single release. If we can build Windows binaries on Mac (which currently work), I would definitely expect Linux ones to work.\nI think we should still switch to another package to build RPM files...\nThanks for the tests done on Fedora @RaboliotTheGrey!. @RaboliotTheGrey Are you saying that you were able to install the rpm build?\n500 was the issue regarding the icon. It's been addressed in 9645ba7000a39d0f61fc5e7b377845d591df108a, which will be released soon.. No problem! The rpm issue is quite strange. Thanks for checking into it.\nNew release with the icons fix should be out soon. Installing via AppImage or Snap is recommended until rpm builds are fixed.. Please watch your tone @tiaga.. No need for that kind of attitude here.\nWe don't have attachment support because it hasn't been developed yet. I think it's definitely a must-have feature but we haven't yet landed on a way to implement it in a way that is:\n 1. Future proof (so we don't support an undesirable system)\n 2. Well performing (doesn't decrease archive decryption speed)\n 3. Secure\nWhen we have such an implementation, it must first be developed in the core library before being supported here.. I don't actually feel that there's a speed issue at all currently. It seems that there was in the browser extension, but the desktop app I feel handles the crypto stuff quite quickly. Thoughts @sallar?. Seems like all the docs point to it giving a performance increase in most cases, if the render function is pure.. sounds nice at least! \ud83d\ude01. Could it be a network issue perhaps? I'm able to reach that screen on all of my computers:\n\nCould you try on another network/machine possibly @numb95?. @numb95 Have you had a chance to test on another device at all?. I'm closing this due to inactivity and the current inability to reproduce the issue. We can reopen if necessary.. I don't recall where the logs were stored - @sallar? Maybe we could add it to the readme too after this \ud83d\ude0a. @mannp Are you able to check the logs regarding this issue? Really sorry about the delay.. We currently use Electron to build our apps - We don't have, to my knowledge, direct control over the built artifacts. The best we can do at this stage is to sign the executable and installer. I believe this should be resolved once that's been done. All subject to time and costs of course.. Happy to receive help on this. We don\u2019t currently have the time nor experience to check this out. Happy to work with someone on it of course... @n8v8R I think that's a cheap shot.. You're the only person so far to have mentioned this issue, and it's still obscure enough that we haven't ranked it as a higher prio.\n\nThe other statement about experience is quite frank but honest at least but a bit shocking all the same, for a password handling app not implementing Address Space Layout Randomization.\n\nThe funny thing is many people phrase their disappointment like this.. that they're surprised we don't implement feature A or security requirement B. Don't get me wrong, we want all of this.. And we'd be only too happy for our software to be as compliant, secure and stable as possible. But in terms of most important to least important things we need to add, I still don't see ASLR as being anywhere near the start of that list. There are numerous other security precautions we should take before even considering it - such as the auto-locking of all archives on every device, or the encryption stability on mobile..\nHopefully you can understand that our time is mega limited and we need to take all advice with a grain of salt. If something is getting a bit more attention or initial research into the problem reveals that it is critical, we'll normally take it sooner. But again this all boils down to the fact that we simply cannot build everything on Buttercup.. It's open source so people can help us do that.\n\nBC is the sole app that has this issue\n\nI highly doubt this - for instance.... @n8v8R I'll reach out on the issue to see what others think on the matter, but at this early stage I'd guess this issue is with Electron, the foundation. If this is the case then we simply can't do anything about the issue for now.. I'll keep this open as we want a resolution.. @n8v8R This is getting rediculous. I\u2019ve already admitted to not being familiar with ASLR, and have explained numerous times that right now, this has not been a priority for us. I\u2019m not going to go through why again.\nThere have been other security related items that have taken precedence, and on top of that, Windows is currently not the primary system we target or test on. We do understand that the majority of our users will be on Windows, but obviously very few have ASLR enabled. Windows will take focus when we have more devs on board.\nYour assuming and condescending attitude has definitely put us off, as well. I would suggest that you leave this be now, unless you have something to offer in terms of fixing the issue or linking an implementation or resolution. We appreciate the initial report and your support for the feature. If you continue to debate our legitimacy or priorities I\u2019ll unfortunately have to block your account on our repositories. . Confirmed that overriding the only ASLR setting that appears to be off by default (windows 10), the issue occurs immediately:\n\nLodged an issue first on Electron builder: electron-userland/electron-builder#3188. Ok, I think I cracked it. Seems that the build environment plays a part in the problem here. Our binaries are built on Mac for Mac, Linux and Windows. Mac and Linux are easy obviously.. the build systems are of course radically different but there doesn't seem to be any incompatibilities. Building Windows binaries on a Mac startled me when I first heard of it, but it seems like NSIS does a good job and we hadn't noticed any problems with Buttercup.\nI did however build a new installer (Buttercup 1.9.0) on  Windows and installed that. It worked under ASLR immediately!\nSo whatever the issue is, it's something to do with the NSIS builder on Linux. I'll file an issue there, but for now it seems like we need to build windows installers on Windows only.\nUpdated the existing issue: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/3188. Quick update: The issue seems to be with one or some of the signing tools used by Electron builder. We're working with that team to debug the problem.. Blocked by this issue: buttercup/buttercup-importer#16. I updated the title as Enpass is not officially supported, so it can't really be categorised as a bug.. \ud83d\udc4d. Still waiting on those tests \ud83d\ude35. @sallar Good question! But it's throwing an error in Buttercup \ud83d\ude05\nEDIT: It's missing a dylib in Shipit. At this point I'd love to suggest bining shipit and moving to a more stable update mechanism. Telegram updates wonderfully, so based on that a simple idea could be:\n * Prompt the user for updating, telling that there is a new version\n * Disable hiding prompts (we want them to update eventually)\n * When they update, then the download is started. Well it\u2019s tricky. Right now the auto update doesn\u2019t work at all for Linux, so it\u2019s only Mac and Windows. I do like the auto update functionality.. we could just implement it ourselves even:\n\nCheck for update\nPrompt user\nDownload .exe/.dmg/.deb\nExecute file\n\nObviously Mac is more complicated because we need to overwrite an app file. Windows and Linux could probably just install over the top?\nWe could also use a 3rd party installer and updated for our app instead of the electron one.. we don\u2019t necessarily need it integrated. Maybe we need to ponder on this a bit \ud83e\uddd0. Agreed. Errors or not, I personally feel that the auto update functionality is a bit risky - downloading 50-60 mb in the background is tricky and uses a bit of data. Would be good to have the ability to postpone it to next launch... Hi @cstackpole,\nFirst of all, Buttercup only makes network connections (currently) for the following items:\n * To Github for checking if there's an update\n * To the websites stored to find if there is a favicon available\nNo personal information is sent with any request. We do look for icons at the domains that you've stored, yes.\nI'm sorry if this functionality makes you feel less secure - we wouldn't have implemented it if we felt there was a risk of exposure - but this way has been terribly effective in producing icons without needing loads of infrastructure behind us to support such a small feature.\nHaving a dedicated server to query for icons does sound appealing, and is probably something we'll look into in the coming weeks.\nEDIT: Configuration & Settings per user is also something we've had planned, but just not the bandwidth to complete. This could be disabled there as well, if it were integrated.. I agree and believe that your expectations are reasonable @cstackpole - I've created buttercup/roadmap#2 in light of this discussion. Thanks.. Depends on #140 . > We can understand that you are beginner in security and privacy\nNot a beginner, no.\n\nmaybe you only intend this app for personal use\n\nNo, we intend it to be used in businesses as well.\n\nThis isn't a chat app going to gravatar -- it's a password manager unexpectedly reaching out to banking websites, health insurance websites, internal company resources, etc.\n\nWe're aware of this and the security implications. We have stated several times that we're going to change this. We don't have time to address every single issue immediately. We'll definitely clean this up when we can - all contributions are appreciated and we'd hope that others might lend a hand with such items.\nEDIT: Maybe in the mean time we could start by requesting icons only from the root domain. Next (better) step would be to use some kind of lookup without making requests from the users machine to the service.. > Do you want to download the icon for this url? YES | NO\n@jenstornell I understand the thought behind this, but it might be troublesome if you have many 10s or hundreds of entries.. @Ricain The new icon library is a transitional upgrade.. so there's a collection of some more popular sites' icons stored locally, and that's it. No requests, so security implications. We'll upgrade it later to provide a more flexible system of icon management - one that will most likely request them from our servers (no logs kept).\n@julianpoemp Currently no, but that's a great idea!. Thanks @darsain - Nice effort getting this together!\nI can also confirm that it freezes, but it seems that it's just the renderer/UI part that dies. All of the menus are still responsive. I'll test in our icon downloader.. Turns out that the icon from ello.co is only 3 bytes in length:\n01 02 03\nOr AQID in base64..\nUsing the library that we currently have to detect image types, I wonder if it's dying on such an item?\nEDIT: Actually, something more weird is going on. Iconographer is breaking and freezing in tests requesting from that domain.. I'll debug further.. I can confirm that this works for me in master, after updating iconographer:\n\n. Thanks @sallar !\nI can confirm that this is fixed:\n\n. @pelonchasva @toniobido This may be due to some issue with localstorage within the app. What happens if you delete the duplicates?\nI tried myself entering the wrong password, but I can't seem to reproduce the problem.. No problem @pelonchasva - Did you try deleting them?. @nickbe Absolutely! I would say that the automatic icons should be the base functionality and custom icons be a feature. It's just that storing data in vault files is a tricky concept and we're not sure how that should be done right now.. Also not working in 1.2.2 / 1.3.0. Search relates to #314 . Only screen position is not implemented currently.. Hi @darsain - Thanks for going through all of this!\nWith regards to the copying fields by clicking, I'm not sure that this makes so much sense. For instance, I frequently copy only a portion of the field value. Having an auto-copy feature would hinder that and be less obvious from a UX perspective.\nI'm also not completely convinced that hiding the buttons is so bad in terms of UX. It hides clutter (which is bad UX) and you instantly learn about them when you hover one field. If they were all visible the interface would look horrible as well, imho.\nOn the custom fields divider, I tend to somewhat agree with your sentiment there. We could just have them altogether, but I wouldn't make the username/password removable. In place of that, I would hope that we get #540 implemented so that some entry types that don't need those fields can hide them.. Sorry everyone - I'm going to close this issue as it's going to be too hard to follow.\nPlease create separate issues if you wish to push any particular points forward. Feel free to copy content as it suits. Thanks!. Great idea @darsain - I completely agree with the idea of having a more monospace-friendly Note type. A password type also sounds good - to compliment the default username/password login type.. Thanks @icetee - We just need to cross-check your translation before accepting.. @sallar Could you give this a once over to make sure all the files are in place? Otherwise I can't see any issues with merging this \ud83d\ude0a. This looks amazing! I love the idea.\nFor me I think it'd be best to use the EntryFinder code in the core, as used here in the browser extension.. > If it'll eventually be able to search among all open databases, make it configurable please. Searching all of them would mean unwanted noise and inconsistency in search results for me.\nI somewhat agree here. I don't think this will be an issue for this PR, and could definitely be discussed as a separate issue.\n\nDon't make the search box jump up and down trying to center it vertically as the results are being populated. It's chaotic. Position it statically towards the top and expand results below.\n\nI like this idea.. The original box did look a bit cleaner... ;). @ph1p I think you've already done an amazing job! These are but suggestions. Your first approach was just really net imho. Keep up the great work - we can't wait to merge this as a feature!. @ph1p So could you walk us through the behaviour?\n - What is the default behaviour?\n - Is the tray icon switchable?\n - What do you mean by the following:\n\nIn development all is good, but in production something went wrong and I don't know why :/. @sallar If we choose to move this on through, what do you think about altering the tray behaviour on mac to match windows/linux? Currently mac is the odd one out - if we have a switch, having the tray icon disabled I would expect the mac application to fully quit when closing the last window.. but currently only windows & linux do that.. Hmm.. not sure how much I love the icon on windows (the lock looks amazing on Mac).. The green lock icon by itself seems a bit on the dull side. @sallar what would you think about using our actual icon for windows?\n\nEDIT: And linux as well, obviously... >  actual square icon\n@sallar Did you mean the rounded corners one, or the actual square icon? :smile: . @ph1p That looks much better imo.. the rounded-corners icon. Good stuff.\nSo, to confirm that the behaviour is as intended, could you ensure that this is how it's running now? So at least we're all on the same page (correct me if I've made a mistake):\nOn windows + linux\n\nIf the tray icon is disabled:\nClosing the window exits the application\nIf the tray icon is enabled:\nClosing the window closes only the window selected (the tray icon remains)\n\nOn mac\n\nClosing the window leaves the app active in the background (existing behaviour). Also, should we add another button to the menu to simply open Buttercup? @sallar @ph1p ?. @ph1p I personally agree on that point.. I like how the Docker menu works -> both clicks open the menu. Very simple! @sallar?. > This is pretty useless and non-standard\n\n@darsain I disagree - almost all of my tray applications do this (the same for both clicks), including ownCloud, Docker, Keybase and F.lux. I think it's much easier that you don't have to remember specific behaviour for every tray application. Seems the other apps have the same idea.\n\nHad to look for the toggle a bit, since none calls the tray \"menubar\".\n\nThis is pretty minor imo, but we're considering forcing the tray icon feature for everyone. Not sure why we might want 2 modes of operation for the future. We're considering updating this, but haven't decided yet.. @sallar Looks good to me!. Sure.. let\u2019s take this after the other work perhaps? \ud83d\ude01. Why would you require a filter box for entries when there\u2019s a global search? I can\u2019t see why you\u2019d need to filter only the currently displayed entries... @mustii82 I agree that only a shortcut would be bad, but we also have a menu item:\n\nI can't see any reason to have a filter box for entries unfortunately. The fact that we support nested groups mean that Buttercup archives can have more depth in terms of sorting and organising. Users don't have to force their 10s or 100s of entries into one large folder. Having them spread out like this means that global search is definitely the more effective mode of searching, if compared to filtering items in the current folder only.\nDue to our application design and what I just mentioned, I don't think we'll be bringing back the entries filter box, sorry.. @mustii82 I think some things are more widely known.. For instance, I would expect the average user to know:\n\nShortcuts for Copying things\nShortcuts for Pasting things\nShortcuts for Cutting things\nShortcuts for Finding things\n\nAnd so finding things using a hotkey should be second-nature to most. On top of that, we have a button in the menu. I hear that you're pushing the quick-access angle here, but I would argue that we don't need several ways to \"quick\" access (assuming a single action equates to \"quick\") the same functionality. You go once into the menu to search, discover that you can use the hotkey which is standard, and then you use the hotkey from then on out. \nIf you choose to avoid using the hotkey, for whatever reason, I don't feel that a shortcut button would really help the situation... At least not right now in this current design.\nWho knows, we may bring back some kind of search button in a future design, but we don't currently see a need for one now.. That looks strange.. ENOENT makes it sound like either the file wasn\u2019t written, or it was deleted instantly. . I don\u2019t think it would be that unfortunately.. enoent is only for missing paths.. Hmm. . @moulip Can you please confirm if the file is actually there?\nEDIT: Obviously while running the update process again.. :). @moulip The AppImage files are stored in /tmp so that they are cleaned up automatically. When you restart, /tmp should always be cleared, so that's expected behaviour. The AppImage file is not required after installation, as the program runs from your system then.\nI'm sorry that you've been experiencing these issues. Unfortunately there won't be any auto updates on .deb currently.. Closing this due to inactivity. If this becomes a blocker or we're able to reproduce it, we can of course reopen.. Let's do the same for all platforms too.. No need for the double click or different configurations per platform.. Good idea.. Those options sound good, but this should be handled by a proper settings interface, not just writing everything to storage like we're doing now. So for that, I'm going to block this by #140.. @Zjemm There should be a context menu in the application window to show the tray icon, if I remember correctly. I don\u2019t configure this myself usually.. What do you mean by \u201cbudgie\u201d desktop? Maybe you could debug it in the dev environment. You\u2019d need to install Nodejs 8 or 10, clone the repo and open 2 terminals. In one run \u201cnpm run start:renderer\u201d and in the other \u201cnpm run start:main\u201d. You\u2019d have to do some tweaking with the code to see why it doesn\u2019t show..\n. Understandable if the dev environment doesn\u2019t sound comfortable. Let us know some more details about your system to see what the problem may be... I'm wondering if it's something to do with the AppImage build. AppImage is an executable, and not perfectly designed for installing applications. Some features like updating are not available with this installation method - Perhaps the persistence of the app, along with the tray icon, simply doesn't function properly.\n@sallar do you know where the app is extracted to? It could be tmp or something I guess. Somewhere incompatible with this feature... Hi @mustii82 - Please make sure to open issues in the correct repository. This repo is only for the desktop application - The mobile app is in this repo. Thanks.. There is already an issue for this on the browser extension repo: buttercup/buttercup-browser-extension#105. The icons go away when exiting the application using the \"Quit\" button on the new icon (the old icon does not work at all with any menu item).. This is still the case on version 1.10. This is also present on Windows... Hi @gschoenberger - Sorry about the delay.\nI've reproduced this as well - Though it occurred for me after locking the file (after changing the password). I'll have a look at it shortly... Ok, I found the issue. The desktop app is using some new functionality to improve the archive management, which had a bug. The archive source (after having the password changed) was running into a queue deadlock when trying to serialise the source \ud83d\ude35.\nIt's being fixed in core now, with a release coming soon.. This should be released tomorrow (Friday).. @sallar @gschoenberger Yes, it should work like that, but can't guarantee. It was a mix up in terms of the written content - the content itself should not get corrupted.\nThanks for reporting @gschoenberger!. This cleared up.. What do you think @sallar? This has been brought up earlier, and now thinking about it, I'm definitely starting to like it as it makes moving to the entry type facades a bit easier... I would think that showing it altogether, personally, would make it a bit tidier. This is more from the perspective that when we have custom field layouts supported via facades, it\u2019ll be necessary to group them all anyway.\nRight now some fields like username and password cannot be removed so it makes sense that they\u2019re at the top and custom fields below. When we use facades the built in facade properties won\u2019t be removable so they\u2019ll also probably be at the top... > that sound horrible.\nI disagree - and please, tone it down a little. We're not trying to make an uber strict interface, but we need to be mindful of the current architecture and our plans on what we expect users to want out of an interface.\n\nI want to use buttercup to also store license keys, GPG keys, and similar stuff. For this I need only title, maybe username, and license/key field\n\nWe plan to have facades around all of these. Having mandatory fields that cannot be removed (of course they can be empty) helps keep expected data mapped to their respective property (eg. A credit card may or may not have a CCV number, but the field should remain so that it's a visual entry).\n\nIt's already bad that I can't remove name & password fields which will be useless and irrelevant with this kind of item\n\nWhich is relevant to what I mentioned:\n\nRight now some fields like username and password cannot be removed\n\nWhich may make for a confusing idea, but it's been explained previously. Right now they're mandatory, but when we implement facades they'll be present only in items that require them. The facades are designed to make the interface more flexible, not less.\n\ntake a license key for Sublime Text as an example. It needs title, username, and key fields\nso there would be a divider between username and key\n\nThat's what this task would fix, as a first point of call. The facades to make for more types of entries will come with #540.. To better communicate what this will change:\n\nRemove the divider between mandatory and custom fields\n\nAnd what #540 will change:\n\nHide Username/Password required fields, along with some custom fields, under a facade\nEntries of certain types will only show the fields relevant to them\nIf a user creates a key entry, it may be just a title and the key data field by default, for example\nCustom fields can be added later by the user\nAllow basic entry types like Notes, for example, or contact details (phone number, email etc.). I'll close this issue in favour of #540, which will most likely change the design making this issue irrelevant. This topic was more of a UI nice-to-have, and very much subject to opinion.. It looks like it's running stuff from the temp folder.. and may have something to do with the update on Linux. The AppImage way might still be a bit broken.. not sure.. The error does not occur for me when opening buttercup from the tray icon. It's only regular launches that show it.. Hi @ArtexJay - Unfortunately Bitwarden isn't yet supported. This should be added to the importer project first. Thanks.. I've added an issue for this: buttercup/buttercup-importer#30. Updating shouldn\u2019t be possible on the deb file installation, due to issues.. \ud83e\udd14. No problem! We do need to fix that somehow. You can uninstall the deb version and use the .AppImage version, which supports updating.\n\nClosing in favour of #586. This is really cool @joachimschmidt557 - Thanks for taking care of this.. Hi @AwesomeTech10 - As Lastpass and 1Password are our competitors, we won't be offering integrations for working with them. We'd like to offer a platform superior to theirs.\nWe do provide import support for them, however, so you can easily switch from their platform to ours.\nThanks!. Woot! \ud83c\udf89. Moved to the appropriate repo.. @sunjam How do you mean? TOTPs are used with services that provide authentication endpoints that use these (often alongside a username and password). Are you suggesting for Buttercup to have implemented a TOPTP client that can read these like the Google Authenticator app?. Well I've been lucky enough to have had several discussions since then with some terribly smart people regarding OTP implementations. It's still tricky for myself as I don't really use any OTP services currently (usually password+2FA only). That being said it's a strongly-requested feature from our users and we recognise the importance of it.\nStill hoping someone might want to contribute it to the core but otherwise we'd be able to get to it eventually.. Looks good! This should first be added to buttercup/datasources.. Added to our roadmap. It should be added to the core library after an issue and discussion takes place there (or in the datasources repo).. Hi @eldy - Thanks for the detailed report. Unfortunately we need more information - we use Buttercup daily on several different webdav connections which all work, some of which are secured using letsencrypt.\nCould you perhaps check that your SSL cert is valid? Tools like this should work just fine. Usually these issues are to do with some kind of custom configuration or setup with the server or certificate.. I'm going to close this issue for now, as we're not able to deal with all the connection issues that arise with so many different platforms & SSL configurations. I've created a contribution and issues guide which details some basic pointers when creating issues, and we'll start to enforce these from now on.\nIf a bug is confirmed we can of course re-open the issue, and would be happy to patch it in such a case. Thank you!. Very interesting, thanks for reporting! Unfortunately this might go the same way as the other issue, and require someone to reproduce it in development.\n@jdrch What version windows are you running? Perhaps you could share your PC details to get us started... Ah sorry! Missed that..\n. > it is not good that the developer appears a bit ignorant about the (security) capabilities of Electron and potential implications of the app.\n@n8v8R Look, I'm not familiar with every possible platform feature on Windows Mac and Linux. I understand what we're building, and rely on the help of the community and other developers to see us through to the best possible implementation. I posted in Reddit seeking help as it was the right thing to do when I don't personally have experience with ASLR. \nThese comments are not helpful, and I'd kindly request that you keep on topic and refrain from making these kinds of remarks.\n\nand thus I would surprise me if it is a matter of Electron rather than implementation.\n\nI don't currently see how it could be us, especially if other, non-related apps are experiencing the same issue. That being said, we'll take both possibilities into account.\n\nThe way this is being handled, notwithstanding being present in the first place, does not inspire trust in BC - the app supposedly handling passwords.\n\nYou seem to miss the point, repeatedly. We're 2 people.. there are other responsibilities in this project, and in our lives, that require our attention ahead of this issue. We will handle it in due time. If you can not help, or will not help, then please, refrain from commenting further on the topic.. This does appear to be a dupe of #502, so I'll close this in favour.. Unfortunately not much. You can\u2019t exactly share your archive with us. If you make a change and save it on mobile, does it then work on desktop?. Encryption is the same - one of the features is interchangeable archives between apps.\nThis most likely is a reoccurring issue we have with encryption on mobile devices (a bug). Unfortunately there is no quick fix. We\u2019ll be migrating to AES-GCM encryption in the coming months, and this is expected to resolve the problem.. @exside File attachments will most likely not be included in the archive file, because of bloat like you said. They'll most likely be encrypted separately and stored in a relative location to the archive file (hidden subfolder most likely).. Hi @dornenkrone - OneDrive is mentioned in our roadmap. It should be added to the core library before being implemented here, so I'll close this request for now.. @Akimace Are you saying that you'd want to see more password entries in the user interface, so you don't have to scroll? So for this image:\n\nYou mean the entries on the right?\nI don't particularly see any harm in having an alternate view to show them in the same size as the Groups on the left.. What do you think @sallar?\nEDIT: I don't think font-size reduction/changing is a good idea.. So perhaps we can find another way to effectively display a lot of entries.. Yep.. that's what I was thinking.. . Hi @Ravenheart - Unfortunately not yet.. Options hasn't been implemented yet: #140 \nOnce that's completed this can be dealt with - thanks!. Hi @aesthicc:\n\nWhen I open buttercup i would just like to type in my password for my main vault instead of selecting it - a setting for this would be nice\n\n124 will do something like this. You can also use Cmd+1 (or the index of the archive) to select it using the keyboard.\n\ngo to a corresponding entry in the list\nstart the search function\n\nYou can use Cmd+F to search.. I don't see any use in reading keystrokes adhoc. \n\ncommand/control + N creates a new vault instead of an entry when a vault is opened - this seems silly to me\n\nI agree on this point. From a usability perspective you're more often going to create new entries/groups and not vaults. @sallar ?. The problem with the keyboard capture is that it's fraught with potential issues. What happens if we don't recognise input focus properly and it thinks we're searching?\nI don't think searching is so hard as to try to make it automatic when someone is typing.. it's simply not intuitive. More often then not, if someone is typing it's probably out of error, not knowing that it's a feature. IMO such a feature is unnecessary... I'm going to close this issue as it's too general. The first point is already covered in another issue, and the other points are in contention. ~~I did create #649 for the keyboard shortcut, however.~~ The keyboard shortcut Cmd+N is mentioned in #620, so it should already be done.. Hi @deadcoder0904 - I'm not sure if we exactly want to support skipping versions. Sure, single-language updates can be frustrating when they're not relevant, but many applications force updates and just prompt for a restart. Often times patch updates will be for security features, and these we do not want people to skip - by using our software our brand and reputation are on the line when it comes to security, so ideally everyone would always use the most up-to-date version of Buttercup without exception.\nEDIT: Take Telegram (app) for instance: I've been prompted to restart after updates that only include new Emojis. In comparison we rarely have updates.. The latest language support version is not a good sample of what we regularly publish.. Thank you so much! That\u2019s really awesome to hear. We appreciate the feedback.\nPerhaps some option for devs to publish updates that can be skipped and updates that cannot? These language patches could easily be skipped for some whilst security updates would be mandatory.\nThere might be some nicer way to prompt, as well. For instance we could prompt only for important updates, and the other less important ones could simply bring up an indicator in the UI. I\u2019ll speak about it with my colleague... Well we're definitely not abandoning anything.. But thanks a lot for the feedback, it means a lot!. @sallar Sure! I'll check when I'm back at work.. So might still be a week sorry. Don't have a working Ubuntu installation at home right now.. Seems to be fine under 1.10.. Good point @exside! We could easily prompt for the original password. I would say however that the damage is done if an intruder were to be in front of an unlocked archive. Changing the master password would be the least of the owner's worries. Hence the Priority:High rating rather than critical. Autolock is definitely a must.. I've had a think about this, and I think for now we'll be keeping it as is. It's a security concern to allow the changing of the master password without knowing the current. You don't change your password too often most likely, so this shouldn't be seen as a step that should require very little effort/time.. The clipboard should automatically be cleared after some time.. 10-15 seconds or something like that. If it doesn\u2019t automatically clear then it\u2019s definitely a bug with that function... This is covered in #124. I'll close it in favour of that.\nBasically, we'd need a couple of things before this'd work:\n * Settings (to allow people to opt-in/out of such functionality)\n * The vault they're logging in to should be displayed on the unlock prompt\n. Hi @xiorcal - I'm not sure what you mean by references here. I guess you're only talking about imported data, right? If you mean for the purpose of updating and overwriting old passwords and values, that could definitely be achieved. It'd require some substantial additions to the importer project, however.. @xiorcal Would you be able to clarify what you mean?. Ah, makes sense.. Pretty hardcore feature though. Might need some work in core.\nDepends on buttercup/buttercup-core#223. Hi. Could you please confirm your desktop app version? This should be solved in the latest release.. Ok, well the issue might be elsewhere. Are you able to attach a stacktrace at all? This could be done by opening the I inspector (in the menu). This would help us narrow down the bug.. It\u2019s hopefully not necessary in this case.. the stack trace should be printed hopefully. It may be on the nodejs side so perhaps it could be possible to see if you run the app from the command line? . Good to go @sallar :). I like this idea. Editing could almost grey-out/disable the other items to prevent this, or a dialog like you suggested.\nWhat do you think @sallar ?. Hi,\nSorry to hear! Yes I would suggest downgrading until further notice. We\u2019ll try to check this out asap. Any chance you could provide a screenshot without showing secure data? Not sure how we could reproduce this issue.. Thanks for the screenshots.. that\u2019s actually very helpful. I think I know the cause. \nRegarding your password however - you said you weren\u2019t able to retrieve it? Not sure if we\u2019re actually looking at 2 different issues here - the field order and your password not being retrievable.. @sallar Any idea what might be happening here? Not sure why the file is downloaded to disk.. Would think that it could/should just go to memory?. Arch is unfortunately not part of our testing suite, so getting anything done here will be difficult without contributed effort. We'd appreciate any help you might provide @phineas0fog - debugging this on your machine would most likely be really helpful. If there's some dependency missing on arch (due to the fact that arch runs more lean than other linux distros) perhaps we can find out what it is and document that for other arch users.. @phineas0fog before we continue, please try the solution posted here to see if that helps.. @Zjemm You could try out that solution I linked in the previous post, or you could perhaps open a dev environment and try to debug it there. Any information would help... Hi @Zjemm - Great news! I'll close this and will make a note on our readme.\nWith regards to the ENOENT error, we have a bug for that: #641.\nIf you could create a new issue for the group-dragging issue, that'd be really helpful!. Renamed for clarity.. @Jaimefs We've been able to reproduce this issue on one of our macbooks, and it looks like some kind of rendering issue from the browser/electron side. Updating the electron version didn't seem to help at all.. Wondering if it might be some rendering issue to do with lower-spec/older GPUs on Mac:\n\nelectron/electron#13303\natom/atom#17694\n\nSomeone also mentioned that not having a background on the <body> caused weird UI issues when scrolling.. Might be worth to try setting it to something as well if it isn't already:\n\nelectron/electron#12830. Solution was to roll back Electron to the previous major version. Seems that something with v2 has broken rendering on some macs.. @sallar Would you mind updating the description?. Yes, sorry.. This was just fixed. This problem will soon go away when we migrate our website.. Whoops - closing as duplicate of #620. Hi @reedpro - Thanks for posting the issue.. glad you got it sorted! Off-monitor windows can be tricky sometimes. Here's a link on how to get them back if you happen to lose any windows.\n\nI'll close this as it's not related to Buttercup in particular.. Hi @franco27 - The current search dialog was a design decision. We decided that having a search results page was not the best approach to searching for entries. I can definitely see your point regarding having search results shown on a page where they can be viewed separately. We might head back in that direction at some point, so I'll leave this issue open. Thanks!. I'll merge this as it's a basic change. Thanks @jameswomack!. This is a really good point, and I'll admit I haven't toyed with portability myself yet. I would definitely regard it as a higher-than-average priority. Any ideas about this particular workaround @sallar?\nWe had planned to release a purely portable version (#429), but that hasn't taken root yet.. I've accepted this as an issue, as it would be a great feature to have. I currently don't have time to implement right now but PRs are welcome.. Hi @warnerbryce - Unfortunately this is the desktop application, and not the right place to post issues regarding the browser extension. I'll close this issue.\nIf you still have issues you can open an issue there. But please remember that we cannot possibly reproduce every connection issue, and usually except only demonstrable bugs. Test with the Nextcloud demo instances first.. Hi, unfortunately this is not the right place for mobile issues. That would be on our mobile repo.. \nHmm.. Seems that it works fine here with the latest version (names removed for security).\nAre you sure that you reloaded the dialog after you put the buttercup vault in there? . Hmm.. I guess we should be throwing an error for that. A dialog would help here \ud83d\ude05. @zengxp0605 Can you confirm that this is a network issue where you're not able to access dropbox?. Closing due to inactivity. Judging by the most recent screenshot, this was most likely a network issue.. There will be partial support for this in #618. We won't be adding functionality to silence all updates: We don't want a situation where people are using outdated software when potential security vulnerabilities are identified and patch.\nWe'll allow users to silence non-vital updates, but not critical ones. I'll close this in favour of #618.. @waguirre Please include more information, like what version of Windows, exact steps to reproduce the issue, which version of Buttercup. Have you tried more than once?\nConsider that the information you provide should be enough to reproduce the issue. I've not been able to see Dropbox fail like this.. Hi everyone - I can confirm this bug. There's been regression in the 1.10.2 release. We'll be looking into it immediately.. @waguirre @evileumas @Darkblader24 Thanks for taking the time to comment on the issue. We've managed to find the issue (API change in Electron) and patch it, release pending. . This has been fixed and is available in 1.10.3.. Hi @Darkblader24 - Thanks!\nThis actually depends on #540. When that is done, we will support Entry types, which will allow for default fields. For example, a common item will be a \"website login\" which will always contain a URL field.. > Is there any mockups of the new UI for the browser?\nNot yet, but you're welcome to follow the progress.. I believe the question(s) have been answered, so I'll close this issue. We can reopen if necessary.. Also, I don't think having any custom function to do this is a good idea. We should use a component to do this which we can use across our entire platform. I would also prefer to use one that's designed for this.\nWe use this library in our latest project @sallar - Maybe some wrapper around it could work?. I do believe that OWASP guidelines are the way to go at least.. I think that's safe.. To be honest I'm not sure how relevant #62 is anymore. Forcing all of our user base to use certain-strength passwords is not a great idea, especially seeing as some (including myself) use it occasionally in programmatic situations where password strength is not really a factor (not security focused).\nI think @antoine-amara we could add a password strength meter, but not a requirement on the minimum strength. What do you think @sallar ?. Also, that linked library doesn't really provide any base for what we'd use to display a strength meter. If we add one here, it should be easily extractable for use in other libraries (ie the functionality and strength configurations).\n. Woah.. This is a weird one. Thanks for submitting - we'll hopefully be able to check it out shortly.. The issue for this topic is here: buttercup/buttercup-browser-extension#91\nI'll close this in favour of that issue.. Could you please confirm that the error occurs when saving a new entry item?\nWhat version are you using?. This is just a deprecation.. not really an issue. I\u2019m sure many libraries that use buffers suffer from such warnings.\nI guess you opened the dev tools yourself?. Hi @Extarys - What version of the browser extension are you using? It should be v2.\nWhat WebDAV server are you using? It's possible that we don't have support for it.. Ah, I missed the fact that that you\u2019re using self signed certificates. Buttercup only supports certificates signed against public authorities- ie SSL certificate services.\nThis is due to the fact that it uses Chrome under the hood, which has this requirement.\nEDIT: The browser should never be able to connect to a service using a self-signed certificate anyway.. This is just a security restriction. If it's for the purposes of testing, I'd recommend using HTTP only.. I've made mention of the self-signed cert limitation in the readme. Unfortunately this is not currently on our roadmap.. Great point! I can appreciate the fear of doing exactly what you did.. I've had to do the same.\nButtercup actually keeps the history of all changes to every entry, but currently doesn't provide a way to access this information. I've created #680 for this (I'd thought that we already had such an issue, but I couldn't find one).\nI'll close in favour of that issue. Upon its completion you'll be able to view the previous value and restore it if needed.. Yep! I think that's something we'd want. We don't have bandwidth for it right now, but I'll accept this issue and we'll add it to the roadmap at some stage.\nThis would be quite a huge undertaking, even when it doesn't seem so. I'll try to briefly explain why. There are a couple of ways we could allow icons to be set:\n\nStoring image data in the vault alongside the entry\nStoring a URL to the image\n\nThe first way is much harder as we don't yet know exactly how we want to store this data. Storing binary data in our text based vault files is not ideal. We're currently not accepting work along this path just yet.\nThe second way is easier, but perhaps less pretty. You can see here in the browser extension that we have a way of fetching different types of icons. You could use the ICON type to request an icon URL, and by setting a property called maybe \"icon url\" in an entry you'd be able to test for a custom icon.. We don't want to mix rich icons (download from websites / favicons) with generic icon packs. Buttercup should support rich icons only - actual images like the following:\n\nSo whatever solution we add here should still result in images being chosen instead of the automatic favicons. That unfortunately means that it's a bit more difficult to achieve.. @blimmo Can you add/edit/remove files within C:\\Users\\Peter\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ ? Would be good to check if you can to see what the problem is. ACCES is obviously a permissions issue with your machine.. Is it possible that Buttercup was installed with raised permission levels, like from an admin user or super user privileges?\nWould you mind uninstalling and reinstalling from a freshly-loaded version of say 1.10.3 so we can test the update functionality?. Also reproducible for me now:\n\n. As mentioned earlier it can be run from the temp folder - it causes a permission dialog to show and then it works normally. Running it from the command line fails as does the update process in the app. I think you\u2019re right about it being a security precaution.\nDefinitely time to have the windows stuff signed properly I think.. I'd say that this is then blocked by #704. Really appreciate the help and patience here. @sallar and I are looking at investing in a codesigning cert shortly so we can clear up some of these issues. We'll hopefully take a look at it tomorrow and over the next few days.. @sallar Hey mate, this probably still needs a couple of things:\n\nCopy support for the code\nSelection support?\nSome kind of text describing the code that appears\n\nThe last I feel is important because it pops up and could use a description. We already have \"Enable browser access\" that needs translating, so it should be simple enough to have this in there too :). I think we still need to double check this on windows... Amazing @ph1p! Keep up the great work! \ud83d\ude04 . This is looking amazing! \ud83d\ude04 . Keep up the great work @ph1p - This is a much needed feature for sure \ud83d\ude01. @ph1p No worries! Yeah always better to keep it minimal I think. It\u2019ll take us a while to review I\u2019m sure but don\u2019t stress about getting it through! \ud83d\ude0a. This is looking really good!. I think it'd be great if a few details were shown:\n * Type\n * Source location (URL)\n * Status\n * Last opened? (Could be access timestamp). > getSharedArchiveManager object to obtain the name of the archive file but this doesn't have any group attributes?\nIt's pretty much done by taking the Entry and recursing upwards to get all the parents. You can see it done in the browser extension.\nWould be super cool to differentiate some items like this:\n\n. Also reproducible in Chrome :( . Error is something we saw during development:\n{ [Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, stat 'C:\\Config.Msi']\n  errno: -4048,\n  code: 'EPERM',\n  syscall: 'stat',\n  path: 'C:\\\\Config.Msi' }\nThis is actually fixed in a newer dependency version, but something has gone wrong in packaging.. Ah, good point. I immediately attempted to reproduce, saw the same popup error again and thought it was related - it is not.\nYour error looks more like CORS, which can be fixed just as easily (if it is so). I'll fix the obvious bug that I was referencing and will then try to reproduce your exact error.\nApologies for the inconveniece!. Quite bad documentation on the NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI error. I only really found this one SO post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15229330/attempt-to-add-a-rule-to-a-css-stylesheet-gives-the-operation-is-insecure-in-f - It's for CSS but presents a good case for it being CORS related.. @n8v8R Nope! That's new to me. Thanks for that - I'll keep it in mind if a simpler solution is not possible :). @sallar I still suspect CORS, as we never added CORS headers on the secure-file-host. We should be setting them here. We could also use the cors package.. I'm not able to reproduce your issue @n8v8R. The only error I see is the permission one, which I can easily fix by running a newer version of the dependency I mentioned (to be released in a couple of hours).\nI suspect that there could be something else going on here, such as a more restrictive security configuration in your Firefox install. My firefox is running with defaults - have you modified something which may affect this feature?. > localhost:12821/get/directory:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)\n\nsetup-index.js:69 [error] Failed fetching localfile contents of '/': Failed reading remote file: /\n\nThese are most likely the bug that's getting fixed - The issue I mentioned (#706). We'll release it as a patch first and will assess the damage still after that.\n\non FF 63.0.3 and FF Nightly, and both producing the same issue.\n\nWeird.. I'm on windows 10, latest stable FF, no error besides the one I mentioned.\nEDIT: Just confirmed that 1.12.1 solved the issue for me. We'll release this asap. Let's see if it solves the issue for you in Vivaldi and if it has any sway on the output you're seeing in FF.. Thanks for the help @n8v8R! Glad it was solved.. Links:\n * Electron builder code signing\n * Comodo certs. Certificate purchase is underway.. Just waiting for the validation to be completed.. Validation complete - Now we just need to add the signing process to the desktop build procedure.. Thankyou @AmazingBeu! Great advice :). The results are returned by regular filesystem queries using Node's fs module.. I would expect that it would be there in some form (mount/link etc.).\nDo you have access to Git Bash? Maybe running an ls -la in that dir would show the directory... Ok.. Interesting. I think this feature will need fine tuning of course. Those $.. prefixed could also be hidden.. \nConfirmed \u2639\ufe0f. Is the System menu not available for you? Can you screenshot your menu bar?. This is a very good point. That being said, the feature is still very useful for debugging. I would personally want to improve security but not reduce debugability. Any suggestions? \ud83d\ude42. @sallar Good idea. I think the issue is that someone could instruct a Buttercup user to enter code in the dev tools, which is definitely a security risk. We should probably do a large console log in there at least to alert users to the importance of not pasting code - #716. I think tooltips are very important - good idea!. @ldexterldesign Stepping in for @sallar on this one - I'm not sure if it has any specific meaning... but it should somehow indicate that clicking the password in the generator selects and copies the whole text. This needs some tweaking as I'm not sure it works on every environment right now, but it should select the whole password and copy it - there may be a bug here if it's not working like that.\nThe generator is stored in the ui project.. @ldexterldesign It would be advantageous to have the issue in other repos where it's present, if you have time :). Good idea! I would also prevent saving for such situations.. @ldexterldesign Agreed it could be higher prio. We don't currently have bandwidth for it, and would hope that someone could contribute it. Sorry that you lost some data.. 401 is a http error - \u201cunauthorised\u201d. Either your password is wrong or the connection is failing due to invalid data.\nPlease include details regarding what you\u2019re connecting too, how it\u2019s hosted etc.. Thanks @mokhosh - In the future please try to keep issues limited to one item, so they're easier to address. Let's leave this as the unhandled error.\n\nAlso the update dialogue borders on nagware guys.\n\nNot sure what you mean.\n\nPlease add a preferences section where we can decide on these little things.\n\nIt's in the works.. Closing in favour of #690. > download and install it automatically\nThis is possible, but I find this quite intrusive - We can't know reliably what type of connection the user is on for a start.\n\nstop asking until the next update\n\nWe don't want this right now because we want users to always be reminded when critical updates are provided. Having the ability to skip updates would require that only non-critical updates can be skipped.\n\npreferably just the updated parts and not the whole electron engine\n\nCurrently there's no option here that I'm aware of - our build process builds the entire project into a binary setup executable, which is what's used by the update system. We're using 3rd party components here (provided with Electron) as we're not currently investing effort in writing our own.\n\nan option to check for updates manually\n\nWe have the check-for-updates menu item, but I assume you just mean a manual update procedure rather than an automatic one.\nI think our only option here is the critical/trivial update attributes.. so we'd need the ability to mark and detect this before we can change the behaviour.. Hi @xDrixxyz - Sorry to hear you're having issues.\nPlease check the log for any helpful information when you try this procedure.\nVersion is in the about menu..

I've passed this to @sallar to review.\n\nconsidering another solution by removing the magicIcon completely and instead explicitly state in text that the button is a password generator\n\nHmm, not sure that I agree with that, as I feel that a good icon can definitely communicate what it's doing. It also doesn't require translation (to that effect, having less text and more iconography can definitely be a good thing). Also, space is somewhat limited:\n\nI would suggest finding a more descriptive icon if you think it can be explained better with another image, but I don't personally think that text would work better in that case.. The log gives the reason:\n```\n[2019-01-04 23:21:10:0692] [info] Checking for update\n[2019-01-04 23:21:12:0168] [info] Found version 1.14.0 (url: Buttercup-1.14.0-mac.zip, Buttercup-1.14.0.dmg)\n[2019-01-04 23:21:13:0876] [info] Downloading update from Buttercup-1.14.0-mac.zip, Buttercup-1.14.0.dmg\n[2019-01-04 23:21:13:0950] [info] / requested\n[2019-01-04 23:21:13:0959] [info] /app.zip requested\n[2019-01-04 23:21:14:0381] [info] download-progress listener count: 1\n[2019-01-04 23:21:14:0381] [info] contentLength: 57686193\n[2019-01-04 23:21:36:0122] [warn] Error: Code signature at URL file:///Users/perry/Library/Caches/pw.buttercup.desktop.ShipIt/update.dM1MrBV/Buttercup.app/ did not pass validation: code failed to satisfy specified code requirement(s)\n[2019-01-04 23:21:36:0122] [error] Error: Error: Code signature at URL file:///Users/perry/Library/Caches/pw.buttercup.desktop.ShipIt/update.dM1MrBV/Buttercup.app/ did not pass validation: code failed to satisfy specified code requirement(s)\n[2019-01-04 23:21:39:0993] [info] Proxy server for native Squirrel.Mac is closed (was started to download https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/releases/download/v1.14.0/Buttercup-1.14.0-mac.zip)\n```. Seems to be exactly this: https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Mac/issues/160\nNow that we're publishing from my machine, the certificate is different and that's why updates are failing. Trying to use the old cert now.. Ok, v1.14 has been updated and it seems to work fine now. Seems that the update process (Squirrel) is actually quite secure (we can't even force a change in certificate \ud83d\ude05). We've used the original cert for now but will migrate again later when we figure out how to bridge it.. @julianpoemp That should be the case yes... It seems that something's listening on that port already, which is weird. It's not reserved in the IANA port registrations, so I can't imagine that another process would be randomly using it.\nWould it be possible for you to check what process is using that port?. Thanks for checking on this! It could be that the listener/server is not closed properly on shutdown, or something to that effect.. Good idea! I know the feeling of frustration with popup windows.. Telegram does the same thing for me.\nI would think something like an in-window update notification, in say the bottom-right corner, could make this issue less of a problem? We want users to update - it's very important - so I don't think we'd want to hide it like with VSCode or something.\nIt could sit in the corner so users aren't disturbed by it:\n\nThis would allow it to be enough of a nag to get the user to click it, while not interrupting typing or stealing focus.\nThoughts?. > the only problem could be the notification covering some buttons in the corner\nOf course the overlay could have a closing button just like the Cancel button in the update dialog now.. so functionally it'd still be as usable.. @ph1p Can you try npm install kdbxweb? It works for me, albeit with a few errors:\n\nIt could be just some caching that broke on your machine.. Good if it goes away after removing package-lock.json.. With regards to that error, yes, we can remove that line now that we're using axios.. Hi @gerkmao - this is the wrong repository. You want https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-browser-extension\nI'll close this.. We can leave this open for now - The fetch method is out of sync with core.. Hi! Where did you export this from?. @conovor I could be wrong, but I don't know that the carriage returns and line feeds there are invalid. They're contained within double quotes and should be parsed as a single value. In fact, they're valid according to CSV RFC 4180:\n\nFields that contain a special character (comma, CR, LF, or double quote), must be \"escaped\" by enclosing them in double quotes\n\nSo I don't believe this is an issue with Buttercup nor its exporting functionality. I confirmed that this works fine with Excel, for instance. I'll close this for now.. Hi @conovor - That doesn't look normal, but to confirm I'd need you to attach an example buttercup archive where this occurs. Please make sure that you do not include any actual sensitive information or passwords, and please include the password (can be \"test\", for instance). Simply wrap the vault in code tags here and we can confirm if this bug is present or not. You may also attach the exported CSV code if you like.. I'll need to test this as well to see where the error originates from. If someone is able to install earlier versions manually and check if they can auto-update to the latest version, that'd be very helpful.. Hi @vkuznet! We will be supporting notes, that'll be handled by #742. Due to that I'll close this issue as a duplicate.\n\ndo you plan to support importing 1password secure notes\n\nYes, once #742 is implemented we can add import support for notes from other managers.\n\ncan you make some changes to UI to make entrance of notes more comfortable, e.g. larger textfield where user can place text in some formatted form (paragraphs).\n\nAbsolutely! This is currently underway.\nThanks for dropping by!. Thanks for the write up @ph1p! Will close this now.. This would probably be best accomplished by using the isTrash method on a group - But I understand this is on the front-end. Could we have bc_group_role hardcoded in the config somewhere, like in the core project? https://github.com/buttercup-pw/buttercup-core/blob/master/source/classes/ManagedGroup.js#L257\n. Haha \ud83d\ude04 . \ud83d\ude02. Can't these just be <i />?. Should we maybe keep these icons consistent? https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-browser-extension/tree/master/resources/providers. Should we start to already look at standardising these paths? If we're using webpack we can just alias the root source directory or renderer directory so we can use absolute paths. . Should this perhaps be uppercase ArchiveTypes? Just a bit weird seeing it as camel \ud83d\ude43. We should probably leave web patch locked ~0.25.2. Wouldn't just !Array.isArray(list) work?. \ud83d\ude0d. Probably best to keep this locked to patches.. Should we bin this? Or was this kind of a pending item..?. Should this dispatch an error message?. This too... And this... I sent a message about this event and cb. If it blocks the user from doing other save-inducing actions, that would be best. Could you confirm the behaviour here? \ud83d\ude0a. @sallar Should this not make it hidden always?. What if this fails? unlockArchiveInArchiveManager(payload, password). Agreed. Even having it default to shown (first install) and being able to hide it later with alt would be preferable.. Probably safer to have this patch-fixed: ~0.39.0... Did this work? . \ud83d\ude01. Would naming this menubarVisible make more sense? Just because of how it's used... Perhaps the naming here too... Yeah.. I think menubarIsVisible or menubarVisible might make more sense as it's boolean. What do you feel?. I'd almost recommend this one, so that you wouldn't have to use lodash at all... But if it works it works... What about joining this to the previous if?\njavascript\n   if (!win) {\n      win = getMainWindow();\n    } else {\n        win.webContents.send('load-archive', payload);\n        return;\n    }. Oh, actually I see why.. it occurs after. Would it be safer to just check truthiness? if (win) {?. Same inner variable.. what about newWindow?. Woah.. Don't mean to be a buzzkill.. but is there a nicer way to do this? This be crazy hard to read \ud83d\ude05. What about:\njavascript\nconst menubarVisibleSetting = getSetting(state, 'menubarVisible');\nconst menubarVisible = typeof menubarVisibleSetting === 'boolean' ? menubarVisibleSetting : true;\n?. We should probably use \"~0.2.2\" here, for stability's sake.. I know these are async, but I would feel much safer if this once listener was before the send.. \ud83d\ude05. This is nice, but a couple of things that would be nice to iron out:\n\nWhy not Alt? Alt is generally accepted (and programmed) in windows to show file/menu bars when they're hidden (as mentioned here for example).\nIf we have to stick to a different accelerator for some reason, is H the best key? It could be for Hide, sure, but there may be many things in the interface that we want to hide or show. I would suggest M personally, for menu bar, but now I'm not sure what other keys we could potentially be stepping on.\n\nWhat's your opinion @sallar?. I think this violates the prettier config. I would suggest having comma-dangle as a violation.\n@sallar?. Ah good point! My mistake. It's fine with me then... Why debounce menu creation? Isn't 500ms maybe a bit much?. \ud83d\udc4d. I really like the nested style, though I think some components should be named differently. For instance, main.menu alludes to there being a main category with a menu subcategory, which I don't think there is. Should this be main-menu perhaps? Or even menu.main?. And here as well... And here... Is this showing lowercase languages in the menu? Perhaps we could install ucfirst to transform the first char to uppercase? What do you think @sallar?. Nevermind, I saw that they're capitalised in a later file.. That makes sense.. I would also expect that the visit call-to-action would be imperative.. You could use jsx control statements here:\njavascript\n<If condition={Object.keys(meta).length > 0}>\n  <!-- content -->\n</If>. This might be more tidy than the ternary operator.. Node is used without checks so should be isRequired here.. I know that you didn't invent the code of course, but if we're changing it then it's a good time to update it \ud83d\ude04 . I think static propTypes within classes is what we're going for now - last I spoke with @sallar :). Yeah it's great! Much nicer imo to read just XML... Yeah this is a bit confusing. Does it mean that we currently have duplicates? I think one .json file per language should be sufficient right? . This will need updating for Italian.. Hmm yes I see.. \ud83e\udd14. Uh huh.. Ok. That makes sense.. Yes yes.. \ud83d\udc4c. Are you sure on this one @sallar? \ud83d\ude2c. Umm.. Should be kill 'dis?. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d. Maybe these items should not be set. They're not in the correct language and should default to English, but setting them means we can't programmatically find them later.. Same with these.. perhaps don't set them to English. Best leave them unset.. And here... So there's languages specified (hardcoded) also in src/shared/i18n/index.js.. Would it be easiest to store them both somewhere together and use them in both places?. Nice \ud83d\udc4d. This could be maybe a bit neater with a template string however: \njavascript\ni18n.t(`menu.window.${key}`, options). Not 100% sold on the 3 level deep stuff here.. Wondering if we could make it simpler by just having something like \"appmenu\" or something like that? I don't hate it I'm just not sure if we need the extra level, especially seeing as there is another \"window\" group further into the nested items.. Of course we also need to transform the other languages when this is decided \ud83d\ude0a. I would recommend an extension of .dat, for instance, to prevent any arbitrary assignment of type (eg ico/png/jpg etc.).. I'm still not sold on it.. I don't see immediate benefit from using it and I feel it overcomplicates the file structure of the application. In your example you return some-what of a singleton as you're instantiating the class and providing an arg to it.. but this could all be done in-module imo. For instance:\n```javascript\nlet __sharedInstance;\nclass MyClass {}\nexport default MyClass;\nexport function getSharedInstance() {\n  if (!__sharedInstance) {\n    __sharedInstance = new MyClass(stuff);\n  }\n  return __sharedInstance;\n}\n```\nThe class itself is easily testable and mockable at this point. The only reason that you'd want to intercept __sharedInstance here is for integration testing. For that I'd argue that when integration testing, you should mock as little as possible to test the actual platform.. especially if you're going to the trouble of integration testing. Also, if you are going to have to change it to point elsewhere for some reason, you could inject said dependency upstream or provide a setter for the singleton. This latter way is obviously more ugly but integration testing sometimes needs a more complex harness for it to work.\nTldr: I don't think that, for the sake of integration testing, that it's necessary to add index files for directories \ud83d\ude05\nAlso, I may have completely misunderstood your point.. if so I apologise \ud83d\ude2c. I'll let @sallar check this one out. The Cut/Copy/Paste sounds good to me... I think this can be just @import 'variables';. Thanks @hugo-cardenas - Good idea. I think we'll definitely use our own. What icon do you think we should use @sallar?. I would recommend using the batched approach for the desktop app.. Immediate when seeing an icon for the first time, call processIconForEntry and then for every entry just getIconForEntry. All nulls should just default to the default icon.. Basically, the default icon should always be visible and only replaced by a successfully fetched icon.. Lol.. @sallar I wonder if there'd be any benefit from bundling into a single file for the app.. maybe before testing. Not sure what we currently do here.. but we do bundle at least the front-end right?. Maybe even .icon.dat, for instance... Wow! I love it.\nI would perhaps reduce the gap between the icons and the text a tiny bit.. and maybe center the icon a bit more.. but it's looking very elegant.. > Because here it is really not going to be used anywhere out of Iconographer, I could actually remove the index and do that part inside the iconographer.js itself. What about that?\n\nBut otherwise, an alternative for this could be what you suggest.\n\nIsn't that the same as what I suggested? \ud83d\ude05\nI was suggesting having the singleton/instance getter inside the relevant module file.\n\nI actually love how in JS you have such freedom of going with so many different approaches in this aspect\n\nMe too! It's sometimes a burden as it means there's more ways in which you can hurt yourself when it comes to maintainability, but usually it's a good thing.\n\nI love discussing these meta aspects of code... maybe you noticed\n\nI did! Haha.. and so do we. Always great to have fresh eyes on what we're building too!. No.. was just laughing inwardly at how deep the structure is already. I don't think there are any action points here at this stage (at least not in this PR), but maybe something we can look at in the future... Yes I understand your point.. I think it's more clear the way you had it actually.  The event emitter I feel is still strong for some use cases, and I may use it in the mobile, but your use of the promise API is succinct. Let's stick with that!. @sallar Is this still needed?. Can be removed... Would this be safer setting it to state? If a re-render occurs for any reason, the image will change, right?. Should we pick a few more?. I'm happy with it \ud83d\ude0a. Hmm, will this create weird behaviour? Would it be possible to focus the first one? I guess that's probably quite difficult... Ah I missed those! Good stuff.. Copied from the last PR:\n\nPlease see my earlier comment. Would be great to use EntryFinder here instead.. Do we need to search groups? I can't really see there being that many groups that they'd need to be included in search results. What's your opinion @sallar @ph1p ?. @ph1p I've contacted Github to have the PR removed.. I would still think that entries alone are sufficient, but I'm happy to hear other arguments to the contrary. Using EntryFinder will produce a breadcrumb trail to the entry so you can illustrate what groups are containing found entries.. Perhaps @sallar has a point on this? :smile: . @ph1p No problem.\n\nIf it does get deleted then the example for EntryFinder is here if you need it.. @ph1p The old branch history has been deleted (just received confirmation from GH) \ud83d\udc4d. @sallar does it also close on unfocus? Would be good if it was also possible via mouse. . \ud83d\udc4d. What's with the timeout? \ud83d\ude0a. I would suggest using a whole new function for this, rather than having a cryptic boolean flag.. What about getURIPathToFile and getPathToFile?\nChanging them would be easy due to their infrequent use.. Can you use 0 as the value? Having arbitrary values (300) is not so stable and the necessary value could differ from computer to computer.. Sorry to be pedantic! But getPathToFile should return something like /path/to/file and getURIPathToFile should return the file:///path/to/file URL.\nTo make it simpler, could could make getPathToFile, and then:\njavascript\nfunction getURIPathToFile(fileName) {\n  return `file://${getPathToFile(fileName)}`;\n}\n(Most likely). Sorry - this should be getURIPathToFile, as it uses the file:/ uri.. This should be getPathToFile as it returns a regular file path.. Why splice? It looks like you're either duplicating the array or inserting at the beginning. Either way, why not use unshift(item1, item2...)?. \ud83c\udf89. What is the behaviour of isSecondInstance in this case:\n\nVersion 10.0.0 is running\nVersion 10.1.0 is started\n\nDoes version 10.0.0 close? Because I'd imagine it should, especially in the case of using AppImage builds... > regardless of version\nOk, so that means that electron doesn't know which is the \"second instance\"? Unfortunately it might be quite critical: If the user is trying to open a new instance, and they cannot due to it being closed constantly, then usability isn't so great..\nWouldn't it be better to force-close the first instance, and always keep the newly opened instance active?. To move this forward, I created #597 to take care of the execution/closing.. This seems.. unsafe.. haha. We shouldn't rely on the title being in pos 0... This too... Good idea! Though I'd recommend making this simpler now that we're looking at it. Using a regex is obviously going to cause issues when special chars are used, so we should opt for plain text.\nSimply finding the index and replacing the word from that point only should do the trick What about something like this:\njavascript\nconst index = word.toLowerCase().indexOf(this.state.searchTerm.toLowerCase());\nif (index >= 0) {\n  return `${word.substring(0, index)}<mark>${this.state.searchTerm}</mark>${word.substring(index + this.state.searchTerm.length)}`;\n}\nreturn word;. I haven't tested if this works, but it'd do away with the complexity of regular expressions.. Sorry I didn't reply sooner. It's still not as robust as what I suggested, I'm afraid. There's no need for regex at all in this situation. It's a simple result of highlighting the first instance of the search term, which my example does with only string splitting.. Sure! I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the worst if it\u2019s everywhere.. but no harm either way really.. Should this console log be removed?. index is redeclared below.. maybe they could be uniquely named resultIndex and groupIndex perhaps?. Any particular reason this isn't destructured? \ud83d\ude0a. Can this be removed?. Could this be removed?. Destructuring?. Destructuring?. Destructuring?. ",
    "sallar": "Closed by #92\n. I think this depends on #140, since we don't want this to be enabled by default. user might have something in their clipboard that can be lost by this change. What do you think @perry-mitchell?. @lietu @perry-mitchell I agree that it should be on by default, but maybe we should check the content to see if it's the same as what we copied last. so we don't delete user's data by accident. Imagine after copying and using their password, they have copied some important information to paste in a note or something and exactly at that moment, our cleanup runs and deletes user's important info. . Clean :)\n. Isn\u2019t this one done already @perry-mitchell?\n. Closed by #92\n. Closed by #92\n. @perry-mitchell Are we still doing this?. @perry-mitchell we can use meta data or attributes, cant we? and just a different representation.. I think we should just store a key, and leave the design/graphic to the client and then for showing the icons, we should have a common icon repo. This way the archive stays small and the user will always see the latest version of the icons.. Yeah. A \"default\" icon in case the actual one couldnt be found. For the format i guess svg is fine, but we need to find a good icon set compatible with our license that includes most of what we want. . Merged.\n. Closed by #92\n. @perry-mitchell It should be... but requires testing on a real linux machine, so you can maybe have a look at that... Thanks!\n. @perry-mitchell yes, if you have a distribution certificate on your machine, the release will be signed automatically. So closing since no longer an issue.. @ph1p thanks, I have figured out the extension association (electron-builder package does it), my problem is now I don't know how to test it. I don't know how does the OS pass the file path to the app.\n. thanks @ph1p, those events are really helpful. Will try to make it work ASAP.\n. Cmd+A works everywhere as far as I tried. Please re-open if proven otherwise.\n. I just double checked the issue:\nThe installed version didn\u2019t support CMD+A because the app was lacking system menus. As a result of issue #45 being resolved, the Edit menu is in place now and CMD+A works as expected.\nWe\u2019ll leave this issue open until the next version has been released.\n. Closed by #92\n. The chrome extension is currently in the works, an alpha version of that will be released soon.\nThank you for the suggestion though :+1: \n. The core module needs to be republished on npm, then bump up the dependency in this project. Will fix it ASAP.\n. Fair enough, this should be added.\n. I agree. We should think about that for Beta.\n. Yes @perry-mitchell I updated the PR description to include this.\n. Closed by #92\n. Thanks for this :+1: \n. Thanks for the suggestion. By installing it using brew you mean brew cask right? Because to my knowledge brew cask is what people use for installing and uninstalling app binaries and brew install itself is usually for bash executables.\nhttp://caskroom.io/\n. Thanks. I will look into this further as soon as I got more time. Here\u2019s a guide for submitting new apps to brew cask for our future reference:\nhttps://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/doc/development/adding_a_cask.md\n. @perry-mitchell I agree, we should do it soon :)\n. After the This PR has been merged into master, Buttercup will be available to install using: brew cask install buttercup. @marksteve Thanks for reporting and sorry it took longer than expected! Like a year... \ud83d\ude15 . Closed by #92\n. Closed by #92\n. Thanks for this @mpourismaiel, will check it out ASAP. :+1: \n. Turns out that to fix this, node_modules needs to be removed and npm install again.\n. Thanks!\n. Perhaps a second release after the GUI rework could include keyfile support. Right @perry-mitchell?\n. @Aktariel Yes, an issue is submitted for that: #233 . @Shosta thanks. Please update the related issue with more information if possible, so we have a bit more knowledge on the matter.. Thanks @naitian, I\u2019ll check it out soon :) Cheers\n. Hey, thanks for the PR.

Thank you for letting us know.\n. Thanks @Jameskmonger, @perry-mitchell is actually adding that in https://github.com/buttercup-pw/buttercup-cli and it'll come to the GUI soon :)\n. Hi @aktary, :)\nThanks for letting us know. Although @perry-mitchell is right, the windows should not be affected and the workspace window should not be of type \"intro\" thus should not be closed... I will try this on my machine more to see where\u2019s the issue.\nAlso the error message you're referring to belongs to the \"buttercup\" core package which is used by the buttercup ui project.\nThanks!\n. Closed by #92\n. Thanks @CodeTheory, Buttercup UI is being re-engineered at the moment, and this is something that I\u2019m actually working on right now. Full featured tree instead of just a normal representation of the folders. \n. Closed by #92\n. @Jameskmonger Like @perry-mitchell mentioned it\u2019s a common practice that is done usually for visibility and better understanding of the process. Also, code reviews, comments and suggestions are easier to do in this phase. Cheers!\n. @perry-mitchell Is this still valid? I can't replicate this.. @alireza-ahmadi Thanks! These are valid concerns. And the PR is certainly most welcome.\n. @alireza-ahmadi Are you still doing this?. Another friend was also interested in doing this (the UI part). Thats why Im asking. @perry-mitchell thanks! \n@alireza-ahmadi I gave this a go, since you haven't updated the status, so Im assuming I can do this. It'll be merged soon. Thanks!. \ud83d\ude31 thanks for letting us know. will take a look at this asap.\n. @perry-mitchell I did implement ordering in my files at some point but apparently it is lost. The trash can shouldnt be draggble either. Probably something that can be done in #100 \n. Thanks @alireza-ahmadi, that can be very handy. it's possible to achieve this by listening to \"will-navigate\" event on focusedWindow in the main process. Will look into this at the same time I'm going to look into #33 \n. @perry-mitchell @alireza-ahmadi It's currently possible to re-open the window by pressing CMD/Ctrl+N or \"Archive/File>Open new window\" menu item. But opening a new window by clicking on the dock icon can be another option. We can add that one too.\n. @perry-mitchell I will fix this tonight. @mikebowering Thanks Mike for pointing this out. Will issue a patch ASAP since this is kind of a security concern and length shouldn't be revealed (it was actually pointed out to me by @perry-mitchell a while ago but I forgot about it while implementing the password field).\nThanks!. This is now in master and will go out in next release. Thanks for the report @mikebowering. \ud83d\udc4d . @naitian this is fixed and will go out in next release. thanks!. @perry-mitchell I'm currently doing a re-do for the \"new archive\" and \"open archive\" items, after that, we should look into this. . @perry-mitchell This is a bit complicated. \nRight now the menu is being built form the main process. For this, we need to move this process to the renderer process, and have a way to easily call an update. When a window comes into focus, the menu should be updated. Because two archives might be open at the same time, and one might be logged in and one not. This is not an issue for windows and linux since they should the menu for each window separately, but in Mac, the menu bar is common.\nIt's doable we just need to put in a bit of time.. The good thing is BrowserWindow emits all these events, focus etc. So we're in the clear. Let's get back to this later then.. This is fixed already :) . Isn't this a duplicate of #94? @perry-mitchell . @perry-mitchell since we have changed the UI radically, do you think this is still needed?. @perry-mitchell what do you think?. @perry-mitchell Makes total sense. I can do that alongside another fix :) . @perry-mitchell there's a small issue... we don't have a specific Title bar section :D . @perry-mitchell I have added the password prompt which asks for the archive password before importing. There is one issue, if the password is wrong, the KeePass importer doesn't throw an error or reject a promise, so my \"dialog\" that says an error has occurred never fires... I think this needs to be fixed in buttercup-importer repo.. @perry-mitchell Good to go! \ud83d\udc4d . Actually the copy feature has lost it's default behaviour because right now\ncmd+c \"always\" copies the entry password. No matter where you press it.\nIt's global.\n. It's possible. Right click and select reveal password. . That can be solved by a \"split\" button. A button that has an arrow beside it and opens the submenu that has reveal... or just add the reveal right there but it will be ugly. But this should be \"UI\" enhancement type of thing only.. But would you find yourself looking at a 20 chars long password or copying it more? I still think copy is more important, but that's just me. We can poll it too.. @perry-mitchell definitely mate.. We use Fuse.js for searching. It has some options and can be configured. Right now it's default config and supports \"fuzzy\" searching which is what produces the result in the screenshot (it guesses the result from all chars in title and username). But I don't think this is a problem.. I think it's pros are worth the cons. Implementing a search function by yourself might not cover all bases. for example in your screenshot \"plystaton\" will still match the first item, which is very useful IMO.. I still can't see why this is a problem. Unless there is a better way to handle the search and not lose any functionality it already has, this is the best I could come up with.. @perry-mitchell any updates on this from core?. @perry-mitchell Hey man, does the search exist on core now?. @perry-mitchell Thanks for the suggestions mate. The problem here is right now we don't \"navigate\". I changed the title detection method to be something nicer, and also fixed the titles for Windows and Linux to something that has meaning. . Since we have changed our update method, auto-updating for windows works now. \n\nClosing this issue. @perry-mitchell could you please include a screenshot or some kind of visual clue? not sure I completely understand it. thanks mate. Thanks! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb. Ping @niima . @niima since this hasn't been updated for a while now, im going to go ahead and close this. please re-open if needed.. Thanks, but this is a duplicate of #35, #62 and #78. This is prioritized and will be done soon :) . @Jonas-Drotleff No problem at all :) . Thanks @bboydflo, I will look into this. . Thanks @Pourghannad :). Thanks @yesmeck!. @perry-mitchell lol I didn't do that :D \np.s. linux version looks so good haha. Finally fixed in 0.11.1. Closing this now.. It will help to have a \"sort by\" button next to the search field. what do you think @jarl-tornroos @perry-mitchell . @perry-mitchell we can make the default alphabetical, but also give options: \"a-z, z-a, last access\"?. Of course, I will make the a-z the default. Also by last access I actually meant the default lol. but yeah a real last access would be nice in the future.. Setting GH_TOKEN env variable while running yarn release will upload the artifacts to Github :+1: Closing.. @perry-mitchell Isn't this fixed by #181?. Thanks @f0xy, I will investigate this further. Maybe we should wait for the PR then?. That is completely fine, so please send a PR :) Btw in the code example you linked here, you are pushing directly to this.props.expandedKeys which is against Redux principles. You should use this.props.onExpand function to set the correct expandedKeys. But we can discuss this more over the PR :) Thanks!. The way we handle unnamed groups (both in importing and creating new groups) need to be improved. Thanks.. @lietu We already register the file associations in all platforms, and it should work in Windows too. Does it not work? Here's how it looks in macOS:\n\n. Then this is a bug. Thanks.\n. @lietu Also this should have been resolved in 0.15.0, can you try again?. Thanks @lietu,\nButtercup already supports that, but it's Ctrl/Cmd + C, perhaps we need to make it more clear. If you press Ctrl + C now and an entry is selected, it's password will be written to clipboard. But I agree we need to support more shortcuts . No you're right. Maybe a better \"Keyboard Shortcut Manager\" can solve this problem.. @perry-mitchell if it's really a Yarn thing and nothing that we have done in the package.json then we should definitely warn the users in README. @lietu @dealloc Can you please try again in master? I tried to reproduce with a fresh installation of Windows and Yarn, and I was able to install master correctly. Maybe the breaking module is gone? . @perry-mitchell @lietu \nthe current implementation overwrites the default Ctrl/Cmd+C key, and it's adding a lot of unnecessary issues. What if we change the shortcuts to another set? Like Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+C or something similar?. @lietu This is fixed and will go out in next release :) . @xtrasmal The additional login info are stored right in your browser and never leave it.\nRight now only the desktop app has local filesystem capabilities. But we are working to add cloud to desktop app and also filesystem to the chrome extension. \nThanks.. @perry-mitchell maybe recreate this issue in the browser-extension repo?. Thanks @codeclown. I agree @perry-mitchell, let's do that!. Great idea @fonzai \ud83d\udc4d . @perry-mitchell I have implemented the highlighting, but using the default monospace font which doesn't look so good. This Anonymous Pro that you've linked is looking pretty sweet, I'll post a screenshot here :+1: . @perry-mitchell @fonzai What do you guys think about this?\n\n. @perry-mitchell\n\n. Im suspecting that this is related to the browser extension and not this repo. One example is 1password's functionality: when you click sign in or sign up, and it offers to save the password for the current site, it has alreay filled in the title for you (based on the current page's title). . @smxsm @perry-mitchell I'm going to go ahead and close this for now as it seems the new cloud access has solved this issue. If the problem comes back, please do re-open this issue \ud83d\udc4d Thanks . Thanks @limonte, there is currently a problem with our Update server that causes this.. @limonte Can you please check this out again to see if it works or not?\n. @limonte I just changed some filenames for Windows. what about now? I tried https://download.buttercup.pw in Windows 10 and it worked.. @limonte interesting. what's the exact version (your OS)?. @limonte So which package would be the right package to download?. I mean deb, rpm, AppImage? @limonte . Is the system arch 64bit? buttercup_0.15.0_amd64.deb. @limonte found the issue. and it should be fixed now. by the default the .tar.gz build will be triggered for linux. and if you need to download deb or rpm, you need to check releases page or click on related links on the homepage which I will put up tonight. Can you please confirm that the default download link is now fixed?. So the buttercup website will now show separate deb/rpm links when visited on linux. https://buttercup.pw/. Thanks @limonte, updated that link too. Closing this.. Hi @limonte,\nThanks a lot :) Im glad you like Buttercup! I will merge this now.\nI hope the weather in Turku is better than Helsinki haha \ud83e\udd23 \nHave a nice evening.. @jancborchardt @perry-mitchell if its a fork of owncloud, wouldnt it work same as owncloud? Because right now the code for owncloud and webdav are exactly the same except some url modifications. So what happens if we use \"owncloud\" adapter and just rename it in the UI? Will it work?. Anyway its nice to add support for more sources especially when they're this easy to implement. . @jancborchardt @perry-mitchell I just tried Nextcloud :) It's exactly the same as OwnCloud, so I'll just alias the functionality in the GUI. \n\n. @perry-mitchell there's two parts to it, the file manager which is using any-fs and webdav-fs, and the datasource in buttercup-core. Then I'll wait for the buttercup-core's Nextcloud support before implementing the first part here. But I guess the datasource is an exact copy of OwnCloud isn't it? Only with a different name.. @perry-mitchell yeah it is /remote.php/webdav/. . @perry-mitchell I'm using any-fs and webdav-fs to connect to WebDAV, but Im not doing any modification on the URL, passing it directly to any-fs. We should investigate more.. @perry-mitchell so after I use any-fs to connect, I pass the information to WebDAVDatasource in buttercup-core-web. But since we don't have good error handling for this (my bad) it's not obvious where is the error. I filed #207 too.. @perry-mitchell sure, I still think it's a minor bug. I will look into the GUI part today, and if it's GUI, I can release a patch. But if it's core you might want to look into it. Thanks. @perry-mitchell darn, I forgot to add sanitizer to that field. Now it also accepts all kinds of wrong charatcers which are not valid as file name. That should also be fixed with this.. the valid ones are these AFAIK: /[\\w\\-. ]+/ @perry-mitchell . @perry-mitchell both... Now I only have access to parentCategoryId in the entry list but I should have more info to recognize im right clicking in Trash. but it's a bug. @perry-mitchell super! didn't know that's a thing haha. Thanks @smxsm, we will look into this.. @smxsm Found the issue. This will get fixed in next release soon :). @perry-mitchell It will go out with next release. We don't need to release right away. @icetee Sorry can you explain more about this U2F thing? What does it do and how is related to Dropbox?. @perry-mitchell no... the archive's being created but on reading \"buttercup.min.js\" returns 503... we have to check this together.. @jancborchardt @rullzer @perry-mitchell Nextcloud Support is added and is going out tonight in v0.17.0 :) Thanks for the help guys!\nhttps://github.com/buttercup/buttercup/releases/tag/v0.17.0\n\n. Can you try again? It might have been a cache issue:\n\n. @perry-mitchell when a user click's on the entry item in the entries list (middle column) in addition to delete and move entry, we can show a \"Copy >\" submenu which can include username, password, url and all other custom fields also. What do you think?\n. @d2s Can you try this please? :) . @perry-mitchell Agreed :+1:. @perry-mitchell this too :) . @perry-mitchell fixed. Thanks @mikebowering and sorry for the trouble. @perry-mitchell this is interesting. I checked the scrollbar is definitely in the code base, maybe I should release again today.. @mikebowering sorry for the problem, it is now fixed and released: https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup/releases/tag/v0.16.0 :+1:. Hi, thanks for reporting this issue. I think Nextcloud has a problem with our Webdav module which we encountered while implementing Nextcloud support in #239. We have asked Nextcloud's maintainers for help but we haven't received any so far. Hopefully they will answer and we can resolve this issue. . @hd719 Any help is appreciated. . @perry-mitchell @valentinebm I have seen this error and I'm currently investigating :) . @perry-mitchell @valentinebm Found the issue and fixed, it will go out in next release soon (tonight perhaps). Watch out for the update notice :) . @matthaias @perry-mitchell I think I know what's the problem. if you get the update notice and \"do not install\" and close the app, the message will stay in state but wont do anything... I probably need to clear that message if you close the app without installing the update.. @perry-mitchell it needs to be compatible with Squirrel Mac/Windows. Also we need to clear it because if you quit the app, it will automatically install it anyway, and that's what causes this bug. The message is still there although the new version has been installed!. I saw this bug once, but couldnt reproduce it :(. @perry-mitchell The cause is this call:\njs\n// Create a new window if all windows are closed.\n__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1_electron__[\"app\"].on('activate', () => {\n  if (windowManager.getCountOfType('main') === 0) {\n    windowManager.buildWindowOfType('main');\n  }\n});\nWhich calls:\njs\nbuildWindowOfType(type, fn = null, options = {}) {\n  const window = this._buildProcedures[type](fn, options);\n  this.register(type, window);\n  return window;\n}\nso something is losing state here . This is actually done a long time ago. Dont know why it's still open. Closing :). @xWayfarer Thanks for your idea.\n@perry-mitchell I agree that the other way around is better, meaning that Buttercup client would download a json file of most used passwords, or some kind of identifying data from internet, and would check the passwords \"locally\" against those. Sending private information to a 3rd party API does not sound safe to me.\nAlso,\n1Password has a \"Watch Tower\" feature. I dont know how it works, but it will notify you of your account has been exposed. I think I read somewhere that it also doesn't send your data but rather checks them locally against a downloaded list.. @benseitz Thats WIP. Coming soon in next release :) . Thanks @dnlnrs, this will get fixed in #281 and go in master soon.. @anarchogeek This is fixed now and will be released in a few minutes. Thanks for the report :) . Thanks @llkiriell - Those translation files that you mentioned belong to the embedded chrome/electron runtime and not us. But like @perry-mitchell mentioned, we are looking into adding localization.. This is done and will be released today. Closing this \ud83c\udf89. Hi @ph1p. Yes we started working on i18n a while ago but haven't had a chance to continue because of other priorities. Is it possible for you to send a PR to at least discuss your code? I can't promise merging it yet but it would be nice if we had a discussion over a PR. \nThanks for putting in the time to contribute to Buttercup :) Have a nice weekend.. @simonbcn The desktop app has a built in password generator right now. The browser extensions will get one as well soon. . Hey @simonbcn, thanks for this. Since I know nothing about Arch Linux or AUR packages, would you mind explaining what would the process be here? If we release new versions of buttercup, will this be updated too?. Thanks @sum01 I guess we should add the link to the README. @perry-mitchell  This is a great idea. Although we don't need to store it in localStorage since we have \"per archive\" state in our redux tree. expanded keys, column sizes, etc are all persisted to disk and restored, so this lastGroup thing can be also one of those. right?. and I agree it's very annoying when you open the archive again, it doesn't remember the last selected group and it always goes to General. Thanks @tomatlscomm, does this work correctly in our Desktop application though? Have you tried it?. @perry-mitchell I agree, Let's do this change today then? If you're ok, I can do the renaming.. @woohooatb yes it should be. . @perry-mitchell yes it is backwards compatible. So people that are having the old versions will update to this new version using the old updater (download.buttercup.pw), and new ones will continue getting their updates from new system (github releases).. @sum01 Thanks. but does this mean that buttercup package wont be available? I dont think that the package name needs to change also. Since we have the same in brew also.. @sum01 Sorry Im not sure how AUR works :D What name would you use to install from AUR? Cant we leave that as \"buttercup\" or is it tied to the github repo name?. I agree. Thanks @sum01 lets merge this.. @CircleCode Thanks. I will check this out using their free acount.. @CircleCode This issue has been fixed in 0.18.0. Please update :) Thanks.. @perry-mitchell when we add an archive on desktop, we actually do step 1, 2 & 3. So it's kind of ready to be turned into QR code to be used by mobile. The one thing we don't have is the Archive Name. On desktop the archive name is the filename... . @perry-mitchell before reading the other comments, I should mention that I use basename(filename) now through out the app. But should we have archive name like mobile? Or can we build it into the core?. Thanks @rezamarandi. This will be fixed in the next release. Does this happen every time you open buttercup?. @4A616D6573 Thanks. Does the app work normally after you close this?. @4A616D6573 @metamorphosis-org-mk @perry-mitchell Providing that files before updating your Buttercup will help us prevent this from happening again! Thanks.. @4A616D6573 yeah, what I suspected... although I have no idea how this has happened.... @perry-mitchell this is definitely possible, however a bit difficult. But I agree that we need to add this quite soon. . Hi @rezamarandi, This is being fixed in the next release.. This is also a duplicate of #81. Closing this in favor of that one. Thanks!. @perry-mitchell @wgregori yes this will be done ~~in~~ with #136 :) ~~This is duplicate of that so will close :) But~~ This will be done when that task is done! Thanks for reporting it @wgregori! Cheers. @perry-mitchell No probs mate. . Thanks @esutton. We are working on a new feature that will allow this. We'll keep this updated.. Thanks @Ravenheart, we'll look into it.. Hi @Ravenheart, is there a way to reproduce this? I tried adding custom fields to my dropbox archive, but it saves normally and doesn't throw any errors. . Hey @Ravenheart, hope you're having a nice weekend. Were you able to reproduce the issue or should we close this for now?. Thank you @probonopd, I was actually wondering what is the correct category for that file. Your description is complete and we will be able to do it as soon as the current WIP is out. Will keep this updated :) . @perry-mitchell I tried requesting the exact same request that Buttercup is doing but in Paw app, and it works. So the remote server is rejecting Buttercup for some reason, maybe referral headers or something? I will try to investigate. @perry-mitchell Found it. This cookie: ocgrd6wpkg2l=d3fe89236f8c2af....; is causing the request to return 503 and fail. I don't know where it comes from. Any ideas?. @perry-mitchell Alright. Came closer to the issue. node-fetch is used in webdav-client (and webdav-fs and in result in Webdav, Owncloud and Nextcloud adapters), and that fails in electron while requesting the nextcloud endpoint because of that cookie which Nextcloud sets in first response. But window.fetch doesnt fail for some reason. . @perry-mitchell the state is only visible if the sidebar is expanded (cmd+B) but not if its condensed. We should add that in condensed mode too. . Thanks @perry-mitchell Thats definitely something that I should have done before.. @jprdev-paderick Did you figure out the issue or is it still damaged / unavailable?. @hd719 you can :). Thanks @montrueque for the contribution. I took your PR and built on top of it #337. Cheers.. @perry-mitchell done. @5k9m Thank you. this seems very odd. Maybe it's related to Electron itself? I'll investigate. But I have to first upgrade to High Sierra myself.. @perry-mitchell It only happens when developing Buttercup in development. Before \"building\" Buttercup, the app is shown as \"Electron\". This can be fixed by checking if process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' and not sending the event altogether. . @ncguc @perry-mitchell this is actually fixed and will come out in next release :) thanks!\nhttps://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/commit/1863bd60f203897133255a7355aee3ba996ccd63. @perry-mitchell isn't this a duplicate of #306?. Due to #362, this is not needed anymore. Closing.. @ElPsyCongro @danyfu @perry-mitchell I'm working on an update, it will come through tonight hopefully. Could you guys please install that and let us know if it's fixed or not? If not, please re-open this issue (this will auto close by the PR). The version will be 0.21.3. Thanks @asood123 for the PR :) Yay! I'm merging this now. Cheers . > Archives are added only if the UI window is already open.\n@perry-mitchell this clarifies it. Thank you. Was all of your data intact after re-opening?. @krominet New version without analytics is out :) . Closed by #400 \n. @lalitsom Thanks. We should do a better job mentioning that we don't support 32bit Windows systems. I understand that there are still users using the 32bit version of Windows, but supporting that will require some additional work from our part and we haven't seen enough users using this version to justify the work. But if there's enough demand, we would consider that perhaps? @perry-mitchell . @lalitsom Here's Windows 32bit support: https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/releases/download/v0.22.0/buttercup-desktop-setup-0.22.0.exe\nPlease download it and let us know how it goes :) . @perry-mitchell Thanks mate. Changed :) . @lalitsom I just tested it. You are right... it's \"supposed\" to come back when you hold the alt key (like normal windows apps) but it didnt happen for me. Does it come back when you hold alt?. @ElPsyCongro Hi! Like my colleague mentioned here, this depends on community interest. if someone is willing to put in the effort for the research etc, we'd appreciate it.. Closed by #400 . Yes. We should just add a Noop handler. @perry-mitchell Actually intro.js is made by my good friend @afshinm :) Would be nice to use it on desktop!. @gellenburg Are you sure this is the same error? Does Buttercup work normally regardless of this?. Hi @asosnovsky, Thanks. This is a know issue and popular request. Closing this since it's a duplicate of #307 . Hi @gellenburg. Is this the same error you were experiencing on v0.22.2 too? Could you give one of the earlier versions a try so we can find what is the issue?\nhttps://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/releases\nIs your Windows 32 bit or 64 bit?. Thanks @ph1p for the great work. I quite like this. It's ok to use react-intl as far as I can see, since obviously its easy to use the translations in non-react files too.\nBefore I review the code, could you check why are the tests failing?. @perry-mitchell @ph1p I'll have a crack at the app veyor thing to see whats dying.. @ph1p Im going to do some commits to your repo if you dont mind. including reverting some of the package.json upgrades. It's too many changes for this PR and maybe its one of them that breaks the whole thing.. @perry-mitchell @ph1p done!. Great work @ph1p. I'm going to merge this :) . Great job @ph1p . @perry-mitchell check for update is there actually\n\nBut \"about\" is not. Adding that + adding more items to tray in an upcoming PR. Thanks @ph1p. I'll test this and if it's fixed then I'll merge :) Cheers. @ph1p looks awesome! I\u2019ll review tomorrow :) thanks . @ph1p because its a broken system :(\n. ~~hmm apparently locales/ru cant be resolved that's why tests fail. need to investigate.~~\nNever mind, it's because the other one isn't merged :). Closing and re-opening to trigger tests. Oh it needs to be updated with master. Thanks guys! Im going to merge this! :). @ph1p Yeah.. I have seen it also. . @yasharayari we are already using react-intl. This issue is just about \u201cdetecting\u201d user\u2019s language instead of setting it to English by default. . @perry-mitchell I guess this can be closed since #420 is merged? \nI don't see any other options other than these:\n\nRemove fsevents and node-sass, which are the main fail points. But a CI system shouldn't care about these so I don't suggest doing this\nMove to another CI system, that supports Windows, but I haven't been able to find one personally. \nWait for AppVeyor to fix it, which is a bit unlikely to happen soon. \n\nSo I say your \"temporary\" solution is rather permanent. lol.. @perry-mitchell this issue seems to be fixed since you last fixed it. closing this again!. @BlueBeniHD @perry-mitchell @ph1p We will release a new version today, we can close this after @BlueBeniHD can confirm that it's gone in that version. I'll update here when the version is out.. @BlueBeniHD glad to know :) closing this \ud83d\udc4d . @BlueBeniHD We have a backlog of important bugs and issues that we have to attend to and we are only two people working on Buttercup. This is definitely an important issue which we will do at some point, but meanwhile a PR is welcome too :). @amin3mej Thanks. Im merging this into persian-translation branch for now since it still needs more work! But thanks for helping with the translation :). @ph1p Hey man, sorry for the delay, we have been busy a bit with other things, but finally back on this. I'll review this tonight :). @perry-mitchell @ph1p Thanks guys. merging! \ud83c\udf89. @amin3mej Thanks for the great work. This is now going into master.. @Akimace Out of curiosity, what is the behavior for the apps that do this? What do you need to do to an app so it ends up there? And what happens when you click on it?. @perry-mitchell so it's similar to running in macOS dock then? If so we can add that context menu to macOS dock at the same time too.\n\n. @perry-mitchell I think we should close this as we didn't hear back, and also maybe we're changing the illustrations soon to the new ones that we bought?. @Hedronmx There is an option already in Buttercup: View -> Auto-Hide Menubar\ndoes that work for you?. @Hedronmx true! I will fix this in next release :). @perry-mitchell then this is a huge problem. since we had those queues, it seems that they are not written to the queue. If you dont close the app immediately, are they written correctly?. ok so when I call workspace save, it has three steps for saving:\nsends an \"enqueue\" event to main thread which starts a promise inside the queue (of main thread), then the main thread's new promise sends back an ipc event to the \"sender\" window which is the 1st step in your instructions, which causes that to do the saving and then send back an event to main thread saying that its finished. but when you close the dropbox window too fast, it never gets a chance to tell the main thread that it finished that task (via an ipc event), so the task remains forever running in main thread's queue.\nthe solution is: we add the \"please wait, saving\" to the window close event, not the app close event.. Thanks @hugo-cardenas. I kind of like the square more... Since most \"favicon\"s are actually square. In square one the logos are more visible and clear in my opinion. What do you think @perry-mitchell . @hugo-cardenas the last point for me is to just maybe change the icons to square, otherwise im completely happy with this! I'll merge as soon as that's changed.. @perry-mitchell I think what @hugo-cardenas means is what is the original image type in the first place? is it definitly always PNG?. @perry-mitchell yes, so can't iconographer also return that part (the mime type) as well?. @perry-mitchell @hugo-cardenas Thanks guys! Im merging this! Hurray!. @hugo-cardenas sorry saw your comment too late. it's fixed now in master. @michaelcurry having the menu \"say something\" maybe in grayed out text would be nice to guide the user. I agree this is a bit confusing. Thanks!. @mannp Did this happen the first time you installed the app? You have never used Buttercup before? \nAlso can you please try unlocking the archives using the password: 1 to see if it unlocks?. @mannp Could you do us a favor?\nDelete your copy and:\n1- Install from AUR again, to see if the issue is still there\n2- Delete the AUR again and this time download a copy from our Github releases page to see if it's any different.\nThanks.. @mannp That npm test is what's creating those archives. Ping @sum01.\nIf the npm test can not be removed from the arch PKGBUILD then I'll have to add a cleanup phase to the tests. But the thing is tests are creating the archives in user's data directory which in theory \"should not\" end up in the resulting archive.... @mannp can you verify that it works?\n@sum01 I need to fix the master. we reverted and package versions are now different.. Hi @GabrielCoelho can you please rebase from master? We have reverted master since you created this PR. sorry for the trouble.. Hi @GabrielCoelho \nNo problem :)\nActually from the state of things, it would be nicer if you close this PR and open a new one if that's ok with you.\nThanks. Happy New Year!. Hi @crazypingoo94. \nWhere is your nextcloud instance hosted? Are you using a self-signed certificate for that?. @perry-mitchell done :) . Thanks @FlorentinDUBOIS this is a great idea.. Hi there!\nWe have a file for that: https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/blob/master/src/renderer/system/shortcuts.js\nYou can add a shortcut here and use redux and  getArchiveManager() to find the active archive and lock it. \nThanks!. @sum01 @ziltoidtheomiscient I have not tested actually building \"on\" a linux machine. The builds are done on a macOS machine for all platforms. I will look into this.. @sum01 sorry I have been taking a few days off. What do I need to do to fix it?. @perry-mitchell this 7zip dep is always causing trouble lol. I think its electron-builder that installs it. I think it's removed when we were trying to update some deps or something. @sum01 That's good to hear :) Let's close this and re-open if there is an issue again. Thanks.. Thanks @regoremor this is a dupe of #416 so I'll close this in favor of that. We'll try to look into it soon. . Hi @umutkacar That is very unusual. I will look that up. Thank you.. Thanks @carlmrichter, I should have ignored casing before sorting. I will fix that.. @alireza-ahmadi it's available. Feel free to take it :) . @alireza-ahmadi there is a generic sort function on buttercup, it can be done there so its applied everywhere. Hi @popey. Thanks for this. \nWhat is the benefit of snap over other versions? I'm not a linux user myself that's why Im asking.\n. @perry-mitchell @popey I can test the release locally :) Should we merge @perry-mitchell?. Hi @moulip \nCould you please paste some parts of Buttercup log here so we can debug?\n\non Linux: ~/.config/Buttercup/log.log\non OS X: ~/Library/Logs/Buttercup/log.log\non Windows: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Buttercup\\log.log\n. @moulip Thanks. Your issue looks like this:\nhttps://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/2364\nI'll investigate.. Hi @moulip, can you try updating to v1.0.1 manually to see if this issue is still there?. @moulip By the way, are you using Linux?. Which file did you use to install Buttercup? Currently only the AppImage provides auto-updating . @moulip That makes sense. I think our auto-update only supports AppImage on Linux. Can you give that a try?. @moulip It's this one: https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/releases/download/v1.2.2/buttercup-desktop-1.2.2-x86_64.AppImage \nIt's usually found from the releases page. I think we need to do a better job at clarifying this.. Thanks @GabrielCoelho for your great contribution! this will go out with the next release!. Thanks. You can move unit tests to their own folder under tests directory and do a change like this in npm scripts:\n\ndiff\n-    \"test\": \"npm run ava && npm run lint\",\n+    \"test\": \"npm run test:unit && npm run test:gui && npm run lint\",\n+    \"test:gui\": \"npm run build && cross-env NODE_ENV=test ava test/gui/**\",\n+    \"test:unit\": \"cross-env NODE_ENV=test ava test/unit/**\",. @alireza-ahmadi It can be:\n<project-root>/test/unit/collection.js. @perry-mitchell crypto stuff are quick yes... There is a lag in the desktop application which is quite general. but MAYBE thats the redux store syncing or something... maybe we should rename this issue or close it for now?. Thanks @alirezavalizade. Is there any performance issues with PureComponent or is it fast?. Thanks @alirezavalizade @perry-mitchell. Merging this \ud83d\udc4d . Thank you for your contribution. Some strings are missing from the translation, could you check those as well?. Hi there.\nThe white screen is supposed to be dropbox.com. Can you open Developer Tools on that window with the white screen (Cmd+Alt+I) and reload the page (Cmd+R) and let us know what you see in the network tab?\nThanks. @perry-mitchell I agree, and done!. @perry-mitchell done: https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/pull/527. @mannp this will be fixed in next release. @gschoenberger Changing of the entry icon is not possible yet. But if you add a custom field called \"URL\" and put a URL in there, it will load an icon for that url.\n\n. Thanks @moulip, I've done a fix for that. We'll try to get it in soon. \nhttps://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/pull/506. @darsain This should be actually in version v1.1.0. The issue is still happening? can you give us a bit more info?. @darsain so the issue happens when you \"click\" on the item with no icon? that should not be related to the icons AFAIK. But I'll try to reproduce this. Can you please open an issue for this with the same information so we can track and work on it?. Thanks @farskid Closing this in favor of #517. Will try to focus on this next and find a solution.. Finally!. @perry-mitchell what is ditto? :D. @perry-mitchell Telegram is using Squirrel for macOS and electron is using the same but electron cant have the nice GUI in native mac apps :( I'll look into finding another solution for updates. We're currently using this which makes it possible to update Linux and Windows in addition to macOS, also supports Github releases which we are using: https://www.electron.build/auto-update\nBut maybe the version that we're using is old and unstable. I'll look into it. But I like your suggestion about a new flow. Maybe we shouldn't be updating automatically right?. @perry-mitchell I suggest we find a tested and ready-made solution or fix the current one (maybe it's my implementation that is broken and not the solution itself) instead of investing in time implementing it ourselves. I haven't seen any electron apps to do this on their own. The update functionality is built into electron core itself: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/auto-updater.md\nThe package im using is just a high level wrapper.\nI think these errors are happening because im not handling errors and recovering from them correctly.\nPs. We're not using \"Shipit\" at all. It's built in to Electron internals (because of squirrel). @perry-mitchell Well I fully agree with changing the flow. At least we should give the user the possibility to opt-in to downloading automatically. Plus, while it's downloading, we should show a progress indicator and also catch the errors nicely.. @perry-mitchell A proxy for downloading the icons doesn't sound so bad. It certainly makes things easier. We should also look into settings... we can add a setting item for enabling/disabling it, so when we add the settings UI, the user can turn it off perhaps?. @ph1p I think that checkbox can be removed... We have changed the way icons work in the latest PR #744 . @darsain yup it froze:\n\nI'll investigate.. @darsain @perry-mitchell released: https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/releases/tag/v1.2.2. @pelonchasva @toniobido what happens when you click on one of the extra items?. I think the temporary solution is removing them and adding them again. I know this is not a solution but it's also unlikely for it to happen again. We changed the internals of how archive manager works, and for some reason this issue has been happening. But this change fixed some other problematic issues.. I will anyway investigate to see what's causing it, but the problem is it's hard to reproduce.. @darsain could you open another issue for these two problems so we can tackle them separately?. Thanks @mannp that's a great idea :) . @mannp Can you press Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+I and open developer tools to see if there's any errors in the console?. @mannp Thanks! I will look into it soon :) . This is a dupe of #520. Thanks for reporting it though. Seeing that it's a critical issue, we'll fix it soon.. Thanks! This is a dupe of #314 and #136. Closing this in favor of those :) \nPs. we're working on it!. Hi. this is a dupe of #517. closing in favor of that one. I'm going to try to focus on this next. Thanks :). @darsain So size is not remembered? It's currently implemented and should remember it... If it doesn't then it's a separate bug. @darsain you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll do the change. @darsain next release will reduce it to 500 :) . Thanks @ph1p! Can we add a safety check to this? What happens if you have this on your 3rd monitor and you disconnect your screens and re-open buttercup? Will it be moved out of bounds or does electron prevent it from getting moved to far?. @ph1p Awesome!. Thanks @ph1p . Thanks @icetee, we have recently added a few new strings. Could you add those as well before we merge this?. @jenstornell unfortunately for now you can just right click on the items in sidebar and remove them from your buttercup. But this shouldn't be happening.\nI'll look into this ASAP.. @darsain Can I send you a windows executable of my change, so you can test this?. @darsain here's the installer: https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/share/DHG2JSFHGDkZA3JFvy1z172HBuQpY9ewn8X5AtgynXY. > and when it already is in the list it should just get activated.\n@darsain well this one is a separate issue that you mentioned before. so that's for another time. but right now the archive should get added to the list like a normal double-click. I'll check what's wrong.. @darsain updated the code: https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/share/3qq9gRSxjAlNOFs1gggPc9oA3OgMPdxibTIl00jCnR4 this time it should open the file. @darsain we're doing it quite early.. not sure what is happening before it?. @fmommeja this issue is fixed in 1.3, so you'll need to probably manually install 1.3 if the update doesn't work. Im going to close this since it's a bug in < 1.3 and not fixed in 1.3, but if you update to 1.3 and still have a problem, please reopen :) thanks. This is related to #136 and #314.\n@perry-mitchell this looks like a good solution to our UI problem?\nwe can also rename the current \"search...\" on top of the entries list to \"filter...\" (so it works on the current list). @ph1p can you open a PR so we can discuss there? since this is a code-related discussion and not an actual issue. then we can close this one and mention those are tasks from the PR. You can also make the search to include the other open archives as well. it's what buttercup browser extension does, so its nice to have the same experience.. @ph1p how does the icon look on mac (light/dark), windows and linux?. @ph1p thanks. I feel like the images can be higher quality though... They look a bit blurry... Can I help with that? Do you need a specific size or format?\n. Actually the quality is ok on mac:\n\nThere is a problem though, when I right click on the menubar Item, it takes a few tries to get rid of the popup menu... Dont know why\n. @perry-mitchell @ph1p yeah I agree. Can we give the actual square icon a try on windows and linux? I think it'll look good on small sizes too. @perry-mitchell clicking on the icon opens buttercup, right clicking shows brings up that menu (as per usual in menu bar apps). @ph1p I pushed a change to your branch :D sorry. @ph1p is this PR ready?. ~There is a bug. When a save is going on, and you choose \"Quit\" from the menu, only the window closes, but it doesnt quit the app because of the new setting you added in window-all-closed event... But if no save is going on, then you can quit without a problem. Trying to fix it...~\nNever mind. Fixed it. . Thanks @pleswi! this is awesome. We have recently added some new strings to English again, could you please add those as well?. @perry-mitchell adding password strength meter #531 requires re-designing this unlock dialog. Perhaps they can be done together with this. @perry-mitchell yes, I just added all three issues to a milestone which can be bundled together in the future.. Hi @moulip. Im sorry to hear that. I think the only way now would be if I install Debian Buster myself and test it out.. @moulip @perry-mitchell I might have an idea... the AppImage that is stored in Github releases is not executable. It needs chmod a+x command to be run... maybe that's whats happening?. Approved by @perry-mitchell ad-hoc. Alright, before moving on with this, let's gather a bit of data. What is the \"usual\" behavior on:\n\nMac Apps\nWindows Apps\n\nAnd put the data here, maybe we can have the app behave differently on each OS based on the data.. Ok, lets do so on all platforms:\n\nleft click: open buttercup\nright click: show menu. Im going to fix some bugs for Linux, and I will fix this issue also at the same time. Closing this. Thanks!. @perry-mitchell @Zjemm based on my knowledge AppImage actually doesnt extract anywhere and just runs like an executable... I have to investigate further.. @perry-mitchell changed :) . This should be fixed in #592. @perry-mitchell I'll take a look at this. I just need to reinstall my VM. @gschoenberger If you remove the file from Buttercup Desktop and re-add it again, it should start working again. Right @perry-mitchell? (The release to fix this issue is coming in a few minutes). @perry-mitchell Yes I agree. So you mean just showing everything below each other or having different separators?. Hi @perry-mitchell @Megilla, I'm trying to fix the Tray issues. However before releasing, could you please confirm that it works? I have uploaded the patched version here. Let me know if they work... Thanks!\n\ndeb: https://send.firefox.com/download/a63dd8caf9/#SAa0pYNWdu_CLf4fdNZjRw\nrpm: https://send.firefox.com/download/1af462534c/#3Iz94sLMhczKbRFRCYuL1w\n. @perry-mitchell @Megilla This is actually not a bug... Dragging and dropping entries into groups is not currently supported. So adding it would fix this issue too.. @Hedronmx By updating do you mean installing it yourself manually? As @perry-mitchell mentioned auto-updating is not possible with deb files. This is done.. Hey mate, this is one of the fixes in the latest PR. It will be gone with the next release :). Fixed by #592 . Hi @arunikayadav42! Welcome. What kind of help are you looking for?. @n8v8R @jdrch if these two issues are the same should we close this in favor of the other one?\nWe released a new version of Buttercup last night which uses the latest version of Electron. Could you please try that as well?. @wxkylem we are working hard to fix this problem and we're very troubled by it too. we're sorry that this is happening.. @wxkylem Thanks for checking this. Then this is related to the ongoing issue on mobile: https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-mobile/issues/78\nI'll close this and we can track the progress there! . @robbinhan this looks like an issue with npm... can you try again?. @robbinhan I tested master a few times and it works. Can you check one more time and if it doesn't work, would you be able to tell us the OS you're using?\nAlso, it seems like when you npm install there are a few errors related to what you have shown in the logs, but those are harmless.. I'm closing this issue since we havent heard from you and the master works in different systems. Please let us know if it's still broken so we can re-open.. Hi @Sblop, this is something we are thinking about right now. We will update this issue with more information once we have more info :) . @sum01 I think I messed up and forgot to merge a branch :( Can you try master again?. That's new from npm @sum01, I fixed most of the issues, I'll fix the rest soon. Some packages haven't released any updates. @sum01 I did tag it again. Can you check if it works?. Thanks @fortym2 . @Akimace Hi! Can you explain a bit more what do you mean by Zoom Out?. @aesthicc @perry-mitchell \nI like the idea about changing Cmd+N to creating a new entry instead of a new archive, since we wont be creating new archives so often. I think I'll do that soon.\nAbout the letter capture on keyboard, I understand it would make it more \"native\"-looking and I would love to have it. For example like in Mac's finder or Windows explorer when you start typing in a list, the relevant item gets highlighted or scrolled into view. However we don't have enough bandwidth for that right now as there are a multitude of other issues to be fixed. I'd appreciate it if someone could add that as a PR :) . Closes in favor of #522. @perry-mitchell Hey mate could you try 1.9.0 to see if it has the same issue? The Electron version is bumped to its latest so it might have solved this too. I\u2019m guessing that Windows ignores attempts at copying an empty string to clipboard, which is how we clear the clipboard. We should definitely improve this. Wondering if Electron provides any APIs to clear the clipboard. \nBut also we can\u2019t really clear their entire history. Can we?. @perry-mitchell by referencing they mean inserting a pointer to a field in another entry. For example this is a feature in Keepass or other software like Paw (for REST resting). Instead of typing a value directly in the entry, you can \"insert a reference\" that points to a field of another entry. So when the other entry's password changes, all the entries that have a reference to that field will update. Because the values are references not copies.. Hi @leongrdic, could you please update Buttercup and see if the new version works for you? The latest version is 1.9.0. @leongrdic cheers! closing this now.. @conovor This is not currently supported. I'll mark this as available so hopefully either we would have more time and bandwidth to do it or someone else will send a PR :) . @perry-mitchell fortunately we are using redux-form so we can persist the data and show it again later, but IMO showing a dialog to confirm navigating away is a better option. Because the goal here would be to prevent the user from \"forgetting\" right?. This issue isn't fixed in master. So won't be included in release notes.. @pelonchasva so in the new version the password shows up as raw text?. @pelonchasva We fixed the issue and will release 1.10.0 soon! Watch out for new updates :). Hi @conovor. Thanks a lot. Yes this is an issue. We will update this task with more information once we start working on it :) . @svenvdvoort @trojkolka thanks a lot! Merging this :) . On hold, until we know what this option exactly do.\nAwaiting answer: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/3188#issuecomment-411085862. Hi @phineas0fog thanks for letting us know. I will look into this, since I havent used Archlinux before and we haven't this error in other systems, I have to research a bit.\nThanks\nSallar. Hi @Jaimefs. So if you download a previous release the problem goes away?. Hey @bogdansuditu thanks :)\nI understand. This is something that we're working on. We're changing the way we display the fields and this issue will be fixed once that's implemented :) We'll update this issue.. @perry-mitchell added a bit more details. @perry-mitchell great idea we can add the option when we have the settings panel too.. Thanks @idreamsi . @perry-mitchell all the tests are failing for some reason. I'll investigate. @zengxp0605 can you please press ctrl+shift+I and see if there's any errors in the console tab of the developer console that shows up?. Hi @Thomazella!\nA mobile version is available for Android and iOS. You can find it from here: https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-mobile\nWe are working on a redesign of our UIs starting with the browser extensions. But we welcome any UX related discussions and ideas :). Hi @antoine-amara again :) did you get a chance to look at my comment? \nThanks!. @antoine-amara the tests are failing :) please have a look:\nhttps://travis-ci.org/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/builds/458136631?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification. @antoine-amara Thanks for the PR. However we were thinking about a way more similar to the password strength meter that is already inside the \"Create new Entry\" page (a progress bar?). What do you think? . @perry-mitchell this looks good! should we also change the existing strength meter to use this one? We currently use this: https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn. @antoine-amara I'm so sorry that I need to close this PR without merging it. With the way the password dialog was designed before, we couldn't add a \"strength meter\" to the dialog. So I had to re-code the dialog in #744 and I added a strength meter there. \nI hope this doesn't put you off and you will contribute to Buttercup again. Cheers.. @perry-mitchell @esutton usually it should realize it's the same archive... we can investigate. Thanks. Hi @manzing \nAccessing local file-system is not currently possible through browsers. This is due to security reasons and is a limitation enforced by the browser makers.\nHowever we are thinking about a solution to connect the browser extension to our desktop client so you would be able to read the vaults directly from the desktop app.. There are some failing checks which I need to check before merging. Im guessing its from our side.. Hi @evandandrea thanks! We had snap support but we had to remove it a while ago because it was failing to build on macOS using electron builder... have you tried that?. @evandandrea then maybe it's fixed. I'll give it a go again :) . @evandandrea I tried it again, and this is the error im getting:\nSorry, an error occurred in Snapcraft:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/bin/snapcraft\", line 11, in <module>\n    load_entry_point('snapcraft==2.43.1', 'console_scripts', 'snapcraft')()\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 722, in __call__\n    return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 697, in main\n    rv = self.invoke(ctx)\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 1066, in invoke\n    return _process_result(sub_ctx.command.invoke(sub_ctx))\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 895, in invoke\n    return ctx.invoke(self.callback, **ctx.params)\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 535, in invoke\n    return callback(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/usr/lib/python3.5/contextlib.py\", line 77, in __exit__\n    self.gen.throw(type, value, traceback)\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 87, in augment_usage_errors\n    yield\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/click/core.py\", line 535, in invoke\n    return callback(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/snapcraft/cli/lifecycle.py\", line 187, in prime\n    _execute(steps.PRIME, parts, **kwargs)\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/snapcraft/cli/lifecycle.py\", line 97, in _execute\n    project_config = project_loader.load_config(project)\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/snapcraft/internal/project_loader/__init__.py\", line 36, in load_config\n    return Config(project)\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/snapcraft/internal/project_loader/_config.py\", line 233, in __init__\n    build_tools=self.build_tools,\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/snapcraft/internal/project_loader/_parts_config.py\", line 55, in __init__\n    self._process_parts()\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/snapcraft/internal/project_loader/_parts_config.py\", line 86, in _process_parts\n    self.load_part(part_name, plugin_name, properties)\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/snapcraft/internal/project_loader/_parts_config.py\", line 206, in load_part\n    definitions_schema=self._validator.definitions_schema,\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/snapcraft/internal/pluginhandler/_plugin_loader.py\", line 79, in load_plugin\n    plugin.enable_cross_compilation()\n  File \"/snap/snapcraft/current/legacy_snapcraft/lib/python3.5/site-packages/snapcraft/_baseplugin.py\", line 188, in enable_cross_compilation\nthats why we removed it earlier... :( . Thanks for the update @wyudong please let us know so we can reopen if it happens again :) . Hi @tourtools we have already added this to the browser extension (since it's a new feature in core), but we are working on adding it to the desktop app too :) Stay tuned!. @DrGeek we do have our own set of icons ready to use, however the issue is not which icons to use, it's just that we need to think about how to do this in a way that is intuitive and easy to use.. @blimmo @perry-mitchell I accidentally commented about this on the wrong thread \ud83d\ude02 https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/1580#issuecomment-439060293 but that question is for @blimmo actually. Does this happen when you click on Download or does it happen when the app tries to check for updates?\nYou can see that this is the same error that is mentioned in that issue.. @perry-mitchell great idea :) on it. @perry-mitchell Added. Now you can double click or drag to select the code like a normal text and CMD/Ctrl+C to copy :) . Hey Phil. Travis is dying for no reason. Thanks!. Thanks man :). This looks awesome! Good work :) . @LukasWerfel go for it :) . @perry-mitchell if I remember correctly the first version had a group path. I will go dig it up to see if it was removed or something. . @perry-mitchell it also looks like that Firefox is expecting https requests?. Windows is code signed and released: 1.14.0 :) . @n8v8R this warning will go away once more users start to install it. It shows our company name now. But because it\u2019s not a EV (expensive) cert it will take a while to be fully trusted :). The issue is caused by electron-builder a damaged file randomly. I ran the build again with the exact same config as before and it fixed the issue. I'm building a new patch and uploading it now, hopefully we can have a look at it to see why did it break.. This issue is fixed in the latest release. That's interesting @skion, so none of Buttercup's menu items are visible? Is that a custom skin on your Ubuntu or is it something that comes by default?. Seems like this is an issue with Electron. I'll investigate updating the electron dependency to see if it fixes the issue.\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/pull/15878\nFor this I'll need to also install Ubuntu 18. Seems like this is not released yet by Electron. We will have to wait for their fix.. @perry-mitchell we can maybe put this under a flag? For example if you run buttercup using a command line flag eg. --debug?. @perry-mitchell great idea!. @perry-mitchell this looks good to me, are you happy with it too mate?. @perry-mitchell this is interesting.. I guess not :( . Looks good to me for now too!. I agree with @perry-mitchell a coloured output would be much nicer. Thanks @derek-li, however this is breaking the tests since it's adding one extra button and the button count is now off. Could you please have a look at the tests as well?. @derek-li Im re-running Appveyor to see whatsup. @perry-mitchell any input on this mate?. @perry-mitchell done mate. Now using the Fragment shorthand to void importing it (and react has official support for shorthand). Thank you very much :). Hi, thank you. But this is a dupe of #690. Closing in favour of that issue. . Hey @rwolf449 any updates on this by any chance?. Hi there! Can you remove the archive from Buttercup Desktop (right click on it and click remove) and add it again to see if it helps?. This one throws an error, have you tried it?\n\n. I understand this is not pretty, but don't know what would be test best way to handle it. Any suggestions?\n. Extra console.log here? \n. I think it would be a good idea to merge from master, since this file has already been added in the other PR.\n. console.log\n. I had removed This cannot be undone part since the entries will be moved to trash now.\n. Beautiful. Oh yes finally. Ah yeah @perry-mitchell . @perry-mitchell this one is for the password dialog component (swal) to handle and it wants a promise. the await thingie is for the result of that :D. @perry-mitchell you are right sir. I commented this out temporarily. uncommenting again :) . Ah sure this was a merge conflict. \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\ude31. No, this catch is only for the password dialog \"cancel\" event.. Yeah, the UI disables everything when this happens. Only thing user can do is wait \ud83d\ude02. That is handled by the dialog (it shows the error message). The dialog is a but weird . @perry-mitchell if this is set to false, the user can still bring the menu up by pressing alt. From the docs:\n\nSets whether the menu bar should be visible. If the menu bar is auto-hide, users can still bring up the menu bar by pressing the single Alt key.\n\nBut I personally thing we should make this toggle-able by having a menu item in View menu for example labled \"Auto Hide Menubar\" which should only be available in windows.. Yes it does :) @perry-mitchell . @perry-mitchell done mate. @perry-mitchell I named it after the method that sets it, but yeah we can change it. menubarVisible sounds good. @perry-mitchell if we didnt use lodash anywhere else I would use this, maybe I'll remove lodash dep in the future as its really heavy. @perry-mitchell I think those already existed in .eslintrc before prettier era.. I have added \"prettier\" preset so all these extra overrides should be removed from here including this one. But I think this changed was not made by @snhasani . Why is Untitled changed to Untitle?. Is there a reason why all the handlers now have _ at the beginning? I know it makes private methods obvious but let's keep the repo's convention for now, what do you think?. Its not menu creation. Everytime the store updates (any action regardless of it having anything to do with menu or not) this re-draws the menu which is slightly heavy process. And sometimes this function (subcribed function) gets called 20 times in 100ms. So just wanted to avoid performance issues and lags . Does uglifyJS support ES6 which we are using? I think the reason I used Babili was that it was the only one that supported ES6 out of the box.. Can you remove this unused comments?. Can we move this to devDependencies? Since it will be compiled to the final package. Is this diff block because you moved this constant to the setup function?. Can you use the showDialog function in renderer/system/dialog.js?. I think this wont work when compiled. Since the paths will change. in menu.js I do this for resolving: path.resolve(__dirname, `../resources/icons/${item.icon}.png`) and I think this should be similar.. Also, why does the user need to relaunch the program? wont react-intl change the texts in place? . Also can we use .map here? \njs\nconst translations = config.availableLanguages.map(lang => require(...));. @ph1p We do that when a new archive is added. For example I call it everytime the store gets updated: store.subscribe(debounce(() => setupMenu(store), 500));. So this should also update the language already if everything's setup correctly. @RakotStargazer @dmmmd Hide and Reveal is used in hiding and revealing passwords:\n\n. Yes, but also \"reveal\" and \"hide\" are used in the \"eye\" button next to it:\njs\n            <Button\n              icon={this.state.concealed ? <EyeIcon /> : <EyeSlashIcon />}\n              title={\n                this.state.concealed\n                  ? intl.formatMessage({\n                      id: 'reveal',\n                      defaultMessage: 'Reveal'\n                    })\n                  : intl.formatMessage({\n                      id: 'hide',\n                      defaultMessage: 'Hide'\n                    })\n              }\n              onClick={() => this.handleReveal()}\n            />. Can you move this to devDependencies please?. This key needs to be changed in all other locales as well then. Cool thanks.. Is it possible for you to use git mv instead of mv for moving template files so the git history on the files wont be lost? It seems that fr.json is deleted and created again.. Also what is the difference between template.json and translation.json?. This block is wrong. It should be checking if its \"not\" available, then use default:\njs\nif (!(locale in languages)) {\n  locale = 'en';\n}. Cant you just do {{os}} here?.

Oops!. ^. Im good with both approaches. @hugo-cardenas @perry-mitchell I like it too. If it doesn't interfere with other menus that we have. Instead of doing this, we can perhaps do styled-components:\njs\nconst EntryIcon = styled.div`\n  background-image: `url(${props => props.icon ? props.icon : defaultIcon})`;\n`\netc. Since we are trying to use styled-components in the project instead of css. @hugo-cardenas can I get a screenshot of this in action?. how fast is this function going to be? Can't we load the icons async?. @hugo-cardenas we have a module called electron-log which we are using to log stuff to user's userData directory. lol I have no idea what is going on here! :D @perry-mitchell @hugo-cardenas . @hugo-cardenas you can use this lock from Google Material Icon Set which we also use in Buttercuo Mobile:\nic-lock-48px.svg.zip\n. make this conditional: this.props.active ? 'CmdOrCtrl+l' : null, because if the archive is not active, the shortcut wont work.. @perry-mitchell yeah, this was added by @hugo-cardenas and we discussed it in the initial PR. it adds some useful stuff -> https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/pull/454#discussion_r155945312. Good catch. @perry-mitchell actually this was intentional, so for example if the user sees this view again, the image will change to a new one. I have some mac apps that do this and it's really nice. so you don't have to quit the app to see a new one. what do you think?. done. Thats what the first few lines do. This is straight out of electron\u2019s docs. \n. You can just directly put the menu items here.  You don't need to update them later. That is for the cases where that menu is dynamic. styled('p') -> styled.p. Instead of this ternary operator, you can use <Choose> and <When>, we have been using them in other files\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/jsx-control-statements. These should be in a redux action, and here you would only trigger that action instead of calling them individually.. Instead of listening to ipc actions direction in the component, use getUIState and setUIState action and selector to toggle between search states, and pass that value here so you can display the component based on that value: {searchVisible && <ArchiveSearch /> for example. And in renderer/index.js you would listen to the ipc:\njs\nipc.on('open-archive-search', () => {\n  store.dispatch(setUIState('searchVisible', true));\n});\n. Yeah if you click out or press esc it closes the box. Why are you passing store to this function but not using it?. Why is there space added before : and ??. Also here. And here. @fmommeja excuse my ignorance then! thanks :) . Second instance is just basically the second running instance regardless of version. But I imagine we can configure the behavior by manually checking the versions and alerting the user or something? But if so, lets create an issue for it and fix it separately . @sum01 Is this the .desktop file version or the app version?. Please remove the new translations except English. This is up to collaborators to add the correct translations. I see that you have used Google Translate for these which is not correct :) . This should be handled in the redux actions file. Search the project for showConfirmDialog usages to see how it's done in other places. It should not be handled inside the presentation components.. You can get currentEntry and currentEntryMode here directly using getState and the selector functions, no need to pass them in from the UI component. . You can convert all event methods to this format\nsuggestion\n  selectListItem = (selectedItem) => {\nThis way you won't have to bind them in the constructor :) . See ref related comment below. Use function refs:\nsuggestion\n                  ref={el => this.searchEntryList = el}\nand on the class you can add a property like so:\n```js\nclass ArchiveSearch extends PureComponent {\nsearchEntryList = null;\n\n```. @ph1p the performance difference is negligible. We are using it everywhere else. Also can we add a check to show this only in production? What do you think @perry-mitchell? \njs\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === \"production\") {. @perry-mitchell you're right. its fine if it's everywhere. This is a regression from a previous fix. #730 Will this button be clickable enough?. @perry-mitchell LAZINESS \ud83d\ude02. Why is this deleted? this is important for saving unsaved data. Check the rest of the file for this appTriedToQuit. This is duplicated. @rwolf449 Then we have to figure out a way to fix it, not remove it. Since all OS's rely on this setting to NOT quit if the tray icon is enabled.. ",
    "lietu": "Why wouldn't you want this enabled by default? You could likely stop unintentional clears by reading the clipboard contents first and confirming it's the same as what was last copied there.\nThis is imo a basic security feature in all password managers that should be enabled by default.. I agree @perry-mitchell, the default on other apps seems to be 10s.. It didn't work for me.

Seems like this is a thing with Chrom* having hardcoded handling for certain key bindings, at least on Windows:\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/issues/7165\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/issues/7040\nLooks like a workaround is on the renderer-side to do some window.addEventListener('keyup', ..., true); type thing or use Mousetrap as suggested by Electron docs:\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/keyboard-shortcuts.md#shortcuts-within-a-browserwindow\nI was at least able to get the event for Ctrl+C on the renderer side.. That would make the keyboard shortcuts work, but be less useful. I.e. people would not find them intuitive, which is an important bit about keyboard shortcuts. The solution should follow the principle of least astonishment imo.\nI think likely the correct solution is to set up some sort of keyboard shortcut definition somewhere that can be reused both when building the menu (if for no other reason just to show the shortcuts correctly) and on the renderer-side using Mousetrap. It's a bit of extra work, but if done well it shouldn't be THAT much extra work.\nIf you want, I can try to take a look at how that kind of a solution could be implemented? No promises on schedule though.. ",
    "hugo-cardenas": "Taking this!. So now after reading a bit of code...\nYour idea is, using Iconographer with a file-based icon storage, process entries on update/creation.\nThis would create image files stored in disk under the application resources folder (similar as where the Redux state is stored).\nAlso on entry deletion, the icon would have to be removed.\nOn entry load, it would need to load also all the existing related images and inject them in the entry objects (as base64 strings?), which would be read and displayed by the corresponding React component.\nCorrect until here?\nNow some concerns:\nFormats and encoding\nDisclaimer: I'm not an expert here, so I had to read some stuff about encodings, still homework to do.\nIconographer gets just a buffer with the image data (binary) when node-fetching.\n\n\nWhy do we need to encode/decode in the icon storage before saving/reading from disk? I understand that when loading the entries in order to pass them to React, at that point, we want to have a data-url? So at some point there is the need to convert binary -> string. But I see only this conversion, once. Not two ways back and forth.\n\n\nWhere does svg play into this? Are the image binaries fetched always svg, so that when converting binary -> string, I would then make a data url like data:image/svg+xml;base64,<here the img value foo bar> ?\n\n\nUI\n\nWhat did you have in mind? I think the best would be to show the icon on the entry list (left of each name) and then also on the entry view/form section, somehow on top.\nSomething like this (I just hacked it from the DevTools)\n\n\n. Ok, here is now some first version of this.\nPlease @perry-mitchell @sallar tell me what you think.\nYou can give it a go in your environments, see how it looks like.\nStill pending concerns are:\n- Those specific image encoding/format concerns.\n\n\nI thought about deleting the icons on entry removal. But it is not that straightforward, because you could have several entries with the same icon, so you'd need to loop through all entries, even through all archives (would this be even possible, if they are locked) and check that no other entry is using the same url before deleting.\nIn the end it felt not worthy to implement. What is the worst case, the user gets to have some extra unused 10-100 small icons in the Application folder? Doesn't sound like a big deal to me.\n\n\nJust noticed that some icon processing should also be executed on the background, probably when unlocking an archive, which would go through each entry and check if it has an icon.\nOtherwise, users with existing entries would only get icons for them when updating each entry.\n\n\nI also commented several things in the PR code.. What were you thinking about this, UX wise? \n\nShould the new across-folders search completely replace per-folder search, just with the same UI?\nIn case yes, as the results would be potentially a mix of entries from all folders, should it visually \"deselect\" the folder previously selected?\nAlso, when selecting each of the entries in search results, should it mark its parent folder as selected, to show to which folder it belongs?\nAnother fully different alternative (as 1Password does, for example) is having instead a dynamically generated \"All items\" folder, so that actually the search would just work the same as it does now, only that you would select that folder if you would want to search across all (not sure if this plays well with how entries are stored in buttercup-core)\n. Hi guys!\nFinally I get to give a hand with Buttercup. I thought to pick this as a first simple and boring task, to get going with an easy one and find my way around the project.\n\nEdit: now I just noticed this would hugely conflict with the PR above. I'll rather wait for that and pick something else, but I can still do this later.. Hi! I created already a PR (#446) in order to discuss better the format as I change things.\nI nested the items for the window menu in the English config for now.\nAre you guys ok with the structure like this?\nAlso, I noticed there were some items used in multiple contexts (e.g. hide, copy, etc). At the moment, for those used from menu + somewhere else, I kept them duplicate, in the new menu structure, and in their original place, used somewhere else.\nI believe it would be better not to reuse items in different contexts, even though they might happen to contain the same value.\nIf later some UI element is removed/changed, when you remove/change the locale items with it, it's nicer if you don't risk breaking other things which use the same item. \nWhat do you think?. I'm done now with the app-menu category for all languages. Should we wrap-up this PR for a start, in order to keep them smaller? I can continue with the others after that.\nAlso:\n\nTaking the english version as the master config, I did JSON diffs with each of the others in order to double check any possible mistakes, and noticed there are several entries missing from most of the other languages. I synced them, meaning that I added all the missing entries with the english value to each of the other languages, but now different people should review those again and translate them.\nWhenever new english entries are added, I think the best would be to initially always add them to all the other languages even if just in english, so later it's easier for translators to just look at their corresponding language file and change the english values to their language?. @perry-mitchell Oh, my bad. I saw that the locale keys were shown when not found in the config, but did not notice that before that it will try to fall back to english.\n\nI removed now the english values from all the other files.\n\nThere are also CLI tools that help identify what items need translating\n\nWould it be even a good idea to install something like json-diff to devDependencies and add the required specific command to the Translations instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md? \n./node_modules/.../json-diff ./locales/en/base.json ./locales/my-lang/base.json\nThis would reduce the effort for those willing to help with the different languages.. Ok @perry-mitchell, after all, I can just go forward with the whole task in this PR.\nI nested the whole english config and updated all the code usages. \nIf you have any comments on the JSON structure, it would be best to make all the changes now first, and when that's ready, I'll update all the other locale files.. Ok, now everything should be finally ready!\nIn the end, I was so annoyed by copying the format from english to others, that only with 3 languages left, I wrote a small script for copying from flat to nested format. Should have done that in the very beginning, and just fully reformat manually the whole english file first of all \ud83d\ude05 . \ud83c\udf89 Thanks guys! . Would you consider at some point adding some testing utility which would allow to stub/mock modules?\nI tried to add a tiny simple test case to cover this, but the function modified is tied to electron.shell, so it's not possible without mocking it.\nIn this case the test is very dumb and maybe not a big deal, but I think being able to test some other bigger pieces of code in isolation from other modules would be useful.\nI've used module mocking functionality from Jest, which works great, but I don't have experience with other standalone modules providing this. I think for example rewire and proxyquire are popular ones.. Thanks @sallar!\n@perry-mitchell I definitely agree that \"rewiring\" the modules for tests is a bit of a dirty way of mocking things, but might be useful sometimes when it's really hard or costly to refactor bottom-up some existing code in order to pass in dependencies.\nIn another order of things, I've found myself liking a lot this one pattern, using the index.js default import functionality to hide away dependency injection.\nE.g. I mean if I would create some module foo, my folder structure would be\n/src/foo/foo.js\n/src/foo/index.js\nWhere foo.js is the real module, which accepts dependencies as arguments.\nAnd index.js is just the wiring, fetching those dependencies and passing them to the module, returning the module itself.\nThen from somewhere else I just import 'src/foo', so the whole dependency wiring is hidden.. I agree it's a lot of extra files, basically doubling in all modules with deps, if you would take that pattern as standard.\nPersonally I don't see this as a big problem - if I would have for example a folder tools/ with 5 different module files inside, there would be instead 5 module folders inside tools/, each with module-foo.js + index.js. But I don't need to think about this when using them, only when implementing. After that, they are just hidden inside the module folders. And index.js files are tiny. Then suddenly you can just easily test every single module you write.\nBut of course, this is your (both) project and it's your call. I did not intend either to suddenly set a whole bunch of different practices. Just my 50ct, maybe you could find it suitable at some point \ud83d\ude0a  \nI'll take a look into inject-loader, thanks. I understand the main difference with those rewire and others is that it's \"less tricky\"? So it just applies some extra rules at compilation time instead of some other \"dirtier\" magic to replace the modules.. I actually spent some time today with this issue.\nI noticed while in development at some point that entries were not being saved to disk after creating them and reloading (Ctrl+R) the Electron window. \nThe behaviour was so erratic that it took a while to identify a pattern, but I see this is reproduceable now in 0.25.1:\n- Create an entry with just a title\n- Lock the archive or View->Reload (here it seems it varies, I've got the issue basically always with Reloading, sometimes with Locking)\n- Unlock the archive\n- Entry is not there\n- Quit the app -> now the saving popup keeps waiting forever.\n\n. Ok, finally I got to do all the fixes.\nThe threads are getting long, so I'll compile here the remaining important changes to be checked:\n- Agreeing with this\n- Still the original encoding concerns I wrote here. Why encode/decode? Atm it's not happening.\nAnd what should be the image format here?\n- I had exactly this issue when a translation key was not found, that's why I did this - the i18next backend is not even used at the moment.\n- Agreeing about the appearance for now. I reduced the distance between icon and entry, but not sure what you meant @perry-mitchell by center the icon a bit more.\nAlso I played with having square icons, which maybe suits better many of them. Tell me which one you prefer. Atm they are circular.\nHere is the current appearance (including also your updated lock icon):\n  \n  Here with square icons:\n  \nI think that should be it... almost there! \ud83d\ude05 \n. Thanks @sallar! I now pushed the change with the square icons.\nBut I think the 2nd point I listed should still be clarified.\n Why the encode/decode in Iconographer's StorageInterface? Atm it's just not implemented in IconFileStorage. (Maybe @perry-mitchell knows more specifically the reason here)\n And what should really be the correct data URL, after getting the icon as Buffer from Iconographer? I don't really know what is the image type.\n  This was just a temporary hack:\njavascript\n   return `data:image/png;base64,${buffer.toString('base64')}`;. Noo damn. I'm so sorry @perry-mitchell @sallar I just actually broke the icons somehow in the last merging from updated master \ud83d\ude20  I will fix it and submit a new PR. Aah that's great, thanks @sallar!\nI just noticed the issue here, I was missing those semicolons from the beginning but the new styled-components version is now strict on those... it was a time bomb \ud83d\ude06 \nBtw, that means that the current Prettier version is not fixing styled-components syntax, so that should probably be updated, as the feature is available now in 1.8.0.. Neat! \ud83d\udc4d. Great, sorry if I commented on too quickly \ud83d\ude2c . Ofc. Fair enough. app-menu, archive-menu, etc. as top level items are still quite easy to find.. This is slow... but the GUI test really runs against the built app, so without running build it isn't really testing the current code (plus the 1st time it did not work until you manually run build yourself). To be updated when Iconographer PR is merged. TBD. This is something I'm not sure if you will agree with. But I found for myself having Inspect option in development as essential when tweaking the UI. Using this module was the easiest way I found of getting that menu there.\nIt adds also Cut, Copy and Paste for text, whenever it would suit and there isn't a Buttercup menu overriding it. I totally understand if you don't want to have these, please tell me what you think.. You might want to use another icon of your own as the default, maybe even a Buttercup icon?\nJust in case this would stay, it comes from http://flaticon.com, so would need to give credit on the README. Iconographer error flow maybe could be improved (we probably don't want to show Iconographer errors to the user, but it would be good to log them somewhere they can be at some point gathered). Temporary hack to be fixed. Btw, here a practical example of that index pattern we discussed.\nIf you still don't like it like this, I'm open to discuss other approaches.\nIMO it's just a great way of hiding the wirings inside a folder + testing very easily the IconFileStorage. It does not interfere, actually it is there unless your own menus overwrite it. This is due that I just added it as a base here, and whenever you would have a menu it just replaces it. If you are ok with this, good, it was just the least effort alternative.\nIf you would even like to merge it with your own menu, I could also do that, probably.. @sallar maybe you have already seen it but:\n\n. @perry-mitchell I see your point in that actually thanks to JS modules supporting default + secondary exports, it is possible to use this in different ways to define in one single JS file both the \"pure\" module (unit testable) + the instantiated one (dependent on specific config or on other modules which you would want to replace in your test).\nI guess in the end it comes to a matter of taste of how to apply the same idea. I like better somehow to separate very clearly in different files the pure module from it's specific instantiation/configuration.\nIn this case anyway, the point of this was to expose the pure non-configured IconFileStorage in one place (so in the test I pass my own specific path) and in another place provide both its real config (the Electron path) and make it a singleton.\nIt is totally about unit testing it (considering it unit even if using the filesystem).\nBecause here it is really not going to be used anywhere out of Iconographer, I could actually remove the index and do that part inside the iconographer.js itself. What about that?\nBut otherwise, an alternative for this could be what you suggest.. Pd. I actually love how in JS you have such freedom of going with so many different approaches in this aspect \ud83d\udc4d . Pd2. I love discussing these meta aspects of code... maybe you noticed \ud83d\ude00 . Well, I just went with replicating source directory structure for tests... which unfortunately leads to this.\nAlternatives to this ugliness:\n- Define a different test directory structure\n- Place tests together with code\n- Use some utility or config to allow absolute imports from root, so that this would be something like the following, no matter where you call it from:\njavascript\nimport foo from 'src/main/lib/icon/storage/IconFileStorage'\n@perry-mitchell Not sure I understand what you mean in your comment.\n. @perry-mitchell I actually did not really get the point of having Iconographer both return a Promise and emitting Events. Probably I'm missing something.\nNow I went down the rabbit hole and I still don't see it, maybe you can clarify this for me.\n\n\nSo Iconographer.processIconForURL first enqueues a task fetching the wanted icon, and when this task is completed, it enqueues another task which stores the icon data using the storage.\n\n\nI see that Channel.enqueue returns the task promise, and this Task.queuedPromise actually resolves when the task is completed.\n\n\nSo going back up the rabbit hole, the Promise returned by Iconographer.processIconForURL actually resolves when the icon has been downloaded and stored into disk.\n\n\nFrom what I understand now, the event emission would be useful if I would want to react in some universal way anytime any icon gets fetched and stored by the Iconographer. This could be defined totally separate from the specific Iconographer usage.\nBut this is not the case, as whenever I would react to the icon being stored, it would mean I want to fetch it and update a very specific entry. This means that actually this reaction is totally tied to the Iconographer usage and to the context of a specific entry.\nSo in the end, using the EventEmitter instead of Promises basically replaces this code:\njavascript \n// Creating or updating entry here\n// Dispatch already the basic create/update with the entry data\n// Then: \nlet icon = await iconographer.getIconForEntry(entry);\nif (!icon) {\n  await iconographer.processIconForEntry(entry);\n  icon = await iconographer.getIconForEntry(entry);\n}\n// Set icon to entry and dispatch entry update\nwith this code:\njavascript \n// Creating or updating entry here\niconographer.once('iconAdded', async url => {\n  if (url === entry.url) {\n    const icon = await iconographer.getIconForURL(targetURL);\n    // Set icon to entry and dispatch update\n  }\n});\niconographer.processIconForEntry(entry);\n// We can dispatch the basic create/update with the entry data here, \n// as we are not waiting for the icon update\nTo me this last one seems more complex, as this flow happens across actions/entries and buttercup/entries, so it would require somehow passing this iconAdded listener into buttercup/entries or having actions/entries know too much about the icon processing.\n...that was a long write. I hope you understand somehow my point \ud83d\ude05 . Yes yes. Missed this one. It should probably behave in the same way as the createEntry and updateEntry. First load the entry data fast without waiting for the icons, then fetch the icons for each entry (either disk or downloaded) and dispatch updates. Or, should it actually wait only for those icons which are already stored in disk, and defer only the real slow part, downloading + storing + reading from disk icons for those entries which did not have a stored icon? (This 2nd part I actually missed to implement for loadEntries)\nNot sure if there would really be a big noticeable difference for those entries with icons stored in disk (the usual case). If waiting, it would be a bit slower, but it would avoid tons of dispatch(updateEntry) for each entry in the loaded list.. Shouldn't you use rather reader.onload and reader.onerror, resolving and rejecting the Promise in each case?\nOtherwise, it would just still store some bad result in case of failure (not even sure what would be the value), and would not retry anymore - when maybe retrying later to fetch the icon correctly might work and store the correct one.\nIf it rejects, it would cause Iconographer to reject, but that would not be a problem as we catch in entries and log if necessary.. I get the point that this is not used now in Iconographer, but maybe this means that this method should not be in the interface either?. ",

Anyway I fixed already.. @sallar you can assign it to me.\nI suggest we can ignore empty custom fields and we save just dirty fields. let me know what you think about this.. @perry-mitchell I totally agree with you, but my suggest specifically is related to the custom field. Because I think its nature is optional and if user add a custom field but didn't fill it, we can just ignore it when we want submit the form. But we could have some validation rule for its value.. @perry-mitchell I did not mean we should just have a validation in submit level. I agree with you and I think we must be have validation for each field on field level when blur event.\nMy mean from ignoring custom field it was when user did not filed any of field inputs. We can just ignore that field when both of them (name and value) was empty.. So, based on my knowledge I must hit these:\n\nField level validation with good messaging (instant)\nNormalizing and validating data in submit level with good messaging\n\nAnd for implement these items I think current design is not good for and we need discuss about this.\nFor example on field validation we don't have any space between fields row and we can not show the error message under or top of them.\nAnd for custom fields if we want have field validation we need to show inputs with stack view.\ncc @sallar @perry-mitchell \n.

I've written a solution with react-intl. It's not fully complete, but it's an idea how it can be done.\nAfter I pushed my code, I've seen that an i18next branch exists \ud83e\udd26, but this small session helped me to get into the code and I discovered some tricky parts like main folder translation, system files translations in renderer folder, handling dynamic content and the need of restarting the application after changing the lang(e. g. main menu). I've added example codes for all of these.\nSource: https://github.com/ph1p/buttercup-desktop/commits/master\n- I added an i18n folder with language files in json format.\n- Every word has its own id. \n  - e. g.: components.file-manager.index.open_in_buttercup (folder.folder.file.word) this was my first idea, but I'm sure there is a better solution.\n- I also added a react-intl wrapper to file-manager.js and index.js. This wrapper is imported from an configuration file located at the i18n folder.\nHave a nice weekend!\n. Hey @sallar! Sure :) \nI was not quite sure, because of the existing branch. \nI've created a pull request. First one I've ever made on an public repo \ud83c\udf89 . This is my actual search and I added the EntryFinder class. I've only one problem. How can I find the group of an entry? I think this is important, because I can't switch folders without this feature.\n\nDon't wonder about: \n- Hidden entry sidebar\n- Search in tree view\n- entry count next to folders\n- titlebar icons\n- color (I removed the vibrancy effect to get rid of the mac os bug)\nThese things are all tests of mine and not for production use or something else.\n. I've fixed this error in my PR #400 . @sallar Thank you! I have a problem with the current version of buttercup. I can't run npm run build:renderer. This is why I updated all outdated packages (That did not help). \nWebpack freezes at 91% additional asset processing and node throws FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST. \nYour last working commit was 8732150474e9bf6be7cb78faf9bff7f17d9049e2. \nAnd the problem is babili (babel-minify). I replaced it with uglify and commented out babel-minify. Now it works, hopefully :)\n. I'm german, so I reviewed the german part by myself ^^.\nI only added spanish language, because of ticket #284. \nA girlfriend of mine speaks spanish, she will translate it.\nThese language files are only examples. I'll write a little explanation about the naming and update all of them.\n\nThank you for reviewing my code. I give my best to solve all problems.. I've updated my code and have decided to hold the naming of language ids easier. \nThe id describes or is itself the translated word written in lower kebab-case.\nI think it's better, because it's shorter and easier to use with duplicate words.\n. > @ph1p That's awesome, and we appreciate it. As a matter of habit I would personally like all translations (first time) verified by at least 1 other person - it's not a matter of trust but more of habit. I can probably have that done today anyhow \ud83d\ude0a\n\nOh and thanks again for the hard work! This was a massive task, and we're just being extra careful with it. Because of this work, other translations will be much easier \ud83c\udf89\n\nThanks again (: I totally understand that.\n\nAlso, @sallar + @ph1p - Are we able to verify what happens if a property in one language is missing? I was hoping that it might default to English, but I can't see yet from the code what the behaviour might be if a translation is not present in one locale..\n\nI'll implement a fallback solution.. > Does it fall back automatically?\nUnfortunately not :/ There is an extra prop for this called defaultMessage. I think I'm ready to push it in about an hour.\n. I've added a full translation @perry-mitchell, some bug fixes and fallback support. I can't find the word Trash (filetree). Where is it? ^^. @perry-mitchell Ah ok and take look at password generator, this must also be dynamic.. Ok guys ...  I've tried several things, but I don't know why travis and veyor failing. There're stopping at ava && npm run lint. I've tested it on my own and can't reproduce it.\n. Thanks @sallar. This was a stupid idea of mine, to push all code into the master branch \ud83e\udd17. Next time I\u2019ll create an extra feature branch and another pull request.. Ok I've one last commit with some bugfixes and translations (no dependency updates). In about 20 minutes I'll push it.. You're right it's a little bit quick an dirty. I'm already on it!\nI'm renaming this PR to \"Handling Form Validation\".. My mistake. While I was coding, I found these errors/untranslated words and fixed them immediately. Next time I'll write them down and split them into different PRs. This PR is ready so far or should I split it now and create new PRs?. Ok :). I thought about nearly the same type of naming, this is why I added -error.\nSome proposals + examples:\n- archive - open-archive-file to archive.open-file\n- entry - add-entry to entry.add\n- group - new-group to group.new\n- error - archive-not-found-error to error.archive-not-found\n- info - archive-saved-loading-info to info.archive-saved-loading\n.

Just a friendly point to ask first if it's a large change like this.\n\nThis wasn't a massive waste of work for me. I wanted to compare react-intl with 18next. It's not bad if it's rejected by you. \nAnd jep next time I'll open an issue. Sorry :/\n. I'll continue the i18next feature today early in the evening and you're right @perry-mitchell. Currently these JSONs are nearly identical. I don't like it either. I'll think about a logical structure and push all my changes later.. Hey! Spectrum is currently under heavy load :/ I'm working hard to get the i18next feature finished.\nI've written a  component and appended an i18next parser to the i18next-scanner.config.js file for it. I've done that, because we've two components  and  from react-i18next.\n\n<Trans i18nKey=\"date\" parent=\"span\">\n    Date <strong>{{date}}</strong><br /> etc.\n</Trans>\nYou can't pass the value {{date}} to it and the interpolation brackets are detected as object.\nThe i18next scanner is creating something like this:\nDate <0>{{date}}</0> etc. (jep,   was not recognized)\nI think that's very confusing.\n\n<Interpolate i18nKey=\"connect-to-wedav\" title={title}>\n    Connect to {{ title }} Server\n</Interpolate>\nYou can pass values as props, but not use them, because of the same problem with objects above.\nAdditionally you can't automatically parse for  translations.\n\n<Translate\n  html\n  i18nKey=\"i18n-key\"\n  values={{\n    name: 'Peter'\n  }}\n  defaultText={`\n    Hi {{name}}\n `}\n/>\nThis is my component. All necessary attributes can be passed as props. This component is small an uses directly all methods from i18next.\nAnd I've written it a little bit like styled-components, but this is not ready yet.\n```\nconst test = \"My text with interpolation {{name}}\";\nconst variable = \"variable\";\nconst TestComponentTwo = Translatekey-123;\nconst TestComponentTwo = Translate`\ntest-key\n\ntest without values ${test}\n`;\nconst TestComponentThree = Translate`\ntest-1234\n\ntest {{variable}}\nand multiline\n\n(variable=${variable}, anotherone=text)\n`;\nconst App = () => (\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n);\n```\nWhat do you think?\n\nCurrently the locales/ folder looks like this:\n\nlocales/\nen.json\nde.json\n...\n\nWith i18next:\n\nlocales/\nen/\ntranslation.json (namespace)\nerror.json\n\n\nde/\ntranslation.json (namespace)\n...\n\n\n\nI've removed all template.jsons. translation is the namespace. If we write i18nkey=\"error:my-error\" a new file will be created with that name and we have to add it to shared/i18n/index.js. But we can also indent the error messages and have only one file.\n\nerror:entry-not-found (namespace, nsSeparator)\nerror.entry-not-found (indent, keySeparator)\n\nShould we indent or namespace translations?\nDoes the folder structure fit like this?\n. > What do you mean by indenting?\nWe can write error:entry-empty or error.entry-empty\nFirst one will create a file called error.json:\n{\n    \"entry-empty\": \"Text\"\n}\nAnd the second one creates a file called translation.json:\n```\n{\n    \"welcome\": \"Welcome\"\n    ...\n    \"error\": {\n        \"empty-entry\": \"Text\"\n    }\n}\n```\nbase.json is a good name :)\n\n\nI think you've had some really good ideas on the  component, but I'm still not completely comfortable with how it might look.\n\nI will edit it and push it later.\n\n\nWhy not use react-i18next's  component? \n\nThis is a good question. \n```\nrender() {\n  const name = 'Peter';\n  const count = 5;\nreturn (\n    \n\n        Hello {{ name }}, you have\n        {{ count }} unread message. Go to messages.\n      \n\n  );\n};\n```\nWe have to set all variables before.\nTransforms to:\n{\n  \"userMessagesUnread\": \"Hello <1><0>{{ name }}</0></1>, you have <3>{{ count }}</3> unread message. <5>Go to messages</5>.\"\n}\nI don't know if i18next filters this in a non react context.\nSome Problems I have had:\nThis will cause in an error after auto generate translations. I think this is because of the self-closing tags.\n<Trans i18nKey=\"userMessagesUnread\" count={count}>\n  Hello <strong title={t('nameTitle')}>{{ name }}</strong>, you have<br />\n  <br />\n  {{ count }} unread message. <a href=\"/msgs\">Go to messages</a>.\n</Trans>\nreact-i18next does not detect the full translation.\n<Trans i18nKey=\"userMessagesUnread\" count={count}>\n  Hello <strong title={t('nameTitle')}>{{ name }}</strong>, you have<br />\n  <br />\n  {{ count }} unread message. <a href=\"/msgs\">Go to messages</a>.\n</Trans>\nOutput:\n<div>Hello <strong title=\"nameTitle\">Peter</strong>, you have<br> unread message. unread message. ..</div>\nTransforms to:\n```\n{\n  \"userMessagesUnread\": \"Hello <1><0>{{ name }}01, you have<3>3 <5>{{ count }}5 unread message. <7>Go to messages7.\",\n}\n```\nOr prettier adds {' '} and the translation does not fully render:\n<Trans i18nKey=\"userMessagesUnread\" count={count}>\nHello <strong title={t('nameTitle')}>{{ name }}</strong>, you have{' '}\n{{ count }} unread message. <a href=\"/msgs\">Go to messages</a>.\n</Trans>\nOutput: Nearly the same as above.\nFrequently translations\n\nI think the default text should be a child of the component\n\nYep.\n\nAdditionally I will take a look at jslingui and see how all of this stuff is done there \ud83e\udd17\n\nAs I said I'll push it later and we can review all solutions. We're not in stress, because a temporary solution is already there and these decisions are also important to other projects like react-native, core or website. But I think you both know that already (: . @sallar thanks :) I was also busy the last few days.. Ok I'll do my best. I set all missing translations as an empty string. All translators see what's missing now.\nI've added also a config file with all translations, a type array and the fallback language.. > Ah, I meant removing them entirely.\nSorry I forgot to mention, that this was an suggestion of mine ^^.  I thought this were better, because when I take a look at all translations and everything is filled out, I don't start a PR.\nAll empty translations are using the fallback language automatically.. If you add new functionality, you can run:npm run i18next-parse-lang. The scanner will find all keys and append them to the right file. All existing keys are not touched by this.\n\nBut ok I'll remove them ;). Removed them already ^^. Try it by yourself. Add a fake locale, run the command above and you'll see the result in locales. No one has to think about it. Devs add the translation methods to their features, scanner finds them and the translator fills out the empty string.\nI set this flag returnEmptyString: false in /shared/i18n/index.js to handle this behavior.. I've added a small checkbox to my preferences PR. That was the quickest solution I could find.. > @ph1p I think that checkbox can be removed... We have changed the way icons work in the latest PR #744\nAlrighty. I've sent a PR. Oh good point! I'll check it.. Ok. My first test shows that electron prevents it from getting out of bounds.\n- Connected 3 Monitors [1] [2] [3]\n- Moved Buttercup from 1 to 3 and disconnected 3.\n- Buttercup shows up on first one.\n- Connected 3 again and buttercup shows up on this one.\n. Ok you can close it :)  I'll sent a PR.. @perry-mitchell @darsain I'll do my best.. thanks @perry-mitchell :) My code uses the EntryFinder now. I've removed the groups. I've also updated the design and the window no longer jumps up and down.. And finally I've added the icons :). Now the EntryFinder searchs across all opened archives and shows the archive title in your search results.. Yeah \ud83d\udc4d  . First of all, this is only an idea and maybe the tray icon is always visible and you cannot disable it. I started this because of #444.\n\nWhat is the default behaviour?\nThe tray icon is disabled\nWhen its active\n\n\nIs the tray icon switchable?\nJep. You can use the setImage method.\n\nWhat do you mean by the following: [...]\nI'm able to see the tray icon in development mode, but when I run npm run build && npm run package:mac the app shows this and an error window shows up and closes itself immediately.\n\n. @sallar Currently I'm working on a good user experience and test out various things. \nThis is how it looks like on mac and windows\n\n\n\n\n. @sallar I've added an .ico file for windows and on mac two files, one 16x16 and 32x32. I've tried different sizes and its always a little bit blurry. It would be nice, if you can try it by yourself or provide some icons.\n.ico windows\n\n. @sallar @perry-mitchell you're right ^^ looks a little bit out of place. I'll change it and improve the context menu behavior.\nI'll try this: \n\n\n\n. @sallar no problem :)\n@perry-mitchell this is correct (after commit: 4bbfbc5)! I've tested it only on mac and windows. (installing debian \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb)\n[update]\nEverything looks good with debian. I would like to test some other linux distributions before you go to merge my changes.. @perry-mitchell I think the additional menu item to open buttercup is a good idea.\nMaybe we should add the menu on both clicks.\nThis is an example how others apps handle these clicks. All of them are very different, but most of them open the menu on left click. I thought, it would be nice to open buttercup as fast as possible, but maybe it confuses some people.\n\ngreen = right click. I noticed this too. With appIcon.setContextMenu(contextMenu); electron handles the context menu automatically. Maybe we can use this method.\nThe .ico files are corrupt.\n\n\n. @alper I'm currently working on a PR https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/pull/699 ... I hope I finish it this week.. @sallar I don't know why this build fails. I did all the testing on site and everything went well. Do you know this error?

I've unfortunately had a lot of other things to do lately :/ Maybe I'll cut out some features and add them later (:. I'm so glad to hear that :) Thank you!

I feel a little bad that it took so long \u263a\ufe0f. Hi! I'm currently working on a preferences window https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/pull/699 and added the max and minimizing feature you've mentioned. Feel free to pull and test it :) The shortcut is: CommandOrControl+Shift+X. Definitely! I'll create a solution inside the preferences window later. Currently it's hard coded.\nMaybe a restart of buttercup is required, we will see (:. @mokhosh I have pushed a solution to my branch. Please take a look at it.  (:\nOkay. I have added all the shortcuts I could find ^^\n\n. Jep. Just clone it, run npm i and npm start or build. . Thank you for your feedback! \ud83d\udc4d I'm developing this feature on Mac. I will test everything under windows again. The design is only functional.  I will redesign it and test it again everywhere.\n\nI don't think the minimize/maximize shortcut is global. It does minimize the window when it's focused but doesn't bring it back when it's not.\n\nOkay. Good to know! Maybe that's a problem with Windows. \nI take a look at it.\n\nAnd I think preferences usually belongs in Edit menu, doesn't it?\n\nI think on windows, this makes sense. \nThe preferences window on mac is always included in the first tab.\n\n\n. @mokhosh Fixed global hotkey and disable the menubar in preferences window. Fixed it (: The setting of the tray icon is now taken into account. The redux-subscriber package is now added to the package-lock.json.. Good to hear! (: I've already created an issue. https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/issues/740 But yeah, this shouldn't be a problem at the end. \nNext steps for me: Testing if all settings work correctly, writing tests and creating a final design.. @sallar @wolffles Doesn't work for me :/\nAnd in src/shared/actions/entries.js - line 112 the isSavingNewEntry variable is used.\n\n. I pulled it again and it works ... strange \ud83d\ude44 Maybe it was really a cache problem.\n\nWith regards to that error, yes, we can remove that line now that we're using axios.\n\nOk cool (:. Hey! (: I think there is still an mistake and it was there already before your change ... I've found this bug by clicking around while editing or creating an entry. \nI think it's not your fault and I've created this tiny bug a while ago.. Hi! I have also created an issue https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/issues/740\nSimple solution. Remove this Line: https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/blob/master/src/renderer/index.js#L37 . @jearton Feel free to create a PR. All translations were done voluntarily.\nSteps:\n- Fork this Repo (upper right corner)\n- Clone it git clone git@github.com:jearton/buttercup-desktop.git\n- Create a new branch git checkout -b chinese or git branch chinese && git checkout chinese\n- Add ./locales/cn/base.json to locales\n- Update ./locales/config.json\n- Commit and push it to your repository git add --all && git commit -m \"Add chinese translation\" && git push\n- Create a PR (https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/compare). Jep. Documentation says, that i can use the ecma option (https://github.com/webpack-contrib/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin#uglifyoptions). Sure. Jep. Yes, because I need the store variable for all menu points.. Jep. Because I can't find a solution to update the whole electron menu.. Ok cool. I'll try it :). It will compile. I've made the forEach, because if you dynamically require content, webpack typically ignores it. With this little trick I require all translations and load them into the object. So when I add a language to the config object, the translations are automatically added.\nAnyways, I have updated my code and decided to import the languages by hand.. Yeah, it works!. Oh cool, didn't know that :). I'll change it ;) Don't know if it's better to write propTypes in- or outside class. What do you prefer?. I will delete it, because it's not in use.. This was only a spelling mistake. I added this new translation to en and de. . translation.json will be used in the app.\ni18n-scanner extracts keys from i18n.t(), t(),  and  -> i18n-scanner searches in template.json for existing keys and translations -> translation.json is generated based on template.json and found keys will be appended. Non existing keys are automatically set to english translation. I can remove this or integrate it in a seperate folder.. AppVeyor build failed. I'll check the performance.. Ok I'll replace them with the scanner separators.. Even better solution (: thanks. Jep. I'll try my best.. done. Sorry about the second PR. Do not know if you can delete my last pull request. I've committed sensitive data \ud83d\ude30. I'll try to add the EntryFinder ;). @perry-mitchell I asked a colleague of mine for his opinion on this PR. He said it would be nice to see folders. So I added them. For me only entries are important.. Thanks! . Ok I've pushed my update :) Now you can control the result with arrow up/down and enter key.. app.dock.show() is asynchronous. When I disable the tray icon and enable the dock icon at the same time, the app crashes.. Sure :). k. k. I haven't used them, because I've read about performance issues. I will change it ;). Ok (:.

    "ideologysec": "Are there any plans to support something like YubiKey/general FIDO U2F devices? It's pretty nonstandard and 1Password provides some pretty good reasons why it's not necessary, but it would be nifty to have support (since I carry a YubiKey anyway). Multiple keys would be great (in case one was lost. TOTP is probably infeasible (and a bad idea). Please note I'm not talking about Dropbox etc login support, but rather archive decryption support.\nFrom a core/crypto perspective, perhaps MasterPW+YubiKey response could be pass+salt for the PBKDF2 seed? Multiple keys could work similarly, but then you'd have essentially x passphrases that could unlock an archive (where X is the number of YubiKeys configured to unlock the archive: MasterPW+Key1, MasterPW+Key2, etc). Unsure if this is a good idea in practice, but I'd love to explore more/chat about possibilities.. #233 is what I was stating I was explcitly not referring to - rather than U2F support for logging into a syncing service, I was speaking about using a U2F device as a sort of physical key file along wih a password to decrypt an actual buttercup archive. (unless I'm misunderstanding how Buttercup uses Dropbox, which is simply as a cloud-synced folder storage of an encrypted archive file, not as a complete login solution for Buttercup)\nDashlane has some info HERE.. LastPass supports U2F as well. Importantly, though, is that those are essentially logins to a service, not for decrypting a file. Hence my suggestion above - though I'm open to doing some more digging. \nU2F as a standard is being subsumed by the Web Authentication standard, which all major browsers will apparently support, but that's a little ways off - see eg THIS for Chrome and THIS for Safari and general context.\nMore information on U2F in general HERE, code for an iOS app to pretend to be a U2F device HERE, and a great write up (yes by Yubico) of how to use a YubiKey as an OTP device HERE - please note that this is not a U2F solution, but still something that would be pretty cool.\nAll of that ->^ aside, I imagine this is pretty low on the priority list - there's definitely lots of UI work I would thrill to see completed first (though I'm much more of a C/C++ person; this React/web stuff is pretty new to me).. Speaking as someone who uses their computer and phone in areas with little or no service on a regular enough basis that this would be critical, I agree.

    "darsain": "Since we can reorder databases, wouldn't it be better to auto display the unlocking screen for the first database on the list? This gives users the ability to select their primary database.\nI know I would definitely prefer it that way. Reasoning:\n90+% of the time opening buttercup I want my main database. Sometimes I might select some other less used database. That however does not mean that next time I'll need this less used database again. On the contrary, there is 90+% chance I'll need my most used database, hence why it is most used. Auto unlocking the 1st database in the list allows me to configure this preference.. Having to click some \"All Items\" folder before I can search globally would be very annoying. Not to mention it would clutter my directories with another directory I didn't create and can't get rid of. This can easily be solved with UX.\n\nCtrl+F (optional, or just \u2193)\nstart typing\nbuttercupt displays found items as it does now, but searched globally\nnavigating with up/down arrows (or clicking) selects & activates the item in the list\npressing escape clears the searchbox and displays the directory of the currently active item\n\nRegarding active directory confusion while searching, just create a simple rule: always activate/select a directory of currently active item. For once it makes sense, and also when I'm navigating through search results, I can see which folder the items is in, because it lights up. And when I press escape, I'm in this folder.\nThis UX requires the least amount of steps and time to search and navigate results.. Please no. Don't enforce how you think people should use something. Trying to prevent dumb people from shooting themselves in the foot always leads to annoying limitations for everyone else.\nFor example, what if someone wants to test something and create one or many databases with single letter master password so it's easy to enter 50 times in 10 minutes (like I needed here).\nIf someone knows what they are doing and they want a weak password, let them. Otherwise it's like banning forks because someone might stab themselves with them.. The best warning would be to give people an estimated time it'd take the current fastest supercomputer to bruteforce the password. And a 2nd estimate of when it'll be practically bruteforceable (like below a year of computing time) if the current Moore's law trend continues.\nThat'll make people use strong passwords when they truly need them.. Yeah. With this kind of warning you've basically gamified making strong passwords, and everyone will be compelled to get the best score. I know I'd definitely make an effort to get at least the age of the universe :). Any ETA on when this might ship? The app is pretty much unusable for me atm. Instantly freezes when I click on an item. Not the best first impression :). OS: Windows 10\nVersion: 1.1.0\nI've imported a database form KeePass' .kdbx file. Buttercup loaded icons for each item, but some of them I assume failed to resolve and defaulted to this:\n\nWhen I click on an item with this kind of icon, the whole app starts consuming one whole CPU core, freezes, and I have to kill it. Clicking on items with loaded icons doesn't do that.\nAn example of an item that failed to resolve an icon would be a basic username+password login with URL: https://app.net, which is a website that shut down so I guess it doesn't have favicons available anymore.. Actually I've just tried clicking on various items and it freezes even on the ones with icons. I'll make a new issue.. #520. Related issue: Oening an archive that is already in the list by double-clicking on the .bcup file adds it to the list again, creating a duplicate.\nAlso, buttercup doesn't seem to have a single instance mode enabled. This allows multiple buttercup instances to run, possibly fighting over database access.\nPractical case when this might happen: you have buttercup open, and you want to add another .bcup database. You double click on it and instead of it being added to the current instance (or activated when it's already in the list) you get a new buttercup window. And since both instances share the same session settings storage, there will definitely be conflicts and confusion.\nOS: Windows 10. @sallar #543, #544. @perry-mitchell dunno what you mean by currently, but 1.2.2 on win 10 definitely doesn't remember window size.\nAnd the linked PR handles only position, so I guess size is still going to be an issue. Reopen maybe? :). @sallar I've been playing with it, looked at the code, and the issue is that the resize event is debounced to a whooping 2 seconds :) Turn it down to at least 500 like the other move event is.. You can still select text no problem. Fields get copied on click. mousedown->drag-to-select->mouseup is not a click, or shouldn't be. So it's all an implementation detail. And I absolutely agree, going the Google Chrome route where you can't select text inside any anchor link is very bad.\nAlso, I thought click or double-click to copy is pretty much standard in password managers, no? It's also obvious by cursor changing to hand if you hover the field. It says there is an action upon clicking, and copy is the only action that makes sense in this context. At worst, you can add a little helpful hint in the bottom right corner that says \"click values to copy them\". I find the current situation of having to copy fields by clicking on that tiny and hidden icon very frustrating to be honest. \nAnd icons: when you have many, make a hamburger. If you have a few, display inline. Hiding just makes it worse to use, since it's harder to aim for it. And I personally dislike UI elements popping into existence as I move the cursor, but that might just be my personal grudge.. Don't forget for password entry type. I'd use it for PINs, CVC, and such.\nAlso, I assume note field type will support properly entering and displaying new line characters. Well I'd also love an alternative code field, which would work the same as note, but entering and displaying in monospaced font.\nUse case: PGP keys, license keys such as for Sublime text, etc... example:\n----- BEGIN LICENSE -----\nUsername\nSingle User License\nEA0E-000000\n00F0000D CF000D00 0000CEDC F0C00DD0\n000D00EF 00FE00B0 00CCFCA0 00FBD0F0\n00AAEB0B 000B00AD 0BAC0B00 00000DD0\n00A00000 0000E0C0 00F0E0BB BE00C0E0\nC00C000E C0AC0000 0F0C00C0 0000CA0F\nA00DE00F 000BB0E0 0D00000E 0000000F\nEDF0D0A0 0A00DCCB 00000CB0 00ABEC00\n00E0F0A0 FB00CC00 D0E000C0 C00A0AE0\n------ END LICENSE ------. @sallar Yes, there is no 2nd window being launched, instead the 1st one gets focused, which is correct, but ... nothing happens. If I double-click a .bcup file to open it, something should happen. When nothing does it feels like a bug.\nThe database should get added to the list, and when it already is in the list it should just get activated.. Yeah it opens the file now.. I'd also like to note that the time it takes to focus the first instance since the double-click on the file is quite long (a few seconds). Would it be possible to do this check and quit before any unnecessary initialization happens?. If it'll eventually be able to search among all open databases, make it configurable please. Searching all of them would mean unwanted noise and inconsistency in search results for me.\nDon't make the search box jump up and down trying to center it vertically as the results are being populated. It's chaotic. Position it statically towards the top and expand results below.\nAnd I definitely prefer the original search box:\n\nOver the current hint like design:\n\nThe search results really don't seem like hints, so why put them in a hint box? :)\n. Just tested this out on Win 10:\n\n\nClicking on the icon doesn't open the app, but shows the context menu, the same thing that happens upon right-click. This is pretty useless and non-standard.\nI see that this is actually argued for above? Why? :( I'd never want both buttons to do the same thing. Left click is the easiest shortcut to the most used and intuitive action on that menu - opening the app. I can't image better UX here. I confess I've never used mac as a primary OS before but it baffles my mind if this is standard there. If the app has GUI, I always expect clicking on its tray icon to show the GUI.\n\n\nHad to look for the toggle a bit, since none calls the tray \"menubar\".\n. Windows 10, tested these apps I'm already running:\n\n\nTelegram\n\nKeePass (Buttecup is still missing some for me blocking features so this is still my primary password vault, sorry guys \ud83d\ude0c)\nResilio Sync\nBattle.net\nSteam\n\nAll have the exact same behavior:\n| Trigger           | Action                 |\n|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Single left-click | nothing                |\n| Double left-click | show app/gui           |\n| Right-click       | tray icon context menu |. Just show everything below each other. These separators have no semantic value to the user, only to developers. I don't need to know how these fields are implemented under the hood. I just want to see the fields for my item, which are all important, so any separator would be arbitrary and make no sense :). @perry-mitchell that sound horrible. What you've just described is so inflexible it'll make me probably stay with my current password manager.\nHere is where I'm coming from:\nI want to use buttercup to also store license keys, GPG keys, and similar stuff. For this I need only title, maybe username, and license/key field (that supports new-line characters, lack of which is why I'm currently still not using buttercup). It's already bad that I can't remove name & password fields which will be useless and irrelevant with this kind of item, but if you'll make even more fields mandatory, well that's just polluting the UI and nobody's OCD would like that.\nHow about a compromise: you display all your built in property fields when editing, but hide all empty fields when just viewing the item?\nAnd regarding the dividers again, lets take a license key for Sublime Text as an example. It needs title, username, and key fields. If I understand the proposed architecture correctly, the key field would be custom, so there would be a divider between username and key, which makes no sense to me :( In other words, dividers impose arbitrary semantic divisions that won't fit all types of items people might want to enter into their vault.\nAnd if you won't allow removing, or alternatively won't hide empty/unused stuff, there would also be tons of empty fields between the username and key, which is completely pointless..

This open now for 4 months, any outlook when there might be time? \nThe other statement about experience is quite frank but honest at least but a bit shocking all the same, for a password handling app not implementing Address Space Layout Randomization.\nBC is the sole app that has this issue. Anyway, perhaps time to move on then as opposed to be moaning.\nCoding is not wihtin my portfolio and thus not able to lend a hand, I am afraid.. @perry-mitchell \nnot sure how you conclude me straying from the subject or not being helpful.\nWhat is not helpful is that this not getting fixed for months and then the priority being lowered even.\nNext thing you know there is the curious Reddit post as opposed of getting in touch with the Electron devel instead, considering it being the supposed root cause in your reckoning.\nHow does that make sense?\nASLR is a commonly denominated security feature for all major OS and nothing particular to WIN. So much could have been learned from a bit of reasearch. And BC being a password handling (java script) app a user of BC could expect that its devel are indeed familiar with such.\nThat BC and just few other apps facing this issue is no indication at all that Electron is the root cause but rather the contrary - being a matter of implementation, e.g. apparently WhatsApp Desktop does not exhibit such issue and has likely a larger user base than BC.\nIf you look at https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/electron.gyp there is something mentioned of ASLR.\nYou keep on citing being short on resources, which I am not missing, to handle the project. That rather raises more questions than it answers. I do not think it helps the cause of the project/app if it cannot properly maintained as that is not about faancy feature but a security basic.\nSure, that would not raise an eyebrow if it were for some app not involving any security aspects at all but for a password handling app it is rather dubious argument (being short on resources).\nUnder the circumstance I do cocur with your point of view that any further discussion on the subject is rather futile.. Well, isn't it the ol' unfixed https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/issues/502 ?. it is for the developer to decide when/which issues are duplicate and reference/merge/close such accordingly. \nif the new version is meant to be version 1.9 than the issue is persistent and the developer would know this from testing and not musing here whether it been fixed.\nit is not good that the developer appears a bit ignorant about the (security) capabilities of Electron and potential implications of the app.\nif you went over to https://github.com/electron/electron you would be wondering why there is no ALSR ticket considering the long list of other desktop apps (whith likely broader spread than BC)  or \n\nGoogling results in very little on the matter\n\nand thus I would surprise me if it is a matter of Electron rather than implementation. \nApprently though BC is not is not the only app suffering this https://github.com/Automattic/wp-desktop/issues/436\nWhy not open a ticket on Electron and get in touch with the Electron devel?\nThe way this is being handled, notwithstanding being present in the first place, does not inspire trust in BC - the app supposedly handling passwords.. Same happened on my W10 node and had to download/run the installer manually. This might be a W10 security measure. Defender did not recognise the manually downloaded installer and produced a warning which is different from user right elevation.. Just for completeness the Defender SmartScreen warning\n\n. Since the code now being signed with v1.14.0 I guess will have to wait until the next update rolls out and see whether it sorts this issue.\nDefender's SmartScreen seems not impressed though. Maybe the certificate needs to get propagated into the MS database. \n\n. > Tried to update to 1.14.0 and the error still occurred\nThis is expected since 1.13.0 is not code signed.\n\nI can try updating manually this time and then hopefully future updates will work?\n\n->\n\nwill have to wait until the next update rolls out and see whether it sorts this issue.\n. confirmed\n\n\n. > Error: EPERM: operation not permitted\nseems related to user rights for package installation, also indicated by *.msi, and thus I am doubtful of bearing a correlation to the actual browser error (security violation)\n\nSecurity Error: Content at moz-nullprincipal:{3a77d067-5df3-41c8-8f4c-6f5eb8fff965} may not load data from moz-extension://fd885cb3-eecb-4a79-a774-f9dcbec1e680/setup-index.js.\nNS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI: Component returned failure code: 0x805303f4 [nsIWebNavigation.loadURI] viewSource-content.js:284\nSecurityError: The operation is insecure. instrument.js:35\n\nMaybe you could check the console output in Chrome and see whether it is something similar.\n. > Quite bad documentation\nSuppose you had a look at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIProtocolHandler#Constants ?\nALLOWS_PROXY ALLOWS_PROXY_HTTP URI_IS_LOCAL_FILE URI_INHERITS_SECURITY_CONTEXT\n. @perry-mitchell \nI just tested with maiden profiles and no other WX installed, each on FF 63.0.3 and FF Nightly, and both producing the same issue.\nI would not imagine this being an issue with any OS settings considering the error reported in the log, this one now from 63.0.3\n\n[error] Failed fetching localfile contents of '/': Failed reading remote file: / setup-index.js:69:6821\nSecurity Error: Content at moz-nullprincipal:{f2771ac4-9652-4a2b-9999-aabdaa61d1c8} may not load data from moz-extension://a4954087-9f0a-49dd-bbd6-97cf847b785e/setup-index.js.\nNS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI: Component returned failure code: 0x805303f4 [nsIWebNavigation.loadURI] viewSource-content.js:284 \n\nview-source:chrome://global/content/viewSource-content.js\nwebNav.loadURI(URL, loadFlags, null, null, null);\n.

The files seem to be in sync and the server file is updated when I save... but there was a .DAV folder on the server which had an older \"bcup\" file in it -  I have deleted the folder now and until now (5 restarts) I've had no old data in the Buttercup app ... fingers crossed :)\nI hope it doesn't come back again .... . hm, nope, now it happened again, and there is no new \".DAV\" folder on the webdav server ... and the .bcup file on the server has the timestamp from my last save yesterday, so everything seems to be ok file-wise... any other idea? :(. Just to add, it's not really that the archive is an old version from day X, if I've added new entries e.g., they are still available and up-to-date ... it's just that (sometimes) already deleted entries, folders or custom values keep coming back like zombies :P . Hm, until now everything looks good if I copy the file locally... so it seems to be a problem with the WebDAV communication - but I couldn't find any similar problems with WebDAV or any advice on the net how to configure a WebDAV server to handle problems like this. Do you have any suggestion what I could try on the server to get rid of this? I am running Apache/2.2.22 (Ubuntu) with WebDav module. My Buttercup client is running on a Macbook.\nAnything I could try to debug the Buttercup WebDAV / archive usage? I also have my own Buttercup build, so I could add some debug code and build me a new debug version :). Unsurprisingly, same on Windows .... so it really seems to be an issue with Buttercup and WebDAV - any idea? Do you know if anybody is using WebDAV with buttercup successfully? Thanks :). Ha, I've just tried the new 0.12 version with the direct Cloud integration and opened the WebDAV file directly - now the zombies are gone, after I have deleted them once! :) So it looks like it was only a problem with accessing the file via Windows Explorer or MAC Finder.. Oh no, I've just tried one more time today and guess what ... the zombies are back :( All the changes I've made yesterday are there, so the archive itself is \"up-to-date\", but there are entries and folders in the trash and also long deleted custom fields in some entries. E.g. the \"TestToDelete\" folder was deleted and removed from trash at least one week ago :P And the trash was empty yesterday evening...\n\nHow can this be possible at all? Magic? :)\n. What I did now is:\n rename the archive file on the server\n removed the Port 80 vhost entry and only left the 443 entry active for the webdav subdomain\n installed ntp to sync the server time with a ntp server\n unmounted the webdav directory in Finder\nUntil now, it is working .... ;) If the zombies come back, I am out of ideas though ... and may switch to Owncloud :). Nice \ud83d\udc4d  I've updated and I'll let you know if I can see the zombies again :). Just verified that on another WIN machine, seems to be a general WIN problem with opening WebDAV archives..

For instance, I frequently copy only a portion of the field value. Having an auto-copy feature would hinder that and be less obvious from a UX perspective.\n\nI agree, however an enhancement would be the ability to select/copy without having to enter the edit entry state - currently if I try to select (i.e. drag) it moves the whole window:\n\n\nI'm also not completely convinced that hiding the buttons is so bad in terms of UX. It hides clutter (which is bad UX) and you instantly learn about them when you hover one field. If they were all visible the interface would look horrible as well, imho.\n\nI agree too, although I understand @darsain's concern with targeting buttons - perhaps keyboard navigation could be both a solution here and an overall enhancement\n@darsain FYI https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_disclosure\nIf you have any issues (e.g. questions/queries) happy to help\nHope this helps!\nKeep up great work!\nRegards.

Make sure you add it to the git when pushing to the AUR, as that's where it'll attempt to pull from.. @perry-mitchell Nothing needs to be changed in the repo for it to be better, at least nothing I can think of. \nI just changed it from a binary to source as the AUR packaging standards dictate you build from source whenever possible, and if using a binary then you are supposed to add -bin to the name of your pkgbuild. -git is only for when you build from commits or git repos that otherwise don't have tagged releases.. I've adopted buttercup on the AUR, and will continue maintaining/improving it.. @perry-mitchell For Arch-Linux, there are two ways to build from the AUR. Either the user directly does something like wget https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/plain/PKGBUILD?h=buttercup -O PKGBUILD to pull the raw file, then runs makepkg -si PKGBUILD, or they use an AUR helper (this is the more popular way), which automates the process.\nI think @Defman21 is correct in that all you really need to do is link to it. I don't think you'd need to write a step-by-step for people to use it, the Arch wiki already covers that pretty well.. @perry-mitchell heh, I can remove the 32-bit stuff from the AUR if you want. @sallar What do you mean unavailable? I just had to remake the repo since there's no way to do namechanges on AUR (I did submit a merge, but those need review from TU's).. @sallar Well the previous buttercup AUR pkgbuild pulls everything from buttercup github, and while I can change the actual links to make it continue working, from what I've read the way I went about this is the correct way to do it (aka make new repo, and submit a merge request), because I can't change the actual package name.\nBut anyways, the AUR works almost exactly the same as the official Arch-linux repo's (meaning package manger-esque functionality), but it's \"unofficial\" in that literally anyone can upload pkgbuild's. People normally use things called AUR helpers to install from the AUR, although you can manually wget and makepkg yourself..  Seems the merge went through, which means the old buttercup PKGBUILD got deleted, and comments/votes got put into the new one.\n. > For the sake of consistency, pkgname should match the name of the source tarball of the software: for instance, if the software is in foobar-2.5.tar.gz, use pkgname=foobar.\nI simply went by the AUR rules, as stated in the Arch wiki, under PKGNAME... Sorry, not really sure I get what the issue is. It's pretty normal to name the AUR pkg after the repo name.. Feel free to upload whatever you want if you disagree, but I see no reason to have the AUR pkg named buttercup if the repo is buttercup-desktop. It will still appear when people search for buttercup, so finding it is a non-issue.. Sure, I can remove the check() from the PKGBUILD. It's purely optional, and I was only doing it for completeness.\nEDIT: Done in 0.25.2-2. @sallar Unless the fixed master is tagged, I can only either revert to 0.25.1, or build from the commit that increments to 0.25.2. Unsure of which you'd want, but I think tags are the better option, no?. Can probably close this since I removed the check() from the PKGBUILD, so it shouldn't create these anymore. @mannp . I maintain the AUR for Arch users, and I'd recommend using that.\nEDIT: Actually, I'm seeing the same issue.. If you look in the package-lock.json there's no 7zip-bin-linux, only 7zip-bin and 7zip-bin-mac, so that might be the issue.\nAlso, why is the package.json version still on 0.25.1 when 0.25.2 is tagged?. The only fix would be to go back to v0.25.1, as I believe that wasn't broken. v0.25.2 doesn't have a fix yet. I'll change the PKGBUILD to 0.25.1 for now, give me a minute to do it. @mannp . Hm, trying to build 0.25.1 failed with the same issue. It seems I'd have to go back to 0.25.0 as that actually has 7zip-bin-linux in the package-lock.json. https://github.com/buttercup/buttercup-desktop/commit/61933599f8e1e2307bb351193b9cb2021f6f01ba#diff-32607347f8126e6534ebc7ebaec4853dL19 removes 7zip-bin-linux. @sallar . @mannp @ziltoidtheomiscient The AUR pkgbuild should work now. I put out a (lazy) patch to temporarily fix this.. @sallar I don't know the correct way to fix it (I don't really deal with npm much), so I just shoehorned in the dependency into package.json here https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/fix_arch.patch?h=buttercup-desktop \nI guess you could just use the patch if you wanted, or do it a different (more correct?) way, up to you.. The patch I was using isn't needed to build on v.0.26.0, so I guess something fixed the issue..

This could be a one-way push where the user can declare which device (desktop, laptop, phone) holds the 'master record', and would push the updated archive to the other devices. Or, if we want to get fancy, have a true sync between the devices so that updates from the desktop/mobile apps are merged and shared. Probably best to tackle as a multi-phase approach, with 1-way push first and then syncing. \nThe roadmap mentions a self-hosted server version of the MyButtercup app/platform, and that could potentially utilize a lot of this functionality in how it could update a user's multiple devices. Personally, I'd prefer the ability to have this sharing type of convenience without relying on pushing/storing on someone else's machine/server, as well as seamless and automatic/single-click as possible...but that may just be the paranoia and forgetfulness poking out \ud83d\ude06 \nKeep up the amazing work gents!. @perry-mitchell Thanks for quick and detailed response! My thoughts about the 'trusted devices' and utilizing the QR code for initial auth, was to share the archive files between my phone and laptop directly when on the same network, so that each device would have an updated copy to be able to use offline. \nI had assumed the 'Cloud Sources' archive connections required a network connection to the cloud source each time a user opened the app in order to use it (similar to storing on a NAS), and if I didn't have an internet connection on my device, the app wouldn't be able to access the archive.\nIt looks like my assumption about that may be wrong, and the app downloads and stores the archive when possible for offline use? \nI need to spend more time with buttercup to be more familiar, so I do apologize if these long-winded comments were naive :/ With that, I'm fine wrapping up this thought-thread here, and we can revisit at a later time if need be. \nFor the B2B outlook, I think that would be a great goal to chase! Especially if it were to have similar functionality to Vault by Hashicorp, where businesses could programmatically create/retrieve/expire different auth credentials for people/systems/processes. Very excited to see where this project is headed. \nI suppose it's about time for me to learn React so that I can contribute (if only BC had started with Angular, I could jump right in \ud83d\ude04 ) .

So I just deleted the extra archives from the app, and it seems it is not causing any issue, certainly it is just a small bug, but I'm looking into it for those users who have a lot of archives, will be time consuming to reorganize their archives, still, it works great.\nAlso, does Buttercup comes with some kind of log so I can check it out and get more feedback for you guys?\nThanks. Hi,\nNo problem about that, I just downgraded to version 1.8.0 and it is working fine now, attached you can see how the data was changed.\nWrong Fields Order\n\n\nCorrect Fields Order\n\nI wish the log could have some error entry so you can see for yourself, but unfortunately there is none when upgrading to 1.9.0 \ud83d\ude1e.\nThanks.

Because even if the master password is weak or get's compromised, and attacker would still need to steel your physical one time token generator (whichever it is). And this makes the attack vector way weaker.. You are right @perry-mitchell most of 2FA require server and account. But think it this way, authentication might be by validating at least one of the following 3:\n\nSomething that you know\nSomething that you have\nSomething that you are\n\nSo without going crazy, but just a bit creative, apart from knowing your password, you can have to scan a specific QR code -for instance- that only you'd have. This is still 2FA, without one time token for sure, but always stronger than just something that you know.\nThe most common problem I see across different password managers is just lack of creativity, really. =)\nBut that's just my personal opinion, really.\nNOTE 1: I've just playing around with couple of Yubi keys, and it turns out that the code they generate has 2 pieces => KEY_ID + ONE_TIME_TOKEN. The KEY_ID is unique to every key and is stored on the key itself. While the ONE_TIME_TOKEN is generated by the remote server on real time. So as a matter of fact, you could even do 2FA for local vaults using Yubi keys. No doubts it wouldn't be as strong as the one having a ONE_TIME_TOKEN but I still think it would be a great idea in order to strengthen the authentication flow. Any thoughts @perry-mitchell ?\nNOTE 2: Being that said, if you check yubico's website https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-individuals/password-managers/ they actually enumerate a list of password managers that offers 2FA with their keys. Among which you may find passpack and keypass which are both PC based and use yubico's API to authenticate 2FA. Obviously that wouldn't work offline but still is a good option without you needing to provide a server based auth.. @darsain that's a good point, and here comes the classic chicken and an egg situation between security and functionality, which is easy to solve really. In stead of enforcing you can:\n\nAdd a warning message with a password strength meter, to let them know how strong is the password they are choosing, but without forcing them to do anything.\nAdd the 2FA option for people who has bad memory for strong passwords but still want to enhance their security level.\n\nI think we are missing the point if we enforce people, because if done right, you just offer better options and drive them through in case they want to follow you. And for those who don't want to follow your suggestions, just let them know that it's at their own risk. \nIf you don't give options, then you are loosing the opportunity of offering a better solution, thus loosing valuable customer base. But again, that's only my opinion.. @darsain that's actually a brilliant idea. I've seen it here couple of days back http://random-ize.com/how-long-to-hack-pass/  UI isn't great, but that's the concept. right?. my bad bad I didn't check if that was the case before posting. sorry about that!\nI'm glad you're working on it, please keep me in the loop if you need a hand testing it @sallar Thx!. my bad bad I didn't check if that was the case before posting. sorry about that!.

This makes promotion and discovery a key part of your release strategy, with users able to self-serve install your application rather than hunt it down on an obscure github releases page. We've seen a significant up-tick in users for applications which are promoted through GNOME software. \nAnother significant advantage over the legacy packging formats is you having direct control over updates. You can deliver daily builds to adventurous users and stable builds to more conservative users via channels in the store. \nSnaps automatically update, so once you push an update to the store, you can be confident users will get updated promptly, reducing the long tail of versions you get support requests for. We also provide deep analytics of the application user base so you can see what releases users are on, geography etc. \nYou only need make one snap package, we deal with ensuring it works on multiple distributions. When new Linux distributions are supported, you don't need to do anything for your application to work there. \nI'm happy to answer any further questions you may have.. @perry-mitchell do you have a defined set of tests you'd like performed?

Let me know if you've any additional concerns. @sallar I've fixed the button count. \nI'm unsure why the appveyor CI is still failing while the travis CI passes. I think this could be an issue with using arbitrary wait times between function calls in the test specifications. Would you mind sharing your thoughts?\nThanks!. @sallar Yes, this button is clickable. The issue resolved in fix #730 was due to the fact that the event listener was on the magic icon SVG element rather than the GeneratorToggle styled div resulting in only the actual icon being clickable. I believe that using a button is advantageous because it's consistent with the rest of the app and more precise than making the entire div clickable.\ngif: https://gyazo.com/49bfeff6f73aba274d6e1037980c4801.

I am experiencing the same issue and have some more info. \nI think the issue occurs when Buttercup is initially started by the browser extension and then opened in Windows. \nAfter opening a couple of instances via the browser or Windows I have a lot of instances of Buttercup. Even after closing all windows the processes stay active. At the moment I have 7 processes of Buttercup without a opened window. There is however only one system-tray icon.\nI have not looked into the internals of Buttercup, but I suspect there is a http listener started multiple times. This causes to have the port used multiple times by Buttercup.. ",

    "RyanDelGizzi": "Also failing on windows.  Instead of hanging, after 10 seconds or so the following error appears, and the app crashes.\nUnhandled Error\nError: spawn C:/Users/RYAN~1.DEL/AppData/Local/Temp/up-BelOIh/buttercup-desktop-setup-1.15.0.exe EACCES. Error persists when upgrading from 1.12 to 1.15.  Let me know if you would like to test earlier versions.\n\n. ",
    "jqhercules": "Your guys created a fantastic app  love it!\nI'm also experiencing the exact same issue.  It happened right after upgrading currently on v1.15.0\n. I installed the extension after clicking \"unlock vault\" new tab appeared with the following \nUnlock archives\n(Nothing shows in the box)\n2019-03-13\nBugfix:\n(#244) \nGoogle Drive fetching fails on large directories \nI have never used gDrive to store anything suggested to the link. I removed the archive  as suggested but forgot to locate where its stored on my mac to restore it, so its all gone. You can close this thread. . ",
    "Bangio19": "I forgot to close this topic but I actually managed to get to the archive. \nYou shoud check if your archive is stored locally on your desktop or on the cloud, in your dropbox or in another app compatible with Buttercup. \nI hadn't any of those so I downloaded the chrome extension and then I could have access. I don't really know how that worked but there you go. I hope it helped you.\nCheers. ",
    "brunolorentin-booxmedia": "ficier --> typo. forgot to translate this one? :D. I don't know if that's really important but you translate sometimes 'archive' as 'fichier archive' and sometimes just as 'archive', maybe it would be better to stick to one for consistency.. Even though this is fine, maybe 'Visitez notre site web'  would be better and again for consistency I would choose 'Visiter' but it depends on the context of how it is used in the app. For @perry-mitchell : in French you can translate 'Visit' as 'Visitez' which the imperative or 'Visiter' which is the infinitive. On action like 'Confirm' or 'Cancel' we usually use infinitive but for a text on web page that is supposed to invite people to do something, we would use imperative.. 'Supprimer d\u00e9finitivement' for consistency again. 'la' instead of 'cette' would make more sense, as there's only 1 of it. Afficher. not need for having 'archive' capitalised . translation doesn't mention errors anymore but I still think it is ok. ",
