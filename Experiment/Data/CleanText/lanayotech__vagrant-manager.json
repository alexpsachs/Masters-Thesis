    "amitailanciano": "Thanks Daniel, we'll be pushing out another update soon and we'll include high quality icons\n. @temperedvision we'll try to include it in the next major release\n. this has been addressed in release 1.5.0 (54686901a6e5bf9640074b2ada88b3bde23a7341)\n. Retina AppIcons have already been included in the upcoming 1.6 release\n. No, we'll take care of it! Thanks for bringing it up\n. this should be implemented in release 2.0\n. We are aware of that issue, that's actually the first item on our priority list; for now you just need to up from a terminal session only the first time so it's in your exports file, thereafter you shouldn't have any issues.\n. I've put together a test build that should address this issue, please download https://www.dropbox.com/s/px33c220zotd0k6/Vagrant%20Manager%201.4.3%20BETA.app.zip and post your results\n. this issue has been fixed by release 1.4.3 (269a17b)\n@tcsehv that is on our roadmap to address\n. this has been addressed in release 1.5.0 (54686901a6e5bf9640074b2ada88b3bde23a7341)\n. Thanks for the suggestion, we are planning to take advantage of the new global status/control features as soon as it is a viable replacement to the current manual detection process\n. Are you sure you're running the one you downloaded? I just downloaded 1.4.2 from the link you provided and it displays the correct version for me in the About pane. Sometimes (at least for me) if you use Spotlight to quickly find an app, it will find the ones in my Xcode debug folder, Downloads folder, etc.. make sure you aren't accidentally running the previous version, make sure you drop the new one in your Applications folder and that Spotlight shows that it's the one in your Applications folder\n. @davecaplinger try the build referenced at the end of this issue thread #6 \n. implemented in release 2.0\n. We've fixed this issue in a hotfix coming up, the cause is the removal of the Black theme icon, if you go into preferences and change your theme icon it should show up again.\n. This has already been implemented for the upcoming 1.6 release\n. Included in release 1.5.2\n. We will try to include a functionally equivalent feature in the upcoming 1.6 release\n. Implemented in release 1.5.3\n. This has been fixed in the develop branch, we'll push a hotfix later this evening\n. Fixed by release 1.5.2\n. I can't seem to reproduce the issue, can you try quitting Vagrant Manager and deleting the preferences file by issuing rm ~/Library/Preferences/lanayo.Vagrant-Manager.plist from your terminal, as well as killing the cfprefsd process running under your user, then restart Vagrant Manager?\n. I've been unsuccessful recreating this issue, can you please provide your Vagrantfile contents and output of VBoxManage showvminfo <your-troubled-machine-id-here> --machinereadable? Does it happen on every machine you bring up or just the one?\n. just pulled down the default box and I'm still unable to reproduce the issue, out of curiosity I'm assuming you replaced all occurrences of /Users/a464344/ with {USER_FOLDER}, or is that the exact output?\n. Just a stab in the dark here, but maybe try sudo opensnoop | grep 'Vagrant Manager' while the CPU is pegged like that and see if that gives you anything useful?\n. If you wouldn't mind updating the rest of the commands I will test and merge your changes\n. Thanks @danmatthews I've merged your changes into develop locally, (cbe2d44b3136dcb95ac6b047516d31bc102d5f1d), they'll be included in the next release\n. this will be fixed for iTerm2 in the next release.. \ud83d\ude05 . @aequasi my apologies, you're right, it has been re-opened. We would be happy to accept a pull request for this functionality, but it is not on our internal roadmap.\n. will take a look, thanks\n. confirmed, there is an issue detecting NFS machines when there are multiple shared folders in the same path tree.\nThis has been addressed locally and will be included in the next release, thanks for reporting the issue\n. should be fixed now (5d42940)\n. this functionality will be in the next release, thanks for the suggestion\n. this has been addressed and will be included in the next release, thanks for the suggestion\n. implemented in (afeb670)\n. should be fixed by (03e1e8b58fccfebabda1dbb05d0b98f365ad7602)\n. should be fixed by release 2.0.1\n. Great idea, it has been implemented and will be included in the next release\n. This has been implemented in release 2.0.2\n. Thank you! and thanks again for the great suggestion\n. If you open the bookmark manager and click into the display name cell, it should be editable. Once you've make the change, click the save button and it should rename your bookmark\n. We don't currently auto-detect fusion machines, but if you manually create a bookmark for it, you should be able to use/see it in the list.\n. Thanks for the info, I think I've found the source of the issue; I'll push out a hotfix as soon as it's fixed.\n. I've put together a test build for you, would you mind giving it a shot?\n. Glad to hear, would you also mind verifying that you can bring up the machine via the context menu after you've added the bookmark? Thanks again for your help resolving this issue\n. We'll look into that IOUnserialize issue, but I'm closing this issue for now, fixed by release 2.0.3\n. This may seem obvious, but I might also double check that you don't have the \"Refresh every _____\" option selected and set to a short amount of time\n. @aequasi is this still an issue?\n. I think that's a good idea, we'll put it in the next release\n. The custom UI in Vagrant Manager 2.0 was necessary due to some limitations to the native menu\nIn regard to your points:\n1.) We chose the colored indicators because there are more states than up/halted; for example when a box is suspended, it shows an orange indicator.\n2.) I think that's reasonable\n3.) This would really slow down the app on computers without SSD's. Also, if you removed a box, or halted/upped one, the box order might change just as you are about to click one.. which would be pretty irritating\n4.) Reasonable\n5.) Arguable to me, we show an indicator on that menu item if there is an update available; plus, it is technically an action, so it doesn't really make sense in my mind for it to be in Preferences\nI do agree that the new UI could look better, we'll look into possibly skinning it to look like the native OSX menu. Reverting back to the actual native menu is not an option due to aforementioned limitations.\nThanks for the input, we appreciate you taking the time to post your feedback\n. We really wanted Vagrant Manager 2.0 to be a real step up from 1.x, so one of the main reasons we switched stemmed from the inability to manage multi-machine instances. Only with the new custom UI was it really feasible to allow the app to show sub-machines of a vagrant instance in a submenu of that menu item and allow you to manage those in the same way. Another reason was due to difficulties refreshing/rebuilding the menu while it was still open.\nThere were other more minor things such as the 'Refresh' button closing the menu when clicked not being something we wanted, however it felt just as strange to click it and NOT have it close the menu since it was a menu item like the rest of them. The new custom UI gives us more control over those kinds of idiosyncrasies. Vagrant Manager 2.0 was a complete overhaul of 1.x, and in order to provide desired functionality, we had to part with the native menu.\nThere are plenty of menu apps that use custom views such as Dropbox, Adobe's Creative Cloud, iStat, etc.. everyone has their own tastes and preferences. The new custom UI allows us to keep the app functional in the way we wanted it to be, but we'll try to make it look more appealing in coming releases.\n. Due to popular demand we are currently re-implementing Vagrant Manager using the native OS X menu.\nWe'll put out a new release as soon as it's available, so keep an eye out\n. This has been addressed and will be included in the next release\n. It might appear there if it's refreshing your list of machines, or if you have the auto-refresh setting at a low interval.\nOther than that, it shouldn't be doing anything when it is idle\n. Due to popular demand we are currently re-implementing Vagrant Manager using the native OS X menu.\nWe'll put out a new release as soon as it's available, so keep an eye out!\n. duplicate of issue #39 \n. In order to help you debug, can you post the output of:\nVBoxManage showvminfo <machine_id_here> --machinereadable\nfrom one of your machines in question? You can get a list of your machine's with ID's by running:\nVBoxManage list vms\n. @Grillz still having trouble?\n. We plan to add this feature, thanks for the suggestion!\n. Should be fixed by (d849b157ecd8e250020aed02e4661d428a55477f)\n. This has been re-implemented and much improved, a hotfix will be coming soon\n. This has been resolved in Release 2.1.1\n. We'll see if we can make it refresh when the Mac awakes from sleep\n. I might suggest adding them as bookmarks. If you click \"Manage Bookmarks\", you can add them and then rename them by clicking into the Display Name cell and naming it whatever you like\n. for now, take a look at the Default Network Interface section in the vagrant docs:\n\nIf more than one network interface is available on the host machine, Vagrant will ask you to choose which interface the virtual machine should bridge to. A default interface can be specified by adding a :bridge clause to the network definition.\n\nconfig.vm.network \"public_network\", bridge: 'en1: Wi-Fi (AirPort)'\n. I agree, I believe we actually had this feature in an earlier version; we'll add it back in\nThanks for the suggestion\n. This should be resolved in Release 2.3.0\n. This has been implemented in Release 2.3.0\n. The refresh in general is a pretty intensive task, we scan for Vagrantfiles by examining paths in /etc/exports, parse the output of vagrant global-status, as well as query machine statuses using VBoxManage (and in the future, any other providers we will support). It is possible your system simply cannot keep up with that low of a refresh interval. The app queues up subsequent refreshes if it is already refreshing when a refresh is triggered, so that may explain why your system becomes gradually more sluggish, as the queue will continually increase if it cannot ever catch up. That said, perhaps the 5 second option should be removed\n. @burriko vagrant global-status does not always show correct statuses, and the --prune flag to force it to do so is very slow. Not only that, but it might not show VM's you may still have in your exports file if you use NFS, while showing some that you don't.. so we just like to include it as another scanner to get the best of both.\nI'm going to close this for now, perhaps @jbro 's comment is worth some investigation, or perhaps we'll add an option to allow you to choose or limit the scanners you want to use. We probably also only want to run vagrant status for machines we didn't match from the global status call. We'll work on reducing the scanning footprint in future releases.\n. Good suggestion, we'll change this for the next release\n. implemented in release 2.4.0\n. This has been fixed and will be included in the next release, along with #71\n. implemented in release 2.4.0\n. this has been fixed in release 2.4.0\n. release 2.4.0 should fix this issue\n. You might try running vagrant global-status --prune to clean up invalid entries, also if you're using NFS, edit your /etc/exports folder and remove any invalid paths, hope that helps\n. \nBased on the process details, it appears Vagrant Manager itself is not responsible for the high power usage, it is mostly the aggregate consumption of active virtual machines.\n. closing alongside #67 \n. vagrant commands are now executed with --no-color in release 2.4.0\n. release 2.4.0 should fix this issue\n. There is an option in the Preferences window to include the machine names, perhaps in the next release we'll include or change this option to show only the names instead.\n\n. @Camoflame if setting .name still produces (default) at the end of the folder name, then vagrant probably doesn't use that as the machine name in the vagrant global-status or vagrant status output, and that is the name we use. Alternatively, I just did a test using .define\nconfig.vm.define \"some_custom_name\"\nwhich does seem to do just that.\nHave a look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17845637/vagrant-default-name for more info\n. this has been implemented in release 2.4.0\n. Perhaps we'll one day add a tabular Vagrantfile editor of some sort, but I don't it makes very much sense to vagrant up when opening the file.\nI'll close this for now, but thank you for the suggestion\n. I don't think this is on the roadmap for vagrant manager, we want to keep it as simple as possible. release 2.4.0 should fix this issue\n. this has been merged into release 2.4.0, thanks again\n. Sorry it's been a while, we've been busy lately!\nWe'll test your changes against some of the referenced issues, I believe this will fix #83 as well. We'll probably put together a debug release for #76 to test with. Thanks for contributing :)\n. duplicate of #101 . @strider72 those were my initial thoughts as well, however I tested it with a colleague of mine who never upgraded to 2.4, and the issue was present. We haven't had time to look into it yet, but we will put out a hotfix as soon as it's patched\n. Fixed by release 2.4.1\n. Right now there isn't any way to do that, and there is a confirmation dialog for the destroy option just in case you happen to mis-click.\nI'll leave this open for a while for +1's, if it gets enough I'll consider adding it in\n. We're working on the best way to address this, however in the meantime, if you bookmark it, it will remember your preference\n. this will be included in the next release. Improved by release 2.4.1\n. I suppose it is a little strange, but that's just how Vagrant Manager has always worked.. it was originally an in house app, and our workflows generally involved creating a folder with the project name and a Vagrantfile at the root of it. There is an option in the preferences to append the actual box names in parens beside the folder name, so that might be something you'd like to enable\n. this will be included in the next release. This is already an option in Preferences\n. Hi Brian, what exactly happens when you click the SSH menu item? does it just do nothing?\n. release 2.4.4 will now show an error notification if the task was unsuccessful, thanks for the suggestion\n. It does that too :)\nThe notification will say \n`vagrant global-status --prune` command encountered an error, run command in a terminal window to debug\nSee https://github.com/lanayotech/vagrant-manager/commit/b2b9462c4fae6084c0413232de925abd32859754\n. See #111 for a temporary resolution to this issue\n. @incredimike can you provide your crash log?\n@andrew40 if you run vagrant global-status --prune in your terminal, does it list any machines?\n. Just did a few tests and it appears as though if you have an error in one of your the Vagrantfiles that is discovered by vagrant global-status --prune command, vagrant crashes with that error instead of displaying the normal global-status output; a hotfix will come soon that will show an error message instead of silently failing\n. well your error looks like this one:\nPath: /Users/andrewwilkinson/VagrantWP/hgv/Vagrantfile\nLine number: 299\nMessage: Errno::ENOENT: No such file or directory - ./provisioning/default-install.yml\nthat file does not exist.\n. @incredimike if Vagrant Manager is crashing completely, your issue is different than @andrew40's, a crash log would be helpful for me to look into it\n@andrew40 that error is not related to Vagrant Manager, I'm willing to wager if you just cd into that hgv directory and run vagrant status in your terminal, you will get the same error\n. @incredimike that's great, I'll go through it this evening and see what I can find, no need to post the entire thing; the dropbox link works\n. @incredimike can you possibly post the output of vagrant global-status --prune for me?\n. @fretwellian can you provide me with a crash log? I want to verify that it's the same issue as @incredimike. \nAlso, can you post the exact output? I'm assuming you don't actually have an xxx user :) or perhaps email it to me if you don't feel comfortable posting it here? You can email it to tai@lanayo.com\nI just need the exact output of vagrant global-status --prune to help get to the bottom of it, it sounds like it might be some edge case parsing that output; that is the only place substringWithRange is used in the whole project and that's the method in the stack trace from @incredimike that it bailed on\n. @sophistifunk can you post the output of vagrant global-status --prune for me to debug with?\n. Can you post it in its entirety or email it to me at tai@lanayo.com?\n. Sorry I wasn't clear, I meant the global status command, including the directory path\n. Please give this debug build a shot and post the results, it will log some debugging information in your system log, which you can view in the Console application or in your terminal.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/b6v3ccrirn43wy3/Vagrant%20Manager%20%282.4.2%20Debug%29.app.zip?dl=1\nUpdate: 08/06 7:28AM UTC-07:00 -- included an error message if global-status command fails\n. can you post the logged messages from your syslog? you can view them in the Console app; click Refresh in Vagrant Manager to log new messages.\nThe debug version will return no found instances if there was an issue finding the indexes for the output headers (name, provider, state, and directory) in the first line of the global status output.. the question now is why that is happening, hopefully those logs I put in should help\n. Perfect, that solves it; I'll push out a hotfix this evening, thanks to everyone for the help debugging\n. @andrew40 see the last post in this issue thread, https://github.com/lanayotech/vagrant-manager/issues/105 I believe that should help you resolve your issue\n. should be resolved by release 2.4.3\n. Looks like I missed a Regex option NSRegularExpressionAnchorsMatchLines for grabbing the header line, I'll push out a (hopefully) final hotfix release this evening after some further testing, my apologies for the previous hotfix\n. Just want to verify that the problem has been resolved before I put out another release, here's the upcoming 2.4.4 build, let me know if there are still issues ( @incredimike @bronzeiii @sophistifunk ):\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/hfgey5y0d4jid1i/Vagrant%20Manager%202.4.4b.app.zip?dl=1\n. Great, glad to hear that, release 2.4.4 is now available\n. If you could give this debug build a shot and post the results I'd really appreciate it, it will log some debugging information in your system log, which you can view in the Console application or in your terminal.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/b6v3ccrirn43wy3/Vagrant%20Manager%20%282.4.2%20Debug%29.app.zip?dl=1\nUpdate: 08/06 7:28AM UTC-07:00 -- included an error message if global-status command fails\n. I figured that was the case, I'll close this issue as the issue is not with Vagrant Manager; I will however be updating the app to show an error when vagrant global-status --prune fails\n. Did you see any notifications about vagrant global-status --prune failing? You can two finger swipe from the right of your trackpad to see missed notifications, try running it in your terminal window and make sure you're not getting any errors (I'm guessing you might since no other machines appear in the list except your bookmarks)\n. See #105 for the fix\n. No problem! :+1: I'll take a look as to why you might not be getting that notification as well\n. @Ipstenu there was indeed an issue with the notifications, would you mind giving this build a shot? I want to verify that the issue is resolved\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/hfgey5y0d4jid1i/Vagrant%20Manager%202.4.4b.app.zip?dl=1\n. I'll put together a debug build for you guys to test with, I'll try to post it here by this evening\n. Unrelated, but see #111 for a temporary resolution\n. sounds like the same as #107 \nI'll put together a debug build this evening\n. that'd be great, thanks\n. 2.4.4 uses only global-status for detection but there are some issues #111\nI recommend using 2.4.1 for now\n. Try checking the Preferences window and making sure your Refresh interval isn't set too low for your system to handle?\n. Sorry we've been busy lately, we'll try to put out a debug version to get some information here pretty soon\n. @jacobgraf are you still experiencing this issue with the latest vagrant & vagrant-manager builds?. thanks @StefanoCecere, I'm going to close this then. We'll try to put out a debug version for you soon\n. That has been the default behavior since release so we can't really change it at this point, but there is an option in the Preferences to include the name of the box.\n. Vagrant Manager currently has no way of getting notified if you perform vagrant actions against your boxes outside of the application, you'll need to hit Refresh to see the changes.\nThis is probably a good priority item for the next release, we'll look into it\n. @esszett is this still an issue with the latest vagrant & vagrant manager?. We'll look into this, maybe some kind of configuration window where you can build your own vagrant command chains and save them to be included in the actions list\n. @majksner @wernsting @bezhermoso is this still an issue with the latest vagrant & vagrant-manager?. You can halt all your machines by navigating to All Machines -> Halt\n. Thanks!\n. In order to eliminate this warning, we would need to pay for an Apple Developer Program license, which we have no plans to do at this time.\nThis project/software is completely open source and free to use, and our company name is present here in this repo and in the software itself.

Does it work when you try to up from the command line?. this will be fixed in the next release. We were unable to recreate this, but it may have been fixed by some other changes in the next release.\nPlease re-open if any of you are still experiencing issues after testing the latest release.. this issue should be fixed in the next release. this will be included in the next release, we may add the ability to use the terminal editor to edit the vagrant file in the future. We were unable to recreate this, but it may have been fixed by some other changes in the next release.\nPlease re-open if any of you are still experiencing issues after testing the latest release.. this will be included in the next release -- thanks!. this should be fixed in the next release. this has been merge and will be included in the next release, thank you for your contribution!. Absolutely, we'll make sure to add it to the default list in the next release.\nI also think it probably makes sense to allow users to manage the list of available providers themselves, since you can have custom providers. We'll add a place to do this in the next release as well.. this will be included in the next release. ",
    "davidjdixon": "This issue appears to be still outstanding, while there have been a number of releases made since the ticket was opened. Is there a timeline for the rollout of the retina images?\n. ",
    "chriswayoub": "Retina support is included in Release 1.5.0\n. We have a new beta release for version 2.0, which includes support for more providers. You can either set the \"Allowed Updates\" in your preferences to \"beta\" or lower to get the update through the app, or you can download it from our GitHub Releases page.\nThere is automatic detection for Parallels machines, but if the machines are not detected you can always add them as bookmarks and set the provider to \"parallels\". Let us know if you have any issues with the new build.\n. In the new version you added a bookmark, set the provider to parallels, and the machine won't come up? can you see what command it is running in the task output window? It should be:\n\nvagrant up --provider=parallels\n\nIf so, does that command work for you from the command line if you run it yourself?\n. We just released a beta that will hopefully resolve this issue. It should now prompt you for your password when sudo is required. You can grab the new version (1.3.3b1) from the release page. Let us know if you have any problems with this new build. We are going to put up a release build as soon as we have a chance to do some more testing.\n. Fixed by f4aad1b003a74ebe0641679b872b36850a41cfdc\n. Thanks for the report. This issue is fixed in the develop branch (5fb40b0457da1b88c53f427c5e881839b5cc4306), and will be included in the next release.\n. Duplicate of issue #4. This is fixed in the latest develop branch and will be included in the next release.\n. Thanks for reporting this issue. Can you run this command in your terminal:\n\nvboxmanage list runningvms\n\nAnd find the UUID of your machine (it will be the string in between { and } next to the appropriate machine). Then run this command in your terminal:\n\nvboxmanage showvminfo PUT_UUID_HERE --machinereadable\n\nReplacing PUT_UUID_HERE with the UUID from the previous step.\nIf you can send over the output from that second command, that should help.\n. That's a good catch. We'll get an update pushed out ASAP.\n. Can you check if release 1.4.2 solves your issue?\n. Thanks for the info, we are looking into this issue again.\n. What method are you using for folder sharing (NFS, rsync, etc). Also, here is a link to a debug build that should generate a vagrant-manager-TIMESTAMP.log file in your Documents folder:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/st3a5y6q09w1ddx/AAB1pIeFk3pgBu2sYMaZsTCja\nWe have been unable to recreate this issue, so could you run this build and email the log file to: lanayotech@gmail.com? I would not recommend using this build permanently since it will continue to generate large log files.\n. Vagrant Manager does rely on the \"/vagrant\" folder mapping to tell the difference between Vagrant machines vs other VirtualBox machines. For NFS machines, it checks the /etc/exports file since they do not have a \"/vagrant\" folder mapping. This issue may be related to that, but it looks like the output of VBoxManage posted by some users has the correct folder mappings, but the machines are still not showing up. I've built another debug build that will output more information to help troubleshoot this issue.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/3jv9l71tz8nvo2h/AABZDhsL-wLwGiV2UQWNQ_sba\nIf you can run that debug version of Vagrant Manager, a file should appear in your Documents folder called vagrant-manager-TIMESTAMP.log (TIMESTAMP will be a string of numbers). Send that file to lanayotech@gmail.com, or post it on pastebin.com or something similar, rather than posting it here since it will be a pretty long file. That should help to narrow down what is causing this issue.\nWe are planning on taking advantage of the new global-status command available in Vagrant 1.6, but we would still like to be able to support older Vagrant versions, so I'm interested in getting to the bottom of what is happening here.\n. @mikebell \n@ramondelafuente \n@nightmare-rg \n@robjmills \n@peternijssen \n@Jan0707 \n@tcsehv \nWe have a new build that will hopefully resolve all of the issues in this thread. Can you guys try this build and let us know the results?\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/09soyrkhhj87hvh/AAC2xspJWhxbq8wwENoaHGGYa\n. Send an email to lanayotech@gmail.com if you'd like to troubleshoot this issue offline. I can put together a debug build for you and send it there if necessary.\n. We looked into this before, but Sparkle framework is no longer actively maintained (at least not as far as I could find), and we couldn't find a suitable replacement. I would definitely like to add this functionality in at some point.\n. This fork looks promising: https://github.com/pornel/Sparkle\nWe'll be looking into this very soon.\n. @davecaplinger \nCan you try this new test build and see if it resolves your issue?\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/09soyrkhhj87hvh/AAC2xspJWhxbq8wwENoaHGGYa\n. Fixed by 269a17b4a537055db36676708b634812b888d5ea\n. Can you send an email to lanayotech@gmail.com to do some offline troubleshooting?\n. Can you give this build a try and let me know if it fixes your issue?\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/st3a5y6q09w1ddx/AAB1pIeFk3pgBu2sYMaZsTCja\n. This is definitely on our roadmap. I'll see if we can sneak it into the next release.\n. We have a new beta release for version 2.0, which includes support for more providers and multi-machine vagrant instances. You can either set the \"Allowed Updates\" in your preferences to \"beta\" or lower to get the update through the app, or you can download it from our GitHub Releases page.\n. Do you have the \"Instruments\" application available on your machine? If so, you can follow these instructions to try to get some more info about what might be causing the CPU load.\nWhen the application is using a lot of CPU:\n- Start Instruments\n- Create a new profile using the \"OS X -> CPU -> Time Profiler\" template\n- In the dropdown at the top of the window that says \"All Processes\", select \"Attach to Process\" and choose the Vagrant Manager process from the list\n- Hit the record button to start recording data\n- Let it run for a while (a minute or so) during the heavy CPU load\n- Hit the stop button\n- Choose \"File -> Save\" from the menu, check the box that says \"Save Current Run Only\"\nSend that .trace file that you just saved to lanayotech@gmail.com and we will take a look at it. Hopefully it will provide some hint as to what is eating up all the CPU.\n. It looks like this might be due to the task output window being open after the task is complete, and it goes into an infinite loop checking for task output.\nI've put together a fix for this, but if anyone having the issue can verify that this is the case it would be helpful. Do the people experiencing the issue have \"Auto-close task window\" unchecked in Preferences? If so, when you experience the issue, can you choose \"Windows -> Bring all to front\" from the menu when you see the issue happening, and see if there is a task window open? Close the task window and see if the CPU usage goes down.\nIn any case, I was able to get my CPU to spike when I had an open task window, so we'll be pushing out a fix for this soon.\n. This is resolved in Release 1.5.4\n. I'm not sure how I feel about trying to parse and modify the Vagrantfile automatically. In case you don't already know, Vagrant has port collision handling built-in. Check out the port forwarding section of the manual. I'll leave this open in case someone comes up with a good solution, but I looked into it a bit and it seems like detecting the collision error message wouldn't be an issue, but actually parsing the Vagrantfile to find the port forwarding configuration and changing it might be error prone. There are also other usability issues, such as dealing with multi-machine setups, and it looks like \"vagrant up\" stops after the first detected port collision, so it wouldn't be able to fix all port collisions in one pass if there are multiple collision.\n. Right now, it runs some AppleScript to launch the terminal window. I haven't had any luck making it smart enough to open a new tab if there is already a terminal window open when using Terminal. AppleScript seems to be not very well supported in Terminal, unfortunately.\nWhen using iTerm2, it does open in a new tab, but if you don't have a window open it creates a new window and opens a new tab, so you end up with a first blank tab, along with a second tab that executes the correct command.\nHere is the current AppleScript in use if anyone would like to try and improve it:\nFor Terminal:\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    activate\n    do script \"%@\\\"\nend tell\nFor iTerm2:\ntell application \"iTerm\"\n    tell current terminal\n        launch session \"Default Session\"\n        delay .15\n        activate\n        tell the last session\n            write text \"%@\"\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n. We have a new beta release for version 2.0, which includes this option. You can either set the \"Allowed Updates\" in your preferences to \"beta\" or lower to get the update through the app, or you can download it from our GitHub Releases page.\nWe should have an official 2.0 release in the near future.\n. 2.0 has been released, and contains this feature. You can download it from our GitHub Releases page.\n. We've put in a fix for this issue, and will be pushing out an update very soon.\nDuplicate of issue #18 \n. This likely means that your virtual machine still exists in VirtualBox, but the folder with the Vagrantfile no longer exists. Can you check if the actual virtual machine still exists in your VirtualBox GUI? If you delete it from there, then Vagrant Manager should stop detecting it.\nIf this is not the case, let us know and we can troubleshoot further.\n. We have a new beta release for version 2.0, which includes support for more providers. You can either set the \"Allowed Updates\" in your preferences to \"beta\" or lower to get the update through the app, or you can download it from our GitHub Releases page.\nThere is no automatic detection for VMware machines, but you can always add them as bookmarks and set the provider to \"vmware_fusion\". I don't actually use VMware, but in theory it should just work since we are passing in the --provider flag to vagrant. Everything else should be the same since it now uses vagrant for machine status detection instead of VBoxManage.\n. 2.0 has been released, and contains this feature. You can download it from our GitHub Releases page.\n. Since we don't actually use VMWare here, and I don't have it available to test with, please let us know if you run into any issues!\n. Version 2.2.0 now executes bash as a login shell, which should respect your .bash_profile\n. Which version of Vagrant Manager are you running? Does this only happen when you have running machines?\n. In release 2.1.0, there is now an option in preferences to display the machine names in the top-level menu labels. You can download it from the Releases page.\n. The native menu has been re-implemented in release 2.1.0. You can download it from the Releases page.\n. The native menu has been re-implemented in release 2.1.0. You can download it from the Releases page.\n. Are you using NFS for folder syncing? If so, can you provide the relevant lines from your /etc/exports file?\n. Currently, we detect which machines are vagrant machines (versus virtual machines not managed by vagrant) based on shared folder mappings. It looks to me like your machines don't have folder mappings that Vagrant Manager can use to check whether or not it's a vagrant machine. We've implemented machine detection using vagrant global-status in the upcoming release, so if the machines show up there then the next release should (hopefully) properly detect your machines.\n. Vagrant machine detection has been improved in release 2.1.2. Can you see if this resolves your issue? You can download the new release from the Releases page.\n. Version 2.2.0 adds Custom Commands, which lets you execute shell commands on the Vagrant machine over SSH. With this, you can add a command such as \"vim /etc/hosts\" and check the \"Run in Terminal\" checkbox to edit the Vagrant machine's /etc/hosts file. We may revisit this at a future date to expand this functionality.\n. In release 2.1.2, the vagrant machine statuses are now updated on wake from sleep. You can download the new release from the Releases page.\n. In release 2.1.2, a preference has been added to show the path to the machine rather than the display name. You can download the new release from the Releases page.\n. Vagrant machine detection has been improved in release 2.1.2. Can you verify that your machines are now being displayed (they should show up as long as vagrant global-status can see them)? You can download the new release from the Releases page.\n. Version 2.2.0 adds Custom Commands, which lets you execute shell commands on the Vagrant machine over SSH\n. Vagrant Manager 2.2.0 now dealiases all instances of the cd command using a backslash.\n. We are still looking into this. Vagrant expects a TTY for choosing the interface to bridge to, and we haven't been able to find a way to inject input to that prompt.\n. Unfortunately, there is no official way to do this that I am aware of. It's a feature of NSMenuExtra (which is an internal private class that you can't officially use), and we use NSStatusItem (the supported method of putting something in the status bar). For whatever reason, an NSStatusItem can't be rearranged in the status bar. I don't think this will be implemented unless Apple provides some official way to do it.\n. Version 2.2.0 adds Custom Commands, which lets you execute shell commands on the Vagrant machine over SSH\n. Version 2.2.0 now executes bash as a login shell, which should respect your .bash_profile\n. Version 2.2.0 adds a preference to disable the icon animation.\n. Version 2.2.0 adds back in the \"Window\" menu to show all open windows.\n. We are currently investigating this issue. We have had several reports of this happening, and have noticed it ourselves as well. I think we've tracked it down and can hopefully release a fix tonight.\n. Release 2.2.1 should resolve this issue.\n. Can you try choose \"Open in Finder\" from both of them? Do they both open the same exact folder on your system? It indexes the discovered machines based on their path, so it shouldn't be able to detect it twice if the machine is in the same folder. I'm trying to think of how this could be possible, but nothing comes to mind. We can put together a debug build to get some more troubleshooting info from you if we need to.\n. Did you happen to rename the folder your Vagrant machine is in? I was able to recreate this by renaming the folder that my Vagrant machine was in to the same folder name with different capitalization. The vagrant global-status command still shows the folder as the original capitalization, but Vagrant Manager detects it with the new capitalization and regards it as a different path. We have looked into a few solutions, but none of them are straightforward. The filesystem can be case-sensitive or case-insensitive, so we can't assume it is the same path. We also looked into comparing inodes of the two paths, but inodes can be identical if they are on different file systems so that would require changes to the core of how we detect Vagrant machines.\nI don't think there is a fix that we will be implementing for this issue right now, but we would welcome a pull request that addresses it.\n. I've duplicated this bug on my machine and will look into a solution.\n. It looks like this is caused by the default settings in Terminal, and I haven't found a reliable workaround that doesn't cause other issues. You can see an explanation in this forum post:\nhttp://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1291-terminal-action-repeats-when-opening-new-tabs/\n\nOS X's default is that New tabs open with: Same Settings. This means that if, for example, you began a terminal session by SSH'ing into another machine, a new tab will also attempt to SSH into that machine. To alleviate this behavior, switch it to Default Settings.\n\n\nThe AppleScript support is pretty poor in Terminal, I'd recommend using iTerm2 and setting that as your preferred terminal in Vagrant Manager.\n. The --no-color option is documented here. If you run vagrant up with the --no-color option from the command line, does it still show those console codes? Or is it only in our task output window?\n. This is interesting... we don't do anything destructive when detecting machines. We check the output of vagrant global-status, use VBoxManager to query VirtualBox machines, prlctl to query Parallels machines, and check the /etc/exports file for any NFS mounts. We actually don't do anything specific to VMware, and none of the above should do anything to alter any files as far as I know. All we are doing is issuing the following command in bash:\n\n\\cd PATH_TO_VAGRANT_MACHINE; vagrant status\n\nAnd then parsing the output. We do run all of our machine checks concurrently on different threads, could that be causing an issue? I can't really think of anything else off the top of my head.\nI haven't used VMware myself, so I'll have to grab the trial and see if I can recreate this issue.\n. I think between the confirmation dialog and the \"Require option key for destroy\" preference I'm going to consider this resolved.. This feature has been implemented in the latest release. Can you try the latest release (2.5.0) and let me know if you are still experiencing this issue? If it is, does it happen to all machines? Does it happen with all vagrant commands or only certain ones?\n. Can you try the latest version of Vagrant Manager (2.5.0) and let me know if this is still an issue? If it is, would it be possible for you to provide some steps to reproduce what you are experiencing?\n. The AppleScript syntax changed for version 2.9. I have put together working AppleScript for 2.9, but I haven't been able to make a version that will work for both 2.9 and earlier versions. I'm not an AppleScript expert and I haven't had much luck on Google so if anyone can provide some assistance it would be appreciated. Here is the AppleScript that works for 2.9:\ntell application \"iTerm\"\n    activate\n    tell current window\n        create tab with default profile\n        tell current session\n            write text \"echo 'test'\"\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\nand here is the current AppleScript we have for earlier versions (I'm testing on 2.1.4):\ntell application \"iTerm\"\n    tell current terminal\n        launch session \"Default Session\"\n        delay 0.15\n        activate\n        tell the last session\n            write text \"echo 'test'\"\n        end tell\n    end tell\nend tell\n.

This should be resolved in 2.5.0. If you are still having this issue, please re-open the ticket.\n. Machine state detection no longer uses vagrant global-status, so this issue should be resolved. If you are still having problems related to this, please re-open this issue.\n. This feature has been added in version 2.5.0\n. This feature has been added in version 2.5.0\n. This feature has been added in version 2.5.0. Unfortunately, we were not able to open the hosts file in the default text editor automatically due to permission issues (the file is owned by root), so it opens in terminal using sudo. There is a new preference to choose either nano or vim as the editor.\n. vagrant rdp has been added in version 2.5.0\n. What version of OS X are you running?\n. This feature has been implemented in the latest release. This is interesting, we don't actually do anything with VMWare directly. We run vagrant global-status, scan the NFS exports, query VirtualBox, and query Parallels. Can you see if log files are created when you run vagrant global-status on its own?\n. I don't think Vagrant Manager is doing anything special to cause these logs. The only thing we run would be vagrant global-status. Do the log files get created when you run that as well? I'm guessing this log file is created even without Vagrant Manager, but the name probably has the PID in it, and since we run the refresh in it's own process it keeps creating new files instead of writing to the same one. This is just a guess though, and I don't think there is anything we can do to fix this on our end.. Since the app is an agent app (it doesn't have a main UI), I think it's causing issues sometimes when presenting windows. We're considering solutions, but the best one we've found so far is to not make it an agent app which means it will always show an icon in the dock. Clicking on the dock icon would do nothing, since there is no main window to display, so we are trying to come up with the most acceptable solution for this.\n. This feature has been implemented in the latest release. This feature has been implemented in the latest release. This issue has been addressed in release 2.5.1\n. Thanks for the contribution. This issue has been addressed in the latest release, and the commit (582e6f4dccdad27a17b7ac4e151af2b12ce71d33) tries to do a better job of parsing the output of vagrant version --machine-readable so that it will continue to work for older versions of Vagrant and hopefully it will not break again in the future.\n. I'm not familiar with AppCatalyst, do you still control the boxes with Vagrant commands even without the Vagrant plugin? (ie: vagrant up, vagrant down, etc)\n. We're packaging a release that addresses this issue. It will most likely be available sometime today.\n. Version 2.5.3 addresses this issue\n. There is not currently any command line functionality built in to Vagrant Manager, but you should be able to set the preferences via the defaults OS X command that is documented here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/defaults.1.html\nHere's a quick example that will enable auto-refresh at 15 minute intervals:\ndefaults write lanayo.Vagrant-Manager \"refreshEvery\" \"1\"\ndefaults write lanayo.Vagrant-Manager \"refreshEveryInterval\" \"900\"\nThe list of available preferences isn't documented anywhere, but once you've set them through the Preferences window in the application, you can get a list of them:\ndefaults read lanayo.Vagrant-Manager\nIt's very likely that setting these preferences while Vagrant Manager is running will not take effect until the app is restarted, so it would be safest to set the preferences before you start the application.\n. We are looking into this. I'll let you know if we need more info from you.\n. Thanks for the contribution! We're going to testing and merging this shortly and we'll get it in the next release.\n. Thanks for the detailed report! This has been fixed in commit ec05c2dc11c41813c737271c4e4c367f439d1abf\nWe'll include it in the next release.\n. Thanks for the report, this has been fixed and will be included in the next release\n. This feature has been implemented in the latest release. Can you verify that the trigger runs when you vagrant reload from the command-line? It your screenshots, it looks like you are running vagrant halt; vagrant up and through Vagrant Manager you are doing a vagrant reload. Your example trigger is set to run on config.trigger.after :up do. I'm not familiar with that plugin, but it might not be running your commands on vagrant reload, only when you specifically call vagrant up.\n. Some quick testing showed that this is possible, but it seems strange that there is no indication that anything is even happening at all until the command finishes. There would probably need to be some other indicator that an action is in progress. If we can find a decent way to present this then I'll see about getting it into the next release. Thanks for the feedback!\n. This feature has been implemented in the latest release. Are you using Terminal or iTerm? There has always been some trouble trying to open the tabs since the AppleScript we used seems kind of glitchy. We've spent time trying to work that issue out, but haven't been able to come up with a reliable solution. We're open to pull requests if there is a better way to open the terminal to a specific location.\n. I'm seeing this issue on Sierra as well. It looks like Vagrant actually runs 4 sudo commands when configuring NFS, so it's prompting 4 times. The terminal remembers your sudo password for a short while so it only prompts you once, but the same is not happening in the NSTask in Vagrant Manager for some reason. I haven't come up with any solution within Vagrant Manager itself yet, but this sudoers adjustment stopped it from prompting me multiple times:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/39474047/sudo-command-on-macos-sierra-does-not-respect-timestamp-timeout\nHere is some info about the security ramifications of changing that option:\nhttps://derflounder.wordpress.com/2016/09/21/tty_tickets-option-now-on-by-default-for-macos-sierras-sudo-tool/\n. I don't think there is a good way to resolve this on our end. The \"right\" way would be to use privilege escalation, but in that case it's going to ask you for your password every single time regardless of whether or not it needs it for the command it is running, and I don't think that's convenient at all. There isn't a great way for us to know whether or not the command you are running actually requires privilege escalation beforehand. I think the best solution is the one mentioned in the Vagrant docs. Sorry for this inconvenient behavior, if anyone has a good solution then we can re-open this issue.. That looks like it might be unrelated to Vagrant Manager. Can you take a look at the recommendations here and see if it resolves your issue?\nhttp://superuser.com/questions/1044130/why-am-i-having-how-can-i-fix-this-error-shell-session-update-command-not-f\n. @octalmage can you provide a stripped down Vagrantfile that causes issues for you so that I can test the same file on my end? Multi-machine boxes should work properly, can you provide any more details about what exactly is happening in your case? Can you also provide the version of Vagrant and Vagrant Manager that you are running?\n. The issue here is that we need to be able to find the path to the Vagrantfile using one of the following methods:\n a bookmark you've added to Vagrant Manager\n looking at the output of \"vagrant global-status\"\n* looking at your /etc/exports file\nIn all 3 of those cases, if you rename the folder then none of those methods will be pointing to your Vagrantfile anymore. They are all pointing at the old folder name. There isn't any way for us to find your Vagrantfile without scanning your whole drive, and that's too resource intensive to do on a regular basis. If you use the option to recursively scan for machines in the Manage Bookmarks window then it will find your Vagrantfile in the new folder, or you can up it at least once from the command line so that one of the detection methods mentioned above will work.\n. There is definitely an issue somewhere with the popups in general. I think it's due to the fact that the app does not have a main window, sometimes the dialogs open in the background, sometimes they hang the entire app and don't open at all. It actually just hangs on the runModal call so I'm still not sure what is causing it. We've be thinking about adding in a main window for the app anyway since the popup menu alone is getting pretty full and there are still more options we'd like to add. I'll leave this open for now even though I don't have a solution at the moment.\n. I don't know if there is solution for this other than making our app a foreground app (which will cause an icon to always appear in the dock). That \"check for updates\" window is opened internally by the Sparkle updater library, so I don't think there is anything we can do to force it to appear in the foreground. Try enabling the \"Halt machines on exit\" option in preferences (which turns the app into a foreground app), and I think you'll see the issue go away. We did not want to force all users to have that icon in their dock all of the time since it's pretty useless, so we have left it as a background application even though it causes some issues with the popups.. Thanks for the contribution!\n. This issue has been resolved in the latest release. This issue has been resolved in the latest release. Are you still having this issue? I haven't been able to recreate it. Can you try the latest release?. I believe you are now running into issue #149. Can you check if the check for updates window is actually just hidden behind your other windows? It won't show up in Expos\u00e9 or your window list so you'll have to move your other windows out of the way to find it.. What Vagrant version are you on?. Can you paste your output from vagrant version --machine-readable? Are you using a shell other than bash?. I agree, and I'm not sure why it would just hang. It should at least give you back an error if it couldn't parse the output of that command, so I'll look into why it might not. When the window opens behind your other windows, it does cause Vagrant Manager to hang and stop responding to any commands until that window is closed. Is it possible the window letting you know \"there was a problem checking the version\" was open somewhere behind your other windows?. Are you still having this issue? I haven't been able to recreate it. Can you check the latest release. What are your Vagrant and VirtualBox versions?. This issue has been resolved in the latest release. I used AppCleaner to find a list of files on my machine. Some of these may not apply to you:\n\n/Applications/Vagrant Manager.app\n~/Library/Application Support/CrashReporter/Vagrant Manager*\n~/Library/Caches/lanayo.Vagrant-Manager. We'll look into this. At the very least it shouldn't crash if it gets an unexpected value from the vagrant command.. This has been resolved and we're putting together a new release that addresses this along with other issues that have been reported (and some features that have been requested).. This issue has been resolved in the latest release. Do you have the \"Halt machines on exit\" option enabled in your preferences?. Unfortunately, we can't hide the dock icon if \"halt on exit\" is enabled or the system won't wait on Vagrant Manager when it's shutting down. OS X doesn't let background apps pause the shutdown process to finish what they were doing, it just force kills the process.. Are you still having this issue? I'm not able to recreate this. The closest thing I can think of is people have trouble with a dialog opened by Vagrant Manager that gets hidden behind their other windows and keeps focus so you can't do anything else in Vagrant Manager. But it usually doesn't happen immediately, it's sort of random. If you're having a different issue I can try to get you a debug build with some logging.\n\nCan you provide me the versions of:\n Vagrant\n Vagrant Manager\n VirtualBox\n OSX version\nAnd also the output of vagrant global-status and VBoxManage list vms.. Yeah, we can add an option for micro in the next release. Sorry you're having trouble...\nCould you let me know your versions of:\n Vagrant\n VirtualBox\n* Vagrant Manager\nAlso the values in your Preferences and the output of \"vagrant global-status\" from the command line? Do you have the Use Provider Machine Detection option checked in Preferences, and does that seem to make any difference?. This is actually from VirtualBox (or possibly whatever VM provider you are using). Since Vagrant Manager owns the process that runs the Vagrant commands, it requests that permission through Vagrant Manager when the box is launching.\nIf you launch a box directly from VirtualBox you should see the same prompt (if you haven't previously granted permission).\nThere is some discussion about the same issue here\n\nJust disable audio directly on Virtualbox: VM Settings > audio > Uncheck \"Enable Audio\".. \n",

Ok, W00T, I now have one running box. Does Vagrant Manage rely on the virtualbox guest additions? Because I solved an issue with that and suddenly the new box showed up.\n. When I destroyed the box, a new basebox was used because that was updated in the meantime. The new basebox could not be started because of a missing symlink to the Virtualbox Guest additions on the guest (a problem we created, we make our own baseboxes). \nI took two steps:\n1. I changed the /vagrant share to type: \"nfs\". I could now start the box, but not see it in Vagrant Manage.\n2. I fixed the missing symlink and started the box with the default /vagrant share, and now the box shows up in Vagrant Manage.\n. Hmm - there seems to be a lag between starting boxes and seeing them in the list; perhaps I am barking up the wrong tree with the Guest additions.\nI now have two working boxes, where it took a full minute to see it as \"running\" in Vagrant Manage after starting the box. But it does work now. I will try destroying and re-creating more boxes later tonight.\n. ",

Update: File picker crashed again, but suddenly found the bookmark appeared in the Vagrant Manager list even though it never appeared in the table view in the manage bookmarks screen, so the bug may be more in the rendering of a picked bookmark than in the picking process.\nUsing OSX 10.9.4\n. Awesome stuff - bookmark appears, I can add and remove it as expected, nothing showing up in the logs other than this warning: \n23/09/2014 2:19:37.488 pm VBoxSVC[13754]: FIXME: IOUnserialize has detected a string that is not valid UTF-8, \"\ufffd\ufffd?\".\nThis is consistently triggered when I press the save bookmark button and then a second time a few seconds later.\nThat warning predates the test build, checking the logs it started yesterday which corresponds with when I started using the fusion plugin so it's got to be a different issue.\n. Suspended and resumed from the context menu without any problems.\nI think the event that drives that IOUnserialize warning is actually the list refresh - hitting the refresh button and any event that triggers a refresh seem to cause it, basically it appears to happen whenever the refresh spinner starts spinning and then the second instance is just before it stops spinning (about a 9 second delay each time).\n.

Pretty much the top of the line MBP available today with the exception of one model that has a faster CPU. The only product that Apple sells with better specs is the Mac Pro, and I suppose that one shouldn't need an $4k machine to get decent refresh performance. This seems like a performance problem more to do with Virtual Box or Vagrant's performance than Vagrant Manager, but I wanted to draw attention to it in case there is something that can be done in this project. As you say, maybe a longer low-end refresh rate is in order and that's all there is to it. Thanks again!\n. ",

I had the refresh interval set to every 15 minutes too, which I thought was fairly conservative.\nObviously the refresh is an intensive task, but would there be a way to run it at a very low priority using nice or something similar?  Or perhaps try to do less during an automated refresh? For instance, all I really want to achieve with the refresh is to know which VMs are running or not, and it would seem that a call to vagrant global-status should provide this information.\n. ",

Did some additional testing with a second laptop (same version of Vagrant manager).\nRunning vagrant up --no-color turns off bold text and colors in both.

    "ryanaltvater": "I am also on El Capitan and just installed 2.5.1 after having reformatted my MacBook in the last week. My issue is kind of similar? Maybe it's just feedback about the refresh interval feature. Before I went through the reformat process, Vagrant Manager would auto-refresh after I had run \"vagrant up\". I'm unsure what version I had previously. Currently, it doesn't auto-refresh anymore and I have to enable the preference to auto-refresh every specified interval. Was this changed on purpose? I prefer Vagrant Manager auto-refreshing after the \"vagrant up\" process has finished and that's it, rather than constantly refreshing on its own when it doesn't need to. I can't say that I'm personally in need of the feature, but I don't want to have to manually refresh either. I've been using the VM count as a real-time indicator of VMs that are up and running, when I'm switching from project to project. If the refresh interval preference is too short, my MacBook starts to scream. If the interval is too long, then it's delayed and can be confusing when it shows or doesn't show a VM is up and running when I performed a vagrant action a while ago. Would it be possible to include another preference checkbox to only do a refresh after a vagrant process has finished?\n. Just ran into this myself. I think it would be nice to not have the icon displayed in the dock at all, or at least an sub-option of hiding the dock icon if the \"Halt machines on exit\" option is enabled.. ",
