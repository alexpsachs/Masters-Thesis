LGTM!\n. LGTM! :shipit: \n. @priyankurs - As @geof90 explained. Look at the explanation below for root cause.\n@silhouettes - let me elaborate. \nWhen we add commands for app we add them in this order(# demand count) - [add(3), list(2), ls(2), remove(3), rename(5), rm(5)]. (lets call this list1)\nNow when ever you run a command, yargs first checks the usage of the command by finding which command you are trying to run(add, list, ls...) it checks this ordered list of commands against all the arguments of the command you are trying to execute code-push app rm ls => [rm, ls] (lets call this list2)\nYargs first checks commands in the list1 against list2(this is the bug/or conscious decision with yargs, I feel it should be list2 checked against list1), if it finds any it checks its usage for demand count, if that succeeds it proceeds further otherwise shows help. Since 'ls' is the preceding command(and the first match in this list comparison) in the list1 above, it checks its demand count(which is 2) however the command you passed has count of '3'(app, rm, ls), thereby showing us the usage help, due to count mismatch(that's the only usage check).\n```\nisValidCommand = true;\nyargs.usage(USAGE_PREFIX + \" app \" + commandName + \" [--format ]\")\n    .demand(/count/ 2, /max/ 2)  // Require exactly two non-option arguments.\n    .example(\"app \" + commandName, \"Lists apps in tabular format\")\n    .example(\"app \" + commandName + \" --format json\", \"Lists apps in JSON format\")\n    .option(\"format\", { default: \"table\", demand: false, description: \"The output format (\\\"json\\\" or \\\"table\\\")\", type: \"string\" });\naddCommonConfiguration(yargs);\n```\nNow when you run 'code-push app rm add', you are right, following this logic we should see the add usage, however the command runs successfully. The reason is the demand count of add(coincidentally is 3) same as rm command, once the usage check(which only checks the demand count) is succeeded our command-parser validates the order of commands and executes them, hence it works fine. Same is true of 'rename' command, if you tried to remove app named 'rename' it will give you help for it since its usage checks demand count of 5.\nI agree this fix is kind of a workaround, given that this is such a corner case(only having names of apps & deployments as that of the commands), I strongly feel that it is not worth time/effort finding a better way to fix it. I will open up a bug on yargs for this issue. \n@geof90 - The precedence is in the way I explained above. The commands that are added chronologically are the first whose usage is checked. In case of 'rm add' it will be add and in case of 'add rm' as well it will be add, because 'add' was added before 'rm' command.\n. We have added support for this issue. It has been merged in with #78 PR.\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. This is how it looks.\n\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM\n. LGTM! :shipit: \n. Looks good.\n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM! \n. LGTM\n. LGTM\n. It is possible that the checkForUpdate would give you isMandatory = true even though you specified in the latest release mandatory = false. This would be only when, if at any point in release history for the given binary version(app version) there was a release which had a mandatory flag set. And the checkForUpdate calls with a packageHash that is older than the previous release which was mandatory.\nFor eg:\nRelease     AppVersion               isMandatory         packageHash\nv1               1.0.0               false                abc\nv2               1.0.0               true                 def\nv3               1.0.0               false                xyz\nNow if you were to checkForUpdate with someone on v1 label, you will get a v3 update with isMandatory set to true\n@kevinejohn - Is this something that might be going on with your issue here? \n.

We thought about this when we implemented the promote feature but we weren't sure if it would be valuable. For your example I think it would be useful.\ncode-push promote <AppName> <Deployment1> <Deployment2> -l <label to promote>\nWe can add an optional label parameter[default: latest label] to the promote command which would pick up the corresponding label from Deployment1 and promote to Deployment2.

We will keep you posted once we have it implemented.\n. @silhouettes should be able to answer it.. Looks Good.\n. Looks good.\n. @alma-socar - As a workaround you can clear the history(if you have a single release) so that no new people can get the update\ncode-push deployment clear <appName> <deploymentName>\nAlso, you can disable an update so that specific update is no longer available to download.\ncode-push patch <appName> <deploymentName>\n[--label <releaseLabel>]\n[--disabled <isDisabled>]\nThis won't rollback the people who already got a buggy update, but would mitigate future clients from receiving the update.\n. does anyone know which modules need Python?

For example, how does the precedence work between add and rm? Does it work if we do we do add rm and rm add?\n. Thanks for explaining!\nBased on that explanation, making rm precede everything else is I think a valid workaround. Sure, there may be some names that cannot be added, but at least there will never be anything that is added that cannot be subsequently removed, hence it is the lesser of two evils.\nLGTM. :+1: \n.

Thanks for reporting!\n. Thanks for the pro tip. Fixed. :)\n. Hi @TanTan-TT, could you clarify what exactly you mean by \"behind proxy\"? What exact problems are you facing when you download the CLI and try to invoke it?\n. LGTM\n. Confirmed that this is a bug. Closing this issue and tracking it in the react native repo https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/39 since it rightfully belongs there.\n. Firstly, thank you for your issue, however it is a react native client plugin issue so it rightfully belongs at the https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push repo.\nNext, to explain what you are seeing. When the dialog button is pressed, the package will first be downloaded first. After it is downloaded then will the promise resolve with the UPDATE_APPLIED status. At the time when you receive that status, the call to localPackage.apply() will call into native code to begin the process to asynchronously restart the app. It is only in that short window of time that your spinner action will be executed, hence it might not show at all. See the implementation of sync() for more details: https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/CodePush.ios.js#L162\nTherefore, at least for now, if you want to do something like show a spinner, you need to use the other API methods directly (ie. not via the sync function). I would recommend the best time to show a spinner to be during remotePackage.download(). Our sync function internally uses these API methods, so you can take a look at the implementation to see how you would use those methods yourself. https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/CodePush.ios.js#L149\nWe are definitely looking at improving the sync() functionality, and your spinner scenario is something we think is interesting and may support in the future, so thank you for your feedback! \n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. Looks good! Thanks @shawnXiao!\n. LGTM!\n. cc @dlebu\n. @dlebu We're gonna wait for some other changes e.g the app collaboration feature as well as other management SDK changes to support viewing metrics before bumping the version.\n. Richard + Jonathan's comments:\n1. Are we going to add the appVersion for each labelled package then? Will this make the sort order look weird (considering you can do something like releasing v1 with appVersion 1.0.0, v2 with 1.0.1, and then v3 back to 1.0.0)?\n2. Will display percentages for Active. The concern I had was that the deploymentHistory command does not show metrics for binary app versions, so the percentages may not sum to 100, but i guess that's okay.\n3. I prefer to have the percentage beside the Active metric. \n4. What will the success/fail percentages indicate? Is it just for that particular label, i.e. Success + fail for a label = 100%?\n5. Not showing it if 0 and showing it red if >0 makes sense to me.\n6. I don't like the term \"Users\". If I upgraded to a newer version, could I still be a User? It doesnt have the connation of having a particular label it as the current version..\nAlso to Jonathan's suggestion of displaying installs/downloaded as Installs: 3,345 (56 pending) - I feel it is confusing because is the total number of downloads 3345+56 = 3401, or is it 3345, with 3345-56 = 3289 being the number of confirmed installs? I think displaying install and download numbers seperately is clearer.\n. I have made some changes, here's how the display looks now:\n\n. I've removed the \"deployment metrics\" command and added the total active count in brackets.\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. The SDK still uses try-json though. It seems like the warning will appear since the CLI takes a dependency on the SDK. But as far as this change goes, LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. Hi @jlebensold\nThe behaviour you are seeing is expected behaviour. The way rollback protection works is that we rely on a call to notifyApplicationReady() or sync() (which calls notifyApplicationReady() internally) to signal that a update has been applied successfully. Otherwise, when the app process is killed and restarted, during the next boot up the plugin will detect that in the update that notifyApplictionReady() was not called in the update that was last applied, and therefore trigger a rollback.\nIn a typical application, snyc() or notifyApplictionReady() will be called automatically if you place the call inside the componentDidMount() React component lifecycle event, which is what we prescribe in our docs. The sample app is different in that, sync() is only called when the \"sync\" button is pressed. Therefore, after an update is applied, you need to press the \"sync\" button again in order to get the update to stick. The reason why the sample app was (perhaps a bit oddly) designed as such is so that we can easily do a manual test of the rollback feature by putting the call to notifyApplicationReady() in a button press so we can choose to manually confirm the update if we need to. Again, in a typical application, if you put the call to sync() or notifiyApplictionReady() inside componentDidMount(), you should see updates stick around without having the user perform any manual action, which is probably the expected behaviour for most applictions.\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM otherwise!\n. Yup, it didn't\n. LGTM!\n. Is --bundleName ok?\n. @lostintangent done\n. Yep done!\n. LGTM!\n. @ryuyu @lostintangent looks like the VSTS extension should incorporate this change too!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. Updated the docs, merging.\n. I've also taken a stab at updating the docs\n. Actually i think it would make more sense for the hostname to be customizable (and possibly renamed to something like \"createdFrom\"). We default it to the host name for the CLI, but there may be cases we want to explicitly annotate it with something else e.g. created from HockeyApp servers. What do you think?\n. Also if we wanted the description to be mandatory, we could throw an exception if it is not provided.\nBut in terms of doing what it's intended to do, this change LGTM.\n. Were you intending to add some test cases for this command and update the docs?\n. LGTM!\n. I've also verified that the plist library (for iOS) doesn't run into the same issue.\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. @lostintangent I updated the docs.\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. Hey @gunters63, what the \"rollback\" operation is it takes the latest prior update and brings it forward, so that clients will download the older update instead. In this case where there is only one update, we can't perform this operation because CodePush doesn't know what artifacts are shipped with the binary.\nWhat you pointed out is true, however, we can trigger clients to forget the local bundle update and revert to the store-shipped version. In fact, we already have support for this in the server! https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/blob/master/sdk/script/acquisition-sdk.ts#L124. We just have not pushed out this update for the RN and Cordova plugins yet to make use of it, due to some tricky issues with it possibly breaking older Cordova plugin versions, but we are working on it.\nHow this will work is, instead of doing a \"rollback\" operation, you would instead disable the update. Since the server always return the latest non-disabled update, or set shouldRunBinaryVersion to true if there are none, the client will be able to download an older update, or trigger a rollback to the store version. The functionality of disabling updates works today, if all you wanted is to prevent future clients from downloading that particular update. The only part that we are still working on is triggering client side rollbacks to the binary version in the event a client already got that first update.\nLet me know if you have any other questions or feedback!\n. LGTM!\n. @kkgelu, is it always that one image that is problematic? Does this happen consistently, or do images disappear at random?\nDo you think this issue could be related? https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/5568\n. LGTM!\n. Hi @udfalkso, it appears there is an extra comma after \"Staging,\". Is that intentional? Also, to let us help you better, could u show us the exact command u ran and the matching output? The snippets u pasted doesnt seem to match (e.g. command doesnt include the option to generate sourcemaps but the output clearly shows it is trying to do so)\n. If you changed \"-des\" to \"--des\" (two dashes), does the problem still exist?\n. @udfalkso Completely agree. We will fix that. Glad you are unblocked!\n. Some minor comments, LGTM otherwise!\n. Closing pending further investigation on whether we can control the error on the server side, may reopen if otherwise.\n. Hi @chetstone I have not tested this on iOS 7 yet, maybe someone else in the team has, but it should be supported. We will be sure to validate this tomorrow.\nWhat do you mean when you say \"shows it as pending\"? Do you mean the isPending flag of the localPackage is set to true?\nDo you have any crash logs or stack traces for the crash?\n. @chetstone ignore my last message, I got it testing on the iOS7 simulator and have a fix out https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/pull/332. Thanks for reporting!!\n. @karllindmark thanks!\n. LGTM!\n. Hi @vineyyadav, that's a great suggestion.

This has been queued up in our backlog and we'll open an issue to get feedback on the design when we get to it. Stay tuned!\n. LGTM!\n. Have you tried the collaborators feature? You might want to add an account as a collaborator to both projects, that way you can publish releases to both apps using a single account.\n. Really? Could you check that he added the exact same email that you are you using with your account? If it still doesn't work, let us know your email and we can check it for you.\n. @quentinyang Can you sign the CLA so we can merge it? :)\nhttps://cla.microsoft.com/\n. @quentinyang Thanks so much for your contribution!! \ud83c\udf7b \n. Thanks for reporting @LeBlaaanc. It is definitely strange that it is saying Internal Server Error instead of just Invalid Access Key (which is what its supposed to say). I will take a look at it. By any chance, do you know if the access key you are sending has any particularly special characters?\n. @LeBlaaanc Interesting to note. Thanks!\n. > it duplicates in both CI and CLI environments\nYup, can confirm this is a bug, will fix in the upcoming server release.\n\nI assume this is going to make all of my users redownload?\n\nIt shouldn't, because the client plugin will check against the server using the update's package hash, and if the package hash is identical with the latest release, it will not send an update.\n. Sorry, i fixed this on the backend repo and github automatically closed this. I will close when the change is actually deployed\n. This should be fixed on the live service now.\n. LGTM\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. This has been addressed in https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/pull/292\n. As a workaround, you could also use the description parameter of the update to encode custom metadata in JSON e.g. timestamps. When acquiring updates, you could use the \"advanced API\" to checkForUpdate, then JSON.parse the description metadata of the update, and decide whether or not to install it.\n. Can I clarify on your scenario? You built a production APK, but why were there CodePush updates being sent to that version? Are those updates just for sending updates to internal testers, or do they actually target real users? If it's just for internal testers, you could use the code-push patch --disabled command to disable those updates after the app goes live on the app store.\nAh, that sucks that blank screen problem prevented you from using us. Feel free to let us know any information you have / repro steps when you have them and we will look into it right away.\n. But those updates on the production deployment would be targeting older versions (unless you are using a range like what @lostintangent said). Your new APK would have to be a newer version and won't get those updates, since the app stores don't let you publish an APK with the same version. Unless you are using a private app distribution mechanism?\n. Done! :beers:\n. Awesome! Thanks for the fix!\n. We will be adding support for having custom labels soon!\n. @slowsay Could you open a new issue for the problem you're facing?\nAlso, did you use release-react to release the update? Is your targetBinaryVersion of the update the same as the one in production?\n. To let us help you better, could you show us the output of your console logs?\n. Running on browser wouldn't work unfortunately. Are you able to attach the chrome debugger to the device? https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging#debugging-webviews\n. Could you paste the entire output? You can mask out any deployment keys or secrets.\n. @nuruddeensalihu I see, the call you made to codePush.sync() is wrong. The first parameter it expects is a syncCallback. Therefore, if you change that line to codePush.sync(null, { updateDialog: updateDialogOptions}) it should work perfectly fine. We should fix the tutorial!\n. Is the app from the app store configured with the Production deployment key? Could you paste the command you used to release the update?\n. @slowsay from your post, I can see two active installs on the Production deployment, are those from your local testing?\nAre you sure that the app you published to the app store has the Production deployment key specified in Info.plist?\nCan you show us how you are calling sync()?\n. @slowsay When you locally tested your app, did you test it with the \"Release\" configuration? I would try to mimic the exact configuration of the build sent to the app store in order to troubleshoot this. Right now there's too little information.\n. If it works with the IPA file built with the release configuration, and it is the exact same one that you published to the app store, there's really no reason why it doesn't work when downloaded from the app store. I would check whether the one you published to the app store has indeed been configured properly.\n. We actually had someone request for this feature and submit a PR on the React native SDK. You may want to use it for reference:\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/pull/379\nThe only hard part is that in Cordova, the report status JS function is called from native. We may need to register a global listener for this feature, which may not be the most ideal.\n. Dupe of https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/issues/156. Sorry for the slow response, I have replied on the other thread.\n. Added!\n. While @silhouettes 's change is going in and before we release to NPM, could you try wrapping the value in quotes as a temporary workaround? So code-push release FooBar scripts \"8.10\"\n. Nice!\nDo you know if this comment in the README is still valid? I don't think your change would affect it, just would be nice to confirm.\n\nNOTE: If your semver expression starts with a special shell character or operator such as >, ^, or * , the command may not execute correctly if you do not wrap the value in quotes as the shell will not supply the right values to our CLI process. Therefore, it is best to wrap your targetBinaryVersion parameter in double quotes when calling the release command, e.g. code-push release MyApp updateContents \">1.2.3\".\n. Added!\n. Thanks for the contribution! I'll wait for @silhouettes to have a look as well.\n. @mtunique Looks awesome! Thanks so much!\n\nI'll test it and publish an update of the CLI to NPM.\n. Added!\n. Does this happen all the time? Could you show us how you called sync()?\nWe have never seen this error before, it seems that its either a file IO error or the diff update that our server returned doesn't contain a manifest file, but I'm stumped as to how that is possible :/\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/blob/73a2c36f000ddaf5bb80a2530641905c14b1b537/www/localPackage.ts#L280\n. Try changing it to this instead:\ncodePush.sync() && document.addEventListener(\"resume\", function () {\n        codePush.sync();\n      });\nI suspect the event listener is only added after the app starts, so codePush.sync() is not called until the app next resumes from the background. During the time window from the app start to the app first resume, if the app is killed, codePush.notifyApplicationReady() will not be called as part of sync(), so the update doesn't get \"rubber stamped\" as \"successful\", and rolls back.\n. Change:\ncode-push release haixiong ./bundles/main.jsbundle 1.0.0\nTo:\ncode-push release haixiong ./bundles 1.0.0\nYou need to release the whole folder including the assets to CodePush, not just the bundle.\n. LGTM!\n. Do you think it would be worth adding another hook to delete the generated signature file after the update is released? It's probably minor but I think we don't want to contaminate developers' release contents folders.\n. This is awesome, LGTM!\n. Sorry you went through that, if you upgrade the CLI to the latest version you should see a better error message, and we're working on a fix on the server side to give a better error message to users on the older CLIs too.\n. I have fixed this on the server end with a better error message, so I will close this.\n. This is necessary for adding directories. Without this, the server side will not generate manifest entries for all the directories. Empty directories will also not appear at all in the uploaded package.\n. Hmm it changes all '\\' to '/' in the relative path right? if files need this, why wouldn't directories need this?\n. Ok. Should I just add the borders for everywhere else we are printing tables as well?\n. Done. I've changed the code according to all of your feedback except changing the \"Deployment Key\" header, for which I agree with @shishirx34 comment. Let me know if you are ok and I will merge.\n. done!\n. done!\n. hmm already merged but.. the react native repo link should be https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push\n. *that you need\n. nope it wasn't. thanks for spotting that\n. My mistake. I must have changed it when testing against localhost, and forgot to check that I changed it back to the right value.\n. The server was returning a string for the date number representation. This is fixed and no longer needed with the latest server change. :)\n. Keys will be migrated on the server side, but on the client side, people who used the CLI prior to the change will have their login info persisted the old way into the config file. The format we are persisting them is different, and this code handles that.\n. Also this sentence feels kinda long.. maybe break it up \"...crendentials. You can run...\"\n. Should I also remove it for --mandatory and --verbose in other commands?\n. \"the CodePush server\"?\n. But the metrics route includes metrics for binary app versions as well, not just CodePush packages. Also how would we support the \"deployment metrics\" command?\n. Do you want to just make the exception for \"0%\" to display that instead of \"0.0%\" too?\n. I like \"previous\" more than \"source\", the \"source\" is the server. I'll change it all to \"previous\" then.\n. I'm not sure about undefined, but null would indeed create the property. Sure the server ignores it if it is falsey, but if we can save the network overhead of sending few bytes from the client side I think it makes sense to do it.\n. I think this makes sense if we are going to use these properties somewhere else, but for now, I can't forsee this ever being used outside of reporting deployment status updates to a new version. As such, I think I prefer to keep it flat.\n. https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/pull/771 was merged and published to NPM, should we depend on the latest NPM version instead?\n. I'm just wondering whether we should from now on use template strings for everything, or only when it is required.\n. Why not ${this._serverUrl}/authenticated?\n. : string?\n. why not var app: App = { name: appName }; ?\nEDIT: Ohhh I see you copied it from what was before\n. Is there a reason why this double casting is needed? Why can't we just do <string>app or <App>app?\n. Same question as above about the double casting\n. This was done so that I could override the method with a stub during tests.\n. Is there a possibility where a build.gradle file will contain multiple \"versionName\" fields?\n. Controlling the packager directly seems error prone.. We'd be duplicating logic from react-native/local-cli. Could we just take a direct dependency on react-native-cli and use node to run it like how we did for the vsts task then?\n. The AndroidManifest.xml template that RN generates does not contain the app version though\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/local-cli/generator-android/templates/src/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml\n. Actually.. maybe its not necessary to stub this. I was initially worried that os.tmpdir() might not return a constant value.\n. If we parsed this in a smarter way, e.g. make sure we are looking at android.defaultConfig.versionName, would it avoid the scenario where other plugins or config objects have the versionName method?\nGranted, that wouldn't handle the case where it is a dynamic value, e.g getVersionName(). If its a rare enough case, I guess its okay to allow those users to fall back to the original way of manually specifying the appVersion to our CLI?\n. On a quick glance... using local-cli seems possible. I'll need to investigate it further, but all the global-cli seems to do in the case of the react-native bundle command is try to find the path to the local CLI and require it. It does a lot more e.g includes a lot of troubleshooting information for the user in the case the user is running react-native init, but that's not what we care about.\n. Using local-cli works like a charm!!\n. I have added a base interface IReleaseBaseCommand.\n. Added https://www.npmjs.com/package/plist\n. Yes it is.\n. From what I experimented with template strings,\njavascript\ntag`${1}abc${2}${3}`\nwill yield to the tag function \nstrings: [\"\", \"abc\", \"\", \"\"]\nvalues: [1, 2, 3]\nI think the spec ensures that the start will be an empty string, and that contiguous substitutions will also be delimited with an empty string. So the assumption is not needed, it is guaranteed by the spec.\n. We don't attach the name here, just the version:\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/request-fetch-adapter.js#L11\nPerhaps we should standardize so it is easier manage on the server.\n. Should we just urlEncode inside the .get(), .post()... etc methods? That way we don't have to attach the tag everywhere.\n. Oh I see. We can't because those methods will see the compiled template string. Ignore my comment!\n. Dont you need to return something?\n. What do you think about making this be called \"accessKeyName\" instead, then we can merge the two interfaces, and not have to differentiate between the old or the new format?\n. I know this was there before, but this would look way better with a template string, same for a few other places. But we can change everything later in a future PR if you prefer\n. Seems like we could just use promise.finally() here. Then we won't need the extra delayedError variable.\n. I think this error message is friendlier? The server, using our validation library, will just say something like \"[Error] appVersion is invalid\".\n. Would there be a value in also having a default header for the SDK, and then merge the supplied headers with ours?\nEDIT: Ignore, I saw u already did that below.\n. Should we move \"description\" to the right of \"targetBinaryVersion\" and make it optional?\n. description? with the question mark\n. I think I will rename all the code methods to clearDeploymentHistory because it also has parity with the server endpoint being a DELETE on the /history route.\nAnd then I will leave the CLI command as deployment clear. I think it is just shorter than deployment clear-history, and with the CLI helper instructions being printed out, I don't think anyone will be confused.\nIs this an okay compromise?\n@dtivel @lostintangent \n. nits:\n... this is a Cordova project...  (capitalize C)\n... and that platform \\\"\" + platform + \"\\\" ... (platform in quotes)\n... added with \\\"cordova platform add \" + platform + \"\\\"\" (command in quotes)\nYou could use template strings for convenience!\n. : Promise<any>\n. nit: double quotes for strings i.e. \"$\"\n. It seems like we shouldn't even need to parse the file if the appStoreVersion is provided, although I agree it isn't a particularly expensive operation.\n. This is a promise operation right? How come the errors are handled using try/catch and not .catch()?\n. There are two different errors here from what I understand. One is, the file is missing / cant be read. Two is, the content is an invalid XML and cant be parsed. Both should be handled..\n. Thats what I meant, since we didnt do .catch() on the promise, the raw errror will be returned and printed to the user, it wouldnt be handled by this catch block. We should handle the promise rejection with a nicer error like \"failed to parse config.xml file\" or something\n. Can we add right after this line\n.catch((err: any) => {\n    throw new Error(`Unable to parse \"config.xml\" in the CWD. Ensure that the contents of \"config.xml\" is valid XML.`);\n})\n. I would use .finally() instead of calling deleteFileIfTemporary() in two places\n. error-prone\n. Info.plist\n. Nit: if<space>(proxy) ... (and all the ones below too)\n. I prefer not to have the Management SDK read environment variables directly, because it is designed to be used as a general library, hence it is better if the proxy behaviour is explicitly determined by the application using it.\nWould this behaviour be more transparent if the proxy setting is set via the constructor? We can have the CLI read the environment variable and pass the proxy setting to it instead. Either that, or have a code-push login --proxy <proxyUrl> option, which saves the proxy setting in the login credentials. What do you guys think?\n. 200mb - we might tweak this from the server side in the future\nRelease failed - Given the cryptic nature of this server response, we are not 100% positive that the error is a result of the size limit, hence i added a generic \"release failed\" and weak language like \"may be too large\". Do u have a suggestion on how better we can word this?\n. \u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u4f60\u8fd9\u90e8\u5206\u5199\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u653e\u539f\u6587 :)\n. \u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u5df2\u8db3\u591f\u4e86\n. ...[React Native\u63d2\u4ef6](http://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push))... \u4f60\u597d\u50cf\u591a\u52a0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a \")\"\u3002\u8fd8\u6709\uff0c\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u539f\u6587\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\uff0c\u53cd\u6b63\u4f60\u4e0a\u9762\u4ee5\u52a0\u4e86\u82f1\u6587\u7248\u7684link\n.

You have to add an empty line above this line, otherwise the GitHub markdown will not render properly: https://github.com/quentinyang/code-push/blob/9691d18857374ab2380735a1e1ae78b63521be94/cli/README-cn.md#\u5e94\u7528\u5408\u4f5c\n. Add an empty line above this line. The formatting is jumbled up in the rendered doc.\n. nit: I guess we can sort these\n. If its retrieved from DefinitelyTyped (I don't think it is), we should have included that file header that is on every d.ts file there\n// Type definitions for xxx\n// Project: xxx\n// Definitions by: xxx\n// Definitions: xxx\n. I agree it's not ideal, and yes you could always submit it there if you want, otherwise I think it's fine.\n. Why does this need to return string? It seems you are resolving with undefined anyway.\n. Why string and not void? All of the internal functions in this method too.\n. This and the line above should be indented four spaces to the right?\n. Why is this line even needed: return undefined? There seem to be a ton of places in your code that require u to explicitly call resolve(undefined) or return undefined which is weird and I wonder if they can be avoided.\n. formatting is off?\n. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of typing? We might as well use any everywhere, going by the same argument (simplicity and convenience). If a return value is not expected, it should be void. Especially now that its a framework, the typings should give a clear indication to the user what the method expects as inputs and outputs.\n. wouldn't this change in the React Native tests?\n. nit: this.only = !!options.only\nif (!!options.only) is unnecessary\n. Can we have TestBuilder.describe(...) and TestBuilder.it(...) wrapper functions that wrap around the construction of these new classes so that it mimics the mocha API as much as possible? That way contributors would still know how to work with our tests without having to learn too many new things.\n. 0.0.1?\n. whitespace after a block closing\n. can we add a whitespace after the end of each {...} block?\n. I feel like this file could be broken down into smaller parts. The server related code can go in one file, the test runner in one file, and the test builder (Describe, It APIs) can go into another file.\n. I feel like maybe the createXXResponse methods can go to the server util file.\n. Does this file need to be checked in? It's generated right?\n. It might be 0\n. It works as far as I can tell. fromNow and toNow are only different based on the sign inversion.\n. Not really.. the field is being edited if its not null or undefined, isn't that the simplest way to think about it?\n. Try it out: https://tonicdev.com/npm/moment\n```\nvar moment = require(\"moment\");\nconsole.log(moment(new Date().getTime() + 120000).fromNow()); // in 2 minutes\nconsole.log(moment(new Date().getTime() - 120000).fromNow()); // 2 minutes ago\n``\n. Initially, this field was calledexpiresIn. I changed it tomaxAgewith a suggestion on my other PR in the server repo. Do you thinkexpiresIn` is better?\nIf we do change it, I prefer to not just change it on the CLI but change the actual field that the server expects too, so its less confusing.\n. I'm fine with making them two seperate commands. It seems a little strange though that you can make an access key expire earlier using the \"Renew\" command?\n. Thinking about this more.. I think the user deserves to know that there is a default, and what it is. If it changes, we should update the docs (and the client code). I think I will remove the part that mentions the fact that the default is server-side and subject to change.\n. It is sorted by createdTime.. you think it should be the machine name instead?\n. I'm not sure. Part of me still feels like whoever consumes the SDK should be made aware that sessions and access keys are really the same thing differentiated only with the isSession fieldd. And in some ways, even CLI end users would still be aware of this (when the user logs in, the CLI says \"enter your access key\"). Also, the removeAccessKey, editAccessKey SDK functions are all currently designed to work for session keys as well. The fact that we have a special method removeSessions is really just a helper method to delete access keys which have isSession set to true and a createdBy set to the specified value. Unless we say we want to create separate SDK functions for all of those, but I'm not sure what the value is there.\n. The most tangible value is that if getAccessKeys returns everything, it becomes obvious to the developer that removeAccessKey, editAccessKey should work with whatever was returned from getAccessKeys. I guess in my mind, developers building a UI on top of the management SDK are not the same user target group as CLI end-users.\nUnless we are saying that removeAccessKey and editAccessKey shouldn't work with session keys (and the fact that they in fact actually do today is not something developers should know and is not an officially supported feature), then I will be happy to make this change.\n. Ok as I typed the last line, I convinced myself :p. Will make the change u suggested.\n. Since we're now going with this thought that access keys and session keys should just appear completely different to developers, I'll go ahead and just create separate TypeScript interfaces for each of them.\n. I addressed this in the other PR. Sorry for the confusion!\n. @lostintangent Are you still cool with rename and renew?\n. Instead of returning a new instance of the \"TestBuilderDescribe\" or \"TestBuilderIt\" to the user, do you think you can push the new instance to a global array so that the user doesn't have to deal with keeping it in an array himself?\nThis is just so we can mimic the Mocha API as much as possible\n. I think this is to filter the log messages from the device, its fine being kept in here.\n. Protip: The tilde ~ operator could be used here!\n. nit: This name clashes with the import/require you had above, which has file level scope. Could we rename one of them to something else?\n. I would prefer if you simply passed the command object or declared a new interface for options instead of declaring it as any\n. in the \"${resolvedPlistFile}\" file\n. (version: string): boolean\n. Months have to be spelt in full (e.g. '6months'), and we already linked to how to craft this string in the docs, I don't think we should show every single example here.\nHmm TTL is a super commonly used abbreviation, I don't really think it needs spelling out in full given we already stated what it does. Plus we are really calling it TTL just as a loose abstraction because it kinda resembles the TTL in network packets, so really, knowing what it stands for doesn't really matter.\n. Unable to find a gradle file at \"${buildGradlePath}\"\nYou also had an extra \"\n. It would be a plus point if we could also address this feature that @lostintangent suggested in https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/issues/266:\n\nNOTE: Since build.gradle is a required file name, it may be nice to allow this new parameter to omit it, so that you could either specify the full path to the file, or simply the directory that contains it.\n. Well, in the case of the plistFile, it is actually a prefix (e.g. STAGING-Info.plist), but for the gradle file, since the name \"build.gradle\" is required, there's really no value to the user in typing it vs not typing it, so I would prefer if the same option could be smart enough to support both methods of specifying the path (the actual file path or just the containing folder).\n. nit: I would prefer the alias to be \"-s\" or \"-sign\" (the latter same as OpenSSL), since we already use \"-k\" for listing deployment keys, so that might prevent some confusion\n. Any reason why you decided to go with export default instead of export =?\n. Going forward, we should make this algorithm configurable/inferred based on the key?\n. \n",

Those typos were my bad :( thanks for the fix!\n. No worries :) I just quickly fixed it against master\n. Yeah, we've just open sourced the management CLI and the client plugins for Cordova and React Native thus far. \n. It's definitely on our list of things we'd like to do. Part of our desire to release the service early was to get feedback from folks, particularly around scenarios that we know could be valuable (e.g. on-prem hosting of the service), but we just wanted to get validation that it is in fact valuable and/or a priority.\n. LGTM!\n. Thanks for catching this issue! We fixed it in a few other places, but obviously missed a spot :)\n. LGTM! \n. LGTM!\n. Doh! I was pretty sure I used the never expire option when I created the link, but it is definitely broken. Thanks for raising this issue!\n. So you want the CLI to be able to connect to our service via your proxy? Are you configuring a proxy system-wide, or would you want to specify the IP/port to the CLI? \n. @TanTan-TT I'm going to close this bug for now since it isn't currently actionable for us. If you are still running into issues, and can let us know what would help unblock you, we can make the necessary changes. Thanks!\n. Yep, that is correct. You definitely shouldn't have seen that update notification. When the update check is made to the service, it explicitly ignores any releases which are specified for versions that are newer or older that what you are already running.\nCould you give a sample of the code you added to your app as well as the exact release command you used from the CLI? \n. I don't think we should make the description field mandatory when releasing, but maybe we could make it the rightmost column in the release history table so that its absence doesn't look so confusing/odd. I like the following column order (left to right): Label, Upload Time, App Store Version, Mandatory, Description. I think that might actually make the data more readable.\nFor deployments with no releases, I agree that we should have a custom string and not bother outputting an empty table. The JSON output should be an empty array.\nRegarding the syntax, I can't help but wonder whether \"history\" wouldn't be a better sub command than \"view\". \"code-push deployment history  \" feels like it reads really well.\n. Actually, if we renamed the command to \"history\", I think you could completely remove the intro sentence from output and display the empty table when there aren't any releases. All of the existing list tasks will display an empty table, so it would be consistent, and if the command was already specific to release history, I don't think the intro sentence is neccessary to explain the output.\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. Can we alpha sort the deployment names in the app list? Also, will the new deployment column wrap at some point?\n. LGTM!\n. Good catch @rmevans9! Thanks for this contribution. I'll merge this now and will update the docs on the website with this fix as well.\n. We do plan to eventually open source the back-end, but it's not an immediate priority for us right now unfortunately. We're a small team, and we're laser focused on the cloud-hosted scenario right now, since that is what the vast majority of our users are looking for. As @silhouettes said, once we exit the beta stage, the service will definitely have a presence in China to help alieve these issues. Thanks for the feedback and I apologize for the inconvenience.\nThat said, I would like to see us improve our reliability such that using the service from China should be possible, but just a little slower (due to the reliance on US-based data centers). Any timeouts or unreliability in the usage of the service, is absolutely something we would like to address.\n. @bsw85 Release date for which? Open sourcing the back-end or extending the cloud service into Chinese data centers? I don't have any specific dates in place for either one right now unfortunately, but we should be able to give an update on dates in the next month or so. Stay tuned and thanks for the patience!\n. I'm going to close this issue for now, since we know we need to optimize the service for non-US based users in general once we exit the beta stage. China will be a big priority for us, and we'll announce those improvements very soon. Thanks!\n. @ryanlin1986 Thanks for the endorsement :)\n. LGTM!\n. We're actually working on this right now :) We should have it out later this week. Thanks for the feedback!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. Ah good catch. We'll update that today.

This has been fixed in master and we'll release an update including this to NPM early next week.\n. LGTM! It looks like this typo was fixed in the Cordova plugin's readme, but it never made its way to the website oddly enough. Thanks for taking care of this @JacobCWard!\n. I deleted my two other comments since they're not necessary, but it would be cool if we made the AccountManager the default export. Other than that, this LGTM! Awesome job dude. This is so much cleaner than before :D\n. LGTM! Thanks for taking care of this!\n. Hey @mhagmajer! There are two parts needed to make this feature work:\n1. Adding support to the React Native Android platform to allow assets to be loaded from disk, as opposed to from the APK. We were able to support loading assets on iOS first because this support had already been added to iOS. We submitted a PR for the Android support, that was merged into master but unfortunately missed the 0.18 release. Hopefully, it will be included in 0.19.0-RC.\n2. Adding support for updating Android assets to the CodePush plugin that is built on top of #1. We actually already have this working, so we're simply waiting for the bits in the platform to be released so that we can officially release an update to our plugin. \nSo the feature is essentially done, but we're simply waiting for React Native to release the needed platform support. Assuming this support goes into 0.19.0-RC, and React Native releases happen roughly every two weeks, we should be able to have this out within the next three weeks-ish?\n. I'm going to close this since it's a feature item that we're tracking on the React Native side, and this is the repo for the management CLI. As I mentioned, we'll be landing this feature on top of RN 0.19.0 as soon as it is released, so stay tuned! Thanks!\n. When you call the release command, you need to specify the version of the binary that it is targeting. Therefore, you should be passing 1.0.0 if that is what is set in the config.xml file of the app you are testing in the emulator. \nThe plugin is saying that no update is available because when it compares the version of the running app (1.0.0) and the latest release on the CodePush server (1.0.1), they aren't equivalent, and it therefore assumes that the update on the CodePush server isn't compatible with the running app.\nCould you try releasing another update specifying the right version and let us know how that works out?\nAdditionally, could you check out the docs for the App Store version parameter for the release command, and let us know if we can make this any clearer: http://microsoft.github.io/code-push/docs/cli.html#app-store-version-parameter\nThanks!\n. Awesome! That's great to hear that you're unblocked :)\nAs I mentioned, if you have any feedback on how we could reduce the confusion around the app version parameter, we would love to improve our docs.\nI'll close this bug for now, but let us know if you run into any other issues. Thanks!\n. LGTM! What do you think about sending the device ID along with the download report so that we have the option to use it in the future without needing to rev the client SDKs? I can't think of a reason to need it now, so I wouldn't block on it, but I'd love to have options for future improvements on the server in the future.\n. Discussing Richard's comments above:\n1. I agree. I'm in favor of adding a \"App store version\" column to the metrics table, just like we have in the history table. It's really the binary version + label that uniquely identifies the code-base, so I think it's relevant here. Additionally, this would allow us to have the \"Label\" column be blank as a potential indicator that the row indicates a binary version and not a CodePush update.\n2. Fully agreed. @geof90 and I talked about this already. Percentages are king here.\n3. Hmm, not sure I'm in love with putting the active number by the lable.\n4. Agreed\n5. I'd actually be in favor of not showing the failure key/pair at all unless it's non-zero. And when we show it, we should color it red.\n6. I'm cool with \"Users\".\nThe following is how I've roughly envisioned displaying this data:\nActive: 34.34% (12,344)\nInstalls: 3,345 (56 pending)\nFailures: 23\nThere are primarily three questions that I'd like devs to be able to answer very easily/quickly:\n1. \"I accidentally released an update that I didn't mean to. Has anyone actually downloaded it yet? If not, I can confidently do a rollback and know my mistake was mitigated.\" Showing 0 installs and 0 downloads can help answer this.\n2. \"Have any of my end-users attempted to install the update and it failed?\" The failed count is obviously the key point here. We should make this extremely visible when it's non-zero.\n3. \"How many of my users have upgraded to the latest?\" The active percentage and count helps with this.\n. Should the active percentages display up to two decimal places? Additionally, I would expect it to only show significant digits, so it would show 0%, not 0.0%, or 0.00%. Oddly, your screenshot does this for the 88% number, but not the 0.0% number.\n. If you can make sure to format the metrics numbers to include commas, then this LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. Hmm, yeah good point. Well, I'll implement this part to remove the dependency in the CLI and we can leave this bug open to track removing it from the SDK as well (I don't want to make that change right now).\n. Hey @jlebensold! This sounds like our rollback protection feature thinking that the update failed and rolling you back. Which sample are you trying? React Native or Cordova?\n. OK let me look into the sample to see if it's doing something wrong. The behavior you are seeing is not by design unless he update includes a crash while starting up. We do that rollback on the client side to make sure end users aren't ever blocked if a broken update is accidentally released to CodePush. But a non-broken release should obviously not be rolled back :)\nSorry for the confusion, and I'll let you know the issue as soon as I get in the office this morning and check it out (I'm on Pacific time).\n. @jlebensold So long story short, the sample app is setup to do the behavior you are seeing. If you create an app using CodePush, you won't see this behavior if your app calls sync on startup. If your app doesn't call sync on startup (e.g. in a  button click, timer), then you simply need to call notifyApplicationReady in startup, to notify the CodePush runtime that you consider the update successful.\nWe'll update the sample to call notifyApplicationReady appropriately, so that this isn't confusing.\n. Yay! Thanks for confirming that this worked :) I'm going to close this bug and we'll track the sample fix on the React Native repo.\n. LGTM!\n. Resolved via #125.\n. If the version in your Info.plist file is 1.0.0, then you need to pass that exact version to the call to the release command, otherwise, the server won't think the CodePush release is applicable to the client. If you call \"code-push release [APP] codepush.js 1.0.0\", the app should see the update (assuming that 1.0.0 is in fact our app version). Let me know how that goes!\nWe should definitely add logging to make diagnosing this scenario clearer. Additionally, if you could let us know how to make the docs here more clearer, that would be greatly appreciated. We're going to be adding a React Native-specific release command to the CLI very soon, that will prevent the need to specify the version or update contents explicitly, and will prevent this confusion from occurring.\n. Yay! That is actually really great feedback!! I'll update the docs to not reference the 1.0.3 version since j totally agree that is confusing :) Thanks so much for the feedback and for trying out the service. Let us know if you hit any other issues.\n. Hey @AndreyNikiforov! Currently, the CodePush plugin doesn't know which version of the app is bundled with the binary, and therefore, when it syncs with the server, the server assumes that any release which is targeting the client's binary version, is applicable to it. To work around this, our guidance to folks has been to simply not release an update to CodePush that is already bundled with an app store update. So if you release a 1.0.0 binary to the store, and then you release v1, v2, and v3 to CodePush (which are updates to the bits included in 1.0.0), when you release 1.1.0, you don't need to upload a v4 to CodePush, since you're just relying on users getting those bits from the app store. That would prevent users of 1.1.0 from immediately getting an update after installation.\nThis behavior has been OK so far for our existing users, but I agree that it's less than ideal, especially when you're automating releases from CI and don't want to have to know when you should and shouldn't release an update to CodePush.\nI would be very interested to get more feedback from you about what you think the most elegant/natural solution would be. Do you always want to release every JS change to CodePush and have the server/plugin be smart about knowing when it isn't necessary?\n. @AndreyNikiforov Could you remind me whether you were building a Cordova or React Native app? I just ask because we have a PR our right now that solves this issue in the RN plugin by computing the hash of the binary contents before asking the CodePush server if an update is available. This allows us to prevent unnecessary first updates. I'm hoping this will benefit you :)\n. Awesome! Thanks so much for confirming that. We'll get this hashing feature merged in today and then we'll likely release it early next week. Thanks for the patience with this issue!\n. This feature has been checked into master for the RN plugin and will be released to NPM this afternoon. Thanks so much for the patience and feedback!\n. Aside from my two cosmetic comments above, this looks really good! \n. We only zip up the contents of an update when the developer passes a directory to the \"code-push release\" command. For React Native, you would do this if you're updating image assets in addition to your JS bundle. Otherwise, if the developer simply passes a single file (e.g. a JS bundle file), it isn't zipped up since the use of gzip will provide sufficient compression for the download, and an archive isn't needed.\nAre you experiencing an issue or were you just curious? :)\n. Hmm, you may be right. We might not be gzipping the response when simply releasing a JS bundle file. When you release a directory (JS bundle + images), we definitely zip that and round trip it to the client, but in the JS bundle scenario, that seems to not be using gzip currently.\nAre you experiencing performance issues? \n. Nice to you meet you as well! Thanks so much for trying out CodePush :) \nIf you're not experiencing any performance issues, would it make sense for us to close this issue? Or would you like us to discuss modifying the existing behavior for JS bundle only updates?\n. Hey @91jason, I'm going to close this issue for now since you mentioned you weren't experiencing any performance issues. If you do in fact have a problem, please feel free to re-open this and we can investigate further. Thanks!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM! This is an amazing clean up job :)\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. Hey @almouro, send an email to codepushfeed@microsoft.com with your app name and deployment name and we'll fix you up. We have a bug that we just discovered when the release history gets too long. We're addressing the root of the problem, but we can unblock you in the meantime.\nI'm reopening this issue since it hasn't actually been fixed.\n. @almouro Thanks for being patient while we address that bug!\n. What are you seeing the Mandatory column set to when you view your app history via code-push deployment h MyApp Staging? I just tried reproing this, and in all possible permutations (-m,--mandatory, -m false, --mandatory false, -m true, --mandatory true) it displayed the correct value in the history. I will test the actual checkForUpdate side of things as well, but I just wanted to try to narrow down where the issue might be.\n. Ah OK, yeah I know what the problem is now :) The server treats the mandatory property specially in order to maintain its semantics in the event that an end-user never got an update that was considered mandatory. If you check out the docs for this parameter, you can see a detailed description of how it works. Any feedback here would be appreciated. We made it this way based on a lot of previous feedback, but I would love to keep making sure we improve it.\nWe tried to make this behavior intuitive during debugging, so that you don't inadvertently see updates converted to mandatory that you didn't expect, but we obviously failed you here :) To help diagnose how we could maybe have made this better, could you provide a few details about your current workflow?\n1. Are you testing on iOS or Android?\n2. Are you running debug or release builds?\n3. If release builds, are you bumping the version of the app in your binary when re-deploying?\nThanks!\n. Thanks for confirming this @kevinejohn. Keep the feedback coming!\n. Do you think we should go ahead and add a new flag to the release-react command that allows specifying the bundle name? That way, this fix ensures the E2E works for the default file names, but if someone changes the name, they can configure it in their Obj-C/Java code, and customize it when releasing.\n. Yep, and maybe allow \"-b\" as an alias?\n. Could you also update the CLI readme?\n. LGTM!\n. @dejakob Hmm, interesting. Can you confirm that the android directory exists in your CWD when you ran the code-push release command? Also, could you provide a little detail for the following questions?\n1. Is this a Cordova or React Native app? I just want to make sure I understand what you're releasing.\n2. How did you generate the contents of the android directory? I just want to make sure the update contents are as expected by the server.\nThanks!\n. OK cool, thanks for the details. You don't want to upload the actual Android project to CodePush, since our React Native plugin wouldn't know what to do with it. The server expects you to release one of two things:\n1. A single JS-bundle file which represents your packager-generated app. You can find more details about this scenario here.\n2. A directory which includes the JS bundle file as well as the assets generated by the packager. You can find more details about this scenario here\nAssuming that your app is using assets, you want to run the following commands before releasing to CodePush:\nmkdir CodePush\nreact-native bundle --platform android --entry-file index.android.js --bundle-output ./CodePush/main.jsbundle --assets-dest ./CodePush --dev false\nYou don't have to call the directory CodePush, but it is a convention we use. Additionally, notice how the new CodePush folder would now contain the JS bundle and the assets, to match the contents expected by the server. You could now run the following command to release to CodePush:\ncode-push release fakemobileapp ./CodePush 1.0.1\nAdditionally, if you want an easier experience for releasing updates, you can use the release-react command, which composes together the react-native bundle and code-push release command together for you. So you could simply run the following command to release a new update:\ncode-push release-react fakemobileapp android\nLet me know if trying out that bundle/release command works out for you. Thanks!\n. Awesome! Thanks for confirming. Let us know if you run into any other issues. Thanks so much for using CodePush :)\n. @jrebagliatti That is bizarre! We haven't seen this issue before. If you take a look at the Safari developer console, what do you see the logs saying when you call sync? That might help provide some indication of the problem.\nAdditionally, just so I have some more detail:\n1. Did the hang only happen after adding the call to sync? Specifically, did simply adding the CodePush plugin to your app not result in a hang? I wouldn't expect it to, but I just want to narrow the issue down to you actually calling into our SDK.\n2. How are you deploying the app? Are you using cordova emulate ios, cordova run ios, ionic run ios --livereload, etc? It would be helpful to know this so we can get a repro.\n3. Is onDeviceReady being called only once? If you added a breakpoint or a log message inside of it, would it be hit/logged multiple times? It's possible we have an issue with sync being run multiple times in parallel, so I just want to check if this is happening for you.\n4. If you simply call codePush.checkForUpdate does the hang go away? I want to try to narrow down the issue to sync if possible, as opposed to any network activity generated by our SDK.\nThanks! Sorry for the inconvenience. We'll try to narrow down this problem ASAP :)\n. Did you try running \"location.reload()\" in the console to force a re-initialization to see the logs? That is how I always work around this debugging limitation :)\nAlso, could you answer question #2 above? That will be really useful in us trying to capture a repro.\nIt's super weird that you're hitting this issue just by calling any API method!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. You don't need to to worry about the ability of the CodePush service to handle the load of your users. We monitor the service's capacity/health very closely and adjust resources as needed. If you have a particularly high user audience (10s of millions+), and want to chat more about this, I would love to understand your concerns better.\nThat said, as you mentioned, our servers currently only run in the US, and so I can totally appreciate the network latency between Asia not being ideal. We plan to geo-distribute the service in the coming months as part of exiting the beta phase, but we don't have any firm dates yet for when that will happen unfortunately.\n. @xhacker5000 Is the main thing that concerns you the performance of the update download for your end-users? What about the update check itself? Does that seem too slow as well? If we were to geo-replicate the update contents to other regions (e.g. China), would that be satisfactory to improve the experience? \nAdditionally, how do you find the performance of managing your account from the CLI? I'd be curious to know how critical you thought improvements to that part of the workflow is.\nThanks!\n. I'm going to close this issue for now since it isn't an actionable bug, but next sprint we're going to be investigating how to improve the perf outside of the US, so we'll keep you posted. Please re-open this issue if you want to continue discussing this. Thanks!\n. LGTM! Do you want to update the readme as well? BTW, for my ReactConf demo, I had change the dev option to be true in my local CLI install precisely for the reason you wanted to make this change :)\n. LGTM!\n. I don't think the concept of a machine name makes sense with an explicitly created access key. The description is meant to encode the purpose of the key. The machine name IMO is only valuable for login-generated keys, since they indicate where the session was started, and help indicate if you want to remove it remotely. The current way that we visualize access keys in the CLI is non-ideal, and I would prefer that we add a Type column that is either Login or Custom (or whatever), and the Description column would display the machine name for login keys and the description for custom keys.\n. Hmm, we haven't heard of this issue before. Could you elaborate a little on what you mean by everything breaks? Are you getting exception messages in the console that indicate any issues, or is it just that the app is loading the binary version now instead of the latest a CodePush update?\n. Could you check whether or not the issue occurs after simply adding the push plugin to your app, or if you need to add the init/config code that you mentioned in your gist? I'll investigate this ASAP to figure out what might be the issue. Thanks for reporting it.\n. @rajeevkannav Thanks for letting us know!\n. LGTM!\n. @okonon There isn't a way to do this right now, but the CLI should be deleting the zips it creates after a release is finished uploading, which would resolve the problem you're seeing.\nCould you do me a favor and check whether it does this after a successful upload? I believe we have a bug where the zip doesn't get cleared if an error occurs during the upload, which we can definitely get fixed ASAP. I'm just curious though if you're seeing the zip remain after every release, successful or not.\nThanks for reporting this!\n. Hey @arthurpark! The CodePush plugin ships with a copy of the SSZipArchive codebase, so if you're integrating it into a project that already includes it, you would get this error. Could you try something for me? If you update our CodePush.podspec, by turning this:\ns.source_files = 'ios/CodePush/*.{h,m}', 'ios/CodePush/SSZipArchive/*.{h,m}', 'ios/CodePush/SSZipArchive/aes/*.{h,c}', 'ios/CodePush/SSZipArchive/minizip/*.{h,c}'\ninto this:\ns.source_files = 'ios/CodePush/*.{h,m}'\nand then re-running pod install, does that resolve the issue? I'll try this repro in a second, but this may be a quick work-around for you. I'm not sure what the right convention is here, but it's possible that we could ship with two pod specs, one with and without SSZipArchive, to better accomodate this scenario.\n. Hey @kevinejohn! It's exciting to see what you've been working on after talking to you a few times on GitHub :) Hover looks awesome! We'll add it to the showcase tomorrow. Thanks so much for reaching out.\n. This is now live! Thanks so much for using CodePush :D\n. LGTM!\n. @mablack This is a new issue for us, so thanks for reporting it! The trail of logs and the error message you posted would almost seem to indicate that the config.xml file that gets bundled into your app doesn't include a <content src> attribute. Is that at all possible? We've seen other cases where 3rd party plugins unknowingly modify the config.xml file, which can cause interop issues for us.\nWe can try to repro this in the morning with the exact set of plugins you have installed to see if one of them is doing something here that is screwing up the assumptions that the CodePush plugin makes. Most of these plugins are ones we've verified co-exist just fine with CodePush, so we should hopefully be able to test out the remaining few.\n. Anytime! Let us know if you run into any other problems :)\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. @xhacker5000 We've resolved this issue on the server, so you shouldn't run into it anymore. Please re-open this if it occurs again. Thanks for the patience while we worked it out!\n. LGTM!\n. @kwcto Taxfyle looks awesome! Thanks for using CodePush and letting us know :) We'll add this to the showcase this afternoon.\n. @JedWatson Yeah you're right, I apologize about the confusion! The release-react command does in fact include assets, so your desired behavior is the actual behavior :) I'll update the docs in a bit to make this clearer for others. Thanks so much for the feedback!\n. You were on the right track :) As you probably saw, release-react just always sets the \"--assets-dest\" flag when calling \"react-native bundle\", since if an app doesn't use any assets, the packager won't generate the assets directory in the temp release folder that the CodePush CLI created anyways. For apps that use assets, we behave the way they would if they called the \"vanilla\" release command, and if an app doesn't use assets, we would release a ZIP with the JS bundle as opposed to simply releasing the JS bundle.\nWe could potentially improve release-react to just release the JS bundle to the server when an app doesn't use assets, but I don't believe it would have any impact on behavior, so it would be more of a \"cleanliness\" thing.\n. BTW, I'm a TouchstoneJS fan, so it's awesome to have you trying out CodePush :) Please don't hesitate to let us know any feedback or issues you run into other than this one. I'll fix this in the next hour once I get home.\n. I sent out #179 that clarifies that both the JS bundle and assets are generated as part of the react-native bundle call, and also tries to add a little more detail in general (along with an illustrative comparison between release-react and release). Let me know if you think we could improve it any more. Thanks again!\n. Just merged this PR. Let us know if we can make this even clearer. Thanks again!\n. That's awesome! Thanks a lot for letting me know :) Let us know how it goes and if you have any additional issues/questions/feedback/etc.\n. @rajeevkannav Any updates on this issue? I'd love to make sure you're unblocked :)\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. I don't know much about Electron, but I suspect we would need to create an implementation of our client SDK for it. It something that we've talked about before and would be very interested to help with if the community was interested enough. \n. Is this still something that folks would be interested in seeing?\n. Awesome! It isn't currently on our roadmap, but I'm really excited to get this going, and help as much as possible :) If you're planning to kick-start this, do you think it makes sense for us to close this issue, since it isn't immediately actionable on our side? I would definitely want to treat the Electron SDK as a first-class citizen, and make sure it gets the right visibility, so we could make sure to link to the repo/docs once available.\n. @mhagmajer Sounds good. Thanks!\n. The existence of the auto-updater API is what has prevented us from prioritizing adding Electron support to CodePush. I think our feature set is still really compelling, but I want to make sure it's valuable enough before moving forward. For now, I think we're assuming that folks can get by with the Electron auto-updater and an open source server solution, but I'm interested to hear more if CodePush support for Electron would make sense.\n. I can repro the issue when adding a \"+\" to an app name. Parens seem to work fine, so I suspect the plus sign is the culprit here. Interestingly enough, after adding an app with a plus sign in the name, the \"app ls\" command always returns \"[Error] Not Found\", but all other commands work fine as long as you're not targeting the app name with the plus sign in it.\n. We can definitely rename the app for you to unblock you in the meantime while we investigate a longer term fix. Would you be cool with us simply replacing the plus sign with something? I just confirmed that the plus sign doesn't impact the creation or management of the app at all, but anything that tries to query it fails, so it we just replace the plus sign wjth something, everything works perfectly.\nIf you want to let us know your app name and what we can rename it to, we can take care of this ASAP. You can either mention it here or email me at joncart@microsoft.com.\n. Absolutely! Apologies for the inconvenience here. We had actually looked through existing app name patterns to make sure we tested the entire CLI as part of the new release, but we seemingly missed the plus sign.\n. @dtivel Clearly something doesn't like the plus sign :) Should the CLI or server be rejecting this character or are we not properly encoding it somewhere?\n. LGTM!\n. @aofeng2009 Are you naming your generated JS bundle \"main.jsbundle\"? Unless you customized the name you want CodePush to look for in Objective C (by using [CodePush bundleURLForResource]), then it will expect to find a file with that exact name in the update, and fail otherwise.\nIf you change your \"--bundle-output\" value to \"./bundles/main.jsbundle\", it should work for you. However, I would recommend using the release-react command in our CLI, as it simplifies a lot of this process and will name your JS bundle correctly (among other things).\n. @aofeng2009 Could you clarify the issue you had in your second example? Did the update not work until you renamed your image path?\n. @aofeng2009 Hmm that is strange. It's possible that the React Native packager could be caching the JS file and not updating it when you generate the new bundle. Could you try running \"code-push release-react appName ios\" instead to see if that works? That will handle generating the bundle and releasing it to CodePush, but will also ensure the packager cache is cleared before doing so.\n. The fact that the \"Install Metrics\" column shows 1 pending install means that the client installed the update, but it hasn't been run yet. Have you killed and restarted the app and it still says pending? Also, can you confirm that your AppDelegate.m file is configured to use CodePush to load the JS bundle file? If not, then when you're app starts, the update would never be run.\n. @aofeng2009 I'm glad to hear it worked! Let us know if you run into any other issues.\n. Good catch! We definitely need to update the home to reflect the CLI docs, since we changed the parameter name to \"targetBinaryVersion\" precisely to try to help out with this confusion. I'll update that this morning. \n. @poshaughnessy Anytime you hit an issue, it's beyond helpful to let us know, so thanks so much for reporting this :)\nThat said, I can't immediately think how this could have happened. We definitely don't apply partial updates of the JS bundle (I wish our product was that smart!), so I can't explain how you would see some changes but not another, unless some of the changes didn't actually get bundled into the JS bundle file itself (e.g. a file wasn't saved, the packager's cache erroneously skipped a file).\nAdditionally, the versions that you mentioned you were releasing as are all valid, and don't represent \"ranges\" (e.g. setting a target binary version of \"1.3.*\" would match both \"1.3.1\" and \"1.3.2\"), so you shouldn't be seeing it get downloaded unless the version matches exactly.\nWe'll do some investigations on our end to see if this could be happening somehow, but if you do get a chance to try it again locally, that would be very helpful. Thanks again and stay tuned!\n. @poshaughnessy We haven't been able to repro this issue unfortunately :( I'm going to close it for now, but if you experience this again, and could let us know more details about the repro steps/scenario, please re-open it, as we would love to address it ASAP. Thanks!\n. @kkgelu Just to confirm: the only images that disappear are markers on the map component, and they disappear every time you release a CodePush update (as opposed to only randomly)? If so, that sounds like an incompatibility between the maps component and CodePush. We maintain a list of supported components precisely because we recognize that not every component which allows you to reference image assets will automatically work with CodePush. We can test out the maps component today and see what the issue might be and possibly we can send a PR to it to fix it.\nIn the future, I would recommend testing the CodePush update experience locally using a non-production deployment key. That way, you can verify that it supports all of your requirements instead of needing to be surprised in production. We're working hard to address all of these interop issues, but we haven't been able to resolve them all yet.\n. I'm not sure if we want to always run cordova build, since it would presumably be quite a bit slower than the prepare since it has to actually compile the native binary. It's definitely much simpler this way than to add a new flag to switch from using prepare to build (e.g. code-push release-cordova MyApp ios --build), but I'm still on the fence about which solution to this I prefer.\n. LGTM!\n. @madcat Could you explain a little bit about what you're trying to achieve? When you say that you're trying to load a second bundle, do youj mean that you have a single iOS app that has multiple separate React Native views, and you want to update them with CodePush?\n. @madcat Unfortunately our plugin doesn't currently support hosting multiple separate React Native apps within the same process, which is why you're experiencing this issue.\n. LGTM!\n. @dudeinthemirror This is great feedback! We can definitely discuss adding this to support this scenario. In the meantime, the workaround is to specify the \"--targetBinaryVersion\" flag with the version from the respective plist file (e.g. \"1.2.3\"). The only reason that the release-react command tries to load the info.plist file is to infer the app version, so if you specify it explicitly, it won't even attempt to read the file and you won't get this error.\nAs a total aside, the release-react command already assumes that your iOS entry file is named \"index.ios.js\", and defaults to releasing to the staging deployment, so you can choose to omit those flags if you'd like.\n. That workaround would do as well :) I definitely agree that we should add this option, I just wanted to make sure you could get unblocked in the meantime. I'll use this issue to track this enhancement, since like you mentioned, this will definitely be a common need that I'd like to address ASAP.\n. @dudeinthemirror I just merged a PR that adds a new --plistFilePrefix parameter (aliased as --pre) to the release-react command. I believe this would allow releasing from your custom project structure, without needing to resort to explicitly setting the --targetBinaryVersion parameter. Let me know what you think! I'm going to close this for now based on this solution, but I would love any feedback you may have.\nshell\ncode-push release-react MyApp ios --pre \"MyApp.STAGING-\"\nAdditionally, we also added a new --plistFile parameter for scenarios where the location (or name) of the plist file is entirely arbitrary, and CodePush can't infer it on its own.\n. @dudeinthemirror This feature has been released to NPM. You should be able to do the following once you upgrade:\nshell\ncode-push release-react MyApp ios --pre \"MyApp.STAGING\"\nNote that the trailing hyphen is optional, since we'll add it if it isn't specified.\n. @kiliwalk I really like this solution! Thank you so much for taking the time to contribute this :D\n. This doesn't need to happen as part of this PR, but it might make sense to also display the proxy server in the output of the \"whoami\" command, so that users could easily reference if they're current login session is using a proxy.\n. LGTM! None of my comments are deal breakers, so I'm cool with whatever you decide. Like I said, this is really awesome to have in the product, so I really appreciate the PR.\n. @kiliwalk If the system-wide setting was set at the time the user logged in or registered, then yeah, we should display that in the whoami, since that proxy would be persisted to their login session file and used until they logout.\n. Maybe just \"Proxy:\" as the label text? And only display that like if the proxy is non-null in the session file?\n. @kiliwalk Ah right, that makes sense. I suppose it only makes sense to display the proxy in the whoami output if it was explicitly set in the CLI when logging in.\n. @ewindso We could definitely explore adding this. Could you share a little detail about the scenario you had in mind? You want a CodePush update's assets to be accessible by your app's share extension? Are you looking to update assets within your share extension via CodePush?\n. I'm going to close this for now since it isn't immediately actionable for us. If you could provide more context on what scenario you had in mind, that would be awesome. Please feel free to re-open this to discuss it further. Also, we have a PR put on the react native plugin that is related to iOS app extensions, so it's possible that would satisfy your requirements here? If you could take a look at it, that would be great. Thanks!\n. @allanjsx The app looks great! Thanks for using CodePush and letting us know. We'll add Kiwiship to the showcase first thing tomorrow :)\n. @prateekbh Are you using the release-react command in the CLI? That should be zipping up your JS bundle, so that your users will receive the zip instead of the loose JS bundle file.\n. @prateekbh Are you able to use the release-react command, which would zip up the contents automatically for you?\n. OK cool :) I'm going to close this then since release-react is our primary recommendation now, and that should always result in content being zipped. Please re-open this if I missed anything or we should be considering further improvements. Thanks again for reporting it!\n. @kipricker Does the email address you're attempting to add as a collaborator represent an account that has already registered with CodePush? That error message is really poor, but it should only be happening if you're attempting to add a non-registered collaborator. If you have the person register an account with CodePush, you could then re-run this. Sorry for the issue!\n. @kipricker That's a completely reasonable thing to have thought :) We're going to improve this error message to better reflect what we say in our docs. Thanks so much for the feedback!\n. @rik-smit Ah yeah, this makes sense to address in one way or another. Out of curiosity, how big is your app? We haven't seen this issue before, and we've definitely had users with big apps.\n. @rik-smit I'm going to close this for now since we haven't had any other reports of this issue, and I'd prefer to only add parameters to our CLI that are broadly applicable. Please feel free to re-open it if you think we should re-consider, but in the meantime, since you were able to unblock yourself, it seems potentially like an edge case that we can re-evaluate if it becomes a common issue. Thanks again!\n. @chetstone Just to update you: we're investigating this issue right now, and we hope to have an answer this afternoon. Thanks for the patience and sorry about this issue!\n. Awesome! Thanks for confirming this. I'll release an update to NPM tomorrow.\n. Ah sorry, I thought you were working on the WKWebView issue. I also verified that this works on Travis, which isn't unique, other than using Linux by default.\n. Doh! My bad. I actually ran the tests after making this change, but they were failing for some seemingly unrelated reason, so I assumed they had an issue and just moved on. Apologies!\n. LGTM!\n. @Kerumen Thanks for the PR!\n. LGTM!\n. @poshaughnessy Interestingly enough, we removed the [CodePush] First update: back up package information skipped. log message in v1.7.1-beta, so it's odd that you're seeing that in your console output. \n. @poshaughnessy Awesome! Glad that fixed it for you :) Let us know if you run into any other problems.\n. @xhacker5000 Could you confirm that your friend transferred the app to the right account? Did you ever get this working? I'd like for us to investigate this ASAP otherwise, so if could update us on where things stand so here, we can try to make sure you're unblocked. Sorry for the inconvenience!\n. We aren't able to repro this issue, so I'm going to close it for now. Please re-open this if you're continuing to experience problems with the code-push transfer command, and we'll investigate it ASAP. Thanks!\n. The CLI and client SDKs rely on TLS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks / tampering when releasing and syncing updates with the server, but we don't currently verify that updates are signed before installing them on the end user's device. That said, we're literally about to implement this exact feature to better ensure end-to-end security.\nAs long as your CodePush credentials aren't compromised, no one else can release updates to your apps, but the signature verification will help further mitigate issues in the event that the CodePush service itself was breached. This enhancement is one of our key items to complete leading up to the service exiting beta.\n. I'm going to close this issue for now, and we'll update the FAQ and introduce comprehensive security docs after we land the update signing capability in the next few weeks. If you want to keep this open for tracking purposes, please feel free to re-open it, otherwise, I'll ping you directly when we have an update. Thanks!\n. Under the covers, a promote is just creating a release with the contents and metadata of the source release, so it should reject duplicates in the same way that a \"regular\" release does. We'll investigate this this morning to see what may be going on.\nAre you seeing this behavior in your CI environment that may be doing multiple promotes in parallel? Or can you repro this issue locally using the CLI as well?\n. Awesome! Thanks so much for using CodePush :) We'll get this up on the showcase this afternoon.\n. @patoroco Thanks for catching this!\n. @patoroco The platform parameter of the release-react and release-cordova commands is only used to determine how to generate the update bundle (e.g. should we run react-native bundle --platform ios or react-native bundle --platform android), and therefore, is currently a local-only concept. That parameter value doesn't currently flow to the server in any way.\nOur current recommendation is to create separate CodePush apps for each platform (e.g. Ticketea-ios and Ticketea-android), at which point, you'd have separate deployments, with separate histories for both Android and iOS. At some point, we plan to actually integrate the concept of platforms into a CodePush app, that way you don't need to define separate apps in order to release updates to each platform independently. Once we did that, I agree with your suggestion that we'd want to let you view the history for each platform independently.\nJust so that we can fully understand your setup and usage scenario: are you currently using a single CodePush-registered app to release updates for both iOS and Android? If so, that could actually lead to issues if an iOS user was able to sync an Android build and/or vice versa.\nThanks for the feedback, and I look forward to working with you to make this experience better.\n. Running the rollback command on a specific app deployment would roll back all clients that were configured to query that deployment for updates. We recommend creating a seperate CodePush app for each platform (iOS and Android), and so if you went with that recommendation, then rolling back one of those app's deployments would only impact your iOS or Androis users. If you wanted to rollback everyone, then you'd need to rollback both app deployments.\nIf, however, you're deploying iOS and Android updates to the same CodePush app (we do not recommend doing this!), then performing a rollback on that single app's production deployment would roll back everyone.\n. LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. @cyparu Thanks for the recommendation! We'd definitely be interested in providing this if the interest is there. \n. Hmm, that's interesting. Cordova is clearly detecting plugins that are already installed, so it's odd that it doesn't detect the device plugin before erroneously trying to install it.\nDid you possibly add/remove the device plugin at some point, and it was only partially removed? I've seen issues like this before, where the plugins/* content is cleared when removing a plugin, but there were \"dangling assets\" left behind within a specific platform that caused issues when trying to later reinstall the plugin.\nCan you try removing and re-adding the Android platform? That should help determine if my assumption is correct and your project just got into an odd spot.\n. @pke Removing the CodePush plugin? The issue you're hitting doesn't appear to be a problem with CodePush as opposed to a Cordova/plugman bug, so I'd love to make sure we can unblock you if possible :)\n. Ah OK I must have misunderstood you, since your other bug implies you didn't remove CodePush. I'm going to close this for now since you're unblocked, but please re-open it if the problem persists. I'm pretty sure the issue is with the Cordova project being \"corrupted\" and so the best solution is to just re-add platforms to reset the generated native projects.\n. The only thing that CodePush uses your config.xml version for is to infer which binary version to target a new CodePush release at. When you run the code-push release-cordova command, it is simply running cordova prepare and then code-push release for you. The later command has its \"update contents\" and \"target binary version\" parameters auto-populated for you to simplify the release process.\nWhen you bump the version in your config.xml and then run code-push release-cordova, you are releasing an update that is only eligible for the bumped version (2.0.10), and therefore, users that are already running the non-bumped version (2.0.9) won't be able to get it, since the CodePush plugin assumes that it isn't compatible with it.\nKeep in mind that when you release Cordova, you are specifying the \"target binary version\", and therefore, the binary version that the update is targeting/eligible for. It isn't specifying the version that the update represents, and therefore, you don't need to bump anything.\nThe reason that you're v3 worked is because after you de-bumped the version, the newly released update was now targeting the correct binary version. \nAs an aside, if at anytime you release an update with an incorrect target version, you can fix it by calling code-push patch APP NAME -t VERSION, and then existing clients will be able to get it without needing to release a new version.\n. There isn't currently a way to specify the CodePush release label, but we plan to add that very soon. In the meantime, you could use the description field of a release to specify a semver string for  the actual release if you would like. Most of our users currently think of their CodePush update semver string as being the composition of the target binary version and the CodePush label (e.g. 2.0.9.v1 or just 2.0.9.1 after stripping the v prefix), so you'll see that kind of format show up in apps that use CodePush and display their app version somewhere in the UI (e.g. settings page).\nCorrect, you would only change the target version if your binary needed to change due to a Cordova and/or plugin upgrade.\n. We have heard the request for this before, but we haven't heard it mentioned as a \"blocker\" before, so we've just been trying to prioritize issues/suggestions accordingly. As I mentioned, we will definitely address this soon.\nCodePush determines which version is newer based on the label and the package hash. The label allows it to identity newer, and the package hash allows it to identify whether the newer release is actually equivalent to what you're already running.\nThat said, the CodePush plugin should actually be capable of determining that the binary contents are equivalent to the latest release on CodePush, so if you're seeing an update be synced, then that may be a bug.\nTo answer your other questions:\n1. CodePush will download an update any time you call sync or checkForUpdate. If you want to skip doing that based on the end users connection, we would recommend simply using the cordova-plugin-network-information plugin to check the connection before calling into CodePush.\n2. Yep we do. As long as you release the same app code to CodePush that you shipped with the binary, our server will generate diffs will subsequent releases, and users will only get the new and/or changed files.\n. Yeah the update metadata currently describes the full size of the update, not the over-the-wire size, which could be smaller if the client is getting a diff.\nI'm going to close this issue for now since I believe the original question is resolved, but please open a new issue about the package size if your app has a scenario that requires the actual wire transfer size. We haven't had a request for that yet, but we'd be happy to do it if there was a need. Thanks!\n. LGTM!\n. Apologies for the confusion. I just updated the docs to clarify that the patch command is strictly for modifying release metadata, not the update contents (which is currently immutable). I also added a note about the use of the rollback command to address broken releases.\nLet me know if you think we can make the docs clearer. Thanks for the feedback here, we're always keen to improve our docs.\n. Doh! That is what happens when you edit markdown on your phone on the bus :) Just fixed it!\n. That error typically indicates that your Info.plist is configured with an invalid deployment key. Can you double check that you specified the key value and not the \"friendly name\" (e.g. \"Staging\")? You can retrieve your deployment key by running \"code-push deployment ls APP -k\" and grabbing the key value for the desired deployment.\n. I'm going to close this issue since the conversation is also being tracked on StackOverflow. As I previously mentioned, and was mentioned in your SO post, you just need to make sure that your app is configured with the right deployment key, and isn't using the friendly name (e.g. \"Staging\").\n. This is an unbelievably goofy limitation of the Cordova geolocation plugin. I would recommend using the cordova-custom-config plugin, which enables you to make Info.plist mods from your config.xml. This way you can overwrite platform-specific behavior in a way that won't be blown away when your platforms directory gets deleted/created.\nIf you check out the readme of the aforementioned plugin, you can see that it provides an example specifically for setting this NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription key :)\nI can update our docs to call throw out if you think it's a reasonable solution. We could investigate solving it somehow from our plugin, but I'm not sure if we can in a clean way.\n. OK cool :) I'll use this bug to track adding a mention to our docs about this then. Thanks again for providing this feedback.\n. Ugh that sucks. I guess I'll wait to update the docs then if this isn't even a valid solution. \n. @pke Were you able to figure anything out here? We can help investigate this issue if needed as well, just let us know!\n. Sounds good. Did you still need to use the cordova-custom-config plugin to explicitly set a message?\n. That's a good question. We'll investigate this and see if we can optimize it. Are you noticing any perceivable perf impact, or are you simply seeing that message?\n. Totally understood. I want our plugin to have a negligible impact on app performance, so we will investigate this. I'm just not familiar with how this warning measurement is captured, so I was curious if you could notice an issue (1s is a long time) or not\n. @xlc Those are really helpful pointers! Thanks a lot. It's interesting that the warning doesn't log the method name as well, which would make this a lot more actionable :)\nWe'll investigate into this, and it should be straight forward for us to use that threading guidance to move any expensive native calls off of the UI thread.\n. @pke @xlc I just sent out a PR that I believe addresses this issue. We make use of a few other Cordova plugins, that don't seem to run potentially costly operations on a background thread, so this PR doesn't necessarily fix everything, but it ensures that our native code is doing the right thing and will address the warnings you are seeing.\n. This fix was just merged, and we'll release it to NPM in our next release. It didn't sound like either of you were blocked by this, but if you are, let us know so we can accelerate the release to NPM. Thanks again for the feedback!\n. Closing this is a duplicate of https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/issues/140\n. @joeblew99 We'd definitely be interested in expanding CodePush to the desktop :) Was there a specific app platform you would be interested in having support for? Electron? React Native Desktop? Something else?\n. Yep, if we were to create an Electron client, it would likely be a Node module that was distributed via NPM.\n. Makes sense. The primary reason we haven't prioritized desktop apps is because there are pretty good existing solutions (e.g. Electron has a built-in auto-updater module). I'll close this for now, but please let us know if you want us to re-consider doing something in this space. Thanks for the feedback!\n. @alexdunae Thanks for reaching out! Could you share a little detail about what you're interested in doing? CodePush doesn't currently provide a mechanism for onboarding beta testers in the same way that services like HockeyApp or Crashlytics do, since we don't actually distribute the initial binary to users. With CodePush, a user is a \"beta user\" by virtue of the fact that they're running a version of your app that is syncing with a non-production CodePush deployment (i.e. \"Staging\"). However, they still had to get that binary from somewhere first.\nA binary build can be produced that is configured to sync with the \"Staging\" CodePush deployment, and that binary could then be distributed to your beta testers using a mobile beta distribution service (like HockeyApp), which would provide the necessary onboarding experience.\nIf you're interested in dynamically assigning certain users to a beta deployment, without them needing them to be running a pre-release binary build, then you can take advantage of the fact that the sync method accepts a deployment key when you call it. Using this technique, your authentication service could send back a deployment key as part of the user's profile, which allows you to dynamically place users in a specific deployment on the server-side. We have a lot of users that use this solution for doing A/B testing, giving users beta acces, etc.\nIn general, we're trying to ensure that CodePush works great with any \"App Store\", which includes beta and enterprise stores. To that end, we are trying not to duplicate any behavior that would be naturally provided by those stores unless it makes sense for us. I'd love to understand more about your scenario, and see how we can improve our docs and/or the product to better accommodate it. \nApologies if I totally misunderstood you :)\n. @alexdunae Any thoughts? I'd love to make sure you're unblocked here :)\n. OK cool, thanks for confirming that. I'll close this issue for now, but please do let us know if there is any way we could help clarify our docs or anything. I want to help prevent as much confusion as possible, so any insights here are extremely valuable. Thanks!\n. @fbarletta Can you share what the actual failure was? I believe that message is just stating that the build command failed, but the output should also include a reason why. Thanks!\n. This has been addressed and released to NPM via the v1.8.2-beta release. Let us know if you run into any further issues. Thanks!\n. @fbarletta If you could confirm that the latest release resolved your build issue, that would be awesome. We did a bunch of testing on our end, but I want to make sure you are unblocked. Thanks!\n. @Naoto-Ida Could you provide an example of how you're calling sync? Are you explicitly passing a deployment key to it in order to dynamically switch keys, or are you configuring the keys statically in your Info.plist file and then creating TestFlight/production binary builds? Thanks! Apologies for this issue, we'll try to figure it out ASAP.\n. @Naoto-Ida Any updates here? We'd love to make sure you're unblocked, and can help diagnose this once we know a little more about your project setup.\nAdditionally, can you let us know where you are calling sync? Are you calling it in your root component's componentDidMount event handler?\n. @Naoto-Ida Awesome! Could you share the app you're working on? We always like seeing what folks are building with CodePush :)\nRegarding the rollback, you need to ensure that you call notifyAppReady (or sync) on app start in addition to your app resume handler. This is what indicates that an update was successful to the CodePush runtime, and if it doesn't get called after an update was installed, the update could get rolled back.\nFor example, you could change your mount method to something like the following, which should resolve the rollback issue:\n``` JavaScript\ncomponentDidMount() {\n        // Do an initial sync on app start instead of \n        // waiting until a resume to happen. Also, flag\n        // any installed updates as being successful.\n        codePush.sync();\n    AppState.addEventListener(\"change\", (newState) => {\n        newState === \"active\" && codePush.sync({\n            installMode: codePush.InstallMode.IMMEDIATE,\n            mandatoryInstallMode: codePush.InstallMode.IMMEDIATE\n        })\n    })\n\n})\n``\n. Very cool! If you get a chance to try out the above recommendation, please let us know if that removed the rollbacks, that way we can confirm that you're unblocked. Since this change only impacts JS, you can actually use CodePush to release an update that includes the neccessarynotifyAppReady/sync` call on app start and will prevent any further issues. Thanks!\n. Yeah that's a really awesome use case :) Let me know if you'd be interested in having the app listed in our CodePush showcase, since this is definitely a cool use of the service, and the app looks great!\n. @nicnocquee There isn't currently a workaround to this unfortunately. However, we have a PR already out to add support to React Native 0.29-RC (as a goal, we try to add support to RN releases by the time they \"RTM\"), which should be merged in this afternoon, and we'll release it to NPM ASAP.\nI'm going to close this as a dupe of https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/394, so that we can all track this via a single issue. Thanks for reaching out, and please re-open this if I missed something.\nI'll ping you on this thread when we've released the RN 0.29-compatible bits.\n. @nicnocquee We just released this fix to NPM, so if you upgrade to 1.13.0-beta you should be good to go. Here are the docs for the RN 0.29-specific configuration steps. Let us know if you hit any issues. Thanks!\n. Yeah I agree with you about this. Aside from being able to add new default deployments (\"development\" in your case), what if the deployment name resolution was changed to be case-insensitive? That way, the existing staging and production deployments can be targeted using lowercase if you preferred (e.g. \"code-push deployment h foo staging\")? Would that be valuable? Or do you want the deployment names to be explicitly lowercase?\n. @chendo This is something we hope to get to soon, since we hear this request pretty frequently.\nThat said, we actually want to solve the unnecessary update problem automatically, without any developer or app intervention. The server already has a hash of each update's contents, so we just need the hash of the binary-bundled content in order to no-op available updates that are equivalent to what the App Store version already included.\nOur Cordova plugin already does this, and our React Native plugin will support this as of React Native 0.29.0 (we needed support from the RN packager), so depending on which platform your app is built on, we hope to help solve this without the need of the custom metadata feature.\n. Makes sense. Yeah this feature would help solve that scenario as well. Regarding the time stamp, we should also just add that as well :) I want to enable the custom metadata feature, but also support mainline scenarios out of the box. \nBTW, can I assume you are using React Native? Otherwise, if you're seeing this issue, then we have a bug in our Cordova plugin.\n. Ah OK got it. Apologies that I initially misunderstood you. Yeah, we definitely need to solve the issue of a client \"upgrading\" to an older version.\nFor this scenario, would it have solved your problem if you released a CodePush update that was equivalent to your APK contents? That way, the client would be able to detect an unnecessary update, and subsequent CodePush releases would be able to generate diffs beyond the binary contents as well.\nWe need to document this better, but in general, our recommendation is to release store updates to CodePush as well, to enable the aforementioned benefits.\n. When you generate a new production APK, are you also bumping the version? Or are you referring to an in-house/beta setup, where you have a release APK, but you haven't actually bumped the version yet?\nIf you are bumping the APK version, then you shouldn't have an issue with new clients upgrading to an older CodePush release as long as the existing CodePush releases aren't targeting the new APK's version. That is, unless you are explicitly targeting your CodePush releases at a range (e.g. \"*\").\nThe rollout feature works by segmenting users who would normally be elligle for a release, and only allowing it to a percentage of them. Therefore, using rollout wouldn't impact this issue you're seeing, since it wouldn't provide an update to a client that wasn't already eligible for it in the first place. However, the root cause here could still repro when using rollout, since the issue is clients seeing older updates as applicable.\n. In general, we need to improve the experience of detecting updates in an environment where the host binary hasn't bumped the version. Primarily, we see this in beta distribution scenarios (e.g. HockeyApp), which is effectively what it sounds like you're doing. \n. Closing due to misclick :) \n. @keanuyaoo Is this with the Android emulator or a device? We've seen instances where the network connectivity of a simulator will get \"broken\", and you need to restart it in order to get it working smoothly again.\nAlso, could you share whether this is a Cordova or React Native app, and which other 3rd party plugins you're using? We're not aware of an issue here on either platform, but it would be helpful to understand your app setup so we can possibly try to reproduce this. Thanks!\n. @faceach Thanks for the feedback! We have this feature request tracked via #266, so I'm going to close this issue and we'll update the existing one as we make progress.\n. Now that we've removed the ID from the deployment listing, we should just remove it from here as well, since the app ID doesn't seem particularly valuable. What do you think about changing this message to: 'Successfully added app \", along with the following deployments:'?\n. Can we just call it \"Key\" instead of \"Deployment Key\"?\n. I would love it if we can add the cell borders to the non-verbose table as well :)\n. Can we actually rename this to \"Minimum App Store Version\":?\n- ShishirH: I agree with Jonathan.\n. Can we remove the description column from the verbose table? I'm actually not sure if its valuable at all\n. This has nothing to do with your changes, but while you're updating the CLI, could you update the command group descriptions to the following. Right now, the descriptions for many of the groups are just re-stating the name :)\naccess-key - View and delete active user sessions\napp - View and manage your CodePush-enabled apps\ndeployment - View and manage the deployments for your apps\nlogin - Authenticate with the CodePush server in order to begin managing your apps\n. :+1: \n. Merge away! Thanks dude\n. LGTM!\n. Can we change the path to be \"./platforms/ios/www\" just to reflect a specific path for a Cordova iOS app?\n. \"mobile app updates\"\n. Should we just remove the id column from here as well?\n- I kept it for test purpose. we have few tests which checks the id and name. Also, I like the idea of being able to get all related data for a resource somehow. \n. Doh! I need to add detail about the access key command as well, so I'll just another PR with that, fix this link and two other typos.\n. I forgot to add the /Microsoft path to these two links, but just fixed it.\n. Yeah I know. I'm just adding the real URLs here instead of leaving todos. The GitHub repos aren't public either, so from the user's perspective, none of these links are deployed :)\n. Sounds good. I'll make that change\n. Doh! I'll fix the typo in the second access key mention\n. How about the following:\n'[Error] Cannot remove the access key for the current user session. Please run \"code-push logout\" if you would like to remove this access key'\n- done\n. What about something like... \"In order to view the history of releases for a specific app deployment (including promotions), you can use the following command\"\n. Agreed!\n. It seems obvious, but could we add a \"formal\" example of the args here like we do for the promote command? (E.g. \"code-push rollback  \")\n. I think of this as an edge case scenario, so I think it's fine to not overly document how to get the label. That said, maybe the description can have an \"(e.g. v12)\" example to make it a little clearer.\n. What do you think about making this the default export? \n. Should we have constants for the status values or make it an enum? Currently, it seems like the consumer of this API needs to know what value represents success and failure, and it might make sense to have the acquisition SDK do this.\n. What about changing the second sentence to something like this?: \"Please specify the direct path to the update content's directory (e.g. /platforms/ios/www) or file (e.g. main.jsbundle).\"\nThat way, in addition to rejecting the binaries, we also provide an example of what the parameter expects.\n. Sorry, I had a typo in my string suggestion :) It should be `/platforms/ios/www'.\n. Should this be moved above to be sorted alpha?\n. What do you think about calling this \"Rollbacks\" instead? I think it more accurately reflects what it represents since we can't say for sure that it was actually a failure. It could have been a dev error (by not calling notifyApplicarionReady), a timing issue (the device died at the perfect moment), etc. It's also possible for the app to include a crash post-notifyApplicationReady that we wouldn't catch and report here, so tying this metric specifically to the concept of a rollback will help make it more deterministic.\n. I'm in favor of showing the installs metric even if it's zero, but only showing the pending number of its non-zero. \n. Should we show downloads here? I'd prefer to be consistent with the other commands and display the pending install count instead.\nAdditionally, instead of adding the \"Type\" column, what if we added the \"App version\" column,  and for binary releases, the \"Label\" column would be empty. If you made the \"App version\" column the first column, it would act as a sort of \"section header\" for all of the CodePush releases it contains.\n. I'd be in favor of always showing this number. That way, deployment ls always shows the number of active and pending installs, even if one of them is zero. That said, if we always show it, we would just want to not show a negative number, so it might make sense to do Math.max(numPending, 0).toLocaleString or something.\n. Wouldn't you need a newline at the beginning of this string?\n. Do we need to list the existing collaborators after adding one? It seems like it would be OK if we skipped this to simplify the output of the command.\n- shishirh: sounds good to me.\n. Should this be something like \"App collaborator removal cancelled.\"?\n- shishirh: yes\n. Should this column header be \"E-mail address\" or something similar? I think it's clear that the list represents the collaborators, since the dev would have had to enter that command to display it, so it might make sense to name the column closer to what the contents represents.\n. What do you think about: \"[EMAIL]\" is an invalid e-mail address.?\n. Shouldn't this be something like Successfully added [EMAIL] as a collaborator to the [APP] app\"?\n. WouldgetAppDisplayNamebe a better name?\n. MaybegetCollaboratorDisplayName?\n. How about \"sourceDeploymentKey\" and \"sourceLabelOrAppVersion\"? Or maybe \"previous\"?\n. Do we need to perform this check since setting the property to undefined/null would have the affect of not creating the property at all.\n. Should this be sorted below the appRename method?\n- addressed.\n. We can probably drop the use of \"app\" after displaying the app name. \n. How about \"Successfully added EMAIL as a collaborator to APP\"?\n. You seem to have a newline after all the other throwFor\\* statements.\n. What about \"Successfully removed EMAIL as a collaborator from APP\"?\n. In the case of the JSON format, we probably want the owner/collaborator distinction provided in a structure way, instead of relying on a display name. Should we just return the \"raw\" collaborators list?\n. How about \"Transfer the ownership of an app to another account\"?\n. I'm still not in love with this name :) I don't feel super strongly about it, but I think I'd prefer \"displayAuthor\", with the alias of just \"a\".\n- Will change this.\n. What do you think about displaying \"You\" in this column if the release author was the current user? We could colorize it another color, that way it would be easier to scan for releases that were clearly released by other users. I feel like this would be similar to the way we display \"friendly\" relative times for the release time column to improve readability.\n. Note that this doc assumes we will go with the name--displayAuthoras I proposed in the other PR. If we stick with--displayReleasedBy`, I can change this to reflect that.\n. Good catch! I'll add that.\n. Shouldn't we use the rimraf library that you added a dependency for? Would this work correctly on Windows?\n. I wonder if we should use the locally installed packager to run this, as opposed to relying on the global CLI. That way we know which versions of RN we support since we'd be depending on a Node module that's shipped with the platform as opposed to a globally installed CLI. It seems a little cleaner to use a n NPM module instead of shelling to a CLI if possible as well.\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/packager/react-packager/index.js\n. I'm a little weary of this since it seems pretty possible for this regex to match multiple times within a single build.gradle file. I wonder whether it wouldn't be a better idea to try to read the version from the AndroidManifest.xml that is ultimately generated from your gradle build. Parsing XML seems like a much better option than Groovy.\n. This would result in a warning for Cordova users that don't have RN installed? If so, I think we should skip adding it, and instead rely on dynamically requiring the packager at runtime like I mentioned in my other comment.\n. I almost think it would be clearer to just use \"os.tmpdir()\" below instead of wrapping that expression in a method. If you wanted just a method, could t you do something like \"var {tmpdir} = os\"?\n. Sure. In practice, it might not be common, but any number of other plugins or config objects could also have a method called versionName (the dynamic nature of the Groovy-based DSL makes lots of things possible). Additionally, the value being passed to the versionName method could also be dynamic, and therefore, simply capturing the string like this wouldn't be sufficient. Once again, that could be rare, but we already know of one example of a native Android app integrating RN into it, and we should keep that in mind here if possible. The AndroidManifest.xml solution wouldn't have either of these issues, and might merits a quick investigation. \n. Ah OK. It might be worth looking into Jest as a test runner at some point. It auto mocks required modules (with the ability to fake their behavior), which makes it pretty clean to write unit tests, without needing to abstract existing modules any further simply to be able to mock/stub them within tests.\n. Ah, I forgot that the local CLI does a bunch of work (the relationship between the global CLI, local CLI and packager is pretty confusing), so you're totally right that we shouldn't consume the packager for this.\nIf we consumed the local CLI directly would we need to duplicate a bunch of work in the global CLI? If we absolutely have to use the global CLI, then that's cool, I'm just curious if that is the case.\n. Awesome! \n. I would be cool with that if we made sure to catch the right versionName.\n. Do you want to update this string to \"VSTS integration\" while you're at it? :)\n. Is this warning actually necessary? I feel like the new behavior is intuitive, and therefore, I'm not sure if it makes sense to warn the user here.\n. Should we mention again here what the default value is and explain that setting this parameter is valuable if you want to override that?\n. Maybe add another semver range example? Something like '...for example: \"1.0.0\", \"\" or \"^1.2.3\")'?\n. For completeness, should we add a tilde range example (e.g. \"~1.2.3\") and a hyphenated range example (e.g. \"1.2.3 - 1.4.0\")?\n. It turns out that \"\" is equivalent to \"\", in the same way that \"1\" is equivalent to \"1..\". Should we include an example that highlights creating a range by omitting a component (e.g. 1.0, 1)?\n. I'd also like to understand how we behave with pre-release tags: https://github.com/npm/node-semver#prerelease-tags\n. Rename this to Target binary version?\n. targetBinaryVersion?\n. We should change the \"appVersion\" parameter to be called \"targetBinaryVersion\" for consistency with the CLI.\n. Should we expose \"renameDeployment\" and \"renameApp\" methods to better reflect the CLI and the general purpose of editing either entity type? If this method is needed by the CLI, maybe we could just not document it, and create a rename variant to simply \"wraps\" the more general-purpose update methods.\n. Do we want this name to be uppercased? I had thought we were naming enums using sentence-casing, with their members being uppercased (e.g. InstallMode.IMMEDIATE).\n. I think I'd be in favor of calling it \"AppPermission\" as well, unless we're not thinking of this as an \"enum\".\n. Aren't those two names basically semantically equivalent? The deployment is essentially just a history of releases, so I believe simply calling it clear is clear enough. I don't feel super strongly about the SDK name, but I definitely am in favor of keeping the CLI command \"code-push deployment clear\" as opposed to \"code-push deployment clear-history\" or something like that.\n. I'd vote for \"Clears the release history associated with a deployment.\", that way, we ensure the details about what it is doing is clear without needing to encode it into the command name (e.g. \"clear-history\").\n. How about \"Successfully cleared the release history associated with...\"?\n. Besides a deployment's name, key, and its relationship to its parent app, what other attributes does it have other than its history? I think of the clear operation as being equivalent to clearing an array or dictionary/etc., which wouldn't obviously impact the references that point at that dictionary instance (the app->deployment relationship), or even the \"identity\". The name and key are the identity of the deployment (on the management and acquisition sides, respectively), and I guess I'm just saying that I don't think folks would expect an operation named \"clear\" to mutate those. But I could obviously be wrong :)\nI'm definitely not trying to oversimplify this, but I also don't want to overcomplicate it either. Conceptually thinking of a deployment as a history of releases seems legitimate to me.\n. This is simply documenting what is already in master, as well as what the production server accommodates. We can update the readme as new features get rolled in.\n. I was going to, but I decided to mirror what you did in the release-react command when deleting the temp folder. Since Promise.prototype.finally isn't standard, I kind of prefer doing this, but I'm happy either way.\n. Can we make rollout the last parameter?\n. Can we rename the packageInfo parameter to updateMetadata (I'm crusading to eradicate the term \"package\" wherever possible :))? Also, I know this wasn't part of your PR, but could we rename destDeploymentName to destinationDeploymentName? We aren't using abbreviations anywhere else, so it would be nice to be consistent.\n. I think we should still expose label as a \"positional argument\", and rename packageInfo to updateMetadata. \njavascript\nCodePush.patchRelease(\"Foo\", \"Staging\", \"v34\", { mandatory: false })\n. Did you want to convert the description, mandatory and rollout options into an updateMetadata parameter like you did for patchRelease and promote?\n- addressed\n. Should we mention in the description that label defaults to the latest release?\n- sure\n. Does this accept -m (treated equivalent to -m true), -m true, and -m false?\n. Didn't we update the parameter name to destinationDeploymentName?\n. Is it just called metadata, not updateMetadata?\n. \"Link an additional authentication provider (e.g. GitHub) to an existing CodePush account\"?\n. I'm going to leave it as \"tabular\", since that was the existing verbiage, and I think the term is common enough that I don't feel motivated to change it right now :)\n.  The \"If omitted...\" part should follow the same pattern as the options above, since the version would be inherited from the promoted release, not read from the project files.\n. No need for the \"If omitted...\" sentence here.\n. \"If omitted, the version property...\"\n. Isn't the proxy parameter also optional?\n. To help illustrate the fact that this parameter expects a complete URL, can we replace \"proxyURL\" with a random but meaningful example like \"https://someproxy.com:455\"?\n. How about using this description: \"Bypass the system-wide proxy settings\"? The session file wouldn't be used when logging in, since it would have been deleted when you logged out.\n. I would be in favor of omitting the noProxy example to keep things simple. I think showing the examples with and without a proxy server should accommodate the most common cases, and we can just rely on the docs and option description to explain the noProxy parameter.\n. How about using this description: \"URL of the proxy server to use\"? There's no need to add the leading space either. It's a bug that the access key option has one :)\n. I'd be in favor of converting the last three parameters into an options object since they're all optional. That way, this constructor only has two parameters, and a user wouldn't need to specify two nulls simply to specific a proxy server. \n. Your English is totally fine! We all nit pick each other's docs :)\n. Should we display something if the noProxy flag was set? Otherwise, the user might get confused why CodePush isn't using a system-wide setting. Maybe we could display something like \"Proxy: Ignored\" to indicate this? \n. What do you think about prefixing this line with \"Account: \" if there is a proxy? That way we display two sets of key-value pairs that are clearly distinguished.\n. Minor nit, but I'd prefer that we only show the \"Account: \" prefix if we're also showing the proxy. That way, for the users not using the proxy support, the existing behavior remains the same. But if we do show the proxy, then we label both peices of data.\n. Could we use chalk.green to colorize the labels? That way it's consistent with the other key/value pairs we display throughout the CLI.\n. Should we be more specific here and say that app's must be below 200mb in size? Also, the \"Release failed,\" probably isn't necessary since it would already be clear that an error happened as part of the release.\n. This casing is always used. If anything, we have a feature request to enable specifying a different name and/or location, but if the app is using Info.plist, it's always cased this way.\n. Let's make this 1.11.0-beta since we're adding the new proxy feature, and also, don't forget to update the code-push dependency to 1.9.0-beta to pull in the updates to the SDK needed for the proxy feature.\n. This should be phonegap prepare, and we can probably remove the for PhoneGap instances section.\n. Same comment as above.\n. Should we add some verbiage here to ensure that devs know they need to save off the key somewhere since it won't be displayed anywhere in the CLI?\n. I realize this isn't directly related to your PR, but should we rename \"Time Created\" to just \"Created\"? With the formatting that we use for the time strings, I think it reads more naturally.\n. I can appreciate why you went with \"maxAge\" as the name of this, but I can't help but feel like it sounds odd. The use of \"max\" is pretty strange, since I'm assuming our server has no intention of expiring the key sooner than the specified durarion, unlike how a browser or intermediary server might do with an HTTP response. I think as long as our docs and inline help description explain that this value is relative to the current time, as opposed to being an absolute date, we could call it \"expiration\" or \"ttl\" or whatever, and it wouldn't be confusing.\n. I need to think about this a little bit, but my initial feeling here is that I'd prefer to have a \"rename\" command (like we have for app and deployment already), and then a \"renew\" command that specifically refreshed the TTL of the key. The use of rename feels important for consistency, and I can't help but feel like a renew command seems more intuitive than editing a maxAge field, especially since we don't display the max age value in the access key list. We show the remaining time left.\n. How about \"Logged in\" instead of \"Started\"? GitHub uses the phrase \"Signed in\" for this in their sessions list, and it sounds more natural than \"Started\", since the action that the user took to create the session was to actually login.\n. Do we want to add a getSessions method to the management SDK instead of defining this behavior in the CLI?\n. Should we call this removeSession? I appreciate that on the server there could be multiple sessions for the same machine, but the CLI gives the impression that there is a 1:1 relationship between machine names and sessions, so if feels like the SDK should do the same thing.\n. The description should say \"login sessions\" not \"access keys\"\n. Is this list already going to be sorted alphabetically by machine name?\n. I would prefer that we just call this parameter name instead of friendlyName, since that is the name we display in the CLI output.\n. Nope, sorting by created time makes sense. Thanks for confirming.\n. What you're explaining seems purely based on the historical decisions that we've made, as opposed to what makes the most sense from an end user perspective. The fact that session and access keys are the same is an implementation detail that has zero value to a developer. If you disagree than we should close this PR and just leave the CLI as is, and modify the existing access key LS command.\nI don't really feel strongly about this, but I also don't see the argument for why a consumer of the SDK should know that sessions and access keys are the same.\n. That's why I check that the process.platform is OS X first.\n. Correct. This is basically doing syntax checking on the free-form \"platform\" parameter, not on the validity of the environment for the platform you specified wanting logs for.\n. I simply followed the existing pattern used within this file, but I'm actually not sure why we're even creating a new runtime variable simply to appease TypeScript for casting purposes. This seems like a cleaner solution and resolves your comment as well:\njavascript\ncmd = <cli.IDebugCommand>{\n    type: cli.CommandType.debug,\n    platform: arg1\n};\n. Done!\n. This was specifically for @geof90 :) Yay! I'm a pro dev now!\n. OK, sounds good to me.\n. The project object is the implicit \"global\" in a Gradle build file, so you can reference a global property with or with the project. prefix (e.g. project.FOO or FOO are equivalent), very similarly to the window object in the browser.\n. Also, the properties that are defined via grade.properties are exposed to the build file as properties on the project object, so I don't think we need to make this solution any more generic, since there isn't another global object that property references could be made off of (e.g. build.FOO).\n. I replied to your original comment :)\n. Ah yeah that's a good point. I was trying to go with the simplest solution, but I forgot about the leading zero problem. Thanks for the catch!\n. Yeah my intention here wasn't to outline all possible values, but rather, to provide some examples which illustrate the syntax. Also, I'm comfortable with the use of TTL here, which is why we named the parameter that in the first place. \n. ",
    "silhouettes": "LGTM!\n. LGTM!\n. This is great work, although while we're working on this area, I've been meaning to bring up several simplifications I'd really love to make to access keys in general, I'm hoping we can discuss this in greater detail\n. I feel a bit hesitant about this approach, because it relies on some quirks about ordering and the number of parameters for different commands. Also, I feel like there is something about this explanation that doesn't add up, because seemingly by this logic we should have the same problem when running 'code-push app rm add'.\nI've scanned the yargs documentation (https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs) and to my uninformed eyes it looks like the problem is that we're using yargs' command() function to declare these options. Have you tried looking at the implementation and/or playing with the choices() API maybe, or one of the others?\n. Okay - I agree that this particular symptom is a corner case, I just wanted to make sure we fully understood the extent of the issue. If you're confident that the root cause of this issue won't create problems elsewhere then it looks good to me! Thanks so much for explaining.\nAnd yep - it would be great to file a bug on yargs to see what they say :)\n. Thanks @agcolom!\n. I implemented some of the changes we talked about, is that okay with you? Basically, the intention is to use the guid for uniqueness, and the crypto random string for unpredictability.\nWhen the two are put together and base64-encoded, the key is 40 characters long. I am tempted to just remove the accountId at the end now, because I imagine it might be easy to confuse your keys with each other if they all end with the same characters, and I'm not sure if the accountId at the end adds any value on top of the random string. What do you think?\n. Okay sorry for the hassle, thanks for discussing it with me. Is this okay with you?\n. Nice! LGTM\n. LGTM!\n. Nice work, looks good to me! Sorry for being nitpicky.\n. Per prior discussion, I've also removed the word 'minimum' used to describe app store versions in the CLI, as we match the latest update by exact app store version. Thanks dtivel and lostintangent!\n. It seems like we've reached consensus, and I'm quite happy with the suggestions too! I've gone and implemented the changes. Thanks for the feedback!\n. LGTM\n. On it\n. Nice catch on the wrapping. Yeah I was sorting case sensitively, but maybe an insensitive sort is better. Thanks for the feedback!\n. Hi, yes we are currently looking at geographically distributing our servers, especially as we have several users from outside the US and from the Asia-Pacific region in general. May I ask for more details on your connection failure? Was there an error message? We expect higher latency, but not a complete failure.\n. My recommendation is simply to keep using the service as it is now while we make improvements. For example, we have a release progress indicator coming soon, and we are actively working on performance improvements right now. Please keep in mind that the service is still in beta and we are using this time as an evaluation period to iron out any issues.\n@bsw85: Did the ETIMEDOUT error happen consistently for you, or only the one time? You said you got it when running the 'deployment command' - do you mean 'code-push release' specifically, or is this a general issue with all of the CLI commands?\n@bsw85 and @ryanlin1986:\nIs the performance problem primarily with the CLI (e.g. running 'code-push deployment list'), compared to the client SDK (e.g. sync())? The CLI commands are much more server-intensive, performing several roundtrips, and are definitely an area we can optimize.\nWe imagine that the most important area of optimization is for the end users (i.e. in the client SDK). With that in mind, we're considering the possibility of rolling out a CDN that will cache the packages for your app. If we were to do this in the future, and fix only major performance problems in the CLI, would this be enough to solve your problem?\n. Hi @ryanlin1986, while it is possible to reverse-engineer the client sdk to build your own server, we don't recommend it and we can not spend any resources to support this scenario at the moment. Backwards compatibility may be a problem with future CLI versions, and you will also be missing out on future improvements that we make both on the client and the server.\nPlease keep in mind that the CodePush service is still in beta, so it is not intended to be at production quality while we gather feedback and make improvements. We do intend to have a server in Asia before we exit beta though!\n. Looks good\n. Feedback:\n- Specify which label was rolled back from\n- Display a confirmation dialog on all destructive commands (and add '-f'/'--force' option)\n. Looks good!\n. Looks good!\n. Looks good!\n. Looks good!\n. Looks good!\n. The default export thing is actually a surprisingly hard change to make considering that we need to handle exporting both TypeScript interfaces and a default JavaScript object, manage .d.ts generation, and handle inter-op between CommonJS and ES6. I've talked to Jonathan about this and I'll be doing this as part of a later PR to prepare the SDK for external usage. \n. Looks good!\n. I have a few thoughts on the presentation of the data, but as this is more of a squishy topic, discussion is welcome!\n1. In the deployment metrics command, the label 1.2.3 is a little bit unclear - would it be worth annotating it somehow, e.g. 1.2.3 (app store version) or 1.2.3 (base) or adding an appVersion column and just making it base?\n2. In the deployment history command, I think percentages are more useful than raw numbers, especially if we can get the raw data with the deployment metrics command. I think instead of raw success/failure numbers, it would be better to have a single success percentage, especially as we have the raw download number if we want to know the magnitude.\n3. Similarly in deploment history, I think instead of a raw 'Active' number it should be a percentage, and it should be listed in brackets next to the label, e.g. v1 (0.1%). This may be more controversial though.\n4. In deployment metrics, I think it would be nice to have the percentage in brackets next to the 'success' and 'fail' numbers, although this is probably less important.\n5. I think bad releases should be visually distinguished, one possible way is that if the failure rate is above a certain percentage, it will be colored red.\n6. ~~I think the string 'Active' might have a misleading connotation, maybe the string 'Users' would be better~~\n. I think it's unclear that the 'Active' percentage is a percentage of the total number of devices, rather than of the number of installs. Could we just add the total number in the brackets to disambiguate that? e.g. Active: 8.8% (3 of 33). That '33' number would then be the same across all of the versions and hopefully make it deducible.\n. Sweet! Looks good\n. Looks good!\n. :+1: !\n. Looks good!\n. :+1:\n. :+1: \n. Looks good!\n. Looks good!\n. Looks good!\n. @Almouro: We've just deployed a hotfix for this issue. Can you confirm that the problem is resolved for you?\nI will close this issue in the meantime, as it should no longer affect users.\n. Looks good. I'm assuming that the SDK didn't change at all since our last release.\n. I went ahead and copy pasted the whole README into Word and fixed all of the typos I could find, let me know if I missed anything!\n. Looks good\n. Looks good to me!!\n. Yeah, I think of the machine name more like an internal or 'generated' field that users don't specify directly, similarly to the createdTime field. The only reason it's on the client as opposed to the server (unlike createdTime) is that the server can't infer your machine name otherwise. If the user wants to annotate specific information, they can always use the description field. Let me know if you disagree!\n. There are a few places where it should be 'retrieves' instead of 'retreives'\n. Perfecto!\n. Looks good!\n. Thanks for getting onto this, LGTM :)\n. Hey @candidodmv, as @geof90 mentioned, we cannot currently roll you back if there is no previous release (the server will reject the rollback). As a workaround, you can disable the release so that nobody else gets it using code-push patch MyApp MyDeployment --disabled, and/or re-release the initial binary version on CodePush. We agree completely that the solution you proposed would be ideal and are working on it!\n. Apologies, we've run into some issues with the implementation of this so we've had to shelve it for now. We're currently swamped, but we do intend to address this, although it'll be some months down the line. As a workaround, please just re-release the version that you'd like to roll back to! \n. Please include me also!. Looks good!\n. Sweet! Looks good\n. Looks good!\n. Hey @dkokic, hope your presentation went well! Just so you know, we've deployed a fix on the server, and + characters should now be accepted in app and deployment names.\nWe've also re-validated all of the other special characters (including international characters). For future reference, only the following special characters are disallowed (and we enforce them on app creation):\n/, \\, ?, :, control characters (unicode 0x00-0x1F and 0x7F-0x9F)\nSorry about the trouble, and please let us know if you run into any other issues!\n. Looks good.\n. Looks good!\n. Thank you @kiliwalk! I just have two quick tweaks I'd recommend, and if someone else can sign off on this I'll merge it asap.\n. Thank you @kiliwalk, you've just added a new feature to the CodePush CLI! Really appreciate you taking the time to do this.\n. Hi @joshuaferrara, cool app! We'll work on adding your app to the 'Friends of CodePush' page :)\n. @zk if you're willing to submit a PR, and it is solid, we're happy to take it :). My sincere apologies, but we have been significantly delayed. Are you just looking for security documentation, or the update signing feature specifically? I am actively working on the latter at the moment, and the ETA is 1-2 weeks, at which point I can update you here.\n\n@corintho, @alexanderkjeldaas \nIf you don't mind, I'd be interested in gathering your feedback on the design of this feature. We would ideally like to make this compulsory for all users, but we'd also like to ensure that the process is as unobtrusive as possible.\nDo any of the following appeal to you?\nSignature generation\n1. Delegate the generation of public/private key pair to the developer\n2. Have a utility built into the CodePush CLI that generates it for you\n3. Re-use the same credentials that you use to perform app store releases\n4. Other?\n(3) seemingly makes the most sense, as it requires the least work, means less keys to manage, and means that App Store releases and CodePush releases are guarded by the same credential.\nSignature storage\n1. Cache it within the CLI itself (what granularity? per app? per deployment?)\n2. Manually supply it to the CLI each time you make a release\n3. Sign the package yourself independently of the CLI\n(1) seemingly makes the most sense to me, as it is the most convenient.\n. @corintho, with the signature validation, what kind of tampering are you referring to?\nThe implementation I have in mind involves storing a private key on your machine and a public key baked natively into the app. From the CLI, any release will be hashed and signed with the private key, and from the app, that hash will be verified with the public key and then cross-checked against the contents of the actual package. With this in mind, I'm not sure if it matters whether the validation of the signature happens at the OS level, natively, or otherwise? Any tampering with the validation process would only affect the single device that had been tampered with.\n. We don't have the resources to finish this off, and we may be making very large architectural changes, so I'm closing this PR for now. We can re-open it later if needed!\n. Hi @patoroco, that feature is not in our immediate future, it's just an idea we've been thinking about, however we can prioritize it a little more if you think it's very important! In the mean-time, I do think it's a good idea to split your platforms into different apps.\nI'm going to close this issue as it seems like you have a way forward, but please let us know if you need any other help! Thanks for using CodePush :)\n. @tutumagi, did that answer your question? I'm closing this issue for now, but feel free to re-open it if you need anything else!\n. LGTM!\n. Just so you know, we would love to add this! It is on our backlog, but it is at least a few months out.\n. Okay, seems like a lot of people want this. Thinking about it, here's how I think this could be done. git logs are definitely an option, you could watch for changes in package.json, config.xml, and native files. Basically on each release:\n1. Find the files that changed since the last release: git diff --name-only <lastReleaseSHA> HEAD\n2. If any file changed that is NOT included in the package, reject the release. Also reject the release for changes in other special files, e.g. package.json or config.xml.\n3. Store the current SHA somewhere for the next time release is called: git log -1 --pretty=format:\"%h\"\nFirstly, does that make sense, do people have feedback?\nSecondly, this doesn't seem too hard - would anyone like to take a crack at this?\nAs this is git-specific, I'm not sure this should be built into the CLI, but if you wrote a simple script to be run on each release, we could put it in a shared utilities folder and expose a hook for that script to be run on each release.\n\nFiguring out where to store the SHA of the last release is interesting, as you could either store it on disk in your temp directory, check it in as a file with your source, store it on your own server, or store it on the CodePush server. Do you guys typically just need this on one machine, or does it need to work across multiple machines?\nAlso, here is a possible way that we could expose the ability for you to add custom scripts as 'release hooks', but if you do end up scripting something, write it in whatever way you want and we can iron out the details later.\n. How about checked in with your source? (In a location that wouldn't be included in a release, e.g. where your build scripts are)\nThe only reason I hesitate to add it to the server is because it is less flexible that way and adds an extra dependency for whoever is writing a custom script, and also this feature would be specific to git users only. I'm still open to the idea though, maybe we could expose a custom field where you could store whatever information you liked.\n. @kennethlynne, @nevir, @jsierles, @r-bansal, @heat - Thanks for reporting this! We have added a --noDuplicateReleaseError flag that is available in v1.12.5-beta: https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/releases/tag/v1.12.5-beta. Please let us know if you find this useful!\n. Tagging @chendo on this issue as he had a similar request.\n. @max-mironov Would you be able to implement this?. We don't have the resources to finish this off, and we may be making very large architectural changes, so I'm closing this PR for now. We can re-open it later if needed!\n. I am closing this as the issue seems to be resolved, but we look forward to your CodePush showcase submission!\n. Not currently, unfortunately. We have a giant backlog at the moment. Please let us know if this is critical and we can re-adjust our priorities accordingly!\n. A PR can definitely be made! The app add command is here. One way is to programmatically delete the deployments after they're added, but the server already supports turning off automatic deployment creation, you'd just need to modify the management SDK slightly here:\npublic addApp(appName: string, manuallyProvisionDeployments: boolean = false): Promise<App> {\n        var app: App = { name: appName, manuallyProvisionDeployments: manuallyProvisionDeployments };\nAnd after that you can add custom deployments as needed like this.\nOur SDK is extremely flexible and can be used to do almost anything you can do with the CLI.\n. Just to acknowledge this, we would love to have better CI integration in general, beyond what we currently have. This is on our backlog, but it is at least a few months out, as we are currently focusing on crash and analytics integration.\nIt is also worth associating this with #252, which seems to be a big part of this.\n. Updated #252 with a possible way to implement it, feedback more than welcome!\n. Great!! We'll add you to the showcase today. I just read the article, the app looks very cool :)\n. @slowsay, did you still need help with this?\n. Feel free to re-open this if you still need help!\n. Thanks for catching this! Fortunately it only seems to apply to the release command, and not the release-react and release-cordova commands, which might explain why we haven't seen it yet. I've just put up a fix for the root cause (the number conversion), but let me know if you'd still like to see the other changes you mentioned!\n. This was fixed with release 1.12.3-beta, thanks for filing this!\n. Yup, the comment is still valid - that happens at the shell itself, before it gets to yargs. I tried just then with the semver range >1.10 and the shell responded output is not a tty\n. I think that you'll basically be able to use our CLI to release updates and our server to store them, but you'll need to write the client-side acquisition code yourself. Your SDK would talk to the server via the /updateCheck route - here is some example code to give you an idea of what the route looks like.\nDoes that help? Please let me know if you need any further guidance!\n. Hi @af7, I'm happy to answer any specific questions that you might have, but we don't currently have the resources to make a detailed example tailored to your scenario. For what you need, I think the React Native plugin is a good reference example in general, although you probably won't need to implement every single feature we've implemented there. The most relevant part to you would probably be how the updateCheck  call is constructed.\nDoes that help? I'm happy to answer specific questions if you have any.\n. Closing this issue for now, but feel free to come back with any further questions!\n. What is the App Store version configured with your app? To ensure compatibility between the native binary interface and the dynamically updated JS, CodePush versions your binary code using the App Store version of your app. We expect this version to follow semver (e.g. 1.0.0), so it's likely that you just need to change it to conform to the format. Does that make sense?\nAs this is a common point of confusion, I'll leave this issue open either way, so that we can track improving the error message and possibly leaving a note in the setup instructions.\n. We've improved the error message. Thanks for reporting this!\n. The limit is 200 MB at the moment. Out of curiosity, how big is your app?\nNote that each time you perform a release, you'll need to upload the whole app, and the server will take care of generating file-level diffs between versions of your app.\n. @adriano-di-giovanni - yes, everything you said is more or less correct. You always upload the whole app, and the update sent to clients is typically incremental (new/updated files added, deleted files removed). We also generate diffs for multiple versions beyond (i-1), but I can't be specific how many versions back because that may change.. @talisk - is this still happening for you?\nAs an update, we have rolled out a CDN for distributing the updates, which should speed up the download time globally. Update checks and release commands will still hit our main server, with the performance seeming to depend on where in China you are - we do have many Chinese customers, with a small subset of them reporting slow times.\n. Thanks for reporting this! This has been fixed in v1.12.5-beta: https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/releases/tag/v1.12.5-beta\n. Looks good!\n. Yes, this is a weakness of ours right now :( If you'd like to manually rollback, you can also re-publish a release containing the contents of your last non-buggy version, and optionally mark it as a mandatory update. \n. Closing this for now, but feel free to let us know if you still have issues! For updates on this feature request, please subscribe to #187, which is where we are tracking it.\n. Hi @jrz90000, I'm assuming this solved your issue, but please feel free to continue commenting if it didn't!\n. Here are some possible reasons why you might not see updates:\n- Deployment key mismatch\n- App version mismatch\n- The app is being rolled back\nWe can try to figure out what it is by following these debugging steps:\n1. Do you see any installs or rollbacks in your deployment history? code-push deployment history <appName> <deploymentName>\n2. If that doesn't help, what happens when you test it locally with your production key, and view the log output? You can use any log viewer or the code-push debug command to see them.\nLet me know how it goes!\n. Okay, so:\n1. To view the logs, you'd need to run code-push debug while your app is running in an emulator on your machine (it's a run-time log that shows what is happening as sync() is called).\n2. To check that your CodePush releases target the correct app versions of your app, look at the App Version column of the deployment history command, and then check that they match the versionName string in your build.gradle.\n3. I suspect that the cause of the problem here is that your versionName string is not semver-compliant. It needs to be semver-compliant, or at least two dot-separated integers, i.e. 1.0 or 1.0.0, so that your releases can be targeted correctly. You may see this mentioned in the CodePush logs in step (1).\n4. If none of the above address your problem, can you show me the code where you're using CodePush in your app?\n. Sure thing, if you add me to the repo I'll have a look! The fact that there are no installs, rollbacks, or logs seems to imply that CodePush is not running at all, so I'm wondering if it's some kind of configuration thing.\n. Hi @yogiben, did you still need help with this? You can also paste the code snippets of where you used CodePush if you'd like. Also, it might be worth looking through the manual installation steps for Android, just in case RNPM didn't work correctly.\n. Closing this for now, but please re-open the issue if you still need help, or if you are someone else and facing the same problem!\n. It seems like this question is being answered in https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/474, so I'm closing this as a dupe.\n. In CodePush, there are two types of keys.\nThe deploymentKey (e.g. staging/production) gives access for clients to download updates on a specific deployment, and can also be used as an identifier for the deployment.\nThe accessKey is a separate key that gives a developer access to publish updates on any app under their account. To configure VSTS, you will need one of these keys. From the CLI, you can run code-push access-key ls and code-push access-key add ... to get an access key for your build.\nDoes that solve the issue for you?\n. Hi @asadsahi, cordova.exec() is the function used to call a native function from JavaScript. Judging by the screenshot you posted (Unhandled exec call), it looks like the bridge between your native code and JavaScript code is broken.\nSo, keep in mind that CodePush can only update your script assets, not your native code. Your native code is a fixed shell to which you can release multiple script versions, and if you release some script that depends on a different native shell, it will not work.\nSpecifically, you should not be updating config.xml between CodePush releases. For example, if you add a new plugin and try to release that over CodePush, it will not work, because the script will depend on the new native code of the plugin, which is not present in your existing native shell. The version in your config.xml (e.g. 0.0.1) is the version of your native code, and is separate from the version of your script code, which is an auto-generated CodePush label like v4. If you'd like to display a complete version string, you can call codePush.getCurrentPackage() to get the currently running script version and append it to your native version, to get a version number like 0.0.1-v4. You can also run code-push deployment history from a terminal to see all of the versions you have released.\nIn future, we can work on auto-detecting when you are attempting to release a native code change and prevent you from doing so, as in #252.\nIf I understand correctly, CodePush should also mitigate this situation by detect this crash and rolling back the update for the next time the app is started. If you restart the app after this crash, do you see it running the original version again?\nDoes this explanation help you resolve the issue?\n. Hey @asadsahi, just to double-check again, are you updating your config.xml between CodePush releases? Because that should not be done, as it represents the binary interface of your app.\nThe reason I'm asking is because CodePush versions are labels like v1, v2, v3, etc, whereas binary versions are semver strings like 0.0.1, 0.0.2, etc. I don't know how you constructed your update dialog, but it is showing an upgrade to 0.0.2 - if your app is running binary version 0.0.1, it should not be upgrading to 0.0.2.\n. @asadsahi, did you still need help with this?\n. Okay no worries - thanks and good luck!\n. Hi @andrewwebber, sorry for the slow response. Just so that you're not left hanging, we're currently beyond swamped with all of the support requests, so it may be an extremely long time before we're able to get around to this. If anyone from the community would like to help out, we would love to accept any contributions you can make!\n. @andrewwebber - this is now available in react-native-code-push@1.15.0-beta. I'm going to close this for now, but please let me know if this solves it for you!\n. Hi @andrewwebber, we have a lot of confidence in the security of our product, but as an addition, code signing is being actively worked on and approaching completion! ETA is 1 week. I'll leave this open, but also link it to #233.\nThe current process I'm implementing is like this:\n1. Ensure dev has procured a { <privateKey>, <publicKey> } pair. Could be a .p12/.pem + .cer, or a KeyStore, or any number of things.\n2. Ensure the dev has the privateKey on their dev machine, and the publicKey baked natively into their app store release.\n3. When a release is made from the CLI, the directory contents are hashed. Basically: create a sorted array of key value pairs (one for each file in the release), of the format <relativeFilePath>: <SHA256Hash>. Stringify this array and hash that to get a single directoryHash.\n4. Construct a JSON Web Token, with the claim contentHash: <directoryHash>. Sign it using RS256 with the developer's private key from the CLI locally on their machine.\n5. Write the JWT to a file called .codepushrelease at the root of the package, before it is released to the CodePush server.\n6. When the mobile app receives an update, the CodePush SDK will look for the .codepushrelease file, read the JWT out of it, verify it against the configured public key, and then hash the contents of the update and verify it against the hash on the JWT. The update will only be installed if this verification is successful.\nLet me know if you have any thoughts or criticisms on this! I'm also looking for ideas on how to achieve (1) and (2). For example, what does the configuration and release process look like? Should the same private key be used across your whole account, or per app, or per deployment? Should dev/staging builds be signed, maybe with a common debug key?\n. Hey @andrewwebber, I'm sorry I completely missed your response! I've noted your point about extensibility - the current PR I have up at the moment covers just the basics, but leaves plenty of room in the future to add more features.\nFor now, we are not using certificates, just raw public/private keys. I'm not sure if there is any point in having a certificate hierarchy, but feel free to let me know if you have other thoughts!\n. Just to keep everyone in the loop - we were close to finishing the implementation of this, but we've run into some small difficulties with the verification process on iOS. The intention to complete this is there, but we're currently extremely back-logged, so this may be shelved for a month or two while we work through other more pressing issues. Thanks so much for your patience here!\n. @axemclion - By the way, I soloed this feature for a while, so it might be good to go over the design together at some point just to make sure that it makes sense. Linking this to #307, #233 \n. Closing this for now but may re-open later when work on this feature is resumed.. @dsernst - Yes, @sergey-akhalkov has picked up this feature and is working on it.\nSergey, there are work-in-progress PR's on the Service, CLI and RN SDK that may reduce the work you need to do. Let me know if you'd like me to walk you through it sometime.\nAlso, @iageoghe - did you have a design doc you were going to show Sergey?. Hey @Leblaaanc, I suspect you're on an older CLI, could you upgrade to the latest? I think all of the documentation will make sense at that point. I'm so sorry about the confusion!\n. Hey @LeBlaaanc, the documentation only covers the latest version of the CLI - could you upgrade and then try again? ttl was added in v1.12.0-beta. I'm so sorry about the confusion!\n. Hi @ziggyJ, my apologies for the slow response. Are you still encountering this issue? If so, do you mind closing this issue and re-filing it on the CodePush Cordova repo? https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push\n. Hi @atsepkov, that's bizarre - I'm unable to repro this, and haven't gotten any other reports. Does this still happen for you?\nAs a workaround in the meantime, the page that you want to go to is:\nhttps://codepush-management.azurewebsites.net/auth/register?hostname=<your-machine-name-here>\n. Thanks heaps for filing this issue and providing this information, it is very useful. There is definitely something strange here, as I can't repro it (admittedly I am on El Capitan, maybe it's the OS?).\nAs you are unblocked for now, I'm going to close this issue, but if anyone else runs into this I would love it if you could add on to the thread here to help us get it diagnosed!\n. Hi @weixingsun, do you mind emailing us to let us know the email address associated with your account? This is very strange and we'll have to look into it. codepush@microsoft.com\n. Hi @weixingsun, I did some testing, and I think what might have actually happened is that in the line Enter your access key:, the wrong key was entered. When I did this, I reproduced the exact symptoms that you saw. If you log out and then log in again, and follow all of the prompts from your browser, are you able to get it working?\nWe haven't seen this specific issue before, so there are a few blind spots here that we could improve. Either way, I'll leave this issue open to track:\n1. Validating that the access key entered is correct\n2. Displaying a better error message than Not Found\n. Thanks @SoHotSoup! @weixingsun, were you able to resolve your issue?\nIn the meantime, I've fixed the error messages on the server for future people running into this issue, and they should go live within two days.\n. I have fixed the following issues:\n1. Validating that the access key entered is correct\n2. Displaying a better error message than Not Found\nPlease let us know if you still run into problems!\n. Hi @overminder, thank you for contacting us about this. Supporting higher loads is just a matter of scaling resources for us - we can indeed support 2000 RPS, ideally with advanced notice. Before we do this though, I'd just like to make sure that this requirement is what is actually needed - what kind of app are you developing, and why do you expect 2000 requests per second (as opposed to 2000 users distributed over a time period)? Are you expecting app downloads to occur during this peak period (i.e. 2000 concurrent blob downloads)?\nWe can support this, but as a side note if it helps as far as reassurance, even in the worst case scenario that a server outage happens, there should be no user-facing error in your app (assuming silent mode). It would simply mean that no update is detected/applied until the next successful update check.\nIf there is any part of the details that you want to keep private, or if you'd still like to perform your own load testing, you are also welcome to respond via email at codepush@microsoft.com.\n. Closing this issue as we communicated via email and the event proceeded without issue :) For anyone else with similar RPS requirements, please contact us!\n. Apologies for the slow response! This seems to be a duplicate of #330, so I will close this one and resolve the other one. Do you have a preference for linking to the Play store or the iTunes store? We will show the link to the Play store in the meantime.\n. My sincere apologies for the slow response! We added your logo to our showcase last week. I hope you're enjoying CodePush!\n. Hi @kinglionsoft, I'm so sorry about this. We rolled out a CDN (at https://codepushupdates.azureedge.net) to improve performance for all of our users, but we had not accounted for the fact that some of our users use a whitelist.\nWe have deployed a change to the server to revert this - you should see this within an hour from now. The CDN URL will now only get sent if we detect a newer SDK version than the ones currently released, and we will update the docs before we release a new SDK version.\nPlease let me know if this solved the issue for you, and if there's anything else we can do.\n. @bsy I'm closing this because I think #382 will address what you want and also allow you to control the output directory :). Could you try logging out and then in again? This kind of behavior is possible if the login key was pasted incorrectly when logging in (we will work on improving the error message).\nIf that doesn't work, could you email codepush@microsoft.com with your registered email address?\n. @nirajbrn, are you still seeing this? In the mean-time, I've fixed our error messages, so hopefully you won't see that specific error again.\n. Hi @joomi, do you mind closing this issue and filing it on the CodePush Cordova repo? https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push\n. @Ranatchai - that's very unusual, and I'd like to get to the bottom of this. Could you try again one last time, and if it still fails, could you email us at codepush@microsoft.com with the following details?\n- Your deployment key\n- Approximate date/time that it failed for you\n- Anything you're willing to share with us about your upload (e.g. your source, or the .jsbundle, or the final .zip)\n- Your approximate geographical location (e.g. Australia, or Taiwan)\nI'll personally look through the server logs and/or try to reproduce it for you.\n. @opula - I'm unable to reproduce this. Do you mind emailing us the same information?\n. Thank you!! I will verify this in a few days, and if so, I'll try to improve the error message on releases when your session has expired.\n@opula - thanks so much for the email. I will get to it in a few days (we are tremendously back-logged), but in the meantime, could you verify if this is the same issue that you faced? (if you run code-push deployment ls, and it succeeds, and then when you run code-push release-cordova, it fails, then it's a different problem)\n. Linking:\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/issues/326\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/issues/328\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/issues/169\n. Hi! Please see #326 - your session has likely expired and you need to log out and log in again.\nPlease let me know if this worked for you. I'll keep this issue open until we make the CLI release that will give a clearer error message.\n. We have released a new version of the CLI that fixes the error message. Please let me know if you still run into issues!\n. I will address this early next week probably, unless this is needed urgently, in which case please let me know!\n. This is now live on the service. I'm closing this issue - please close the one on the react-native repo (Microsoft/react-native-code-push#546) if you think it's resolved!\n. My sincere apologies for the slow response! We added your logo to our showcase last week. I hope you're enjoying CodePush!\n. @panarasi Two reasons I think:\n\nWe run react-native out of the node modules directory, I assume so that versioning is consistent.\nIt's important that we verify that the release command is being run from the root of the project.\n\nBut it's possible that both of those are moot points. Only two people have mentioned this though, so it's up to you if you think it's worth the effort.. The server expects a number from 1-100. Is it possible that the value of this.percentage is 1 here, instead of 100?\n. I can't seem to reproduce this :( here is what I did:\ncode-push release-react a android --rollout 99\n// From node:\ncodePush.patchRelease(\"a\", \"Staging\", undefined, { rollout: 100 }).done();\nI checked the deployment history between each command and it was as expected. Does it reproduce for you if you replace all of the variables in your example above with literals?\nNote that the CLI just calls into the same management SDK: https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/blob/master/cli/script/command-executor.ts#L1090\n. Thanks, please keep me updated!\n. Ahh, that makes sense. Glad we could figure it out!\n. @daniel-beard - that's interesting, we never thought anyone would need more than that. How far back do you need to see? Is it just because you're managing several binary versions in the same deployment (how many, if you don't mind me asking)?\n. Ahh, I think I understand. We're extremely back-logged at the moment, but I would love to squeeze these two requests in. I'll try my best, but no promises!\n. It's a bit of both... Do you have any thoughts on how we should implement pagination? We could just send the full payload from the server, and then do UI-only pagination in the CLI, although I'm wondering what the perf of that would be\n. So I'd really like to do this, but the back-end change seems non-trivial :( The issue is that even with 50 releases, we're starting to hit ~70kb per deployment, so to support more releases per deployment (e.g. 1000), we'd need to be clever with how we store it in the storage layer itself, so as not to disrupt the performance for other users whenever somebody retrieves theirs. But we definitely have this issue in mind, it's just we currently don't have the resources to tackle it!\n. @panarasi We can certainly move it into our backlog. It's not unfeasible by any means, we'd just have to think everything through. I don't think our current backend changes would change how this feature is implemented, but it would be good to have a discussion and bounce ideas off people.. Hey @sergey-akhalkov, I'm not sure if that is a good idea (not saying it's not, just that I'm not sure), because our current deployment history blobs are already ~70kb with 50 releases. With 1000 releases, they'd be over 1MB each, and I don't know what the performance of that will be, and if it'll affect other users. But I'm open-minded though!\nJust brainstorming here about other approaches too:\n1. Make the history more 'lightweight' like @daniel-beard says, and then have special operations for fetching the rest of the data. For example, I think most of the size would be coming from the download URL's and diff package map - run code-push deployment history <app> <deployment> --format json to see what the server is sending (ignore the metrics, as that is a separate sever route that the CLI is stitching together)\n2. 'Compress' the data, for example by storing the URL's more compactly. Possibly we don't need to store the prefix (https://codepush.blob.core.windows.net/). Don't know how much space that would save.\n3. Implement pagination at the storage layer. This is probably the 'correct' option. One approach would be to create a new blob every time the current blob hits 50 releases. Then, when retrieving the history, fetch the last two blobs in order to piece together the most recent 50 releases.\nI would lean towards (2) or (3), but other ideas are welcome too! We need to be careful about any changes that we make here though - a lot of the information like the diff package map and download URL's are being consumed by the acquisition server, which can hit thousands of RPS.\nTagging @iageoghe @panarasi @maxim-pop in case they have any other ideas!. This is a dupe of #267 - I will tag you in that issue and close this one! There is definitely interest in doing this, it's just a matter of having enough resources.\n. Thanks @archr!\n. Is it possibly a permissions issue on the directory specified here? If you copy that folder to your home directory and chmod 644 it, will it then work?\n. Ah - my apologies, I think the release function expects the folder to be zipped up, and the path to the zip to be specified. If you zip it up, does that help?\nIf you're curious, here is what the CLI does on release: https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/blob/master/cli/script/command-executor.ts#L1100\nAnd on release-react, which ends up calling release: https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/blob/master/cli/script/command-executor.ts#L1263\nThis logic could definitely be refactored into the management SDK, currently it's an extremely thin layer.\n. Gotcha. Will keep this in mind moving forward, although in the short-term we're unlikely to have the time to implement this ourselves (although community contributions are always welcome!)\n. @daniel-beard Thanks so much for your great contribution! This has been published in code-push@1.11.0-beta. Closing this now, but feel free to come back if you need anything else!\n. Hi @JAStanton, what would be the best way to expose them for you? (Published with the package, Typings/DefinitelyTyped, etc.)\nAlthough we'd love to address this at some point, we're currently extremely strapped on resources, so a PR would be the fastest way to get this in. I can see that our repo currently auto-generates the types when building and puts them in definitions/generated/code-push.d.ts, so I'm guessing this would involve modifying the gulp scripts to automatically place it in cli/bin and sdk/bin. Or if you'd like a short-term fix, you could just build the repo and copy definitions/generated/code-push.d.ts into your project :)\n. Hi @sergey-akhalkov, here are my thoughts:\n\nIt makes sense to publish the definitions with the npm package.\nI'm not too sure myself whether it is better to implement code-push.d.ts manually compared to fixing the auto-generation script, but I trust your judgment here so if you think that's the better approach then I support it. Keep in mind there is both a management SDK and an acquisition SDK, so you'll need to make sure the definitions work for both.\nIf you'd like to postpone it, that makes sense, given that not many people have requested it and there's a workaround.. @MrWillow @frontweb - although we ask that you upload your whole www directory with each release, the server performs file-based diffing, so only updated and new files are sent to client devices. In other words, we don't think you should have to perform the task of manually specifying which tasks to update as that has been automated on the server. Does this make sense?. You need to upload that file from the CLI to server regardless (or it will be deleted), but that file will not be sent from the server to your app if the app already has it. Hopefully I explained that well?. Published in code-push@1.11.1-beta\n. Hi @SoHotSoup, would one of the following two options help solve your current situation?\nThe --noDuplicateReleaseError flag in the CLI, which converts it from an error into a warning.\nThe latest management SDK, which indeed has error codes\n. @dijonkitchen thanks for the PR! These gh-pages are actually generated files from another repo we have elsewhere, but we will be sure to update it with your changes! I'm going to leave this open until we do.\n. Apologies for the slow turnaround! We've mirrored these changes onto the website repo, they will be published in a few days :). Hi @dudeinthemirror, is there anything special about your app? We have never seen this error before.\n\nThe CodePush CLI runs the React Native CLI to bundle your app for you. If you run the following command, do you still see the out of memory error?\nreact-native bundle --assets-dest /var/folders/6x/tkn340tx2fb47p4yy1x1bl7r0000gn/T/CodePush --bundle-output /var/folders/6x/tkn340tx2fb47p4yy1x1bl7r0000gn/T/CodePush/main.jsbundle --dev false --entry-file index.ios.js --platform ios\nIf so, then you may want to file a bug on the React Native CLI. If this is the case, we can also follow up on our end to make sure the CodePush release doesn't get reported as successful when this happens.. Hi, can you show us the full contents of android/app/build.gradle? \nI can maybe compare it against https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/Examples/CodePushDemoApp/android/app/build.gradle. @aravind12345 - yes, the bundle is stored on the CodePush server and distributed via a CDN. The latency will depend on where in the world you are located and where our CDN nodes are - from the US we expect it to be 100 ms or less. I'm not sure what you mean when you say a million requests - we have easily served many millions of requests, but what time interval are we talking about here? How many daily/monthly active users do you have, or alternatively what is your peak requests per second?\nFor example, we have reached 2K RPS before and can likely scale further, it is a matter of understanding what your needs are. Also, keep in mind that in the unlikely event that we are unable to support a load, there should be no perceivable effect on your app, as the HTTP error response will be silently swallowed.. Hi @aravind12345, @maxim-pop and I have discussed this and we're comfortable supporting this load, we'll just need to scale out beforehand for extra safety. Before we do this, could you email us at codepush@microsoft.com with some more details:\n\nWhat is your company or app?\nWhen do you intend to start?. Hi @aravind12345, we have not heard back from you. Did you still have this RPS requirement?. Okay no worries! Clearly we are able to handle the load, and our monitoring shows no issues. Feel free to contact us if you have any other scalability concerns.. Hey @bmwertman, could you contact codepush@microsoft.com and send us the email associated with your account? . @bmwertman - Apologies, there is a lot on my plate at the moment, I will try my best to update you within a day :). I believe @sergey-akhalkov is investigating this!. Great work @sergey-akhalkov :) Seeing as this has not happened before this period, I'm wondering if something about Microsoft accounts changed (e.g. email addresses became optional, or some new way of generating accounts with no email was created). If possible, could you try to implement a fix on the service that does not throw an exception, and displays a more user friendly error message?. This shouldn't be difficult to do - maybe we could ask one of the vendors to do it if the feature is well-specced?. I'm assuming you're referring to the CodePush CLI as opposed to the management SDK. In that case, I think you can do the following:\n\nnpm install --save-dev code-push-cli\nnode node_modules/code-push-cli/script/cli.js\nIs this what you're looking for?. I believe your question was addressed in #291 - closing for now, but feel free to ask additional questions!. Tagging @panarasi as this may be an interesting point (Cordova-specific). @weivea - All communications with the server are done via https, which should prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Closing this for now but please let me know if you have a more specific question!. Thanks so much for filing an issue! In answer to your questions:\n\nIt is not normal to have that many rollbacks.\nTo debug rollbacks, we generally recommend you have some kind of separate analytics or crashes solution installed (e.g. Mobile Center). We are working on a tighter integration there. CodePush will tell you how many of your releases were successful, but not why they failed (e.g. the update has an immediate crash in it). To be clear, a rollback only ever happens because notifyAppReady() or sync() (only one of these is required) was not called in the first run of your app. Is .sync() being called immediately and always on deviceReady()?\nWhen rollbacks happen, the offending release is 'black-listed' so that it won't be installed again. However, the next release to be published will still be attempted.\n\nDo you need any further help? And please let us know if you do manage to get to the bottom of this.. Seeing as Max will be out for a few days, I've made my desired changes directly on the branch. @buptkang - could you please review the final result?. When you say reverts, do you mean it downloads the update that is on the CodePush server and reverts to that, or do you mean it loads an existing old update from disk?. Great! We would like to release/tag that ASAP, along with a few other fixes - we will be testing everything first, but if you could also let us know from your personal testing if it resolves your issue that would also be tremendously helpful.. Thank you!. @aslakagens, the fix should be merged tomorrow or the day after.. We will publish this on npm the same day that RN 0.43 exits RC.. @abhisheksoni27 - our gh-pages are auto-generated, so merging this won't help as they'll be overwritten. I'll leave this PR open so that we can port that change to our source repo though!. @max-mironov great catch! yes, please remove this dependency completely.. Oh, @max-mironov - the xcode dependency also uses node-uuid, so the warning will still show up even after my PR is merged. You might need to look at that separately.. @max-mironov - gotcha! Thanks for looking into that. So I guess we've done all we can on our end.. @BJGDEV closing this issue as unactionable, please file another issue with clear reproduction steps if you still need help.. From the CLI, please run the following command to get the download URL's for each release:\ncode-push deployment history <app> <deployment> --format json\nDoes this solve your question?. I noticed that the 'if' in the collapsed section above still has 'Login the old way' as a case. I think we can just remove it, seeing as all of the keys will be migrated?\n. How about shortening to:\nIf you want to log out of your current session, but still be able to reuse the same key for future logins, run the following command:\n. Can we not specify  here? The convention for these flags is that if they exist, they change something, and if they don't, it's the default behavior\n. Can we remove the word 'still' here?\n. Ah I see, you were matching what was there before. I say yes for sure, the convention in CLI's (e.g. git) is definitely that you don't need to specify 'true' or 'false'.\nIf you don't mind, could you also update the README?\n. That's fine for when it's in tabular format and I have to iterate through it again anyway, but I still want to show it in reverse order when I stringify it for the JSON view. I could reverse it in one case and not the other, but this is just more tidy. It's running on the client anyway so the tiny perf hit won't really matter too much.\n. I think I agree actually. I've changed it back.\n. Agree - missed a spot :)\n. Good catch, pushed the fix to master.\n. Is this interface synchronized with the server? Would it be worth adding this to rest-definitions?\n. He has AcquisitionStatus exported above, which is equivalent to an enum (minus type-checking I guess, but for the REST API interface at least I feel like readable string constants are a better choice than TypeScript enums, which are integer constants).\nWe could make this function private, and then introduce public reportSuccess() and reportFailure() functions that call this internally?\n. I might be wrong, but as long as the semver version is bumped appropriately I think he can change these methods how he pleases, because the SDK version referenced by the client plugins is fixed.\n. This sets the user-agent to be code-push-cli/<CLI-version>, whereas the default SDK user agent is code-push/<SDK-version>. I think it's useful to distinguish the CLI as a distinct user agent, especially when the SDK will be consumed externally. But, I can also see the simplicity benefit of having user-agent strings being defined only by the SDK version, so feel free to discuss if you think that should be the case!\n. (Open for discussion)\nWould it be worth pre-fetching this on the server side to save the round trip? On the server side, you could just call the function that retrieves the metrics directly, and then move the code that merges the results below from the CLI into the server.\nIf you do this, you could also potentially remove the 'metrics' route from the server entirely, and use the 'history' route both for this command and the one below, at least for now. This might be more controversial though.\n. (Open for discussion) - As with below, would it be worth moving this code onto the server-side to save the round trip?\n. I feel like the format of the metric key is an implementation detail that should be hidden away on the server - I'm just conscious that this is not the most friendly format as we get other consumers of the SDK. Could we move this parsing onto the server side, and then just return objects that have .active, .downloaded, etc fields, which can in turn be documented in rest-definitions.d.ts? Note we'd likely have to do this anyway if we added this information to the deployment history route.\nSorry to be such a hassle :(\n. Seeing as we now have this information, would it be worth displaying the binary app versions in the history as well? I'm not strongly opinionated on this point though, I'm mainly concerned with the round-tripping.\n. Or another option is we could move this parsing into the SDK so that consumers of the SDK don't need to care. This makes it less friendly to interact with the API directly, but it means less processing on the server. However, if we added this to the deployment history route, we'd likely need to do the parsing on the server-side anyway. I'd still lean towards server, but you might have different ideas on the trade-offs (if you agree with me on this point in the first place that is).\n. I think 'targeting' is the correct spelling, I had to google it just to be sure!\n. Could we make this appTransfer for consistency and clarity?\n. Could you rename/sort this as well for consistency?\n. I like the idea of using it for everything, but what do you think?\nThe only tricky thing is with my version of the TS compiler, it doesn't seem to like it when you use template strings with ES6 style import statements.\n. Yes, although it might be good to do it on a non-breaking branch, as this one won't go in for a while.\n. Ehhhh, I can just do it here I guess\nEdit: Checked it into a branch that merged into master, then merging it back in here\n. Weird. That wasn't compiling before but it does now (which makes sense). Changed it to the more logical option here\n. Whether to display who performed each release?\n. This is actually really inconsistent if you look at all of the other commands, I'm not sure what we should go with\n. Verify that error messages are unchanged - as we are resolving names on the server, an invalid name will result in an error coming from the server rather than the CLI.\n. I will address this in a different review - For now, I expect to move the access-key generation onto the server.\n. I will need to add this as part of a server change - currently we just get:\n[Error]  Not Found\n. Oh!! Boy am I glad to hear that. I was feeling like this language feature was badly designed, but what you just explained makes perfect sense.\n. Thanks for catching this, big oversight on my part there.\n. Change this default to https://codepush-management.azurewebsites.net to reflect the splitting off of a new management server from the old acquisition server.\n. Other requested SDK improvements, such as making AccountManager the default export, and renaming all instances of 'Package' to 'Update', will be addressed in a subsequent PR.\n. Need to address the fact that people with older ConnectionInfo files sitting on disk may still authenticate to the old acquisition server instead of the new management one, even with an upgraded CLI.\n- I will address this in a subsequent PR.\n. I think it's too late, because if we do that then we have the opposite problem where some people still have configuration files with \"accessKey\" as the property, which we then need to special case for backwards compatibility :P\n(These two interfaces have always existed before the 'breaking' changes, all I've done is renamed them and tidied them a bunch so that deserializeConnectionInfo() is the only function that knows about the old one)\n. I think the rule should be that you fix whatever you touch, so I've gone ahead and converted the relevant strings, including this one!\n. Nice! This is much cleaner.\n. I feel like this breaks consistency and type annotation, e.g. this interface is referred to in lines 457 and 559 of command-executor.ts. What do you think?\n. I don't think I can remove this case, as we still need to construct the command with the right enum value here.\n. Do we need to do this validation on the client-side if we have server-side validation already?\n. I don't think we need to optimize the performance in error cases like this. More importantly, I think client-side validation comes with a maintenance cost, as well as the cost of having less flexibility to change things on the server (which we've already run into a few times).\nI agree with having a friendlier error message, and ideally that would be generated on the server, but I understand if it's too much work to do it as part of this PR.\n. Yeah I think so, I'll go ahead and change that\n. programmatically\n. Promise\n. Could we move this try to right before spawnSync?\n. I think it's intended for the synchronous part of this function. Could we move this catch to right after readFileSync()?\n. I think you meant IReleaseBaseCommand right?\n. kinda nittish, but can we make these consistently double-quotes?\n. I think the double quotes should be moved:\nwas added with \"cordova platform add ${platform}\"\n. Could we move this catch to immediately after readFileSync()?\n. The XMLParsing function returns a promise (wrapped by Q.denodeify), so I would expect a parse failure to result in a rejected promise, not a thrown exception.\n. Because I removed '/r/n' from initiateExternalAuthenticationAsync(), which is used by link\n. Could we maybe remove and if so, with which account,?\n. Thanks so much for contributing this!! Could we make this environment variable upper-case (HTTP_PROXY) to match our internal convention?\n. Just to make sure we run cleanly if the proxy is not set, could we change these three instances to have this on another line:\nif (proxy) (<any>request).proxy(proxy);\n. For consistency with the other methods in the SDK, could we change this to ensureAuthenticated(), and return a void promise that resolves if authenticated, and rejects if not? Then the CLI doesn't need to construct an error object, and any external users of the SDK might also find this function useful.\n. You might be able to just use this.get() like the other methods here\n. I think we still need this, to prevent the require() from causing a crash if this is used in a browser, right?\n. I don't think this promise will ever finish, because resolve/reject is never called. I think if you just remove this enclosing promise (leaving return sdk.isAuthenticated()... below), it'll work perfectly though!\n. This seems to only be used internally within the SDK (after your changes the CLI no longer needs it). I'm wondering if we could just move this interface into management-sdk.ts and rename it to something like PackageFile? We do have a few legacy naming inconsistencies as you can see :)\n. Okay, it's possible this has gotten out of date. In that case I'm fine with this just being removed, and then we can patch it up later for the browser when/if it's ever needed!\n. Just touching up the English here -\nUsing the same app for iOS and Android may cause installation exceptions because the CodePush update package produced for iOS will have different content from the update produced for Android.. Small suggested modifications:\n- If left unspecified, the assets\n- will be copied\n- to the /tmp/CodePush folder\n- Could you put back-ticks around the directory path?. I think we still want max to be one here. We have an undocumented argument that can be used for testing, eg:\ncode-push login http://localhost:3000. Same as for login command, I think max should be one because we have an undocumented option used for testing. Same as for login/link commands. While you're at it, could you please leave a (short) comment explaining that, here and in the other places?. Could you update the README.md in the CLI directory also?. Can you update the log(\"Successfully ... line below to mention the label that was promoted (only if it was specified by the user)?. Slight tweak to expression:\n\nThis optional parameter allows you to pick the specified label from the source deployment and promote it to the destination deployment. If unspecified, the latest release on the source deployment will be promoted.. Could you rename the env variable to CODE_PUSH_NODE_ARGS to avoid any conflicts?. It's okay, GitHub can squash it for you :). Would it make sense to move this check directly to the release command, which is called behind the scenes by code-push release, code-push release-react and code-push release-cordova?. You can just return sdk.getApps() ... directly instead of wrapping in a promise, as these methods return a promise. Below, you can remove the if (app) branch, because if nothing is returned, the promise resolves as success, and instead of reject(error), do throw new Error(...) which rejects the promise and matches what we are doing elsewhere.. I don't think we need this line, as it's taken for granted that we will check the app name (all of the other commands effectively do the same but don't log this step unless there is an error).. You can actually call sdk.getApp(<name>) directly, there is no need to do this filtering logic on the client side as it is already being done on the server. And the promise will already be rejected for you with the appropriate error message if it does not exist. Actually, given this, you could maybe remove this function completely, and just call sdk.getApp(<name>) within the release command, with a comment explaining why. Oh, if you do this I guess you won't be able to return a list of candidate apps on failure, but note that none of the other commands return a list when they fail. Actually thinking about it more, it might make even more sense to call sdk.getDeployment(<appName>, <deploymentName>), with a comment explaining why, because this way the server will validate both the app and deployment and return the appropriate error message.. You don't need to add this catch here. A .catch() basically catches a rejected promise, so that subsequent .then() clauses can execute. However, if you throw within a promise callback as you are doing here, the exception is caught by the promise library (q) and wrapped in a rejected promise again. So, this is effectively a no-op.\n\nNote that this function (releaseCordova) returns a promise, which is the final output after each .then() executes. It is okay for the returned promise to be rejected, and in fact we recommend that for error handling. Note that rejected promises should end up here, where the error will be logged.. Ah - good point!. Both the --build and --isReleaseBuildType flags need to be alphabetically ordered above. Both the Build and IsReleaseBuildType sections need to be alphabetically ordered above. We normally name the flags that we pass through to the underlying react-native or cordova CLI's the same as they would be in the original CLI. This generally makes them more discoverable/consistent for people who already have been using the underlying CLI. I understand why it might have made sense to name it otherwise, but with all things considered do you think it makes sense to just call the flag release instead of isReleaseBuildType? (I'll leave this up to you).. Okay sure - just wanted to make sure that was considered, but sounds like you have :). ",

Hi, xhacker5000.\nI'm trying to repro this.  How large was your main.jsbundle file when the release failed with \"Internal Server Error\"?  Can you estimate how long it took between executing the release command and the failure occurring?\nThanks,\nDamon\n. That's the curious part, the version --- as long as it is semver compliant --- should not matter.  1.0.1 should release just fine even if there isn't a preceding 1.0.0 release.\nHere's a little test I just did with a brand new app:\ncode-push app add MyApp\nSuccessfully added the \"MyApp\" app, along with the following default deployments:\n[deployment keys omitted]\ncode-push release MyApp main.jsbundle 1.0.1 --deploymentName \"Staging\" --description \"first deployment\" --mandatory true\nUpload progress:[==================================================] 100% 0.0s\nSuccessfully released an update containing the \"main.jsbundle\" file to the \"Staging\" deployment of the \"MyApp\" app.\n. Hey, xhacker5000.\nWhen you hit the \"internal server error\" are you behind a proxy server, like at work?\nThanks,\nDamon\n. Apologies for the inconvenience.\nWe were hitting a Node.js default connection timeout of 2 minutes.  Uploading a large file over a slow network connection could hit this timeout.\nI have increased the timeout.  Also, the server should now return an HTTP 408 (request timeout) instead of a 500 (internal server error) in case of a timeout.\nCan you please try again and let me know the result?\nThanks,\nDamon\n. Looks good.\n. Hi, rajeevkannav.\nAccording to that callstack this line of code is failing for you:\nvar configFilePath = path.join(process.env.LOCALAPPDATA || process.env.HOME, \".code-push.config\");\nIt looks like the HOME environment variable is not exported on that machine.  The CodePush CLI needs another option or fallback in this case.  In the meantime, can you try setting the HOME environment variable to see if that works?\n. You said that a PHP app is executing code-push release headerlabs path/www 0.0.1 -d Staging and failing, right?  How does the PHP app launch the CodePush CLI?\n. putenv(...) allows you to set environment variables for child processes.  Per documentation note that putenv(...) won't work if safe mode is enabled and safe_mode_allowed_env_vars is not empty.  Otherwise, I think you could do something like this before calling your exec(...):\nputenv(\"HOME=/Users/rajeevkannav\")\nThe path must exist and be writable by the CodePush CLI process.\n. That's good progress.\nThe CodePush CLI keeps a configuration file containing your access key so the CLI does not need to ask for your access key every time you invoke a command.  On OS X, the configuration file is typically located at:\n$HOME/.code-push.config\nWhen I am logged in on my Mac $HOME evaluates to /Users/dtivel, so the configuration file would be located at:\n/Users/dtivel/.code-push.config\nThis file is created when you register or log in.  When you run the code-push login command interactively, the CLI creates this file.  It exists on the machine where you successfully ran your code-push release command in Terminal.  If you run the following in the same Terminal window you should see the file:\nls $HOME/.code-push.config\nThe path that you provide in your putenv(...) call needs to contain a .code-push.config file.  Since your PHP app isn't logging in on its own, one option is to copy the .code-push.config file from one directory to the other.  Another option is to change the putenv(...) path to point to your directory where the .code-push.config file already exists.\n. What is the return value of putenv(...)?\n. ~~After the putenv(...) call can you do an exec(...) to print out the value of $HOME?~~\nPlease disregard.\n. I think that the PHP app doesn't have read access to the file.  Let's verify this.\nAfter the putenv(...) call can you call exec(\"ls -l $HOME/.code-push.config\") and share the result?\n. How about:\nexec(\"ls -l /root/.code-push.config\")\n. Was that the return value or the command output?  According to exec documentation you have to pass an output argument to capture the full output.  I didn't add the output argument above.\nI don't want to get lost in the weeds here.  I'm by no means a PHP expert.  Ultimately, your PHP app needs to be able to access the configuration file.  The above commands (like ls -l) attempt to check the file's existence and accessibility.  Can you verify access on your own?\nIf I run a CLI command like code-push release when the .code-push.config file does not exist or is not readable (say, due to permissions) then I get that error:\n[Error] You are not currently logged in. Run the 'code-push login' command to authenticate with the CodePush server.\n. Can you check the contents of .code-push.config and verify that it's valid JSON?\nDo not post the contents here.\n. In the .code-push.config file is an access key.  Can you copy it and put it in an PHP exec(...) call like this and share the result?  (Don't share the access key.)\nexec(\"code-push login --accessKey <accessKey>\")\nFor example, assuming my access key is abc I'd write:\nexec(\"code-push login --accessKey abc\")\n. Is this still an issue?  If it is, can you please post the CLI output from the above command?  (You may need to modify the exec(...) call above to capture CLI output.)\n. Hi, dkokic.\nCan you tell me the special characters you used?\n. Thanks for the info.  Let me take a look.\n. I believe it's a bug that plus signs are allowed in names.  I've created a task for fixing this on the server.\n@dkokic, if you have any other entities (apps, deployments, etc.) which have a plus sign in them, please let me know; we can help rename them.  I'm sorry for the inconvenience.\nAre you blocked for your presentation tomorrow?  Please let me know, and I can help unblock you.\n. @poshaughnessy, I've updated the home page with your suggestion.  Thank you for the feedback.  Keep it coming!\n. @poshaughnessy, I wasn't able to reproduce this behavior myself.  Via HockeyApp I installed an app running version 1.3.0.  I then published an update via CodePush for version 1.3.1.  The app did not see the update, as expected.\nAs @lostintangent mentioned, CodePush doesn't (intentionally) apply partial updates, and as long as the version you specified when you released the update wasn't a range that included your app's binary version, I cannot see why you would be getting a partial update.\nCan you still reproduce this behavior?  If yes, could you please send detailed repro steps?\n. @kkgelu, I investigated this and reproduced the behavior with react-native@0.22.2, react-native-maps@0.3.1 and react-native-code-push@ 1.10.0-beta.\nThe issue is that assets loaded from a CodePush update are referenced with a file:// URI, but react-native-maps doesn't support file:// URI's.  A simple fix this would be add || uri.startsWith(\"file://\") as a condition in this line.\n. @kkgelu, the change has been merged into lelandrichardson/react-native-maps.\n. Looks good.\n. I'm taking a look at this now.\n. I reproduced your issue.\nYep, you are right.  Using the --targetBinaryVersion allows you to specify the app version yourself, thereby bypassing the build.gradle parsing code.  I'll send out a pull request to improve the error handling in the CodePush CLI.\n. Is update v2 the latest update for the deployment?\nIs the binary version of your app 1.5.0?\n. Good news that upgrading to v1.7.1-beta resolved the update not being installed.\nA mandatory update with the IMMEDIATE option should restart the app once the update is installed.  I'll investigate and get back to you.\n. This is awesome.  Thank you for taking the time to contribute this.\n. Looks good.\n. removeLocalAccessKey\n- done\n. notifyAlreadyLoggedIn\n- done\n.

This would be better off named clearDeploymentHistory.\n. In general the commands should indicate that deployment history is being cleared, not the deployment itself (e.g.:  IDeploymentHistoryClearCommand)\n. No, I don't think they are semantically equivalent.\nA CodePush deployment is an update channel (or \"environment\").  It has its own descriptors and relationships.\nAs of this change, deployment history is an erasable log of updates released to that channel.\nA deployment can have zero to many associated updates.  In other words, a deployment can have deployment history or no deployment history at all, such as after clearing deployment history.  However, clearing deployment history does not change the deployment itself (its existence, its name, its deployment key, etc.).  The channel is still there and usable but waiting for a new release.\nThis feature erases deployment history.\n\n\nThe deployment is essentially just a history of releases\n\n\nI think that's a bit of an oversimplification, and at a high-level you may be right.\n.

    "pke": "Server code coming next?\n. Cool. Nice feature would be binary diff'ed updates from newest to all older versions. Like store apps are updated internally.\n. removing the plugin solved the issue for now. We will see on the other dev machines how they behave.\n. Thanks. How do we use semver with the code push versions then? Is there a way to specify a label ourself in semver format?\nSo the target version should be updated if anything native, like plugins or Cordova engine has changed?\n. thanks for the infos. I wonder why nobody requested a label/version feature so far. We'd like to use the short git commit id as the label. So how does code-push determine which version is newer than the installed one on the device? From the label or some other data like the push date?\nAbout the version bump in config.xml. Maybe we should mention this in the docs for cordova CLI functions at some place.\nOne more thing: Why did the cordova app think it needs an update when I first deployed it with the code-push sync code in it? Is it cause there was no downloaded version on the device? How can I prevent that from happening in production? I want to deploy the first app version to the store that contains the sync code. I assume I do not need to push that exact version to code-push then? Only if I make the first changes diverging from the store published version I'd initate the first code-push release?\nA couple of more technical questions if I may:\n1. Does the code-push code download over metered connections?\n2. Does the code-push server deliver binary diffed zip files? It would cut down minor code updates tremendously\n. The label thing is not a blocker, no. I can for now put this information into the description field. \n~~Is there an easy way to read that information about the current active metadata to display it in a version dialog?~~ Yes there is: https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/docs/cordova.html#codepushgetcurrentpackage\n\nYep we do. As long as you release the same app code to CodePush that you shipped with the binary, our server will generate diffs will subsequent releases, and users will only get the new and/or changed files.\n\nThen I'll have to check that again, cause the console output in the app always mentioned it downloaded 5MB for every of the several byte big changes.\n\"packageSize\":5913252\nedit: from the docs \n\npackageSize: The size of the code contained within the update, in bytes.\n\nSo the actual downloaded size I can only get with a progress callback?\n. Thanks for updating the docs. There is one \"w\" too much in \"wwww\" though ;)\n. and if you don't do PR for someone else to look over it ;)\n. It needs to work across machines, so the SHA should be saved on the codepush servers.\n. We also need to figure out a workflow for when using git flow. In it, you basically create a release branch that is then merged into master. From master the several versions are built.\nOf course to create the next release we have to npm version patch/minor/major the release branch. This also should update the config.xml version attribute to be always in sync with the package.json version entry. I have a script to do that\n``` es6\nconst path = require(\"path\")\nconst ConfigParser = require(\"cordova-common\").ConfigParser\nconst configFile = path.join(process.cwd(), \"config.xml.template\")\nconsole.info(configFile)\nconst config = new ConfigParser(configFile)\nconfig.setVersion(process.env.npm_package_version)\nconfig.write()\n```\nDoing a codepush release now would not update previous target binaries because the default deployment is to the version specified in config.xml. We would need a smart way (for codepush) to check which config.xml in the previous releases are also update-able.\nFor that we'd need to know which changes (except for the version attribute) would rule out a codepush of a previous target binary.\n1. App name change\n2. App preference change (?)\n3. Plugin version change (that needs to check agains the real installed plugins not the spec in config.xml)\n4. Anything else?\nThen, if we have detected which versions can be selected for an update we specify those for the deployment as target binary versions oldestPossibleVersion-currentVersion.\nThe default description should probably contain the githash.\n. Thanks for the feedback. Hmmm it's unfortunate the cordova plugin does not plug this message by default. Changes to the info.plist cannot be checked in and will be lost after any cordova engine update. So changing it there does not seem very safe to me.\n. Thank you @lostintangent I'll try the aformentioned plugin.\n\nWe could investigate solving it somehow from our plugin, but I'm not sure if we can in a clean way.\nLets better not start another \"Microsoft fixes vendor bugs\" that worked so \"well\" in Windows by putting all the hard work in Microsofts hands and letting the vendor get away with bugs and awkward API usage.\nYou could however mention this problem and its solution in the FAQ, I think.\n. hmmm using the config plugin does not seem to solve the issue. So it must be something in the cordova geolocation plugin.\n. I was using both geolocation.getCurrentPosition and watchPosition right after each other wihthout waiting any of them to finish.\nI guess this caused a race condition to display 2 dialogs sometimes and the second dialog did not get the correct string translations for some reason unknown to me.\n\nSince I changed my code to only call geolocation.watchPosition the correct dialog is displayed (with my customized messages even).\nSo I'll close for now, its nothing you and your team can actually solve. I will open an issue with the Cordova plugin to let them check why this code caused such problems.\n. Yes I did. Its nice to give the user some additional information about why you want to access her location.\n. well it adds to the overal app launch delay, and I aim to keep it as short as possible (with webpack codesplitting)\n. Thanks. No need to hurry with the NPM release though.\n. case insensitive handling would also be a nice addition to this feature request.\n. Is this being worked on? Just had to create a new app and rename all the deployments by hand for iOS and Android.\n. Is there any way this could be contributed by the community? Guess it isn't since the server is still closed source?\nAs a workaround until this is fixed in the server I could imagine hacking it into the CLI like in this pseudo-code:\nes6\nfunction addApp(name, deploymentsNames) {\n  return request.addApp(name)\n  .then(app => {\n    let promise = deploymentNames.reduce((promise, deploymentName) => {\n      return promise.then(app => {\n        if (app has deploymentName in different case) \n          return app.renameDeployment(oldName, deploymentName)\n        else\n          return app.addDeployment(deploymentName)\n      })\n    })}, Promise.resolve(app))\n    return promise\n  })\n}\n. That is handling react native not cordova. But I'll give it a view and see if it could work with cordova.. The option for custom lables should be:\n--label default\n--label git\n--label \"My custom label\"\n| value | description |\n| --- | --- |\n| default/legacy | (codepush manages the incremental vXX label |\n| git | the current branch commit id |\n| my custom label | A user provided label |\nI'd love to provide a PR but the source does not seem to be public.\n. It's not the client side I am talking about (hence why I posted the issue not not cordova-plugin-code-push).\nAllow me to describe my current scenario: Our internal dashboard shows various metrics already. I'd like to add the deployment proliferation of our various white-label apps in that dashboard too.\nAt the moment I am using the SDKs getDeploymentMetrics in a 5 minute interval for each of our apps and deployment names (staging, production). But if course that is inefficient. Most of the time it returns the same data over several minutes or hours even.\nSo I thought you could implement, on the server, a Push-Service like URL with a long running open HTTP connection (see PubNub) or a websocket so that the code-push server could inform this channel (http connection or websocket) about deployment metrics updates. Since the server gets this information any time an app gets updated/rolled back it could either send the updated metrics right away or aggregate some and send them later.\nThat way we would not have to pull the information from the server, which is less ressource intensive on our side and your severs would also be less hammered by metric requests.\nOn the SDK client side I could be exposed as on(\"metricsupdated\", (deployment)\n. I think the same data code-push deployment ls prints out. That would be UpdateMetrics, wouldn't it?\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/blob/master/definitions/rest-definitions.d.ts#L89\n. @heat no, a pipe is not a webhook. I'd like the code-push server notify me about metric changes, not me polling them in any way (no pipe, no curl). Or I misunderstood you\n. Too bad. Polling is very 2000 and network load unfriendly..

An interesting thing about electron is that it runs JavaScript both on the host and client side of the application. This is contrary to React Native which of course runs Java / ObjectiveC code on Android, iOS respectively.\n. I agree, I played with this a little bit and would much prefer to have CodePush there instead. The caveat is being able to push code for both renderer (web browser) and main (node.js). Both would require restarting the app after restart.\n. \n",

Rolling my own may not as big of a deal as I do not have to account for all update scenarios that, say, code-push supports, but utilizing services like code-push is preferred route.\nFor idea solution, I am leaning towards storing metadata with each release and checking metadata during version check. It can be implemented as extension to existing flow, e.g. extra data on releasing and hooks for mobile part. Such solution will also help with upgrade major versions, e.g. I am releasing v1.1.234 and code in v1.0.123 may suggest user to update full app, essentially helping me to speed up roll out of upgrades.\n. @lostintangent Yes, I am using RN and checking hash during update should solve my issue with the first run\n.

Let us look at implementing this. . @iageoghe Can you work with @sergey-akhalkov on the spec for this please ? . @vineyyadav Thanks for\u00a0the feature idea. Currently, we are looking to\u00a0move\u00a0Code-Push into Visual Studio Mobile\u00a0Center. Once in Mobile Center, we plan to support different ways to install code-push updates based on segments.\u00a0\nAs you mentioned in the\u00a0issue, the workaround for now could be wrapping\u00a0codepush.sync() in your own function.\nI am closing this issue since we do not plan to\u00a0implement\u00a0it\u00a0right now, but will\u00a0look at it again as a\u00a0part of the larger Mobile Center story.\nLet us know if you have any more questions, thanks. \n. As you may have heard, CodePush\u00a0will soon be a part of Visual Studio Mobile Center. Mobile Center has a\u00a0feature for\u00a0continuous builds,\u00a0and\u00a0we plan to build in such a feature\u00a0on Mobile Center soon. \nClosing this bug in its current form, as we do not plan to\u00a0make\u00a0this a part of the CodePush CLI. Once we have the\u00a0git\u00a0logic in Mobile Center, we\u00a0could opensource that tool. . Once Code Push is merged into\u00a0Mobile Center, it is\u00a0easier to create deployments in the UI.\u00a0Hence, closing this issue. If you still think that\u00a0it makes sense to add this\u00a0functionality in CodePush, please do let us know. . @sergey-akhalkov Can\u00a0we investigate to see how this can be\u00a0implemented please ? . For nightly builds,\u00a0you could check out\u00a0Mobile Center's build process. Here is a video I did about continuous builds\u00a0and\u00a0Code Push - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfqZ8Uy2p3U\n. @pke Thanks a lot for the feature request. At this point, we do not plan to\u00a0implement a WebHook. CodePush will expose the deployment\u00a0metrics as a\u00a0rest API, and we would recommend polling as a way to get the\u00a0information. . This would be a great\u00a0feature to implement, and if\u00a0someone on the community can send in a\u00a0PR, we would gladly accept it. I am closing this issue\u00a0for now, since our\u00a0team does not plan to implement it.\nIf someone in the community is planning\u00a0to work\u00a0on this, please\u00a0comment on the issue, and I can reopen it. . @silhouettes Is there a reason we need to even look for this ? We could simply call react-native bundle and if\u00a0react-native exists, regardless, we could publish it. . @silhouettes With the changes to our backend, would this be possible ? Can\u00a0we move this to our backlog and see if we can fix this ? . Awesome, lets keep this issue open then, and see how we can implement it. Thanks. Thanks. Closing the issue. . ",
    "sergey-akhalkov": "@panarasi, got it, I'll investigate and implement this just after code/bundle signing feature investigation.. Hi @silhouettes, @iageoghe.\nI've investigated ways we could implement this feature, so please have a look at the following workflow mock up:\n\nPreconditions: developer releases new 1.2.0 version of the app in the app store that includes \"Rollback to the binary version\" feature. Then developer performs code-push release-react <appName> <platform> command and wants to rollback v1 release to the binary version. There are end users that have old 1.0.0 version of CodePush SDK in their apps and new one that includes \"Rollback to the binary version\" feature, so we need to support backwards compatibility. \nDeveloper performs the code-push rollback <appName> <deploymentName> command.\nCodePush server performs the check if prior releases exists and in case there are no prior releases, CodePush server will create a new release for the deployment that includes the exact same code as the release having label v1 (we need it to support backwards compatibility for the apps are using old 1.0.0 version of CodePush SDK. I suppose it make sense due to developer could use targetBinaryVersion parameter while releasing CodePush update) and updated metadata.  Metadata will be the same as for the release having label v1 except the one flag: shouldRunBinaryVersion: true. \nDeveloper performs the code-push deployment history <appName> <deploymentName>.\nThe new v2 release record created by CodePush server will be shown in deployment history like this: \n\nLabel  | Release Time | App Version | Mandatory  | Description\n-------| ---------------|---------------|--------------|-------------\nv1 | 30 minutes ago | 1.2.0 | NO | Initial release\nv2 | 2 minute ago (Rolled back v1 to the binary version) | 1.2.0 | NO\nTo show Rolled back v1 to the binary version message we need to create new shouldRunBinaryVersion column here in  the CodePush server.\n4. Developer performs code-push rollback <appName> <deploymentName> command again (probably by mistake and I think we should handle this situation). CodePush server performs the check if prior releases exists again and it could see, that v2 release has shouldRunBinaryVersion: true flag, so the CodePush CLI will print user following message: [Error]  Cannot perform rollback because there are no prior releases to rollback to.\n5. Old version 1.0.0 of the developer's app will install v2 release (in case developer has used targetBinaryVersion parameter) that has exact same code as the release having label v1 (please let me know if you have any ideas how we could avoid such installations for old 1.0.0 version of the developer's app)\nNew version 1.2.0 of the developer's app will look at shouldRunBinaryVersion flag (we could add it here) and in case it has true value, CodePush SDK will perform updates clean up just like here. . Hi @iageoghe, \n\nWould an automatic rollback create a new \"v2\" release for everyone?\n\nCurrently there is no logic that creates new release in case an automatic rollback occurs for some users and we could implement such approach. But I can see some issues with this approach:\n1. In case we have 100 users and 99 of users have successfully installed an updated - we could have a situation when last user has an automatic rollback. It means that new \"v2\" release will be created and all 100 users will be reverted to the binary version.\n2. We also probably have security issue - some user could manually trigger an automatic rollback - it means that all other users (who have successfully installed last update) will be roll backed to the previous version.\n\nwhat if the user with the automatic rollback was the only user whose v1 update auto-rolled back\n\nCurrently each device memorize if it has tried to install an update, but with no luck - so next time when device will try to check for updates - it will ignore the update that triggers a rollback for this device.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or see any issues.. Hi @joshuapinter, this feature looks difficult and I'm afraid if it even not possible to implement it, please let me explain why and let me know if I'm wrong - one or all of the variables in the \"${versionMajor}.${versionMinor}.${versionPatch}\" string can represent some calculations that developer implemented to compute the values of those variables, so without execution of gradle script we cannot be sure what the final value of those variables in the versionName string. \nThe only way to release a CodePush update is to specify --targetBinaryVersion parameter as described above. \nPlease let me know if you have any questions or see any issues.. @cxy200927099, you are using the latest version of code-push, if you want to update it, you could run npm install -g code-push-cli@latest command.\n\nI also have the same problem, but i do not use cordova-plugin-code-push; how can i fix this problem?\n\nCould you please create new issue and provide us with more details (current binary version of your app, deployment history - code-push deployment history <appName> <deploymentName>, version of react-native-code-push, repro steps)?. Closing this due to #394 has been merged, please feel free to reopen if needed.. @panarasi, I've investigated the way we could implement this feature in the similar issue, so could you please look at investigation results here: https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/375#issuecomment-280572789?\n\n@panarasi, I've investigated the ways we could implement this and I suppose we could use the same approach and just implement another one property (called customMetadata as example) that users would be able to use instead of description.\nI also think it would be convenient to implement 2 ways users would be able to specify customMetadata - as plain value or as a path to some .json file like this:\ncode-push release-react myapp ios --customUpdateMetadata=\"myvalue\"\ncode-push release-react myapp ios --customUpdateMetadata=./mymetadata.json\nWhat do you think?. Hi @iageoghe, got it, will do.. Hi @iageoghe, we've scheduled this with @pniko and this item will be implemented in order of priority, please let me know if you have any considerations or see any issues.. @ruslan-bikkinin, after implementing \"support for brownfield apps\" feature I believe we should start implementing this enhancement, please sync up with @pniko and confirm.\n\nRegarding this feature details: I suggest to reserve the props that begin with underscores. For example, we could use such kind of props for the following purposes for example: \n1. _gitRef - store the reference to the commit (repo state) that has been used to generate js bundle file. This feature could help developers to determine what version of their code has been used for js bundle generation and fix issues.\n2. _reactNativeVersion - may be helpful to determine what version of react-native is used for js bundle generation. We could warn the developer in case we have mismatch between versions of RN for 2 CodePush updates - the old one (that has been generated by an older version of RN) and new one that developer wants to release (that update is generated by the new version of RN). That mismatch may cause a lot of issues, so I believe that we should try to figure out how we could prevent it before developer released an update. \nRelated issue https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/15271. Closing this for now, please feel free to reopen if you see any issues.. @axemclion, got it, will do!. Hey guys, Code Signing feature has been released! \nSo I'm closing this issue, please feel free to create new one in case of any questions or issues..

Regarding https://codepush.blob.core.windows.net and https://codepushupdates.azureedge.net - code-push-services location is West US, so you can download Microsoft Azure Datacenter IP Ranges and add IP addresses from <Region Name=\"uswest\">\nPlease see this article  for more details and let me know if you have any questions.. Hi @iageoghe, I've published PR https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/pull/475, so I'm closing this for now, please feel free to reopen and let me know if you have any questions or see any issues.. Hi @silhouettes, do I get it right that CodePush server uses MAX_PACKAGE_HISTORY_LENGTH constant to keep only last 50 packages per deployment? I think we could prompt user that deployment history has reached 50 packages and that next CodePush release will override first release by new one. To keep all history user will need to perform code-push deployment maxHistoryLength 1000 command to save maxHistoryLength value in the CodePush server database's table and use this value further to show full deployment history. \nIn a nutshell - MAX_PACKAGE_HISTORY_LENGTH constant will be overwritten by specified by user value (that value will be stored in some database table). In case user does not specified maxHistoryLength property CodePush server will use MAX_PACKAGE_HISTORY_LENGTH = 50 constant by default.\nSeems like this approach won't affect users who need not full deployment history feature, please let me know if I'm wrong or if you have any other thoughts.. Hi @silhouettes, I've created new issue https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push-service/issues/521 to continue discussion there if needed.. @orlando, @patrickomeara, please let me know if I could help you or if the issue was resolved.. @orlando, got it, thank you, I'll update docs to make this more clear.. Closing this due to #405 has been merged.. Closing this due to fix #360 has been merged, please feel free to reopen if you see any issues or have any questions.. @axemclion, got it, I'll investigate this.. Hey @axemclion, @silhouettes, @iageoghe, I've investigated this and I believe we should publish our declarations bundle file with npm package (just like react-native-code-push does it) due to we control the npm package we are publishing declarations for. That way, our declarations and JavaScript always travel together. (Please take a look at this article to get more info). Does it make sense?\nThe problem I've faced with is that generated code-push.d.ts bundle has bad concatenation. Another words, to make it possible to use Package interface we shroud do the following:\nimport { Package } from \"code-push/script/acquisition-sdk\"; instead of import { Package } from \"code-push\"; due to code-push.d.ts bundle has this lines of code: \nTypeScript\ndeclare module 'code-push/script/acquisition-sdk' {\n    export interface Package {\n    ...\n    }\n...\n}\nSo, should we probably try to fix code-push.d.ts bundle structure (by removing declare module 'code-push/script/acquisition-sdk' wrappers) or just implement  code-push.d.ts manually just like react-native-code-push.d.ts? I'm in favor of implementing code-push.d.ts manually, because it should take the less time than gulp tasks and dts-generator library investigation and fixing the issue by using them. Please let me know if you have any ideas.\nAs for me, I believe we should postpone this feature for now and take a focus on Support Brownfield React Native apps feature due to it has high priority.. Hi @silhouettes, got it, we'll postpone it for now and implement code-push.d.ts manually later, thank you!. Closing this, please feel free to reopen if needed.. @dudeinthemirror, are you still experiencing the issue? Please let us know if you need any help.. Hi @bollogo, got it, thank you for the clarification and let me know if you have any questions or see any issues.. @ms88privat, the website docs has been updated, thanks! Also in the future we'll probably have an automatic synchronization between the website and GitHub docs: https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/pull/681. @emitchel - hi! Seems like question about JS bundle location is similar to https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/672 \nTo determine JS bundle location you could use:\n...\nconst { SourceCode } = require('NativeModules');\n...\n<Text style={styles.messages}>{SourceCode.scriptURL}</Text>\n...\nAlso I've implemented isUsingReactNativeBundle helper method in https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/pull/673\n\nOk then another question is when I have an app with version 1.0, and I've rolled out v1-3 code-pushes to it, then I update the app to version 1.1, do I need to rollout the latest code to staging again for it to pick up correctly?\n\nCould you please clarify the question? If I understood it correctly, you need not to rollout the latest code to staging again. Due to this docs https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/tree/master/cli#target-binary-version-parameter CodePush watches on current binary version of the app to decide if update should be applied or not. Please let me know if you have any questions.. Closing this, feel free to reopen it if needed.. @adbl - hi!\nI've reproduced provided use case and got following deployment history:\n\nAccording to getUpdateMetadata method output \n\nserver does not convert optional release v3 to mandatory in case optional release belongs to another App Version.\nTo make sure if isMandatory property is really represents managed by CodePush server value I've created following deployment history:\n\nand got following getUpdateMetadata method output:\n. @ThisIsMissEm, I've recently implemented --outputDir=PATH parameter https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/pull/382 that allows to specify folder PATH where assets, js bundle and sourcemap files will be written. Please let me know if it works for you.\n . @ThisIsMissEm, just a friendly ping.. @ThisIsMissEm, thank you, closing this for now, please feel free to reopen if needed.. @jsappme, are you still not able to log in? Could you please look at Internal Server Error in developer tools and check console log if it contains any details (exception message or probably stack trace)? Also it would be helpful if you could tell me your version of code-push-cli (just execute code-push -v command).\nJust to clarify, what is the reason you tried to re-login (probably session expires or another machine is used to login)?. @bmwertman, could you please execute code-push -v command to let me know what version of code-push-cli is in use? Also it would be helpful if you could share us with \"Internal Server Error\" details - is there something else beside error message (probably console log output)?. Yes, I'm working on it, will let you know if I have any results.. Seems like there is something wrong with CodePush app permissions or with Microsoft account, because while investigating CodePush management server logs I've found, that there are exceptions with the following content:\njson\nCouldn't get an email address from the microsoft OAuth provider for user\n{\"id\":\"somevalue\",\"displayName\":null,\"name\":{\"familyName\":null,\"givenName\":null},\"emails\":[],\"photos\":[{\"value\":\"https://apis.live.net/v5.0/somevalue/picture\"}],\"provider\":\"windowslive\",\"_raw\":\"{\\r \\\"id\\\": \\\"somevalue\\\", \\r \\\"name\\\": null, \\r \\\"first_name\\\": null, \\r \\\"last_name\\\": null, \\r \\\"gender\\\": null, \\r \\\"emails\\\": {\\r \\\"preferred\\\": null, \\r \\\"account\\\": null, \\r \\\"personal\\\": null, \\r \\\"business\\\": null\\r }, \\r \\\"locale\\\": null\\r}\",\"_json\":{\"id\":\"somevalue\",\"name\":null,\"first_name\":null,\"last_name\":null,\"gender\":null,\"emails\":{\"preferred\":null,\"account\":null,\"personal\":null,\"business\":null},\"locale\":null}}\nAs for me I've got following:\njson\n{\"id\":\"160a122831b082b8\",\"displayName\":\"Sergey Akhalkov\",\"name\":{\"familyName\":\"Akhalkov\",\"givenName\":\"Sergey\"},\"emails\":[{\"value\":\"v-seakha@microsoft.com\",\"type\":\"account\",\"primary\":true}],\"photos\":[{\"value\":\"https://apis.live.net/v5.0/160a122831b082b8/picture\"}],\"provider\":\"windowslive\",\"_raw\":\"{\\r   \\\"id\\\": \\\"160a122831b082b8\\\", \\r   \\\"name\\\": \\\"Sergey Akhalkov\\\", \\r   \\\"first_name\\\": \\\"Sergey\\\", \\r   \\\"last_name\\\": \\\"Akhalkov\\\", \\r   \\\"gender\\\": null, \\r   \\\"emails\\\": {\\r      \\\"preferred\\\": \\\"v-seakha@microsoft.com\\\", \\r      \\\"account\\\": \\\"v-seakha@microsoft.com\\\", \\r      \\\"personal\\\": null, \\r      \\\"business\\\": null\\r   }, \\r   \\\"locale\\\": \\\"en_US\\\"\\r}\",\"_json\":{\"id\":\"160a122831b082b8\",\"name\":\"Sergey Akhalkov\",\"first_name\":\"Sergey\",\"last_name\":\"Akhalkov\",\"gender\":null,\"emails\":{\"preferred\":\"v-seakha@microsoft.com\",\"account\":\"v-seakha@microsoft.com\",\"personal\":null,\"business\":null},\"locale\":\"en_US\"}}\nIt is really weird that user object has no values for properties except id property. So the Internal Server Error occurs due to \"emails\": [] array is empty.\nSo guys, could you please make sure you basic MS account information is filled (it helped to resolve the issue for @samuelplaymore) and also make sure that there are correct permissions (\"Sign in automatically\" and \"Access your email address\") for the codepush-management.azurewebsites.net app?\nPlease let me know if any changes.. @samuelplaymore, great, thanks for the response! . @silhouettes, got it, will do!. Closing this for now due to CodePush server has been updated to show the instruction that describes how to avoid the issue (basic info of Microsoft account should be filled).. @alexdunae - hi, thank you!\nThis issue was fixed in https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/releases/tag/v1.12.6-beta, so you need just to run [sudo] npm install code-push-cli@latest -g command to upgrade your code-push version. . Closing this due to https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/pull/382 has been merged.. @fungilation,  sorry for the inconvenience, you probably have faced with out of date docs on codepush.tools website, for now it should be fixed (I could see fresh version of Supported React Native platforms table) \n\nNote that 0.40 breaks backward compatibility in linking\n\nWe've fixed this in 1.17.0 version of react-native-code-push, please let me know if you see any issues or have any questions.. @pepmanbrad, just a friendly ping.. @scopsy, could you please look at https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/issues/196?\nYou probably have the same issue.

Closing this for now, please feel free to reopen if needed.. @slorber, please let us know if we could help you or if the issue has been resolved.. Fixed it, thanks!. Hi @cooperka, thank you for reaching us. No need to create new issue, there is a script that should sync up docs from github with CodePush site, so I'll ping guys who can help us with this.\n\nThis also seems to clobber the entire directory, it deleted everything previously under ios when outputting there. Maybe a warning about this would be nice\n\nGot it, should we add a note to the docs that will pay attention on such behavior?. @cooperka, I've just published https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/pull/467, please let me know if it looks good to you.. @gillesBzk, are you using Homebrew's version of the node? Could you please try to remove prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/node/0.12.2_1/libexec/npm line from /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/npmrc file, then reinstall code-push-cli and verify if it works for you?. @gillesBzk, seems like you have faced this issue: https://gist.github.com/DanHerbert/9520689\nTo make global packages usable you should probably do following:  \n\nThe final step is to add ~/.npm-packages/bin to your PATH so npm and global npm packages are usable. To do this, add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile:\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/.npm-packages/bin:$PATH\"\nNow you can re-install any global npm packages you need without any problems.\n\nPlease let me know if it helps.. @gillesBzk, could you please try to re-install node as described in https://gist.github.com/DanHerbert/9520689?\n. @jr-k, from official documentation: \n\nIf your app targets both iOS and Android, we highly recommend creating separate apps with CodePush.\n...\ncode-push app add MyApp-Android\ncode-push app add MyApp-iOS\n...\nNOTE: Using the same app for iOS and Android may cause installation exceptions because the CodePush update package produced for iOS will have different content from the update produced for Android.\n\nFor more details please look at App Management chapter\nLet me know if you have any questions or see any issues.. @jr-k, no problem, closing the issue, feel free to reopen if needed.. @adriano-di-giovanni, thanks for the question.\ncordova prepare command produces update contents that used by CodePush and stored in myapp/platforms/android/assets/www folder.

Closing this for now due to new one issue was created: https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/issues/393 \nPlease feel free to reopen if needed.. @adriano-di-giovanni, could you please look at App Management and Deployment Management chapters and let me know if it helps?. @adriano-di-giovanni, sorry for slow response. \n\nI'd like to know if best practices emerged in managing environments.\n\nI'd like to recommend you to use following workflow:\n1. Debug - development. Code push is not being used here.\n2. Stage - stable version for testing. Changes are pushed here from the Debug version.\n3. Production - what customers run. Promote tested CodePush updates from Staging to Production.\nUsing this approach you have not to override deployment key from config.xml, you just could build 3 apps with different deployment keys are stored in config.xml file.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.. @adriano-di-giovanni, just a friendly ping.. @adriano-di-giovanni, thank you for response, closing this for now, please feel free to reopen if needed.. @adriano-di-giovanni, sorry for slow response.\nI don't sure if it is mandatory to deploy cordova-platform-specific files, but I suppose it was designed this way to make preparing update contents and installing an CodePush update package processes easier. Such approach is suitable for most users and helps to avoid possible issues that may have place due to files  in the myapp/www folder are prepared and stored in to myapp/platforms/%platform%/assets/www folder by Cordova in a different ways both for Android and iOS. @adriano-di-giovanni, I have to clarify, saying \n\nI don't sure if it is mandatory to deploy cordova-platform-specific files\n\nI meant that deployment process for Cordova could be probably designed without using cordova-platform-specific files, then I've supposed why cordova-platform-specific files are used in deployment process for now.\nYou've got this error: \n\nFail to load resource\nfile:///data/data/it.spaghettiinteractive.scopapiu/files/codepush/deploy/ve\u2026083c910281714c305ef93a1ab612fb3c24b6596e728e41080a6ee36256c/www/cordova.js\n\ndue to this logic: https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/blob/master/bin/www/localPackage.js#L40 . After update installation your assets are in LocalPackage.VersionsDir + \"/\" + this.packageHash location. So your index.html file referencing to cordova.js could not find it due to cordova.js file was not deployed. \nFor now I could see no simple and reliable solution allows to avoid deploying cordova-platform-specific files and I don't sure if it should be implemented due to it may cause unexpected issues.\nI also believe it is convenient to have all client-side files together due to this approach allows users to make hot fixes for plugins js files without releasing new version of the app. This would be helpful for users having plugins implemented themselves.\n\ncould lead to inconsistencies\n\nCould you please clarify what kind of inconsistencies you are talking about?\n\nforces my team mates to have cordova and the cordova project on their machine just to deploy an update with code-push\n\nAs workaround you could share content of myapp/platforms/%platform%/assets/www folder, so your team mates would have ability to release updates using vanilla code-push release command, but this approach is unsafe due to you have to control differences between you version of myapp/platforms/%platform%/assets/www folder and version of this folder that having your team mates.\n\nincreases the size of the deployment\n\nI could see that my cordova-platform-specific files takes about ~300 KB for sample app (cordova.js and cordova_plugins.js files, cordova-js-src/ and plugins/ folders). Also note that cordova.js file is not contained in each update package due to diffing logic on CodePush server, only files that have been modified will present in CodePush update package and downloaded by the app.\n. @adriano-di-giovanni, just a friendly ping.. >Say I perform a cordova platform update and I forget to update project version in config.xml. A code-push deploy will update cordova.js, leading to an inconsistency between native cordova version and it's javascript counterpart.\nAgreed, the inconsistency could be here, so we just have to keep it in mind.\n\nAs you said, this approach is unsafe. Versioning could make it safer. IMHO that's another drawback of including cordova-platform-specific files in a deployment.\n\nWe can't use myapp/www folder for deployment due to its content may be changed by cordova prepare command. So such changed files are locate in myapp/platforms/android/assets/www folder and used by the app and by CodePush for deployment process. We also not able to use myapp/www folder for releasing CodePush updates due to Cordova Merges feature. So you probably have to install and use Cordova to prepare CodePush updates. Or you just could use provided workaround.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions, thank you!\n. Closing this for now, please feel free to reopen if needed..

Fixed it, thanks!. @RichardLindhout, thanks for reporting the issue! \nHere is the PR fixing it: https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/pull/735, hoping the PR will be  merged soon.. Closing this due to https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/pull/735 has been merged. Please feel free to reopen if needed.. We've released new version of React Native Module for CodePush: react-native-code-push@2.0.1-beta (it's available via npm), please let me know if you see any issues or have any questions.. Hi @wbrickner, I believe it is not a bug due to you've terminated execution process and it is expected that some temporary files are not cleaned up. So, I don't sure if it is the use case for most of the users, but if you want, you could try to implement this feature (and publish PR) using interrupt signal SIGINT.. Hi @wilomgfx, thanks for reaching us. As of now, it is not possible to use CodePush with Electron due to both CodePush SDK's (React Native module for CodePush and Cordova plugin for CodePush) are using native-side code (Java and Objective-C) to handle platform (Android and iOS) specific operations such as download update, unzip archive, copy/delete files and etc. To make things work, it is probably needed to implement CodePush SDK using JS or try to adapt Java module to use it further with Electron.\nI have not heard any plans regarding to support Electron (we probably need to discuss it), as of now, we are   working on other high priory tasks such us \"Code signing\" and \"Support brownfield React Native apps\" features.. Hi @wilomgfx, thanks for the clarification. It's hard to say for me what actually went wrong here, due to we have not faced with such kind of CodePush using specific scenarios before. Is it possible if you have the same problem as here? I could probably try to help you if you provide me with your webpack configuration.. @wilomgfx, got it, I'll quickly look at it and let you know if I'll find out the root cause of the issue. Please also let me know if you'll find out the way to resolve it.. Hi @wilomgfx, do you still experiencing the issue?. Hi @wilomgfx, got it, so I'm closing this for now, please let me know if any updates or feel free to reopen if needed.. Hi @aaronorosen, thanks for reaching us. \n\nIn this above case does it matter that a mandatory update was ever pushed out to begin with to this user since a non-mandatory update was pushed out after the user opened the app again ?\n\nI believe \"Mandatory parameter\" should answer this question. Please let me know if it does not clear for you.\n\nI'm also wondering about in the other cases where multiple updates are pushed out. When the user of the app opens the app I suppose they will only get the latest version of the app downloaded to their phone? Or does it download ever update and restart?\n\nThe users will get the latest version of the released CodePush updates that targets to appropriate binary version of the app.\n. Hi @thotegowda, thanks for reaching us, could you please take a look at https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/841 and verify if you have the same issue as there or not?. @thotegowda, got it, thanks for the clarification. I've not seen such kind of issue before, so could you please create new issue in react-native-code-push repo and fill as much info as possible? Also could you please try to reproduce the issue using our sample app/try to debug existing one from this point or share with us source code (minimal version of the app where the issue reproduces) if available?\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.. Hey @thotegowda, got it, thanks for the clarification, please let us know if you see any issues or have any questions.. Hello @afilp, thank you for reaching us. \nThe current workflow with single GitHub and single CodePush account fits for most of the users, so we've not heard such kind of requests before. Currently, we are extremely backlogged and working on other high requested features, but if you have time and ability you could try to publish PR that implements this functionality - we will be very grateful.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or see any issues.. Hi @stonexer, thanks for the contribution and sorry for the delayed reply. LGTM.. Hi @mliwski, thanks for reaching us, please take a look at https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/issues/374#issuecomment-278912156\nYou probably have the same issue, please double check if you basic MS Account info is filled and make sure if your permissions are correct.\nPlease let me know if any updates.. @mliwski, do I get it right if the You've successfully signed in your Microsoft account message is gone, and currently you are receiving 403 from CodePush?\nDid you tried to clear browser cache and cookies or just use another browser?. Hey guys, closing this issue, please feel free to reopen or create new one if needed. Please also let us know if you are experiencing any issues after CodePush upgrades.. Hi @scott108, thanks for filling the issue and sorry for the inconvenience - we've started investigation/fixing and we'll let you know if any updates.. HI @rahulrvp, thanks for reaching us, sorry for the inconvenience, the issue should be fully resolved now, please let us know if it happens again (just in case - try to logout/login if you'll see it again, but it should work now without any issues).. Hi @TheAdamizer, thanks for reaching us. I've tried to reproduce the issue but with no luck, do you still experiencing it?\nIf so, could you please try to login to mobile.azure.com using your CodePush account and import your <appName> as react-native windows, then verify if the issue still reproduces?\n. Hi @booker-laputa, thank you for reaching us. CodePush SDK is designed to use current app version to check for updates, so in case current app version does not match with remote package appVersion - CodePush SDK will show that there is no updates available.\nTo notify users that new binary version is available you could simply release new CodePush update for old app version that will contain notification. With this approach your users won't wait until CodePush update for new binary version will be released. \nPlease let me know if you have any questions.. @booker-laputa, if I get it right, you only need to make CodePush update for the old app version. That update will show \"new binary version available via app store\" notification, so users will be able to install it.\nThere is no need to make additional update for new binary version of your app - only in case it requires some fixes and improvements.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.. @booker-laputa, got it, please feel free to reopen if needed.. Hi @Z0mBee, thanks for reaching us and sorry for the inconvenience. I can confirm that I can also reproduce the issue, so we have started investigation and fixing. Will let you know if any updates.. Hi @BretJohnson, I've tried the following scenario:\n1. code-push logout\n2. change github primary email\n3. logout form github\n4. code-push login with github\nand everything works well! \nCurrently I'm searching for workarounds and let you know if any updates, but it seems like the issue is gone after migration - Mobile Center allows to login with github otherwise github primary email has been changed.. Hey guys, I've not found any workaround that could break login flow - I think that the only thing that could break it - is deleting github account, but I believe it is very uncommon case. We've discussed this use case with @pniko and believe that this has low priority and should be investigated later.\nSo closing this for now, we'll reopen it later if needed.. @cooperka, fixed, thank you!. Hey guys, thanks for reaching us and sorry for the inconvenience. I've just successfully logged in and seems like the issue is gone, do you still experiencing it? We'll try to figure out what goes wrong and let you know if any updates.\n. Hi @adambene, thanks for reaching us. I've seen that you've asked for this in Discord channel, has been your question resolved or do you need any help now? If I get it right - it would be convenient for you if apps table will also contain os and platform columns?. @adambene, got it, thanks for the clarification.. Hi @yaronlevi, thanks for reaching us. Yeah, that is know issue and I've mentioned it here https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/878#issuecomment-308695135\nI believe that we can close the issue due to it relates to https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/878\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or considerations.. So I'm closing this for now, please feel free to reopen if needed.. Hi @Webrusterkk, thanks for reaching us. Could you please take a look at https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/issues/257#issuecomment-309146483 and let me know if it helps?. @Webrusterkk, could you please try to login to Mobile Center using email that prints code-push whoami command and remove the app using portal UI? Please let me know if any changes.. @Webrusterkk, could you please clarify what do you mean by \"Hockey app name will be shown in code-push app ls\"?\ncode-push app ls command displays the list of the apps that have been created by code-push app add ... command or in Mobile Center Portal.. @Webrusterkk, is there a chance that you have been added as a collaborator for those apps? . @Webrusterkk, so, do I get it right if the issue is resolved now and you are able to delete those apps via Portal UI?. @Webrusterkk, could you please Open one of those apps in Mobile Center Portal -> Manage App -> Go to app settings -> Collaborators and share me with the list of collaborators? I believe you can see those apps because you are a collaborator for them.. @Webrusterkk, if I get it right from your previous messages:\n\nAre they my HockeyApps?\ni'm the collaborator for the apps in Hockeyapp\n\nyou are a collaborator/owner for Master-E.K-01 (Master E.K), Master-E.K-02 (Master E.K) apps, that is the reason why you can see them in CodePush CLI too.\nPlease let me know if you see any issues or have any questions.. Hi @Webrusterkk, sorry for the delayed response. Could you please provide us with the output of the following command code-push collaborator ls \"Master-E.K\" to make sure if you are collaborator if this app or not. In case you are collaborator you are not able to delete it. Please let me know if any updates.. @Webrusterkk, could you please try to perform code-push app rm \"Master-E.K-01\" command instead of code-push app rm \"Master-E.K-01 (Master E.K)\" and let me know if there any changes?. @Webrusterkk, got it, thank you, we'll try to figure out what goes wrong here and let you know if any updates.. @Webrusterkk, could you please try to remove your apps via Mobile Center Portal ones again and let me know if it works? We are trying to figure out if the issue is in code-push-cli or in code-push service itself. Thanks for the patience.. @Webrusterkk, please try to open one of those apps and try to take a look at browser url to determine what the app has been opened. As for me I have app with name rncp 210 release, but my url looks like: https://mobile.azure.com/users/sergey.akhalkov/apps/rncp210release/settings/details. As you can see the system app name is rncp210release and user friendly app name is  rncp 210 release.\nPlease let me know if it helps.. @Webrusterkk - could you please take a look at the following image:\n\nDo I get it right if there is no \"Delete App\" option?. @Webrusterkk, got it, thank you for the clarification. It looks weird, so I'll try to figure out what goes wrong here and let you know if any updates. Thanks for the patience.. Hi @Webrusterkk, I've found out that Mobile Center (and CodePush too) does not currently support apps deletion that have been migrated from HockeyApp, but we are working on it. As workaround, you could try to delete the apps via HockeyApp portal itself.\nAlso, we are going to change \"internal server error\" message to be more informative and user-friendly.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or see any issues.. @Webrusterkk, unfortunately, I don't think so, we only have code-push app ls command that has  no additional parameters, so it prints all available apps only. I'll try to figure out what we could do here and let you know if any news.\nUPD: Also I can see from output of code-push app ls command that you have provided in the issue body, that apps created by CodePush have Production/Staging deployments, but HockeyApp applications have no deployments.. Hi @Gavin-js, thanks for reaching us. Please use react-native-code-push repo to create new issue using this template.. Hi @CogCR, thanks for reaching us. \nCould you please clarify - are you trying to build your app via Mobile Center or on your local machine?\nAlso, have you seen this temporary workaround https://stackoverflow.com/a/46013326 ?. @CogCR, got it, please let me know if workaround helps. \nBy the way, I believe the issue does not relate to CodePush itself, so I'm closing this.\nPlease feel free to create new issue if you have any questions or see any issues.. Hi @newyankeecodeshop, thanks for reaching us.\nCould you please confirm if the issue you have is the same as here https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/issues/400#issuecomment-281279417 ?\nIf so, the behaviour you are experiencing is not the issue at all - it is how semver works. Probably we should add some notes about this in docs to avoid confusion in future.\nTo fix the issue you can patch your release targetBinaryVersion from 2.3 to 2.3.0\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.. >why doesn't the CodePush server convert 2.3 to 2.3.0 before passing the value to the semver logic? That is what your documentation says and also is a more appropriate behavior for CodePush, don't you think?\nCodePush server does not convert 2.3 to 2.3.0 because in case an customer really wants to publish an update that targets to 2.0 - he'll be unable to do that due to the server will convert it to 2.0.0, but customer wants to apply his update to 2.0.x, not to 2.0.0. \nThat is the reason why we shouldn't change current logic, otherwise it will produce unexpected behavior.\nTo avoid the issue we'll update Range Expression / Who gets the update table with new row: 1.2 := 1.2.x := >=1.2.0 <1.3.0\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.. >but the current behavior is less intuitive\nAgreed, but it's how the semver works and I believe we should not require from customer to publish 2.0.x instead of 2.0 because CodePush relates on semver and semver allows both variants.\nSo I'm closing the issue, please feel free to open or create new in case of any questions or issues. Thank you.. Hi @nionata, your logo was added, thanks for this!.

Hi @apolishch, please take a look at https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/991#issuecomment-328074153 - it might help you.. Hi @prayuditb, please take a look at https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/issues/547 and let's move the discussion to the one common place.. Hi @belal-mazlom, thanks for reaching us.\nPlease create new issue in react-native-code-push repo and fill out the issue template\nClosing this due to code-push repo isn't best place to work with react-native-code-push issues.. Hi @RoboTeddy, thanks for reaching us.\nYes, it probably would be helpful to document that only the 50 most recent releases in a deployment can be discovered and downloaded by clients, thank you!\nBy the way, you could avoid this limitation by creating new deployment and releasing new app binary version that will point to it.\npromote feature also could help you to manage your production deployment - it will contain only \"good and tested\" releases from staging.. Hi @adambene, closing this because \"custom metadata\" feature will be flexible enough to allow developers to store bundle version in their custom metadata. . Closing this, please feel free to reopen if needed.. Hi @PaperMonster, thanks for reporting the issue! I'm going to investigate it and let you know if I have any results or questions, thanks for the patience.. Hi @PaperMonster, could you please take a look at https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/pull/545 and let me know if it works for you or not? Also let me know if you see any issues or have any questions.. @PaperMonster, to test the fix you can follow these instructions:\n1. download changs from the #545 \n2. cd code-push\n3. gulp build\n4. cd cli/bin\n5. npm install\n6. code-push release-react myapp-ios ios --outputDir build --privateKeyPath ~/myapp-codepush-private.pem\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or see any issues.\n. @PaperMonster, thanks, good to know it works, going to publish an release at the end of this or in the beginning of the next week.. @max-mironov, @ruslan-bikkinin JFYI - going to fix the same in the https://github.com/Microsoft/appcenter-cli after approval from @PaperMonster that the issue is fixed w/ this PR. Hi @sospedra, thanks for reaching us! \nFirst of all, please make sure you have read mandatory-parameter article and js codepush options both for React Native and Cordova \n\ninstallMode (codePush.InstallMode) - Specifies when you would like to install optional updates (i.e. those that aren't marked as mandatory). Defaults to codePush.InstallMode.ON_NEXT_RESTART. Refer to the InstallMode enum reference for a description of the available options and what they do.\nmandatoryInstallMode (codePush.InstallMode) - Specifies when you would like to install updates which are marked as mandatory. Defaults to codePush.InstallMode.IMMEDIATE. Refer to the InstallMode enum reference for a description of the available options and what they do.\n\nAnother words, you can mark an update contains critical bugfix as mandatory so it will be installed on user devices immediately, without waiting for app resume or suspend, it depends on your configuration.\nPlease let me know if the provided info makes sense for you or if you have any questions.. Currently, we have the following plan: \n1. As you know, CodePush now is a part of AppCenter, it means that its backend is also moved to the common AppCenter backend.\n2. Due to the point above - Acquisition SDK will also point to the new AppCenter service which will be more reliable/flexible and should handle much more update requests per second, so finally 503 issue should gone away.\n3. The plan is to accomplish the changes above in the first decade of the upcoming year.\n4. So currently we are working on moving CodePush native SDKs to the AppCenter SDKs, it means that they'll be adapted to the new infrastructure, another words it will point to the new AppCenter API/Backend (exactly what I've talked above)\nPlease let me know if you have any questions regarding this.. @pitAlex, just a friendly ping.. Hi @pitAlex, please take a look at https://github.com/Microsoft/appcenter-cli/tree/master/src/commands/codepush/lib - you can reuse sign method from the update-contents-tasks folder for your own purposes.\nI'm closing this, please feel free to reopen if needed.. I've fixed it, thank you!. I think it would be better to put such validation before preparing update contents because it could save time - user have not to wait until cordova prepare or  react-native bundle  tasks finished.. Got it, thanks for the explanation!. @ruslan-bikkinin, why don't you just wrapped up the following code into the method and used it for deleting METADATA_FILE_NAME? I don't think if it's a good idea to use different versions of the code/implementations to achieve the same goals.\n``js\n             var prevSignatureExists = true;\n             try {\n                 fs.accessSync(signatureFilePath, fs.F_OK);\n             } catch (err) {\n                 if (err.code === \"ENOENT\") {\n                     prevSignatureExists = false;\n                 } else {\n                     return q.reject<string>(new Error(Could not delete previous release signature at ${signatureFilePath}.\n                         Please, check your access rights.`)\n                     );\n                 }\n             }\n         if (prevSignatureExists) {\n             console.log(`Deleting previous release signature at ${signatureFilePath}`);\n             rimraf.sync(signatureFilePath);\n         }\n\n``. I believe we need to wrap upJSON.parseinto thetry/catch`, just in case. (please see the same approach below https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/pull/533/files#diff-84f033a739bf58615844d4686a717544R337). Don't sure if it's a good idea to provide 3rd party URLs in our logs, would be better to provide a link to CodePush issue/comment on github if we really need it.. ",
    "iageoghe": "@sergey-akhalkov Would an automatic rollback create a new \"v2\" release for everyone? If so, what if the user with the automatic rollback was the only user whose v1 update auto-rolled back? \nIf the answer to the first question is \"yes\", for the installation where we have a v1 auto-rollback scenario could the client set the shouldRunBinaryVersion flag to true and reload?

Updated!. \ufeffThanks for submitting this pull request to add NativeScript to the CodePush CLI. For the next six months, we are focused on integrating CodePush into Mobile Center and making sure that we provide the best possible experience for the existing supported platforms. Consequently, while we are very interested in NativeScript and impressed by the enthusiasm it has engendered amongst its adopters, we must close this PR in the hopes that it will be resubmitted when we can give it the attention it deserves..

This should be the case. We should be back online shortly.. @BretJohnson @sergey-akhalkov The syntax fix seems reasonable and like extremely low-hanging fruit; couldn't it be done from the CLI itself?. Hi Joe, can you confirm that your label is indeed v0.0.2? \nRun the code-push deployment h <appName> <deploymentName> command to verify.. @joeferraro You coding bender helped reveal a weakness in our naming and for this we owe you thanks. Thank you! \n@BretJohnson I think you are correct.. Documentation patched; thank you @PawelWesolowski, @BretJohnson.. @D1no - I am so sorry to have missed that; documentation has been corrected. Thanks for pointing out the oversight.. Updating documentation.. Nice catch Bret; thanks.. Updated.. Hi @joncursi, CodePush handle lets you mange the situation you describe with semantic versioning. Each time you make a release with CodePush you specify the target binary version that your update should apply to. So in the scenario you describe above, CodePush version B would target binary version A and more importantly you would set CodePush version D to target the binary version that shipped with C and exclude the binary version that shipped with A.\nI encourage you to test this. You can do so fairly quickly and at no cost by building a test app and distributing it through Mobile Center for scenarios A and C and using the CodePush CLI release commands for B and D. . Updated!. Refinement added to larger feature request in queue.. We are really sorry to hear that your app was rejected. That being said, we know if no known App Store rejections where CodePush has been determined to be the cause. Can you provide us with some more detail please? What did you use to write your app? What 3rd party components or packages did you include with your application? \nThanks.\n. Hi, promoting or releasing with a rollout will not automatically target the same devices from a previous rollout. Indeed, that functionality does not currently exist. \nIf you are at V1 with a rollout that has a bug, my recommendation is to make a release with the original bundle. Why? Currently we don't have a way to rollback to what was shipped with the binary. We have written a specification for this feature, but at the moment it is on our backlog. \nWith a V2 that has you back where you started, you can proceed to make your patched release and roll it out to 25%. Does that make sense?. The users that actually downloaded it will stay on it until they upgrade to your new, baseline release. I would make that release mandatory.. ",
    "jslz": "hi, (at least for react-native) what does \"automatic rollback based on patch crashing\" really do? Currently we are in a situation where we have 2 outstanding code push bundles and the 2nd one apparently killed the app (maybe because it is wix rnn cf. #875) but now it appears that CP is running the app with no patches applied at all. What I would hope for is that patch 1 which worked OK would become reactive? That Patch 2 would be disabled or something. Afaict it has kicked us to the state of not having any patches applied at all.\nupdate: well for my device it just figured out that it could apply Patch 1. One of our other devices was still in the \"no patches after crash\" situation still. We waited a while and then it got the CP dialog to apply the mandated patch as well. So there's maybe some kind of limbo time between patch 2 dying -> being on the unpatched version -> it applying patch 1 again.. ",
    "PierBover": "@lostintangent yes it would make sense.\nElectron auto-updater still requires you to configure your own server...\n. > Both would require restarting the app after restart.\nI'd rather make my users deal with that (which is almost a standard at least in OSX) than having to deal with Squirrel.\n. We've been struggling for days to implement Squirrel on Electron and still haven't finished.\nCodePush for Electron would be the best thing since sliced bread.\n. Probably the only thing the community could do is to work on a plugin for electron, but without an effort from the CodePush team to implement stuff on the CLI and the server it would be useless.\n. Thanks for the answer @piyushjo \n. Like @piyushjo said Electron is more popular every day, but as of today there are no good solutions for updating an Electron app.\nSquirrel is what the Electron team still recommends. It does the job on macOS but the server side implementation is up to each developer. On Windows it's not a great solution to the point that electron-builder, the most important project for packaging an Electron app, is moving away to NSIS.\nIf CodePush implemented the whole solution from server to client like it did with Cordova, I and many others would gladly pay for it to move away from Squirrel.. We really need this.\nReact Native is a mess and Cordova apps are very limited in iOS thanks to a half baked WKWebview.\nPretty please?\n. @lostintangent do you think there is enough interest by the community?\n. > One note -- as much as I would like to open source my solution, it will have to be commercial and sold on my http://nativescript.tools site.\nOh boy you really need a new website.\nTelerik already offers this functionality btw.\n. > yes but have you checked the cost :) :)\nYes, of course.\nI haven't really used the product but IMO if it is as good as it looks the cost will pay itself in all the time it saves you.\n. > Telerik does NOT offer the functionality for NativeScript yet\nSource?\nFrom their website it seems AppBuilder works on Cordova and NativeScript which is also developed by Telerik.\n. You are right about AppBuilder, but they do have a CodePush like service:\nhttp://docs.telerik.com/platform/appbuilder/nativescript/appmanager-livesync/overview\nEdit: although LiveSync is only available on the enterprise subscription. \ud83d\udc4e \n. >  I haven't heard anyone mention it in the NS community!\nYeah probably because it's not affordable for solo devs and small companies.\n. You are referring to AppBuilder LiveSync.\nI'm referring to AppManager LiveSync.\n. > The AppManager LiveSync service is applicable only to apps developed with Apache Cordova 3.7.0 or later.\nNope. Check the link I posted earlier. It's for NS.\n. Yes please, add support for Electron apps. Or at least add a Node API so we can get the files from the CodePush server and copy them to the relevant folder in the Electron app.\nWe are using CodePush for our Cordova apps and it would be awesome to use a single deploy platform for all our clients.\n. Hey @joeblew99 do you have a blog post or article that explains all that in more detail?\n. ",

    "piyushjo": "Hi guys, I noticed the recent activity on this thread and just want to say that our CodePush team is mainly focusing on the mobile experience at the moment so Electron is not on our priority. Having said this, we are monitoring the adoption of Electron and this may become important sometime in the future but just not yet. Thank you for the feedback. \n. Thank you for the feedback,\nwhat data do you think will be useful to be exposed as part of this webhook like functionality? From the thread looks like you are mainly interested in metrics of how many users got the update rolled back. Anything else? \n. Yes. We don't charge for the service today but we do want to make the service useful to as many apps as we can so expanding the allowable app size is definitely something we will consider. \n. Hey @bmanderscheid would you be open to a call with our CodePush team so we can understand your scenario and usage and see if we can figure out a workaround? Feel free to send me an email at piyushjo AT Microsoft.com and we can find some time. thank you. \n. Hi there,\nyes it is a known issue and something which is on our backlog to fix.

When code-push downloads an update, it puts it in a place in iOS's reserved harddrive space for each app which is slightly different than where the app itself is, so I can imagine that the cryptic message is related to iOS being confused by this special location when asking for a permission. As explained in this stack-overflow post, you should be able to specify the exact message that you will get asked by adding NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription to your Info.plist and specifying a more user friendly message, like [App Name] would like to access your location when running and displayed.

    "igalarzab": "Hi dtivel,\nThanks for the quick response!\nI'm checking the code and I see that providing a --targetBinaryVersion causes code-push to ignore the build.gradle file, allowing me to release new versions.\nI don't know how feasible is to start interpreting the gradle code to extract the real versionName, so maybe fixing the assumption of receiving a string (to avoid the crash) and giving a hint of the --targetBinaryVersion parameter existence is enough to fix the issue.\nWhat do you think?\n. Cool, thanks!\n. ",
    "joshuapinter": "Any update to how difficult it would be to use the calculated string instead of having to explicitly set the --targetBinaryVersion? \nI've got a similar thing where I'm doing this: \n```gradle\ndef versionMajor = 6\ndef versionMinor = 4\ndef versionPatch = 3\nversionCode versionMajor * 10000 + versionMinor * 100 + versionPatch\nversionName \"${versionMajor}.${versionMinor}.${versionPatch}\"\n``. @sergey-akhalkov It's simpler than that but I imagine you would still need to execute gradle to get the final values. we literally just usedefto make it easier to set the correct version and ensure that theversionCode` represents it correctly.\nNo worries, for now we'll just use --targetBinaryVersion..

Could someone perhaps point me to the right direction, since the issue is already closed I assume I missed the docs somehow. Thanks.\n. I was looking for information regarding security in general, how I could prevent MitM attacks and how I could allow a developer from our team to deploy to some specific deployments, but not necessarily to production.\nHaving the option to specify custom-provided credentials seems to cover a lot of ground.\nSignature generation\nI like the proposal of using the same credentials as the app store release keys as a default value. But it would be important to allow developers to override those keypairs if they needed.\nSignature storage\nI like the option of locally caching, specially if that is coupled with a TTL setting. If that is the chosen path, I would like it to be cached per deployment, since we use different keys for production/non-production builds of our apps.\nRuntime signature validation\nHow would that be achieved? Would it be a completely native-side solution on each platform? Could it be done in a tamper-proof way, since we would not be validating those signatures on the OS level?\n. @silhouettes That sounds just perfect.\nI tend to keep on the safe side on the security aspect.

Certain AppBuilder features may or may not work on different platforms for projects (HTML5, Cordova/PhoneGap and NativeScript). Anyway, getting off topic. Sign up for a trial account and you'll see. I stopped using AppBuilder because there were too many limitations. CLI was overall more flexible.\n. LiveSync is different. When I deploy an app through the Nativescript Companion App, I can make changes in AppBuilder on desktop, save those changes and Appbuilder \"auto-syncs\" (not completely auto because you need to swipe sometimes, but close enough) and the changes appear quickly on the Nativescript Companion App. Think hot-reload during development. It really is cool for development. But it's a development feature.\n. Ooooh completely missed that.\nThe AppManager LiveSync service is applicable only to apps developed with Apache Cordova 3.7.0 or later.\n. ",

Its still coming, it seems only on the android side.. Guys, any updates here? It seems to come continuously for the majority of the users on the android side.. It's happening only for Android. We disabled the updates for a few days then enabled them back and still gave the error. Only about 40 installs made during that time.\nNow as for logs, all we have is a sentry that is thrown when \"sync\" method gives: status == window.top.SyncStatus.ERROR. We call this method in the success function of \"checkForUpdate\" method.\nA thing to mention is that the last update that worked was that of a new build. We were preparing a new package (1.4) and we needed to push a change to the current released package (1.3). This happened after the code of 1.4 has been merged into the main branch to prepare for release. So initially we decided to not release updates since they would be made against the new package, against 1.4 code. And this new package has an additional native plugin compared to the current one. But then we ran some tests and the updates worked on our internal 1.3 package and even with the release version. No issues, no crashes. So we pushed this to live and while things still work fine on our devices, we keep getting the error for almost all android users. \nAnd another thing to know is that the new plugin was for ios only and the ios users have no problem.\n. That seems to be a new feature. It's not in the version of the app that is currently released, but good to know about it to include it in the next release.. Any workarounds to make the current updates work without releasing a new package with the updated plugin?. ",
    "pitAlex": "+1\n. Is there any news on this yet?. Its nativescript and its power of tapping into the native api. You know that you can access private api with it on iOS? I did a few experiments. That is what caused all the concerns. You could push an update that access those apis and that is not allowed by apple. With this risk in mind you just don't know if apple will allow it or not when they realize this, so your app can end up being rejected just because it has the ability to update. I'm disappointed too but I can understand the concerns and the choice not to support it.. Well I just wanted to know if its available or not. I use the SDK to simplify the process of pushing app updates because our app has DEV, STAGE and PROD mode. There are actually 3 apps for both platforms. I use node scripts to sync web scripts to the cordova app, the SDK to push the updates for testing DEV and then the rest. So in my case it would of been nice to also have the signing in SDK.. ",

    "NathanaelA": "Unfortunately I started my plugin a long while back, before I knew about the MS code push solution, otherwise I would have probably piggybacked on it...  \n@Charlkie14, actually my updater plugin works fully on both iOS and Android; including hot-reloading.  If you saw the demo, the server side controls what update the client gets; the client can send a large variety of information back to the server for the server to make a choice of what \"version\" should be released to it, this allows you to do A/B testing and limited releases of new versions.       Sufficed to say I'm very pleased with myself this week!    :grinning:      However, there are some minor things I want to clean up before a beta release (eliminate debug code, kill dead code, make status bar cleaner) , but it fully works right now, and will probably be released mid-next week. \nOne note -- as much as I would like to open source my solution, it will have to be commercial and sold on my http://nativescript.tools site.  I am a contractor and have no deep pockets to fund everything I do as open source (I've already personally funded > 20 open source NativeScript plugins).   If I receive enough income from this project and people vote up 2.0 being a code push plugin, I am willing to rewrite it as a code push plugin, but again it will still remain as a commercial plugin --- Unless some company (MS? / Telerik? / ???) wants to contract with me to write it as fully open source; which I have no problems doing (I prefer open source, but again unfortunately I got to eat).\n. @PierBover - Telerik does NOT offer the functionality for NativeScript yet, they do for PhoneGap/Cordova.    And yes, I do need a new website; it is on my list to do when I have \"spare\" time.  :grinning:   \n. @PierBover - Interesting I didn't know they actually got it working on NativeScript, I hadn't seen that; I wonder if it is an already shipping feature, or something shipping soon -- I haven't heard anyone mention it in the NS community!      \nEdit: Interesting disclaimer: \n\nAppManager LiveSync is a distribution service that lets you deliver updates straight to an installed app on the devices of your end users. AppBuilder LiveSync is a development service that facilitates rapid testing during development and is not intended to deliver public updates to end users.\n. \n",

    "EddyVerbruggen": "Hi folks, just so you're aware: there's now PR #435 that implements this feature.\nLet's hope it gets accepted so you all can use this excellent service!\nThere's also a NativeScript client side CodePush plugin that plays nice with the CodePush cloud and works similar to the Cordova and RN implementations. You can use that already in your app, but perhaps it's best to wait until it's decided what happens to the pull request.. @pitAlex That's entirely true, but that's also true for the initial not-codepushed AppStore version. You can easily circumvent Apple's static code analysis - heck, even with a fully native app, or Cordova, or RN.\nI'm as disappointed as you are, obviously, but the reason my PR was rejected is because what @iageoghe explained, not because MSFT deems NativeScript a dangerous or inferior technology (on the contrary is what I heard). But - shortly after they encouraged us to create this PR MSFT management decided to focus their scarce resources on the CodePush platforms they already support and integrate those into their new Mobile Center solution.\nI would love to support NativeScript within Mobile Center but AFAIK it's closed source so they'd have to do it themselves and just don't have the resources to take an additional platform on board. However, MSFT promised to reevaluate the situation over time and consider any other platforms (in addition to iOS, Android, Xamarin, Cordova and RN) like NativeScript to be added to Mobile Center if there is sufficient demand (and resources in their team).\nI respect their decision, I hope you do to, and let's all hope it won't take too long for NativeScript to become part of Mobile Center as well.\nIn the meanwhile we should look for other CodePush-like solutions given that for this PR to work I've already created a clientside plugin that does the legwork, we \"only\" need a cloud service that stores and serves the code updates.. but let's take that discussion to the NativeScript forum.. For folks interested, there's a new proposal for adding NativeScript support to App Center here: https://github.com/Microsoft/appcenter-cli/issues/542\n@patniko Would love to learn more about the generic option you mentioned, but for the time being, teaming up with App Center seems like the best option..

This means that there are no files lying around. Its all just a single file.\n- in the package is an electron app, and some golang, java and c' stuff\n- the golang main func, starts up electron & any other things i need in a single proces.\n\nFor updates i just use the golang update services. There are many but here is one.\nhttps://github.com/sanbornm/go-selfupdate\nNot sure why i am telling you this.

Do you have a chance to verify your issue one more time with latest version of plugin/cli and let us know the results? . Changes have been merged, thank you!. @silhouettes The issue described in https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/issues/339 was fixed in yargs 4 and upper versions. I've looked at change logs at https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/v6.5.0/CHANGELOG.md#v400-2016214-127-0700 but unfortunately was unable to find the exact notice about the described issue (I think may be fixed in this PR https://github.com/yargs/yargs/pull/368). So I've only determined that versions below 4.0 have the same problem;)\nThe most part of changes in API were introduced in 4.0 version but I suppose that if it is needed to test this changes anyway it would be better to use the latest version because they might have fixed any other issues as well.\nSo the API methods were slightly changed. For now demand() points to the number of arguments followed by the command e.g. \ncode-push release <appName> <updateContentsPath> <targetBinaryVersion> requires 3 non-option arguments followed by the 'release' command, so we changed this todemand(3, 3) and etc.\nI've tried to do my best to verify that all CLI commands are running as expected with updated yargs. But we can double check it again if needed,. @silhouettes , thanks for pointing at this, I've pushed required changes. I'd like to perform some little more testing of this and I'm going to merge this changes next week.. @aboveo thanks, your logo has been added!. @RemeJuan thanks, your logo has been added!. Hello @JSGuy7 - unfortunately you cannot just remove last release from deployment history because deployment\u2019s release history is immutable, so you cannot delete or remove an update once it has been released.\nAlso rollback command requires the same source package app version as the destination one. So you need two packages with the same app version parameter to preform the rollback command.\nIn your case it would be reasonable to perform one more release with required fixes (with mandatory flag) and with target binary version set. Please let us know in case of any questions.. Closing the issue, @JSGuy7 - feel free to open new one if you have questions regarding this. . @tje3d thanks, your logo has been added!. @csun-axsy thanks, your logo has been added!.

Thanks for verifying @johnculviner. Could be useful if someone would like to go with this solution.. Hello @workzhushengquan, as far as I get you question you have the following:\na) released version 1.0 of the app \nb) received updates for 1.0 and do not received updates for 1.2 (which is correct)\nc) is confused why 1.0.1 is also receiving the updates.\nSo the reason of why 1.0.1 is also getting the updates is that \nsemver.satisfies(1.0 1.0.1) will return true. So by releasing version 1.0 you are getting updates for 1.0.x versions this way.\nIf you want to constrain the results to satisfy only 1.0.0 version of the app you can patch you release somehow like this:\n>code-push patch AppName Staging --label YourLabel --targetBinaryVersion 1.0.0\nPlease let me know if it solves your problem..

Hello @tamkin04iut, this really looks odd. Can you please answer the following questions:\n1) Are you able to reproduce this many times or this happens just once?\n2) If it is reproducing every time are you able to repro this with our sample app?\n3) Is it possible that you have any problems with internet connection when running the app?. Hello @tamkin04iut, thank you so much for your response!\nI've tried your example and it works well for me.\nHowever I've found a way to reproduce your issue by doing the following steps:\n1) Create a new depoyment and add a few releases (confirmed that everything is correct)\n2) Clear deployment history for current release by using code-push deployment clear <appName> <deploymentName> command\n3) After that go ahead and release a new update for my deployment\n4) Updated the app on device and verified that now I've broken metrics for this deployment.\nSo after all it looks like clearing deployment history and then releasing updates will break metrics and it looks like a bug and we will address it soon.\nCan you please confirm that your steps were similar  to the steps above?\nAs for your second question about reducing number of Active deployments - that seems to be expected due to the following: \n\nThe install metrics have the following meaning:\nActive - The number of successful installs that are currently running this release (i.e. if the user opened your app, they would see/run this version). This number will increase and decrease as end-users upgrade to and away from this release, respectively.\n\nSo as far as your go to next release your number is reduced from previous one (e.g. v9) and incremented to the next (v10). . @digaus unfortunately this issue is still active, we are aware of it and added this item to our backlog. . @digaus yep that seems to be the same story with this, clearing deployment history can introduce such unpleasant things. Thanks for sharing this!. @thedmeyer thank you for your request, your logo has been added.. Hello @laowenlu thank you so much for pointing to the issue, Fix for it has been merged into the master branch. \nI'm closing the issue for now, please let us know if you still see any issues after updating from master branch of code-push..

Hi @pke, seems that the rejections only affect apps that use native code update technologies, like Rollout and JSPatch. \nPlease see https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/748, https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/issues/227 for more details.. @marcelaraujo thanks for sharing this. Also please see the latest thread in RN repo: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/13011. So seems that CodePush is not a culprit of the issue.. I'm closing the issue now as it turns out that code-push is valid for using with app store. Will reopen this one if any changes.. @abhisheksoni27 , @silhouettes I've updated our source repo with new copyright year and also deployed recent changes to gh-pages, so I believe I can close current PR. Please let me know if you see any issues.. @silhouettes got it, will always run gulp test before PR's for this repositories. \nYour PR looks good!. Hello @luk156, that looks strange. Can you please verify that you do not have any absolute path to font icons? . @luk156 - do you have a chance to look at this?. Looks like the package node-uuid package on npm has been deprecated but the repo hasn't been because its now serving up the source code for uuid. More details here https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid/issues/155\n@silhouettes - I've searched through code-push project and it seems that we are not using node-uuid module any more at this time. What do you think, is it ok if we remove this dependency completely from our code-push package.json?. @silhouettes - I've looked closer at this and it turns out that nothing we can do with this warning. \nAs it is stated here  https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/issues/86 this warning appears due to our code-push-react-native (as well as react-native) have dependency upon xcodepackage which is in its turn dependent upon node-uuid package. \nSo I believe we should wait until xcode package will update their dependencies.. @fungilation thank you for referencing the issue in node-xcode repository. Currently we'll left this item open and wait for new release of xcode to bump dependency accordingly. . Hey @fungilation, thanks for heads up!\nWe have updated xcode dependency on our side in this PR.\nHowever currently we will still see this warnings for 2 reasons:\n1) react-native package depends upon old xcode package, we cannot force them to update it immediately\n2) our react-native-code-push package have a dependency for code-push 1.8.0-beta which is outdated. Unfortunately we should wait for new  code-push release which will include this PR and after that we can update this dependency also.\nWe'll try to update this as soon as possible.\n. Closing this as fix was released with React Native Code Push 2.0.3.. Hi @amesf, that looks interesting, \nIs it possible for you to share with us your build.gradle file from android/app folder so that we can try to reproduce your issue (or may be you have the minimum app example where we can try to reproduce this)?. @amesf - hi, do you have a chance to look at this? . @amesf - we are closing the issue for now, please let us know if you get I chance to look at this and the issue is still reproducing on your side.. @BJGDEV please review your issue and fill proper description otherwise this item will be closed as invalid.. @silhouettes - looks good! Also walked through other dependencies in code-push and verified that we have no more unused packages.. @victorhua - got it, thanks for explanation. I believe your assumptions are correct and code-push-@1.9.3-beta should fix it. I'm closing the issue now, let is know if you have any questions further. . Hey @the-simian, thank you for your great investigation! All this information will be very useful for anyone who can get this error in future! We are appreciating your help with this.\nWill try to monitor when this will be fixed in gradle-to-js package and will update our dependency accordingly.. Merging this to Master due to the corresponding changes to support plain integer number (adding \"0.0\" to it, so it means that e.g. v. 2 would be treated as v. 2.0.0 this way) were deployed to code-push service side. . Hey guys, we've investigated for Azure logs, there were several errors here but looks like a tmp issue. We'll keep an eye on this. Closing it for now as seems the issue has been resolved, let us know if any problems.. hi @JakeRawr,thanks for reaching us. We haven't heard about this issue previously. Do you currently experience such kind of problems? Do you have any info about your users location/internet connection etc? . Hello @cbjs, thank you for reaching us. Could you describe your problem a little more?\nWhat CLI/SDK versions you are using, the platform you are on? What is your deployment history looks like? How do you bootstrap codepush? . @cbjs - thank you for this!\nAnd also just to make it clear - the problem is that when you rollback one release new release is created (e.g. v95 from your history) but users do not receive it? So you have to release one more version after that?\nCan you confirm that all users do not receive update this way or only those who are e.g. on certain version of code-push update?\n. @cbjs thanks for your reply. What was the problem so finally?. @cbjs thanks for the explanation! . Hello @afilp, I know that it was discussed a long time ago but hope to hear you back :) \nSo my point here - why don't you try to use different access keys here, so this will eliminate the need to login-logout from you github accounts multiple times because it could be really frustrating. \nThis way you will be not tightly coupled with your github acc and can do different things with code push at the same time. \nPlease let me know what do you think about this?. Hi @luqiuyuan, I believe @pniko has already replied your question via email, just duplicate his answer here:\n\nYou should be able to sign up with a new account and use the app transfer command in the CLI to move ownership to your new account. \n\nPlease let us know if any issues.. Hi @luqiuyuan, we are sorry about the inconvenience here but as for now we cannot move the apps to the new account due to security. \nThe messages you receive states that your code push account with such email address is already associated with your previous github account (which was converted to an organization), so seems that you need to use other mail to register. \nAfter you create new CodePush account you can configure your app with new deployment keys and then release new binary version linked to this app.. Thanks @luqiuyuan, I believe we can close the issue. Feel free to reach us if  needed.. Hey @jose920405, I've just tested this functionallity with my friend and it works like a charm.\nI've done it via old CLI:\ncode-push collaborator add appName username@useremail.com\nAre you completely sure that you never mistype in the email or probably the email falls into junk mails?. @jose920405 thanks for the info. Is it possible that company's domain mailbox has some kind of filter that rejects some external emails? If possible it would be great if you can get out this information from company admins and share result's with us.. Hi there @Borisboky, thanks for reaching us.\nSo could you please verify that you have wrapped you app within codepush as it is described in tutorial.\n```\n//add the following before registerComponent is called\nlet codePushOptions = { checkFrequency: codePush.CheckFrequency.MANUAL };\nAppName = codePush(codePushOptions)(AppName);\nAppRegistry.registerComponent(\"AppName\", () => AppName);\n```\nPlease let us know if the following fixed your issue.. Thanks for feedback and quick turnaroud @Borisboky ! Will look at on how to improve this in our docs (also feel free to share your ideas or create a PR for this - that would be much appreciated). \nIn the meanwhile I believe we can close the item if your issue was fixed.. Hey @imreFitos, unfortunatelly there is no way currently to restrict the collaborator access to specific deployments. \nPlease see this reference for details. \n\nOnce added, all collaborators will immediately have the following permissions with regards to the newly shared app:\nView the app, its collaborators, deployments and release history\nRelease updates to any of the app's deployments\n\nIt could probably be a good enhancement although we haven't got any requests about this yet. So for now you could always create a separate app to achieve your requirements.\nPlease let us now if you have more questions about this.. @nionata you logo was added, thanks for this!. @Rahulsss443 - hi, please let us know if you have a chance to look at this.. Closing the issue for now, please let us know if any further questions regarding this. \nAlso you could check out the following links where we have discussed similar question:\n1) https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/issues/415\n2) https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/748.

I'm closing the issue currently, please reopen when you get a chance to fill all the required fields.. hi @mdanics \nSo when using proxy to the CodePush account management REST API you are not able to provide noDuplicateReleaseError flag this way.\nI'm not sure how it can be useful in your case because the only thing it does is avoiding throwing an error in case resource already exists.\nYou can handle this in your catch block (and in fact this case is also handled in catch block for CLI).\nTo avoid this error you need to double check that the content you are releasing is different. You can e.g. debug and compare what output is released each time and if the output is the same than this behavior is expected.. Hi @mdanics, please let us know if you have a chance to look at this.. Thanks for the update @mdanics!. I believe no, there is no ability to find AppName by deployment key using CLI.. Hi there @BrianSo and thank for reaching us. \nAt that moment I've tried to follow you repro steps and haven't seen any issues with this.\nI've tried it with macOS Sierra 10.12.5, code-push 2.0.2-beta and Chrome browser also.\nSo can you please confirm that the issue is still active and reproducible for you?. @BrianSo I believe the problem could be related to some kind of server issue being temporary not available. I've tried it on my local machine and it has previous versions before. \nAnyway it would be great if you check out it once more on a new computer tomorrow and let us know the results.. Thanks for update @BrianSo and let us know if you see any issues with code push in future.. Hi @digaus \nCould you please share with us a minimum code (and even better exact repro steps of what you are doing) so we can try it on our machines and get out if is is working for us? . @digaus Well, that looks strange but without debugging on sample its hard to say what's wrong here. Can we consider the issue to be resolved so far?. Hi @syzer,\nSo I believe Ownership Transfer section of docs can answer your question. BTW do you have any objections in using Mobile Center for this?. Thanks for feedback, we'll try to improve the process going further.. Hey guys, sorry for that, service was temporary unavailable, the issue is mitigated now, thanks for reporting!. Hello @freakinruben, you are right, the following lines of code add --sourcemap-output to the final bundle command.\nWell, we need somehow to determine wherever we need to generate sourcemaps or not based on sourcemapOutput parameter.\nSo we need to decide how to forbid sourcemap generation in this case and we should consider that this parameter is of type string, so it is not correct to set it to either true or false.\nAs per our documentation OutputFolder :\n\nSpecifies the relative path to where the assets, JS bundle and sourcemap files should be written. If left unspecified, the assets, JS bundle and sourcemap will be copied to the /tmp/CodePush folder.\n\nAt first sight I don't see an elegant solution on how to do it and fit well with current approach by changing sourcemapOutput parameter values. \nIMHO when sourcemapOutput  is left unspecified and you use outputDir parameter the most desirable result for most part of the users would be to generate source maps by default to output folder. \nIf we set this to empty string than it is also confusing why we should not generate it at all this way. Setting it to other values doesn't make sense with outputDir because according to docs it overrides the output result location.\nIf you see any smart way how we can do such thing without introducing needless complexity it would be appreciated.\n. @freakinruben \nWell, introducing additional flag could be a solution but I'm a little worried about if it is good to have flags on all variety of situations :) (And I believe it could be a lot of them theoretically). \nAnyway what can I propose: we can close this issue and postpone it unless we do not have more requests about this feature.\nIf it is suitable in your case you can go ahead and modify this lines to prohibit source map generation directly (you can create a fork add changes and install from it or change it directly in place where your CLI lives). \nPlease let me know what do you think about it.\n. Sure thing @freakinruben and thanks for cooperation.. Hi @apolishch, unfortunately I believe it is not. Probably you could put this information manually in the description parameter when releasing  new code-push update, although it is not super handy it could be a solution sometimes.. Thanks for quick reply @apolishch, I believe we can close the issue at that moment. Please feel free to reach us in case you have more q's.. Hey @apolishch, regarding to this section: https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#android try to change staging config name to releaseStaging in accordance with the following:\n\nNOTE: The naming convention for releaseStaging is significant due to this line.. @apolishch got it, just to clarify, are you running react-native run-android --variant staging or react-native run-android --variant releaseStaging?. @apolishch also can you please verify if we need to change stagingCompile 'com.balsikandar.android:crashreporter:1.0.9' to releaseStagingCompile 'com.balsikandar.android:crashreporter:1.0.9' in this case?. Hey @apolishch, did you get a chance to look at the link from above, do you have any updates on this?. Closing this for now, please feel free to reopen if the issue still persist (probably would be better to create in react-native repo as it seems more relevant to SDK rather than CLI). Hey @fenglu09, so that's true and update that was once rolled back shouldn't be applied any more due to this check.\n\nSo you can produce new update targeting the same binary version and code push should try to apply it again to those devices. If they would be rolled back again then this update shouldn't be applied again.\nAlso there is ignoreFailedUpdates syncOption parameter that allows you to ignore failed updates but I'm not sure if it is a good idea to use it.. @fenglu09 I completely understand your concerns here but I believe that our release command doesn't have an option to determine whether it should be applied only to those devices that were already rolled back. \nProbably if you are on react-native you could try e.g. ON_NEXT_SUSPEND install mode to improve user experience and make the process of applying new updates less invasive.. I'm not aware of any plans of supporting this feature in the nearest time, but what do you think of using \nsyncOptions.ignoreFailedUpdates = false in your case? This way update will be installed even if it was rolled back previously.\nWell, its not an ideal solution but you can add some modifications to the SDK to add e.g. max number of retries and limit the attempts to install that update to some kind of constant e.g. 5. \nBut frankly I believe that the rule of thumb is that if update was rolled back it shouldn't be applied at all. \nIt would be better to identify why the update was rolled back and that way to prevent such situations in future.. @fenglu09 probably you could use some kind of crash reporting tools for that but please see similar question in cordova-code-push repository for more details: https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/issues/140. Hi @pocesar, thanks for reporting this.\nWe've never seen such issues before, we'll try to reproduce it. Could you please provide us what exact version of update-notifier is installed?

Hey all, closing this as we don't see any problems with this currently, please let us know if you see this issue again.. Hey @JAStanton, unfortunately this cannot be done via adding user as a collaborator but you can do this trick via mobile center functionality.  Please follow this steps to add new admins here.. Closing the item, please let us know if you have more questions. . @junjchen thanks for fixing!. @RoboTeddy thanks for your feedback, we've added note about this here https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/commit/e1c20ab0ab1cf855d0e35fc7873ddea41f952f31. Hope things would be clearer now.. @stantoncbradley thank you for your request, your logo has been added.. Hello @adambene, AFAIK there is no official way to mark bundle versions of codepush releases for users. \nSo its up to you to decide how you will distinguish different releases (of course if you ever need this). Probably you could use a combination of app version and label, may be you can pass additional info in description field like GUID on producing new release to extract it later. You can decide which way is more convenient to you.. @adambene thanks for feedback, please take a look at https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/issues/273   if it is not something you are looking for?. @adambene got it! Do you mind if we close this item in favor of #273 as seems that the latter should satisfy your needs?. @sudzy-group - your logo has been added! Thank you!. Hello @agersoncgps, I have tried to reproduce your issue on my side but with no luck.\nEverytime I hit Press for Update Metadata button I was able to get label parameter as expected. Tested on iPhone7 iOS11.0.\nI've attached demo, so could you please take a look at this and let me know if you are able to reproduce issue with it on your side? (just do npm i and change deployment key to yours to test it).\nissue522.zip\nLooking forward to get results from you.\n. @agersoncgps please let us know if you have a chance to look at this.. Closing this as of no response, please let us know if you need any assistance with this.. @RobertPaul01 we have updated docs, thanks again for pointing at this.. @belemaire got it, thanks. So merging this, hope we can release it by the end of this week.. @belemaire we've released new versions of CLI & SDK (https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/releases/tag/v2.1.3-beta), thanks again for contribution!. As CodePush site is moving to AppCenter currently we do not support such kind of requests, sorry for inconvenience. . Hello @haualan sorry for that, that looks a little bit strange, I've tried on my side and was able to get info for that apps in \"ownerName/appName\" format.\nHowever can you try the following first to see if it helps:\n1) Use new AppCenter CLI and try to rename the app with appcenter apps update command OR\n2) Go to AppCenter site and try to change the name of the app directly via UI\nPlease let us know if it helps.. @newyankeecodeshop - yep, codepush is moving to AppCenter and as part of this change apps and users are migrated to AppCenter. Since now I believe it make sense to try new AppCenter CLI instead (old CodePush CLI would be deprecated on mid Oct 2018). \nAlso more information about this could be found here: http://microsoft.github.io/code-push/\nProbably our migration guide could be useful when start working with AppCenter and appcenter CLI.\nPlease do not hesitate to reach us and send questions/feedback about new AppCenter - that would be much appreciated. \n. @haualan please let us know if you have a chance to look at this.. @haualan thanks for update! So I believe we can close this issue as it has been resolved. Please feel free to reach us if any more questions or troubles.. @belemaire sure, let's do it in the nearest days!. @belemaire we have released new verison - https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/releases/tag/v2.1.4. Thank you! . @belemaire yeah, there could be a little confusion here but 2.0.4 stands for SDK while 2.1.4 is for CLI. Thanks for attention to details \ud83d\udc4d . Hello @levelasquez, thanks for reporting, we've already such kind of issue reported here https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/1069.\nIf you don't mind I'm closing this as a duplicate please let me know if any concerns. \n. Hi there @riwu, that is some kind of inheritance from times when CodePush was not integrated in AppCenter and we do not specify these parameters at all. \nYou know that at that moment we are moving to the new appcenter CLI and here you do not need to specify parameters twice, indeed they are inferred from the app. \nSo I believe that it make sense to try to use appcenter cli going further. . Hey @PaperMonster we have release new version of code push https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/releases/tag/v2.1.5\nPlease let us know if you see any issues.. Hi there @pitAlex, thanks for asking. AFAIK we don't have any plans for doing this. \nAlso just my point of view but SDK should be a thin layer that is placed between client and service (and it looks like that now). Adding sign option would require to move \na) hashing \nb) singing \nc) validation of all of that stuff \nlogic to the SDK and this will lead to significant growth for this class (also to avoid code duplication with CLI part we should share that logic probably somehow). Signing a package could be compared to the bundle operation. We do not have bundleAndRelease method for SDK as SDK is responsible only for creating new release on service, bundling the package is out of its scope. I believe the same thoughts could be applied to signing and if we ever need some kind of signAndRelease logic. \nBut anyway that is only my opinion and we would be happy to hear what other people from the community think about it - we are all ears.. Closing this for now as we postpone this feature.. Closing this as duplicate to https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/issues/356.\nAs far as being cordova specific should be discussed further in cordova repo. . Hey @jdnichollsc, that is not easy to say what's going wrong here but probably you could share the smallest possible sample app with us so we could try it on our side? Please specify the code-push-react-native-plugin version also.\nMay be it make sense to create a new issue with all this information in react-native-code-push repository as this repo is mostly for CLI questions and general CodePush questions. \nThanks!. Thanks for update!. Hello @devjackcat, I've looked at service implementation and it turns out that this method is not implemented for this custom codepush service implementation:\nhttps://github.com/lisong/code-push-server/blob/020a35014d7c202d87f92a601b96f661380c6a80/routes/apps.js#L334\nAlso there seems to be similar issue already filled for this repo:\nhttps://github.com/lisong/code-push-server/issues/24\nHope this info was useful, thanks!  . @silhouettes thank you for your feedback. I thought initially about this and I was a little bit confused about naming it releasebecause it would be semantically closer to something related to our code-push release command which actually perform the release of our updates to code push server and has nothing in common with release build flag. So I think naming this flag as  release may lead to some confusion. If you don't mind I'd prefer to avoid 'release' name here in this particular case.. Don't we need here to check for access rights here to delete file? Similar as this is done below for removing the signature? If yes - does it make sense to use utility function for this?. @ruslan-bikkinin \nProbably it could be a good idea to show human friendly message like e.g. this one: https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/blob/master/cli/script/release-hooks/signing.ts#L57 so users will be aware what's wrong here rather than throwing EPERM exception. What do you think about this? . ",

    "chendo": "Ah cool. We have a similar problem where if we build an APK with the newest code but haven't done a production code push, it will \"upgrade\" to the older version. I was hoping to use this arbitrary metadata to have a time stamp too. \nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn 30 Jun 2016, at 12:49 PM, Jonathan Carter notifications@github.com wrote:\n@chendo This is something we hope to get to soon, since we hear this request pretty frequently.\nThat said, we actually want to solve the unnecessary update problem automatically, without any developer or app intervention. The server already has a hash of each update's contents, so we just need the hash of the binary-bundled content in order to no-op available updates that are equivalent to what the App Store version already included.\nOur Cordova plugin already does this, and our React Native plugin will support this as of React Native 0.29.0 (we needed support from the RN packager), so depending on which platform your app is built on, we hope to help solve this without the need of the custom metadata feature.\n\u2015\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n. Nah, we're using Cordova. We see this because we built an APK but hadn't done a code push to production, so the hash would be different, but it would be doing a downgrade rather than an upgrade.\n. Yeah it would, but we would like to build the production APK to make sure that's all good before we do a push to all users. Also, if we did a percentage rollout, would someone who downloads the new APK be potentially downgraded too?\n. We want to build a production APK with the newest code to test and ensure everything is good before we code push an update out to users. So in the usual case where the plugins don't change, we wouldn't bump APK version.\n\n@geof90 yeah that seems like what we'd have to do. We've actually disabled code push for now cause we launch next week and we occasionally see an issue where our Cordova app shows a blank screen after a code push update that we haven't had time to look into yet, so we'll have to re-visit post-launch\n. @geof90 We have an older release on the production channel, so that update would have already gone out to users. \nI'll have more time to look in to that next week and I'll put the issue on the cordova plugin repo.\nSuper useful project though, keep up the good work \ud83d\udc4d \n. @geof90 We will be deploying to the Play Store, but we would still need to test with a release APK with the newest code first. So the easiest way is to have some timestamp in the deployment metadata so we don't go backwards, or just build an APK with code push disabled\n. @daniel-beard We want to do something similar.

To sum it up, I have a feature request for a dedicated field to be able to track back a released bundle to a git commit.\nIdeally this field should be extracted from the package.json's version field automatically.. @max-mironov well, it can be a solution.

Could you please let us know does it work for you or, otherwise, clarify why you want to use --config parameter?. Got it @MrLoh. I recommend you to use general code-push release command for releasing updates - that will allow you to generate bundle by your own custom way including passing of --config parameter.

    "adriano-di-giovanni": "\nNote that each time you perform a release, you'll need to upload the whole app, and the server will take care of generating file-level diffs between versions of your app.\n\n@silhouettes,\nI understand that CodePush handles deployments as follows:\n diffs deployment(i) with deployment(i-1)\n sends new and updated files to clients\n* removes deleted files on clients\nIf so, updates are always incremental but we send the whole app.\nDo you confirm?\nThanks. @sergey-akhalkov, thanks for your reply.\nI'm going to ask you two more questions.\nIf I understand, I could also update cordova.js and javascript side of plugins. This could lead to inconsistencies between javascript and native sides of the cordova app. Am I correct? If so, why did you choose to include cordova-platform-specific javascript files? What are the benefits of this approach?\nThe reason why I opened the issue is as follows: I want my teammates to be able to release an update using CodePush and without having to deal with cordova. What if I release an update using the general command? Will the deployment preserve cordova-platform-specific javascript files?\nThanks. @srameshr, we're new to CodePush and we're investigating possible scenarios these days.. @sergey-akhalkov, I already read both chapters. I'd like to know if best practices emerged in managing environments.\nHow do people manage deployment to staging and production environments client side?\nDo they pass two different deployment keys to codePush.sync() just like we plan to do?. Thanks for your reply.\nWe started using the approach you recommended. We then moved to another one.\nWe don't use config.xml to specify deployment keys. We use javascript and use different keys according to the type of build (debug, release).\n. @sergey-akhalkov I'm pretty sure it's mandatory to deploy cordova-platform-specific files.\nI tried to deploy just my files (html, js, css, images) and I got the error I mentioned above. You can try yourself.\nI'm happy to be wrong. If so, please tell me how to avoid deploying cordova-platform-specific files.\nIf they are mandatory, I'd like to stress it's a suboptimal approach because it\n\ncould lead to inconsistencies\nforces my team mates to have cordova and the cordova project on their machine just to deploy an update with code-push\nincreases the size of the deployment\n\nThanks ;). > Could you please clarify what kind of inconsistencies you are talking about?\nSay I perform a cordova platform update and I forget to update project version in config.xml. A code-push deploy will update cordova.js, leading to an inconsistency between native cordova version and it's javascript counterpart.\n\nAs workaround you could share content of myapp/platforms/%platform%/assets/www folder, so your team mates would have ability to release updates using vanilla code-push release command, but this approach is unsafe due to you have to control differences between you version of myapp/platforms/%platform%/assets/www folder and version of this folder that having your team mates.\n\nAs you said, this approach is unsafe. Versioning could make it safer. IMHO that's another drawback of including cordova-platform-specific files in a deployment.\n\nI could see that my cordova-platform-specific files takes about ~300 KB for sample app (cordova.js and cordova_plugins.js files, cordova-js-src/ and plugins/ folders). Also note that cordova.js file is not contained in each update package due to diffing logic on CodePush server, only files that have been modified will present in CodePush update package and downloaded by the app.\n\nYou're right. We can say it's negligible.\nThanks.. ",

Used apk file and deploy application on mobile using apk file to test codepush service. After that a small html change and pushed the code using codepush service. (I am using VSTS with CI which pushes the code, shown in screenshots below) With this scenario, application was able to detect the codepush change when I click update button , which was checking if there is a codepush change (Dialogue displays codepush version 0.0.2). \n\nWhen I clicked yes on this dialog, application is hanged with white screen after few seconds and never gets update. Like this:\n\nRestarting the application shows the same version of application without udpates and clicking on update again shows the same version available to update message.\nSecond Scenario:  I deployed application on android appstore and change the version in config.xml from 0.0.1 > 0.0.2. Every code push change in this scenario ended up in same behavior as scenario 1. Application detects change (that means that applicaiton is talking to codepush server to detect the new update) but on clicking yes on the dialog, applicaiton hangs with blank screen and after restarted application does not pull the latest change.\nThe only change I am making  is follows:\nFrom\nAbout\nTo:\nAbout Me\nI tried to debug the device app by connecting through usb but Chrome isn't detecting the device for some reason, even the remote usb debugging is enabled on device.\nMy applicaton is based on one of demo that codepush team gave during a conference:\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/ionic-azure-conference-app\nThe codepush update code is in app/about.ts button click handler.\nCodepush updates are happening using VSTS:\n\n\n. @silhouettes Any guesses for the problem that I am having?\n. @silhouettes for while I haven't had a chnace to look at this project because of a lot of parts a moving with angular 2 finally realeased and ionic 2 new version coming out as well.

Not having a completely valid certificate hierarchy may reduce developer barrier to entry (?). An hmac approach maybe to weak for some as the shared secret could be easily extracted from the application.\nFuture enhancements might be a pipeline/plugin/provider model within code push.getJSBundle allowing for cli and app side extensibility where by a policy could be included in the JWT defining how the bundle was created (metadata, hash algorithm, key type, etc) like Oauth2 JWT in ADFS 3.0. This would allow for cli defined hashing algorithms and etc for advanced users as well as adding custom validators to possibly extended or harden the promotion concept\n. @silhouettes No problem at all, thanks for getting back.\nI'm really looking forward to trying it out, this will be a great security feature and such security features need to be in as early as possible from my opinion.\nThe only reason I mentioned the certificate hierarchy was due to my troubled experience validating certificates on some platforms (keychain, certificate store, etc.) If you can get around those platform issues and skip any chain validation requirements then awesome.\nThanks again for the great project.\n.

Thanks for looking, this issue is invalid.\n. Out ideal flow would look like this:\nMyApp\n|--Production\n|--Staging\n|--Debug / Unstable\nWhere releases would flow from Unstable -> Staging -> Release, so there wouldn't necessarily be a limit of binary versions per deployment. It's trivial to go over the 50 releases for Debug / Unstable & Staging, for Production, 50 should be enough for now, but it's easy to see a future where it isn't.\nIs this a non-standard way of using code-push?\nAdditionally, this ticket is fairly important to support the above flow: https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/issues/267 as the HEAD release on Unstable is often not the release we want to promote to Staging (although Staging HEAD is always the release we want to promote to Production).\nExample:\nIn this example we release periodically to Unstable, but r2 might have a newer fix we want to promote later. As far as I'm aware, this isn't supported by code-push right now? I think if we wanted to promote r2 after r4 is released to Unstable, we'd have to release r2 directly to Staging then promote from there, right?\nAdditionally in this example, there's probably more than 50 builds in between r2 and r4.\n\nLet me know if you need anything else, or have any suggestions for our flow. Thanks!\n. @silhouettes this is blocked by a backend change right now? Or could this be just implemented via CLI / SDK. I have time to take on any changes required in this repository.\n. Was thinking something along the lines of how octokit handles pagination. Disabled by default, you can make subsequent calls to get other pages. Or you can specify an option like paginateByDefault to get everything at once.\n. OK, sounds alright (understood on the resources front :) ). An option for backend is to return \"lightweight\" objects constaining just labels + binaryAppVersions. Then being able to drill down into details from there.\n. @silhouettes the permissions are already set to allow all: drwxrwxrwx for that folder.\n. Nice, I'll test this out.

    "patniko": "Hi @daniel-beard, closing this for now as it has been prioritized on our backlog and is a limitation build into our backend currently. As we continue to move things into Mobile Center we will end up working on this item at some point in the future, but it is currently indeterminate.. Hi @aaronorosen, there are currently no plans to support client side diffing using CodePush today. We have built out an extensive backend to support managing and creating diffs from your releases that would be too difficult to bring into the CLI codebase without introducing a few other serious concerns. Our goal is to consistently deliver valid updates to your target devices and managing diffs on the servers allows us to accomplish this more reliably and secure.. Hi @EddyVerbruggen, we are currently discussing the best option for this PR as there are some concerns regarding how much of the native API NativeScript exposes and the risk of app store removals or rejections when used in conjunction with CodePush. Will let you know once we have decided on the best route to go later on this month. That being said, thanks for the great contribution!. @kayveedw @jdnichollsc In full transparency, we don't feel our React Native and Cordova implementations for CodePush represent the best versions of themselves. We just released the Cordova preview SDK for App Center and are in the process of rewriting the CodePush SDK's to enable better rollback support along with a whole slew of features that have been requested by our current users for some time now. After we finish things up around March we'll revisit this again when we aren't spread so thin.. We're 100% listening. \ud83d\ude4f There are many platforms we'd like to add to CodePush and App Center in general, but we're already stretched a bit thin on support. Rather than enabling just NativeScript we're looking at a more generic option based on target OS rather than the tooling on top so those that want to play around with different options and implementations have the freedom to.. Hi @afilp, if you add your secondary Github account as a collaborator on the application in Mobile Center or through the CLI you can theoretically log in under the other account to manage your CodePush application. We are working on supporting multiple Github accounts in Mobile Center for a single user, but its currently on our future roadmap.. Hi @farwayer, our backend is currently designed to support only a single OS today and there are no current plans in the future to change that. CodePush was recently merged into Mobile Center which requires a specific OS and platform to be set so it can enable additional features that correspond to each setting. We might revisit this down the road, but realistically it would be a mid-to-late 2018 implementation at best with our current roadmap.. Hi @adambene, we are currently working on bringing over all the CodePush commands to the Mobile Center CLI which will have support to list the OS associated with your application. This feature is on our roadmap to be delivered sometime over the next few months.. Hi @Webrusterkk, we are currently bringing over all the CodePush functionality into the Mobile Center CLI which supports deleting applications directly from it. Look out for an announcement sometime over the next few months with details regarding this. It should make managing apps and performing releases a lot more streamlined then it is today with just the CodePush CLI. Thanks!. @Webrusterkk with the exception of performing a release (promote excluded) everything should be able to be accomplished through the Mobile Center UI and CLI. Today you can manage your App using Mobile Center, but it doesn't currently have all the management functions for your deployments and releases. If you need to delete or transfer your application to a different account, logging into the UI is the recommended approach for the moment.. Excellent @ruslan-bikkinin !. Hi @JAStanton, we have been experiencing a few load issues with our production environments. A permanent fix should be implemented over the next 30 days as we finish up the re-architecture of our backend services, but for now we are monitoring the current problems and making adjustments to rectify them.. ",
    "orlando": "Facing this problem too, If we use a range it doesn't update. But if we target the specific version then the update goes through. @patrickomeara so this is not a code-push issue, is how node-semver works. Ranges only works for non pre-release versions. https://github.com/npm/node-semver#prerelease-tags\n\nFor example, the range >1.2.3-alpha.3 would be allowed to match the version 1.2.3-alpha.7, but it would not be satisfied by 3.4.5-alpha.9, even though 3.4.5-alpha.9 is technically \"greater than\" 1.2.3-alpha.3 according to the SemVer sort rules. The version range only accepts prerelease tags on the 1.2.3 version. The version 3.4.5 would satisfy the range, because it does not have a prerelease flag, and 3.4.5 is greater than 1.2.3-alpha.7.\nThe purpose for this behavior is twofold. First, prerelease versions frequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes that are (by the author's design) not yet fit for public consumption. Therefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching semantics.\n\nSo what I did is removing our prerelease tags from our staging environment and just using the same version syntax as production\n\nSo, to recap, if you want to update a version with pre-release tags, then you need to write the exact version you want to update, 1.12.3-beta for example and not a range of something else\n. @sergey-akhalkov this is not an issue, is the expected behavior of node-semver. What we need to do maybe is to put a reference in the code-push documentation, so people understand why they cannot apply range updates to versions with pre-release tags. Thanks @BretJohnson . ",

Hey! \nWe recognize the value of NativeScript support and this is something that is still definitely on our radar.

Hopefully, we can revisit this conversation sometime soon. \ud83d\ude0a. @jdnichollsc Sorry for the delayed response, but unfortunately, I don't have a date quite yet! . Hey noticed you filed this with more information in another post, going to close this! . Hey there! \nSorry for the delayed response, are you still having this issue? . I'm sorry that this is happening. An engineer on the CodePush team recommended this: https://www.npmjs.com/package/code-push-server . Please let me know if this helps! . Hey haven't heard from you in a while! Going to go ahead and close this. Feel free to respond in this thread if you would like to re-open it and discuss this further \ud83d\ude04. I can understand why this is a bit confusing. What we mean by this is the following: A deployment's release history is immutable, but you can use the clear command in order to \"clean up\" your deployment history. Using clear will make it so that your previous release history is no longer visible, but it doesn't affect the app itself. . Ah, you're definitely right. My mistake. This wording is definitely a bit confusing. I think the idea portrayed in the docs is that once you release an update, you can't simply delete it with the idea of taking if off all client devices.  The clear command does, in fact, affect the app because it's preventing these updates that would happen . I will work on updating the documentation to make this a bit more clear. Updated! I hope this helps . Hey there!\nIn AppCenter, apps are technically given two names: name and descriptive name. The name is the name of the app used in URLs and the display name is the descriptive name of the app. I would suggest changing both of these to reflect this new change. This can be done using the appcenter apps update command with the -n flag for name and the -d flag for display name. . Hey! \nThis is something that would be handled by the wider App Center team rather than the CodePush team. I can forward this request to the team. Have you tried a VPN or proxy by chance? . Haven't heard from you! Closing this for now. Feel free to respond on this thread in the future and we can continue this conversation. . Hey there! \nThat website is deprecated. We now use the http://appcenter.ms for CodePush. The privacy policy can be found here: https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement.

    "BretJohnson": "@scott108 Thanks for alerting us to this. We see what the problem is now. We hope to have the fix in place by end of day.. @scott108 We just deployed the fix for this, which looks good in my testing. Thanks again for letting us know about this problem. Please let us know if you see any other issues or have any other feedback in general, now that CodePush is part of Mobile Center  (since Friday).. @farwayer Mobile Center will eventually have better support for cross-platform apps (like with React Native and Xamarin). That's definitely on our backlog, as we've gotten several requests for it, though it's still likely a few months out.\n@iageoghe @panarasi Shorter term, allowing adding apps for multiple platforms at the same time, with a syntax like @farwayer suggests above (while still creating multiple apps, with a suffix, just doing it more automatically) may well make sense as a shortcut for folks. @iageoghe do you want to consider adding this to the backlog; it's probably at least worth a discussion.. @iageoghe Yeah, we could do it from the CLI itself. I would think we'd want to spec & do this (at a minimum) in the Mobile Center CLI.  We probably want other MC PMs to sign off on the naming convention too, just to ensure we are all bought in there.. Unfortunately, Mobile Center doesn't currently support transferring an app to another user, so we removed the CLI option on purpose, as it's not currently supported. User to user app transfer will come later for Mobile Center (soon, I think).\nHowever, Mobile Center does support transferring an app to an organization. And in many cases that's actually a better option for folks, having apps owned by an org instead of an individual. So it may be a good workaround / option for you here.\nHere are the steps, all done from the Mobile Center web UI:\n1. Go to to https://mobile.azure.com and create a new organization for your client (or have them do that).\n2. Invite any other desired users to the org (from the People node there). Once they accept the invite you can change their access permissions. If you make them an admin they can see all apps in the org; otherwise they can only see apps they are specifically a collaborator on.\n3. For the app itself, click on the \"Manage App\" button (top right when on the \"Getting Started\" page for the app). Hit the Transfer button there to transfer to the org. Note that currently this is a one time only operation, so you'll want to make sure this is the real org for your client when transferring as you can't currently transfer to a different org after.\nHopefully, the above steps will meet your needs well here. Holler with any questions or problems, with those steps or really anything with CodePush in Mobile Center.\n. Adding @iageoghe here too, as we should ideally document the steps above, for others.. @duranmla Thanks for the feedback. A few notes:\n- We'll fix the doc; thanks for alerting us to that. Now, in this scenario, you do need to create the \"standard\" deployments manually, which you can do via code-push deployment add <app-name> --default.  There will also be web UI for this (visible soon).\n- As for code-push deployment ls <OrganizationName>android not working, that looks like a bug. I'll look at fixing that too, shortly. But for now you can just do this instead and it should work:  code-push deployment ls android.  It'll search all apps you have access to (for all orgs or whatever) to match.\n- Also a note on the naming convention:  Conceptually, an organization can contain a bunch of apps. The typical convention we'd expect there is that the org name is a company name or team name, but it doesn't really matter. But anyway, for the app naming convention we typically use (and suggest in the doc) something like MyApp-Android instead of just android, so that the org can ultimately contain several apps, not just that one. But again, that's just a convention thing and doesn't matter technically.. Hi.  I'll mention a couple things here:\nWe'll have a fix for the slash issue shortly, late today or tomorrow. But until it's deployed, the workaround is that instead of doing: this:\n    code-push deployment add <OrganizationName>/client-android --default\ndo this:\n    code-push deployment add client-android --default\nAnd as long as you don't have multiple apps (say in different orgs) named the same, client-android, it will find the app in the question, under OrganizationName, and update it.\nAs for the app secrets & CodePush deployment key, let me ask:  Is the app in customer hands already where you can't change the CodePush deployment key inside of it?  If so, you'll want to transfer the existing app to the new org, not create a new app, to keep the app ID (and CodePush deployment keys) the same.  But if a changed deployment key isn't a proplem, then it's fine to create a new app, just make sure the deployment keys inside of it match what's actually stamped into the CodePush client app and also ensure the Mobile Center app secret match what's in the client, once you start to do integration with the Mobile Center SDK outside of CodePush (optional, but needed to get other Mobile Center features like crashes & analytics).. @duranmla Sounds good. And we're about ready to update the doc to use the text below. If you have any feedback on this text, let us know.\nOwnership Transfer\nThe update to version 2.0.0.0 saw the removal of the app transfer commmand. You may still transfer ownership of your applications by managing it through an organization. This requires that you visit Mobile Center and execute a few steps.\n\nGo to to https://mobile.azure.com and create a new organization.\nInvite the person you to whom you wish to transfer the app to the organization. Once they have accepted the invitation change their access permissions to \"Admin\".\nNavigate to your app and click on the \"Manage App\" button (top right when on the \"Getting Started\" page for the app). Hit the Transfer button there to transfer the app to the org. Note that currently this operation cannot be reversed, although this will change in the future.\nOnce your invitee has accepted, select the organization that you created and remove yourself from it.. @duranmla I just published a CLI update (v2.0.1-beta) which fixes the slash in app name problem. Please update to the latest CLI with npm install -g code-push-cli@latest and let us know if you see any other issues here. We also made the doc improvement above, here https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/tree/master/cli, better explaining the org workaround for app transfer going away.. I should have mentioned this earlier, but a few days ago we did indeed have a bug where Windows support didn't work, but that got fixed early this week. So I'm pretty sure this is fixed & I'm going to go ahead and close it.  But @TheAdamizer please let us know if you see any other issues.. @Z0mBee - Thanks for reporting this. We found the problem and I believe we'll have a fix deployed in a few hours. I'll update this issue when the fix is deployed.. @Z0mBee - We've deployed the fix now. Can you please try again (you'll have to recreate the access key) and ensure all looks good for you now.. @sergey-akhalkov Can you test and see if this applies to Mobile Center in general, not being able to login after changing primary GitHub email. I wonder if there are any workarounds there.\n\nIf it's not a Mobile Center issue, it'd be good to understand how they handle this scenario. And if it is an issue there, it's probably worth discussing in #sonoma-portal how we should handle it in the future.. Hi. Thanks for the feedback. We'll look at updating the CLI text and doc here to make this clearer, as I agree it can be confusing. I'll leave this issue open for now until we fix that.. Ian suggested this message:\nCollaborator invitation email for <appName> sent to <email>\"\ninstead of \"Successfully added <userEmail> as a collaborator to the app <appName>.\nWill deploy an update soon with this.. I just published an updated CLI (2.0.1-beta) that contains the improved add collaborator message above. Thanks for the feedback here, @mikehazell.. All - Is everything ok now? We did have a site outage, for like 25 minutes or so, at the time you were seeing this, so that's surely the cause. But let us know if you see any other issues.. @joeferraro - The label itself can't be changed. You can only use it to specify the particular release that you want to update other fields on.\n@iageoghe - We could probably improve the usability here somehow, as it seems a bit confusing at first. I wonder if Label is really the best name for this thing. Maybe Release Number or something instead. We should at least improve the error message above.. @PawelWesolowski Thanks for the feedback here. Yes, in Mobile Center access keys (which Mobile Center calls API Token elsewhere in the UI, like under user settings in the web UI), never expire currently. Mobile Center might add support for expiring tokens in the future, but it's not there currently. Also the tokens currently can't be renamed once created, in Mobile Center. So patch went away.\nWe'll update the doc. I'll keep this issue open until we do. Thanks again for the report.. This is a good suggestion.\n@iageoghe I'm thinking we do it (at a a minimum) in the Mobile Center CLI. Would be handy for non-RN apps as well. Though having a standard OS suffix on app names lessens the need for this, still good to have.\n. ",

    "freakinruben": "@max-mironov Thanks for the quick reply and I understand your concerns.\n\nIMHO when sourcemapOutput is left unspecified and you use outputDir parameter the most desirable result for most part of the users would be to generate source maps by default to output folder.\n\nI can't speak for most users, but personally I would prefer to only have a sourcemap generated if I explicitly set the option. That way setting the outputFolder doesn't influence source-map generation and users that do want the source-map can still have it. This is also more similar to what react-native bundle does if I'm not mistaken. \nBut I also understand that such a change would possibly break the configuration of existing users, so maybe adding a flag to disable source-maps would be another solution, similar to --noDuplicateReleaseError flag. Sure, we can see if there are more users who are looking for the option to disable source-maps.\n@max-mironov Would it be possible to change the labels on the issue to something like proposal instead of question?. ",
    "kimak": "I'm also interested on this proposal. In my app, sourcemap size is 15MB vs 4MB source code. \nThe result is one update is very heavy for the user. \nI think to make a patch inside the lib but it would be cool to have an option. ",

    "newyankeecodeshop": "Yes @sergey-akhalkov that is the same issue. I see that is how semver works, but why doesn't the CodePush server convert 2.3 to 2.3.0 before passing the value to the semver logic? That is what your documentation says and also is a more appropriate behavior for CodePush, don't you think? As your documentation also states, a semver range expression can be used, so if the developer's intent is to have a bundle apply to all patch versions of a binary, it can be expressed explicitly.. I guess my argument is that, if a customer wants to apply his update to 2.0.x, why not require them to publish with 2.0.x? I agree there is a change in behavior, but the current behavior does not follow the documentation.\nUpdating the documentation would be helpful.. @max-mironov Did CodePush or App Center recently change how applications are named? Our apps used to be named without an owner (e.g. \"UpserveLive-Android\") but recently when I do code-push app list the names are prefixed with our organization \"Upserve\" (e.g. \"Upserve/UpersveLive-Android\"). Our CLI scripts that reference the app name without the owner prefix now fail:\n```\n\ncode-push deployment ls UpserveLive-Android\n[Error]  App \"UpserveLive-Android\" does not exist.\n```\n\nIs this new documented behavior? I can't find any documentation about this change.\n. ",

Hi @ray-shawn ,\nThanks for reporting!\nIf you mean examples for code-push cli commands you can find examples in cli with --help option.\nFor example if you would like to find examples for promote command you should run code-push promote --help and you will see detailed descriptions of options and examples for using this command.\nPlease let me know if it was helpful or this examples isn't enough or you have more questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @ray-shawn,\nUnfortunately I'm going to close this issue as I haven't heard from you in a while.\nPlease feel free to reopen it or open one more if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @zxccvvv ,\nThanks for reporting!\nCould you please double check that your deployment name is correct and existing?\nAlso could you please run code-push deployment ls <AppName> and share your output?\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @1104931825 ,\nThanks for reporting!\nI'm not sure about some blockers in China but we have some developers from China.\nPossible the reason of issue can be in other things.\nCould you please share logs, configuration for CodePush, platform, OS, and other info which can help us to find the reason of issue? \nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @devjackcat,\nI'm going to close this issue as we haven't heard from you in a while unfortunately. \nPlease feel free to reopen it if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @syq7970 ,\nThanks for reporting!\nThis error has occurred because code-push release-react command use react-native bundle command and it should run in root of project. You should use code-push release command if you would like to release already generated bundle.\nCould you please clarify more detailed about your case? Would you like to use CodePush for Non react-native app but just for React-native module in your app?\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @syq7970 ,\nSorry for long delay.\nYeah, Got it. code-push release-react command is used for bundling app from root of app. code-push release is used for more flexible case to release updates.  I think that for your case is best solution is just use manually bundling command and then code-push release for this generated bundle. For this command please check more info in docs: https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/tree/master/cli#releasing-updates-general\nPlease let me know if it was helpful or you have more questions?\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @syq7970 ,\nUnfortunately, I'm going to close this issue for now as I haven't heard from you in a while.\nPlease feel free to reopen it if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @angly-cat ,\nThanks for reporting!\nThis is deprecated docs. Please use Github docs:  https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#supported-react-native-platforms and Microsoft AppCenter docs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/codepush/react-native#supported-react-native-platforms\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander . @angly-cat, Links to old docs was changed with link to new docs. Also, all old docs pages will be redirected to new docs soon. I'm going to keep this open until it's done.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.. Hi @angly-cat \nImplemented redirect logic. You can check just visit old docs. For example: http://microsoft.github.io/code-push/docs/react-native.html#link-1\nYou should be redirected to docs.microsoft.com site.\nSo, as issue was resolved I'm going to close this issue for now. Please feel free to reopen it if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @northkode ,\nThanks for reporting!\nIt is looks like this Cordova issue: https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/issues/424\nIf you use clear Cordova with WkWebView plugin you can use work around which provided in that issue. Fix for this issue in repo will be soon as it should be improved.\nIf you have other env or you have something to add could you please provide it in that issue to keep all info about this issue in one place. https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/issues/424\nAlso, I'm going to close this issue as this is duplicate of https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push/issues/424\nPlease let me know if you any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @surendharreddy ,\nThanks for contributing!\nGood catch!. Hi @dc165015 \nThanks for reporting!\nCould you please open this issue in cordova-plugin-code-push  with this issue template?\nThis additional information helps us understand this issue.. Hi @gagangoku ,\nThanks for reporting!\nCould you please provide more details about your report? And what is your issue or questions?\nAs It isn't clear for now with provided info =)\nThanks,\nAlexander. Oh, I see. Got it. Thanks for filling this! :)\n. Hi @gagangoku,\nYour app already added to friend page. Congratulations!\nhttps://microsoft.github.io/code-push/community/friends.html \nSo, I'm going to close this issue. Please feel free to reopen it if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander\n. Answered in new issue: https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/issues/596. Hi @diegowifi,\nThanks for reporting!\nI reproduced your issue and confirm that this changes fix it without affecting other browsers.. Hi @buddhamangler ,\nThanks for reporting!\nCould you please clarify are you using React-native or Cordova?. oh, Yeah. It is known issue about release command with private key. \nI recommend to use appcenter cli as this issues should be fixed there.\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/appcenter-cli\nAlso, Code-Push cli will be deprecated soon.\nPlease let me know if it was helpful or you have any questions.. Hi @pereiraIgor ,\nThanks for contributing!\nThanks for adding this link.. Hi @gagangoku,\nYeah, possible we can just remove text and keep just logo without text for keeping similarity with other app? What do you think about it?. Hi @gagangoku,\nYeah, I had to do so for adding new image(as you just added empty border and framework didn't find diff between this 2 images).\nAt now all looks like great :)\nPlease check it here and let me know: https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/community/friends.html \n. Thanks for providing this additional info :). Hi @Nits7029 ,\nThanks for reporting!\nI'm afraid it isn't possible to rollback removing deployment. So, you should create new binary version with new deployment key and update app in store.\nSorry for this.\nPlease let me know if it was helpful or you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @Nits7029,\nI'm going to close this issue for now as I haven't heard from you in a while unfortunately.\nPlease feel free to reopen it if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @jay1337 ,\nThanks for reporting!\nWe have 2 CLIs for now. It is code-push cli and appcenter cli. You are using docs for appcenter cli. Please ensure that you have access key from appcenter cli.\nPlease let me know if it was helpful or you still have issue.\nThanks,\nAlexander\n. Hi @jay1337 ,\nDocs are updated: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/codepush/node#getting-started\nSo, I think that issue was resolved and I'm going to close this issue for now. Please feel free to reopen it if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @monicse09ku ,\nThanks for reporting!\nCodePush doesn't update binary version. It just replaced js part of app.\nAbout binary versions: CodePush has target version setting which allow install current release only for current binary version of app. Foe example if you app is 1.0.2 and you make release with target version is 1.0.3 then your update should be ignored. For updating your 1.0.2 version app you should release update with 1.0.2 target version\nCould you please share command which you used for releasing update?\nThanks,\nAlexander. @monicse09ku  Could you please provide logs during update?\nYou can grab it with AndroidStudio/adb logcat or XCode.\nAlso, I noticed from your duplicate issue that you used release-react command. This command use current project binary version as target version by default.. You should make one more release with target version as *. It allows to install release on all versions. But be careful with this approach as you had some binary changes behaviour can be unexpected.\nJust add --targetBinaryVersion * to your release-react command.\nPlease let me know if it was helpful or you have any questions. That's great! Thanks for keeping us in touch!\nAs issues was resolved I'm going to close this issue for now.\nPlease feel free to reopen it if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @monicse09ku :)\nIt looks like there is some issue and then calling rollback of your update. Could you please share logs during update?\n. I see that you opened new issue in react-native-code-push repo: https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/1504\nLet's continue our conversation there.. Hi @luisnaranjo733 ,\nThanks for reporting!\nWe will investigate this issue a bit later. It is in queue. Sorry for this delay.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @luisnaranjo733,\nSorry for delay.\nI tested your case and successfully get app. Here is my commands:\n```\nC:\\Proj\\testManagemendSDK>appcenter tokens create -d \"testManagementSDK\"\nID:          [ID]\nAPI Token:   [API Token]\nDescription: testManagementSDK\nCreated at:  2018-12-15T09:33:52.000Z\nC:\\Proj\\testManagemendSDK>npm install code-push --save\n\ncode-push@2.0.6\nupdated 1 package and audited 698 packages in 2.532s\nfound 0 vulnerabilities\n\nC:\\Proj\\testManagemendSDK>node\n\nvar CodePush = require(\"code-push\");\nundefined\nvar codePush = new CodePush(\"[API Token]\");\nundefined\ncodePush.getApp(\"test10\").then(app => console.log(JSON.stringify(app))).catch(error => console.log(Error: ${JSON.stringify(error)}));\n{ state: 'pending' }\n{\"name\":\"test10\",\"collaborators\":{\"v-algonc\":{\"isCurrentAccount\":true,\"permission\":\"Owner\"}},\"deployments\":[\"Production\",\"Staging\"]}\nvar testapp = codePush.getApp(\"test10\");\nundefined\ntestapp\n{ state: 'fulfilled',\n  value:\n   { name: 'test10',\n     collaborators: { 'v-algonc': [Object] },\n     deployments: [ 'Production', 'Staging' ] } }\n```\n\nPlease check my command and try to run similar commands. Also, please check that you put API_Token(not ID) in CodePush constructor(new CodePush(\"[API Token]\");).\nPlease let me know if it was helpful or you have any questions or I missed something.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @luisnaranjo733,\nI'm going to close this issue for now as I haven't heard from you in a while unfortunately.\nPlease feel free to reopen it if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @DylanBruzenak ,\nThanks for reporting!\nYeah, I see. I need more time for running some tests about this and then I let you know my results and fix docs. Sorry for this delay.\nThanks,\nAlexander\n. Hi @DylanBruzenak,\nSorry for delay.\nAbout this note: I just tested and found that all works as describes in this note. \nHere is my test steps:\n\nInstall binary version on device 1.3. (Note says that it should be equals to 1.3.0)\nMake new release with target version as '1.3.2`.\nTried to update - unsuccessful.  Logs says that: An update is available but it is not targeting the binary version of your app.\nMake new release with target version as 1.3.0.\nTried to update - successfully update.\n\nIt means that binary version is 1.3.0.\nPlease note that this Note is about only binary version. Not about release target version.\nBut from other side converting 1.3 to 1.3.X is true for releases as target version field is just interval of targeting versions. For example if binary version is 1.3.2 then release with target version of 1.3 should be installed.\nSo, I think that this note is correct and shouldn't be deleted.\nPlease let me know if it was helpful or I missed something or you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @NicolasSchwarzer ,\nThanks for reporting!\nIt is interesting questions. \nAt first just small clarification:\nCodePush can change only js part of your app and assets. CodePush can not change any binary files.\nCodePush has -t|--target-binary-version option for providing binary version of your app. If users's app has other binary version than you provided in this option then this update will be ignored.\nIn your case when you update your RN version you should make new binary apk/ipa file and provide it to your users as new version of RN can contains some changes in native code part(like Java or Objective-c).\nSo, the main idea is if CodePush updates contains releases with different RN version then it should be target to different binary version.\nCould you please let me know if it was helpful and make sense for you or you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander . Hi @aleafo,\nThanks for reporting!\nUnfortunately there isn't any approach to revert removing of deployment or specify deployment key as it can break consistency. I'm sorry for that.\nAlso, in the future you can remove all releases from deployment(without removing deployment and deployment key) with clear command like this: code-push deployment clear myApp Staging.  After that you still can use old deployment key and make new releases in this old deployment.\nPlease let me know if it was helpful or you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @cpbmm,\nThanks for reporting!\nI just tested your case and successfully got API token. Could you please ensure that you logged in correct GitHub or Microsoft account and let me know your results?\nThanks,\nAlexander. oh, I see. Thanks for getting us in touch!\nSo, I'm going to close this issue for now. But please feel free to reopen it if you have any questions!. Hi @littlehome-eugene,\nThanks for reporting!\nI'm sorry but could you please describe your issue more detailed?\nDefault settings for mandatory update is codePush.InstallMode.IMMEDIATE.\n\nAre there some suggestions where to look when mandatory update doesn't seem to work for every device? \n\nNo, Mandatory update should affect some device for installing. All devices should be updated.\nCould you please clarify are there some rollbacks or just devices don't try to take updates?\n . Hi @littlehome-eugene,\nI'm going to close this issue for now as I haven't heard from you in a while unfortunately.\nPlease feel free to reopen it if you have any questions.\nThanks,\nAlexander. Hi @thecachedbyte ,\nThanks for reporting!\nWe have several issues like this with rejecting apps by Apple(for example https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push/issues/1297 and others in that issue) but we are not aware if any apps were rejected due to code-push usage itself as CodePush functionality fully allowed by Apple. Please check this section: https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#store-guideline-compliance\nPlease let me know if it was helpful or you have any questions.\n. Hi @thecachedbyte,\nSorry for delay.\nHave you got reply from Apple team about this rejection?. @barryvdh, Yeah, we also got reports about it in Cordova. Cordova CodePush plugin and React-Native CodePush plugin work same and changed only JSbundle for React-Native and html-css-js for Cordova which fully allowed by Apple but yeah, sometimes reject for unknown reasons.. Hi @barryvdh,\nYeah, thanks for reporting and closing after fix!. Hi @cbrwizard,\nThanks for reporting!\nSorry for this delay. We will fix a bit later as soon as possible.\nI'll keep this issue open until all vulnerability are fixed.. Hi @HighSoftWare96,\nThanks for reporting!\nCodePush doesn't have this functionality but you can create your own automate script.\nFor release update you should just use console command and you can call it in automate script in case which you need.\nPlease let me know if it was helpful or you have any questions.. Could you please add whitespace before string word for keeping code style? \nIt should be like so: deploymentName: string. ",
    "MrLoh": "Hi @ruslan-bikkinin thanks for your answer. Unfortunately simply naming a config file metro.config.js doesn't solve the issue since the packager is started from ./node_modules/react-native/local-cli/cli.js and not from the current working directory so a config file added to the project root isn't read. Of course the code-push script could check for such a file to pass it automatically through the --config flag. . I guess that\u2019s a workaroudn at least. would it really be so bad to add support for metro config files. I understand you don't want to overload the client, but it's pretty standard that config files are supported, it's just because of metros weird setup from calling the binary from inside the node modules that the config file isn't picked up. .

The documentation says \"client devices configured to receive updates using its associated deployment key will no longer receive the updates that have been cleared\". I would call that affecting the app, since it's preventing updates that would otherwise have taken place.\nIn any case, I think what you're saying is this: The goal of the clear command is aesthetic, to clean up the list of deployments shown when you run code-push deployment history. A side effect of doing that is that the clients can no longer see those cleared releases, which is why you should never do this in production.\nIf that's right, then my suggestion is to state the purpose of clear more explicitly in the documentation..

    "DylanBruzenak": "Thanks for looking into it. \nOne further thing I noticed: 1.4.0 targeted distributions don\u2019t seem to patch 1.4 app versions, which means the only way to push to an app with 1.4 (not 1.4.0) in the plist seems to be to push a 1.4 distribution... which patches 1.4.x. Which effectively means you can\u2019t use minor versions for all of 1.4 if you make the mistake of leaving the minor version off when you ship a binary to the App Store.\nIf it matters I\u2019m testing iOS only at the moment.. I\u2019ll have to double check 1.4.0 not patching 1.4, as we are going through version churn. Maybe I installed the wrong one. Ignore that note for now, I\u2019ll open a separate bug if it happens again.\nOtherwise, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being clear above. The problem isn\u2019t how it works, it is how it is documented.\nIf you leave out the target binary version from the code deploy command and have a plist entry of 1.2 you will get a codepush distribution that targets 1.2.x and is listed as targeting 1.2 in the codepush metadata. The binary will be seen on the server as 1.2.0. When you naturally distribute a 1.2.1 binary it will be a complete surprise that it gets patched by your 1.2 distribution. You may not have even read the target binary section as you are not using that parameter. You will end up with old code on top of the new binary and it will break things.\nIf you\u2019re lucky enough to be reading the github doc instead of the app center doc, which is entirely missing the 1.2 == >=1.2.0 < 1.3.0 line, you may be able to puzzle through this. But that note doesn\u2019t make anything clearer because it doesn\u2019t say WHEN it treats it as 1.2.0. It treats it as 1.2 for the client and distribution and treats it as 1.2.0 when checking to see if it should be patched, but it could be saying \u201cI see 1.2 in the plist, i\u2019m going to assume you mean 1.2.0, so that\u2019s what we\u2019ll patch, that\u2019s what we are targeting with the metadata\u201d. And if you\u2019re on the app center doc the table doesn\u2019t list this case so when you see 1.2 in the distribution metadata it doesn\u2019t ring an alarm bell.\nThere are a couple of ways to prevent users from making this error: \n\nThe client should read 1.2 in the plist as 1.2.0 (like it implied in the note in the note) and then create a distribution that explicitly targets 1.2.0. That\u2019s what people expect, they don\u2019t expect that the default plist reading will see 1.2 and think, \u201cI want to patch every future version of this binary too!\u201d... only a machine would ever think that was reasonable.\nIt could warn when creating the distribution that without 3 numbers in the version the handling of the version number might not match what you expect\nThe meta data could have a (targeting version >= 1.2.0 < 1.3) printed out explicitly so that you can catch this reading the metadata and not assume 1.2 is equivalent\nThis note should be changed to read \u201cbinary version\u201d instead of \u201cAppStore metadata version\u201d to be consistent with the rest of the doc. \nThe note could mention that 1.2 in the plist will be interpreted as 1.2.0 for purposes of determine whether to patch that version of the binary,  but this is separate from the handling of the target binary version parameter, which matches the table above. If you are using 1.2 in target binary version you will patch ANY 1.2. Being explicit here will help reduce confusion between the note and the table and help people who have to figure this stuff out at 2 am because customers are suddenly crashing after a codepush build sending versions out unexpectedly.\nThe ms app center note MUST match this documentation as on their own right now they are only part of the story and don\u2019t cover the 1.2 metadata version case at all.\n\nNot all of these would have to be done, probably you could just improve the doc around this section and the automatic version detection section to explicitly cover this case.\nI understand that the instinct may be to leave well enough alone here, but the potential consequences of deploying the wrong version are quite bad. You can say \u201cthey should have read the doc more carefully\u201d... but it\u2019s always on the doc to be clear, and it isn\u2019t here (and is outright missing important info on appcenter).\nI hope this makes sense.
