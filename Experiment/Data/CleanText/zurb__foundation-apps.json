My main issue with this current alpha is that rather than coding the framework with mixins and then applying the mixins to the CSS classes, it's all CSS classes.\nLet me make a simple example.\n``` scss\n.frame {\n  margin: 0;\n  height: 100vh;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-flow: row nowrap;\n&.stack, &.small-stack {\n    flex-flow: column nowrap;\n  }\n&.unstack, &.small-unstack {\n    flex-flow: row nowrap;\n  }\n@media #{$medium-up} {\n    &.medium-stack { flex-flow: column nowrap; }\n    &.medium-unstack { flex-flow: row nowrap; }\n  }\n  @media #{$large-up} {\n    &.large-stack { flex-flow: column nowrap; }\n    &.large-unstack { flex-flow: row nowrap; }\n  }\n}\n```\nThis block of code comes from the _grid.scss file within the source. To me it would make sense to write this as a set of mixin called frame, stack and unstack and then apply those to the .frame/.stack and .unstack classes. Something like.\n``` scss\n@mixin frame($margin:0, $height:100vh, $wrap:nowrap) {\n  margin: $margin;\n  height: $height;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-flow: row $wrap;\n}\n@mixin stack($wrap:nowrap) {\n  flex-flow: column $wrap\n}\n@mixin unstack($wrap:nowrap) {\n  flex-flow: row $wrap;\n}\n.frame {\n  @include frame;\n&.stack, &.small-stack {\n    @include stack;\n  }\n&.unstack, &.small-unstack {\n    @include unstack;\n  }\n@media #{$medium-up} {\n    &.medium-stack { @include stack; }\n    &.medium-unstack { @include unstack; }\n  }\n  @media #{$large-up} {\n    &.large-stack { @include stack; }\n    &.large-unstack { @include unstack; }\n  }\n}\n```\nI do agree though we have kind of taken this issue off-topic (apologies Zurb people!) but I really like Foundation and wasn't sure where else to make the comments.

I'm going to assume that two principles from previous versions of Foundation remain the same:\n- Faster to code\n- Faster to learn\nBased on these principles and experience I think presentational classes are useful for faster prototyping and faster learning.\nFrom experience I find coding a quick prototype is quicker with presentational classes. I don't have to delve straight into Sass because I don't need to yet. I'm just doing a quick prototype and not the actual production site.\nAlso for learning, presentational classes help new users to Foundation to grasp the idea of responsive web design (if they haven't already) and helps them visualize and build sites with Foundation.\nHowever I agree that presentational classes are lazy to a certain extent. That extent goes as far as the production site. A production site definitely cannot have presentational classes.\nFoundation also focuses in semantics as well.

I agree that Foundation 6 should have more focus on Sass. Looking at the current documentation for Foundation 5, I do think there is a heavy focus on CSS, with only a small section on Sass at the end of each page.\nPerhaps to solve that problem two version of documentation are produced. One version for Foundation with CSS and one version for Foundation with Sass. However I realize that there may be difficulties maintaining two versions of documentation.\nSo to conclude what is probably my longest GitHub comment, mixins and extends are 100% the way forward and should be used in production sites, however for prototyping and learning CSS classes are extremely useful so should be kept.\nPS As you can see I'm basing most opinion on experience of Foundation 5, however I think the principle still stands no matter what front-end framework you are using.\nPPS Sorry if it's slightly off topic from the discussion of vertical grids.\n. @wldcordeiro Yes, certainly writing it similar to that would be great.

    "gakimball": "We currently have a class to switch from horizontal to vertical, but masonry is definitely an interesting idea. One goal of the grid is to sort of wrap up the complexity of flexbox in a handful of easy to understand classes. So if the user could switch from horizontal to vertical to masonry, with options for even spacing and so on, that would be great!\n. We're about to redo a large chunk of this repo to incorporate the Angular stuff that's in development, so this probably won't be relevant after that.\n. We're using a handful of new features in Sass 3.3 and 3.4, so you'll need your Sass gem up to date to get everything working. We don't plan on having libsass support for the time being.\n. If you can, I'd recommend upgrading to at least Sass 3.3, which adds support for the !global keyword but doesn't actually change how variable scope works. 3.4 implements the changes to variable scope.\nThe changes from 3.2 to 3.3 shouldn't break your codebase or any libraries you use.\nEdit: just realized this issue is in the Foundation for Apps repo. This library requires 3.4, while Foundation 5 requires at least 3.3 but we recommend 3.4.\n. Are y'alls having an issue with Foundation 5? This repo is for Foundation for Apps, which is still in alpha.\nBut we are indeed having issues with Sass compatibility right now in Foundation 5 due to a very small disparity between Sass 3.4 and libsass. See this discussion.\n. Looks good, thanks! Although you spelled ZURB wrong ;)\n. Are you running Sass 3.4 and Compass 1.0?\n. We updated the readme to note that you need Sass 3.4 to make this all work.\n. You guys are the best, thanks so much for your input! To respond to a few points brought up here:\nUsing maps for their map-ness: As Hugo and Ben said, the main reason we'd want to use arrays is to loop through their values, or perhaps be able to call variable variables. We're definitely using maps to make managing breakpoints more flexible; it makes outputting those small-, medium- etc. classes more manageable. I had also messed around with putting CSS properties in maps and then outputting them with a mixin, but it seems too restrictive. The map can't reference other values in the map because it's not done being created yet, you can't add mixins, and so on. Maps have also been useful for a lot of little things, like outputting values in mixins based on user input.\nThe thing we're getting hung up on is where using maps gets us structure, but not utility. A few of you touched on this point. Ultimately grouping all button settings into one variable is nice because it gives our code a little more structure, but we would never need to iterate through the values of that map, and we would never need to dynamically access any value in the map. So that means the map exists purely for structure.\nThe map accessing syntax: As a few of you mentioned, the difference between $button-background and foundation(button, background) is almost nil in terms of remembering, but perhaps our audience will better understand what's happening with a variable. The average user of Sass probably understands (or in my opinion, only needs to understand) nesting, variables, partials, and maybe mixins and a few other things. Those core concepts get you most of the awesome functionality out of Sass, and they're relatively easy concepts to pick up. If you're a library author, then you understand all the more complicated bits, like functions, lists, maps, and so on.\nWe don't usually assume our audience understands the complexities behind our tools. (And that's not meant to be an insult, we just want our framework to be accessible!) The theory behind tools like Foundation and Bootstrap is that you can prototype a website without writing any CSS. With Foundation for Apps we're taking that a step further: you can protoype a single page web app without writing any JavaScript. Abstracting complexity is the name of the game here. Of course, it's not cutting advanced users out of the loop; if you know Angular you'll be able to take something from static prototype to functioning web app.\nAnd that brings us back to the point that the map access syntax is awkward. By using maps in this library we're passing along a bit of the complexity of maps on to the user in some small way. Of course they don't have to directly manipulate maps, but they have to access them using the map syntax, which is awkward, even for people who know what they're doing. I think accessing arrays in an entirely functional manner is just super weird, but I guess I understand why Sass was written that way.\nThere are also some little things that make maps a hassle. For example, we often have variables that are interdependent to make theming a little easier.\nscss\n$button-background: $primary-color;\n$button-text-color: if(lightness($button-background) > 50%, #000, #fff);\nYou can't do this in a map, because you can't reference another place in the map while it's still being defined.\nscss\n$button: (\n  background: $primary-color,\n  color: map-get($button, background), // Nope\n);\nThe solution we land on will probably be a more balanced approach to the \"super map\" I was discussing initially. If we use maps for components, each component might get a separate map. There's still an issue of access, though, and I think this syntax would be really awkward for users:\nscss\ncolor: map-get($f-button, color);\nAlso I'm now going to try to wrap this up so I can stop typing. We're trying to figure out a solution soon, so just picking one will be more useful than our team endlessly speculating about different solutions. It doesn't even affect how we develop our components that much, it more affects how our users manipulate them. And I don't know that our users have ever run into problems with our variables interfering with other libraries, so if we just stuck with the \"old way\" of a million variables in a well-organized list, I don't know that people would complain.\nBut thank you so much @HugoGiraudel, @xzyfer, @Undistraction, and @benfrain for giving your input!\n. @AshleyAitken I think some settings will definitely use maps, like breakpoints. It makes outputting, say, visibility classes here way easier, and adding new breakpoints would be super simple. Component settings are the bigger concern. Let's say three big benefits of having arrays are structure, looping, and variable access. For component settings, you only get the first benefit, not the other two. There would never be a need to write an @each loop for button settings, nor would accessing the properties dynamically ever be useful. So you mostly get the benefit of hierarchy, and the question is if that benefit is worth the overhead.\n. @Undistraction I think I know what you're getting at when it comes to defining versus setting configuration. There's a question of usage, also.\nWe know our users are way into the settings file. A common criticism of front-end frameworks is that they're hard to override, so our settings file makes theming the framework components easier.\nSo setting variables is a common practice for our user. But accessing variables is probably a less common practice. There are common ones that people use a lot, like $primary-color or $column-gutter. It's mostly the more high-level settings that allow you to keep your designs aligned with the framework that people use a lot. But, for example, I doubt people often reference $topbar-dropdown-link-color in their custom CSS. They might set that variable to customize the framework, but they'll never reference it again.\n. @DerFrenk You make a good point, although we can't quite assume people are using an IDE with our library. But you're definitely right, since the accessor syntax is a function, an IDE can't intelligently make suggestions for you.\n. @viztastic Since we had this initial discussion, we have found maps to be most useful when used for a very specific purpose. Being able to write loops to output certain classes is super nice. It's especially going to make editing and adding new breakpoints super easy.\nThe variable dump solution isn't ideal, but it's still going to be easiest for our users to wrap their heads around. As for namespacing, we haven't encountered many conflicts with other libraries, although it's possible that really generic mixins and functions can fight with each other.\n. Did you run bower install to get the dependencies?\nEdit: Looks like that postinstall thing that runs bower install automatically disappeared from our package.json. So yeah, that might be your issue.\n. For sure, the repo is undergoing major surgery right now but it'll be back in soon.\n. Back in as of fd18b286fd9d15088e5da7b4ae054f34d6d7ebee.\n. Looks hot! Brandon and I will talk about how we want to shift over our docs pages. There's only a handful of essential ones, but they don't really fit into a single template right now.\nEdit: And of course eventually they'll go away in favor of actual documentation.\n. It'll probably help if we're more explicit about how we want the modal to work. Brandon and I are still learning Angular so the technical bits are still over our heads ;) But there are some specifics related to functionality we didn't get into.\nIn general, I don't think we're going to leverage any of the templating features of custom elements. (I don't think you implemented any of that but just so you know.) In general, layout components like grid blocks, modals, panels, and off-canvas are meant to handle basically any HTML, so I think we just want the fancy tags.\nFor components that have interactivity (i.e. modals, but not buttons), we need the basic functionality to be plug-and-play. So if you drop in the right HTML, it just works, and if you want to dive into advanced configuration (i.e. programmatically opening a modal, or adding an onOpen event listener) you have to write actual JS. It would also be great if we could mask as much of the event handling stuff as possible. So for example, where you have:\nhtml\n<span href=\"#\" class=\"close-button\" ng-click=\"dismiss()\">&times;</span>\nIt would be great if the click event was attached automatically instead of being an attribute here.\nI talked with Brandon and we decided for now, modals should work like this:\n- Modals have to sit on the page they're being called in, kinda like how they work in Foundation 5. Ideally the user has the choice between doing that and referencing an external partial, that would be loaded in when the modal is triggered.\n- Triggering a modal doesn't change the route, and there's no animation configuration yet.\nSo here's an example of what we would like the HTML itself to look like.\n``` html\n Modal trigger \nOpen Modal\n Modal \n\n Modal content \n\n```\nThe idea being if you write this code, the plugin just works. Like I said, Brandon and I are still in the learning process, so we still need to learn how Angular directives differ from your usual JavaScript plugin, which is what we're used to working with.\nLet us know if you have any questions.\n. For now the code is separated by \"this is library code\" (at the root) \"this is stuff the user would edit\" (client/assets). I know it looks odd, but it was meant to be a stopgap measure. I was curious to get your thoughts on this too, like how we eventually distribute the code.\nWe thought it would be cool to distribute the code as the repo itself, so you could just clone it and get going. In this case everything would be inside the client folder. The problem is that it makes it kind of a hassle to update, because to update the core library you'd have to download new files and cut and paste them over the old ones (or we'd automate that with the CLI we eventually build), unless you can think of a clever way to handle versioning and updating.\nThe other option, which mimics how Foundation 5 works, is that we separate the library code and the stack into separate repos. (Admittedly this is how it was set up before.) So to create a project you clone the stack and then install the library code using Bower. This makes updating a lot easier, and also keeps the library files out of version control. If we go this route, we can quickly set it up by (force) pushing all the code on this repo back into foundation-angular, and stripping out the library code and using Bower to install the Sass and JS from this repo.\nAlso whichever route we take, we'll write a CLI in node that handles it all for the user; it's just a matter of how we handle it.\n. Yeah all the Angular directives would be part of the library stuff as well. So the Foundation Bower package would deliver the scss and js folders, along with all of our other dependencies.\nMaybe we could eventually also condense the partial stuff (routing, animation, etc.) into a single Gulp plugin as well, but that's probably a more complex process so we can look at that later.\n. A generic fa-open is a really good idea. The spec we're writing up uses targeted attributes, but we like this idea more from a user perspective. We also like the option of having a generic fa-close inside an element with state, or a targeted fa-close for closing something outside of the element. A third option we'd also like is fa-toggle, and you can probably guess what that does. So that gives developers the flexibility to define open, close, and open/close functionality on controls.\n. @AntJanus Foundation 5's JavaScript suffers from a crippling lack of documentation, so if you could help us get off on the right foot that would be fantastic :)\n. Just internal documentation. For external documentation we'll just want to explain the basics of each API, like how do you open something, close something, etc. And yeah, we won't use JSDoc or anything like that, since we write out own docs. You're free to write that style of documentation (with @param and all that) if you want but we won't run it through any of those doc generators. It's more important that future generations understand how it works when they have to dive in and fix bugs and such.\n. Sweeeeeeet.\n. Regarding the docs, we'd like to slip a Markdown parser into the template pipe so we can write documentation in Markdown, as it just makes things a lot faster to write and maintain. Some Markdown parsers can also detect the three backticks for a code block and wrap it properly and add syntax highlighting. We use marked on Foundation 5, which also has a gulp plugin.\n. @whodidthis The basic components will work fine, but the ones that require JavaScript (panels, popups, dropdowns, etc.) will be written as Angular directives. For now Foundation for Apps and Angular will be tightly coupled, although we do expect people to try and port it to Ember or other frameworks.\nA core idea behind this framework is that you won't need an understanding of Angular or even JavaScript to get started prototyping single-page web apps. We're abstracting out some of the complexity of routing and so on, so you'll only need to understand some of the basics, like what a template is, or why links use the attribute ui-sref instead of href.\n. @davidkpiano As far as choice of framework, you're right that technologies come and go, and maybe in a year people won't care about Angular. But in the short-term, being opinionated makes this thing easier for us to build, and easier for our users to develop on. More portability could be a long-term goal, but it could end up being a hassle to maintain.\nAs far as the active state idea, we've got you covered! Our components all use the class is-active to denote an active state, and we can make that a customizable class most likely. When it comes down to it, most of our plugins are just different ways of showing and hiding things, so they all use the same active class.\n. @HansUXdev Regarding our motion components, currently each one is a mixin that allows you to write a custom animation with specific timing, delays, etc. The code should also only output the keyframe animations you need, so if you don't use our prebuilt classes, it should only output one set of keyframes per mixin called.\nAs far as animated pagination, we're thinking we could accomplish something similar by allowing animation classes to be used on tabs. So when tabs change they play an in/out animation defined by the developer.\n. @HansUXdev @zurbrandon Yep, using UI Router's sub-views you could accomplish something similar. The main difference is if you want each tab to have its own URL or not.\n. @dipongkor We've had some issues with view animation, so for now, try animating your views with just in, not out. Like so:\n```\nname: profile.personalSettings\nurl: /personalSettings\ncontroller: PersonalSettingsCtrl\nanimationIn: fadeIn\n\n```\nThe animations are fast enough that it will still work pretty good. We're working on an overhaul of view animations, which will make simultaneous in/out animations for views work well: #386 \n. @jmkenz Opened an issue at zurb/front-router#4 to track this.\n. @davidkpiano We do want to add sizing classes for panels, it's just a matter of how. Right now panels work off of a maximum width or height, rather than a percentage. Using the panel() mixin (which still needs a lot of adjustment) you can define this size yourself, but we'll also want a few sizing classes for rapid prototyping. We could also allow for percentage sizing, using the same 12-column grid, but you still need to cap the size or it's going to get hilariously tiny on small screens.\nPerhaps the sizing classes can apply to panels and columns? So given an element with these classes:\n``` html\n<div class=\"\n  small-12\n  medium-6\n  large-4\npanel\n  large-block\n\">\n```\nThis element is a 12/12 width panel on small screens, a 6/12 width panel on medium screens, and a 4/12 width panel on large screens. It is a lot of classes, though, and you still have to specify large-block to indicate at what breakpoint the element morphs.\nWe had looked at turning panel into a sizing class itself, like this:\nhtml\n<div class=\"\n  small-panel\n  medium-4\n  block\n\"></div>\nThis element would be a panel on small, and a 4/12 block on medium and up. The shift from panel to block is inferred due to the use of a sizing class. But this might also cut out the ability to resize panels at different breakpoints, unless you make the classes even longer, like small-panel-4, medium-panel-6, etc.\n. @jwvanderbeck Oh you'll definitely be able to use panels on any screen size, the question is if you'd ever want a grid element that is inline on a small screen to then transform into a hidden panel on a large screen.\nFor now we're assuming that's not a common use-case and not supporting it initially. The opposite will be the far more common scenario: you have a hidden off-canvas panel on small screens, that becomes an inline grid element on a larger screen.\n. @jwvanderbeck Your first use case should be possible in JS, as all of the openable/closable plugins emit open and close events that you can hook into.\nThe second use case is a little more tricky, and may just need to be custom-coded. Panels are positioned using position: absolute, and then transitioned in and out using transform: translate(). There's a global active state class (right now it's is-active, but we should probably make it user-configurable) you can hook into to override the default behavior of panels when they're toggled. It is something that's come up for an internal project ZURB is working on that's using Foundation for Apps, so we're looking into it.\nHm.. maybe we can tweak the panel mixin to accept custom \"in\" and \"out\" states to make that functionality easier to write. But I can't promise that for 1.0, which is in a few weeks ;)\n. Yeah, we've run into quite a few problems with the grid on mobile which we've spent a while researching.\nAnother big one is scrolling panes. The grid does \"fixed positioning\" with a vertical flex container, and the middle area is just scrollable. Problem is, iOS loves to get finicky with this, trying to scroll the whole window instead of the inner container. The way around it is JavaScript hacks that selectively disable scrolling or prevent the propagation of the various touch events and so on. It kinda sucks that our grid will probably have a JS dependency, but y'know, mobile browsers.\nIf you or anyone else has experience with it, let us know!\n. @Martinspire We spent a while butting our heads against this scrolling issue in iOS7 on Friday, and today we opened the same demo page in iOS8 and it worked just fine. So Apple fixed it! But we still need to make sure it works in iOS7 and Android 4. (And Windows Phone 8, let's say.)\n. You're right, a month from now iOS8 adoption will probably be high enough for it to not matter, although it has been slower than past releases.\n. @Bernardao I do think that was a point in favor of group and block, they both had more distinct meanings. The main issue is they're both short, one-syllable words, and we routinely confused them in conversation, especially because they overlap in functionality. (For example, unlike Foundation 5 rows, F4A's groups can have sizing classes just like blocks.)\nSome other folks have also pointed out that block and content are used by CMSes, so we might need more specific classes. Maybe grid-block and grid-content? That uses the existing terms we have, but namespaces them to make them more distinct.\n. @Bernardao @Failcookie Also, it will be possible to change the column count from the default of 12, but you'll probably also want to disable the grid classes then, or you're going to have like a billion. So your semantic, percentage-based grid would work like:\n``` scss\n$total-columns: 100;\n// Full width on small, 50% on medium and up\n.some-column {\n  @include grid-block;\n@include breakpoint(medium) {\n    @include grid-size(50);\n  }\n}\n```\nThere is potential for us to build percentage- and ratio-based grids later and let people pick, but I doubt it will be a 1.0 feature.\n. @kenwheeler We considered using an attribute like data-layout to store the grid classes, but ultimately we decided we were solving a problem better solved by just using mixins. The documentation for this framework will emphasize the Sass way of building components much more than the Foundation 5 docs, which puts all of the Sass stuff at the bottom.\nThe two classes we settled on for the grid are grid-block and grid-content. This naming convention fits better with existing components, since the name of the component is actually in the class. The namespacing prevents any conflicts with frameworks like Drupal, which use the classes block or content.\nWe still need to work out a few other naming conventions. One of them is related to the default behavior of the grid. Flexbox can make all of your grid columns equal height, but then none of the boxes will wrap, which is required for a traditional responsive layout. Right now wrapping is the default, and you can add the class stretch to disable wrapping and stretch the columns out. However, in our development we've found stretching to be a more common behavior and we're adding stretch to our grid blocks all the time.\nSo here's the question: should the default behavior be stretching or wrapping? We'll make one the default behavior, and add a class for the other.\n. @kenwheeler We tend to agree, and also stretch is a problematic class name because a block can have a shrink class, which auto-sizes it to its natural width or height. But those are two totally separate behaviors with similar names.\nI think the main distinction is that stretching makes sense for the big structural components of your app, like the panes and so on. But once you get to a content area, maybe you have a grid of cards that you need to collapse from 3-up to 2-up to 1-up. In that case you need wrapping because everything has to stack. (Although for even-width layouts like that, we have [size]-up-[n] classes that do that for you.)\n. @jwvanderbeck, thanks so much for your feedback!\nTo your point about \"groups\" as a concept, you're totally right, and that's why we scrapped them in favor of having just blocks. The two layout objects shared a lot of similar features, which is why we ended up merging them. The reason we're shying away from content as a standalone class is because it's a very generic term, and some CMSes (such as Drupal) use block and content classes already. Of course, class collision will always be a potential issue when you mix libraries, the word \"block\" is so generic that we're probably better off prefixing it with the word \"grid\", just to be safe.\nAs for scrolling, what browser are you using? We're having some troubles with Safari right now, but the newest versions of Chrome and Firefox should handle scrolling content just fine. All grid blocks will scroll by default if their content overflows.\n. @jwvanderbeck Unfortunately vertical sizing is not as full-featured as horizontal sizing, which is a quirk of flexbox. You can size vertical grid units these ways:\n- Stretching: this is the default behavior; the block takes up all the leftover space it can.\n- Shrinking: add the class shrink and the block will only take up as much vertical space as its content needs.\n- Manual sizing: use the flex-basis property to set a px, em, rem, vh, etc. value to size the block.\nI'm sure what you're trying to do is size with percents, and unfortunately you can't. We were hoping to make the behavior of the horizontal and vertical grid identical, but that's the one place where they aren't.\n. @jwvanderbeck So one thing to understand is that you don't need to alternate blocks and content blocks. It's not like rows and columns in Foundation, where they have to alternate. So your last example can be condensed down like this:\n.frame.vertical\n    .block.content.shrink\n    .block.stretch\n        .block.content.small-3\n        .block.content.small-3\n        .block.content.small-3\nBlocks always move horizontally by default, and that behavior doesn't cascade down to nested grid elements. So you always need to define a vertical grid on every block that you want to have vertical children. In the above example, only the highest-level grid element (the app frame) is vertical. Those small-3 blocks will be arranged horizontally.\nThe grid is still missing formal documentation (and will soon be refactored slightly), so props to you for trying to figure it out :)\n. @djgadd We do need responsive versions of the shrink class, and also probably an expand class to revert a grid element back to the default behavior, with responsive versions of that class as well.\n. I think switching to libsass would be ideal, and we'll probably do it pretty soon, since they just recently implemented maps. I'd like to see if proper @each functionality will make it in soon, which so far is the main way we access maps in our codebase.\nA common complaint about Foundation 5 is that it takes a long time to set up: Node, Git, Ruby, Bower, Grunt, and our gem are all dependencies. With libsass we can cut out the Ruby dependency, with libgit we can git out the Git dependency (we use it in F5 to download the stack), and with a bit of finagling we can run locally-installed copies of Bower and Gulp instead of requiring them globally.\nIf we work at it we can have a pure JS stack, which would be real nice.\n. So Foundation 5 downloads the Compass and Libsass stacks using Git, just cloning the repos we have set up. The problem is, you need Git installed on your system beforehand, so that adds another dependency. We can use libgit2, which is a portable, C implementation of Git to do that instead. There's a node version called nodegit, so we can basically run git clone using JavaScript instead of the user's command line.\nAs for the @each thing, what I'm talking about is doing:\nscss\n@each $key, $value in $map {\n}\nThere is another way to do this in libsass, but we might hold out a little longer and see if proper @each support gets in there, instead of refactoring what we have right now.\n. We've moved the codebase to libsass; it should be merged into the master branch tomorrow.\n. @Martinspire It's not. Our starter template for Apps uses Libsass.\n. @ilanbiala Which specific part do you feel is too opinionated? Our stack, our Angular helpers, or Angular itself?\n. @ilanbiala Ah yeah, understandable. I think the eventual plan before the first release is to split up the codebases, so the library itself stays here, and the actual stack moves to another repo and becomes the template project. The Sass, JS, and maybe the Angular helpers will be distributed through Bower. That way you can use our components and directives any way you'd like.\n. @viztastic The documentation is currently being written, but not all of the pages are on the master branch yet.\n. Closing this as we are _mere days from release :O_\n. @ilanbiala We'll have a few template projects ready for people to look at and download.\n. @AntJanus Sweeeet. Would it make sense to eventually package these as Gulp tasks? I've been looking into writing Sass unit tests and I could run those just by using a separate Sass task in Gulp.\n. Yep, we have plans to improve menu bar, namely by adding support for sub-menus and improving the switch to mobile.\nThat being said, we're also working on Foundation for Sites 6 right now, and we're trying to overhaul the top bar. We think it's inflexible and hard to customize, since it's basically designed to do one thing well. We're trying to unify patterns between the two frameworks, so whatever ideas we have for Sites will likely make it back to Apps. The main difference is that the Apps menu bar will be written in Flexbox.\n. @philippeluickx We'll need to take a hard look at the keyboard thing pretty soon here, because it does seem to work poorly with certain layouts, especially ones with a fixed footer and header. It's also possible that different mobile platforms handle the keyboard different with regards to calculated screen size, how it overlays the page, and so on.\n. Yeah, the codebase is still sort of in a \"random things are broken\" state, although the plan this week is to start scaffolding out the documentation, so that should change soon.\nAll of the components on the Playground page should work. Notifications don't work anymore because they haven't been converted into an Angular directive yet; it's still just a vanilla jQuery plugin. As for the links, they do work, they're just aren't very many yet. You probably tried clicking on the things in that component list off to the left... secretly, they aren't links, just some weird, deceptive table of contents ;)\n. @ilanbiala A lot of the code is still in flux, so we probably won't accept any pull requests until 1.0 is out. However, we would love your feedback on any of the existing components or features. Ask us questions, make suggestions, tell us we're wrong, etcetera. (Me, I'd like to see more people comment on our grid classes, because we need some feedback on them.)\n. Hard to say, but it won't be more than a few weeks until 1.0 is out, so we'll let y'alls know closer to the ship date :)\n. I've noticed the Angular error too, but the page loads fine for me. Are you accessing the site on port 3001?\n. @YuriGor @mehlah What OS are you guys on?\n. @YuriGor The server we're using is just for testing, but it will probably make it into our template stack as well. It's a little easier than configuring the routing to work in a sub-directory.\nHowever, you'll be free to run your code in any environment you like.\n. @t1mmen There's been an \"angular is not defined\" error for a while, but it was actually unrelated to the core Angular functionality. Either way the code causing that issue has been removed (9f55f8a9901ceda84e12bf2d0bd7a0b48499e9b8).\nAs for the Sass, do you have Ruby and Sass 3.4 installed?\n. @YuriGor If you're running the code in a subdirectory (i.e. localhost/foundation-apps/build) it won't work out of the box\u2014you have to tell the UI router what directory the app is in (see here for a solution).\nIt's also possible your xampp setup is messing with Gulp's server, so instead, you can run gulp build to build the site once without running a server.\n. Just a heads up, friends, we're trying a different server plugin for Gulp that seems to generate less errors and just work better.\nThe port number is different\u2014it's 8080 instead of 3001.\n. When we first started planning the plugins, we made a bunch of really basic ones as a proof-of-concept, using jQuery and basic DOM manipulation. Our ace engineer @AntJanus has spent the last few weeks converting them all into actual Angular plugins. Notifications, popups, and action sheets still haven't been converted into Angular. Once that's done we'll drop jQuery and just use what Angular has built-in.\nThe real plugins are under js/angular, while the old plugins are under js/foundation.\n. @ilanbiala No problem, just looking at the code it probably looks weird :)\n. @Failcookie The JS plugins are being developed in js/angular. (The old plugins are in js/foundation, and they're still being converted to Angular directives.) Our Angular guy is out for the week, and he's the most equipped to explain that stuff ;)\nYou might also be interested in looking at our Angular helpers, which are in gulpfile.js under the copy-templates task. This bit of code converts configuration data stored at the top of every template file (under client/templates) into routing, animation, and controller configuration for Angular. It allows us to quickly define URLs for pages, how those pages animate, and what Angular controllers they use, without writing any JavaScript.\n. I was able to write a basic controller that pulled data from an API and spit it out. After writing the controller, I added it to the template like this:\n```\nname: page\nurl: /page\ncontroller: PageControllerName\n\n```\nThe only things we're \"enforcing\" with Angular so far are the use of ui-router and ng-animate, but even that stuff you could rip out if you knew what you were doing.\n. @ilanbiala You can see all of the animation mixins under scss/components/_motion.scss, but we haven't yet properly implemented them with all the Angular stuff. We were using animate.css to do basic testing of the concept.\n. There are two kinds of blocks in the grid system: ones used for layout and ones used for content. To use a block for content, add the class content to the block. This turns off the flexbox functionality and adds gutters. So they're like columns, more or less.\nSecond, I'd recommend not using set heights for your elements if you can help it\u2014let the content dictate the height instead. A block will automatically scroll if its content is too tall for the box, but you can add overflow: hidden to the block to disable that. We should probably add a no-scrolling class.\nEdit: Here's how I would modify your markup:\nhtml\n<div class=\"block\" style=\"padding-top:7.5px; padding-bottom:7.5px\">\n  <a href=\"#\">\n    <div class=\"medium-1 content block\" style=\"background-color:gray;margin:0 10px;overflow: hidden;padding:0;-webkit-box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .50);-moz-box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .50);box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .50);\">\n      <img src=\"http://placehold.it/100x100\" style=\"width:100%;position: relative;\">\n    </div>\n  </a>\n  <div class=\"medium-10 content block\" style=\"-webkit-box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .50);-moz-box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .50);box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .50);\">\n    <h4 style=\"margin-top:9px;line-height: 1.2\">Title <small>(Platform)</small></h4>\n    <p style=\"font-size: .7rem;line-height: 1.3;\">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Dolore quaerat, assumenda natus! Amet numquam praesentium ab molestiae, excepturi minus dignissimos nemo, quam magnam tempore fugiat, sit reprehenderit laborum perspiciatis atque?</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n. Brandon and I are going to review all of the components today, so we'll get back to you soon.\nOne thing we were wondering is if there would be a way to add onOpen and onClose events to these components, or at least a way callbacks to specific directives. This was something I was trying to implement in my test plugins, but Angular isn't really into the jQuery on method. Most of the Foundation 5 JS plugins fire events when plugins do things, and for the ones that don't it's a commonly-requested feature to add.\n. Go for it!\n. If it works standalone then we could put it on NPM. If it's not, that's also probably fine too, since at the moment it's probably somewhat tightly coupled to our stack and our JS anyway.\n. If it requires some of our own code to work, it might make more sense to keep the plugin in this repo for now. It's very Foundation for Apps + Angular specific at the moment, so at least if we keep it here all of our development can stay mostly in this one repo. I guess I don't have a huge preference though ;)\n. I guess the stack will have to pull the Gulp plugin out of the Bower package, I don't know if that's a bad practice or not. Dev tools typically come from NPM.\n. @rafibomb is writing our documentation, so all of this stuff will be super useful. Once we're done moving it to our formal docs we can just remove the file.\n. Can you show an example of how to open/close/toggle components in JS?\n. Other things I thought of:\n- How to set up a base URL if the app is running in a subdirectory (in case you're uploading code to a server)\n- How to set up rewrite rules if you aren't using the test server\nThese things are already covered in the UI Router wiki (here and here), so we can probably just explain the basics and then link to this. As long as people are aware that those things come up we should be good.\n. You can merge it in and we can take it from there while you work on other things.\n. Oh one thing we'll need to document is how you as the Angular engineer properly import these modules if you're building your own project. Or whatever typical boilerplate stuff you think is necessary to properly document an Angular module.\n. Good catch, that's a holdover from Foundation 5. At the moment the global Sass file is being imported in foundation.scss, not inside individual files.\n. Totally! The official release is next month. By next week we should have the template project set up, which will make installing and updating a project much easier.\n. We're actually going to switch the compiler to libsass 3.0.1 in the next week, although I don't know if it will make a difference or not.\n. @jpdesigndev It will be an entertaining ride, but with libsass's commitment to catching up with Ruby Sass, it has a good future ahead of it.\n. We've found it easier to use and understand than Grunt, and it's reached a point where a lot of the big Grunt plugins also have Gulp versions.\nOur template project will use Gulp, but it will be possible to use our components with pretty much any other build system. The main thing you're going to lose for now is use of our Angular helpers, which do the routing and animation stuff. People are already talking about trying to port this to Ember when it comes out, so I could see people recreating the Angular helpers as a Grunt task.\n. Once you've installed everything, run npm test to get the test server going, and then go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser. If you specifically go to localhost:8080/home, you can see a kitchen sink with most of the components we have.\nWe're working on the formal documentation right now, but it hasn't yet made it into the master branch.\n. Oh, I totally missed that leftover code. You can remove all of that stuff under the @import statements.\n. @jwvanderbeck Oh yeah, our stack is just a starting point, and we don't intend to prescribe exactly how to use our components, so the choice is more for what our stack should use as a default. Ideally the codebase works with Ruby Sass 3.4 and libsass 3.0+, which I think is doable, but little things keep coming up.\nThe main goal for the stack would be that it's effective as a rapid prototyping tool. As for taking code to production, we expect developers to mess with the structure of their app a lot more.\n. @AntJanus The docs folder should be all lowercase, or it's going to bug me ;) It was made capitalized on accident it would seem.\n. @AntJanus Oh well it wasn't you who renamed the folder, but I haphazardly changed all instances of \"Docs\" in the gulpfile to \"docs\" not thinking it mattered, so that was my bad.\n. @AntJanus Can you remove the whole folder from version control in one commit, and then re-add it in a second one? Just renaming the folder destroys the history anyway so it's probably not a huge deal. Sweeping structural changes are probably still okay before 1.0.\n. Is there not a clever/really irresponsible way to transfer all of the attributes of the <img> tag to the <svg> tag that's injected?\nIf not I think telling people \"don't get fancy with these\" is fine. Put your click events on anchors outside the icon, etc.\n. Sounds good. I'm trying to think, what are common things people might try to put directly on icons? Click events seem like an obvious one. But we'll probably just train our users to only put icons inside of other interactive things. Like if you have a button with an icon, make a .button element and put your directives on that.\n. Great! As for the actual icons, Brandon and I have a list of the ones we've agreed with the Iconic folks to use, so we'll get those in version control soon.\n. Yeah, we can probably put them in a folder at the root of the repo. So in production you copy them out of bower_components/foundation-apps/iconic. I'ma go figure out which icons those are today and I can push them to this branch.\n. Merge'd\n. Yep, they definitely should. The user should be able to change the names and values of the breakpoints as they please.\n. Yep, looks like they're hardcoded right now. We'll resolve that soon.\n. The grid classes just had a lot of work done to them, and proper support for the $breakpoint-classes variable was a part of that.\n. I haven't had time to work on it; we're finishing up a few final components (typography, forms, and menu bar namely) first. This PR should be ready by the end of the week, though.\n. Grid classes successfully refactored, and surprisingly working right in the newest Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, and IE10. Just working out some final kinks.\n. Boy howdy do I love this chain of dependencies haha. I guess this is another compelling reason to use Ruby as the default Sass compiler; nothing is changing on that front for a while.\n. We'd like to tag something as a release candidate next week, we just have a small number of components that still need finished.\n. We have this template that pulls in the Apps codebase through Bower. This is what our end users will eventually use.\nIf you want to incorporate the code now, you can run bower install zurb/foundation-apps --save to get the code in your own stack. The bower package includes the Sass, JavaScript, and Gulp plugin for routing.\n. Ah, well we just got it working in the past few days. :)\n. Strange, I'm not sure why it's looking for a repo called \"bower-foundation-apps\". When I run the same command it gets this repo. You can also try being more explicit:\nbash\nbower install https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps.git\n. @jwvanderbeck How do you think we should change the delivery of the files?\nFor now it's likely that the Angular helpers will require a somewhat specific build process, but we also don't expect many Angular developers to take them to production, so they can just be removed in that case.\n. @jwvanderbeck Our documentation will have a getting started page that outlines these two options\u2014using our pre-made template, versus installing the components yourself using Bower.\n. We're planning on tagging a release candidate tomorrow, and we can try to outline what's left for the 1.0 release. I can tell you that the codebase is more or less feature-complete, so our big focus for the next few weeks is code cleanup, writing documentation/tests, and bug-fixing.\nWhen 1.0 is out, we also plan to maintain a roadmap of planned new features. We know there will be a lot of holes in the feature set, or people are going to try to do things we didn't anticipate, so we already have ideas for new features and components that we don't have time to get in for 1.0. \n. @viztastic We want to do tutorial videos, it's just a matter of if we have time before 1.0. But this grid is so different that we obviously need to educate people on how it works.\nWhat we will have for 1.0 is a handful of templates that use all of the different components in various ways.\n. Yay release candidate!\n. I'll see if I can mess around with your markup, but here's a few things:\nYour first panel has two classes that conflict: shrink and xxlarge-1. shrink reduces the panel's width (in a horizontal grid) or height (in a vertical grid) to whatever the size of the content inside the panel is. xxlarge-1 sizes the column equal to 1/12 of the parent.\nThe panel should also be written as an Angular directive to get the proper functionality:\nhtml\n<div fa-panel position=\"left\" class=\"no-scroll xxlarge-block xxlarge-1 shrink\" id=\"statspanel\">\n</div>\nIt can then be opened and closed by adding the attribute fa-toggle=\"statspanel\" to any other element.\nTo your last point about alignment, unfortunately you can't align individual children in a grid, only the grid parent. So when you set align-right on a block, your aligning all of the blocks inside that one to the right.\n. I just removed that code since we aren't using it anymore. ce6dac4d497c10d13551c382380ae4d5c7c6bbab\n. Can we include both tasks, using Ruby Sass as the default one? It would be useful if Travis could try compiling with both so we can check for errors.\n. If Ruby Sass works, you can merge it in and I'll make it work in libsass eventually.\n. I removed a few older branches, and it looks like all the ones leftover are in active development, even if they don't have PRs.\n. I don't see those on GitHub, so if you happen to have them on your local machine, then yeah, they can be deleted.\n. Yeah I just added that and didn't update the documentation to specify that you now need Bundler.\nIf possible we'd like to avoid what happened with Foundation 5, where Sass 3.4 introduced a breaking change and none of the existing Foundation projects out there had a Gemfile, so anyone who upgraded their system-wide Sass was screwed. And of course, it's always worthwhile to specify your dependencies.\n. I was updating the readme on Friday but didn't finish it. I'll get that change in today.\n. Instructions to install Bundler were added here: 78e1b0a38e2ac7fcfa907968d71a13b9838bb83f\n. We have styles for the native <progress> and <meter> elements, although the styles aren't yet finalized, and they still need mixins. The <meter> element is cool because it can automatically change between high, medium, and low colors based on its current and max value. Unfortunately it's not supported in IE10.\n. The component hasn't changed since it was originally written a few months ago, so it should still be working. The <meter> element in particular has a lot of options, though, so it is kinda confusing; here's some good documentation on it.\n. The codebase will indeed be compatible with Ruby Sass and libsass, but since libsass is in active development it will be something of an entertaining ride making sure the codebase works with it. That being said, we're big libsass fans so we'd like the framework to work with it.\n. So, because of some quirks with how CSS handles vertical alignment, it's not possible to size vertical grid elements with percentages. Your options are:\n- Have the block fill all leftover space; this is the default\n- Have the block shrink with the shrink class; this means it will only take up as much space as it needs. This is useful for headers and footers, which tend to be thinner anyway.\n- Size the block explicitly with the flex-basis property. It has to be an explicit unit like px, rem, em, or vh; it can't be percentage.\nIt is a weird inconsistency to be sure, but it will be reflected in our documentation.\n. Blocks use overflow: auto, which means they only show scroll bars if there's too much content in the element. There's currently no class to change that, but you could add overflow: hidden to a grid element to stop it from happening.\nTo achieve the layout you're describing, here's the layout I'd suggest:\nslim\n.vertical.grid-frame\n  .shrink.grid-block.header\n    p Header\n  .grid-content\n    .grid-block#row\n      .grid-content.small-3.sidebar\n      .grid-content.small-6#main\n      .grid-content.small-3.sidebar\n    .footer\nOnce you're inside a grid-content element, the grid changes slightly to act more like the Foundation 5 grid. This is what you want, because you don't want that sub-grid to try and stretch the length of its parent\u2014you just want the whole parent to scroll like a normal container.\nIn the above example, fill #main with sample content and you'll see that the whole lower container will scroll, not just the center area.\nNow, can you make the sidebars, which have a gray background, stretch to the bottom of the parent until it starts overflowing? Not easily. Unfortunately vertical sizing is still a hassle in some scenarios.\n. Awesome! Glad I can help. We know the grid is kind of confusing; we've got some good documentation in the works that we should have in the master branch soon.\n. One of our guys has that issue also, where bower install is putting things in app/bower_components or something like that. I tried searching around for where a system-level setting for that exists but I couldn't find anything. So we can just add a .bowerrc to lock that down.\n. Do you have a visible example in the repo? Or is it similar to the panel thing we were talking about on the phone yesterday?\n. I can't test it right now, but there might be a quick fix we can do. It seems like the issue is that \"hidden\" components like panels are briefly being exposed while views shift around.\nscss\n// Select all views\n[ui-view] {\n  // Only select views being transitioned\n  .ng-enter-active, .ng-leave-active {\n    // Only select components inside those transitioning views\n    [fa-panel], [fa-offcanvas] { // Etc.\n      // Now hide those suckers\n      display: none !important;\n    }\n  }\n}\n. @ilanbiala The animations will follow the format prescribed by Angular's animation module, where transitions are structured like this:\nscss\n.transitionName {\n  &.ng-enter {\n    // Before state\n    &.ng-enter-active {\n      // After state\n    }\n  }\n}\nOur transition mixins will allow you to create animations with more nuance, by adjusting direction, origin, timing, and so on.\nscss\n.customTransition {\n  @include slide($args...);\n}\nBut if you want to write your own totally different transitions, they'll work as long as they use the ng- classes.\n. :+1: \n. That was my concern, I'm not sure if there are any minor structural differences in output, but I don't think there are.\nSo yeah, a diff check would definitely be useful, although I know right now that libsass doesn't work, so initially it shouldn't be required for a passing build. I think 1.0 will be Ruby Sass only, but the gap in features is pretty small, so either we can work our codebase backwards slightly or wait for libsass to add a handful of new features and fix a few bugs.\nLet's add tasks for it but not build it into the initial test suite. Once we're more confident libsass will work consistently, we can add libsass compilation and diff checking to the formal test process.\n. Yeah, that's fine. Our main tests will be the JS and the Sass, compiled with Ruby.\n. In progress here: #146\n. Merged here: 459c49ce522d7a82fc65e3cb15879ed657fcbfaf\n. The close directive is triggering an error and not functioning. This happens whether or not the attribute has a value. Try messing with it in the index file in our documentation, which uses a panel for the sidebar nav.\n. :+1: \n. Pretty sure this commit inadvertently fixed this: daa858918ca4dd6c32d3648ff127e5ffea0cebfb\n. :+1:\n. I just added bundle to npm's post-install process, which will properly set up the gems for you. You're supposed to run bundle once as a apart of the setup process, but that wasn't in the documentation. So now it does it for you!\n. The revamped classes that use ng-enter, ng-enter-active, et al. were merged in here: 1f222b694d3ed3ae91aba101c32a666fdacbc689\n. Added in this commit: cfa79f97352eae00cdea9b318e7657a6932d32fe\n. Talked with @zurbrandon and we agree, the directive name should be the same, making the revised syntax:\nhtml\n<zf-accordion>\n  <zf-accordion-item></zf-accordion-item>\n</zf-accordion>\n. I'M ON THE CASE\n. Looks like the last thing to do would be to add plain English descriptions for each page, so it doesn't just show a raw view name with hyphens in the search results.\n. I'm doing a sweep right now. You think it's okay to delete your test pages? We've got live examples (mostly) working on the pages for each component.\n. Talked to @zurbrandon, we'll go without notification support for now.\n. Fixed with: 7632696c4925c614d9f5560904e81f9ac733b3d1\n. Okay, confusingly this bug stopped happening.\n. Yep, I tried to do it last night but I got errors, so I must not have configured it properly. The pristine app.js doesn't need the markdown or hljs modules.\n. @viztastic For the code samples, we're shifting from using a Markdown parser to using an Angular implementation of highlight.js, but not every sample has been fixed yet.\n@AntJanus Ah okay, so this is like the other animation stuff where you need an in-between setup phase. Normally the overlay is display: none, and then when a modal is called in, it needs to be set to display: flex and opacity: 0, first, and then set to opacity: 1 to trigger the transition.\nThe modal overlay doesn't need any animation support\u2014it should just be hardcoded to fade in and out. So if I add those two states (probably just with ng-enter and ng-enter active to keep it consistent, and scrap is-active) would that work?\nUnfortunately we can't do the lazy method with pointer-events: none, because IE10 confusingly doesn't support it.\n. Fixed in this commit: 63fb722c13d1317a6bc20d1c03ebd74501ffd615\n. padding class added here: fdbff5d248b5889c29653eb06b775226fd89cf20\nRemoved padding from container components here: daa858918ca4dd6c32d3648ff127e5ffea0cebfb\n. :+1: \n. Pull request in progress here: #269\n. display: block is what makes the element show. The !important, although a bit annoying, is necessary because a single class can easily be overridden by most other selectors. And there's no other quick way to show/hide elements\u2014you can't use visibility: hidden or opacity: 0.\nWe don't currently have a solution for using these classes with inline or inline-block elements in Foundation 5, either. We'd either have to add modifier classes (show-for-medium inline) or create new ones (show-for-medium-inline), which will add a ton of code.\nIf we added the option to specify your visible state in the mixins, would that be helpful? We have mixin versions of the visibility classes now:\nscss\n.thing {\n  @include show-for(medium)\n}\nWhat if you could change the block to another value like inline-block or table-cell?\nscss\n.thing {\n  @include show-for(medium, inline-block)\n}\n. Alrighty, we updated the visibility classes to use flex instead of block when the element has grid-block in its class attribute.\nThe visibility mixins were also updated, so you can override the use of block, like so:\nscss\n.thing {\n  @include show-for(medium, table-cell);\n}\n. @jmkenz For Foundation 6 we're going to switch to max-width media queries to avoid the display: block issue altogether. I think eventually we'll transplant that fix to Apps as well.\nSee zurb/foundation#6687\n. @jmkenz It's only for .show-for-* classes, so that you never need to assign display: block to an element. We can refactor the visibility classes to only apply display: none to an element, negating the need for element-specific visibility classes (table.show-for-medium and so on).\nIt does break our mobile-first rule, which is sort of a tough call to make, but we've only made that call for this specific feature. The class itself still follows mobile first logic: \"show this on x size and up\", even if the rule in the background is max-width.\n. Fixed in this commit: 63fb722c13d1317a6bc20d1c03ebd74501ffd615\n. Fixed here: b4aed57c33fdb9561663c3dad24dfdac019f56e8\n. Doesn't appear to be an issue anymore.\n. Done!\n. Closing and adding to our list of known issues.\n. This is being fixed in Firefox 35, which will be out in January. It will be a momentous occasion.\n. I think you were looking at that page while I was doing a rebase, so that nonsense ain't there anymore.\n. Fixed in this commit: b18f48fab0f302d4f08a50d6ca525cb4d273294c\n. Doesn't seem to be an issue anymore.\n. Good idea, we'll get somebody on it.\n. Site just went live so the 401 is gone, and I just updated the readme: 7d1c876956182fa2a4a2f8f133fb69aa83e55552\n. Went ahead and converted them to anchors. As far as accessibility, it's something we'll have to wait to look at farther down the road when the framework is more solid.\n. No, we love nitpicking! :) Thanks.\n. Here you are. May need some fleshing out but it's a start.\n. What version of Sass are you compiling with?\n. Oh! Yes. I didn't look close enough at the code sample.\nfoundation.scss imports the entire framework at once, so you don't need to import _global.scss after it. And the settings file should be imported before the Foundation libraries, so it can be used to override variables.\n. Yes, there should be one. We'll get one in there shortly.\n. I moved the settings file to the scss folder so it'll show up in the Bower package. Just need to do some testing with the template stack, which already has a settings file. It needs to import the settings file not in the Bower package, but the one in the client/assets/scss folder instead.\n. I'll look into it, but thankfully that step of the process is just a welcome message\u2014it doesn't set anything up.\n. That might work. Also, the source code for the CLI is here, in case anyone who knows more about Node than me can help :)\nhttps://github.com/zurb/foundation-cli\n. @jsmreese I can see in your screenshot that it's connecting the CLI's main JavaScript file to a command on your system (C:\\Users\\John...\\npm\\foundation-apps), is that command there at that path?\n. @peterblazejewicz I implemented your fix, which should solve the problem.\nnpm update -g foundation-cli\n. Awesome! @jsmreese @dhye360 @peterblazejewicz let me know if it works for y'alls.\n. Alright, I'll look into it. Thanks so much for being helpful and patient, guys :)\nIn the mean time, you can do what the installer does by hand:\nnpm install\nbower install\nbundle\n. @narration The initial hope was to use more portable libraries, but it didn't totally pan out. For example, we were going to use nodegit, which is a portable version of Git for Node, but it wasn't able to clone over HTTPS, so we couldn't use it. Some of the Node-based tools we use or have considered using are in active development, so sometimes things get weird.\nSeeing the issues that have cropped up, though, I think we'll take another look at it. Bower and NPM both have programmatic APIs, although Bower's isn't too thoroughly documented from what I can tell. But we can make it work! The only odd bird is Bundler, although the codebase is very close to working with libsass, at which point we can just drop Ruby from the stack entirely.\n. @viztastic Well, the framework came in a little hot last week, so we'd just like to get a slightly more stable version out for people using the framework this early. It's just a lot of little bug fixes.\nThe Bower package is also currently missing the _settings.scss file, so if you install the framework standalone that file isn't as easy to find.\n. Can any Windows users help us test a new build of the CLI? We're working on improving error-handling and cross platform support.\nHere's how to run the test install:\ngit clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-cli.git\ncd foundation-cli\nnpm install\nnpm test\nIf all goes well, you'll see three green check marks at the end of the install. If you get an error, please paste it in here so we can take a look. Thanks!\n. @tnedich Fixed that: 3d9b47\nThe command should at least start now.\n. Hmm, well luckily we're going to remove Ruby from the install process entirely, so I won't stress about that. The Git, npm, and Bower parts working are the most critical.\n. @jgamao Which error are you getting? And is it with the current CLI or this test version?\n. @fhassan2014 Ah, sorry about that, there was a line of debugging code I left uncommented that forces an error to happen. If you have time, could you try testing it again? I'd appreciate it :)\n- Delete the test folder the CLI created\n- Run git pull\n- npm test again\n. @fhassan2014 The template project uses Bundler to install the right version of Sass for you. Run bundle install and then try compiling again.\nThe next version of the CLI won't require Ruby or Bundler, thankfully :)\n. @fhassan2014 Ah that's fantastic :) Thanks again for trying it out.\n. @fhassan2014 You can just run gulp if you have it installed globally. The way the watch and build commands work changed slightly in the new CLI, although the functionality is the same.\nfoundation-apps watch is identical to npm start which is identical to gulp.\n. @fhassan2014 Try just running gulp inside your project folder instead, since that's what the watch command is running. (If you don't have Gulp: npm install -g gulp)\nThe watch command will make more sense once all three of the Foundation frameworks use the CLI, and then watch becomes a shorthand for \"run whatever this project needs to run\".\n. @soumak77 Ink is the third one, which is being rebranded as Foundation for Emails when v2.0 comes out in a few months. Unifying the branding partially represents our push to share more code, styles, and best practices between the three frameworks.\n. @fhassan2014 The second error EADDRINUSE means you already have a server for another Apps project running, or at least you have something else running on port 8080. Close out your other build process, run gulp again, and then it should work.\n. @fhassan2014 It looks like the Sass isn't compiling to CSS; that's why there's a \"Not Found\" error in the console, for css/app.css. Are you still getting the same gulp-ruby-sass error in your other screenshots?\n. @fhassan2014 I just noticed you're running a pre-release build of JRuby, so I think that's the issue. The error is being generated by the Sass executable, meaning it's a Ruby error, not a JavaScript one. You might need to switch to a stable version of JRuby, or file an issue with their team.\n. This is a somewhat older issue, so I'm going to close it out. The original issue filed has been fixed, and version 1.1 of the CLI, which we published last month, greatly improves the stability and error-handling of the project creation process.\nIf y'alls have any more issues with the CLI in the future, do let us know :)\n. Doesn't look like it says ZMusic anymore. http://foundation.zurb.com/apps/app-templates/travel/#!/\n. Fix'd.\n. Thanks!\n. There's a Markdown parser in our docs still, so it's converting that URL into an anchor. We should be able to remove that pretty soon, because all of our docs are written in pure HTML now.\n. Fixed with #208.\n. Thanks!\n. I had noticed an issue with the get-border-value() function not returning values properly, but that's a small problem. I think there are also a few places in the code where we use @if not, and libsass doesn't properly support not. So you'd have to change any statements like that to be more specific, i.e. @if $val == false.\n. Alright, I'm going to call libsass support official.\nOur plan is to eventually compile the documentation and the template stack with libsass by default, and drop our Ruby dependency, but of course we'll keep testing in Ruby Sass as well.\nThe Foundation 5 CLI gives the user the option to pick their compiler. Would people care if we dropped that choice and just made libsass the default? I feel like if you're savvy enough to want to use the new Sass 3.4 features, you're savvy enough to know how to switch a Sass compiler ;)\n. It'll definitely be in 1.0.3 :)\n. I think that would be a better option, changing the $orientation parameter of the grid-frame and grid-block mixins. The default should be horizontal to match how the class system works.\nIf you'd like to make the change I can merge it in :)\n. Ah yeah, good catch. Let's say $orientation, because that same term is used for menu bar and tabs as well.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. We added a fix to the template repo: cf139fc51fea7df85268c8b35425ab0014342d26\n. Whenever you see a \"Cannot find module\" error, it means you're missing an npm package, so you can run npm install to get the package. So this is likely an issue with the CLI.\nHere's a question, @shanecarmody: do you typically run sudo npm install versus just a regular npm install? The CLI currently has issues with people who have Node configured to where you need sudo to install things.\n. I noticed that the Yeoman CLI, which I borrowed a few libraries from, doesn't directly address this issue\u2014they link you to tutorials on how to properly configure Node instead. Possibly because it's a tricky problem to solve.\nIt's tricky because you have to detect that a normal npm install is failing, and then follow it up with a sudo npm install. I think the error is usually EACCESS, so you can probably catch that, but maybe there are other random ways an npm install can fail also.\nIt's also tricky for me to test because I don't have access to a machine that requires sudo when you install things, and I'm not sure if there's a way to fake that environment. I'd have to borrow a coworker's computer instead ;)\n. I think as a stopgap we can add a check to see if you ran sudo npm install -g foundation-cli, and then every time you build a new project tack on a warning saying \"you might need to run these commands by hand\" or something like that.\n. The issue with machines that require sudo is a known one, and we're looking to fix it shortly.\n. Ah, we need to remove those, as the framework doesn't currently support RTL. It's on the list of things we want to add in the future.\nInstead of using the $default-dir and $opposite-dir variables, we might look into using css-flip instead, which would automate a lot of that process.\nAnother request we had for Foundation 5 is better support for bi-directionality, which seems like a trickier problem. If anyone has input on that, or the use of CSS Flip (or similar tools), let us know!\n. RTL support is now on our roadmap, but it probably won't happen until we're a few patches in.\n. @jahtalab We don't have a specific timeline right now, but now's a good a time as any to examine our approach to RTL. We're also working on Foundation 6 right now, which will continue to have RTL support, so we should use the same approach for both.\nWe had looked at using css-flip to make the process more automated, but I don't think it will cover every use-case we have in our codebase. It also only works with CSS, not Sass.\nIf you're interested in contributing, that would be great! We're currently figuring out if there's a more elegant way to implement RTL than our current setup with the $default-float and $opposite-direction variables. Maybe a more generic flip() function that converts from left to right, and can reverse percentages automatically?\n. Did you create your project yesterday by chance? The template stack was briefly missing autoprefixer, so Safari wouldn't have the -webkit prefixes it needs to work. Try pasting this code into your existing gulpfile.js, where the sass task is. It's from lines 72 to 83:\njs\ngulp.task('sass', function() {\n  return gulp.src('docs/assets/scss/app.scss')\n    .pipe(sass({\n      loadPath: ['scss'],\n      style: 'nested',\n      bundleExec: true\n    }))\n    .pipe(autoprefixer({\n      browsers: ['last 2 versions', 'ie 10']\n    }))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/assets/css/'));\n});\nProjects created now shouldn't have this problem.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Looks like the partial for the off-canvas plugin is missing. Check your build folder; do you see a folder called partials with a bunch of HTML files inside?\n. Scratch that, it was an issue with the Gulpfile. This pull request fixes the problem.\nIf you haven't made any changes to your Gulpfile, just paste in the fixed file and you'll be set.\n. I'm still learning Angular, but one thing I've been wondering is if it makes sense to write each module's template HTML in the JavaScript itself, instead of in a separate file. On the one hand, it would make integrating modules into your project easier, as you'd only need to copy on file, instead of two files from two different folders.\nOn the other hand, it becomes more of a hassle to maintain because all your HTML ends up in strings instead of a nice, easily-indentable HTML file.. What I don't know is if it's considered a bad practice like it is in jQuery, where it's considered a better idea to use native DOM manipulation ($(document.createElement())) or use a templating engine like Handlebars, than have jQuery parse an entire string into a DOM tree.\nTo be sure some of our components are more complex than others. Action sheets, tabs, and notifications probably have the most complex markup. Other components like panel and off-canvas are a single line of simple HTML.\n. @AntJanus That makes sense, I've worked with giant strings of HTML so I know it's not really a best practice. I'd be in favor of the folder approach, then, since that would better segment each directive as an actual plugin that you can choose to either import or not.\n. When I landed on this page I didn't realize it was a PR so I changed it myself :P And made a few formatting tweaks also. Thanks for catching it!\n. We're working on a fix to make the menu auto-close.\n. This has been fixed, but it also spawned this issue: #278\n. :+1:\n. I added it to the template repo also: cf139fc51fea7df85268c8b35425ab0014342d26\n. I'm working on it right now, but in the mean time, you can read the Sass file itself, which is very thoroughly documented.\n. And done! The grid page still needs further iteration, but the mixins are now documented.\n. Good catch, thanks!\n. Are you using our template stack or your own build process? See if js/vendor/iconic.min.js is being compiled into your JavaScript.\n. Yeah, it looks like the Gulpfile in our template stack is out of sync with what's in the docs. I'll make a few changes and then it will work.\n. Fixed that business with this commit on the template repo. You can either cut and paste the fixed Gulpfile into your existing project or create a new project with foundation-apps new project.\n. Thanks!\n. Definitely! We have a few ideas for this, maybe you can see about implementing.\n- Create a motion stagger mixin so people can set the timing of the stagger.\n- Put the ng-enter-stagger class in a variable so people can change it.\n- Create a few classes that use the mixin, like short-stagger or long-stagger.\n. Merged in #394.\n. Merged in #247 which implements this.\n. This is probably an issue with your build process; you'll need add a copy task to your Gruntfile or Gulpfile that copies everything from bower_components/foundation-apps/js/partials/ to build/partials/, where build is the name of your distribution folder.\n. Actually, we recently fixed an issue with the template's Gulpfile not properly copying the framework's partials. Try copying and pasting the new Gulpfile into your existing project, or make a new project with foundation-apps new appName and it should work.\nLet us know if you run into any issues!\n. Is there a way we can handle the dependencies without creating a separate repo? We handle our front-end dependencies through Bower, so we can't add them to this repo's package.json necessarily, unless there's a way we can have two package files in this repo\u2014one for compiling the documentation and one for people installing the package.\n. Foundation for Apps is now on npm as foundation-apps.\n. Thanks!\n. Since you can see the function call right there, it should be enough to be able to change the percentage value right in the function call (or scrap it entirely if you want to use a different color). Otherwise we'd need extra variables for every variable that used color scaling.\n. @AntJanus npm start should use the Gulp executable file inside the user's node_modules directory, which is why you don't need it installed globally (npm scripts check inside node_modules/.bin before the user's path). However, it seems like this sometimes doesn't work on people's machines for some reason.\n@erredeco Looking at that log file, the actual error would have been output in your command line. Could you try re-running the command and paste whatever comes up in the command line?\n. We're working on a fix to detect when the user has multiple servers running and warn them with a more friendly error.\n. Yep, we're pretty close. Although the fact that every tool in the chain (libsass, node-sass, and gulp-sass) is in active development is occasionally problematic. If one library in the chain breaks it will cause problems for our users. This came up a few times during development. Once, a minor patch of gulp-sass caused our build process to fail every time, so we had to lock it at a specific version number. libsass on Windows is also a little weird because node-sass will try to compile a new binary, which requires Visual Studio to be installed on the user's machine.\nThe Ruby version of Sass may be slow, but it's definitely more stable. Of course, over time that will likely become less of an issue, which is why we definitely want the codebase to be compatible with both flavors of Sass.\nBut just to get some clarity, do you think our template stack should not require Ruby? Because the framework in general technically doesn't require Ruby; you can use libsass also. Like I said, it's close, and it does compile, but I think a handful of minor functions output values incorrectly.\n. @ilanbiala Yep, I think that's what we would end up doing. Sass remained unchanged for so long we weren't used to having to manage our dependencies this carefully with Foundation 5 ;)\nA pure JS stack was our initial goal, so we'll get there soon enough.\nThe Visual Studio thing threw me for a loop though, I didn't know about it until a few months ago. From what I've learned, node-sass will try to install a pre-compiled binary on your machine (it has two for Windows, 32-bit and 64-bit), but if it fails, it will try to compile a new binary, and on Windows that requires Visual Studio to be installed.\nGranted, if you use Windows for web development you're probably used to having a more involved setup process, but ideally the CLI has as little overhead as possible to get going.\n. Closing this as libsass is definitely in the cards for us soon.\n. We're pushing out some updates this week. Specifically, once we get a 1.0.1 release out the door, we'll update the templates to have the new files.\n. We'll likely put out a minor patch this week, and when we do the templates will get a ton of bugfixes.\n. Thanks!\n. Looks like it was an issue with selector specificity; the is-active class was targeting other components inside the accordion. #259 should fix it.\n. Typically we don't want hover states to override active states, as the extra affordance isn't necessary. It's a relatively easy feature for individual developers to override if they want it, though.\n. Should be fixed with #258 and #300.\n. There may be cases where you want to force at least one tab in an accordion to stay open, so most likely we're going to introduce a new attribute to this directive that lets you adjust that setting. We just need to figure out what to call it.\n. If you use the two attributes (multi-open and collapsible) in any combination that would be good. And false should be the default for collapsible, so by default, there's always at least one open item in an accordion.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Are you using ui-sref to create links? That's how you make links with UI Router, not using href.\nIf you have a view called \"about\":\n```\nname: about\nurl: /about\n\n```\nLink to it using this code:\nhtml\n<a ui-sref=\"about\">About</a>\n. @tomasbana After reading your comment more closely, I realized you're clicking the example links in the starter template. Those are deliberately not functional, but we could take the href=\"#\" out of the menu items so that error doesn't come up.\n. No they aren't, and I'm not sure how that happened. We'll get it fixed shortly.\n. Alright, we updated the panel documentation to be more detailed. It's been deployed to the live site\u2014enjoy!\n. Any version of Ruby that supports Bundler and Sass will be fine, but I'm not sure what the minimum version would be, so we'll look into it.\n. Looks like they're both 1.8.7, so we can make a note of it. We won't likely get into the nuance of managing Ruby versions in our documentation, because the user doesn't need to write any Ruby to work with our template stack; Ruby just needs to work. If you're incorporating our codebase into your own stack, you're probably savvy enough to handle the dependency stuff yourself.\n. Yes, that's how it should be. We've already fixed that issue in the template's gulpfile, so new projects won't have this issue.\n. The data still has to be serialized somehow in the Sass to get it to the JavaScript, but to be sure maybe trying to format it as actual JSON isn't the best idea. Ruby Sass has an inspect() function, which will create a string representation of any data type, but it isn't in libsass yet. So there's no way to natively serialize a map in libsass for now, which is why I wrote this function.\nSince this function is basically just to transmit a list of basic key/value pairs (always a string paired with another string), it doesn't necessarily need to be output as actual JSON; it could have been something closer to a CSV.\n@AntJanus was able to work out the cross-browser quirks with parsing the JSON, but libsass does mess it up because it outputs with different quotes. libsass support is a short-term goal, so we'll probably need to revisit how we pass these media queries around then.\nI don't see us dropping Ruby Sass until the two libraries are totally in sync, and when that happens we won't necessarily need to drop one or the other, because they should work the same. Ruby Sass is still the \"canonical\" version.\n. I like this idea, since & and = can't be in the keys or values, which means you can easily split the string by those characters. I'll put this in a branch and @AntJanus can finish the implementation on the JS end.\nEdit: Oh, sorry, I didn't realize you already did it for us :) We'll just make sure this works cross-browser then.\n. A null link will generate an Angular error.\nTo make it easy, I just brute-forced it and used the live URL of the link, like all the other links. 7baa963d8070fc5715c3c4de48eacaa21aa3f106\n. @wtfribley Yep, the dream was to have a purely CSS-positioned dropdown, but it opens you up to a few weird issues.\nTether is a really nice plugin, but it has one blind spot that's unique to our situation: it doesn't work great with elements inside multiple scrolling containers. This is critical for us, with the way our grid system works.\nAlso, from what I can tell, it would be difficult to add custom animation to Tether elements, because they're positioned with a transform. With Tether using that property, we can't override it to do any animation in and out. That's not super critical, though, since for popups having a fade in and out is probably good enough for now.\n. I'll sidestep the issue for now by just center-aligning the demo button.\nThere's a few more things we'd like to do with Tether, like creating a generic pin directive to attach any element to any other element, but that's farther down the road. We'll need to figure out how to better make Tether work with our stuff. At that point we'd probably just make the action sheet use that same code, and then it would be way more flexible.\n. Ah, that's because the grid elements inside the modal only have left and right padding. The bottommost element of each modal has a bottom margin, which is what creates that extra space. We'll update our examples to look better.\n. Looks like it's failing on the git clone step; do you have Git installed on your machine and a git command in your path?\n. It's written in the readme that you need it, but we should probably still add a warning when that error comes up. Never hurts to streamline things!\n. This is the change that introduced the issue: d1ce6aa6e9b6c4e544ba9a0a14cb3518f174d630\nThe intent was to have links in panels close the panels when you click on them, so we'll need to rework the directive slightly.\nMaybe that code should only be in our documentation-specific JS? That's why it was added, to close our nav menu when you click on something.\n. Yep, panels and off-canvas menus are meant to be totally general-purpose.\n. Yep, we can definitely look into it.\n. Are you building the documentation (this repo) or the template stack? And is there any other output in the command line you can paste?\n. Do you use JRuby? I did some research and it sounds like this is an issue with that. Another Apps user had this problem and was able to solve it by downgrading to version 1.7.15 of JRuby.\n. This is a side request, but since you're working on the refactor I'll ask: is it possible to grab the breakpoint list through a service or something? We have the code to grab them from the Sass for Interchange to use, but we had a request to make that list something you can access from anywhere. It might already be in there but I'm not sure.\n. Waiting until later makes sense I'd say.\n. Yep, 1.1 should be out before we're gone for the holidays.\n. @jaysonminard This refactor has been in place since 1.0.2. A big thing to put in a patch number, yes, but it was very early in the framework's life, and we needed it out anyway. We're putting out 1.1 tomorrow most likely.\n. There's another Webkit-specific option called -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d. Is there an example I can test this on?\n. Ah okay, no problem. There's a few things we need to make more clear in the documentation, like how a prefixing tool is required.\nCurious, did you make a Grunt version of our Gulp plugin that generates routes?\n. Well if you ever have time to put together a clean scaffold that uses Grunt instead of Gulp, throw it up on GitHub and we can link to it on our resources page.\n. Thanks, the Less detection was really confusing.\n. Yep, we need to look into it, I noticed the same issue with modals.\n. @AntJanus Looking at index.html, there are two example modals, both with overlay=\"false\", but an overlay still appears on the first one, #mainModal.\n. @AntJanus Ah okay, I guess I assumed that you could turn on and off clicking to close outside of a modal, independent of if the modal has a visible overlay or not. We don't need to change that right now, though.\n. This commit swaps the defaults for the modal parameters. Now by default, modals will have an overlay and clicking the overlay will close it. These two properties can be independently overridden with overlay=\"false\" and overlay-close=\"false\".\n. We haven't worked out all of the kinks with libsass quite yet, but we're working on it. Is there any more to the error you got or is that it?\n. Alright, we'll do some testing.\n. Are you importing the settings file before the main framework files? I think it's trying to find a variable called $include-css that's in _settings.scss.\n. Yep, that was the issue. We'll make sure to include the settings file in the Bower package in a future update.\nWe're also working on better documentation on how to use Foundation for Apps as a dependency.\n. How does removing the dot change the logic?\n. Ah, I see. So all of our globs shouldn't lead with ./?\n. We had this issue with panels as well, and solved it by removing the hardcoded transitions from the panel Sass, and instead having the directive automatically add a default animation. So we can do the same thing for notifications, where it just picks a good default based on the position (e.g., a top-right notification will slide in from the right).\n. @AntJanus Ah, well that actually sounds fine as a default. I can just remove the hard-coded transform on notifications (they're positioned with position: absolute and aligned with negative margins so it'll be good), allowing the motion classes to take over.\n. Our original plan was to put is-active in a variable, so you could change the active class on the entire framework, but do you think each component's specific active class should be customizable as well?\n. Right, I wasn't going to implement that until we had it working on the JS end too. But people like being able to change any class name we set, so we should look into it. It could be another parameter we serialize into that meta tag. Maybe we can set that up in 1.1.\n. You can reset the change and then force push the branch back to GitHub. Messy, yes, but it works. Just copy the text of the file you changed first so you don't lose it.\ngit reset --hard aca168f0b825d50dfbc13e0b3dc9bb0169f5c69f\ngit push origin master --force\nThat will overwrite your fork's master branch so it doesn't have that last commit.\nAnd to be sure, I would _never_ recommend force pushing to the main repo's master branch ;)\nEdit: Your other option is to run revert on the commit, but that creates a new commit that says \"I reverted this other one\".\n. Closing this, as we're instead going to change is-active on every component to be referenced by a variable.\n. The CLI is trying to find the bundle command. You should have Ruby on your machine, so run gem install bundler and then try again.\n. Hm, we'll look into it. Either way, if it got that far your project is fine. Just run bundle inside your project and it will be finished.\n. @cshenry13 Do you mean the contents of the new app's folder is empty?\n. Hm, that would suggest the git clone failed, but it should have tossed an error of some kind.\nCould you try running git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template.git myApp and see if it works? That's the exact command the CLI is running to initially set up the project.\nBy the way, we're working on a big update to the CLI which will drastically improve error-handling, so working through these errors is super helpful :)\nEdit: And for reference, this is the entire manual install process:\ngit clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template.git myApp\ncd myApp\nnpm install\nbower install\nbundle\nnpm start\n. Alright, looks like it's an issue with your machine's Git installation then. If you Google that error there are a few Stack Overflow discussions with possible fixes.\n. @iamontheinet @bclinkinbeard Have y'alls had the time to figure out the issue with your installs? One possibility is that Bundler is failing because it needs admin privileges. So if it fails on line 141 again, try running bundle manually, and if that fails, run sudo bundle instead. Some environments require admin privileges to install gems.\n. @anevaude Strange, do you see the steps underneath \"Installing dependencies...\", like npm => bower => bundler?\nnpm install would be the first command it's running, so it must be freezing there.\n. @spsaucier Ah yeah, that would be an issue. We should be able to force each install command to be non-interactive.\nWhen you did a manual install, did you ever need to use sudo?\n. @spsaucier Hmm, well maybe Bower was the only issue. Did you get hangups in any other step of the process when using foundation-apps new, like the npm step?\n. @spsaucier Hm, alrighty then. We're working on some upgrades to the CLI, the last thing we're doing is some Windows testing. I'll add a note to make NPM and Bower noninteractive.\n. Awesome! Happy to help. :)\n. Looks good, so if you write @include breakpoint(xxlarge only) and xxlarge is the last breakpoint in your list, the output should just be @media screen and (min-width: 120em), right?\nEdit: Tested myself, indeed that's what it does. Thanks!\n. We're in talks with a CDN right now; the plan is to try and get something up tomorrow, after we tag a 1.0.1 release.\n. #463 addresses this. We'd like it in the codebase for version 1.1.\n. What browser and OS are you seeing it in?\n. @AntJanus That sounds good, since the user doesn't really need to interact with an element while it's moving anyway. You could add that class to the motion of _motion.scss.\n. Relative positioning is necessary to position a panel, because they use position: absolute. That doesn't mean every block needs relative positioning though, as that would cause weird issues.\n. This is an older issue, but we think it's been resolved, partially through moving the HTML of the panels to the right position in the markup: 6aed7d5e654daa5a11e82a89f59ebd406c49e2a1\nIf you want panels to overlap a grid element, the panels should be siblings of the grid block, not inside the grid block. This was causing a flicker on some platforms; I saw it on iOS specifically before this fix.\nIf you see anything else odd let us know.\n. #312 should fix this; it was an issue with the capitalization of folders.\n. We just fixed the capitalization issue with the docs folder (#312) so this shouldn't be a problem anymore. You may need to delete your repo and re-clone it, though.\n. Go for it! I'll make sure everyone sitting around me knows :)\n. @mrsafraz It doesn't, all of the Apps-specific stuff is in the same package for now.\nWe've had some internal conversations about this, and if we decide to segment the libraries it likely won't be until a version 2. Mainly we'd need to know that there's a group of folks willing to dedicate time to maintaining ports of the framework, so we could potentially have versions for Angular, Ember, Durandal, etc. That will give us extra incentive to split our codebase in two.\nFor now, we just recommend folks include the Bower package and ignore the JavaScript files in there. Where we can we'll see about keeping the Sass flexible enough to work with other frameworks.\n. @mrsafraz When you have something good to show, put it on GitHub and we can feature it! We're looking to promote ports of the framework to other SPA tools.\n. @mrsafraz Those view animations are super slick. That's something built into Durandal?\n. Ah okay. Just in general though the act of view transitioning seems to work really well. UI Router doesn't really do it out of the box, and we've had a lot of... fun trying to make it work without any visual bugs.\n. So from the Sass end, the main hassle is getting the codebase to where it supports the ng-enter-style transitions and the class-based transitions, ideally without a ton of code bloat. Each style has a setup class and a transition class, but they don't work the same.\nWith ng-enter, you define the transition on the setup class; with *-add, you define the transition on the finishing class. So it's not as easy as just adding a comma to insert support for -add and -add-active, but I think there's still a way.\n. @stryju We won't need to change any styles, really, just class output, but that's what's tricky. Ideally we don't have to refactor the Sass a ton. Although i guess there are only five transition mixins right now.\n. Alright, here's roughly what the Sass would look like. And I think that's properly following the unique rules of both animation styles.\n- ng-enter gets transition definitions and the \"before\" state.\n- ng-enter-active gets the \"after\" state.\n- *-add gets a 0s transition and the \"before\" state.\n- *-add-active gets transition definitions and the \"after\" state.\nThe final code would use @content instead of @extend.\n. @AntJanus You can use this code which has an example fadeIn that should work with ng-enter and -add. What I wasn't sure about is if there's an opposite of -add, or if you use -add in both directions, in and out.\n. Yep, that should be a font-size property, good catch.\n. I think that's an issue with Autoprefixer, but I'm not getting the same error on a fresh clone. We'll look into it, though.\n. A few of us have been getting intermittent errors with Autoprefixer. Sometimes Autoprefixer tries to parse raw Sass files instead of compiled CSS, and if it does it'll freak out.\nMaybe it happens if Sass encounters an error, so instead of piping CSS to Autoprefixer it pipes Sass files? I'm not totally sure how that specific plugin works.\nEither way, if you keep having issues let us know. At the moment we aren't seeing any errors with compiling the docs.\n. @etcook This is a fun bug. Go into the Gulpfile and comment out the lines that run Autoprefixer.\njs\n// Compile stylesheets with Ruby Sass\ngulp.task('sass', function() {\n  return sass('docs/assets/scss/', {\n      loadPath: ['scss'],\n      style: 'nested',\n      bundleExec: true\n    })\n    .on('error', function(err) {\n      console.log(err.message);\n    })\n    // .pipe(autoprefixer({\n    //   browsers: ['last 2 versions', 'ie 10']\n    // }))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/assets/css/'));\n});\nNow run npm start and let it compile\u2014it will run fine. Now quit the process, uncomment those lines, and run npm start again. It will magically work this time. We're not really sure why.\n. @etcook I think it's an issue with Sass sourcemap files being piped to the autoprefixer() function, but I'm not sure why it only sometimes happens.\n. The primary class is just for color scheming (it uses the $primary-color variable as a base), it doesn't mean \"primary\" as in \"main\". Also, in this case, there shouldn't be any classes in the mixin itself, only in the CSS output at the bottom.\nIt was sort of a coin toss for us if menu bar should have a bottom margin or not. There are plenty of cases where you don't want a margin on it, like if it's being used as a toolbar, but if it's being used inline, or in a sidebar with more content, you'd want that spacing at the bottom. We could look again at just making it margin: 0 by default.\n. If you're using the most recent build of the template stack, which defines all import paths near the top of the file, you can fix this by swapping the two paths in the sassPaths variable so they look like this:\nscss\n// Line 26\nvar sassPaths = [\n  'client/assets/scss',\n  'bower_components/foundation-apps/scss'\n];\nThis will grab the _settings.scss in your client folder instead of bower_components. I made the change in the template stack as well.\nThe next version of the CLI will automatically copy the settings file out of the Bower package into your client folder when a new project is made.\n. This change to the detached off-canvas mixin should fix the issue:\n``` scss\n@mixin off-canvas-detached {\n  z-index: 0;\n  box-shadow: none;\n  // Hide the menu when it's not active\n  display: none;\n&, &.is-active {\n    transform: none;\n    // Show the menu when it's active\n    display: block;\n  }\n& ~ #{$offcanvas-frame-selector} {\n    z-index: 1;\n    box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);\n  }\n}\n```\nI tried adding the detached class to one of the sample off-canvas menus in the docs, but the is-active class was always there for some reason, even when the menu wasn't supposed to be open.\n. Actually, the method above should work, but slightly different.\nThe issue is that a detached off-canvas doesn't hide off the screen when it isn't active; it just sits there. This means if you open a different off-canvas on another side of the screen, you'll see that first detached menu just sitting there. We don't want that.\nI tried making the detached menu display: none, and then switching to display: block when it's active. This sort of works, because it means the detached menu is hidden until it's made active, and since it doesn't ever animate, flipping from none to block instantly is okay.\nHowever, when you go to close the detached menu, it disappears instantly. This is because the is-active class is being removed as the app frame starts to slide back into place.\nThere's probably a few ways to solve the problem, but it would need to happen with JavaScript. There's two ways I can think to do it:\n- When a detached off-canvas menu is closing, wait until the grid-frame is done transitioning to hide the menu.\n- When an off-canvas menu is open, force all the others to hide.\n. Actually again, @jeaniec and I were working on a JS-based solution when we came up with something simpler: just make the z-index of detached menus lower than the others. That covers them up. Problem solved!\n. Closing in favor of #386.\n. Far easier said than done :) We don't currently have any plans to port Foundation for Apps to other JavaScript frameworks, but we'll certainly support anyone in the community who wants to write a port.\nIt's also possible to use Angular and Meteor in tandem, so there's probably a way to put Meteor on top of our code, instead of actually porting everything.\n. Ah, the functions aren't yet imported when the settings file is being processed. We'll put in a fix, but you can work around it for now by importing the functions file before your settings file:\nscss\n@import \"helpers/functions\";\n@import \"settings\";\n@import \"foundation\";\n. This commit fixes the issue: 339f164ea4ac030ad4dd12dfbe2c02085e7b83df\n. We replaced the string interpolation with a mixin. It works like this:\n``` scss\n@include breakpoint(medium) {\n  / ... /\n}\n@include breakpoint(large only) {\n  / ... /\n}\n```\nThe list of breakpoints are in the $breakpoints variable in your settings file. This mixin will also take pixel and em values as well.\nscss\n@include breakpoint(200px) {\n  /* ... */\n}\n. Very good point. I went ahead and replaced the href attributes with ui-sref, to emphasize that it's the actual way links are written when using Angular + UI Router.\nWe won't add more pages most likely, because the template stack should be as stripped down as possible. If you had pages for about, news, contact, etc., you'd just end up deleting or renaming them for every new project.\n. Hey, sorry for getting to this late. We definitely want to start using the template cache, since we're already running into problems with the hardcoded template paths we have, and it would also just make distributing our code easier.\nWe're trying to get 1.0.3 out the door today, but it would be nice to have this functionality in place for our next version, which will probably be 1.1. 1.0.3 will introduce a dist folder into the Bower package which has compiled CSS and JavaScript. For future versions it would make sense for the templates file to be in there as well.\nSince the Gulpfile has been refactored quite a bit recently, would you like to re-do your PR against the new codebase? And thanks for your work! :)\n. Awesome, thank you. You'll see that the new Gulpfile has a task called deploy:dist, which generates compiled assets for Bower and npm.\n. Sounds like we can keep the functionality as it is, but add information about the directive to the documentation.\n. Yep, looks like $small-font-color wasn't being applied to the small selector.\n. We made the call to not include radius and rounded classes in Foundation for Apps, and it's possible we'll do the same thing for version 6 of Foundation for Sites. It does make it look like the two frameworks are out of sync in some ways, but Foundation 5 is also more than a year old, so there were plenty of new ideas we've had that are being implemented first here, and eventually will with Sites as well.\nThe reason we got rid of the radius and rounded classes is because they serve a purpose better filled by Sass. Most components, including buttons, have a border radius variable, which allows you to globally modify the radius on that component. This is a much easier and more sustainable approach than adding radius and rounded to every button. Coloring and sizing also change the meaning and purpose of your buttons; the border radius tends to be just a stylistic choice.\n. The standalone framework files (all Sass, JS, and Iconic assets) are distributed through Bower and NPM. If you want to use our components in a Rails project, you'll want to add the framework to your asset pipeline. There are a few tools that connect Bower and Rails, including rails-assets and bower-rails.\n. Sorry, I know this is an older issue, but the markup for this panel is incorrect. Panels should never go inside .grid-content elements; they should always anchor to a .grid-block element instead. This means a panel and the content it overlaps are sibling elements in the DOM.\nHere's how to fix your example:\nhtml\n<div class='grid-block'>\n  <!-- Moved the panel up one level -->\n  <zf-panel id='bp' position='bottom'>\n    <a zf-close='' class='close-button'>&times;</a>\n    panel content\n  </zf-panel>\n  <!-- The sidebar and main content are siblings of the panel -->\n  <div class='grid-content'>sidebar</div>\n  <div class='small-8 grid-content'>\n    <a class='button' zf-toggle='bp'>Panel</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\nI added a section to the panel documentation that clarifies this rule.\n. @mikehuebner Yep, that's it! To expand on what @AntJanus said, Gulp, Grunt, et al. are build tools that are meant to be run in a development environment only, and are primarily used to deliver static code. The servers that you can run with Gulp and Grunt (and even frameworks like Django and Rails) are meant for convenience and testing only, not production.\nYou could automate this process in Gulp by creating a deployment task that uses rsync, FTP, SSH, etc. to upload the build folder for you. We do this to deploy the documentation.\n. We have a refactor of the animation libraries in progress (#386) so we'll make sure this issue is covered there.\n. We merged in #386, which does address the scenario where the user clicks to another state mid-transition. The other two states will disappear, and the new one will animate in.\nThese changes will be in for version 1.1 of the framework, which we're hoping to have out by the end of the week.\n. Try running npm start build manually in your command line and see if that works. Occasionally we've had issues where, for some reason, the user's machine freaks out if you add more arguments after npm start.\n. Yep, it looks like version 2.0.0 of npm introduced that change. I added a remark to the Install & Update page advising users to update their system's npm if they aren't installing a new copy of Node.\n. Awesome, glad to hear it!\n. You shouldn't have to copy those files yourself out of bower_components; Gulp does that for you. However, there was an issue with the template stack's Gulpfile not properly copying HTML partials. This pull request fixed the problem; if you look at how the Gulpfile was changed, you can fix the issue in your project.\n. The first issue is one of selector specificity, so adding a bunch of >s should help, and won't break any existing code. We had this issue with another component where is-active was cascading down too far.\n. Going to close this, if the problem still persists let us know. :)\n. It's a known issue with Orbit, our slider plugin that comes with Foundation 5.\n. @AntJanus We can take a look on our end. As for the height thing, in most cases, the view will be a flex child, which means its width and height are automatically calculated. The whole point of this framework is that it's responsive, so if you're setting a fixed height you're probably gonna have a bad time. Although I could see people using for nested views.\n. I pushed a small update to the CSS for transitioning views, and it seems to work pretty well, although I didn't test it extensively. If you pull down the branch and click between the Install/Update and Sass pages, you can see it working.\nI'm not sure if these updates cover it, but the module needs to account for any combination of views missing and in/out animation. Like this:\n| Old View | New View | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| has out | has in | Both animate at the same time |\n| has out | no in | New view immediately appears, old view animates out |\n|  |  | Old view gets higher z-index |\n| no out | has in | New view animates in, old view immediately disappears |\n|  |  | New view gets higher z-index |\n| no out | no in | Both swap immediately |\nIn the last use case, the module shouldn't do any of this logic, like adding position: absolute classes and so on. That should all be bypassed so the views animate immediately. It seems like right now there's a small delay because all of the same stuff is happening even though it's not needed.\n. Just hacked together a basic test app for the motion stuff. It has four views, which have every possible combination of in/out animations, so you can test, say, what happens if an exiting view has an out animation, but the new view has no in animation. Run gulp test:motion to turn it on.\n. If you're adding the components to your own stack, you need to make sure the HTML templates for each directive are being picked up by Angular. In our template stack, we copy the partials from bower_components/foundation-apps/js/angular/components/**/*.html to build/components.\n. Going to close this, let me know if the above was able to solve your issue, or if you still have problems.\n. @gjungb @zavan Yep, until we have a templates JavaScript file in a stable version, you'll have to use a task runner to pull the templates out of the framework files. Below is an example of using the ng-html2js library with Gulp. There's a Grunt version of the plugin as well.\njs\nvar partials = gulp.src('bower_components/js/angular/components/**/*.html')\n  .pipe($.ngHtml2js({\n    prefix: 'components/',\n    moduleName: 'foundation',\n    declareModule: false\n  }))\n  .pipe($.concat('templates.js'))\n  .pipe($.uglify())\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/js'));\n. @zavan Glad to hear it! If you make anything interesting with it, let us know. We're building some stuff internally (even for clients now!) so we're learning a lot about how fully-responsive web apps would work. and we'd love to hear what design/technical challenges other developers are running into.\n. Nice! We'd like to see this functionality added for notifications too, if possible. Right now there are programmatic notifications, but you need an empty element with the zf-notification-set directive to make them work.\n. :+1: Awesome! We'll take a look!\n. Looks good! A few comments:\n- All three of the stagger mixins could likely be combined into one, unless you think there's a chance any of the three would be used in another context. But as it is they're fairly tightly coupled anyway.\n- It may not be necessary to call stagger() inside each motion mixin, as the stagger functionality exists independent of whatever motion is happening. Instead you could call stagger() three times at the bottom of the file where all the CSS classes are, once for each stagger length.\n. Awesome work, James! :) We can include it in version 1.1.\n. Merge'd. 9fc2f16721ed47a19a919c6ae0565d0d633a575d\n. The classes that apply those visual styles to the grid examples were overriding the offset class, so I fixed that. The actual grid won't have that issue under normal circumstances.\n. This error doesn't seem to be cropping up anymore, but if you have any more issues compiling the docs locally, let us know.\n. This is the intended behavior, although you could make the case that it doesn't need to be full height. Full width seems sensible, however. Modals are kind of like grid rows in that they have a max width.\n. This commit adds a .dialog class which turns off the full-bleed functionality of mobile modals.\n. As a temporary workaround, you can comment out the uglify step of the JavaScript build process. It's in the uglify task in Gulpfile.js:\njs\ngulp.src(foundationJS)\n    // .pipe(uglify({\n    //   beautify: true,\n    //   mangle: false\n    // }).on('error', function(e) {\n    //   console.log(e);\n    // }))\n    .pipe(concat('foundation.js'))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/assets/js/'))\n  ;\nBut, we can look into modifying the Gulpfile to have separate processes for development and production. I'll add it to our internal roadmap.\n. You might be interested in gulp-if, which can conditionally run files through a pipe. So only pipe to uglify() if production = true or something like that.\n. @etcook Oh! Sorry about that, skipped right over it when I loaded the page. But yes, we'd be interested in seeing what that would look like. A production flag should compress the Sass as well, while keeping it expanded while in development. The flag should probably be false by default, so that when you download the template you're already in development mode.\n. Just got this implemented in the template project, using the code @etcook wrote. Check it out!\nAdding the --production flag to gulp or gulp build will enable compressed mode in node-sass, and Uglify for JavaScript.\n. Right when the framework launched we were seeing a bizarre bug in just IE10/11 where, when autoscroll was on the view container, the entire left-hand sidebar was misaligned. And when you took it off, everything went back to normal.\nBut I tried adding the attribute back and everything works fine now. Not sure what that was! So we can definitely merge this.\n. We closed out the PR related to this issue last week; you can read my comment on why we closed it. Basically we're trying to keep the template stack as slim on features as possible, to reduce the number of moving parts. It's meant to be a baseline that more experienced users can build on.\n. No, pedantry is great :) Thanks for catching it!\n. Good catch, they should all be singular.\n. The issue is trying to interconnect the components when you don't know what the class names could be. Because we allow the user to write their own class names with the mixins, you don't know if that button will actually be .button, or .custom-button-class or something else.\nIn this specific case, it's probably fine to modify the selector to also look for input[type=\"submit\"], input[type=\"button\"], and button as well, because the use case of the .inline-label element is very specific\u2014it's meant for inputs, buttons, labels, and nothing else.\n. Yeah, button groups would need updating, and there may be a few other edge cases as well. Foundation 5 has a few blind spots like that actually. It's really hard sometimes to combine UI components when you don't know what their class name is ;)\nIconic is a unique case because the JavaScript always adds the .iconic class, so we don't have to worry about that one changing.\n. You can use any existing Angular library with Foundation for Apps. As you've figured out, normal JavaScript libraries don't work because single-page app frameworks are always swapping in and out HTML. Most plugins are designed to be initialized once, when the page loads and all the HTML is assumed to be there.\nThe Angular UI project has a lot of good libraries, including a Google Maps one you may be interested in.\n. The CSS classes are written to use Angular's animation module. So to make the animations work, you either need to use a directive that supports animation (like ng-show, ng-repeat, etc.) or use the $animate service to trigger them yourself.\n. @saviour123 There aren't any tutorials that I know of specifically about Foundation for Apps's motion library, but our documentation does a good job of explaining all of the key pieces: directive/view animation and using the Sass mixins.\nEventually the new Motion UI library will be plugged into this one. We'll likely do that at 1.2 and then remove the existing transition mixins for 1.3.\n. Closing in favor of #417.\n. Take a look at this CSS Tricks article, which gets into a few methods for restarting animations. The two solutions it references are:\n1. Remove the animation class, force a reflow, and then re-add the class. If you just remove the class and then immediately re-add it, the browser doesn't perceive it as an actual change in state. There are a few ways to do this\u2014the one referenced in the article is element.offsetWidth = element.offsetWidth;.\n2. Reset the play state. The CSS property is called animation-play-state, and the JavaScript version is animationPlayState. Change it to paused, and then immediately change it to running, and the animation will play again. Of course, the property is vendor prefixed, so you'll need to modify webkitAnimationPlayState and so on.\nHope that helps!\n. There is an infinite class you can apply to an animating element, and that will make the animation play forever. It seemed like your use case, though, was needing to get the animation to play again at some point. But, if you just need the animation to play forever without stopping, you can just add the class infinite.\n. Merged #421 which fixes this.\n. Like the others have said, this doesn't seem to be an issue with our Bower package. Stack Overflow or Super User should be better equipped to help you :)\n. The template stack doesn't come with any unit tests; are you writing your own?\n. Hm, could you post the tests you've written?\n. Thanks for the repo link; taking a look at this today.\n. Well, I got a totally different set of errors when I tried to run the tests, but either way I think I might know the problem.\nWhen the Sass is compiled to CSS, it drops the media query list into a property with a meta selector. The JavaScript then injects a <meta> tag with the same class and parses the value. If the test suite doesn't have a finished CSS file to reference, it can't read those values, which is why the mediaQueries object comes up null.\n. You'd need to compile the Sass files to CSS so that the test browser can see them.\nThis is the error I get. I think it's happening because the Gulp plugin that generates routes isn't being run, so the foundationRoutes variable is never being created.\nChrome 40.0.2214 (Mac OS X 10.10.1) AboutController should create \"phones\" model with 3 phones FAILED\n    Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module wxPortal due to:\n    Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module foundation.dynamicRouting due to:\n    ReferenceError: foundationRoutes is not defined\n. If needed, you can also get away with less than that. This is the only line you need:\ncss\nmeta.foundation-mq {\n  font-family: \"small=0&medium=40rem&large=75rem&xlarge=90rem&xxlarge=120rem\"; }\nThis style could also be added programmatically before Foundation initializes, using the CSSStyleSheet.insertRule() method.\n. True that; if you want to put HTML examples in a <code> element, you need to escape the angle brackets. So <div> becomes &lt;div&gt;.\nFor code blocks, our documentation uses an Angular port of highlight.js. It handles the escaping and syntax highlighting for us.\n. 1.0.2 is the newest version of the framework. We're looking to put another version out next week.\n. We can add those missing files to the bower.json. Should that property also include every Sass file?\n. @joshuajohnson814 I agree, and in fact it shouldn't be there anymore. Our documentation uses a different entry file, and the template stack also uses it's own. If you're incorporating the source files into your own build process, that file is unnecessary, although it does serve as a useful template.\nAs for including distribution files, we can look at it for the next patch. We're considering including a dist folder on the same repo, for this and perhaps also Foundation for Sites, to avoid the hassle of having a separate repo just for the Bower install.\n. @joshuajohnson814 The main issue we've had with the file is that some folks assumed it was a module to be included as a dependency, when it's just meant to be boilerplate. Also, since it's in the bower_components folder, which means it probably isn't in version control, you can't edit it.\nBut we haven't heard anything recently, so we can let it sit for now :)\n. So for JavaScript you just add every file, but how does it work with Sass files? I was looking at wiredep (which is what @laurent-le-graverend is using) but I couldn't figure out exactly how it works with Sass. Since Sass files are pre-compiled, it's not like you're concatenating them all together; you just need an import path. So I'm wondering if the main property of bower.json needs every Sass file or just the entry point.\n. I see, so it's not for source files. Thanks! We'll set up a dist folder for the next patch.\n. Alright, this commit adds a Gulp task to create a dist folder with minified and un-minified CSS and JS: e6aab4e097abafce1ccce6586f0bd5d7726dde97\nAnd this commit is me forgetting to update the main entry in bower.json ;) f5e33b0d3abf8d3817555c7b5a7361902794f1a7\nWe're trying to put out 1.0.3 this week, which will be the first version with the dist folder.\n. @joshuajohnson814 Ah, okay. In that case, what would be the best way to package the other dependencies for distribution? Maybe just bundle all of the external libraries into one file?\nObviously wiredep helps with this dependency resolution, but not everyone will be using that. Some folks will just want to drop in finished files to get going.\n. @laurent-le-graverend The way you described module loading already works with our current file structure. Originally you had to add each UI component's module separately, but in version 1.0.2 we added a foundation module which is just a shorthand for all of the UI components.\nBut as far as the compilation step, it sounds like the dist file should just be our framework files, and not any of the five or so libraries we rely on. So we'll make that change. (This also brings into stark relief how many dependencies this library has right now. Maybe for version 2 we'll look at separating modules that have dependencies, like our touch stuff.)\nAs far as using template caching, we've gotten that request before, so we'll look into it.\n. Merged in #433 which addresses this. Thanks for your help, friends!\n. Material Design is a very opinionated style guide, which is good for what it's doing, but it's not the role of our framework to make all of those decisions related to layout, hierarchy, and styling. Because of that, we won't be skinning any of the Foundation frameworks to look like Material.\nHowever, if you would like to write a Material theme and open source it, we can promote it for you :)\n. Definitely, we need this functionality for off-canvas and panels.\n. @maxcook We'd like to do this and the darkened overlay, but we haven't done any work on it yet. We'd certainly welcome a pull request if anyone wants to take a crack at it.\n@soumak77 We have zfClosable, would it be possible to bake any hooks into that?\n. What you're thinking of is the template stack, which is a separate repo. However, we're trying to keep the build process on that thing as slim as possible, or at least as slim as a complete build process can be. With that in mind, we don't want to add any more plugins to that thing at the moment.\nThat being said, this repo would certainly benefit from having linters to check the Sass and JavaScript. I started fixing up the Sass to conform to one standard, but I haven't finished it yet.\n. @escapedcat Right now we don't have a good way to update the Gulpfile. The problem is, if you've changed it at all, how are we supposed to effectively update it? The hope was to get the framework and stack to the point that we don't need to update the Gulpfile for a while.\nThis template is significantly more complex than the ones we use for Foundation 5, but for better or worse it kinda has to be.\nIf a patch ever mandates a change in the Gulpfile (which we'll try hard to avoid going forward), the changelog will include instructions on how to update an existing project.\n. Hey, thanks for putting this together. One issue is that we're deploying files to a CDN for use in CodePens and such, and those files should probably include all of the JavaScript in one big file, while the dist folder should be just the framework files. I can implement that myself, though.\n. After doing some research, we found that the solution might have to be iPad-specific CSS that uses calc() to cut those extra pixels off the height of the grid frame. So, hooray for user agent sniffing?\n. #456 could solve this, basically using height: 100% instead of height: 100vh to size things. It needs more testing, though.\n. I've got a new PR open (#603) which appears to be a better solution.\nWe will make iOS play nice with web apps.\n. Last solution, promise! bc01826c7bd1eb8e4ed6fb3bf293fcb0aebcaf9f fixes this issue. Tested in iOS 7 and 8 on the iPhone and iPad, and it works great.\n. Could you use the plain justify-content property instead? Using a grid mixin here means the menu bar would have a dependency on the grid component, and ideally no component is dependent on another (unless it's a sub-component, like button group).\n. Ah yeah, it's a typo in the node-sass task. Changing this line of the code will fix it. autoprefixer should be $.autoprefixer.\n. Thanks for making the changes. :)\n. As of Firefox 35 this doesn't appear to be an issue anymore. Since Firefox auto-updates, this shouldn't be a huge problem.\n. Alright, fixed it by converting the hex value to an RGB one on the fly.\n. Do these sorts of techniques negatively affect the cascade at all?\n. In theory any of the basic Sites components that don't require any JavaScript will work just fine, since it's just CSS. There's also an Angular library for the Foundation 5 JS plugins, written as Angular directives.\nBut yeah, we're definitely looking into ways to make the components more consistent between the two frameworks.\n. Obviously components with the same names conflict (labels, tabs, etc.), but there is one example of a component with the same name but two very different purposes in the two frameworks: panels. In Sites, .panel is just a colored box, but in Apps, it's the off-canvas component.\nTo get around this, we're looking for a name to replace \"panel\" in the next version of Sites. It's probably going to be \"callout\", since we're also combining panels and alerts into one CSS component.\n. Containers should be nested inside content blocks. Using your existing code, I can just swap out the first grid-block and make it grid-content instead. The two are totally interchangeable.\nhtml\n<body>\n<div class=\"grid-frame vertical\">\n  <div class=\"grid-content\" style=\"background-color: green;\">\n    <div class=\"grid-container\">\n      <div class=\"grid-block\" style=\"background-color: yellow;\">\n        Yellow\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"grid-block\" style=\"background-color: blue;\">\n        Blue\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"grid-block\" style=\"background-color: black;\">\n    <div class=\"grid-container\">\n      <div class=\"grid-block\" style=\"background-color: yellow;\">\n        Yellow\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"grid-block\" style=\"background-color: blue;\">\n        Blue\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\nSince grid-block is a flex container, it's children don't behave like normal flow content. grid-content is not a flex container, which means its children will function normally. grid-container is just a margin: 0 auto; container with a maximum width, so it has to be inside grid-content to function properly.\n. We're working on an official tutorial for the framework, which clarifies these concepts, and then some of that should make it back into the main documentation.\nThis grid is a complex beast, so questions like this are very helpful to us :) Thanks!\n. Going to test this and merge it today for 1.2.\n. We have the pieces in place, so for future releases the compiled CSS and JS will be available in a dist directory of the Bower folder. (It's here in the Gulpfile.) We're planning on releasing version 1.0.3 by the end of the week, which will be the first version of the framework to include distribution files.\nIn the mean time, the source Sass files are available in the Bower package. A good number of them, most importantly the Flexbox grid, can be used without any JavaScript.\n. We have a contributing document which has some recommendations for how to submit issues and pull requests. We don't currently have any Angular-specific guidelines, though. Was there a question you had on how to modify the codebase?\n. We really need to set up linters for this codebase, we just haven't gotten to it yet. The broad strokes are already there; all of our Angular modules are written in the same style, so following those general conventions is a good start. As far as specifics, hopefully we can get JSHint set up at some point, but in the mean time, just try to match our coding style as best you can. If we think something is suspect in a PR, we'll point it out :)\n. They'll work just fine! Since there's no JavaScript component to them, like with Iconic, you can just drop in the Sass and the icon fonts no problem.\n. After some internal chit-chat we decided to leave this as-is, so you can style a modal overlay and the modal itself with one class. This commit updates the documentation to explain what's up: 96e80a59b9f45c06c98f54a51cb34d8c92b0f15e\n. Closing in favor of #603.\n. Menu bar includes an .is-active class which can highlight an active item.\nYou can also use ui-sref-active to apply a class when a specific state is the current one.\nhtml\n<ul class=\"menu-bar\">\n  <li ui-sref-active=\"is-active\"><a ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a></li>\n  <li ui-sref-active=\"is-active\"><a ui-sref=\"about\">About</a></li>\n</ul>\n. The off-canvas menu has no built-in styles; it's just an empty box. If you're nesting a vertical menu bar inside of it, you can do what I described above. If you have your own custom component, you can use ui-sref-active and make your own custom active state class.\n. @akiran, I think ui-sref-active would cover the use-case you're describing, where you have a menu and the current item (the current view) is highlighted. If it's not a state-specific thing you're targeting, you can still use the is-active class to highlight things based on other criteria.\nLet us know if you have any more questions :)\n. For sure, I'm going to write one today. Here's a very brief overview.\n``` scss\n// You can use any named breakpoint in the $breakpoints map\n@include breakpoint(small) { } // Small and up\n@include breakpoint(medium only) { }\n@include breakpoint(medium down) { }\n// You can also use px, rem, or em values, which are all converted to em\n@include breakpoint(400px) { }\n@include breakpoint(60rem down) { }\n```\nAs for your grid issues, what version of iOS are you on? We just had a round of QA for iOS 7 and 8, and everything seemed fine.\n. About half of the components, most importantly the grid, will work without Angular or even JavaScript. So you could drop in the CSS for the basic components and it would work fine.\nIt's also possible to use Angular without any of the routing stuff, which is to say you can use Angular for things that aren't single-page apps. If you want to keep your backend largely the same, where ASP.Net is generating and serving HTML to the client, that's the way to go.\nIf you still wanted the single-page app feel, you'd have to do a fair amount of refactoring on the back-end. To make a SPA framework work with APS.Net, Rails, etc., the server-side framework has to essentially become an API. Because Angular does all of the templating work, the server then just serves up data as JSON, which the client compiles into HTML.\n. Here's the page: http://foundation.zurb.com/apps/docs/#!/media-queries\n. We've talked about it, we just need to decide how to implement it. We don't have access to jQuery's slideToggle in Angular, and animating max-height isn't a sustainable way to do it.\nMost likely we'll need to write our own thing to do it properly.\n. What's the purpose of running the uncompressed file through css-condense? Is it just for stripping out comments?\n. Actually, I'd like the CSS-style comments to be stripped out as well if that's possible. We're looking to get into automatically-generated documentation, and for doing HTML-specific documentation we might use Hologram, which requires you to use CSS-style comments to enclose documentation.\nI was actually looking for a CSS minifying tool that would just strip out comments and not do any other compression. Sass won't remove them unless it's also compressing the file.\n. Are you trying to write the theme just with the settings variables, or are you adding your own CSS overrides as well?\n. Totally! We'll look into it.\n. Awesome, thank you!\nHow do you think we should handle this in the template stack? Ideally the build process on that thing stays as simple as possible, although we're doing a lot of building from source at the moment.\nWe can either copy the finished file from dist, or add ng2HtmlJs to the process. The former is quicker to implement and is one less piece of machinery, but the latter is more customizable.\nIn general that's a balancing act we're trying to strike. Like, we could have the template stack just copy all of the compiled files, but then you can't later pick and choose which ones you want to include. On the other hand, if you actually know how this stuff works, you're probably smart enough to just do it yourself. The template stack is meant to be a baseline, and ideally it has as few moving parts as possible, to make it less error-prone and easy for beginners to understand.\n. Every Angular engineer we've talked to before and after this thing came out has asked \"can I just use it in my own project?\" Our template stack is definitely just meant to be a baseline, so maybe in the interest of reducing its complexity we cut out some of the choice. Of course the choice is still there, if you know what you're doing. But if you know what you're doing, you might just be ditching our entire build process anyway in favor of your own. If you don't know what you're doing, you're probably designing a prototype, so optimal delivery of files isn't yet a concern.\n. Related: #397\n. Hey, sorry for not getting back to you sooner!\nElement queries are definitely interesting, we just need to find the right way to implement them. As far as adding new libraries, we're trying to be really cautious about it right now, since the framework already has seven dependencies. If we add anything new, it probably won't be until a v2, when we can take a step back and figure out what libraries we're using.\nI'm going to close this and continue the discussion in #538, since you seem to have honed in on an possible solution.\n. Looks to be a side effect of how our settings parser works, since it prints out each set of variables in the order the files come. Thankfully button group is the only component with a dependency on another component's variables.\n. The container is just meant to center content inside a grid-content element. It shouldn't be a flex container, because it's just supposed to contain plain-old flow content. We might need to update the documentation to make this more clear, though.\nAn example of its use would be:\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-frame\">\n  <div class=\"grid-content\">\n    <div class=\"grid-container\"></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n. Yep, that should work. If not, I can try to make a more complete example.\n. Yeah, that's a really tricky thing. We want mixins for all of our components so they'll be more flexible, but at some point you still need to mimic our markup structure to an extent for it to work. This grid in particular is that way because of how flexbox works, and because it's new.\n. We fixed this in 1.0.3 (53d5952802e7d7da667c3fb19f73e0a39bc0591e), so now all <a> elements, not just ones with an href attribute, get the pointer cursor. Since there are no hrefs in Angular apps, browsers weren't applying the proper cursor to elements that are technically links.\nThe templates are all being updated right now, and they'll use the latest version of the framework when they're done.\n. We've gotten a lot of requests to create a datepicker for Foundation for Sites, so for version 6 of that framework we're going to do it, as an external plugin. Once that work is done, we could definitely wrap that functionality in an Angular module.\n. http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-datetime\n. Going to close this as a known feature request. We're working on a date/time picker for Foundation 6, and whatever we come up with there, we could definitely port over to Angular.\n. Nice, thanks for the work!\n. Hey, sorry for getting to this issue late. I tried your second code example verbatim and it worked for me on desktop and on iPad. I also removed all of the JavaScript like you described, and it still works. (Which makes sense, because none of the components you're using have JS elements.) Is it possible you got a Sass error or something?\n. Fixed with this pull request: #478 Sorry for the hassle!\n. Have you written any jQuery code related to panels? If you just remove jQuery, do the animations start working again?\n. Hey guys, sorry for the late response, but let's try to untangle this web of fun. Things that cause panels to unintentionally close are:\n- Having jQuery loaded\n- An element with a transition inside of the panel\n- Nested panels\nSeems like the last two happen because transitionend bubbles up unintentionally. #547 fixes this, so we'll bring in that change once we've reviewed it. Will that also fix the first issue with jQuery?\n. Alright, luckily this is an easy fix. You're passing the wrong parameter to the grid-frame() mixin.\n``` scss\n// Wrong\n@include grid-frame(vertical);\n// Right\n@include grid-frame($orientation: vertical);\n```\nMaking this one change fixes the issue, so the layout looks like the first screenshot, including on the iPad. The documentation was incorrect, as the first parameter of that mixin is $size, not $orientation. Size shouldn't even be an option, though, since you shouldn't be changing the width or height of the app frame, so we need to refactor that mixin slightly.\n. It's definitely something we should address in more detail. The main points of interest are Angular (IE9+ as of Angular 1.3, which we're using) and flexbox (IE10+), but there are lots of little things in the CSS and JS where we get to cut corners because we're only accounting for modern browsers. Like using modern CSS selectors, or DOM features only in newer browsers.\nIn terms of how to detect it, I think flexbox, like you said, is the most obvious way to check for general compatibility. Flexbox support was our original metric for browser support, so once we knew we were cutting IE9 and Android 2 as a result, we just went from there.\nPerhaps we could come up with a small, non-Angular script to drop in a Modernizr-like CSS class to detect lack of support.\nAnd to your point about separate module support, that's possible right now! Our sample bootstrapping code imports every UI plugin at once with the foundation module, but that's just a shorthand to import everything at the same time. You can also import each UI component separately, like foundation.tabs or foundation.accordion.\n. To come back to this, do you think a CSS class on <html> is enough, or would having one of the Foundation services expose an isCompatible parameter be more useful? Or both.\n. All of the classes are built using the mixins. Could you give some specific examples of mixins that don't work? I'm also taking a look at your other issue (#482) today, so I'll see what's up there.\n. We're working on improving the grid documentation, and we'll also be releasing a tutorial soon which will describe certain elements of the grid in better detail. If you have any specific feedback or issues with a Sass mixin, let us know in a new issue. :)\n. We've talked about it internally, but it's not of a huge interest to us at the moment. There is a good Angular module, though, that has very similar features to the jQuery one you linked to.\n. Ah, that's a legacy variable and shouldn't be in the codebase anymore. You can control the speed of animations with our built-in classes, or with your own CSS.\nWith our classes:\nhtml\n<div zf-panel animation-in=\"slideInUp\" class=\"[fast slow]\"></div>\nWith your own code:\nhtml\n<div zf-panel animation-in=\"slideInUp\" class=\"panel-thing\"></div>\nscss\n.panel-thing {\n  transition-duration: 500ms;\n}\n. I think I know what you're describing, but there's another use case you might be talking about as well.\nalign-items and align-self align elements on the cross-axis of the flex container. So if you have a horizontal grid, your cross-axis goes up and down, and so the align- properties shift elements up and down. If you had four elements on your horizontal grid, there's no way to make two stick to the left and two stick to the right. The justify-content property controls that behavior, and it can't be set on individual flex children.\nI think that's the behavior you're describing. But you're right that we don't currently have an abstraction for the align-items and align-self properties in the grid.\n. There is, but there are two caveats. Here's a Codepen that illustrates it.\nThe entire container flows as columns, and it's told to wrap, hence flex-flow: column wrap. Note the numbering of the items: it goes vertical, not horizontal. You can't make the HTML order horizontally, because the flex container is flowing vertically.\nThe other caveat is that the container in this example has a defined height. This creates the boundary that forces the child elements to wrap to the next column. Try removing height: 350px; from the .box selector\u2014all of the child elements will just stack vertically, because now they have no reason to wrap.\nSo yes, there is a way to do a Masonry layout in Flexbox, but unfortunately it isn't perfect.\n. We're trying to find a good solution for that right now, as there are plenty of components you could see being identical between the two frameworks, like panels, pagination, tables, and so on.\nWe're working on Foundation 6 right now, where we're trying to simplify a lot of components, so at the very least I think we'll wait until that framework is closer to completion. I wouldn't necessarily want to import any Foundation 5 components, since the codebase for them is a year and a half old.\n. Might be fixed by #478\n. Yep, right now you're supposed to copy the partials as a part of your build process\u2014that's what we do in our template stack, using a glob that only targets HTML files.\nStarting with 1.1, though, we're going to be distributing a compiled templates file (#463), so then you can just add one JavaScript file and get all of the templates. We're hoping to have 1.1 out in a week or so.\n. Is it possible to change a state after it's already been defined? The foundation.dynamicRouting module will create a set of states, and then in your bootstrapping code you'll define the states again. Can they be overwritten?\n. What @escapedcat said will work. The module foundation.dynamicRouting is what handles the creation of states from Front Matter, so if you don't include it, no states will be generated. We're doing exactly that for a client right now at ZURB\u2014using all of the framework's UI components, but writing our own states.\nThere's one caveat right now, which is that view animation doesn't work without the foundation.dynamicRouting module. This will change in version 1.1 of the framework, which we're hoping to have out soon. Then you'll be able to add animation to your states like this:\njs\n$stateProvider\n  .state('home', {\n    url: '/',\n    templateUrl: 'templates/home.html',\n    animation: {\n      enter: 'slideInDown',\n      leave: 'fadeOut'\n    }\n  });\nThe change is already in master if you want to mess around with it.\n. @mikestecker The front matter routing is totally optional, and we took out the line saying it's required from the documentation.\nWe're trying to put out v1.1 today, which will make view animation work without the router plugin, so you can write your own states but still set up transitions between them.\n. @olegpolyakov So, the awkward thing right now is that you still need those modules enabled to make view animation work, even if you're not using the Front Matter stuff. We were able to separate the functionality, but we haven't yet separated the modules themselves, to maintain backwards compatibility. We'll do that in a future version when we can properly deprecate it.\n. The app.js in the docs folder is just for our documentation. It includes a bunch of modules that aren't dependencies of the framework, including hljs, autocomplete, and so on.\nIf you're looking for boilerplate code to bootstrap a Foundation for Apps project, I'd suggest taking a look at the app.js file we use in our template stack.\nEdit: to be more specific, are you interested in mimicking the functionality of our search with autocomplete?\n. This is an issue with how iOS interprets the viewport height (vh) unit. Mobile Safari calculates 100vh without taking into account the height of the tabstrip. On iPhone, it doesn't account for the height of the status bar. So in both cases, the grid frame exceeds the \"real\" height of the viewport.\nWe're working on a solution but we don't have anything concrete yet. #456 addresses the issue by ditching the vh unit entirely, but it also introduces problems related to scrolling.\n. I'm going to close this in favor of #434, which is very similar. We definitely need a solution to this, so we'll find one.\n. This change fixes a pretty bad issue with images and flexbox in Firefox, but you're right that it may be too sweeping of a change, especially since the specificity is higher than one class (.grid-content img).\nWe've seen the issue crop up multiple times now, but we can also just implement the fix manually in those areas.\n. Reverted with this commit: f9dafb5527c08910d97b4b53fa92aef573c2fab9\n. What OS are you using?\n. @calmass It must have been an oversight. Blocks and panels use overflow: auto, which prevents scroll bars from showing up by default, so off-canvas should as well. Off-canvas and panel are more or less the same component, just positioned differently.\n. There's no reason you can't use all of the framework files in another build process. The Foundation CLI is just running gulp, so you could look at the template stack's Gulpfile and just re-fit that for Grunt.\nOur build process:\n- Copies static content like HTML partials, images, etc.\n- Copies HTML view templates and generates routes\n- Compiles Sass\n- Ugilifies and concatenates JavaScript\nThe only thing you can't do without Gulp is use our routing plugin, which allows you to generate ui.router-compatible states from Yaml in each view template. But that's largely optional; if you're writing your own states in the JavaScript you don't need it.\n. At the end of the day the Foundation frameworks are just a collection of CSS/JS components, which means they can pretty much go anywhere. Foundation for Apps gets more restrictive because it requires Angular, but if you're just using our CSS components then you're probably fine. And we definitely want people to abuse the framework, because we need it to be as flexible as possible. :) We don't have a lot of experience here with doing web-to-native ports, but your build process seems totally fine.\n. If you build something cool that you can publish, send it our way! We're starting to develop internal projects and do work for clients with the framework, and we're learning a lot about how a fully-responsive web app is built.\n. Block lists are for menus, so each <li> should hold a single menu item. Putting an inline list inside a single menu item (essentially nesting the menus) turns it into something of a non-standard pattern, so we probably won't add CSS to make this work out of the box. But of course, you can definitely write those overrides yourself for your own project.\n. Angular converts those attributes into more standard HTML, which you can then style. It looks like this:\nhtml\n<div class=\"accordion\">\n  <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n    <div class=\"accordion-title\"></div>\n    <div class=\"accordion-content\"></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\nSo you can select .accordion-title in CSS to change the styles.\nWe probably need to make this more clear in the documentation, though. Developers who haven't used Angular might not know that it renders these directives as HTML templates.\n. Could you explain in more detail what you want to do? Do you want to style individual items in an accordion?\n. Right! Yes, we need to add this, because right now accordion titles only support plain text. If you're just doing, say, an image, you could use a pseudo-element to add an icon.\nscss\n.accordion-title::before {\n  content: url('');\n}\nThis won't work if you need to add dynamic content, though, like an unread count or a label. It's on our list of things to add.\n. Going to close this out, but it's still on our list of things to do. :)\n. We'd like to do more with the touch gestures, so this is definitely an interesting idea. Unfortunately we can't do the 1:1 swipe/reveal that a native app can, but I think most developers who work on web apps understand that. (The libraries do exist but they're fairly complex, and might not work well in a framework where we have to provide generic solutions.)\n. So most touch libraries like Hammer, or the stuff built into Angular or Zepto, are not 1:1, which means you can't hold your finger mid-swipe, and move it around and have the UI element move with it. That requires a lot of math and DOM manipulation that's kind of expensive to calculate.\nFor example, we have the zf-swipe-close directive in Foundation for Apps, which lets you close a modal, panel, etc. with a swipe instead of a click/tap. It's a one-time action, though\u2014you do the swipe, and then the element animates out. You can't swipe slower or faster to change how the animation plays; it just runs in response to the swipe.\nCompare this to iOS or Android, which has a lot of those more fluid gestures built-in. And there are plenty of developers who write their own custom animations for their apps. Tweetbot for iOS is a great example. The web doesn't quite yet have the means to get that kind of fidelity out of motion. There are folks who are trying really hard, but the performance isn't quite there.\n. @soumak77 If you have the feature in a different branch of your fork, you should be able to open a PR with that specific branch.\nIf you don't have them in separate branches, I'd recommend making a new branch that compares against this repo's master branch, and cutting/pasting the feature in there, just so the PR is as clean as possible.\n. We do test on Android 4 devices, phone and tablet. What device, version of Android, and browser are you using?\n. We've got a big improvement coming in v1.1, which will hopefully be out tomorrow. For the directive templates, we're using ng-html2js to pack them all into a single JavaScript file, meaning you won't need to copy those HTML files from the Bower package.\nWe also added a new feature to the Iconic directive which allows you to specify the path your icon files are in.\nAre there any other specific concerns you have related to directory structure?\n. Definitely! Thanks for your feedback. Other than which Angular add-ons we use (namely ui-router and ngAnimate), we want to avoid being prescriptive with regards to how people design or code. That'll always be a goal for all three of the Foundation frameworks.\nAlso, 1.1 got pushed to tomorrow (Monday), but it'll get there.\n. You can still install the package and just ignore everything in the js folder. If you're using a tool like wiredep, you can configure it to ignore all of the JavaScript that our library depends on.\nTo be sure, Foundation for Apps has quite a few dependencies, so it is sort of lame that you have to install seven other things you probably won't use. (Although FastClick and the viewport units buggyfill are both nice.) If you check your dependencies into version control, you can ignore them in .gitignore, and if you don't, simply ignoring the folders is easy enough.\nBower 1.4 might add the ability to ignore dependencies, although there's been no word on it recently. Here's the pull request: bower/bower#1394\n. The icon-* classes should be used on the menu bar itself, not the menu group. However, a selector specificity issue was preventing the class from being applied properly. Fixed!\n. Here are the problems:\n- The menu bar is hiding overflowing content. We can fix that with overflow-y: hidden, and it shouldn't break anything else.\n- The action sheet container isn't centered within the menu bar item. It's anchored to the right instead, like a normal element would be. You can fix that with position: relative; left: 50%;. I'm not sure how to elegantly build that fix into the framework.\nApplying those fixes will make the action sheet visible.\n\nHowever, since it's anchored so far to the right it will be cut off, which is a known issue. We need to add some kind of edge detection to the action sheet. (Or rethink it entirely at some point, because it's a super unwieldy component right now, and probably overlaps in functionality with the popup.)\n. That Firefox <input> line height issue, what a fun one.\n. Could you describe the issue you're having in more detail? Maybe include a screenshot?\n. Also, does the error happen when you change to a new view, or when you perform some other action like a click?\n\"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '$$phase' of null\" (foundation.js line 29)\n. Yeah, let us know if the changes on the master branch fix your issue.\nBut just so we're sure, the series of events that cause the error are:\n- Navigate to a state that has modals inside it\n- Navigate away from that state\n- Navigate back to the state\n- Click the modal open trigger\n- Error\nWe had bugs reported related to modals that are inside of a ui-view, and we were able to implement some fixes. See: #464\n. Do you use Bower to manage dependencies? If you do, switching to the master branch is easy. Just make this change in your bower.json.\njs\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"foundation-apps\": \"master\"\n  }\n}\n. We don't recommend it, because we actively develop on it. We maintain a stable branch as well that's always pointed at the last version we released.\nHowever, we're releasing v1.1 tomorrow, which will include this fix, so you can just upgrade when that comes out. Glad we could help!\n. View animation recently got an overhaul (#386), and it's now way more robust and stable. We were able to pretty thoroughly test it in all of the browsers we support as well. It'll be in version 1.1, which we're trying to get out on Friday.\nThe align-items: stretch thing is interesting. We use that to ensure that columns in a horizontal grid are all equal-height, since height: 100% tends to not cut it. But we could give it another look, also, if it's a performance hit.\n. There's a gulp-compass plugin that you can swap into your project. Run npm install gulp-compass --save-dev to get it in your project, and then follow the instructions on the readme to get it set up. You'll be replacing the call to $.rubySass in the Gulpfile to $.compass, under the sass task.\nYour project will also need a config.rb file, like a normal Compass project would. The config file needs to reference the Foundation for Apps Sass as an import path:\nruby\nadd_import_path \"bower_components/foundation-apps/scss\"\n. @soumak77 The classes follow ngAnimate's format; what would we need to change to make them work? I know they work with ng-repeat.\n. @soumak77 Okay, so the reason is that there are five types of Angular transition classes: enter, leave, move, add, and remove. Our motion classes support the first two: enter and leave. We should be able to add support for the rest just by chaining those other classes to the existing selectors. By adding at least add/remove, we get support for ng-show and ng-hide.\n. @soumak77 It's possible, I'll see how quickly we can put together a test case. It's a relatively simple Sass change, though.\n. @soumak77 And done!\n. Definitely, we'll see about getting it in soon.\n. Merged with 40abb575efde27fcff8c59b8ee18fff417a9919c\nThanks! :)\n. Nice, thanks!\n. Yep, #483 fixes this I believe. We're trying to put out a 1.1 tomorrow, so stay tuned!\n. You think there's any way to make improvements that are backwards-compatible, or would we need to wait for a major release to work on this?\nIt's also likely that v2 of this framework will be written in Angular 2, so then all of this is out the window anyway ;)\n. Sounds solid. We have no timeline for a v2 of Foundation for Apps, but there's also no real timeline for Angular 2's release. We're keeping a close eye on it, though.\nWith that in mind, I'm going to close this out. There are some big things that we have to wait until a major version to change. But we're always keeping track of this stuff, so we love the feedback. Keep it coming! :)\n. Merged with this commit: ab6303639d8b2bc26dd77d758d91746111c3996b\n. Closing in favor of #549.\n. Looks like some weird network issue. Can you try running everything manually? cd into the folder for the project that was created and run:\nbash\nnpm install\nbower install\ngulp\n. Did you get any errors when you ran npm install?\n. Hmm, well you got an error the first time, so let's try again.\nbash\nrm -rf node_modules\nnpm cache clean\nnpm install\nSee if you get the same errors with node-sass. Also, what version of Node are you running?\nIf this doesn't work, you'll likely need to ask the folks at node-sass for some help.\n. Swapping for Ruby Sass is fairly easy. Install the gulp-ruby-sass library and then replace the code in the sass task of your Gulpfile with this code:\njs\nreturn gulp.src('client/assets/scss/app.scss')\n  .pipe($.rubySass({\n    loadPath: paths.sass,\n    style: 'nested'\n  })).on('error', function (e) {\n    console.log(e);\n  })\n  .pipe($.autoprefixer({\n    browsers: ['last 2 versions', 'ie 10']\n  }))\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/assets/css/'));\n. Right! Forgot they have a new 1.0 alpha branch. One more thing, if you want to lock in the version of Sass you're using with a Gemfile, you can add one to the project root, run bundle install, and then add the setting bundleExec: true to the $.rubySass config object.\n. @Joe-5mith Were you able to get gulp-ruby-sass working properly?\n. Can you try using the directive as an attribute instead of an element?\n. Well, unfortunately it was an oversight, but it's been fixed now. No CSS output in the framework should be hardcoded, except the <meta> styles we use to pass the media queries to the JavaScript.\n. We try to put out patches every few weeks, depending on how many crazy bug fixes we need to get out the door. So at best I can say \"a week or two\", but we don't have a date right now.\n. The move process seems to be very similar to enter, except that the class is different. Is there any real difference, or can we just chain .ng-move to .ng-enter and .ng-show?\n. Ah I see, so we need to prevent collision between enter/show and move. Ideally we find a way to do that without outputting a ton of extra CSS. Or we relegate it to a mixin-only feature, to keep our file size down.\nI also need to eventually take a look at how we store all these animation classes, if there has to be three sets of them. It would be better if the Sass variables looked like this:\nscss\n$motion-classes-enter: 'ng-enter', 'ng-show', 'ng-move';\n$motion-classes-leave: 'ng-leave', 'ng-hide';\nThere are some nice selector manipulation functions in Sass 3.4 that would probably help, but they aren't in libsass yet (and probably won't be for a while), so I might write something that recreates what I need.\n. I opened a pull request that implements ng-move here: #560 \nThe Sass variable situation is becoming messy, but we'll roll with it for now. You can test this branch on an existing project with bower install foundation-apps#ng-move-motion\n. Yep, that should be e.target instead of e.srcElement.\n. The team looked over this today, good stuff!\nWe like the zf-if concept as a different way to do visibility, but not necessarily as a replacement for Interchange. The benefit of Interchange is that visibility within a set of elements is mutually-exclusive\u2014only one element within an Interchange element can be displayed. In some of your examples, each element in a set needs to use an only version of a media query, otherwise every element would appear at once on a large screen.\nOur main piece of feedback for the zf-if concept is that you could simplify the directive by having just one, called zf-if, and then read the name of the media query off of the value of the directive, like so:\nhtml\n<div zf-if=\"medium\"></div>\n<div zf-if=\"small only\"></div>\nThis solves another issue which this feature would need to address, which is that the breakpoint names are hard-coded. Right now small, medium, and large are built-in, but the framework also has xlarge and xxlarge, and the user can change the names of the media queries, or add new ones. You can access them through the foundation.mediaqueries module. With this in mind, a more generic zf-if directive makes sense, because then you're just parsing a string and checking it against the global media query list.\nAs for element queries, we're not sure we're ready to implement them quite yet. Also, we don't want to add another external library to the framework right now. Foundation for Apps already has seven dependencies, so we'd like to hold off on adding any new ones until we're ready for a v2 of the framework.\n. Our next release will be a patch, and then probably a minor release after that (1.2). Sorry for making you wait so long! :) The work you're doing is fantastic.\n. Could you give an example of how you'd use this new feature?\n. @soumak77 So what we're trying to solve is the issue of incremental builds, where you may not be passing every file through the router. Your use case seems somewhat specific, but from a Gulp perspective, being able to support partial builds (like using gulp-cached to only pass modified files through a stream) would be useful.\nOne issue I see with your current approach is that the more you append, the more foundationRoutes.concat calls you get in your code, and the plugin right now probably can't differentiate between a route being added versus changed, so if you ran it too many times the file would become larger than necessary. To be sure, though, actually reaching into the existing file and modifying the JS object in there would be tricky, as you wouldn't know the exact formatting (uglified or not? etc.)\nI wonder if you can store the routes in memory and just reference that when re-generating the routes file. There are some Node modules that would let you store the data after the process exists.\nI like the idea of using module configuration, since that will pull that foundationRoutes variable out of the global scope. It's worth noting that we'd like to move the routing plugin into its own npm module in a future version of the framework, because we realized having a node module in a Bower package is a little weird. I'll take the blame for initially suggesting that ;)\nTo do it right, we would probably introduce the module in 1.2, but keep the old one in place until 1.3, when we formally deprecate it by removing the bin folder from the repo. Your idea requires changing the order in which files are loaded in the HTML (libraries, then routes, then boostrap), so a new version of the plugin could introduce these breaking changes.\nIf you're interested in working on those bigger changes to the plugin, I can set up the new repo with some test files set up and you can hack away at it.\n. @soumak77 You're the best! Thanks so much for your interest in contributing to the framework. Once again, we don't have a timeline for 1.2, so don't fret about getting it done right now.\nHere's the standalone module. To recap, here are the goals of a new version:\n- Support incremental builds: the parser needs to be able to print a routes object without passing every file through every time.\n- Use module configuration instead of a global variable to print routes.\n- Keep it backwards-compatible! For version 1.2, the foundation.dynamicRouting module should work with the old and new router. For version 1.3 we can drop support for the old router.\n. @soumak77 Hey, no problem! We're going to try and square away some of the bigger Apps issues and pull requests this week.\n. @soumak77 Since it's a feature, we can save it for 1.2. We don't have a timeline for a 1.2 right now, but you'll have plenty of time to work on it. We weren't planning on implementing this feature specifically, so you can definitely own it.\nIf you give me one more day to review this with the team, I'll get you some feedback. :)\n. The CLI will work with your current projects, so you can update it no problem.\nAs you correctly guessed, most of the CLI's commands are wrappers for Bower and npm functions. So foundation-apps update is the same as bower update, and foundation-apps watch is running npm start, which runs a local copy of Gulp. (This means you don't need Gulp installed globally for it to work.)\nThis abstraction will make more sense when we move Foundation 6 and Ink 2 onto this CLI, and then all three frameworks will use the same tool. The command name will also change to just foundation.\nGlad you're loving it! We feel really good about 1.1, it's way more stable than 1.0. :)\n. Could you cd into the folder created and run bower install manually? That's the step of the install process that it's failing on.\n. Hmm, could have been a temporary network hiccup or an issue with proxies, depending on the kind of network you're on. If it happens again let us know. :)\n. This will fix components not loading properly in HTML5 mode, but it would affect apps that still use hash bangs, but also run in a subdirectory. In hash bang mode, the relative component paths are always relative to the index.html file of the app, no matter what route you're on. If this was changed to an absolute path, it would look be looking in the wrong place.\nEdit: Actually, might need to look into that again. I was trying to figure it out a few weeks ago, what the root directory is when a directive template is being loaded.\nWe've started distributing a pre-compiled templates file, and our project template now pre-compiles templates instead of loading all those HTML files separately. Would that method get around this issue?\n. Yep, the Travis file has been updated so that won't happen.\n. If you're fine with it not being a single-page app, then you should be able to just drop in the CSS, and the JavaScript for Angular and Foundation and it'll work. We distribute the files on npm and Bower, so you can get the compiled CSS and JS from there.\nIf you want it to be an actual single-page app, though, that's a whole new can of worms. Normally Rails handles your URL routing, and serves up all the HTML. With Angular, however, your app has to have one entry point (an index.html file), and Angular handles all of the routing and rendering of HTML.\nWe recently redesigned the ZURB Library, which is a Rails application that uses Angular on the front-end. The server redirects all requests to index.html, and Angular handles the route from there. Also, Rails doesn't serve up any HTML; the backend is just an API that sends data to the client as JSON, and Angular uses it to write the HTML for each page.\n. @soumak77 Ah yeah. So move only happens on ng-repeat, which also uses enter and leave. So is the main concern getting move to work with those two specifically? If that's the case, then can move be the only animation event (of the five there are) that gets its own unique classes?\n. @soumak77 Do you think the move animations are needed for every type of transition? There's slide, fade, hinge, zoom, and spin.\n. @soumak77 Yeah, CSS output is a concern, but I think the move classes specifically will go behind a Sass variable. I was also wondering if the effects were practical for this specific type of transition. But I'll just add all of them! No problem.\n. Going to close this and open a new PR later when I've implemented it properly.\n. Do you want the panel to be open as long as the vehicles state is active? Maybe you could drop the zf-open and use ui-router's state events to open/close the panel. The ui-router wiki goes into more detail, but here's a (possible) code example:\njs\n$stateProvider.state(\"items.add\", {\n  url: \"/add\",\n  onEnter: ['$stateParams', '$state', 'foundationApi', function($stateParams, $state, FoundationApi) {\n    foundationApi.publish('#detail-panel', 'show');\n  }],\n  onExit: ['$stateParams', '$state', 'foundationApi', function($stateParams, $state, FoundationApi) {\n    foundationApi.publish('#detail-panel', 'hide');\n  }]\n});\n. The grid classes only apply to a panel when it's turned back into a block. Although maybe folks are expecting the classes to work with both components?\nWe could probably use more built-in classes for panel sizing. In the mean time, you can use the panel-layout() mixin to create a panel with a custom orientation and size.\nscss\n.custom-panel {\n  // The second parameter can be a percentage or absolute width\n  @include panel-layout(left, 100%);\n}\n. Do you think a handful of pixel-based sizing classes are enough, or are folks expecting a range of percentage-based classes on par with the grid? It could end up being a lot of extra code if we have twelve sizing classes, and actually twice that because you need different ones for horizontal and vertical panels.\n. I'm amazed how complicated the math for this turned out to be.\n. You can just drop an image into the <a> and it will work just fine. There is an issue right now where the image still has a bottom margin, because it's expecting text to be below it. You can fix it for now with this selector:\ncss\n.menu-bar > li > a > img:first-child:last-child {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n. There shouldn't be a scroll bar if a grid element is shrunk, because \"shrink\" means \"this element should only take up the space it needs\". So using overflow: hidden (or overflow: visible to make using dropdown menus easier) as a default would make sense.\n. This is really interesting, do you think you could add a section to the Iconic documentation page that explains this, with a live demo and code example?\n. Thanks!\n. One last question, the last section, \"Delay Loaded Icon\" shows two code examples, one where the icon doesn't render and one where it does. Is it possible to just have the second example, since it's the one that implements the fix you describe? Our documentation should skew towards having one example to show how to do something. If you'd never use the first example, then we can probably drop it.\n. Sounds good, I'll update it.\n. This should be fine, although one thing we want to avoid in the future is hard-coding class names. All of the Foundation frameworks are written in Sass mixins, which means you can rip out our entire class structure and replace it with your own if you want. With that in mind, JS plugins should avoid adding or referencing built-in classes, because we can't guarantee that the user is using them.\nTo be sure, though, we do this a lot in Foundation for Apps right now. It's also trickier with Angular, because our components are these templates that you just drop in. In Foundation for Sites it's easier, because the user just drops a bunch of data attributes onto existing markup.\nThe framework is very new, though, and for specific components like this not many people are probably using the mixins yet. They're most commonly-used for the grid, and that's also arguably the place they're most valuable.\nSo if we merge in #561, will this work as-is, or will you need to make another change?\n. @soumak77 If we pull in #561, could you merge/rebase this PR and get the proper fix in to we can reconcile the two?\n. Alright, merged in #561.\n. Nice, so it's solid, then?\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. There weren't any big changes to the grid from 1.0.3 to 1.1 (just two commits from what I can tell), but this may have been introduced in 1.0.3.\nI think the fix is changing the default sizing behavior of grid elements.\nscss\n.grid-block,\n.grid-content {\n  // Old\n  flex: 1 1 auto;\n  // New\n  flex: 1 1 0;\n}\nSetting the preferred size to 0 instead of auto ensures that the blocks actually take up even amounts of space and don't vary in their widths. We initially thought that auto did the same thing, but sometimes column widths still find ways to vary. It seems like setting it to 0 is the right thing.\nWe'll need to test it in every browser, of course, since they're all implementing Flexbox a little differently, and test the change in any existing codebases to make sure it's not a breaking change. I don't think it is, though, especially since it's the behavior we wanted all along.\n. @etcook Awesome! Originally grid elements just used flex: 1 1, but then we added auto to the end because different browsers used different defaults for the last property (flex-basis). But it sounds like setting it to 0 across the board will get us the result we want. We'll do some testing on it.\n. Hm, if you have time can you drum up a more isolated test case?\nOmitting the last value of flex, which is flex-basis, is problematic because IE10/11 have a different default value, so you have to be explicit with it. IE10/11 also miscalculates the width/height of any element with a flex-basis other than auto, so that's fun. Learn more here.\n. The plugin is called allmighty-autocomplete if you want to use it. It's not developed by us; we just use it in our documentation.\n. We don't plan to include it with the framework by default, but it's pretty easy to integrate into an existing project. Run bower install allmighty-autocomplete --save, then add the path to the array of JavaScript paths in your Gulpfile. The library also includes a CSS file with some default styles you can use.\n. Generally grid blocks don't scroll, only content blocks. Looking at your markup, I would expect the first element (with the <h2> and <h4>) to be fixed at the left, the last element (with Go code!) to be fixed at the bottom right, and the middle element to be fixed at the top right, and scrollable. What's your intended behavior?\nEdit: Unless the entire modal is a vertical grid, in which case I would expect all three elements to stack vertically. The top and bottom ones don't move, and the middle one scrolls. This is the intended behavior of the grid.\n. I wouldn't expect the .grid-block.vertical element to scroll, just the .grid-content areas. I think the HTML of this modal can be refactored.\nAssuming you want to anchor elements at the top and bottom, and keep the middle open to show content, you can do this:\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-block vertical\">\n  <div class=\"grid-content shrink text-center\">\n    <h2>Modal Header</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"grid-content\">\n    <div ng-repeat=\"x in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]\">\n      <p>Content {{ x }}</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"grid-content shrink text-center\">\n    <a class=\"button primary\">Next</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\nThe top and bottom have .shrink, so the middle section is expanded. The elements added with ng-repeat fill in the middle space.\n. There needs to be a distinction between modals that use the grid and ones that don't. A plain modal has padding and is display: block, while a grid modal has no padding and is display: flex. If we consider a plain modal to be the default (which is sensible, since it's the simpler form of a modal), then we need a class, maybe .grid, for modals to shift them into grid mode.\nWhatever solution we use here should be applied to panels and off-canvas as well, which are two other components that have these two modes.\n. We're working on improvements to the grid documentation, namely using... y'know, actual examples, so look forward to that.\nWe've had some trouble explaining the difference between the three grid elements\u2014the frame, block, and content block. Recently though, we've found an easier way to frame it. (But you're right, .grid-content is always the lowest-level.)\nHere's a no-frills grid. It only uses two of the elements.\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-frame\">\n  <div class=\"small-3 grid-content\"></div>\n  <div class=\"small-3 grid-content\"></div>\n  <div class=\"small-6 grid-content\"></div>\n</div>\nHere's that same grid if we nested a new grid inside the first element. It adds a new, third element for nesting purposes.\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-frame\">\n  <div class=\"small-3 grid-block\">\n    <div class=\"grid-content\"></div>\n    <div class=\"grid-content\"></div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"small-3 grid-content\"></div>\n  <div class=\"small-6 grid-content\"></div>\n</div>\nThe main difference from a typical float grid is that you can add sizing, source ordering, etc. classes to block and content.\n. This is something we haven't fully addressed yet, so now's a good time to. Some of the components have default classes and animations applied. Panels will have this issue also.\nMaybe we can switch up the logic so that if you omit the position attribute, it doesn't add anything? In our examples we always include it, even though it does have a default value of left.\n. Opened #589 since this is relevant to multiple components.\n. It's a little awkward right now, but you do need both the foundation.dynamicRouting and foundation.dynamicRouting.animations modules to make it work, even if you're not using our routing plugin.\nWhen we released 1.0, view animations only worked with the routing plugin. We fixed this in 1.1, but to maintain backwards compatibility, we didn't want to change the names of the modules. Unless there's a way for us to create a module alias, so we can change the name, we'll have to keep the naming convention as-is for the time being.\n. Seems like that fix will work fine for now. There's been talk about making the routing plugin's process a little more robust than dropping an array into the window object, so look forward to that!\n. The ghosting issue is a WebKit bug, but we have a workaround in the CSS. However, the setup for the animation isn't working properly. The first parent of the views should temporarily get a class called .position-absolute, but here it's not. We'll look into it.\n. Could you try reworking your HTML so that the ui-view element is wrapped by a grid-block? So it would look something like this:\nslim\n.grid-frame.vertical\n  .grid-content.shrink\n  .grid-block\n    .grid-content ui-view\n      .grid-container\n. Try adding the class .ui-animation to the view and see if that fixes it. That won't be necessary in the next version of the framework (e64d2eee89ac7f4b7e9b5cecea17b68d2b6c460c).\n. This happens because both views are temporarily position: absolute. But the wrapper element around the ui-view container is what should prevent the two views from shifting around. If the wrapper and the view are the same size, you shouldn't be able to tell.\n. Nice! We know it's a little confusing ;) In a future version of the framework we'll just build in the container class, like .ui-view-container or something like that. We're also currently writing a tutorial on Foundation for Apps that will cover view animation.\n@huphtur, let me know if these fixes work. There's two parts to setting up view animation:\n1. Give the ui-view a class of .ui-animation.\n2. Wrap the view in a parent container that has the same size. Usually this is just another .grid-block.\n. The markup @DeanSolecki wrote is the right way to do it. If anyone has any more problems let me know!\n. Can you try running npm start and see if that works?\n. npm start is what the CLI runs in the background, so until we get this fixed you can use that command and it'll work just fine.\nWhat versions of Node and npm are you running? Use node -v and npm -v to find out. Edit: never mind, you totally already said :)\n. @quook What version of Node are you on? Maybe it's an issue with 0.12; most of us here are still running 0.10.\n. Alright, I was able to recreate it in Node 0.12.2, so it's an issue with Node 0.12.x.\n. Just published version 1.1 of the CLI which addresses this issue. Run npm update -g foundation-cli to get it.\n. I don't know that you can definitively prove that Angular is on its way out just yet ;) Either way, a v2 of this framework is still a way off, so we'll cross that bridge when we get there. But to be sure, the opportunity cost of sticking with Angular vs. switching to another framework are about the same, because either way we have to learn something new.\n. @zimt28 Are there any examples in the wild of people doing this? Writing pure classes and then hooking them into multiple libraries?\n. Sass can't import plain CSS files using @import, only other Sass files. Thankfully, it's pretty easy in Gulp to just insert those extra CSS files.\nTo add external CSS to your main CSS file (which was compiled from Sass), there's two steps to take.\nFirst, add the plain CSS files to gulp.src. The files will be combined in the order you list them.\njs\nreturn gulp.src(['path/to/file.css', 'path/to/sass.scss'])\n  .pipe(/* ... */)\nNext, add a concatenation step to the stream. gulp-sass will ignore your plain CSS, only processing the Sass files. But now we have two CSS files, and we need to combine them into one. gulp-concat will do this for us, and the template project includes it.\nYou can insert concat before or after autoprefixer, just make sure you do it before gulp.dest().\njs\n// Compiles Sass\ngulp.task('sass', function () {\n  gulp.src(['path/to/other/file.css', 'client/assets/scss/app.scss'])\n    .pipe($.sass({\n      includePaths: paths.sass,\n      outputStyle: (isProduction ? 'compressed' : 'nested'),\n      errLogToConsole: true\n    }))\n    .pipe($.autoprefixer({\n      browsers: ['last 2 versions', 'ie 10']\n    }))\n    .pipe($.concat('app.css'))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/assets/css/'))\n  ;\n});\nIn the future we'll see about adding more documentation on how the template stack actually works. The Gulp team itself doesn't publish any best practices for how to structure a Gulpfile, but if you want to see how \"the big kids\" do it, I'd recommend you check out Google's Web Starter Kit and the HTML5 Boilerplate.\nHope this helps!\n. Like @AntJanus said, all of the components are generally framework-agnostic. Half of them also work without any JavaScript, most critically the Flexbox grid. You can install the Bower or npm package and just drop in the Sass files (or compiled CSS).\nThe reason we didn't write a wrapper around plain JS plugins is because then we lose some of the benefits of the framework itself. That being said, hopefully our components can be flexible enough to be dropped into any JS framework. For example, Motion UI will eventually be a standalone library, and it'll be way more configurable. Then you could use it with, say, Ember's Liquid Fire, in addition to ngAnimate.\nWe don't have a timeline for a v2 of a framework, but when that time rolls around we'll probably be reassessing how the framework is built, since Angular 2 is a thing.\n. Which control on the page should open the modal? And could you post the code for the modal and the element with zf-open that triggers the modal?\n. Try using .grid-content instead of .grid-block for the inner elements. Blocks are just for layout, while content blocks are for actual content. The main difference is that one is display: flex and the other is display: block. The flexbox behavior is interfering with the display of the images.\n. Ah yeah, I just remembered that we've run into this, so I think you're right. For a while we had a fix in place that just applied width: 100% to all images within a grid, but it was reverted.\n. @tatemz That second issue was fixed a few weeks ago, it just hasn't landed in a stable version yet. (caaf800f21cf4750b534709d1e0371a9a2152105)\nAs for the main issue, I wonder if applying min-width: 1px to flex children across the board would work.\n. A few remarks about your markup:\n- You don't need the panel-bottom class on the panel; the position attribute adds it for you.\n- The zf-panel attribute doesn't need a value. Since you have an ID on there, you're good.\nThe layout for panels is a little tricky; the panel should never be inside any content blocks (.grid-content), just adjacent to them in the HTML. So a super basic layout would look like this:\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-block\">\n  <div zf-panel></div>\n  <div class=\"grid-content\">\n    <p>Content!</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\nIn this example, there's one main content area that spans the entire width, along with the panel, and both of them share a container. This ensures that the panel appears on top of the main content, and avoids issues with scrolling containers and position: absolute elements.\nThat might be your issue. If not, could you post a larger code example for us to take a look at? Thanks!\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. So it looks like you're trying to run unit tests with PhantomJS?\nHere's the key error: TypeError: 'null' is not an object (evaluating 'mediaQueries[key].replace')\nMedia query settings are stored in a Sass variable, which we pass to the JS by serializing it and attaching it to a specific <meta> tag. The JavaScript reads the style attribute of this special meta tag, and turns it into an object of breakpoints.\nWe've seen this before, and the reason it's happening is because the PhantomJS instance isn't referencing any compiled CSS. We probably need a workaround for this, but Interchange specifically needs this breakpoints. Maybe we can get around it by just loading in a default set if it can't find any.\n. I think this is something we can fix, by dropping in a pre-set list of media queries if pulling from the <meta> tag doesn't work. We had this issue with the routing plugin as well, and we were able to fix that.\n. Do you get any JavaScript errors?\n. We don't support Browserify, or any other module loaders right now, but it's something we'll look into eventually. In the mean time, the correct name of the Angular module is just foundation, not foundation-apps.\nThe foundation module gets you every UI component at once, but you can also only import individual elements, like foundation.panel or foundation.accordion. The Angular modules page in our documentation breaks down every module and what they all do. You can also check out the bootstrapping code for our template project to see what we're loading specifically.\n. What problem does this fix?\n. I see, thanks for clarifying :)\n. It might be possible to make the body of the switch a pseudo-element, and then the text just sits after it. The thing is that the switch itself needs to be clickable, and not require any JavaScript, which is why it's always been structured how it is.\nHowever, people have also asked that we support text inside the switch, although it might be possible to support both. Inner text isn't a label, anyway, it's a state.\n. Because the framework is geared towards responsive web apps, in general we assume that any pane of content could need to scroll, as its dimensions will change wildly between mobile and desktop. But you're right that the overflow issue has come up multiple times.\nWe have a .noscroll class for grid elements, but right now it actually applies overflow: hidden, which is also problematic. So I just added a change to make it overflow: visible instead.\nWe've had a number of issues with overflows and scrolling, so we're definitely looking at ways to better handle that stuff. For example, most JavaScript plugins assume the window is always the thing scrolling, not some nested scrolling panel, and F4A projects are made entirely out of those. (Tether has been problematic in this regard.)\n. Definitely, it's actually in the docs-specific bootstrapping code, so it'll be moved before it's merged.\n. Closing in favor of bc01826c7bd1eb8e4ed6fb3bf293fcb0aebcaf9f which solves the same issue without extra CSS.\n. Thanks for the GIF, and also revealing to me that Chrome DevTools can slow down animations. That's awesome!\nBefore we merge this, we'll make sure it works in other browsers.\n. Actually, looking closer, I don't think this is the right fix. The issue is specificity:\n``` scss\n// Defined by switches\n.switch > label {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n// Defined by forms\ninput[type=\"checkbox\"] + label {\n  // This is overriding the margin: 0; above\n  margin-left: 0.5rem;\n}\n```\nMatching the specificity within the switch class fixes the issue. This commit implements the fix: 951eeadd343e0b7fdf9482987d9d9f9e7349b318\n. I'm fine with one less deploy step. Thanks for spreading the word. :)\n. Browser compatibility is the best. Thanks!\n. We're about ready for a patch release, just need to close down a few of the more pressing issues. View animation specifically is something we want a little more solid.\n. Definitely, we'll see about getting that in shortly.\n. Add the --production flag to the command you're running. This enables compression for the CSS and JavaScript.\nThe plugin gulp-if controls the process of compression. If it sees the --production flag, the JavaScript runs through the uglify transform. Otherwise, it skips over it.\n. You'd need to use an iframe inside of a modal, but I don't know that Facebook allows their share screens to be loaded in iframes\u2014they have to be in their own window. (See more here.)\nThere are a few ways to trigger this screen, which Facebook details in their developer documentation.\n. It's a known issue, @jeanieshark and I spent a while looking at it but couldn't figure it out. I'll double-check on how far we got in diagnosing the problem.\n. Fixed via a685cccf2a13dff77cdd728f41f9dbbbefbdf643. It'll be in the next patch release.\n. The Git clone may have failed. Can you try running the command manually?\ngit clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template.git mwepd2\n. Oh! You're on an old version of the CLI\u2014it doesn't use Ruby at all now. Run npm update -g foundation-cli. Edit: Maybe. We should have scrubbed any Ruby-related instructions from our docs and readmes, but if we missed something, let us know.\n. @soulstyle Do you see a project folder being created after running foundation-apps new? The folder should still be there even if the install fails.\n. If you want open elements to close when a toggle is fired, use zf-hard-toggle. It toggles the element with the ID you specify, and also closes other open elements. Does that sound like what you need?\n. What version of Node and npm are you running?\nnode -v\nnpm -v\nAs for the project you tried to make, the files are all there. Can you try running npm install manually from within the project's folder?\n. The commands are identical. foundation-apps watch is just running npm start. But for the sake of consistency we'll make sure that it lists the same command.\nJust so we can close this out, could you try running the foundation-apps new command again? You should get a list npm errors above the text at the end where it says \"There were some problems during the installation.\"\n. Ah okay, it's a permissions issue with your computer. Here's an npm issue comment that details a fix. (Specifically it's the sudo chown commands halfway down the comment.)\n. The $order parameter in the mixin has an extra comma. Remove that last comma and you'll be good.\nIt looks like our documentation has a few formatting issues like these, so we'll make sure they get fixed.\n. Can you describe in more detail the problem this creates? What do you mean that the Angular application is loading multiple times?\nAlso, are you using our Gulp routing plugin or writing your own routes?\n. The Iconic file hasn't changed since version 1.0; is this a problem you encountered starting with a specific version?\n. Since it's an issue with Acorn, we'll close this out.\n. We patched the shrink behavior of grid elements to be overflow: visible, meaning they'll never have a scroll bar (see here: b44df9ee31e899a74a2dd2ff2d61e4b3fb096b58). The fix is in master, but hasn't landed in a stable release yet. We should have a patch version out soon.\nIn the mean time, you can patch this behavior yourself by adding overflow: visible to grid elements you know are shrinking.\nContent blocks are always overflow: auto, meaning they get a scrollbar if the content is taller than the container. If your blocks are really short (which it looks like they might be, based on the screenshot), there's a good chance they get a scroll bar. You can disable scrolling by adding the .noscroll class to the element.\n. Thanks! :)\n. This might be fixed on the master branch, where we've prevented the minimal UI from displaying, which gets around the weird height calculations Mobile Safari does. See #603, and the commit that replaced it, bc01826c7bd1eb8e4ed6fb3bf293fcb0aebcaf9f.\n. We tested this in multiple browsers to be sure, and I don't think anything we can do will fix it. Foundation for Apps projects are built with a series of scrolling boxes\u2014the window itself never scrolls.\nIt seems that when you try to scroll a box in a direction it can't scroll, that scroll event goes straight to the window, instead of the next scrollable parent. If you're on a Mac, you can see the rubber-banding effect when you scroll a code example in the docs up and down. It's trying to scroll the window, instead of the scrolling box its inside.\nSo we determined this to be a browser issue, and there isn't really anything we can do about it.\n. Right, inner containers with a vertical scroll will continue scrolling the next parent up when they reach the bottom. The same doesn't apply to horizontal scrolling containers.\nAre you saying ui-grid fixes the horizontal scrolling issue?\n. @sgraham3311 Hm, well let me know if you come across a solution that gets around this, because it seems like a browser or operating system issue.\n. Two weeks is a good estimate. A few of us on the team are out of the office next week (vacation, off-site training), but the week after we can put out a patch.\nThanks for continuing to use the framework! The work you've contributed so far is fantastic :)\n. What version of Android are you using, and what web browser?\n. Hmm, interesting. Have you noticed any performance differences between the two, or any other gotchas that would be worth knowing about?\nEither way we probably won't swap out a dependency until a v2 of the framework.\n. @soumak77, you're the best! You seem to have adequately answered this question, but @vincentmorneau, if you need any more clarification, let us know.\n. There is documentation on our modules here, but we could be doing a better job. There were talks to write more wrapper methods to make the API a bit less terse (see #390), but there's nobody working on it right now.\n. As for the event firing, a modal should always fire an event when it closes, no matter how the close happened. That makes sense.\n. That's for popups, not modals. But your issue is fixed in master?\n. Gotcha. Looks like this is fixed, then.\n. How does this interact with #640? Can we merge both?\n. Nice, thanks for implementing it!\n. Hm, try running bower update manually and see what happens. You might be asked to manually select a version of Angular to install\u2014just pick the latest one along the 1.3.x line and you should be fine.\n. Yep, you need to manually type in 1.1. Since minor versions can add new features or introduce deprecations, package managers like to safeguard you from making big version leaps automatically.\nBut if you're cool with that, you can edit your bower.json to look like this:\n\"foundation-apps\": \"~1.1\"\nBy taking out the last number, Bower will automatically update the package to 1.1, 1.2, and beyond.\nLet us know if you're able to upgrade properly. Unfortunately we introduced a bunch of big structural changes to our code in 1.0.2, which doesn't change how you use the framework, but does affect how your Gulpfile needs to work. The release notes for 1.0.2 cover the upgrade process.\n. Yep, that's a bug, see zurb/foundation-cli#11. The CLI is overdue for a new patch, so when that gets out it'll have this fix.\nGlad the upgrade process worked, though! We don't plan on requiring anything substantial like that again for the v1.x line.\n. We prefer using single quotes for all Sass/CSS values. What's the error you're getting?\n. Could you give us any more info on your Webpack setup, or a full console log? I'm trying to figure out if this is an issue specific to sass-loader. If we change these quotes, there's always the chance that a different processor could break, so I'd like to figure out if it's a problem on our end or not.\n. Ah yeah, the 1.0.2 upgrade guide was written before we introduced those two libraries to the template.\nAlso, since you've upgraded, you can remove front-matter and through2 from your dependencies. Those are wrapped up in the front-router package.\n. It is gulp-if, see if that's missing.\n. Yeah, maybe try cleaning out your folder and starting again. The error here is related to through2 being used by vinyl-fs, which is being used by gulp. Dependencies get complicated. But it doesn't appear to be related to the instance of through2 that was being used at the top level.\nTo start over, try:\nbash\nrm -rf node_modules\nnpm cache clean\nnpm install\nAlso, when you run npm uninstall, you need to add --save or --save-dev to make the change stick in your package.json file.\n. Nice! If you have any suggestions for Front Router, let us know.\n. Can you post a stack trace for that error, so we can see where in the code it's being generated?\n. Just published version 1.1.2 of the CLI which fixes this. See zurb/foundation-apps#11\n. We don't have any documentation for it, but we aren't doing anything weird with Angular, so there's no reason it wouldn't work.\nWe don't plan on writing anything in the near future. We're mainly focused on pure web apps, not web-to-native ports.\n. Which template are you using? Is it one from our resources page or the official starter template?\n. Okay, are you running the downloadable templates or the one that's created when you run foundation-apps new app?\nAfter that, what command do you run and what's the error you get?\n. What's the error?\n. The setup for those templates is admittedly fairly messy\u2014we don't even have a good process for updating their dependencies. I can't say this will be fixed soon unfortunately, but we know it's something we need to do.\nI can ask today if we can carve out some time to change those ZIP files.\n. I believe wiredep is the more popular solution these days, but it's also in a state of flux because the Bower community is in the middle of an ongoing discussion on how the main field in bower.json works, so I'm not sure how reliable it is right now.\n. Updated all of the devDependencies in the template, and everything looks solid. Here's the commit.\n. It's in there right now, but not in a stable release. We'll see about getting a patch release out in the next week.\n. Do you mean flagging components that require JavaScript?\n. Are you seeing this in your own project, or just our template?\n. Alright, then it's probably an issue with how the templates are configured rather than the framework. We'll look into it.\n. If the plugin attaches the smooth scrolling behavior to the window, nothing will happen, because Foundation apps don't scroll on the window\u2014they scroll on inner <div> elements.\nPresumably you'd need to configure the plugin to attach to grid elements. You can target .grid-content specifically, because these are the scrolling elements.\n. Is this an accidental PR by chance? The package name has been changed to foundation-apps-custom, so this can't be pulled in as-is.\nAs for Angular 1.4, we haven't tested the framework with it yet, so we're staying on 1.3 for now.\n. Did you get any errors when running npm install -g foundation-cli?\n. Alright, in this case I think the Git clone failed. Does the git command work properly in your environment?\n. I see. The CLI is failing on process.chdir(), which is when it changes directory to the folder that git clone just created. Do you see that folder after running foundation-apps new?\n. Ah, so the issue is Node not being able to shell out to the git command. In that case I assume the CLI would report an error relating to exec('git clone'), but in this case it's not.\n. We haven't tested the framework on 1.4 yet, so stick with 1.3.x if you can. Although there's a decent chance it'll work with 1.4 right away.\n. @soumak77 If you haven't seen any issues, we could introduce a range of 1.3.x to 1.4.x for the Angular dependency.\n. @kuatsure Yes! I want to sweep the recent pull requests soon.\n. @sjenkinsdc Check to see if you have anything else on the port that's running. You can also change the port number on line 148 of gulpfile.js:\njs\ngulp.task('server', ['build'], function() {\n  gulp.src('./build')\n    .pipe($.webserver({\n      port: 8079, // Right here!\n      host: 'localhost',\n      fallback: 'index.html',\n      livereload: true,\n      open: true\n    }))\n  ;\n});\n. Are you referring to deploying this repo, or a project you've created with our project template?\n. Sounds good! zurb/foundation-apps-template#26\n. @soumak77 Thanks for putting this together :) Could you apply these features to the external Front Router plugin as well? We won't be dropping the built-in plugin until after 1.2, but new projects are referencing the external plugin.\n. The current version (1.1) is the correct one, it's just been a while since we put out a patch.\nWe're trying to get one out in the next week or two, but the Foundation team is fairly resource-constrained right now working on Foundation for Sites 6, which is launching very soon.\n. Hey friends, we're going to be releasing version 1.2.0 on Friday. This week we're going to be asking the community what issues are most critical to get resolved this week, and we'll be reviewing every pull request. On Thursday we're QAing the release, and then on Friday we're tagging and deploying it.\nWith Foundation 6 out, we're about to shift our focus back to Foundation for Apps. We're thinking about what version 2.0 will be, but we aren't done with version 1.x by any means. I'm opening a new issue to track what people feel is critical to address this week: #725 Thanks for your patience :)\n. Done!\n. CC @rafibomb \n. The command is now just foundation new, as the CLI has been expanded to support the entire Foundation family. I updated the installation docs to reflect this. Sorry for the hassle!\n. Fixed now, sorry for the confusion.\n. @soumak77 Thoughts?\n. @soumak77 Awesome, thank you! We plan on reviewing every PR before Friday. Are there any particular bugs that you think would be critical? (Granted, this isn't a one-and-done thing, we'll be doing more bug-fixing in the future. But this is our first patch in a while so we want to make it count.)\n. @agianikas Yes, we'll be testing in Angular 1.4. The bower.json will likely be a version range, to allow for 1.3 or 1.4.\n. We put out 1.2.0 on Friday. Thanks so much everyone for recommending bugs and pull requests for us to look at! The changelog includes an overview of our plans for 1.3, which will include a few deprecations, so be sure to take a look.\nIf there's anything that needs done for a patch to 1.2, let us know and we'll get to it. Thanks! :)\n. @soyuka I'd hold off on that for now, although we really appreciate the interest :)\nWe're in the early planning stages of Foundation for Apps 2, and we know we need to do a better job of sharing components between frameworks. So we're currently looking at which components are worth sharing, and how exactly we want to share them.\nHowever, we want to keep the community in the loop so they can contribute, so we'll try to publish our thoughts on that soon.\n. @soyuka I'm interested in exploring this option, although it begs the question \"just how many of those jQuery plugins will we be rewriting in Angular?\"\n. @soumak77 I think @zurbchris (who wrote most all of the JavaScript for Sites 6) is very interested in this idea. You can probably count on two hands the number of jQuery functions that are useful when you need to support IE9: addClass, removeClass, hasClass, extend, on/off (not just for the easier syntax, but for event namespacing also).\nOver time the F4S codebase will rely on jQuery less and less, mostly for speed reasons.\nI think wrapping a series of plain JavaScript plugins in jQuery/Angular is sensible, but I've always wondered: are you losing a core benefit of Angular/React/etc., which is more efficient DOM manipulation? Presumably our plain JS plugin is going to be doing its own manual DOM manipulation, and the wrapper will just be calling those methods. So is it that problematic or not? Or is there a different way to address it that I'm not thinking of?\n. @marleneclayton You can rip the CSS out no problem, if you're fine writing your own JavaScript. There are some .ng- classes in the code, but I think over time we can try to make that stuff more library-agnostic.\n. @hguiney It would be relatively straightforward to import any of the Foundation 5/6 CSS components into an apps project, especially the ones that don't share a name with an Apps component, like flex video.\nWe're currently working on the next iteration of Foundation for Apps, and looking at how we can better share CSS between the two frameworks. Because ultimately, a lot of it is the same.\n. @soyuka We need to solidify some of our thinking before we can announce anything, but we can say Apps 2 will be built on Angular 2.\nI'd like to bring people in as soon as possible to get feedback on our ideas, but we probably won't have anything solid to show for another month.\n. @hguiney Yep, you can install the foundation-sites Bower or npm package alongside foundation-apps. In your Sass file, you'll need to selectively @import things, and then also add the @includes to print the CSS of those components. Looking at the 6 component list, you could bring in:\n- Top bar\n- Callout\n- Media object\n- Table\nOr if you turn off any Apps components, you could bring in the Sites equivalent.\n. @cfator We realized this, which is why Sites and Apps will be more tightly coupled in the future. The two frameworks will share most of their CSS, and the main differentiator will be how the JavaScript is implemented. Apps will still have some special components, like it's unique grid, notifications, etc. And of course Apps will be written in Angular.\n. @soyuka You'll use the two grids in tandem. So in Apps, we have .grid-frame, .grid-block and all that, and that will still exist, but the naming scheme will be different. And we'll do a better job of explaining it so it's not crazy confusing.\nThat grid will be used to carve up the sections of your app, and make your fixed headers and sidebars and so on. And then inside that grid (which we're calling a frame right now), you'll use the traditional 12-column grid.\nWe tried overloading the two core apps grid classes, .grid-block and .grid-content, with these two kinds of functionality, but the more we built with it the more of a hassle we realized it was. So now there will be two grids.\nHere's a possible example. Note that .row replaces .grid-container.\nhtml\n<div class=\"frame vertical\">\n  <div class=\"frame-block shrink\"></div>\n  <div class=\"frame-block\">\n    <div class=\"row\"><!-- ... --></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n. @edhatricksmith I'm no longer with ZURB, so unfortunately I couldn't tell you :< But FYI for y'alls, ZURB is hiring a senior engineer if you want to be a part of the process!\n. This is a newer library, so nobody has written any type definitions for us yet. We don't use TypeScript here at ZURB, so we don't have the knowledge (or time) to put one together ourselves.\nIf you are interested in putting one together, we can promote it on our Resources wiki page. :)\n. We currently have a class to switch from horizontal to vertical, but masonry is definitely an interesting idea. One goal of the grid is to sort of wrap up the complexity of flexbox in a handful of easy to understand classes. So if the user could switch from horizontal to vertical to masonry, with options for even spacing and so on, that would be great!\n. We're about to redo a large chunk of this repo to incorporate the Angular stuff that's in development, so this probably won't be relevant after that.\n. We're using a handful of new features in Sass 3.3 and 3.4, so you'll need your Sass gem up to date to get everything working. We don't plan on having libsass support for the time being.\n. If you can, I'd recommend upgrading to at least Sass 3.3, which adds support for the !global keyword but doesn't actually change how variable scope works. 3.4 implements the changes to variable scope.\nThe changes from 3.2 to 3.3 shouldn't break your codebase or any libraries you use.\nEdit: just realized this issue is in the Foundation for Apps repo. This library requires 3.4, while Foundation 5 requires at least 3.3 but we recommend 3.4.\n. Are y'alls having an issue with Foundation 5? This repo is for Foundation for Apps, which is still in alpha.\nBut we are indeed having issues with Sass compatibility right now in Foundation 5 due to a very small disparity between Sass 3.4 and libsass. See this discussion.\n. Looks good, thanks! Although you spelled ZURB wrong ;)\n. Are you running Sass 3.4 and Compass 1.0?\n. We updated the readme to note that you need Sass 3.4 to make this all work.\n. You guys are the best, thanks so much for your input! To respond to a few points brought up here:\nUsing maps for their map-ness: As Hugo and Ben said, the main reason we'd want to use arrays is to loop through their values, or perhaps be able to call variable variables. We're definitely using maps to make managing breakpoints more flexible; it makes outputting those small-, medium- etc. classes more manageable. I had also messed around with putting CSS properties in maps and then outputting them with a mixin, but it seems too restrictive. The map can't reference other values in the map because it's not done being created yet, you can't add mixins, and so on. Maps have also been useful for a lot of little things, like outputting values in mixins based on user input.\nThe thing we're getting hung up on is where using maps gets us structure, but not utility. A few of you touched on this point. Ultimately grouping all button settings into one variable is nice because it gives our code a little more structure, but we would never need to iterate through the values of that map, and we would never need to dynamically access any value in the map. So that means the map exists purely for structure.\nThe map accessing syntax: As a few of you mentioned, the difference between $button-background and foundation(button, background) is almost nil in terms of remembering, but perhaps our audience will better understand what's happening with a variable. The average user of Sass probably understands (or in my opinion, only needs to understand) nesting, variables, partials, and maybe mixins and a few other things. Those core concepts get you most of the awesome functionality out of Sass, and they're relatively easy concepts to pick up. If you're a library author, then you understand all the more complicated bits, like functions, lists, maps, and so on.\nWe don't usually assume our audience understands the complexities behind our tools. (And that's not meant to be an insult, we just want our framework to be accessible!) The theory behind tools like Foundation and Bootstrap is that you can prototype a website without writing any CSS. With Foundation for Apps we're taking that a step further: you can protoype a single page web app without writing any JavaScript. Abstracting complexity is the name of the game here. Of course, it's not cutting advanced users out of the loop; if you know Angular you'll be able to take something from static prototype to functioning web app.\nAnd that brings us back to the point that the map access syntax is awkward. By using maps in this library we're passing along a bit of the complexity of maps on to the user in some small way. Of course they don't have to directly manipulate maps, but they have to access them using the map syntax, which is awkward, even for people who know what they're doing. I think accessing arrays in an entirely functional manner is just super weird, but I guess I understand why Sass was written that way.\nThere are also some little things that make maps a hassle. For example, we often have variables that are interdependent to make theming a little easier.\nscss\n$button-background: $primary-color;\n$button-text-color: if(lightness($button-background) > 50%, #000, #fff);\nYou can't do this in a map, because you can't reference another place in the map while it's still being defined.\nscss\n$button: (\n  background: $primary-color,\n  color: map-get($button, background), // Nope\n);\nThe solution we land on will probably be a more balanced approach to the \"super map\" I was discussing initially. If we use maps for components, each component might get a separate map. There's still an issue of access, though, and I think this syntax would be really awkward for users:\nscss\ncolor: map-get($f-button, color);\nAlso I'm now going to try to wrap this up so I can stop typing. We're trying to figure out a solution soon, so just picking one will be more useful than our team endlessly speculating about different solutions. It doesn't even affect how we develop our components that much, it more affects how our users manipulate them. And I don't know that our users have ever run into problems with our variables interfering with other libraries, so if we just stuck with the \"old way\" of a million variables in a well-organized list, I don't know that people would complain.\nBut thank you so much @HugoGiraudel, @xzyfer, @Undistraction, and @benfrain for giving your input!\n. @AshleyAitken I think some settings will definitely use maps, like breakpoints. It makes outputting, say, visibility classes here way easier, and adding new breakpoints would be super simple. Component settings are the bigger concern. Let's say three big benefits of having arrays are structure, looping, and variable access. For component settings, you only get the first benefit, not the other two. There would never be a need to write an @each loop for button settings, nor would accessing the properties dynamically ever be useful. So you mostly get the benefit of hierarchy, and the question is if that benefit is worth the overhead.\n. @Undistraction I think I know what you're getting at when it comes to defining versus setting configuration. There's a question of usage, also.\nWe know our users are way into the settings file. A common criticism of front-end frameworks is that they're hard to override, so our settings file makes theming the framework components easier.\nSo setting variables is a common practice for our user. But accessing variables is probably a less common practice. There are common ones that people use a lot, like $primary-color or $column-gutter. It's mostly the more high-level settings that allow you to keep your designs aligned with the framework that people use a lot. But, for example, I doubt people often reference $topbar-dropdown-link-color in their custom CSS. They might set that variable to customize the framework, but they'll never reference it again.\n. @DerFrenk You make a good point, although we can't quite assume people are using an IDE with our library. But you're definitely right, since the accessor syntax is a function, an IDE can't intelligently make suggestions for you.\n. @viztastic Since we had this initial discussion, we have found maps to be most useful when used for a very specific purpose. Being able to write loops to output certain classes is super nice. It's especially going to make editing and adding new breakpoints super easy.\nThe variable dump solution isn't ideal, but it's still going to be easiest for our users to wrap their heads around. As for namespacing, we haven't encountered many conflicts with other libraries, although it's possible that really generic mixins and functions can fight with each other.\n. Did you run bower install to get the dependencies?\nEdit: Looks like that postinstall thing that runs bower install automatically disappeared from our package.json. So yeah, that might be your issue.\n. For sure, the repo is undergoing major surgery right now but it'll be back in soon.\n. Back in as of fd18b286fd9d15088e5da7b4ae054f34d6d7ebee.\n. Looks hot! Brandon and I will talk about how we want to shift over our docs pages. There's only a handful of essential ones, but they don't really fit into a single template right now.\nEdit: And of course eventually they'll go away in favor of actual documentation.\n. It'll probably help if we're more explicit about how we want the modal to work. Brandon and I are still learning Angular so the technical bits are still over our heads ;) But there are some specifics related to functionality we didn't get into.\nIn general, I don't think we're going to leverage any of the templating features of custom elements. (I don't think you implemented any of that but just so you know.) In general, layout components like grid blocks, modals, panels, and off-canvas are meant to handle basically any HTML, so I think we just want the fancy tags.\nFor components that have interactivity (i.e. modals, but not buttons), we need the basic functionality to be plug-and-play. So if you drop in the right HTML, it just works, and if you want to dive into advanced configuration (i.e. programmatically opening a modal, or adding an onOpen event listener) you have to write actual JS. It would also be great if we could mask as much of the event handling stuff as possible. So for example, where you have:\nhtml\n<span href=\"#\" class=\"close-button\" ng-click=\"dismiss()\">&times;</span>\nIt would be great if the click event was attached automatically instead of being an attribute here.\nI talked with Brandon and we decided for now, modals should work like this:\n- Modals have to sit on the page they're being called in, kinda like how they work in Foundation 5. Ideally the user has the choice between doing that and referencing an external partial, that would be loaded in when the modal is triggered.\n- Triggering a modal doesn't change the route, and there's no animation configuration yet.\nSo here's an example of what we would like the HTML itself to look like.\n``` html\n Modal trigger \nOpen Modal\n Modal \n\n Modal content \n\n```\nThe idea being if you write this code, the plugin just works. Like I said, Brandon and I are still in the learning process, so we still need to learn how Angular directives differ from your usual JavaScript plugin, which is what we're used to working with.\nLet us know if you have any questions.\n. For now the code is separated by \"this is library code\" (at the root) \"this is stuff the user would edit\" (client/assets). I know it looks odd, but it was meant to be a stopgap measure. I was curious to get your thoughts on this too, like how we eventually distribute the code.\nWe thought it would be cool to distribute the code as the repo itself, so you could just clone it and get going. In this case everything would be inside the client folder. The problem is that it makes it kind of a hassle to update, because to update the core library you'd have to download new files and cut and paste them over the old ones (or we'd automate that with the CLI we eventually build), unless you can think of a clever way to handle versioning and updating.\nThe other option, which mimics how Foundation 5 works, is that we separate the library code and the stack into separate repos. (Admittedly this is how it was set up before.) So to create a project you clone the stack and then install the library code using Bower. This makes updating a lot easier, and also keeps the library files out of version control. If we go this route, we can quickly set it up by (force) pushing all the code on this repo back into foundation-angular, and stripping out the library code and using Bower to install the Sass and JS from this repo.\nAlso whichever route we take, we'll write a CLI in node that handles it all for the user; it's just a matter of how we handle it.\n. Yeah all the Angular directives would be part of the library stuff as well. So the Foundation Bower package would deliver the scss and js folders, along with all of our other dependencies.\nMaybe we could eventually also condense the partial stuff (routing, animation, etc.) into a single Gulp plugin as well, but that's probably a more complex process so we can look at that later.\n. A generic fa-open is a really good idea. The spec we're writing up uses targeted attributes, but we like this idea more from a user perspective. We also like the option of having a generic fa-close inside an element with state, or a targeted fa-close for closing something outside of the element. A third option we'd also like is fa-toggle, and you can probably guess what that does. So that gives developers the flexibility to define open, close, and open/close functionality on controls.\n. @AntJanus Foundation 5's JavaScript suffers from a crippling lack of documentation, so if you could help us get off on the right foot that would be fantastic :)\n. Just internal documentation. For external documentation we'll just want to explain the basics of each API, like how do you open something, close something, etc. And yeah, we won't use JSDoc or anything like that, since we write out own docs. You're free to write that style of documentation (with @param and all that) if you want but we won't run it through any of those doc generators. It's more important that future generations understand how it works when they have to dive in and fix bugs and such.\n. Sweeeeeeet.\n. Regarding the docs, we'd like to slip a Markdown parser into the template pipe so we can write documentation in Markdown, as it just makes things a lot faster to write and maintain. Some Markdown parsers can also detect the three backticks for a code block and wrap it properly and add syntax highlighting. We use marked on Foundation 5, which also has a gulp plugin.\n. @whodidthis The basic components will work fine, but the ones that require JavaScript (panels, popups, dropdowns, etc.) will be written as Angular directives. For now Foundation for Apps and Angular will be tightly coupled, although we do expect people to try and port it to Ember or other frameworks.\nA core idea behind this framework is that you won't need an understanding of Angular or even JavaScript to get started prototyping single-page web apps. We're abstracting out some of the complexity of routing and so on, so you'll only need to understand some of the basics, like what a template is, or why links use the attribute ui-sref instead of href.\n. @davidkpiano As far as choice of framework, you're right that technologies come and go, and maybe in a year people won't care about Angular. But in the short-term, being opinionated makes this thing easier for us to build, and easier for our users to develop on. More portability could be a long-term goal, but it could end up being a hassle to maintain.\nAs far as the active state idea, we've got you covered! Our components all use the class is-active to denote an active state, and we can make that a customizable class most likely. When it comes down to it, most of our plugins are just different ways of showing and hiding things, so they all use the same active class.\n. @HansUXdev Regarding our motion components, currently each one is a mixin that allows you to write a custom animation with specific timing, delays, etc. The code should also only output the keyframe animations you need, so if you don't use our prebuilt classes, it should only output one set of keyframes per mixin called.\nAs far as animated pagination, we're thinking we could accomplish something similar by allowing animation classes to be used on tabs. So when tabs change they play an in/out animation defined by the developer.\n. @HansUXdev @zurbrandon Yep, using UI Router's sub-views you could accomplish something similar. The main difference is if you want each tab to have its own URL or not.\n. @dipongkor We've had some issues with view animation, so for now, try animating your views with just in, not out. Like so:\n```\nname: profile.personalSettings\nurl: /personalSettings\ncontroller: PersonalSettingsCtrl\nanimationIn: fadeIn\n\n```\nThe animations are fast enough that it will still work pretty good. We're working on an overhaul of view animations, which will make simultaneous in/out animations for views work well: #386 \n. @jmkenz Opened an issue at zurb/front-router#4 to track this.\n. @davidkpiano We do want to add sizing classes for panels, it's just a matter of how. Right now panels work off of a maximum width or height, rather than a percentage. Using the panel() mixin (which still needs a lot of adjustment) you can define this size yourself, but we'll also want a few sizing classes for rapid prototyping. We could also allow for percentage sizing, using the same 12-column grid, but you still need to cap the size or it's going to get hilariously tiny on small screens.\nPerhaps the sizing classes can apply to panels and columns? So given an element with these classes:\n``` html\n<div class=\"\n  small-12\n  medium-6\n  large-4\npanel\n  large-block\n\">\n```\nThis element is a 12/12 width panel on small screens, a 6/12 width panel on medium screens, and a 4/12 width panel on large screens. It is a lot of classes, though, and you still have to specify large-block to indicate at what breakpoint the element morphs.\nWe had looked at turning panel into a sizing class itself, like this:\nhtml\n<div class=\"\n  small-panel\n  medium-4\n  block\n\"></div>\nThis element would be a panel on small, and a 4/12 block on medium and up. The shift from panel to block is inferred due to the use of a sizing class. But this might also cut out the ability to resize panels at different breakpoints, unless you make the classes even longer, like small-panel-4, medium-panel-6, etc.\n. @jwvanderbeck Oh you'll definitely be able to use panels on any screen size, the question is if you'd ever want a grid element that is inline on a small screen to then transform into a hidden panel on a large screen.\nFor now we're assuming that's not a common use-case and not supporting it initially. The opposite will be the far more common scenario: you have a hidden off-canvas panel on small screens, that becomes an inline grid element on a larger screen.\n. @jwvanderbeck Your first use case should be possible in JS, as all of the openable/closable plugins emit open and close events that you can hook into.\nThe second use case is a little more tricky, and may just need to be custom-coded. Panels are positioned using position: absolute, and then transitioned in and out using transform: translate(). There's a global active state class (right now it's is-active, but we should probably make it user-configurable) you can hook into to override the default behavior of panels when they're toggled. It is something that's come up for an internal project ZURB is working on that's using Foundation for Apps, so we're looking into it.\nHm.. maybe we can tweak the panel mixin to accept custom \"in\" and \"out\" states to make that functionality easier to write. But I can't promise that for 1.0, which is in a few weeks ;)\n. Yeah, we've run into quite a few problems with the grid on mobile which we've spent a while researching.\nAnother big one is scrolling panes. The grid does \"fixed positioning\" with a vertical flex container, and the middle area is just scrollable. Problem is, iOS loves to get finicky with this, trying to scroll the whole window instead of the inner container. The way around it is JavaScript hacks that selectively disable scrolling or prevent the propagation of the various touch events and so on. It kinda sucks that our grid will probably have a JS dependency, but y'know, mobile browsers.\nIf you or anyone else has experience with it, let us know!\n. @Martinspire We spent a while butting our heads against this scrolling issue in iOS7 on Friday, and today we opened the same demo page in iOS8 and it worked just fine. So Apple fixed it! But we still need to make sure it works in iOS7 and Android 4. (And Windows Phone 8, let's say.)\n. You're right, a month from now iOS8 adoption will probably be high enough for it to not matter, although it has been slower than past releases.\n. @Bernardao I do think that was a point in favor of group and block, they both had more distinct meanings. The main issue is they're both short, one-syllable words, and we routinely confused them in conversation, especially because they overlap in functionality. (For example, unlike Foundation 5 rows, F4A's groups can have sizing classes just like blocks.)\nSome other folks have also pointed out that block and content are used by CMSes, so we might need more specific classes. Maybe grid-block and grid-content? That uses the existing terms we have, but namespaces them to make them more distinct.\n. @Bernardao @Failcookie Also, it will be possible to change the column count from the default of 12, but you'll probably also want to disable the grid classes then, or you're going to have like a billion. So your semantic, percentage-based grid would work like:\n``` scss\n$total-columns: 100;\n// Full width on small, 50% on medium and up\n.some-column {\n  @include grid-block;\n@include breakpoint(medium) {\n    @include grid-size(50);\n  }\n}\n```\nThere is potential for us to build percentage- and ratio-based grids later and let people pick, but I doubt it will be a 1.0 feature.\n. @kenwheeler We considered using an attribute like data-layout to store the grid classes, but ultimately we decided we were solving a problem better solved by just using mixins. The documentation for this framework will emphasize the Sass way of building components much more than the Foundation 5 docs, which puts all of the Sass stuff at the bottom.\nThe two classes we settled on for the grid are grid-block and grid-content. This naming convention fits better with existing components, since the name of the component is actually in the class. The namespacing prevents any conflicts with frameworks like Drupal, which use the classes block or content.\nWe still need to work out a few other naming conventions. One of them is related to the default behavior of the grid. Flexbox can make all of your grid columns equal height, but then none of the boxes will wrap, which is required for a traditional responsive layout. Right now wrapping is the default, and you can add the class stretch to disable wrapping and stretch the columns out. However, in our development we've found stretching to be a more common behavior and we're adding stretch to our grid blocks all the time.\nSo here's the question: should the default behavior be stretching or wrapping? We'll make one the default behavior, and add a class for the other.\n. @kenwheeler We tend to agree, and also stretch is a problematic class name because a block can have a shrink class, which auto-sizes it to its natural width or height. But those are two totally separate behaviors with similar names.\nI think the main distinction is that stretching makes sense for the big structural components of your app, like the panes and so on. But once you get to a content area, maybe you have a grid of cards that you need to collapse from 3-up to 2-up to 1-up. In that case you need wrapping because everything has to stack. (Although for even-width layouts like that, we have [size]-up-[n] classes that do that for you.)\n. @jwvanderbeck, thanks so much for your feedback!\nTo your point about \"groups\" as a concept, you're totally right, and that's why we scrapped them in favor of having just blocks. The two layout objects shared a lot of similar features, which is why we ended up merging them. The reason we're shying away from content as a standalone class is because it's a very generic term, and some CMSes (such as Drupal) use block and content classes already. Of course, class collision will always be a potential issue when you mix libraries, the word \"block\" is so generic that we're probably better off prefixing it with the word \"grid\", just to be safe.\nAs for scrolling, what browser are you using? We're having some troubles with Safari right now, but the newest versions of Chrome and Firefox should handle scrolling content just fine. All grid blocks will scroll by default if their content overflows.\n. @jwvanderbeck Unfortunately vertical sizing is not as full-featured as horizontal sizing, which is a quirk of flexbox. You can size vertical grid units these ways:\n- Stretching: this is the default behavior; the block takes up all the leftover space it can.\n- Shrinking: add the class shrink and the block will only take up as much vertical space as its content needs.\n- Manual sizing: use the flex-basis property to set a px, em, rem, vh, etc. value to size the block.\nI'm sure what you're trying to do is size with percents, and unfortunately you can't. We were hoping to make the behavior of the horizontal and vertical grid identical, but that's the one place where they aren't.\n. @jwvanderbeck So one thing to understand is that you don't need to alternate blocks and content blocks. It's not like rows and columns in Foundation, where they have to alternate. So your last example can be condensed down like this:\n.frame.vertical\n    .block.content.shrink\n    .block.stretch\n        .block.content.small-3\n        .block.content.small-3\n        .block.content.small-3\nBlocks always move horizontally by default, and that behavior doesn't cascade down to nested grid elements. So you always need to define a vertical grid on every block that you want to have vertical children. In the above example, only the highest-level grid element (the app frame) is vertical. Those small-3 blocks will be arranged horizontally.\nThe grid is still missing formal documentation (and will soon be refactored slightly), so props to you for trying to figure it out :)\n. @djgadd We do need responsive versions of the shrink class, and also probably an expand class to revert a grid element back to the default behavior, with responsive versions of that class as well.\n. I think switching to libsass would be ideal, and we'll probably do it pretty soon, since they just recently implemented maps. I'd like to see if proper @each functionality will make it in soon, which so far is the main way we access maps in our codebase.\nA common complaint about Foundation 5 is that it takes a long time to set up: Node, Git, Ruby, Bower, Grunt, and our gem are all dependencies. With libsass we can cut out the Ruby dependency, with libgit we can git out the Git dependency (we use it in F5 to download the stack), and with a bit of finagling we can run locally-installed copies of Bower and Gulp instead of requiring them globally.\nIf we work at it we can have a pure JS stack, which would be real nice.\n. So Foundation 5 downloads the Compass and Libsass stacks using Git, just cloning the repos we have set up. The problem is, you need Git installed on your system beforehand, so that adds another dependency. We can use libgit2, which is a portable, C implementation of Git to do that instead. There's a node version called nodegit, so we can basically run git clone using JavaScript instead of the user's command line.\nAs for the @each thing, what I'm talking about is doing:\nscss\n@each $key, $value in $map {\n}\nThere is another way to do this in libsass, but we might hold out a little longer and see if proper @each support gets in there, instead of refactoring what we have right now.\n. We've moved the codebase to libsass; it should be merged into the master branch tomorrow.\n. @Martinspire It's not. Our starter template for Apps uses Libsass.\n. @ilanbiala Which specific part do you feel is too opinionated? Our stack, our Angular helpers, or Angular itself?\n. @ilanbiala Ah yeah, understandable. I think the eventual plan before the first release is to split up the codebases, so the library itself stays here, and the actual stack moves to another repo and becomes the template project. The Sass, JS, and maybe the Angular helpers will be distributed through Bower. That way you can use our components and directives any way you'd like.\n. @viztastic The documentation is currently being written, but not all of the pages are on the master branch yet.\n. Closing this as we are _mere days from release :O_\n. @ilanbiala We'll have a few template projects ready for people to look at and download.\n. @AntJanus Sweeeet. Would it make sense to eventually package these as Gulp tasks? I've been looking into writing Sass unit tests and I could run those just by using a separate Sass task in Gulp.\n. Yep, we have plans to improve menu bar, namely by adding support for sub-menus and improving the switch to mobile.\nThat being said, we're also working on Foundation for Sites 6 right now, and we're trying to overhaul the top bar. We think it's inflexible and hard to customize, since it's basically designed to do one thing well. We're trying to unify patterns between the two frameworks, so whatever ideas we have for Sites will likely make it back to Apps. The main difference is that the Apps menu bar will be written in Flexbox.\n. @philippeluickx We'll need to take a hard look at the keyboard thing pretty soon here, because it does seem to work poorly with certain layouts, especially ones with a fixed footer and header. It's also possible that different mobile platforms handle the keyboard different with regards to calculated screen size, how it overlays the page, and so on.\n. Yeah, the codebase is still sort of in a \"random things are broken\" state, although the plan this week is to start scaffolding out the documentation, so that should change soon.\nAll of the components on the Playground page should work. Notifications don't work anymore because they haven't been converted into an Angular directive yet; it's still just a vanilla jQuery plugin. As for the links, they do work, they're just aren't very many yet. You probably tried clicking on the things in that component list off to the left... secretly, they aren't links, just some weird, deceptive table of contents ;)\n. @ilanbiala A lot of the code is still in flux, so we probably won't accept any pull requests until 1.0 is out. However, we would love your feedback on any of the existing components or features. Ask us questions, make suggestions, tell us we're wrong, etcetera. (Me, I'd like to see more people comment on our grid classes, because we need some feedback on them.)\n. Hard to say, but it won't be more than a few weeks until 1.0 is out, so we'll let y'alls know closer to the ship date :)\n. I've noticed the Angular error too, but the page loads fine for me. Are you accessing the site on port 3001?\n. @YuriGor @mehlah What OS are you guys on?\n. @YuriGor The server we're using is just for testing, but it will probably make it into our template stack as well. It's a little easier than configuring the routing to work in a sub-directory.\nHowever, you'll be free to run your code in any environment you like.\n. @t1mmen There's been an \"angular is not defined\" error for a while, but it was actually unrelated to the core Angular functionality. Either way the code causing that issue has been removed (9f55f8a9901ceda84e12bf2d0bd7a0b48499e9b8).\nAs for the Sass, do you have Ruby and Sass 3.4 installed?\n. @YuriGor If you're running the code in a subdirectory (i.e. localhost/foundation-apps/build) it won't work out of the box\u2014you have to tell the UI router what directory the app is in (see here for a solution).\nIt's also possible your xampp setup is messing with Gulp's server, so instead, you can run gulp build to build the site once without running a server.\n. Just a heads up, friends, we're trying a different server plugin for Gulp that seems to generate less errors and just work better.\nThe port number is different\u2014it's 8080 instead of 3001.\n. When we first started planning the plugins, we made a bunch of really basic ones as a proof-of-concept, using jQuery and basic DOM manipulation. Our ace engineer @AntJanus has spent the last few weeks converting them all into actual Angular plugins. Notifications, popups, and action sheets still haven't been converted into Angular. Once that's done we'll drop jQuery and just use what Angular has built-in.\nThe real plugins are under js/angular, while the old plugins are under js/foundation.\n. @ilanbiala No problem, just looking at the code it probably looks weird :)\n. @Failcookie The JS plugins are being developed in js/angular. (The old plugins are in js/foundation, and they're still being converted to Angular directives.) Our Angular guy is out for the week, and he's the most equipped to explain that stuff ;)\nYou might also be interested in looking at our Angular helpers, which are in gulpfile.js under the copy-templates task. This bit of code converts configuration data stored at the top of every template file (under client/templates) into routing, animation, and controller configuration for Angular. It allows us to quickly define URLs for pages, how those pages animate, and what Angular controllers they use, without writing any JavaScript.\n. I was able to write a basic controller that pulled data from an API and spit it out. After writing the controller, I added it to the template like this:\n```\nname: page\nurl: /page\ncontroller: PageControllerName\n\n```\nThe only things we're \"enforcing\" with Angular so far are the use of ui-router and ng-animate, but even that stuff you could rip out if you knew what you were doing.\n. @ilanbiala You can see all of the animation mixins under scss/components/_motion.scss, but we haven't yet properly implemented them with all the Angular stuff. We were using animate.css to do basic testing of the concept.\n. There are two kinds of blocks in the grid system: ones used for layout and ones used for content. To use a block for content, add the class content to the block. This turns off the flexbox functionality and adds gutters. So they're like columns, more or less.\nSecond, I'd recommend not using set heights for your elements if you can help it\u2014let the content dictate the height instead. A block will automatically scroll if its content is too tall for the box, but you can add overflow: hidden to the block to disable that. We should probably add a no-scrolling class.\nEdit: Here's how I would modify your markup:\nhtml\n<div class=\"block\" style=\"padding-top:7.5px; padding-bottom:7.5px\">\n  <a href=\"#\">\n    <div class=\"medium-1 content block\" style=\"background-color:gray;margin:0 10px;overflow: hidden;padding:0;-webkit-box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .50);-moz-box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .50);box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .50);\">\n      <img src=\"http://placehold.it/100x100\" style=\"width:100%;position: relative;\">\n    </div>\n  </a>\n  <div class=\"medium-10 content block\" style=\"-webkit-box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .50);-moz-box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .50);box-shadow: 0px 2px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, .50);\">\n    <h4 style=\"margin-top:9px;line-height: 1.2\">Title <small>(Platform)</small></h4>\n    <p style=\"font-size: .7rem;line-height: 1.3;\">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Dolore quaerat, assumenda natus! Amet numquam praesentium ab molestiae, excepturi minus dignissimos nemo, quam magnam tempore fugiat, sit reprehenderit laborum perspiciatis atque?</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n. Brandon and I are going to review all of the components today, so we'll get back to you soon.\nOne thing we were wondering is if there would be a way to add onOpen and onClose events to these components, or at least a way callbacks to specific directives. This was something I was trying to implement in my test plugins, but Angular isn't really into the jQuery on method. Most of the Foundation 5 JS plugins fire events when plugins do things, and for the ones that don't it's a commonly-requested feature to add.\n. Go for it!\n. If it works standalone then we could put it on NPM. If it's not, that's also probably fine too, since at the moment it's probably somewhat tightly coupled to our stack and our JS anyway.\n. If it requires some of our own code to work, it might make more sense to keep the plugin in this repo for now. It's very Foundation for Apps + Angular specific at the moment, so at least if we keep it here all of our development can stay mostly in this one repo. I guess I don't have a huge preference though ;)\n. I guess the stack will have to pull the Gulp plugin out of the Bower package, I don't know if that's a bad practice or not. Dev tools typically come from NPM.\n. @rafibomb is writing our documentation, so all of this stuff will be super useful. Once we're done moving it to our formal docs we can just remove the file.\n. Can you show an example of how to open/close/toggle components in JS?\n. Other things I thought of:\n- How to set up a base URL if the app is running in a subdirectory (in case you're uploading code to a server)\n- How to set up rewrite rules if you aren't using the test server\nThese things are already covered in the UI Router wiki (here and here), so we can probably just explain the basics and then link to this. As long as people are aware that those things come up we should be good.\n. You can merge it in and we can take it from there while you work on other things.\n. Oh one thing we'll need to document is how you as the Angular engineer properly import these modules if you're building your own project. Or whatever typical boilerplate stuff you think is necessary to properly document an Angular module.\n. Good catch, that's a holdover from Foundation 5. At the moment the global Sass file is being imported in foundation.scss, not inside individual files.\n. Totally! The official release is next month. By next week we should have the template project set up, which will make installing and updating a project much easier.\n. We're actually going to switch the compiler to libsass 3.0.1 in the next week, although I don't know if it will make a difference or not.\n. @jpdesigndev It will be an entertaining ride, but with libsass's commitment to catching up with Ruby Sass, it has a good future ahead of it.\n. We've found it easier to use and understand than Grunt, and it's reached a point where a lot of the big Grunt plugins also have Gulp versions.\nOur template project will use Gulp, but it will be possible to use our components with pretty much any other build system. The main thing you're going to lose for now is use of our Angular helpers, which do the routing and animation stuff. People are already talking about trying to port this to Ember when it comes out, so I could see people recreating the Angular helpers as a Grunt task.\n. Once you've installed everything, run npm test to get the test server going, and then go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser. If you specifically go to localhost:8080/home, you can see a kitchen sink with most of the components we have.\nWe're working on the formal documentation right now, but it hasn't yet made it into the master branch.\n. Oh, I totally missed that leftover code. You can remove all of that stuff under the @import statements.\n. @jwvanderbeck Oh yeah, our stack is just a starting point, and we don't intend to prescribe exactly how to use our components, so the choice is more for what our stack should use as a default. Ideally the codebase works with Ruby Sass 3.4 and libsass 3.0+, which I think is doable, but little things keep coming up.\nThe main goal for the stack would be that it's effective as a rapid prototyping tool. As for taking code to production, we expect developers to mess with the structure of their app a lot more.\n. @AntJanus The docs folder should be all lowercase, or it's going to bug me ;) It was made capitalized on accident it would seem.\n. @AntJanus Oh well it wasn't you who renamed the folder, but I haphazardly changed all instances of \"Docs\" in the gulpfile to \"docs\" not thinking it mattered, so that was my bad.\n. @AntJanus Can you remove the whole folder from version control in one commit, and then re-add it in a second one? Just renaming the folder destroys the history anyway so it's probably not a huge deal. Sweeping structural changes are probably still okay before 1.0.\n. Is there not a clever/really irresponsible way to transfer all of the attributes of the <img> tag to the <svg> tag that's injected?\nIf not I think telling people \"don't get fancy with these\" is fine. Put your click events on anchors outside the icon, etc.\n. Sounds good. I'm trying to think, what are common things people might try to put directly on icons? Click events seem like an obvious one. But we'll probably just train our users to only put icons inside of other interactive things. Like if you have a button with an icon, make a .button element and put your directives on that.\n. Great! As for the actual icons, Brandon and I have a list of the ones we've agreed with the Iconic folks to use, so we'll get those in version control soon.\n. Yeah, we can probably put them in a folder at the root of the repo. So in production you copy them out of bower_components/foundation-apps/iconic. I'ma go figure out which icons those are today and I can push them to this branch.\n. Merge'd\n. Yep, they definitely should. The user should be able to change the names and values of the breakpoints as they please.\n. Yep, looks like they're hardcoded right now. We'll resolve that soon.\n. The grid classes just had a lot of work done to them, and proper support for the $breakpoint-classes variable was a part of that.\n. I haven't had time to work on it; we're finishing up a few final components (typography, forms, and menu bar namely) first. This PR should be ready by the end of the week, though.\n. Grid classes successfully refactored, and surprisingly working right in the newest Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, and IE10. Just working out some final kinks.\n. Boy howdy do I love this chain of dependencies haha. I guess this is another compelling reason to use Ruby as the default Sass compiler; nothing is changing on that front for a while.\n. We'd like to tag something as a release candidate next week, we just have a small number of components that still need finished.\n. We have this template that pulls in the Apps codebase through Bower. This is what our end users will eventually use.\nIf you want to incorporate the code now, you can run bower install zurb/foundation-apps --save to get the code in your own stack. The bower package includes the Sass, JavaScript, and Gulp plugin for routing.\n. Ah, well we just got it working in the past few days. :)\n. Strange, I'm not sure why it's looking for a repo called \"bower-foundation-apps\". When I run the same command it gets this repo. You can also try being more explicit:\nbash\nbower install https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps.git\n. @jwvanderbeck How do you think we should change the delivery of the files?\nFor now it's likely that the Angular helpers will require a somewhat specific build process, but we also don't expect many Angular developers to take them to production, so they can just be removed in that case.\n. @jwvanderbeck Our documentation will have a getting started page that outlines these two options\u2014using our pre-made template, versus installing the components yourself using Bower.\n. We're planning on tagging a release candidate tomorrow, and we can try to outline what's left for the 1.0 release. I can tell you that the codebase is more or less feature-complete, so our big focus for the next few weeks is code cleanup, writing documentation/tests, and bug-fixing.\nWhen 1.0 is out, we also plan to maintain a roadmap of planned new features. We know there will be a lot of holes in the feature set, or people are going to try to do things we didn't anticipate, so we already have ideas for new features and components that we don't have time to get in for 1.0. \n. @viztastic We want to do tutorial videos, it's just a matter of if we have time before 1.0. But this grid is so different that we obviously need to educate people on how it works.\nWhat we will have for 1.0 is a handful of templates that use all of the different components in various ways.\n. Yay release candidate!\n. I'll see if I can mess around with your markup, but here's a few things:\nYour first panel has two classes that conflict: shrink and xxlarge-1. shrink reduces the panel's width (in a horizontal grid) or height (in a vertical grid) to whatever the size of the content inside the panel is. xxlarge-1 sizes the column equal to 1/12 of the parent.\nThe panel should also be written as an Angular directive to get the proper functionality:\nhtml\n<div fa-panel position=\"left\" class=\"no-scroll xxlarge-block xxlarge-1 shrink\" id=\"statspanel\">\n</div>\nIt can then be opened and closed by adding the attribute fa-toggle=\"statspanel\" to any other element.\nTo your last point about alignment, unfortunately you can't align individual children in a grid, only the grid parent. So when you set align-right on a block, your aligning all of the blocks inside that one to the right.\n. I just removed that code since we aren't using it anymore. ce6dac4d497c10d13551c382380ae4d5c7c6bbab\n. Can we include both tasks, using Ruby Sass as the default one? It would be useful if Travis could try compiling with both so we can check for errors.\n. If Ruby Sass works, you can merge it in and I'll make it work in libsass eventually.\n. I removed a few older branches, and it looks like all the ones leftover are in active development, even if they don't have PRs.\n. I don't see those on GitHub, so if you happen to have them on your local machine, then yeah, they can be deleted.\n. Yeah I just added that and didn't update the documentation to specify that you now need Bundler.\nIf possible we'd like to avoid what happened with Foundation 5, where Sass 3.4 introduced a breaking change and none of the existing Foundation projects out there had a Gemfile, so anyone who upgraded their system-wide Sass was screwed. And of course, it's always worthwhile to specify your dependencies.\n. I was updating the readme on Friday but didn't finish it. I'll get that change in today.\n. Instructions to install Bundler were added here: 78e1b0a38e2ac7fcfa907968d71a13b9838bb83f\n. We have styles for the native <progress> and <meter> elements, although the styles aren't yet finalized, and they still need mixins. The <meter> element is cool because it can automatically change between high, medium, and low colors based on its current and max value. Unfortunately it's not supported in IE10.\n. The component hasn't changed since it was originally written a few months ago, so it should still be working. The <meter> element in particular has a lot of options, though, so it is kinda confusing; here's some good documentation on it.\n. The codebase will indeed be compatible with Ruby Sass and libsass, but since libsass is in active development it will be something of an entertaining ride making sure the codebase works with it. That being said, we're big libsass fans so we'd like the framework to work with it.\n. So, because of some quirks with how CSS handles vertical alignment, it's not possible to size vertical grid elements with percentages. Your options are:\n- Have the block fill all leftover space; this is the default\n- Have the block shrink with the shrink class; this means it will only take up as much space as it needs. This is useful for headers and footers, which tend to be thinner anyway.\n- Size the block explicitly with the flex-basis property. It has to be an explicit unit like px, rem, em, or vh; it can't be percentage.\nIt is a weird inconsistency to be sure, but it will be reflected in our documentation.\n. Blocks use overflow: auto, which means they only show scroll bars if there's too much content in the element. There's currently no class to change that, but you could add overflow: hidden to a grid element to stop it from happening.\nTo achieve the layout you're describing, here's the layout I'd suggest:\nslim\n.vertical.grid-frame\n  .shrink.grid-block.header\n    p Header\n  .grid-content\n    .grid-block#row\n      .grid-content.small-3.sidebar\n      .grid-content.small-6#main\n      .grid-content.small-3.sidebar\n    .footer\nOnce you're inside a grid-content element, the grid changes slightly to act more like the Foundation 5 grid. This is what you want, because you don't want that sub-grid to try and stretch the length of its parent\u2014you just want the whole parent to scroll like a normal container.\nIn the above example, fill #main with sample content and you'll see that the whole lower container will scroll, not just the center area.\nNow, can you make the sidebars, which have a gray background, stretch to the bottom of the parent until it starts overflowing? Not easily. Unfortunately vertical sizing is still a hassle in some scenarios.\n. Awesome! Glad I can help. We know the grid is kind of confusing; we've got some good documentation in the works that we should have in the master branch soon.\n. One of our guys has that issue also, where bower install is putting things in app/bower_components or something like that. I tried searching around for where a system-level setting for that exists but I couldn't find anything. So we can just add a .bowerrc to lock that down.\n. Do you have a visible example in the repo? Or is it similar to the panel thing we were talking about on the phone yesterday?\n. I can't test it right now, but there might be a quick fix we can do. It seems like the issue is that \"hidden\" components like panels are briefly being exposed while views shift around.\nscss\n// Select all views\n[ui-view] {\n  // Only select views being transitioned\n  .ng-enter-active, .ng-leave-active {\n    // Only select components inside those transitioning views\n    [fa-panel], [fa-offcanvas] { // Etc.\n      // Now hide those suckers\n      display: none !important;\n    }\n  }\n}\n. @ilanbiala The animations will follow the format prescribed by Angular's animation module, where transitions are structured like this:\nscss\n.transitionName {\n  &.ng-enter {\n    // Before state\n    &.ng-enter-active {\n      // After state\n    }\n  }\n}\nOur transition mixins will allow you to create animations with more nuance, by adjusting direction, origin, timing, and so on.\nscss\n.customTransition {\n  @include slide($args...);\n}\nBut if you want to write your own totally different transitions, they'll work as long as they use the ng- classes.\n. :+1: \n. That was my concern, I'm not sure if there are any minor structural differences in output, but I don't think there are.\nSo yeah, a diff check would definitely be useful, although I know right now that libsass doesn't work, so initially it shouldn't be required for a passing build. I think 1.0 will be Ruby Sass only, but the gap in features is pretty small, so either we can work our codebase backwards slightly or wait for libsass to add a handful of new features and fix a few bugs.\nLet's add tasks for it but not build it into the initial test suite. Once we're more confident libsass will work consistently, we can add libsass compilation and diff checking to the formal test process.\n. Yeah, that's fine. Our main tests will be the JS and the Sass, compiled with Ruby.\n. In progress here: #146\n. Merged here: 459c49ce522d7a82fc65e3cb15879ed657fcbfaf\n. The close directive is triggering an error and not functioning. This happens whether or not the attribute has a value. Try messing with it in the index file in our documentation, which uses a panel for the sidebar nav.\n. :+1: \n. Pretty sure this commit inadvertently fixed this: daa858918ca4dd6c32d3648ff127e5ffea0cebfb\n. :+1:\n. I just added bundle to npm's post-install process, which will properly set up the gems for you. You're supposed to run bundle once as a apart of the setup process, but that wasn't in the documentation. So now it does it for you!\n. The revamped classes that use ng-enter, ng-enter-active, et al. were merged in here: 1f222b694d3ed3ae91aba101c32a666fdacbc689\n. Added in this commit: cfa79f97352eae00cdea9b318e7657a6932d32fe\n. Talked with @zurbrandon and we agree, the directive name should be the same, making the revised syntax:\nhtml\n<zf-accordion>\n  <zf-accordion-item></zf-accordion-item>\n</zf-accordion>\n. I'M ON THE CASE\n. Looks like the last thing to do would be to add plain English descriptions for each page, so it doesn't just show a raw view name with hyphens in the search results.\n. I'm doing a sweep right now. You think it's okay to delete your test pages? We've got live examples (mostly) working on the pages for each component.\n. Talked to @zurbrandon, we'll go without notification support for now.\n. Fixed with: 7632696c4925c614d9f5560904e81f9ac733b3d1\n. Okay, confusingly this bug stopped happening.\n. Yep, I tried to do it last night but I got errors, so I must not have configured it properly. The pristine app.js doesn't need the markdown or hljs modules.\n. @viztastic For the code samples, we're shifting from using a Markdown parser to using an Angular implementation of highlight.js, but not every sample has been fixed yet.\n@AntJanus Ah okay, so this is like the other animation stuff where you need an in-between setup phase. Normally the overlay is display: none, and then when a modal is called in, it needs to be set to display: flex and opacity: 0, first, and then set to opacity: 1 to trigger the transition.\nThe modal overlay doesn't need any animation support\u2014it should just be hardcoded to fade in and out. So if I add those two states (probably just with ng-enter and ng-enter active to keep it consistent, and scrap is-active) would that work?\nUnfortunately we can't do the lazy method with pointer-events: none, because IE10 confusingly doesn't support it.\n. Fixed in this commit: 63fb722c13d1317a6bc20d1c03ebd74501ffd615\n. padding class added here: fdbff5d248b5889c29653eb06b775226fd89cf20\nRemoved padding from container components here: daa858918ca4dd6c32d3648ff127e5ffea0cebfb\n. :+1: \n. Pull request in progress here: #269\n. display: block is what makes the element show. The !important, although a bit annoying, is necessary because a single class can easily be overridden by most other selectors. And there's no other quick way to show/hide elements\u2014you can't use visibility: hidden or opacity: 0.\nWe don't currently have a solution for using these classes with inline or inline-block elements in Foundation 5, either. We'd either have to add modifier classes (show-for-medium inline) or create new ones (show-for-medium-inline), which will add a ton of code.\nIf we added the option to specify your visible state in the mixins, would that be helpful? We have mixin versions of the visibility classes now:\nscss\n.thing {\n  @include show-for(medium)\n}\nWhat if you could change the block to another value like inline-block or table-cell?\nscss\n.thing {\n  @include show-for(medium, inline-block)\n}\n. Alrighty, we updated the visibility classes to use flex instead of block when the element has grid-block in its class attribute.\nThe visibility mixins were also updated, so you can override the use of block, like so:\nscss\n.thing {\n  @include show-for(medium, table-cell);\n}\n. @jmkenz For Foundation 6 we're going to switch to max-width media queries to avoid the display: block issue altogether. I think eventually we'll transplant that fix to Apps as well.\nSee zurb/foundation#6687\n. @jmkenz It's only for .show-for-* classes, so that you never need to assign display: block to an element. We can refactor the visibility classes to only apply display: none to an element, negating the need for element-specific visibility classes (table.show-for-medium and so on).\nIt does break our mobile-first rule, which is sort of a tough call to make, but we've only made that call for this specific feature. The class itself still follows mobile first logic: \"show this on x size and up\", even if the rule in the background is max-width.\n. Fixed in this commit: 63fb722c13d1317a6bc20d1c03ebd74501ffd615\n. Fixed here: b4aed57c33fdb9561663c3dad24dfdac019f56e8\n. Doesn't appear to be an issue anymore.\n. Done!\n. Closing and adding to our list of known issues.\n. This is being fixed in Firefox 35, which will be out in January. It will be a momentous occasion.\n. I think you were looking at that page while I was doing a rebase, so that nonsense ain't there anymore.\n. Fixed in this commit: b18f48fab0f302d4f08a50d6ca525cb4d273294c\n. Doesn't seem to be an issue anymore.\n. Good idea, we'll get somebody on it.\n. Site just went live so the 401 is gone, and I just updated the readme: 7d1c876956182fa2a4a2f8f133fb69aa83e55552\n. Went ahead and converted them to anchors. As far as accessibility, it's something we'll have to wait to look at farther down the road when the framework is more solid.\n. No, we love nitpicking! :) Thanks.\n. Here you are. May need some fleshing out but it's a start.\n. What version of Sass are you compiling with?\n. Oh! Yes. I didn't look close enough at the code sample.\nfoundation.scss imports the entire framework at once, so you don't need to import _global.scss after it. And the settings file should be imported before the Foundation libraries, so it can be used to override variables.\n. Yes, there should be one. We'll get one in there shortly.\n. I moved the settings file to the scss folder so it'll show up in the Bower package. Just need to do some testing with the template stack, which already has a settings file. It needs to import the settings file not in the Bower package, but the one in the client/assets/scss folder instead.\n. I'll look into it, but thankfully that step of the process is just a welcome message\u2014it doesn't set anything up.\n. That might work. Also, the source code for the CLI is here, in case anyone who knows more about Node than me can help :)\nhttps://github.com/zurb/foundation-cli\n. @jsmreese I can see in your screenshot that it's connecting the CLI's main JavaScript file to a command on your system (C:\\Users\\John...\\npm\\foundation-apps), is that command there at that path?\n. @peterblazejewicz I implemented your fix, which should solve the problem.\nnpm update -g foundation-cli\n. Awesome! @jsmreese @dhye360 @peterblazejewicz let me know if it works for y'alls.\n. Alright, I'll look into it. Thanks so much for being helpful and patient, guys :)\nIn the mean time, you can do what the installer does by hand:\nnpm install\nbower install\nbundle\n. @narration The initial hope was to use more portable libraries, but it didn't totally pan out. For example, we were going to use nodegit, which is a portable version of Git for Node, but it wasn't able to clone over HTTPS, so we couldn't use it. Some of the Node-based tools we use or have considered using are in active development, so sometimes things get weird.\nSeeing the issues that have cropped up, though, I think we'll take another look at it. Bower and NPM both have programmatic APIs, although Bower's isn't too thoroughly documented from what I can tell. But we can make it work! The only odd bird is Bundler, although the codebase is very close to working with libsass, at which point we can just drop Ruby from the stack entirely.\n. @viztastic Well, the framework came in a little hot last week, so we'd just like to get a slightly more stable version out for people using the framework this early. It's just a lot of little bug fixes.\nThe Bower package is also currently missing the _settings.scss file, so if you install the framework standalone that file isn't as easy to find.\n. Can any Windows users help us test a new build of the CLI? We're working on improving error-handling and cross platform support.\nHere's how to run the test install:\ngit clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-cli.git\ncd foundation-cli\nnpm install\nnpm test\nIf all goes well, you'll see three green check marks at the end of the install. If you get an error, please paste it in here so we can take a look. Thanks!\n. @tnedich Fixed that: 3d9b47\nThe command should at least start now.\n. Hmm, well luckily we're going to remove Ruby from the install process entirely, so I won't stress about that. The Git, npm, and Bower parts working are the most critical.\n. @jgamao Which error are you getting? And is it with the current CLI or this test version?\n. @fhassan2014 Ah, sorry about that, there was a line of debugging code I left uncommented that forces an error to happen. If you have time, could you try testing it again? I'd appreciate it :)\n- Delete the test folder the CLI created\n- Run git pull\n- npm test again\n. @fhassan2014 The template project uses Bundler to install the right version of Sass for you. Run bundle install and then try compiling again.\nThe next version of the CLI won't require Ruby or Bundler, thankfully :)\n. @fhassan2014 Ah that's fantastic :) Thanks again for trying it out.\n. @fhassan2014 You can just run gulp if you have it installed globally. The way the watch and build commands work changed slightly in the new CLI, although the functionality is the same.\nfoundation-apps watch is identical to npm start which is identical to gulp.\n. @fhassan2014 Try just running gulp inside your project folder instead, since that's what the watch command is running. (If you don't have Gulp: npm install -g gulp)\nThe watch command will make more sense once all three of the Foundation frameworks use the CLI, and then watch becomes a shorthand for \"run whatever this project needs to run\".\n. @soumak77 Ink is the third one, which is being rebranded as Foundation for Emails when v2.0 comes out in a few months. Unifying the branding partially represents our push to share more code, styles, and best practices between the three frameworks.\n. @fhassan2014 The second error EADDRINUSE means you already have a server for another Apps project running, or at least you have something else running on port 8080. Close out your other build process, run gulp again, and then it should work.\n. @fhassan2014 It looks like the Sass isn't compiling to CSS; that's why there's a \"Not Found\" error in the console, for css/app.css. Are you still getting the same gulp-ruby-sass error in your other screenshots?\n. @fhassan2014 I just noticed you're running a pre-release build of JRuby, so I think that's the issue. The error is being generated by the Sass executable, meaning it's a Ruby error, not a JavaScript one. You might need to switch to a stable version of JRuby, or file an issue with their team.\n. This is a somewhat older issue, so I'm going to close it out. The original issue filed has been fixed, and version 1.1 of the CLI, which we published last month, greatly improves the stability and error-handling of the project creation process.\nIf y'alls have any more issues with the CLI in the future, do let us know :)\n. Doesn't look like it says ZMusic anymore. http://foundation.zurb.com/apps/app-templates/travel/#!/\n. Fix'd.\n. Thanks!\n. There's a Markdown parser in our docs still, so it's converting that URL into an anchor. We should be able to remove that pretty soon, because all of our docs are written in pure HTML now.\n. Fixed with #208.\n. Thanks!\n. I had noticed an issue with the get-border-value() function not returning values properly, but that's a small problem. I think there are also a few places in the code where we use @if not, and libsass doesn't properly support not. So you'd have to change any statements like that to be more specific, i.e. @if $val == false.\n. Alright, I'm going to call libsass support official.\nOur plan is to eventually compile the documentation and the template stack with libsass by default, and drop our Ruby dependency, but of course we'll keep testing in Ruby Sass as well.\nThe Foundation 5 CLI gives the user the option to pick their compiler. Would people care if we dropped that choice and just made libsass the default? I feel like if you're savvy enough to want to use the new Sass 3.4 features, you're savvy enough to know how to switch a Sass compiler ;)\n. It'll definitely be in 1.0.3 :)\n. I think that would be a better option, changing the $orientation parameter of the grid-frame and grid-block mixins. The default should be horizontal to match how the class system works.\nIf you'd like to make the change I can merge it in :)\n. Ah yeah, good catch. Let's say $orientation, because that same term is used for menu bar and tabs as well.\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. We added a fix to the template repo: cf139fc51fea7df85268c8b35425ab0014342d26\n. Whenever you see a \"Cannot find module\" error, it means you're missing an npm package, so you can run npm install to get the package. So this is likely an issue with the CLI.\nHere's a question, @shanecarmody: do you typically run sudo npm install versus just a regular npm install? The CLI currently has issues with people who have Node configured to where you need sudo to install things.\n. I noticed that the Yeoman CLI, which I borrowed a few libraries from, doesn't directly address this issue\u2014they link you to tutorials on how to properly configure Node instead. Possibly because it's a tricky problem to solve.\nIt's tricky because you have to detect that a normal npm install is failing, and then follow it up with a sudo npm install. I think the error is usually EACCESS, so you can probably catch that, but maybe there are other random ways an npm install can fail also.\nIt's also tricky for me to test because I don't have access to a machine that requires sudo when you install things, and I'm not sure if there's a way to fake that environment. I'd have to borrow a coworker's computer instead ;)\n. I think as a stopgap we can add a check to see if you ran sudo npm install -g foundation-cli, and then every time you build a new project tack on a warning saying \"you might need to run these commands by hand\" or something like that.\n. The issue with machines that require sudo is a known one, and we're looking to fix it shortly.\n. Ah, we need to remove those, as the framework doesn't currently support RTL. It's on the list of things we want to add in the future.\nInstead of using the $default-dir and $opposite-dir variables, we might look into using css-flip instead, which would automate a lot of that process.\nAnother request we had for Foundation 5 is better support for bi-directionality, which seems like a trickier problem. If anyone has input on that, or the use of CSS Flip (or similar tools), let us know!\n. RTL support is now on our roadmap, but it probably won't happen until we're a few patches in.\n. @jahtalab We don't have a specific timeline right now, but now's a good a time as any to examine our approach to RTL. We're also working on Foundation 6 right now, which will continue to have RTL support, so we should use the same approach for both.\nWe had looked at using css-flip to make the process more automated, but I don't think it will cover every use-case we have in our codebase. It also only works with CSS, not Sass.\nIf you're interested in contributing, that would be great! We're currently figuring out if there's a more elegant way to implement RTL than our current setup with the $default-float and $opposite-direction variables. Maybe a more generic flip() function that converts from left to right, and can reverse percentages automatically?\n. Did you create your project yesterday by chance? The template stack was briefly missing autoprefixer, so Safari wouldn't have the -webkit prefixes it needs to work. Try pasting this code into your existing gulpfile.js, where the sass task is. It's from lines 72 to 83:\njs\ngulp.task('sass', function() {\n  return gulp.src('docs/assets/scss/app.scss')\n    .pipe(sass({\n      loadPath: ['scss'],\n      style: 'nested',\n      bundleExec: true\n    }))\n    .pipe(autoprefixer({\n      browsers: ['last 2 versions', 'ie 10']\n    }))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/assets/css/'));\n});\nProjects created now shouldn't have this problem.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Looks like the partial for the off-canvas plugin is missing. Check your build folder; do you see a folder called partials with a bunch of HTML files inside?\n. Scratch that, it was an issue with the Gulpfile. This pull request fixes the problem.\nIf you haven't made any changes to your Gulpfile, just paste in the fixed file and you'll be set.\n. I'm still learning Angular, but one thing I've been wondering is if it makes sense to write each module's template HTML in the JavaScript itself, instead of in a separate file. On the one hand, it would make integrating modules into your project easier, as you'd only need to copy on file, instead of two files from two different folders.\nOn the other hand, it becomes more of a hassle to maintain because all your HTML ends up in strings instead of a nice, easily-indentable HTML file.. What I don't know is if it's considered a bad practice like it is in jQuery, where it's considered a better idea to use native DOM manipulation ($(document.createElement())) or use a templating engine like Handlebars, than have jQuery parse an entire string into a DOM tree.\nTo be sure some of our components are more complex than others. Action sheets, tabs, and notifications probably have the most complex markup. Other components like panel and off-canvas are a single line of simple HTML.\n. @AntJanus That makes sense, I've worked with giant strings of HTML so I know it's not really a best practice. I'd be in favor of the folder approach, then, since that would better segment each directive as an actual plugin that you can choose to either import or not.\n. When I landed on this page I didn't realize it was a PR so I changed it myself :P And made a few formatting tweaks also. Thanks for catching it!\n. We're working on a fix to make the menu auto-close.\n. This has been fixed, but it also spawned this issue: #278\n. :+1:\n. I added it to the template repo also: cf139fc51fea7df85268c8b35425ab0014342d26\n. I'm working on it right now, but in the mean time, you can read the Sass file itself, which is very thoroughly documented.\n. And done! The grid page still needs further iteration, but the mixins are now documented.\n. Good catch, thanks!\n. Are you using our template stack or your own build process? See if js/vendor/iconic.min.js is being compiled into your JavaScript.\n. Yeah, it looks like the Gulpfile in our template stack is out of sync with what's in the docs. I'll make a few changes and then it will work.\n. Fixed that business with this commit on the template repo. You can either cut and paste the fixed Gulpfile into your existing project or create a new project with foundation-apps new project.\n. Thanks!\n. Definitely! We have a few ideas for this, maybe you can see about implementing.\n- Create a motion stagger mixin so people can set the timing of the stagger.\n- Put the ng-enter-stagger class in a variable so people can change it.\n- Create a few classes that use the mixin, like short-stagger or long-stagger.\n. Merged in #394.\n. Merged in #247 which implements this.\n. This is probably an issue with your build process; you'll need add a copy task to your Gruntfile or Gulpfile that copies everything from bower_components/foundation-apps/js/partials/ to build/partials/, where build is the name of your distribution folder.\n. Actually, we recently fixed an issue with the template's Gulpfile not properly copying the framework's partials. Try copying and pasting the new Gulpfile into your existing project, or make a new project with foundation-apps new appName and it should work.\nLet us know if you run into any issues!\n. Is there a way we can handle the dependencies without creating a separate repo? We handle our front-end dependencies through Bower, so we can't add them to this repo's package.json necessarily, unless there's a way we can have two package files in this repo\u2014one for compiling the documentation and one for people installing the package.\n. Foundation for Apps is now on npm as foundation-apps.\n. Thanks!\n. Since you can see the function call right there, it should be enough to be able to change the percentage value right in the function call (or scrap it entirely if you want to use a different color). Otherwise we'd need extra variables for every variable that used color scaling.\n. @AntJanus npm start should use the Gulp executable file inside the user's node_modules directory, which is why you don't need it installed globally (npm scripts check inside node_modules/.bin before the user's path). However, it seems like this sometimes doesn't work on people's machines for some reason.\n@erredeco Looking at that log file, the actual error would have been output in your command line. Could you try re-running the command and paste whatever comes up in the command line?\n. We're working on a fix to detect when the user has multiple servers running and warn them with a more friendly error.\n. Yep, we're pretty close. Although the fact that every tool in the chain (libsass, node-sass, and gulp-sass) is in active development is occasionally problematic. If one library in the chain breaks it will cause problems for our users. This came up a few times during development. Once, a minor patch of gulp-sass caused our build process to fail every time, so we had to lock it at a specific version number. libsass on Windows is also a little weird because node-sass will try to compile a new binary, which requires Visual Studio to be installed on the user's machine.\nThe Ruby version of Sass may be slow, but it's definitely more stable. Of course, over time that will likely become less of an issue, which is why we definitely want the codebase to be compatible with both flavors of Sass.\nBut just to get some clarity, do you think our template stack should not require Ruby? Because the framework in general technically doesn't require Ruby; you can use libsass also. Like I said, it's close, and it does compile, but I think a handful of minor functions output values incorrectly.\n. @ilanbiala Yep, I think that's what we would end up doing. Sass remained unchanged for so long we weren't used to having to manage our dependencies this carefully with Foundation 5 ;)\nA pure JS stack was our initial goal, so we'll get there soon enough.\nThe Visual Studio thing threw me for a loop though, I didn't know about it until a few months ago. From what I've learned, node-sass will try to install a pre-compiled binary on your machine (it has two for Windows, 32-bit and 64-bit), but if it fails, it will try to compile a new binary, and on Windows that requires Visual Studio to be installed.\nGranted, if you use Windows for web development you're probably used to having a more involved setup process, but ideally the CLI has as little overhead as possible to get going.\n. Closing this as libsass is definitely in the cards for us soon.\n. We're pushing out some updates this week. Specifically, once we get a 1.0.1 release out the door, we'll update the templates to have the new files.\n. We'll likely put out a minor patch this week, and when we do the templates will get a ton of bugfixes.\n. Thanks!\n. Looks like it was an issue with selector specificity; the is-active class was targeting other components inside the accordion. #259 should fix it.\n. Typically we don't want hover states to override active states, as the extra affordance isn't necessary. It's a relatively easy feature for individual developers to override if they want it, though.\n. Should be fixed with #258 and #300.\n. There may be cases where you want to force at least one tab in an accordion to stay open, so most likely we're going to introduce a new attribute to this directive that lets you adjust that setting. We just need to figure out what to call it.\n. If you use the two attributes (multi-open and collapsible) in any combination that would be good. And false should be the default for collapsible, so by default, there's always at least one open item in an accordion.\n. Thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. Are you using ui-sref to create links? That's how you make links with UI Router, not using href.\nIf you have a view called \"about\":\n```\nname: about\nurl: /about\n\n```\nLink to it using this code:\nhtml\n<a ui-sref=\"about\">About</a>\n. @tomasbana After reading your comment more closely, I realized you're clicking the example links in the starter template. Those are deliberately not functional, but we could take the href=\"#\" out of the menu items so that error doesn't come up.\n. No they aren't, and I'm not sure how that happened. We'll get it fixed shortly.\n. Alright, we updated the panel documentation to be more detailed. It's been deployed to the live site\u2014enjoy!\n. Any version of Ruby that supports Bundler and Sass will be fine, but I'm not sure what the minimum version would be, so we'll look into it.\n. Looks like they're both 1.8.7, so we can make a note of it. We won't likely get into the nuance of managing Ruby versions in our documentation, because the user doesn't need to write any Ruby to work with our template stack; Ruby just needs to work. If you're incorporating our codebase into your own stack, you're probably savvy enough to handle the dependency stuff yourself.\n. Yes, that's how it should be. We've already fixed that issue in the template's gulpfile, so new projects won't have this issue.\n. The data still has to be serialized somehow in the Sass to get it to the JavaScript, but to be sure maybe trying to format it as actual JSON isn't the best idea. Ruby Sass has an inspect() function, which will create a string representation of any data type, but it isn't in libsass yet. So there's no way to natively serialize a map in libsass for now, which is why I wrote this function.\nSince this function is basically just to transmit a list of basic key/value pairs (always a string paired with another string), it doesn't necessarily need to be output as actual JSON; it could have been something closer to a CSV.\n@AntJanus was able to work out the cross-browser quirks with parsing the JSON, but libsass does mess it up because it outputs with different quotes. libsass support is a short-term goal, so we'll probably need to revisit how we pass these media queries around then.\nI don't see us dropping Ruby Sass until the two libraries are totally in sync, and when that happens we won't necessarily need to drop one or the other, because they should work the same. Ruby Sass is still the \"canonical\" version.\n. I like this idea, since & and = can't be in the keys or values, which means you can easily split the string by those characters. I'll put this in a branch and @AntJanus can finish the implementation on the JS end.\nEdit: Oh, sorry, I didn't realize you already did it for us :) We'll just make sure this works cross-browser then.\n. A null link will generate an Angular error.\nTo make it easy, I just brute-forced it and used the live URL of the link, like all the other links. 7baa963d8070fc5715c3c4de48eacaa21aa3f106\n. @wtfribley Yep, the dream was to have a purely CSS-positioned dropdown, but it opens you up to a few weird issues.\nTether is a really nice plugin, but it has one blind spot that's unique to our situation: it doesn't work great with elements inside multiple scrolling containers. This is critical for us, with the way our grid system works.\nAlso, from what I can tell, it would be difficult to add custom animation to Tether elements, because they're positioned with a transform. With Tether using that property, we can't override it to do any animation in and out. That's not super critical, though, since for popups having a fade in and out is probably good enough for now.\n. I'll sidestep the issue for now by just center-aligning the demo button.\nThere's a few more things we'd like to do with Tether, like creating a generic pin directive to attach any element to any other element, but that's farther down the road. We'll need to figure out how to better make Tether work with our stuff. At that point we'd probably just make the action sheet use that same code, and then it would be way more flexible.\n. Ah, that's because the grid elements inside the modal only have left and right padding. The bottommost element of each modal has a bottom margin, which is what creates that extra space. We'll update our examples to look better.\n. Looks like it's failing on the git clone step; do you have Git installed on your machine and a git command in your path?\n. It's written in the readme that you need it, but we should probably still add a warning when that error comes up. Never hurts to streamline things!\n. This is the change that introduced the issue: d1ce6aa6e9b6c4e544ba9a0a14cb3518f174d630\nThe intent was to have links in panels close the panels when you click on them, so we'll need to rework the directive slightly.\nMaybe that code should only be in our documentation-specific JS? That's why it was added, to close our nav menu when you click on something.\n. Yep, panels and off-canvas menus are meant to be totally general-purpose.\n. Yep, we can definitely look into it.\n. Are you building the documentation (this repo) or the template stack? And is there any other output in the command line you can paste?\n. Do you use JRuby? I did some research and it sounds like this is an issue with that. Another Apps user had this problem and was able to solve it by downgrading to version 1.7.15 of JRuby.\n. This is a side request, but since you're working on the refactor I'll ask: is it possible to grab the breakpoint list through a service or something? We have the code to grab them from the Sass for Interchange to use, but we had a request to make that list something you can access from anywhere. It might already be in there but I'm not sure.\n. Waiting until later makes sense I'd say.\n. Yep, 1.1 should be out before we're gone for the holidays.\n. @jaysonminard This refactor has been in place since 1.0.2. A big thing to put in a patch number, yes, but it was very early in the framework's life, and we needed it out anyway. We're putting out 1.1 tomorrow most likely.\n. There's another Webkit-specific option called -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d. Is there an example I can test this on?\n. Ah okay, no problem. There's a few things we need to make more clear in the documentation, like how a prefixing tool is required.\nCurious, did you make a Grunt version of our Gulp plugin that generates routes?\n. Well if you ever have time to put together a clean scaffold that uses Grunt instead of Gulp, throw it up on GitHub and we can link to it on our resources page.\n. Thanks, the Less detection was really confusing.\n. Yep, we need to look into it, I noticed the same issue with modals.\n. @AntJanus Looking at index.html, there are two example modals, both with overlay=\"false\", but an overlay still appears on the first one, #mainModal.\n. @AntJanus Ah okay, I guess I assumed that you could turn on and off clicking to close outside of a modal, independent of if the modal has a visible overlay or not. We don't need to change that right now, though.\n. This commit swaps the defaults for the modal parameters. Now by default, modals will have an overlay and clicking the overlay will close it. These two properties can be independently overridden with overlay=\"false\" and overlay-close=\"false\".\n. We haven't worked out all of the kinks with libsass quite yet, but we're working on it. Is there any more to the error you got or is that it?\n. Alright, we'll do some testing.\n. Are you importing the settings file before the main framework files? I think it's trying to find a variable called $include-css that's in _settings.scss.\n. Yep, that was the issue. We'll make sure to include the settings file in the Bower package in a future update.\nWe're also working on better documentation on how to use Foundation for Apps as a dependency.\n. How does removing the dot change the logic?\n. Ah, I see. So all of our globs shouldn't lead with ./?\n. We had this issue with panels as well, and solved it by removing the hardcoded transitions from the panel Sass, and instead having the directive automatically add a default animation. So we can do the same thing for notifications, where it just picks a good default based on the position (e.g., a top-right notification will slide in from the right).\n. @AntJanus Ah, well that actually sounds fine as a default. I can just remove the hard-coded transform on notifications (they're positioned with position: absolute and aligned with negative margins so it'll be good), allowing the motion classes to take over.\n. Our original plan was to put is-active in a variable, so you could change the active class on the entire framework, but do you think each component's specific active class should be customizable as well?\n. Right, I wasn't going to implement that until we had it working on the JS end too. But people like being able to change any class name we set, so we should look into it. It could be another parameter we serialize into that meta tag. Maybe we can set that up in 1.1.\n. You can reset the change and then force push the branch back to GitHub. Messy, yes, but it works. Just copy the text of the file you changed first so you don't lose it.\ngit reset --hard aca168f0b825d50dfbc13e0b3dc9bb0169f5c69f\ngit push origin master --force\nThat will overwrite your fork's master branch so it doesn't have that last commit.\nAnd to be sure, I would _never_ recommend force pushing to the main repo's master branch ;)\nEdit: Your other option is to run revert on the commit, but that creates a new commit that says \"I reverted this other one\".\n. Closing this, as we're instead going to change is-active on every component to be referenced by a variable.\n. The CLI is trying to find the bundle command. You should have Ruby on your machine, so run gem install bundler and then try again.\n. Hm, we'll look into it. Either way, if it got that far your project is fine. Just run bundle inside your project and it will be finished.\n. @cshenry13 Do you mean the contents of the new app's folder is empty?\n. Hm, that would suggest the git clone failed, but it should have tossed an error of some kind.\nCould you try running git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template.git myApp and see if it works? That's the exact command the CLI is running to initially set up the project.\nBy the way, we're working on a big update to the CLI which will drastically improve error-handling, so working through these errors is super helpful :)\nEdit: And for reference, this is the entire manual install process:\ngit clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template.git myApp\ncd myApp\nnpm install\nbower install\nbundle\nnpm start\n. Alright, looks like it's an issue with your machine's Git installation then. If you Google that error there are a few Stack Overflow discussions with possible fixes.\n. @iamontheinet @bclinkinbeard Have y'alls had the time to figure out the issue with your installs? One possibility is that Bundler is failing because it needs admin privileges. So if it fails on line 141 again, try running bundle manually, and if that fails, run sudo bundle instead. Some environments require admin privileges to install gems.\n. @anevaude Strange, do you see the steps underneath \"Installing dependencies...\", like npm => bower => bundler?\nnpm install would be the first command it's running, so it must be freezing there.\n. @spsaucier Ah yeah, that would be an issue. We should be able to force each install command to be non-interactive.\nWhen you did a manual install, did you ever need to use sudo?\n. @spsaucier Hmm, well maybe Bower was the only issue. Did you get hangups in any other step of the process when using foundation-apps new, like the npm step?\n. @spsaucier Hm, alrighty then. We're working on some upgrades to the CLI, the last thing we're doing is some Windows testing. I'll add a note to make NPM and Bower noninteractive.\n. Awesome! Happy to help. :)\n. Looks good, so if you write @include breakpoint(xxlarge only) and xxlarge is the last breakpoint in your list, the output should just be @media screen and (min-width: 120em), right?\nEdit: Tested myself, indeed that's what it does. Thanks!\n. We're in talks with a CDN right now; the plan is to try and get something up tomorrow, after we tag a 1.0.1 release.\n. #463 addresses this. We'd like it in the codebase for version 1.1.\n. What browser and OS are you seeing it in?\n. @AntJanus That sounds good, since the user doesn't really need to interact with an element while it's moving anyway. You could add that class to the motion of _motion.scss.\n. Relative positioning is necessary to position a panel, because they use position: absolute. That doesn't mean every block needs relative positioning though, as that would cause weird issues.\n. This is an older issue, but we think it's been resolved, partially through moving the HTML of the panels to the right position in the markup: 6aed7d5e654daa5a11e82a89f59ebd406c49e2a1\nIf you want panels to overlap a grid element, the panels should be siblings of the grid block, not inside the grid block. This was causing a flicker on some platforms; I saw it on iOS specifically before this fix.\nIf you see anything else odd let us know.\n. #312 should fix this; it was an issue with the capitalization of folders.\n. We just fixed the capitalization issue with the docs folder (#312) so this shouldn't be a problem anymore. You may need to delete your repo and re-clone it, though.\n. Go for it! I'll make sure everyone sitting around me knows :)\n. @mrsafraz It doesn't, all of the Apps-specific stuff is in the same package for now.\nWe've had some internal conversations about this, and if we decide to segment the libraries it likely won't be until a version 2. Mainly we'd need to know that there's a group of folks willing to dedicate time to maintaining ports of the framework, so we could potentially have versions for Angular, Ember, Durandal, etc. That will give us extra incentive to split our codebase in two.\nFor now, we just recommend folks include the Bower package and ignore the JavaScript files in there. Where we can we'll see about keeping the Sass flexible enough to work with other frameworks.\n. @mrsafraz When you have something good to show, put it on GitHub and we can feature it! We're looking to promote ports of the framework to other SPA tools.\n. @mrsafraz Those view animations are super slick. That's something built into Durandal?\n. Ah okay. Just in general though the act of view transitioning seems to work really well. UI Router doesn't really do it out of the box, and we've had a lot of... fun trying to make it work without any visual bugs.\n. So from the Sass end, the main hassle is getting the codebase to where it supports the ng-enter-style transitions and the class-based transitions, ideally without a ton of code bloat. Each style has a setup class and a transition class, but they don't work the same.\nWith ng-enter, you define the transition on the setup class; with *-add, you define the transition on the finishing class. So it's not as easy as just adding a comma to insert support for -add and -add-active, but I think there's still a way.\n. @stryju We won't need to change any styles, really, just class output, but that's what's tricky. Ideally we don't have to refactor the Sass a ton. Although i guess there are only five transition mixins right now.\n. Alright, here's roughly what the Sass would look like. And I think that's properly following the unique rules of both animation styles.\n- ng-enter gets transition definitions and the \"before\" state.\n- ng-enter-active gets the \"after\" state.\n- *-add gets a 0s transition and the \"before\" state.\n- *-add-active gets transition definitions and the \"after\" state.\nThe final code would use @content instead of @extend.\n. @AntJanus You can use this code which has an example fadeIn that should work with ng-enter and -add. What I wasn't sure about is if there's an opposite of -add, or if you use -add in both directions, in and out.\n. Yep, that should be a font-size property, good catch.\n. I think that's an issue with Autoprefixer, but I'm not getting the same error on a fresh clone. We'll look into it, though.\n. A few of us have been getting intermittent errors with Autoprefixer. Sometimes Autoprefixer tries to parse raw Sass files instead of compiled CSS, and if it does it'll freak out.\nMaybe it happens if Sass encounters an error, so instead of piping CSS to Autoprefixer it pipes Sass files? I'm not totally sure how that specific plugin works.\nEither way, if you keep having issues let us know. At the moment we aren't seeing any errors with compiling the docs.\n. @etcook This is a fun bug. Go into the Gulpfile and comment out the lines that run Autoprefixer.\njs\n// Compile stylesheets with Ruby Sass\ngulp.task('sass', function() {\n  return sass('docs/assets/scss/', {\n      loadPath: ['scss'],\n      style: 'nested',\n      bundleExec: true\n    })\n    .on('error', function(err) {\n      console.log(err.message);\n    })\n    // .pipe(autoprefixer({\n    //   browsers: ['last 2 versions', 'ie 10']\n    // }))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/assets/css/'));\n});\nNow run npm start and let it compile\u2014it will run fine. Now quit the process, uncomment those lines, and run npm start again. It will magically work this time. We're not really sure why.\n. @etcook I think it's an issue with Sass sourcemap files being piped to the autoprefixer() function, but I'm not sure why it only sometimes happens.\n. The primary class is just for color scheming (it uses the $primary-color variable as a base), it doesn't mean \"primary\" as in \"main\". Also, in this case, there shouldn't be any classes in the mixin itself, only in the CSS output at the bottom.\nIt was sort of a coin toss for us if menu bar should have a bottom margin or not. There are plenty of cases where you don't want a margin on it, like if it's being used as a toolbar, but if it's being used inline, or in a sidebar with more content, you'd want that spacing at the bottom. We could look again at just making it margin: 0 by default.\n. If you're using the most recent build of the template stack, which defines all import paths near the top of the file, you can fix this by swapping the two paths in the sassPaths variable so they look like this:\nscss\n// Line 26\nvar sassPaths = [\n  'client/assets/scss',\n  'bower_components/foundation-apps/scss'\n];\nThis will grab the _settings.scss in your client folder instead of bower_components. I made the change in the template stack as well.\nThe next version of the CLI will automatically copy the settings file out of the Bower package into your client folder when a new project is made.\n. This change to the detached off-canvas mixin should fix the issue:\n``` scss\n@mixin off-canvas-detached {\n  z-index: 0;\n  box-shadow: none;\n  // Hide the menu when it's not active\n  display: none;\n&, &.is-active {\n    transform: none;\n    // Show the menu when it's active\n    display: block;\n  }\n& ~ #{$offcanvas-frame-selector} {\n    z-index: 1;\n    box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);\n  }\n}\n```\nI tried adding the detached class to one of the sample off-canvas menus in the docs, but the is-active class was always there for some reason, even when the menu wasn't supposed to be open.\n. Actually, the method above should work, but slightly different.\nThe issue is that a detached off-canvas doesn't hide off the screen when it isn't active; it just sits there. This means if you open a different off-canvas on another side of the screen, you'll see that first detached menu just sitting there. We don't want that.\nI tried making the detached menu display: none, and then switching to display: block when it's active. This sort of works, because it means the detached menu is hidden until it's made active, and since it doesn't ever animate, flipping from none to block instantly is okay.\nHowever, when you go to close the detached menu, it disappears instantly. This is because the is-active class is being removed as the app frame starts to slide back into place.\nThere's probably a few ways to solve the problem, but it would need to happen with JavaScript. There's two ways I can think to do it:\n- When a detached off-canvas menu is closing, wait until the grid-frame is done transitioning to hide the menu.\n- When an off-canvas menu is open, force all the others to hide.\n. Actually again, @jeaniec and I were working on a JS-based solution when we came up with something simpler: just make the z-index of detached menus lower than the others. That covers them up. Problem solved!\n. Closing in favor of #386.\n. Far easier said than done :) We don't currently have any plans to port Foundation for Apps to other JavaScript frameworks, but we'll certainly support anyone in the community who wants to write a port.\nIt's also possible to use Angular and Meteor in tandem, so there's probably a way to put Meteor on top of our code, instead of actually porting everything.\n. Ah, the functions aren't yet imported when the settings file is being processed. We'll put in a fix, but you can work around it for now by importing the functions file before your settings file:\nscss\n@import \"helpers/functions\";\n@import \"settings\";\n@import \"foundation\";\n. This commit fixes the issue: 339f164ea4ac030ad4dd12dfbe2c02085e7b83df\n. We replaced the string interpolation with a mixin. It works like this:\n``` scss\n@include breakpoint(medium) {\n  / ... /\n}\n@include breakpoint(large only) {\n  / ... /\n}\n```\nThe list of breakpoints are in the $breakpoints variable in your settings file. This mixin will also take pixel and em values as well.\nscss\n@include breakpoint(200px) {\n  /* ... */\n}\n. Very good point. I went ahead and replaced the href attributes with ui-sref, to emphasize that it's the actual way links are written when using Angular + UI Router.\nWe won't add more pages most likely, because the template stack should be as stripped down as possible. If you had pages for about, news, contact, etc., you'd just end up deleting or renaming them for every new project.\n. Hey, sorry for getting to this late. We definitely want to start using the template cache, since we're already running into problems with the hardcoded template paths we have, and it would also just make distributing our code easier.\nWe're trying to get 1.0.3 out the door today, but it would be nice to have this functionality in place for our next version, which will probably be 1.1. 1.0.3 will introduce a dist folder into the Bower package which has compiled CSS and JavaScript. For future versions it would make sense for the templates file to be in there as well.\nSince the Gulpfile has been refactored quite a bit recently, would you like to re-do your PR against the new codebase? And thanks for your work! :)\n. Awesome, thank you. You'll see that the new Gulpfile has a task called deploy:dist, which generates compiled assets for Bower and npm.\n. Sounds like we can keep the functionality as it is, but add information about the directive to the documentation.\n. Yep, looks like $small-font-color wasn't being applied to the small selector.\n. We made the call to not include radius and rounded classes in Foundation for Apps, and it's possible we'll do the same thing for version 6 of Foundation for Sites. It does make it look like the two frameworks are out of sync in some ways, but Foundation 5 is also more than a year old, so there were plenty of new ideas we've had that are being implemented first here, and eventually will with Sites as well.\nThe reason we got rid of the radius and rounded classes is because they serve a purpose better filled by Sass. Most components, including buttons, have a border radius variable, which allows you to globally modify the radius on that component. This is a much easier and more sustainable approach than adding radius and rounded to every button. Coloring and sizing also change the meaning and purpose of your buttons; the border radius tends to be just a stylistic choice.\n. The standalone framework files (all Sass, JS, and Iconic assets) are distributed through Bower and NPM. If you want to use our components in a Rails project, you'll want to add the framework to your asset pipeline. There are a few tools that connect Bower and Rails, including rails-assets and bower-rails.\n. Sorry, I know this is an older issue, but the markup for this panel is incorrect. Panels should never go inside .grid-content elements; they should always anchor to a .grid-block element instead. This means a panel and the content it overlaps are sibling elements in the DOM.\nHere's how to fix your example:\nhtml\n<div class='grid-block'>\n  <!-- Moved the panel up one level -->\n  <zf-panel id='bp' position='bottom'>\n    <a zf-close='' class='close-button'>&times;</a>\n    panel content\n  </zf-panel>\n  <!-- The sidebar and main content are siblings of the panel -->\n  <div class='grid-content'>sidebar</div>\n  <div class='small-8 grid-content'>\n    <a class='button' zf-toggle='bp'>Panel</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\nI added a section to the panel documentation that clarifies this rule.\n. @mikehuebner Yep, that's it! To expand on what @AntJanus said, Gulp, Grunt, et al. are build tools that are meant to be run in a development environment only, and are primarily used to deliver static code. The servers that you can run with Gulp and Grunt (and even frameworks like Django and Rails) are meant for convenience and testing only, not production.\nYou could automate this process in Gulp by creating a deployment task that uses rsync, FTP, SSH, etc. to upload the build folder for you. We do this to deploy the documentation.\n. We have a refactor of the animation libraries in progress (#386) so we'll make sure this issue is covered there.\n. We merged in #386, which does address the scenario where the user clicks to another state mid-transition. The other two states will disappear, and the new one will animate in.\nThese changes will be in for version 1.1 of the framework, which we're hoping to have out by the end of the week.\n. Try running npm start build manually in your command line and see if that works. Occasionally we've had issues where, for some reason, the user's machine freaks out if you add more arguments after npm start.\n. Yep, it looks like version 2.0.0 of npm introduced that change. I added a remark to the Install & Update page advising users to update their system's npm if they aren't installing a new copy of Node.\n. Awesome, glad to hear it!\n. You shouldn't have to copy those files yourself out of bower_components; Gulp does that for you. However, there was an issue with the template stack's Gulpfile not properly copying HTML partials. This pull request fixed the problem; if you look at how the Gulpfile was changed, you can fix the issue in your project.\n. The first issue is one of selector specificity, so adding a bunch of >s should help, and won't break any existing code. We had this issue with another component where is-active was cascading down too far.\n. Going to close this, if the problem still persists let us know. :)\n. It's a known issue with Orbit, our slider plugin that comes with Foundation 5.\n. @AntJanus We can take a look on our end. As for the height thing, in most cases, the view will be a flex child, which means its width and height are automatically calculated. The whole point of this framework is that it's responsive, so if you're setting a fixed height you're probably gonna have a bad time. Although I could see people using for nested views.\n. I pushed a small update to the CSS for transitioning views, and it seems to work pretty well, although I didn't test it extensively. If you pull down the branch and click between the Install/Update and Sass pages, you can see it working.\nI'm not sure if these updates cover it, but the module needs to account for any combination of views missing and in/out animation. Like this:\n| Old View | New View | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| has out | has in | Both animate at the same time |\n| has out | no in | New view immediately appears, old view animates out |\n|  |  | Old view gets higher z-index |\n| no out | has in | New view animates in, old view immediately disappears |\n|  |  | New view gets higher z-index |\n| no out | no in | Both swap immediately |\nIn the last use case, the module shouldn't do any of this logic, like adding position: absolute classes and so on. That should all be bypassed so the views animate immediately. It seems like right now there's a small delay because all of the same stuff is happening even though it's not needed.\n. Just hacked together a basic test app for the motion stuff. It has four views, which have every possible combination of in/out animations, so you can test, say, what happens if an exiting view has an out animation, but the new view has no in animation. Run gulp test:motion to turn it on.\n. If you're adding the components to your own stack, you need to make sure the HTML templates for each directive are being picked up by Angular. In our template stack, we copy the partials from bower_components/foundation-apps/js/angular/components/**/*.html to build/components.\n. Going to close this, let me know if the above was able to solve your issue, or if you still have problems.\n. @gjungb @zavan Yep, until we have a templates JavaScript file in a stable version, you'll have to use a task runner to pull the templates out of the framework files. Below is an example of using the ng-html2js library with Gulp. There's a Grunt version of the plugin as well.\njs\nvar partials = gulp.src('bower_components/js/angular/components/**/*.html')\n  .pipe($.ngHtml2js({\n    prefix: 'components/',\n    moduleName: 'foundation',\n    declareModule: false\n  }))\n  .pipe($.concat('templates.js'))\n  .pipe($.uglify())\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/js'));\n. @zavan Glad to hear it! If you make anything interesting with it, let us know. We're building some stuff internally (even for clients now!) so we're learning a lot about how fully-responsive web apps would work. and we'd love to hear what design/technical challenges other developers are running into.\n. Nice! We'd like to see this functionality added for notifications too, if possible. Right now there are programmatic notifications, but you need an empty element with the zf-notification-set directive to make them work.\n. :+1: Awesome! We'll take a look!\n. Looks good! A few comments:\n- All three of the stagger mixins could likely be combined into one, unless you think there's a chance any of the three would be used in another context. But as it is they're fairly tightly coupled anyway.\n- It may not be necessary to call stagger() inside each motion mixin, as the stagger functionality exists independent of whatever motion is happening. Instead you could call stagger() three times at the bottom of the file where all the CSS classes are, once for each stagger length.\n. Awesome work, James! :) We can include it in version 1.1.\n. Merge'd. 9fc2f16721ed47a19a919c6ae0565d0d633a575d\n. The classes that apply those visual styles to the grid examples were overriding the offset class, so I fixed that. The actual grid won't have that issue under normal circumstances.\n. This error doesn't seem to be cropping up anymore, but if you have any more issues compiling the docs locally, let us know.\n. This is the intended behavior, although you could make the case that it doesn't need to be full height. Full width seems sensible, however. Modals are kind of like grid rows in that they have a max width.\n. This commit adds a .dialog class which turns off the full-bleed functionality of mobile modals.\n. As a temporary workaround, you can comment out the uglify step of the JavaScript build process. It's in the uglify task in Gulpfile.js:\njs\ngulp.src(foundationJS)\n    // .pipe(uglify({\n    //   beautify: true,\n    //   mangle: false\n    // }).on('error', function(e) {\n    //   console.log(e);\n    // }))\n    .pipe(concat('foundation.js'))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/assets/js/'))\n  ;\nBut, we can look into modifying the Gulpfile to have separate processes for development and production. I'll add it to our internal roadmap.\n. You might be interested in gulp-if, which can conditionally run files through a pipe. So only pipe to uglify() if production = true or something like that.\n. @etcook Oh! Sorry about that, skipped right over it when I loaded the page. But yes, we'd be interested in seeing what that would look like. A production flag should compress the Sass as well, while keeping it expanded while in development. The flag should probably be false by default, so that when you download the template you're already in development mode.\n. Just got this implemented in the template project, using the code @etcook wrote. Check it out!\nAdding the --production flag to gulp or gulp build will enable compressed mode in node-sass, and Uglify for JavaScript.\n. Right when the framework launched we were seeing a bizarre bug in just IE10/11 where, when autoscroll was on the view container, the entire left-hand sidebar was misaligned. And when you took it off, everything went back to normal.\nBut I tried adding the attribute back and everything works fine now. Not sure what that was! So we can definitely merge this.\n. We closed out the PR related to this issue last week; you can read my comment on why we closed it. Basically we're trying to keep the template stack as slim on features as possible, to reduce the number of moving parts. It's meant to be a baseline that more experienced users can build on.\n. No, pedantry is great :) Thanks for catching it!\n. Good catch, they should all be singular.\n. The issue is trying to interconnect the components when you don't know what the class names could be. Because we allow the user to write their own class names with the mixins, you don't know if that button will actually be .button, or .custom-button-class or something else.\nIn this specific case, it's probably fine to modify the selector to also look for input[type=\"submit\"], input[type=\"button\"], and button as well, because the use case of the .inline-label element is very specific\u2014it's meant for inputs, buttons, labels, and nothing else.\n. Yeah, button groups would need updating, and there may be a few other edge cases as well. Foundation 5 has a few blind spots like that actually. It's really hard sometimes to combine UI components when you don't know what their class name is ;)\nIconic is a unique case because the JavaScript always adds the .iconic class, so we don't have to worry about that one changing.\n. You can use any existing Angular library with Foundation for Apps. As you've figured out, normal JavaScript libraries don't work because single-page app frameworks are always swapping in and out HTML. Most plugins are designed to be initialized once, when the page loads and all the HTML is assumed to be there.\nThe Angular UI project has a lot of good libraries, including a Google Maps one you may be interested in.\n. The CSS classes are written to use Angular's animation module. So to make the animations work, you either need to use a directive that supports animation (like ng-show, ng-repeat, etc.) or use the $animate service to trigger them yourself.\n. @saviour123 There aren't any tutorials that I know of specifically about Foundation for Apps's motion library, but our documentation does a good job of explaining all of the key pieces: directive/view animation and using the Sass mixins.\nEventually the new Motion UI library will be plugged into this one. We'll likely do that at 1.2 and then remove the existing transition mixins for 1.3.\n. Closing in favor of #417.\n. Take a look at this CSS Tricks article, which gets into a few methods for restarting animations. The two solutions it references are:\n1. Remove the animation class, force a reflow, and then re-add the class. If you just remove the class and then immediately re-add it, the browser doesn't perceive it as an actual change in state. There are a few ways to do this\u2014the one referenced in the article is element.offsetWidth = element.offsetWidth;.\n2. Reset the play state. The CSS property is called animation-play-state, and the JavaScript version is animationPlayState. Change it to paused, and then immediately change it to running, and the animation will play again. Of course, the property is vendor prefixed, so you'll need to modify webkitAnimationPlayState and so on.\nHope that helps!\n. There is an infinite class you can apply to an animating element, and that will make the animation play forever. It seemed like your use case, though, was needing to get the animation to play again at some point. But, if you just need the animation to play forever without stopping, you can just add the class infinite.\n. Merged #421 which fixes this.\n. Like the others have said, this doesn't seem to be an issue with our Bower package. Stack Overflow or Super User should be better equipped to help you :)\n. The template stack doesn't come with any unit tests; are you writing your own?\n. Hm, could you post the tests you've written?\n. Thanks for the repo link; taking a look at this today.\n. Well, I got a totally different set of errors when I tried to run the tests, but either way I think I might know the problem.\nWhen the Sass is compiled to CSS, it drops the media query list into a property with a meta selector. The JavaScript then injects a <meta> tag with the same class and parses the value. If the test suite doesn't have a finished CSS file to reference, it can't read those values, which is why the mediaQueries object comes up null.\n. You'd need to compile the Sass files to CSS so that the test browser can see them.\nThis is the error I get. I think it's happening because the Gulp plugin that generates routes isn't being run, so the foundationRoutes variable is never being created.\nChrome 40.0.2214 (Mac OS X 10.10.1) AboutController should create \"phones\" model with 3 phones FAILED\n    Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module wxPortal due to:\n    Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module foundation.dynamicRouting due to:\n    ReferenceError: foundationRoutes is not defined\n. If needed, you can also get away with less than that. This is the only line you need:\ncss\nmeta.foundation-mq {\n  font-family: \"small=0&medium=40rem&large=75rem&xlarge=90rem&xxlarge=120rem\"; }\nThis style could also be added programmatically before Foundation initializes, using the CSSStyleSheet.insertRule() method.\n. True that; if you want to put HTML examples in a <code> element, you need to escape the angle brackets. So <div> becomes &lt;div&gt;.\nFor code blocks, our documentation uses an Angular port of highlight.js. It handles the escaping and syntax highlighting for us.\n. 1.0.2 is the newest version of the framework. We're looking to put another version out next week.\n. We can add those missing files to the bower.json. Should that property also include every Sass file?\n. @joshuajohnson814 I agree, and in fact it shouldn't be there anymore. Our documentation uses a different entry file, and the template stack also uses it's own. If you're incorporating the source files into your own build process, that file is unnecessary, although it does serve as a useful template.\nAs for including distribution files, we can look at it for the next patch. We're considering including a dist folder on the same repo, for this and perhaps also Foundation for Sites, to avoid the hassle of having a separate repo just for the Bower install.\n. @joshuajohnson814 The main issue we've had with the file is that some folks assumed it was a module to be included as a dependency, when it's just meant to be boilerplate. Also, since it's in the bower_components folder, which means it probably isn't in version control, you can't edit it.\nBut we haven't heard anything recently, so we can let it sit for now :)\n. So for JavaScript you just add every file, but how does it work with Sass files? I was looking at wiredep (which is what @laurent-le-graverend is using) but I couldn't figure out exactly how it works with Sass. Since Sass files are pre-compiled, it's not like you're concatenating them all together; you just need an import path. So I'm wondering if the main property of bower.json needs every Sass file or just the entry point.\n. I see, so it's not for source files. Thanks! We'll set up a dist folder for the next patch.\n. Alright, this commit adds a Gulp task to create a dist folder with minified and un-minified CSS and JS: e6aab4e097abafce1ccce6586f0bd5d7726dde97\nAnd this commit is me forgetting to update the main entry in bower.json ;) f5e33b0d3abf8d3817555c7b5a7361902794f1a7\nWe're trying to put out 1.0.3 this week, which will be the first version with the dist folder.\n. @joshuajohnson814 Ah, okay. In that case, what would be the best way to package the other dependencies for distribution? Maybe just bundle all of the external libraries into one file?\nObviously wiredep helps with this dependency resolution, but not everyone will be using that. Some folks will just want to drop in finished files to get going.\n. @laurent-le-graverend The way you described module loading already works with our current file structure. Originally you had to add each UI component's module separately, but in version 1.0.2 we added a foundation module which is just a shorthand for all of the UI components.\nBut as far as the compilation step, it sounds like the dist file should just be our framework files, and not any of the five or so libraries we rely on. So we'll make that change. (This also brings into stark relief how many dependencies this library has right now. Maybe for version 2 we'll look at separating modules that have dependencies, like our touch stuff.)\nAs far as using template caching, we've gotten that request before, so we'll look into it.\n. Merged in #433 which addresses this. Thanks for your help, friends!\n. Material Design is a very opinionated style guide, which is good for what it's doing, but it's not the role of our framework to make all of those decisions related to layout, hierarchy, and styling. Because of that, we won't be skinning any of the Foundation frameworks to look like Material.\nHowever, if you would like to write a Material theme and open source it, we can promote it for you :)\n. Definitely, we need this functionality for off-canvas and panels.\n. @maxcook We'd like to do this and the darkened overlay, but we haven't done any work on it yet. We'd certainly welcome a pull request if anyone wants to take a crack at it.\n@soumak77 We have zfClosable, would it be possible to bake any hooks into that?\n. What you're thinking of is the template stack, which is a separate repo. However, we're trying to keep the build process on that thing as slim as possible, or at least as slim as a complete build process can be. With that in mind, we don't want to add any more plugins to that thing at the moment.\nThat being said, this repo would certainly benefit from having linters to check the Sass and JavaScript. I started fixing up the Sass to conform to one standard, but I haven't finished it yet.\n. @escapedcat Right now we don't have a good way to update the Gulpfile. The problem is, if you've changed it at all, how are we supposed to effectively update it? The hope was to get the framework and stack to the point that we don't need to update the Gulpfile for a while.\nThis template is significantly more complex than the ones we use for Foundation 5, but for better or worse it kinda has to be.\nIf a patch ever mandates a change in the Gulpfile (which we'll try hard to avoid going forward), the changelog will include instructions on how to update an existing project.\n. Hey, thanks for putting this together. One issue is that we're deploying files to a CDN for use in CodePens and such, and those files should probably include all of the JavaScript in one big file, while the dist folder should be just the framework files. I can implement that myself, though.\n. After doing some research, we found that the solution might have to be iPad-specific CSS that uses calc() to cut those extra pixels off the height of the grid frame. So, hooray for user agent sniffing?\n. #456 could solve this, basically using height: 100% instead of height: 100vh to size things. It needs more testing, though.\n. I've got a new PR open (#603) which appears to be a better solution.\nWe will make iOS play nice with web apps.\n. Last solution, promise! bc01826c7bd1eb8e4ed6fb3bf293fcb0aebcaf9f fixes this issue. Tested in iOS 7 and 8 on the iPhone and iPad, and it works great.\n. Could you use the plain justify-content property instead? Using a grid mixin here means the menu bar would have a dependency on the grid component, and ideally no component is dependent on another (unless it's a sub-component, like button group).\n. Ah yeah, it's a typo in the node-sass task. Changing this line of the code will fix it. autoprefixer should be $.autoprefixer.\n. Thanks for making the changes. :)\n. As of Firefox 35 this doesn't appear to be an issue anymore. Since Firefox auto-updates, this shouldn't be a huge problem.\n. Alright, fixed it by converting the hex value to an RGB one on the fly.\n. Do these sorts of techniques negatively affect the cascade at all?\n. In theory any of the basic Sites components that don't require any JavaScript will work just fine, since it's just CSS. There's also an Angular library for the Foundation 5 JS plugins, written as Angular directives.\nBut yeah, we're definitely looking into ways to make the components more consistent between the two frameworks.\n. Obviously components with the same names conflict (labels, tabs, etc.), but there is one example of a component with the same name but two very different purposes in the two frameworks: panels. In Sites, .panel is just a colored box, but in Apps, it's the off-canvas component.\nTo get around this, we're looking for a name to replace \"panel\" in the next version of Sites. It's probably going to be \"callout\", since we're also combining panels and alerts into one CSS component.\n. Containers should be nested inside content blocks. Using your existing code, I can just swap out the first grid-block and make it grid-content instead. The two are totally interchangeable.\nhtml\n<body>\n<div class=\"grid-frame vertical\">\n  <div class=\"grid-content\" style=\"background-color: green;\">\n    <div class=\"grid-container\">\n      <div class=\"grid-block\" style=\"background-color: yellow;\">\n        Yellow\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"grid-block\" style=\"background-color: blue;\">\n        Blue\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"grid-block\" style=\"background-color: black;\">\n    <div class=\"grid-container\">\n      <div class=\"grid-block\" style=\"background-color: yellow;\">\n        Yellow\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"grid-block\" style=\"background-color: blue;\">\n        Blue\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\nSince grid-block is a flex container, it's children don't behave like normal flow content. grid-content is not a flex container, which means its children will function normally. grid-container is just a margin: 0 auto; container with a maximum width, so it has to be inside grid-content to function properly.\n. We're working on an official tutorial for the framework, which clarifies these concepts, and then some of that should make it back into the main documentation.\nThis grid is a complex beast, so questions like this are very helpful to us :) Thanks!\n. Going to test this and merge it today for 1.2.\n. We have the pieces in place, so for future releases the compiled CSS and JS will be available in a dist directory of the Bower folder. (It's here in the Gulpfile.) We're planning on releasing version 1.0.3 by the end of the week, which will be the first version of the framework to include distribution files.\nIn the mean time, the source Sass files are available in the Bower package. A good number of them, most importantly the Flexbox grid, can be used without any JavaScript.\n. We have a contributing document which has some recommendations for how to submit issues and pull requests. We don't currently have any Angular-specific guidelines, though. Was there a question you had on how to modify the codebase?\n. We really need to set up linters for this codebase, we just haven't gotten to it yet. The broad strokes are already there; all of our Angular modules are written in the same style, so following those general conventions is a good start. As far as specifics, hopefully we can get JSHint set up at some point, but in the mean time, just try to match our coding style as best you can. If we think something is suspect in a PR, we'll point it out :)\n. They'll work just fine! Since there's no JavaScript component to them, like with Iconic, you can just drop in the Sass and the icon fonts no problem.\n. After some internal chit-chat we decided to leave this as-is, so you can style a modal overlay and the modal itself with one class. This commit updates the documentation to explain what's up: 96e80a59b9f45c06c98f54a51cb34d8c92b0f15e\n. Closing in favor of #603.\n. Menu bar includes an .is-active class which can highlight an active item.\nYou can also use ui-sref-active to apply a class when a specific state is the current one.\nhtml\n<ul class=\"menu-bar\">\n  <li ui-sref-active=\"is-active\"><a ui-sref=\"home\">Home</a></li>\n  <li ui-sref-active=\"is-active\"><a ui-sref=\"about\">About</a></li>\n</ul>\n. The off-canvas menu has no built-in styles; it's just an empty box. If you're nesting a vertical menu bar inside of it, you can do what I described above. If you have your own custom component, you can use ui-sref-active and make your own custom active state class.\n. @akiran, I think ui-sref-active would cover the use-case you're describing, where you have a menu and the current item (the current view) is highlighted. If it's not a state-specific thing you're targeting, you can still use the is-active class to highlight things based on other criteria.\nLet us know if you have any more questions :)\n. For sure, I'm going to write one today. Here's a very brief overview.\n``` scss\n// You can use any named breakpoint in the $breakpoints map\n@include breakpoint(small) { } // Small and up\n@include breakpoint(medium only) { }\n@include breakpoint(medium down) { }\n// You can also use px, rem, or em values, which are all converted to em\n@include breakpoint(400px) { }\n@include breakpoint(60rem down) { }\n```\nAs for your grid issues, what version of iOS are you on? We just had a round of QA for iOS 7 and 8, and everything seemed fine.\n. About half of the components, most importantly the grid, will work without Angular or even JavaScript. So you could drop in the CSS for the basic components and it would work fine.\nIt's also possible to use Angular without any of the routing stuff, which is to say you can use Angular for things that aren't single-page apps. If you want to keep your backend largely the same, where ASP.Net is generating and serving HTML to the client, that's the way to go.\nIf you still wanted the single-page app feel, you'd have to do a fair amount of refactoring on the back-end. To make a SPA framework work with APS.Net, Rails, etc., the server-side framework has to essentially become an API. Because Angular does all of the templating work, the server then just serves up data as JSON, which the client compiles into HTML.\n. Here's the page: http://foundation.zurb.com/apps/docs/#!/media-queries\n. We've talked about it, we just need to decide how to implement it. We don't have access to jQuery's slideToggle in Angular, and animating max-height isn't a sustainable way to do it.\nMost likely we'll need to write our own thing to do it properly.\n. What's the purpose of running the uncompressed file through css-condense? Is it just for stripping out comments?\n. Actually, I'd like the CSS-style comments to be stripped out as well if that's possible. We're looking to get into automatically-generated documentation, and for doing HTML-specific documentation we might use Hologram, which requires you to use CSS-style comments to enclose documentation.\nI was actually looking for a CSS minifying tool that would just strip out comments and not do any other compression. Sass won't remove them unless it's also compressing the file.\n. Are you trying to write the theme just with the settings variables, or are you adding your own CSS overrides as well?\n. Totally! We'll look into it.\n. Awesome, thank you!\nHow do you think we should handle this in the template stack? Ideally the build process on that thing stays as simple as possible, although we're doing a lot of building from source at the moment.\nWe can either copy the finished file from dist, or add ng2HtmlJs to the process. The former is quicker to implement and is one less piece of machinery, but the latter is more customizable.\nIn general that's a balancing act we're trying to strike. Like, we could have the template stack just copy all of the compiled files, but then you can't later pick and choose which ones you want to include. On the other hand, if you actually know how this stuff works, you're probably smart enough to just do it yourself. The template stack is meant to be a baseline, and ideally it has as few moving parts as possible, to make it less error-prone and easy for beginners to understand.\n. Every Angular engineer we've talked to before and after this thing came out has asked \"can I just use it in my own project?\" Our template stack is definitely just meant to be a baseline, so maybe in the interest of reducing its complexity we cut out some of the choice. Of course the choice is still there, if you know what you're doing. But if you know what you're doing, you might just be ditching our entire build process anyway in favor of your own. If you don't know what you're doing, you're probably designing a prototype, so optimal delivery of files isn't yet a concern.\n. Related: #397\n. Hey, sorry for not getting back to you sooner!\nElement queries are definitely interesting, we just need to find the right way to implement them. As far as adding new libraries, we're trying to be really cautious about it right now, since the framework already has seven dependencies. If we add anything new, it probably won't be until a v2, when we can take a step back and figure out what libraries we're using.\nI'm going to close this and continue the discussion in #538, since you seem to have honed in on an possible solution.\n. Looks to be a side effect of how our settings parser works, since it prints out each set of variables in the order the files come. Thankfully button group is the only component with a dependency on another component's variables.\n. The container is just meant to center content inside a grid-content element. It shouldn't be a flex container, because it's just supposed to contain plain-old flow content. We might need to update the documentation to make this more clear, though.\nAn example of its use would be:\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-frame\">\n  <div class=\"grid-content\">\n    <div class=\"grid-container\"></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n. Yep, that should work. If not, I can try to make a more complete example.\n. Yeah, that's a really tricky thing. We want mixins for all of our components so they'll be more flexible, but at some point you still need to mimic our markup structure to an extent for it to work. This grid in particular is that way because of how flexbox works, and because it's new.\n. We fixed this in 1.0.3 (53d5952802e7d7da667c3fb19f73e0a39bc0591e), so now all <a> elements, not just ones with an href attribute, get the pointer cursor. Since there are no hrefs in Angular apps, browsers weren't applying the proper cursor to elements that are technically links.\nThe templates are all being updated right now, and they'll use the latest version of the framework when they're done.\n. We've gotten a lot of requests to create a datepicker for Foundation for Sites, so for version 6 of that framework we're going to do it, as an external plugin. Once that work is done, we could definitely wrap that functionality in an Angular module.\n. http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-datetime\n. Going to close this as a known feature request. We're working on a date/time picker for Foundation 6, and whatever we come up with there, we could definitely port over to Angular.\n. Nice, thanks for the work!\n. Hey, sorry for getting to this issue late. I tried your second code example verbatim and it worked for me on desktop and on iPad. I also removed all of the JavaScript like you described, and it still works. (Which makes sense, because none of the components you're using have JS elements.) Is it possible you got a Sass error or something?\n. Fixed with this pull request: #478 Sorry for the hassle!\n. Have you written any jQuery code related to panels? If you just remove jQuery, do the animations start working again?\n. Hey guys, sorry for the late response, but let's try to untangle this web of fun. Things that cause panels to unintentionally close are:\n- Having jQuery loaded\n- An element with a transition inside of the panel\n- Nested panels\nSeems like the last two happen because transitionend bubbles up unintentionally. #547 fixes this, so we'll bring in that change once we've reviewed it. Will that also fix the first issue with jQuery?\n. Alright, luckily this is an easy fix. You're passing the wrong parameter to the grid-frame() mixin.\n``` scss\n// Wrong\n@include grid-frame(vertical);\n// Right\n@include grid-frame($orientation: vertical);\n```\nMaking this one change fixes the issue, so the layout looks like the first screenshot, including on the iPad. The documentation was incorrect, as the first parameter of that mixin is $size, not $orientation. Size shouldn't even be an option, though, since you shouldn't be changing the width or height of the app frame, so we need to refactor that mixin slightly.\n. It's definitely something we should address in more detail. The main points of interest are Angular (IE9+ as of Angular 1.3, which we're using) and flexbox (IE10+), but there are lots of little things in the CSS and JS where we get to cut corners because we're only accounting for modern browsers. Like using modern CSS selectors, or DOM features only in newer browsers.\nIn terms of how to detect it, I think flexbox, like you said, is the most obvious way to check for general compatibility. Flexbox support was our original metric for browser support, so once we knew we were cutting IE9 and Android 2 as a result, we just went from there.\nPerhaps we could come up with a small, non-Angular script to drop in a Modernizr-like CSS class to detect lack of support.\nAnd to your point about separate module support, that's possible right now! Our sample bootstrapping code imports every UI plugin at once with the foundation module, but that's just a shorthand to import everything at the same time. You can also import each UI component separately, like foundation.tabs or foundation.accordion.\n. To come back to this, do you think a CSS class on <html> is enough, or would having one of the Foundation services expose an isCompatible parameter be more useful? Or both.\n. All of the classes are built using the mixins. Could you give some specific examples of mixins that don't work? I'm also taking a look at your other issue (#482) today, so I'll see what's up there.\n. We're working on improving the grid documentation, and we'll also be releasing a tutorial soon which will describe certain elements of the grid in better detail. If you have any specific feedback or issues with a Sass mixin, let us know in a new issue. :)\n. We've talked about it internally, but it's not of a huge interest to us at the moment. There is a good Angular module, though, that has very similar features to the jQuery one you linked to.\n. Ah, that's a legacy variable and shouldn't be in the codebase anymore. You can control the speed of animations with our built-in classes, or with your own CSS.\nWith our classes:\nhtml\n<div zf-panel animation-in=\"slideInUp\" class=\"[fast slow]\"></div>\nWith your own code:\nhtml\n<div zf-panel animation-in=\"slideInUp\" class=\"panel-thing\"></div>\nscss\n.panel-thing {\n  transition-duration: 500ms;\n}\n. I think I know what you're describing, but there's another use case you might be talking about as well.\nalign-items and align-self align elements on the cross-axis of the flex container. So if you have a horizontal grid, your cross-axis goes up and down, and so the align- properties shift elements up and down. If you had four elements on your horizontal grid, there's no way to make two stick to the left and two stick to the right. The justify-content property controls that behavior, and it can't be set on individual flex children.\nI think that's the behavior you're describing. But you're right that we don't currently have an abstraction for the align-items and align-self properties in the grid.\n. There is, but there are two caveats. Here's a Codepen that illustrates it.\nThe entire container flows as columns, and it's told to wrap, hence flex-flow: column wrap. Note the numbering of the items: it goes vertical, not horizontal. You can't make the HTML order horizontally, because the flex container is flowing vertically.\nThe other caveat is that the container in this example has a defined height. This creates the boundary that forces the child elements to wrap to the next column. Try removing height: 350px; from the .box selector\u2014all of the child elements will just stack vertically, because now they have no reason to wrap.\nSo yes, there is a way to do a Masonry layout in Flexbox, but unfortunately it isn't perfect.\n. We're trying to find a good solution for that right now, as there are plenty of components you could see being identical between the two frameworks, like panels, pagination, tables, and so on.\nWe're working on Foundation 6 right now, where we're trying to simplify a lot of components, so at the very least I think we'll wait until that framework is closer to completion. I wouldn't necessarily want to import any Foundation 5 components, since the codebase for them is a year and a half old.\n. Might be fixed by #478\n. Yep, right now you're supposed to copy the partials as a part of your build process\u2014that's what we do in our template stack, using a glob that only targets HTML files.\nStarting with 1.1, though, we're going to be distributing a compiled templates file (#463), so then you can just add one JavaScript file and get all of the templates. We're hoping to have 1.1 out in a week or so.\n. Is it possible to change a state after it's already been defined? The foundation.dynamicRouting module will create a set of states, and then in your bootstrapping code you'll define the states again. Can they be overwritten?\n. What @escapedcat said will work. The module foundation.dynamicRouting is what handles the creation of states from Front Matter, so if you don't include it, no states will be generated. We're doing exactly that for a client right now at ZURB\u2014using all of the framework's UI components, but writing our own states.\nThere's one caveat right now, which is that view animation doesn't work without the foundation.dynamicRouting module. This will change in version 1.1 of the framework, which we're hoping to have out soon. Then you'll be able to add animation to your states like this:\njs\n$stateProvider\n  .state('home', {\n    url: '/',\n    templateUrl: 'templates/home.html',\n    animation: {\n      enter: 'slideInDown',\n      leave: 'fadeOut'\n    }\n  });\nThe change is already in master if you want to mess around with it.\n. @mikestecker The front matter routing is totally optional, and we took out the line saying it's required from the documentation.\nWe're trying to put out v1.1 today, which will make view animation work without the router plugin, so you can write your own states but still set up transitions between them.\n. @olegpolyakov So, the awkward thing right now is that you still need those modules enabled to make view animation work, even if you're not using the Front Matter stuff. We were able to separate the functionality, but we haven't yet separated the modules themselves, to maintain backwards compatibility. We'll do that in a future version when we can properly deprecate it.\n. The app.js in the docs folder is just for our documentation. It includes a bunch of modules that aren't dependencies of the framework, including hljs, autocomplete, and so on.\nIf you're looking for boilerplate code to bootstrap a Foundation for Apps project, I'd suggest taking a look at the app.js file we use in our template stack.\nEdit: to be more specific, are you interested in mimicking the functionality of our search with autocomplete?\n. This is an issue with how iOS interprets the viewport height (vh) unit. Mobile Safari calculates 100vh without taking into account the height of the tabstrip. On iPhone, it doesn't account for the height of the status bar. So in both cases, the grid frame exceeds the \"real\" height of the viewport.\nWe're working on a solution but we don't have anything concrete yet. #456 addresses the issue by ditching the vh unit entirely, but it also introduces problems related to scrolling.\n. I'm going to close this in favor of #434, which is very similar. We definitely need a solution to this, so we'll find one.\n. This change fixes a pretty bad issue with images and flexbox in Firefox, but you're right that it may be too sweeping of a change, especially since the specificity is higher than one class (.grid-content img).\nWe've seen the issue crop up multiple times now, but we can also just implement the fix manually in those areas.\n. Reverted with this commit: f9dafb5527c08910d97b4b53fa92aef573c2fab9\n. What OS are you using?\n. @calmass It must have been an oversight. Blocks and panels use overflow: auto, which prevents scroll bars from showing up by default, so off-canvas should as well. Off-canvas and panel are more or less the same component, just positioned differently.\n. There's no reason you can't use all of the framework files in another build process. The Foundation CLI is just running gulp, so you could look at the template stack's Gulpfile and just re-fit that for Grunt.\nOur build process:\n- Copies static content like HTML partials, images, etc.\n- Copies HTML view templates and generates routes\n- Compiles Sass\n- Ugilifies and concatenates JavaScript\nThe only thing you can't do without Gulp is use our routing plugin, which allows you to generate ui.router-compatible states from Yaml in each view template. But that's largely optional; if you're writing your own states in the JavaScript you don't need it.\n. At the end of the day the Foundation frameworks are just a collection of CSS/JS components, which means they can pretty much go anywhere. Foundation for Apps gets more restrictive because it requires Angular, but if you're just using our CSS components then you're probably fine. And we definitely want people to abuse the framework, because we need it to be as flexible as possible. :) We don't have a lot of experience here with doing web-to-native ports, but your build process seems totally fine.\n. If you build something cool that you can publish, send it our way! We're starting to develop internal projects and do work for clients with the framework, and we're learning a lot about how a fully-responsive web app is built.\n. Block lists are for menus, so each <li> should hold a single menu item. Putting an inline list inside a single menu item (essentially nesting the menus) turns it into something of a non-standard pattern, so we probably won't add CSS to make this work out of the box. But of course, you can definitely write those overrides yourself for your own project.\n. Angular converts those attributes into more standard HTML, which you can then style. It looks like this:\nhtml\n<div class=\"accordion\">\n  <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n    <div class=\"accordion-title\"></div>\n    <div class=\"accordion-content\"></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\nSo you can select .accordion-title in CSS to change the styles.\nWe probably need to make this more clear in the documentation, though. Developers who haven't used Angular might not know that it renders these directives as HTML templates.\n. Could you explain in more detail what you want to do? Do you want to style individual items in an accordion?\n. Right! Yes, we need to add this, because right now accordion titles only support plain text. If you're just doing, say, an image, you could use a pseudo-element to add an icon.\nscss\n.accordion-title::before {\n  content: url('');\n}\nThis won't work if you need to add dynamic content, though, like an unread count or a label. It's on our list of things to add.\n. Going to close this out, but it's still on our list of things to do. :)\n. We'd like to do more with the touch gestures, so this is definitely an interesting idea. Unfortunately we can't do the 1:1 swipe/reveal that a native app can, but I think most developers who work on web apps understand that. (The libraries do exist but they're fairly complex, and might not work well in a framework where we have to provide generic solutions.)\n. So most touch libraries like Hammer, or the stuff built into Angular or Zepto, are not 1:1, which means you can't hold your finger mid-swipe, and move it around and have the UI element move with it. That requires a lot of math and DOM manipulation that's kind of expensive to calculate.\nFor example, we have the zf-swipe-close directive in Foundation for Apps, which lets you close a modal, panel, etc. with a swipe instead of a click/tap. It's a one-time action, though\u2014you do the swipe, and then the element animates out. You can't swipe slower or faster to change how the animation plays; it just runs in response to the swipe.\nCompare this to iOS or Android, which has a lot of those more fluid gestures built-in. And there are plenty of developers who write their own custom animations for their apps. Tweetbot for iOS is a great example. The web doesn't quite yet have the means to get that kind of fidelity out of motion. There are folks who are trying really hard, but the performance isn't quite there.\n. @soumak77 If you have the feature in a different branch of your fork, you should be able to open a PR with that specific branch.\nIf you don't have them in separate branches, I'd recommend making a new branch that compares against this repo's master branch, and cutting/pasting the feature in there, just so the PR is as clean as possible.\n. We do test on Android 4 devices, phone and tablet. What device, version of Android, and browser are you using?\n. We've got a big improvement coming in v1.1, which will hopefully be out tomorrow. For the directive templates, we're using ng-html2js to pack them all into a single JavaScript file, meaning you won't need to copy those HTML files from the Bower package.\nWe also added a new feature to the Iconic directive which allows you to specify the path your icon files are in.\nAre there any other specific concerns you have related to directory structure?\n. Definitely! Thanks for your feedback. Other than which Angular add-ons we use (namely ui-router and ngAnimate), we want to avoid being prescriptive with regards to how people design or code. That'll always be a goal for all three of the Foundation frameworks.\nAlso, 1.1 got pushed to tomorrow (Monday), but it'll get there.\n. You can still install the package and just ignore everything in the js folder. If you're using a tool like wiredep, you can configure it to ignore all of the JavaScript that our library depends on.\nTo be sure, Foundation for Apps has quite a few dependencies, so it is sort of lame that you have to install seven other things you probably won't use. (Although FastClick and the viewport units buggyfill are both nice.) If you check your dependencies into version control, you can ignore them in .gitignore, and if you don't, simply ignoring the folders is easy enough.\nBower 1.4 might add the ability to ignore dependencies, although there's been no word on it recently. Here's the pull request: bower/bower#1394\n. The icon-* classes should be used on the menu bar itself, not the menu group. However, a selector specificity issue was preventing the class from being applied properly. Fixed!\n. Here are the problems:\n- The menu bar is hiding overflowing content. We can fix that with overflow-y: hidden, and it shouldn't break anything else.\n- The action sheet container isn't centered within the menu bar item. It's anchored to the right instead, like a normal element would be. You can fix that with position: relative; left: 50%;. I'm not sure how to elegantly build that fix into the framework.\nApplying those fixes will make the action sheet visible.\n\nHowever, since it's anchored so far to the right it will be cut off, which is a known issue. We need to add some kind of edge detection to the action sheet. (Or rethink it entirely at some point, because it's a super unwieldy component right now, and probably overlaps in functionality with the popup.)\n. That Firefox <input> line height issue, what a fun one.\n. Could you describe the issue you're having in more detail? Maybe include a screenshot?\n. Also, does the error happen when you change to a new view, or when you perform some other action like a click?\n\"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '$$phase' of null\" (foundation.js line 29)\n. Yeah, let us know if the changes on the master branch fix your issue.\nBut just so we're sure, the series of events that cause the error are:\n- Navigate to a state that has modals inside it\n- Navigate away from that state\n- Navigate back to the state\n- Click the modal open trigger\n- Error\nWe had bugs reported related to modals that are inside of a ui-view, and we were able to implement some fixes. See: #464\n. Do you use Bower to manage dependencies? If you do, switching to the master branch is easy. Just make this change in your bower.json.\njs\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"foundation-apps\": \"master\"\n  }\n}\n. We don't recommend it, because we actively develop on it. We maintain a stable branch as well that's always pointed at the last version we released.\nHowever, we're releasing v1.1 tomorrow, which will include this fix, so you can just upgrade when that comes out. Glad we could help!\n. View animation recently got an overhaul (#386), and it's now way more robust and stable. We were able to pretty thoroughly test it in all of the browsers we support as well. It'll be in version 1.1, which we're trying to get out on Friday.\nThe align-items: stretch thing is interesting. We use that to ensure that columns in a horizontal grid are all equal-height, since height: 100% tends to not cut it. But we could give it another look, also, if it's a performance hit.\n. There's a gulp-compass plugin that you can swap into your project. Run npm install gulp-compass --save-dev to get it in your project, and then follow the instructions on the readme to get it set up. You'll be replacing the call to $.rubySass in the Gulpfile to $.compass, under the sass task.\nYour project will also need a config.rb file, like a normal Compass project would. The config file needs to reference the Foundation for Apps Sass as an import path:\nruby\nadd_import_path \"bower_components/foundation-apps/scss\"\n. @soumak77 The classes follow ngAnimate's format; what would we need to change to make them work? I know they work with ng-repeat.\n. @soumak77 Okay, so the reason is that there are five types of Angular transition classes: enter, leave, move, add, and remove. Our motion classes support the first two: enter and leave. We should be able to add support for the rest just by chaining those other classes to the existing selectors. By adding at least add/remove, we get support for ng-show and ng-hide.\n. @soumak77 It's possible, I'll see how quickly we can put together a test case. It's a relatively simple Sass change, though.\n. @soumak77 And done!\n. Definitely, we'll see about getting it in soon.\n. Merged with 40abb575efde27fcff8c59b8ee18fff417a9919c\nThanks! :)\n. Nice, thanks!\n. Yep, #483 fixes this I believe. We're trying to put out a 1.1 tomorrow, so stay tuned!\n. You think there's any way to make improvements that are backwards-compatible, or would we need to wait for a major release to work on this?\nIt's also likely that v2 of this framework will be written in Angular 2, so then all of this is out the window anyway ;)\n. Sounds solid. We have no timeline for a v2 of Foundation for Apps, but there's also no real timeline for Angular 2's release. We're keeping a close eye on it, though.\nWith that in mind, I'm going to close this out. There are some big things that we have to wait until a major version to change. But we're always keeping track of this stuff, so we love the feedback. Keep it coming! :)\n. Merged with this commit: ab6303639d8b2bc26dd77d758d91746111c3996b\n. Closing in favor of #549.\n. Looks like some weird network issue. Can you try running everything manually? cd into the folder for the project that was created and run:\nbash\nnpm install\nbower install\ngulp\n. Did you get any errors when you ran npm install?\n. Hmm, well you got an error the first time, so let's try again.\nbash\nrm -rf node_modules\nnpm cache clean\nnpm install\nSee if you get the same errors with node-sass. Also, what version of Node are you running?\nIf this doesn't work, you'll likely need to ask the folks at node-sass for some help.\n. Swapping for Ruby Sass is fairly easy. Install the gulp-ruby-sass library and then replace the code in the sass task of your Gulpfile with this code:\njs\nreturn gulp.src('client/assets/scss/app.scss')\n  .pipe($.rubySass({\n    loadPath: paths.sass,\n    style: 'nested'\n  })).on('error', function (e) {\n    console.log(e);\n  })\n  .pipe($.autoprefixer({\n    browsers: ['last 2 versions', 'ie 10']\n  }))\n  .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/assets/css/'));\n. Right! Forgot they have a new 1.0 alpha branch. One more thing, if you want to lock in the version of Sass you're using with a Gemfile, you can add one to the project root, run bundle install, and then add the setting bundleExec: true to the $.rubySass config object.\n. @Joe-5mith Were you able to get gulp-ruby-sass working properly?\n. Can you try using the directive as an attribute instead of an element?\n. Well, unfortunately it was an oversight, but it's been fixed now. No CSS output in the framework should be hardcoded, except the <meta> styles we use to pass the media queries to the JavaScript.\n. We try to put out patches every few weeks, depending on how many crazy bug fixes we need to get out the door. So at best I can say \"a week or two\", but we don't have a date right now.\n. The move process seems to be very similar to enter, except that the class is different. Is there any real difference, or can we just chain .ng-move to .ng-enter and .ng-show?\n. Ah I see, so we need to prevent collision between enter/show and move. Ideally we find a way to do that without outputting a ton of extra CSS. Or we relegate it to a mixin-only feature, to keep our file size down.\nI also need to eventually take a look at how we store all these animation classes, if there has to be three sets of them. It would be better if the Sass variables looked like this:\nscss\n$motion-classes-enter: 'ng-enter', 'ng-show', 'ng-move';\n$motion-classes-leave: 'ng-leave', 'ng-hide';\nThere are some nice selector manipulation functions in Sass 3.4 that would probably help, but they aren't in libsass yet (and probably won't be for a while), so I might write something that recreates what I need.\n. I opened a pull request that implements ng-move here: #560 \nThe Sass variable situation is becoming messy, but we'll roll with it for now. You can test this branch on an existing project with bower install foundation-apps#ng-move-motion\n. Yep, that should be e.target instead of e.srcElement.\n. The team looked over this today, good stuff!\nWe like the zf-if concept as a different way to do visibility, but not necessarily as a replacement for Interchange. The benefit of Interchange is that visibility within a set of elements is mutually-exclusive\u2014only one element within an Interchange element can be displayed. In some of your examples, each element in a set needs to use an only version of a media query, otherwise every element would appear at once on a large screen.\nOur main piece of feedback for the zf-if concept is that you could simplify the directive by having just one, called zf-if, and then read the name of the media query off of the value of the directive, like so:\nhtml\n<div zf-if=\"medium\"></div>\n<div zf-if=\"small only\"></div>\nThis solves another issue which this feature would need to address, which is that the breakpoint names are hard-coded. Right now small, medium, and large are built-in, but the framework also has xlarge and xxlarge, and the user can change the names of the media queries, or add new ones. You can access them through the foundation.mediaqueries module. With this in mind, a more generic zf-if directive makes sense, because then you're just parsing a string and checking it against the global media query list.\nAs for element queries, we're not sure we're ready to implement them quite yet. Also, we don't want to add another external library to the framework right now. Foundation for Apps already has seven dependencies, so we'd like to hold off on adding any new ones until we're ready for a v2 of the framework.\n. Our next release will be a patch, and then probably a minor release after that (1.2). Sorry for making you wait so long! :) The work you're doing is fantastic.\n. Could you give an example of how you'd use this new feature?\n. @soumak77 So what we're trying to solve is the issue of incremental builds, where you may not be passing every file through the router. Your use case seems somewhat specific, but from a Gulp perspective, being able to support partial builds (like using gulp-cached to only pass modified files through a stream) would be useful.\nOne issue I see with your current approach is that the more you append, the more foundationRoutes.concat calls you get in your code, and the plugin right now probably can't differentiate between a route being added versus changed, so if you ran it too many times the file would become larger than necessary. To be sure, though, actually reaching into the existing file and modifying the JS object in there would be tricky, as you wouldn't know the exact formatting (uglified or not? etc.)\nI wonder if you can store the routes in memory and just reference that when re-generating the routes file. There are some Node modules that would let you store the data after the process exists.\nI like the idea of using module configuration, since that will pull that foundationRoutes variable out of the global scope. It's worth noting that we'd like to move the routing plugin into its own npm module in a future version of the framework, because we realized having a node module in a Bower package is a little weird. I'll take the blame for initially suggesting that ;)\nTo do it right, we would probably introduce the module in 1.2, but keep the old one in place until 1.3, when we formally deprecate it by removing the bin folder from the repo. Your idea requires changing the order in which files are loaded in the HTML (libraries, then routes, then boostrap), so a new version of the plugin could introduce these breaking changes.\nIf you're interested in working on those bigger changes to the plugin, I can set up the new repo with some test files set up and you can hack away at it.\n. @soumak77 You're the best! Thanks so much for your interest in contributing to the framework. Once again, we don't have a timeline for 1.2, so don't fret about getting it done right now.\nHere's the standalone module. To recap, here are the goals of a new version:\n- Support incremental builds: the parser needs to be able to print a routes object without passing every file through every time.\n- Use module configuration instead of a global variable to print routes.\n- Keep it backwards-compatible! For version 1.2, the foundation.dynamicRouting module should work with the old and new router. For version 1.3 we can drop support for the old router.\n. @soumak77 Hey, no problem! We're going to try and square away some of the bigger Apps issues and pull requests this week.\n. @soumak77 Since it's a feature, we can save it for 1.2. We don't have a timeline for a 1.2 right now, but you'll have plenty of time to work on it. We weren't planning on implementing this feature specifically, so you can definitely own it.\nIf you give me one more day to review this with the team, I'll get you some feedback. :)\n. The CLI will work with your current projects, so you can update it no problem.\nAs you correctly guessed, most of the CLI's commands are wrappers for Bower and npm functions. So foundation-apps update is the same as bower update, and foundation-apps watch is running npm start, which runs a local copy of Gulp. (This means you don't need Gulp installed globally for it to work.)\nThis abstraction will make more sense when we move Foundation 6 and Ink 2 onto this CLI, and then all three frameworks will use the same tool. The command name will also change to just foundation.\nGlad you're loving it! We feel really good about 1.1, it's way more stable than 1.0. :)\n. Could you cd into the folder created and run bower install manually? That's the step of the install process that it's failing on.\n. Hmm, could have been a temporary network hiccup or an issue with proxies, depending on the kind of network you're on. If it happens again let us know. :)\n. This will fix components not loading properly in HTML5 mode, but it would affect apps that still use hash bangs, but also run in a subdirectory. In hash bang mode, the relative component paths are always relative to the index.html file of the app, no matter what route you're on. If this was changed to an absolute path, it would look be looking in the wrong place.\nEdit: Actually, might need to look into that again. I was trying to figure it out a few weeks ago, what the root directory is when a directive template is being loaded.\nWe've started distributing a pre-compiled templates file, and our project template now pre-compiles templates instead of loading all those HTML files separately. Would that method get around this issue?\n. Yep, the Travis file has been updated so that won't happen.\n. If you're fine with it not being a single-page app, then you should be able to just drop in the CSS, and the JavaScript for Angular and Foundation and it'll work. We distribute the files on npm and Bower, so you can get the compiled CSS and JS from there.\nIf you want it to be an actual single-page app, though, that's a whole new can of worms. Normally Rails handles your URL routing, and serves up all the HTML. With Angular, however, your app has to have one entry point (an index.html file), and Angular handles all of the routing and rendering of HTML.\nWe recently redesigned the ZURB Library, which is a Rails application that uses Angular on the front-end. The server redirects all requests to index.html, and Angular handles the route from there. Also, Rails doesn't serve up any HTML; the backend is just an API that sends data to the client as JSON, and Angular uses it to write the HTML for each page.\n. @soumak77 Ah yeah. So move only happens on ng-repeat, which also uses enter and leave. So is the main concern getting move to work with those two specifically? If that's the case, then can move be the only animation event (of the five there are) that gets its own unique classes?\n. @soumak77 Do you think the move animations are needed for every type of transition? There's slide, fade, hinge, zoom, and spin.\n. @soumak77 Yeah, CSS output is a concern, but I think the move classes specifically will go behind a Sass variable. I was also wondering if the effects were practical for this specific type of transition. But I'll just add all of them! No problem.\n. Going to close this and open a new PR later when I've implemented it properly.\n. Do you want the panel to be open as long as the vehicles state is active? Maybe you could drop the zf-open and use ui-router's state events to open/close the panel. The ui-router wiki goes into more detail, but here's a (possible) code example:\njs\n$stateProvider.state(\"items.add\", {\n  url: \"/add\",\n  onEnter: ['$stateParams', '$state', 'foundationApi', function($stateParams, $state, FoundationApi) {\n    foundationApi.publish('#detail-panel', 'show');\n  }],\n  onExit: ['$stateParams', '$state', 'foundationApi', function($stateParams, $state, FoundationApi) {\n    foundationApi.publish('#detail-panel', 'hide');\n  }]\n});\n. The grid classes only apply to a panel when it's turned back into a block. Although maybe folks are expecting the classes to work with both components?\nWe could probably use more built-in classes for panel sizing. In the mean time, you can use the panel-layout() mixin to create a panel with a custom orientation and size.\nscss\n.custom-panel {\n  // The second parameter can be a percentage or absolute width\n  @include panel-layout(left, 100%);\n}\n. Do you think a handful of pixel-based sizing classes are enough, or are folks expecting a range of percentage-based classes on par with the grid? It could end up being a lot of extra code if we have twelve sizing classes, and actually twice that because you need different ones for horizontal and vertical panels.\n. I'm amazed how complicated the math for this turned out to be.\n. You can just drop an image into the <a> and it will work just fine. There is an issue right now where the image still has a bottom margin, because it's expecting text to be below it. You can fix it for now with this selector:\ncss\n.menu-bar > li > a > img:first-child:last-child {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n. There shouldn't be a scroll bar if a grid element is shrunk, because \"shrink\" means \"this element should only take up the space it needs\". So using overflow: hidden (or overflow: visible to make using dropdown menus easier) as a default would make sense.\n. This is really interesting, do you think you could add a section to the Iconic documentation page that explains this, with a live demo and code example?\n. Thanks!\n. One last question, the last section, \"Delay Loaded Icon\" shows two code examples, one where the icon doesn't render and one where it does. Is it possible to just have the second example, since it's the one that implements the fix you describe? Our documentation should skew towards having one example to show how to do something. If you'd never use the first example, then we can probably drop it.\n. Sounds good, I'll update it.\n. This should be fine, although one thing we want to avoid in the future is hard-coding class names. All of the Foundation frameworks are written in Sass mixins, which means you can rip out our entire class structure and replace it with your own if you want. With that in mind, JS plugins should avoid adding or referencing built-in classes, because we can't guarantee that the user is using them.\nTo be sure, though, we do this a lot in Foundation for Apps right now. It's also trickier with Angular, because our components are these templates that you just drop in. In Foundation for Sites it's easier, because the user just drops a bunch of data attributes onto existing markup.\nThe framework is very new, though, and for specific components like this not many people are probably using the mixins yet. They're most commonly-used for the grid, and that's also arguably the place they're most valuable.\nSo if we merge in #561, will this work as-is, or will you need to make another change?\n. @soumak77 If we pull in #561, could you merge/rebase this PR and get the proper fix in to we can reconcile the two?\n. Alright, merged in #561.\n. Nice, so it's solid, then?\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. Thanks!\n. There weren't any big changes to the grid from 1.0.3 to 1.1 (just two commits from what I can tell), but this may have been introduced in 1.0.3.\nI think the fix is changing the default sizing behavior of grid elements.\nscss\n.grid-block,\n.grid-content {\n  // Old\n  flex: 1 1 auto;\n  // New\n  flex: 1 1 0;\n}\nSetting the preferred size to 0 instead of auto ensures that the blocks actually take up even amounts of space and don't vary in their widths. We initially thought that auto did the same thing, but sometimes column widths still find ways to vary. It seems like setting it to 0 is the right thing.\nWe'll need to test it in every browser, of course, since they're all implementing Flexbox a little differently, and test the change in any existing codebases to make sure it's not a breaking change. I don't think it is, though, especially since it's the behavior we wanted all along.\n. @etcook Awesome! Originally grid elements just used flex: 1 1, but then we added auto to the end because different browsers used different defaults for the last property (flex-basis). But it sounds like setting it to 0 across the board will get us the result we want. We'll do some testing on it.\n. Hm, if you have time can you drum up a more isolated test case?\nOmitting the last value of flex, which is flex-basis, is problematic because IE10/11 have a different default value, so you have to be explicit with it. IE10/11 also miscalculates the width/height of any element with a flex-basis other than auto, so that's fun. Learn more here.\n. The plugin is called allmighty-autocomplete if you want to use it. It's not developed by us; we just use it in our documentation.\n. We don't plan to include it with the framework by default, but it's pretty easy to integrate into an existing project. Run bower install allmighty-autocomplete --save, then add the path to the array of JavaScript paths in your Gulpfile. The library also includes a CSS file with some default styles you can use.\n. Generally grid blocks don't scroll, only content blocks. Looking at your markup, I would expect the first element (with the <h2> and <h4>) to be fixed at the left, the last element (with Go code!) to be fixed at the bottom right, and the middle element to be fixed at the top right, and scrollable. What's your intended behavior?\nEdit: Unless the entire modal is a vertical grid, in which case I would expect all three elements to stack vertically. The top and bottom ones don't move, and the middle one scrolls. This is the intended behavior of the grid.\n. I wouldn't expect the .grid-block.vertical element to scroll, just the .grid-content areas. I think the HTML of this modal can be refactored.\nAssuming you want to anchor elements at the top and bottom, and keep the middle open to show content, you can do this:\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-block vertical\">\n  <div class=\"grid-content shrink text-center\">\n    <h2>Modal Header</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"grid-content\">\n    <div ng-repeat=\"x in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]\">\n      <p>Content {{ x }}</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"grid-content shrink text-center\">\n    <a class=\"button primary\">Next</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\nThe top and bottom have .shrink, so the middle section is expanded. The elements added with ng-repeat fill in the middle space.\n. There needs to be a distinction between modals that use the grid and ones that don't. A plain modal has padding and is display: block, while a grid modal has no padding and is display: flex. If we consider a plain modal to be the default (which is sensible, since it's the simpler form of a modal), then we need a class, maybe .grid, for modals to shift them into grid mode.\nWhatever solution we use here should be applied to panels and off-canvas as well, which are two other components that have these two modes.\n. We're working on improvements to the grid documentation, namely using... y'know, actual examples, so look forward to that.\nWe've had some trouble explaining the difference between the three grid elements\u2014the frame, block, and content block. Recently though, we've found an easier way to frame it. (But you're right, .grid-content is always the lowest-level.)\nHere's a no-frills grid. It only uses two of the elements.\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-frame\">\n  <div class=\"small-3 grid-content\"></div>\n  <div class=\"small-3 grid-content\"></div>\n  <div class=\"small-6 grid-content\"></div>\n</div>\nHere's that same grid if we nested a new grid inside the first element. It adds a new, third element for nesting purposes.\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-frame\">\n  <div class=\"small-3 grid-block\">\n    <div class=\"grid-content\"></div>\n    <div class=\"grid-content\"></div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"small-3 grid-content\"></div>\n  <div class=\"small-6 grid-content\"></div>\n</div>\nThe main difference from a typical float grid is that you can add sizing, source ordering, etc. classes to block and content.\n. This is something we haven't fully addressed yet, so now's a good time to. Some of the components have default classes and animations applied. Panels will have this issue also.\nMaybe we can switch up the logic so that if you omit the position attribute, it doesn't add anything? In our examples we always include it, even though it does have a default value of left.\n. Opened #589 since this is relevant to multiple components.\n. It's a little awkward right now, but you do need both the foundation.dynamicRouting and foundation.dynamicRouting.animations modules to make it work, even if you're not using our routing plugin.\nWhen we released 1.0, view animations only worked with the routing plugin. We fixed this in 1.1, but to maintain backwards compatibility, we didn't want to change the names of the modules. Unless there's a way for us to create a module alias, so we can change the name, we'll have to keep the naming convention as-is for the time being.\n. Seems like that fix will work fine for now. There's been talk about making the routing plugin's process a little more robust than dropping an array into the window object, so look forward to that!\n. The ghosting issue is a WebKit bug, but we have a workaround in the CSS. However, the setup for the animation isn't working properly. The first parent of the views should temporarily get a class called .position-absolute, but here it's not. We'll look into it.\n. Could you try reworking your HTML so that the ui-view element is wrapped by a grid-block? So it would look something like this:\nslim\n.grid-frame.vertical\n  .grid-content.shrink\n  .grid-block\n    .grid-content ui-view\n      .grid-container\n. Try adding the class .ui-animation to the view and see if that fixes it. That won't be necessary in the next version of the framework (e64d2eee89ac7f4b7e9b5cecea17b68d2b6c460c).\n. This happens because both views are temporarily position: absolute. But the wrapper element around the ui-view container is what should prevent the two views from shifting around. If the wrapper and the view are the same size, you shouldn't be able to tell.\n. Nice! We know it's a little confusing ;) In a future version of the framework we'll just build in the container class, like .ui-view-container or something like that. We're also currently writing a tutorial on Foundation for Apps that will cover view animation.\n@huphtur, let me know if these fixes work. There's two parts to setting up view animation:\n1. Give the ui-view a class of .ui-animation.\n2. Wrap the view in a parent container that has the same size. Usually this is just another .grid-block.\n. The markup @DeanSolecki wrote is the right way to do it. If anyone has any more problems let me know!\n. Can you try running npm start and see if that works?\n. npm start is what the CLI runs in the background, so until we get this fixed you can use that command and it'll work just fine.\nWhat versions of Node and npm are you running? Use node -v and npm -v to find out. Edit: never mind, you totally already said :)\n. @quook What version of Node are you on? Maybe it's an issue with 0.12; most of us here are still running 0.10.\n. Alright, I was able to recreate it in Node 0.12.2, so it's an issue with Node 0.12.x.\n. Just published version 1.1 of the CLI which addresses this issue. Run npm update -g foundation-cli to get it.\n. I don't know that you can definitively prove that Angular is on its way out just yet ;) Either way, a v2 of this framework is still a way off, so we'll cross that bridge when we get there. But to be sure, the opportunity cost of sticking with Angular vs. switching to another framework are about the same, because either way we have to learn something new.\n. @zimt28 Are there any examples in the wild of people doing this? Writing pure classes and then hooking them into multiple libraries?\n. Sass can't import plain CSS files using @import, only other Sass files. Thankfully, it's pretty easy in Gulp to just insert those extra CSS files.\nTo add external CSS to your main CSS file (which was compiled from Sass), there's two steps to take.\nFirst, add the plain CSS files to gulp.src. The files will be combined in the order you list them.\njs\nreturn gulp.src(['path/to/file.css', 'path/to/sass.scss'])\n  .pipe(/* ... */)\nNext, add a concatenation step to the stream. gulp-sass will ignore your plain CSS, only processing the Sass files. But now we have two CSS files, and we need to combine them into one. gulp-concat will do this for us, and the template project includes it.\nYou can insert concat before or after autoprefixer, just make sure you do it before gulp.dest().\njs\n// Compiles Sass\ngulp.task('sass', function () {\n  gulp.src(['path/to/other/file.css', 'client/assets/scss/app.scss'])\n    .pipe($.sass({\n      includePaths: paths.sass,\n      outputStyle: (isProduction ? 'compressed' : 'nested'),\n      errLogToConsole: true\n    }))\n    .pipe($.autoprefixer({\n      browsers: ['last 2 versions', 'ie 10']\n    }))\n    .pipe($.concat('app.css'))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/assets/css/'))\n  ;\n});\nIn the future we'll see about adding more documentation on how the template stack actually works. The Gulp team itself doesn't publish any best practices for how to structure a Gulpfile, but if you want to see how \"the big kids\" do it, I'd recommend you check out Google's Web Starter Kit and the HTML5 Boilerplate.\nHope this helps!\n. Like @AntJanus said, all of the components are generally framework-agnostic. Half of them also work without any JavaScript, most critically the Flexbox grid. You can install the Bower or npm package and just drop in the Sass files (or compiled CSS).\nThe reason we didn't write a wrapper around plain JS plugins is because then we lose some of the benefits of the framework itself. That being said, hopefully our components can be flexible enough to be dropped into any JS framework. For example, Motion UI will eventually be a standalone library, and it'll be way more configurable. Then you could use it with, say, Ember's Liquid Fire, in addition to ngAnimate.\nWe don't have a timeline for a v2 of a framework, but when that time rolls around we'll probably be reassessing how the framework is built, since Angular 2 is a thing.\n. Which control on the page should open the modal? And could you post the code for the modal and the element with zf-open that triggers the modal?\n. Try using .grid-content instead of .grid-block for the inner elements. Blocks are just for layout, while content blocks are for actual content. The main difference is that one is display: flex and the other is display: block. The flexbox behavior is interfering with the display of the images.\n. Ah yeah, I just remembered that we've run into this, so I think you're right. For a while we had a fix in place that just applied width: 100% to all images within a grid, but it was reverted.\n. @tatemz That second issue was fixed a few weeks ago, it just hasn't landed in a stable version yet. (caaf800f21cf4750b534709d1e0371a9a2152105)\nAs for the main issue, I wonder if applying min-width: 1px to flex children across the board would work.\n. A few remarks about your markup:\n- You don't need the panel-bottom class on the panel; the position attribute adds it for you.\n- The zf-panel attribute doesn't need a value. Since you have an ID on there, you're good.\nThe layout for panels is a little tricky; the panel should never be inside any content blocks (.grid-content), just adjacent to them in the HTML. So a super basic layout would look like this:\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-block\">\n  <div zf-panel></div>\n  <div class=\"grid-content\">\n    <p>Content!</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\nIn this example, there's one main content area that spans the entire width, along with the panel, and both of them share a container. This ensures that the panel appears on top of the main content, and avoids issues with scrolling containers and position: absolute elements.\nThat might be your issue. If not, could you post a larger code example for us to take a look at? Thanks!\n. Awesome, thanks!\n. So it looks like you're trying to run unit tests with PhantomJS?\nHere's the key error: TypeError: 'null' is not an object (evaluating 'mediaQueries[key].replace')\nMedia query settings are stored in a Sass variable, which we pass to the JS by serializing it and attaching it to a specific <meta> tag. The JavaScript reads the style attribute of this special meta tag, and turns it into an object of breakpoints.\nWe've seen this before, and the reason it's happening is because the PhantomJS instance isn't referencing any compiled CSS. We probably need a workaround for this, but Interchange specifically needs this breakpoints. Maybe we can get around it by just loading in a default set if it can't find any.\n. I think this is something we can fix, by dropping in a pre-set list of media queries if pulling from the <meta> tag doesn't work. We had this issue with the routing plugin as well, and we were able to fix that.\n. Do you get any JavaScript errors?\n. We don't support Browserify, or any other module loaders right now, but it's something we'll look into eventually. In the mean time, the correct name of the Angular module is just foundation, not foundation-apps.\nThe foundation module gets you every UI component at once, but you can also only import individual elements, like foundation.panel or foundation.accordion. The Angular modules page in our documentation breaks down every module and what they all do. You can also check out the bootstrapping code for our template project to see what we're loading specifically.\n. What problem does this fix?\n. I see, thanks for clarifying :)\n. It might be possible to make the body of the switch a pseudo-element, and then the text just sits after it. The thing is that the switch itself needs to be clickable, and not require any JavaScript, which is why it's always been structured how it is.\nHowever, people have also asked that we support text inside the switch, although it might be possible to support both. Inner text isn't a label, anyway, it's a state.\n. Because the framework is geared towards responsive web apps, in general we assume that any pane of content could need to scroll, as its dimensions will change wildly between mobile and desktop. But you're right that the overflow issue has come up multiple times.\nWe have a .noscroll class for grid elements, but right now it actually applies overflow: hidden, which is also problematic. So I just added a change to make it overflow: visible instead.\nWe've had a number of issues with overflows and scrolling, so we're definitely looking at ways to better handle that stuff. For example, most JavaScript plugins assume the window is always the thing scrolling, not some nested scrolling panel, and F4A projects are made entirely out of those. (Tether has been problematic in this regard.)\n. Definitely, it's actually in the docs-specific bootstrapping code, so it'll be moved before it's merged.\n. Closing in favor of bc01826c7bd1eb8e4ed6fb3bf293fcb0aebcaf9f which solves the same issue without extra CSS.\n. Thanks for the GIF, and also revealing to me that Chrome DevTools can slow down animations. That's awesome!\nBefore we merge this, we'll make sure it works in other browsers.\n. Actually, looking closer, I don't think this is the right fix. The issue is specificity:\n``` scss\n// Defined by switches\n.switch > label {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n// Defined by forms\ninput[type=\"checkbox\"] + label {\n  // This is overriding the margin: 0; above\n  margin-left: 0.5rem;\n}\n```\nMatching the specificity within the switch class fixes the issue. This commit implements the fix: 951eeadd343e0b7fdf9482987d9d9f9e7349b318\n. I'm fine with one less deploy step. Thanks for spreading the word. :)\n. Browser compatibility is the best. Thanks!\n. We're about ready for a patch release, just need to close down a few of the more pressing issues. View animation specifically is something we want a little more solid.\n. Definitely, we'll see about getting that in shortly.\n. Add the --production flag to the command you're running. This enables compression for the CSS and JavaScript.\nThe plugin gulp-if controls the process of compression. If it sees the --production flag, the JavaScript runs through the uglify transform. Otherwise, it skips over it.\n. You'd need to use an iframe inside of a modal, but I don't know that Facebook allows their share screens to be loaded in iframes\u2014they have to be in their own window. (See more here.)\nThere are a few ways to trigger this screen, which Facebook details in their developer documentation.\n. It's a known issue, @jeanieshark and I spent a while looking at it but couldn't figure it out. I'll double-check on how far we got in diagnosing the problem.\n. Fixed via a685cccf2a13dff77cdd728f41f9dbbbefbdf643. It'll be in the next patch release.\n. The Git clone may have failed. Can you try running the command manually?\ngit clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template.git mwepd2\n. Oh! You're on an old version of the CLI\u2014it doesn't use Ruby at all now. Run npm update -g foundation-cli. Edit: Maybe. We should have scrubbed any Ruby-related instructions from our docs and readmes, but if we missed something, let us know.\n. @soulstyle Do you see a project folder being created after running foundation-apps new? The folder should still be there even if the install fails.\n. If you want open elements to close when a toggle is fired, use zf-hard-toggle. It toggles the element with the ID you specify, and also closes other open elements. Does that sound like what you need?\n. What version of Node and npm are you running?\nnode -v\nnpm -v\nAs for the project you tried to make, the files are all there. Can you try running npm install manually from within the project's folder?\n. The commands are identical. foundation-apps watch is just running npm start. But for the sake of consistency we'll make sure that it lists the same command.\nJust so we can close this out, could you try running the foundation-apps new command again? You should get a list npm errors above the text at the end where it says \"There were some problems during the installation.\"\n. Ah okay, it's a permissions issue with your computer. Here's an npm issue comment that details a fix. (Specifically it's the sudo chown commands halfway down the comment.)\n. The $order parameter in the mixin has an extra comma. Remove that last comma and you'll be good.\nIt looks like our documentation has a few formatting issues like these, so we'll make sure they get fixed.\n. Can you describe in more detail the problem this creates? What do you mean that the Angular application is loading multiple times?\nAlso, are you using our Gulp routing plugin or writing your own routes?\n. The Iconic file hasn't changed since version 1.0; is this a problem you encountered starting with a specific version?\n. Since it's an issue with Acorn, we'll close this out.\n. We patched the shrink behavior of grid elements to be overflow: visible, meaning they'll never have a scroll bar (see here: b44df9ee31e899a74a2dd2ff2d61e4b3fb096b58). The fix is in master, but hasn't landed in a stable release yet. We should have a patch version out soon.\nIn the mean time, you can patch this behavior yourself by adding overflow: visible to grid elements you know are shrinking.\nContent blocks are always overflow: auto, meaning they get a scrollbar if the content is taller than the container. If your blocks are really short (which it looks like they might be, based on the screenshot), there's a good chance they get a scroll bar. You can disable scrolling by adding the .noscroll class to the element.\n. Thanks! :)\n. This might be fixed on the master branch, where we've prevented the minimal UI from displaying, which gets around the weird height calculations Mobile Safari does. See #603, and the commit that replaced it, bc01826c7bd1eb8e4ed6fb3bf293fcb0aebcaf9f.\n. We tested this in multiple browsers to be sure, and I don't think anything we can do will fix it. Foundation for Apps projects are built with a series of scrolling boxes\u2014the window itself never scrolls.\nIt seems that when you try to scroll a box in a direction it can't scroll, that scroll event goes straight to the window, instead of the next scrollable parent. If you're on a Mac, you can see the rubber-banding effect when you scroll a code example in the docs up and down. It's trying to scroll the window, instead of the scrolling box its inside.\nSo we determined this to be a browser issue, and there isn't really anything we can do about it.\n. Right, inner containers with a vertical scroll will continue scrolling the next parent up when they reach the bottom. The same doesn't apply to horizontal scrolling containers.\nAre you saying ui-grid fixes the horizontal scrolling issue?\n. @sgraham3311 Hm, well let me know if you come across a solution that gets around this, because it seems like a browser or operating system issue.\n. Two weeks is a good estimate. A few of us on the team are out of the office next week (vacation, off-site training), but the week after we can put out a patch.\nThanks for continuing to use the framework! The work you've contributed so far is fantastic :)\n. What version of Android are you using, and what web browser?\n. Hmm, interesting. Have you noticed any performance differences between the two, or any other gotchas that would be worth knowing about?\nEither way we probably won't swap out a dependency until a v2 of the framework.\n. @soumak77, you're the best! You seem to have adequately answered this question, but @vincentmorneau, if you need any more clarification, let us know.\n. There is documentation on our modules here, but we could be doing a better job. There were talks to write more wrapper methods to make the API a bit less terse (see #390), but there's nobody working on it right now.\n. As for the event firing, a modal should always fire an event when it closes, no matter how the close happened. That makes sense.\n. That's for popups, not modals. But your issue is fixed in master?\n. Gotcha. Looks like this is fixed, then.\n. How does this interact with #640? Can we merge both?\n. Nice, thanks for implementing it!\n. Hm, try running bower update manually and see what happens. You might be asked to manually select a version of Angular to install\u2014just pick the latest one along the 1.3.x line and you should be fine.\n. Yep, you need to manually type in 1.1. Since minor versions can add new features or introduce deprecations, package managers like to safeguard you from making big version leaps automatically.\nBut if you're cool with that, you can edit your bower.json to look like this:\n\"foundation-apps\": \"~1.1\"\nBy taking out the last number, Bower will automatically update the package to 1.1, 1.2, and beyond.\nLet us know if you're able to upgrade properly. Unfortunately we introduced a bunch of big structural changes to our code in 1.0.2, which doesn't change how you use the framework, but does affect how your Gulpfile needs to work. The release notes for 1.0.2 cover the upgrade process.\n. Yep, that's a bug, see zurb/foundation-cli#11. The CLI is overdue for a new patch, so when that gets out it'll have this fix.\nGlad the upgrade process worked, though! We don't plan on requiring anything substantial like that again for the v1.x line.\n. We prefer using single quotes for all Sass/CSS values. What's the error you're getting?\n. Could you give us any more info on your Webpack setup, or a full console log? I'm trying to figure out if this is an issue specific to sass-loader. If we change these quotes, there's always the chance that a different processor could break, so I'd like to figure out if it's a problem on our end or not.\n. Ah yeah, the 1.0.2 upgrade guide was written before we introduced those two libraries to the template.\nAlso, since you've upgraded, you can remove front-matter and through2 from your dependencies. Those are wrapped up in the front-router package.\n. It is gulp-if, see if that's missing.\n. Yeah, maybe try cleaning out your folder and starting again. The error here is related to through2 being used by vinyl-fs, which is being used by gulp. Dependencies get complicated. But it doesn't appear to be related to the instance of through2 that was being used at the top level.\nTo start over, try:\nbash\nrm -rf node_modules\nnpm cache clean\nnpm install\nAlso, when you run npm uninstall, you need to add --save or --save-dev to make the change stick in your package.json file.\n. Nice! If you have any suggestions for Front Router, let us know.\n. Can you post a stack trace for that error, so we can see where in the code it's being generated?\n. Just published version 1.1.2 of the CLI which fixes this. See zurb/foundation-apps#11\n. We don't have any documentation for it, but we aren't doing anything weird with Angular, so there's no reason it wouldn't work.\nWe don't plan on writing anything in the near future. We're mainly focused on pure web apps, not web-to-native ports.\n. Which template are you using? Is it one from our resources page or the official starter template?\n. Okay, are you running the downloadable templates or the one that's created when you run foundation-apps new app?\nAfter that, what command do you run and what's the error you get?\n. What's the error?\n. The setup for those templates is admittedly fairly messy\u2014we don't even have a good process for updating their dependencies. I can't say this will be fixed soon unfortunately, but we know it's something we need to do.\nI can ask today if we can carve out some time to change those ZIP files.\n. I believe wiredep is the more popular solution these days, but it's also in a state of flux because the Bower community is in the middle of an ongoing discussion on how the main field in bower.json works, so I'm not sure how reliable it is right now.\n. Updated all of the devDependencies in the template, and everything looks solid. Here's the commit.\n. It's in there right now, but not in a stable release. We'll see about getting a patch release out in the next week.\n. Do you mean flagging components that require JavaScript?\n. Are you seeing this in your own project, or just our template?\n. Alright, then it's probably an issue with how the templates are configured rather than the framework. We'll look into it.\n. If the plugin attaches the smooth scrolling behavior to the window, nothing will happen, because Foundation apps don't scroll on the window\u2014they scroll on inner <div> elements.\nPresumably you'd need to configure the plugin to attach to grid elements. You can target .grid-content specifically, because these are the scrolling elements.\n. Is this an accidental PR by chance? The package name has been changed to foundation-apps-custom, so this can't be pulled in as-is.\nAs for Angular 1.4, we haven't tested the framework with it yet, so we're staying on 1.3 for now.\n. Did you get any errors when running npm install -g foundation-cli?\n. Alright, in this case I think the Git clone failed. Does the git command work properly in your environment?\n. I see. The CLI is failing on process.chdir(), which is when it changes directory to the folder that git clone just created. Do you see that folder after running foundation-apps new?\n. Ah, so the issue is Node not being able to shell out to the git command. In that case I assume the CLI would report an error relating to exec('git clone'), but in this case it's not.\n. We haven't tested the framework on 1.4 yet, so stick with 1.3.x if you can. Although there's a decent chance it'll work with 1.4 right away.\n. @soumak77 If you haven't seen any issues, we could introduce a range of 1.3.x to 1.4.x for the Angular dependency.\n. @kuatsure Yes! I want to sweep the recent pull requests soon.\n. @sjenkinsdc Check to see if you have anything else on the port that's running. You can also change the port number on line 148 of gulpfile.js:\njs\ngulp.task('server', ['build'], function() {\n  gulp.src('./build')\n    .pipe($.webserver({\n      port: 8079, // Right here!\n      host: 'localhost',\n      fallback: 'index.html',\n      livereload: true,\n      open: true\n    }))\n  ;\n});\n. Are you referring to deploying this repo, or a project you've created with our project template?\n. Sounds good! zurb/foundation-apps-template#26\n. @soumak77 Thanks for putting this together :) Could you apply these features to the external Front Router plugin as well? We won't be dropping the built-in plugin until after 1.2, but new projects are referencing the external plugin.\n. The current version (1.1) is the correct one, it's just been a while since we put out a patch.\nWe're trying to get one out in the next week or two, but the Foundation team is fairly resource-constrained right now working on Foundation for Sites 6, which is launching very soon.\n. Hey friends, we're going to be releasing version 1.2.0 on Friday. This week we're going to be asking the community what issues are most critical to get resolved this week, and we'll be reviewing every pull request. On Thursday we're QAing the release, and then on Friday we're tagging and deploying it.\nWith Foundation 6 out, we're about to shift our focus back to Foundation for Apps. We're thinking about what version 2.0 will be, but we aren't done with version 1.x by any means. I'm opening a new issue to track what people feel is critical to address this week: #725 Thanks for your patience :)\n. Done!\n. CC @rafibomb \n. The command is now just foundation new, as the CLI has been expanded to support the entire Foundation family. I updated the installation docs to reflect this. Sorry for the hassle!\n. Fixed now, sorry for the confusion.\n. @soumak77 Thoughts?\n. @soumak77 Awesome, thank you! We plan on reviewing every PR before Friday. Are there any particular bugs that you think would be critical? (Granted, this isn't a one-and-done thing, we'll be doing more bug-fixing in the future. But this is our first patch in a while so we want to make it count.)\n. @agianikas Yes, we'll be testing in Angular 1.4. The bower.json will likely be a version range, to allow for 1.3 or 1.4.\n. We put out 1.2.0 on Friday. Thanks so much everyone for recommending bugs and pull requests for us to look at! The changelog includes an overview of our plans for 1.3, which will include a few deprecations, so be sure to take a look.\nIf there's anything that needs done for a patch to 1.2, let us know and we'll get to it. Thanks! :)\n. @soyuka I'd hold off on that for now, although we really appreciate the interest :)\nWe're in the early planning stages of Foundation for Apps 2, and we know we need to do a better job of sharing components between frameworks. So we're currently looking at which components are worth sharing, and how exactly we want to share them.\nHowever, we want to keep the community in the loop so they can contribute, so we'll try to publish our thoughts on that soon.\n. @soyuka I'm interested in exploring this option, although it begs the question \"just how many of those jQuery plugins will we be rewriting in Angular?\"\n. @soumak77 I think @zurbchris (who wrote most all of the JavaScript for Sites 6) is very interested in this idea. You can probably count on two hands the number of jQuery functions that are useful when you need to support IE9: addClass, removeClass, hasClass, extend, on/off (not just for the easier syntax, but for event namespacing also).\nOver time the F4S codebase will rely on jQuery less and less, mostly for speed reasons.\nI think wrapping a series of plain JavaScript plugins in jQuery/Angular is sensible, but I've always wondered: are you losing a core benefit of Angular/React/etc., which is more efficient DOM manipulation? Presumably our plain JS plugin is going to be doing its own manual DOM manipulation, and the wrapper will just be calling those methods. So is it that problematic or not? Or is there a different way to address it that I'm not thinking of?\n. @marleneclayton You can rip the CSS out no problem, if you're fine writing your own JavaScript. There are some .ng- classes in the code, but I think over time we can try to make that stuff more library-agnostic.\n. @hguiney It would be relatively straightforward to import any of the Foundation 5/6 CSS components into an apps project, especially the ones that don't share a name with an Apps component, like flex video.\nWe're currently working on the next iteration of Foundation for Apps, and looking at how we can better share CSS between the two frameworks. Because ultimately, a lot of it is the same.\n. @soyuka We need to solidify some of our thinking before we can announce anything, but we can say Apps 2 will be built on Angular 2.\nI'd like to bring people in as soon as possible to get feedback on our ideas, but we probably won't have anything solid to show for another month.\n. @hguiney Yep, you can install the foundation-sites Bower or npm package alongside foundation-apps. In your Sass file, you'll need to selectively @import things, and then also add the @includes to print the CSS of those components. Looking at the 6 component list, you could bring in:\n- Top bar\n- Callout\n- Media object\n- Table\nOr if you turn off any Apps components, you could bring in the Sites equivalent.\n. @cfator We realized this, which is why Sites and Apps will be more tightly coupled in the future. The two frameworks will share most of their CSS, and the main differentiator will be how the JavaScript is implemented. Apps will still have some special components, like it's unique grid, notifications, etc. And of course Apps will be written in Angular.\n. @soyuka You'll use the two grids in tandem. So in Apps, we have .grid-frame, .grid-block and all that, and that will still exist, but the naming scheme will be different. And we'll do a better job of explaining it so it's not crazy confusing.\nThat grid will be used to carve up the sections of your app, and make your fixed headers and sidebars and so on. And then inside that grid (which we're calling a frame right now), you'll use the traditional 12-column grid.\nWe tried overloading the two core apps grid classes, .grid-block and .grid-content, with these two kinds of functionality, but the more we built with it the more of a hassle we realized it was. So now there will be two grids.\nHere's a possible example. Note that .row replaces .grid-container.\nhtml\n<div class=\"frame vertical\">\n  <div class=\"frame-block shrink\"></div>\n  <div class=\"frame-block\">\n    <div class=\"row\"><!-- ... --></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n. @edhatricksmith I'm no longer with ZURB, so unfortunately I couldn't tell you :< But FYI for y'alls, ZURB is hiring a senior engineer if you want to be a part of the process!\n. This is a newer library, so nobody has written any type definitions for us yet. We don't use TypeScript here at ZURB, so we don't have the knowledge (or time) to put one together ourselves.\nIf you are interested in putting one together, we can promote it on our Resources wiki page. :)\n.

    "ilanbiala": "@smileyj68 any movement gonna happen on this...it's been a couple months.\n. @gakimball oh haha, I did. Let me know if there's anything else I can do to contribute, I'm pretty familiar with Angular and Foundation.\n. Ah I didn't notice that it disappeared from the package.json, I'll retry later today, but do you think you could add it back at some point for convenience sake?\n. Cool!\n. @MichaelFBA refer to #136, it's better to keep separate issues separate.\n. Unrelated, but that thing looks cool. What's it for?\n. Or instead a free heroku instance can just pull the latest every time a commit is made, and rebuild and serve the WIP automatically for anyone to see. Makes experimenting with mobile a lot easier, not to mention the fact that you don't need to clone the repo anymore.\n. Okay. The other thing is maybe trying to make this a little less opinionated. Right now it seems like static serving, and the angular is pretty strict structure. Any thoughts on that?\n. The stack. I would prefer something like foundation-app.min.js with the helpers, and I set it up how I like. The helpers need to be somewhat opinionated to start, until people start using it and suggesting changes. Angular is somewhat opinionated, but it's a really good framework and it seems to be opinionated for the right reasons.\n. @gakimball @zurbrandon since an official release is coming down the pipes in a couple weeks, do you think now would be a good time to throw a website online to start gaining attention and allowing more people to see how it works not just on desktop?\n. YES! Will we be seeing a sample F-apps SPA in addition to some sort of marketing website?\n. Sweet! Thanks guys for all the hard work.\n. @gakimball when can we start contributing to the Foundation CSS and JS parts?\n. Okay. How close would you say it is to having some prereleases/candidates/final builds before 1.0?\n. Okay, I'll start looking over the Angular code, because I'm more experienced with that nowadays.\n. @gakimball Ah okay, I didn't understand, so I just assumed foundation was what was planned to be used.\n. It doesn't really make sense for F-apps to handle how you get data, because that can be done so many different ways and it really depends on what makes the most sense given a current setup that could easily be used. Also, there isn't much of a wrapper that can be written around $resource, $http, and data embedding. It really depends what is easiest to use in F-Apps.\n. @gakimball are there any examples of the Motion UI you guys blogged about earlier in the development process of F-apps?\n. @AntJanus @gakimball For OSX using node-sass is as easy as using ruby sass, much easier for me anyway. There doesn't seem to be one canonical way to manage Ruby gems, and that makes doing the research really annoying and leaves me with no real answer as to what I should do. Setting up Ruby is also much more complicated than Node in my opinion. I prefer node-sass because of that and because it's faster.\n. Also getting this error.\n. The author of gulp-sass advises moving back to 1.1 until 1.2 is stable.\n. I wouldn't close this issue yet, so the f-apps team can keep track of what to do with their deps.\n. Nice.\n. @AntJanus there should be a fix in 1.2.3, so look out to see if it works again.\n. Awesome.\n. Sounds good, I'm looking forward to starting to play around with the framework. Are you guys planning on separating the router and server from f-apps for the RC next week?\n. @AntJanus I'm going to propose something a little different and might mean more work for the developers at Zurb, but I think that it means the work is easier and helps more people at the same time.\nI would set up 2 repos, one just with f-apps split into all the JS files fit for developers who would like to handle the Angular themselves, and one for rapid prototyping that has some structure to it. Then I would set up something like the Bootstrap customize page that would say: \"Rapid prototyping or Minimal F-apps\", and clicking minimal f-apps opens a modal or accordion or something like that which shows the user all the components, and they can select which ones they want, click download, and it will give them a .zip of the customized F-apps. If they select everything (pretty much the whole repo for Angular people), then they would get that with a bower.json inside the .zip or installation instructions from Git so they can update easily if they want to.\nIn the repo made for Angular users, I would probably also put a foundation.min.js, which contains all the JS and can just be put in as a script tag and included as a module in whatever I'm doing.\nI think this satisfies a couple usecases:\n- People who are rapid prototyping and need some guidance\n- People who are doing one-off rapid prototyping with Angular and don't care to Update F-apps, so they just download all the Angular code each time they have a new project\n- People who work on longer Angular projects that would benefit from just being able to do bower update instead of having to compare files from each .zip and cut/copy/paste/delete.\nThe separation probably makes it easier for you guys to develop because you don't need to try to make one codebase work for 2 different types of people. The harder part I think would be the customize page, just because it's a little bit of client work and server work, but I think it should be simple to implement once you know what you want.\nThere are probably still some edge cases, but I think this could be a good starting point for discussion.\n. To make the release process more transparent, can you guys set up some milestones with alpha/beta/rc/1.0 milestones showing what needs to be done by when? That way people can also see how far along things are and if they can start using this in soon-to-be-production projects.\n. Awesome, can't wait!\n. :+1: :) can't wait for 1.0.0\n. @lukens I'm thinking this is a dupe of #79.\n. Awesome, thanks guys! It helps me (probably other people) keep track of what's going on.\n. Can rest-of-components and directive-plugin-migration also be removed?\n. I don't see Bundler mentioned anywhere @gakimball..? Did I miss a spot?\n. Okay I found part of the issue. bower_components seems to actually be public/lib on my computer. So in the gulpfile, all references to bower_components had to be changed, and then the page worked.\n. There's also an error in the parsing of #markdown on the motion-ui page.\n. @AntJanus this is the error I saw.\n. What about JS animation event hooks? Do those help at all?\n. @JamesDullaghan still getting the same 2 errors, though the styles are slightly different. Are you cloning master?\n. The issue is that bower_components hasn't been changed to public/lib in the gulpfile, once I changed that, 0 errors.\n@gakimball @AntJanus why do I need to change it? Is it specific to f-apps, or something in my Bower?\n. thoughts on original issue with bower_components?\n. For some reason that's where Bower downloads the dependencies to in this repository for me. You'll probably want to add a .bowerrc to the template project with some directory set so it overrides everything else, because obviously something is getting overridden for me...\n. Is this using rAF, web animations, pure JS, or something else?\n. Ah okay. Are these for the motion-ui? How would someone add to the set of pre-existing animations? Is it just add the animation to a CSS file, and add the data-motion attribute wherever?\n. Sounds good!\n. Cool, will this fix/make working the motion-ui on the docs?\n. You can just compare straight up file contents to make sure they are equal. I don't think libsass and ruby sass produce different but equivalent css, but if they do, then that might not work.\n. Looks pretty good to me, but I would get a second opinion just to do another look-through.\n. What about whitespace-insensitive diffing? If you ignore all the spaces and new lines, the css should be the same, right?\n. @AntJanus I was playing around, and you could probably just drop the href=\"#\" from all the <a> tags, no? Clicks still work, and the whole routing scheme isn't messed up.\n. The biggest issue I see is that Angular offers a data-binding system and the ability to build \"elements\". Even though those features are coming to HTML and JS soon, not many browsers support it and Vanilla JS might exclude even big browsers like IE, Safari, and possibly Firefox/Chrome in some edge cases. \n. It may be ported afterwards, but for now, let them finish v1 in the first framework until you ask them to make it compatible with the 50+ other ones. I think it's nice enough that they do this to begin with, and anyone who wants it sooner can start porting it themselves and helping Foundation out a little...it is open source after all.\n. I think that adding a <base href=\"/\"> will fix the issue, and it won't be used if HTML5Mode if is turned off.\n. i don't think that's a double. One is rc and one is 1.0.0.\n. Hmm, some conflicts going on here. @gakimball changelog.md also only has RC1 it seems. I think that it's easier for a collaborator to update everything than having @jcs224 change things just in case you guys want them to look a little different or maybe some files are not needed anymore.\n. Ng-cloak should do some good too.\n. programmatic support would be awesome.\n. probably a result of $scope.$apply being called without being inside of a if (!$scope.$$phase)?\n. @gakimball what about locking down sass deps for everything to work, and about every month/minor release, just update and lock to the next stable version until we can do something like ~2.1.2 safely? It makes it much easier to keep the stack all in Node especially because setting up Ruby is pretty complicated if you haven't done it before.\n. @smileyj68 any movement gonna happen on this...it's been a couple months.\n. @gakimball oh haha, I did.

Looks good to me, lets get it merged in! \n. Adding Title Bar to this list\n. We should also have the ability to disable the overlay, any thoughts on how we could get these as the same option?\n. This may help http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25679210/how-to-deal-with-extra-markup-used-for-angular-directives\n. Great Answer @AntJanus! \nI'll close this for now, but feel free to open it back up if that didn't answer fully. \n. Thanks @AntJanus Yeah, thats sums it up pretty well. In the future we're already talking about other JS options, but for V1 we knew we needed to choose. \nThanks for the discussion all, we'll close this for now because as of today this won't change for the launch. \nWe'd LOVE to see a vanilla port however :) \n. Oops this was already an issue. Closing \n. // sounds good\n. This should have been fixed today for the most part, when you upgrade let us know? I'll close this for now. \n. We caught it in QA and totally forgot to make an issue for it. Thanks :) We'll get working on it. \n. This is a firefox issue that they're fixing in January, other tha  that we can't do anything about it. \n. Hey @jamesstoneco Did you still want to take a stab at this or should we try and get a resource to do it this week? \nLet us know :) \n. If you just open a PR thats perfect. Thanks! \n. @AntJanus Looks like the close when you click outside the modal is different than the actual close for the modal. \n. Tabs could use some love for sure, any thoughts or code you'd use would be appreciated. Do you have a specific idea in mind for a PR? \n. I like the ideas on here! We're working on some ideas to give tabs more love, If anyone has a specific idea, we'd love a PR, but for now i'll close this. \n. Thanks! \n. @laurent-le-graverend Sorry about the lack of activity. We're still very committed to making Foundation for apps awesome! We're a little diostarcted with the next versions of Foundation for Sites and Emails, but are so amped and appreciative of the work you've been doing! \n. Thanks for the follow through on this! \n.

It's been months if not a year since maps have been first introduced to Sass so it's safe to tell things are well set up at this point.\nSo the question isn't \"should you be using maps ?\" but \"what for ?\". \n\nWhat is interesting with having a map (or maps), is that you can loop over it, which is obviously not possible with variables. Actually, that's the main reason why maps have been introduced to Sass in the first place: to provide a solution to variable variables. \nHaving an ability to loop over a map is a huge plus when you come to build a living styleguide or basically anything that comes around the project (documentation, exports, ...). It's much more convenient than having a handful of variables to move over.\nAlso as you said, and I fully share your opinion, maps make your code more structured. For instance, this is what our _variables.scss file looks like at work. Definitely easier to read than countless variables in my opinion.\n\nLet me warn you against having a super map. This is indisputably a bad idea.\nFor starter, deep maps can be a pain to update (reading is and will always be the easy part). Updating a 2-levels map is a pain to update manually. Needless to say building a function to dynamically update a nested map is a nightmare...\nMoreover, deep maps tend to be slow. Everything is relative at this point of course but very dense maps can bring some slowness to your app. I'd warn against having more than 3 or 4 nested levels, it's probably too much.\nInstead, try breaking your map into several smaller items. For instance, instead of:\nscss\n$foundation: (\n  button: (\n    // ...\n  ),\n  carousel: (\n    // ...\n  ),\n  dropdown: (\n    // ...\n  )\n);\n... try something like this:\nscss\n$foundation-button: ( ... );\n$foundation-carousel: ( ... );\n$foundation-dropdown: ( ... );\nNot only does it avoid having to deal with deeply nested maps, but it also allows you to move each configuration to its own relevant partial rather than storing everything in the same file (which may or may not be what you want).\n\nAgain, I think I'd advise against using a single function. Actually the name is the biggest flaw here. foundation means nothing (sorry). Pick something that actually makes sense, like map-fetch, then alias it with custom functions.

And given that an awful lot of designers coming from CSS have no programming chops at all, their exposure to the clunky functional elements of Sass is not an ideal first experience. Don't get me wrong; I love Sass, but it seems to be growing into a strange frankenstein's monster.\nI guess my point is that most designers using Sass don't care about the implementation of things like map-get-deep.

The way I get around this issue is to store the values in a large map and then have a function/mixin that allows me to register elements to that map, for example:\n@include register-palette(brand,\n  (\n    primary: $dark-blue,\n    secondary: $mid-blue,\n    tertiary: $light-blue\n  )\n);\nThat way I only need to think in small chunks but everything is stored in a single place.

When you abstract the colour names to something more semantic though is when this kind of thing becomes interesting. However, I'm not convinced that just having a button (for example) do button: palette(button, color) is much better. It still atomises the colour configuration so that maybe button, tab, badge and whatever else are all making separate calls to pull in the same colour value. This does make more sense if there is a system in place to inject theme values into all components so that this duplication becomes a product of the theming, not a maintenance pain.\nTo be honest, I'm feeling more and more that breaking out colours like this is fine for examples of what can be done with Sass maps, but is really only part of a wider issue. If we are going to configure colours, then why not background images, border-styles, text-shadow and other decorative styles (as opposed to behavioural or layout styles) that are widely used in theming components. What I think everyone is looking for is a way to theme every component in a project and colour is just one strand of this. Why should setting a background-color be treated any differently than setting a gradient background?\nI also think if you are going down a settings route, media queries have to be factored in. This can be true of decorative styles and is absolutely true of layout.\n. @gakimball I think you're bang on the money when you make that distinction between those that know Sass and those that know CSS. Once of the projects I'm currently involved in involves on-boarding designers to a Sassy codebase and I've really had to take a step back and look at it from their perspective and it's quite shockingly complex. It's easy to sell variables, but when you start explaining a mixin that calls a function that does a lookup on a map using a strange functional style to someone who is used to pure CSS you can hear the gears grinding to a halt. \nThat said, there has to be a way to leverage Sass to make setting properties across breakpoints cleaner. I'm currently experimenting with using a rhythm unit; single, double, half, quarter etc that can be dropped in as a value for padding or margin and is adjusted automatically across breakpoints from a centralised configuration. For example, by default, single might equate to rem(10), but at medium it opens out to rem(13). This is massively reducing the number of disparate and repeated values through a project and greatly encourages consistency. \n\nbecause you can't reference another place in the map while it's still being defined.\n\nThis is indeed a real drag, but if you break the mega-map into multiple maps including a few base maps, this can be (largely) negated. It is also worth thinking about these maps as a point where configuration is stored as opposed to a place where configuration is defined. This ties into my comments earlier on theming. \nI think this (configuration and it's half-brother setting properties across breakpoints) is currently an unsolved problem but I think there is enough flexibility in Sass that there is a good solution out there.\n. @AshleyAitken Where do you draw the line though between what should and shouldn't be configured on a breakpoint by breakpoint basis? Font-size, line-height, box-properties, offsets, sizes and even things like background image, font-smoothing are all props which often need to change at different breakpoints. The real advantage of using maps is that they allow relationships and nesting and more importantly, they don't rely on predefined keys / names.

    "AntJanus": "@gakimball glad I read this! I already started migrating stuff over, I'll hold off until we can talk about it.\n. @gakimball I think that we can safely merge this down now. \n. @gakimball I'll go ahead and give that a shot. It makes sense to mask all of that functionality, I just keep thinking ahead programmatically, not in terms of simplicity! :) \nI think that behind the scenes, I'll run an angular modal service that will broadcast to all the modal directives via the fa-model-open and similar directives. When the name matches, an action will be triggered. That'll make it much easier for everyone to use (since they won't have to touch angular) and will allow us to sidestep controllers.\nHopefully that won't be too difficult! :)\n. @gakimball so the directive is ready to go in but I noticed some structural changes that we should probably discuss.\nWe currently have two folders for both styling and JS. One at the root of the folder, and one inside the client folder. We should probably decide firmly where we want to put the files permanently. I think we could argue both ways.\nPros&Cons of having it in the client folder:\n- The client folder speaks for itself and is the entire project in its raw form\n- it makes it clear that anything outside of the client folder is a supporting file (Gulp, readme, etc.)\n- the con is that you have to go 4 directories deep in order to open a single file (client/assets/js/;angular)\nHaving it at the root:\n- easier to access\n- easy to find files at a glance in the repo\n- source is intermixed with supporting files\nI'm not sure which way I lean. If we had a back-end, I'd definitely throw everything in the client folder but we don't, and this is a front-end only framework. On the other hand, if anyone wants to implement a back-end, it'd make more sense if everything was in the client folder (and the back-end in a server folder).\nThoughts on this?\n. @gakimball Alright, so in that case, I'll keep things as they are since the Angular stuff is mostly a \"library\" sort of thing rather than something I'd let users dig around in. \n. @gakimball Awesome, then, I'll restructure the listeners array to favor access by ID. I'm sure if we stumble on an edge-case where we need the deep structure, I'll just refactor it. Luckily, it's all behind-the-scenes stuff. :) \nAnyways, cool, I'll add that functionality right away. \n. For anyone wondering, I've finally implemented the template loading for interchange. This means that all the scenarios within an interchange directive get collected, saved, and the appropriate partial/template gets loaded (initially).\nJust an FYI, this is a huge breakthrough since the directive has essentially replaced ng-if and ng-include and even uses the templateCache. Now I just need to find a way to fire off the resize hook every time the window resizes! :) Shouldn't be an issue!\n. And interchange is officially working! Some features that are missing (but will be available):\n1. [x]  compiling prebuilt media queries the same way that foundation does it (by creating a meta element and checking its font-family property)\n2. adding custom media queries programmatically (will probably be part of FoundationApi)\n3. implement the matchMedia library as an AngularJS injectable module\nAt this point, I'm thinking that there needs to be better organization to the template files. I'm pretty much just throwing each directive I add on there without any documentation or without any clue as to how it works.\nOn top of that, it'll be a good idea to implement testing! ProtractorJS should be sufficient for that :)\n. @gakimball you mean comment-like internal documentation, external documentation (similar to how Angular's docs work) or something like Javadoc (<- not a big fan of those).\n. Sounds good. I'm continuously refactoring to make things more sensible but I'll definitely comment the code better. I'm really not a big fan of JSDoc so I'm glad we're on the same page! :)\n. @t1mmen just fixed it! :)\n. @gakimball I'm trying to decide on something here. Should the directive add all the necessary classes? That way you have to only write:\nhtml\n<div>\n   <div fa-tab-href=\"tabId\">Tab 1</div>\n</div>\n<div fa-tab-content>\n   <div fa-tab id=\"tabId\">Tab content!</div>\n</div>\nOr should the user be allowed to pick their own classes and thus they'd have to add all the necessary classes. I'm on the fence. \nOn the one hand, I feel like the mechanism of tab switching should be free of styling (so that it could be used anywhere else with different classes, and even different purposes), on the other hand, it'd be nice to have everything neatly packaged.\nWith classes:\nhtml\n<div class=\"tabs\">\n  <div  fa-tab-href=\"tabId\" class=\"tab-item\">Tab 1 </div>\n</div>\n<div fa-tab-content class=\"tab-content\">\n  <div fa-tab id=\"tabId\" class=\"tab-pane\">\n    Test content\n  </div>\n</div>\n. If anyone is wondering why the tons of commits and the hold-ups, it's because of a bug that sets an ID across all tabs directives rather than just for one specific one. This causes all tabs to update from a single tab navigation.\nIt's, safe to say, frustrating.\n. @gakimball @zurbrandon this is ready, w0000t! :) I had to change the syntax a bit but everything works as it should. \n. More improvements (internal):\n- [x] switch is-active DOM manipulation with ng-class={is-active: active} for a more \"angular-like solution\"\n- [x] enable non-hash URLs (requires the use of historyApi middleware).\n- [x] enable \"E\" restriction on component directives, no need to restrict to \"attribute\"\n- [ ] ~~update docs with new elements (might be worth it to add a code directive for displaying code snippets)~~\n. @davidkpiano the animations are class-based but for the fade example, everything is simple, just append an \"in\" and an \"out\". It gets more complicated for your second example:\nanimation: slide\nWould this mean that you're sliding in from the left/right/top/bottom? Would you slide out the same way? Or would you slide out the opposite way? The example in the docs is probably not a real-world example, the real world example would be:\nanimationIn: slideInLeft\nanimationOut: slideOutRight\nTo simulate a slideshow or something.\n. @richbai90 for a large-scale application, I'm not sure if I would recommend using the routing method in FA since it's aimed at designers and developers that aren't entirely familiar with Angular. However, i think it's an interesting concept: having a JS object define all of the routes and dynamically injected into the application at run time. I'd say it makes it easier to edit routes and have a quick overview since the default ui-router declaration requires a ton of piping of state. \nBut obviously, in the case of the JS object, you can't take advantage of resolve or other similar features.\n. @kenwheeler I've been following the discussion and it looks like Angular 2.0 is not even close to ready. The announcement was made around a spec rather than an actual working prototype. There has been a lot of interesting discussion about it! :)\n. @rafibomb I already considered that but since we have only two controllers and they need each other, I found no reason to separate them. Plus, since we're not adding any additional controllers (and probably won't be), I can't justify making a folder with two controller files and adding those into dependencies, and try to cross-dependency them as well.\n. @gakimball this branch was supposed to allow non-hash URLs but it seems like we're testing out a new server. Kudos on that since we can use that plugin and my solution together. I made a couple of adjustments and this branch will be able to enable that feature plus clean up a bunch of stuff.\nWe can merge this in ASAP! :)\n. @gakimball can you look over this real quick? :) We got a working accordion directive! w00t!\n. @Martinspire there was a discussion on it and the thing is that SASS for Ruby is ahead of libsass (the cross-platform version of Sass used with Node) which means that Foundation for Apps can stay more cutting edge; however, some of the necessary features ARE getting implemented into Libsass so hopefully, we'll be able to switch right back! :)\nAnd again, I'm a Windows dev too so I feel you on the speed thing, Sass takes somewhere between 2-15 seconds to compile depending on Ruby's mood.\n. @Martinspire just as a sidenote, I'm a window guy, developing the angular side solely on a windows machine.  :)\nAs far as sudo, you're right, it should be \"open a CMD with administrative privileges\". I can go ahead and add some of this information to the readme. However, I'm not entirely sure what the entire process would be as I'm using a combination of Cmder (which comes with Msysgit), Chocolatey (a package manager), Unix tools for Windows and JRuby instead of Ruby (I've heard it has better support). \nUsing the Node installer though is pretty much the right way to go, I believe it sets the correct environment variable during install (so you can use it in the command line).\nSo how does this sound?\n1. Install Ruby with the official installer or use JRuby alternative.\n2. Install Msysgit to get Git. It might be worth looking into using Cygwin or Cmder both of which come with Msysgit and offer more feature-full console/terminal experience\n3. Since Windows does not have a sudo command, make sure your command line is running with administrative priveleges (right-click or shift-right-click and select \"Run as administrator...\")\nGood? If you have any input on the process, let me know! \n. I've just updated the README with these notes.\n. I generally never have to run as Admin and I will admit that I have a bad habit of doing so. I set u my CMD shortcut to automatically prompt administrative rights. Mainly because I hate having to relaunch my command prompt. I use CMDer and pretty much live in the command prompt so I don't ever open a prompt from a directory.\n. @gakimball I was working on a few tests this morning and found myself refactoring a bunch of the code and fixing several bugs (yay for somewhat TDD). I'd like to merge this in by the end of the week to get those bugs resolved if that's cool. We'd also have some initial tests to setup and work on in the future when necessary :)\n. @gakimball yep! I'll integrate the gulp-karma plugin when I get a chance.\n. @jakeleboeuf thanks! It turns out that I committed on master rather than a feature branch >.< so there's a half-built module with syntax issues. I deleted it and everything is in order now. \n. @jakeleboeuf Ahh! I issued a fix for that yesterday, it looks like it was overwritten by accident. Pull the latest master and you'll see it working!\nThe issue was that I was concating all the output css files and what that did was merge the app.css.map into the app.css.\nThanks for reporting these errors! :)\n. Issues:\n- [x] actionsheet causes block to scroll (possibly wrong class usage on the parent element on my end) \n- [x] popup shows up in the wrong place\n- [x] popup does not stay in place when scrolling - tether does not watch for scroll events in successive parents. (tether behavior mentioned in docs)\n- [x] custom actionsheet button causes actionsheet to show up in the wrong place. - tether doesn't seem to be the right solution for this (solved by allowing custom trigger elements within the container).\n. @gakimball I think this is just about ready to go if you want to do some peer review on it. I changed the actionsheet to work like so:\n``` html\n\n\nMy content!\n\n custom buttons \n\nMy better button\nMy content!\n\n```\n. @gakimball \nI can make sure that each directive accepts a \"onOpen\" and \"onClose\" function in the declaration. So as long as you specify a function in your controller, you can pass it along and have it fired like so:\n``` js\n//within controller\nscope.onModalClose = function() {\n  alert('are you sure?');\n}\n//on a directive\n\n```\nThis is how some other angular libraries solve the issue. Internally, the directive will make sure that onModalClose() gets run when its deactivating itself.\nI think that would be the best solution.\nOutside of that, there are some other things we can do:\n1. We can use a common FoundationApi emitter. So for example, each directive, on any action would publish through the API a generic \"event\" with a payload that describes the event like so ['modal', 'my-id', 'close']. That way anyone can just add a listener for the generic event and check if(whateverId == payload[1] && payload[2] == 'close') { }.\n2. We could also create non-generic events. So for instance, there could be a generic modal event which would tell us what the actual event was (like close). Or even more specifically a modal-close. All running through the FoundationApi\n3. We can use Angular's built-in event system described in this neat stackoverflow answer, which would mean that someone could hook into these events WITHOUT having to use FoundationApi. This is, obviously, not a great idea for any internal functionality but for something that's publicly exposed, might be worth looking into\nWhat do you think?\nnote there IS another option and it's already functional. Since anyone can hook into FoundationApi, they can just do this:\njs\nfoundationApi.subscribe('id-of-an-element-they-watch-for', function(payload) {\n   if(payload == 'active') {\n    //perform some logic\n  }\n});\n. @gakimball I merged in some of the branches, cool if I merge in this one? I'm not sure if there is any more work to be done here.\n. @gakimball So here's the gulp plugin. We'll have to move this to another repo if we want to push this out to NPM!\n. @gakimball well, it requires the foundation.init.js package that initializes the routing for it to work. I can keep it in a /bin folder for the time being or I can open a new repo (though I'm not good with names so I'll need some help!) and push it out to NPM, put it down as a dependency.\n. @gakimball I'll go ahead and merge this in then, and keep the plugin in a /bin directory for now. We can move it and change it as we go.\n. @gakimball I know we were going to create an markdown-based site docs, but would this suffice for the time being? I can even leave a note in the main README.md or I can rename it to ANGULAR.md and leave it at the root.\nThoughts?\n. @gakimball added, as far as the first link with the asset/template loading, that bug was fixed in the core library over a year ago.\n. @gakimball I keep seeing people wondering about the Angular documentation, would it make sense to merge this down? Or should I rewrite as part of all of the docs templates?\n. @gakimball sure thing. \n. PR is up\n. @zurbrandon do you mean in this case:\nhtml\n<fa-action-sheet>\n   <fa-as-button></fa-as-button>\n</fa-action-sheet>\nI can't replace it with fa-toggle since that directive already has certain logic that is generalized to work with all directives. The fa-as-button is a directive that handles the default button logic and templating. Unfortunately, I can't merge the logic of the two without adding lots of complexity.\n. @zurbrandon I didn't realize there were options for that but I'm adding them now, can you give me an example of the color class and the class that pins the notification in different places?\nAlso, as far as the static vs. dynamic notifications go, the reason the directives don't look the same is because the directive that fires a dynamic notifications has to contain all of the notification information while not being the notification itself while the static notification is just that, and can be toggled just like many of the other directives we have. I can't really make it more consistent than it is.\nOtherwise, there has to be some kind of a directive tag on the page to serve as an endpoint for the notifications. I don't really see a way around it, it's the container for the internal logic.\n. @zurbrandon andddd behavior standardized with #69 \n. Crap, I'll need to wait for the libsass branch to merge in -.-\n. @gakimball phew, that worked. Unfortunately, I have to keep this issue open until node-sass gets a fix. Gulp-sass doesn't even require a specific node-sass version so I can't even downgrade that to get the right node-sass version :/\n. @viztastic somewhat related. Unfortunately, node-sass requires both Python to be installed and Visual Studio (the express version at least). Here's the link to installation requirements: https://github.com/sass/node-sass#install\n@gakimball I'm thinking that this is getting a little crazy. Installing Ruby + Sass is much faster and easier than having to install Python and all this other crap. I'm not sure how the requirements are for OS X but since OS X already has Ruby pre-installed, this avenue may prove easier for both systems.\n. @jwvanderbeck I would definitely expect people to use Express with proper configuration for production and something like Forever to run the Node process rather than Gulp. That'd be non-nonsensical. You're on the right track. \nI would say that this stack is great for rapid prototyping and developing though :) \n. Did bower install all of your components correctly? That'd be the first place to check. Open up bower_components in your folder and check to see if those files are there or not.\n. @3lfist just fixed it, do a git pull to get the fix. Not sure why bower install wasn't run. The reason it's not in the docs is because it should run automatically with npm install (it's specified to do so in the package.json).\nLet me know if you hit on any other errors. I'm already aware of some issues for Windows users regarding libsass. \n. hmmm...strange. Okay. Can you give me the output of Gulp? Were there any errors? If you're getting a \"Cannot GET /\", that sounds like the copy task failed.\n. @3lfist hmm.. okay. Can you check if you have a build folder? And if you do, check if everything is in there (like index.html, assets/, etc.). If it's there, try to kill the gulp process and refresh localhost:8080. I wonder if there is a stray Node process that might be running and giving you trouble.\nIf you get the same message, that means you have a Node process running interfering with your new server. If you have a Mac, use the Activity Monitor and look for a \"node\" process and kill it. And try again.\nLastly, at the risk of sounding like a typical IT person, would you mind deleting all the node_modules and bower_components, doing a git pull again and rerunning the install process?\n. @3lfist you shouldn't have to sudo it. I see one problem already: there is no index.html. So for some reason, that's not getting copied. That's the heart of the issue.\nI'm on a Ubuntu VM and am experiencing the same problem so I'll go ahead and troubleshoot this on my machine and let you know how I got it resolved.\n. @3lfist issue is fixed. Just do a git pull. It seems like both OS X and Windows are forgiving when it comes to capitalizing folder names. Ubuntu, however, is not :)\n. @gakimball ah....well then, I'll go undo my work and rename the folder!\n. @gakimball urgh, so, changing uppercase to lowercase is turning out to be quite a task. \n. @gakimball phew, a few rebases, and forceful git pushes and it's good to go. :)\n. @jwvanderbeck please do a git pull, this issue has been resolved: https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/blob/master/js/angular/app.js#L24-L26\n. @jwvanderbeck :) everything is still being worked on quickly so things are bound to break once in a while.\n. @jwvanderbeck if you do a git pull, the issue will resolve itself, everything is set to 1.3.1 now.\n. On a sidenote, yay for automated testing! \n. Issues so far:\n- [x] interchange no longer renders on-page partials\n- [x] displaced tabs don't show up\n- [x] static notification doesn't fire.\n- [x] popup doesn't work\n. It looks liek\n. @gakimball btw, so here is the Iconic wrapper. It works simply:\n<div iconic>\n    <img data-src=\"#\" data-fallback=\"#\" ... /> // regular iconic declaration\n</div>\nThe Iconic directive fires an \"inject\"' on its child when invoked which makes Iconic register the icon and replace the <img> tag with its SVG declaration. \nThe reason a parent element is required is because the second the img gets replaced with an svg and kills all the bindings, including the directive and any other directives. The issue with that is that if we use ng-if or even ng-class on it, those will cease to function. This approach was recommended on the forums for this specific reason.\nI think the only way we could side-step this is to inform users that they cannot apply any logic to the icon img files. This would lead to a cleaner syntax:\n<img iconic data-src=\"#\" data-fallback=\"#\" ... /> //standard iconic declaration\n. @gakimball unfortunately, no, not without a parent element to keep track of it. I'll go ahead and make the change. \n. Right, the entire idea is to wrap it with whatever you want to use it for. But yeah, if you have a click event, it'd make more sense to wrap an img with an anchor.\n. @gakimball sweet! So those will be part of this repo?\n. I'm aware of the issue, the CI currently tries to run gulp-sass on the latest version on every test. We've got our first passing build today so this issue has been resolved.\n. Yep, the master branch is passing. I'll have to test it on my machine and solidify the dependency when I get a chance.\nThanks for the heads up!\n. Anddd updated.\n. @jwvanderbeck You're on the right track. In fact, the app.js is meant for the rapid prototyping for users that don't want to learn/use angular explicitly. If you're not a fan and want to run your own code, or get rid of the dynamic routing, just erase this line:\nFoundationStateProvider.registerDynamicRoutes();\nThis is part of the foundation.init module, which also runs this line in app.js:\nfoundationInit.init();\nYou're welcome to delete those and run your own thing. Unfortunately, foundationInit.init() initializes some things, and one of them is the setup for interchange so without the module, interchange won't work.\nOne thing is clear, I really need to add all the inter-dependencies so that Angular can warn you if you're missing something. Pretty much all directives depend on common.* for FoundationApi and all of the basic fa-open/fa-close directives. These are located in js/angular/common.\nI started on some documentation, and you can check it out here, it's on another branch and should answer most of your questions.\nThe point of this entire thing was actually not to make it dependent on the structure. Everything should be portable, everything should be a module that you can easily inject. \nLet me know if that makes any sense! :)\n. @ilanbiala @jwvanderbeck I don't have time right now to write out a full response but both of what you are proposing we're already doing:\n- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template <- this is a startup repo that's meant to be a full-on solution for someone that doesn't want to mess with things. Though, they still can.\n- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps <- this is the main code repository. Bower install it, use what you want to use.\nNothing is tied to the app.js nor anything else. You can carry over whatever files you want to use. The app.js is a full-on solution but there is nothing forcing you to use it or even reference it. Use bower install, use gulp to include all of the files in the subfolders of js/angular: common, directives, partials, etc. and build your own App.js. DI is there for a reason, so that you don't have to use everything but only what you want/need. If you only need modals, use those, and don't include any of the other components in your build process, and just reference it in your app.js DI so that they're loaded into your app. \nWant to update? No problem, do a bower update and you'll get fresh everything (once there is a release and proper versions).\nMeanwhile, designers can indulge in f-apps-template which brings over all the logic from f-apps but with your own templates to use. And you still get the updates via bower install. \nI'll have to get back to everyone when I have time for it (probably on Monday). But does that not cover it? \n. Very exciting! :)\n. @ilanbiala I was under the impression that a native forEach loop wasn't fully supported across browsers. I'll keep angular.forEach for the time being.\n. @ilanbiala I checked the es5 support chart, looks like I'm a little behind times. Thanks for that catch! :)\n. Try using the Angular directives:\nhtml\n<div fa-panel id=\"my-panel\">panel content</div>\n<a href=\"#\" fa-toggle=\"my-panel\">toggle panel</a>\n. @jwvanderbeck hmm. What does your app.js look like? I wonder if you're missing a dependency or something. Did any errors show up in your console?\nCase #2 is the correct usage so I'm wondering why it's not firing. it works fine on this end.\n. Ah, yeah, that was a bug that was fixed some time ago. The has function is part of jQuery and was replaced with another. \n. @jwvanderbeck sure thing. It's a little difficult since f-apps hasn't had a first release yet so it's one of those \"move fast, break things\" situations. \n. @jwvanderbeck the app is not broken. I just did a git clone and started a brand new project, the panel works as it should. \nI think the confusion comes from the docs files that are currently not up to date. When you're running the base app, check out localhost:8080/playground or the docs/templates/page.html file to see how it's supposed to work in Angular. That's the working version. \nIf that doesn't help, please, either create a repo for your app so I can check it out and troubleshoot it or post your application bootstrap file or html. I'm not entirely sure where things could have gone wrong.\n. Yep, duplicate. Closing it out. \n. good idea, I'll set that up\n. Anddd done. Perfect, it errored because gulp-sass could not compile the SASS correctly.\n. yep, it works. I'll go ahead and merge this in. We'll have a broken build, however, until node-sass gets a fix. \n. yeah, I just removed some of the other older branches that I kept up.\n. Whoops, i deleted them this morning, forgot to mention it!\n. @ilanbiala can you elaborate on the error? I'm not seeing it.\n. Since this was already fixed in another issue, I'm closing it. Let me know if you have any further trouble.\n. I've identified the issue, the fix should be out tomorrow. \n. The docs aren't fully finished but the issue is fixed.\n. The problem is how Angular handles its animations and how the UI Router delegates it. Angular has some cool helper classes like .ng-enter and .ng-enter-active. The animate module is as close you as you can get. It works..well, mostly. \n. @gakimball In a moment of epiphany, I realized why the \"flashing\" issues might be here (add fadeIn and the content fade outs and fades back in). One of them is that the transition timing and controls are on that element itself. That means that to get to an initial state, fadeIn will fade the element back out.\nIf there was a way to add an intermediate step, we could have our cake and eat it, too. Meaning that we could have an \"initial state\" (which would be opacity:0), an animated state (transition-* properties) and finally a final state (opacity: 1). I don't want to get into a class-itis type of deal but that seems to be a good way to solve the issue: go immediately to initial state, add transition timing and properties, animate to final state. Perhaps we could have a fadeIn class, a fadeIn-transitions class, and a is-active to activate the animation.\nThoughts?\n. @jpdesigndev I'd remove all of those classes once the animation is done. I'm not sure how the repaint works but I'm guessing the browser is forced to do so during the animation anyways. \n. @gakimball this seems to be working. well, mostly. For the active classes, there's a space between class selectors so that instead of .fadeIn.ng-enter.ng-enter-active, there's .fadeIn.ng-enter .ng-enter-active. I add the enter/enter-active classes manually which makes me wonder why having the previous is-active way of initializing animations didn't work. \nThe enter/enter-active classes don't get automatically added for programmatic solutions.\n. Yeah, the CSS looks a bit wonky:\n```\n.fadeIn.ng-enter {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transition-property: -webkit-transform, opacity;\n  transition-property: transform, opacity;\n  transition-duration: 700ms;\n  transition-timing-function: ease;\n  transition-delay: 0; }\n  .fadeIn.ng-enter.ng-enter-active, .fadeIn.ng-enter .ng-leave-active {\n    opacity: 1; }\n.fadeOut.ng-leave {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transition-property: -webkit-transform, opacity;\n  transition-property: transform, opacity;\n  transition-duration: 700ms;\n  transition-timing-function: ease;\n  transition-delay: 0; }\n  .fadeOut.ng-leave.ng-enter-active, .fadeOut.ng-leave .ng-leave-active {\n    opacity: 0; }\n```\nNow if only I understood SASS as much as I would like to, lol\n. Anddd done. I used a trick from Angular's internal ngAnimate code to stop the transition from happening internally, using a $rootScope.$digest to force a reflow/repaint, removing the transition block, and appending an end-state class to trigger the transition. Sweet.\n. This should be ready to merge. :)\n. Gulp-sass gets continually tested by Travis-CI every time we push a commit. It's a good gauge as to what version currently works. I'm thinking of locking it down once we get a green light from Travis.\n. Ah.. makes sense. Thanks I'll get that fixed.\n. Got a fix in the works.\n. Hmm, it looks like a deeper issue based on your screenshot. Can you show me the output of gulp? Some of the files seem like never compiled.\n. I don't believe the docs have live examples at the moment. Go to http://localhost:8080/playground to see all the components in action! :)\n. So, are you still having the same trouble? If you are, when gulp is done building, check the build/assets/js folder and see if there is a routes.js file. If it is, check it out inside and see if there is a var foundationRoutes in there with a long object definition.\n. Hmm, that's strange, removing foundationRoutes should make the application unusable. Are you on the latest commit? \n. @mikehuebner can you confirm if this is still an issue or not? Some things have changed in the codebase. If the problem still persists, I can try helping you troubleshoot it further.\nI'll go ahead and reopen this when you let me know.\n. Yay! =D\n. That last error means that you have another process running under port 8080. If you have WAMP or Ruby or any other server running on that port, shut it down. \nExit out of any Node processes as well and if you do, check your task manager (advanced view) to see if Node is still running. This can happen once in a while and used to be happen to me all the time on a Mac. \nIf you STILL can't make it work and still get the same error, check out this stackoverflow question and scroll down to the Resource Monitor answer and run that. And again, check port 8080 for what could be blocking your Node process.\n. @ilanbiala can you clarify for me the following comment:\n\nThe issue is that bower_components hasn't been changed to public/lib in the gulpfile, once I changed that, 0 errors.\n\nwhere is public/lib coming from?\n. @jpdesigndev do you mean dynamically? It wouldn't scale plus it's no simple task hunting down all of the possible absolutely-positioned objects in the view to move it outside of the view while trying to make sure the view animations don't happen until all of the objects have been moved.\nNon-dynamically? (as in, actually just change the DOM so I don't have to deal with the problem) Yeah, that can be done but that's just avoiding a problem, plus it introduces a slew of other issues (like having to force users to declare off-canvas, panels, and other elements in their index.html).\n. No problem :)\n. that panel thing we talked about yesterday is exactly it!\n. yep, that'd work. I'll test it out.\n. Fixed\n. @gakimball I've written a pretty neat animate service that lives under the foundationApi (I might move it, not sure) but it has two methods:\n1. animate - which works VERY similarly to how our view animation works\n2. toggleAnimate - which works how our element animation works -> by toggling the active class\nI'm hoping to use these two methods to replace how animation works on the elements we discussed: panel, offcanvas, and notification. However, I can't append any extra animation information to these elements since these elements have built-in animation (.panel.is-active for instance). I'd love to get these out of the standard definition and into the service I've written.\nSo, for instance for panel, I could write in the directive definition that slideFromLeft (or wherever) is the default animation and to use toggleAnimation to activated it or deactivate it. If the user declares both animationIn and animationOut, we'd use that animation instead.\nWhat do you think?\nEDIT And we could add this logic to any element that uses foundationApi (most directives) and allow these options. It's a 4-5 liner in terms of directive logic.\n. @ilanbiala angular and the foundation structure to trigger animation. Plain JS and Angular's built-in features to add and remove CSS classes, do resets, and reflows. And finally, CSS transformations for the animation itself.\n. @gakimball this is pretty much ready to go. I'll fix the merge conflicts and we can get this into master! :)\n. @gakimball there are plenty of Node libraries that do very quick diffing. I can wire up some rudimentary unit test that will import the gulp-sass and gulp-ruby-sass stylesheets and see if they're equal. We can employ that. It'd be an interesting test to see what the differences between the libraries are. \n. @gakimball I got the test prototype setup, not sure how well it's working but I'll get it working. For now though, I'm going to push this off as a low priority?\n. @gakimball whoops, look like one place I forgot to change fa to zf. I'll  check the rest of the project.\n. @gakimball this is ready :)\n. The docs aren't functional yet. Clicking on a link that has a href=\"#\" causes that error. It'll be fixed once the docs are finished.\n. To explain what's happening here (and explain why the test is set to automatically pass):\n1. the two CSS files differ greatly. According to JsDiff, there are ~300 CSS rules that do not match. On top of that, libsass likes to list selectors in a single line while ruby-sass likes to list them vertically (one selector per line).\n2. Because I'm on windows, and libsass uses windows executable, line endings are Windows style (^M if you view it in VIM), this means that this is probably throwing off the diffing lib. For some reason, these line-endings are present only in comments.\n3. The diffing lib sometimes fails. I haven't found a library that could diff everything correctly. The JsDiff comes close by being able to do a diffCss rather than line-by-line or whatever else.\nI'd love to see if there is any work done on this elsewhere because it seems like a big problem if you have up to 300 mismatched CSS rules. (or they could be false positives).\nI'll be merging this in as is until a better solution is presented.\n. Dead links in the docs will do that. That will be fixed by v1 I believe. I made an off-shoot from the docs for testing and developing all of the components: http://localhost:8080/#!/playground if you go through there, you'll see the Angular components right at work. if you check out the corresponding raw files, you'll find the syntax to use. \n. @ilanbiala the href=\"#\" is there in order to have a regular link pointer. If it still goes through and messes up, there's something wrong in the way it's setup so that's a good thing to keep in mind. Is it still messing up somewhere?\n@goids the playground was deleted upon release. It was a place for me to rapidly develop and since everything is now in the docs, there was no need for it anymore.\n. What we can do is setting overlay to exist when overlay-close is set to true (no sense in allowing overlay-close if there's no overlay), and allow independent setting of the overlay with overlay=\"true\"\n. @zurbrandon problem, so I made the change but without the overlay, the modal doesn't show up correctly. Is there any other class I can substitute to make it work correctly?\n. @zurbrandon can you give me the proper markup for a modal? I think it's changed way too much since I originally wrote the directive.\n. @zurbrandon I have a (potential) fix in one of the other branches, hopefully it'll work! :)\n. @ilanbiala thanks for the catch. It looks like I left the scope.apply in the wrong place. It was supposed to be run after FoundationApi informs the tab that it needs to activate. It's required there because when FoundationApi triggers an update within a directive, AngularJS doesn't go through its regular digest cycle (no DOM changes happen).\n. This is a duplicate of #122.\nSome of the Docs aren't completely ready. This should be fixed in v1. Check out the playground: http://localhost:8080/#!/playground  It's a place where I test all of the Angular development and all of the directives work there.\n. Thanks for the catch! I'll get on it.\n. @josteinhanssen so I fixed the programming error; however, I haven't gotten to the styles.\nI'll have to leave in the skilled hands of @gakimball. There seem to be some IE CSS bugs. \n. @antjanus note to self: get this done. \n. Sure thing. If you check out the angular readme for FA, you'll find some examples there. But here's how it works in a nutshell.\nYou have to have a parent view, let's call it mail and it'd have a declaration like so:\n``` html\nname: mail\nurl: /mail\n\nThis is your mail!\n\n\n```\nThen you can have a child view. Let's say, it's out inbox:\n``` html\nname: mail.inbox\nurl: /inbox\n\n This is your inbox!\n```\nAnd that it's. It'll be now accessible via the composed url of /mail/inbox. To access inbox, you'd do a <a href=\"#\" ui-sref=\"mail.inbox\">Inbox!</a>, no matter where you're at, even if you're in the parent view. Ui-router may have a shorthand if you're accessing a child view, but stick to putting down the full name.\nDoes that make sense? \nEDIT\nThere are also other ways to create a child with a different naming scheme. Let me redo the inbox with it:\n``` html\nname: inbox\nurl: /inbox\nparent: mail\n\n```\nThis way, you can use ui-sref like so ui-sref=\"inbox\". I could be wrong (I'm not near my code right now) but test it out! :)\n. Foundation for Apps is all Angular with nothing back-end falling into it so it should fit neatly into MEAN. Since, doesn't MEAN stand for: Mongo, Express, Angular, Node? All of the components are decoupled and have a single dependency necessary to function correctly, the FoundationApi service. You can also import the common directives module which houses some hookups for FoundationApi that you'd probably have to write yourself anyways (like a event handlers that open/close/toggle foundation components).\nThe ui router components of FA aren't necessary for any of the components to work; however, they are necessary to work with the templating system we created which is almost jekyll-like with front matter deciding routes, child/parent relationships, title, and animations. Along with that, there's an animation component which depends on this front matter templating. However, all of that is optional. And if you DO want to use it, you can still plug in most of that logic to any other Angular project; however, it WILL take some work.\nOutside of that, you're free to do whatever with it and should work with any Angular setup. \nAs far as MeteorJS/Blaze, I'm not aware of either of those playing well with Angular but I'm not well versed in using either technology. So, shortly said, it's the same deal as MEAN with the added complexity of \"does Angular at all work well with Meteor?\"\n. V1 is focused on Angular. It's the most proliferate MVC framework out there by far. It also fits the prototype paradigm really well. If you're venturing out beyond Angular, you should be able to port the interactions by yourself without a problem (it's easy to do with jQuery, easy with VanillaJS, should be simple enough with everything else); Angular is used to add a bunch of sugar on top for Angular devs and for designers that don't want to deal with programming but want better prototyping tools.\nRegular foundation includes a jQuery version.\nAs far as VanillaJS:\n1. the styling is already all there so you can create all of the components without interaction.\n2. most components are class-driven. Meaning that you just need to add a class for it to be enabled. For instance, to enable a modal, just add is-active to it. If you want to enable an accordion item, add is-active to it. This is pretty simple to do in Vanillajs.\n3. if you have jQuery, then you can rely on the jQuery version of the Foundation components.\nI think this is all pretty self-explanatory.\nEDIT As an FYI, I've no idea what's in store for FA for the future, just wanted to add my 2 cents.\n. @zimt28 no work has been done on it. \n. Awesome! Thanks! :)\n. I decided to add titles to all of the docs pages. I think it'd be worth the time to go through and figure out which docs pages need to be deleted.\n. Yep! Plus it'll force me to actually use the Docs over my playground! ;)\n. @jcs224 Please run Gulp and post the output, and run npm install before that if you haven't already.\n. Using relative templates runs into a lot of issues with HTML5Mode (which would then require a base). I guess anyone that uses HTML5mode (and turns it on), will have to figure out the requireBase thing.\nI'll go ahead and have the fix on master.\n. I just checked it. The config.path always comes out as a relative path for me in every instance. Console.log out the entire config (check the endstream and console log out configs) to see if the path is the issue.\nIf you're talking about the URLs themselves, the ui-router has a list of solutions for that: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#solution\nHowever, I'm not sure if that's the issue.\n. @mrsweaters could be a difference in the way the OS handles filesystems and it might not make a difference in the way the app works when it's in the root but it might in a subdirectory (I'm running Windows so I can't see how it behaves on OSX or Linux). Can you try to console log out the relativePath and the other variables just in case? I can go ahead and implement a cross-platform fix once I know what to look for.\n. Ah crap. @gakimball can you confirm this is still an issue? The thing with the double/single quotes is that IE, FF, AND Chrome parse this crap differently. I added some logic earlier today when FF started to fail again. I wonder if it got resolved.\n. I'm hoping my last fix attempt resolved this. I'm going to close this out until it comes up again.\n. @gakimball we can't have two config files loaded into the app though. Should we then keep the js/angular/app.js pristine and not even loaded while the docs/assets/js/app.js does all the work with the extra modules?\nNor can we add dependencies after the configuration.\n. @zurbrandon it seems to be a modal overlay issue. It has a display:none attached to it but it also has a display:flex which overrides the display none. Since it has a transition on it, it flashes in-n-out. It seems that the display: flex should be part of the is-active declaration.\nBecause otherwise, for some reason, it simply fades out to opacity: 0.\nI'm not sure if this is entirely correct but that seems to be what's currently happening. However, if we do add display: flex on is-active, the entire thing will not animate :/\n. @gakimball so I finished the directive animations so yes, this should work. The overlay uses the same custom animations logic with hard-coded fadeIn and fadeOut values. So, if you get rid of the transitions attached directly to the overlay, everything should work correctly! :)\n. no clue why I reopened this.\n. The path should be relative to the site itself. The contents of the docs get copied to build which is the root of the site (so, docs itself does not get copied). Try the URLs without /Docs and see if that works.\n. I made a fix in the docs and the interchange logic. All working now! :)\n. I actually have no way of closing it out. The scroll event doesn't bubble up so if the user scrolls any container within the window, the popup will stay there.\nAnd attaching a scroll event listener to every container in the window is impractical and would mess up performance.\n. Urgh. I've been struggling with that bug for a long time, thought I had it solved!\nThanks for the heads up. Do you know which FF version you're using?\n. Fixed anyways.\n. Fixed.\n. This is related to #156. The modal overlay does not have a display: none set to it when it's not active and it has a transition attached to it, that causes it (on modern browsers) to do a \"flash\" when it's loaded. On IE10, the overlay also registers click events which cause it to appear and disappear (flash).\n@gakimball can you implement the logic we discussed where .modal-overlay has a display:none and no transitions and then is-active adds the display: flex? That way my animation logic can fade it in using the regular fadeIn class and we can bypass all these problems?\n. I'll give this a shot. If it still doesn't work, we might want to consider rolling back to the original way we got all those styles with meta elements being added one by one.\n. FF is being ridiculous. It works fine if you:\n1. double parse it. Seriously. First time around, it becomes a proper \"string\", second time around, it's an object\n2. eval it and then parse it. Same result. Wtf?\n. Fixed it -.- logic looks way better now too. Yay.\n. @cvrebert those are all good points. Currently, the branch I just merged in will change focus to the modal but not back. This is because there may be numerous originating elements and there is currently no implementation to send the origin element to the modal in order to send the focus back.\nI'd like to definitely get that on the way though.\n. hmm.. I'm not entirely sure how to prevent that. ideas?\n. I'll check out their code. Thanks for the tip!\n. Phew, so this is becoming more difficult than I thought. Just some notes to myself:\n1. when a tether is activated, it's moved outside of the view and attached to the body. When a view changes and comes back, it's still present and the view creates a second copy\n2. destroying the tether when view changes works; however, if one does not change the view, the tether destruction is irreversible and creates errors (edit nvr mind, it doesn't actually destroy it, wtf).\n3. unless there is a dependency on $state or a similar service, there's no way to distinguish between a view change and hiding the element regularly.\n. @gakimball I fixed 2/3rd of the commands so that most of them should work now. The problem is on the Node side (or perhaps Windows side?) where exec only runs executables, not scripts or whatever else. For some reason npm works with npm.cmd and bower works with bower.cmd. However, I couldn't get bundle to work at all. I'm not a 100% sure why.\nI noticed that the gulp-ruby-sass package uses win spawn which allows for cross-platform exec and spawn. I'll give regular spawn a shot as it might work better.\n. I changed a few things around. As long as bundler and ruby are installed correctly, the cli should work right (note that it hasn't been tagged and released yet). I changed a few things around, implemented a few fixes from win spawn and successfully installed several apps (just to make sure it works!).\n@jsmreese I'm running a similar setup (jruby 1.7.15, Sass 3.4.7 and I'm on Windows 8, best windows there is). Sass was installed via bundler (the gulpfile specifies bundleExec on the command too). I wonder if that makes a difference?\n. @gakimball The bundler thing is weird since the method I used should have covered every case. It literally uses a secondary process to run a command. Should've been foolproof, It's what ruby-sass uses to run their command so I'm pretty surprised it doesn't work! O.O I can try to integrate the win-spawn package that has a more robust cross-platform solution. I can't test it for others though so it'd be a hit/miss situation.\n@narration I have Windows 8.1 64-bit just as you do. The weird thing is, I tried bundle.bat and it failed that's why I resorted to the solution I have which really should have been a slam dunk, a last resort that should work no matter what. This discrepancy among the same operating systems sucks. Can't imagine why.\nOut of curiosity what version of Ruby are you using?\n. @FlatspinZA thanks for posting that! \n. @narration using a table of possibilities could end with a lot of issues. However, I retested your solution this morning and it seems to work. Not sure why it didn't work me earlier. Definitely much simpler than my solution. \nAlso, much to my displeasure, it looks like I never published the bundler fix in the first place -.- >.<\nEverything is updated now and working.\n. :+1: \n. @JeroenNoten one thing about using the application module is that it doesn't work well with other angular apps. It sets routing so that would most likely break your existing app. Thus the name application, as a standalone app. I did open an issue for possibly transforming it into a dependency.\nIt's much better to take the application dependencies and import everything module by module (or whatever you'd use) rather than trying to integrate the entire structure. That would make more sense to me. Most of them have internal dependencies set so you'd know what you need to import in order to make it work.\nThe only exceptions are foundation.common.directives module which has all the directive helpers (zf-close, zf-open, etc.), and the foundation.init module which is required by Interchange (you'll have to check the app.js to see how it's used there) for media query extraction and resize event listener\n. I'm going to close this out to continue the discussion in #223 \n. Try doing a manual npm install\n. @stryju there are some issues with your code:\n1. there are numerous comments and JSHint declarations that currently do not match the code style of the rest of the application. \n2. you're also using function declarations instead of function expressions. I will eventually move the codebase to function declarations in self-invoking blocks (as per certain AngularJS style guides) but until then, I'd like to keep everything coherent\n3. there's also the case of this vs $scope. I'm not a fan of using this at all in JS since it changes context so fluidly. SO has a good discussion on the $scope. vs this topic, but overall, using this is dangerous. \n4. Lastly, the NavController is unrelated to the dynamic routing. In fact, I moved it straight to the actual docs app and outside of the rest of FAs stuff. It's used to generate autocomplete for the docs and nothing else. That's why it binds a bunch of stuff to the $scope directly.\n. @stryju the idea is sound and lends extra functionality to AngularJS devs. I like that a lot though I imagine that Angular devs would rather use their own routing rather than use FAs dynamic routing; however, I'd like to add this to the app!\nThanks for all the work!\n. @stryju you make a good case for the usage of this. I just opened an issue #262 to discuss style guidelines. Once that is in order (and I get the go ahead), I'll start refactoring everything.\nAs far as the usage of this, I'll go one step further to embrace what the style guides recommend: assigning this to a variable in order to prevent context-switching this. That would definitely solve the issues I could see propping up while solving the issues you're discussing as well.\nIf you can go ahead and refactor your branch to follow the current guide lines and make it mergeable, I can go ahead and merge it in. Let me know if that's cool with you.\n. use $scope for now until the refactor and discussion on guidelines take place.\n. @codymorgan if you use the framework, you can specify a title per view (you'll have to add some logic, check out the docs). It looks like in this case, the different child views were not given separate titles, that's all.\nThe history is an intended effect so you can go back through your browsing history of the app.\n. Hmmm, not that I'm aware of. It should be the equivalent of clicking on a link and going to a different page on a static website.\n. Seems to be an error that only props up with non-functioning URLs that don't use the regular ui-sref but instead link to nowhere href=\"#\". This causes a JS error (as it should) and will not cause any issues in production. The 2 history states are probably, one to an invalid state and one back to a valid state.\n. @gakimball the template files should be separate 90% of the time. The only exception is for templates that are (literally) one-liners that can be easily read. I'm wary of inlining some and not others. The ones I've inlined so far are usually placeholder templates (like <div></div>).\n@BraunreutherA I opened an issue to discuss the practices. It may make more sense to have a folder based separation so that /accordion has the HTML templates and the JS file together. It'll be easier to import.\n. @davidgeary right, the app.js is more of an example. The original point was to have people import everything module-by-module and use app.js as a reference on how to initialize everything.\nAs far as the folder structure, are you suggesting something like /zf-components/ with all of the components in there? So /zf-components/panel and /zf-components/interchange?\n. @kathyqian this should already be implemented. Can you double-check it on your device?\n. There's a Utils factory in https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/blob/master/js/angular/common/common.services.js#L120 which holds a throttle. Check FoundationApi for getSettings (https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/blob/master/js/angular/common/common.services.js#L29) which will return a list of settings, including the queries.\n. since this is a ruby gem issue and not an issue with FA, I'll go ahead and close this out. If you still need help, you can go ahead and still comment. I know that things are a bit confusing with Ruby on Windows.\n. The router DOES allow named views. I'll definitely look into using that for this applicaiton.\n. @davidkpiano I'll go ahead and use your solution since the dynamic router is currently not setup to support named views on the root template\n. Open up localhost:8080 and see what shows up. The error basically means that another process is running at the same port. Whether it's a Node process or otherwise. I know that, for instance, Skype runs on port 80 on Windows, and WAMP and sometimes MAMP run on 8080 which would create a conflict.\nIf you're on a Mac, go to your activity manager (I think that's what it's called) and search for Node. Kill all that process and try again.\n. This is an unrelated error the to the one in the issue.\nTry running npm install in the directory. And try to do an npm install -g gulp as well to make sure you have gulp installed.\n. @circlingthesun I'm not sure about the value, BUT, it is VERY easy to trigger a modal. And, in fact, you can trigger 90% of the components out of the box. How? FoundationApi.\nIf you're using a controller, include FoundationApi as a dependency (and let's say, name it fa). And then just do this:\nfa.publish('id-of-my-modal', 'show')  and it will show up immediately. If you want to hook into the process, just add another subscriber:\nfa.subscribe('id-of-my-modal', function(msg) { console.log(msg); }); and whenever someone sends a message to the modal (to open it or otherwise), your function will be run as well.\n. @maxcook this is a bug, not something you should have to worry about, you're right.\n. @ilanbiala can you be more specific?\nThe only errors I've seen are related to the use of href=\"#\" which will not show up once the sample apps are implemented into your application.\n. Are you running your application in a subfolder on your app server? That may cause the issue. There are some workarounds for that in order for Angular to know to look into a subfolder rather than root. Might be worth looking into.\n. I implemented all of the features on #300. \n. @akiran have you tested that it still works as an element?\n. @akiran I'll have to change the snippet itself. This directive does not play well with element-style declarations because of its controller and require structure.\nIn fact, doing attribute-only or element-only structures work; however, mix and matching will produce errors (so zf-action-sheet with a child of div zf-as-button. I'd rather stick to one that works than both and have users open up issues that seem to be directly with Angular rather than with FA.\nWhat do you think?\n. What I meant was that AngularJS is pretty moody. If you create an entire declaration in elements, it works. If you create it in attributes, it works. You can test it out with the Action Sheet.\nTry to use your fix and create one which mix/matches the element/attribute declaration (not restriction, but the actual markup you put on your site) like s;\nhtml\n<a href=\"#\" zf-toggle=\"my-actionsheet\">toggle</a>\n<div zf-action-sheet id=\"my-actionsheet\">\n<zf-as-button>my button goes here</zf-as-button>\n<zf-as-content position=\"bottom\">\nMy content goes here\n</zf-as-content>\n</div>\nIt immediately fails for some reason, can't figure out why.\nAs far as long-term, not sure what I'll decide to do.\n. @stryju right, the problem is the different ways to declare elements. Some people don't feel comfortable creating an Element over an Attribute. It would make sense to me that both would work the same way but when you mix them, they don't.\n. @akiran i kept running into issues but I'll give it another shot tomorrow. It has happened more than I'd like to admit where something didn't work, and the next day, there were no issues at all.\n. Well, what do you know, it works. I'll go ahead and merge this in! :)\n. ha! Good catch.\n. That happens when a link points to href=\"#\" without an event listener to stop its default action. Can you tell me what you clicked on to get this error?\n. Check out the controller code. It stores front matter vars in scope.vars. Go ahead and apply the same logic to your own controller. \n. @gakimball I changed a few things around so that the regular JS dependencies (tether, fastclick, etc.) get compiled into dependencies.js while all the angular stuff + the app.js get compiled to app.js. \nI'm wanting to do the same thing on this repo (i already did it on the templates). What do you think?\n. Everything should work now.\n. Fixed via #302 \nIt currently checks that the click originated from an element that has an href. That would make much more sense.\n. Finally fix.\n. Very good to know. I was about to upgrade too. I'm using 1.7.15 as well.\n. @stryju @davidgeary @gakimball I got the initial new structure in place. I was wondering if I could get some feedback! Here are some things:\n1. all components are now in components/ separated by folder according to what they are.\n2. routing is now separated into foundation.dynamicRouting and foundation.dynamicRouting.animations. Adding foundation.dynamicRouting as a dependency automatically runs the correct initializations. It also contains the DefaultController which is used by the dynamicRouting module. \n3. all the components can be imported via foundation.components (without importing dynamicRouting).\n4. foundation.interchange configuration is now run from the module and does not have to be manually run outside of there.\n5. Everything should be MUCH easier to run and use.\nI'll continue with the rest of the changes but would love to get the new structure in place first.\n. One more note, I'm pretty set on the naming scheme which is a combination of namespacing and camelCase. So, for instance, foundation is our main namespace. All of our components go under foundation.components. \nI'm thinking of breaking apart the components and placing them under that naming scheme so there'd be a foundation.components.accordion, foundation.components.common (for zf-toggle, etc.), foundation.components.modal. I'm not sure if that's better or using the easier namespacing with foundation.modal, foundation.accordion, etc.\nDynamic routing is under foundation.dynamicRouting, which makes sense and its additional animation module can be imported with another foundation.dynamicRouting.animations. Though, again, I'm wondering if dynamicRouting should be the main import and then split up the rest into foundation.dynamicRouting.init (or .main) and foundation.dynamicRouting.animations. I can see lots of situations where animations would not be necessary. I like that it's camelCase since foundation.dynamic.routing just doesn't make sense.\nI'd love some feedback on this too.\n. I think I'll make it part of the foundation.services module which includes the FoundationApi which houses globalSettings that interchange uses to access the media queries and that others can use as well.\n. Urgh, I'm afraid to merge master into this\n. @stryju you're right! I'll go ahead and add that.\n. no, no, the other way, just to resolve conflicts. With all the bug-fixes I've done since I started this branch, I'm a little afraid! :)\n. Urgh, so I am not looking forward to fast forwarding this. it'll probably involve a lot of copy-pasting, and figuring out conflicts. But anyways, other than the require part, this is ready to go.\n. @gakimball how should we proceed with this? We can release this today or with the a future version bump. I'd prefer the latter since there may be some Gulp change this will require\n. Andddd this is ready to go. The only part that I have skimmed on was the require part which I feel like is not 100% necessary.\nI'd like to merge this in ASAP to master so that any subsequent PRs won't interfere with it!\nThanks everyone for all the help!\n. @stryju we'll be releasing a bump this or next week. Next week most likely.\n. @japhar81 I'm not sure why you'd get the error. Have you tried tracking it down the stack? I'll look at it sometime tomorrow or this upcoming week and will let you know what I come up with.\n. Strange. Maybe @gakimball can shed some light on this as well. It seems to work correctly on Firefox and when I inspected this step-by-step, there is only ONE element. It seems like Chrome keeps a second rendered copy for some reason, that's not present in the DOM.\nI tested this out several times and at certain times, I had only half the element showing (the one in place, not the animating one), and sometimes it worked just as expected.\n. I think a -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; added to the animation elements (and possibly the parent) will fix the problem.\n. @wtfribley can you tell me which ones you experience this behavior with? Perhaps I can translate the class from the initial directive declaration to a more suitable target element\n@gakimball where do you see that? I might have fixed this bug with refactor because the overlays don't appear for me in the examples. (except where they should)\n. @gakimball if you remember, setting overlay-close automatically overrides overlay=\"false\" so that the overlay show ups. I can change that if you want.\n@wtfribley thanks! I'll get that taken care of.\n. @gakimball sounds good! \n. @gakimball the built-in animation is fadeIn and fadeOut. If it slides, that means that there is an animation defined directly on the notification element. And indeed, there is a transition: transform on it and translation. We'd need to cut that out, and it should work as intended! :)\n. sounds good!\n. @gakimball we're using this class, hardcoded, as part of all the directives. Since we globalSettings is available via the FoundationApi, perhaps we can use it to specify custom active classes on the front-end, too.\n. @gakimball sure thing\n. @gakimball I keep getting an error when running Gulp:\nError: app.scss:1:1: Unclosed block\n. I was going to open the same issue this morning! :) Glad to see others thinking along the same lines.\n. Does the panel itself flash or are you talking about the how the scrollbar shows up on the side?\nI'm on Ubuntu 14.04 Chrome 38 and couldn't replicate the issue (might be the version bump).\n. @gakimball I was thinking of modifying the animation method in FoundationApi (how our various elements animated) to add an animating class or similar. Would it make sense so that we can prevent issues like this?\nFor instance, we could do:\ncss\n.animating {\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n. Urgh, so it turns out it's not a panel issue. There's something about the animation that makes the grid-block several parents up get a scroll bar. Removing the relative declaration on grid-block fixes this problem; however, I'm not sure how that would play out with the rest of the CSS so I can't foresee a solution to this.\n. Right right, that makes sense. So what would you propose as a solution?\n. @akiran I'd like to merge your PR in; however, it looks like we merged in some changes that makes yours unmergeable. Can you make the proper changes to make it mergeable? I'll go ahead and merge it in then.\n. sounds good!\n. @akiran there's a pull request #282 that I'll be merging in this week (as soon as possible). It'll do all kinds of cool stuff. One of the major changes is changing the root module's name.\n. I'm working on a refactor #282 that will package most of foundation configurations and dependencies into a module called foundation that you can include and it'll already set a bunch of stuff up for you. There's also foundation.dynamicRoutes and foundation.dynamicRoutes.animation and those are for the dynamic routing.\nWhen working on your own project, just include these dependencies as well as their dependencies just like you listed. You'll also need to setup your $locationProvider; however, all of these settings are trivial to create and should not be dependent on FA, if that makes sense. So any changes to your app.js will come from you while any changes to configuration, directives, directive templates, etc. will come from the FA repository/package.\nDoes that make sense? \n. @micjamking the CLI tool is not necessary for this process. You can do exactly what you said, and use Gulp or other build tool to pull in all the necessary files and include them.\n. Since Foundation became a module in itself, this topic is a little moot. Closing it out.\n. Not a JS error, we literally have two modals with the same name and markup. One of them has an overlay, the other doesn't. So both get activated and then on-click, the only one of them turns off. On a secondary close, they both try to \"animate out\".\n. @gakimball seems like Windows has issues with it. Whenever I git clone it, it comes back with Docs only while my regular repo has docs and will pull all changes there.\n. Nvr mind Fixed.\nWe really need to avoid having this happen again because it essentially overwrites the history of docs each time.\n. Well, that's why there is vanilla Foundation that you can use purely for the styling. It's just about the same when it comes to markup and the way it looks. Durandal even mentions the integration.\nHowever, when Bower installing FA, you can still just compile the CSS and work with that. FA is supposed to be a full-package: CSS + JS, not one or the other even though it can be used that way too.\n. @stryju thanks for looking through it. ngAnimate is used in the foundation.dynamicRouting.animations in the form of an animation. And even then, I use ngAnimate-like logic within the animation. There are several reasons for that and if you can think of a way to avoid using it this way, I'm all ears:\n1. in the .ui-animation, we're using animation information that's contained in the scope via the DefaultController. The animation information is dynamic since it comes from the templates and is injected at runtime into the router as view information. Because of this, I had issues setting up an animation using regular classes. Instead, the ui-animation animation replicates the ng animate behavior. And unfortunately, using ng-class would trigger the wrong transition as the class would not be immediately rendered and thus cause a \"flash\". \n2. the reason for the animate service in FoundationApi is pretty much the same except that it's used within directives. The reason for that is two-fold. One is that we use an is-active class for non-animated toggling, this class is necessary and there seems to be no way to time the correct addition/removal of the class using ngAnimate and the second is that we activate the directives at various times in the runtime. Meaning that it's not a simple animation that shows up whenever the directive is rendered.\nDoes that make sense?\n. @stryju yeah, go ahead and setup a feature branch and I'd be more than happy to discuss it and find the right solution. There are some issues I see with $animate. It seems like all it does is add a class and nothing else. But I could be wrong. The documentation is a little fuzzy to me on that.\n. @stryju The cut off is there to prevent any animation misfires from keeping the element in place. IIRC, Angular sets this to 10000ms. I can go ahead and increase the timeout.\n. There was also another reason for custom animations and that was the addition of a class to absolutely position the transitioning views. \n. Hmm.. I'm not sure of the benefit here. While we'd save on JS, we'd end up having to write twice as much CSS just to accommodate this new style of animations. \nI do like how much JS it saves and offloads the animation logic back to Angular. Idk. I feel like I'm on the fence with this. It seems like the right solution for the obvious use-case (views, and we could make this work for the various directives as well) but we wouldn't be able to make this work for regular ng-enter/enter-active and ng-leave/leave-active use-cases.\nIdk, I'd like a third/fourth opinion on this. \n@jeaniec @gakimball what do you think of this?\nTo summarize:\n1. we'd replace all of my custom animation logic (that's almost just like Angular's animation logic) with Angular's built-in $animate service, this would offload our logic back to Angular.\n2. The change would require changing all of the MotionUI classes to work with .[animation]-add and .[animation]-add-active.\n3. We would either have to double up our CSS to work with .ng-enter and .ng-leave or drop those altogether. This would mean, built-in animation support for ng-if, ng-repeat, etc. would be dropped as well.\nThe change in JS is trivial to make (at least by the looks of it).\n. @stryju I'm not sure what you mean by those two bulletpoints. Can you elaborate? And what do you mean by \"hacky\" states transition? \nI understand your point, unfortunately Angular doesn't have an easy way of specifying custom enter/leave classes, otherwise we could emulate ng-enter and ng-leave just like in my original code. Without it, we'd have to double up our work in the CSS instead of JS. And since our JS does almost the same thing that Angular does (with WAY less code), we wouldn't lose much on that side. \n@gakimball suggested that we can just extend the selectors. If that works, I'll go ahead and test all this out. That could benefit all of us :)\n. @stryju a zf-view was part of my original solution but what we had then didn't work with it. Go for it and make sure to submit a PR so I can easily pull that in and test it out as well.\nI'll go ahead and use your example to test out the new SASS class-system that Geoff is working on and see if we can make THAT change without affecting much of anything else.\n. @gakimball will do!\n. @stryju go ahead and submit this as a PR so we can comment and discuss the code straight on there. \nOther than that and some code stylistic changes, this looks mighty impressive. If it works as you describe, I'd love to get this merged in. \n. sweet! Thanks!\n. @stryju it's always on the list. I totally agree. \n. If you look through the code, you'll notice that whenever I inject FoundationApi, I inject as foundationApi; however, to avoid confusion, I'll go ahead and merge your PR. It makes more sense that way in an example! :)\n. The zf-as-button directive has to be inside the zf-action-sheet directive. It's not a separate directive but rather a part of the zf-action-sheet directive. Hope that makes sense.\nHowever, you can use your zf-hard-toggle the way you're using it. In that case, the zf-as-button directive is superfluous..\n. It's because actionsheet is currently not \"closeable\". I'll go ahead and get that fixed up.\n. Good catch. I'm submitting a fix.\n. Fixed\n. @akiran good point!\n. @akiran good catch on this!\n. @stryju I'm liking this. Once we make the CSS changes, I'd like to get this launched for v1.1 and then start work on getting this working with the various directives.\n. oh, awesome\n. @stryju so I'm having some issues with this, same ones I had when I initially worked on the animations.\nHere are some things:\n1. the animations experience a flash when loading up. Meaning that the element shows up, disappears, and then animates in.\n2. the \"out\" animation sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. It looks like it stops working if the other view is not animating. It also simply cuts short for no reason.\nHowever, I do like the fact that we got rid of the whole-page animations that used to happen whenever you'd load up the page.\n. @stryju can you tell me what your testing setup was? I simply added animationIn: fadeIn and animationOut: fadeOut to a couple of the pages and switched between them, that was it.\n. You can go ahead and remove them. Try running in these on the docs and you'll see what I mean. I wonder why it works in your example and why it would fail on the Docs.\n. Damn, this is bizarre.\n. merge in our newest master and comment out the prefixer, that should solve your problem for the time being.\n. go to any of the page templates (like angular.html or motionui.html) and add the animations to the front matter. Open up the docs, and switch between those two pages. \nBtw, @stryju I'm wondering about using these animations on directives. I had this idea to do the following:\n1. use ng-if on all the directives instead of the is-active classes. This would ensure that elements can be animated if they have animation-enabled classes attached to those elements.\n2. add animation-in and animation-out classes to the directive. Since they only get triggered when ng-[leave/enter] is added, they won't wreck havoc. \nThis would make sure that the regular ngAnimate module would animate everything without our help. What do you think?\n. @stryju let's leave the component animation for later. We can convert those for the next version after 1.1. I'd like to get these view animations fully ready. They seem to be 99% there, except for the issues on Chrome on Windows.\n. I don't understand. So if the entire page is not animating, the view animation breaks? Or are there specific elements that mess up the view animation?\n. @stryju hmm. The animation does seem to stop working for the text element. I'm still having problems with the animations not working when switching to a non-animated view. \n@gakimball I had some success with the solutions we came up with for #283. \nI'm thinking that this change might not make it to the next version because of these issues.\n. In that case, we'll need to add the position-absolute class to the parent until the view that's entering is done entering. But that's a good point, I didn't think about that, thanks.\n. Right. So that's a good thing. I'd rather not deal with that. \n. @stryju I'm gonna go ahead and pull this locally and try to do some work on it. I'm not sure how I can work on this collaboratively since this is off your repo but I'll give it a shot.\nJust some notes and todos:\n- [ ] absolute positioning of parents\n- [ ] backface visibility in animation\n- [ ] testing on various browsers\n- [ ] move absolute positioning to utilities (this is my fault, I've no idea why i didn't move it)\n. That's what I'll do! :) I've no idea if I'll have to open up a PR for it on your project or what. This stuff is pretty confusing.\nI guess we'll deal with that as we go.\n. Good idea on that. There's somewhat of a rift between the element usage since we want to support both developers that don't know Angular well but want to use the more dynamic features like modals, notifications, etc. and developers that already know Angular want more power-user features.\nFeatures for the latter type of a user are definitely lacking because, as you said, pretty much all the components should have services that create them and don't require in-template directives. If I have time, I'll go ahead and prototype a modal service that we can also port to other components.\n. Modal factory is now available in the code under, you guessed it, ModalFactory\n. wohoo! :) :+1: \n. @akiran I'm working on a method to queue animations, that would allow us to send a message to toggle an element but it won't toggle until an animation is done. \n. If you pressed toggle mid-animation, the animation would finish before it toggles back out. I think that'd be desired behavior.\nThere's also something else I thought about, and that's running $scope.apply() BEFORE the animation is run. I wonder if that'd make a difference since it seems that the issue is that the wrong animation gets run and when it finishes, the wrong state gets applied.\nEDIT Makes no difference.\n. @akiran makes sense. I think that long-term, I'll have to implement angular's built-in animations. That's being done as part of #330. I think for v1.1, I'll go ahead and use the queue work-around.\n. Fixed with #341\n. #388 fixed this! :)\n. O.O I got the animation cancellation working. This should fix a bunch of issues.\n. @akiran can you test this out and see if this fixes the animation problems and works as you would expect? It works for me but I wanted to make sure before I merge it in! :)\n. As long as you use the Iconic directive, it should work as described. Are your icons showing up when they're not dynamically injected?\n. Hmm.. that's an interesting use case. I'll open up a PR for Iconic to allow dynamic injection.\n. Look out for another this weekend! Thank you! :)\n. Foundation 5 and Foundation for Apps have a difference codebase. If you check out the scss/helpers/_breakpoints.scss, you'll notice that on line 166 that we'll eventually have those breakpoints implemented.\n@gakimball can shed some light as to when (and if) that will happen.\n. The CLI actually pulls in a copy of the Foundation for Apps Template which has a bower file that gets installed. By default, it pulls in v1.0.0. You can change this to pull in specifically the latest version by copy/pasting the zip-file download link: https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/archive/master.zip <- note that this is not the preferred way of doing things and bower will NOT cache this file (whenever bower installs dependencies it saves them in case another project will need them or you need to reinstall).\nYou can go ahead and use this method. There were some file structure changes since the last version update so make sure to update your Gulpfile with what's in the v1.1 branch of FA Template repo: https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template/pull/15/files Also, if you're not using your own custom app.js, take a look at the one in that branch.\nHope this helps! Again, it's not the preferred way of doing things (we'll be coming out with a new version soon) but you can get up to speed that way.\n. I did a huge refactor last week that allows for FA to be used as a dependency to your own application. That would probably fix some of your issues.\nHowever, can you provide us with your controller definition and the error you're getting? There might be something else you're missing or that I may help you with. Also, are you using your own custom app.js that defines the entire application or are you using what's in bower_components?\n. Hmm. it worked for me.\nAre you sure it's being loaded after Foundation? And does everything else from Foundation work for you?\n. You shouldn't need to put it in app.js as long as your controllers file is loaded after Foundation and Angular (which seems to be the case). :/ Hmm.\nCan you by chance put this up on Plunkr or a git repo?\n. So I got it. The controller.js file doesn't get included anywhere nor does it get compiled down. Go to your Gulpfile line 43, and change client/assets/js/app.js to client/assets/js/*.js. I tested it and it fixed the problem.\nMake sure you reload your gulp process and don't forget to post back when it works! :)\n. Also, thank you for posting the repo up, debugging was much easier that way.\n. Just keep the *.js in there :)\n. @thylo I encountered a bunch of bugs with the notification not responding. I'll have to look into creating a more permanent solution. \nCan you give me an example of how you used this in a way that created the original error? Because I can't seem to recreate it at any point.\n. @thylo thanks. So, I'd like to propose two other possible solutions:\njs\nif(!scope.$$phase) $scope.$apply();\nor\njs\nscope.$apply(controller.addNotification(msg))\nCan you try either of these and see if they work for you? If they do, just change the code to work with one of these (I'd prefer the bottom solution) and I'll go ahead and merge it in.\nThanks for your help with solving this issue! :)\n. @maxcook I wasn't aware of any issues there. Can you open a new issue and describe the problem? \n. @akiran I don't understand. You're using the src attribute to be applied to data-src but in your example you're only using data-src.\nEither way, I think it'd make sense to have a dyn-src that you can send a variable to without having to use {{ }} inside an attribute (something I'm not a fan of). But to make sure we can cover as many developers as possible, I'd like to have both. \nCan you change the file to not delete the dyn-src but keep your fix as well?\n. I would NOT recommend running Gulp in a production environment. Gulp and even a Node process can crash without being restarted because of all kinds of different errors. Instead, if you want to run a Node process, use forever and build your own app.js to run a static server (because that's all you really need). There are some other configurations you'll need to figure out (such as if you'll run forever on port 80, or use Apache/Nginx to point to the forever process port).\nWhen you upload the files to your server, running Gulp once should setup all the production files (the /build folder).\nHowever, you can make your life much easier by running any kind of a basic static server such as with Apache or Nginx and just run everything static, pre-build the files locally and FTP it up. Or install Node and build files after deployment. \nThere's really not a need for anything outside of static file serving.\n. @LuminusDev not a bad idea. Would you mind writing out some docs on this process here? I think a lot of users would appreciate it. If you can't, I can go ahead and write it out. \n. That basically means that another Node processing is running or another application is using the port 8080. See if you have WAMP or similar running on your machine and turn it off. If not, check the Gulpfile JS and see if you can change the NodeJS port from 8080 to something else (3000 is a standard)\n. Hey guys, can you show me the entire controller or whatever that you used to run this? It's possible it wasn't injected properly. Also, does anything else run for you? Popups? etc?\nFoundationApi is a service part of the foundation.core module which is included in the foundation module. It includes a pub/sub system that ties all of the foundation components together. It has to be injected into something else to use it (like a controller or your own custom directive).\n@vincentmorneau \nAs far as the link you sent over, I didn't experience any of those issues when I went to it. Can you give me your OS and Chrome version? Thanks!\n. @vincentmorneau FoundationApi is not globally available. It's a service that has to be injected into an angular module to be used so it cannot be run globally the way you did in the console. This is part of AngularJS basics.\nCheck out, for instance, the modal component and its modal.js: https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/blob/master/js/angular/components/modal/modal.js\n``` js\n  angular.module('foundation.modal', ['foundation.core'])\n    .directive('zfModal', modalDirective);\nmodalDirective.$inject = ['FoundationApi'];\nfunction modalDirective(foundationApi) {\n   //directive code\n  }\n```\nThe modal module itself requires the foundation.core which includes our FoundationApi service. Then the FoundationApi is injected into our directive. This could be rewritten in a more familiar form as:\njs\nangular.module('foundation.modal', ['foundation.core'])\n  .directive('zfModal', ['FoundationApi', function(foundationApi) {\n     //directive code\n  }]);\nYou can create a new directive or trigger a modal opening (or whatever action) via a controller or another different programmatic way but it has to be through AngularJS conventions so that it gets injected and properly used.\n. @vincentmorneau have you had a chance to look over what I wrote and try it out?\n. @vincentmorneau yes, there is a way to launch a modal page and just about every other FA component programmatically.\nUnfortunately, it does require more thorough AngularJS knowledge especially of controllers. I wrote a beginner's guide to angular last year that can give you a quick crash-course to everything Angular. That may help you out.\nHere's a sample controller that may do what you're thinking of and once you grasp the basics of Angular, you'll have an easier time understanding what's going on and figuring out better ways of opening modals, etc. :\njs\nangular.module('application')\n   .controller('MyController', ['FoundationApi', function(FoundationApi) {\n     this.openModal = function() {\n      FoundationApi.publish('my-modal-id', 'show');\n    };\n}]);\nand with accompanying HTML:\nhtml\n<div ng-controller=\"MyController as myCtrl\">\n   <a href=\"#\" ng-click=\"myCtrl.openModal()\">open modal</a>\n</div>\nSince this is no longer an issue on a bug, I'll go ahead and close this out but feel free to comment on the issues with any further questions.\n. huh, didn't realize. Thanks!\n. @akiran I can take care of that part.\n. Hmm, I'll look into it further. Thanks for researching this issue.\n. Can anyone test if this issue is still there? I'm 99% sure I already applied a fix. \n. Not a bad idea. How would you want to structure it? As a separate service maybe? foundation.interchange.service that'd be required by foundation.interchange by default but could be used separately?\nI don't think I'd want to bundle it into FoundationApi (that one has quickly become a bloated service).\n. If you can put together a PR, that'd be fantastic. We can further discuss it there and refine it. \n. @nathanmarks yep! There are several reasons:\n1. This is how it works in Foundation, and the original implementation was a bitch to port over.\n2. I had just found out about this feature\n3. By the time I ported it over, I found out about the listeners portion\n4. I told myself, \"I'll definitely rewrite it and use these fancy listeners!\" but forgot.\n:) In short, yeah, this is definitely on a list somewhere and thank you for mentioning it!\nedit: There was also the the problem of picking only the last available selector in the list so that if you write down:\n<div media=\"default\"></div>\n<div media=\"small\"></div>\n<div media=\"large\"></div>\nThe last matching one on the list would show. Because of the mobile-first approach, all 3 of those would match a full-sized window but only large should show; however, the re-evaluation of what I called \"scenarios\" in the code, could be done every time matchMedia fires one of the listeners.\n. I'd love to see your code! I'm about to merge some refactors in, nothing major but it separates the Media query stuff into its own service (literally just cut/paste code from interchange into a service).\nIf you already have a working mechanism, it'd be awesome if you could submit a PR. We can either merge that in, or I can take that over.\n. @nathanmarks Awesome! :) I just merged it in so you're welcome to go off master. \n. Current issue:\n- [x] scrollbar appears on animation change. I tried to do overflow hidden, I'm probably screwing something up.\n. Seems like I worked out the issue. @stryju can you test this out and let me know how it works for you? I'll go ahead and start on a refactor when everything's up and running correctly.\nI also have some reservations about the code style so I'll update that to fit the rest of the codebase without touching the experimental code. \n. Alright, so I found no way to store reliably if a height was preset or not, nor setting an initiator due to some scoping or variable issues. I decided to go against it and am thinking that we can just merge this in as is and deal with the height issue at some later point.\nI considered having a specific ui-view-container directive which would store height and temporarily change it upon request. Not sure if that's too much.\n@gakimball what do you think about getting this merged in? The only remaining issue is that if the ui-view parent has a style=\"height: whateverpx;\", the height would get erased.\n. @gakimball the ui-view will be positioned absolutely which means that any elements after them will jump up. This is why we can set a height to the parent in order to prevent the jump. This height is set via style=\"height: Whateverpx; and then unset (just as the absolute positioning is unset). \nThe problem is with people who may set a height on the parent via the style attribute because it'll get overriden by the animating ui-views. Does that make sense?\n. Ah, hell, This is by far the most frustrating PR I've worked on. Current status: does not animate correctly -.-\n. I ended up in a dead-end. For some reason, certain animations work perfectly while others don't. For instance, I applied a fadeIn and fadeOut to Angular and Angular-modules pages to test them out.\nThey work 100% correctly one way but the other way they fail. Which is bizarre since they both have the same animation applied to them. Then there are issues with several views (during my test), simply not animating despite following the proper animation procedure which makes me think that this might be a browser thing? But I'm not sure.\nEverything is as close to being done as possibly except for these few kinks.\nEDIT I'm thinking that this might be a better alternative to what we have anyways but idk.\n. Currently there is no way to do this; however, the dynamic routing in FA is meant to be used in the most basic sense and for rapid prototyping. More advanced features should be left to a more conventional routing built out the angular way.\n. UI Router does support it; however, we have not exposed that functionality in the dynamic routing scheme so you can't do something like this:\nyaml\nname: mypage\nurl: /home\ncontroller: MyPageController\nresolve: function() { var some; code() };\n. You don't have to deal with the core at all, just disable the dynamicRouting function and use your own router declaration. \n. Hmm, I'm not sure if I'm understanding correctly. Are you talking about building out a separate service per module that could activate/deactivate them instead of a service that can activate any module?\nI'm also working on a factory for modals that would allow us to create modals programmatically (rather than with separate markup) and that one will have an activate/deactivate member built in; however, it will have the ability to be activated/deactivated via FoundationApi as well. Is that more along the lines of what you're thinking?\n. Hmm.. I'm not sure if I agree with creating a separate service for each module. I kind of like the idea of having a central adapter that activates/deactivates components and then the components themselves handle how that happens. \nThis is so that the existing implementation of components and their activation stays intact and still available to new users. It also follows the way the components talk to each other behind the scenes.\nHowever, I think that once I'm done with the prototype ModalFactory, you'll see something more angular-like behavior with the factory creating the component directives and controlling its activation state.\n. Hmm. Alright. That's a fair point. I'll prototype something out and see how it looks.\n. Perfect!\n. That's already part of the directive! You can call scope.hide, scope.show, and scope.toggle.\n@circlingthesun what do you mean by results? Oh, and some code has already changed since this last commit. I'll definitely add the custom scope option.\n. @gakimball That's where I was headed with this next! =D Currently, the prototype already attaches but does not activate, no clue why. But I'm sure I'll get that resolved tomorrow.\n. Alright, so I ran into a big-time snag that would prevent the factory from firing off proper activate on the modal after its initialization if the code was synchronous. Basically, if we want to default fire the modal by a controller right after it's created, the modal won't even be ready at that point.\nI already asked about it on SO since there's not much documentation on it and no SO questions. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27869320/how-do-you-create-compile-a-directive-via-a-factory\n. Phew, got this resolved. For anyone wondering:\n$compile seems to run async and thus it's possible to run into severe race conditions. It's possible to preload scope for compile with initial data such as activation right from the start. This way, we can tell the modal to compile as an active element! The foundation.publish() function will initially publish to an empty subscriber (if the activate, deactivate, and toggle methods were run too early in the app cycle) but that's totally fine! :)\n. Improvements:\n- [x] pass data with scope rather than poorly formatted HTML string.\n- [x] create an init() function for the modal itself to run against itself at the end of a compilation.\n. @circlingthesun The code is pretty much done, can you suggest a way to add this additional functionality? I'm imagining using $q and deffer; however, if one was to not use then, I still need the activate function to fire.\n. There were some fixes that went out the door a few weeks back, and one specifically regarding this issue, are you on v1.0.2?\n. I'll be adding these to all the pertinent directives as I build factories for them.\n. It's been added to notification and modal. We'll add it as needed. I'll close this out.\n. @etcook I'm currently off the project. I'll go ahead and reopen this issue for someone to check up on this.\n. I've changed some things around. Can you do a pull and test it out?\n. Yay, age old bug fixed.\n. @circlingthesun this is the start of the adapter I was thinking about and I'll start porting it to the facades (I still want to have a central adapter). So the facade would look something like:\n``` js\n  FoundationModal.$inject = ['FoundationApi', 'ModalFactory'];\nfunction FoundationModal(foundationApi, ModalFactory) {\nvar service    = {};\n\nservice.activate = activate;\nservice.deactivate = deactivate;\nservice.newModal = newModal;\n\nreturn service;\n\nfunction activate(target) {\n  foundationApi.publish(target, 'show');\n}\n\nfunction deactivate(target) {\n  foundationApi.publish(target, 'hide');\n}\n\n//sugar for ModalFactory so that it doesn't have to be accessed directly\n   function newModal(config) {\n     return new ModalFactory(config); \n   }\n  }\n```\n. I'd like to keep them separate just in case. But cool. I'll go ahead and code all this up.\n. Hey guys, this is good to be merged in if anyone wants to go ahead and do it :)\n. So this is just a light refactor that was meant to make things a little cleaner. I started working on the #382 abstract matching service, mainly by taking some of the interchange logic out and throwing it into the FoundationMQ service (though, I'd like to find a better long-term solution for this!).\nAnimation is in its own module as well.\n. @naneer that feature is already available! :) The front matter works off basic YAML syntax so what you can do is: \nyaml\ndata:\n    requiresLogin: true\nThat should work.\nI made a video demonstrating some of these features, check it out (make sure to watch it far enough where I demonstrate that it works, I fumble a few times).\n. @soumak77 if I understand this correctly you're proposing the plugin:\n1. creates a module that sets up the routes\n2. appends the routing to an existing file rather than creating a new one that just holds the routes.\nIs that correct?\nOn the first point, I saw that you're using fs.appendFile for both non-module and module declaration. Does append file write a file if it doesn't exist?\nThe code looks sound. I'd suggest that the writeData function gets the appendingToFile option passed in order to avoid scoping problems.\n. @listepo 90% of the functionality in FA is very simple: add \"is-active\" to active an element, and use other classes to modify component behavior. You can easily rip out the styling from FA and wire it up with any other framework.\nAs far as routing goes, that's Angular specific; however, you could still use the front-end router (the Gulp plugin) to create an object and parse it for your favorite router as well.\nHowever, there are some forks that work with other frameworks in the resource section if you'd like to check that out.\n. @romainfrancez will this change prevent any bugs? If not, it looks like the check alone will require way more code than it's worth.\n. @tvuotila after a quick git blame, it looks like I'm responsible for that code. I believe everything works as it should, and if it does, let me offer a quick explanation as far JS goes:\nUsing || is a shorthand to create a fallback in variable declaration. For instance, check out this code:\n``` js\nvar myArr;\nvar newArr = myArr || [];\n```\nThis code will check if myArr is defined and not null. If it is undefined, it'll fallback to the [] value. \nUnfortunately for me, now that I'm looking at it, there's no way to actually set this value to false because this simply gets evaluated and will always end up as true. It's definitely bug-causing code which makes me wonder how come it seems to work. One possible explanation is that the Controller gets evaluated before the zf-accordion directive. This would mean that it's using strings to create defaults. So rather than:\njs\nscope.multiOpen = false || undefined || true; // which would default to true\nWe're evaluating what users pass in as a string:\njs\nscope.multiOpen = \"false\" || undefined || true; // which would evaluate to \"false\"\nSince all of the variables are just references to the scope object, our directive than converts that string into a boolean. The fickle thing is that one simply can't do a !!$scope.multiOpen because in that case, the string \"false\" would equal to \"true\".\nPerhaps a good solution would be a helper function in this module that converts strings to booleans:\n``` js\nfunction booleanize(val) {\n  if(typeof val === 'string') {\n     return val.toLowerCase() === 'true';\n  }\nreturn !!val; //default boolean coercion\n}\n```\nAnd then replace some of the logic in the controller. This brings up another issue though, we want to make sure that if a value is actually set and no undefined, we want to use that value. So perhaps, the best way to approach this would be:\n``` js\nvar collapsible = controller.collapsible = $scope.collapsible = booleanize(pickDefined([$scope.multiOpen, $scope.collapsible], true));\nfunction pickDefined(valueList, default) {\n  for(val in valueList) {\n   if(typeof val !== 'undefined') {\n     return val; //break loop, exits out of function\n   }\n  }\nreturn default;\n}\n```\nI hope that whoever works on this PR can use some of this code and can follow my logic!\n. The EADDRINUSE is an error telling you that something is sitting on your port 8080. It looks like you might be on OSX so I quickly looked up how to determine what's running on port 8080:\nsudo lsof -i :8080\nIf it says node, you can go into your activity manager and kill it and try again.\n. @mattgrande I had no idea about geoff leaving. I was a contractor so it was kind of understood that I'd work on this only for a short amount of time.\n. The SASS part can be used without Angular; however, the JS interactions are Angular based.\n. related to #812 \n. I wonder how this will go. I really enjoyed developing the original base Angular for the library. \n. @tolyo I still have rights to the project but I don't believe it'd be appropriate for me to contribute.\nI think an open-source fork would do it. Just do a fork, call it \"open-foundation-apps\" or base-apps, replace the prefix zf with of/ba and go for it. I'm not sure if foundation is trademarked but I doubt it. \nIf no one is interested in taking on that responsibility, I'd be happy to fork it under a new org name, publish the new packages to bower/npm, manage rights to the new repo and open it to you guys, etc. I just don't have time to actively contribute. \nIn fact, if I can get at least a few people to support  showand help me come with a name, we can do this ASAP that way the project can live on in true open source fashion. \nI have an org that I haven't used in forever called Lernaean and I can fork foundation-apps and the entire suite (the CLI, gulp plugin, etc.) there replacing the word foundation with base just to avoid confusion, give proper credit, and we can all get going from there. But I'm open to other suggestions (a new org name, naming conventions, etc.).\n@soumak77, @tolyo, @HoldenCreative, @tunecino , what do you guys think?\n. @soumak77 @tolyo I'd be more keen on starting a new org and giving a few key people org rights. If you fork it to a personal/work org, same thing can happen as it did in this repo: you stop using it and the repo gets stuck in a commercial organization. I think it's a better idea to have a new org that anyone, including the original creator, can give up rights to without minding it. \n@Gambero81 no one in this thread as far as I know.\n@HoldenCreative I agree we just need to agree where to fork it and under what name so that we can get started. \nAs the saying goes:\n\nThere are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things\n\nAs far as the organization name, here are some of my ideas (mainly bouncing off the idea of using \"base\" and \"open\"):\n- base-apps\n- open-modules\n- baseware\nAnd for the actual repo, we can do \"Angular for Apps\" though that seems a little redundant. If any of you guys can vote on these or come up with new names:\n1. base-apps/angular-apps\n2. open-modules/angular-apps\n3. baseware/angular-apps\n. @soumak77 I'd do a clean fork and start a community around it. I realize that you're using the new framework but honestly, I did a diff between your fork and the official repo and it's only 300 line addition / 150 line deletions which is pretty skimmable.\nWhat we can easily do is when we do the new fork, open a pull request from your repo, and start discussing the changes and if they work for the community. That way some/most/all of your changes can exist in the new official repo and your fork can just get the updates from the new official repo as it needs them. \nWhat do you think about the names?\n. Basically, guys, I'm thinking of an IO.js-style fork of this repo. All I want is a name and we can start the work on this. \n. my bad! :)\nI'm not a fan of tying it to just angular in case people with alternatives in other frameworks want to contribute and add. I guess I'm trying to think of having a long-term org that can house dead projects that the community still wants to support.\n. Alright, done. https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base\nI also opened an issue what needs to be done for initial release where we can discuss publishing this.\n. @gakimball glad I read this! I already started migrating stuff over, I'll hold off until we can talk about it.\n. @gakimball I think that we can safely merge this down now. \n. @gakimball I'll go ahead and give that a shot. It makes sense to mask all of that functionality, I just keep thinking ahead programmatically, not in terms of simplicity! :) \nI think that behind the scenes, I'll run an angular modal service that will broadcast to all the modal directives via the fa-model-open and similar directives. When the name matches, an action will be triggered. That'll make it much easier for everyone to use (since they won't have to touch angular) and will allow us to sidestep controllers.\nHopefully that won't be too difficult! :)\n. @gakimball so the directive is ready to go in but I noticed some structural changes that we should probably discuss.\nWe currently have two folders for both styling and JS. One at the root of the folder, and one inside the client folder. We should probably decide firmly where we want to put the files permanently. I think we could argue both ways.\nPros&Cons of having it in the client folder:\n- The client folder speaks for itself and is the entire project in its raw form\n- it makes it clear that anything outside of the client folder is a supporting file (Gulp, readme, etc.)\n- the con is that you have to go 4 directories deep in order to open a single file (client/assets/js/;angular)\nHaving it at the root:\n- easier to access\n- easy to find files at a glance in the repo\n- source is intermixed with supporting files\nI'm not sure which way I lean. If we had a back-end, I'd definitely throw everything in the client folder but we don't, and this is a front-end only framework. On the other hand, if anyone wants to implement a back-end, it'd make more sense if everything was in the client folder (and the back-end in a server folder).\nThoughts on this?\n. @gakimball Alright, so in that case, I'll keep things as they are since the Angular stuff is mostly a \"library\" sort of thing rather than something I'd let users dig around in. \n. @gakimball Awesome, then, I'll restructure the listeners array to favor access by ID. I'm sure if we stumble on an edge-case where we need the deep structure, I'll just refactor it. Luckily, it's all behind-the-scenes stuff. :) \nAnyways, cool, I'll add that functionality right away. \n. For anyone wondering, I've finally implemented the template loading for interchange. This means that all the scenarios within an interchange directive get collected, saved, and the appropriate partial/template gets loaded (initially).\nJust an FYI, this is a huge breakthrough since the directive has essentially replaced ng-if and ng-include and even uses the templateCache. Now I just need to find a way to fire off the resize hook every time the window resizes! :) Shouldn't be an issue!\n. And interchange is officially working! Some features that are missing (but will be available):\n1. [x]  compiling prebuilt media queries the same way that foundation does it (by creating a meta element and checking its font-family property)\n2. adding custom media queries programmatically (will probably be part of FoundationApi)\n3. implement the matchMedia library as an AngularJS injectable module\nAt this point, I'm thinking that there needs to be better organization to the template files. I'm pretty much just throwing each directive I add on there without any documentation or without any clue as to how it works.\nOn top of that, it'll be a good idea to implement testing! ProtractorJS should be sufficient for that :)\n. @gakimball you mean comment-like internal documentation, external documentation (similar to how Angular's docs work) or something like Javadoc (<- not a big fan of those).\n. Sounds good. I'm continuously refactoring to make things more sensible but I'll definitely comment the code better. I'm really not a big fan of JSDoc so I'm glad we're on the same page! :)\n. @t1mmen just fixed it! :)\n. @gakimball I'm trying to decide on something here. Should the directive add all the necessary classes? That way you have to only write:\nhtml\n<div>\n   <div fa-tab-href=\"tabId\">Tab 1</div>\n</div>\n<div fa-tab-content>\n   <div fa-tab id=\"tabId\">Tab content!</div>\n</div>\nOr should the user be allowed to pick their own classes and thus they'd have to add all the necessary classes. I'm on the fence. \nOn the one hand, I feel like the mechanism of tab switching should be free of styling (so that it could be used anywhere else with different classes, and even different purposes), on the other hand, it'd be nice to have everything neatly packaged.\nWith classes:\nhtml\n<div class=\"tabs\">\n  <div  fa-tab-href=\"tabId\" class=\"tab-item\">Tab 1 </div>\n</div>\n<div fa-tab-content class=\"tab-content\">\n  <div fa-tab id=\"tabId\" class=\"tab-pane\">\n    Test content\n  </div>\n</div>\n. If anyone is wondering why the tons of commits and the hold-ups, it's because of a bug that sets an ID across all tabs directives rather than just for one specific one. This causes all tabs to update from a single tab navigation.\nIt's, safe to say, frustrating.\n. @gakimball @zurbrandon this is ready, w0000t! :) I had to change the syntax a bit but everything works as it should. \n. More improvements (internal):\n- [x] switch is-active DOM manipulation with ng-class={is-active: active} for a more \"angular-like solution\"\n- [x] enable non-hash URLs (requires the use of historyApi middleware).\n- [x] enable \"E\" restriction on component directives, no need to restrict to \"attribute\"\n- [ ] ~~update docs with new elements (might be worth it to add a code directive for displaying code snippets)~~\n. @davidkpiano the animations are class-based but for the fade example, everything is simple, just append an \"in\" and an \"out\". It gets more complicated for your second example:\nanimation: slide\nWould this mean that you're sliding in from the left/right/top/bottom? Would you slide out the same way? Or would you slide out the opposite way? The example in the docs is probably not a real-world example, the real world example would be:\nanimationIn: slideInLeft\nanimationOut: slideOutRight\nTo simulate a slideshow or something.\n. @richbai90 for a large-scale application, I'm not sure if I would recommend using the routing method in FA since it's aimed at designers and developers that aren't entirely familiar with Angular. However, i think it's an interesting concept: having a JS object define all of the routes and dynamically injected into the application at run time. I'd say it makes it easier to edit routes and have a quick overview since the default ui-router declaration requires a ton of piping of state. \nBut obviously, in the case of the JS object, you can't take advantage of resolve or other similar features.\n. @kenwheeler I've been following the discussion and it looks like Angular 2.0 is not even close to ready. The announcement was made around a spec rather than an actual working prototype. There has been a lot of interesting discussion about it! :)\n. @rafibomb I already considered that but since we have only two controllers and they need each other, I found no reason to separate them. Plus, since we're not adding any additional controllers (and probably won't be), I can't justify making a folder with two controller files and adding those into dependencies, and try to cross-dependency them as well.\n. @gakimball this branch was supposed to allow non-hash URLs but it seems like we're testing out a new server. Kudos on that since we can use that plugin and my solution together. I made a couple of adjustments and this branch will be able to enable that feature plus clean up a bunch of stuff.\nWe can merge this in ASAP! :)\n. @gakimball can you look over this real quick? :) We got a working accordion directive! w00t!\n. @Martinspire there was a discussion on it and the thing is that SASS for Ruby is ahead of libsass (the cross-platform version of Sass used with Node) which means that Foundation for Apps can stay more cutting edge; however, some of the necessary features ARE getting implemented into Libsass so hopefully, we'll be able to switch right back! :)\nAnd again, I'm a Windows dev too so I feel you on the speed thing, Sass takes somewhere between 2-15 seconds to compile depending on Ruby's mood.\n. @Martinspire just as a sidenote, I'm a window guy, developing the angular side solely on a windows machine.  :)\nAs far as sudo, you're right, it should be \"open a CMD with administrative privileges\". I can go ahead and add some of this information to the readme. However, I'm not entirely sure what the entire process would be as I'm using a combination of Cmder (which comes with Msysgit), Chocolatey (a package manager), Unix tools for Windows and JRuby instead of Ruby (I've heard it has better support). \nUsing the Node installer though is pretty much the right way to go, I believe it sets the correct environment variable during install (so you can use it in the command line).\nSo how does this sound?\n1. Install Ruby with the official installer or use JRuby alternative.\n2. Install Msysgit to get Git. It might be worth looking into using Cygwin or Cmder both of which come with Msysgit and offer more feature-full console/terminal experience\n3. Since Windows does not have a sudo command, make sure your command line is running with administrative priveleges (right-click or shift-right-click and select \"Run as administrator...\")\nGood? If you have any input on the process, let me know! \n. I've just updated the README with these notes.\n. I generally never have to run as Admin and I will admit that I have a bad habit of doing so. I set u my CMD shortcut to automatically prompt administrative rights. Mainly because I hate having to relaunch my command prompt. I use CMDer and pretty much live in the command prompt so I don't ever open a prompt from a directory.\n. @gakimball I was working on a few tests this morning and found myself refactoring a bunch of the code and fixing several bugs (yay for somewhat TDD). I'd like to merge this in by the end of the week to get those bugs resolved if that's cool. We'd also have some initial tests to setup and work on in the future when necessary :)\n. @gakimball yep! I'll integrate the gulp-karma plugin when I get a chance.\n. @jakeleboeuf thanks! It turns out that I committed on master rather than a feature branch >.< so there's a half-built module with syntax issues. I deleted it and everything is in order now. \n. @jakeleboeuf Ahh! I issued a fix for that yesterday, it looks like it was overwritten by accident. Pull the latest master and you'll see it working!\nThe issue was that I was concating all the output css files and what that did was merge the app.css.map into the app.css.\nThanks for reporting these errors! :)\n. Issues:\n- [x] actionsheet causes block to scroll (possibly wrong class usage on the parent element on my end) \n- [x] popup shows up in the wrong place\n- [x] popup does not stay in place when scrolling - tether does not watch for scroll events in successive parents. (tether behavior mentioned in docs)\n- [x] custom actionsheet button causes actionsheet to show up in the wrong place. - tether doesn't seem to be the right solution for this (solved by allowing custom trigger elements within the container).\n. @gakimball I think this is just about ready to go if you want to do some peer review on it. I changed the actionsheet to work like so:\n``` html\n\n\nMy content!\n\n custom buttons \n\nMy better button\nMy content!\n\n```\n. @gakimball \nI can make sure that each directive accepts a \"onOpen\" and \"onClose\" function in the declaration. So as long as you specify a function in your controller, you can pass it along and have it fired like so:\n``` js\n//within controller\nscope.onModalClose = function() {\n  alert('are you sure?');\n}\n//on a directive\n\n```\nThis is how some other angular libraries solve the issue. Internally, the directive will make sure that onModalClose() gets run when its deactivating itself.\nI think that would be the best solution.\nOutside of that, there are some other things we can do:\n1. We can use a common FoundationApi emitter. So for example, each directive, on any action would publish through the API a generic \"event\" with a payload that describes the event like so ['modal', 'my-id', 'close']. That way anyone can just add a listener for the generic event and check if(whateverId == payload[1] && payload[2] == 'close') { }.\n2. We could also create non-generic events. So for instance, there could be a generic modal event which would tell us what the actual event was (like close). Or even more specifically a modal-close. All running through the FoundationApi\n3. We can use Angular's built-in event system described in this neat stackoverflow answer, which would mean that someone could hook into these events WITHOUT having to use FoundationApi. This is, obviously, not a great idea for any internal functionality but for something that's publicly exposed, might be worth looking into\nWhat do you think?\nnote there IS another option and it's already functional. Since anyone can hook into FoundationApi, they can just do this:\njs\nfoundationApi.subscribe('id-of-an-element-they-watch-for', function(payload) {\n   if(payload == 'active') {\n    //perform some logic\n  }\n});\n. @gakimball I merged in some of the branches, cool if I merge in this one? I'm not sure if there is any more work to be done here.\n. @gakimball So here's the gulp plugin. We'll have to move this to another repo if we want to push this out to NPM!\n. @gakimball well, it requires the foundation.init.js package that initializes the routing for it to work. I can keep it in a /bin folder for the time being or I can open a new repo (though I'm not good with names so I'll need some help!) and push it out to NPM, put it down as a dependency.\n. @gakimball I'll go ahead and merge this in then, and keep the plugin in a /bin directory for now. We can move it and change it as we go.\n. @gakimball I know we were going to create an markdown-based site docs, but would this suffice for the time being? I can even leave a note in the main README.md or I can rename it to ANGULAR.md and leave it at the root.\nThoughts?\n. @gakimball added, as far as the first link with the asset/template loading, that bug was fixed in the core library over a year ago.\n. @gakimball I keep seeing people wondering about the Angular documentation, would it make sense to merge this down? Or should I rewrite as part of all of the docs templates?\n. @gakimball sure thing. \n. PR is up\n. @zurbrandon do you mean in this case:\nhtml\n<fa-action-sheet>\n   <fa-as-button></fa-as-button>\n</fa-action-sheet>\nI can't replace it with fa-toggle since that directive already has certain logic that is generalized to work with all directives. The fa-as-button is a directive that handles the default button logic and templating. Unfortunately, I can't merge the logic of the two without adding lots of complexity.\n. @zurbrandon I didn't realize there were options for that but I'm adding them now, can you give me an example of the color class and the class that pins the notification in different places?\nAlso, as far as the static vs. dynamic notifications go, the reason the directives don't look the same is because the directive that fires a dynamic notifications has to contain all of the notification information while not being the notification itself while the static notification is just that, and can be toggled just like many of the other directives we have. I can't really make it more consistent than it is.\nOtherwise, there has to be some kind of a directive tag on the page to serve as an endpoint for the notifications. I don't really see a way around it, it's the container for the internal logic.\n. @zurbrandon andddd behavior standardized with #69 \n. Crap, I'll need to wait for the libsass branch to merge in -.-\n. @gakimball phew, that worked. Unfortunately, I have to keep this issue open until node-sass gets a fix. Gulp-sass doesn't even require a specific node-sass version so I can't even downgrade that to get the right node-sass version :/\n. @viztastic somewhat related. Unfortunately, node-sass requires both Python to be installed and Visual Studio (the express version at least). Here's the link to installation requirements: https://github.com/sass/node-sass#install\n@gakimball I'm thinking that this is getting a little crazy. Installing Ruby + Sass is much faster and easier than having to install Python and all this other crap. I'm not sure how the requirements are for OS X but since OS X already has Ruby pre-installed, this avenue may prove easier for both systems.\n. @jwvanderbeck I would definitely expect people to use Express with proper configuration for production and something like Forever to run the Node process rather than Gulp. That'd be non-nonsensical. You're on the right track. \nI would say that this stack is great for rapid prototyping and developing though :) \n. Did bower install all of your components correctly? That'd be the first place to check. Open up bower_components in your folder and check to see if those files are there or not.\n. @3lfist just fixed it, do a git pull to get the fix. Not sure why bower install wasn't run. The reason it's not in the docs is because it should run automatically with npm install (it's specified to do so in the package.json).\nLet me know if you hit on any other errors. I'm already aware of some issues for Windows users regarding libsass. \n. hmmm...strange. Okay. Can you give me the output of Gulp? Were there any errors? If you're getting a \"Cannot GET /\", that sounds like the copy task failed.\n. @3lfist hmm.. okay. Can you check if you have a build folder? And if you do, check if everything is in there (like index.html, assets/, etc.). If it's there, try to kill the gulp process and refresh localhost:8080. I wonder if there is a stray Node process that might be running and giving you trouble.\nIf you get the same message, that means you have a Node process running interfering with your new server. If you have a Mac, use the Activity Monitor and look for a \"node\" process and kill it. And try again.\nLastly, at the risk of sounding like a typical IT person, would you mind deleting all the node_modules and bower_components, doing a git pull again and rerunning the install process?\n. @3lfist you shouldn't have to sudo it. I see one problem already: there is no index.html. So for some reason, that's not getting copied. That's the heart of the issue.\nI'm on a Ubuntu VM and am experiencing the same problem so I'll go ahead and troubleshoot this on my machine and let you know how I got it resolved.\n. @3lfist issue is fixed. Just do a git pull. It seems like both OS X and Windows are forgiving when it comes to capitalizing folder names. Ubuntu, however, is not :)\n. @gakimball ah....well then, I'll go undo my work and rename the folder!\n. @gakimball urgh, so, changing uppercase to lowercase is turning out to be quite a task. \n. @gakimball phew, a few rebases, and forceful git pushes and it's good to go. :)\n. @jwvanderbeck please do a git pull, this issue has been resolved: https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/blob/master/js/angular/app.js#L24-L26\n. @jwvanderbeck :) everything is still being worked on quickly so things are bound to break once in a while.\n. @jwvanderbeck if you do a git pull, the issue will resolve itself, everything is set to 1.3.1 now.\n. On a sidenote, yay for automated testing! \n. Issues so far:\n- [x] interchange no longer renders on-page partials\n- [x] displaced tabs don't show up\n- [x] static notification doesn't fire.\n- [x] popup doesn't work\n. It looks liek\n. @gakimball btw, so here is the Iconic wrapper. It works simply:\n<div iconic>\n    <img data-src=\"#\" data-fallback=\"#\" ... /> // regular iconic declaration\n</div>\nThe Iconic directive fires an \"inject\"' on its child when invoked which makes Iconic register the icon and replace the <img> tag with its SVG declaration. \nThe reason a parent element is required is because the second the img gets replaced with an svg and kills all the bindings, including the directive and any other directives. The issue with that is that if we use ng-if or even ng-class on it, those will cease to function. This approach was recommended on the forums for this specific reason.\nI think the only way we could side-step this is to inform users that they cannot apply any logic to the icon img files. This would lead to a cleaner syntax:\n<img iconic data-src=\"#\" data-fallback=\"#\" ... /> //standard iconic declaration\n. @gakimball unfortunately, no, not without a parent element to keep track of it. I'll go ahead and make the change. \n. Right, the entire idea is to wrap it with whatever you want to use it for. But yeah, if you have a click event, it'd make more sense to wrap an img with an anchor.\n. @gakimball sweet! So those will be part of this repo?\n. I'm aware of the issue, the CI currently tries to run gulp-sass on the latest version on every test. We've got our first passing build today so this issue has been resolved.\n. Yep, the master branch is passing. I'll have to test it on my machine and solidify the dependency when I get a chance.\nThanks for the heads up!\n. Anddd updated.\n. @jwvanderbeck You're on the right track. In fact, the app.js is meant for the rapid prototyping for users that don't want to learn/use angular explicitly. If you're not a fan and want to run your own code, or get rid of the dynamic routing, just erase this line:\nFoundationStateProvider.registerDynamicRoutes();\nThis is part of the foundation.init module, which also runs this line in app.js:\nfoundationInit.init();\nYou're welcome to delete those and run your own thing. Unfortunately, foundationInit.init() initializes some things, and one of them is the setup for interchange so without the module, interchange won't work.\nOne thing is clear, I really need to add all the inter-dependencies so that Angular can warn you if you're missing something. Pretty much all directives depend on common.* for FoundationApi and all of the basic fa-open/fa-close directives. These are located in js/angular/common.\nI started on some documentation, and you can check it out here, it's on another branch and should answer most of your questions.\nThe point of this entire thing was actually not to make it dependent on the structure. Everything should be portable, everything should be a module that you can easily inject. \nLet me know if that makes any sense! :)\n. @ilanbiala @jwvanderbeck I don't have time right now to write out a full response but both of what you are proposing we're already doing:\n- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template <- this is a startup repo that's meant to be a full-on solution for someone that doesn't want to mess with things. Though, they still can.\n- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps <- this is the main code repository. Bower install it, use what you want to use.\nNothing is tied to the app.js nor anything else. You can carry over whatever files you want to use. The app.js is a full-on solution but there is nothing forcing you to use it or even reference it. Use bower install, use gulp to include all of the files in the subfolders of js/angular: common, directives, partials, etc. and build your own App.js. DI is there for a reason, so that you don't have to use everything but only what you want/need. If you only need modals, use those, and don't include any of the other components in your build process, and just reference it in your app.js DI so that they're loaded into your app. \nWant to update? No problem, do a bower update and you'll get fresh everything (once there is a release and proper versions).\nMeanwhile, designers can indulge in f-apps-template which brings over all the logic from f-apps but with your own templates to use. And you still get the updates via bower install. \nI'll have to get back to everyone when I have time for it (probably on Monday). But does that not cover it? \n. Very exciting! :)\n. @ilanbiala I was under the impression that a native forEach loop wasn't fully supported across browsers. I'll keep angular.forEach for the time being.\n. @ilanbiala I checked the es5 support chart, looks like I'm a little behind times. Thanks for that catch! :)\n. Try using the Angular directives:\nhtml\n<div fa-panel id=\"my-panel\">panel content</div>\n<a href=\"#\" fa-toggle=\"my-panel\">toggle panel</a>\n. @jwvanderbeck hmm. What does your app.js look like? I wonder if you're missing a dependency or something. Did any errors show up in your console?\nCase #2 is the correct usage so I'm wondering why it's not firing. it works fine on this end.\n. Ah, yeah, that was a bug that was fixed some time ago. The has function is part of jQuery and was replaced with another. \n. @jwvanderbeck sure thing. It's a little difficult since f-apps hasn't had a first release yet so it's one of those \"move fast, break things\" situations. \n. @jwvanderbeck the app is not broken. I just did a git clone and started a brand new project, the panel works as it should. \nI think the confusion comes from the docs files that are currently not up to date. When you're running the base app, check out localhost:8080/playground or the docs/templates/page.html file to see how it's supposed to work in Angular. That's the working version. \nIf that doesn't help, please, either create a repo for your app so I can check it out and troubleshoot it or post your application bootstrap file or html. I'm not entirely sure where things could have gone wrong.\n. Yep, duplicate. Closing it out. \n. good idea, I'll set that up\n. Anddd done. Perfect, it errored because gulp-sass could not compile the SASS correctly.\n. yep, it works. I'll go ahead and merge this in. We'll have a broken build, however, until node-sass gets a fix. \n. yeah, I just removed some of the other older branches that I kept up.\n. Whoops, i deleted them this morning, forgot to mention it!\n. @ilanbiala can you elaborate on the error? I'm not seeing it.\n. Since this was already fixed in another issue, I'm closing it. Let me know if you have any further trouble.\n. I've identified the issue, the fix should be out tomorrow. \n. The docs aren't fully finished but the issue is fixed.\n. The problem is how Angular handles its animations and how the UI Router delegates it. Angular has some cool helper classes like .ng-enter and .ng-enter-active. The animate module is as close you as you can get. It works..well, mostly. \n. @gakimball In a moment of epiphany, I realized why the \"flashing\" issues might be here (add fadeIn and the content fade outs and fades back in). One of them is that the transition timing and controls are on that element itself. That means that to get to an initial state, fadeIn will fade the element back out.\nIf there was a way to add an intermediate step, we could have our cake and eat it, too. Meaning that we could have an \"initial state\" (which would be opacity:0), an animated state (transition-* properties) and finally a final state (opacity: 1). I don't want to get into a class-itis type of deal but that seems to be a good way to solve the issue: go immediately to initial state, add transition timing and properties, animate to final state. Perhaps we could have a fadeIn class, a fadeIn-transitions class, and a is-active to activate the animation.\nThoughts?\n. @jpdesigndev I'd remove all of those classes once the animation is done. I'm not sure how the repaint works but I'm guessing the browser is forced to do so during the animation anyways. \n. @gakimball this seems to be working. well, mostly. For the active classes, there's a space between class selectors so that instead of .fadeIn.ng-enter.ng-enter-active, there's .fadeIn.ng-enter .ng-enter-active. I add the enter/enter-active classes manually which makes me wonder why having the previous is-active way of initializing animations didn't work. \nThe enter/enter-active classes don't get automatically added for programmatic solutions.\n. Yeah, the CSS looks a bit wonky:\n```\n.fadeIn.ng-enter {\n  opacity: 0;\n  transition-property: -webkit-transform, opacity;\n  transition-property: transform, opacity;\n  transition-duration: 700ms;\n  transition-timing-function: ease;\n  transition-delay: 0; }\n  .fadeIn.ng-enter.ng-enter-active, .fadeIn.ng-enter .ng-leave-active {\n    opacity: 1; }\n.fadeOut.ng-leave {\n  opacity: 1;\n  transition-property: -webkit-transform, opacity;\n  transition-property: transform, opacity;\n  transition-duration: 700ms;\n  transition-timing-function: ease;\n  transition-delay: 0; }\n  .fadeOut.ng-leave.ng-enter-active, .fadeOut.ng-leave .ng-leave-active {\n    opacity: 0; }\n```\nNow if only I understood SASS as much as I would like to, lol\n. Anddd done. I used a trick from Angular's internal ngAnimate code to stop the transition from happening internally, using a $rootScope.$digest to force a reflow/repaint, removing the transition block, and appending an end-state class to trigger the transition. Sweet.\n. This should be ready to merge. :)\n. Gulp-sass gets continually tested by Travis-CI every time we push a commit. It's a good gauge as to what version currently works. I'm thinking of locking it down once we get a green light from Travis.\n. Ah.. makes sense. Thanks I'll get that fixed.\n. Got a fix in the works.\n. Hmm, it looks like a deeper issue based on your screenshot. Can you show me the output of gulp? Some of the files seem like never compiled.\n. I don't believe the docs have live examples at the moment. Go to http://localhost:8080/playground to see all the components in action! :)\n. So, are you still having the same trouble? If you are, when gulp is done building, check the build/assets/js folder and see if there is a routes.js file. If it is, check it out inside and see if there is a var foundationRoutes in there with a long object definition.\n. Hmm, that's strange, removing foundationRoutes should make the application unusable. Are you on the latest commit? \n. @mikehuebner can you confirm if this is still an issue or not? Some things have changed in the codebase. If the problem still persists, I can try helping you troubleshoot it further.\nI'll go ahead and reopen this when you let me know.\n. Yay! =D\n. That last error means that you have another process running under port 8080. If you have WAMP or Ruby or any other server running on that port, shut it down. \nExit out of any Node processes as well and if you do, check your task manager (advanced view) to see if Node is still running. This can happen once in a while and used to be happen to me all the time on a Mac. \nIf you STILL can't make it work and still get the same error, check out this stackoverflow question and scroll down to the Resource Monitor answer and run that. And again, check port 8080 for what could be blocking your Node process.\n. @ilanbiala can you clarify for me the following comment:\n\nThe issue is that bower_components hasn't been changed to public/lib in the gulpfile, once I changed that, 0 errors.\n\nwhere is public/lib coming from?\n. @jpdesigndev do you mean dynamically? It wouldn't scale plus it's no simple task hunting down all of the possible absolutely-positioned objects in the view to move it outside of the view while trying to make sure the view animations don't happen until all of the objects have been moved.\nNon-dynamically? (as in, actually just change the DOM so I don't have to deal with the problem) Yeah, that can be done but that's just avoiding a problem, plus it introduces a slew of other issues (like having to force users to declare off-canvas, panels, and other elements in their index.html).\n. No problem :)\n. that panel thing we talked about yesterday is exactly it!\n. yep, that'd work. I'll test it out.\n. Fixed\n. @gakimball I've written a pretty neat animate service that lives under the foundationApi (I might move it, not sure) but it has two methods:\n1. animate - which works VERY similarly to how our view animation works\n2. toggleAnimate - which works how our element animation works -> by toggling the active class\nI'm hoping to use these two methods to replace how animation works on the elements we discussed: panel, offcanvas, and notification. However, I can't append any extra animation information to these elements since these elements have built-in animation (.panel.is-active for instance). I'd love to get these out of the standard definition and into the service I've written.\nSo, for instance for panel, I could write in the directive definition that slideFromLeft (or wherever) is the default animation and to use toggleAnimation to activated it or deactivate it. If the user declares both animationIn and animationOut, we'd use that animation instead.\nWhat do you think?\nEDIT And we could add this logic to any element that uses foundationApi (most directives) and allow these options. It's a 4-5 liner in terms of directive logic.\n. @ilanbiala angular and the foundation structure to trigger animation. Plain JS and Angular's built-in features to add and remove CSS classes, do resets, and reflows. And finally, CSS transformations for the animation itself.\n. @gakimball this is pretty much ready to go. I'll fix the merge conflicts and we can get this into master! :)\n. @gakimball there are plenty of Node libraries that do very quick diffing. I can wire up some rudimentary unit test that will import the gulp-sass and gulp-ruby-sass stylesheets and see if they're equal. We can employ that. It'd be an interesting test to see what the differences between the libraries are. \n. @gakimball I got the test prototype setup, not sure how well it's working but I'll get it working. For now though, I'm going to push this off as a low priority?\n. @gakimball whoops, look like one place I forgot to change fa to zf. I'll  check the rest of the project.\n. @gakimball this is ready :)\n. The docs aren't functional yet. Clicking on a link that has a href=\"#\" causes that error. It'll be fixed once the docs are finished.\n. To explain what's happening here (and explain why the test is set to automatically pass):\n1. the two CSS files differ greatly. According to JsDiff, there are ~300 CSS rules that do not match. On top of that, libsass likes to list selectors in a single line while ruby-sass likes to list them vertically (one selector per line).\n2. Because I'm on windows, and libsass uses windows executable, line endings are Windows style (^M if you view it in VIM), this means that this is probably throwing off the diffing lib. For some reason, these line-endings are present only in comments.\n3. The diffing lib sometimes fails. I haven't found a library that could diff everything correctly. The JsDiff comes close by being able to do a diffCss rather than line-by-line or whatever else.\nI'd love to see if there is any work done on this elsewhere because it seems like a big problem if you have up to 300 mismatched CSS rules. (or they could be false positives).\nI'll be merging this in as is until a better solution is presented.\n. Dead links in the docs will do that. That will be fixed by v1 I believe. I made an off-shoot from the docs for testing and developing all of the components: http://localhost:8080/#!/playground if you go through there, you'll see the Angular components right at work. if you check out the corresponding raw files, you'll find the syntax to use. \n. @ilanbiala the href=\"#\" is there in order to have a regular link pointer. If it still goes through and messes up, there's something wrong in the way it's setup so that's a good thing to keep in mind. Is it still messing up somewhere?\n@goids the playground was deleted upon release. It was a place for me to rapidly develop and since everything is now in the docs, there was no need for it anymore.\n. What we can do is setting overlay to exist when overlay-close is set to true (no sense in allowing overlay-close if there's no overlay), and allow independent setting of the overlay with overlay=\"true\"\n. @zurbrandon problem, so I made the change but without the overlay, the modal doesn't show up correctly. Is there any other class I can substitute to make it work correctly?\n. @zurbrandon can you give me the proper markup for a modal? I think it's changed way too much since I originally wrote the directive.\n. @zurbrandon I have a (potential) fix in one of the other branches, hopefully it'll work! :)\n. @ilanbiala thanks for the catch. It looks like I left the scope.apply in the wrong place. It was supposed to be run after FoundationApi informs the tab that it needs to activate. It's required there because when FoundationApi triggers an update within a directive, AngularJS doesn't go through its regular digest cycle (no DOM changes happen).\n. This is a duplicate of #122.\nSome of the Docs aren't completely ready. This should be fixed in v1. Check out the playground: http://localhost:8080/#!/playground  It's a place where I test all of the Angular development and all of the directives work there.\n. Thanks for the catch! I'll get on it.\n. @josteinhanssen so I fixed the programming error; however, I haven't gotten to the styles.\nI'll have to leave in the skilled hands of @gakimball. There seem to be some IE CSS bugs. \n. @antjanus note to self: get this done. \n. Sure thing. If you check out the angular readme for FA, you'll find some examples there. But here's how it works in a nutshell.\nYou have to have a parent view, let's call it mail and it'd have a declaration like so:\n``` html\nname: mail\nurl: /mail\n\nThis is your mail!\n\n\n```\nThen you can have a child view. Let's say, it's out inbox:\n``` html\nname: mail.inbox\nurl: /inbox\n\n This is your inbox!\n```\nAnd that it's. It'll be now accessible via the composed url of /mail/inbox. To access inbox, you'd do a <a href=\"#\" ui-sref=\"mail.inbox\">Inbox!</a>, no matter where you're at, even if you're in the parent view. Ui-router may have a shorthand if you're accessing a child view, but stick to putting down the full name.\nDoes that make sense? \nEDIT\nThere are also other ways to create a child with a different naming scheme. Let me redo the inbox with it:\n``` html\nname: inbox\nurl: /inbox\nparent: mail\n\n```\nThis way, you can use ui-sref like so ui-sref=\"inbox\". I could be wrong (I'm not near my code right now) but test it out! :)\n. Foundation for Apps is all Angular with nothing back-end falling into it so it should fit neatly into MEAN. Since, doesn't MEAN stand for: Mongo, Express, Angular, Node? All of the components are decoupled and have a single dependency necessary to function correctly, the FoundationApi service. You can also import the common directives module which houses some hookups for FoundationApi that you'd probably have to write yourself anyways (like a event handlers that open/close/toggle foundation components).\nThe ui router components of FA aren't necessary for any of the components to work; however, they are necessary to work with the templating system we created which is almost jekyll-like with front matter deciding routes, child/parent relationships, title, and animations. Along with that, there's an animation component which depends on this front matter templating. However, all of that is optional. And if you DO want to use it, you can still plug in most of that logic to any other Angular project; however, it WILL take some work.\nOutside of that, you're free to do whatever with it and should work with any Angular setup. \nAs far as MeteorJS/Blaze, I'm not aware of either of those playing well with Angular but I'm not well versed in using either technology. So, shortly said, it's the same deal as MEAN with the added complexity of \"does Angular at all work well with Meteor?\"\n. V1 is focused on Angular. It's the most proliferate MVC framework out there by far. It also fits the prototype paradigm really well. If you're venturing out beyond Angular, you should be able to port the interactions by yourself without a problem (it's easy to do with jQuery, easy with VanillaJS, should be simple enough with everything else); Angular is used to add a bunch of sugar on top for Angular devs and for designers that don't want to deal with programming but want better prototyping tools.\nRegular foundation includes a jQuery version.\nAs far as VanillaJS:\n1. the styling is already all there so you can create all of the components without interaction.\n2. most components are class-driven. Meaning that you just need to add a class for it to be enabled. For instance, to enable a modal, just add is-active to it. If you want to enable an accordion item, add is-active to it. This is pretty simple to do in Vanillajs.\n3. if you have jQuery, then you can rely on the jQuery version of the Foundation components.\nI think this is all pretty self-explanatory.\nEDIT As an FYI, I've no idea what's in store for FA for the future, just wanted to add my 2 cents.\n. @zimt28 no work has been done on it. \n. Awesome! Thanks! :)\n. I decided to add titles to all of the docs pages. I think it'd be worth the time to go through and figure out which docs pages need to be deleted.\n. Yep! Plus it'll force me to actually use the Docs over my playground! ;)\n. @jcs224 Please run Gulp and post the output, and run npm install before that if you haven't already.\n. Using relative templates runs into a lot of issues with HTML5Mode (which would then require a base). I guess anyone that uses HTML5mode (and turns it on), will have to figure out the requireBase thing.\nI'll go ahead and have the fix on master.\n. I just checked it. The config.path always comes out as a relative path for me in every instance. Console.log out the entire config (check the endstream and console log out configs) to see if the path is the issue.\nIf you're talking about the URLs themselves, the ui-router has a list of solutions for that: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#solution\nHowever, I'm not sure if that's the issue.\n. @mrsweaters could be a difference in the way the OS handles filesystems and it might not make a difference in the way the app works when it's in the root but it might in a subdirectory (I'm running Windows so I can't see how it behaves on OSX or Linux). Can you try to console log out the relativePath and the other variables just in case? I can go ahead and implement a cross-platform fix once I know what to look for.\n. Ah crap. @gakimball can you confirm this is still an issue? The thing with the double/single quotes is that IE, FF, AND Chrome parse this crap differently. I added some logic earlier today when FF started to fail again. I wonder if it got resolved.\n. I'm hoping my last fix attempt resolved this. I'm going to close this out until it comes up again.\n. @gakimball we can't have two config files loaded into the app though. Should we then keep the js/angular/app.js pristine and not even loaded while the docs/assets/js/app.js does all the work with the extra modules?\nNor can we add dependencies after the configuration.\n. @zurbrandon it seems to be a modal overlay issue. It has a display:none attached to it but it also has a display:flex which overrides the display none. Since it has a transition on it, it flashes in-n-out. It seems that the display: flex should be part of the is-active declaration.\nBecause otherwise, for some reason, it simply fades out to opacity: 0.\nI'm not sure if this is entirely correct but that seems to be what's currently happening. However, if we do add display: flex on is-active, the entire thing will not animate :/\n. @gakimball so I finished the directive animations so yes, this should work. The overlay uses the same custom animations logic with hard-coded fadeIn and fadeOut values. So, if you get rid of the transitions attached directly to the overlay, everything should work correctly! :)\n. no clue why I reopened this.\n. The path should be relative to the site itself. The contents of the docs get copied to build which is the root of the site (so, docs itself does not get copied). Try the URLs without /Docs and see if that works.\n. I made a fix in the docs and the interchange logic. All working now! :)\n. I actually have no way of closing it out. The scroll event doesn't bubble up so if the user scrolls any container within the window, the popup will stay there.\nAnd attaching a scroll event listener to every container in the window is impractical and would mess up performance.\n. Urgh. I've been struggling with that bug for a long time, thought I had it solved!\nThanks for the heads up. Do you know which FF version you're using?\n. Fixed anyways.\n. Fixed.\n. This is related to #156. The modal overlay does not have a display: none set to it when it's not active and it has a transition attached to it, that causes it (on modern browsers) to do a \"flash\" when it's loaded. On IE10, the overlay also registers click events which cause it to appear and disappear (flash).\n@gakimball can you implement the logic we discussed where .modal-overlay has a display:none and no transitions and then is-active adds the display: flex? That way my animation logic can fade it in using the regular fadeIn class and we can bypass all these problems?\n. I'll give this a shot. If it still doesn't work, we might want to consider rolling back to the original way we got all those styles with meta elements being added one by one.\n. FF is being ridiculous. It works fine if you:\n1. double parse it. Seriously. First time around, it becomes a proper \"string\", second time around, it's an object\n2. eval it and then parse it. Same result. Wtf?\n. Fixed it -.- logic looks way better now too. Yay.\n. @cvrebert those are all good points. Currently, the branch I just merged in will change focus to the modal but not back. This is because there may be numerous originating elements and there is currently no implementation to send the origin element to the modal in order to send the focus back.\nI'd like to definitely get that on the way though.\n. hmm.. I'm not entirely sure how to prevent that. ideas?\n. I'll check out their code. Thanks for the tip!\n. Phew, so this is becoming more difficult than I thought. Just some notes to myself:\n1. when a tether is activated, it's moved outside of the view and attached to the body. When a view changes and comes back, it's still present and the view creates a second copy\n2. destroying the tether when view changes works; however, if one does not change the view, the tether destruction is irreversible and creates errors (edit nvr mind, it doesn't actually destroy it, wtf).\n3. unless there is a dependency on $state or a similar service, there's no way to distinguish between a view change and hiding the element regularly.\n. @gakimball I fixed 2/3rd of the commands so that most of them should work now. The problem is on the Node side (or perhaps Windows side?) where exec only runs executables, not scripts or whatever else. For some reason npm works with npm.cmd and bower works with bower.cmd. However, I couldn't get bundle to work at all. I'm not a 100% sure why.\nI noticed that the gulp-ruby-sass package uses win spawn which allows for cross-platform exec and spawn. I'll give regular spawn a shot as it might work better.\n. I changed a few things around. As long as bundler and ruby are installed correctly, the cli should work right (note that it hasn't been tagged and released yet). I changed a few things around, implemented a few fixes from win spawn and successfully installed several apps (just to make sure it works!).\n@jsmreese I'm running a similar setup (jruby 1.7.15, Sass 3.4.7 and I'm on Windows 8, best windows there is). Sass was installed via bundler (the gulpfile specifies bundleExec on the command too). I wonder if that makes a difference?\n. @gakimball The bundler thing is weird since the method I used should have covered every case. It literally uses a secondary process to run a command. Should've been foolproof, It's what ruby-sass uses to run their command so I'm pretty surprised it doesn't work! O.O I can try to integrate the win-spawn package that has a more robust cross-platform solution. I can't test it for others though so it'd be a hit/miss situation.\n@narration I have Windows 8.1 64-bit just as you do. The weird thing is, I tried bundle.bat and it failed that's why I resorted to the solution I have which really should have been a slam dunk, a last resort that should work no matter what. This discrepancy among the same operating systems sucks. Can't imagine why.\nOut of curiosity what version of Ruby are you using?\n. @FlatspinZA thanks for posting that! \n. @narration using a table of possibilities could end with a lot of issues. However, I retested your solution this morning and it seems to work. Not sure why it didn't work me earlier. Definitely much simpler than my solution. \nAlso, much to my displeasure, it looks like I never published the bundler fix in the first place -.- >.<\nEverything is updated now and working.\n. :+1: \n. @JeroenNoten one thing about using the application module is that it doesn't work well with other angular apps. It sets routing so that would most likely break your existing app. Thus the name application, as a standalone app. I did open an issue for possibly transforming it into a dependency.\nIt's much better to take the application dependencies and import everything module by module (or whatever you'd use) rather than trying to integrate the entire structure. That would make more sense to me. Most of them have internal dependencies set so you'd know what you need to import in order to make it work.\nThe only exceptions are foundation.common.directives module which has all the directive helpers (zf-close, zf-open, etc.), and the foundation.init module which is required by Interchange (you'll have to check the app.js to see how it's used there) for media query extraction and resize event listener\n. I'm going to close this out to continue the discussion in #223 \n. Try doing a manual npm install\n. @stryju there are some issues with your code:\n1. there are numerous comments and JSHint declarations that currently do not match the code style of the rest of the application. \n2. you're also using function declarations instead of function expressions. I will eventually move the codebase to function declarations in self-invoking blocks (as per certain AngularJS style guides) but until then, I'd like to keep everything coherent\n3. there's also the case of this vs $scope. I'm not a fan of using this at all in JS since it changes context so fluidly. SO has a good discussion on the $scope. vs this topic, but overall, using this is dangerous. \n4. Lastly, the NavController is unrelated to the dynamic routing. In fact, I moved it straight to the actual docs app and outside of the rest of FAs stuff. It's used to generate autocomplete for the docs and nothing else. That's why it binds a bunch of stuff to the $scope directly.\n. @stryju the idea is sound and lends extra functionality to AngularJS devs. I like that a lot though I imagine that Angular devs would rather use their own routing rather than use FAs dynamic routing; however, I'd like to add this to the app!\nThanks for all the work!\n. @stryju you make a good case for the usage of this. I just opened an issue #262 to discuss style guidelines. Once that is in order (and I get the go ahead), I'll start refactoring everything.\nAs far as the usage of this, I'll go one step further to embrace what the style guides recommend: assigning this to a variable in order to prevent context-switching this. That would definitely solve the issues I could see propping up while solving the issues you're discussing as well.\nIf you can go ahead and refactor your branch to follow the current guide lines and make it mergeable, I can go ahead and merge it in. Let me know if that's cool with you.\n. use $scope for now until the refactor and discussion on guidelines take place.\n. @codymorgan if you use the framework, you can specify a title per view (you'll have to add some logic, check out the docs). It looks like in this case, the different child views were not given separate titles, that's all.\nThe history is an intended effect so you can go back through your browsing history of the app.\n. Hmmm, not that I'm aware of. It should be the equivalent of clicking on a link and going to a different page on a static website.\n. Seems to be an error that only props up with non-functioning URLs that don't use the regular ui-sref but instead link to nowhere href=\"#\". This causes a JS error (as it should) and will not cause any issues in production. The 2 history states are probably, one to an invalid state and one back to a valid state.\n. @gakimball the template files should be separate 90% of the time. The only exception is for templates that are (literally) one-liners that can be easily read. I'm wary of inlining some and not others. The ones I've inlined so far are usually placeholder templates (like <div></div>).\n@BraunreutherA I opened an issue to discuss the practices. It may make more sense to have a folder based separation so that /accordion has the HTML templates and the JS file together. It'll be easier to import.\n. @davidgeary right, the app.js is more of an example. The original point was to have people import everything module-by-module and use app.js as a reference on how to initialize everything.\nAs far as the folder structure, are you suggesting something like /zf-components/ with all of the components in there? So /zf-components/panel and /zf-components/interchange?\n. @kathyqian this should already be implemented. Can you double-check it on your device?\n. There's a Utils factory in https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/blob/master/js/angular/common/common.services.js#L120 which holds a throttle. Check FoundationApi for getSettings (https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/blob/master/js/angular/common/common.services.js#L29) which will return a list of settings, including the queries.\n. since this is a ruby gem issue and not an issue with FA, I'll go ahead and close this out. If you still need help, you can go ahead and still comment. I know that things are a bit confusing with Ruby on Windows.\n. The router DOES allow named views. I'll definitely look into using that for this applicaiton.\n. @davidkpiano I'll go ahead and use your solution since the dynamic router is currently not setup to support named views on the root template\n. Open up localhost:8080 and see what shows up. The error basically means that another process is running at the same port. Whether it's a Node process or otherwise. I know that, for instance, Skype runs on port 80 on Windows, and WAMP and sometimes MAMP run on 8080 which would create a conflict.\nIf you're on a Mac, go to your activity manager (I think that's what it's called) and search for Node. Kill all that process and try again.\n. This is an unrelated error the to the one in the issue.\nTry running npm install in the directory. And try to do an npm install -g gulp as well to make sure you have gulp installed.\n. @circlingthesun I'm not sure about the value, BUT, it is VERY easy to trigger a modal. And, in fact, you can trigger 90% of the components out of the box. How? FoundationApi.\nIf you're using a controller, include FoundationApi as a dependency (and let's say, name it fa). And then just do this:\nfa.publish('id-of-my-modal', 'show')  and it will show up immediately. If you want to hook into the process, just add another subscriber:\nfa.subscribe('id-of-my-modal', function(msg) { console.log(msg); }); and whenever someone sends a message to the modal (to open it or otherwise), your function will be run as well.\n. @maxcook this is a bug, not something you should have to worry about, you're right.\n. @ilanbiala can you be more specific?\nThe only errors I've seen are related to the use of href=\"#\" which will not show up once the sample apps are implemented into your application.\n. Are you running your application in a subfolder on your app server? That may cause the issue. There are some workarounds for that in order for Angular to know to look into a subfolder rather than root. Might be worth looking into.\n. I implemented all of the features on #300. \n. @akiran have you tested that it still works as an element?\n. @akiran I'll have to change the snippet itself. This directive does not play well with element-style declarations because of its controller and require structure.\nIn fact, doing attribute-only or element-only structures work; however, mix and matching will produce errors (so zf-action-sheet with a child of div zf-as-button. I'd rather stick to one that works than both and have users open up issues that seem to be directly with Angular rather than with FA.\nWhat do you think?\n. What I meant was that AngularJS is pretty moody. If you create an entire declaration in elements, it works. If you create it in attributes, it works. You can test it out with the Action Sheet.\nTry to use your fix and create one which mix/matches the element/attribute declaration (not restriction, but the actual markup you put on your site) like s;\nhtml\n<a href=\"#\" zf-toggle=\"my-actionsheet\">toggle</a>\n<div zf-action-sheet id=\"my-actionsheet\">\n<zf-as-button>my button goes here</zf-as-button>\n<zf-as-content position=\"bottom\">\nMy content goes here\n</zf-as-content>\n</div>\nIt immediately fails for some reason, can't figure out why.\nAs far as long-term, not sure what I'll decide to do.\n. @stryju right, the problem is the different ways to declare elements. Some people don't feel comfortable creating an Element over an Attribute. It would make sense to me that both would work the same way but when you mix them, they don't.\n. @akiran i kept running into issues but I'll give it another shot tomorrow. It has happened more than I'd like to admit where something didn't work, and the next day, there were no issues at all.\n. Well, what do you know, it works. I'll go ahead and merge this in! :)\n. ha! Good catch.\n. That happens when a link points to href=\"#\" without an event listener to stop its default action. Can you tell me what you clicked on to get this error?\n. Check out the controller code. It stores front matter vars in scope.vars. Go ahead and apply the same logic to your own controller. \n. @gakimball I changed a few things around so that the regular JS dependencies (tether, fastclick, etc.) get compiled into dependencies.js while all the angular stuff + the app.js get compiled to app.js. \nI'm wanting to do the same thing on this repo (i already did it on the templates). What do you think?\n. Everything should work now.\n. Fixed via #302 \nIt currently checks that the click originated from an element that has an href. That would make much more sense.\n. Finally fix.\n. Very good to know. I was about to upgrade too. I'm using 1.7.15 as well.\n. @stryju @davidgeary @gakimball I got the initial new structure in place. I was wondering if I could get some feedback! Here are some things:\n1. all components are now in components/ separated by folder according to what they are.\n2. routing is now separated into foundation.dynamicRouting and foundation.dynamicRouting.animations. Adding foundation.dynamicRouting as a dependency automatically runs the correct initializations. It also contains the DefaultController which is used by the dynamicRouting module. \n3. all the components can be imported via foundation.components (without importing dynamicRouting).\n4. foundation.interchange configuration is now run from the module and does not have to be manually run outside of there.\n5. Everything should be MUCH easier to run and use.\nI'll continue with the rest of the changes but would love to get the new structure in place first.\n. One more note, I'm pretty set on the naming scheme which is a combination of namespacing and camelCase. So, for instance, foundation is our main namespace. All of our components go under foundation.components. \nI'm thinking of breaking apart the components and placing them under that naming scheme so there'd be a foundation.components.accordion, foundation.components.common (for zf-toggle, etc.), foundation.components.modal. I'm not sure if that's better or using the easier namespacing with foundation.modal, foundation.accordion, etc.\nDynamic routing is under foundation.dynamicRouting, which makes sense and its additional animation module can be imported with another foundation.dynamicRouting.animations. Though, again, I'm wondering if dynamicRouting should be the main import and then split up the rest into foundation.dynamicRouting.init (or .main) and foundation.dynamicRouting.animations. I can see lots of situations where animations would not be necessary. I like that it's camelCase since foundation.dynamic.routing just doesn't make sense.\nI'd love some feedback on this too.\n. I think I'll make it part of the foundation.services module which includes the FoundationApi which houses globalSettings that interchange uses to access the media queries and that others can use as well.\n. Urgh, I'm afraid to merge master into this\n. @stryju you're right! I'll go ahead and add that.\n. no, no, the other way, just to resolve conflicts. With all the bug-fixes I've done since I started this branch, I'm a little afraid! :)\n. Urgh, so I am not looking forward to fast forwarding this. it'll probably involve a lot of copy-pasting, and figuring out conflicts. But anyways, other than the require part, this is ready to go.\n. @gakimball how should we proceed with this? We can release this today or with the a future version bump. I'd prefer the latter since there may be some Gulp change this will require\n. Andddd this is ready to go. The only part that I have skimmed on was the require part which I feel like is not 100% necessary.\nI'd like to merge this in ASAP to master so that any subsequent PRs won't interfere with it!\nThanks everyone for all the help!\n. @stryju we'll be releasing a bump this or next week. Next week most likely.\n. @japhar81 I'm not sure why you'd get the error. Have you tried tracking it down the stack? I'll look at it sometime tomorrow or this upcoming week and will let you know what I come up with.\n. Strange. Maybe @gakimball can shed some light on this as well. It seems to work correctly on Firefox and when I inspected this step-by-step, there is only ONE element. It seems like Chrome keeps a second rendered copy for some reason, that's not present in the DOM.\nI tested this out several times and at certain times, I had only half the element showing (the one in place, not the animating one), and sometimes it worked just as expected.\n. I think a -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; added to the animation elements (and possibly the parent) will fix the problem.\n. @wtfribley can you tell me which ones you experience this behavior with? Perhaps I can translate the class from the initial directive declaration to a more suitable target element\n@gakimball where do you see that? I might have fixed this bug with refactor because the overlays don't appear for me in the examples. (except where they should)\n. @gakimball if you remember, setting overlay-close automatically overrides overlay=\"false\" so that the overlay show ups. I can change that if you want.\n@wtfribley thanks! I'll get that taken care of.\n. @gakimball sounds good! \n. @gakimball the built-in animation is fadeIn and fadeOut. If it slides, that means that there is an animation defined directly on the notification element. And indeed, there is a transition: transform on it and translation. We'd need to cut that out, and it should work as intended! :)\n. sounds good!\n. @gakimball we're using this class, hardcoded, as part of all the directives. Since we globalSettings is available via the FoundationApi, perhaps we can use it to specify custom active classes on the front-end, too.\n. @gakimball sure thing\n. @gakimball I keep getting an error when running Gulp:\nError: app.scss:1:1: Unclosed block\n. I was going to open the same issue this morning! :) Glad to see others thinking along the same lines.\n. Does the panel itself flash or are you talking about the how the scrollbar shows up on the side?\nI'm on Ubuntu 14.04 Chrome 38 and couldn't replicate the issue (might be the version bump).\n. @gakimball I was thinking of modifying the animation method in FoundationApi (how our various elements animated) to add an animating class or similar. Would it make sense so that we can prevent issues like this?\nFor instance, we could do:\ncss\n.animating {\n  overflow: hidden;\n}\n. Urgh, so it turns out it's not a panel issue. There's something about the animation that makes the grid-block several parents up get a scroll bar. Removing the relative declaration on grid-block fixes this problem; however, I'm not sure how that would play out with the rest of the CSS so I can't foresee a solution to this.\n. Right right, that makes sense. So what would you propose as a solution?\n. @akiran I'd like to merge your PR in; however, it looks like we merged in some changes that makes yours unmergeable. Can you make the proper changes to make it mergeable? I'll go ahead and merge it in then.\n. sounds good!\n. @akiran there's a pull request #282 that I'll be merging in this week (as soon as possible). It'll do all kinds of cool stuff. One of the major changes is changing the root module's name.\n. I'm working on a refactor #282 that will package most of foundation configurations and dependencies into a module called foundation that you can include and it'll already set a bunch of stuff up for you. There's also foundation.dynamicRoutes and foundation.dynamicRoutes.animation and those are for the dynamic routing.\nWhen working on your own project, just include these dependencies as well as their dependencies just like you listed. You'll also need to setup your $locationProvider; however, all of these settings are trivial to create and should not be dependent on FA, if that makes sense. So any changes to your app.js will come from you while any changes to configuration, directives, directive templates, etc. will come from the FA repository/package.\nDoes that make sense? \n. @micjamking the CLI tool is not necessary for this process. You can do exactly what you said, and use Gulp or other build tool to pull in all the necessary files and include them.\n. Since Foundation became a module in itself, this topic is a little moot. Closing it out.\n. Not a JS error, we literally have two modals with the same name and markup. One of them has an overlay, the other doesn't. So both get activated and then on-click, the only one of them turns off. On a secondary close, they both try to \"animate out\".\n. @gakimball seems like Windows has issues with it. Whenever I git clone it, it comes back with Docs only while my regular repo has docs and will pull all changes there.\n. Nvr mind Fixed.\nWe really need to avoid having this happen again because it essentially overwrites the history of docs each time.\n. Well, that's why there is vanilla Foundation that you can use purely for the styling. It's just about the same when it comes to markup and the way it looks. Durandal even mentions the integration.\nHowever, when Bower installing FA, you can still just compile the CSS and work with that. FA is supposed to be a full-package: CSS + JS, not one or the other even though it can be used that way too.\n. @stryju thanks for looking through it. ngAnimate is used in the foundation.dynamicRouting.animations in the form of an animation. And even then, I use ngAnimate-like logic within the animation. There are several reasons for that and if you can think of a way to avoid using it this way, I'm all ears:\n1. in the .ui-animation, we're using animation information that's contained in the scope via the DefaultController. The animation information is dynamic since it comes from the templates and is injected at runtime into the router as view information. Because of this, I had issues setting up an animation using regular classes. Instead, the ui-animation animation replicates the ng animate behavior. And unfortunately, using ng-class would trigger the wrong transition as the class would not be immediately rendered and thus cause a \"flash\". \n2. the reason for the animate service in FoundationApi is pretty much the same except that it's used within directives. The reason for that is two-fold. One is that we use an is-active class for non-animated toggling, this class is necessary and there seems to be no way to time the correct addition/removal of the class using ngAnimate and the second is that we activate the directives at various times in the runtime. Meaning that it's not a simple animation that shows up whenever the directive is rendered.\nDoes that make sense?\n. @stryju yeah, go ahead and setup a feature branch and I'd be more than happy to discuss it and find the right solution. There are some issues I see with $animate. It seems like all it does is add a class and nothing else. But I could be wrong. The documentation is a little fuzzy to me on that.\n. @stryju The cut off is there to prevent any animation misfires from keeping the element in place. IIRC, Angular sets this to 10000ms. I can go ahead and increase the timeout.\n. There was also another reason for custom animations and that was the addition of a class to absolutely position the transitioning views. \n. Hmm.. I'm not sure of the benefit here. While we'd save on JS, we'd end up having to write twice as much CSS just to accommodate this new style of animations. \nI do like how much JS it saves and offloads the animation logic back to Angular. Idk. I feel like I'm on the fence with this. It seems like the right solution for the obvious use-case (views, and we could make this work for the various directives as well) but we wouldn't be able to make this work for regular ng-enter/enter-active and ng-leave/leave-active use-cases.\nIdk, I'd like a third/fourth opinion on this. \n@jeaniec @gakimball what do you think of this?\nTo summarize:\n1. we'd replace all of my custom animation logic (that's almost just like Angular's animation logic) with Angular's built-in $animate service, this would offload our logic back to Angular.\n2. The change would require changing all of the MotionUI classes to work with .[animation]-add and .[animation]-add-active.\n3. We would either have to double up our CSS to work with .ng-enter and .ng-leave or drop those altogether. This would mean, built-in animation support for ng-if, ng-repeat, etc. would be dropped as well.\nThe change in JS is trivial to make (at least by the looks of it).\n. @stryju I'm not sure what you mean by those two bulletpoints. Can you elaborate? And what do you mean by \"hacky\" states transition? \nI understand your point, unfortunately Angular doesn't have an easy way of specifying custom enter/leave classes, otherwise we could emulate ng-enter and ng-leave just like in my original code. Without it, we'd have to double up our work in the CSS instead of JS. And since our JS does almost the same thing that Angular does (with WAY less code), we wouldn't lose much on that side. \n@gakimball suggested that we can just extend the selectors. If that works, I'll go ahead and test all this out. That could benefit all of us :)\n. @stryju a zf-view was part of my original solution but what we had then didn't work with it. Go for it and make sure to submit a PR so I can easily pull that in and test it out as well.\nI'll go ahead and use your example to test out the new SASS class-system that Geoff is working on and see if we can make THAT change without affecting much of anything else.\n. @gakimball will do!\n. @stryju go ahead and submit this as a PR so we can comment and discuss the code straight on there. \nOther than that and some code stylistic changes, this looks mighty impressive. If it works as you describe, I'd love to get this merged in. \n. sweet! Thanks!\n. @stryju it's always on the list. I totally agree. \n. If you look through the code, you'll notice that whenever I inject FoundationApi, I inject as foundationApi; however, to avoid confusion, I'll go ahead and merge your PR. It makes more sense that way in an example! :)\n. The zf-as-button directive has to be inside the zf-action-sheet directive. It's not a separate directive but rather a part of the zf-action-sheet directive. Hope that makes sense.\nHowever, you can use your zf-hard-toggle the way you're using it. In that case, the zf-as-button directive is superfluous..\n. It's because actionsheet is currently not \"closeable\". I'll go ahead and get that fixed up.\n. Good catch. I'm submitting a fix.\n. Fixed\n. @akiran good point!\n. @akiran good catch on this!\n. @stryju I'm liking this. Once we make the CSS changes, I'd like to get this launched for v1.1 and then start work on getting this working with the various directives.\n. oh, awesome\n. @stryju so I'm having some issues with this, same ones I had when I initially worked on the animations.\nHere are some things:\n1. the animations experience a flash when loading up. Meaning that the element shows up, disappears, and then animates in.\n2. the \"out\" animation sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. It looks like it stops working if the other view is not animating. It also simply cuts short for no reason.\nHowever, I do like the fact that we got rid of the whole-page animations that used to happen whenever you'd load up the page.\n. @stryju can you tell me what your testing setup was? I simply added animationIn: fadeIn and animationOut: fadeOut to a couple of the pages and switched between them, that was it.\n. You can go ahead and remove them. Try running in these on the docs and you'll see what I mean. I wonder why it works in your example and why it would fail on the Docs.\n. Damn, this is bizarre.\n. merge in our newest master and comment out the prefixer, that should solve your problem for the time being.\n. go to any of the page templates (like angular.html or motionui.html) and add the animations to the front matter. Open up the docs, and switch between those two pages. \nBtw, @stryju I'm wondering about using these animations on directives. I had this idea to do the following:\n1. use ng-if on all the directives instead of the is-active classes. This would ensure that elements can be animated if they have animation-enabled classes attached to those elements.\n2. add animation-in and animation-out classes to the directive. Since they only get triggered when ng-[leave/enter] is added, they won't wreck havoc. \nThis would make sure that the regular ngAnimate module would animate everything without our help. What do you think?\n. @stryju let's leave the component animation for later. We can convert those for the next version after 1.1. I'd like to get these view animations fully ready. They seem to be 99% there, except for the issues on Chrome on Windows.\n. I don't understand. So if the entire page is not animating, the view animation breaks? Or are there specific elements that mess up the view animation?\n. @stryju hmm. The animation does seem to stop working for the text element. I'm still having problems with the animations not working when switching to a non-animated view. \n@gakimball I had some success with the solutions we came up with for #283. \nI'm thinking that this change might not make it to the next version because of these issues.\n. In that case, we'll need to add the position-absolute class to the parent until the view that's entering is done entering. But that's a good point, I didn't think about that, thanks.\n. Right. So that's a good thing. I'd rather not deal with that. \n. @stryju I'm gonna go ahead and pull this locally and try to do some work on it. I'm not sure how I can work on this collaboratively since this is off your repo but I'll give it a shot.\nJust some notes and todos:\n- [ ] absolute positioning of parents\n- [ ] backface visibility in animation\n- [ ] testing on various browsers\n- [ ] move absolute positioning to utilities (this is my fault, I've no idea why i didn't move it)\n. That's what I'll do! :) I've no idea if I'll have to open up a PR for it on your project or what. This stuff is pretty confusing.\nI guess we'll deal with that as we go.\n. Good idea on that. There's somewhat of a rift between the element usage since we want to support both developers that don't know Angular well but want to use the more dynamic features like modals, notifications, etc. and developers that already know Angular want more power-user features.\nFeatures for the latter type of a user are definitely lacking because, as you said, pretty much all the components should have services that create them and don't require in-template directives. If I have time, I'll go ahead and prototype a modal service that we can also port to other components.\n. Modal factory is now available in the code under, you guessed it, ModalFactory\n. wohoo! :) :+1: \n. @akiran I'm working on a method to queue animations, that would allow us to send a message to toggle an element but it won't toggle until an animation is done. \n. If you pressed toggle mid-animation, the animation would finish before it toggles back out. I think that'd be desired behavior.\nThere's also something else I thought about, and that's running $scope.apply() BEFORE the animation is run. I wonder if that'd make a difference since it seems that the issue is that the wrong animation gets run and when it finishes, the wrong state gets applied.\nEDIT Makes no difference.\n. @akiran makes sense. I think that long-term, I'll have to implement angular's built-in animations. That's being done as part of #330. I think for v1.1, I'll go ahead and use the queue work-around.\n. Fixed with #341\n. #388 fixed this! :)\n. O.O I got the animation cancellation working. This should fix a bunch of issues.\n. @akiran can you test this out and see if this fixes the animation problems and works as you would expect? It works for me but I wanted to make sure before I merge it in! :)\n. As long as you use the Iconic directive, it should work as described. Are your icons showing up when they're not dynamically injected?\n. Hmm.. that's an interesting use case. I'll open up a PR for Iconic to allow dynamic injection.\n. Look out for another this weekend! Thank you! :)\n. Foundation 5 and Foundation for Apps have a difference codebase. If you check out the scss/helpers/_breakpoints.scss, you'll notice that on line 166 that we'll eventually have those breakpoints implemented.\n@gakimball can shed some light as to when (and if) that will happen.\n. The CLI actually pulls in a copy of the Foundation for Apps Template which has a bower file that gets installed. By default, it pulls in v1.0.0. You can change this to pull in specifically the latest version by copy/pasting the zip-file download link: https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/archive/master.zip <- note that this is not the preferred way of doing things and bower will NOT cache this file (whenever bower installs dependencies it saves them in case another project will need them or you need to reinstall).\nYou can go ahead and use this method. There were some file structure changes since the last version update so make sure to update your Gulpfile with what's in the v1.1 branch of FA Template repo: https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template/pull/15/files Also, if you're not using your own custom app.js, take a look at the one in that branch.\nHope this helps! Again, it's not the preferred way of doing things (we'll be coming out with a new version soon) but you can get up to speed that way.\n. I did a huge refactor last week that allows for FA to be used as a dependency to your own application. That would probably fix some of your issues.\nHowever, can you provide us with your controller definition and the error you're getting? There might be something else you're missing or that I may help you with. Also, are you using your own custom app.js that defines the entire application or are you using what's in bower_components?\n. Hmm. it worked for me.\nAre you sure it's being loaded after Foundation? And does everything else from Foundation work for you?\n. You shouldn't need to put it in app.js as long as your controllers file is loaded after Foundation and Angular (which seems to be the case). :/ Hmm.\nCan you by chance put this up on Plunkr or a git repo?\n. So I got it. The controller.js file doesn't get included anywhere nor does it get compiled down. Go to your Gulpfile line 43, and change client/assets/js/app.js to client/assets/js/*.js. I tested it and it fixed the problem.\nMake sure you reload your gulp process and don't forget to post back when it works! :)\n. Also, thank you for posting the repo up, debugging was much easier that way.\n. Just keep the *.js in there :)\n. @thylo I encountered a bunch of bugs with the notification not responding. I'll have to look into creating a more permanent solution. \nCan you give me an example of how you used this in a way that created the original error? Because I can't seem to recreate it at any point.\n. @thylo thanks. So, I'd like to propose two other possible solutions:\njs\nif(!scope.$$phase) $scope.$apply();\nor\njs\nscope.$apply(controller.addNotification(msg))\nCan you try either of these and see if they work for you? If they do, just change the code to work with one of these (I'd prefer the bottom solution) and I'll go ahead and merge it in.\nThanks for your help with solving this issue! :)\n. @maxcook I wasn't aware of any issues there. Can you open a new issue and describe the problem? \n. @akiran I don't understand. You're using the src attribute to be applied to data-src but in your example you're only using data-src.\nEither way, I think it'd make sense to have a dyn-src that you can send a variable to without having to use {{ }} inside an attribute (something I'm not a fan of). But to make sure we can cover as many developers as possible, I'd like to have both. \nCan you change the file to not delete the dyn-src but keep your fix as well?\n. I would NOT recommend running Gulp in a production environment. Gulp and even a Node process can crash without being restarted because of all kinds of different errors. Instead, if you want to run a Node process, use forever and build your own app.js to run a static server (because that's all you really need). There are some other configurations you'll need to figure out (such as if you'll run forever on port 80, or use Apache/Nginx to point to the forever process port).\nWhen you upload the files to your server, running Gulp once should setup all the production files (the /build folder).\nHowever, you can make your life much easier by running any kind of a basic static server such as with Apache or Nginx and just run everything static, pre-build the files locally and FTP it up. Or install Node and build files after deployment. \nThere's really not a need for anything outside of static file serving.\n. @LuminusDev not a bad idea. Would you mind writing out some docs on this process here? I think a lot of users would appreciate it. If you can't, I can go ahead and write it out. \n. That basically means that another Node processing is running or another application is using the port 8080. See if you have WAMP or similar running on your machine and turn it off. If not, check the Gulpfile JS and see if you can change the NodeJS port from 8080 to something else (3000 is a standard)\n. Hey guys, can you show me the entire controller or whatever that you used to run this? It's possible it wasn't injected properly. Also, does anything else run for you? Popups? etc?\nFoundationApi is a service part of the foundation.core module which is included in the foundation module. It includes a pub/sub system that ties all of the foundation components together. It has to be injected into something else to use it (like a controller or your own custom directive).\n@vincentmorneau \nAs far as the link you sent over, I didn't experience any of those issues when I went to it. Can you give me your OS and Chrome version? Thanks!\n. @vincentmorneau FoundationApi is not globally available. It's a service that has to be injected into an angular module to be used so it cannot be run globally the way you did in the console. This is part of AngularJS basics.\nCheck out, for instance, the modal component and its modal.js: https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/blob/master/js/angular/components/modal/modal.js\n``` js\n  angular.module('foundation.modal', ['foundation.core'])\n    .directive('zfModal', modalDirective);\nmodalDirective.$inject = ['FoundationApi'];\nfunction modalDirective(foundationApi) {\n   //directive code\n  }\n```\nThe modal module itself requires the foundation.core which includes our FoundationApi service. Then the FoundationApi is injected into our directive. This could be rewritten in a more familiar form as:\njs\nangular.module('foundation.modal', ['foundation.core'])\n  .directive('zfModal', ['FoundationApi', function(foundationApi) {\n     //directive code\n  }]);\nYou can create a new directive or trigger a modal opening (or whatever action) via a controller or another different programmatic way but it has to be through AngularJS conventions so that it gets injected and properly used.\n. @vincentmorneau have you had a chance to look over what I wrote and try it out?\n. @vincentmorneau yes, there is a way to launch a modal page and just about every other FA component programmatically.\nUnfortunately, it does require more thorough AngularJS knowledge especially of controllers. I wrote a beginner's guide to angular last year that can give you a quick crash-course to everything Angular. That may help you out.\nHere's a sample controller that may do what you're thinking of and once you grasp the basics of Angular, you'll have an easier time understanding what's going on and figuring out better ways of opening modals, etc. :\njs\nangular.module('application')\n   .controller('MyController', ['FoundationApi', function(FoundationApi) {\n     this.openModal = function() {\n      FoundationApi.publish('my-modal-id', 'show');\n    };\n}]);\nand with accompanying HTML:\nhtml\n<div ng-controller=\"MyController as myCtrl\">\n   <a href=\"#\" ng-click=\"myCtrl.openModal()\">open modal</a>\n</div>\nSince this is no longer an issue on a bug, I'll go ahead and close this out but feel free to comment on the issues with any further questions.\n. huh, didn't realize. Thanks!\n. @akiran I can take care of that part.\n. Hmm, I'll look into it further. Thanks for researching this issue.\n. Can anyone test if this issue is still there? I'm 99% sure I already applied a fix. \n. Not a bad idea. How would you want to structure it? As a separate service maybe? foundation.interchange.service that'd be required by foundation.interchange by default but could be used separately?\nI don't think I'd want to bundle it into FoundationApi (that one has quickly become a bloated service).\n. If you can put together a PR, that'd be fantastic. We can further discuss it there and refine it. \n. @nathanmarks yep! There are several reasons:\n1. This is how it works in Foundation, and the original implementation was a bitch to port over.\n2. I had just found out about this feature\n3. By the time I ported it over, I found out about the listeners portion\n4. I told myself, \"I'll definitely rewrite it and use these fancy listeners!\" but forgot.\n:) In short, yeah, this is definitely on a list somewhere and thank you for mentioning it!\nedit: There was also the the problem of picking only the last available selector in the list so that if you write down:\n<div media=\"default\"></div>\n<div media=\"small\"></div>\n<div media=\"large\"></div>\nThe last matching one on the list would show. Because of the mobile-first approach, all 3 of those would match a full-sized window but only large should show; however, the re-evaluation of what I called \"scenarios\" in the code, could be done every time matchMedia fires one of the listeners.\n. I'd love to see your code! I'm about to merge some refactors in, nothing major but it separates the Media query stuff into its own service (literally just cut/paste code from interchange into a service).\nIf you already have a working mechanism, it'd be awesome if you could submit a PR. We can either merge that in, or I can take that over.\n. @nathanmarks Awesome! :) I just merged it in so you're welcome to go off master. \n. Current issue:\n- [x] scrollbar appears on animation change. I tried to do overflow hidden, I'm probably screwing something up.\n. Seems like I worked out the issue. @stryju can you test this out and let me know how it works for you? I'll go ahead and start on a refactor when everything's up and running correctly.\nI also have some reservations about the code style so I'll update that to fit the rest of the codebase without touching the experimental code. \n. Alright, so I found no way to store reliably if a height was preset or not, nor setting an initiator due to some scoping or variable issues. I decided to go against it and am thinking that we can just merge this in as is and deal with the height issue at some later point.\nI considered having a specific ui-view-container directive which would store height and temporarily change it upon request. Not sure if that's too much.\n@gakimball what do you think about getting this merged in? The only remaining issue is that if the ui-view parent has a style=\"height: whateverpx;\", the height would get erased.\n. @gakimball the ui-view will be positioned absolutely which means that any elements after them will jump up. This is why we can set a height to the parent in order to prevent the jump. This height is set via style=\"height: Whateverpx; and then unset (just as the absolute positioning is unset). \nThe problem is with people who may set a height on the parent via the style attribute because it'll get overriden by the animating ui-views. Does that make sense?\n. Ah, hell, This is by far the most frustrating PR I've worked on. Current status: does not animate correctly -.-\n. I ended up in a dead-end. For some reason, certain animations work perfectly while others don't. For instance, I applied a fadeIn and fadeOut to Angular and Angular-modules pages to test them out.\nThey work 100% correctly one way but the other way they fail. Which is bizarre since they both have the same animation applied to them. Then there are issues with several views (during my test), simply not animating despite following the proper animation procedure which makes me think that this might be a browser thing? But I'm not sure.\nEverything is as close to being done as possibly except for these few kinks.\nEDIT I'm thinking that this might be a better alternative to what we have anyways but idk.\n. Currently there is no way to do this; however, the dynamic routing in FA is meant to be used in the most basic sense and for rapid prototyping. More advanced features should be left to a more conventional routing built out the angular way.\n. UI Router does support it; however, we have not exposed that functionality in the dynamic routing scheme so you can't do something like this:\nyaml\nname: mypage\nurl: /home\ncontroller: MyPageController\nresolve: function() { var some; code() };\n. You don't have to deal with the core at all, just disable the dynamicRouting function and use your own router declaration. \n. Hmm, I'm not sure if I'm understanding correctly. Are you talking about building out a separate service per module that could activate/deactivate them instead of a service that can activate any module?\nI'm also working on a factory for modals that would allow us to create modals programmatically (rather than with separate markup) and that one will have an activate/deactivate member built in; however, it will have the ability to be activated/deactivated via FoundationApi as well. Is that more along the lines of what you're thinking?\n. Hmm.. I'm not sure if I agree with creating a separate service for each module. I kind of like the idea of having a central adapter that activates/deactivates components and then the components themselves handle how that happens. \nThis is so that the existing implementation of components and their activation stays intact and still available to new users. It also follows the way the components talk to each other behind the scenes.\nHowever, I think that once I'm done with the prototype ModalFactory, you'll see something more angular-like behavior with the factory creating the component directives and controlling its activation state.\n. Hmm. Alright. That's a fair point. I'll prototype something out and see how it looks.\n. Perfect!\n. That's already part of the directive! You can call scope.hide, scope.show, and scope.toggle.\n@circlingthesun what do you mean by results? Oh, and some code has already changed since this last commit. I'll definitely add the custom scope option.\n. @gakimball That's where I was headed with this next! =D Currently, the prototype already attaches but does not activate, no clue why. But I'm sure I'll get that resolved tomorrow.\n. Alright, so I ran into a big-time snag that would prevent the factory from firing off proper activate on the modal after its initialization if the code was synchronous. Basically, if we want to default fire the modal by a controller right after it's created, the modal won't even be ready at that point.\nI already asked about it on SO since there's not much documentation on it and no SO questions. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27869320/how-do-you-create-compile-a-directive-via-a-factory\n. Phew, got this resolved. For anyone wondering:\n$compile seems to run async and thus it's possible to run into severe race conditions. It's possible to preload scope for compile with initial data such as activation right from the start. This way, we can tell the modal to compile as an active element! The foundation.publish() function will initially publish to an empty subscriber (if the activate, deactivate, and toggle methods were run too early in the app cycle) but that's totally fine! :)\n. Improvements:\n- [x] pass data with scope rather than poorly formatted HTML string.\n- [x] create an init() function for the modal itself to run against itself at the end of a compilation.\n. @circlingthesun The code is pretty much done, can you suggest a way to add this additional functionality? I'm imagining using $q and deffer; however, if one was to not use then, I still need the activate function to fire.\n. There were some fixes that went out the door a few weeks back, and one specifically regarding this issue, are you on v1.0.2?\n. I'll be adding these to all the pertinent directives as I build factories for them.\n. It's been added to notification and modal. We'll add it as needed. I'll close this out.\n. @etcook I'm currently off the project. I'll go ahead and reopen this issue for someone to check up on this.\n. I've changed some things around. Can you do a pull and test it out?\n. Yay, age old bug fixed.\n. @circlingthesun this is the start of the adapter I was thinking about and I'll start porting it to the facades (I still want to have a central adapter). So the facade would look something like:\n``` js\n  FoundationModal.$inject = ['FoundationApi', 'ModalFactory'];\nfunction FoundationModal(foundationApi, ModalFactory) {\nvar service    = {};\n\nservice.activate = activate;\nservice.deactivate = deactivate;\nservice.newModal = newModal;\n\nreturn service;\n\nfunction activate(target) {\n  foundationApi.publish(target, 'show');\n}\n\nfunction deactivate(target) {\n  foundationApi.publish(target, 'hide');\n}\n\n//sugar for ModalFactory so that it doesn't have to be accessed directly\n   function newModal(config) {\n     return new ModalFactory(config); \n   }\n  }\n```\n. I'd like to keep them separate just in case. But cool. I'll go ahead and code all this up.\n. Hey guys, this is good to be merged in if anyone wants to go ahead and do it :)\n. So this is just a light refactor that was meant to make things a little cleaner. I started working on the #382 abstract matching service, mainly by taking some of the interchange logic out and throwing it into the FoundationMQ service (though, I'd like to find a better long-term solution for this!).\nAnimation is in its own module as well.\n. @naneer that feature is already available! :) The front matter works off basic YAML syntax so what you can do is: \nyaml\ndata:\n    requiresLogin: true\nThat should work.\nI made a video demonstrating some of these features, check it out (make sure to watch it far enough where I demonstrate that it works, I fumble a few times).\n. @soumak77 if I understand this correctly you're proposing the plugin:\n1. creates a module that sets up the routes\n2. appends the routing to an existing file rather than creating a new one that just holds the routes.\nIs that correct?\nOn the first point, I saw that you're using fs.appendFile for both non-module and module declaration. Does append file write a file if it doesn't exist?\nThe code looks sound. I'd suggest that the writeData function gets the appendingToFile option passed in order to avoid scoping problems.\n. @listepo 90% of the functionality in FA is very simple: add \"is-active\" to active an element, and use other classes to modify component behavior. You can easily rip out the styling from FA and wire it up with any other framework.\nAs far as routing goes, that's Angular specific; however, you could still use the front-end router (the Gulp plugin) to create an object and parse it for your favorite router as well.\nHowever, there are some forks that work with other frameworks in the resource section if you'd like to check that out.\n. @romainfrancez will this change prevent any bugs? If not, it looks like the check alone will require way more code than it's worth.\n. @tvuotila after a quick git blame, it looks like I'm responsible for that code. I believe everything works as it should, and if it does, let me offer a quick explanation as far JS goes:\nUsing || is a shorthand to create a fallback in variable declaration. For instance, check out this code:\n``` js\nvar myArr;\nvar newArr = myArr || [];\n```\nThis code will check if myArr is defined and not null. If it is undefined, it'll fallback to the [] value. \nUnfortunately for me, now that I'm looking at it, there's no way to actually set this value to false because this simply gets evaluated and will always end up as true. It's definitely bug-causing code which makes me wonder how come it seems to work. One possible explanation is that the Controller gets evaluated before the zf-accordion directive. This would mean that it's using strings to create defaults. So rather than:\njs\nscope.multiOpen = false || undefined || true; // which would default to true\nWe're evaluating what users pass in as a string:\njs\nscope.multiOpen = \"false\" || undefined || true; // which would evaluate to \"false\"\nSince all of the variables are just references to the scope object, our directive than converts that string into a boolean. The fickle thing is that one simply can't do a !!$scope.multiOpen because in that case, the string \"false\" would equal to \"true\".\nPerhaps a good solution would be a helper function in this module that converts strings to booleans:\n``` js\nfunction booleanize(val) {\n  if(typeof val === 'string') {\n     return val.toLowerCase() === 'true';\n  }\nreturn !!val; //default boolean coercion\n}\n```\nAnd then replace some of the logic in the controller. This brings up another issue though, we want to make sure that if a value is actually set and no undefined, we want to use that value. So perhaps, the best way to approach this would be:\n``` js\nvar collapsible = controller.collapsible = $scope.collapsible = booleanize(pickDefined([$scope.multiOpen, $scope.collapsible], true));\nfunction pickDefined(valueList, default) {\n  for(val in valueList) {\n   if(typeof val !== 'undefined') {\n     return val; //break loop, exits out of function\n   }\n  }\nreturn default;\n}\n```\nI hope that whoever works on this PR can use some of this code and can follow my logic!\n. The EADDRINUSE is an error telling you that something is sitting on your port 8080. It looks like you might be on OSX so I quickly looked up how to determine what's running on port 8080:\nsudo lsof -i :8080\nIf it says node, you can go into your activity manager and kill it and try again.\n. @mattgrande I had no idea about geoff leaving. I was a contractor so it was kind of understood that I'd work on this only for a short amount of time.\n. The SASS part can be used without Angular; however, the JS interactions are Angular based.\n. related to #812 \n. I wonder how this will go. I really enjoyed developing the original base Angular for the library. \n. @tolyo I still have rights to the project but I don't believe it'd be appropriate for me to contribute.\nI think an open-source fork would do it. Just do a fork, call it \"open-foundation-apps\" or base-apps, replace the prefix zf with of/ba and go for it. I'm not sure if foundation is trademarked but I doubt it. \nIf no one is interested in taking on that responsibility, I'd be happy to fork it under a new org name, publish the new packages to bower/npm, manage rights to the new repo and open it to you guys, etc. I just don't have time to actively contribute. \nIn fact, if I can get at least a few people to support  showand help me come with a name, we can do this ASAP that way the project can live on in true open source fashion. \nI have an org that I haven't used in forever called Lernaean and I can fork foundation-apps and the entire suite (the CLI, gulp plugin, etc.) there replacing the word foundation with base just to avoid confusion, give proper credit, and we can all get going from there. But I'm open to other suggestions (a new org name, naming conventions, etc.).\n@soumak77, @tolyo, @HoldenCreative, @tunecino , what do you guys think?\n. @soumak77 @tolyo I'd be more keen on starting a new org and giving a few key people org rights. If you fork it to a personal/work org, same thing can happen as it did in this repo: you stop using it and the repo gets stuck in a commercial organization. I think it's a better idea to have a new org that anyone, including the original creator, can give up rights to without minding it. \n@Gambero81 no one in this thread as far as I know.\n@HoldenCreative I agree we just need to agree where to fork it and under what name so that we can get started. \nAs the saying goes:\n\nThere are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things\n\nAs far as the organization name, here are some of my ideas (mainly bouncing off the idea of using \"base\" and \"open\"):\n- base-apps\n- open-modules\n- baseware\nAnd for the actual repo, we can do \"Angular for Apps\" though that seems a little redundant. If any of you guys can vote on these or come up with new names:\n1. base-apps/angular-apps\n2. open-modules/angular-apps\n3. baseware/angular-apps\n. @soumak77 I'd do a clean fork and start a community around it. I realize that you're using the new framework but honestly, I did a diff between your fork and the official repo and it's only 300 line addition / 150 line deletions which is pretty skimmable.\nWhat we can easily do is when we do the new fork, open a pull request from your repo, and start discussing the changes and if they work for the community. That way some/most/all of your changes can exist in the new official repo and your fork can just get the updates from the new official repo as it needs them. \nWhat do you think about the names?\n. Basically, guys, I'm thinking of an IO.js-style fork of this repo. All I want is a name and we can start the work on this. \n. my bad! :)\nI'm not a fan of tying it to just angular in case people with alternatives in other frameworks want to contribute and add. I guess I'm trying to think of having a long-term org that can house dead projects that the community still wants to support.\n. Alright, done. https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base\nI also opened an issue what needs to be done for initial release where we can discuss publishing this.\n. ",

    "davidkpiano": "If you do develop in Angular, would you just rip this stuff out when you went to production?\nI do develop in AngularJS and I can see the utility of using this in development, but yeah, I'd rip it out in production.\nSuggestion: why not group animations? If I do this:\n```\nanimation: fade\n```\nthen that would signify that I want a simple fade in/out animation for entrance/exit. It's unlikely that I'm going to do anything crazy like:\n```\nanimationIn: fadeIn\nanimationOut: slideOutLeft\n\n```\nbut I do appreciate the option to do that.\n. @gakimball @whodidthis brings up a valid concern. I know that AngularJS is the current hotness, but coupling components strongly to AngularJS directives makes them very inflexible for other framerworks, such as Ember, Knockout, etc., and even jQuery (not a framework, but still).\nIf the components uniformly reacted to change of state (and this can be an attribute or class, doesn't matter), it would make integration into other frameworks (or even vanilla JS) much, much simpler. Here's a semi-pseudocode example:\nhtml\n<div class=\"panel\">This panel won't slide out, yet.</div>\n<div class=\"panel active\">This panel will slide out, since its state is now active.</div>\n``` scss\n@mixin panel(... $active: '.active') {\n  // inactive transform state; e.g. transform: translateX(-300px);\n#{$active} {\n    // active transform state; e.g. transform: translateX(0);\n  }\n}\n```\nAnd then in JS, you can use any framework/library to simply activate the state of the component by adding a class/changing an attribute, and let the CSS take care of the rest.\n. In general, do you think the panel/block hybrid will be useful?\nSort of. The concept of a block responsively becoming a \"panel\" and vice-versa is very useful, and a great alternative to stacking. However, to me, the off-canvas component and panel are very similar, and having two separate components describe similar functionality and presentation (correct me if I'm wrong) seems redundant. A panel can be thought of as an off-canvas component that doesn't push its sibling, and relative to either the viewport or its parent.\nAre the extra classes required confusing?\nProbably confusing, probably a bit unnecessary, and a little too restrictive. A simple set of style rules inside .panel.block would be sufficient to \"cancel out\" block/panel styles for specified media queries. And now for the \"restrictive\" part...\nWould you ever want a block on a smaller screen and a panel on a larger screen?\nYes, and more (sorry for being greedy). Here are some scenarios:\n- I want a panel that's almost full width in mobile portrait mode, but only half width in landscape mode. (this is the standard, I believe, for Google Android apps)\n- I want a panel in desktop mode because, now that I have more real estate, I can do two important sections side-by-side, so the respective viewports for those sections might still be small.\n- Continuing the above, those two side-by-side important sections are stacked in mobile, so it's more appropriate to display the medium-panels as a block in mobile.\n- I want a panel in mobile portrait mode, but a side-by-side block in landscape mode.\nAnd I'm sure I can think of others. These scenarios hint that panels could be breakpoint-aware, just like grid blocks:\n- small-panel - 90% (or 11/12 or whatever) width panel for a small breakpoint\n- medium-panel - 50% width panel for a medium breakpoint\nAnd since specificity would be determined by the respective media queries, the panels would easily override .block styling.\n. Have you guys considered consolidating classes? Let's say you wanted a 6-column panel when small and a 4-column block when medium. That sounds like only two classes to me:\nhtml\n<div class=\"\n  panel-small-6\n  block-medium-4\n\"></div>\nTo not produce an extreme amount of raw CSS output in order to accomplish this, you can use what I call \"prefix selectors\" to define the base styles for the parent components:\n``` css\n[class^=\"panel-\"], [class*=\" panel-\"] {\n  // base panel styles go here\n}\n@media ... {\n  [class^=\"panel-small-\"], [class*=\" panel-small-\"] {\n    // media query specific panel styles go here\n  }\n.panel-small-6 { ... }\n  .panel-small-7 { ... }\n}\n```\nI've had no specificity issues when doing this in personal projects. Let me know what you think!\n. @zurbrandon You're right, as the panels don't necessarily interact with the grid, maybe having their sizes grid-based is a bit excessive. I like the idea of them being on a custom-sized basis (using SASS variables) with three (proposed) standard sizes:\n- $panel-length: 300px or whatever the default size is\n- $panel-full-length: 90% (or 11/12) of width/height by default\n- $panel-half-length: 50% of width/height by default\nSo you'll have that standard size unless the user specifies if it should be a full- or half-length panel. So here would be an example mixin:\n``` scss\n@mixin panel(\n    $length: $panel-length,\n    $position: left,\n    $active-selector: '.is-active',\n    $breakpoint: all\n) {\n    @include breakpoint($breakpoint) { // or any media-query mixin\n        position: absolute;\n    @if $position == left or $position == right {\n        width: $length;\n    @else if $position == top or $position == bottom {\n        height: $length;\n    }\n\n    @if $position == left {\n        top: 0;\n        left: 0;\n        transform: translateX(-100%);\n    } // etc. for right, top, bottom\n\n    &#{$active-selector} {\n        transform: translate(0, 0);\n    }\n}\n\n}\n```\n. Just clone the repo, follow the instructions in the readme, and you'll be able to view it locally on your own machine.\n. You did everything fine. Those parts just weren't implemented into that page yet (correct me if I'm wrong).\n. Check that you have the latest version of Sass installed.\n. Ah, gotcha. I was thinking something like this:\n``` scss\n$active-selector: '.ng-enter' !default;\n$inactive-selector: '.ng-leave' !default;\n@keyframes fadeIn {\n    from { opacity: 0; }\n    to { opacity: 1; }\n}\n@keyframes fadeOut {\n    from { opacity: 1; }\n    to { opacity: 0; }\n}\n.fadeInOut { // or .fade, .animate-fade, etc.\n  // animation properties...\n&#{$active-selector} {\n    animation-name: fadeIn;\n  }\n&#{$inactive-selector} {\n    animation-name: fadeOut;\n  }\n}\n``\n. If I'm not mistaken you can just use LibSass (gulp node-sass`), which doesn't require Ruby. Besides that, there are many advantages over LESS that Sass has, especially for building out frameworks like this.\n. You might need to update your SSL certificates.\nhttp://railsapps.github.io/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html\n. Not in this case, @ilanbiala . Whereas ngCloak hides a DOM node until the application is loaded, the need here is for a DOM node to be hidden until a template is loaded asynchronously.\n. Should 3% be hardcoded, or referenced via a variable, something like $accordion-title-background-active-scale: 3% !default;?\n. Seems impossible to fix, as long as overflow-y: auto.\nAccording to the W3C Spec:\n\nThe computed values of \u2018overflow-x\u2019 and \u2018overflow-y\u2019 are the same as their specified values, except that some combinations with \u2018visible\u2019 are not possible: if one is specified as \u2018visible\u2019 and the other is \u2018scroll\u2019 or \u2018auto\u2019, then \u2018visible\u2019 is set to \u2018auto\u2019.\n. EDIT: Should have read the thread first, haha.\n. If you do develop in Angular, would you just rip this stuff out when you went to production?\nI do develop in AngularJS and I can see the utility of using this in development, but yeah, I'd rip it out in production.\n\nSuggestion: why not group animations? If I do this:\n```\nanimation: fade\n```\nthen that would signify that I want a simple fade in/out animation for entrance/exit. It's unlikely that I'm going to do anything crazy like:\n```\nanimationIn: fadeIn\nanimationOut: slideOutLeft\n\n```\nbut I do appreciate the option to do that.\n. @gakimball @whodidthis brings up a valid concern. I know that AngularJS is the current hotness, but coupling components strongly to AngularJS directives makes them very inflexible for other framerworks, such as Ember, Knockout, etc., and even jQuery (not a framework, but still).\nIf the components uniformly reacted to change of state (and this can be an attribute or class, doesn't matter), it would make integration into other frameworks (or even vanilla JS) much, much simpler. Here's a semi-pseudocode example:\nhtml\n<div class=\"panel\">This panel won't slide out, yet.</div>\n<div class=\"panel active\">This panel will slide out, since its state is now active.</div>\n``` scss\n@mixin panel(... $active: '.active') {\n  // inactive transform state; e.g. transform: translateX(-300px);\n#{$active} {\n    // active transform state; e.g. transform: translateX(0);\n  }\n}\n```\nAnd then in JS, you can use any framework/library to simply activate the state of the component by adding a class/changing an attribute, and let the CSS take care of the rest.\n. In general, do you think the panel/block hybrid will be useful?\nSort of. The concept of a block responsively becoming a \"panel\" and vice-versa is very useful, and a great alternative to stacking. However, to me, the off-canvas component and panel are very similar, and having two separate components describe similar functionality and presentation (correct me if I'm wrong) seems redundant. A panel can be thought of as an off-canvas component that doesn't push its sibling, and relative to either the viewport or its parent.\nAre the extra classes required confusing?\nProbably confusing, probably a bit unnecessary, and a little too restrictive. A simple set of style rules inside .panel.block would be sufficient to \"cancel out\" block/panel styles for specified media queries. And now for the \"restrictive\" part...\nWould you ever want a block on a smaller screen and a panel on a larger screen?\nYes, and more (sorry for being greedy). Here are some scenarios:\n- I want a panel that's almost full width in mobile portrait mode, but only half width in landscape mode. (this is the standard, I believe, for Google Android apps)\n- I want a panel in desktop mode because, now that I have more real estate, I can do two important sections side-by-side, so the respective viewports for those sections might still be small.\n- Continuing the above, those two side-by-side important sections are stacked in mobile, so it's more appropriate to display the medium-panels as a block in mobile.\n- I want a panel in mobile portrait mode, but a side-by-side block in landscape mode.\nAnd I'm sure I can think of others.

I've updated the docs for now to reflect a more accurate version of how to use the directive as is, but I'll look into the issue of an outside anchor not triggering the action sheet to toggle.\n. For now, the way to do it would be to set your option variable as an object of $rootScope.\nYour controller would look something like this.

    "jwvanderbeck": "\"Would you ever want a block on a smaller screen and a panel on a larger screen?\"\nDefinitely want to be able to use panels on a large screen.  In fact the app i'm building right now is built around the concept of panels that slide in and out as needed, even on a large screen.\n. Ah I misread that as a two part question rather than one. \n. I have two basic use cases for Panels in my app.  I don't know if either of this is currently support, on a roadmap, or just plain will not be supported, but I think both of these cases are things that will commonly come up if you are targeting Web Applications.\nCase 1 - Panel Exclusive Visibility\nIt would be nice to be able to make it so that when a user opens a panel, that may cause other panels to close.  This can get into some pretty complex visibility rules, but here is a basic one that I am looking at.  Given an example page of a center main content, and panels on the left and right.  On large and medium screens, the user can have both left and right panels open at the same time if they choose, but on small screens opening one side should auto close the other side to prevent panel overlap.\nCase 2 - Panel \"stops\" or, not always open or closed panels\nI need to be able to make panels that don't fully slide in or out, but rather have predefined stop points based on the panel itself.  When \"closed\" in my case, a panel should actually still have a small portion of itself exposed, say about 60 pixels, where there will be icons for quick actions the user can select without opening the panel.  Then if the user \"opens\" the panel, I want it to only open about 50%, exposing the common actions in that panel.  Then if the user chooses, they can open it all the way to get at even more features.  Even when fully open though it should not fully slide in for visual reasons.  Another panel I want only two states, open and close, but closed should only retract the panel about 50%.\nI can probably find a way to hack both these cases in Javascript, but it seems to me that they are both cases that would see use in a wide variety of web based applications so might be something to consider if not being considered already.\n. I figured i'd be hacking my own at this stage, but its great to hear you guys are considering this functionality.  I think as we shift more into the application state of mind, things like this will become more common place scenarios.\nI haven't looked at your code yet for open and closing the panels, but it should be almost as simple as being able to pass an argument to open/close t indicate a stop point which would then be translated into the amount of translation.\n. I hope you don't mind some feedback by a relatively newbie designer.  My strong suit is in programming, not web design.  That said I think you will find that people like me are a strong core of the new \"web app\" developer crowd.\nI am really excited by what Zurb is doing with this new Foundation for Apps.  I am building a new website that I want to give the user the same experience that they get on native device, and web apps is where it is at.  The ability to have independent blocks of content that can each individually scroll, move, etc, as need is vital.  \nI am not a fan of the classic 12 column layout.  I know really talented people can do some amazing things with it, but i'm not one of them.  To me it feels like only a small step of from the 90's where you would take a Photoshop image and slice it up into cells and plop it into a webpage with a table.\nScreen resolution has exploded recently, and we have websites that use 50% of the available screen size.  It looks silly.  I want to build web apps that can scale and become a fun, interactive experience that fills the browser window no matter how small or how large.  We've gotten so good at dealing with small screens, but it feels like large screens have fallen behind.  Look at the new iMac 5k display.  People are going to be viewing websites on that thing that look like a sliver in the middle of the screen.\nThis new flex based layout system really intrigues me and I can't wait to figure it all out so that I can make amazing apps with it.  I have a design that i'm prototyping right now that needs the ability to have panels of content that can move separately from everything else.  Sliding in and out as needed, and scrolling as needed to deal with expanding content.\nNow with all that high brow feedback out of the way, a few pieces of concrete feedback.\n- From your example above I find myself at a loss as to what the point of Group is.  It looks like you are just making an entire layout in blocks.\n- Blocks that scroll independently from other blocks.  You have talked about this before, but I can't seem to figure out how to do it.  \nI think the concept of modifiers like 'content' are good.  I personally think they are better than entirely new classes.  Though it is obviously a conceptual thing, but I find it makes more sense to me.  I have a block with or without content.  .block.content, or .block  - Maybe if there was a layout modifier, it would be a bit more symmetrical and clear (/block.content vs .block.layout), but that isn't a huge thing.\nAnyway, there is my 2 cents.  Now i'm off to keep beating on this to try and figure out how to make it do what I need :)\n. The scrolling is just something i'm doing wrong on my markup i'm sure.  The demos scroll properly.  I just need to sit down and see what markup i'm missing.\n. How does this system work for vertical spacing control? I'm currently finding it hard to control what would have been row heights between my blocks.\n. The manual sizing method should work fine for my current needs.  I'll look into that.  Thanks.\n. Actually let me follow up on this.  In looking at my markup, i'm finding I am having trouble understanding where a block is defining a horizontally oriented block and when it is defining a vertical oriented block.\nI guess i'm still having issues translating from rows & columns.\n.frame.vertical\n    .block.shrink\n        .block.content\n    .block.stretch\n        .block.content\nSo that is defining two blocks of content, stacked vertically on each other, filling the width of the browser window.  I'm not sure entirely why that is, but I know it is because that is what i'm seeing.\nNow I expand that:\n.frame.vertical\n    .block.shrink\n        .block.content\n    .block.stretch\n        .block.small-3\n            .block.content\n        .block.small-3\n            .block.content\n        .block.small-3\n            .block.content\nAnd suddenly I have 3 columns in the second of the rows.  But I don't understand why, and I don't understand the distinction that is specifying how a block is working.  So yeah i'm still having a lot of confusion with the generic block terminology here.\nBut if I go with the flow of that doing what it does, then to me the following markup should give me a stack of 2 blocks in the 3rd column, 2nd row.  But it doesn't appear to.\n.frame.vertical\n    .block.shrink\n        .block.content\n    .block.stretch\n        .block.small-3\n            .block.content\n        .block.small-3\n            .block.content\n        .block.small-3\n            .block.shrink\n                .block.content\n            .block.stretch\n                .block.content\nedit - Ok it looks like my problem was missing some content blocks.  That works now but I still am finding it difficult to grasp what is happening.\n. @gakimball thanks for that.  I'm starting to see it, but i'm still failing at getting what i'm after.  What I am trying to do is Panel on the left that is always a panel.  Center content.  Then on the right, two vertically stacked Panels that become blocks on large screens.\nNo matter what I do though I can't get those two panels on the right to sit on top of each other vertically.  This is the mockup i'm trying to reproduce:\n\nI can't for the life of me find a way to do the two panels on the right.  Here is my current test markup\n.frame.vertical\n    .block.content.shrink\n        h1 This is a Header\n    .block.stretch\n        .panel.panel-left#panel\n            p This is a panel\n        .block.content\n            p This is some content\n        .block\n            .panel.panel-right.large-block\n                p This is some more content\n                button(data-panel-toggle=\"panel\") Toggle Panel\n            .panel.panel-right.large-block\n                p Panel content\nNo matter what I try though, the two right panels always end up next to each other horizontally rather than stacked vertically.\n. @ilanbiala It is a planned rebuild of this site which is based on this upcoming video game\n@gakimball Any thoughts on getting vertically stacked panels like above?\nEDIT Ok yay! I got it working.  I was apparently only missing one tiny piece.  In my markup above, I just needed to make the block that my two panels were in, into a content block and boom it all works now.  And it is a thing of beauty.\n. Actually it looks like making that parent block a content block doesn't quite fix my issue.  It does allow the two panels to stack vertically like I want, but it also is constricting the panels to the space of that block, which means I really lose the benefit of them being panels because I can't slide them open properly.  They get cut off by the size of the parent.\nSo i'm still looking for a way to have two vertically stacked panels that operate like standard panels, open and close on top of the content underneath.\nMy Markup\nMy CSS\n. You guys are only using node-sass for your gulp compiles.  Are you looking to provide a full stack for the final release of Foundation for Apps? I always assumed you just had it all wrapped it for ease of testing and quick start.\nSeems to me in the end just leave the choice of sass compilation to the user.  Some prefer node-sass others prefer ruby-sass.  Sometimes one of the other is required based on the host.\nPersonally i'm not using any of your stack at all.  I'm using an Express server, my own Gulp configs, and node-sass.\n. Ah my bad.  I had pulled early in the day.  I didn't realize you were working that fast!\n. You shouldn't be needing to modify a gulp component as that doesn't even belong to Foundation.\nI am not seeing this error with a fresh pull as of this morning.  Very you are all up to date and do an npm install to be sure you have all up to date dependencies.\n. Well my point was that I didn't need to make that change, and everything runs fine for me using the latest Foundation pull.\nIf you look at that code in gulp-sass, addedLocalDirPath is only set to true after looking for the path in opts.includePaths so the error on line 95 should be impossible.  Obviously it isn't, since you are getting it, but the oddness makes me think you somehow have something out of whack which is why I suggested a clean pull of everything and an npm install to ensure everything is completely up to date.\n. Now that I say all that, I see that Zurb's own CI is getting the same error as you guys are, so that is very odd.  I am totally not having that problem :(\n. Ok the problem of not seeing the problem was apparently on my side.  I deleted my repo and re-pulled and now I am seeing the issue as well.\n. At a quick glance what I see is the call from gulp-sass to node-sass is causing the opts.includePaths to get wiped out.\nLooking at my own project which I setup a few days ago, and the current state of the repo, I am seeing that node-sass is a newer version now than it was before.\n. Looks like Zurb may need to punt this one up to gulp-sass & node-sass.\nAs far as I can tell with a cursory look, it appears that node-sass has changed the way it handles the options sent to it.  The way it used to work is it made a deep copy of the options and worked on its own copy.  Now it appears to use the options sent to it directly.  And gulp-sass uses internally a part of the options that nonde-sass doesn't, and that key is being lost.\nIdeally this should be fixed in gulp-sass as @blazuka mentioned\n. FYI there is an already an issue opened with gulp-sass for this.\n. It is pretty simple to separate them on your own.  That is how i'm using it.\nedit To clarify i'm not using Foundation's dynamic routing.  I just removed the connect server stuff in gulp and am using my own express server.\n. Heh wish I had noticed that.  It would have been a bit quicker :)\n. Ah then it wouldn't have mattered :)  Think i'll switch everything over to that now though.  Should be a bit cleaner and definitely easier to update.\n. bower install zurb/foundation-apps This repo doesn't seem to exist\n```\n$ bower install\nbower foundation#          not-cached git://github.com/zurb/bower-foundation-apps.git#\nbower foundation#             resolve git://github.com/zurb/bower-foundation-apps.git#\nbower foundation#*             ECMDERR Failed to execute \"git ls-remote --tags --heads git://github.com/zurb/bower-foundation-apps.git\", exit code of #128\nAdditional error details:\nfatal: remote error: \n  Repository not found.\n```\n. Ok I got it working now.  But there are some serious issues installing it as a part of your own stack.  Some pieces need to be pulled apart some more.  It is still making assumptions about the end stack.  Should those be reported somewhere or..?\n. First off, I haven't touched a line of Angular in over 6 months, so I'm a bit on the rusty side, but the main problem seems to stem from how the dependency of Foundation for Apps is exposed.  The install includes an app.js which defines an Angular application inside of the Foundation for Apps codebase which seems a bit odd to me.  Furthermore, if you use that but don't use your quick routing system, it will outright fail with a syntax error due to the expected routes variable not being present.\nI'm not sure the best way is to deliver a large service like Foundation, but typically services for Angular won't declare their own apps or have assumptions on things like routing.  Is it possible to simply expose all of Foundation as  standard service to be injected into the user's app?  \nThe flip side is maybe it is a matter of documentation.  Remove app.js, remove Foundation's own declaration of an App and document all those individual services so that the user knows what they can/should inject into their own app, as well as any other required initialization that needs to be called.\nThe underlying issue as I see it now is that a dependency of my project, Foundation for Apps, is essentially trying to make its own ng-app rather than exposing a module or service for my own app to inject.  \nLike I said I think it may just be a matter of going one step too far.  Instead of making that app, just document the services exposed so that the user knows what to inject.\nOr maybe Foundation is too complicated for all that -- i've never worked with an Angular service as large as this before.\nDoes my rambling make any sense?\n. @AntJanus It makes sense, but what you suggest means modifying the Foundation code that lives in your bower install, which is IMHO a bad thing.  I should never have to touch a line of code in there.\nWhich is why I suggested pulling the app.js out and documenting how to do it yourself for the user.  Which is pretty much what I ended up doing.  Rather than modifying the app.js in Foundation, I removed it from my Sass compile, and made my own version of it in my code.\nI guess the issue comes down to how to you satisfy both the Designer who wants to rapidly prototype something, and the Developer who is building a production ready website. IMHO the bower dependency should cater to the Developer, and you should provide a full stacked install separately or as a second bower install, for the Designer.\n. @AntJanus As I said, that is pretty much what I did.  Just ignored your app,js and made my own.  I think this route is fine as long as there is good documentation both on choosing which way to go, and informing the user of what they need to do in their own app module, as well as what is optional, and explaining it all.\n. Ok apparently in a completely non-intuitive manner, if I specify shrink on the last block, then it scoots over to where I want.\n. Woops.  Didn't mean to close this.  I've reworked my markup a bit, and I can get it working properly with a single right panel, but with two right panels it acts a bit weird.  If the overall browser width is wide enough that the two panels can fit side by side, then they will do that, rather than stack vertically like I want.  If I reduce the browser width enough, then they stack vertically exactly like I want.\nAs for fa-panel i'm a bit confused.  The slim docs you have in place now are just using a standard div.  I tried using an Angular directive, but the panel doesn't work properly when I do that.\n<fa-panel position=\"left\" class=\"no-scroll id=\"statspanel\">\nDoes not work for me(even if I do it the div way like you show, which isn't my preferred way of using directives - but regardless they are equal to Angular), but if I replace it with\n<div class=\"panel panel-left noscroll\" id=\"statspanel\">\nThen it works fine.\nedit Actually the fa-panel directive seems to work if instead of using position=\"left\" I simply add the panel-left class.\n. Actually just ignore everything i'm saying right now.  I'm getting totally inconsistent results from changes and tests i'm doing.  I'm going to close this for now until i'm more confident in my markup.\n. @AntJanus Case 2 & 3 both use the angular directive to describe the panel.  As for the button, I just tried fa-toggle and it does nothing. In all 3 cases.\n. Ah you know what.  I hadn't looked at the console in a while, been so focused on just my HTML.  It looks like an error is being thrown in Foundation.init() which would of course prevent everything from starting up properly.\nTypeError: head.has is not a function  angular-app.js:31289\nLet me finish the work I was doing to separate my project from F-Apps so that I can get completely up to date on the repo then check back.\n. Ok sorry about that.  I'm about 2 days behind on the F-Apps repo as it got a bit hard to update.  I'm pulling it out of my project now and putting it in as a simple bower dependency now that that option is available.  \nAssuming that fixes it I will close this.\n. Well I separated everything out, had a few issues installing foundation-apps standalone, but that isn't for this ticket.  Finally got it all setup properly, but panels still don't work.\nI then did a completely fresh pull of this repo, changed nothing but to fix the gulp-sass error, and ran it.  Panels aren't working in the demo either.  The demo is still trying to use the standard div way, but that isn't working in the demo.  I then changed the demo to use the angular directive and that isn't working either.\nSo at this stage all I can do is assume things are in a broken state and try it again later.\n. @AntJanus I was simply clicking on Panel on the left navbar which goes to localhost:8080/panel and that is where it was not working.\nI just tried /playground and yes that is working correctly, so let me look at that code and dig it apart.  Thanks.\n. I actually was trying those, but not getting much back.  No matter what I did I always ended up with a solid 100% bar, and always the same color.  Maybe i'm just using it wrong, since there is no documentation.\nAuto color changing is awesome.  My current site has a whole chunk of code for doing that, so be nice to have it automatic!\n. \"Would you ever want a block on a smaller screen and a panel on a larger screen?\"\nDefinitely want to be able to use panels on a large screen.  In fact the app i'm building right now is built around the concept of panels that slide in and out as needed, even on a large screen.\n. Ah I misread that as a two part question rather than one. \n. I have two basic use cases for Panels in my app.  I don't know if either of this is currently support, on a roadmap, or just plain will not be supported, but I think both of these cases are things that will commonly come up if you are targeting Web Applications.\nCase 1 - Panel Exclusive Visibility\nIt would be nice to be able to make it so that when a user opens a panel, that may cause other panels to close.  This can get into some pretty complex visibility rules, but here is a basic one that I am looking at.  Given an example page of a center main content, and panels on the left and right.  On large and medium screens, the user can have both left and right panels open at the same time if they choose, but on small screens opening one side should auto close the other side to prevent panel overlap.\nCase 2 - Panel \"stops\" or, not always open or closed panels\nI need to be able to make panels that don't fully slide in or out, but rather have predefined stop points based on the panel itself.  When \"closed\" in my case, a panel should actually still have a small portion of itself exposed, say about 60 pixels, where there will be icons for quick actions the user can select without opening the panel.  Then if the user \"opens\" the panel, I want it to only open about 50%, exposing the common actions in that panel.  Then if the user chooses, they can open it all the way to get at even more features.  Even when fully open though it should not fully slide in for visual reasons.  Another panel I want only two states, open and close, but closed should only retract the panel about 50%.\nI can probably find a way to hack both these cases in Javascript, but it seems to me that they are both cases that would see use in a wide variety of web based applications so might be something to consider if not being considered already.\n. I figured i'd be hacking my own at this stage, but its great to hear you guys are considering this functionality.  I think as we shift more into the application state of mind, things like this will become more common place scenarios.\nI haven't looked at your code yet for open and closing the panels, but it should be almost as simple as being able to pass an argument to open/close t indicate a stop point which would then be translated into the amount of translation.\n.

Should be a bit cleaner and definitely easier to update.\n. bower install zurb/foundation-apps This repo doesn't seem to exist\n```\n$ bower install\nbower foundation#          not-cached git://github.com/zurb/bower-foundation-apps.git#\nbower foundation#             resolve git://github.com/zurb/bower-foundation-apps.git#\nbower foundation#*             ECMDERR Failed to execute \"git ls-remote --tags --heads git://github.com/zurb/bower-foundation-apps.git\", exit code of #128\nAdditional error details:\nfatal: remote error: \n  Repository not found.\n```\n. Ok I got it working now.  But there are some serious issues installing it as a part of your own stack.  Some pieces need to be pulled apart some more.  It is still making assumptions about the end stack.  Should those be reported somewhere or..?\n. First off, I haven't touched a line of Angular in over 6 months, so I'm a bit on the rusty side, but the main problem seems to stem from how the dependency of Foundation for Apps is exposed.  The install includes an app.js which defines an Angular application inside of the Foundation for Apps codebase which seems a bit odd to me.  Furthermore, if you use that but don't use your quick routing system, it will outright fail with a syntax error due to the expected routes variable not being present.\nI'm not sure the best way is to deliver a large service like Foundation, but typically services for Angular won't declare their own apps or have assumptions on things like routing.  Is it possible to simply expose all of Foundation as  standard service to be injected into the user's app?  \nThe flip side is maybe it is a matter of documentation.  Remove app.js, remove Foundation's own declaration of an App and document all those individual services so that the user knows what they can/should inject into their own app, as well as any other required initialization that needs to be called.\nThe underlying issue as I see it now is that a dependency of my project, Foundation for Apps, is essentially trying to make its own ng-app rather than exposing a module or service for my own app to inject.  \nLike I said I think it may just be a matter of going one step too far.  Instead of making that app, just document the services exposed so that the user knows what to inject.\nOr maybe Foundation is too complicated for all that -- i've never worked with an Angular service as large as this before.\nDoes my rambling make any sense?\n. @AntJanus It makes sense, but what you suggest means modifying the Foundation code that lives in your bower install, which is IMHO a bad thing.  I should never have to touch a line of code in there.\nWhich is why I suggested pulling the app.js out and documenting how to do it yourself for the user.  Which is pretty much what I ended up doing.  Rather than modifying the app.js in Foundation, I removed it from my Sass compile, and made my own version of it in my code.\nI guess the issue comes down to how to you satisfy both the Designer who wants to rapidly prototype something, and the Developer who is building a production ready website. IMHO the bower dependency should cater to the Developer, and you should provide a full stacked install separately or as a second bower install, for the Designer.\n. @AntJanus As I said, that is pretty much what I did.  Just ignored your app,js and made my own.  I think this route is fine as long as there is good documentation both on choosing which way to go, and informing the user of what they need to do in their own app module, as well as what is optional, and explaining it all.\n. Ok apparently in a completely non-intuitive manner, if I specify shrink on the last block, then it scoots over to where I want.\n. Woops.  Didn't mean to close this.  I've reworked my markup a bit, and I can get it working properly with a single right panel, but with two right panels it acts a bit weird.  If the overall browser width is wide enough that the two panels can fit side by side, then they will do that, rather than stack vertically like I want.  If I reduce the browser width enough, then they stack vertically exactly like I want.\nAs for fa-panel i'm a bit confused.  The slim docs you have in place now are just using a standard div.  I tried using an Angular directive, but the panel doesn't work properly when I do that.\n<fa-panel position=\"left\" class=\"no-scroll id=\"statspanel\">\nDoes not work for me(even if I do it the div way like you show, which isn't my preferred way of using directives - but regardless they are equal to Angular), but if I replace it with\n<div class=\"panel panel-left noscroll\" id=\"statspanel\">\nThen it works fine.\nedit Actually the fa-panel directive seems to work if instead of using position=\"left\" I simply add the panel-left class.\n. Actually just ignore everything i'm saying right now.  I'm getting totally inconsistent results from changes and tests i'm doing.  I'm going to close this for now until i'm more confident in my markup.\n. @AntJanus Case 2 & 3 both use the angular directive to describe the panel.  As for the button, I just tried fa-toggle and it does nothing. In all 3 cases.\n. Ah you know what.  I hadn't looked at the console in a while, been so focused on just my HTML.  It looks like an error is being thrown in Foundation.init() which would of course prevent everything from starting up properly.\nTypeError: head.has is not a function  angular-app.js:31289\nLet me finish the work I was doing to separate my project from F-Apps so that I can get completely up to date on the repo then check back.\n. Ok sorry about that.  I'm about 2 days behind on the F-Apps repo as it got a bit hard to update.  I'm pulling it out of my project now and putting it in as a simple bower dependency now that that option is available.  \nAssuming that fixes it I will close this.\n. Well I separated everything out, had a few issues installing foundation-apps standalone, but that isn't for this ticket.  Finally got it all setup properly, but panels still don't work.\nI then did a completely fresh pull of this repo, changed nothing but to fix the gulp-sass error, and ran it.  Panels aren't working in the demo either.  The demo is still trying to use the standard div way, but that isn't working in the demo.  I then changed the demo to use the angular directive and that isn't working either.\nSo at this stage all I can do is assume things are in a broken state and try it again later.\n. @AntJanus I was simply clicking on Panel on the left navbar which goes to localhost:8080/panel and that is where it was not working.\nI just tried /playground and yes that is working correctly, so let me look at that code and dig it apart.  Thanks.\n. I actually was trying those, but not getting much back.  No matter what I did I always ended up with a solid 100% bar, and always the same color.  Maybe i'm just using it wrong, since there is no documentation.\nAuto color changing is awesome.  My current site has a whole chunk of code for doing that, so be nice to have it automatic!\n. ",

On iOS and WP you can be sure that most users (those that buy stuff at least) will use latest OS. On Android you are already fine with 4.4.

Gulp and even a Node process can crash without being restarted because of all kinds of different errors. Instead, if you want to run a Node process, use forever and build your own app.js to run a static server (because that's all you really need). There are some other configurations you'll need to figure out (such as if you'll run forever on port 80, or use Apache/Nginx to point to the forever process port).\nWhen you upload the files to your server, running Gulp once should setup all the production files (the /build folder).\nHowever, you can make your life much easier by running any kind of a basic static server such as with Apache or Nginx and just run everything static, pre-build the files locally and FTP it up. Or install Node and build files after deployment.\nThere's really not a need for anything outside of static file serving.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I was getting a similar error when doing this, a friend of mine tested it using a capital F (FoundationApi) and it worked fine. I could be crazy and coming up with stuff, but it worked for me! I would give it a shot.\n. Here is my code I used to call it, see if maybe this helps at all.\n\nJS\nFoundationApi.publish('login-fail', {\n                        title: 'Login Failed!',\n                        content: user.msg,\n                        color: 'alert'\n                    });\nHTML\n<zf-notification-set id=\"login-fail\"></zf-notification-set>\nIt works for me, do you have foundation declared in your app.js? Should look something like this, from 1.0.2 at least.\n```\n(function () {\n    'use strict';\nangular.module('applicationName', [\n        'ui.router',\n        'ngAnimate',\n        'ngCookies',\n        'ngSanitize',\n\n        //foundation\n        'foundation',\n        'foundation.dynamicRouting',\n        'foundation.dynamicRouting.animations',\n\n        // Controllers for your app as well\n        'user.controllers'\n    ])\n    .config(config)\n    .run(run);\n\nconfig.$inject = ['$urlRouterProvider', '$locationProvider'];\n\nfunction config($urlProvider, $locationProvider) {\n    $urlProvider.otherwise('/');\n\n    $locationProvider.html5Mode({\n        enabled: true,\n        requireBase: false\n    });\n\n    $locationProvider.hashPrefix('!');\n}\n\nfunction run($rootScope, $cookieStore, $location) {\n    FastClick.attach(document.body);\n}\n\n})();\n```\nThere isn't much detail on what the proper use for these items are in the docs so I am making due with what was given to me and just reading through their code as well. I figured out most of this by breaking down how the Foundation for Apps JS works.\n. Its initiated due to the foundation.js with the app.js files. I didn't do anything to initialize them, I just saw they were included when you gulp all the files together. In the actual Foundation source I saw how they exampled and initialized the actual pieces of the API. I just kinda copied that and made it do what I wanted. Didn't modify anything besides what I already posted. It could be the way your gulp file is set up and you are compiling? I'm not sure, could be a few factors.\nBT DUBS!\nThe source file I'm talking about is in bower_components/foundation-apps/js/angular/notification/notification.js. You can see all the functions that Foundation for Apps uses. And as for the gulp file, I'll post the top part of that to show how I'm doing things for this.\nvar sassPaths = [\n    'client/assets/scss',\n    'bower_components/foundation-apps/scss'\n];\n// These files include Foundation for Apps and its dependencies\nvar foundationJS = [\n    'bower_components/fastclick/lib/fastclick.js',\n    'bower_components/viewport-units-buggyfill/viewport-units-buggyfill.js',\n    'bower_components/tether/tether.js',\n    'bower_components/hammerjs/hammer.js',\n    'bower_components/angular/angular.js',\n    'bower_components/angular-cookies/angular-cookies.js',\n    'bower_components/angular-animate/angular-animate.js',\n    'bower_components/angular-touch/angular-touch.js',\n    'bower_components/angular-sanitize/angular-sanitize.js',\n    'bower_components/angular-ui-grid/ui-grid.js',\n    'bower_components/angular-ui-select/dist/select.js',\n    'bower_components/ui-router/release/angular-ui-router.js',\n    'bower_components/foundation-apps/js/vendor/**/*.js',\n    'bower_components/foundation-apps/js/angular/**/*.js'\n    // 'bower_components/foundation-apps/js/angular/**/app.js',\n];\n// These files are for your app's JavaScript\nvar appJS = [\n    'client/assets/js/**/*.js'\n];\nIts the same as the initial one for Foundation for Apps, but different with the items and what I use. Such as I comment out their app.js so I can call my own.\n. Yea this is deeper than your side, I'm pretty sure it just has to do with the movement of files to the build folder when being pushed to production. I came across this problem a while back when I first used it but fixed it by editing the gulpfile to include those assets properly. But this should be marked as a bug.\n.

Having issues with other controllers still, but overall I can reference foundation easily and it seems to work for the most part.\n. There really are no best practices with the notifications system. I can't seem to figure it out myself.\nHere is what I'm trying.\n\nHTML\n<zf-notification-set id=\"main-notifications\"></zf-notification-set>\nJS (after login)\nif (res.data.status == ERROR.USER_PASS_INVALID) {\n                        foundationApi.publish('main-notifications', {\n                            title: ERROR.USER_PASS_INVALID_TEXT,\n                            content: 'Please try again'\n                        });\n}\n. So pretty much you can avoid using gulp all together and just transfer the build folder to whatever production server there is? \nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Dec 27, 2014, at 5:32 PM, Antonin Januska notifications@github.com wrote:\nI would NOT recommend running Gulp in a production environment. Gulp and even a Node process can crash without being restarted because of all kinds of different errors. Instead, if you want to run a Node process, use forever and build your own app.js to run a static server (because that's all you really need). There are some other configurations you'll need to figure out (such as if you'll run forever on port 80, or use Apache/Nginx to point to the forever process port).\nWhen you upload the files to your server, running Gulp once should setup all the production files (the /build folder).\nHowever, you can make your life much easier by running any kind of a basic static server such as with Apache or Nginx and just run everything static, pre-build the files locally and FTP it up. Or install Node and build files after deployment.\nThere's really not a need for anything outside of static file serving.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. I was getting a similar error when doing this, a friend of mine tested it using a capital F (FoundationApi) and it worked fine. I could be crazy and coming up with stuff, but it worked for me! I would give it a shot.\n. Here is my code I used to call it, see if maybe this helps at all.\n\nJS\nFoundationApi.publish('login-fail', {\n                        title: 'Login Failed!',\n                        content: user.msg,\n                        color: 'alert'\n                    });\nHTML\n<zf-notification-set id=\"login-fail\"></zf-notification-set>\nIt works for me, do you have foundation declared in your app.js? Should look something like this, from 1.0.2 at least.\n```\n(function () {\n    'use strict';\nangular.module('applicationName', [\n        'ui.router',\n        'ngAnimate',\n        'ngCookies',\n        'ngSanitize',\n\n        //foundation\n        'foundation',\n        'foundation.dynamicRouting',\n        'foundation.dynamicRouting.animations',\n\n        // Controllers for your app as well\n        'user.controllers'\n    ])\n    .config(config)\n    .run(run);\n\nconfig.$inject = ['$urlRouterProvider', '$locationProvider'];\n\nfunction config($urlProvider, $locationProvider) {\n    $urlProvider.otherwise('/');\n\n    $locationProvider.html5Mode({\n        enabled: true,\n        requireBase: false\n    });\n\n    $locationProvider.hashPrefix('!');\n}\n\nfunction run($rootScope, $cookieStore, $location) {\n    FastClick.attach(document.body);\n}\n\n})();\n```\nThere isn't much detail on what the proper use for these items are in the docs so I am making due with what was given to me and just reading through their code as well. I figured out most of this by breaking down how the Foundation for Apps JS works.\n. Its initiated due to the foundation.js with the app.js files. I didn't do anything to initialize them, I just saw they were included when you gulp all the files together. In the actual Foundation source I saw how they exampled and initialized the actual pieces of the API. I just kinda copied that and made it do what I wanted. Didn't modify anything besides what I already posted. It could be the way your gulp file is set up and you are compiling? I'm not sure, could be a few factors.\nBT DUBS!\nThe source file I'm talking about is in bower_components/foundation-apps/js/angular/notification/notification.js. You can see all the functions that Foundation for Apps uses. And as for the gulp file, I'll post the top part of that to show how I'm doing things for this.\nvar sassPaths = [\n    'client/assets/scss',\n    'bower_components/foundation-apps/scss'\n];\n// These files include Foundation for Apps and its dependencies\nvar foundationJS = [\n    'bower_components/fastclick/lib/fastclick.js',\n    'bower_components/viewport-units-buggyfill/viewport-units-buggyfill.js',\n    'bower_components/tether/tether.js',\n    'bower_components/hammerjs/hammer.js',\n    'bower_components/angular/angular.js',\n    'bower_components/angular-cookies/angular-cookies.js',\n    'bower_components/angular-animate/angular-animate.js',\n    'bower_components/angular-touch/angular-touch.js',\n    'bower_components/angular-sanitize/angular-sanitize.js',\n    'bower_components/angular-ui-grid/ui-grid.js',\n    'bower_components/angular-ui-select/dist/select.js',\n    'bower_components/ui-router/release/angular-ui-router.js',\n    'bower_components/foundation-apps/js/vendor/**/*.js',\n    'bower_components/foundation-apps/js/angular/**/*.js'\n    // 'bower_components/foundation-apps/js/angular/**/app.js',\n];\n// These files are for your app's JavaScript\nvar appJS = [\n    'client/assets/js/**/*.js'\n];\nIts the same as the initial one for Foundation for Apps, but different with the items and what I use. Such as I comment out their app.js so I can call my own.\n. Yea this is deeper than your side, I'm pretty sure it just has to do with the movement of files to the build folder when being pushed to production. I came across this problem a while back when I first used it but fixed it by editing the gulpfile to include those assets properly. But this should be marked as a bug.\n. Yea I'm on latest!\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Jan 8, 2015, at 8:59 PM, Antonin Januska notifications@github.com wrote:\nThere were some fixes that went out the door a few weeks back, and one specifically regarding this issue, are you on v1.0.2?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n. \n",

Foundation for Apps, Foundation for Sites, and ...?\n. @gakimball Oh ok, yeah I new about Ink and the rebranding to Foundation for Emails, but didn't realize there was a need for a CLI for that framework.  I thought it was just templates you copied and manually injected whatever content you needed into the provided areas.  I haven't used F4E yet (which may be clear by my last statement), though that is definitely something I want to get started with as my company emails need some much loving care.\n. @hshepherd @vincentmorneau Not sure if either of you have solved this already, but I encountered the same issue and resolved it by adding SCSS similar to what's shown below:\n``` scss\nmy-actionsheet .action-sheet {\ntransform: translateX(-70px) translateY(107px);\n&::before, &::after {\n    left: 10%;\n  }\n}\n```\nCouple things to note:\n1. Transform will only move the body of the action sheet.  The other styling will move the attached arrow.\n2. The exact numbers (-70px, 107px, 10%) were determine through trial and error, and based on personal preference\n3. This fix is very fragile and will likely need to be updated if ANY changes are made to the action sheet (e.g. adding more options) or if changes are made to the title bar.\nLive Example: https://parents.fiboart.com (click Art or Coding at top left)\n. +1\n. @gakimball I believe the same solution used for auto-closing of action sheets when clicked outside should also work for closing of off-canvas and panels.  Perhaps refactor the code into a reusable service to be used for any component?\n. @gakimball did you mean zfClose?  That could be used on the body with an element ID and if any click event reaches the body, it would be closed.  There are a couple problems with that approach: \n1. You cannot specify more than one element to close, thus you cannot close the off-canvas AND panels with this method.\n2. All click events that open/toggle a component must now trap the event or else it'll bubble up to the body and close the component.\n3. Any click event inside the component must be trapped or it'll cause the component to close (for same reason as 2).\n4. The body element is usually defined in an index.html, where as all other components are defined else where (i.e. in views).  Forcing a declaration on the body would cause a developer to have to know the id for every component used in their app, which becomes difficult once you start developing a large application.\nI prefer the approach used by the actionsheets wherein the developer does not need to set anything up for the auto-close functionality to work as it's just part of the component (solves 4).  It's basically doing the same thing as zfClose would be doing if added to the body, but works for multiple elements (solves 1).  The slight difference is that the actionsheet logic checks to see if the click was within the actionsheet, and if so, it doesn't close the actionsheet (solves 3).  This logic seems useful for off-canvas and panels as well.  It also checks to make sure that the click didn't originate from an element used to open or close the component (solves 2).  With some refactoring, the code used for actionsheets could also be used for off-canvas and panels.  Any opposition to taking this approach?\nThe only thing I could think of for why this approach may not work is if a developer didn't want the auto-close functionality for that component.  In this case an attribute could be added to the element which is read during the compile phase of the directive.  If the attribute is present, the auto-close functionality is disabled, otherwise it is enabled by default.\nI'll take a go at the PR since it should be fairly straightforward.\n. I was searching for zfClosable instead of zf-closable in the code base.  Let me see what can be done with zf-closable.\n. Ok, so I think FoundationApi.closeActiveElements() (the code that makes use of the zf-closable attributes) could be used to solve this issue.  At its most basic, one could expose FoundationApi in the scope and add the following to an element: ng-click=\"FoundationApi.closeActiveElements()\".  Adding that to the body element would solve this issue.  This approach will still cause the component to close if the click originated from inside the component.  To solve this, one could add ng-click=\"$event.stopPropagation()\" to their component.  I tested this with off-canvas and the off-canvas closes when clicked outside, but stays open when clicked inside.  I don't have any panels in my app to test this with, but I'm sure it would work just the same.\nI'm not a huge fan of this approach as it will not work for everyone.  From what I can tell, F4A is being designed so that it could be used by anyone, regardless of how little or how much they know about angular.  The solution above will require the FoundationApi to be exposed in the scope, which will require defining your own angular code (unless this can be done in the front matter, which I'm not sure it should be).  To solve this, a reference to the FoundationApi service could be added to the $rootScope on loading of foundation so that the following could be used ng-click=\"$root.$foundation.closeActiveElements()\" instead of ng-click=\"FoundationApi.closeActiveElements()\".  While most of the time adding something to the $rootScope is a bad design pattern, I think this will be ok as the foundation api is a core service that should be available everywhere.\n. After thinking about it, I still would prefer this feature to work out of the box with no additional code required, meaning the code to resolve this issue should reside inside the foundation code base, versus requiring additional angular directives to use this feature.  Perhaps foundation could add a default click handler to the body which always calls closeActiveElements.  The click handler could be smart and check where the click originated from and not close a component if the click was inside it.  If a developer doesn't want their component auto-closed when clicked outside, they could add an attribute zf-auto-close-ignore or something of the like, so that the component is not closed by the body click handler, but would still be closed by usage of the zf-hard-toggle directive (which internally calls closeActiveElements).\n. @Martinspire You can implement this feature my adding the following attribute to any element you want to have close the off canvas (in my example the off canvas has id app-menu).\nng-click=\"closeAppMenu()\"\nWhere closeAppMenu is the following function on the scope.  You might not need the $timeout anymore.  It was originally added before some of the $$phase bugs were fixed in the framework.\njs\n$scope.closeAppMenu = function() {\n  $timeout(function() {\n    FoundationApi.publish('app-menu', 'close');\n  });\n};\nNote that I did not add the click handler to the body as the body also contains the off canvas menu.  I added the click handler to the root element containing my views so that clicking inside the off canvas does not lose the menu.  In some cases where I need the menu to close when I click a link inside the off canvas, I've added the following element to the link:\nzf-toggle=\"app-menu\"\n. ZURB has basically dropped support for this framework and it is now being developed by the community here: https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\nFeel free to submit a PR to improve the documentation\n. I did forget to comment on one other thing.  There are changes made to the default app.js file which are to highlight the changes required if using HTML5 mode.  Those changes can be commented out or reverted.\n. I've come to realized that it may be best for the iconic directive to simply call $compile at all times after injecting the svg.  The reasoning is because $compile is required for the dynSrc attribute to operate properly.  Currently the dynSrc attribute is evaluated in the prelinking phase and sets the source.  If the interoplated dynSrc attribute were to change, the change is not propagated to the iconic directive and the icon is not updated.  In order for the icon to update after the source change, the directive needs to be recompiled using the original content prior to first compile.  I'm working on a solution now that I'll share once complete.\nIf the above change is made and $compile is already being called in the directive, then IMO $compile should be called after injecting the svg to make the solution complete.\n. I just added the changes required to make the iconic directive truly dynamic.  The directive is now recompiled when dynSrc is updated.  I've also added an additional attribute, dynIcon, which provides the same functionality as data-icon, but dynamically recompiles upon changes.\n. +1 for this feature.  I've found myself needing it a time or two.\n. @gakimball would you or someone on your team be able to look over this request to see if it's possible?  I just did some research and stumbled across this library: https://github.com/marcj/css-element-queries.  I think if that library were integrated into the foundation-apps framework, I could achieve my goal.  I haven't mastered sass yet, so I'm not sure if it'll work by just looking at the code, but I think if the code was updated to extend the breakpoint mixin (or create a separate but similar one), the css output could include [min-width=\"###px\"] or [max-width=\"###px\"] instead of the media query containing (min-width: ###px) or (max-width: ###px).  Then if you added a new class (e.g. responsive-block) to specify a \"new device\", css selectors could be constructed such that the following would cause the child elements of the responsive-block to only switch to medium-6, once the width of the responsive-block exceeded the medium threshold (e.g. 640px) versus when the device exceeded the medium threshold (e.g. 640px).\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-frame\">\n  <div class=\"grid-block\"></div>\n  <div class=\"grid-block responsive-block\">\n    <div class=\"grid-block small-12 medium-6\"></div>\n    <div class=\"grid-block small-12 medium-6\"></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n. @gakimball would you be opposed to including the library above? I wouldn't mind getting started on the integration to see if it would work. I'm starting to build out more of my company apps with foundation and having the ability to share responsive directives across apps will be key to fast paced development.\n. Here's an article I came across that better sums up my point: http://ianstormtaylor.com/media-queries-are-a-hack\nI'm not sure if there is an optimal element query library out there yet.  The one I proposed using is clearly marked \"proof of concept\", so might not be ready to include in any framework quite yet, though it might be something to base a similar solution of off.  After working on the zf-if-* directives and getting the media queries hooked up through a directive, I wonder if there is a similar way that element queries could be achieved.  It might be able to work if you just strip the min/max width from the media query and do a sizing check on the element attached to the directive.  I'll play around with it in the future and see what I come up with.  So long as it's in a directive, the code won't get run if you don't use it, so even a \"use sparingly\" notice in the docs could warn people if the directive doesn't perform well enough, though I don't think it should be an issue since we'd only do the sizing checks on the resize event.  How the responsive sizing behavior will cascades down to child elements is another story.\n. @gakimball I think it did it!  By making some modifications to the zf-if directives I added, you can now specify a zf-if-type attribute that, if set to \"element\", will perform the query on the element.  Here's an example of how it works:\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-frame wrap align-center\">\n   <div class=\"grid-block small-12\">\n      <span zf-if-small=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">SMALL</span>\n      <span zf-if-medium=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">MEDIUM</span>\n      <span zf-if-large=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">LARGE</span>\n      <span zf-if-small-only=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">SMALL ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-medium-only=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">MEDIUM ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-large-only=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">LARGE ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-not-small=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">NOT SMALL</span>\n      <span zf-if-not-medium=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">NOT ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-not-large=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">NOT ONLY</span>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"grid-block small-6\">\n      <span zf-if-small=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">SMALL</span>\n      <span zf-if-medium=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">MEDIUM</span>\n      <span zf-if-large=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">LARGE</span>\n      <span zf-if-small-only=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">SMALL ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-medium-only=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">MEDIUM ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-large-only=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">LARGE ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-not-small=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">NOT SMALL</span>\n      <span zf-if-not-medium=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">NOT ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-not-large=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">NOT ONLY</span>\n   </div>\n</div>\nWhen resizing your browser, the set of zf-if-* child elements under the grid-block.small-12 will perform element queries that result in the same outcome as running media queries since that element takes up the entire width of the screen.  The set of zf-if-* child elements under the grid-block.small-6 element will show different results as the queries are run against the element which is half the size of the device.\nng-hide/ng-show style directives are not needed for media queries since that is hooked up through CSS, however, ng-hide/ng-show style directives would be needed for element queries.  Using the template for the zf-if directives, one could easily create zf-hide/zf-show directives matching all the zf-if directives above.  I'd be happy to add those if my changes are accepted.\n. @gakimball Awesome, looking forward to hearing your thoughts on my implementation.  BTW I did some refactoring since that last post.  The attribute to define the query type is now zf-query-type.\n. Perhaps this is just my lack of knowledge speaking, but isn't this already achievable by the date and month HTML5 input types?\n. +1\nFound a breaking change in 1.0.3 (#477) that would have likely been caught with testing.\n. I currently have code in production that uses this functionality and would really like to consume the 1.0.3 changes, so I need this to be fixed or find an alternate solution.  I need to publish an update tonight, so I'm looking into a fix for this right now.  I'll post back to this thread with my findings.\n. Just found a hotfix.  Adding the action-sheet-container class to the element that toggles the actionsheet will allow it to work.  The one caveat is that I have two dropdowns in my titlebar, so if I click the second dropdown trigger while the first actionsheet is displayed, the second actionsheet is displayed as well without hiding the first actionsheet.  This happens regardless of whether I use zf-toggle or zf-hard-toggle.  I'll see if I can fix that, though regardless of what hotfix I come up with, a robust solution to this issue will still be needed.\n. Ok found the final hotfix I'll be using until this gets fixed.  In addition to adding the action-sheet-container class, I added a click handler to the dropdown trigger which closes all other dropdowns:\nfoundationApi.publish(dropdown, 'close');\nNow if you try to click the second dropdown while the first is open, it will close the first and vice versa.  The hotfix doesn't require any changes to the framework, so I'm happy with this for now.\n. @jeaniec please check whether this change conflicts with your changes made by 4b6a3fd70bca6f3c669f4205968ea7ea5e01b992 \n. @jeaniec That's not entirely true (at least as I understand the code, which isn't to say correctly) but as long as the solution you coded up works for dynamically adding of notifications (which at first glance it should) then I'm all good!\n. Good call on the support already existing for FA component selection.  One more thing to add to my backlog.\n. An exposed service property would be exactly what I need for my solution (see below).  Since I'm using ng-if, the element will be shown if angular is not supported as the ng-if attribute will have no effect and thus still show the element.  If angular is supported, the result of the expression will be used and since angular is supported, the expression will have access to the exposed service property.\nHere's the overlay solution I used (note that Modernizr was added to the scope for this to work):\nhtml\n<div class=\"browser-not-supported\" ng-if=\"!Modernizr.flexbox\">\n  <div class=\"error-message\">\n    <p>\n      We're sorry, but your browser does not support all required functionality needed to run our app.\n      Please update your browser by clicking <a href=\"http://www.browsehappy.com\">here</a> or \n      switch to a different device before continuing.

I get this error when I tried to define a state with the same name as the front matter:\nError: State 'home' is already defined\nI think you may be able to extend the states using the $stateProvider.decorator method.  In my case it's just easier for me to remove the front matter and manage the states myself when I need a more complex state, though the decorator may be a solution for @mannyhenri's use case.\n. Related: #477\n. @gakimball I would like to have a panel that is converted into a block still animate as shown in the code for #572.  Would a slight change to this fix be better for allowing that (i.e. make the disabling configurable) or should I stick with the approach I'm going with in #572?  \nThe annoying part of the approach I'm taking is that when the panel is a block, I must track the visibility of it using some variable and use ng-if/ng-show/ng-hide to animate it.  It would be nice to be able to simply call FoundationApi('panel-id', ...) and have the panel OR block animate in/out.  Otherwise I need to ensure I set the visibility variable to true BEFORE calling FoundationApi('panel-id', 'open') or else the panel will not display.  Similarly I must set the visibility to false AFTER the animation out plays on the panel or else the panel will not animate.  The fix for #572 could make this a bit easier, but I would still need to track the visibility of the block in my own code versus using the already existing code provided by the panel directive.\nThe one advantage of doing it the way I describe in the issue is that I could use different animations for the panel and block, however, I don't need that.  If someone did want that, a small addition to the panel directive could allow configuring different animations when the element is a panel or block.\n. @gakimball Could you explain the challenges with web apps just for my own understanding?\n. @gakimball Thanks for the breakdown.  I'm not quite sure you need that functionality to implement the swipe/reveal feature I have in mind, though if you do, perhaps you could help me understand.  What I have in mind is that you would swipe in one direction on an element, that element would then move in the direction swiped and stop after a specified distance.  The ability to swipe/reveal is an all or nothing action, so your top element either doesn't move or animates a specified distance and stops.  Under that element is another hidden element which is revealed.  It's basically an off-canvas for a single block.\n. BTW, the link provided in my original post was just to visually demonstrate what I was implying with my feature request and why the feature might be useful.  The link was not meant to provide details in terms of implementation, though I'm glad you provided clarity on the subject for my understanding.\n. I think this can be achieved fairly easily with just one more addition to F4A.  With v1.1 I can make it so that on the click of an element a menu option animates in from the right.  I just need the ability to make it so that on the swipe of the element in a specific direction, the same thing happens as if it were clicked.  I created 4 directives to achieve this: zf-swipe-left, zf-swipe-right, zf-swipe-up, zf-swipe-down.  Each directive takes an expression like ng-click and runs the expression when the element is swiped in the specified direction.\nHow do I create a PR for this without it combining with my existing PR?\n. @gakimball I'm doing everything on one branch (thus the reason 2e14f63c57e4541f30f62e65d4e0b6ecec68a8f0 was added to #539 instead of its own PR).  I'll move this code over to another branch and submit the PR when I find the time.  Thanks!\n. As alluded to above, are there plans to integrate animations with ng-show or ng-hide?  So far everything I want to use animations on requires using ng-if.\n. @gakimball I started using F4A when it first came out and couldn't get the ng-show or ng-hide animations to work out of the box like I did with ng-if.  The apps I build are used to run my business and being the only developer at my company, I haven't had much time to investigate alternate solutions. Animations are not critical to my apps since I just need them to work and not necessarily be flashy (though that is always a plus).  I'll let you know when I find the time to investigate this issue more in detail.\n@Joe-5mith Do you have any examples you can share that showcase ng-show animations not working?  If so, could you create another issue with those details?  I'd do this myself at some point, but I don't foresee being able to get around to it in the near future.\n. @gakimball In your testing of v1.1 and the rework done to animations, did you try using ng-show or ng-hide in any of your tests/examples?  I know this is a lot to ask, but it would be extremely helpful if there was a page in the docs that showed how to integrate the Motion UI into angular, with examples of ng-if, ng-show, ng-hide, ng-repeat, and others if there are more.  Perhaps just integrating some animations into the existing examples would help to clarify exactly how the Motion UI classes should be used with angular directives.\n. @gakimball Awesome!  Thanks for figuring that out!  Are you thinking that could get into v1.1 or is it too close to your desired deadline?\n. @gakimball If only they were all that easy!  Can't wait to get my hands on v1.1!\n. My original title was correct, this also doesn't work for hide-for-*.  I added the changes to my PR.\n. this will be addressed with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/25\n. I agree with @circlingthesun.  I recently switched all the internal messaging in my apps to use the angular pub/sub method as it greatly simplified sending messages and data from one part of the app to another.  One additional benefit of using the angular sub/pub, is that you can broadcast messages to your children elements only as well as emit from your child elements to the parent, which could be useful in some of the foundation components.\n. I think it is possible to come up with a solution for backward compatibility (e.g. turn foundation sub/pub into wrapper for $rootScope $on/$broadcast and internally switch to using only angular sub/pub), however, in agreement with your last statement, it's all throw away work if the framework is converted to angular 2 (which I'm all for!).  Unless there are limitations in the foundation sub/pub that must be fixed to develop certain features, I'm not sure converting to use the angular sub/pub system would be worth the cost.  Having used F4A for awhile now, I rarely use the foundation sub/pub in my JS code as the F4A directives take care of most cases where it's needed, so being required to continue to use the foundation sub/pub in those rare cases isn't a huge deal for me.\n. I got the following directives to work: zf-if-small, zf-if-medium, zf-if-large, zf-if-portrait, zf-if-landscape, zf-if-retina.  I designed it so that as long as there is a named query, a one line change can be made to add a new directive for that query.  I'll get it working with '-only' next.  Stay tuned...\n. zf-if-small-only, zf-if-medium-only, and zf-if-large-only directive have been added\n. zf-if-not-small, zf-if-not-medium, and zf-if-not-large directives have been added\n. idk if I did that PR correctly.  I only wanted to include commit 119b6b4939dc43bca01c09e598dbc5413c9c6d27\n. I used logic similar to that in the sass code for handling of the only case.  I get the next media size up and subtract a little from its min-width to get the max-width for the current named query.  Seems to work great, though it assumes at the moment that all queries will have em as their units.  \nThe robustness of the code needs to be built out as it should be able to handle any units and the logic should ideally match exactly with the sass code.  The logic for determining only should probably be moved to the media query service versus inside my directive as it'll be easier to maintain if it's with all the other media query code.\n. Here's how interchange works now:\n<zf-interchange>\n  <div media=\"small\">SHOWN ON SMALL ONLY</div>\n  <div media=\"medium\">SHOWN ON MEDIUM ONLY</div>\n  <div media=\"large\">SHOWN ON LARGE ONLY</div>\n</zf-interchange>\nHere's how you can achieve the same things with the new directives:\n<div zf-if-small-only=\"\">SHOWN ON SMALL ONLY</div>\n<div zf-if-medium-only=\"\">SHOWN ON MEDIUM ONLY</div>\n<div zf-if-large-only=\"\">SHOWN ON LARGE ONLY</div>\nHere is a complete list of the added directives which match the available visibility classes:\n<p zf-if-small=\"\">You are on a small or larger device.</p>\n<p zf-if-medium=\"\">You are on a medium or larger device.</p>\n<p zf-if-large=\"\">You are on a large or larger device.</p>\n<p zf-if-small-only=\"\">You are on a small device.</p>\n<p zf-if-medium-only=\"\">You are on a medium device.</p>\n<p zf-if-large-only=\"\">You are on a large device.</p>\n<p zf-if-landscape=\"\">You are in a landscape orientation.</p>\n<p zf-if-portrait=\"\">You are in a portrait orientation.</p>\n+1 Bonus\n<p zf-if-retina=\"\">You are on a retina device.</p>\n. More directives!\n<p zf-if-not-small=\"\">You are not on small device.</p>\n<p zf-if-not-medium=\"\">You are not on medium device.</p>\n<p zf-if-not-large=\"\">You are not on large device.</p>\n. I had to make some changes to how the zf-if-* directives were being compiled.  The existing method was causing exceptions to occur when using it on an element with other directives like ng-transclude.  The updated method will compile the zf-if-* directives into a zf-if directive with the appropriate configuration.  The solution was based on this stack overflow post: http://stackoverflow.com/a/19228302\n. I'm not exactly sure how to do this, but 2e14f63c57e4541f30f62e65d4e0b6ecec68a8f0 should be in its own PR.  Is there a way to create two separate PRs at the same time both being from the same branch?\n. I see that swipe close is already hooked up for all notifications.  Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to configure the animation, though it nicely defaults to fadeIn/fadeOut.\n. Yeah you should be able to hook it up the same way as ng-enter and ng-show.  I did that and it worked when I gave a fake class for the out animation in the SCSS, but I didn't take it future as some redesign is needed since you'll have to require another animation class.  As I mentioned in my example, I want to be able to use a different animation for move than in/out as the move animation is along a different axis than the in/out animation.\n. @DAmatheson nice catch!  I've submitted a PR for the fix.\n. One thing to point out here is that this solution does NOT provide a way to make the sizing classes (i.e. small-#, medium-vertical, large-horizontal, etc) work off element queries instead of media queries.  So if you use one of the added directives as an element query and the attached element contains a child grid-block with one of the sizing classes, the sizing of that block is based on the media and not the element.\nGetting the sizing classes to work off element queries is the key to getting a truly responsive framework.  I played around with it last night and found a way I can get it so that if you add a specific directive to an element (e.g. zf-responsive-block), it can update all child elements within it, so that each of those elements are configured to perform element queries.  The directive recursively travels down the DOM until all elements within the original zf-responsive-block have been configured.  The result of running the element query will cause a class to get added to the element (e.g. is-small, is-medium, is-large).  I now need to figure out how to get the breakpoint mixin to respect these classes so that the media query is not run if an element has one of those classes since the presence of those classes indicate an element query was already run and a media query is not required.\nThe above is going to take a lot of effort to get right, so I'll continue that effort in a separate PR (which will be posted once I have something worth sharing).\n. @gakimball Turns out it wasn't too difficult to get the sizing classes to work based off element queries instead of media queries (at least for the use cases I tried).  I included those changes in this PR so that they could be reviewed along with the interchange directives as both rely heavily on the media query service.  Both changes still need some cleaning up as they are hard coded to only work with small, medium, and large named classes, versus dynamically adjusting to whatever the developer chooses to use as their named breakpoints.  I think the code should also be refactored into different files as everything currently resides in the interchange js and html file.  I'm not sure of the desired workflow for such changes so I'll wait to hear back on your guidelines.\n. @gakimball I've been using the zf-if-* directives throughout my code in place of zf-interchange and really like how easy it is to specify exactly when to show something based off a media query.  It also removes the extra parent element (e.g. <div>) added by zf-interchange.  If there is any desire to pull in those changes without element query support, let me know and I can split up the PR.  I've noticed some issues with element queries while playing around with them (specifically that the element query is not rerun in some cases), so it would probably be better left for a 1.3 or 2.0 release since a lot of testing will be required to ensure it's fully working.  I have a future project in mind that would greatly benefit from element queries so I hope I can get that feature stabilized at some point so it can be included in F4A.\n. @gakimball I stabilized the element queries by including this library: https://github.com/sdecima/javascript-detect-element-resize\n. @gakimball thanks for the feedback.  I'll revert that code related to element queries from this PR.\nI like the idea of having a string passed in to specify the media queries for all the reasons you called out.  I'll make the necessary changes to the zf-if, zf-hide and zf-show directives.\n. Is this something that could get into the next release or does it need to wait until a major release?\n. @gakimball After making the updates to the directives and integrating them into my existing published app, I noticed an issue with the following markup I had that worked with my old implementation:\nhtml\n<div zf-if=\"not large\"/>\n<div zf-if=\"large\"/>\nThe large will display on large or larger screens and the not large will show if the device is not large.  \nThis works great so long as you're on a large or smaller device.  If you go into xlarge, both will end up being displayed.  What I really need is for the not large to display if the device is medium or smaller.  As you mentioned in one of your comments, the existing interchange mechanism supports this, however, I still would prefer to use the zf-if style, so to accommodate that use case, there needs to be a way to specify that I want something to show up if the device is _____ or smaller.\nDo you have any preference on the verbiage used to specify something is _____ or smaller?  Possible solutions for declaring something be shown for large or smaller could be: <= medium, less than or equal to medium, medium or smaller, < large, less than large, or something else.\nAs of now the following verbiage exists.  Placement of not and only do not matter (i.e. can be before or after named breakpoint):\nlarge: Show for large or larger (shown for large, xlarge, xxlarge)\nnot large: Show if not large (shown for small, medium, xlarge, xxlarge)\nlarge only: Show if large only (shown for large)\n. I added what I needed to the directives.  I used the \"or smaller\" verbiage, though that can be changed if desired.  I also moved all media query logic out of the directives and into the service for easier reusability.\n. First off, I switched to using F4A for all apps I develop at my company.  In order to make reusing modules across apps easy, I created a single module to store all common app logic and components.  Since I use F4A as the core of my apps, this single module is allowed to also contain front matter to pass through the dynamic routing F4A provides.  An example of this is my shared account module which houses all components for account management and is set up so that it uses the url /account/... for all the states in that module.  Some of the views in that module use front matter to define their states.\nI wrote a small shell script which is used to build any of my apps.  That script first builds the shared module then builds the desired app.  The way my build is set up, it requires running the dynamic routing against the shared module code first, then later against the app code.  I needed a way such that I could combine the output of the two runs, thus my proposed PR.\n. I'm wondering maybe a different approach could be used.  Currently a global variable is used to hold the routes and it is used in the config function of the foundation.dynamicRouting module js file.  I think it could be changed so that the module config call is removed from the js file and each run of the dynamic routing plugin produces the following snippet of code:\njs\nangular.module('foundation.dynamicRouting').config(['FoundationStateProvider',\n  function(FoundationStateProvider) {\n    FoundationStateProvider.registerDynamicRoutes(/* routes */);\n  }\n]);\nThis way regardless of how many times one needs to run the plugin, the code outputted is always the same.  It'll also remove the need for a global variable.\n. @AntJanus Yes fs.appendFile will write the file if it doesn't exist (see the docs).\nThe suggestion in my last comment was not to have the plugin create a module that sets up the routes as that module already exists with foundation.dynamicRouting.  The suggestion is to simply have the plugin output code that calls the config method on this existing module versus storing the routes in a global variable and using that variable in the config call in foundation.dynamicRouting.js.  This does not require appending to an existing file, though it would change the workflow and require the routes js file(s) be included AFTER the foundation js files, as the routes js file(s) would require the foundation.dynamicRouting module to exist.  The code as is in my PR does not require this workflow change since it still uses the global variable.\n. After reviewing the code again, I believe the append option I added to the plugin is misleading as the code is now using fs.appendFile instead of fs.writeFile.  This means that if I pass false for the append option (or don't specify it at all) and the file I provide exists, the file is still going to be appended, however, since the appended code will include the var statement, it will act the same as if the file was overridden, but have useless code at the top of it.  Is there any reason to believe someone would want to have an existing routes file overridden versus always appending to it if it exists?  The only thing I could think of is if they don't clear their build output directory and the routes files from a previous build still exists when running the next build.\n. @gakimball sure, I don't mind working on those plugin changes\n. Implements #513\n. @gakimball After playing around with this feature I feel there needs to be a way to configure the directives to allow changing of the threshold and velocity values passed to Hammer.  There are a couple of ways this can be achieved.  First off, default settings should be configured via a provider, not hard coded in the directive, to allow application wide overrides for the swipe directives.  Fine tuning specific uses of the swipe directives can be done via element attributes (zf-swipe-threshold and zf-swipe-velocity).  In both cases, I'm thinking there needs to be some abstraction so that users don't need to know the exact values to pass to Hammer.  For instance we could allow passing of values slow, normal, and fast for zf-swipe-velocity, which are converted to Hammer values under the hood (similar to how Motion UI abstracts the exact values used in the CSS animations).  Similarly to express distance, we could use short, normal, and far for zf-swipe-threshold.  Both the provider and attribute solutions should allow passing of numerical values that get directly passed to Hammer, in the event the named options don't fit a developer's needs.  The provider can also allow a developer to change the meaning of the string values or add their own.  This way I can change slow, normal and fast to fit the needs of my application as well as add super slow and super fast as additional options.\nI'll work on the updates above once an interface has been agreed upon.\n. @gakimball Sorry to be a pest, but any thoughts on this feature?  I'd like to finalize the PR so it can be in an upcoming release.\n. @gakimball I wasn't trying to get it into the next release, just something in the future like 1.2 or 1.3.  Do you or your team already have something in mind for this type of feature or can I take it further and implement the things I noted above?\n. @gakimball sounds good, thanks!\n. @gakimball any feedback on this?  I'll implement my ideas above for you and your team to review when you find the time\n. I know you guys are working on 1.1.1 right now so no rush, but when you find the time please provide some feedback on this PR so we can get it stabilized for 1.2.  The code is stable, but the exact values to use for named distances and named velocities need some work (if in fact that ends up being the way the swipe directives are configured).\n. @gakimball Won't this solution still have an issue if trying to use enter/leave/move all on the same element?\n. @gakimball Yes the concern is getting move, enter, and leave all to work on a single element with ng-repeat.  As an example, I want the following behavior to be achievable:\n1. slideInLeft, which will animate enter\n2. slideOutRight, which will animate leave\n3. slideMoveUp (or w/e you want to call it), which will animate move\n. @gakimball Hmm, I think slide and fade for sure.  Hinge might be a neat effect and possibly zoom.  Spin might work also, but would probably get annoying.  Is your worry the size of the CSS file?  If so, could you make the output of the classes be based on scss variables in the _settings.scss file?  This way you can only output what you need in your app.\n. +1 for the overlayClose change.\nThe code needs to be updated to allow passing false for that value.  The if statement should change from:\njs\nif(config[prop]) {\n  ...\n}\nto:\njs\nif(!angular.isUndefined(config[prop])) {\n  ...\n}\n. @foobarth Couldn't you just change the code you added to this:\njs\nelement.attr('overlay-close', config[prop] ? 'true' : 'false');\n. A similar change will be needed for #571 as it should not add the dialog class if the config value is false\n. @mkrakowski thanks for the tip!  Luckily I had control over the module I was using so I could change the state references to use data.authRequired instead. BTW, in order to get it working I had to use the following notation in my front matter:\n```\nname: app.search\nurl: /search\ncontroller: SearchCtrl\ndata: { authRequired: true }\n\n```\n. +1\n. @gakimball I would prefer to have the same grid size classes as it would make it easier to work with panel <--> block transforms\n. perhaps you could just provide a mixin for the ability to add grid size classes for panels and require those mixins to be used if you want the functionality?\n. I was going to write up another PR for a068352b59e8549152ca4bbeedce8be03e60fd51, however, a fix was required in this PR to get the changes working so I figured I would just combine them.  The latest change adds the ability to provide dynamic icon attributes.  Here's an example of its usage:\n``` js\n$scope.actions = [{\n  icon: 'account',\n  iconAttrs: {\n    state: 'login'\n  }\n},{\n  icon: 'account',\n  iconAttrs: {\n    state: 'logout'\n  }\n},{\n  icon: 'chevron',\n  iconAttrs: {\n    direction: 'right'\n  }\n},{\n  icon: 'chevron',\n  iconAttrs: {\n    direction: 'left'\n  }\n}];\n// this is just to showcase the dynamic icons working, though a more common case would\n// have some trigger which changes the icon (e.g. once you logout, switch icon to login)\nvar actionNum = 0;\n$scope.action = $scope.actions[0];\n$scope.updateAction = function() {\n  $timeout(function() {\n    actionNum++;\n    if (actionNum == $scope.actions.length) {\n      actionNum = 0;\n    }\n    $scope.action = $scope.actions[actionNum];\n    $scope.updateAction();\n  },3000);\n};\n$scope.updateAction();\n```\nNow you can use a dynamically updating icon in your view!\nhtml\n<img zf-iconic=\"\" dyn-icon=\"action.icon\" dyn-icon-attrs=\"action.iconAttrs\"></img>\nThis also works for static icons as shown below (though it would probably make more sense just use to use appropriate 'data-' classes specific to the icon in this case).\nhtml\n<img zf-iconic=\"\" icon=\"chevron\" icon-attrs=\"{ 'direction': 'left' }\"></img>\nIf you have a static icon, but still want to use the scope to store your icon info, you could also do this:\nhtml\n<img zf-iconic=\"\" icon=\"{{ action.icon }}\" icon-attrs=\"{{ action.iconAttrs }}\"></img>\nWhile dyn-icon and dyn-icon-attrs would work in the above case, if you know your icon will never change, the above method is preferred as using dyn-* will cause watchers to be set up, which are not needed if the icon never changes.\n. @gakimball Sure no problem, I'll knock that out right now!\n. Yeah I'm fine dropping the first example\n. @gakimball after thinking it over, I think there is an issue with #561 in that it would overwrite any existing classes on the element.  Perhaps switch the config['class'] prop from being a string to being an array of strings and add all classes provided versus just overwriting the class attribute.\n. @gakimball Sure no problem\n. Still familiarizing myself with git, but I think I did that correctly\n. Just noticed I messed up the merge for the switch statement, fixing now\n. Yeah, tested after merging and works greats.  Docs might need a little cleanup, but framework functionality is good.\n. Any update on this?\n. @gakimball I'm going to look into fixing this issue today, so if you could provide any feedback that would be helpful.\nThe whole reason I had to implement what is now the zf-advise feature was due to this issue. I use the zf-advise directive to track the active state of the panel and apply various CSS to the parent containers of the panel when it is open/opening/closing/closed.  I'm basically trying to achieve what the panel grid block should be giving me when it is working properly.\n. @gakimball Yes this is for a vertical grid.  The intended behavior is what I'm after, however, the grid system experiences this bug only when inside a modal.  Let me find a smaller example to showcase my issue.\n. @gakimball Here's a smaller example:\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-block vertical\">\n  <div class=\"grid-content shrink text-center\">\n    <h2>Modal Header</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"grid-block vertical\">\n    <div class=\"grid-block shrink\" ng-repeat=\"x in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]\">\n      <div class=\"grid-content\">\n        <p>Content {{ x }}</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"grid-content shrink text-center\">\n    <a class=\"button primary\">Next</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\nUsing the above modal template along with ModalFactory, the middle .grid-block.vertical element is not scrollable as expected.\n. @gakimball Using the exact markup you provided does not work as expected.  Have you tried doing this inside a modal?  All examples I've tried which have scrollable grid elements work as expected on a basic page, but not when inside a modal.\nI think I may have found the issue.  The two root elements for a modal are shown below:\nhtml\n<div class=\"modal-overlay\" ...>\n  <aside class=\"modal\" ...>\n  </aside>\n</div>\nThe modal class provides the flex styling as flex: 0 0 auto, however, the aside element is styled to be display: block.  Since the element is being displayed as a block, it is not respecting the flex styling.  If I add the following css, the scrolling behavior works as expected:\ncss\naside.modal {\n  display: flex;\n}\n. @gakimball do you think my proposed change to add display: flex to the modal class is acceptable?  I made the change locally in the framework and noticed the example modals in the docs were then being displayed as a horizontal grid.  I'm not sure if there is a non-breaking change that can be made to fix this issue, though if there is please let me know.\n. This hasn't been addressed yet. You'll have to apply the fix yourself with CSS.\n. @gakimball I believe the design of the library doesn't really matter so long as there is a standard API. Integrating the library into angular, react or anything else would be the same has having to integrate a JS library like hammer, iconic or any others that F4A uses. Not everything would need to be converted to pure JS. Some features like tabs don't really make sense to convert the JS code since most of it is framework dependent. The styling would be provided by the SCSS library and animations with the motion UI module.\n. @philippeluickx I recently had to do this with my own project when incorporating Prism.  My build is more complex than the one that ships with F4A, however, I took the relevant parts related to copying 3rd party CSS and pasted them below.  No guarantee the code works as is, but should give you enough info to do the same in your project.\nFirst I added a new variable to hold raw CSS files like so:\njs\nvar appCss = [\n    './bower_components/prism/themes/prism.css',\n    './bower_components/prism/plugins/line-numbers/prism-line-numbers.css',\n    './bower_components/prism/plugins/line-highlight/prism-line-highlight.css'\n];\nThen I used this new variable in a separate gulp task:\njs\ngulp.task('css', function() {\n  return gulp.src(appCss)\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/assets/css/'));\n});\nFinally I added the new task to be run as part of the existing build task:\njs\ngulp.task('build', function() {\n  runSequence('clean', 'jshint', ['copy', 'sass', 'css', 'uglify'], 'copy-templates', function() {\n    console.log(\"Successfully built.\");\n  })\n});\nThe above does not combine the 3rd party css into the app.css file generated by the sass task.  As such, you'll need to explicitly include the 3rd party css in your index.html file.  You could easily rewrite the gulp task that combines the app.css with your 3rd party css so you only need to have a single css file referenced in your index.html.  If you did do this, you would have to make sure to run the css task AFTER the sass task, which could easily be done by changing the location of the css task in the runSequence call like so:\njs\ngulp.task('build', function() {\n  runSequence('clean', 'jshint', ['copy', 'sass', 'uglify'], 'css', 'copy-templates', function() {\n    console.log(\"Successfully built.\");\n  })\n});\n. I'm having the same issue with the tabs directive.  A similar issue was observed with the zf-iconic directive (#569) and was resolved with change cce52b4aef7b49ac9d07ff60c85d700ce4fe6af8.  I'm seeing the same root cause in that the directives are not copied to the element, though I'm not sure if it's the same issue.  I think the problem revolves around the usage of transclude in the tabs.  I think a solution similar to the one I used for developing the interchange directives might be needed (https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/pull/549/files).  I'll play around with it for awhile and see what I can figure out.\n. The tabs are transclusion hell!  The attribute issue was part, but not the whole story.  The root problem is that all tab trancludes are done during the post link operation on the element.  The post link of an element occurs after all children elements have been post linked.  What this means is, any directives within a tab are being run before the raw content is transcluded into the tab causing angular to be unaware that a directive exists within the tab.\nAs I mentioned, transferring attributes is another issue with the tabs. This can be fixed similar to cce52b4aef7b49ac9d07ff60c85d700ce4fe6af8, however, it must be noted that if directives are used on the same element as the zf-tab directive, the zf-tab directive will need to be recompiled after copying the attributes.  If the directives are used in children of the zf-tab directive, no recompile will needed as children directives will be compiled after the zf-tab directive once the tab directives are fixed to transclude the correct data.\n. this issue with be addressed with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/24\n. My app uses the ModalFactory to create a modal on the fly when a new level is started.  The modal is opened and closed programmatically as you progress through the level and finally destroyed once the level is completed.  While developing the app I noticed cases when the modal was not being opened or closed when specified.  This fix solves those issues and I haven't experienced any issues since implementing this fix.\n. The answer you're looking for is the $stateParams service.  The link should give you all the info you need regarding how to use the params.\nIn your example, the id would be accessible via $stateParams.id.  I don't believe the front matter provides a way to access the state params in your scope without wiring it through a controller.  I've seen others speak of a DefaultController which can be extended to add custom behavior, however, if I ever need any specific behavior from my controller I write my own versus extending the DefaultController provided by F4A, so you'd have to get info on how to do that from someone else.\nIn short, here is the code you'll need:\nFront Matter:\n```\nname: inbox.message\nurl: inbox/:id\ncontroller: InboxController\n\n```\nController:\njs\nangular.module('application').controller('InboxController', \n  ['$scope', '$stateParams', function($scope, $stateParams) {\n    $scope.msgId = $stateParams.id;\n  }]\n);\nView:\nhtml\nYou're viewing message with id: {{ msgId }}\n. This was fixed with e70eff2d17a5de409e4a58d259c7c8a7e076ee7e.  It'll be in the next release.\n. Posted PR from wrong repo, will close and reopen\n. @imjoeco I noticed you closed this PR but do agree with using $timeout instead of setTimeout.  Should I make those changes in my PR?\n. @imjoeco I combined your changes into #640\n. I included the changes from this PR in #640 when #644 was closed without realizing @imjoeco was planning to open a new PR with the same changes.  I can revert d37786b1c8f39b173f5ef3ef89f3a1bff7b23d7d so that this PR can be merged or you can just accept both PRs as is though this PR has the same changes as d37786b1c8f39b173f5ef3ef89f3a1bff7b23d7d.  \n@gakimball Let me know how you want to handle it.\n. @Joe-5mith Have you tried using the ModalFactory (http://foundation.zurb.com/apps/docs/#!/angular-modules)?  If so, are there some feature you're looking for that it's missing?  I use it for all my dynamically generated modals and it seems to work great (some issues aside which are being tracked).\n. @Joe-5mith You can create an angular service to encapsulate the logic for generating a modal (an angular factory would work as well)\n``` javascript\nangular.module('mymodule').factory('ModalService', function (ModalFactory) {\n    return {\n      createModalXYZ: createModalXYZ\n    };\nfunction createModalXYZ() {\n      return new ModalFactory({\n          ...\n      });\n    }\n});\n```\nThere are some pending changes for modals that are waiting for the next release of the framework.  One such change was how to configure the classes for a modal pragmatically.  An example was added to the docs for how to use the ModalFactory (https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/blob/master/docs/templates/modal.html).  The class config property will be available in the next release.\n. Do you have a specific use case?  Not sure if this will help, but you can also attach functions to the modal scope via the contentScope property.  So if you need to do something with the click of a button, you can have the following:\njavascript\n$scope.foo = \"Bloop!\";\n$scope.bar = \"Blee!\";\nvar config = {\n    id: 'your optional id here',\n    templateUrl: 'path/to/template',\n    contentScope: {\n        foo: $scope.foo,\n        bar: $scope.bar,\n        clicked: function() {\n          // do something with foo and bar\n        }\n    },\n    animationIn: 'slideInFromTop'\n}\n$scope.modal = new ModalFactory(config);\nIn your template you can use ng-click=\"clicked()\" to trigger the scope method on the click of the button.\n. @zurbchris @valorekhov \nI'm going to add similar functionality to the zf-panel directive.  I'll add it to other directives that would benefit with this change including the zf-accordion-item.\n. I've implemented PR #740 to handle triggering active state messages for components that use the foundation sub/pub system to show/hide components.  Accordions and Tabs do not use the foundation sub/pub system to handle changing active state of elements.  In these cases, two-way binding of scope.active would have to be used to be notified of active state changes.  The two-way bound value should be readonly until support is added to the Accordion and Tabs to allow changing active state outside of the directive.\n. BTW in terms of #536, here is a case where using the angular pub/sub would help as it also allows passing data, so we could just fire one event in the promise.finally block and pass along the success/error info instead of having to fire specific events for success/error\n. I made the changes necessary for my app in my forked repo: 84fe2e23ece29aa5a90283961af3f609d7b5210a\nI realized that having a success/error for each action wasn't going to really help me do what I needed.  Instead what I was really after was knowing the active state of an element once the animation was complete on that element.  So I instead added two new messages active-true and active-false which are sent once the open/show animation is complete or the close/hide animation is complete, respectively.  Let me know if you want me to work on a PR for integration of these changes.\n. this will be addressed with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/25\n. Feel free to submit this PR against the new fork\n. Turns out there was just a bug in my code :/\n. For what it's worth, I've been using F4A with angular 1.4.x in production code for a few months now.  There were a couple problems I had to address in my own code due upgrading angular, but no issues were found in F4A.\n. @kuatsure I use nearly every part of the F4A framework.  It should also be noted that I run a custom build of the framework (https://github.com/fiboacademy/foundation-apps/tree/fibo-master).  Some of my fixes/features have made there way into the F4A master and some haven't.  The forked repo is set to angular 1.4.4, however, my build system is set to use angular 1.4.7 and I haven't noticed any issues.\n. @gakimball that would be best\n. I was able to reproduce this issue in my app using the same markup as in the docs <input type=\"range\"/>.  This issue is intermittent as it works sometimes in my app, but more often than not the slider gets stuck and requires refreshing the browser.\n. Appears to be due to another library I'm using not handling mouse events correctly\n. I should mention that if run with angular support enabled, the need for the global variable foundationRoutes is removed.  Backwards compatibility is also maintained as angular support is disabled by default.\n. Yes I can get to that at some point\nOn Fri, Dec 4, 2015 at 1:35 PM, Geoff Kimball notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@soumak77 https://github.com/soumak77 Thanks for putting this together\n:) Could you apply these features to the external Front Router plugin\nhttps://github.com/zurb/front-router as well? We won't be dropping the\nbuilt-in plugin until after 1.2, but new projects are referencing the\nexternal plugin.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/pull/704#issuecomment-162088077.\n. I should mention that the optimized css worked on Chrome and Safari for OS X 1.9.5, but did not work for Chrome and Safari for iOS 8.3\n. I started using foundation from the beginning and really love what they did.  I was in the early stages of my company when I decided to go with foundation for apps and now all my apps run on this framework.  It is unfortunate to see the lack of support at this time, however, I foresee being able to do some amazing things with this framework in the future.  Seeing as I am reliant on the framework to maintain my business, I created a fork where I make necessary updates to the framework to support my needs.  Most of these changes I'm hoping to get merged into foundation for apps once the project picks back up.  Some of which are pending PRs.\n\nWhile it may not be a viable option to use my forked repo in production, you can try it out by adding the following to your bower file:\n\"foundation-apps\": \"git@github.com:fiboacademy/foundation-apps#fibo-master\"\nThe fork should be a drop-in replacement with no additional configuration needed, though you will need to build from source.\n. I would love to see the following changes in 1.2.  I've been using all these changes in production code for the past 6+ months.  All changes to exposed APIs are backwards compatible:\n- PR #549 - Interchange Directives\n  - FoundationMQ service changes\n    - The changes I've made to the FoundationMQ service have proven to be quite useful so that I can perform media queries in code as shown below.  The methods use named queries so to allow user defined values.\n      - FoundationMQ.matchesMediaOnly(\"small\"); // checks if device is small only\n      - FoundationMQ.matchesMedia(\"medium\"); // checks if device is medium or higher\n  - Interchange Directives\n    - I absolutely love how these directives work.  It makes it so simple to tag an element with a specific media query.  It also removes the need for additional DOM elements as is required by the current interchange mechanism zf-interchange.\n- PR #730 - Animation Promises \n  - Changes allow chaining animations so they can be performed one after another.  The changes use the $q service to handle the promises.\n- PR #704 - Add angular support and multiple runs to dynamic routing gulp plugin\n  - Allows dynamic routing module to be run multiple times by appending to the routes file if it already exists.  File will be created if it doesn't already exist.\n  - Removes the dependency on the global variable foundationRoutes when angular support is enabled.  Uses the angular.module('foundation.dynamicRouting').config() method to add routes.\nThose have proven to be the most useful changes I've made to the framework.  While I think PR #551 (Swipe Directives) is a really promising feature, there is much work to do still to get it working flawlessly, so I wouldn't suggest merging the PR for 1.2. I don't currently use those directives in production code, though I will need to for a product I have to release by September, so by then I'll have all the kinks worked out.\n. @gakimball There aren't any critical bugs that I've seen that I haven't already fixed myself in the framework.  I think for the most part I've created PRs for things I've fixed in the framework along the way.  I'll go through the changes I've committed to my company's forked repo of F4A that we use in production and reply shortly with the changes that haven't made it into the F4A master yet.\n. These are the only two bug fixes I've made that aren't yet in the framework:\n- Check for null scope during SVG injection\n  - https://github.com/fiboacademy/foundation-apps/commit/2acffdc845e4f662c04fa2ad1a0e6f8290e66a4b\n- Check scope and element during modal destroy\n  - https://github.com/fiboacademy/foundation-apps/commit/d6273a97ef299b8600cbe4f5db237aec19620761\n  - there was a discussion as to whether or not these checks were needed when https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/pull/645 was merged and it was determined they were not, however, in practice, I've found they are needed\n. In terms of existing issues, it would be nice to see the following resolved:\n- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/430\n  - This is specific for off-canvas, though I've found it would be useful for panels as well.  I simply add the necessary click handlers to other elements in the app so clicking on them cause the panel/off-canvas to close, but it would be nice to see an integrated option so I don't have to worry about which exact elements need the click handlers.  I would like to be able to simply flag the off-canvas/panel component as needing to close when clicked outside.\n- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/484\n  - It would be nice to remove my dependency on Modernizr as I'm only using it for F4A support detection.\n- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/578\n  - This is easily solved by adding one line of css in my app, though a solution via a framework css class would be nice\n- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/672\n  - This one is just plain annoying\n- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/699\n  - I had to remove all range sliders in my app due to this issue.  Still can't figure out what exactly is happening.\n- #572 \n  - I ended up getting the functionality I needed, but my solution is a hack at best.\n. @zurbchris Please disregard my comments about that change.  The head of my repo has the same code for modal destroy as F4A master and I haven't experienced any issues.\n. I would like to see https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/572 resolved at some point as well.  I ended up getting the functionality I needed, but my solution is a hack at best.\n. This PR didn't get created correctly. I'll create a new branch with the isolated changes.\n. There is one key feature to this PR that I should explain and that is the FoundationApi.animateAndNotify method.  This method internally calls FoundationApi.animate, which has been updated in this PR to return a promise.  animateAndNotify waits on the promise to be completed and then fires off a notification via FoundationApi.publish stating whether the component was just activated or deactivated.  \nFoundationApi.animateAndNotify is not used in the foundation codebase as of this PR.  In my fork, I have replaced all usage of FoundationApi.animate in the panels component with FoundationApi.animateAndNotify.  This allows me to perform code immediately after the panel has closed or immediately after the panel has opened.\nSince FoundationApi.animateAndNotify is not used in this PR, it could be removed from the API, however, I would not only suggest keeping the method, but would suggest using it in place of FoundationApi.animate for various components (panels being one example).\n. addresses https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/674\n. @zurbchris do you plan on adding the anitmateAndNotify to any components so they can alert subscribers when the component has fully opened or fully closed? Perhaps an additional attribute can be added to the directive so these new messages only get sent when enabled.\n. Awesome!  Not sure what else you have planned for this feature, but feel free to change anything I've done to better suit the framework.\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. This has been resolved for ui-sref elements in PR https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/pull/736 with change https://github.com/fiboacademy/foundation-apps/commit/8922ec4215c5340bb5b3c8b64a904cb308b01d51.  I'll update the code to check if click originated within an element that has an href tag.\n. The specific code that needs to be updated is https://github.com/fiboacademy/foundation-apps/blob/8922ec4215c5340bb5b3c8b64a904cb308b01d51/js/angular/components/common/common.js#L208-L211\nRight now it doesn't call event.preventDefault() if the click originated within an element with ui-sref.  I'll change that to a list of attributes with ui-sref and href.  What other attributes should be added to the list to resolve your issue?\n. @zurbchris @gakimball \nLet me know your thoughts on this.  I'll be making these changes in my fork.  I can get a PR submitted today if you provide feedback.\n. I know both show/hide and open/close are used in messages, but which is the preferred standard so the animation messages can use those values?\n. I made this comment on #670, but should include it here for completeness:\nAccordions and Tabs do not use the foundation sub/pub system to handle changing active state of elements. In these cases, two-way binding of scope.active would have to be used to be notified of active state changes. The two-way bound value should be readonly until support is added to the Accordion and Tabs to support changing to active state outside of the directive.\n. this has been completed in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. Changes allow grid-block panels to animate properly.  Also adds supports for a force-animation attribute on the panel directive (when provided, allows animations to run on large devices).\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. @gakimball\nHow heavily is jQuery used in foundation for sites?  Is it unthinkable to try to remove that dependency?\nFrom an architecture standpoint, you shouldn't be writing core functionality in angular.  Any components shared between F4S and F4A should be part of a shared core framework.  This core framework should be javascript only with minimal dependencies.  This will enable the framework to be used by ANY javascript framework and not just F4S and F4A (#587).\nF4A is already in a predicament with angular in that angular 2.0 is stated to not be backwards compatible with angular 1.0.  A ton of effort will need to be spent migrating the code to work with angular 2.0, so rather than making EVERYTHING angular, now would be a great time to figure out which code is not angular dependent and put that into the core JS framework.  The core JS framework can then be wrapped by F4A to provide an angular solution and wrapped by F4S to provide a jQuery solution.  The core JS framework can also be wrapped by others to provide similar functionality for other common web frameworks.\n. You can do something similar to angular 1.0 (likely the same in 2.0, but haven't looked into it), where they use jqLite and allow for dropping in your own implementation if needed. This allows angular to work with jQuery without having to change any internal functionality as the drop in replacement (jQuery) is a superset of the required framework (jqLite). So if you want to use this new foundation core JS in angular, you could drop in angular.element and the framework should work. You can also drop in jQuery when using it for F4S and it should work as well.\nI don't think there is a major issue here so long as the core JS is properly wrapped. So for instance with angular, you'll still want to use directives as much as possible as they are extremely powerful, but you'll need to ensure $scope.digest or $scope.apply is called in the correct locations after DOM manipulation is done via the core JS framework so the directive (and other scopes) reflect the changes.\n. @gakimball @zurbchris \nHere's an interesting article on Angular 2 I found that relates directly to this conversation.  I would suggest reading the entire article as it mentions some good points you'll want to keep in mind when developing a plain JS UI framework.  Here are some snippets:\n2.3.6 jqLite\njQuery has been supported in Angular since day one. That support isn't going away, but Angular will no longer include it's own miniature version (jqLite). It's also in line with how Angular prefers declarative over imperative (as discussed in 2.1.2).\n2.1.2 Controllers, providers, and directives\nOne of the most common use cases in web development is creating custom pieces of elements on a page, like tabs or buttons with spinners in them. Today the web lacks a good way to separate concerns and easily manipulate the DOM. While things are on their way (see section 2.2) we've had the need for some time.\njQuery is great for controlling the DOM in a direct way. We call that an imperative model. To help developers transition to Angular it has supported that way of thinking. But Angular has at the same time tried to give us a more declarative model where we're more concerned with what, rather than how. Data binding is probably the most notable of these features as we can just use our JS data in the HTML, rather than grabbing the element and pushing in the value ourselves.\n. Feel free to submit this PR against the new fork\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. This was incorrectly reported.  I had the markup within a form that was not tagged as grid-block, causing issues on iOS.\n. I believe this is addressed with PR https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/pull/670, however per my comments, some standardization of how active state is handled should be addressed before making these one off changes.  I'll leave it up to the folks at zurb as to whether or not this advice is taken into consideration.\n. Correct, adding optional two way binding would require checking if the active attribute was set on the element. If so, the code does not need to set scope.active as the initial value was provided by the user. If the active attribute is not set, the code would have to set scope.active = false by default as the active property on the scope will not exist since it was not provided by the user.\n. this will be addressed with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/25\n. this issue with be addressed with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/24\n. @rafibomb I was thinking you could adjust the padding to account for the 1 px border, however, this is a bit complicated by how foundation uses the button padding\n``` sass\n$button-padding: 0.85em 1em !default;\n%button {\n   padding: $button-padding;\n   ...\n}\n```\nThe $button-padding variable allows css shorthand format to be used, thus the value must be parsed to figure out exactly what padding the user has configured for each side.  I found an example of how css shorthand can be parsed in SASS: https://gist.github.com/pixelwhip/8428447\nOnce the individual padding values are known for each side, the calc() method can be used to adjust the padding by 1px.\nsass\n@mixin button-style(...) {\n  @if $style == hollow {\n    border: 1px solid $background;\n    padding-top: calc(#{$button-padding-top} - 1px);\n    padding-right: calc(#{$button-padding-right} - 1px);\n    padding-bottom: calc(#{$button-padding-bottom} - 1px);\n    padding-left: calc(#{$button-padding-left} - 1px);\n    ...\n}\n. Perhaps I should have just scrolled a bit lower in the file before writing my comment.  Seems there already exists a method for getting the value for a specific side get-side($padding, right)\n. @MiguelMike @rafibomb fixed!\n. will replace with new PR\n. this issue with be addressed with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/24\n. Feel free to contribute to the documentation in the new fork\n. @mattgrande I'm not sure if it would help, but I made some changes to how zf-advise works in the framework (https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/pull/741).  I've only ever needed to use zf-advise for panels, not modals, so these changes may not fix your issue.\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. ZURB has basically dropped support for this framework and it is now being maintained by the community as https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps.\nI've gone through the entire codebase and wrote an unsubscribed method for every subscribe method.  Feel free to run the same analytics against v1.2.5 and create issues as needed.\n. this issue with be addressed with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/24\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. Feel free to submit this PR against the new fork\n. It's unfortunate this framework isn't receiving the attention it needs.  My company is heavily invested in Foundation 4 Apps and there is no way of switching away from it. Because of this, I've had to take the initiative of fixing framework related issues myself. A large number of these fixes have been sitting in PRs for months.\nIn order to release quality apps, I've had to use a fork of this framework where I can make necessary fixes. That fork is https://github.com/fiboacademy/foundation-apps/tree/fibo-master.  I've been using the framework in production for over a year and really love it, just wish I didn't have to maintain the framework myself.\n. From what I've heard, they are working on a V2 which will integrate with Angular 2 and share styling from Foundation for Sites 6 as @DaSchTour stated.  I completely agree with the approach, but that doesn't mean to abandon V1.  For those like me that are using V1 in production code, it is important that bug fixes are still made to the framework (especially when some of these fixes are already done and just waiting to be merged).\n. Sounds like it's time for the community to take it over?  I'm heavily reliant on the framework and can't give it up, so I'll need to maintain it myself anyway.  The framework is pretty solid for what its worth (after all the bug fixes I've made).\n. I'm all for getting the process started on migrating this framework away from ZURB.  If we're going to maintain an open source version, I wouldn't mind taking that over.  I'm actively working on apps which fully depend on the framework, so I would love to see it get the attention it needs.\nI've been maintaining my own custom build of the framework which is used in all apps I develop at Fibo.  These apps have been running in production for over a year and a half, so I trust this build of the framework far more than the current state of the foundation apps master.  As such, I would highly suggest using this build as the base for the framework going forward.\nIn terms of org, we could use the FiboAcademy organization where I maintain my custom build and apps.  I'm fine with whatever name is chosen, though perhaps something with angular would be appropriate, maybe angular-apps.  I'm not too keen on changing the naming convention from zf to something else.  It would be a real pain for those of us trying to migrate to the new framework.  It would also be annoying for those that start using foundation apps thinking it is still being maintained, then find this new open source version that requires them to change all the code they wrote.  I think a drop in replacement for 1.2 (or as close to it as possible) should be the first version of this new framework.\n. @AntJanus I've fine with a new org, though foundation (or whatever the next iteration becomes) will never be moved away from in the FiboAcademy org.  I've spent the last year and a half building out a custom angular suite on top of foundation which integrates with our backend infrastructure.  All business operations apps have been fully switched over to the new framework as of a couple months ago, so trying to reverse that or go in a different direction would be a vast waste of resources.\n. The fibo-apps framework is in a private repo. You were just looking at the custom build of foundation which is foundation with my pending PRs accepted.\nAs for name, I'd prefer base over open.\n. What about angular-base?\n. I was specifically just speaking for the fork name which should always stay angular.  Perhaps something like base-apps as you suggested would work for the naming of the org and angular-base for the fork.  Foundation for Apps is really just a styling framework at it's core, so I see your point in thinking about other front end frameworks.  We could use the same convention of -base for other frameworks like react-base and ember-base.\n. It would be a good idea to continue with the decoupling of the framework that was started with https://github.com/zurb/front-router and https://github.com/zurb/motion-ui.  This would help move in the direction of enabling other front end frameworks, though angular should be the primary focus for now.\n. If architected properly, the thing that would set this new framework apart from Angular Material, and others, is to enable cross-framework integration.  This way the framework just supports styling and can be leveraged by any javascript framework.  If framework specific logic is needed to power the library, which in most cases it will, a *-base repo can be created which provides the integration.\n. The majority of the issues with this framework have been resolved as of v1.2.5 from https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. Similar to https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/804\n. will replace with corrected PR\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. The modal overlay close triggers the deactivate method to be called on the modal which simply hide the modal.  You'll need to call destroy to have the modal removed from the DOM.  If you give your modal a hard-coded ID, you can then subscribe to messages for the modal.  When you get the close message, call modal.destroy() like in the examples.\nBy the way, this repo has been dead for awhile and is now being maintained in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps.  If you want, you can create a PR to introduce the concept of overlayDestroy.  Similar to overlayClose, it would cause the modal to close when clicking on the overlay, however, once the animation is completed, the modal would be destroyed.\n. @cisdev739 I added a destroy-on-close attribute for modals with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/16.  It will be part of the 1.3 release.\n. Feel free to submit this PR against the new fork\n. @HuemanF I believe this is simply due to how the SCSS is structured.  The resulting behavior for grid-block (flex-flow: row nowrap) is intended.  If you wish to have flex-flow: row wrap, you can use the wrap class in combination with the grid-block class.  You can review the docs for grid-block to get a better understand of the functionality.\nZURB has basically dropped support for this framework and it is now being maintained by the community as https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps.\n. ZURB has unofficially dropped support for this framework and it is now being maintained by the community.  The docs can be found here: https://base-apps.github.io/angular-base-apps\n. @Seb- Yes the fork is production ready.  I use it for all apps in my company.  I even have them running the v2.0 prerelease without issues.\n. @kobekoto I suggest trying out Angular Base Apps if you want to use this framework (see https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/829 for more info)\n. these issues should be resolved as of v1.2.5 of the community fork for this repo: https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n@FezVrasta if you want to play around with popper.js integration then feel free to submit a PR against the fork above\n. @gakimball Just as curiosity, what are those three frameworks?  Foundation for Apps, Foundation for Sites, and ...?\n. @gakimball Oh ok, yeah I new about Ink and the rebranding to Foundation for Emails, but didn't realize there was a need for a CLI for that framework.  I thought it was just templates you copied and manually injected whatever content you needed into the provided areas.  I haven't used F4E yet (which may be clear by my last statement), though that is definitely something I want to get started with as my company emails need some much loving care.\n. @hshepherd @vincentmorneau Not sure if either of you have solved this already, but I encountered the same issue and resolved it by adding SCSS similar to what's shown below:\n``` scss\nmy-actionsheet .action-sheet {\ntransform: translateX(-70px) translateY(107px);\n&::before, &::after {\n    left: 10%;\n  }\n}\n```\nCouple things to note:\n1. Transform will only move the body of the action sheet.  The other styling will move the attached arrow.\n2. The exact numbers (-70px, 107px, 10%) were determine through trial and error, and based on personal preference\n3. This fix is very fragile and will likely need to be updated if ANY changes are made to the action sheet (e.g. adding more options) or if changes are made to the title bar.\nLive Example: https://parents.fiboart.com (click Art or Coding at top left)\n. +1\n. @gakimball I believe the same solution used for auto-closing of action sheets when clicked outside should also work for closing of off-canvas and panels.  Perhaps refactor the code into a reusable service to be used for any component?\n. @gakimball did you mean zfClose?  That could be used on the body with an element ID and if any click event reaches the body, it would be closed.  There are a couple problems with that approach: \n1. You cannot specify more than one element to close, thus you cannot close the off-canvas AND panels with this method.\n2. All click events that open/toggle a component must now trap the event or else it'll bubble up to the body and close the component.\n3. Any click event inside the component must be trapped or it'll cause the component to close (for same reason as 2).\n4. The body element is usually defined in an index.html, where as all other components are defined else where (i.e. in views).  Forcing a declaration on the body would cause a developer to have to know the id for every component used in their app, which becomes difficult once you start developing a large application.\nI prefer the approach used by the actionsheets wherein the developer does not need to set anything up for the auto-close functionality to work as it's just part of the component (solves 4).  It's basically doing the same thing as zfClose would be doing if added to the body, but works for multiple elements (solves 1).  The slight difference is that the actionsheet logic checks to see if the click was within the actionsheet, and if so, it doesn't close the actionsheet (solves 3).  This logic seems useful for off-canvas and panels as well.  It also checks to make sure that the click didn't originate from an element used to open or close the component (solves 2).  With some refactoring, the code used for actionsheets could also be used for off-canvas and panels.  Any opposition to taking this approach?\nThe only thing I could think of for why this approach may not work is if a developer didn't want the auto-close functionality for that component.  In this case an attribute could be added to the element which is read during the compile phase of the directive.  If the attribute is present, the auto-close functionality is disabled, otherwise it is enabled by default.\nI'll take a go at the PR since it should be fairly straightforward.\n. I was searching for zfClosable instead of zf-closable in the code base.  Let me see what can be done with zf-closable.\n. Ok, so I think FoundationApi.closeActiveElements() (the code that makes use of the zf-closable attributes) could be used to solve this issue.  At its most basic, one could expose FoundationApi in the scope and add the following to an element: ng-click=\"FoundationApi.closeActiveElements()\".  Adding that to the body element would solve this issue.  This approach will still cause the component to close if the click originated from inside the component.  To solve this, one could add ng-click=\"$event.stopPropagation()\" to their component.  I tested this with off-canvas and the off-canvas closes when clicked outside, but stays open when clicked inside.  I don't have any panels in my app to test this with, but I'm sure it would work just the same.\nI'm not a huge fan of this approach as it will not work for everyone.  From what I can tell, F4A is being designed so that it could be used by anyone, regardless of how little or how much they know about angular.  The solution above will require the FoundationApi to be exposed in the scope, which will require defining your own angular code (unless this can be done in the front matter, which I'm not sure it should be).  To solve this, a reference to the FoundationApi service could be added to the $rootScope on loading of foundation so that the following could be used ng-click=\"$root.$foundation.closeActiveElements()\" instead of ng-click=\"FoundationApi.closeActiveElements()\".  While most of the time adding something to the $rootScope is a bad design pattern, I think this will be ok as the foundation api is a core service that should be available everywhere.\n. After thinking about it, I still would prefer this feature to work out of the box with no additional code required, meaning the code to resolve this issue should reside inside the foundation code base, versus requiring additional angular directives to use this feature.  Perhaps foundation could add a default click handler to the body which always calls closeActiveElements.  The click handler could be smart and check where the click originated from and not close a component if the click was inside it.  If a developer doesn't want their component auto-closed when clicked outside, they could add an attribute zf-auto-close-ignore or something of the like, so that the component is not closed by the body click handler, but would still be closed by usage of the zf-hard-toggle directive (which internally calls closeActiveElements).\n. @Martinspire You can implement this feature my adding the following attribute to any element you want to have close the off canvas (in my example the off canvas has id app-menu).\nng-click=\"closeAppMenu()\"\nWhere closeAppMenu is the following function on the scope.  You might not need the $timeout anymore.  It was originally added before some of the $$phase bugs were fixed in the framework.\njs\n$scope.closeAppMenu = function() {\n  $timeout(function() {\n    FoundationApi.publish('app-menu', 'close');\n  });\n};\nNote that I did not add the click handler to the body as the body also contains the off canvas menu.  I added the click handler to the root element containing my views so that clicking inside the off canvas does not lose the menu.  In some cases where I need the menu to close when I click a link inside the off canvas, I've added the following element to the link:\nzf-toggle=\"app-menu\"\n. ZURB has basically dropped support for this framework and it is now being developed by the community here: https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\nFeel free to submit a PR to improve the documentation\n. I did forget to comment on one other thing.  There are changes made to the default app.js file which are to highlight the changes required if using HTML5 mode.  Those changes can be commented out or reverted.\n. I've come to realized that it may be best for the iconic directive to simply call $compile at all times after injecting the svg.  The reasoning is because $compile is required for the dynSrc attribute to operate properly.  Currently the dynSrc attribute is evaluated in the prelinking phase and sets the source.  If the interoplated dynSrc attribute were to change, the change is not propagated to the iconic directive and the icon is not updated.  In order for the icon to update after the source change, the directive needs to be recompiled using the original content prior to first compile.  I'm working on a solution now that I'll share once complete.\nIf the above change is made and $compile is already being called in the directive, then IMO $compile should be called after injecting the svg to make the solution complete.\n. I just added the changes required to make the iconic directive truly dynamic.  The directive is now recompiled when dynSrc is updated.  I've also added an additional attribute, dynIcon, which provides the same functionality as data-icon, but dynamically recompiles upon changes.\n. +1 for this feature.  I've found myself needing it a time or two.\n. @gakimball would you or someone on your team be able to look over this request to see if it's possible?  I just did some research and stumbled across this library: https://github.com/marcj/css-element-queries.  I think if that library were integrated into the foundation-apps framework, I could achieve my goal.  I haven't mastered sass yet, so I'm not sure if it'll work by just looking at the code, but I think if the code was updated to extend the breakpoint mixin (or create a separate but similar one), the css output could include [min-width=\"###px\"] or [max-width=\"###px\"] instead of the media query containing (min-width: ###px) or (max-width: ###px).  Then if you added a new class (e.g. responsive-block) to specify a \"new device\", css selectors could be constructed such that the following would cause the child elements of the responsive-block to only switch to medium-6, once the width of the responsive-block exceeded the medium threshold (e.g. 640px) versus when the device exceeded the medium threshold (e.g. 640px).\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-frame\">\n  <div class=\"grid-block\"></div>\n  <div class=\"grid-block responsive-block\">\n    <div class=\"grid-block small-12 medium-6\"></div>\n    <div class=\"grid-block small-12 medium-6\"></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n. @gakimball would you be opposed to including the library above? I wouldn't mind getting started on the integration to see if it would work. I'm starting to build out more of my company apps with foundation and having the ability to share responsive directives across apps will be key to fast paced development.\n. Here's an article I came across that better sums up my point: http://ianstormtaylor.com/media-queries-are-a-hack\nI'm not sure if there is an optimal element query library out there yet.  The one I proposed using is clearly marked \"proof of concept\", so might not be ready to include in any framework quite yet, though it might be something to base a similar solution of off.  After working on the zf-if-* directives and getting the media queries hooked up through a directive, I wonder if there is a similar way that element queries could be achieved.  It might be able to work if you just strip the min/max width from the media query and do a sizing check on the element attached to the directive.  I'll play around with it in the future and see what I come up with.  So long as it's in a directive, the code won't get run if you don't use it, so even a \"use sparingly\" notice in the docs could warn people if the directive doesn't perform well enough, though I don't think it should be an issue since we'd only do the sizing checks on the resize event.  How the responsive sizing behavior will cascades down to child elements is another story.\n. @gakimball I think it did it!  By making some modifications to the zf-if directives I added, you can now specify a zf-if-type attribute that, if set to \"element\", will perform the query on the element.  Here's an example of how it works:\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-frame wrap align-center\">\n   <div class=\"grid-block small-12\">\n      <span zf-if-small=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">SMALL</span>\n      <span zf-if-medium=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">MEDIUM</span>\n      <span zf-if-large=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">LARGE</span>\n      <span zf-if-small-only=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">SMALL ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-medium-only=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">MEDIUM ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-large-only=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">LARGE ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-not-small=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">NOT SMALL</span>\n      <span zf-if-not-medium=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">NOT ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-not-large=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">NOT ONLY</span>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"grid-block small-6\">\n      <span zf-if-small=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">SMALL</span>\n      <span zf-if-medium=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">MEDIUM</span>\n      <span zf-if-large=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">LARGE</span>\n      <span zf-if-small-only=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">SMALL ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-medium-only=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">MEDIUM ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-large-only=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">LARGE ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-not-small=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">NOT SMALL</span>\n      <span zf-if-not-medium=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">NOT ONLY</span>\n      <span zf-if-not-large=\"\" zf-if-type=\"element\">NOT ONLY</span>\n   </div>\n</div>\nWhen resizing your browser, the set of zf-if-* child elements under the grid-block.small-12 will perform element queries that result in the same outcome as running media queries since that element takes up the entire width of the screen.  The set of zf-if-* child elements under the grid-block.small-6 element will show different results as the queries are run against the element which is half the size of the device.\nng-hide/ng-show style directives are not needed for media queries since that is hooked up through CSS, however, ng-hide/ng-show style directives would be needed for element queries.  Using the template for the zf-if directives, one could easily create zf-hide/zf-show directives matching all the zf-if directives above.  I'd be happy to add those if my changes are accepted.\n. @gakimball Awesome, looking forward to hearing your thoughts on my implementation.  BTW I did some refactoring since that last post.  The attribute to define the query type is now zf-query-type.\n. Perhaps this is just my lack of knowledge speaking, but isn't this already achievable by the date and month HTML5 input types?\n. +1\nFound a breaking change in 1.0.3 (#477) that would have likely been caught with testing.\n. I currently have code in production that uses this functionality and would really like to consume the 1.0.3 changes, so I need this to be fixed or find an alternate solution.  I need to publish an update tonight, so I'm looking into a fix for this right now.  I'll post back to this thread with my findings.\n. Just found a hotfix.  Adding the action-sheet-container class to the element that toggles the actionsheet will allow it to work.  The one caveat is that I have two dropdowns in my titlebar, so if I click the second dropdown trigger while the first actionsheet is displayed, the second actionsheet is displayed as well without hiding the first actionsheet.  This happens regardless of whether I use zf-toggle or zf-hard-toggle.  I'll see if I can fix that, though regardless of what hotfix I come up with, a robust solution to this issue will still be needed.\n. Ok found the final hotfix I'll be using until this gets fixed.  In addition to adding the action-sheet-container class, I added a click handler to the dropdown trigger which closes all other dropdowns:\nfoundationApi.publish(dropdown, 'close');\nNow if you try to click the second dropdown while the first is open, it will close the first and vice versa.  The hotfix doesn't require any changes to the framework, so I'm happy with this for now.\n. @jeaniec please check whether this change conflicts with your changes made by 4b6a3fd70bca6f3c669f4205968ea7ea5e01b992 \n. @jeaniec That's not entirely true (at least as I understand the code, which isn't to say correctly) but as long as the solution you coded up works for dynamically adding of notifications (which at first glance it should) then I'm all good!\n. Good call on the support already existing for FA component selection.  One more thing to add to my backlog.\n. An exposed service property would be exactly what I need for my solution (see below).  Since I'm using ng-if, the element will be shown if angular is not supported as the ng-if attribute will have no effect and thus still show the element.  If angular is supported, the result of the expression will be used and since angular is supported, the expression will have access to the exposed service property.\nHere's the overlay solution I used (note that Modernizr was added to the scope for this to work):\nhtml\n<div class=\"browser-not-supported\" ng-if=\"!Modernizr.flexbox\">\n  <div class=\"error-message\">\n    <p>\n      We're sorry, but your browser does not support all required functionality needed to run our app.\n      Please update your browser by clicking <a href=\"http://www.browsehappy.com\">here</a> or \n      switch to a different device before continuing.  If you're using Internet Explorer, try turning off\n      Compatibility View.\n    </p>\n    <br/>\n    <p>\n      We apologize for the inconvenience.  If you have any questions, please call us at \n      <a href=\"tel:+15555555555\">555-555-5555</a> or email us at \n      <a href=\"mailto:test@test.com\">test@test.com</a>.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>\nAnd here's the accompanying SCSS\n``` scss\n.browser-not-supported {\n    .error-message {\n        a {\n            color: #fff;\n            font-weight: bold;\n        }\n    p, a {\n        font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important;\n    }\n\n    background: $alert-color;\n    color: #fff;\n    padding: 1%;\n    width: 50%;\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 15%;\n    left: 50%;\n    margin: 0 0 0 -25%; /* add negative left margin for half the width to center the div */\n    cursor: default;\n    z-index: 10001;\n    border-radius: 4px;\n    box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.9);\n}\n\nposition: absolute;\ntop: 0;\nleft: 0;\nheight: 100%; \nwidth: 100%; \nz-index: 10000;\nbackground: #000; /* fallback */\nbackground: rgba(0,0,0,0.75);\n\n}\n```\n. @gakimball It doesn't appear as though states can be redefined.  I get this error when I tried to define a state with the same name as the front matter:\nError: State 'home' is already defined\nI think you may be able to extend the states using the $stateProvider.decorator method.  In my case it's just easier for me to remove the front matter and manage the states myself when I need a more complex state, though the decorator may be a solution for @mannyhenri's use case.\n. Related: #477\n. @gakimball I would like to have a panel that is converted into a block still animate as shown in the code for #572.  Would a slight change to this fix be better for allowing that (i.e. make the disabling configurable) or should I stick with the approach I'm going with in #572?  \nThe annoying part of the approach I'm taking is that when the panel is a block, I must track the visibility of it using some variable and use ng-if/ng-show/ng-hide to animate it.  It would be nice to be able to simply call FoundationApi('panel-id', ...) and have the panel OR block animate in/out.  Otherwise I need to ensure I set the visibility variable to true BEFORE calling FoundationApi('panel-id', 'open') or else the panel will not display.  Similarly I must set the visibility to false AFTER the animation out plays on the panel or else the panel will not animate.  The fix for #572 could make this a bit easier, but I would still need to track the visibility of the block in my own code versus using the already existing code provided by the panel directive.\nThe one advantage of doing it the way I describe in the issue is that I could use different animations for the panel and block, however, I don't need that.  If someone did want that, a small addition to the panel directive could allow configuring different animations when the element is a panel or block.\n. @gakimball Could you explain the challenges with web apps just for my own understanding?\n. @gakimball Thanks for the breakdown.  I'm not quite sure you need that functionality to implement the swipe/reveal feature I have in mind, though if you do, perhaps you could help me understand.  What I have in mind is that you would swipe in one direction on an element, that element would then move in the direction swiped and stop after a specified distance.  The ability to swipe/reveal is an all or nothing action, so your top element either doesn't move or animates a specified distance and stops.  Under that element is another hidden element which is revealed.  It's basically an off-canvas for a single block.\n. BTW, the link provided in my original post was just to visually demonstrate what I was implying with my feature request and why the feature might be useful.  The link was not meant to provide details in terms of implementation, though I'm glad you provided clarity on the subject for my understanding.\n. I think this can be achieved fairly easily with just one more addition to F4A.  With v1.1 I can make it so that on the click of an element a menu option animates in from the right.  I just need the ability to make it so that on the swipe of the element in a specific direction, the same thing happens as if it were clicked.  I created 4 directives to achieve this: zf-swipe-left, zf-swipe-right, zf-swipe-up, zf-swipe-down.  Each directive takes an expression like ng-click and runs the expression when the element is swiped in the specified direction.\nHow do I create a PR for this without it combining with my existing PR?\n. @gakimball I'm doing everything on one branch (thus the reason 2e14f63c57e4541f30f62e65d4e0b6ecec68a8f0 was added to #539 instead of its own PR).  I'll move this code over to another branch and submit the PR when I find the time.  Thanks!\n. As alluded to above, are there plans to integrate animations with ng-show or ng-hide?  So far everything I want to use animations on requires using ng-if.\n. @gakimball I started using F4A when it first came out and couldn't get the ng-show or ng-hide animations to work out of the box like I did with ng-if.  The apps I build are used to run my business and being the only developer at my company, I haven't had much time to investigate alternate solutions. Animations are not critical to my apps since I just need them to work and not necessarily be flashy (though that is always a plus).  I'll let you know when I find the time to investigate this issue more in detail.\n@Joe-5mith Do you have any examples you can share that showcase ng-show animations not working?  If so, could you create another issue with those details?  I'd do this myself at some point, but I don't foresee being able to get around to it in the near future.\n. @gakimball In your testing of v1.1 and the rework done to animations, did you try using ng-show or ng-hide in any of your tests/examples?  I know this is a lot to ask, but it would be extremely helpful if there was a page in the docs that showed how to integrate the Motion UI into angular, with examples of ng-if, ng-show, ng-hide, ng-repeat, and others if there are more.  Perhaps just integrating some animations into the existing examples would help to clarify exactly how the Motion UI classes should be used with angular directives.\n. @gakimball Awesome!  Thanks for figuring that out!  Are you thinking that could get into v1.1 or is it too close to your desired deadline?\n. @gakimball If only they were all that easy!  Can't wait to get my hands on v1.1!\n. My original title was correct, this also doesn't work for hide-for-*.  I added the changes to my PR.\n. this will be addressed with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/25\n. I agree with @circlingthesun.  I recently switched all the internal messaging in my apps to use the angular pub/sub method as it greatly simplified sending messages and data from one part of the app to another.  One additional benefit of using the angular sub/pub, is that you can broadcast messages to your children elements only as well as emit from your child elements to the parent, which could be useful in some of the foundation components.\n. I think it is possible to come up with a solution for backward compatibility (e.g. turn foundation sub/pub into wrapper for $rootScope $on/$broadcast and internally switch to using only angular sub/pub), however, in agreement with your last statement, it's all throw away work if the framework is converted to angular 2 (which I'm all for!).  Unless there are limitations in the foundation sub/pub that must be fixed to develop certain features, I'm not sure converting to use the angular sub/pub system would be worth the cost.  Having used F4A for awhile now, I rarely use the foundation sub/pub in my JS code as the F4A directives take care of most cases where it's needed, so being required to continue to use the foundation sub/pub in those rare cases isn't a huge deal for me.\n. I got the following directives to work: zf-if-small, zf-if-medium, zf-if-large, zf-if-portrait, zf-if-landscape, zf-if-retina.  I designed it so that as long as there is a named query, a one line change can be made to add a new directive for that query.  I'll get it working with '-only' next.  Stay tuned...\n. zf-if-small-only, zf-if-medium-only, and zf-if-large-only directive have been added\n. zf-if-not-small, zf-if-not-medium, and zf-if-not-large directives have been added\n. idk if I did that PR correctly.  I only wanted to include commit 119b6b4939dc43bca01c09e598dbc5413c9c6d27\n. I used logic similar to that in the sass code for handling of the only case.  I get the next media size up and subtract a little from its min-width to get the max-width for the current named query.  Seems to work great, though it assumes at the moment that all queries will have em as their units.  \nThe robustness of the code needs to be built out as it should be able to handle any units and the logic should ideally match exactly with the sass code.  The logic for determining only should probably be moved to the media query service versus inside my directive as it'll be easier to maintain if it's with all the other media query code.\n. Here's how interchange works now:\n<zf-interchange>\n  <div media=\"small\">SHOWN ON SMALL ONLY</div>\n  <div media=\"medium\">SHOWN ON MEDIUM ONLY</div>\n  <div media=\"large\">SHOWN ON LARGE ONLY</div>\n</zf-interchange>\nHere's how you can achieve the same things with the new directives:\n<div zf-if-small-only=\"\">SHOWN ON SMALL ONLY</div>\n<div zf-if-medium-only=\"\">SHOWN ON MEDIUM ONLY</div>\n<div zf-if-large-only=\"\">SHOWN ON LARGE ONLY</div>\nHere is a complete list of the added directives which match the available visibility classes:\n<p zf-if-small=\"\">You are on a small or larger device.</p>\n<p zf-if-medium=\"\">You are on a medium or larger device.</p>\n<p zf-if-large=\"\">You are on a large or larger device.</p>\n<p zf-if-small-only=\"\">You are on a small device.</p>\n<p zf-if-medium-only=\"\">You are on a medium device.</p>\n<p zf-if-large-only=\"\">You are on a large device.</p>\n<p zf-if-landscape=\"\">You are in a landscape orientation.</p>\n<p zf-if-portrait=\"\">You are in a portrait orientation.</p>\n+1 Bonus\n<p zf-if-retina=\"\">You are on a retina device.</p>\n. More directives!\n<p zf-if-not-small=\"\">You are not on small device.</p>\n<p zf-if-not-medium=\"\">You are not on medium device.</p>\n<p zf-if-not-large=\"\">You are not on large device.</p>\n. I had to make some changes to how the zf-if-* directives were being compiled.  The existing method was causing exceptions to occur when using it on an element with other directives like ng-transclude.  The updated method will compile the zf-if-* directives into a zf-if directive with the appropriate configuration.  The solution was based on this stack overflow post: http://stackoverflow.com/a/19228302\n. I'm not exactly sure how to do this, but 2e14f63c57e4541f30f62e65d4e0b6ecec68a8f0 should be in its own PR.  Is there a way to create two separate PRs at the same time both being from the same branch?\n. I see that swipe close is already hooked up for all notifications.  Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to configure the animation, though it nicely defaults to fadeIn/fadeOut.\n. Yeah you should be able to hook it up the same way as ng-enter and ng-show.  I did that and it worked when I gave a fake class for the out animation in the SCSS, but I didn't take it future as some redesign is needed since you'll have to require another animation class.  As I mentioned in my example, I want to be able to use a different animation for move than in/out as the move animation is along a different axis than the in/out animation.\n. @DAmatheson nice catch!  I've submitted a PR for the fix.\n. One thing to point out here is that this solution does NOT provide a way to make the sizing classes (i.e. small-#, medium-vertical, large-horizontal, etc) work off element queries instead of media queries.  So if you use one of the added directives as an element query and the attached element contains a child grid-block with one of the sizing classes, the sizing of that block is based on the media and not the element.\nGetting the sizing classes to work off element queries is the key to getting a truly responsive framework.  I played around with it last night and found a way I can get it so that if you add a specific directive to an element (e.g. zf-responsive-block), it can update all child elements within it, so that each of those elements are configured to perform element queries.  The directive recursively travels down the DOM until all elements within the original zf-responsive-block have been configured.  The result of running the element query will cause a class to get added to the element (e.g. is-small, is-medium, is-large).  I now need to figure out how to get the breakpoint mixin to respect these classes so that the media query is not run if an element has one of those classes since the presence of those classes indicate an element query was already run and a media query is not required.\nThe above is going to take a lot of effort to get right, so I'll continue that effort in a separate PR (which will be posted once I have something worth sharing).\n. @gakimball Turns out it wasn't too difficult to get the sizing classes to work based off element queries instead of media queries (at least for the use cases I tried).  I included those changes in this PR so that they could be reviewed along with the interchange directives as both rely heavily on the media query service.  Both changes still need some cleaning up as they are hard coded to only work with small, medium, and large named classes, versus dynamically adjusting to whatever the developer chooses to use as their named breakpoints.  I think the code should also be refactored into different files as everything currently resides in the interchange js and html file.  I'm not sure of the desired workflow for such changes so I'll wait to hear back on your guidelines.\n. @gakimball I've been using the zf-if-* directives throughout my code in place of zf-interchange and really like how easy it is to specify exactly when to show something based off a media query.  It also removes the extra parent element (e.g. <div>) added by zf-interchange.  If there is any desire to pull in those changes without element query support, let me know and I can split up the PR.  I've noticed some issues with element queries while playing around with them (specifically that the element query is not rerun in some cases), so it would probably be better left for a 1.3 or 2.0 release since a lot of testing will be required to ensure it's fully working.  I have a future project in mind that would greatly benefit from element queries so I hope I can get that feature stabilized at some point so it can be included in F4A.\n. @gakimball I stabilized the element queries by including this library: https://github.com/sdecima/javascript-detect-element-resize\n. @gakimball thanks for the feedback.  I'll revert that code related to element queries from this PR.\nI like the idea of having a string passed in to specify the media queries for all the reasons you called out.  I'll make the necessary changes to the zf-if, zf-hide and zf-show directives.\n. Is this something that could get into the next release or does it need to wait until a major release?\n. @gakimball After making the updates to the directives and integrating them into my existing published app, I noticed an issue with the following markup I had that worked with my old implementation:\nhtml\n<div zf-if=\"not large\"/>\n<div zf-if=\"large\"/>\nThe large will display on large or larger screens and the not large will show if the device is not large.  \nThis works great so long as you're on a large or smaller device.  If you go into xlarge, both will end up being displayed.  What I really need is for the not large to display if the device is medium or smaller.  As you mentioned in one of your comments, the existing interchange mechanism supports this, however, I still would prefer to use the zf-if style, so to accommodate that use case, there needs to be a way to specify that I want something to show up if the device is _____ or smaller.\nDo you have any preference on the verbiage used to specify something is _____ or smaller?  Possible solutions for declaring something be shown for large or smaller could be: <= medium, less than or equal to medium, medium or smaller, < large, less than large, or something else.\nAs of now the following verbiage exists.  Placement of not and only do not matter (i.e. can be before or after named breakpoint):\nlarge: Show for large or larger (shown for large, xlarge, xxlarge)\nnot large: Show if not large (shown for small, medium, xlarge, xxlarge)\nlarge only: Show if large only (shown for large)\n. I added what I needed to the directives.  I used the \"or smaller\" verbiage, though that can be changed if desired.  I also moved all media query logic out of the directives and into the service for easier reusability.\n. First off, I switched to using F4A for all apps I develop at my company.  In order to make reusing modules across apps easy, I created a single module to store all common app logic and components.  Since I use F4A as the core of my apps, this single module is allowed to also contain front matter to pass through the dynamic routing F4A provides.  An example of this is my shared account module which houses all components for account management and is set up so that it uses the url /account/... for all the states in that module.  Some of the views in that module use front matter to define their states.\nI wrote a small shell script which is used to build any of my apps.  That script first builds the shared module then builds the desired app.  The way my build is set up, it requires running the dynamic routing against the shared module code first, then later against the app code.  I needed a way such that I could combine the output of the two runs, thus my proposed PR.\n. I'm wondering maybe a different approach could be used.  Currently a global variable is used to hold the routes and it is used in the config function of the foundation.dynamicRouting module js file.  I think it could be changed so that the module config call is removed from the js file and each run of the dynamic routing plugin produces the following snippet of code:\njs\nangular.module('foundation.dynamicRouting').config(['FoundationStateProvider',\n  function(FoundationStateProvider) {\n    FoundationStateProvider.registerDynamicRoutes(/* routes */);\n  }\n]);\nThis way regardless of how many times one needs to run the plugin, the code outputted is always the same.  It'll also remove the need for a global variable.\n. @AntJanus Yes fs.appendFile will write the file if it doesn't exist (see the docs).\nThe suggestion in my last comment was not to have the plugin create a module that sets up the routes as that module already exists with foundation.dynamicRouting.  The suggestion is to simply have the plugin output code that calls the config method on this existing module versus storing the routes in a global variable and using that variable in the config call in foundation.dynamicRouting.js.  This does not require appending to an existing file, though it would change the workflow and require the routes js file(s) be included AFTER the foundation js files, as the routes js file(s) would require the foundation.dynamicRouting module to exist.  The code as is in my PR does not require this workflow change since it still uses the global variable.\n. After reviewing the code again, I believe the append option I added to the plugin is misleading as the code is now using fs.appendFile instead of fs.writeFile.  This means that if I pass false for the append option (or don't specify it at all) and the file I provide exists, the file is still going to be appended, however, since the appended code will include the var statement, it will act the same as if the file was overridden, but have useless code at the top of it.  Is there any reason to believe someone would want to have an existing routes file overridden versus always appending to it if it exists?  The only thing I could think of is if they don't clear their build output directory and the routes files from a previous build still exists when running the next build.\n. @gakimball sure, I don't mind working on those plugin changes\n. Implements #513\n. @gakimball After playing around with this feature I feel there needs to be a way to configure the directives to allow changing of the threshold and velocity values passed to Hammer.  There are a couple of ways this can be achieved.  First off, default settings should be configured via a provider, not hard coded in the directive, to allow application wide overrides for the swipe directives.  Fine tuning specific uses of the swipe directives can be done via element attributes (zf-swipe-threshold and zf-swipe-velocity).  In both cases, I'm thinking there needs to be some abstraction so that users don't need to know the exact values to pass to Hammer.  For instance we could allow passing of values slow, normal, and fast for zf-swipe-velocity, which are converted to Hammer values under the hood (similar to how Motion UI abstracts the exact values used in the CSS animations).  Similarly to express distance, we could use short, normal, and far for zf-swipe-threshold.  Both the provider and attribute solutions should allow passing of numerical values that get directly passed to Hammer, in the event the named options don't fit a developer's needs.  The provider can also allow a developer to change the meaning of the string values or add their own.  This way I can change slow, normal and fast to fit the needs of my application as well as add super slow and super fast as additional options.\nI'll work on the updates above once an interface has been agreed upon.\n. @gakimball Sorry to be a pest, but any thoughts on this feature?  I'd like to finalize the PR so it can be in an upcoming release.\n. @gakimball I wasn't trying to get it into the next release, just something in the future like 1.2 or 1.3.  Do you or your team already have something in mind for this type of feature or can I take it further and implement the things I noted above?\n. @gakimball sounds good, thanks!\n. @gakimball any feedback on this?  I'll implement my ideas above for you and your team to review when you find the time\n. I know you guys are working on 1.1.1 right now so no rush, but when you find the time please provide some feedback on this PR so we can get it stabilized for 1.2.  The code is stable, but the exact values to use for named distances and named velocities need some work (if in fact that ends up being the way the swipe directives are configured).\n. @gakimball Won't this solution still have an issue if trying to use enter/leave/move all on the same element?\n. @gakimball Yes the concern is getting move, enter, and leave all to work on a single element with ng-repeat.  As an example, I want the following behavior to be achievable:\n1. slideInLeft, which will animate enter\n2. slideOutRight, which will animate leave\n3. slideMoveUp (or w/e you want to call it), which will animate move\n. @gakimball Hmm, I think slide and fade for sure.  Hinge might be a neat effect and possibly zoom.  Spin might work also, but would probably get annoying.  Is your worry the size of the CSS file?  If so, could you make the output of the classes be based on scss variables in the _settings.scss file?  This way you can only output what you need in your app.\n. +1 for the overlayClose change.\nThe code needs to be updated to allow passing false for that value.  The if statement should change from:\njs\nif(config[prop]) {\n  ...\n}\nto:\njs\nif(!angular.isUndefined(config[prop])) {\n  ...\n}\n. @foobarth Couldn't you just change the code you added to this:\njs\nelement.attr('overlay-close', config[prop] ? 'true' : 'false');\n. A similar change will be needed for #571 as it should not add the dialog class if the config value is false\n. @mkrakowski thanks for the tip!  Luckily I had control over the module I was using so I could change the state references to use data.authRequired instead. BTW, in order to get it working I had to use the following notation in my front matter:\n```\nname: app.search\nurl: /search\ncontroller: SearchCtrl\ndata: { authRequired: true }\n\n```\n. +1\n. @gakimball I would prefer to have the same grid size classes as it would make it easier to work with panel <--> block transforms\n. perhaps you could just provide a mixin for the ability to add grid size classes for panels and require those mixins to be used if you want the functionality?\n. I was going to write up another PR for a068352b59e8549152ca4bbeedce8be03e60fd51, however, a fix was required in this PR to get the changes working so I figured I would just combine them.  The latest change adds the ability to provide dynamic icon attributes.  Here's an example of its usage:\n``` js\n$scope.actions = [{\n  icon: 'account',\n  iconAttrs: {\n    state: 'login'\n  }\n},{\n  icon: 'account',\n  iconAttrs: {\n    state: 'logout'\n  }\n},{\n  icon: 'chevron',\n  iconAttrs: {\n    direction: 'right'\n  }\n},{\n  icon: 'chevron',\n  iconAttrs: {\n    direction: 'left'\n  }\n}];\n// this is just to showcase the dynamic icons working, though a more common case would\n// have some trigger which changes the icon (e.g. once you logout, switch icon to login)\nvar actionNum = 0;\n$scope.action = $scope.actions[0];\n$scope.updateAction = function() {\n  $timeout(function() {\n    actionNum++;\n    if (actionNum == $scope.actions.length) {\n      actionNum = 0;\n    }\n    $scope.action = $scope.actions[actionNum];\n    $scope.updateAction();\n  },3000);\n};\n$scope.updateAction();\n```\nNow you can use a dynamically updating icon in your view!\nhtml\n<img zf-iconic=\"\" dyn-icon=\"action.icon\" dyn-icon-attrs=\"action.iconAttrs\"></img>\nThis also works for static icons as shown below (though it would probably make more sense just use to use appropriate 'data-' classes specific to the icon in this case).\nhtml\n<img zf-iconic=\"\" icon=\"chevron\" icon-attrs=\"{ 'direction': 'left' }\"></img>\nIf you have a static icon, but still want to use the scope to store your icon info, you could also do this:\nhtml\n<img zf-iconic=\"\" icon=\"{{ action.icon }}\" icon-attrs=\"{{ action.iconAttrs }}\"></img>\nWhile dyn-icon and dyn-icon-attrs would work in the above case, if you know your icon will never change, the above method is preferred as using dyn-* will cause watchers to be set up, which are not needed if the icon never changes.\n. @gakimball Sure no problem, I'll knock that out right now!\n. Yeah I'm fine dropping the first example\n. @gakimball after thinking it over, I think there is an issue with #561 in that it would overwrite any existing classes on the element.  Perhaps switch the config['class'] prop from being a string to being an array of strings and add all classes provided versus just overwriting the class attribute.\n. @gakimball Sure no problem\n. Still familiarizing myself with git, but I think I did that correctly\n. Just noticed I messed up the merge for the switch statement, fixing now\n. Yeah, tested after merging and works greats.  Docs might need a little cleanup, but framework functionality is good.\n. Any update on this?\n. @gakimball I'm going to look into fixing this issue today, so if you could provide any feedback that would be helpful.\nThe whole reason I had to implement what is now the zf-advise feature was due to this issue. I use the zf-advise directive to track the active state of the panel and apply various CSS to the parent containers of the panel when it is open/opening/closing/closed.  I'm basically trying to achieve what the panel grid block should be giving me when it is working properly.\n. @gakimball Yes this is for a vertical grid.  The intended behavior is what I'm after, however, the grid system experiences this bug only when inside a modal.  Let me find a smaller example to showcase my issue.\n. @gakimball Here's a smaller example:\nhtml\n<div class=\"grid-block vertical\">\n  <div class=\"grid-content shrink text-center\">\n    <h2>Modal Header</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"grid-block vertical\">\n    <div class=\"grid-block shrink\" ng-repeat=\"x in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13]\">\n      <div class=\"grid-content\">\n        <p>Content {{ x }}</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"grid-content shrink text-center\">\n    <a class=\"button primary\">Next</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\nUsing the above modal template along with ModalFactory, the middle .grid-block.vertical element is not scrollable as expected.\n. @gakimball Using the exact markup you provided does not work as expected.  Have you tried doing this inside a modal?  All examples I've tried which have scrollable grid elements work as expected on a basic page, but not when inside a modal.\nI think I may have found the issue.  The two root elements for a modal are shown below:\nhtml\n<div class=\"modal-overlay\" ...>\n  <aside class=\"modal\" ...>\n  </aside>\n</div>\nThe modal class provides the flex styling as flex: 0 0 auto, however, the aside element is styled to be display: block.  Since the element is being displayed as a block, it is not respecting the flex styling.  If I add the following css, the scrolling behavior works as expected:\ncss\naside.modal {\n  display: flex;\n}\n. @gakimball do you think my proposed change to add display: flex to the modal class is acceptable?  I made the change locally in the framework and noticed the example modals in the docs were then being displayed as a horizontal grid.  I'm not sure if there is a non-breaking change that can be made to fix this issue, though if there is please let me know.\n. This hasn't been addressed yet. You'll have to apply the fix yourself with CSS.\n. @gakimball I believe the design of the library doesn't really matter so long as there is a standard API. Integrating the library into angular, react or anything else would be the same has having to integrate a JS library like hammer, iconic or any others that F4A uses. Not everything would need to be converted to pure JS. Some features like tabs don't really make sense to convert the JS code since most of it is framework dependent. The styling would be provided by the SCSS library and animations with the motion UI module.\n. @philippeluickx I recently had to do this with my own project when incorporating Prism.  My build is more complex than the one that ships with F4A, however, I took the relevant parts related to copying 3rd party CSS and pasted them below.  No guarantee the code works as is, but should give you enough info to do the same in your project.\nFirst I added a new variable to hold raw CSS files like so:\njs\nvar appCss = [\n    './bower_components/prism/themes/prism.css',\n    './bower_components/prism/plugins/line-numbers/prism-line-numbers.css',\n    './bower_components/prism/plugins/line-highlight/prism-line-highlight.css'\n];\nThen I used this new variable in a separate gulp task:\njs\ngulp.task('css', function() {\n  return gulp.src(appCss)\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/assets/css/'));\n});\nFinally I added the new task to be run as part of the existing build task:\njs\ngulp.task('build', function() {\n  runSequence('clean', 'jshint', ['copy', 'sass', 'css', 'uglify'], 'copy-templates', function() {\n    console.log(\"Successfully built.\");\n  })\n});\nThe above does not combine the 3rd party css into the app.css file generated by the sass task.  As such, you'll need to explicitly include the 3rd party css in your index.html file.  You could easily rewrite the gulp task that combines the app.css with your 3rd party css so you only need to have a single css file referenced in your index.html.  If you did do this, you would have to make sure to run the css task AFTER the sass task, which could easily be done by changing the location of the css task in the runSequence call like so:\njs\ngulp.task('build', function() {\n  runSequence('clean', 'jshint', ['copy', 'sass', 'uglify'], 'css', 'copy-templates', function() {\n    console.log(\"Successfully built.\");\n  })\n});\n. I'm having the same issue with the tabs directive.  A similar issue was observed with the zf-iconic directive (#569) and was resolved with change cce52b4aef7b49ac9d07ff60c85d700ce4fe6af8.  I'm seeing the same root cause in that the directives are not copied to the element, though I'm not sure if it's the same issue.  I think the problem revolves around the usage of transclude in the tabs.  I think a solution similar to the one I used for developing the interchange directives might be needed (https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/pull/549/files).  I'll play around with it for awhile and see what I can figure out.\n. The tabs are transclusion hell!  The attribute issue was part, but not the whole story.  The root problem is that all tab trancludes are done during the post link operation on the element.  The post link of an element occurs after all children elements have been post linked.  What this means is, any directives within a tab are being run before the raw content is transcluded into the tab causing angular to be unaware that a directive exists within the tab.\nAs I mentioned, transferring attributes is another issue with the tabs. This can be fixed similar to cce52b4aef7b49ac9d07ff60c85d700ce4fe6af8, however, it must be noted that if directives are used on the same element as the zf-tab directive, the zf-tab directive will need to be recompiled after copying the attributes.  If the directives are used in children of the zf-tab directive, no recompile will needed as children directives will be compiled after the zf-tab directive once the tab directives are fixed to transclude the correct data.\n. this issue with be addressed with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/24\n. My app uses the ModalFactory to create a modal on the fly when a new level is started.  The modal is opened and closed programmatically as you progress through the level and finally destroyed once the level is completed.  While developing the app I noticed cases when the modal was not being opened or closed when specified.  This fix solves those issues and I haven't experienced any issues since implementing this fix.\n. The answer you're looking for is the $stateParams service.  The link should give you all the info you need regarding how to use the params.\nIn your example, the id would be accessible via $stateParams.id.  I don't believe the front matter provides a way to access the state params in your scope without wiring it through a controller.  I've seen others speak of a DefaultController which can be extended to add custom behavior, however, if I ever need any specific behavior from my controller I write my own versus extending the DefaultController provided by F4A, so you'd have to get info on how to do that from someone else.\nIn short, here is the code you'll need:\nFront Matter:\n```\nname: inbox.message\nurl: inbox/:id\ncontroller: InboxController\n\n```\nController:\njs\nangular.module('application').controller('InboxController', \n  ['$scope', '$stateParams', function($scope, $stateParams) {\n    $scope.msgId = $stateParams.id;\n  }]\n);\nView:\nhtml\nYou're viewing message with id: {{ msgId }}\n. This was fixed with e70eff2d17a5de409e4a58d259c7c8a7e076ee7e.  It'll be in the next release.\n. Posted PR from wrong repo, will close and reopen\n. @imjoeco I noticed you closed this PR but do agree with using $timeout instead of setTimeout.  Should I make those changes in my PR?\n. @imjoeco I combined your changes into #640\n. I included the changes from this PR in #640 when #644 was closed without realizing @imjoeco was planning to open a new PR with the same changes.  I can revert d37786b1c8f39b173f5ef3ef89f3a1bff7b23d7d so that this PR can be merged or you can just accept both PRs as is though this PR has the same changes as d37786b1c8f39b173f5ef3ef89f3a1bff7b23d7d.  \n@gakimball Let me know how you want to handle it.\n. @Joe-5mith Have you tried using the ModalFactory (http://foundation.zurb.com/apps/docs/#!/angular-modules)?  If so, are there some feature you're looking for that it's missing?  I use it for all my dynamically generated modals and it seems to work great (some issues aside which are being tracked).\n. @Joe-5mith You can create an angular service to encapsulate the logic for generating a modal (an angular factory would work as well)\n``` javascript\nangular.module('mymodule').factory('ModalService', function (ModalFactory) {\n    return {\n      createModalXYZ: createModalXYZ\n    };\nfunction createModalXYZ() {\n      return new ModalFactory({\n          ...\n      });\n    }\n});\n```\nThere are some pending changes for modals that are waiting for the next release of the framework.  One such change was how to configure the classes for a modal pragmatically.  An example was added to the docs for how to use the ModalFactory (https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/blob/master/docs/templates/modal.html).  The class config property will be available in the next release.\n. Do you have a specific use case?  Not sure if this will help, but you can also attach functions to the modal scope via the contentScope property.  So if you need to do something with the click of a button, you can have the following:\njavascript\n$scope.foo = \"Bloop!\";\n$scope.bar = \"Blee!\";\nvar config = {\n    id: 'your optional id here',\n    templateUrl: 'path/to/template',\n    contentScope: {\n        foo: $scope.foo,\n        bar: $scope.bar,\n        clicked: function() {\n          // do something with foo and bar\n        }\n    },\n    animationIn: 'slideInFromTop'\n}\n$scope.modal = new ModalFactory(config);\nIn your template you can use ng-click=\"clicked()\" to trigger the scope method on the click of the button.\n. @zurbchris @valorekhov \nI'm going to add similar functionality to the zf-panel directive.  I'll add it to other directives that would benefit with this change including the zf-accordion-item.\n. I've implemented PR #740 to handle triggering active state messages for components that use the foundation sub/pub system to show/hide components.  Accordions and Tabs do not use the foundation sub/pub system to handle changing active state of elements.  In these cases, two-way binding of scope.active would have to be used to be notified of active state changes.  The two-way bound value should be readonly until support is added to the Accordion and Tabs to allow changing active state outside of the directive.\n. BTW in terms of #536, here is a case where using the angular pub/sub would help as it also allows passing data, so we could just fire one event in the promise.finally block and pass along the success/error info instead of having to fire specific events for success/error\n. I made the changes necessary for my app in my forked repo: 84fe2e23ece29aa5a90283961af3f609d7b5210a\nI realized that having a success/error for each action wasn't going to really help me do what I needed.  Instead what I was really after was knowing the active state of an element once the animation was complete on that element.  So I instead added two new messages active-true and active-false which are sent once the open/show animation is complete or the close/hide animation is complete, respectively.  Let me know if you want me to work on a PR for integration of these changes.\n. this will be addressed with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/25\n. Feel free to submit this PR against the new fork\n. Turns out there was just a bug in my code :/\n. For what it's worth, I've been using F4A with angular 1.4.x in production code for a few months now.  There were a couple problems I had to address in my own code due upgrading angular, but no issues were found in F4A.\n. @kuatsure I use nearly every part of the F4A framework.  It should also be noted that I run a custom build of the framework (https://github.com/fiboacademy/foundation-apps/tree/fibo-master).  Some of my fixes/features have made there way into the F4A master and some haven't.  The forked repo is set to angular 1.4.4, however, my build system is set to use angular 1.4.7 and I haven't noticed any issues.\n. @gakimball that would be best\n. I was able to reproduce this issue in my app using the same markup as in the docs <input type=\"range\"/>.  This issue is intermittent as it works sometimes in my app, but more often than not the slider gets stuck and requires refreshing the browser.\n. Appears to be due to another library I'm using not handling mouse events correctly\n. I should mention that if run with angular support enabled, the need for the global variable foundationRoutes is removed.  Backwards compatibility is also maintained as angular support is disabled by default.\n. Yes I can get to that at some point\nOn Fri, Dec 4, 2015 at 1:35 PM, Geoff Kimball notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n@soumak77 https://github.com/soumak77 Thanks for putting this together\n:) Could you apply these features to the external Front Router plugin\nhttps://github.com/zurb/front-router as well? We won't be dropping the\nbuilt-in plugin until after 1.2, but new projects are referencing the\nexternal plugin.\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\nhttps://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/pull/704#issuecomment-162088077.\n. I should mention that the optimized css worked on Chrome and Safari for OS X 1.9.5, but did not work for Chrome and Safari for iOS 8.3\n. I started using foundation from the beginning and really love what they did.  I was in the early stages of my company when I decided to go with foundation for apps and now all my apps run on this framework.  It is unfortunate to see the lack of support at this time, however, I foresee being able to do some amazing things with this framework in the future.  Seeing as I am reliant on the framework to maintain my business, I created a fork where I make necessary updates to the framework to support my needs.  Most of these changes I'm hoping to get merged into foundation for apps once the project picks back up.  Some of which are pending PRs.\n\nWhile it may not be a viable option to use my forked repo in production, you can try it out by adding the following to your bower file:\n\"foundation-apps\": \"git@github.com:fiboacademy/foundation-apps#fibo-master\"\nThe fork should be a drop-in replacement with no additional configuration needed, though you will need to build from source.\n. I would love to see the following changes in 1.2.  I've been using all these changes in production code for the past 6+ months.  All changes to exposed APIs are backwards compatible:\n- PR #549 - Interchange Directives\n  - FoundationMQ service changes\n    - The changes I've made to the FoundationMQ service have proven to be quite useful so that I can perform media queries in code as shown below.  The methods use named queries so to allow user defined values.\n      - FoundationMQ.matchesMediaOnly(\"small\"); // checks if device is small only\n      - FoundationMQ.matchesMedia(\"medium\"); // checks if device is medium or higher\n  - Interchange Directives\n    - I absolutely love how these directives work.  It makes it so simple to tag an element with a specific media query.  It also removes the need for additional DOM elements as is required by the current interchange mechanism zf-interchange.\n- PR #730 - Animation Promises \n  - Changes allow chaining animations so they can be performed one after another.  The changes use the $q service to handle the promises.\n- PR #704 - Add angular support and multiple runs to dynamic routing gulp plugin\n  - Allows dynamic routing module to be run multiple times by appending to the routes file if it already exists.  File will be created if it doesn't already exist.\n  - Removes the dependency on the global variable foundationRoutes when angular support is enabled.  Uses the angular.module('foundation.dynamicRouting').config() method to add routes.\nThose have proven to be the most useful changes I've made to the framework.  While I think PR #551 (Swipe Directives) is a really promising feature, there is much work to do still to get it working flawlessly, so I wouldn't suggest merging the PR for 1.2. I don't currently use those directives in production code, though I will need to for a product I have to release by September, so by then I'll have all the kinks worked out.\n. @gakimball There aren't any critical bugs that I've seen that I haven't already fixed myself in the framework.  I think for the most part I've created PRs for things I've fixed in the framework along the way.  I'll go through the changes I've committed to my company's forked repo of F4A that we use in production and reply shortly with the changes that haven't made it into the F4A master yet.\n. These are the only two bug fixes I've made that aren't yet in the framework:\n- Check for null scope during SVG injection\n  - https://github.com/fiboacademy/foundation-apps/commit/2acffdc845e4f662c04fa2ad1a0e6f8290e66a4b\n- Check scope and element during modal destroy\n  - https://github.com/fiboacademy/foundation-apps/commit/d6273a97ef299b8600cbe4f5db237aec19620761\n  - there was a discussion as to whether or not these checks were needed when https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/pull/645 was merged and it was determined they were not, however, in practice, I've found they are needed\n. In terms of existing issues, it would be nice to see the following resolved:\n- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/430\n  - This is specific for off-canvas, though I've found it would be useful for panels as well.  I simply add the necessary click handlers to other elements in the app so clicking on them cause the panel/off-canvas to close, but it would be nice to see an integrated option so I don't have to worry about which exact elements need the click handlers.  I would like to be able to simply flag the off-canvas/panel component as needing to close when clicked outside.\n- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/484\n  - It would be nice to remove my dependency on Modernizr as I'm only using it for F4A support detection.\n- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/578\n  - This is easily solved by adding one line of css in my app, though a solution via a framework css class would be nice\n- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/672\n  - This one is just plain annoying\n- https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/699\n  - I had to remove all range sliders in my app due to this issue.  Still can't figure out what exactly is happening.\n- #572 \n  - I ended up getting the functionality I needed, but my solution is a hack at best.\n. @zurbchris Please disregard my comments about that change.  The head of my repo has the same code for modal destroy as F4A master and I haven't experienced any issues.\n. I would like to see https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/572 resolved at some point as well.  I ended up getting the functionality I needed, but my solution is a hack at best.\n. This PR didn't get created correctly. I'll create a new branch with the isolated changes.\n. There is one key feature to this PR that I should explain and that is the FoundationApi.animateAndNotify method.  This method internally calls FoundationApi.animate, which has been updated in this PR to return a promise.  animateAndNotify waits on the promise to be completed and then fires off a notification via FoundationApi.publish stating whether the component was just activated or deactivated.  \nFoundationApi.animateAndNotify is not used in the foundation codebase as of this PR.  In my fork, I have replaced all usage of FoundationApi.animate in the panels component with FoundationApi.animateAndNotify.  This allows me to perform code immediately after the panel has closed or immediately after the panel has opened.\nSince FoundationApi.animateAndNotify is not used in this PR, it could be removed from the API, however, I would not only suggest keeping the method, but would suggest using it in place of FoundationApi.animate for various components (panels being one example).\n. addresses https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/674\n. @zurbchris do you plan on adding the anitmateAndNotify to any components so they can alert subscribers when the component has fully opened or fully closed? Perhaps an additional attribute can be added to the directive so these new messages only get sent when enabled.\n. Awesome!  Not sure what else you have planned for this feature, but feel free to change anything I've done to better suit the framework.\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. This has been resolved for ui-sref elements in PR https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/pull/736 with change https://github.com/fiboacademy/foundation-apps/commit/8922ec4215c5340bb5b3c8b64a904cb308b01d51.  I'll update the code to check if click originated within an element that has an href tag.\n. The specific code that needs to be updated is https://github.com/fiboacademy/foundation-apps/blob/8922ec4215c5340bb5b3c8b64a904cb308b01d51/js/angular/components/common/common.js#L208-L211\nRight now it doesn't call event.preventDefault() if the click originated within an element with ui-sref.  I'll change that to a list of attributes with ui-sref and href.  What other attributes should be added to the list to resolve your issue?\n. @zurbchris @gakimball \nLet me know your thoughts on this.  I'll be making these changes in my fork.  I can get a PR submitted today if you provide feedback.\n. I know both show/hide and open/close are used in messages, but which is the preferred standard so the animation messages can use those values?\n. I made this comment on #670, but should include it here for completeness:\nAccordions and Tabs do not use the foundation sub/pub system to handle changing active state of elements. In these cases, two-way binding of scope.active would have to be used to be notified of active state changes. The two-way bound value should be readonly until support is added to the Accordion and Tabs to support changing to active state outside of the directive.\n. this has been completed in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. Changes allow grid-block panels to animate properly.  Also adds supports for a force-animation attribute on the panel directive (when provided, allows animations to run on large devices).\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. @gakimball\nHow heavily is jQuery used in foundation for sites?  Is it unthinkable to try to remove that dependency?\nFrom an architecture standpoint, you shouldn't be writing core functionality in angular.  Any components shared between F4S and F4A should be part of a shared core framework.  This core framework should be javascript only with minimal dependencies.  This will enable the framework to be used by ANY javascript framework and not just F4S and F4A (#587).\nF4A is already in a predicament with angular in that angular 2.0 is stated to not be backwards compatible with angular 1.0.  A ton of effort will need to be spent migrating the code to work with angular 2.0, so rather than making EVERYTHING angular, now would be a great time to figure out which code is not angular dependent and put that into the core JS framework.  The core JS framework can then be wrapped by F4A to provide an angular solution and wrapped by F4S to provide a jQuery solution.  The core JS framework can also be wrapped by others to provide similar functionality for other common web frameworks.\n. You can do something similar to angular 1.0 (likely the same in 2.0, but haven't looked into it), where they use jqLite and allow for dropping in your own implementation if needed. This allows angular to work with jQuery without having to change any internal functionality as the drop in replacement (jQuery) is a superset of the required framework (jqLite). So if you want to use this new foundation core JS in angular, you could drop in angular.element and the framework should work. You can also drop in jQuery when using it for F4S and it should work as well.\nI don't think there is a major issue here so long as the core JS is properly wrapped. So for instance with angular, you'll still want to use directives as much as possible as they are extremely powerful, but you'll need to ensure $scope.digest or $scope.apply is called in the correct locations after DOM manipulation is done via the core JS framework so the directive (and other scopes) reflect the changes.\n. @gakimball @zurbchris \nHere's an interesting article on Angular 2 I found that relates directly to this conversation.  I would suggest reading the entire article as it mentions some good points you'll want to keep in mind when developing a plain JS UI framework.  Here are some snippets:\n2.3.6 jqLite\njQuery has been supported in Angular since day one. That support isn't going away, but Angular will no longer include it's own miniature version (jqLite). It's also in line with how Angular prefers declarative over imperative (as discussed in 2.1.2).\n2.1.2 Controllers, providers, and directives\nOne of the most common use cases in web development is creating custom pieces of elements on a page, like tabs or buttons with spinners in them. Today the web lacks a good way to separate concerns and easily manipulate the DOM. While things are on their way (see section 2.2) we've had the need for some time.\njQuery is great for controlling the DOM in a direct way. We call that an imperative model. To help developers transition to Angular it has supported that way of thinking. But Angular has at the same time tried to give us a more declarative model where we're more concerned with what, rather than how. Data binding is probably the most notable of these features as we can just use our JS data in the HTML, rather than grabbing the element and pushing in the value ourselves.\n. Feel free to submit this PR against the new fork\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. This was incorrectly reported.  I had the markup within a form that was not tagged as grid-block, causing issues on iOS.\n. I believe this is addressed with PR https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/pull/670, however per my comments, some standardization of how active state is handled should be addressed before making these one off changes.  I'll leave it up to the folks at zurb as to whether or not this advice is taken into consideration.\n. Correct, adding optional two way binding would require checking if the active attribute was set on the element. If so, the code does not need to set scope.active as the initial value was provided by the user. If the active attribute is not set, the code would have to set scope.active = false by default as the active property on the scope will not exist since it was not provided by the user.\n. this will be addressed with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/25\n. this issue with be addressed with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/24\n. @rafibomb I was thinking you could adjust the padding to account for the 1 px border, however, this is a bit complicated by how foundation uses the button padding\n``` sass\n$button-padding: 0.85em 1em !default;\n%button {\n   padding: $button-padding;\n   ...\n}\n```\nThe $button-padding variable allows css shorthand format to be used, thus the value must be parsed to figure out exactly what padding the user has configured for each side.  I found an example of how css shorthand can be parsed in SASS: https://gist.github.com/pixelwhip/8428447\nOnce the individual padding values are known for each side, the calc() method can be used to adjust the padding by 1px.\nsass\n@mixin button-style(...) {\n  @if $style == hollow {\n    border: 1px solid $background;\n    padding-top: calc(#{$button-padding-top} - 1px);\n    padding-right: calc(#{$button-padding-right} - 1px);\n    padding-bottom: calc(#{$button-padding-bottom} - 1px);\n    padding-left: calc(#{$button-padding-left} - 1px);\n    ...\n}\n. Perhaps I should have just scrolled a bit lower in the file before writing my comment.  Seems there already exists a method for getting the value for a specific side get-side($padding, right)\n. @MiguelMike @rafibomb fixed!\n. will replace with new PR\n. this issue with be addressed with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/24\n. Feel free to contribute to the documentation in the new fork\n. @mattgrande I'm not sure if it would help, but I made some changes to how zf-advise works in the framework (https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/pull/741).  I've only ever needed to use zf-advise for panels, not modals, so these changes may not fix your issue.\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. ZURB has basically dropped support for this framework and it is now being maintained by the community as https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps.\nI've gone through the entire codebase and wrote an unsubscribed method for every subscribe method.  Feel free to run the same analytics against v1.2.5 and create issues as needed.\n. this issue with be addressed with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/24\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. Feel free to submit this PR against the new fork\n. It's unfortunate this framework isn't receiving the attention it needs.  My company is heavily invested in Foundation 4 Apps and there is no way of switching away from it. Because of this, I've had to take the initiative of fixing framework related issues myself. A large number of these fixes have been sitting in PRs for months.\nIn order to release quality apps, I've had to use a fork of this framework where I can make necessary fixes. That fork is https://github.com/fiboacademy/foundation-apps/tree/fibo-master.  I've been using the framework in production for over a year and really love it, just wish I didn't have to maintain the framework myself.\n. From what I've heard, they are working on a V2 which will integrate with Angular 2 and share styling from Foundation for Sites 6 as @DaSchTour stated.  I completely agree with the approach, but that doesn't mean to abandon V1.  For those like me that are using V1 in production code, it is important that bug fixes are still made to the framework (especially when some of these fixes are already done and just waiting to be merged).\n. Sounds like it's time for the community to take it over?  I'm heavily reliant on the framework and can't give it up, so I'll need to maintain it myself anyway.  The framework is pretty solid for what its worth (after all the bug fixes I've made).\n. I'm all for getting the process started on migrating this framework away from ZURB.  If we're going to maintain an open source version, I wouldn't mind taking that over.  I'm actively working on apps which fully depend on the framework, so I would love to see it get the attention it needs.\nI've been maintaining my own custom build of the framework which is used in all apps I develop at Fibo.  These apps have been running in production for over a year and a half, so I trust this build of the framework far more than the current state of the foundation apps master.  As such, I would highly suggest using this build as the base for the framework going forward.\nIn terms of org, we could use the FiboAcademy organization where I maintain my custom build and apps.  I'm fine with whatever name is chosen, though perhaps something with angular would be appropriate, maybe angular-apps.  I'm not too keen on changing the naming convention from zf to something else.  It would be a real pain for those of us trying to migrate to the new framework.  It would also be annoying for those that start using foundation apps thinking it is still being maintained, then find this new open source version that requires them to change all the code they wrote.  I think a drop in replacement for 1.2 (or as close to it as possible) should be the first version of this new framework.\n. @AntJanus I've fine with a new org, though foundation (or whatever the next iteration becomes) will never be moved away from in the FiboAcademy org.  I've spent the last year and a half building out a custom angular suite on top of foundation which integrates with our backend infrastructure.  All business operations apps have been fully switched over to the new framework as of a couple months ago, so trying to reverse that or go in a different direction would be a vast waste of resources.\n. The fibo-apps framework is in a private repo. You were just looking at the custom build of foundation which is foundation with my pending PRs accepted.\nAs for name, I'd prefer base over open.\n. What about angular-base?\n. I was specifically just speaking for the fork name which should always stay angular.  Perhaps something like base-apps as you suggested would work for the naming of the org and angular-base for the fork.  Foundation for Apps is really just a styling framework at it's core, so I see your point in thinking about other front end frameworks.  We could use the same convention of -base for other frameworks like react-base and ember-base.\n. It would be a good idea to continue with the decoupling of the framework that was started with https://github.com/zurb/front-router and https://github.com/zurb/motion-ui.  This would help move in the direction of enabling other front end frameworks, though angular should be the primary focus for now.\n. If architected properly, the thing that would set this new framework apart from Angular Material, and others, is to enable cross-framework integration.  This way the framework just supports styling and can be leveraged by any javascript framework.  If framework specific logic is needed to power the library, which in most cases it will, a *-base repo can be created which provides the integration.\n. The majority of the issues with this framework have been resolved as of v1.2.5 from https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. Similar to https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/804\n. will replace with corrected PR\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. fix has been made in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps\n. The modal overlay close triggers the deactivate method to be called on the modal which simply hide the modal.  You'll need to call destroy to have the modal removed from the DOM.  If you give your modal a hard-coded ID, you can then subscribe to messages for the modal.  When you get the close message, call modal.destroy() like in the examples.\nBy the way, this repo has been dead for awhile and is now being maintained in https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps.  If you want, you can create a PR to introduce the concept of overlayDestroy.  Similar to overlayClose, it would cause the modal to close when clicking on the overlay, however, once the animation is completed, the modal would be destroyed.\n. @cisdev739 I added a destroy-on-close attribute for modals with https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps/issues/16.  It will be part of the 1.3 release.\n. Feel free to submit this PR against the new fork\n. @HuemanF I believe this is simply due to how the SCSS is structured.  The resulting behavior for grid-block (flex-flow: row nowrap) is intended.  If you wish to have flex-flow: row wrap, you can use the wrap class in combination with the grid-block class.  You can review the docs for grid-block to get a better understand of the functionality.\nZURB has basically dropped support for this framework and it is now being maintained by the community as https://github.com/base-apps/angular-base-apps.\n. ZURB has unofficially dropped support for this framework and it is now being maintained by the community.  The docs can be found here: https://base-apps.github.io/angular-base-apps\n. @Seb- Yes the fork is production ready.  I use it for all apps in my company.  I even have them running the v2.0 prerelease without issues.\n. @kobekoto I suggest trying out Angular Base Apps if you want to use this framework (see https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues/829 for more info)\n.

Note the MinGW, which I am running rather than cygwin, on basis of sorting out another one of these layered tool  problems. I suspect the difference in recognizing executables might be at that level, the pseudo-OS, rather than Ruby. Why that Ruby?

Perils of Pauline for anyone who tries.\nThen, as above, I'd rather adapt within your Zurb scripts to handle the permuted combinations of pseudo-OS and Ruby arrangements. Just looking for what you need, like an executable name for bundle. It seems likely the most fun and least trouble, and may be thought to be more stable also as the other packages aren't likely to change their ways of working, while swapping out packages as Zurb has been doing on the main Foundation line almost guarantees user shock and troubles, no?\np.s. if you did it the adaptive way, the proposed stability of the individual package layer calling conventions might say you could just make a table of the relevant ways to call, based on the environment of  systems. That way you can do what  I did and try things from shell within the environment to discover what's accepted, thus wouldn't have to have seeking code within your script library.

Having used other angular UI modules, its indeed not very intuitive needing a foundationApi service is for component specific actions.

Well, you could still dependency inject the central service into each component service and keep the way components talk to each other.

So if I read this right this will allow you to dynamically create a modal and let the calling code open and close the modal.

One way of allowing that to happen is setting deactivate function on the scope before linking the modal. This way I can call `$scope.deactivate() inside the modal.\n.

You can do this by having the activate() function return a promise and have the dismiss(result) function take one parameter that resolves that promise.\n. If I had to select my favourite color inside the modal I need a way of returning it to the calling code.\n.

But you could also do what is suggested under the 'A Note on Minification' section at https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_05\n. You can only inject providers in the config function. Inject it to a controller or run function.\n. It may be worth placing the sniffing code elsewhere as not everyone will use foundation's app.js.\n.

Only ones outstanding is interchange and typeahead. Typeahead was never implemented in the original foundation and interchange should not be big deal. I ported angular-foundation for use in bookem.co.za. I've been running it in production for the last 2 weeks with only minor issues thats now been fixed.\n\nIf you are looking for another framework, angular-bootstrap (https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) is quite solid.

I'd try to stay away from creating *.services, *.factories, *.*-ies modules, tbh\n*.core says a bit more and all the core services can be a part of this module.\n. don't merge it into master yet :-)\n. hehe - we're here to help, if you need some ;-)\ngoing over the code - good transfer, but still way to go - esp in the controllers-land ;-)\n. that calls for minor bump, at least ;-)\n. can't find the issue, @japhar81 - will check out later :)\n. @japhar81 it seems that the issue you're having is related to mqInit.init(); call - this fails, not your tests :-)\n. Hm, did you try using the $animate service directly?\nLooks to me like $animate.addClass,  $animate.removeClass and $animate.setClass would solve most of your issues here (even when classes were to be defined dynamically).\nDo you think creating a feature branch would make sense here? We could address your points there and maybe remove the animate service, thus reducing the codebase :-)\nWDYT?\n. it does waaay more than just add/remove class :-)\n. quick question regarding the 'animate' service's timeout\nwhy the 3000? will any animation that goes beyond 3s be cut off @ ~3000ms? :-)\n. i think I've also found a scope leakage (from state to scope)...\n. check out https://github.com/stryju/foundation-apps/commit/96df886cf5d4eb4743d9998df236608487868c20\njust make sure your animations follow addClass naming convention\nsample animation class:\n``` scss\n$duration: 2000ms;\n.getIn-add {\n  position: absolute;\n  transition: 0 all; // instant styles\nopacity: 0;\n  transform: translate3d(0, -50%, 0);\n&.getIn-add-active {\n    transition: $duration cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.250, 0.750, 0.750) all;\nopacity: 1;\ntransform: translate3d(0, 0%, 0);\n\n}\n}\n.getIn {\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n.getOut-add {\n  position: absolute;\n  transition: 0 all; // instant styles\nopacity: 1;\n  transform: translate3d(0, 0%, 0);\n&.getOut-add-active {\n    transition: $duration cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.250, 0.750, 0.750) all;\nopacity: 0;\ntransform: translate3d(0, 50%, 0);\n\n}\n}\n.getOut {\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n```\n. this was just to show that's possible and with fairly little effort. I'd dive a bit deeper and see how we can tackle that so:\n- only states are affected and follow state-defined classes for animations\n- no state data leaks to state\nWDYT?\n\ncurrently, the .[animation]-add and .[animation]-add-active is required only for the \"hacky\" states transition\nthe other animations stay intact\n. also, my point is: we should not duplicate the work that's already been done :)\n. what i mean is that the current solution for state transitions is \"not ideal\"\nthe way i see it, we have two (if not more) options:\n- the proposed one (not ideal either)\n- dig deeper into uiRouter and find a way to add given class to state's element - this will follow normal $animate.enter() behavior, birds will sing, rainbows... you get the picture ;-)\nI just wanted to check if going further makes sense - maybe you had more reasons behind your own \"animate\" solutions\n\nnot a huge fan of the animation solution - I'd go for tighter coupling of ui-view life-cycle and the animations\n. @AntJanus \nand to elaborate on my 2nd bullet-point:\nadd following snippet to any of your \"states\":\nhtml\n{{ vars | json }}\neach state should use it's own \"data\" property, not to pollute the scope (ofc, we need to cater for data's inheritance, but that we can take care of in your \"states builder\")\n. @gakimball I'm aiming for little to no changes in your current styles (maybe a small reduction, if possible)\n. well, to be honest\nng-enter == X-add\nng-enter-active == X-add-active\nX - unique style, that can have it's own additional magic\n\nif bad comes to worse, all you would need to do is to add styles like\nui-view, [ui-view] {\n // -add classes magic\n}\nthis might bloat the output, tho\n. :+1: but if my other solution won't work (and I feel it will)\n. @AntJanus I'm thinking about writing a small directive that would pair with ui-view directive (fa-view?) that would use the given animation classes for given state - WDYT?\n. @gakimball  @AntJanus  we can make \"the hack\" work with -remove - simple change for \"remove\" on custom animation\na \"normal\" timeline of toggling class with $animate:\nadd:\n- (stop, no X class)\n- ng-animate\n- ng-animate X-add (plain added class)\n- ng-animate X-add X-add-active (transition)\n- X (stop, class X added)\nremove:\n- X (stop, X class)\n- X ng-animate\n- X ng-animate X-remove (plain added/removed class)\n- ng-animate X-remove X-remove-active (transition)\n- (stop, class X removed)\n. @davidkpiano I think that you are missing the core concept of the issue at hand :-)\nit's about custom animations for states (each state should have possibility to define it's own animation class for showing and hiding respectivelly) @ ui router - please read the thread first ;-)\n. ok, so here's my take:\nhttps://github.com/stryju/foundation-apps/commit/4ddfbfbeeae27fc9fd5db37098d1b2e7f06ce226\n- dropped the animation\n- augmented the uiView directive\nhttps://github.com/stryju/foundation-apps/commit/5a75a2415e2ea7cdb629bb1712dbc91c5ffa14ea\n- changed the way animations are bound to the state\nso the \"new\" form of animation definitions should look like:\njs\n{\n  url : '/greetings',\n  template : '<h1>hi there</h1>',\n  animation : {\n    enter : 'fadeIn',\n    leave : 'zoomOut'\n  }\n}\nlet me know if that works for you\n. https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/pull/330\n. on the side-note: this repo is in a dire need for tests... big changes require integrity :)\n. any feedback is greatly appreciated :-)\n. ui router uses $animate.enter() and $animate.leave() so no css changes needed, as long as they follow the normal ng-enter / ng-leave structure :)\n. off-topic:\nMaybe it would be a wise idea to make all the angular-related animations a separate module or something?\nAs I understand, there will be different flavors of foundation-apps (react, ember, ...) and having one huge css file with all the flavors of animations (class names and so on) might generate quite an overhead\n. when testing on local foundation-apps instance i didn't come across those issues...\ncan you prepare a small repo / plunker with the code?\n. sorry for heavy gifs - let me know, when i can remove them\n\ntested on chrome, firefox, safari (os x)\n\ntested animation:\n``` scss\n$duration: 2000ms;\n.getIn.ng-enter {\n  transition: $duration cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.250, 0.750, 0.750) all;\nposition: absolute;\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: translate3d(0, -50%, 0);\n&.ng-enter-active {\n    opacity: 1;\n    transform: translate3d(0, 0%, 0);\n  }\n}\n.getOut.ng-leave {\n  transition: $duration cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.250, 0.750, 0.750) all;\nposition: absolute;\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: translate3d(0, 0%, 0);\n&.ng-leave-active {\n    opacity: 0;\n    transform: translate3d(0, 50%, 0);\n  }\n}\n```\n. trying to run docs locally -

it can cause a weird jank on some directives :-)\n. ok, so got the animations up and running - smooth...\nbut the issue is with the animated elements - fadeout leaves some element visible (style override, it seems)\n. \nthat's with manual class toggle...\nadded ng-leave ng-leave-active\n\ncc @gakimball \n. this was a view (and view IS a component :wink:) animation - elements that are left seem to break the animation :-)\ntake a look at the frame with selector on top :-)\n. set the fadeOut animation for motionUi page and observe what happens when transitioning FROM that page (that's the gif I've attached)\nonly text elements don't fade out (weirdly)\n. keep in mind, that the way ui.router's uiView directives work is that it creates a new uiView element BEFORE the current view, like so:\nstate1 idle\nhtml\n<uiView>state1</uiView>\nstate2 loading, state1 unloading\nhtml\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-enter\">state2</uiView>\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-leave\">state1</uiView>\nstate 2 loaded, state1 unloaded\nhtml\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-enter ng-enter-active\">state2</uiView>\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-leave ng-leave-active\">state1</uiView>\nstate 2 idle\nhtml\n<uiView>state2</uiView>\n\nso what you might be referring to is the fact, that the state that's being animated out jumps below the new one, which is not animated - hm?\n. what's more, if transitions take, let's say 1s, and you switch between states 5 times within this 1s, it will create that many ngViews and just let them animate properly\nso, the DOM-situation like this is possible:\nhtml\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-leave ng-leave-active\">state1</uiView>\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-leave ng-leave-active\">state2</uiView>\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-leave ng-leave-active\">state3</uiView>\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-leave ng-leave-active\">state1</uiView>\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-enter ng-enter-active\">state2</uiView> <!-- the state we're finally getting to -->\n. yeah, it is a good thing, but one needs to be aware of that ;-)\n. well, since it's OS, just branch of my branch? :D\n. :+1: \n. sorry, I have not as much time to spare as I'd like to have to spend on this at this time -

I'd try to stay away from creating *.services, *.factories, *.*-ies modules, tbh\n*.core says a bit more and all the core services can be a part of this module.\n. don't merge it into master yet :-)\n. hehe - we're here to help, if you need some ;-)\ngoing over the code - good transfer, but still way to go - esp in the controllers-land ;-)\n. that calls for minor bump, at least ;-)\n. can't find the issue, @japhar81 - will check out later :)\n. @japhar81 it seems that the issue you're having is related to mqInit.init(); call - this fails, not your tests :-)\n. Hm, did you try using the $animate service directly?\nLooks to me like $animate.addClass,  $animate.removeClass and $animate.setClass would solve most of your issues here (even when classes were to be defined dynamically).\nDo you think creating a feature branch would make sense here? We could address your points there and maybe remove the animate service, thus reducing the codebase :-)\nWDYT?\n. it does waaay more than just add/remove class :-)\n. quick question regarding the 'animate' service's timeout\nwhy the 3000? will any animation that goes beyond 3s be cut off @ ~3000ms? :-)\n. i think I've also found a scope leakage (from state to scope)...\n. check out https://github.com/stryju/foundation-apps/commit/96df886cf5d4eb4743d9998df236608487868c20\njust make sure your animations follow addClass naming convention\nsample animation class:\n``` scss\n$duration: 2000ms;\n.getIn-add {\n  position: absolute;\n  transition: 0 all; // instant styles\nopacity: 0;\n  transform: translate3d(0, -50%, 0);\n&.getIn-add-active {\n    transition: $duration cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.250, 0.750, 0.750) all;\nopacity: 1;\ntransform: translate3d(0, 0%, 0);\n\n}\n}\n.getIn {\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n.getOut-add {\n  position: absolute;\n  transition: 0 all; // instant styles\nopacity: 1;\n  transform: translate3d(0, 0%, 0);\n&.getOut-add-active {\n    transition: $duration cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.250, 0.750, 0.750) all;\nopacity: 0;\ntransform: translate3d(0, 50%, 0);\n\n}\n}\n.getOut {\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n```\n. this was just to show that's possible and with fairly little effort. I'd dive a bit deeper and see how we can tackle that so:\n- only states are affected and follow state-defined classes for animations\n- no state data leaks to state\nWDYT?\n\ncurrently, the .[animation]-add and .[animation]-add-active is required only for the \"hacky\" states transition\nthe other animations stay intact\n. also, my point is: we should not duplicate the work that's already been done :)\n. what i mean is that the current solution for state transitions is \"not ideal\"\nthe way i see it, we have two (if not more) options:\n- the proposed one (not ideal either)\n- dig deeper into uiRouter and find a way to add given class to state's element - this will follow normal $animate.enter() behavior, birds will sing, rainbows... you get the picture ;-)\nI just wanted to check if going further makes sense - maybe you had more reasons behind your own \"animate\" solutions\n\nnot a huge fan of the animation solution - I'd go for tighter coupling of ui-view life-cycle and the animations\n. @AntJanus \nand to elaborate on my 2nd bullet-point:\nadd following snippet to any of your \"states\":\nhtml\n{{ vars | json }}\neach state should use it's own \"data\" property, not to pollute the scope (ofc, we need to cater for data's inheritance, but that we can take care of in your \"states builder\")\n. @gakimball I'm aiming for little to no changes in your current styles (maybe a small reduction, if possible)\n. well, to be honest\nng-enter == X-add\nng-enter-active == X-add-active\nX - unique style, that can have it's own additional magic\n\nif bad comes to worse, all you would need to do is to add styles like\nui-view, [ui-view] {\n // -add classes magic\n}\nthis might bloat the output, tho\n. :+1: but if my other solution won't work (and I feel it will)\n. @AntJanus I'm thinking about writing a small directive that would pair with ui-view directive (fa-view?) that would use the given animation classes for given state - WDYT?\n. @gakimball  @AntJanus  we can make \"the hack\" work with -remove - simple change for \"remove\" on custom animation\na \"normal\" timeline of toggling class with $animate:\nadd:\n- (stop, no X class)\n- ng-animate\n- ng-animate X-add (plain added class)\n- ng-animate X-add X-add-active (transition)\n- X (stop, class X added)\nremove:\n- X (stop, X class)\n- X ng-animate\n- X ng-animate X-remove (plain added/removed class)\n- ng-animate X-remove X-remove-active (transition)\n- (stop, class X removed)\n. @davidkpiano I think that you are missing the core concept of the issue at hand :-)\nit's about custom animations for states (each state should have possibility to define it's own animation class for showing and hiding respectivelly) @ ui router - please read the thread first ;-)\n. ok, so here's my take:\nhttps://github.com/stryju/foundation-apps/commit/4ddfbfbeeae27fc9fd5db37098d1b2e7f06ce226\n- dropped the animation\n- augmented the uiView directive\nhttps://github.com/stryju/foundation-apps/commit/5a75a2415e2ea7cdb629bb1712dbc91c5ffa14ea\n- changed the way animations are bound to the state\nso the \"new\" form of animation definitions should look like:\njs\n{\n  url : '/greetings',\n  template : '<h1>hi there</h1>',\n  animation : {\n    enter : 'fadeIn',\n    leave : 'zoomOut'\n  }\n}\nlet me know if that works for you\n. https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/pull/330\n. on the side-note: this repo is in a dire need for tests... big changes require integrity :)\n. any feedback is greatly appreciated :-)\n. ui router uses $animate.enter() and $animate.leave() so no css changes needed, as long as they follow the normal ng-enter / ng-leave structure :)\n. off-topic:\nMaybe it would be a wise idea to make all the angular-related animations a separate module or something?\nAs I understand, there will be different flavors of foundation-apps (react, ember, ...) and having one huge css file with all the flavors of animations (class names and so on) might generate quite an overhead\n. when testing on local foundation-apps instance i didn't come across those issues...\ncan you prepare a small repo / plunker with the code?\n. sorry for heavy gifs - let me know, when i can remove them\n\ntested on chrome, firefox, safari (os x)\n\ntested animation:\n``` scss\n$duration: 2000ms;\n.getIn.ng-enter {\n  transition: $duration cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.250, 0.750, 0.750) all;\nposition: absolute;\n  opacity: 0;\n  transform: translate3d(0, -50%, 0);\n&.ng-enter-active {\n    opacity: 1;\n    transform: translate3d(0, 0%, 0);\n  }\n}\n.getOut.ng-leave {\n  transition: $duration cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.250, 0.750, 0.750) all;\nposition: absolute;\n  opacity: 1;\n  transform: translate3d(0, 0%, 0);\n&.ng-leave-active {\n    opacity: 0;\n    transform: translate3d(0, 50%, 0);\n  }\n}\n```\n. trying to run docs locally - failing @ sass... :-|\ni keep getting \nError: app.scss:14:21: Unexpected { in decls\neven with empty app.scss file :O\n. ok, that worked - ~~somehow animations are not being merged~~...\ngot it\n. :+1: that's the way to go\njust be careful with ng-if - it can cause a weird jank on some directives :-)\n. ok, so got the animations up and running - smooth...\nbut the issue is with the animated elements - fadeout leaves some element visible (style override, it seems)\n. \nthat's with manual class toggle...\nadded ng-leave ng-leave-active\n\ncc @gakimball \n. this was a view (and view IS a component :wink:) animation - elements that are left seem to break the animation :-)\ntake a look at the frame with selector on top :-)\n. set the fadeOut animation for motionUi page and observe what happens when transitioning FROM that page (that's the gif I've attached)\nonly text elements don't fade out (weirdly)\n. keep in mind, that the way ui.router's uiView directives work is that it creates a new uiView element BEFORE the current view, like so:\nstate1 idle\nhtml\n<uiView>state1</uiView>\nstate2 loading, state1 unloading\nhtml\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-enter\">state2</uiView>\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-leave\">state1</uiView>\nstate 2 loaded, state1 unloaded\nhtml\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-enter ng-enter-active\">state2</uiView>\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-leave ng-leave-active\">state1</uiView>\nstate 2 idle\nhtml\n<uiView>state2</uiView>\n\nso what you might be referring to is the fact, that the state that's being animated out jumps below the new one, which is not animated - hm?\n. what's more, if transitions take, let's say 1s, and you switch between states 5 times within this 1s, it will create that many ngViews and just let them animate properly\nso, the DOM-situation like this is possible:\nhtml\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-leave ng-leave-active\">state1</uiView>\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-leave ng-leave-active\">state2</uiView>\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-leave ng-leave-active\">state3</uiView>\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-leave ng-leave-active\">state1</uiView>\n<uiView class=\"ng-animate ng-enter ng-enter-active\">state2</uiView> <!-- the state we're finally getting to -->\n. yeah, it is a good thing, but one needs to be aware of that ;-)\n. well, since it's OS, just branch of my branch? :D\n. :+1: \n. sorry, I have not as much time to spare as I'd like to have to spend on this at this time - how's the work going?\n.

As such, I think I would normally expect to include as a module in my own application's dependencies, just like any other third-party library.  I imagine that most developers using Angular would probably not need the routing, but there's no reason why that couldn't then be provided as another module that also uses FoundationForApps (or the common parts of it, at least) as a dependency.\nFor people using FoundationForApps for prototyping though, Angular is probably not something they want to have to deal with directly.  So providing an application around it via the FoundationForApps Template could mean that between the template's app.js and dynamic routing, most of the heavy lifting is done and they're good to go.\n. @JeroenNoten I can see the confusion with using application for the module name, but is that really intended to be included as the all-encompassing FoundationForApps module?  I assumed that was more of an example of the modules you need to import into your own project, so you wouldn't actually load Foundation's app.js file.\n@AntJanus I agree with the idea of using a 'folders-by-feature' structure as that supports the inclusion of Foundation on a module-by-module basis, only including what your application needs rather than everything in one go.  (The dynamic routing is definitely one I'd want to exclude.)\nBut in doing that, consider that the locations of the partials are hardcoded in their corresponding directives, so you'd need to ensure that they didn't clash with the application's own structure - perhaps they should be prefixed 'zf-' or something?\n.

That would also mean that it matched up with the actual directive name, which is zfPanel, zfInterchange and so on (allowing for Angular's auto-translation between hyphenated and camel-cased naming).\nOf course, whether it should match the directive or its defining module is another argument altogether.  The modules are foundation.panel and foundation.interchange, suggesting that you'd use foundation. as your folder prefix.

I agree - the first set of changes are all sensible and the foundation.components module provides additional flexibility in which components you import.  I can still see some preference for importing individual components, but that's easy enough too - it just needs some documentation in the Getting Started page.\nI'm with @stryju on the foundation.components namespace though.

Yes. I haven't done any of the major components, but the basic ones work. Should I be putting my controller definitions in the app.js file instead maybe? This code is still running out of the stable branch (1.0 or maybe 1.0.1) so I don't know if that matters or not. If it is in some updated code that is being released, I can update via CLI or manually update and try again.\n. I did a fresh build from scratch and verified the bug. You can grab the repo here:\nhttps://github.com/Dillie-O/z4a-controller-bug\nThe default .gitignore seems to not have included the build folder, so if you want me to update that to include the node modules and all that, I can do that.\nJust to make sure I'm not doing something wrong, here's how I get to this point.\n1. At terminal, run foundation-apps new z4a-controller-bug\n2. Nav into z4a-conroller-bug folder\n3. At terminal, run npm install\n4. At terminal, run bower install\n5. At terminal, run bundle\n6. At terminal, run gulp build (just to get things in place)\n7. Create client/templates/news.html\n8. Create client/assets/js/controllers.js\n9. Update client/index.html file to have proper angular routing URLs (maybe update template for this?)\n10. At terminal, run gulp - builds and starts test server\n11. Open browser and navigate to news page.\n12. See that angular brackets are there instead of the \"Not retrieved yet.\" message in the controller.\n    13, Open up web console, you should see the error message there.\nThanks guys! Let me know if you need any more details.\n. Hazzah! That did the trick for me!\nThank YOU for putting together such a great framework!\nSo moving forward, would it be worthwhile to keep the *.js or maybe account for a controllers.js file too?\n. I don't mind a production default, but having a gulp command build-debug or something like that would be great. I might have to try that out myself!\n. Oooh! I like that idea a lot! Thanks for that!\n. Hey guys! I really appreciate you taking the idea and running with it. I'm still figuring all this out myself and it would have taken a lot longer for me to piece it altogether.\n. Okay, I ran bower update, and specified 1.3.16 as the new option. That seemed to update a lot of things. I also was informed I was running an older version of bower, so I updated bower, ran bower update again, and got the same results. \nLooking at my bower.json file, my dependencies section still has foundation-apps ~1.0.2 listed in the dependencies. Is this the latest version allowed through this process still? I thought 1.1 was released. Or do I need to update the bower.json file to require a newer version?\n. Good to know. I remember seeing the gulp updates (all good ones) so I'm not too worried about that.\nI was able to get things updated. For kicks I ran foundation-apps update and after a moment the command prompt returned to me, but nothing seemed to have occurred. So I ran bower update again and saw a lot of updates, and it looks like foundation is updated.\nI think it's safe to say at this point that I'm updated, now I'll just see if I need to make any tweaks to my code. Thanks!\nOne final note, running foundation-apps -v doesn't seem to return anything but a list of commands to run, I was expecting to see the version somewhere. Is that a bug?\n. Oooh, good to know. I'll update that now.\nSince I have you here, I'm seeing this error now when I try foundationapps-build\n\n[09:37:02] 'uglify:foundation' errored after 1.1 ms\n[09:37:02] TypeError: Object # has no method 'if'\n    at Gulp.gulp.task.gulp.src.pipe.$.webserver.port (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\gulpfile.js:152\n:19)\n    at module.exports (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orchestrator\\li\nb\\runTask.js:34:7)\n    at Gulp.Orchestrator._runTask (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orc\nhestrator\\index.js:273:3)\n    at Gulp.Orchestrator._runStep (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orc\nhestrator\\index.js:214:10)\n    at C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orchestrator\\index.js:279:18\n    at finish (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orchestrator\\lib\\runTas\nk.js:21:8)\n    at cb (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orchestrator\\lib\\runTask.js\n:29:3)\n    at Gulp.gulp.task.gulp.src.pipe.$.sass.includePaths (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\gulpfile.js:\n130:2)\n    at module.exports (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orchestrator\\li\nb\\runTask.js:34:7)\n    at Gulp.Orchestrator._runTask (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orc\nhestrator\\index.js:273:3)\n\nAm I missing a library for that?

The error I got when doing this was:\n\"Error: [ng:areq] Argument 'NewsController' is not a function, got undefined\nhttp://errors.angularjs.org/1.3.6/ng/areq?p0=NewsController&p1=not%20a            1.#QNAN0unction%2C%20got%20undefined\nminErr/<@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:1:654\nassertArg@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:1:12046\nassertArgFn@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:1:12248\n$ControllerProvider/this.$get</<@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:3:10472\n$ViewDirectiveFill/<.compile/<@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:11:4165\ninvokeLinkFn@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:3:5296\nnodeLinkFn@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:2:23568\ncompositeLinkFn@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:2:13408\ncompile/<@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:2:12079\nupdateView@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:11:2951\n$ViewDirective/directive.compile/</<@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:11:3511\n$RootScopeProvider/this.$get</Scope.prototype.$broadcast@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:4:29271\n$get/$state.transitionTo/$state.transition<@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:10:28592\nprocessQueue@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:4:14675\nscheduleProcessQueue/<@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:4:14939\n$RootScopeProvider/this.$get</Scope.prototype.$eval@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:4:27049\n$RootScopeProvider/this.$get</Scope.prototype.$digest@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:4:24924\n$RootScopeProvider/this.$get</Scope.prototype.$apply@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:4:27434\ndone@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:3:16426\ncompleteRequest@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:3:20115\ncreateHttpBackend/</xhr.onload@http://localhost:54195/assets/js/app.js:3:21037\n\" app.js:4:3721\nLet me know if you need any other details.\n. Yes. I haven't done any of the major components, but the basic ones work. Should I be putting my controller definitions in the app.js file instead maybe? This code is still running out of the stable branch (1.0 or maybe 1.0.1) so I don't know if that matters or not. If it is in some updated code that is being released, I can update via CLI or manually update and try again.\n. I did a fresh build from scratch and verified the bug. You can grab the repo here:\nhttps://github.com/Dillie-O/z4a-controller-bug\nThe default .gitignore seems to not have included the build folder, so if you want me to update that to include the node modules and all that, I can do that.\nJust to make sure I'm not doing something wrong, here's how I get to this point.\n1. At terminal, run foundation-apps new z4a-controller-bug\n2. Nav into z4a-conroller-bug folder\n3. At terminal, run npm install\n4. At terminal, run bower install\n5. At terminal, run bundle\n6. At terminal, run gulp build (just to get things in place)\n7. Create client/templates/news.html\n8. Create client/assets/js/controllers.js\n9. Update client/index.html file to have proper angular routing URLs (maybe update template for this?)\n10. At terminal, run gulp - builds and starts test server\n11. Open browser and navigate to news page.\n12. See that angular brackets are there instead of the \"Not retrieved yet.\" message in the controller.\n    13, Open up web console, you should see the error message there.\nThanks guys! Let me know if you need any more details.\n. Hazzah! That did the trick for me!\nThank YOU for putting together such a great framework!\nSo moving forward, would it be worthwhile to keep the *.js or maybe account for a controllers.js file too?\n. I don't mind a production default, but having a gulp command build-debug or something like that would be great. I might have to try that out myself!\n. Oooh! I like that idea a lot! Thanks for that!\n. Hey guys! I really appreciate you taking the idea and running with it. I'm still figuring all this out myself and it would have taken a lot longer for me to piece it altogether.\n. Okay, I ran bower update, and specified 1.3.16 as the new option. That seemed to update a lot of things. I also was informed I was running an older version of bower, so I updated bower, ran bower update again, and got the same results. \nLooking at my bower.json file, my dependencies section still has foundation-apps ~1.0.2 listed in the dependencies. Is this the latest version allowed through this process still? I thought 1.1 was released. Or do I need to update the bower.json file to require a newer version?\n. Good to know. I remember seeing the gulp updates (all good ones) so I'm not too worried about that.\nI was able to get things updated. For kicks I ran foundation-apps update and after a moment the command prompt returned to me, but nothing seemed to have occurred. So I ran bower update again and saw a lot of updates, and it looks like foundation is updated.\nI think it's safe to say at this point that I'm updated, now I'll just see if I need to make any tweaks to my code. Thanks!\nOne final note, running foundation-apps -v doesn't seem to return anything but a list of commands to run, I was expecting to see the version somewhere. Is that a bug?\n. Oooh, good to know. I'll update that now.\nSince I have you here, I'm seeing this error now when I try foundationapps-build\n\n[09:37:02] 'uglify:foundation' errored after 1.1 ms\n[09:37:02] TypeError: Object # has no method 'if'\n    at Gulp.gulp.task.gulp.src.pipe.$.webserver.port (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\gulpfile.js:152\n:19)\n    at module.exports (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orchestrator\\li\nb\\runTask.js:34:7)\n    at Gulp.Orchestrator._runTask (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orc\nhestrator\\index.js:273:3)\n    at Gulp.Orchestrator._runStep (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orc\nhestrator\\index.js:214:10)\n    at C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orchestrator\\index.js:279:18\n    at finish (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orchestrator\\lib\\runTas\nk.js:21:8)\n    at cb (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orchestrator\\lib\\runTask.js\n:29:3)\n    at Gulp.gulp.task.gulp.src.pipe.$.sass.includePaths (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\gulpfile.js:\n130:2)\n    at module.exports (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orchestrator\\li\nb\\runTask.js:34:7)\n    at Gulp.Orchestrator._runTask (C:\\Users\\Sean\\Projects\\prayerjournal\\prayerjournal\\node_modules\\gulp\\node_modules\\orc\nhestrator\\index.js:273:3)\n\nAm I missing a library for that?

When worked with bootstrap's modal before i remember having used a provider for it :\n\n.provider('modalState', function($stateProvider) {\n    var provider = this;\n    this.$get = function() {\n        return provider;\n    }\n    this.state = function(stateName, options) {\n        var modalInstance;\n        $stateProvider.state(stateName, {\n            url: options.url,\n            onEnter: function($modal, $state) {\n                modalInstance = $modal.open(options);\n                modalInstance.result['finally'](function() {\n                    modalInstance = null;\n                    if ($state.$current.name === stateName) {\n                        $state.go('^');\n                    }\n                });\n            },\n            onExit: function() {\n                if (modalInstance) {\n                    modalInstance.close();\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    };\n})\n\nThen on my router configs I just had to to use it as a page wrapper when needed like this : \n\nmodalStateProvider\n    .state('app.campaign.new', {\n         url: '/new',\n         templateUrl: 'partials/campaign/campaign.new.html',\n         controller: 'CampaignCreateController'\n    });\n\nIt was elegant as solution to me while It meant to satisfy a Restful CRUD app where each page had it's own controller and i needed that easy access with a /new link any way. \nNow with Foundation for apps doing almost the same CRUD thing, i just assigned my Edit page to a parent one and wrapped it into modal then replaced Cancel and Close buttons with go back links : http://foundation.zurb.com/forum/posts/23322-open-apps-modal-on-page-load?page=2#comment-21214\nSo I'm sharing this just to point to one more possible use of modals, I mean why not add an optional wrapper parameter to pages like : \n\n---\nname: edit\nurl: /edit\nparent: items\ncontroller: EditlCtrl\nwrapper: zf-modal\n---\n\nwhere page will be initialised inside a modal with its own controller if provided, otherwise it will share parent's controller and $scope (if possible).\n. +1\n. why not a child page with its own controller where html content will just be inserted inside a modal, it worked for me, i just replaced the Close and/or Cancel button with a go back to parent link, check this: \nhttp://foundation.zurb.com/forum/posts/23322-open-apps-modal-on-page-load?page=2#comment-21214\n. F4A is built with angularJs which is one of the best on designing single page applications.

I just wish the owners to not let it die.\n. great news. thanks @AntJanus for coming back to this and thanks @soumak77 for having kept working on it.\n. why not keeping front and back totally separated and use REST ? Rails and Angular are great with REST\n. When worked with bootstrap's modal before i remember having used a provider for it :\n\n.provider('modalState', function($stateProvider) {\n    var provider = this;\n    this.$get = function() {\n        return provider;\n    }\n    this.state = function(stateName, options) {\n        var modalInstance;\n        $stateProvider.state(stateName, {\n            url: options.url,\n            onEnter: function($modal, $state) {\n                modalInstance = $modal.open(options);\n                modalInstance.result['finally'](function() {\n                    modalInstance = null;\n                    if ($state.$current.name === stateName) {\n                        $state.go('^');\n                    }\n                });\n            },\n            onExit: function() {\n                if (modalInstance) {\n                    modalInstance.close();\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    };\n})\n\nThen on my router configs I just had to to use it as a page wrapper when needed like this : \n\nmodalStateProvider\n    .state('app.campaign.new', {\n         url: '/new',\n         templateUrl: 'partials/campaign/campaign.new.html',\n         controller: 'CampaignCreateController'\n    });\n\nIt was elegant as solution to me while It meant to satisfy a Restful CRUD app where each page had it's own controller and i needed that easy access with a /new link any way. \nNow with Foundation for apps doing almost the same CRUD thing, i just assigned my Edit page to a parent one and wrapped it into modal then replaced Cancel and Close buttons with go back links : http://foundation.zurb.com/forum/posts/23322-open-apps-modal-on-page-load?page=2#comment-21214\nSo I'm sharing this just to point to one more possible use of modals, I mean why not add an optional wrapper parameter to pages like : \n\n---\nname: edit\nurl: /edit\nparent: items\ncontroller: EditlCtrl\nwrapper: zf-modal\n---\n\nwhere page will be initialised inside a modal with its own controller if provided, otherwise it will share parent's controller and $scope (if possible).\n. +1\n. why not a child page with its own controller where html content will just be inserted inside a modal, it worked for me, i just replaced the Close and/or Cancel button with a go back to parent link, check this: \nhttp://foundation.zurb.com/forum/posts/23322-open-apps-modal-on-page-load?page=2#comment-21214\n. F4A is built with angularJs which is one of the best on designing single page applications.

I should have clarified better, the story is that I'm trying to use another third-party system that listens for $stateChangeStart and checks if authentication is needed by looking for to.data.requireLogin.  \nI'd imagine that there could be other external assets out there that follow this specification to store  custom data in the data property.  \nBut rather than attempting to change the way the other systems checks $state.data, (there could be many) I was hoping Foundation-apps could be able to pass in data properties entered in front matter and then add that to the state.data along with the properties that will be placed in state.data.vars.\nI expanded my initial workaround to compensate some edge cases, here's my attempt at this:  \njavascript\n    var state = {\n      data: getData(page),\n    }\n    function getData(page) {\n      var data = { vars: {} };\n      if (page.data) {\n        if (typeof page.data.vars === \"object\") {\n          data.vars = page.data.vars;\n        }\n        delete page.data.vars;\n        angular.extend(data, page.data);\n      }\n      delete page.data;\n      angular.extend(data.vars, page);\n      return data;\n    }\nIt considers that there could be valid data.vars properties from within and merge it with the rest of the properties in the page, but ultimately overwriting same name values in favor of the page properties.\n```\nname: post\nurl: /post\nanimationIn: fadeIn\ndata:\n    requiresLogin: true\n    vars:   // not recommended but will support provided properties are unique\n        cards:\n            -\n                name: \"Card in data vars\"\n                description: \"I shouldn't be here, but I'll still work {{ vars.cards[0].name }}\"\n\n```\n```\nname: post\nurl: /post\nanimationIn: fadeIn\ndata:\n    requiresLogin: true\n    vars:  // not recommended but will support provided properties are unique\n        cards:\n            -\n                name: \"Card in data vars\"\n                description: \"I won't work now cause I'm not favored\"\ncards:\n    -\n         name: \"Card in vars\"\n         description:  \"I will work cause I'm favored!\"\n\n```\nOverlooks any properties with the key name as vars\n```\nname: post\nurl: /post\nanimationIn: fadeIn\ndata:\n    requiresLogin: true\n    vars: \"will be overwritten cause I'm not an object\"\n\n```\nI hope this isn't beyond the scope of Foundation-apps, I think being able to integrate with other third-party systems will be vital.\nThe result would be: \nstate.data = { \n    requireLogin: true,\n    vars: {\n       name: \"post\",\n       animationIn: fadeIn,\n       ...\n    }\n}\n. Edit: Using negative values for position elements, instead of negative margin values.\nI had the same issue by nesting panels and closing them with a Hard-Toggle.  I don't have jQuery.  It happens in Chrome and IE.  \nWhen placing the zf-open button for the child panel inside the parent panel, do the following:\n1. Open Parent Panel\n2. Open Child Panel\n3. Press Hard-Toggle\n4. Wait for more than 3 seconds\n5. Open Parent Panel\n6. Open Child Panel\nThe child panel disappears on the second run.  I traced the problem down to this bug.  Essentially what's happening is that the transitionend event is not fired for the child panel since the transition was canceled out because the parent element (parent panel) has a style of display:none from the base panel class.  Then, after 3 seconds, the setTimeout function runs removing left over style classes.  \nThe problem now though is that the event listener is still listening for the event, and so when the transitionend occurs for the second 'Open', the finishAnimation runs again for the previous 'Close'.  \nThe possible solution would be to avoid using display: none.  By using a negative left, top, right, bottom values for each respective panel position and removing the values for display in the 'base' and  is-active class, and the setTimeout function,  I was able to do it with the following edits to the panel.scss:\ncss\n%panel-base {\n  position: absolute;\n  z-index: 100;\n  overflow-y: auto;\n}\nFor hidden panels:\ncss\n  /*\n    Direction\n  */\n  @if $position == top {\n    top: -9999px;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  @else if $position == right {\n    right: -9999px;\n    height: 100%;\n  }\n  @else if $position == bottom {\n    bottom: -9999px;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  @else if $position == left {\n    left: -9999px;\n    height: 100%;\n  }\nFor displayed panels:\ncss\n  &.is-active {\n    @if $position == left        { box-shadow: $shadow-distance 0 $shadow-size $shadow-color; top: 0; left: 0; }\n    @else if $position == right  { box-shadow: (-$shadow-distance) 0 $shadow-size $shadow-color; top: 0; right: 0;}\n    @else if $position == top    { box-shadow: 0 $shadow-distance $shadow-size $shadow-color; top: 0; left: 0;}\n    @else if $position == bottom { box-shadow: 2px (-$shadow-distance) $shadow-size $shadow-color; bottom: 0; left: 0;}\n  }\nThen in motions.scss, added left, top, right, and bottom to transition-property (especially needed for firefox):\n``` css\n  // CSS Output\n  @include transition-start($dir) {\n    @include transition-basics($duration, $timing, $delay);\n    transition-property: transform, opacity,  left, top, bottom, right;\n    backface-visibility: hidden;\n    transform: $start;\n@if $fade { opacity: if($dir == in, 0, 1); }\n\n}\n```\nIt no longer has to rely on the a timeout function to cleanup the styles.

Excuse me for the delay. Yes, the above steps work. Thank you for your rapid responses.\nFor those who use haven't used the older version of Foundation for Apps, here are the two Gemfiles that I placed in the root folder of my  Foundation for apps project and the final gulpfile.js code:\nThe Gemfile.lock file:\n```\nGEM\n  remote: https://rubygems.org/\n  specs:\n    sass (3.4.9)\nPLATFORMS\n  ruby\nDEPENDENCIES\n  sass (~> 3.4.0)\n```\nThe Gemfile file:\n```\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\ngem \"sass\", \"~> 3.4.0\"\n```\nThe final code in gulpfile.js was:\ngulp.task('sass', function() {\n    return $.rubySass('client/assets/scss/app.scss', {\n            loadPath: paths.sass,\n            style: 'nested',\n            bundleExec: true\n        })\n        .pipe($.autoprefixer({\n             browsers: ['last 2 versions', 'ie 10']\n        }))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/assets/css/'));\n});\n. No, I don't want the panel to be open as long as the vehicles state is active. Hopefully, the following explanation of what is not working for me will be clearer.\nThe state is defined like this:\n$stateProvider.state('vehicles', {\n    url: '/vehicles/{vehicleType}',\n    templateUrl: 'templates/dev/vehicles.html'\n});\nWhen I go to http://localhost:8080/#!/vehicles/cars I see the block list:\n<div class=\"grid-content\">\n    <div class=\"block-list\">\n        <ul>\n            <li><a zf-open=\"detail-panel\" ui-sref=\"vehicles({vehicleType:'cars'})\">Cars</a></li>\n            <li> <a zf-open=\"detail-panel\" ui-sref=\"vehicles({vehicleType:'bikes'})\">Bikes</a></li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n</div>\nThis is what I want to see.\nThen, when I click on the <a zf-open=\"detail-panel\" ui-sref=\"vehicles({vehicleType:'bikes'})\">Bikes</a> link, I want the panel to open up and show the word <h3>Bikes</h3>.\nHowever, ui-sref=\"vehicles({vehicleType:'bikes'})\" appears to conflict with zf-open=\"detail-panel\" and the panel does not open until the <a zf-open=\"detail-panel\" ui-sref=\"vehicles({vehicleType:'bikes'})\">Bikes</a> link is clicked twice.\n. Is there a workaround for this - I see the post has been labelled as a 'feature' request?\n. Thanks @soumak77. The ModalFactory does indeed take care of a lot of it.\nHowever, take the example of a modal that contains a lot of controller logic, such as a modal with a web form. I wish to reuse that modal form. Using ModalFactory, I can write the template html once and reuse it as many times as I like. However, each time I want to use the modal on a state, I would have to rewrite all the controller javascript. Is that right? Is there a way around that?\nAlso, how does one set the class size of the modal like tiny, large etc?\n. Thanks for the quick reply - I'll look the idea of a service that produces a ModalFactory and post back.\n. I still find a major flaw with this approach (although there are messy workarounds). The basic issue is that one cannot access the scope variables for the modal template in the factory. So there should be an option to include a controller for the template like: \n$scope.foo = \"Bloop!\";\n$scope.bar = \"Blee!\";\nvar config = {\n    id: 'your optional id here',\n    templateUrl: 'path/to/template',\n    controller: 'path/to/controller',      // <-- this is needed\n    controllerAs: 'modalCtrl',             // <-- this is needed\n    contentScope: {\n        foo: $scope.foo,\n        bar: $scope.bar\n    },\n    animationIn: 'slideInFromTop'\n}\n$scope.modal = new ModalFactory(config);\nThe need for a controller here is the same as the need for a controller anywhere.\nHaving said that, I have found the functionality of ModalFactory that does exist good so far.\n. Setting overflow-y: hidden on the .menu-bar class and position: relative; left: 50%; on the .action-sheet-container class did not work for me.\nThe following has worked (written in SASS):\n.menu-bar {\n    overflow-x: visible;\n    .action-sheet-container {\n        display: block;\n    }\n}\n. @bbcreatv, did you try using the SASS I wrote out in my previous comment above?

I'm happy using Autoprefixer for vendor prefixes but I do use many other Compass functions like Compass Sprites. Are you suggesting one should avoid Compass if possible, generally speaking, in your opinion?\n. Okay, I understand why you wouldn't post how to add Compass to FA then. I might do without it anyway.\nThanks for your quick replies.\nReferring to the example I gave above, it would be great if the Foundation for Apps Motion UI classes could be used with directives like ng-show.\n. After running those commands in the project folder, I get:\n``\nError:libsassbindings not found.

It seems from some node-sass forum posts that node-sass does not support older operating systems.\nHow can I compile with Ruby instead of libsass?\nAfter running the commands suggested, I got the same error as I listed in the original post of this issue.\nMy node version is: 0.12.0.\n. When I try that and I use foundation-apps watch in Terminal, I get the following error:\n```\n[17:06:35] Starting 'sass'...\n[17:06:35] 'sass' errored after 51 ms\n[17:06:35] TypeError: Arguments to path.join must be strings\n    at Object.posix.join (path.js:471:13)\n    at Object.module.exports (/.../my_project/node_modules/gulp-ruby-sass/index.js:65:15)\n    at Gulp.

New syntax was introduced for gulp-ruby-sass 1.x.

Excuse me for the delay. Yes, the above steps work. Thank you for your rapid responses.\nFor those who use haven't used the older version of Foundation for Apps, here are the two Gemfiles that I placed in the root folder of my  Foundation for apps project and the final gulpfile.js code:\nThe Gemfile.lock file:\n```\nGEM\n  remote: https://rubygems.org/\n  specs:\n    sass (3.4.9)\nPLATFORMS\n  ruby\nDEPENDENCIES\n  sass (~> 3.4.0)\n```\nThe Gemfile file:\n```\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\ngem \"sass\", \"~> 3.4.0\"\n```\nThe final code in gulpfile.js was:\ngulp.task('sass', function() {\n    return $.rubySass('client/assets/scss/app.scss', {\n            loadPath: paths.sass,\n            style: 'nested',\n            bundleExec: true\n        })\n        .pipe($.autoprefixer({\n             browsers: ['last 2 versions', 'ie 10']\n        }))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('./build/assets/css/'));\n});\n. No, I don't want the panel to be open as long as the vehicles state is active. Hopefully, the following explanation of what is not working for me will be clearer.\nThe state is defined like this:\n$stateProvider.state('vehicles', {\n    url: '/vehicles/{vehicleType}',\n    templateUrl: 'templates/dev/vehicles.html'\n});\nWhen I go to http://localhost:8080/#!/vehicles/cars I see the block list:\n<div class=\"grid-content\">\n    <div class=\"block-list\">\n        <ul>\n            <li><a zf-open=\"detail-panel\" ui-sref=\"vehicles({vehicleType:'cars'})\">Cars</a></li>\n            <li> <a zf-open=\"detail-panel\" ui-sref=\"vehicles({vehicleType:'bikes'})\">Bikes</a></li>\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n</div>\nThis is what I want to see.\nThen, when I click on the <a zf-open=\"detail-panel\" ui-sref=\"vehicles({vehicleType:'bikes'})\">Bikes</a> link, I want the panel to open up and show the word <h3>Bikes</h3>.\nHowever, ui-sref=\"vehicles({vehicleType:'bikes'})\" appears to conflict with zf-open=\"detail-panel\" and the panel does not open until the <a zf-open=\"detail-panel\" ui-sref=\"vehicles({vehicleType:'bikes'})\">Bikes</a> link is clicked twice.\n. Is there a workaround for this - I see the post has been labelled as a 'feature' request?\n. Thanks @soumak77. The ModalFactory does indeed take care of a lot of it.\nHowever, take the example of a modal that contains a lot of controller logic, such as a modal with a web form. I wish to reuse that modal form. Using ModalFactory, I can write the template html once and reuse it as many times as I like. However, each time I want to use the modal on a state, I would have to rewrite all the controller javascript. Is that right? Is there a way around that?\nAlso, how does one set the class size of the modal like tiny, large etc?\n. Thanks for the quick reply - I'll look the idea of a service that produces a ModalFactory and post back.\n. I still find a major flaw with this approach (although there are messy workarounds). The basic issue is that one cannot access the scope variables for the modal template in the factory. So there should be an option to include a controller for the template like: \n$scope.foo = \"Bloop!\";\n$scope.bar = \"Blee!\";\nvar config = {\n    id: 'your optional id here',\n    templateUrl: 'path/to/template',\n    controller: 'path/to/controller',      // <-- this is needed\n    controllerAs: 'modalCtrl',             // <-- this is needed\n    contentScope: {\n        foo: $scope.foo,\n        bar: $scope.bar\n    },\n    animationIn: 'slideInFromTop'\n}\n$scope.modal = new ModalFactory(config);\nThe need for a controller here is the same as the need for a controller anywhere.\nHaving said that, I have found the functionality of ModalFactory that does exist good so far.\n.

The modal is still \"there\" and correctly fixed to the viewport - but it isn't displayed.\nI did some research into this, the better, albeit somewhat old posts I found describe the problem:\n- https://miketaylr.com/posts/2015/06/position-fixed-overflow-hidden.html\n- https://benfrain.com/z-index-stacking-contexts-experimental-css-and-ios-safari/\nI realize at first this may seem a bit like an edge case, but as we work on our (significantly complex) F4A-based web application we're finding that the need to include modals via the ui-view template files is pretty frequent.  We don't want a large set of empty modals sitting on a page which cannot use them.\nThe approach we've taken to date is:\n- Use a replacement for the modal factory, a \"master modal\" when possible for generic cases\n- Use specific CSS styles (overflow: visible) for specific or semi-generic cases\n- Where possible, move the modals \"up\" a level or two in the template tree\nThat said, we've already seen some self-contained conflicts, for example a page that has:\n- A menu bar\n- A content area, template based, which requires overflow: auto - and also includes a modal\nIf it wasn't so damn ugly, one potential quick fix would be to target the parent container of any modal and set it to overflow: visible while said modal was active.

This makes complex modals harder to implement.\nA concrete use case:\nI have a list of courses in a page, with a New Course button to create a new modal using a courseForm directive, which binds to a function from the current scope on the onSave attribute. On this specific case, I want to track the event using a TrackerService and then close the modal. I'd like to define bind a trackAndClose function to the onSave attribute.\nBecause I have to pass any functions I'd like to use via the contentScope, this trackAndClose function would be in the wrong place (my courses list controller) instead of in my NewCourseCtrl I'd like to use when instantiating the modal.\n. I've created a PR for this, see #689\n. I left the previous company I was using foundation-apps and forgot about this. I'll do what @zurbchris asked so we can move forward.\n. I also would like something similar to what angular-foundation and angular-bootstrap do.\nMain problems with just passing things over contentScope:\n-  A common practice in the angular community is to encapsulate my function calls in a controller and define it as a vm (see link for more info).
