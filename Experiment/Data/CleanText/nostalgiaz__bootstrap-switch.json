I just managed re-deploy the app and test it, initially 3.0.0 doesn't seem to be compatible with the way I'm using things, I will check the class names and methods I'm using and report back again (I've used the css in the bootstrap2 folder, however the switches doesn't render properly, nearly not at all)\n. Yes, it seems I'm using a container element and manual class names, while the new method is to just initialize the .bootstrapSwitch on the input element (I was manually initializing the .bootstrapSwitch too but on the container)\nAnyway I will create an isolated test case and report back the results\nThanks for your interest in the issue\n. I've tested the new .boostrapSwitch, however for some reason the styles are missing, I'm 90% sure there are no file reference issues, I verified the switch conversion, but only ON and OFF are added as a text and no styles, classic missing CSS file behaviour, however I'm fairly sure it's there, I will check again but for the time being you could consider my feedback inconclusive\n(It's really hard to debug with phonegap, the builds or \"run\" commands take their time)\n. Well there is the possibility of weinre, however it's more pain than it's worth\nAnyway, after verifying it's not script/style import issues, I've tested the same thing on web, to at least verify that it works as the way I try to make it work, I think this might hint the cause:\n\nLet me know if it's helpful\n.

Ok here is what I did to get it work with KnockoutJS for us...\nFirst off all I removed the following lines from the end of bootstrap-swith.js:\n$(function () {\n  $('.switch')'switch';\n});\nthis because when using KnockoutJS, especially if you are using templates to render conditional markup, the target elements won't be rendered yet when the bootrap-switch javascript is loaded. In our case we are even using the same page and just switching markup when the user navigates so there is no good way to load the javascript at the end of the markup or anything like that.\nOk so after removing those few lines I went ahead and created a binding handler for bootstrap-switch (with added comments for explaination):\nko.bindingHandlers.bootstrapSwitcher = {\n    init: function (element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor, viewModel) {\n        var bindingAcc = allBindingsAccessor();\n                // Init bootstrap-switch for this element\n        $(element).switch();\n                // Set the initial state of the switch button based on the object passed to the binding)\n        $(element).switch('setState', ko.utils.unwrapObservable(valueAccessor()));\n                // Event handler that makes the view model update as soon as the state of the switch button changes\n        $(element).on('switch-change', function (e, data) { valueAccessor()(data.value); });\n                // In my project I have a disable binding for all controlls since the application can be in a view only\n                // mode and thus I included code for a possible disable binding in the binding handler as well.\n        if (bindingAcc.disabled)\n            $(element).switch('toggleActivation');\n    },\n    update: function (element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor, viewModel) { }\n};\nWith this binding handler I can now use the following markup:\n\n\n\nViewModelObservable will toggled between true and false for each click on the bootstrap-switch button and if specified, the whole control will be disabled  disable binding is specified as above.\nHope this helps and let me know if it worked out for you.\nCheers\n. Yes, that was the same symptoms I experienced. Hope this works out for you as well\n. Glad to hear it. Let me know if you run into more troubles\ncheers\n. You have a syntax error in your markup for the switch.. Not sure but that might cause to trouble...\n\nis missing a / at the end.. Try with:\n \ninstead and see if that makes any difference what so ever.\nIf not, try including the bootstrapSwitch.js at the bottom of your page instead since there is code there that will call .bootstrapSwitch() (which actually will make the checkboxes turn into switch buttons) on all elements that has the css class 'switch'.\nCheers\n. Still missing the / in the input tag, but that shouldn't be the problem (but no point in making invalid markup so best to include it anyways).... Did you do as I said and loaded the bootstrapSwitch.js at the end of the file or something like that? Or in some other backbone way ensure that it is loaded after the markup indeed has been rendered?\n. Differences Between HTML and XHTML\nIn HTML, the  tag has no end tag.\nIn XHTML, the  tag must be properly closed, like this .\nSo my bad, not needed in HTML... \nnot sure how you can load the JS when the dynamically loaded pages are done loading... But:\n\"Don't we have an activation function so one apply on render\"\nsounds like you have a way to know when the markup is done rendering, yes? In that case you can do:\n$('.switch')'bootstrapSwitch';\n. Glad I could help... \n. Sorry brother, but doesn't setState and status relate to the checked or not checked status of the checkbox, not the disable / enable status?\nCheers\n. I myself patched bootstrapSwitch,js with this functionallity:\n\nsetActive: function (active) {\n    active ? $(this).removeClass('deactivate') : $(this).addClass('deactivate');\n}\nPerhaps you can add this to your local copy Arnold?\nCheers\n. And of course, you should be able to use something like this:\n\nisActive : function() {\n     return $this).hasClas('deactivate');\n}\n\nto check if the switch is disabled or not... I guess\nCheers\n. Everyting is irie man (should be read with jamacian accent :D)\n. Are there any specific compatibility issues you are referring to? No point in contributing to a repository with bug reports if you don't actually provide an report or at least a short description of what's not working...\n. I second that.

Hi Bearcosta.\n\nThanks for your advice.\nI rechecked my markup and did some tests here. No good anyway.\n\nI am trying to use the switch inside a Backbone View, under responsive bootstrap layout. Check my mark-up:\n\n```\n           \n\nToggle Me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n```\n\nNo matter how I arrange these divs, the switch ends up with a 3 o 4 px height as seen on my previous comment.\nhttps://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/18#issuecomment-13724546\n\nOtherwise, if I use the toogle in a \"normal\" plain page, it works fine.\nSomething tells me it is css related, because the style is appling but the result becomes somehow messy =/\nMaybe it wont play along bootstrap-responsive... who knows. Mattia!? Shed some light here please.\n\nGod bless and happy coding!\n. Let me learn something: there should be a / in the input tag? Where should it go? The specs on the w3c schools says nothing about that =< clarify, please.\n\nI tried to do as you said but unfortunately my views are all dynamic and that would be too much work to get the switch shinning at this point. Don't we have an activation function so one apply on render. Be my guest o.O.\n\ncheers\n. See...?  Learned something (XHTML and the / )...\n\nAnd you are the hero of the day, Bearcosta!!!\nOne hundred cheers for you.\n\nI can sync my render function to activate the switch button. Now it works like a charm.\nSharing this information for all Backbone users.\n\nHappy coding!\n. Sorry, Mr Larentis...\n\nI read this block:\n\n$('#mySwitch').bootstrapSwitch('toggleActivation');$('#mySwitch').bootstrapSwitch('toggleState');$('#mySwitch').bootstrapSwitch('setState',\ntrue);$('#mySwitch').bootstrapSwitch('status');  // returns true or\nfalse$('#mySwitch').bootstrapSwitch('destroy');\n\nI played with all these functions but none would let me setEnable or\nDisabled straight ahead.\nThe toggleActivation has no garantee that you are setting the \"active\nstate\" right.\n\nFor example, if there is no information about the current activation state,\nhow can I tell if I should call \"toggleActivatiion\" (or not) to make a\nswitch enabled?\n\no.O\nHappy Coding!\n\nArnaldo Diniz\n\n2013/2/21 Mattia Larentis notifications@github.com\n\n> This two _new_ features already exist.\n> \n> There is an available page of documentation herehttps://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/blob/master/README.mdand a demo page\n> here http://www.larentis.eu/switch/.\n> \n> There is a methods list in the documentation page and some example in the\n> demo page!\n> \n> Cheers\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/22#issuecomment-13878593.\n.

what is the style applied to the progress bar and any other element involved?\n. @cjm0000000 try to update to the latest version of this library (2.0.0), update the markup, call bootstrapSwitch manually and tell me if you still have this problem.\n. @cjm0000000 i don't know how to replicate the problems. if you can, checkout branch 2.1 and tell me if, for some reason, is working out. thanks\n. i will accept this, but i ask you to help you carefully with different jQuery versions to avoid inconsistencies or bugs. with jQuery 2.* or 1.10.*, it's all working fine for me. \n. hi @roelvanduijnhoven,\nthanks for this. merged in master branch.\n. it all works perfectly with both bootstrap versions. close here. reopen it if you have a concrete case to show me. thanks.\n. duplicate of https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/168.\n. fixed in https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/pull/171. thanks.\n. @binoculars sorry, but Bootstrap 3 has dropped the inverse color variant for buttons. if you need to add the inverse variant, add a class to your switches and write your own css. thanks anyway.\n. @MichaelHanks either the answer is obvious or the question is malformed. what do you mean, exactly? \n. too obscure for me. close.\n. @drewfreyling, thank you for your contribution.\n. i can see the component listed in the search result. thanks anyway.\n. @phuongnd08 can you be more specific about this? which behavior are you referring to?\n. @phuongnd08 as pointed out by @conormacken, you have to register your handlers to switch-change, triggered after the change logic has done.\n. 1.7.* is a pretty outdated version. bootstrap switch supports jquery from version 1.9.* to the latest. update the version, or reopen this issue if you suggest me the changes to increase the backward compatibility. thanks\n. @dsenthilraj have you tried to increase the width of the single switch?\n. close. let me know if you solved this as i suggested.\n. hello @aaronluo,\ncan you be more specific about the error you get in console? thanks.\n. @aaronluo feel free to get back at me here if you still encounter this. thanks.\n. @surferau the jquery version you're using is 3 major releases behind. update it. thanks.\n. hello @surferau,\ni think this could be easily fixed adding the display: inline-block to the switch label, instead of adding it with javascript. what do you think?\n. @surferau done. coming out with 2.0.0.\n. @lynx1983 i will merge this in the 2.0.0 branch.\n. hi @kaansoral,\ncan you upload me the screenshot(s) and browser(s) used to test? thank you.\n.  thank yoy @kaansoral and @jonagoldman,\ni'll try to find a solution. it must be the less invasive possible. i obviously would prefer to rely entirely on css rule, but if it's not possible i'd consider to implement some js hack.\nregardless, can you verify if you still happening with bootstrap-switch version 2.0.0? and in case, would be possible for you to update bootstrap to version 3?\n. @kaansoral, @jonagoldman, @aajahid, try it from the coming minor release 2.0.1. if it's not, feel free to reopen this issue. thanks.\n. @kaansoral good points. i'll make these changes on 3.0.0.\n. @kaansoral can you try branch 3.0? it should be resolved.\n. @kaansoral the api in version 3.0 has been rewritten. i guess you might need to change something to make it working again. if that's not the issue, i'll try to use the bootstrap2 css to replicate the problem.\n. @kaansoral exactly. now it's as much simpler as instantiate bootstrapSwitch on the single checkbox element. :+1:\n. @kaansoral isn't there any way to have a debug report in phonegap (a way to get possible JS console error, either during compilation or after the build has been created)? so far, i used it once and for a small project so i cannot help directly.\n. @kaansoral allright, now i see. it's been fixed yesterday. the build has been remade. try it out now :+1: https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/225\n. @michaek the file structure has changed from version 1.9.0. would you mind pull it back to your fork, make the necessary adaptations and create another PR?\n. @michaek thanks!\n. @morrow95 can i close?\n. @kyrstenkelly thank you. i was in a rush and didn't double check. let me know if now is working. cheers.\n. @kyrstenkelly, @brentertz, can you try now? it just worked on my machine. thanks.\n. hello @michaek,\ni kinda agree with that, although i think it would also make sense to parse a attribute [data-bootstrap-switch] instead of the make-switch class as well.\nwhat do you think? would you rather keep your deletion? i'm up for both.\n. furthermore, can you please update the example and README accordingly? thanks.\n. @michaek on some levels, i would tradeoff performance for semantics and cleanliness of the implementation, but you pointed out very well and i utterly agree on letting the devs be in charge of the initialization process.\ncan you replicate the necessary changes following the new folder structure of master branch, sending the updated PR afterwards?\nthank you very much.\n. as for https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/pull/191, @michaek can you please send again the PR? i will accept it immediately. \n. @michaek ok, no problem. i rewrote the lib in coffeescript and manually removed the autoinvocation. thanks anyway.\n. hello @morrow95,\ncan you checkout the version 2.0.0? you don't need the div.make-switch anymore and you have to manually initialize the plugin on your input element.\njavascript\n$('#my-switch').bootstrapSwitch();\nlet me know.\n. @GlynLewis, @morrow95 considering the last comment, is that fixed for you?\n. reopen whenever you need.\n. hi @michaek,\ni would kindly ask you to update again your PR after the changes i pushed on develop. it shouldn't be hard to sync yours. let me know if you don't agree on something.\ncheers.\n. @michaek as you prefer. besides, can you please submit me a PR with the addition of grunt? thanks.\n. amazing. thank you very much. keep going!\n. it is coming out along with version 2.0.0. if you need it immediately / are impatient, download the build of 2.0.0 branch.\n. i think it's a pretty narrow user case and it has no real foundation in the UI/UX design principles. since the toggle switch is generally bounded to a non-destructive action and the input label should always been present along, i don't consider this feature worthwhile, even because it would require a considerable amount of refactoring and restructuring.\n. hello @yybcjq,\nthe API to create the switch in version 2.0.0 has changed. the website is currently outdated. instead of this:\nhtml\n<div class=\"make-switch switch-large\">\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" checked>\n</div>\nyou write this:\nhtml\n<input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"my-switch\" checked class=\"switch-large\">\nand you manually instantiate the switch, selecting the element with jquery\njavascript\n$(\"#my-switch\").bootstrapSwitch();\n. i tried and it works for me. check this out\nfeel free to reopen this and send me a playground link in case you won't solve the issue.\n. @jgirdner good one. in fact, you can even inject your html input in the dom and initialize bootstrap switch later, as you already actually did.\n. thanks @patbaker82,\nare you using the mixins.less included in this repo for the compilation? if yes, try to use the mixins.less provided by bootstrap itself and tell me.\n. the double inclusion is exactly what i thought it would be.\nlet me know if there are any further issue regarding this case.\nthank you very much.\n. @stefandroog yes, i was thinking about that yesterday. my point here is: what about telling grunt to add those two lines on-the-fly when the css build process is triggered?\nlet me know what you think.\n. @stefandroog @patbaker82 done in v3\n. hi @liesislukas,\nthanks for your contribution. i would kindly ask you to fix your PR as following:\n- target it to develop branch instead of master. close this PR and open another one\n- changing the build is not enough. you need to make your changes on the coffeescript source and use grunt to generate the new build files. ask me more info if you need\n- if you feel to, remove the addition of the class to the wrapper children and change the css so that these inner elements have different rules depending on the wrapper class.\nlet me know.\n. @liesislukas ok, nevermind. i can easily take over this. thanks!\n. thanks @starhorst, fixed in develop\n. thanks @GrahamCampbell \n. @GrahamCampbell done.\n. @biancalana i'm currently pretty busy and anybody else can tackle this issue right now.\ni'll try my best to deliver something in a reasonable amount of time, but i would suggest you to ahead trying some workaround. nonetheless, stay in touch because i want to fix this within the next minor release 2.0.1.\n. @biancalana first of all, you included the index.js of the bootstrap.js page in your jsfiddle. this means that everytime the jsfiddle loads, it also execute this: \njavascript\n// initialize all the inputs\n$('input[type=\"checkbox\"],[type=\"radio\"]').not('#create-switch').bootstrapSwitch();\nthis initializes ALL the checkbox or radio buttons in you document, event the one inside #Template. therefore, when you clone template, you change its id and that messes things up internally.\ni prepared you a jsfiddle with some changes. take a look: http://jsfiddle.net/Vcqx4/\nfirstly, the initialization of the first input is manually done calling .bootstrapSwitch() (no need of call setDisabled, false if the input has not the disable attribute).\nsecondly, the bootstrapSwitch() init on the input inside the template is done only when #Template is cloned and only after you dinamically change the id of the input.\nlet me know if it's everything clear.\n. hello @pkuczynski,\nthe outline you see simulates the focus state a checkbox can normally receive. it's a desired behaviour. to change the appearance of the focus, simply override the css, removing the blue border and shadow. do you think is that enough for you?\n. @pkuczynski that's how it is rendered on chrome + osx:\n\nthe border can be customized and the css rules used for the :focus state are directly from the bootstrap 3 mixins. i personally think it is esthetically coherent with bootstrap appearance.\n. @pkuczynski in regards, feel free to checkout the branch 2.1 and to get back at me.\n. @asivaneswaran thanks for the advice.\ni don't know how to make it right now and i'm pretty busy on other issues as well.\nit'd be nice if you can give me some more implementation details or pseudo-code so we discuss and develop this more quickly.\nlet me know.\n. @asivaneswaran done. set the new option inverse to true to have the two handles (sides) swapped. coming out with v3.1.0.\n. hello @putnik,\ncan you please reopen this PR against master branch? then i'll take care myself of updating gh-pages.\nthanks.\n. @GrahamCampbell yep, my mistake. sorry.\n. @trick77 i'm aware of that. i'm trying to fix all the little issues for the version 2.1.0.\n. @trick77 checkout branch 2.1 and let me know if it's what you expected. to me, it could be considered fixed.\n. @whicks1 sorry for the late answer. good call. however, this would increase the instantiation logic and i'm concerned about the performance.\nalso, if we allow to have different kind of starting element other than a checkbox, we might want to include the bootstrap single button as component, with toggle button functionality attached.\ni'll think about that. drop any other proposals or thoughts on this here.\n. @whicks1 does @b3457m0d3's solution solve your problem?\n. @erswelljustin please, open a PR with the example added to Example page of the web page. thanks.\n. hello @nwhite89,\ni made this change on develop branch but i didn't committed the changes yet.\nthanks for the PR #213.\n. hello @nwhite89, thank you. two points:\n- can you make the PR against develop instead of master?\n- what do you think about renaming the file bootstrap-switch-base.less in build.less? it seems to me clearer.\n. @nwhite89 thank you!\n. @nwhite89 i asked you to change the name to build, not base, but i wouldn't be that picky.\nthank you!\n. @SergeyBarskiy would you suggest the changes to make in order to enable the compatibility with angularjs? \n. @SergeyBarskiy thanks, i'll insert a link in the README and documentation.\n. @SergeyBarskiy please, update the directive so that the 3rc version is supported. thanks.\n. @SergeyBarskiy the fix you suggested is invalid: the checkbox has to remain visible (therefore focusable). it is like this by design. the default tab navigation flow should include it.\nif you get to solve that issue in another way, let me know.\n. @frapontillo lovely, thanks. can you please add the options to override the classes? you can take a look at the updated 3.0 source and this issue.\n. @frapontillo if you want, update this thread when the compatibility is assured. in the meantime, i add a link to your project in the README. thanks. \n. @frapontillo version 3.0.0 in master branch. if you are ready, feel free to publish the angular directive.\n. @frapontillo is the API of the alpha.2 updated according to version 3.0.0?\n@JumpLink the module you suggested is very outdated. \n. @JumpLink ok, i'll add your link in the README\n. @Se0ng11 can you try the new branch 3.0?\n. @Se0ng11 you are welcome. sorry for the late :+1: \n. hello @phreakbg,\ncan you give me a concrete real case where this new state would be helpful? moreover, the checkbox semantic value represents the boolean logic, and HTML doesn't provide any three-state element.\nwhat are your thoughts about?\n. @phreakbg if the switch is neither yes or no, it does and should not represent any other value (which is semantically conflicting with the meaning of indeterminate state you have in mind).\nmoreover, it would be pretty difficult to imagine a consistent way to visually represent the state. also, the new state is not compatible with the checkbox itself, so in case of destroy you loose the state.\nwhy not use readonly/disable instead? based on your example, you can have two switch: the first to indicate the inheritance and the second, disabled/readonly by default, to indicate the permissions. the second is active only if the first is on.\nlet me know.\n. @phreakbg that's a good one! i wasn't aware of the vanilla support for 'indeterminate' state. i'll add this to version 3.0. how do you think it would be best represented in the toggle switch, visually speaking?\nthank you for pointing it out.\n. @phreakbg it makes sense.\n. @phreakbg check https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/commit/5ad1e1700008f46f48b8c751790bb9261ceb12e9 and tell me what you think.\nas for now, you can only activate the indeterminate state through passing it as init option or calling the method bootstrapSwitch('indeterminate', true | false);\nfor the moment, in case you want to implement the tri-state behaviour on slide, you have to do it manually.\n. @johnowenatala fixed in version 3.0 (3dbe39aa9fdef2c4f2bda9895ecd192d424046d3), it will be released soon.\n. hello @Guaph,\nI'll accept the PR if you follow these steps:\n- checkout branch 2.1\n- apply changes also for bootstrap 2 less source\n- set the border radius on the correct side of the label (left or right), based on the switch state\n- close the PR, reopen it against branch 2.1\n. fixed in branch 3.0, coming out in resonable time.\n. @uksparky yes, the event has been renamed.\nthe 2.1 is not production-ready at the moment. for instance, the toggle radio functionality has not been ported yet. consequently, the version number is not updated. \n. @uksparky for your interest, i've decided to rename the branch to 3.0.\n. @virus006 fixed in branch 3.0. it will be release soon.\n. @kevinsproles you can you do it yourself: submit a PR to cdnjs asking to change that specific version . i cannot do it within some days. if you are fine with this amount of time, let me know.\n. @GrahamCampbell not yet, check the thread.\n. @GrahamCampbell lovely, thank you.\n. @stefanocudini can you indicate me the fix to apply? i would really preserve the usage of the class switch as the main class to identify the wrapper. but i need to understand if, in this or other specific cases, the declared class is effectively interpreted as a reserved word or not.\n. @stefanocudini \ni see. sorry, this morning i didn't notice the parenthesis and self-call towards the end.\nwhat i don't understand is why meteor refuse to run the logic if not executed inside a lambda. i suppose it is a security-related issue. can you investigate further?\nin the meantime, i apply the changes to the coffee source in order to wrap the portion of code.\ngrazie. :+1: \n. @stefanocudini done in a8b8427d04dd3eb1461872c7c7c84369396cd3de. check it out.\n. duplicated of https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/221 and https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/219. thank you anyway.\n. firstly, the names in the description are inverted. secondly, the event has been renamed in v3.0 (following the camelCase convention).\n. @zstars indeed, the doc is currently using 3.0. if you make a PR to fix the second event name both in the htm and index.js, i will accept it.\nthank you.\n. @zstars :+1: sweet\n. @GrahamCampbell @christopher-s that seems necessary to me as well.\nwhat do you think about namespacing also the other classes or it might be too much?\n. fixed in a8b8427d04dd3eb1461872c7c7c84369396cd3de.\n. @nofear87 add a second parameter true. this will skip the event triggering. though, it has to be documented. thank you.\n. it is possible to include the file bootstrap-switch.less and compile the switches with your site-wide variables. it's included in 3.0. if you need to do this in 2.*, you have to manually remove the first two lines from the less source.\n. @nwhite89 develop branch is currently behind 3.0.\n. @nwhite89 nope, i just updated the readme to promote the beta usage of the version 3.0, that's it. :+1: \n. @nofear87 thank you, i haven't tried the switch properly on mobile browsers yet. which version of safari are you using?\n. @nofear87 i tried with the iOS simulator (iOS7), the checkboxes are correctly hidden. it must happen  only to a older version of safari. anyway, i fixed it setting the checkbox opacity to 0. thanks. \n. @blagojvasilevski yes. i'll make both docs available as soon as possible.\n. available from https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/commit/e6f35e82fac801fafce10e54cc7dc4ad240fb54f. thanks.\n. @blueskysd which version are you using?\n. @blueskysd yes, develop is now part of 3.0 and the online documentation is about the latter. please follow the topic here. thanks.\n. @optimix-designer man, sorry, i'm the only one trying to keep things going here. would you take a look at the source and give a help? i'll look at the issue\n. @optimix-designer don't worry, i just need more time to go through all the issues. i'm sorry if i forgot about yours. tomorrow i'll take a look!\n. @optimix-designer sorry, i couldn't take a look because my android is dead. is there any way to emulate the specific condition?\n. @optimix-designer perhaps a browser bug related to the pure rendering? i cannot figure out what it really is either.\n. @optimix-designer feel free to reopen / comment as soon as you find a solution or something changes. thanks.\n. @zilions is this the same of https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/249?\n. @zilions ok, i'll take a look as soon as possible\n. @zilions continue the discussion here. reopen this if it's not the same.\n. @RapidHunter do you mean to move the title from the input to the wrapper div during initialization? can you tell me a reason why the library should incorporate this feature?\n. continue the discussion here, thanks.\n. @hughanderson4 in version 3.0, the checkbox is focusable because not hidden. moreover, when focused, you can use the spacebar or arrow keys to toggle its state. nonetheless, thanks anyway for your proposal.\n. @adayth as pointed out in the docs, register your listener to switchChange instead of the default change. thank you.\n. @ppavlik26 i was aware of this, however it has to be tackle. i will try your fix and let you know here, thank you.\n. done in 6827b0e27dcea572a272df83617bc7a19fd33b6d. thank you very much @ppavlik26 .\n. @Se0ng11 which browser version? i wasn't able to reproduce the issue. can you provide me a jsfiddle or playground so i can take a look at it?\n. @Se0ng11 reopen if you come to spot it again.\n. check #225\n. @SkeLLLa right now, the library requires jQuery >= 1.9.0. should we make it compatible to a older version, in your opinion?\n. @SkeLLLa ok, thanks. i don't decide how to compile the coffee, but i can discover if there is a way to prevent that or directly refactor it.\n. @SkeLLLa can you please let me know if now it's working? 087be6375b8329b4a7f58671724f369a5c1a12f3\n. @SkeLLLa up\n. at first, i imagined it was due to the assignation of a function to the property of the object passed to jQuery for the initialization. after this, i figure out it might be because of .addClass() not accepting function, or something similar.\nwhat's the next step?\n. @SkeLLLa can you please try it now?\n. @SkeLLLa that's another one. finally close. thanks! \n. @SkeLLLa it is like that because the jQuery object bootstrapSwitch is attached to references multiple elements. let me understand, is running a specific logic on only one of the element of the set your goal? if so, you need to register the switchChange handler using a more specific jQuery selector.\nis this what you want?\n. @SkeLLLa no worries. i suppose you are right and the custom event doesn't work as, in my opinion, should. reopen if we need to fix something, thanks.\n. @raveren you can get the external switch wrapper and attach the tooltip to it in two ways:\naccessing the internal element reference:\njavascript\n// after initialization\n$mySwitch.data('bootstrap-switch').$wrapper.tooltip({\n  // your tooltip options\n});\nif your switch has an id, directly selecting it using the class prefixed as  bootstrap-switch-id-;\njavascript\n// after initialization\n$('.bootstrap-switch-id-my-switch-id').tooltip({\n  // your tooltip options\n});\nremember that if you destroy the instance of bootstrapSwitch, the wrapper is deleted and the tooltip as well.\nis anything clear?\n. @raveren don't worry, i need opinions on the whole project to keep it going.\nwhat it could be done is:\n- document the fact that the library adhere to the bootstrap plugin pattern, which keep the api incapsulated and protected but still fully accessible\n- add a callback function as new option to be executed right after initialization.\njavascript\n$(\"[name='my-checkbox']\").bootstrapSwitch({\n  onInit: function(element) {\n    // stuff\n  }\n});\nhowever, i wouldn't expose the wrapper element because i'd need to expose all the other elements (on and off buttons, central label and original element) for the sake of coherence.\ni think it should be enough.\nthoughts?\n. @raveren perfect, i'm gonna add the callback to the options and as event to subscribe to.\n. @raveren can you try the latest version? you can set your callback on init in two ways:\njavascript\n$(\"[name='my-checkbox']\").bootstrapSwitch({\n  on: {\n    init: function() {\n      // stuff\n    }\n  }\n});\nor\njavascript\n$(\"[name='my-checkbox']\")\n.on('init', function() {\n  // stuff\n}).\nbootstrapSwitch();\n. @raveren i pushed an updated version (08aa834b2b8eca006f642b2b2e0fa62e248eb044). try and tell me if it works as expected.\nthe callback options are now onInit and onSwitchChange.\nthe event triggered you can register to are init.bootstrapSwitch and switchChange.bootstrapSwitch. both have the element accessible with this and the first named parameter is the jquery normalized event.\nlet me know.\n. @raveren i haven't verified the content of the event object generated by jQuery. doesn't it contain the target (the input element)?\n. perfect. let me know if there is something missing.\n. @edragame \nthe docs refers to 3.0, the event name has been changed.\nhttps://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/222\ndocs for 2.0.1 will be put online again soon.\n. @qq412796770 it's explained here and here.\ni adjusted the mini and small widths to -1px each, so that the gap is not so evident. though, there seem not to be a proper solution for this.\n1f597e0398d899dd667b56d5b0fbcdc45f2b3602\n. @qq412796770 i guess that would lead internet explorer to fuck up everything, due to its round-up policy. can you try for me? \n. a simple possible workaround to achieve that would be storing your new default onText in a variables instead of rewriting it:\n``` javascript\nvar myOnText = 'My On Text';\n// apply myOnText to all the inputs to instantiate\n$('#my-checkbox').bootstrapSwitch({\n  onText: myOnText\n});\n$('#my-second-checkbox').bootstrapSwitch({\n  onText: myOnText\n});\n```\nalternatively, if you are using a template engine, set a variable and use it in the data attribute:\nhtml\n<input id=\"my-checkbox\" name=\"my-checkbox\" checked data-on-text=\"{{ myOnText }}\">\n<input id=\"my-second-checkbox\" name=\"my-second-checkbox\" checked data-on-text=\"{{ myOnText }}\">\nnonetheless, of course, i will consider to expose the library defaults in order to be overridable.\nthanks.\n. @atuzovic done in b6415f3abcfd0b5d3dbd03b14c691a1853b47df1. checkout branch 3.0 now!\n. @mreis1 check https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/225 and the end of https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/185\n. maybe a quick search would have helped you: https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/219, https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/221, https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/226.\ncheers.\n. @DareDevil73 check https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/240, join the discussion there please.\n. @pytkin i can add as many new options as the element the library internally creates and manages, so we also solve https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/255. something in the fashion of this:\njavascript\n{\n  classes: {\n    wrapper: 'bootstrap-switch-wrapper',\n    div: 'bootstrap-switch-div', // the inner div\n    handleOn: 'bootstrap-switch-handle-on',\n    handleOff: 'bootstrap-switch-handle-off',\n    label: 'bootstrap-switch-label'\n  }\n}\nor this:\njavascript\n{\n  classesPrefix: 'bootstrap-switch',\n  classes: {\n    wrapper: 'wrapper',\n    div: 'div', // the inner div\n    handleOn: 'handle-on',\n    handleOff: 'handle-off',\n    label: 'label'\n  }\n}\nthoughts?\n. @pytkin that seems to me a bit overwhelming. can we keep it a bit simpler?\nfirst of all, i received complaints about the fact that the prefix switch is not enough to assure no class conflicts. secondly, why the modifiers have to be customizable? if you need to extend or override the animate class, for instance, just do this:\n``` less\n.bootstrap-switch-animate {\n\ndiv {\n    .transition(margin-left .25s); // bootstap-mixin\n  }\n}\n```\n\nam i wrong?\n. @pytkin i tried to take your suggestions and combine them to obtain the highest flexibility level and the most coincise and clear piece of code possible. i came up with this:\njavascript\n{\n  classes: {\n    base: 'bootstrap-switch', // string, prepended to any classes\n    wrapper: 'wrapper', // string | array\n    handleOn: 'handler-on', // string | array\n    handleOff: 'handler-off', // string | array\n    label: 'label', // string | array\n    modifiers: {\n      animate: 'animate', // string\n      disabled: 'disabled', // string\n      readonly: 'readonly' // string\n    }\n  }\n}\nwhat do you think? am i missing something?\n. - you can set a string (single class) or an array of classes to be applied to the wrapper and the other inner elements\n- allright, i rewrite it:\njavascript\n{\n  classes: {\n    base: 'bootstrap-switch', // string, prepended to any classes\n    wrapper: 'wrapper', // string | array\n    handleOn: 'handler-on', // string | array\n    handleOff: 'handler-off', // string | array\n    label: 'label', // string | array\n    modifiers: {\n      on: 'on', // string\n      off: 'off', // string\n      focused: 'focused', // string\n      animate: 'animate', // string\n      disabled: 'disabled', // string\n      readonly: 'readonly' // string\n    }\n  }\n}\nis that ok now?\n. @pytkin sorry, i'm not sure i'm understanding.\n. you will be able to render the two classes (as specified in your second example) like this:\njavascript\n{\n  classes: {\n    wrapper: ['wrapper', 'square']\n  }\n}\nis it clear?\n. exactly. do you want to add a class to the label?\njavascript\n{\n  classes: {\n    wrapper: ['wrapper', 'square'],\n    label: ['label', 'custom-class']\n  }\n}\ncovered.\n. @pytkin dude, it was just an example. and add the possibility to add classes to the \"> div\" seems to me unuseful.\n. @pytkin we are not understand each other: the \"div\" is the only structural element that has no purpose to be customized with extra class. the \"label\" element, the opposite. i can accept to make the \"div\" classes customizable for the sake of coherence, but not remove the label classes. \n. @pytkin then we need to find a more semantic name for the 'div' before allowing this.\n. @pytkin container is perfect. thanks!\n. @pytkin updated lib in https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/commit/d271ae7bf3f27c54edf7b7f4c38149fbef2c193f. the multiple classes has still to be developed. coming tomorrow.\n. @pytkin https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/commit/65a2f421f8ff55542819c0c9f15e6ce1357e2bb6 i decided to put all the classes-related options to the first level of the option object and added support for array of classes. try it out and tell me. close here.\n. @frapontillo as you may notice, they are applied to the 5 internal elements created by the library: wrapper, container, handleOn, handleOff and label. the modifiers are all applied to the wrapper (top-level container).\n. enhanced flexibilty and avoid the risk that your custom operations won't break when the library is updated.\n. @frapontillo discuss about it with @pytkin, reach an agreement and let me know what to do. i'm up for everything, even discard the new options. :+1: \n. next week i'd like to release the 3.0. can you reach a point until then?\n. @frapontillo yes, it's in 3.0 branch.\n. sorry, but it seems stange to me: why would you do that?\n. @frapontillo ok, makes sense then, i'll add this. in the meantime, discuss about the issue, even though i'm starting to think that overidding all the internal elements is tendentially irrelevant as you pointed out.\n. @frapontillo indeed, i agree.\n. as a string (\"wrapper\") or array to be accepted by wrapperClass options.\n. @frapontillo check the latest version out.\n. @frapontillo no, i excluded them.\n. @frapontillo you suggested me to leave those classes there and adding the methods to override them.\n\nI would need the following methods:\nonModifierClass\noffModifierClass\nfocusedModifierClass\nanimateModifierClass\ndisabledModifierClass\nreadonlyModifierClass\n. ok, then i'll toss them out.\n. @frapontillo that's a good one. can you open two separate issues for the classes removal and this last one, then close this issue? thanks. \n. ok\n. continue the discussion here\n. @joeauty duplicated of https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/222, do a research first please.\n. @TomerW is this what you want to achieve?\n. confirmed. i'll work on it here, thanks.\n. @IPWright83 is this invalid?\n. @IPWright83 open your browser developer tools and verify if, in fact, the issue you are experiencing is #245. if yes, update to the latest release and close this topic. thanks.\n. close here. get back at me if it's not fixed.\n. @deejross i reopened the issue. let's continue the discussion there. thanks.\n. @eekboom can you please verify that it's not already being fixed here?\n. @eekboom if you want to submit a pull request, it would be much appreciated. thanks.\n. @eekboom up\n. @eekboom closing, reopen if needed.\n. what about this? http://jsfiddle.net/nRLaE/\n. @h-sobhy i frankly have no clue.\n. @h-sobhy insightful, thanks. can you open a new issue for this?\n. @cvsguimaraes thanks for the contribution.\ncan you please update the coffeescript, run gulp build or gulp coffee and resubmit the PR?\n. @cvsguimaraes sorry, i made a mistake in closing the PR prematurely and forgetting about it. can you open it again against develop branch? i'll accept it immediately. #284\n. @h-sobhy can you please give it a try and get back at me? \n. @h-sobhy this is how it works now: http://jsfiddle.net/nRLaE/6/. the operator has been changed from greater to lower than. thanks for the contribution!\n. @tomichou the issue doesn't seem to appear in the new documentation page of the branch 3.0 http://cl.ly/image/2z3L400H0T3L. this is very strange. would you suggest me a fix that doesn't impact on other browsers?\n. @tomichou @seeley60 can one of you add the css rule, test that everything works properly and submit a pull request against branch 3.0?\n. @tomichou @seeley60 up\n. close here for the moment. feel free to submit a PR.\n. @jasin08 i'm almost sure i don't get what you're asking, but to change the state of the switch you'd use:\n\njavascript\n$('#my-checkbox').bootstrapSwitch('state', true, true);\nthe switchChange event is not triggered if you set the second argument as true.\nhope it helps.\n. @jasin08 news?\n. @jasin08 feel free to reopen if you have news.\n. @gslender are you using version 2.0.1 or 3.0?\n. @gslender .html(), as opposed to .text(), allows you to inject html. can you provide me a jsfiddle to try this case out? \n. do a quick search of other issues of this repository. i've previously created some jsfiddles with js and css inline.\n. @gslender check first if you have correctly included font awesome. regardless, wait for your update then :+1: \n. @mabasic a quick check to the open issues wouldn't have hurt. https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/236.\nthank you for the appreciation.\n. @mabasic that's a good one, i confused the version number. thanks.\n. @daverogers @raveren i opened a branch for it, but it will take some time since it requires many parts to be rewritten.\n. @ryantate13 what do you mean by 'label'? are you referring to the internal element between on and off or as @fandasson and @jakobdo said, an external <label> element?\n. @jakobdo we are talking about the internal label (created by bootstrap switch), not the html label element.\n. @vinhphucgs the plugin does not support IE <= 8. if you give me a reason to do so that is strong enough, we can discuss about it.\n. i'm sorry, i thought about it a while and i realized that IE7 is too outdated. it would be painful to develop case-specific solutions in order to support it. my suggestion is: download the source of the plugin, play with it and see if you can make it working.\ni hope you understand my position. thanks anyway.\n. @GRPS have you included the bootstrap variables and mixins files?\n. @GRPS up\n. @GRPS closing here. feel free to reopen.\n. wow, i'd update all those poor guys' machines one by one instead of increasing the project development time by 220% just to support two sad dinosaurs.\nthat being said, i think there isn't any caveat in removing the e.preventDefault(), but don't expect full backward support for IE < 8 in the future.\n. @annames can you do me the favour of checking if the issue has been solved using develop branch source?\n. @annames up\n. closing here. reopen once verified that the issue has not been solved. \n. @jakobdo listen to switchChange.bootstrapSwitch instead of switchChange. docs to be updated.\n. check this. thanks, the docs will be updated online soon.\n. sorry guys, fixed some minutes ago.\n. i've reopened https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/216, please comment there. thanks.\n. thanks!\n. @frapontillo i want the method to be just wrapperClass. it returns the value if the arguments is undefined, otherwise it sets it. can you do that and submit again the PR? thanks\n. @frapontillo \njavascript\nbootstrapSwitch('wrapperClass'); // returns the current wrapperClass value\nbootstrapSwitch('wrapperClass', undefined); // returns the current wrapperClass value\nbootstrapSwitch('wrapperClass', null); // sets the default wrapperClass ('wrapper')\nbootstrapSwitch('wrapperClass', ''); // sets the default wrapperClass ('wrapper')\nbootstrapSwitch('wrapperClass', 'myNewClassname'); // sets the give value\nbasically, if typeof value is 'undefined' for the first two cases, if not value for the third and fourth case and    the last as instruction if the execution does not enter in the first two ifs. \n. you little nerd. accepted.\n. @n1ghtmare thanks for the intervention. yes, what you illustrate should be the correct behaviour. i referenced the issue to a important ignored PR. i apologize, this must have been already in master. check the PR for future developments.\n. @ahumphreys87 is that a common behaviour in other plugins? furthermore, is that also common in bootstrap plugins? if yes, i have nothing against accepting this.\nthough, in case, i'd need a further change in order to accept the PR: do not create a named object to pass to the extend function, instead define it directly as third parameters. i guess you can write something like\ncoffeescript\n@options = $.extend {}, $.fn.bootstrapSwitch.defaults,\n  state: @$element.is \":checked\"\n  size: @$element.data \"size\"\n  animate: @$element.data \"animate\"\n  disabled: @$element.is \":disabled\"\n  readonly: @$element.is \"[readonly]\"\n  onColor: @$element.data \"on-color\"\n  offColor: @$element.data \"off-color\"\n  onText: @$element.data \"on-text\"\n  offText: @$element.data \"off-text\"\n  labelText: @$element.data \"label-text\"\n  baseClass: @$element.data \"base-class\"\n  wrapperClass: @$element.data \"wrapper-class\"\n, options\naldo, it'd have to be targetted to develop branch instead of master (as specified in CONTRIBUTING.md)\nlet me know. \n. @atuzovic can you register to nuget website, pack the library and upload it for me?\n. thanks @tomascassidy, i'm gonna add it to the readme.\n. @nocaremc thanks for the contribution. i think your codebase was outdated when you started working on this, since it's been fixed some time ago. can you verify?\n. @ChezMose why is the .form-control class needed in your case?\n. @ChezMose add a custom rule like following and all should be fine (bootstrap 3):\ncss\ninput[type=\"checkbox\"].form-control {\n  height: auto;\n}\n. fixed (https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/commit/753dfea35d9c8d101ae35c63faf18b830dcd6cf1), thanks\n. bootstrap-switch mini has a min-width set as 71px, not 100px.\nanyway, override the css property in your stylesheet as follow:\ncss\n.bootstrap-switch.bootstrap-switch-mini {\n  min-width: 50px; // or smaller\n}\nlet me know.\n. @smlombardi @Gary-Li was the proposed solution enough?\n. close here. thank you.\n. @cvsguimaraes i have no idea why this happens. in my chrome (~36) the opacity applied to the external wrapper works as expected. waiting for additional details.\n. thank you guys for the in-depth look.\nshould i move the transform property to the wrapper now and release a hotfix or we wait for the  chrome patch to be out?\n. @cvsguimaraes forcing the hardware accelleration http://davidwalsh.name/translate3d\n. @cvsguimaraes see https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/249. thanks.\n. the reason why this does not work is illustrated in https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/205.\ncheck the updated jsfiddle. i removed the popover part and focused only on the qtip implementation. as you can see, you have to initialize the switch the first time, only when qtip has consolidatde the content.\nan issue still remains: how to prevent the tooltip to disappear on switch change. if you don't mind, that's on you.\nhope it helps.\n. @pauloortins thanks! approved.\nfew notes:\n- register your package in bower\n- add a direct link in the README description to this project \n. @pauloortins thanks. can you provide a pull request for this?\n. @morgunder i'd go for the second one. nonetheless, the camelCase/dash-case conventions is followed by other big projects, that's why i expected it to be clear.\nno problem. thanks for the suggestion.\n. @morgunder done, it will be included in the next minor version. thanks!\n. great job, but i cannot accept it straight away: you defined the handler in the wrong method. it should instead appended at the end of labelHandler.\ncan you please make the change and submit again? thanks! \n. well done. thanks!\n. @NgYueHong i agree. i will updated the README accordingly. in the meantime, if by any chance you find yourself play around with the lib source and get to identify what's missing supporting IE8, let me know here. thanks. \n. if you are using v.2.0.1, it's data-on-label. in v.3, it's data-on-text. the documentation is correct.\n. @rexdf indeed, attach your properties to .bootstrap-switch-label.\n. i tried to reproduce it with no luck: http://jsfiddle.net/2frGt/.\ncheck if there are other possible conditions related.\n. @mwlang would you update the jsfiddle in order to reproduce the issue and get back at me? thanks a lot.\n. i haven't been able to reproduce the mentioned case. closing here. feel free to reopen anytime.\n. @matstc fixed in v3.0.1, the latest version. thanks anyway.\n. hello @edgarRd,\nyou are correct, at the moment there is no way to perform operation before the switch has been changed. furthermore, i see this related to https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/268. join the discussion there, i consider that a major one.\n. @JulianNorton feel free to add examples to the docs and submit a PR. would you be up for it?\n. @JulianNorton so?\n. @JulianNorton nevermind, shipped in https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/commit/dc3a8c26a2d20eb96f0d9788db4c26ddfc44252d.\nfeel free to add ones relative to the other uncovered options.\n. @pauloortins lovely again, thank you very much. i will accept with the tradeoff of a small change: invert the position of the methods in the code, onInit should come before onSwitchChange.\nclose the PR, open a new one and it will all be done.\n. hi @plribeiro3000. you can now download the lib from updated master or tag v3.0.1.\n. @srkgupta can you tell me platform, browser and browser version?\n. @srkgupta sorry, i didn't read the description properly and didn't notice you tried to make use of the api. in v3, instead of:\njs\n$(\"[name=download-version]\").bootstrapSwitch('setDisabled',true);\nuse:\njs\n$(\"[name=download-version]\").bootstrapSwitch('disabled', true);\ncheers.\n. @srkgupta the documentation is actually updated.\n. good morning @plribeiro3000,\nthank your for the detailed case. can you update the jsfiddle with the version 3.0.1? you have to copy/paste it since it's been released yesterday and not available on cdn yet.\n. @plribeiro3000 can you update the bootstrap switch source of the jsfiddle according to the latest develop branch changes? i made a couple of optimizations and they might have implicitly solved this issue. thanks.\n. @psychonelo @plribeiro3000 thank you very much for the collaboration. feel free to give the updated  develop branch a ride and tell me.\n. @okitu done, thanks you. https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/commit/263e83c39c90c5697265de45b62391b242f1dc0d\n. @pauloortins great, thanks!\n. @DASPRiD thanks, it will be released with v3.0.2. try it out from develop branch.\n. @ka7eh did you close it on mistake?\n. @gdw2 always search before posting. https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/289.\nhowever, given that it's a common case of use, i will integrate the css line to the library css from v3.0.2.\n. hi @umedbisht,\ni checked if the proposed pattern matches with official bootstrap plugins one. it does. to be released with the next minor version. thanks. \n. @root-talis thank you for the contribution.\none thing: bootstrap-switch, prior to version 3, has an option that permit or not the uncheck functionality for radio inputs. it would be nice to have it back in one of the next version.\nif you want to dive into it, feel free and go ahead. \n. duplicate of #268. join the discussion. thanks\n. hi @root-talis, thanks a lot for the contribution.\nyes, i have a couple of requests:\n- rename allowAllOff in  radioAllOff. it feels to me more clear to understand\n- add the new option to documentation-3 page of the docs. works in jade, gulp will spit out the HTML for you\nyou can update / reopen the PR and i'll accept it straight away.\n. @root-talis great job, thanks!\n. fixed in https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/318, to be released with version 3.0.2. thanks.\n. @duhanov Sorry BE Understandable!\n. what is your code? can you attach me a jsfiddle?\n. @duhanov to be closed in few days if there won't be any follow-up.\n. @metalpietie what plugins, for curiosity?\n. @metalpietie it does not seem directly related. feel free to comment for further developments, for the moment i close it. \n. @jichifly fixed in develop branch, to be released with 3.0.2. next time, please do a research among the issues before.\n. @KaduAmaral can you suggest me a real case when this would effectively be helpful?\n. @KaduAmaral if you use LESS, you can import the variables of Yeti theme and bootstrap-switch.less will compile so that the switch will look like the buttons.\nif you instead are using plain CSS, i suggest you to manually override the properties like following:\nless\n.bootstrap-switch-handle-on.bootstrap-switch-primary {\n  // set here color and background-color\n}\ni don't advocate the use of bootstrap classes since we don't want to build a direct relation between the properties of the switch handles and the ones of bootstrap buttons.\nthanks for being part of the discussion.\n. @GamalTawaf README!\n. @atuzovic fixed in https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/312\n. @mmuelle4 this is very strange. the two methods you said you are calling are not implicitly triggering the init event. can you provide me an example? \n. @mmuelle4 up.\n. check the edited example: http://jsfiddle.net/rdvy750h/\ninstead of setting the state programmatically on init, why don't you just set the checked checkbox property as the value you get from the ajax call, before initialising the checkbox?\n. @mmuelle4 did you take a look at the forked example?\n. @mmuelle4 closing here, let me know if everything works the way i suggested.\n. @DSpeichert state returns the element bootstrap-switch's instance is bound to. on premise, it should work. can you provide me a playground link so we can verify it?\n. @DSpeichert for some reasons, some changes that have been brought in v3.0.1, such as onSwitchChange as method, aren't available in the cdnjs distributed version. to fix your problem, just pass the callback in the init options. http://jsfiddle.net/4Vr7L/1/\nfurthermore, update to the latest version v3.0.2.\n. https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/pull/315, perhaps it's been integrated in the codebase after 3.0.1 release. anyway, can you try the 3.0.2?\n. @sagikazarmark bower.json in version 3.0.1 does not ignore the src folder, which contains the less files. can you double check it?\n. you can verify by yourself: https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/blob/v3.0.1/bower.json\ndid you perform bower cache clean, just to guess?\n. @mmuelle4 fixed in develop, to be shipped in v3.0.2.\n. @maxime-rainville in your example, i don't get the possible look'n'feel issue. all seems fine to me.\n@jurgenvo can you provide me a concrete example i can investigate?\n. @jurgenvo @maxime-rainville @guanxun asserting that this issue is directly related with the modal is inaccurate, if not even misleading. also, i could not reproduce the issue as it has been explained.\ninstead, i remembered that i dealt with it in the scope of https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/249 , check that out.\nif you can try out, can you tell me if @adrianscott83 's proposed solution solves the problem?\nthanks. \n. @sotarules there is a fix to be released in 3.2.3 that removes the initial animation and set the correct state when the switch becomes visible after being hidden on initialisation. you can therefore safely init your switch even before the modal is opened.\nyou might also want to check out this https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/383.\n. thank you @sotarules for the detailed description.\n@frapontillo hasn't this been introduced by https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/pull/389 ?\n. i think only an additional flag can do the trick. what's your call?\n. let's discuss about it over #411\n. @tubssp thanks for the contribution.\n. hi @Vadorequest, thanks for submitting the issue.\nwhat do you mean by 'linked together'? i cannot understand your case because i don't know how your page source looks like. can you help me out?\n. @Vadorequest because the switches should not be linked even if they possibly have the same names.\n. @Vadorequest if you leverage on such generic selectors as $('.switch'), you cannot pretend the behaviours are not shared. a way to solve your issue would be to initialise all the inputs as you were already doing, but use more specific selector to programmatically call methods further on.\nlet me know if it's clear to you, regardless of the fact you switched to other solutions.\ncheers.\n. @mravery a pull request on the docs is very welcomed.\n. @mravery i will add a FAQ section to the Examples page. you are welcome to submit a PR adding the tips. thanks.\n. @alexmcpherson thanks, good call. as non-native speaker, i do my best but sometimes fail. \n. @Denis007 at the moment it is not possible, but you can vote for this feature to be implemented here or provide a PR. thanks.\n. @jonpond provide me an example of broken switch and i'll do what i can.\n. @jonpond i haven't received any email. can you please attach me a jsbin or jsfiddle instead?\nthough, it seems that everything you want is achievable through playing with CSS. bear in mind that i don't offer direct support on implementation cases like this one, unless it becomes useful to know for other users.\n. @jonpond received, thanks.\nsorry for the late reply. this is a major change, because a lot of logic that is now under the CSS will have to be moved to the javascript init. i will try to make it happen for version 3.2.0. thanks for understanding.\n. done, it is now in develop and will be released with 3.2.0. thanks\n. @jonpond 30 minutes ago. :8ball: \nif there are changes to be made on the fly, i am truly up for pushing out minor versions in the next days.\n. yes, it's possible. i prepared you an example: http://jsbin.com/pihigahi/4/edit?html,js,output\ntell me if it's clear enough. thanks.\n. yes. i suppose jsbin validate javascript code with a linter, but the coffeescript output does not need to be validated.\n. @makroxyz \"switchChange\" correctly returns the state boolean as second argument, not an object. can you please verify your case? \n. @makroxyz closing the issue, reply here if you still encounter it.\n. pretty wrong. how can you assure that the input is selectable if you remove it from the DOM focusable elements with display: none?\ncan you verify instead that this is not solved with https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/289?\n. @landy2005 because i need the element to be in the flow of focusable elements and display: none prevents this. sorry, i cannot accept your PR, but indeed i'll look into the related issue.\n. fixed in 3.2.0, to be released soon.\n. yes, it's dramatically outdated.\ntweeted them.\n. @bertyhell they won't reply me, please contact and suggest them to update the documentation. thanks.\n. @marclaporte yes, definetely to do next.\n. @marclaporte what are the requirements for this issue to be completed?\n. @Moolie thanks for posting the issue.\ni found a possible solution: if you add the option helper: 'clone', the problem doesn't occur.\ntake a look at the updated example.\n. @obag can you please change the .jade file and compile with gulp?\n. @obag will do it myself. thanks for the contribution.\n. @mmuelle4 no, that is the wanted behaviour. you cannot change the state of a disabled switch.\n. @asdf404. @bc173  thanks for the warning.\ni tested the switch on firefox 32.0.3, chrome 38.0.2 and safari 7.1 on mac. it works on all of them.\ni haven't tried sorrounding the switch into a label, but it should not matter. however, i'll investigate into the specific cases on those browser versions.\n. please update to version 3.2.0 and tell me if it fixes the problem.\n. @jernejrostan thanks for the quick reply. i will release another minor version to fix it. i will let you updated.\n. @jernejrostan what is the outside markup? i cannot reproduce the problem, the height is correct in my case.\n. @michelem09 3.2.3 is not out yet. i assume you mean 3.2.2.\n. @markmarkoh please update to version 3.2.0 and tell me if it fixes the problem.\n. @markmarkoh close here, let me know if the issue still occur.\n. @pjkundert thanks for the changes. can you fix the conflict so i can accept them?\n. @pjkundert the changes have already been integrated in the core. anyhow, thanks for the proposal.\n. @bc173 you can create your checkbox, listen for switchChange event and update the value of your hidden field consequently. i don't think the library should support this case out of box: if you would not use bootstrap switch, you would still have the same problem with a simple checkbox.\nthoughts? \n. @bc173 closing here, let me know if you manage to sort things out. thanks.\n. @WinnieK fixed and to be released in 3.2.0\n. @Yebach attach me the markup+js initalisation logic, or a playground link. thanks.\n. @TechplexEngineer that might help, but it's not enough to identify the scope of the issue. can you or @Yebach provide me a jsfiddle link or such?\n. @TechplexEngineer @Yebach up\n. @TechplexEngineer @Yebach closing here, feel free to follow up.\n. @sineverba can you please check on the latest version? thanks.\n. @sineverba thanks for the update. i'll take a look soon.\n. @okitu thanks for the contribution. accepted :+1: \n. @vercotux i haven't checked that particular case. is it working as expected?\n. @vercotux ok, we need to tackle that as well then.\n. hi @serjooo,\ncan you provide me a playground link? thanks.\n. @moohkooh do you perhaps have the form-control class applied to the switch checkbox?\n. @moohkooh can you provide me a jsfiddle and OS, browser name and version? thanks.\n. @moohkooh up\n. @siruguri thanks for the contribution! a couple of points:\n- the explanation seems to me a bit intricate. can you make it more concise and clear?\n- there's no mention to the fact that, by default, the -color options provides possible default values which represent the same colors bootstrap exposes. and therefore, this kind of styling is to consider an extension of the built-in bootstrap-switch options\n. @siruguri so?\n. @siruguri i close the PR, but feel free to open another one with the changes i mentioned before. thanks.\n. is it duplicate of https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/359? if yes, it's solved.\nlet me know.\n. @clin407 closing here. in case, reply to bring it up to my attention again.\n. @NazarenoL i don't encounter the bug you mention. which browser are you testing with?\n. @NazarenoL i'll try and get back at you. thanks.\n. @NazarenoL @Krinopotam fixed, shipping with v3.3.0\n. hi @sandeepbalouria,\nyou can plug in your custom logic on switchChange to send your request. then, if you have to switch again the status of the switch without firing custom logic, set the skip flag as true: $('#my-switch').bootstrapSwitch('state', false, true);\nwould this be a solution?\n. @alph486 yes, that is another known issue.\n. @dayoaws i'm currently working on a solution for this case (being able to have the center handle width not dependente by the side handle's one).\n. @dayoaws take a look at the latest version v.3.2.0. you can set a fixed labelWidth value upon initialisation or at any moment after that.\nthank you for the suggestion.\n. @jivinivan the library does not work without jQuery. why should the dependency be out?\n. @jivinivan up\n. @jivinivan that would mean creating a switch component that does not depend on bootstrap either. considering bootstrap-switch maturity, i can start to think about it from v4.0.0.\n. @chaselee so you are using jqLite. you still depend on a library internally used as jquery. why would you remove the jQuery dependency? you just have to not include the jquery file in your JS stack.\n. @chaselee @jivinivan up.\n. @chaselee @jivinivan close. feel free to reply.\n. @joranovski thanks for the proposal.\ni believe that the changes you made are too arbitrary and per-project basis. if you need to add certain text to the switch elements, you can do it with the currently exposed API. there is not need to encapsulate such particular set of visual indicators within public usage css classes.\n. @joranovski no worries, you can always wrap the plugin within a custom module of yours or fork it :+1: \n. @Redhab  @asifmehboob fixed, download v3.2.1. thanks.\n. thanks for submitting the issue.\nthis happens because during bootstrap switch init, if the switch is not visible, the logic that calculate and apply the width to the switch's elements does not work.\nas temporary workaround, you can call the internal method _width() on tab changing, like this:\njavascript\n// on tab changing\n$('#my-switch').bootstrapSwitch('_width');\nlet me know if it helps.\n. @Adspectus the second reported problem is, in fact, this https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/337 so join the discussion there. to avoid the problem, you could temporarily set different names to the checkboxes you are applying the switch to.\n@penihel that's a good job, however we must consider it a workaround.\non the spot, i figured that the switch could automatically listen for change to its visibility status and call _width everytime it is visible. that has many chances to solve the issue.\n. fixed, included in 3.2.2.\n. @PaddySe the issue is not related. please do a search and open a new issue if there isn't any. don't forget to attach a playground link (jsfiddle, codepen..)\n@bcelik it is slower because it makes calculation on init regarding the width to apply to the side handles and the centred label. the same calculation is also performed every time the switch is updated in a way that affect the width. i will try to reduce the time through avoiding DOM manipulation and optimizing the internal operations.\n. @PranayShah  @kulikovviktor you can try out develop branch or wait for v3.2.3 to be out (today). thanks.\n. @frapontillo extremely good call. i changed the order of the lines to increase consistency but i forgot to try it out.\nbesides, are you up for writing some tests, so we prevent this kind of bugs to happen again?\nfeel free to take a look at the gulp, a few commands and you're up and running.\n. @frapontillo i tried to replicate the issue with no luck. the class is correctly toggled. can you double check for me?\nin any case, i am about to push a hotfix (3.2.2) to which i included some changes that affect the way the public methods work. keep an eye on the next releases.\n. @frapontillo news?\n. duplicate of https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/376.\n. duplicate of #376. please search before posting. thanks.\n. @cvsguimaraes first of all, have you tried the latest version? 3.2.2 calculates the width in pixels, it's an entire new approach. let me know.\n. @cvsguimaraes :+1: \n. @frapontillo i'm aware of the issue. thanks for the detailed description.\ntransition is not needed, but currently its inclusion changes the way the switch is initialised. with it, i can listen to the simulated event transitionEnd and attach my callback (adding the -animate class), otherwise the class is added immediately, therefore when the container position is calculated the css transition takes place.\n. @frapontillo please check out latest develop branch. it should work as expected now.\n. @flth confirmed\n. i am back and will look into that soon. sorry for the waiting.\n. @flth @dwilkie @urmaslipso @jydarche @KrunchMuffin @kulikovviktor it should be fixed. you can try it out on branch develop or wait for v3.3.0 to be out. thanks.\n. @KrunchMuffin glad it did. i will ship it today :+1: \n. @webdad3 we don't regularly provide direct support for issues on all the frameworks out there. also, it would be better if you could attach the generated html source.\n. thanks @lorond. closing here.\n. @livvyjeffs please provide a demo where i can take a look at the problem. thanks.\n. @livvyjeffs fixed, going out in 3.2.3. thanks.\n. @h-sobhy the option inverse is available. check the documentation out.\n. @h-sobhy i consider the issue closed. thanks for searching around alone.\n. @lorond indeed. thanks.\n. indeed duplicate of https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/383\n. @frapontillo thanks. i will take a look soon!\n. @frapontillo will release this with v3.3.0.\n. @judowalker confirmed\n. @judowalker fixed. check out v3.3.0, out soon.\n. fixed, thanks.\n. hi all,\nthe problem occurs in v3.2.2 if you initialise switches which are not visible, for instance if they are inside non-active tabs.\ni'm releasing a new minor version soon (v3.3.0), can one of you please checkout develop and tell me if the issue still happens?\n. @daviddeutsch fair enough, i respect your need of something that just works. feel free to give the coming v3.3.0 a try, if you want.\n. fix is coming out with v3.3.0, thanks to all of the reporters.\n. @iongion the switch works as expected if it's initialised inside a hidden div and the latter becomes afterwards visible: subsequently: http://jsfiddle.net/o0hqrwr8/8/.\nhope it helps.\n. @Goeny correct, duplicate of #392.\n. npm published.\ncdnjs new version to come.\n. cdnjs has now npm auto update. all the versions are published.\n. @puppi77 can you please use a more updated version of the library? i've tested the bug locally with v3.3.1 and the issue doesn't occur.\nregarding preventing the switch to be toggled programmatically, as i understood you want to do, follow discussion here: https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/268.\n. @Sanbingo attach a jsfiddle or similar. thanks.\n. @Sanbingo the markup does not influence the switch functionality: http://jsfiddle.net/3742ppht/\ncould you please replicate the issue as in your environment?\n. @manasa91 @THPubs @sricc i need to know:\n- browser + its version\n- OS\n- if it still occur after releasing 3.3.0\n. thank you @manasa91 for check and report back\n. you have to inform bootstrapSwitch that you want to remove the readonly. you have to user the method readonly.\njavascript\n$('#my-bootstrapswitch').bootstrapSwitch('readonly', false);\ncheers.\n. hi @skaurus,\nwhy do you need this feature? can you tell me the specific use case?\n. @skaurus @glitcha this is in fact the same as https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/268, keep the discussion over there in your radar.\n. fixed in https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/commit/c23201900e573dbbf8f34ac5071b9b0698b15daa. the state is correctly passed.\n. hi @InstanceOfMichael, can you provide me a jsfiddle? thanks.\n. @InstanceOfMichael news?\n. read this explanation\nwe are just making the switch behaving like it is a checkbox in intermediate state. which in fact, it still is. \n. @JoJordens rethinking about it, i figure that setting the right state after label drag from indeterminate state would be beneficial for the user experience, so i corrected the behaviour and it will be included in  v3.3.0. thanks!\n. @kalashnikovisme do you include the bootstrap mixins?\n. .border-radius() mixin is called in bootstrap-switch.less, so it must be included in your compilation stack. is it?\notherwise, i would not know the cause of that error.\n. glad you solved it.\n. @SalvoDiFede duplicate of https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/383\n. @vasikgreif hi, thanks for the suggestion\nisn't there already anything else similar to this?\n. @vasikgreif what seems easy to do always has other implications, especially concerning making it robust and usable. let me have a thought on it.\n. @OlympicLarry it should not matter.\n@erwin what is the sorrounding markup? browser? version?\n. @erwin up\n. added reset margin to 0 on the enclosed checkbox / radio element, as well as indication in README to not use .form-control directly on the input (https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/commit/047654862b74bf69397ddadf7a375cd79989b3bb).\nnotify me in case the issue occurs again.\nthank you all.\n. @chaodongyue very good point. let's talk about it here https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/410.\nthanks.\n. @Firesphere can you be more specific? what would be an example?\n. @Firesphere since the label has a descriptive function in regards of the form input, i believe that assigning the label text to both on and off sides would be quite misleading and redundant.\nwhat if a user would use the label text only for one of the side?\nperhaps, looking at a concrete example would help me dissipating my doubts.\n. what is the advantage of putting the same label to both on and off parts of the switch? sorry but i still don't grasp the value of this option. perhaps a real case example would dissipates my confusion.\n. good catch @KrunchMuffin, we were discussing it here: https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/335.\ni will restore the previous behaviour, even though we need to also make it working for a certain case (see: https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/pull/389)\n. @alph486 it will be included in v3.3.1.\n. the issue does not occur. you retrieve correct value using .prop(\"checked\") as you should.\n\ndoes it clarify your doubts?\n. the switchChange custom event is independent by the checkbox change, which is not triggered since it is used as event receiver. this paradigm is based on code of version <= 3, therefore must be updated. \nthe checkbox change event has not to be called internally. instead, it has to be listened internally for incoming changes and fired when a state change occurs. \nthe update is quite broad and affects many parts of the plugin.\n. @joni-jones apologise for the confusing explanation.\nwhat i meant is exactly what you said. the checkbox change event has not to be used internally like now.\n. @Maks3w isn't it a repetition of https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/releases ?\n. or automatise the routine github-changelog, one way or the other. suggestions?\n. @Maks3w done, https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/commit/133072f70f6b0fc463465286987f88c26ed61a69\n. @jhartling thanks for the contribution, i will work on this.\n. @HybridSolutions what do you refer to?\n. @HybridSolutions up.\n. @HybridSolutions thanks for the suggestion. please follow the discussion here https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/410. thanks,\n. @chrisdot it is the expected behaviour, readonly can only be toggled programmatically. the solution to you case is disabling and renabling readonly respectively before and after setting the state: http://jsfiddle.net/1yq5wr0w/9/\nwould there be room for improvement here, in your opinion?\n. @chrisdot you can disable and enable animation and readonly, respectively before and after setting the state. though, it requires even more code, so i feel your pain.\nnevertheless, i would stick to the currently implemented behaviour since i believe the case in question isn't common.\n. @chrisdot it's correctly working, see http://jsfiddle.net/1yq5wr0w/11/\n. @chrisdot i think it's because of the logic of the init functionality. i'll take a look closely.\n. @chrisdot keep in mind that the best way to set your options would be passing them as init object like this. http://jsfiddle.net/1yq5wr0w/12/\nthe problem is in fact gone in this way as well.\n. @Panman8201 please follow the discussion here, it's exactly related to the change event you are mentioning. https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/418\n. @angel1st at the moment, the width of the switch is the sum of the sides and label widths. there isn't any way to define it.\ni made an attempt to bake a custom solution for your case, but it was becoming too cumbersome too quickly.\ni can add this to v4. if anyone else needs it sooner, i will plan to release it in v3.*. how does that sound? \n. @angel1st unfortunately, i am always very busy with work and everything thus i cannot indicate you any timeframe for the next major release.\ni will try to keep you updated.\n. @voidale i am unable to reproduce the bug. what i do so far is:\n- click on label (white side)\n- the switch always change state\ncan you please tell me which browser, browser version and OS are you using?\n. @voidale no problem, feel free to reopen if it happens again.\n. @dinhienhy please provide a link where i can play around and investigate into the problem. thanks.\n. @dinhienhy in 3.3.2 it should not happen anymore, even if the labelText is set after initialisation.\n. @Panman8201 i think he refers to the internal delay of execution of init logic, which is indeed perceivable. i'll try to reduce that.\n. fix in develop, coming out in 3.3.2.\n. Hi @MrGeneric,\ni guess you're right, are you native english speaker?\n. perfect, i will update the description everywhere.\n. done, thank you! https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/commit/78ed8380b22363201f2befa38961a7277d910ac5\n. @juriejan i'm doing some housekeeping here after a long time. are these changes still relevant? . fixed, to be included in v3.4.0. https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/commit/db485bb9f7a32e42e7eb15480856f3ec6b111703\n. You are right, the initialisation routine is not performant, thus must be rewritten.\n. @vaibhavmule you can listen to the event as indicated in the documentation. if i understand what you want to do, just call startStopCam function inside the listener:\njs\n$('input[name=\"my-checkbox\"]').on('switchChange.bootstrapSwitch', function() {\n  startStopCam();\n});\n. @valix85 if i rewrite your code like following\njs\n$(function(){                        \n  $(\"#SwitchImageActive\").bootstrapSwitch({\n    onSwitchChange: function (event, state) {\n      alert($(this).prop(\"checked\"));\n    }\n  });\n});\nwould it still trigger the problem? can you verify?\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/437\n. I assume the code you posted works for your case.\n. Confirmed, will work to fix this soon.\nThanks for submitting the issue.\n. Hi @stralytic, in my mind .state is always a Boolean. Could you find a way to rethink the implementation without setting state to null / undefined?. Related with https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/437. The initialisation routine must be rewritten.\n. All BootstrapSwitch events are namespaced (eventName.bootstrapSwitch). Doesn't the namespace show up as property of the event object?\n. Duplicate of https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/437.\n. HI @MortimerNeuss. The rounded style is in Roadmap (https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/410). For the moment, you could try to play with negative margins on the handles, however I cannot support you directly right now.\n. If you really have to keep the older version in the document, at least make sure that the new version is included afterwards.\nDoes this solve your case?\n. @abhishekgupta1991 please provide a link with the occurring issue.\n. @kkirsche I'll accept it if you resolve conflicts. Thanks!. @kkirsche totally ok for me, it was more for your contribution to be recorded.. @vasekch That's the documentation for v2 and it's correct (https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/blob/v2.0.1/src/coffee/bootstrap-switch.coffee#L11). v2 is no longer supported.. See https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/pull/476 . Hi Cliff, thanks for the contribution. A couple of points:\n\nThe source has changed, can you check out the newest version locally and port the changes?\nCan you point me to specs explaining why <span> with no title does not play well with screen-readers? I have very little time to investigate into the issue myself\n\nUpon programmatic update of on or off texts, label's title is not updated. @CliffAscent I'm doing some housekeeping here after a long time. I'd be great if you's take a look at my previous message and jump back on track with the requested changes. Would you do that?. @mtj8033 Totally right, thanks.. @JulienMelissas thanks, I will merge this if you also change occurrences in test.html and src/docs/jade/index.jade. @JulienMelissas Docs source has changed, can you port your changes and push again? . @JulienMelissas Thanks anyway. @jrbalsano Great job, thanks! Unfortunately, we tossed out CoffeeScript. Could you check out latest version, re-apply changes and push again?. New site online https://bttstrp.github.io/bootstrap-switch/. @tlk Is the proposed fix still relevant and applicable? If so, can you open a new PR?. @mortonfox we are currently moving the docs somewhere else altogether. Thank you anyway. @drdwilcox Thanks, solve conflicts and I will merge it. @ehuisman Apologies for the huge delay, I'm almost back at maintaining this project. Thanks for the contribution. If you solve the conflicts, I'll merge it straight away.. @anthonyrossetto Apologies for the huge delay, I'm sort of back at maintaining this project. Thanks for the contribution, though I need a more detailed explanation: what is your reasoning here? Why you moved handlers from element to container?. @anthonyrossetto I'm doing some housekeeping after a long time. Are changes still relevant?. I started working on it on branch v4, you can install it requiring version 4.0.0-alpha.1 or @next. Contribution targeted there are welcome.. @ceefour Approved. @Julusian Apologies for the huge delay, I'm sort of back at maintaining this project. Thanks for the contribution, I find it really valuable. Since PR was opened 1 year ago, would you like me to merge changes as-is or add more patches? . @Julusian Ah, I just noticed that merge branch is master. Can you close and reopen it targeting develop instead? Sorry for the extra hassle, though it's also specified in CONTRIBUTING.md.. @Julusian I figured I could update it myself. Let's kick this in. @dpuckett Apologies for the huge delay, I'm sort of back at maintaining this project. Thanks for the contribution. Since PR was opened a year ago:\n\n\nAre changes ready for merge as-is or you'd like to add something else first?\n\nSource files have changed (CoffeeScript was removed), can you check out v3.3.3 and apply changes to it?. @dpuckett I'm doing some housekeeping after a long time. Are changes still relevant?. Duplicate, see #476. Thanks @same31 . @hw20686832 First append input to div, then initialise bootstrap on it:\n\njs\n$('<input type=\"checkbox\">').appendTo('div').bootstrapSwitch();. As @jymbob pointed out, currently you can use HTML inside text strings. I will add it to documentation in future, as well as other common use cases. . Thanks for the contribution. Should this PR prevail the other open one? In any case, have a look at this comment and remove conflicts by checking out latest v3.3.3. @mzimmerman I'm doing some housekeeping after a long time. Are changes still relevant?. Interesting. @ghost Did you figure out why over the past months?. @xszaboj I've merged this recently (https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/pull/582). Can you test v3.3.3 and report back?. @brylie Follow https://github.com/Bttstrp/bootstrap-switch/pull/604. I leave this one open in case PR doesn't go through.. @icholy As soon as we migrate the repository under a new organization, I will be able to make it collaborator. Anyway, check out https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/pull/582 and let me know if it covers everything.. Wow, that looks awfully broken. Got chance to debug it, in the meantime?. @webdevnerdstuff Apologies for the huge delay, I'm sort of back at maintaining this project. Thanks for the contribution; I see a few points to tackle:\n\nSASS file should be in src/sass folder \nCreate variable $bootstrap-switch-base like in src/less/bootstrap3/bootstrap-switch.less file\nIndentation: 2 spaces instead of tab\n\nPlease check out v3.3.3 before updating PR. @webdevnerdstuff I opened the branch v4 and worked on the SASS files. Check and test it out, I'll put this PR on hold for now. @dsagrera Can you please provide more details for the variant and its use cases?. @mruoss Thanks for the contribution, sorry for the huge delay. I'm sort of back maintaining the project. I'd rather let the transpiler do this so to keep source files pristine. Something like babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-umd should do the trick. Can you try it out and reopen the PR against develop?. @graingert Confirmed, thanks!. @BdMdesigN I really want to have the website back. Write me with the Auth code: emanuele@lostcrew.it. @BdMdesigN bootstrapswitch.com is now registered. I'll make sure it becomes the new official docs website . New site is online https://bttstrp.github.io/bootstrap-switch/. Closing, discussion here: https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/issues/606. @SilverFire Back on track, newer v3.3.3 has been published on all pkg managers. . @jonathanbarton Hi, I haven't tried using jQuery 3. I'll investigate compatibility and report back.. So https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/commit/77c5bd3b7bcda4a8c47f6a7385516091f6f4b7eb ?. @dLobatog Can you work on compatibility with more recent jquery versions and open a PR afterwards?. Allright, can you check if bower.json & co should be updated too? . Getting this in, thanks. https://bttstrp.github.io/bootstrap-switch/  is a temporary URL. I am planning to connect https://bootstrap-switch.com instead.. Fixed and released in v3.3.4. @graingert Ok like that, but I'm not a fan of the ternary operator, especially in long expressions. Midly relatedly, I identify Math.round(Math.max(this.$on.width(), this.$off.width())) possibly being a separate function.. @graingert I'm adding stage-2 now, it might help. @Quezler New website. @hughanderson4 I'm doing some housekeeping after a long time. Can you solve conflicts so I can merge this in?. @jeronimoflima I'm doing some housekeeping here after a long time. are these changes still relevant?.

Yes, this was not your problem.\nFirst of all, sorry for my confusing. I was using another gem named rails-bootstrap-toggle-buttons, and the gem was using your plugin  It was old version, and there were some codes using attr method of jQuery.\nAs you know, as of jQuery 1.9.1, they are recommended strongly to use prop method instead of attr method in order to set some values by using jQuery.\nIn fact, in jQuery 1.9.1, the following method are not working.\n$(\"input#my_test[type=checkbox]\").attr('checked', true);   // this does not change the checked-status of checkbox.\n$(\"input#my_test[type=checkbox]\").prop('checked', true);   // this does not change the checked-status of checkbox.\nBut, in the older versions, the codes above are working properly.

Ok i see the problem, but i think it's a Icon glyphs problem.\nI try to fix it. \n. Yes Font-Awesome is a fine thing, but the switches use the font in the bootstrap.css from the bootstrap project\nSo if people want use other \"Fonts\" than they must integrate it self in the bootstrap.css.\nI had to make for another project also.

Sorry\n. @ nostalgiaz:\nCan i merge this request?\n. Thanks,\nI do not really understand your suggestion but the question is how to save the state of the radio buttons.If you save the checked status via PHP in a file, so the radio buttons are set via PHP script to checked.\nWorks very well, have tested it live in a CMS.\nBest regards\nPeter\n. No problem, my english is not the best, too.\nOk i think i understand now.\nExemple:\nIf you have a form with radiobuttons and you wish thats no radiobuttons are checked and a User must be check a radio first, than your radio inputs must be write so:\n[code]\n<div class=\"switch\">\n    <input type=\"radio\" name=\"your-radio-name-here\" value=\"your-value-here\" />\n    <input type=\"radio\" name=\"your-radio-name-here\" value=\"your-second-value-here\" />\n    <input type=\"radio\" name=\"your-radio-name-here\" value=\"your-third-value-here\" />\n....\n</div>\n[/code]\nAs it shows your example image.\n. Please try this branch:\nhttps://github.com/BdMdesigN/bootstrap-switch-BdMdesigN/tree/Test\nMy new pull request wasn't merged in the master from nostalgiaz\nI have made new change for the radios in the bootstrap-switch.js:\nhttps://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/pull/86\nIf it not works, can you send me your code via e-mail. I will test it than here.\n. Ok understand.\nFor understanding have a look on this page:\nhttp://www.givainc.com/labs/ibutton_example.htm\nYou mean, thats the radios must works as in Radio Button Example and not as in Radio Button Example (w/ Radio Uncheck Allowed)\nI know this problem and the fix for that is in work, but i have other projects finished first.\n. Can you test this branch https://github.com/BdMdesigN/bootstrap-switch-BdMdesigN (master), please?\nIf it works than i merge it to the nostalgiaz master branch\n.

Ok, i have made test with font-awesome.\nIf i use \njavascript\n<div class=\"make-switch\" data-icon=\"icon-check\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" checked />\n</div>\nwith font-awesome, the icon inside the label is not rendered and breaks the label layout.\nWithout  font-awesome the icon inside the label is not rendered and don't breaks the label layout.\nbut if i use \njavascript\n<div class=\"make-switch\" data-icon=\"check\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" checked />\n</div>\nthe icon inside the label is rendered and don't breaks with font-awesome the layout.\nDemo: http://bdmdesign.github.io/bootstrap-switch-BdMdesigN/examples.html#html-text-label-icon-font-awesome\n.

Stop back to start.\nI have crap built and edited the wrong js.\n. Can you change in the bootstrap-switch.js:\nhtml\n            if (icon) {\n              $label.html('<i class=\"icon icon-' + icon + '\"></i>');\n            }\nto:\nhtml\n            if (icon) {\n              $label.html('<i class=\"icon ' + icon + '\"></i>');\n            }\nplease?\nThan we can use all fontsets:\n``` html\nFlat UI:\n\n\n\ntb-standart, Font Awesome:\n\n\n\netc ...\n```\nMy tests a finishd and the patch works and now i have seen the bugs.\n. \"in your example it would be youtube or vimeo depending on the switch-on/off\"\nYes but is only a example. You can use all Icons if you need.\n\"If you think it can be usefull I'll be glad to submit.\"\nCan you make a pre-test branch with example, please? I must see it, because my english ist not the best to understand all.\n. Make a PR to the branch v1.8, please.\n. Can you make me an example via Gimp or Photoshop, please?\n. Did you mean like this: http://bdmdesign.github.io/bootstrap-switch-BdMdesigN/examples.html#label-text ?\n. I have written the function until 40 minutes before and its come in v1.8\n. The same with HTML text Label Icon, but i fix it\n. Can you test the v1.8 branch again, please?\nText Label bug is fixed.\nNow i must find a way to fix the bug in the Icon Label\n. Fixed and comes in v1.8\n. Ahh forget to fix the link\nFixed\n. Ok i have test it now and to hell it works now ?!?\nPlease use a older 1.8 Version (without the changes from today) and click in the center of the middle label of a switch in the html text icon exsample.\nYou see the switch don't change the state. If you click left or right of the icon in the middle label of the switch, the switch change his state.\nBut with your fix in the js its work. Please add the fix in the 1.8.1, too\n. Which 3 Bootstrap version do you have there?\n. In the last dropdowns.less of 3.0.0-rc1 the lines 69 - 78 should be:\n// Hover/Focus state\n// -----------\n.dropdown-menu > li > a {\n  &:hover,\n  &:focus {\n    text-decoration: none;\n    color: @dropdown-link-hover-color;\n    #gradient > .vertical(@start-color: @dropdown-link-hover-bg; @end-color: darken(@dropdown-link-hover-bg, 5%));\n  }\n}\nBut i'm not good with less, so i hope nostalgiaz can better help here\n. done in v1.8\n. The Data-text-label comes in v1.8 you must try the v1.8 branch:\nhttps://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/tree/v1.8\n. fixed\n. Ok the next version did it\n. can you add your PR here https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/tree/1.8.1 again, please?\n. Did you mean the way thats iButton use?\n. Ok i try it local, if its works and nostalgiaz give his ok its come in the next version\n. @ArTiSTiX In the first you can use jQuery to do that. Here an example:\n``` HTML\n  $(\"input[type='radio']\").each(function(){\n    $(\".your-class\").find(\"input[type='radio']\").removeClass('check');\n    var radiobuttonname = $(this).prop('name');\n    $(this).wrap(\"\");\n$(\".radio-button-\"+radiobuttonname+\"\").on('switch-change', function () {\n  $(\".radio-button-\"+radiobuttonname+\"\").bootstrapSwitch('toggleRadioState');\n});\n\n});\n```\nThats a example for Radios. I use this code in a CMS Template.\n. Thanx, fixed\n. Only Crome or breaks in other Browsers, too?\n. Did you test it local or on Webspace? If Webspace give me the URL please. So i can check it\n. Ok i see.\nTry this:\nHTML\n<div class=\"col-lg-4 make-switch has-switch\" data-off=\"info\" data-on=\"primary\" data-off-label=\"No\" data-on-label=\"Yes\">\n    {{ field }}\n</div>\nor if you don't need class \"col-lg-4\":\nHTML\n<div class=\"make-switch has-switch\" data-off=\"info\" data-on=\"primary\" data-off-label=\"No\" data-on-label=\"Yes\">\n    {{ field }}\n</div>\n. I see the problem. The problem is the class \"col-lg-4\" i think\n. Ok i see. hmmmm. Change it back please\n. Back to the original markup\nI try it here local\n. Did you try the last v1.8?\n. The same problem? download it now again. there are bugfixes in it.\n. Yes. can you send me the formsite and the css via email please?\nI will check it local and try to fix it\n. It's ok, fine thats now working :)\n. in ff is the bug again\n. Can you send the PR into the branch 1.8.1 ( https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/tree/1.8.1 ) please, too ? \n.

    "frapontillo": "Done. I have improved the html page formatting as well.\nI'm thinking about including a grunt file for building and minifying, what do you think?\n. Merged and updated to change switch with make-switch in index.html.\n. What do you use to minify the source code?\n. Done.\n. I have written one: https://github.com/frapontillo/angular-bootstrap-switch\n. I'd remove that too, the user should be in control of what happens.\n. You could consider using my directive implementation of bootstrap-switch (already compatible for v3.0).\n. I will use this issue to report back, thanks! :wink:\n. angular-bootstrap-switch 0.3.0-alpha.2 has been released and should not break anything.\n. Yes, it is.\n. About these custom classes: are they added to the top-level container only?\n. What is the purpose of changing all of the classes? One could simply set the class on the parent container and apply custom styles to all of the nested elements.\n. What would you consider a risk? Flexibility is achieved through convention rather than uber-configuration. The same thing is achievable by simply setting a parent class and then applying your custom style by prepending every CSS class with .my-custom-parent-class.\n. Sure, I just need to understand what are the use cases that @pytkin can't solve with one single custom container class.\n. If you let those strings be configurable, how will the plugin pick up the default CSS?\n. Yep, I will get into it asap, has this feature already been implemented in /tree/3.0?\n. There's one more thing I need, that is the possibility to change the modifiers after initialization, just like it already happens with  onText, offText, etc.\nI would need the following methods:\n- onModifierClass\n- offModifierClass\n- focusedModifierClass\n- animateModifierClass\n- disabledModifierClass\n- readonlyModifierClass\n. To change theme after initialization, possibly.\nAlso, consider that AngularJS directives generally do not handle plugin initialization on the first call, but as attribute are evaluated; but this may happen on different cycles, when the plugin is already initialized.\n. It really is irrelevant. Take the first post as an example: how to enable multiple themes? Simply set one and only one custom class on the main element (container) and then every other CSS class will derive from it, therefore inheriting all custom styles.\n``` html\n     This will have a \"flat\" style \n\n all elements will inherit from \"my-bootstrap-switch-flat-class\" \n e.g. in your CSS \".my-bootstrap-switch-flat-class .bootstrap-switch-handle-on\" will have a different background \n\nON\n\u00a0\nOFF\n\n\n\n<!-- This will have a \"bezel\" style -->\n<div class=\"bootstrap-switch my-bootstrap-switch-bezel-something-class\">\n    <!-- NO CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS ELEMENT: all elements will simply inherit from \"my-bootstrap-switch-bezel-something-class\" -->\n    <div>\n        <span class=\"bootstrap-switch-handle-on bootstrap-switch-primary\">ON</span>\n        <label>&nbsp;</label>\n        <span class=\"bootstrap-switch-handle-off bootstrap-switch-default\">OFF</span>\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" checked=\"\" data-size=\"large\">\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n```\nThis will lead to much less unexpected behaviour.\n. So how should we handle a custom class on the main div?\n. So you still opted for custom classes on every level?\n. Hmmm, then I probably don't understand what onModifierClass, offModifierClass etc. are.\n. That'd be correct if we would have stayed with the previous \"override every class\" option. Since I understood you also wanted to override the wrapper class only, those methods aren't needed anymore, right?\n. Sorry for the mess here :D\n. Question: when setting an undefined or empty '' wrapperClass, why not falling back to $.fn.bootstrapSwitch.defaults.wrapperClass instead of the most recent options.wrapperClass?\nConsider the following use case:\n1. User does not specify a wrapperClass on instantiation.\n2. User changes the wrapperClass to, say, flat.\n3. User wants to go back to the default one, and sets an undefined wrapper.\n4. The wrapperClass is still flat because it is used as the default one.\n. I don't have permission to close this issue, but both problems are solved by #280 and #281.\n. Quick recap:\n- wrapperClass(undefined), returns the current wrapperClass value\n- wrapperClass(''), sets the default wrapperClass (wrapper)\n- wrapperClass(someValue), sets the given value\nRight?\n. :volcano: \n. Yes, it was as it was needed to properly handle multiple radio switches... How can we solve both the issues?\n.

This is not directed towards you or anyone who contributed in this project. I completely get the move towards MIT license, I accept it and embrace it.\nWhat bothers me is that extra \"work\" is needed in order to support a horrible license such as GPL.

    "Pasvaz": "data-on-label and data-off-label are used to change the text on the switch, they can be used to set the icon if the necessary html is provided, but still they render the icon (as html) inside the button, while data-icon is used to render the icon inside the label, if you never used it, try this:\njavascript\n<div class=\"switch switch-large\" data-icon=\"icon-check\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" checked />\n</div>\nor even this one so you can see the difference between data-icon and data-on-label:\njavascript\n<div class=\"switch switch-large\" data-icon=\"icon-home\" data-on-label=\"<i class='icon-check'></i>\">\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" checked />\n</div>\ndata-icon is not documented in the demo but is still supported by the code and still works as expected.\n. Yep, using data-icon=\"check\" works because fontawesome uses [class^=\"icon-\"] as selector so if you omit the 'icon' word it doesn't conflict, however some other fonts framework use data-icon as selector so it breaks the layout anyway, that's why I changed data-icon into data-label-icon in my fork.\n.

    "neverfox": "I don't think there's any need for all that. I'm just talking about putting text on the slider itself, i.e the white rectangle that moves back and forth. After posting this, I took a look at the code and the DOM that it produces and it should be pretty easy since it already creates a label element for it; there's even a whole section of CSS for it. There just isn't a setter API hook for changing it from blank to something else.\nI think it could be solved with something as simple as:\njavascript\n      setLabel: function(value) {\n        var $label = $(this).find(\"label\");\n        $label.html(value);\n      }\nAlso the CSS is set to grays that make it hard to read, so I think it would need to have more readable colors as default. I'm a bit busy at the moment to work on a pull request but I wouldn't mind doing it later.\n. Yes! I was looking at the documentation linked from the main repo, which doesn't have all of these examples or mention this feature.

That's great. Thank you.\n. You might be aware of this, but the label text interferes with clicking on the switch. If you click right on the div containing the text, the switch doesn't work.

Instead of giving the checkbox \"display: none\", we could give it an offscreen style (absolute positioning & zero dimensons) that would allow it to still receive focus. That may be preferable to trying to make a div act like a form element.\n. Listening for the input's focus event is what I was thinking. I agree about placing the checkbox behind the switch. Awesome!\n. It looks like the two comments here don't have much to do with this pull request. \nHowever, I think there's good reason to specify the version with some more granularity - while there's (mostly) parity between 1.9 and 2.0, there's no guarantee that will be true for all versions of jQuery >= 1.9.0.\n. A couple of commits (from master?) seem to have ended up in this pull request. I can make a new PR if they're distracting.\n. Sure, I'll re-roll the pull request. Closing this one.\n. I think it makes sense to document how to do both in the Readme, but that it shouldn't happen simply by loading the library.\nRegarding the data attribute, I believe there's still some performance increase in selecting for classnames  rather than data attributes, but I don't think it's enough of a gain to sacrifice semantics.\n. Even when not following SemVer explicitly, I think its rules are a good starting point for versioning conventions. Since this is a non-backward-compatible change to the public API, it should probably be rolled into 2.0.0, not another release in the 1.9.x series.\n. That's great - I'll take a look at the rewrite!\n. So I should merge everything that's currently on develop? I did merge from develop when I re-created it, but if there are new changes, I'll be happy to update.\n. This PR is the re-roll of #186\n.

That still gives us the issue that there's no visual indication that anything has received focus, which was the point of my comment - however, we could add a little callback function on the checkbox's focus/blur events that adds/removes a class from the switch itself, giving the illusion of the switch having keyboard focus.  I think that's doable :)  (Heck, the checkbox doesn't even need to be offscreen, we could just ensure that the switch overlays it visually)\nI'll work with this idea when I get some free time and improve this pull.\n.

    "SergeyBarskiy": "I am trying to make it work, just not sure if I will have time any time soon.  I will contribute the directive back to you most certainly, once I have a chance to implement...\nThanks.\n. Here is what I came up with. In theory it would be a stand-alone directive with all the code in it, but this wrapper that relies in events works just as well.  I added it to a fork I created.  Here is the link.\nhttps://github.com/SergeyBarskiy/bootstrap-switch/blob/master/src/bootstrap-switch-angular.js\nMaybe you could add it to your docs if you do not feel like using it in actual source code.

Done.\nhttps://github.com/SergeyBarskiy/bootstrap-switch/blob/3.0/src/bootstrap-switch-angular.js\nThanks.\n. Oh, I noticed that in 3.0 there seems to be an issue with label sizes.

The fix for the position was to replace opacity: 0 with display: none for checkbox\n.bootstrap-switch input[type='radio'],\n.bootstrap-switch input[type='checkbox'] {\n  position: absolute !important;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  display: none;\n  /opacity: 0;\n  filter: alpha(opacity=0);/\n  z-index: -1;\n}\n. So, I gave the whole MV* pattern some more thought.  I think in an ideal world, there should be a native angular directive.  However, I think it is import for the switch to support data binding in general.  Right now the switch is pushing the state to the check box, but it does not pull the state from it, which will make it very hard to support any data binding scenarios.  I did have to jump through some hoops to make get around this limitation.  So, my 2 cents: the switch should keep itself in sync with the check box two way, instead of current one-way.\nThanks for your efforts...\n. I agree.\n. ",

    "nkostadinov": "hi @LostCrew , actually I need this for a system i'm developing right now.This is the case :\nI have users and groups, groups have permissions which are checkboxes(switches) and the users have permissions which may override groups permissions, The user permissions are yes/no/inherited. I want to use the indeterminate state to display inherited. \nAlso another use case, I have a filter column where I have yes/no values. When I want to filter only yes/no its ok, but I want to remove the filter so .. this is indeterminate state:)\nSince the check box doesnt post any value when it is not checked, it will be good to specify the indeterminate state value via configuration { indeterminate: 'inherited', checked: 'true' } so when the button is in this state it will just return this value. Maybe having indeterminate default value to false means the control doesnt support this state, and when set to a value it enables it.\n. Take a look at this jsfiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/chriscoyier/mGg85/2/\nCheckbox inputs can only have two states: checked or unchecked. They can have any value, but they either submit that value (checked) or don't (unchecked) with a form submission. The default is unchecked.You can't make a checkbox indeterminate through HTML. There is no indeterminate attribute. It is a property of checkboxes though, which you can change via JavaScript.\nThe indeterminate state is visual only. The checkbox is still either checked or unchecked as a state. Like the checkboxes themselves, indeterminate state looks different in different browsers. Since the browser is displaying correctly the indeterminate state you can safely destroy the chebox leaving it in this state.\nFor example this https://github.com/montrezorro/bootstrap-checkbox implemented indeterminate state.\n. May be the white box should stay in the middle and the other options should be grayed out(like disabled).

Without that wrapper function it should work well in both (older jquery and new versions).\nPS: With jquery 1.8.1 everything in your library works well, except that function, so if you find simple fix for that it would be great. Or at least just note somewhere in docs how to make your lib work under old jquery versions.\n.

Only one time (but it will fire 3 times).\nWhen I switch 2nd checkbox I want to see in console '2, true' or '2, false'. Also only one time (but it will fire 3 times).\n\nUPD: Wait.

    "raveren": "Yeah, that's awesome, thanks!\nI'd be weary to use the undocumented feature though, I would be accessing the internal workings of the plugin - and it could change at any moment.\nI'm sorry for appearing to tell you what to do, I really am not, this is just my opinion: the wrapper element should be abstracted to a method. An easy and clear way IMHO would be to add a onInitialized callback, e.g.:\nInitialize:\njavascript\n.bootstrapSwitch( [handler(element, wrapper)] );\nautomagic tooltip functionality:\njavascript\n$(\"[name='my-checkbox']\").bootstrapSwitch(function(element, wrapper){\n    $(wrapper).tooltip({ title : $(element).prop('title') })\n});\n. Hey, I researched this a little, and yeah, most well-established jQuery plugins do not expose their created elements, but offer consistent markup that makes sense, e.g. I've used $('#colorbox') for years to fetch the whole contents of Colorbox, which I do in initialization callbacks. \nFurthermore, most if not all of them offer a custom onInit callback with access to the original element. So your first suggestion makes a lot of sense and follows the standards perfectly :)\n. Hey, I finally got around to testing it. There are a couple of issues:\nusually, the events are passed just like that\njavascript\n$(\"[name='my-checkbox']\").bootstrapSwitch({\n  onInit: function() {\n      // stuff\n  }\n});\npassing a collection of callbacks ({on:{init:...}}) has no real advantage versus {onInit:...} and the latter is what everyone uses.\nAlso, consider namespacing the js event: bootstrap 3.0 uses bs. for example: \njavascript\n    $('.selector').on('shown.bs.tab', function( e ) {})\nFinally, the event fires, but nothing gets passed. this is a reference to document.window and function receives no parameters. I'd usually expect the Event object as the single parameter to the callback with e.target property as the element on which initialization was performed (in this case the checkbox in question).\n. Hi there! I've migrated to the new BSS version and am trying it out...\nWhile accessing the element via this is comfortable, it's more standard to get the element via \njavascript\n$(window).on('switchChange.bootstrapSwitch', function( e ) {\n     e.target; // <- this way\n})\nadditionally, most plugins support calling e.preventDefault() or returning false to prevent the actual switch change - or should I open a new feature request for this?\nOtherwise it works and looks brilliant, thank you for your work!\n.

Remove this line(I mean label: 'label'), because this will be strange if you add this ability to the label, and didn't add to the \"> div\".\n. @LostCrew, yes, you right.\n. @LostCrew \nHow about this:\n\njs\n{\n  classes: {\n    base: 'bootstrap-switch', // string, prepended to any classes\n    container: '', // string | array\n    wrapper: 'wrapper', // string | array\n    handleOn: 'handler-on', // string | array\n    handleOff: 'handler-off', // string | array\n    label: 'label', // string | array\n    modifiers: {\n      on: 'on', // string\n      off: 'off', // string\n      focused: 'focused', // string\n      animate: 'animate', // string\n      disabled: 'disabled', // string\n      readonly: 'readonly' // string\n    }\n  }\n}\n. @frapontillo, I can solve my problem with one single custom container class.\nWe separete css from js removing \"-handle-on \", \"-handle-off \", \"-animate\", \"-disabled\", \"-readonly\", \"-off\", \"-on\", \"-focused\", and add this strings to configuration. I think configurable classes better than hard coded classes in JS.\n. @frapontillo, I'm not sure that I understand you. What you mean under \"pick up the default CSS\"?\nThis changes are compatible with previous version, we just add the ability to change this strings.\n. ",
    "h-sobhy": "@pytkin regardless of the new class name, Did you reached to a way to CSS the switch as the above screenshot? \n\nI've changed mine to circle case and to change the aspect ratio of the switcher to almost 50:50 or close and I realized that both spans ad label inside the wrapper has 33% of the width and each time I try to change this I find that the  holds the on/off changes too and stretch the width of the switcher. \nAny way to avoid this?\n. @LostCrew .. WOW .. exactly what i want ... thanks a million :)\n. So you used the label for the circle \"button\" and added transition for it in both cases .. good one  :)\n. @LostCrew \nA last question, do you have any idea why the smaller size not working right when you click the gray label when it's unchecked while the label click is ok when it's red (checked) ? http://jsfiddle.net/nRLaE/1/\n. Thanks @LostCrew for the custom switch and the nice plugin\n. just a note: that happens when width for fixed custom switch is lower than 57px \n. @LostCrew \nit's in this line \n_this.$element.prop(\"checked\", parseInt(_this.$div.css(\"margin-left\"), 10) > -25).trigger(\"change.bootstrapSwitch\");\nIt worked when changed 10 to 19 don't know why\n_this.$element.prop(\"checked\", parseInt(_this.$div.css(\"margin-left\"), 19) > -25).trigger(\"change.bootstrapSwitch\");\n. @LostCrew  Here is the example with modified JS http://jsfiddle.net/nRLaE/2/\n. Sure\n. Sorry @LostCrew for the delay .. \nYes, It worked here .. according to the JS file I use, I've  changed to \n_this.$div.css(\"margin-left\"), 10) > -(_this.$div.width() / 6)).trigger\nHrer is the JSfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/nRLaE/5/\n. Thanks for you and the nice plugin .. \nfor some reason the above link doesn't work correctly for both sizes using FF 27 or Chrome 33 (it worked when just run it using the previous script) .. remember the label is the circle not the text .. it still fine here http://jsfiddle.net/nRLaE/5/\n. Thanks @LostCrew, I didn't notice that feature .. anyway I think there is something prevent animation with inverse option while clicking the spans until we click the label then it animate normally even on the plugin website.\naway from this, I've noticed that the bottom documentation button leads to 404 page (documentation-3.html not documentation-2.html) .. thought you might want to know. thanks again\n. Oh it's in all this version. not sure if that \"new\" animation restriction until clicking spans is a bug or technically required.

IMHO that's not a good solution either. Also I can only start a drag on one half of the button.

Well #243 fixed it the wrong way: It should not just simulate mouse up, when the cursor leaves the field.\nIf you attach the move listener to the document you can listen to the mouse move just fine, even if the cursor leaves the field.\nThat way you can also start the drag anywhere in the field - not just in half of it (currently if you want the drag left you have to start in the right half, because otherwise you cannot drag far enouigh, before the simulated mouse-up triggers).\n.

In the page I'm currently working on this bug is even worse, it makes all switches tilt to the left while the container's opacity is fading with CSS transitions.\nQuite sure that it's a webkit bug.

I would be glad if anyone else can confirm this bug in Chrome stable running on Windows 8.\nAFAIK opacity is a 'standalone property' that doesn't affect any other property, so eventually I'll file a bug to Chrome devs too and post here later.\n. @hughanderson4 Thank you sir! :+1: \nYou managed to reproduce this bug on which specs?

It seems to be fixed already in 34.0.1847.131m (Current stable version).\nHowever, now I've noticed that the switchers container size isn't getting calculated accurately (150% get rounded down leaving 1px).

    "sotarules": "I also ran into this problem.  After single-stepping through the initialization of the Bootstrap switch with a debugger, I have a theory about the cause.\nThe problem appears to be caused by logic in _initWidth that tests the visibility of an element called $wrapper.  This element must be visible for the system to properly compute the handle width and label width.  If $wrapper is not visible, the system sets an interval timer for 50ms and tries again later.  Notwithstanding the 50ms re-try, the main execution continues; however, subsequent logic fails because the system needs the handle width value early in order to compute the switch container margin.  If this value is undefined, the button is rendered as ON irrespective of state.\nThe reason that this is related to the modal appears linked to the animation.  In the initial phase of the animation, the visibility test for $wrapper fails causing the system to bypass the calculation of the handle width.  Because this value is undefined, the system doesn't properly compute the margin offset, which causes the button to render in the ON position regardless of the actual state.\nNote that at this point the DOM is in a \"bad\" state, because the CSS classes (e.g., boostrap-switch-off) contradict the visible switch state.\nIt appears that I can circumvent the problem by delaying initialization of the Bootstrap switch 200ms. I considered actually waiting until the modal animation was complete (using event shown.bs.modal) but if you wait until the modal is completely visible, you'll see the switch visibly change, which isn't ideal in my case.\nPlease take this analysis with a grain of salt, I've just started using Bootstrap Switches in earnest.  It would be great if others could confirm or refute my findings and post here.\n. LostCrew, thanks so much.  I tried release 3.3.0 (I could not find 3.2.3) and it does fix the problem that I have reported.\nHowever, FWIW I think I found a different problem in 3.3.0.  The problem has to do with the skip parameter that can be supplied to API function \"state\".  When set to true, the documentation indicates that skip will defeat the switchChange event.  On 3.3.0, I started getting the switchChange event whenever I called the \"state\" function, even when I supplied skip true.\nI checked the source code and I think I found the cause:  in _elementHandlers change.bootstrapSwitch, you'll see the following instruction:\nreturn _this.$element.trigger(\"switchChange.bootstrapSwitch\", [state]);\nIn 3.2.2, this instruction was subordinated to condition if (!skip), but in 3.3.0, the instruction is no longer conditional, it is now the very last line of the event handler and is executed unconditionally.\nI have circumvented this in my own code but I wanted to bring it to your attention.\n. ",
    "Vadorequest": "My solution so far, using html5 data-attributes.\n``` js\n/\n * Apply the bootstrap-switch plugin.\n \n * http://www.bootstrap-switch.org/\n /\n$(function(){\n  var groups_switched = [];\n$.each($('[rel=\"switch\"]'), function(i, el){\n    $el = $(el);\n    if(typeof $el.data('group') !== 'undefined'){\n      var group = $el.data('group');\n      // If this group hasn't been switch yet then do it.\n      if(!groups_switched[group]){\n        groups_switched[group] = true;\n        $('*[data-group=\"'+group+'\"]').bootstrapSwitch()\n      }\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\nIt works, but all inputs are still linked together, I have this issue since the beginning, my page contains several forms using the same input names because they are generated.

This is a major issue for me, I didn't find any viable solution yet. I don't understand how it's possible that this plugin links all inputs together if they have the same name. That's a real issue for all generated content based on a collection of item.\nEdit: I just saw this is pending, I'll wait so.\n. I mean that when I run the code $('.switch').bootstrapSwitch(); it links different form radio/checkboxes together, it shouldn't. So when I check a radio, all radio get checked because they use the same name attr, even if they belong to separated forms.\nI don't have access to the source code anymore, but I remember the issue.\n. > Hi @Vadorequest ! Can you paste here your html code? I think the switches do their job correctly but I'm not sure that I've understood the issue; why did you say \"it links different form radio/checkboxes together, it shouldn't\"?\nI don't have access to the source code anymore.\nThe thing is that, in different forms, with checkboxes having the same name, it linked them all together, so I checked one and all were checked, across forms, and that was an issue.\n. I'm sorry but I don't have time for this, I'm not using this lib anymore,\nit happened like 8/9 months ago, so maybe this issue has been fixed since,\nI cannot say.\nThe name of the checkboxes were an array, like: 'vote[display][]' and they\nbelonged to separated forms within the same HTML page, that's what I\nremember, if you cannot reproduce it then I guess it has been fixed.\n.

The goal was to make it easier to integrate in other applications. Already, developers from several communities have requested this, such as Drupal, MoinMoin and Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware.\nBootstrap was reported to be \"Now Styling 1% of Websites\" and we wanted to increase this :-)\nhttp://architects.dzone.com/articles/twitter-bootstrap-now-styling\nhttp://techcrunch.com/2013/07/28/bootstrap-3-goes-mobile-first-now-reportedly-powers-1-of-the-web/\nThere are various interpretations. Some say that this change is not necessary. According to http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.html and according to the FSF\nhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#apache2, Apache 2 is not compatible with GPL 2.1 (used by Drupal and MoinMoin) and LGPL 2.1 (used by Tiki).\nThe safest/simplest for Bootstrap Switch is just to change the license, which is what Bootstrap did (hundreds of people accepted). It opens the door to becoming bundled as an official component in Bootstrap down the road.\nYou are, of course, entitled to saying \"no\" to the proposed license change. Nobody likes it when the rules of the game have changed after the game started. However, we really want to keep your contributions, so please go ahead and support the change :-)\nSo please find the link above and confirm that you accept this change. For the people whom we can't reach or for the commits of the people who say no, we will have to remove their code, and rewrite. So please do save us that extra work :-)\nThanks and best regards!\nRelated links:\nhttp://blog.getbootstrap.com/2012/12/10/bootstrap-3-plans/\nhttps://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/2054\n. +1 of course, as I proposed it :-)\n. Good idea about the pigeons :-)\n. @nostalgiaz : \"They wrote code that was replaced over the ages\"  ok, so let's skip these.\n@nostalgiaz : about @pauloortins and the commit which is documentation ->  Let's not worry about it as it's not code. If this person requests it in the future, we can remove.\nSo once @BdMdesigN (who does have quite a few commits) approves, we are good to go!\nThanks!\n. I tried as well... \n. Fantastic!

I located the gem's directory on my system and opened the following file: ./vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap3-switch.css.scss. Since these edits were made within the gem itself, I will instead place these under my projects directory: app/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap_overrides.scss. My SCSS looks like the following after my edits:\nscss\n.bootstrap-switch .bootstrap-switch-handle-on,\n.bootstrap-switch .bootstrap-switch-handle-off,\n.bootstrap-switch .bootstrap-switch-label {\n  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;\n  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  display: inline-block !important;\n  height: 29px;\n  padding: 6px 12px;\n  font-size: 14px;\n  line-height: 20px;\n}\nI visited the official site's examples page.

I hope this helps explain the issue.\nhaml\n:javascript\n  $(\"#onoffswitch\").bootstrapSwitch();\n  $(\"#onoffswitch\").bootstrapSwitch.defaults.size = 'large';\n  $(\"#onoffswitch\").on('switchChange.bootstrapSwitch', function (event, state) {\n    if ( confirm(\"Are you sure?\") ) {\n      update_mode_switch(!state);\n    } else {\n      $(this).bootstrapSwitch('state', !state, true);\n    }\n  });\n. As an update to my above comment... I wanted to use a small switch, so changing the height on that one line affected the switch. The width changed, but not the height. I decided to simply follow @TechplexEngineer's advice in full. Now the switch operates fine. I do not know how to make it \"small\" (we are using .onoffswitch as the class, not .bootstrap-switch), but that is for another day. Please reopen this issue and investigate it.\n. ",

Another common practice used (also in my code in another instance of this same issue) is to use a hidden field first and then have the checkbox, both with the same 'name' attribute. That way, the value always shows up in the POST data, regardless of whether the checkbox is checked or not.\n. Actually, I'm not sure it's the hidden field.

I can understand your doubts :)\nWhat I'm thinking of, is a method like setLabelAsText or something, I don't have a word for it, but it would be something like this (excuse the extremely awesome paintskills):\nhttps://imgur.com/88nXhRO\nThat means, the My awesome label, would become the on/off text. And that would be the only choice. If you choose to use the label as the on/off text, it will always be the on/off text. It would override the current on/off text method.\nI hope my not-so-awesome paintskills explain a bit? I understand, the used text are meant to be descriptive, but users can understand (if you take my example cough mockup), that the when the blue part is highlighted, it's on.\nVice versa, when off, the background would be grey (or whatever color you choose), but the button is obviously on the right, which means \"off\".\n. Not much. Just that it would be labeled inside the switch, instead of having the label outside. As shown in my awesome paint-skills, it's not a needed feature, but just a thought. If you have 20 switches (like me), with all short labels, it would make things look a bit better.\nAlso, it's a tiny bit clearer to the end-user which selection is active and which isn't.\nI'll see if I can fix something real this week, but it might take a bit longer, because I'm somewhat kinda lacking time, as we all are :)\n.

This led me to believe that the input element in the DOM was not being altered.\nIn terms of the change event it seems to me that the event is only triggered when the element is actually clicked. When changing the value using code I think the only way for it to be triggered would be manually. I'll submit a very simple pull request to this effect.\n. Sure thing @nostalgiaz!\nReturning false on a function set using the onSwitchChange option prevents the switch from changing as intended.\nThe standard change event is still not triggered when the switch is changed.

With server side page generation, I guess this is not a problem. But in single page application (my case) or other AJAX async loading cases (when data gets loaded after the initialization of the control)...\nYes, of course, I thought of the same work around, but it forces me to write extra code, and moreover I get the swip animation which in this case is not suitable....\n. @LostCrew : I also tried this option (deactivate the animation), but there is still the animation.\nSee my updated fiddle\n. @LostCrew  OK, thanks, I see it work in your example,  but did you compare my version and yours?

    "Panman8201": "Yeah, thinking through it, the \"switchChange\" event should be triggered since the state changed. At first I was thinking it would be ok since you can get the radio that is \"ON\". But \"observers\" of the other switches need to know when they are changed, for whatever reason.\n. To keep backwards compatibility, what if you introduce a \"stateChange\" event? The \"switchChange\" event will only be triggered when the specific radio/switch is clicked (as per the existing functionality). The \"stateChange\" event will trigger on any radio/state change, including switchChange.\nSo, let's say you have radioA, radioB, radioC. When radioC is clicked it will fire both \"switchChange\" and \"stateChange\" but the other radios will just fire \"stateChange\".\n. @LostCrew Is bootstrap-switch preventing the 'change' event from bubbling up? For some reason I can't get Ember to catch the event, while trying to make a workaround.\nAlso, it would actually be very helpful to have two separate events that I mentioned previously. I have a case where it would be nice to get the \"state\" for every switch (aka stateChange), and another case where I'd just want to get the \"value\" for the switch that was turned \"on\" (aka switchChange). This is for switches as radios of course.\nThanks for this BTW, very, very useful plugin. The only \"extra\" bootstrap widget that I need.\n. Sorry for all the noise on this one, just want to get this fixed before releasing my ember-cli addon.\nHere is the offending line: https://github.com/nostalgiaz/bootstrap-switch/blob/v3.3.1/src/coffee/bootstrap-switch.coffee#L370 \nThe \"change\" event is being triggered on the other radios but because the 'skip' flag is true the \"switchChange\" event is not being triggered, which developers would be looking for. And, because of the e.stopImmediatePropagation() at the top of that handler, the actual \"change\" event is not observable for developers.\nHaving been a while since writing any jQuery plugin specific stuff, and not knowing coffee script, I'm not sure where/how to add a second \"stateChange\" event. But if I get some time I'll try to dig into it and submit a PR.\n. No, it's the short time before javascript is loaded (before bootstrap-switch has time to load). The native HTML behind it is a checkbox or radio, so that's what you'll see at first. That \"flicker\" will differ for each system and network, but should be minimal.\n. Interesting, I think I see what you're talking about using Internet Explorer. (When both on/off labels show up??) Chrome has a slight \"flash\" of the checkbox before the switch loads. But Firefox has no flicker, shows the switch immediately, looks nice.\n. ",

",
    "jasonetwork": "Having the exact same issue. Clicking on the ON/OFF text will fire the switchChange.bootstrapSwitch event correctly. Although, if I click on the \"label\" portion of the switch, the event will fire twice. For example, if the switch is on the ON position (true), and you click the label, the event will fire twice, first returning a state of TRUE, and then FALSE. Otherwise, if you click on the ON/OFF text, it will just return a state of FALSE. Having the problem with any version of Firefox and mobile devices. \nThis is a HUGE problem if you are relying on the state value when the event is fired, not to mention how inefficient it is. If you are using the switch to update a value in a database, it will perform the update twice -- first with the incorrect value.\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated. Was going to use bootstrap switch on a large extranet project, but will cause major issues with the problem described above.\n. Looks like the issue is related to the \"mouseleave\" event under the bootrstapSwitch _labelHandlers. When the label portion of the switch is clicked, it triggers the \"mouseup\" event AS WELL as the \"mouseleave\" event. Problem is, the \"mouseleave\" event calls the mouseup event, thus creating a type of loop that causes the switchChange.bootstrapSwitch event to fire twice. Anyways, here's my quick and solution to the problem (until a permanent fix is implemented):\njavascript\n    var BootstrapSwitch;\n    BootstrapSwitch = (function() {\n      function BootstrapSwitch(element, options) {\n        if (options == null) {\n          options = {};\n        }\n        this.$element = $(element);\n        this.clckevt = false; // <---- ADD THIS HERE!!!!!\n        this.options = $.extend({}, $.fn.bootstrapSwitch.defaults, {\n          state: this.$element.is(\":checked\"),\n          size: this.$element.data(\"size\"),\nUnder _labelHandlers,  change \"mouseup\" to custom \"switcher\" \njavascript\n\"mouseup.bootstrapSwitch touchend.bootstrapSwitch\": (function(_this) { ... } //Change this\n\"switcher.bootstrapSwitch touchend.bootstrapSwitch\": (function(_this) { ... } //To This\nAdd \"click\" to _labelHandlers:\njavascript\n          \"click.bootstrapSwitch\": (function(_this) { //Added for bug fix\n            return function(e) {\n              _this.clckevt = true;\n              return _this.$label.trigger(\"switcher.bootstrapSwitch\");\n            };\n          })(this),\nEdit \"mouseleave\" under _labelHandlers:\njavascript\n          \"mouseleave.bootstrapSwitch\": (function(_this) {\n            return function(e) {\n              if(!_this.clckevt){ //Added for bug fix.\n                return _this.$label.trigger(\"switcher.bootstrapSwitch\");\n              }\n              _this.clckevt = false;\n            };\n          })(this)\nThe above changes creates a \"click\" event which prevent the \"mouseleave\" event from firing when the \"label\" is simply just clicked. The \"clckevt\" variable resets itself, allowing the slider to function normally when the label is not being clicked.  Hopes this helps anybody having the same issue I was having!!!\n. ",

Woops, should probably remove that. npm is the only supported platform. @DarkRake don't mix legacy jQuery/bootstrap with modern frameworks. @H-Max can you link the PR to this issue (Fixes #679). env has a modules: configuration, use that.. https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env#modules. no, that's the wrong place.

I know it doesn't.. Just remove these changes . it's odd that this has changed. This and the css changes makes me think that your build config is different to ours. I think it might be best to keep dist out of sync until a release is cut.. can you avoid making changes to dist/ files when making PRs, as this makes all PRs conflict.. No need for let:\n\njs\nconst poll = (check, interval = 0.5) => {\n   if (!check()) {\n       setTimeout(() => poll(check, interval * 2), interval);\n   }\n}\nThen use it:\njs\npoll(() => (this.$wrapper.is(':visible') && (init() || true)));\nAlthough you'll need to port it to 'standard JS'. Don't we control the creation and visibility of the wrapper anyway?. Sure you can expand out the callback to poll. I don't think you need to clear the timeout because it's already finished by the time the next one is called . I'd probably go for ^1.9.0 || 2^ || 3^. ",

Both Chrome and Firefox took about 5 seconds to display the page with no popups on firefox.  The difference may be is that I added the switches using JS calling bootstrapSwitch() on each one as it was created and then they were all rendered with the switch CSS at once rather than having it applied one by one.\nSo maybe it's the difference in the browsers of handling a lot of changes causing reflow.\n.
