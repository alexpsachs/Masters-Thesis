While decreasing the time a user takes to read the message is not a good idea ( after all, messages are meant to be read ) a _quick prompt_ message for acknowledgement of second action is also desired.

During those time as a developer I would love to go with a principle - \"All messages to be displayed as and when it is due.\".

I however do not own an iPad, you are welcome to play with the theme animation for a solution.  I think a workaround may be achieved by playing with the CSS.  I'll see if I can dig into this as well.\n"

Example: When background-color of body is set with css to fff and you use the example above, it doesen't work. Content is gone.\nWhen the color is set to anything other, it works. Also when called multiple and color is already fff.\nAlso it works when the color is initial fff and i use this:\ndocument.body.style.backgroundColor=\"#888\"  \nhumane.info(\"Test\",function(){document.body.style.backgroundColor=\"#fff\"})        \n\nWeird....\n\nBTW: little flickering also happens, but this is no problem on android. Android apps need a little flickering and jerking. ;-)\n"

I don't mind your api but I think it could get out of hand because I imagine the people will want is to customize the other options based on type and the api could blow up more at that point.\n\n``` js\nhumane.timeout = { error: 2000, success: 500 };\nhumane.clickToClose = { error: true, success: false };\n...\n```\n\nOne idea I'm tossing around is:\n\n``` js\nhumane.error.timeout = 2000;\nhumane.error.clickToClose = true;\n...\n```\n\nThat way you visibly know what you've applied to 'error' e.g.  And standard `humane.timeout, etc..` would be the fallback.\n"

        "body": "I haven't looked at the code, but it seems that humane-js could just fire notifications (like new request) and the individual themes could handle how to display it. For libnotify, it could stack down like you said, or in reverse (should be user definable), whereas for bigbox, it would only allow a single notification at a time.\n\nAlso, why limit it? Sure, nobody should need more than three notifications for a clean UI, but what if some unusual case comes up and a fourth message needs to be shown? This can be said for any arbitrary limit (but I'd say that 10 is too many for any case). Could you make it dev definable?\n\nEach theme could have a range of acceptable maximum notifications and the dev could set that at the offset (could even be at compile time instead of runtime if it's easier).\n"

        "body": "So I go back and forth on this.  The more I think about it, it seems not to fit the style of humane.js.  Notification systems definitely vary on this point for sure.  As a Linux user, I'm used to one notification at a time, linnotify does this, Ubuntu and Gnome Shell have the same concept.  Enso, for Windows, from which the whole Humane concept was from did one message at a time.  humanmsg, the jQuery plugin, from which this project is derived from, had the same concept.\n\nI've used humanmsg for a number of years, used Enso on windows before I switched to Linux, and now use humane.js for everything I do (lots of single page apps) and I've never had a problem where I needed to display more than one message at a time.  And if I did, it never seems to be a problem to wait a couple seconds.  We haven't had a single client complaint about it as well.\n\nMy workaround for this case was allowing forceNew but that was a really crappy hack IMO and I just removed it because we allow all notification levels to be customized now so you can have your errors longer and other messages shorter.  Closing this issue for now.\n"

A notification framework forms part of the UI and as such must be as flexible and extensible as is required to meet user experience requirements. (Usually no such analog exists for app logging.) Furthermore, app logging is very \"historical\", decoupled, searchable, etc.; notifications are none of these and are only useful in the present.   \n\nOn Jan 25, 2012, at 7:47 PM, Marc Harterreply@reply.github.com wrote:\n\n> I don't think this is a good idea and here is why.

        "body": "So I'd essentially be splicing two themes together in to a custom theme which utilizes one theme style with 'info' / 'log' type and the other with the 'error' / 'success' type?\n\nThat could work, though I've found that the jackedup seems to be a nice combination of bold and unobtrusive, I kind of like it everywhere right now.  I can still foresee instances where I may want to split out multiple themes.\n\nHave you thought about allowing users to add a class attribute in the humane.create() builder function?  That way one could create an error like:\n\n``` javascript\nvar error = humane.create({ type: 'error', class: 'fatal', waitForMove: true, });\nerror('Yikes');\n```\n\nWhich would add a .humane-fatal class instead of the .humane-error?  ... Actually, I just checked through your code and I'm wondering if you couldn't just do that by adding your own 'type'?  It seems like you may only actually using the type to append on to the humane- className and to fire custom events.\n\nSo you might actually be able to extend an existing theme pretty easily with the existing codebase which would also come with it's own custom events to handle a 'fatal' error type differently from a regular 'error' type, as well as giving it a slightly different skin. I still think there might be some value to adding additional custom event and class options so you could extend 'error' type in to 'fatal' and still get an onerror event along with the onfatal, but correct me if I'm wrong, it seems like just the custom type extension would work with minimal updates... what do you think?\n"

I think I could easily go back to using the original style, add a single .humane-autosave rule which changes the top, font-size, min-height and width to be less obtrusive and utilize that custom notifier for that specific case.\n\nYou should think about updating the Custom Notifier section of the docs to let people know it's more flexible than they may realize.  Awesome work, btw, simple, light and unassuming.. I'm thinking of using it as a model for a humane-like tooltip plugin for handling notifications which are specific to an element or location on the page.\n"

I'm thinking about enhancements to this API that would make it easier for you do what you want... \n"

If I add a button clicked to trigger another notifier, this  first notifier will appear first and then the triggered one will also show up.\nIn IE9 the problem is I could not use Jquery's document.ready to replace the onload function, you can try it yourself.\nIn Chrome and other Browsers I had tried they all worked fine.\n\nThanks again for your concern!\n"

Yet it works and the browser is caching it, but the first time there's some loading delay...\n\nThe idea is to add warning signs, icons and other images wich will improve the UX/UI. A new theme with image as a background may not have the desired effect though.\n"

It has worked well for us too (for almost a year now, wow time goes fast).\n\nI don't know what \"multiple instances\" is, but hopefully for someone with more familiarity with the internals of humane it would not be hard to adapt the changes.\n\nThe inline styles were indeed a quick hack to make the commit small-as-possible and should be amended to play nicely with themes.\n\nThanks for your feedback. Take care.\n"
