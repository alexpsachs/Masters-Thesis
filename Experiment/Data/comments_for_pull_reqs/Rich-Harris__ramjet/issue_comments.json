By the sounds of it it's an IE11-only bug (don't have an IE10 VM to hand), so that'll involve some browser sniffing.\n\nSeriously, IE team, just go home. We would all be so much better off if you went and did something else that didn't involve software.\n"

The offset parent is only needed so ramjet can account for its top/left margin (which upsets the coordinates otherwise) - if the position is fixed then that's irrelevant anyway, so we presumably need to behave as if there was no margin.\n\nLeaving some breadcrumbs for myself: according to [this SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11639664/2742396) an element has no `offsetParent` if it's not a descendant of `<body>`, has `position: fixed`, or it or any ancestor has `display: none`.\n"

Only thing is that it would mean that we couldn't then use the arguments to `done` for anything else, if we came up with a better use for them, so we'd need to be sure that it was worthwhile, especially since we've got `.bind`. Personally I've only ever used a closure for `done`...\n\n``` js\nvar from = someNode;\nvar to = someOtherNode;\n\nramjet.transform( from, to, {\n  done: function () {\n    // we can already access `from` and `to` here...\n    // no need to have them as arguments\n  }\n});\n```\n\n...so there's not much to be gained in that scenario.

It's not totally straightforward - if the elements are the same shape, it works...\n\n![border-radius](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1162160/7458641/f7466bf6-f263-11e4-847c-c9f1c5e2152a.gif)\n\n...but if they're a different shape, the transform stretches the corners so they don't overlap:\n\n![border-radius2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1162160/7458649/0d7f61de-f264-11e4-8606-fd7eb57aef78.gif)\n\n(It's subtle, but you can probably see what I'm talking about - the corners don't _quite_ line up.) So we'll have to compensate for the transform when setting the border-radius (I didn't realise this until just now, but [you can use two radii for each corner](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius), which is exactly what we need to compensate for the 'stretch', which is great news because it means that this is in fact possible.)\n\nHopefully I'll get a chance to work on this soon.\n\nAnyway, to your example: is the original border radius preserved, at least? It looks as though it isn't, but when I do the same thing locally I can see the blue circle beneath the translucent green square. Which is odd...\n"

Appending both cloned elements to a single parent, which is then appended to `<body>`, _should_ work, if we calculate the cumulative opacity and transform matrix. (That's basically what already happens with SVG elements, albeit [imperfectly](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/ramjet/issues/6), but it's easier there because SVG elements have a `node.getScreenCTM()` method that returns the current screen-space transform matrix - it's tricker for HTML elements.)\n\nWhat you lose is\n- z-index (because there's no global stacking order you can inspect and modify - the rules for the application of z-index are pretty wild, IIRC)\n- clipping, e.g. if part of an element is outside a parent with `overflow: hidden`\n- possibly some other stuff we haven't thought of?\n\nMy hunch is that the trade-off is worth it, if it means better visual fidelity in all cases at the expense of some glitchiness in a small, contrived minority.\n"

Say you are transition between .5 opacity on the first element and 1 opacity on the second element.  Then at the halfway point of the animation, where time T = .5 then you should be able to calculate two opacity values such that their combined opacity =.75 and the bottom one is still 50% visible.  So at that time the bottom element might have opacity .6 and the top layer has opacity .3 which would get you close to .75 opacity (I'm still working on the calculation, need to figure out the compositing formula).\n\nDoes that make sense?  If this works then you shouldn't have to lose the SVG support.\n"

        "body": "Right, so the problem is rather easy when you're transitioning from opacity 1 to 1.  Then you just make the bottom layer 100% and transition the top layer. But it gets much harder when you're transitioning from  one partially opaque element to another.  In this case you can't just make the bottom layer 100% because it needs to know how to transition evenly between the two values.\n\nI think theres a formula that can solve this perfectly.  So in your getKeyframes function, it would have a much smarter opacity value than just using (t) and (1-t).  It would handle cases where elements have different opacity levels and transition them smoothly.\n"

        "body": "Hmm... well I have a formula that works by transitioning the opacity of the child elements. It has the added benefit of also being able to animate the alpha channel of rgba backgroundColors. I don't think there is anything that can be done for transitioning something like an image (png) with a transparent background, but that is a whole different bucket of crabs.  I think in that case you just fallback to using the `crossfade` option.\n\nIt also can work without creating a new container for the new elements.  Do you think there is a benefit of creating the new container?  I'm not sure if its a good thing or a bad thing...  definitely has different behaviour when parent elements have filters, clip paths, overflow:hidden, etc.\n\nEither way... I'll push a branch once I have these changes finished tonight and you can see which you prefer.\n"

        "body": "@babakness Good question! I've been a little quite on this repo lately as I've been working on some other projects, but I do have an experimental branch which gets us halfway there.\n\nIt's a little tricky though. Because the elements could be inside layers of elements with their own transformations, and they then need to be transformed _further_ so that they can move as one, it's not practical to describe the start and end transformations as a series of `rotate`/`scale`/`translate` commands - instead we have to multiply transformation matrices.\n\nThis makes rotation difficult, because if you interpolate between two transformation matrices that describe different rotations, the effect doesn't look like rotation, because the corners of the box travel in a straight line to their destination. It looks more like shearing than rotation. The best we can hope for is to use [matrix decomposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decomposition) to figure out a path that looks more natural. That's my plan, anyway. (A long time ago, I wrote a small matrix utility library which [does decomposition among other things](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/Neo/blob/master/Neo.js#L454-L842). Hopefully the code still works...)\n\nThis is what the experimental branch looks like right now:\n\n![transform](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1162160/7694349/0c7f1ac8-fdad-11e4-9b8a-d299954c6976.gif)\n\nWith matrix decomposition it should look slightly better. (The next trick will be to get it working with 3d transforms...)\n\nUnfortunately, rotating 720 degrees is totally impossible with this technique. As soon as you go past 180 degrees you lose information (i.e. 240 degrees is assumed to mean -120 degrees, and 360 degrees means no change) - there's just no way to recover it. I've wondered about providing a hook for a custom interpolation function which would be able to do that sort of ad hoc transformation - possibly in a future version.\n"

I was thinking that the text of the original css would be preserved but its not! \n\nThe shearing effect looks great too, more like morphing than rotating. It has a more liquid feel. Actually wiggling and jiggling the end points of the animation, sort of like the demos do spatially, but with a shear effect, would be lively and organic. \n\nThanks for the info, I learned from this!\n"

It seems like only the clone of the original object does this, not the other object. i.e. transition from a to b, a animates correctly to b's updated position, but the clone of b animates to b's former position.\n\nEDIT:\nLooks like it was resolved by making sure that the container for my divs that were going to transition was set to 'position: relative.'\n\nMight want to give that a try if you're having this problem.\n"

As an internal implementation detail, it didn't really make sense as there are no performance benefits over CSS animations (as far as I can see), while the polyfill introduces a severe penalty because the animations are timer-based IIRC and have to run on the main thread.\n\nBut you make an interesting case about composition. I was planning to (eventually) make `ramjet.transform` return an object with things like `pause` and `reverse` methods - perhaps it would make more sense if that object was compatible with the web animations API.

I guess you could try and figure things out on a 'best effort' basis (reading inline styles and `<style>` tags, making AJAX requests for linked stylesheets and parsing their contents), but it would add a huge amount of complexity, where as a hook that allowed developers to supply their own interpolator would solve the problem (at the cost of a little bit more work for the developer) without any of that brittle magic.\n"

It never saw production, it just meant I couldn't update to 0.4.7. I didn't get round to trying `appendToBody` \u2013 I'm hoping we'll be able to get Ramjet to figure out the right behaviour for any combination of fixed/static/relative etc (I just ran into another issue, probably introduced with this PR, involving relatively positioned children of statically positioned parents. I can fix the isolated test case I've got locally, but need to beef up the test suite to ensure it doesn't break anything else).\n"

This is actually deliberate though: `jsnext:main` is only interested in the module format (i.e. ES modules as opposed to AMD/CJS/UMD/globals), not the content of the code itself. The rationale is that I should be able to use ES module aware tooling (Rollup, Webpack 2) to bundle my app for delivery without having to compile my dependencies (which may be on a different Babel version to me, or have different config, or need specific plugins, or any of the other hundreds of things that can cause problems). Not compiling dependencies also makes builds a lot quicker.\n"
