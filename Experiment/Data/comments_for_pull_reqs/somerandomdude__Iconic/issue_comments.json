I would like to create a\nJavascript version of Iconic which allows the rendering of icons in Canvas\nand/or WebGL.

Quick question, would it be just as easy to bind each icon to the Unicode decimal or hex value? The reason I mention this is that many of the characters I will be binding icons to don't actually have a character associated with them. That being said, that's not a deal-killer.\n\nThanks again so very much. I'll post updates the second I have them.\n"

I wrote about the subject here: http://somerandomdude.com/2012/01/31/font-embedding-icons-the-right-way/. Having one document icon map to the Unicode document glyph and another map to an unused glyph seems semantically inappropriate.  \n\nI would prefer to have this unified font exist in a fork. I think a unified font is useful, but I strongly support proper Unicode mapping when possible. To me, this seems akin to putting regular and bold weights of the letter 'a' in one font where the regular weight was mapped to 'a' and the other was mapped to a character in the private range. \n"

It's more \"different symbols\", than \"different style\". I think, the proper way is just to request adding new glyphs to unicode standard. And it's a normal pracrtice to add \"not existing\" symbols in PUA until that happens.\n2. In practice, it's more convenient (for users) to have all icons in one file too.\n3. Thechnically, i can maintain separate repo. But design is not my business, and i'd prefer to return results in upstream. I don't ask to remove Stroke/Fill. Just to add third variand. It will not cost you anything. Iconnic font files still have some bugs, and it's much more easy to fix those in single place.\n"

        "body": "First, I hope you like the pictograms despite its shortcomings.\n\nSecond, I'm a graphic designer, not a developer and the pictograms are carefully design to work not only as a web font but also in many other situations. \n\nThe Entypo pictograms is optimized for a size of 20x20 px at 72dpi. As a graphic designer i felt that 16 px is to small and 32 px to big and by making them 20x20 they would also render well at 15x15. So it is at that size as the pictograms should look as sharp as possible.\n\nAt a size of 20x20 all pictograms are also designed to have a even hight and width so they always align nicely in the middle of\u2014let's say\u2014a square 30x30 px button.\n\nThe aesthetics of the pictograms has also been high importance to me apart from the obvious of them being functional. So my approach has\u2014in many cases\u2014been more optical than mechanical in getting the perfect result. \n\nThe font's UPM size is 1000\u2014as it should be for an OpenType font. So to achieve the same result when using Entypo as a font as you get when using vectors\u2014or a result as close as possible\u2014I had the option of making the glyphs either 1000 or 500 high and so they should render perfect at 20pt or 40pt. I went for the second option. None of the options would render the glyphs at a perfect size next to a text in the same size.\n\nThe pictograms are also design to vertically alight to middle in relation to each other. \n\nI'll see what changes I will make to the font in the next release. Better hinting and 20-30 new glyphs will be a part of it for sure.\n\nMaybe I can send you some stripped down versions playing with the dimensions for you to try out. Would you be up for that?\n\nAlso. I'm on parental leave with my two daughters so I don't find to much time to work on this right now.\n\nCheers\n"

I am off to Denver next week for Drupalcon, but after that I can get down to business. \n\nPersonally, I think your approach of an even height and width has attributed to the reason they work well in lists, however they do hover above the baseline. It just goes to prove I need more test cases than just lists.. I will test with buttons and size variance as well. \n\nExcited to hear the thoughts of @somerandomdude around the variances and approaches that can be taken from here.. \n\nI certainly have a lot to learn about fonts, mostly what I know about them has been from a front-end developer perspective, as my initial post likely depicts. I'm a great believer in font icons (pictograms), and I think they will ease the pain front end devs have to endure with upcoming hi-res monitors on the web (most notably the iPad HD). \n\nThe Compass extension I am building is being created to help front-end developers who use sass/compass deal with implementing pictograms, by writing less css but still giving control over them (the control part I have yet to get to) and by deploying icon sets.. The struggle I have is the great variances between icon-sets .. and as you can see from the screenshot there is definitely a wide variance. \n\nI am willing to just adjust the code in the extension to deal with each set, but I would feel much better contributing back to the existing projects and to the overall standardization process if there is one, at the very least I may have to smooth out the fonts just for the extension itself if I had the source files (which i do for iconic). \n\nI'm willing to help Entypo get set up with git and move the project more into the realm of Iconic if that's desirable.. as I'm sure @somerandomdude would be willing to at least provide input as well. Tis the nature of open source, right? \n"

Iconic was designed for some very specific purposes (a large range of legibility, usually down to 8 pixels) and a \u00fcber minimal style (often too minimal) based on an 8x8 grid system. This limits what icons I can make and how I can make them.\n\nThat said, I am _highly_ considering making a new icon set without those tight restrictions and just go for aesthetics. I feel very confident that I could provide a top-tier icon set that would be a good fit for something like Bootstrap. I am seriously mulling it, I just need the time and resources to make it happen. \n"

It should be ok for you with minimal changes.\n\nDon't know, if you are interested. I think it would be more effective to cleanup your repo - remove raster deals (as rarely used) & switch scripts to `font-builder`. Then i'll be able to effectively maintain your font (as i do for Entypo). Result will be like this https://github.com/fontello/iconic-uni.font , but with separate filled/stroke & old mapping, if those are important for you.\n"

I have recently integrated your currently release of Iconic and I love it!  Scalable glyphs in colors of my choosing... woohoo!\n> I could use a few extra glyphs/icons related to DVCS operations... if you'd be willing to design them.  :)\n> Concepts I want to represent:\n> - open a pull/merge request (I am currently using your share glyph)\n> - close a pull/merge request or, more simply, merge\n> - a group of commits (I am currently using one of your cycle/loop glyphs to indicate 'changes')\n> - open issue / bug report / task\n> - close issue / bug report / task\n>   You can see Iconic in action in Gitblit at my demo site for the current SNAPSHOT release here:  https://next-gitblit.rhcloud.com\n>   Thanks for your consideration,\n>   -James\n>   ---\n>   Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n>   https://github.com/somerandomdude/Iconic/issues/29\n"
