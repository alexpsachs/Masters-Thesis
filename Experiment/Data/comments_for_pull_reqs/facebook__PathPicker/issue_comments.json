I do obviously list the cd command right after the clone, but in general this seems unnecessary since the symlink resolution should be able to handle the source being right there.\n\nGoing to close this one out since I think #16 fixes this, but let me know if after that it's still an issue!\n"

This is a pretty beefy diff so it will take a while to look over, but just some high level comments:\n- how does this work on light terminal themes or terminals with different default colors? we just added support for using default colors so I want to make sure this looks ok\n- this basically just respects the color formatting of the input right, not adds any custom coloring? im wondering if theres an easier way to translate terminal color codes to ncurses color codes...\n"

I would try it out!\n\nWhat I don't like about buffers is that its not visually clear from the get-go that you've actually opened all the files, and a lot of people do `:qa` instead of `:n` so they dont even see the other files.\n\nWhat about splitting files into tabs instead? or throw up a warning?\n\nI actually think we should have some kind of user preferences file to store things like this is maybe the best bet\n"

        "body": "@pcottle yeah it's a big diff and I also don't like a lot of how I hacked it. I realized this morning that the printing for matched lines can be much simpler now that we can actually inject the attributes we want (underscore, background color) directly into the formatted line; we wouldn't need to print the before(), then middle, then after(). Also, there's some complexity around keeping the `formatted_line` versus the stripped line and doing matching and keeping the indices in order, but if I'm super awake and actually white board the cases out I think I can rewrite it to use regex and split out the lines into formatted regions.\n- Good point: it should use -1 for the background color so it uses the default. Did someone just add `use_default_colors()`? I rebased and merged pretty quickly and noticed that but didn't `git blame` to see how that cropped up; when I was hacking I don't remember it there\n- yes - it should take the input color formatting, apply the right attrs, and only override when the matched line requires it because you're hovering over the proposed link. and i was hella surprised that there wasn't something already out there to do this... I searched but couldn't find anything except a super old post in a google group about it.\n\nI am going to work on it this weekend a little bit on the plane if I can.\n"

Output looks like:\n\n```\nshopt -s expand_aliases\nif [ -f ~/.zshrc ]; then\n  source ~/.zshrc\nfi\nif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then\n  source ~/.bashrc\nfi\nif [ -f ~/.bash_profile ]; then\n  source ~/.bash_profile\nfi\nif [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then\n  source ~/.bash_aliases\nfi\necho \"executing command:\"\necho \"go  './banana.py'\"\ngo  './banana.py'\n```\n\nWorks well for bash and you get real sourcing. Looks like the zsh equivalent is:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/23258413/expand-aliases-in-non-interactive-shells\n`setopt aliases` ?\n\nWhat do you guys think about doing that? Seems less hacky that introspecting the process ID\n\n(btdubs I guess I shouldn't pollute the repos paths right? ill try to do PR's in the future)\n"

Curious about the workflow here -- the only tricky thing is now the execution of the shell script is split between python and the bash script (since now we have the `os.system('sh ~/.fbPager.sh; rm -f ~/.fbPager.sh'`) so it complicates things like #59 where we need to decorate the bash script with a few headers\n\nAlso does this work for editing files? We would need to connect to `dev/tty` in that case right?\n\nI almost wonder if we could implement this instead as pure bash, something like\n\n```\n$PYTHONCMD \"$BASEDIR/src/processInput.py\"\nfunction runChooser {\n  exec 0<&-\n  chose.py // etc\n  sh ~/.fbPager.sh < /dev/tty\n}\n\nif $1 == '--keep-open'; then\n  while [true]:\n    runProgram()\nelse\n  runProgram()\nfi\n```\n\nsince we save the pickled selection and the files, this should give almost the exact same behavior without introducing the code complexity. what do you think?\n"

However something like:\n[Pick](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/announcing-pick)\n[Bash Dialog](https://github.com/ramses0/bash-dialog)\nor\n[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)\n\nMight work better for arbitrary matches, since they have fuzzy-matching and all sorts of other goodies. We are going to be adding on file validation soon (where we actually do an `os.path.isfile`) as well, so this fork might become harder to maintain as we narrow in on the file case.\n\nAnyways interesting fork though!

        "body": "> It would also make more sense because a unix tool should try to do one thing well. I think with this in mind, it would even make sense to have two utilities that could together work as a path picker : the first one which does only the conversion from an output to a list of filenames, the second one which gives an UI to select one or more elements from a list.\n\nYeah, this has come up a bunch internally and externally. I'm a huge fan of the unix philosophy but I actually think a lot of the value of PathPicker is added by being a \"one-stop shop\" for everything you need to do with paths. Had we gone more unixy we would either have just:\n1. built the parsing of files and outputted those, or\n2. built the UI selector and worked with any kind of input\n\nBut neither of these would have been that great. With 1) developers would still have to do awkward xargs things (or put the command in a subshell like `$(ls -l | fpp)` which I find annoying). With 2) the input would require a lot of prep with regexes and `sed` to get into an acceptable format for selection (think of all the work `git diff` or `git diff --stat` requires)\n\nso we had to go into brave new territory and do a very non-unixy thing here, but I think it ended up really striking a perfect spot between utility and simplicity.\n"

I actually use my bashrc to log onto my development server for facebook (automatically) so its kind of an aggressive script to source, but hopefully my situation is not super common.\n\n```\n[pcottle:~/Dropbox (Facebook)/wip/PathPicker:master]$ git show --stat | ./fpp\ngetting input\nexecuting command:\nga  '/Users/pcottle/Dropbox (Facebook)/wip/PathPicker/src/output.py'\n```\n\n(`ga` is aliased to git add for me)\n\nshould work 100% for bash, and hoping zsh is the same way. can anyone test? \n"

In that case, I'd have to open up `git diff` and then remember which files I wanted to touch and then open up `git status` and then `fpp` on that? \n\nHm, actually 90% of the time I actually probably want page up/down by page, and then up|down on matched line. \n\nIt might be confuzzling but another option I'd probably want to prototype out as well is \"navigate on matched lines and then page per page\". Terrible description, but what I mean is, up|down move the cursor thru matched lines until it can't find another one on the same page. Then it moves the page forward and shows the next text page, and then you nagivate thru that. It's more of a change to the scroll algorithm.\n\nHowever this might mean you would scroll to a page w/ no matched text and then you're forced to press down again. And in a very big input I'm not sure if this is better or worse.\n"

[Here](https://github.com/jbnicolai/tmux-fpp) it is!\n\nWhen running fpp normally in tmux it works exactly as expected. However, you have to remember to insert `fpp` in the pipeline when executing your command. What this plugin allows is for the user to press a key combination (`prefix + i`) and run fpp over the most recently created `stdout` and `stderr` in the active TTY.\n\nIf you look at this gif in the original issue you see `fpp` is never executed manually on `git diff`. The user ran `git diff`, realized he wanted to pick a path and pressed `prefix + i` afterwards.\n"

And you're certainly right - hitting a marked key with no result is awkward.  But IMO that's a symptom of interspersing actionable items among unactionable ones.  I think this would be better solved with color - for example, green for actionable, or perhaps just greying out the unactionable.\n"

There's a simplicity to splitting the workflow into two steps;  something like this:\n- enter command pipeline: `foo | bar | fpp`\n- select files -> ENTER\n\nSo, at least to me, it seems like it'd be more natural to fit in applying commands in the first step rather than after the file selection process. I'm not sure what the alias support specifically entails, but I suppose I'm looking to be able to create some specialized fpp aliases. I can hack around it by abusing $EDITOR so this is certainly not imperative. I'm currently doing this:\n`function fpp-add { EDITOR='git add' fpp }`\n"

As for the actual builds, last I heard the sandcastle/Fog team(s) were working on getting Debian VMs on Sandcastle so we can do our CI/builds that way; I got access to a couple VMs but never really got it set up, and haven't heard anything more about the actual infra and CI stuff there.\n\nFeel free to grab me in the office if you want to chat; sometime May 25 or after would be best unless this is urgent, I'm working on the HHVM lockdown right now.\n"

        "body": "Thanks for checking out this ticket @pedrox. First, I'd like to make a clarification. When I say \"dotfile\" I mean \"any file that begins with a period\"[[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-file)].\n\n> I believe dot files inside directory are not a problem.\n\nI confirmed that PathPicker does **not** recognize dotfiles within a directory by adding the following case to `test.py` on the latest master branch commit.\n\n``` py\n{\n    'input': 'tmp/.gitignore',\n    'match': True,\n    'file': 'tmp/.gitignore',\n    'num': 0\n}\n```\n\n``` bash\n$ git log -n1 | head -n1\ncommit 7b0bef202b9f4783197459e26fe658f404b99188\n$ python src/test.py\n...\n======================================================================\nFAIL: testFileMatch (__main__.TestParseFunction)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"src/test.py\", line 244, in testFileMatch\n    self.checkFileResult(testCase)\n  File \"src/test.py\", line 252, in checkFileResult\n    testCase['input'])\nAssertionError: Line \"tmp/.gitignore\" did not match any regex\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 5 tests in 0.007s\n\nFAILED (failures=2, errors=1)\n```\n\n> This is a duplicate of #7.\n\nTo my reading, issue #7 is about detecting files with no extensions (e.g. `Makefile`). While this issue is similar, I would suggest that this ticket is _not_ a duplicate of #7 because it's quite possible to have a dotfile with an extension (e.g. `.env.production` or `.hidden.txt`).\n"

        "body": "Hey @bradparks, thanks for your interest in the project!\n\nWe do have the `A` shortcut which will toggle **all** the files' selection mode, so thats at least something you can use when you have a lot of files.\n\nRegex and fuzzy searching did come up earlier when we were brainstorming the project, but we decided to stick to path matching early on to not try to do too many things at once. We're already criticized for doing too many things (its not unixy) so adding fuzzy search would make that worse. Besides I think excellent tools like [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) would be a better match, or you could simply just process the input before sending it into fpp.\n\nClosing it out for now but an interesting idea, its all about striking a balance\n"

I'd be fine with pointing towards `fpp-git` in AUR since we won't have to worry about updating the release (downside is that it'll run a less stable version of the code, aka master)\n\nAnyone have any objections to pointing to `fpp-git`? Or should we do that + `pacaur`?\n\nAlso thanks @jwatzman for the comment! Will ping you if we don't get any community contributions that work. I do agree that this is much easier than building hhvm releases\n"

See the status.relativePaths config option below.\n\nEmphasis mine. :cry: :sob: You can of course turn this off but who will do that:\n\n> If the config variable status.relativePaths is set to false, then all paths shown are relative to the repository root, not to the current directory.\n\nWhereas of course git diff (and a bunch of other git commands) are made relative to the top level tree:\n\n```\n[pcottle:~/Dropbox (Facebook)/wip/PathPicker:master]$ git diff HEAD~2 --stat\n src/colorPrinter.py  |  2 +-\n src/parse.py         | 16 ++++++++--------\n src/processInput.py  |  1 +\n src/screenControl.py |  1 -\n src/test.py          | 10 +++++-----\n 5 files changed, 15 insertions(+), 15 deletions(-)\n[pcottle:~/Dropbox (Facebook)/wip/PathPicker:master]$ cd src/\n[pcottle:~/Dropbox (Facebook)/wip/PathPicker/src:master]$ git diff HEAD~2 --stat\n src/colorPrinter.py  |  2 +-\n src/parse.py         | 16 ++++++++--------\n src/processInput.py  |  1 +\n src/screenControl.py |  1 -\n src/test.py          | 10 +++++-----\n 5 files changed, 15 insertions(+), 15 deletions(-)\n```\n\nI feel like we have two options:\n1. Dangerously introspect into the format of the piped input and detect if its a git status command, and then totally rework our logic. not ideal\n2. use filesystem validation to check for top-level git directory path prepending and, if that fails, switch to `./` and check again.\n\nI'll take a crack at 2. later today, since we need to move in that direction regardless\n"

        "body": "Hey @mknecht, this has been discussed a pair amount before (see #69) -- I think going 100% unix philosophy actually detracts one of the main value adds of PathPicker which is that it's a one-stop shop for the whole workfow that progress in logical order.\n\nI think something like https://github.com/mooz/percol does the \"select and pipe\" workflow really well, so if we switched to that we'd be an inferior version of that toll :P\n\nThe downside with \"select and pipe\" is that you have to compose your command ahead of time:\n\n`git checkout $(git branch -va | percol)`\nor\n`rm -rf $(ls -l | percol)`\n\nmentally you have to go from:\n- What input do I have? What am I going to select out? and then what command do I want to run?\n- Ok lets compose that command based on the subshell results of the input command piped to the picker\n\nWhereas with PathPicker (imo) you just go:\n- I have some stdin -- lets pipe\n- Sweet, lets select this\n- I want to do.... this command (`/me types it in`)\n- boom!\n\nIt's more straightforward in my opinion. @KendallHopkins was asking about this last night at dinner.\n\nAnyways closing out in the meantime, but I think #72 could work **really** well for the alias workflow\n"

Sure we could do filesystem validation to check these cases, but it's important to note that if we want to hit matches like that, we have to either:\n- Test every word (and if including spaces, every possible word+space combo) to detect if its a filesystem. this has a big complexity cost\n- special case the git status situation with a special regex that looks for modified / added / removed / moved / etc\n\nThe latter is the better bet here. For the git status input you just mentioned, doing a basic back-of-the-envelope calc yields that we would have to do 50 filesystem checks for word-like files:\n\n```\n>>> input = '''\n... On branch master\n... Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.\n... Changes not staged for commit:\n...   (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n...   (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n... \n...     modified:   irbrc\n...     modified:   pryrc\n...     modified:   rspec\n... \n... no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n... '''\n>>> len([word for word in input.split(' ') if len(word) > 0])\n50\n```\n\nAnd that's for a 9 line input. now say if you pipe an entire git diff command into fp -- say its ~1k lines, that means we might do ~5k filesystem checks.\n\nWe'll move in this direction eventually but I do want to point out how overmatching can be dangerous\n"

However I got it working in 7753a7385cdc3cbb79e502799134521f82a92254\n\nBasically then `ScreenForTest` can record the output of the curses commands and produce some actual expected output which we can record and test against. then we can add test cases for things like #92 and test on all versions of python too\n\n`unittest` was gonna be used regardless\n"

LOL. So it's super important.\n\nIt's an interesting conversation, and I generally believe that unit testing is more efficient, tends to be less fragile, and provides more value. I'd like for us to write some unit tests utilizing the new curser mock (which is excellent) and the input module (which is again great).\n\nTo give a specific example, I would be very interested in writing tests that would exercise the chrome, the scroll bar, the command entry mode, the color printing, the forthcoming x-mode, etc. in a unit testing fashion. \n\nFor chrome, for example, I would initialize the chrome object, send it the curses wrapper, and then assert that it called addstr at the right places and with the right strings.

I tend to believe in code versus configuration. It's a bit of a `gulp` versus `grunt` conversation.

I hadn't yet merged upstream with my master, so I was able to read the diffs clearly, but that's not always true for everybody.\n\nYeah sorry, I always get freaked out about losing work so I push often. I had a whole separate branch with the ~10 diffs needed for this stacked, but I guess since I rebased instead of squashing+merging it was harder to read. I didn't realize people read commits that closely! I'll try to do better in the future\n\n> I tend to feel that it's difficult to really cover and exercise all corner cases via integration testing, but on the flip side, just because you test all the components doesn't mean it all works. LOL. So it's super important.\n\nYeah we've actually seen a big swing towards integration testing internally at FB, and I'm a huge fan of it. Some unit tests (especially those with automocking) only cover a very very shallow layer of code functionality, and the gaps between code (which are the hardest to unit test) is where the majority of issues can be found. But this way we get piped stdin, keyboard input, and **frame-by-frame** inspection of the output which is pretty nice\n\n> For chrome, for example, I would initialize the chrome object, send it the curses wrapper, and then assert that it called addstr at the right places and with the right strings. Then when I say move the scrollbar I assert it clears the right things and then it draws the new scroll bar at the right place.\n\nYeah the curses / screen wrapper totally allows us to write those tests as well -- so I think it's good either way. My only worry about asserting individual `addstr` calls is that you can achieve the final output of the screen in multiple ways (with many different orderings or types of addstr calls), so its fairly implementation detaily. Hence why we only compare the final screen, regardless of _how_ it was achieved\n\nI think tomorrow I'll try to add a mode that records some kind of attribute-based logic, so it shows which parts are underlined and which parts arent.\n\nthen filesystem validation and that command-passing mode if appropriate\n"

        "body": "> Yeah sorry, I always get freaked out about losing work so I push often. I had a whole separate branch with the ~10 diffs needed for this stacked, but I guess since I rebased instead of squashing+merging it was harder to read. I didn't realize people read commits that closely! I'll try to do better in the future\n\nI think you had a branch but you merged it and I didn't know which branch it was when I first started reading. I was hoping to read a github branch:branch diff, and I ended up reading my master against upstream master which was clear and not per commit. I think we all commit pretty often nowadays which is why the value of the branch diff is so high now. Like I think `screentestDI` branch was basically what I was looking for but I couldn't find a merge commit for it in the first couple of commits in master so I got lost. \n\n> Yeah we've actually seen a big swing towards integration testing internally at FB, and I'm a huge fan of it. \n\nI haven't decided either way how I feel about it yet. This is getting off topic and I would be totally happy to get a beer and discuss this off-line. I do feel that there is value in full stack integration tests but that we don't yet as an industry have good knowledge about how to write unit-integration tests. I want to test the peanut butter glue that lives between the two slices of toast in isolation, as opposed to testing the entire PBJ sandwich as a whole.\n\n> My only worry about asserting individual addstr calls is that you can achieve the final output of the screen in multiple ways (with many different orderings or types of addstr calls), so its fairly implementation detaily\n\nRight, right, the tests would still wait for the entire result to be composed, just like the current integration test does, but would only assert on the correct values of parts of the screen that is \"interesting to that test\", as opposed to the complete screen. \n\n> I think tomorrow I'll try to add a mode that records some kind of attribute-based logic, so it shows which parts are underlined and which parts arent.\n\nFor this I would suggest actually writing out the format specifiers using the code in `colorprinter`; e.g. when you see a setattr in the curses mock, write out the corresponding format specifier. You only need to write a special case when addstr directly holds an attribute too, and that can be easily achieved by saving and then restoring the existing attribute. This way, the resulting recoded output can actually just be catt'ed on the console and get the real, colored and underlined text you're supposed to see. additionally your input can contain the attribute format specifiers as well. \n"

If we disabled using the old selection, all we could do is print out the usage command.\n\nWhat situation are you in where you want that to happen?\n\nmaybe its easier to run something like:\n\n```\nfpp --clean; fpp\n```\n\nthat takes care of clearing out the old result / pickled selection / anything else we have? I think thats more straightforward than something like \"dont use old result but im not giving you input either so... just print the `usage()` message\" with a separate flag.\n\nOpen to the PR though if theres something i didnt think of\n"

However using dependency injection or some kind of global module seemed overkill, and adding a flag to disable it seemed backwards as well (it should be a straight improvement).\n\nThe one thing I wish we could resolve is `matchLine` does the `prependDir` check once, and then we have to do the prependDir check again (with the same bool param threaded in) to actually format the LineMatch object. Solving this would require a big refactor though...\n"

I would advocate for a `settings` object that's globally accessible; we can repurpose the `ScreenFlags` class for this, because basically it's about the same kind of issue: \"what are the configurations for this object\". `ScreenFlags` currently figures out \"what the user set as the configuration\". We can combine the two, make it a singleton object, and call it a day. There is some complication about pickling: when loading a previous pickle, you'd also want to load the previous settings as well, but this can be resolved by pickling the settings as well.\n2. Dealing with `matchline`: Yes, it's a bit annoying as well. I agree. A bigger refactor here would be needed, but it's also necessary. It's obviously clear because we do file stuff and parsing paths etc in a file called `format`, LOL. \n\nBoth of these things are things I will try to make PRs for, but first I want to fix up the space printing dirty/non-dirty thing. :)\n"

I almost think its a bit more clear to do whitespace printing from the untoggled-input to the chrome boundaries than to do what we were doing earlier, which was painting basically an \"arrow length\" of whitespace after\n"

I know I've done the thing where you select half the line, copy, select the other half, go back halfway to add the missing '/', all the while cursing...\n\nBecause we are a pipe, I think the tools before us assume \"infinite width screen\", basically, so we have the full path = good so we can resolve it, and we can abbrev as we wish dynamically on display.\n\nLet's abbrev dynamically \"all the way up to the chrome\".\n\nIf we get the abbrev algorithm wrong and ppl complain, we can add a feature to \"unabbrev\" with say \".\" as the key and then it could allow left|right paging. but let's try without first, I am pretty sure if we do a dumb algo that makes sure the filename is always visible and abbrevs the middle 99% of people will be happy.\n"

This came up internally at Facebook and there were a number of interesting questions:\n\n-- Should search only match file paths or should it match against the whole input?\n-- Would it be case sensitive? Auto-case sensitive? support regexes?\n-- Would we allow specifying a fuzzy regex to filter the input first before displaying it?\n\nAnd then once we started exploring this idea, it became clear that PathPicker would start to try to do \"too many things\" at once, and the more `unixy` way would be to preprocess the input before sending it to PathPicker. So we decided this was a non-goal.\n\nHowever something like `fzf` would be a great tool to use in this case:\nhttps://github.com/junegunn/fzf\n\nClosing out since we won't realistically get to this, but if you have ideas for how to make fpp play better with certain workflows im interested!\n"

Thanks for the PR -- I remember interactive mode coming up when I was figuring out alias expansion but I think I got stuck on a similar issue you had -- yosemite needing `shopt` to turn on alias expansion yet that not being an option in zshrc. also stack overflow seemed to widely discourage use of interactive mode, but I think our use case is a valid exception.\n\nI guess checking for the existence of shopt and then flipping the flag isn't the worst solution, but it does seem a _little_ blunt (compared to sourcing).\n\nLet me pull this down and test locally -- I might actually prefer this though since sometimes sourcing bashrc's can have pretty aggressive side effects (I personally have a script to login automatically to my facebook dev server if a given flag is present, so that always trips me up when using fpp with bash sourcing)\n"

Yeah the main issue here is that the support and formatting for various editors can vary quite widely -- for instance vim only supports setting the line number when its only opening //one// file, whereas emacs and joe are quite different.\n\nOut of curiosity what is your `$EDITOR` set to? That's the variable we look at (if FPP_EDITOR is not set).\n\nThis is a similar issue for the command mode -- we have `$F` as a token to represent all files joined by a space, but if the user wanted line numbers, its not clear what format they would want them in.\n\nJust trying to understand your specific usecase -- id rather make a slightly more magical but frictionless solution for a specific editor than introduce too much complexity\n"

Although usually the intention is to go downwards after selecting a file, the cases where that isnt true ends up being quite thrashy. Imagine you have a really long list and you actually only want to select the last entry in the file -- by moving the index to +1, you'll scroll all the way to the beginning of the list -- not even giving you an option to see if the selection worked. that would feel like a bug.\n\nadditionally say you are selecting files on the way up (rather than downwards) -- then you have to fight against each selection pushing you down.\n\nThis also breaks almost every test we have (since the expected output is different from keystrokes), hence why the build failed.\n\nAnyways, I'm going to close this out since it has some pros but also some cons. Thanks of the interest in the project though @prubel !\n"

        "body": "Another vote for opening the files in buffers rather than. My expectation is that `fpp` will open files the same way vim would normally open them (e.g., `vim file1.txt file2.txt`, i.e., in buffers). \n\nThe multiple buffer editing feature in vim is designed for this exact case, e.g., it gives a warning when the user quits before addressing all the opened files.\n\nThis is a common situation already when composing shell commands with vim (e.g., with `grep` and `xargs`). I don't see any reason `fpp` needs special treatment here.\n\nI also don't see the need for a user preference, if a user wants `fpp` to use tabs instead of buffers, they can already simply set `FPP_EDITOR=vim -O`. **EDIT: Actually I take this back, setting the `FPP_EDITOR` this way would break other vim specific features such as opening at the line number of a match. So a configuration parameter would be appropriate to ensure that these features work well together.**\n\nAll imo of course, ps for those looking to disable the split behavior setting to be vim followed by a space does the trick: `FPP_EDITOR=\"vim \"`. **EDIT: But this also breaks other vim specific features such as opening at the line number of a match.**\n"

I'm almost certain this was only an issue only with our older releases; we have since switched to falling back to relative paths rather than `~/www`. That functionality was vestigial / only applicable at Facebook where our sandbox is checked out at ~/www.\n\nI'm not super familiar with SVN though -- do SVN commands give filepaths as relative from the root of the repo? If so we might need to add SVN repo logic -- you can see here:\n\nhttps://github.com/facebook/PathPicker/blob/master/src/parse.py#L126\n\nWe try to get either the `hg root` or the git root, but we dont have any logic for svn. Do you feel brave enough to add it? :D\n"

        "body": "Hey @hajimezhao ! We dont have support for directories yet, mainly because directories are such a disjunct set from filepaths for most unix commands. We'd have to provide a command API that would somehow provide different tokens (or different commands) for filenames versus directories and all of that.\n\nIts not impossible to support, just requires a lot of work and careful consideration :P\n\nFor clipboard, yes you can! There are two things you might be interested in:\n- The first is the `pbcopy` command which copies to clipboard, so you can \"paste\". I think this command only comes on macs but is quite useful. you can pipe into copy like `echo \"asd\" | pbcopy`\n- The second is that we have a bit of hacky support for moving into the directory of a listed file. If you \"cd\" a file in FPP, we will actually copy it to a file in `~/.dircopy` (since we execute in subshells and you cannot change the outer shells directory instantly).\n\nThen I have an alias to easily navigate to that directory:\n\n```\n[pcottle:~/Dropbox (Facebook)/wip/PathPicker/src:master]$ type -a cdp\ncdp is aliased to `cd \"$(cat ~/.dircopy)\"'\n```\n\nso my workflow is essentially `cd $F` >> program exits >> `cdp`\n"

Seems like vim's execution mode gets tripped up by running an interactive script.\n\nSeems like theres a similar issue over here too:\nhttps://github.com/zaiste/vimified/issues/89\n"

Proof:\n\n```\n/w/repos/PathPicker] wk% cat ~/.fpp/.fpp.sh\n\n\nif type shopt > /dev/null; then\n  shopt -s expand_aliases\nfi\n\necho \"executing command:\"\necho \"vim './README.md'\"\nvim './README.md'\n```\n\nSo nothing special. But it's a Bash syntax. In line 36 I've put an `echo`:\n\n```\n/w/repos/PathPicker] wk% sed -n 36p fpp\n  echo $SHELL -i ~/.fpp/.fpp.sh < /dev/tty\n```\n\nThen I run it in my terminal and of course it showed `bin/csh`. So I reproduced lack of result by doing:\n\n```\n[wkoszek-macbook:/w/repos/PathPicker] wk% /bin/csh -i ~/.fpp/.fpp.sh < /dev/tty\n[wkoszek-macbook:/w/repos/PathPicker] wk%\n```\n\nBut:\n\n```\n[wkoszek-macbook:/w/repos/PathPicker] wk% /bin/bash -i ~/.fpp/.fpp.sh < /dev/tty\nexecuting command:\nvim './README.md'\n```\n\nIn `CSH` when I force `$SHELL` to point to `/bin/bash`, it works. We need to either put this, or make `fpp` detect the shell type accordingly.\n"

Basically I'm assuming fpp working in bash is better than no fpp at all.\n\ndo you think most csh users have either bash or zsh installed?\n\nI'd be down to throw up a PR for this in a bit, but I'd probably ask for you to test it (since I don't have csh or zsh installed :O I'm such a bad engineer clearly)\n"

        "body": "@pcottle so the problem is that fish users already fall into that if statement (which is why this was a problem to begin with)\n\nSince fpp is a bash script (`#!/bin/bash` at the top), it gets run in bash even when called from fish.  That causes $BASH to be defined, but $SHELL to still be fish.  If $FISH had been hitting the second if statement and we were running the script with bash, everything would have been fine before as long as I didn't try to use any fishy commands.  \n\nAs is, with this fix, everything should work fine and I can use fish scripting commands if I want.\n\nI don't believe the second half of that if statement is ever going to be hit though, unless csh/ksh/whatever act differently when running a bash script.  If you want what I think was the intended behavior, you'll have to check whether $SHELL ends with bash, fish, or zsh.  Personally I think you're probably just better off axing the if statement though.\n"

I'll take a deeper look tomorrow with some nits, but this can likely go in with minimal change.\n\nI agree that combining with a preconfigured command mode is nice. maybe provide a few example commands for git to isolate the bookmarks? for example, mercurial outputs something like:\n\n```\n[pcottle:~/www:(explainNoMethods)]$ hg book\n   betterStats.preamend      1095557:c0e02bfc109b\n   debugSF                   1098767:f13654075612\n   emailRoundups             1095558:6cd95011bcf3\n * explainNoMethods          1102007:d620f805c859\n```\n\nso if we matched on all text, you couldn't pipe it straight into `hg update`. `git branch` is a bit better but technically the currently checked out branch will have the `*` :P\n\nalso might have been nice to splice the `file` => `path` codemod into another PR, but nbd. im pretty lazy when interchanging the two, even though they arent technically equivalent\n"

The pre-filter filters all lines from the input which contain a file path (i.e. grep output). This filtered output is piped into fzf. With fzf you select the lines with the files you want to process in some way. After pressing Enter this selected lines go into the post-filter. This one filters now the concrete file paths and send it to the $EDITOR or other command. In principle it is the same as fpp already does, but with fzf as the selection tool. Maybe it would be a better idea to have an option that enables to select fzf as internal selection tool.\nI could do this filters with sed and/or awk or whatever, but fpp does already a good job at this, so why reinventing the wheel :)\n"

I can open a new one if you like.\n\nI came here from #206 because I just hit that issue, and it caused me to lose work in my editor. That's pretty nasty default behavior, having not noticed that this `--non-interactive` flag exists until now (it's only helpful after you know you need it \ud83d\ude22 ).\n\n> Interactive mode is not really meant to execute shell scripts the way we're using it in fpp, but since it's already in and I don't want to really break some users' workflows\n\nI agree, and I'd argue that this bad experience and possibility of losing work warrants considering changing the default, maybe when a major version bump comes along if that's the project's policy? It's still `0.x` so if you're following Semantic Versioning then all bets are still off\u2026 I'd be curious to hear use cases where people actually depend on the _interactive_ shell behavior, beyond aliases, etc. which I think can be solved.\n\nThis is from the bash man page (emphasis mine):\n\n> When  bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, **or as a non-inter-\n> active shell with the --login option**, it first reads and executes  com-\n> mands  from  the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.  After reading\n> that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile,\n> in  that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that\n> exists and is readable.\n\nIf loading aliases and such is desired, I believe that's the \"right\" way to do it: a login shell, but not interactive.\n\nI can try to work up a change to propose and see how it works, but before digging in I wanted to ask, @pcottle said this on #206:\n\n> this is unfortunately due to the fact that we launch the editor inside a subshell and attach it to tty directly\n\nIs there a reason or some background you can point me to on why fpp doesn't just `exec` the process?\n\nThanks for the tool, it's useful!\n"

Do you mind making the changes to `clearSegment`, testing with an extra long line width to see what off-screen-printing produces, and then trying to address the other comments if they arent too hard? I think this is a case where id be fine \"shelling-out\" to get some of the outputs of these commands, like the size of the file in human-readable terms (as long as its a bash builtin).\n\nanyways excited to merge this after an update :)\n"

I can do some manual testing locally, and it seems like the codepath doesnt really change if you dont have this config file.\r\n\r\nrelated to that -- can we only change the display of the hotkey bindings if you have a config file in place? that will prevent you from having to modify a bunch of test files"

Compared to the last commit, the (relevant) changes are:\r\n\r\n- custom bindings are not shown anymore;\r\n- added python 3 support;\r\n- added test suite for the bindings configuration file decode.\r\n\r\nThe last doubt I have is whether the binding detection fragment (`for boundKey, command in self.keyBindings.bindings:`) should stay at the top or the bottom of `processInput()`.\r\nIf we assume this usage is advanced, I think it should stay at the top, since it gives the option to override standard fpp keys."

        "body": "@pcottle The straightforward answer to your question is... because the spec says so. :)\r\n\r\nQuoting verbatim from [the spec](https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)\r\n\r\n> $XDG_CACHE_HOME defines the base directory relative to which user specific non-essential data files should be stored. If $XDG_CACHE_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.cache should be used.\r\n\r\nBased on the spec, and as pointed out in issue #269 , the correct default then, would be `$HOME/.cache/fpp`.\r\n\r\nMy understanding of the flow is that the `$FPP_DIR` is simply used to store the temporary pickle file generated by the python module and the lifecycle of the file is no more than the duration of running your command piped via `fpp` and making your selection. If I have this right, after the selection is made, the file is no longer useful and can be discarded.\r\n\r\nI found no mention of settings in the README and didn't find any mention of permanent configs when looking through the code either. Do you have an example of something that'd be lost?"

Add a warning on the first invocation of the new version somehow. This might not be trivial to do \"correctly\" however.\r\n2. Silently migrate data from `~/.fpp` to the new location, somehow providing a seamless transition. Prior experience with automatic migrations tells me it's very likely we miss some kind of edge case though.\r\n3. Decide that this use case is rare enough that we can safely ignore it, possibly with a mention in the release notes. If we want to be \"correct\" semver-wise, we release a new major version, although admittedly, that feels like overkill."

If you add a new directory with files untracked files, git always shows it like `test123/` (at least with default `git status` settings.

My editor is an already running emacs daemon, so it should be super fast to open a file.\r\n\r\nI'm also running zsh as my shell.\r\n\r\nIt took me a while to figure out, but the root cause is that fpp is starting up a new instance of zsh with the -i flag, and that my .zshconfig is really big and takes a while to load.\r\n\r\nIf I edit the fpp script and comment out these lines, then the pause goes away (and everything still works just fine):\r\n\r\nif [ -z \"$VIMRUNTIME\" -a \"$NONINTERACTIVE\" = false ]; then\r\n\r\n  IFLAG=\"-i\"\r\n\r\nfi\r\n\r\nSo this is mostly my fault -- I have too much config in my .zshrc and it takes a long time to load -- but everything works for me without the -i flag being passed to zsh. I'm assuming that there are use cases where the -i flag is necessary, but this might be causing tons of people to think that fpp is slow to open.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to set an env variable or something so that the -i flag is never passed to zsh, or to not use the -i flag by default?\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/facebook/PathPicker/issues/301>, or mute the thread<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAIVDHZQK34MEX6GKTVTLZTPU4MCRANCNFSM4HMI2KMQ>.\r\n"
