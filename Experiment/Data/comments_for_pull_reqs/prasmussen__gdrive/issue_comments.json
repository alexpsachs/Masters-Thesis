Your current implementation of **UploadStdin** takes a **io.ReadCloser**, but the ResumableMedia API requires the interface **io.ReaderAt**. I've tried changing it to **input *os.File** and it compiles atleast, but ofcourse the execution will not work properly:\n\n`read /dev/stdin: illegal seek`\n\nAs far as I can tell, your google-api-go-client repository does not do the actual fileuploads, it only passes those arguments to another library from Google, which indeed tries to seek. And pipes are non-seekable, so that call can only fail.\n\nOne possibility would be to wrap something around os.Stdin which just discards input when seeking forward and throws an error when trying to seek backwards, as that's ofcourse not possible. Sounds like a really ugly hack though, any other ideas?\n"

        "body": "Disclaimer : I am not really a pro at golang , but this is how i have been creating binary for gdrive (in case i need/want to make some changes ) , and ones created , i just copy them (binary) from one system to another , unless the binary is broken or something else is wrong and i cant figure it out .\n\nNote : This is on a centos installation , but i believe it should work on most linux systems with some changes\n\nA good part of this method has been taken from the original documentation ..\n\nOfficial page - https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive\n\nStep 1 - Install the Go tools - http://golang.org/doc/install\n\nIf you are upgrading from an older version of Go you must first remove the existing version.\nLinux, Mac OS X, and FreeBSD tarballs\n\nDownload the archive and extract it into /usr/local, creating a Go tree in /usr/local/go. For example:\n\ntar -C /usr/local -xzf go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz\n\nChoose the archive file appropriate for your installation. For instance, if you are installing Go version 1.2.1 for 64-bit x86 on Linux, the archive you want is called go1.2.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz.\n\n(Typically these commands must be run as root or through sudo.)\n\nAdd /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding this line (at the end of /etc/profile) to your /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation) or $HOME/.profile:\n\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\nStep 2 - Install mercurial with the command - yum install mercurial\n\nStep 3 - If the src folder of drive (IE drive/src) does not contain your version of gdrive , get it their with the follow commands -\n\nSet the environment variables like so\n- 'export GOROOT= /usr/local/go'\n- 'export GOPATH=/path/to/gdrive/folder'\n\n'cd /PATH/TO/GDRIVE/DIRECTORY'\n\n'go get github.com/prasmussen/gdrive'\n\nStep 4 - Ones you have edited the gdrive (optional) and want to complie the program  ,\n\ngo to the gdrive directory and run 'go build drive.go'\n\nget the 'drive' binary generated and place it in '/usr/local/bin' , make the binary executable with 'chmod +x drive'\n"

If Google is compromised, access to my Google Drive is the least of my worries!  :-)\n\nBut honestly, with a site license for it - anything that I can do to use it (for Windows related things), I do.  Just makes interfacing to things a bit easier.  It is also a REALLY compact OS (compared to fully patched XP or beyond).  So, it makes running as a VM highly desirable.  I'd rather run NT, but nothing runs on it any longer!\n\nSince I did not get any information or posts or anything, I've since installed a VM of DSL.  It has a similar footprint to Win2k (256MB ram, <2GB hard drive).  It SEEMS that if I can get the Linux version of GDrive to stop crashing (I'm sure it is me - so I've not posted), this will work as a machine I can use to run automated backups.  Basically, I setup a SMB share of files I want copied - then I use that to distribute the appropriate files to the appropriate Google Drive for long term retention.  Seems to be working so far!\n"

I'd always encourage people to try Linux/BSD to replace their Windows usage because they are free and (in my experience) better at doing the job. If you're really limited on RAM/hard drive space you might want to consider not using virtual machines as these carry overhead. FreeBSD jails or Docker are good alternatives which offer isolation but minimise overhead. FreeBSD has the advantage that ZFS is baked in, so you've got your storage covered, but it's easy enough to install on Debian/Linux. \n\nThere's also the raspberry pi option! :neckbeard: \n\nA good community for virtualization is www.reddit.com/r/homelab\n"

As for buying, it was not that either, just a matter of resources.  If I could get away with it, I'd use DOS or if I had the time/patience I'd use SLACKWARE...they use next to NOTHING for resources!\n\nI use ESXi, so resource sharing is not really an issue.  I typically see DSL only using 29MB or ram, so ESXi will reclaim the rest of the 256MB for other machines to use.  I'm not worried!\n\nI already have a RPI. It controls the Zwave stuff in my house - which reports to a Win7 VM that runs my home automation (www.homeseer.com)! \n\nAnyway, thanks for the link, I'll check that out.\n"

It doesn't uniquely identify files by name.\n\nUser @occho made a [fork](https://github.com/occho/gdrive/commit/00ac83a7cee36c3e410633598277b35b0b09a24b) to add an update file feature, which is what I believe you and others have been looking for. I tested it briefly and it works, although I had to change some of the imports to build the binary correctly. Example:\n\n```\ndrive.exe upload -u 0BytCbNhl3nyPelYtNGNzdlEtbkU -f time.txt\n```\n"

And since December / 2016 I got the message below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nStarting sync...\r\nCollecting local and remote file information...\r\nCould not find parent of 0ByqE7lC_kho3SXFmTHF6TkxDajA (backup_31.sync.gz)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe strangest thing is that the files reported are files that have been uploaded for more than six months and since then are not accessed, below file info command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/root/gdrive info 0ByqE7lC_kho3SXFmTHF6TkxDajA\r\nId: 0ByqE7lC_kho3SXFmTHF6TkxDajA\r\nName: backup_31.sync.gz\r\nPath: backupdb/xxxxxxxx/2016/05/yyyy/backup_31.sync.gz\r\nMime: application/x-gzip\r\nSize: 1.5 MB\r\nCreated: 2016-05-31 04:20:43\r\nModified: 2016-05-31 04:20:43\r\nMd5sum: f48bd46c541f362598898586240c81ea\r\nShared: False\r\nParents: 0ByqE7lC_kho3a1RQaFFnZzNhYTA\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn cases of file collision I am deleting the files with problem and I repeat the process of synchronization, but in this case I can not do because I do not have the original file that was sent.\r\n\r\nCurrently spool the process daily using sync upload only:\r\n\r\n`/root/gdrive sync upload --no-progress --keep-local /home/backupdb/ 0ByqE7lC_kho3ZHVCb3hCMXNRQXM`\r\n\r\nI use Sync to ensure that no backup is forgotten.\r\n\r\nLooking at the source code, I have an extensive list of files and I realized that the logic fetches the parent folder from the file, can not this loop be caused by this problem? Any memory limitation for example?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n"

It is just the sync code that is having trouble.\r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed... `gdrive info` returns a ViewUrl of form: `https://drive.google.com/a/[ga-domain]` for the file in question, however for the parent it returns a ViewUrl of form `https://drive.google.com/drive/` (ie without the GoogleApps domain).  Not sure if it is relevant or just a difference between view urls for folders and files on google drive.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# ls -1 scanner_upload\r\nauslage\r\nother-documents\r\npaid-invoices\r\nunpaid-invoices\r\n\r\n# ls -1 scanner_upload/paid-invoices/\r\n2017-02-02 - Hotel Alte Post - Rechnung.pdf\r\n2017-02-18 - Bahn - Bahncard Losch.pdf\r\n2017-02-24 - BMW - R\u00fcckstand.pdf\r\n\r\n# gdrive  --refresh-token \"[token]\" info \"0B1HLIFeM7hsRY05xMGdIR3cyNm8\"\r\nId: 0B1HLIFeM7hsRY05xMGdIR3cyNm8\r\nName: scanner_incoming\r\nPath: scanner_incoming\r\nMime: application/vnd.google-apps.folder\r\nCreated: 2017-02-20 18:47:14\r\nModified: 2017-03-01 09:45:18\r\nShared: True\r\nParents: 0AFHLIFeM7hsRUk9PVA\r\nViewUrl: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1HLIFeM7hsRY05xMGdIR3cyNm8\r\n\r\n# gdrive --refresh-token \"[token]\" sync upload \"scanner_upload\" \"0B1HLIFeM7hsRY05xMGdIR3cyNm8\"\r\nStarting sync...\r\nCollecting local and remote file information...\r\nCould not find parent of 0B1HLIFeM7hsRMzNiWG5fY3RETGc (2017-02-24 - BMW - R\u00fcckstand.pdf)\r\n\r\n# gdrive  --refresh-token \"[token]\" info \"0B1HLIFeM7hsRMzNiWG5fY3RETGc\"\r\nId: 0B1HLIFeM7hsRMzNiWG5fY3RETGc\r\nName: 2017-02-24 - BMW - R\u00fcckstand.pdf\r\nPath: Rechnungsverwaltung 2017/RG Eingang/02 Februar 2017/2017-02-24 - BMW - R\u00fcckstand.pdf\r\nMime: application/pdf\r\nSize: 865.1 KB\r\nCreated: 2017-03-01 09:11:23\r\nModified: 2017-03-01 09:11:23\r\nMd5sum: 6bdc2625b56958278692026623c0543f\r\nShared: True\r\nParents: 0BylfOx0NAyx4UHdJVFJLUi1ZLU0\r\nViewUrl: https://drive.google.com/a/[ga-domain]/file/d/0B1HLIFeM7hsRMzNiWG5fY3RETGc/view?usp=drivesdk\r\nDownloadUrl: https://drive.google.com/a/[ga-domain]/uc?id=0B1HLIFeM7hsRMzNiWG5fY3RETGc&export=download\r\n\r\n# gdrive  --refresh-token \"[token]\" info \"0BylfOx0NAyx4UHdJVFJLUi1ZLU0\"\r\nId: 0BylfOx0NAyx4UHdJVFJLUi1ZLU0\r\nName: 02 Februar 2017\r\nPath: Rechnungsverwaltung 2017/RG Eingang/02 Februar 2017\r\nMime: application/vnd.google-apps.folder\r\nCreated: 2017-01-04 16:02:58\r\nModified: 2017-01-04 16:02:58\r\nShared: True\r\nParents: 0BylfOx0NAyx4b0xDSzhGSWlMdm8\r\nViewUrl: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BylfOx0NAyx4UHdJVFJLUi1ZLU0\r\n```\r\n"

        "body": "I've run into a similar problem when manually creating a directory on google drive and moving an already synced folder into the newly created one.\r\n\r\nIt resulted in a hierarchy similar to this:\r\n- syncRoot\r\n- - folder1 [syncRootId: 'of syncRoot']\r\n- - - folder2 [syncRootId: 'missing']\r\n- - - - folder3 [syncRootId: 'of syncRoot']\r\n\r\nWhich lead gdrive to report that it could not find the parent of folder3, since it was not obtained using the query mentioned by @NorbiPeti .\r\n\r\nI created a little function that builds a list of all files in a given syncRoot and adds the syncRootId to all of them. Similarly it will set the syncRootId to \"\" on all other files that have it set but are not in the syncRoot.\r\n\r\nSee [this branch comparison](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive/compare/master...fabzo:feature/hacky-fix-sync-root). I just hacked it together as a quick fix for myself. But maybe this could be helpful/interesting with a little bit of cleanup and testing.\r\n\r\nOr maybe there is another way for gdrive to keep track of the syncDir files/folders? I have not yet worked with the google drive API apart from this little hack. But it seems that the syncRootId is used for efficiency reasons and is not strictly required?\r\n\r\nThe problem mentioned by @carmenates09 seems to have another cause and is not related to the misplaced syncRootId. As far as I understand...\r\n\r\nUpdate: Well I would say further testing is indeed needed. As it seems that i missed something which resulted in some files no longer being in the sync root ;-)"

        "body": "The for loop does work for this particular scenario, however the other problem I am running into is the uploading of duplicate files.  \r\n\r\nFor instance, I need one file with a static name, e.g. \"staticFile.csv\", and it's backups for the last 7 days uploaded into a directory.  Since my script runs every 15 minutes, \"staticFile.csv\" and it's backups get duplicated on the upload.  I haven't found a way to tell gdrive to ignore duplicates, so for the time being I'm using another cmd-line app located here [https://github.com/odeke-em/drive](url)\r\n\r\nIt's a bit more difficult to setup and requires Go dependencies to be installed, but it's much more robust and offers a broader range of functionality.  Regardless, it took me forever to setup on Ubuntu 14.04 and actually get it working properly.  \r\n\r\nGdrive would be a much better alternative for the current project I am working on if there was a workaround for the issue with duplicate files getting uploaded into drive.\r\n"

They are hardcoded near the top of the file, and just swapping them for the correct values corresponding to the refresh token fixed the issue. This was being done on a machine which had manually installed gdrive from github; usually we do this via an automated build process that sets the correct ClientId and ClientSecret at build time. So, PEBKAC issue, basically.\r\n\r\nIt does lead to a small possible feature: since --refresh-token only works when the ClientId and ClientSecret match, make ClientId and ClientSecret command line options too so accounts other than the default can be used.

However google script is also google drive file!!. \r\n2- So,You can download your project script by` gdrive` by \r\n> gdrive export ID\r\n\r\n3- The whole project will be downloaded as single `json file`\r\n4- The `json file `has key `files` which has a value of list, containing all files in it, each file is represented by an array has the keys:` Id`, `type`, `name`, `source`.\r\n5- The `source `values is the script you want to edit.\r\n6- No official way to extract the `source` to a single file.\r\n7- If you write your own script to extract script source , you will encounter the last issue\r\n8- you can't upload your edits, As `gdrive` has no authorization to upload google script projects !!\r\n[THIS ISSUE](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive/issues/231)"

There's nothing to even hint that what's described might not be in the build.\r\n\r\nAlso the `No valid arguments given, use 'gdrive help' to see available commands` error message is misleading because it occurs when at least some valid arguments are present. No indication of the `--service-account` flag being unknown."

On a CIFS file system it seems to miss some of the file.\n \u00a0\u00a0 I debugged as best I could and found that the GO call\u00a0 that asks for \na file list is the culprit. I could not debug deeper than that.\n \u00a0\u00a0 Currently I copy the CIFS tree to /tmp and then use gdrive and it works.\n\n2. It appears error or warning or retry conditions are not being \nprocessed properly.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When I tried to do many file transactions it would not work properly.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It failed at different places in the set of files.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It seemed to have a problem with long paths at one time.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I tried a number of things to no avail.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I assume the GOOGLE API has changed or not implemented properly\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I instead wrote a script to get a file listing and process each \nfile one at a time.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I added all kinds of checks for problems and was able to get that \nto work.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I am attaching a perl file with the way I made things work for \nlarge numbers of files.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The download routines is where to look.\n\nHere is what I am using\ngdrive version\ngdrive: 2.1.0\nGolang: go1.6\nOS/Arch: linux/amd64\n\n\n\n\nOn 04/25/18 11:31, Qwerty-Space wrote:\n>\n> Oh\n>\n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you commented.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub \n> <https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive/issues/353#issuecomment-384389160>, \n> or mute the thread \n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/Ag9Jol_JJtoak7G1rExTyCAYa9wkLfX3ks5tsMEOgaJpZM4Pl9R4>.\n>\n\n"

If they are not these lengths, this method will not work and you will have to recompile from source.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**STEP 1**\r\nGenerate API credentials for Google Drive ([see TA40's OP here](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive/issues/426#issue-404775200) - follow steps 3-14)\r\n\r\n**STEP 2**\r\nGet the `client_id` and `client_secret` from your client_id.json file. The client_id **MUST** be 72 chars long and the client_secret **MUST** be 24 chars long. If they are not these lengths, following this method will probably break gdrive, and you will have to recompile gdrive from source instead.\r\n\r\nUse your favourite method - I used `wc` to get the length\r\n```\r\necho -n **CLIENT_ID** | wc -c\r\necho -n **CLIENT_SECRET** | wc -c\r\n```\r\n\r\n**STEP 3**\r\nBackup your gdrive binary\r\n`cp gdrive gdrive.old`\r\n\r\n**STEP 4**\r\nEdit binary in-place with `sed` (Replace `**CLIENT_ID**` and `**CLIENT_SECRET**` with your newly generated details from client_id.json).\r\n\r\n```\r\nsed -i -e 's/367116221053-7n0vf5akeru7on6o2fjinrecpdoe99eg.apps.googleusercontent.com/**CLIENT_ID**/g' gdrive\r\nsed -i -e 's/1qsNodXNaWq1mQuBjUjmvhoO/**CLIENT_SECRET**/g' gdrive\r\n```\r\n\r\n**STEP 4a**\r\nDelete the old .gdrive/token_v2.json (Thanks [leekung](https://github.com/gdrive-org/gdrive/issues/426#issuecomment-475248887))\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd ~ && rm .gdrive/token_v2.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n**STEP 5**\r\nRun `gdrive list` to confirm that it has worked. It will ask you to go through the OAuth login process again to generate a new token, but after you should have a list of files in your Google Drive.\r\n\r\n**END HOWTO**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n> Also I think Client ID/Secret should be read from client_id.json directly instead of hard-coding and simply replacing that file would solve it. I might create a pull request but not sure if the repo is still maintained.\r\n\r\nThis would be the best way forward. There is a note in the README about the state of maintenance though:\r\n\r\n> This tool is not being actively maintained at the moment, ymmv.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Edit 2019-03-25**: There are reports that these steps do not work on FreeBSD (see [this](https://github.com/gdrive-org/gdrive/issues/426#issuecomment-469777401) comment). I only tested this on Linux. If its not working for you - follow other peoples instructions and rebuild from source."

Until a fix is introduced in a future version, you can use 2 alternative ways to bypass it.\r\n\r\n1. You can remove the directory along with it's contents and recreate directory with same name in a single function. (Note: this will change the folder ID, if you're statically storing them for later use you need to update it)\r\n2. You can call multiple delete queries using `xargs` or similar e.g.\r\n\r\n       $ gdrive list -q \"'FOLDER_ID' in parents\" --no-header --max 0 | cut -d\" \" -f1 - | xargs -L 1 gdrive delete -r\r\n\r\nWhat this does is basically listing all files within the folder, getting file IDs from it using cut and executing `gdrive delete -r <FILE_ID>` for each of them"

        "body": "@ChrisMann89  Drive API expects date formats given in queries to be in ISO 8601 format, for that you need to use `-I, --iso-8601` option of date. So the command you want would be:\r\n\r\n    $ gdrive list -q \"('FOLDER_ID' in parents) and modifiedTime < '$(date -d yesterday -Iseconds)'\" --no-header --max 0 | cut -d\" \" -f1 - | xargs -L 1 gdrive delete -r\r\n(Notice the single quotes and sub-shell call in the query)\r\n\r\n**Before I finish, I want to point out 2 things in this kind of query.**\r\n\r\n1. By doing this you send separate commands to API for every file in the folder, which means if you have many files within the folder this will flood the API and will take a lot of time. So keep that in mind. (And hopefully you won't need to do this at all, once batch query support is introduced)\r\n2. Sometimes queries might get lost, because of unstable network connection or problems in the API etc.  Which might cause some files to be not deleted or not getting the file IDs at all. So I would suggest a \"safe\" method that will persistently send the query if it fails. For example, if we define following bash functions:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Echo error message to stderr\r\nerrcho () {\r\n    >&2 echo $@\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Send list request to drive with retry mechanism against failures (same parameters as original)\r\nsafe_list () {\r\n    local RESPONSE\r\n    while true; do\r\n        RESPONSE=$(eval gdrive list $@)\r\n        echo \"${RESPONSE}\" | grep Failed &> /dev/null && errcho \"Failed to get information from cloud. Trying again in 5 seconds\" \\\r\n            && sleep 5 || break\r\n    done\r\n    echo \"$RESPONSE\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Send delete request to drive with retry mechanism against failures (same parameters as original)\r\nsafe_delete () {\r\n    local RESPONSE\r\n    while true; do\r\n        RESPONSE=$(eval gdrive delete $@)\r\n        echo \"${RESPONSE}\" | grep Failed &> /dev/null && errcho \"Failed delete from cloud. Trying again in 5 seconds\" \\\r\n            && sleep 5 || break\r\n    done\r\n    echo \"$RESPONSE\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYour query would become\r\n\r\n    $ safe_list -q \"\\\"('FOLDER_ID' in parents) and modifiedTime < '$(date -d yesterday -Iseconds)'\\\"\" --no-header --max 0 | cut -d\" \" -f1 - | xargs -L 1 safe_delete -r\r\n(Notice the extra quotes with backslash)\r\n\r\nNow in this form, using the above functions, if your query gets a \"Failed\" message from gdrive it will try again in 5 seconds. (And if you check your logs you'll realize you're getting failed messages often)"

So you need to recreate an API key from Google developer console and recompile the binaries to have your own individual quota. For detailed tutorial refer to #426 \r\n\r\nThis behavior most likely will change in a future release and you won't need to recompile but just add the API keys"

If they are not these lengths, this method will not work and you will have to recompile from source.\r\n> \r\n> **STEP 1**\r\n> Generate API credentials for Google Drive ([see TA40's OP here](https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive/issues/426#issue-404775200) - follow steps 3-14)\r\n> \r\n> **STEP 2**\r\n> Get the `client_id` and `client_secret` from your client_id.json file. The client_id **MUST** be 72 chars long and the client_secret **MUST** be 24 chars long. If they are not these lengths, following this method will probably break gdrive, and you will have to recompile gdrive from source instead.\r\n> \r\n> Use your favourite method - I used `wc` to get the length\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> echo -n **CLIENT_ID** | wc -c\r\n> echo -n **CLIENT_SECRET** | wc -c\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> **STEP 3**\r\n> Backup your gdrive binary\r\n> `cp gdrive gdrive.old`\r\n> \r\n> **STEP 4**\r\n> Edit binary in-place with `sed` (Replace `**CLIENT_ID**` and `**CLIENT_SECRET**` with your newly generated details from client_id.json).\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> sed -i -e 's/367116221053-7n0vf5akeru7on6o2fjinrecpdoe99eg.apps.googleusercontent.com/**CLIENT_ID**/g' gdrive\r\n> sed -i -e 's/1qsNodXNaWq1mQuBjUjmvhoO/**CLIENT_SECRET**/g' gdrive\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> **STEP 5**\r\n> Run `gdrive list` to confirm that it has worked.

Install git for windows https://git-scm.com/download/win\r\n2. Install Go for windows https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.12.1.windows-amd64.msi\r\n3.  set go environment in advanced system setting\r\n    - GOPATH = C:\\Projects\\Go\r\n    - GOROOT = C:\\go\r\n4. Open git bash then type this command\r\n    $ cd /c/Projects/Go\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/gdrive-org/gdrive.git\r\n    $ go get github.com/prasmussen/gdrive\r\n5. Edit handlers_drive.go in folder \"C:/Projects/Go/gdrive/\" (follow instruction above) then you also copy this file to  \"C:\\Projects\\Go\\src\\github.com\\prasmussen\\gdrive\"\r\n6. On git bash terminal run this command\r\n   $ env GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags '-w -s'\r\nAfter you run this command you will see gdrive.exe on C:\\Projects\\Go\\gdrive directory.\r\n\r\nGood luck\r\nThis link very useful https://medium.freecodecamp.org/setting-up-go-programming-language-on-windows-f02c8c14e2f"

Sorry!\r\n\r\nI have actually read the whote thread, and also some other threads around on the web.\r\n\r\nSomewhere I came to the understanding, that everything (at some point) had been compiled into the version in my link.. (\"One version to rule them all\")\r\n\r\nWell that makes sense then.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Now I also understand why Mohammed2277 have problems: The link from my link can be used directly in the command line program in Linux.. Where the link you are providing to the other version has a \"download button\" which we can't direct link to inside the command line (might be because the downloadbutton changes link, so that other persons can't deeplink directly to it)..\r\n\r\nBut we should just download the file you link to, rename it to \"gdrive\", upload it to the root of our seedbox/LINUX system, and then follow the tutorial we already used, including creating a token to grant access, and then it should work.)\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nWill try it later, when I am back at my personel computer and putty."
