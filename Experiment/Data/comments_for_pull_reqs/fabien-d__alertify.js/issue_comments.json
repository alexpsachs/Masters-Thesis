The request was to add a DOM loaded event, which I'm still not sure is the right approach for this project since most people already have a library to do this (e.g. jQuery)...\n\nI was thinking of 2 options (code examples are just for visual purposes):\n- expose the init method in the API meaning it would have to be initiated before use\n\n``` js\n// initialize after DOM ready\nalertify.init();\n\n// use\nalertify.alert(\"...\");\n```\n- check the first time alertify is used to see if it's already been initialized. That way it doesn't change the current usage but prevents alertify from trying to create DOM elements before it's told to.\n\n``` js\n// maybe in the dialog method\nif (typeof init === \"function\") init();\n\n// and have the init method delete itself after first use\ninit = function () {\n    ...\n    delete this.init;\n}\n```\n\nI'd love to get some input on it.\n"

Although I was able to figure this out fairly quickly, specifically when I saw n.body is null, it was not immediately clear that alertify.js needs to be in the body.  But otherwise implementing it was a breeze.\n\nTo your point above, I like that it's not put into the DOM until I need it.  On the page where I use it, I'm already relying on the client to parse a good deal of code and determine the layout, so for me at least, this is a great feature.  \n"

There's no validation in native dialogs, it simply does its job and lets the code figure out what to do with it... \n\ne.g.\n\n``` js\nvar string = alertify.prompt(\"name?\");\n// string equals the input value... \n// continue code\n\nif (alertify.confirm(\"sure?\")) {\n// true\n} else {\n// false\n}\n```\n\nThis would make it resemble the native dialogs but would take away the benefits of callbacks and chaining.\n"

Keeping the existing behaviour by default, so it doesn't break anything.\n\nThen the developer can easily:\n- Not worry about it, and use the default;\n- Choose the order that they feel is appropriate for their project (they might be developing a site used mostly by Windows users and feel primary/secondary is the right choice);\n- Write code that inspects the browser's user agent and selects the appropriate order;\n- Allow the user to choose the order and save it as a preference.\n\nI don't know if putting the user agent code into Alertify itself is a good idea (sniffing the user agent is opening a can of worms), but I don't see any downsides in a simple \"reverse button order\" boolean (or however you'd go about it).\n"

Agent detection instead of feature detection (I'd rather test against position fixed versus trying to determine all agent that don't support it)\n2. It's adding quite a bit of bloat calculating the position and adding inline styles\n\nI'm leaning towards checking what the modernizr test for position fixed is and see if that's a small enough test to add to the library. Then if the current device doesn't support position fixed, fallback to the default browser dialogs.\n\nmy 2 cents\n"

Currently a `setTimeout` with a `50ms` delay is used which resolves issues with certain browsers that weren't setting focus at all. Setting a higher delay, e.g. `1000ms` resolved the jump but is really ugly. Looking for a cleaner more reliable approach. (Thinking of using the `transitionend` instead of `setTimeout` to set focus)\n\n#### Dialogs not Showing\n\nThere is a parameter of `visibility: hidden` in the `.alertify-hidden` class in the core `alertify.core.css` file. Removing this resolves the dialogs not showing but causes a failure in IE8-. Looking for a solution that will work cross browser.\n\nThanks for logging the issue - this will help solve major flaws.\n"

Maybe @dparlevliet is on to something. An extension of the confirm prompt which requires an actionable item (e.g. checkbox) before a user can confirm or deny.\n\nStill not sure it's needed, alertify is already rapidly growing in size (want to optimize and shrink it) and want to make sure that all features implemented into the core are valuable to the majority of users and not unique cases.\n\nMaybe starting an extension library would make sense and would also provide options for https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/39 and https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/issues/70. Doesn't ship out with the core but extensions could be added as dependencies for users you want extra features/dialogs. Just a thought...\n"

I'm still new to testing so I've been focusing more on unit testing than functional testing. If you can sort it out, and more functional test can be based off of it that would be fantastic.\n\nI'm assuming since PhantomJS uses WebKit, it most likely detects the `transitionend` property and focus isn't set when you attempt to grab the active element. Since in the test there is no trigger element, you get back the `body` element.\n\nIn the jsfiddle you sent, the focus element is the `trigger` element and not the OK button. I'm assuming it's the same issue, focus isn't set until the transition is done, and therefore the active element remains the trigger button.\n"

The idea to not set the focus inside the dialog means that as a keyboard user (I rarely use the mouse) I have to tab through the entire page. I understand that the idea is to avoid (as much as possible) a user from doing something they didn't want.\n\nBut I won't sacrifice accessibility for it. I like the concept here - setting which button has focus, but still need a solution for null.\n\nAlso as an alternative, have you considered changing the labels on the button to be more descriptive? E.g. \"Disconnect Account\" and \"Cancel\" instead of a simple \"OK\", \"Cancel\" to re-enforce the action they will be taking?\n"

Hence, undefined. I do not believe you can use alertify for the functionality that you are looking for in this instance because the very nature of JavaScript is non-blocking. However, Since you're using jQuery I recommend (actually I recommend other things, but this will do) using a bind which will achieve something close to it.\n\n```\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title></title>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/js/plugins/alertify/themes/alertify.css\">\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/plugins/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/plugins/alertify/lib/alertify.js\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n      var _oldprompt = window.prompt;\n      window.prompt = function() {\n        var _message ;\n        var _position ;\n\n        _message = arguments[0] ;\n        alertify.prompt(_message, function(e, str) {\n          $(document).trigger('prompt_callback', (e) ? str : null);\n        });\n      };\n      prompt(\"What's your favorite color ?\");\n      $(document).one('prompt_callback', function(e, answer) {\n        console.log(answer);\n        prompt(\"Really, you like \"+answer+\"?\");\n        $(document).one('prompt_callback', function(e, answer) {\n          alertify.log('OK!

        "body": "@dparlevliet gave you good advice. I haven't tested the code, but it makes sense. For me, I would have asked why you wanted to do it this way? The only 2 things I can think of:\n1. You don't like writing `alertify.` everytime, or you wish to replace all existing native dialogs without changing any of the code base.\n2. You like that the native dialogs return a value  \n\n``` js\nalert(...)   // returns undefined\nconfirm(...) // returns true/false\nprompt(...)  // returns input value/null\n```\n\nBoth of which are very hard to deal with.\n\n> because the very nature of JavaScript is non-blocking\n\nThis is it. A user can't interact with a piece of UI while the script is executing, so if a user has to interact with UI before the script finishes, and the script has to finish before the user can interact with the UI... the browser would hang.\n\nThis is why alertify is using callbacks. It ensures that the script is only executed after the interaction has been made, but it doesn't block the execution of the rest of the code.\n\nI would consider changing the implementation and adding a `finally` function as a parameter. I'm not sure if it adds too much value, but could be worth exploring.\n\n``` js\nalertify.alert(\"string\", fnYes, fnFinally);\nalertify.confirm(\"string\", fnYes, fnNo, fnFinally);\nalertify.prompt(\"string\", fnYes, fnNo, fnFinally); \n```\n\nAbove is very rough, but the `fnFinally` method would be called after the `fnYes` or `fnNo` to continue with your next code block.\n"

The whole process of setting up an `upstream` doesn't normally get into play when submitting a quick patch, the problem here is that I've made some updates to master since you created your branch.\n\nCurrently your code base is out of date with mine, and some of your changes are conflicting with the updated master branch in my repo, so git doesn't know how to merge. Setting up an `upstream` simply allows you to pull in the latest update from my repo into yours, so that your pull request can be automatically merged.\n\nI appreciate your patience, and if you can set it up into another PR which includes the latest code from my master branch so it can be automatically merged, I'll merge, otherwise I can't... actually can't, I don't get the merge button.\n\nIt can sound like a lot, but it's really not that bad when you get a hang of git. \n"

I added a return false at the bottom of the function to prevent the default event from firing for browsers that don't support `event.preventDefault`. If a piece of code in your callback is causing an error, the return false would never be reached and the default event would be fired.\n\nI will look into the `returnValue` property... so instead of just testing against `event.preventDefault`... do something along the lines of `event.preventDefault ? event.preventDefault() : event.returnValue = false;` to try and prevent the default event from ever firing.\n"

On Monday I'll confirm the version and make something reproducible. \n\nOne thing I noticed reading documentation is that in IE9 events do have a preventDefault method, but only if you have a `strict` doctype. Whether or not they have the preventDefault, they don't always respect a `return false` (see [search results](https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=ie+ignores+return+false)). \n\nI like your code, but note that `event` there is `window.event`, which is not necessarily the argument to the onClick handler. \n"

That way, any styles in the site will be reset to none (e.g. `background`, `border`, `text-decoration`...) and only the styles defined in alertify.js will be shown.\n"

I was thinking dialogs and not log messages.\n\nFor log messages, currently there is no way to only open them once, or only if they are not currently open. The thought behind logs was always a 1:1, every time you take an action the corresponding log is shown.\n\nI feel like multiple log messages is still better than no logs at all. That way a user is aware that he's taken another action. If a user clicks a button and there's a log tied to it, then it should show a new one every time that button is clicked. If you don't want it to show more than once, the button should get disabled.\n\nA form for example, I still believe the best approach is to disable the submit button until the form action is completed.\n\nI personally feel like removing the log notification is a workaround the problem... and not really a solution to the problem.\n"

If you hit the tab key to cycle through the button, whichever one has focus doesn't show. First thing you could try is to remove the `:focus` state in the CSS. See if that works.\n\nI'll will look at it this weekend, just don't have time while at the conference to debug.\n\nCheers,\n"

Alternatively, if Alertify were more modular, new instances could be be composed out of stock and custom components, mixin style (e.g. A renderer, various callbacks, etc.).

[Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)'s `composer.json` is used in a manner similar to [bower](http://bower.io/)'s `bower.json` and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)'s `package.json` to define a package.\n\nIf you aren't using any of these tools there is no benefit for you. However, even so, by including any of these package definitions (`composer.json`, `bower,json`, or `package.json`) this project will get exposure to a wider audience.\n\nOthers can speak to using bower and Node.js, but I use Composer with the following `composer.json` to download dependencies (including [alertify.js](https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js)) for a small event scheduling application:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"repositories\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"package\",\n      \"package\": {\n        \"name\": \"tinymce/tinymce\",\n        \"version\": \"4.0.1\",\n        \"dist\": {\n          \"url\": \"http://download.moxiecode.com/tinymce/tinymce_4.0.1.zip\",\n          \"type\": \"zip\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"package\",\n      \"package\": {\n        \"name\": \"arshaw/fullcalendar\",\n        \"version\": \"1.6.1\",\n        \"dist\": {\n          \"url\": \"http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/downloads/fullcalendar-1.6.1.zip\",\n          \"type\": \"zip\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"package\",\n      \"package\": {\n        \"name\": \"fabien-d/alertify.js\",\n        \"version\": \"0.3.10\",\n        \"dist\": {\n          \"url\": \"https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/archive/0.3.10.zip\",\n          \"type\": \"zip\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"require\": {\n    \"components/jquery\": \"1.9.1\",\n    \"components/jqueryui\": \"1.10.3\",\n    \"tinymce/tinymce\": \"4.0.1\",\n    \"arshaw/fullcalendar\": \"1.6.1\",\n    \"fabien-d/alertify.js\": \"0.3.10\",\n    \"timrwood/moment\": \"dev-master\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs can be seen it isn't necessary for a project to have a `composer.json` for it to be used with Composer.

Perhaps I don't have the code in the right place.  For the second code, I put it in the after:\n\n```\n   else if (!hasCancel || self.buttonReverse) {\n                    btnOK.focus();\n                    //Added Code Here:\n                    if(needfix.hasIn(browser))........\n```\n\nBut it isn't clear where the first code should go.\n\nIf you could incorporate this code into alertify.js or specify more exactly how to implement this fix, that would be great.\n\nGreg\n"

        "body": "not a stupid question - just bad documentation which I will try to update sometime.\n\nThe `extend` method allows to generate custom log messages. The parameter `custom` can be whatever you choose.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` js\n// sets a property on `alertify` object\nalertify.[anyKeyValueYouWant] = alertify.extend( 'anyStringYouWant' );\n\n// so you can then write\nalertify.anyKeyValueYouWant( 'custom log message' );\n```\n\nIn the HTML, this will output:\n\n``` html\n<!-- notice the extra class, this is the value passed in the extend method -->\n<article class=\"alertify-log alertify-log-anyStringYouWant\">custom log message</article>\n```\n\nThen in CSS, you can then control the look of those specific messages:\n\n``` css\n.alertify-log-anyStringYouWant {\n    /* overwrite default styles */\n}\n```\n\nIn short:\n- the string argument passed in the `extend` method will be used as a class name on the log messages\n- the key value you assign to alertify lets you call it directly.\n\nSee https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/wiki/0.3.*-API-Documentation#extend\n\nThis is how the `success` and `error` methods work - https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/wiki/0.3.*-API-Documentation#success--error\n\nHope that's clear\n"

Unfortunately I cannot omit IE because it is used in numerous client companies.\n\nMany thanks in advance for your prompt reply and help.\n\nBenoit\n\nFrom: Fabien Doiron [mailto:notifications@github.com] \nSent: 25 October 2013 16:57\nTo: fabien-d/alertify.js\nCc: BenIsland\nSubject: Re: [alertify.js] IE8,9,10 issue with 0.3.10 version, works fine in FF, Opera misc. versions (#172)\n\nany chance you can provide a demo of this not working?

You would have to add the `warning` to alertify for this to be merged. If you want to add it to `0.3` I'll merge.\n\n## Example\n\nhttps://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/blob/0.3/src/alertify.js#L612\n\n``` js\nwarning : function (message, wait) { _alertify.log(message, \"warning\", wait); return this; }\n```\n"

I'm using Chrome by the way.\n\nI did some more digging, and found that this can be fixed with [CSS](https://github.com/fabien-d/alertify.js/blob/master/example/assets/js/lib/alertify/alertify.core.css#L54). Eliminating he `bottom` declaration resolves the issue and `.alertify-logs` shrink-wraps the contents. \n\nI've made the change in #209.\n\nAny side effects that you can think of?\n"

        "body": "To be frank, I prefer components that are a no brainer when it comes to setting it up. Personally I prefer to do this when I create my components as well for the following reasons.\n1. Helps have complete control within the `css` and `js` that is part of the component.\n2. Everybody wants to customize a component to have look and feel based on their app. Having the HTML to be setup separately gives the end developer to make changes to the HTML, which can sometimes make the component to not work because of the changes. And developers will just create issues on github that it is not working because of the customization that they did. It is very difficult for the owner to just figure out why some developer is facing an issue when it is not an issue at all.\n\nThis is my opinion. But I am open to other developers views as well.\n"

I don't have any webpack experience, but I was hoping that there was a way to get it working as an AMD module. \ud83d\ude15\r\n\r\nAlthough it actually seems to be using the [AMD factory](https://github.com/laterbreh/alertify.js/blob/2cd428a8fe5df37705a3181bf7fc01a91795ff7e/src/alertify.js#L621) even though `define` is `undefined` in my experience. I'm not sure how that's possible."
