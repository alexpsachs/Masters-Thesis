With https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/ we're able to get the data requisite to fetch the given remote (`.head.repo.git_url` and `.base.repo.git_url`), along with the ref to diff against (`.head.ref` and `.base.ref`). From there it's just `git diff (base-ref) (head-ref)` to get the new diff. The tricky bit is getting the repo contributor names from their emails which will require some non-default params to `git blame` \u2014 I recommend `git blame --line-porcelain` if you want to get fancy, or `git diff -e` to show the email. The stumbling block is here \u2014 I don't see any way to get the Github username of an arbitrary email or human name via https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/collaborators/ , so the Github `/blame/` endpoint is the best we have right now. :crying_cat_face: \n"

Obviously it would require git to be installed on web nodes, but I think at least for Heroku dynos, we have git in the slugs for free, right?\n\nThe PR diff is easy enough to still do through the API as shown in my original branch link above.\n\nNot saying I have time to implement within the next week necessarily, but seems like the best shot for running on a private repo without requiring a separate auth mechanism (password/SSH key).\n"

Create the pull request and look at the logs. Create a file on your local machine with the content of the body in a file called `body.webhook`.

So the conf file would be:\n\n```\n  {\n      \"maxReviewers\": 5, // Maximum  number of people to ping in the PR message, default is 3\n      \"numFilesToCheck\": 10, // Number of files to check against, default is 5\n       // Or other nice phrase without pluralization \n     \"message\": \"@pullRequester, thanks! @reviwers, please review this.\",\n     ...\n   }\n```\n\nIn the code, we just replace '@pullRequester' and '@reviwers'. Very simple.\n\nThe second way is implementing the pluralization getting /singular/plural/ words. For example, the message would be:\n\n`\"message\": \"we identified @reviwers to be /a// potential /reviewer/reviwers/.\",`\n\nBased on the reviewers.length, we choose the first or second word. Doable, but complicated perhaps for the users.\n\nAny thoughts?\n"

I think you can start with the configuration in server.js:\n\n``` python\n  // default config\n  var repoConfig = {\n    maxReviewers: 3,\n    numFilesToCheck: 5,\n    userBlacklist: [],\n    userBlacklistForPR: [],\n    userWhitelist: [],\n    fileBlacklist: [],\n    requiredOrgs: [],\n    findPotentialReviewers: true,\n    actions: ['opened'],\n    skipAlreadyAssignedPR: false,\n  };\n\n  try {\n    // request config from repo\n    var configRes = await getRepoConfig({\n      user: data.repository.owner.login,\n      repo: data.repository.name,\n      path: CONFIG_PATH,\n      headers: {\n        Accept: 'application/vnd.github.v3.raw'\n      }\n    });\n\n    repoConfig = {...repoConfig, ...JSON.parse(configRes)};\n```\n\nThen, before bot fires the comment, add one if condition based on the condifuration:\n\n``` python\ngithub.issues.createComment({\n    user: data.repository.owner.login, // 'fbsamples'\n    repo: data.repository.name, // 'bot-testing'\n    number: data.pull_request.number, // 23\n    body: message\n  });\n```\n\nI gues that's it.

As with any bot that sends email notifications, there should be a way to turn it off.\n\nI've been thinking about many ways to achieve this:\n- as you suggested, a git repo where you can send a pull request. The issue with this is that it's a lot of steps to unsubscribe. Ideally i'd like it to be a one click operation.\n- a website where you can unsubscribe. The issue here is that we would need to get you to log in which is not a very good user experience. You want to unsubscribe, logging in to do that seems sketchy.\n- go to github and block the mention-bot user.\n\nI think the last one is actually a really good solution and should be promoted in the official documentation.\n\nLet me know what you think\n"

You want to unsubscribe, logging in to do that seems sketchy.\n\nIf you can simply use your github login, then the only user experience issue would be the initial permission assignment to your account. You can expect most of us would remain logged in to github most of the time anyway. :)\n\n> This is a legitimate concern - under various \"CAN-SPAM\" legislation there has to be a way to unsubscribe. Individually maintaining this via a committed file is a laborious way of doing so (as agreed in this thread).\n\nPerhaps the first time that mention-bot ever mentions a user, it also sends them an email with a single-click opt out link? From then on, they could use the website to adjust their opt-in settings.\n\nI can also think of a valid use case for temporarily setting an opt out; When going overseas and setting an out of office. It's reasonable that you would want to temporarily disable notifications, but also want to restore them after the fact.\n"

The title contains the word \"only\", which suggests that this issue is about avoiding mentioning users outside the repository's organization, however that feature is already implemented and configurable via the `requiredOrgs` configuration parameter.\n\nHowever the question \"Is it possible to have the mention-bot pull the names from this team rather than just from anyone who touched the file?\" sounds like it's not about avoiding mentioning users outside the organization, but instead about ensuring that all users within a team are mentioned.  For example, if user A is in the team but was not included via `alwaysNotifyForPaths` or `fallbackNotifyForPaths` or `findPotentialReviewers`, it sounds like you still want user A to be mentioned anyway - is that right?\n"

On our GHE instance, the message is `'{\"message\":\"Not Found\",\"documentation_url\":\"https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.6/v3\"}'`. One solution could be to change the line to:\n\n``` js\n        /{\"message\":\"Not Found\",\"documentation_url\":\"https:\\/\\/developer.github.com\\/(?:enterprise\\/2\\.\\d+\\/)?v3\"}/.test(e.message) {\n```\n\nShould I create a PR?\n\n# `mention-bot` chokes on a big PR\n\nThe `Error: stdout maxBuffer exceeded` error I get comes [from fetching all the blames](https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/mention-bot.js#L519). It turns out that our project is not only quite big (in terms of number of files and lines of code), but it is also old and has more than 100 contributors. On top of that, the first PR I gave to `mention-bot` was a `+1,944, \u22122,417` with 457 files changed \ud83d\ude04. Trying `mention-bot` with a smaller PR **or** configured with a bigger `maxBuffer` works fine.\n"

        "body": "@aspiers I actually think both you and @vjeux may have misinterpreted what @RandomlyKnighted tried to say. The initial comment is a bit confusing indeed, but after reading it a few times what I understand is that he wants to _restrict_ mentions to just members of the organization (either owners or contributors), since they have an explicit process to onboard frequent contributors from the community into the org. It seems that you guys think he wants to mention _all_ users in the contributors team, but as I see it it's more about using that list as a filter to rule out code authors that aren't on that list. Essentially choosing the potential reviewers using the same method as presently, but picking from a curated pool of trusted reviewers rather than all github users.\n\nI not really fond of that idea though, since I believe encouraging members of the community to become more involved (and eventually taking up more active roles in the project) is a good thing, and doing that as widely and automatically as possible ensures that human error, forgetfulness or mere availability lows (in the process of adding people to the manually curated contributors team) won't miss opportunities for contributions from people who would otherwise get prompted to get involved.\n\nAutomated processes like MentionBot can be the catalyst to keep projects alive and bustling as people naturally flow in and out of the maintainership role. (As a side-note, I think the Wikipedia community made a good choice in this regard, by considering the administrator role a \"barrier removal\" more than a \"role attribution\", since the latter view often leads to calls for more stringent criteria, periodic reconfirmation votes, activity minimums to retain the admin tools, etc.)\n\nIf this is ever implemented, I'd strongly suggest it to be an opt-in feature (i.e. off by default).\n"

I do not think that abandoning the blame is the right approach, but you make an excellent point with \"also tend to give reviewers that have a overall more \"fresher\" point of view on the code being changed\".\n\nIn the fb-internal version of mention-bot we are now applying a coefficient based on time on every line of code. If the line of code has been written more than 8 months ago, we ignore it entirely. Then, we do a linear interpolation for 8 months being 0 to now being worth 350 points.\n\nThis is working much better and I would love to accept a pull request that implements it on this project.\n\n@StephanBijzitter mention-bot is activated on this project. The way it is implemented is that there's a fixed buffer size for the http request and if the pull request you are requesting is bigger than that it crashes and drops the request. This is not ideal and a pull request to make it read whatever has been downloaded within that fixed size would be appreciated.\n\nHowever, in practice, this only happens for giant pull requests that change everything, which are going to be highly debated and the people involved are going to see it anyway.\n\nI'm going to go ahead and close this pull request as I don't think it's worth losing all the logic. But I'm glad that you were able to use this project as a basis in order to reimplement it in a way that suits your needs and thanks for all the time and efforts you've spent on it!\n"

It appears that #106 only functions for private repositories and operates independently of the ``REQUIRED_ORG`` setting. Looking at the code it appears that the function used ``github.orgs.getForUser({ ... });`` is only capable of iterating over the *public* organizations for a user.\r\n\r\nIt seems like it would be better to use ``github.orgs.getMembers`` which is already exposed inside of mention-bot as ``getMembersOfOrg``, and then filter the list by who is returned by ``getMembersOfOrg`` instead of by calling ``github.orgs.getForUser`` for each potential reviewer. If the bot user is *not* a member of the org, this should still have the result of only seeing public members, but if they *are* a member of the org, it should see private members as well."

I have the problematic diff still.\r\n\r\nThe main one was an edge case for when a new binary file was created, sometimes when [this](https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/mention-bot.js#L113) line got hit and it pushed a diff back onto the list [this area](https://github.com/facebook/mention-bot/blob/master/mention-bot.js#L90) would get hit with `new mode` instead of diff. Initially I just added that to the else block but figured that was likely to cause other downstream problems so I tried to mitigate the issue completely instead."

This works on normal github because you don't need to auth in order to view the screen. Unfortunately this doesn't work on Enterprise if you require auth to view pages. \r\n\r\nIf you are using GHE 2.10, it may be possible to use the GraphQL api, but since we aren't on that yet, we aren't going that route (probably another few months before we upgrade). \r\n\r\nWe are looking into creative ways of getting the blame information from using github api (probably a mix of pull requests, history, commits, and users). Also open to other suggestions. \r\n\r\nWe may submit a PR without this functionality that has a few more toggles added and cleaned up code before then. Will let you know in the near future. "

The last pull request that had reviewers commented was a couple of hours earlier that day, and is located here: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/43748.\r\n\r\nMy best guess is that perhaps something in the GitHub API has changed, so that mentionbot isn't finding the diff to analyze?
