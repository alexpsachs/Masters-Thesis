I already got code to detect cycles in python (where I'm assembling the data for the sankeys), so I just disabled the sankeys if your network has a cycle.\n\nThen I gotta get my head back on straight within computeNodeBreadths, which currently makes it spin.  Then figure out how detect and postpone cyclic links there.\n\nI suspect the loopback links are gonna be beyond my skill level, but we'll see.\n"

And I'm not sure about Antarctica. I think the logic might need to have checks such as if the polar distance between points is greater than some threshold, split the feature.\n"

It would be much nicer to rotate first and clip afterwards, and hopefully this'll simplify the clipping algorithm somewhat too.\n\nA d3.geo.clip API may still be useful for azimuthal projections so that an arbitrary angle can be specified.

        "body": "Splitting features should be pretty straightforward, I think. I'll have a go soon. I was originally thinking to reuse d3.geo.clip, and that would be quite simple (just a matter of modifying the intersection condition to clip against half a great circle). I've made some progress on making it cope with non-simple (self-intersecting) polygons (see clip-complex branch).\n\nWe could also naively split all polygon rings into two on the clip edge, which would lead to artefacts along the edge in some situations, but perhaps not so important since most map edges will have some kind of graticule outline. This is basically the old algorithm in core.\n\nAs for azimuthal clipping, most of the time you want to clip against a circle on the sphere. However, in the case of the tilted perspective projection, it's a bit of a special case and the result is some kind of curve. So it would be nice to have some kind of arbitrary visibility function, which some projections could provide (i.e. azimuthal ones). Another example is the vertical perspective, for which you can calculate the precise horizon.\n"

        "body": "I've added a projection.rotate method. I originally called it projection.origin, but it's not actually backwards-compatible with the old method due to the interaction with parallels (for single- and double-paralleled projections such as Albers). To illustrate with an example, with the old Albers implementation, you might say:\n\n``` js\nvar projection = d3.geo.albers()\n    .origin([-98, 38])\n    .parallels([29.5, 45.5])\n    .scale(1000)\n    .translate([width / 2, height / 2]);\n```\n\nIn the new version, if you rotate so that the origin is 98\u00baW, 38\u00baN, and you specify the same parallels of 29.5\u00baN, 45.5\u00baN, then these parallels will be parallel straight lines (as far as I can tell).\n\n``` js\nvar projection = d3.geo.albersEqualArea()\n    .rotate([98, -38])\n    .parallels([29.5, 45.5])\n    .scale(1000)\n    .translate([width / 2, height / 2]);\n```\n\nExample: http://bl.ocks.org/3760031\n\nSo what you actually want to do is only rotate 98\u00baW, and then change the translate _y_-value so that the origin is once again in the center of the canvas:\n\n``` js\nvar origin = [-98, 38];\n\nvar projection = d3.geo.albersEqualArea()\n    .rotate([-origin[0], 0])\n    .parallels([29.5, 45.5])\n    .scale(1000)\n    .translate([0, 0]);\n\nprojection\n    .translate([width / 2, height / 2 - projection(origin)[1]]));\n```\n\nExample: http://bl.ocks.org/3734308\n\nThat's a bit more code (and not backwards-compatible), so I think it's worth further thought on rotate _vs._ origin and how to support either or both. Also, if the projection is rotated, it will also rotate the graticule, which makes it somewhat less useful unless you compensate for the rotation by correspondingly changing the graticule extent. And having to negate the origin to construct the rotation angle is slightly tedious.\n\nI think it's still a good idea to have a d3.geo.rotate function which operates on GeoJSON features. Though I was also thinking that we might be able to perform the clipping automatically in d3.geo.path by clipping features to the graticule extent (which could be reported by the projection when it needs to be smaller, and otherwise defaults to the default d3.geo.graticule extent?). However, now that I think about it, you'd need to first rotate, then clip, then project. Which suggests that the projection can't encapsulate the rotation, unless the projection also has a way of indicating when going from the previous point to the next point crosses the graticule boundary.\n\nHmm. More thought is required!\n"

        "body": "I had a couple more thoughts last night.\n\nFirst, when rendering features, the immediate need is to worry about _cutting_ rather than _clipping_. By _cutting_ I mean breaking a feature into two or more parts where it crosses the antemeridian; this is needed to avoid discontinuities, while _clipping_ is needed to avoid showing back-facing features. For cutting I believe all we need to worry about are coordinates that span the antemeridian, which we can detect by sequential coordinates \u03bb\u2080, \u03bb\u2081 where |\u03bb\u2081 - \u03bb\u2080| > 180\u00ba (meaning the shorter path between the two coordinates crosses the antemeridian). Then we compute the intersection with the antemeridian, and use that to insert an additional vertex to split the feature into two parts, which are then rendered separately. So, a very simple form of clipping.\n\nSecond, I think those self-intersecting polygons are probably caused by Antarctica. There's an interesting condition when a geographic feature  covers a pole: you get artificial coordinates \u27e8180\u00baW, 90\u00baS\u27e9 and \u27e8180\u00baE, 90\u00baS\u27e9. If you _didn't_ have these coordinates, then how would you know whether Antarctica is a land mass that covers the south pole, or a land mass with a hole at the south pole? Likewise, you need these coordinates to fill in the area south of Antarctica's boundary, as in the [Miller projection](http://bl.ocks.org/3734333). But then of course with other projections such as [stereographic](http://bl.ocks.org/3763057) you end up with a visual artifact where these artificial coordinates are unnecessary and cause spurious lines to the pole. So really we need some way of indicating whether the projection ignores these coordinates.\n"

        "body": "I\u2019ve had similar thoughts about cutting. I think our first concern is, as you say, to split features that cross the antemeridian. This applies to most of our whole-world projections e.g. excluding the orthographic projection (which can show a hemisphere at most) and vertical/tilted perspective projections.\n\nThe algorithm for doing this is pretty much the same as that used for clipping: you don't throw away polygons on the other side of the edge and just rebuild them in the same way that you would normally do for those that you keep. Similar to clipping, a na\u00efve approach could be used that doesn't properly handle holes (like we have in D3 core) - but maybe this is sufficient since a graticule outline may hide artefacts that would otherwise be visible crossing the holes. I need to investigate this though.\n\nI\u2019m probably trying to think ahead too much about polygonal projections and interruptions, both of which don't necessarily need additional splitting since clipPath can be used. For example, the Peirce Quincuncial ideally needs to split features along two edges arranged in a cross on the opposite hemisphere though. But I think that eventually supporting an arbitrary set of _cutting_ edges might be quite useful for that.\n\nLast time I checked, line simplification almost always produces self-intersecting polygons, so I'm not sure it's just Antarctica. Antarctica seems to work fine when I'm clipping world-countries.json, for example. I'd prefer to support self-intersecting polygons if possible though. I _think_ I've cracked it in the clip-complex branch! I see your point about the ambiguity of Antarctica. I'll need to think about whether it's possible to resolve that.\n\nAgreed about exposing the raw projection methods. How about .forward() and .inverse() for retrieving these from a d3.geo.projection instance?\n"

        "body": "Well, one thing I was considering for the raw projections was just a dict of them as `d3.geo.projections`, with the same interface as the current internal (immutable) constructors. For example, you might say `d3.geo.projections.satellite(P, \u03c9)` to get a raw satellite projection.\n\nIn this case it might be cleaner to hang the invert function off of the forward projection, rather than having separate `satellite` and `satelliteInverse` methods. (As you suggested previously.) The other nice thing about this is that you can share constants across the forward and inverse projection, such as:\n\n``` js\nfunction conicEquidistant(\u03c60, \u03c61) {\n  var cos\u03c60 = Math.cos(\u03c60),\n      n = (cos\u03c60 - Math.cos(\u03c61)) / (\u03c61 - \u03c60),\n      G = cos\u03c60 / n + \u03c60;\n\n  function forward(\u03bb, \u03c6) {\n    var \u03c1 = G - \u03c6;\n    return [\n      \u03c1 * Math.sin(n * \u03bb),\n      G - \u03c1 * Math.cos(n * \u03bb)\n    ];\n  }\n\n  forward.invert = function(x, y) {\n    var \u03c10_y = G - y;\n    return [\n      Math.atan2(x, \u03c10_y) / n,\n      G - sgn(n) * Math.sqrt(x * x + \u03c10_y * \u03c10_y)\n    ];\n  };\n\n  return forward;\n}\n```\n\nSince we need to decouple rotation from projection for cutting, it almost feels to me like the rotation should be applied to the d3.geo.path object rather than the d3.geo.projection. Perhaps you could set an optional _rotation_ on the d3.geo.path instance in addition to the projection. I know it's sometimes convenient for the projection to do the rotation internally, but it's not too burdensome if they are decoupled and it certainly makes it cleaner to do the cutting.\n\nOf course, if the rotation is decoupled from the projection, then the parallels will be relative to the rotated coordinates, which might be weird. And it's not obvious how we could make a backwards-compatible projection.origin.\n"

It could default to `return lineString.map(project)`, which is equivalent to what we do right now. But it would also allow much greater flexibility.

        "body": "I've just realised there's a problem with our use of rotations to set origins. I think we're mixing two different concepts here. The concepts are:\n1. Central meridian and standard parallels. These mainly define the longitude of interest (such that its meridian can be vertical, for example when using conics), and the latitudes of \"true scale\". So if we go back to the Albers projection example of the U.S., you were right to use a rotation by longitude only, and then apply a translation so that the U.S. is in the centre of the viewport (or in other words, the \"origin\" in pixel space is the centre of the U.S.).\n   \n   However, rotating latitudinally introduces a slight distortion compared with just translating in pixel-space. This is because although we had adjusted the standard parallels, they are no longer parallel to the original parallels that have now been rotated! I've tried to illustrate this with [an example](http://bl.ocks.org/3771881).\n   \n   I feel like using the longitudinal rotation to set the central meridian is just a way to allow the code to be simplified by not requiring a \"central meridian\" parameter, but I'm fine with continuing to do this as I can't see any problem with it.\n2. The second concept is that of an \"origin\" of interest, which could be interpreted either way, but I feel is more about setting an appropriate translation offset so that the feature of interest is centred appropriately.\n\nSo in conclusion, I think we should probably:\n- restore .rotate(\u03b4\u03bb, \u03b4\u03c6, \u03b4\u03b3) and drop .origin.\n- retain .origin for azimuthal projections (using .rotate as it does now), for backwards-compatibility. I don't know if we want to add some kind of .translateTo(\u2026) convenience method for all projections though.\n"

        "body": "By the way, I think the cut in Antarctica is only there since this is along the antemeridian, and inserting it means that cylindrical projections will work out-of-the-box. I think if you assume that all land polygons are smaller than a hemisphere, then there is no ambiguity even if you apply an arbitrary rotation, since you can always detect which side of the line should be the interior.\n\nThe other possible resolution is the fact that we implicitly assume the exterior ring is clockwise, and the interior rings are anti-clockwise, so that the default fill rule \"just works\" in SVG. I _think_ this alone can also resolve the ambiguity: if you have an exterior ring that appears anti-clockwise from one direction, then you know you need flip your viewpoint and fill on the other side. However, I don't think GeoJSON mandates a particular ordering at the moment, so this may be dependent on what generated the GeoJSON.\n\nBut I agree it would be a good idea to auto-detect any existing cuts like this and rejoin. So it's not a matter of ignoring points at the poles, it's just a matter of detecting a sequence of points [a, b, a] and replacing with [a]. I think this is more of a generic fix that should be applied to all GeoJSON features that come from shape files that automatically have such cuts, rather than just azimuthals. I guess in a way it should applied when generating the GeoJSON in the first place, but we should be liberal in what we can accept and it's easy enough to implement.\n"

        "body": "Regarding the order of rotating, clipping and projecting, I see three possibilities:\n1. Rotate, clip and then project. The advantage is that clipping _after_ rotating can be optimised for the common cases of antemeridian and azimuthal clipping: the antemeridian is simply \u03bb = \u00b1180\u00b0, and the azimuthal projections typically clip against z = 0 or z = some constant value in 3-space, so it seems like this can be more efficient. Although, if we have .projectLine and .projectPolygon, I guess the azimuthal projections may reuse the cos(c) term anyway, which is normally used to determine visibility of points.\n2. Clip, rotate, then project. In this case we need to rotate the clip edge first, so that the \"cut\" becomes the antemeridian when everything is rotated in the second step.\n3. Rotate, project and _then_ clip in pixel-space. I don't think this would always really work: it would involve detecting large enough changes in pixel coordinates and inserting breaks at these points (or interpolating towards the nearest graticule outline).\n\nI guess this idea of encapsulating clipping/cutting in the projections means the projection can perform the operations in any order, but I thought I may as well note down my thoughts anyway. I think the first option seems best.\n"

Here's a slightly modified proposal:\n- Remove projection.origin and projection.oblique.\n- Add back projection.rotate([\u03bb, \u03c6, \u03b3]).\n- Add projection.center([\u03bb, \u03c6]) which determines the appropriate offset to center the specified longitude and latitude at the \u27e8x,y\u27e9 specified by projection.translate([x, y]). The name \u201ccenter\u201d is consistent with popular JavaScript mapping libraries and avoids conflict with the old \u201corigin\u201d method.\n- For backwards-compatibility, we can implement projection.origin as (ignoring getter, temporarily):\n\n``` js\nprojection.origin = function(coordinates) {\n  return projection.rotate([-coordinates[0], 0]).center([0, coordinates[1]]);\n};\n```\n\nIt's tempting to deprecate projection.origin because it can be specified as a rotate and center, but this will be the common path for most projections so I think it makes sense to retain as a supported API.\n"

So \u27e8\u00b1180\u00ba,*\u27e9.\n\nI've checked in the new projection.rotate and projection.center. However, I think retaining projection.origin and projection.oblique is a bad idea. For one thing, I realized that projection.origin means different things for different projections; the backwards-compatible implementation I described only applies to Albers (and possibly other conic projections?). For azimuthal projections then origin maps directly to a flipped rotate.\n\nAlso, I realized that it isn't precisely backwards-compatible even for Albers because the projection.center remains consistent even if you change the projection.translate. So currently albersUsa is broken, but I think we can patch in a backwards-compatible origin for the existing projections that need it.\n"

That has the benefit of simplifying the API and exposing the raw projections. The downside is that someone could reassign the raw projection in a weird way, and it's an awkward way to create a raw projection if that's all you want.\n- I'd like to _not_ expose singleParallelProjection and doubleParallelProjection, since that adds extra weight to the API. But at the same time, doubleParallelProjection is needed by d3.geo.albers and by some of the extended projections, so it's not obvious whether we can share the code without exposing it from core.\n- We probably still want to go through the code and consolidate constants (e.g., \u03c0 / 180).\n"

        "body": "First cut of clipping (for azimuthal projections) is in the new [clip branch](https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/clip). This uses the new clipping algorithm, which has the self-intersections caveat that I mentioned previously. A potential fix for this is in the clip-complex branch (although I haven't updated this to use the new API). We could of course use the old d3.geo.circle algorithm as an alternative.\n\nJust to clarify about clipping, there are a couple of options:\n1. When clipping polygons, each ring can be clipped separately so that the resulting rings are also separate. This can lead to artefacts where the exterior ring crosses what should be a hole, but only along the clip line. So if there is a graticule outline like in many of the current examples, it could cover this up. However, if you didn't want an outline, such as in your Natural Earth Coastlines example, you would see the artefacts (although they only apply to holes, which are fairly rare in practice). The advantage is that it's probably more efficient to implement since you don't need to build a linked list and traverse it in a particular order, and it doesn't care about self-intersections.\n2. The new general algorithm that I've worked on for d3.geo.clip, which uses Weiler-Atherton and at the moment can't handle self-intersections, although I think I've found a fix for this. This works nicely for the Natural Earth Coastlines (although it won't work if you use straightforward line simplification since this introduces self-intersections quite quickly).\n\nI'm tempted to switch the the first option for the master branch (and possibly for core if it's integrated), and work further on the second for a future version. I'll see how it goes with the self-intersection fix.\n\nOh, and I'm excited about the automatic resampling! As well as simplifying graticules, it means clipping no longer needs to interpolate between intersection points assuming the clip edge is a great circle (which I think it is in all cases, except maybe tilted perspective).\n"

Then project, A \u21a6 A\u2032, B \u21a6 B\u2032, C \u21a6 C\u2032. If we can estimate the improvement by subdividing AC into AB and BC, we can determine whether to keep subdividing recursively.\n\nFor example, a Douglas\u2013Peucker approach: Compute D\u2032, the point along A\u2032C\u2032 that is closest to B\u2032. If the projected distance |B\u2032D\u2032| > \u03b5, subdivide AB and BC recursively. Alternatively Visvalingham: Compute the area of the triangle A\u2032B\u2032C\u2032.\n\nThis nice thing is that this should hopefully minimize the amount of work required to draw straight lines, while also providing beautiful results when curves are needed. Assuming it works.\n"

        "body": "Great idea. It\u2019s like line simplification but in reverse!\n\nJust realised something. I was thinking this could potentially simplify the graticules code e.g. you mentioned earlier:\n\n> If projections resample automatically, then d3.geo.graticule doesn't need a precision setting; resampling can be performed by projections as needed (and skipped for cylindrical projections!).\n\nActually, this is not quite correct if we use generic great-circle resampling, since lines of latitude (parallels) are not all great circles, so resampling in between the step points would be slightly off. So to optimise graticules, we may be better off sampling at a higher precision and applying line simplification after projecting.\n\nOn the other hand I think it could simplify the cutting code, since it could interpolate in between the cut points and use only as many points as are needed, which would be nice.\n"

The true length of the angular step for the equatorial line is much greater than that for the graticule line at \u03c6=80\u00b0, say.\n\nSo, imagine rotating the graticule on a sphere, such that the equatorial line is close to the sphere's South Pole. \n\nSince the distortion is much greater at the poles when using cylindricals and conics, even a precision of 1\u00b0 becomes a large distance in px. And for conics, this low-precision line doesn't follow the curve so it's very obvious. Unfortunately, increasing precision to 0.1\u00b0 makes animating much slower! The same low-precision graticule line appears in cylindricals but it's not noticeable since it's approximately the right shape.\n\nSo we definitely need some kind of resampling for rotated graticules (or we could use high precision and then simplify). Even if we ended using great-circle resampling, that would avoid this overlap issue and would probably be good enough even though it'll be slightly off compared with true lines of latitude.\n"

        "body": "OK, here's an updated list of what we still need to do:\n- Should resampling be turned on or off by default? I'm tempted to leave it off for simplicity and speed, but if it's fast and correct enough, I'd like to leave it on by default. For example I had to disable it in the [sterographic projection example](http://bl.ocks.org/3763057) because it was slow.\n- Also, the sterographic example now exhibits an occasional artifact which I suspect is related to antemeridian cutting: at certain angles a black line that splits the screen. I'd rather not disable antemeridian cutting, so perhaps we can figure out what's causing the artifact and fix it?\n- Lastly, what is the current state of clipping? I updated the [gnomonic projection example](http://bl.ocks.org/3757349) to use the new projection branch, but unfortunately it appears that d3.geo.circle's clipping is insufficient to render correctly. It works with the d3.geo.clip plugin, but I'm not up-to-date on the work you've done there and I'd like to understand why d3.geo.circle doesn't work. Also, even with the d3.geo.clip plugin, the graticule outline is a bit finicky; the extent has to fit within the clip angle. Same thing with the [orthographic projection example](http://bl.ocks.org/3757125).\n- Should we expose raw projections as d3.geo.foo.raw? Seems like a good idea to me for reusability.\n\nI will also work on tests.\n"

        "body": "- I'd like to have it on by default, assuming we can work out any performance issues. It automatically resolves quite a few issues with the more distorted projections. Probably the best example is Albers.\n  \n  The recursion depth of 16 feels too high, since this means it could insert up to 65,536 new points for a given point! It sounds like the resampling was recursing too much on the large distances produced by the stereographic projection. So clipping would also help here.\n- Some projections shouldn't cut along the _whole_ antemeridian, since it can introduce a visible cut. In particular, various of the azimuthal projections should ideally clip against a circle of varying angles. The stereographic projection needs virtually no cutting, because the only discontinuity is at the antipode! So any cuts outside of the antipode can potentially be visible.\n  \n  So really it's a matter of deciding how to handle polygons that subsume the antipode, because ideally we'd insert a circle at \"Infinity\" to ensure the fill is on the right side. Another way of thinking about it is that we need to clip against an infinitesimally small circle at the antipode.\n  \n  Browsers seem to slow down when very large px values are introduced. So we should have some kind of reasonably-sized clip circle at the antipode to avoid this.\n  \n  Related to this, I'd like the ability to vary the height of the cut. This means we could create polygonal projections (I believe) with just a single cut, with the cut height being a polygon side length. For example, imagine a cube net.\n- The d3.geo.clip plugin uses a completely new algorithm that can handle holes correctly, and doesn't introduce any artefacts along the clip edge. The only problems with it are: a) it can't handle polygonal self-intersections, which are introduced by d3.simplify, and b) there may be some occasional crashes due to precision errors. I've attempted to fix these in the clip-complex branch. Plus it's slower than naive approaches, since it has to maintain a linked list of intersection points and sort it.\n  \n  The d3.geo.circle in core uses a more naive, but probably more robust approach, where it doesn't care about holes or introducing lines along the clip edge.\n  \n  I believe gnomonic needs to be clipped just _before_ 90\u00b0, which might explain the problem you were seeing?  It seems to work at 89\u00b0 for me. Not sure if browser slowdown for large px values is part of the issue closer to 90\u00b0.\n  \n  I'd like to rewrite d3.geo.circle using a similar approach to antemeridian cutting with speed as the main priority. The nice thing is that we no longer have to worry about origins, since the world is already rotated for us prior to clipping. So I'd like to start off with just supporting clipping on the great circle going through \u03bb = \u00b190\u00b0. That would be useful for a number of hemispherical projections in general, and should be as fast as antemeridian cutting.\n"

If I understand correctly, this could also be used with the stereographic projection with an angular radius of 90\u00ba - \u03b5 to avoid the discontinuity. Assuming clipping is fast enough we could incorporate this into projections as well, and then projections would be able to set default clip angles. Then orthographic would work out of the box. You could still disable clipping by setting the clip angle to 0\u00ba.\n"

        "body": "Remaining API design decisions:\n1. ~~Should we expose all raw projections via projection.raw()? This would make life a bit easier by removing .scale(1).translate([0, 0]) when creating composite or polyhedral projections, although admittedly this is fairly unusual, so I\u2019d be okay to leave this out for now.~~\n2. Related to the previous point, should the raw projection function that is passed to d3.geo.projection take a coordinates array instead of separate arguments for longitude and latitude? I know I said it was nicer to have separate arguments, but I\u2019m thinking the projection plugin could always have a simple wrapper to make the code more readable, and easy composition seems more beneficial (particularly if we _do_ expose all projections via .raw).\n3. Should we extend .clipAngle to apply to antemeridian cutting? This would allow it to work in the unusual case where you have a polyhedral projection that doesn't cut from pole to pole e.g. a cube. If so, we\u2019d need some other way to distinguish circle vs. meridian clipping e.g. clip(\"meridian\" | \"circle\").\n\nI guess the only pertinent one is no. 2, and the others are probably okay as they are.\n\nEdge cases I\u2019d like to address:\n- ~~I\u2019ve spotted an anomaly in some of my own test data: probably something to do with large polygons surrounding the clip area, or self-intersections in general. I\u2019d like to try a different approach to the self-intersection fix, so this might address it.~~\n- There are some minor shortcuts taken when clipping against a circle e.g. it completely ignores two points that are outside the circle, but whose connecting line crosses the circle.\n\nThese are not serious enough to block a release, though.\n\nLastly, optimisations: I think one approach could be to use context.lineTo(x, y, z) internally to avoid converting to and from spherical coordinates unnecessarily during both clipping and resampling. I don\u2019t think this affects the public API of context.lineTo(x, y), since we already have context.lineTo(\u03bb, \u03c6) internally, but it\u2019s worth mentioning this just in case.\n"

As such, you don't know what you'll get\n- The bl.ocks view seems to have its own css, so you may just want to use the \"Open in a new window\" link to see it more fully.\n- (bug) This code doesn't seem to handle 'self-cycles', where a node loops back onto itself.\n\nLet me know if this seems usable!\n"

        "body": "Good idea. An alternative could be a way to turn off clipping and cutting? Then you might just say:\n\n``` js\nd3.geo.projection(function(x, y) { return [x, y]; }).clip(false);\n```\n\nRelated: I\u2019m still interested in having a way to change the height of the antemeridian cutting. So I\u2019m thinking something like .clipAngle would apply to either clipping or cutting. You could then switch between clipping and cutting by using .clip(\"antemeridian\" | \"circle\").\n\nOne nice side-benefit is that it allows for possible extensions for other types of clipping in future e.g. you could pass a function that takes a GeoJSON object and returns all the LineStrings that need to be joined up in the correct order. So you could clip against arbitrary shapes this way. I\u2019m not saying we _should_ support this, but it\u2019s a possibility if it turns out it\u2019s useful.\n\nFor d3.simplify, what projection would be best if spherical coordinates are preserved? Perhaps any equal-area projection? I guess it will be useful to preserve coordinates for any cylindrical projection if you only rotate longitudinally, since distortion is constant along lines of latitude, and preserving coordinates means you get antemeridian cutting for free.\n"

The `3.0` refers to any git ref, in this case the 3.0 branch.\n\nThe d3.geo.projection plugin in master requires D3 V3 for the tests to pass. I only really added package.json so that you can easily run `npm install` followed by `npm test`.\n\nIt looks like Bower only supports tags at the moment, see twitter/bower#107 for a long and inconclusive discussion about it.\n\nSince v3.0 is under development, it might be simpler for you to wait until it's released and tagged, and just copy the plugin files that you need in the meantime.  I view d3-plugins more as a collection of plugins rather than a single versioned package, so I prefer to copy individual plugins when I use them.\n"

Here are two examples:\n- [Interrupted sinusoidal](http://bl.ocks.org/4458991)\n- [Interrupted Goode homolosine](http://bl.ocks.org/4448587)\n\nThey use separate implementations for singly- and doubly-interrupted projections (the latter being when the northern hemisphere is divided differently from the southern hemisphere). However, since the implementations are so similar, it seems reasonable to me to just have a doubly-interrupted projection implementation, perhaps with a convenience option for setting both hemispheres to use the same interruptions.\n\nIt might be worth using a name other that \u201cgore\u201d to define the interruptions. That one\u2019s a bit hard to search on the internet. :frowning: \n"

This has worked well for me for polyhedra and Berghaus star.  (Note that you don't need an inset at the poles though, this should interpolate to the correct longitude automatically.)\n\nI'm thinking d3.geo.polyhedron might be able to handle these types of interruptions too; we are cutting the globe into spherical polygons, except that we only want to join the projected faces by a single vertex, rather than an edge.  We can do some cool things particularly with conics if we orient the projected faces according to the meridian at the join point.  Also, it has code to compute inverses (which I will optimise at some point).\n\nI'd be fine with including this in the plugin for now though.\n\nYes, I see how \"gore\" could be problematic. :)\n"

Is there any chance of the zoom behavior talking in geographical units or the projection code being able to talk in translates?\n\nFor instance, right now, `projection(foo)` can give you the screen coords of a feature, but not the 'from origin translate' of that feature. The approach so far has been to keep the zoom behavior & projection in sync (via scale & translate). Using `center`, this is a lot less clear (relevant code: https://github.com/systemed/iD/blob/7cda89b75753b9ad4d300e267bae5b0f5f86995c/js/id/renderer/map.js#L135 ).\n"

        "body": "I completely agree there is a use for tile coordinates when you need to speak tiles, but that is not the case in the simple examples above. There is no tile coordinate system implied in my earlier snippet; there is only the geographic coordinate system and pixels. It is d3.geo.tile that internally maps pixels to tile coordinates, but it could apply any number of strategies to do so (why not hex tiles?) and my point is that it is not required to expose the tile coordinate system in order to use d3.geo.tile.\n\nBut, as you say, d3.geo.tile _could_ expose the mapping from pixels to tiles, as there are useful applications of the tile coordinate system outside of simply loading them. And in essence it does that already, because d3.geo.tile returns the set of tile coordinates that are visible in the viewport. This interface could be extended to expose the direct mapping between pixels and tiles, similar to projection.\n\nWhat I am arguing for, albeit poorly, is that I would like to avoid coupling d3.geo.projection to tile coordinates, and likewise avoid coupling d3.geo.tile to geographic coordinates. d3.geo.projection should handle geography \u2194 pixels, and d3.geo.tile should handle pixels \u2194 tiles.\n"

In the [mercator code](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/blob/master/src/geo/mercator.js), D3 already transforms the raw projection by 1/(2\u03c0) so the tile math starts there, and ends up sort-of scattered throughout the chain. I agree that it\u2019s not required to expose the coordinates to use `tile`, I just think it would be better and more composable implementation if it was exposed legibly.\n\nIn Modest Maps, I chose a coupling that\u2019s actually quite similar to the one you\u2019re trying to avoid, so this might be a matter of taste. =) MMaps projections know about tile coordinates but not about pixels, so they have an explicit post-projection affine transformation, typically from \u00b1\u03c0 to 0\u20261 for spherical mercator. Maps know about tile coordinates and pixels but not geography, so they defer to the projection to perform that translation. Tile providers link the two together.\n\nI\u2019ve found it very helpful for additional work to have that available.\n"

        "body": "Yes, I was surprised at the simplicity, but in fact the satellite projection is the view of a point at a given distance above the sphere\u2019s surface, which you can reason about in 2D, so the sphere becomes a circle:\n\nDraw a line from the satellite to the circle centre (with length D).  Then draw a line from the satellite to its horizon.  This line will be tangent to the circle at the horizon point.  Hence it will be at right-angles to the circle radius at this point, making a right-angle triangle.  We assume the radius is 1 (because D is a multiple of the radius), hence cos \u03b8 = 1 / D.\n\nI\u2019ve tested this with different tilt angles, and it works quite well, but it looks like tilt angles above a certain amount (around 20\u00b0 for my particular test) result in large values that cause the browser to stop drawing everything properly, and when you clamp the pixel values the projection appears to loop back on itself (above the horizon so not overlapping).  But I think it\u2019s safe to say you wouldn\u2019t actually want to use such angles as the distortion is extremely high.  As you can see, the horizon calculation still looks correct though. :)\n\n![Screen Shot 2013-03-01 at 19 04 54](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/31223/210932/06aa32b8-82a3-11e2-9476-e03cdda09fb0.png)\n"

Another idea is to take the d3.geo.bounds of the viewport (in spherical coordinates) and use for projection.clipExtent (which should be a little faster, at least until I optimise clipPolygon!), and use in conjunction with clipPath.  These would only really work if the viewport coordinates are all invertible i.e the view is entirely filled, so I still think pixel-space clipping is the better approach (and it may also give us a speed boost, too).\n"

On the other hand, I think it's also important that mercator and transverseMercator function consistently.\n\nIdeally, we would remove the 2\u03c0 scale factor from the d3.geo.mercator. However, this would break most existing code that uses d3.geo.mercator (even if it doesn't throw an error), and so this should be considered backwards-incompatible reserved for 4.0. But, we could throw caution to the wind and call it a \"bug fix\"\u2026\n\nOr, we could create a new d3.geo.sphericalMercator projection without the 2\u03c0, and deprecate d3.geo.mercator. But then in 4.0, would we deprecate the sphericalMercator alias after removing the 2\u03c0 scale factor? And then in 5.0 remove sphericalMercator? That's clunky, and verbose. And also, this might be confusing since it suggests that d3.geo.mercator is not spherical, when in practice we'd control that through some other property of the d3.geo.projection. Other names might be \"mercator2\", \"fixedMercator\", \"unscaledMercator\"\u2026\n\nOr, we could fix only d3.geo.mercator.raw, and make d3.geo.mercator's scale function backwards-compatible by multiplying by 2\u03c0 internally. This would allow you to create your own non-scaled projection as d3.geo.projection(d3.geo.mercator.raw), while d3.geo.mercator would behave the same as it always has. This isn't a horrible solution, but it doesn't really make d3.geo.mercator consistent with d3.geo.transverseMercator, and it doesn't provide a path to deprecation for the old scale factor. So, it doesn't really accomplish anything except add junk code! :)\n\nDo you have a preference? I guess I'm leaning towards removing the scale factor from d3.geo.mercator, and then fixing the affected examples (such as the [d3.geo.tile demo](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4150951)).\n"

        "body": "> d3.box relies on SVG, which IE8 doesn\u2019t support.\n\nHighCharts https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com solved this by rendering VML instead of SVG for IE8. It works so well https://github.com/highslide-software/highcharts.com/blob/master/js/parts/VmlRenderer.js that it can even \"export SVG\" under IE8.\n\nD3 is praised as THE visualization so library because it's plug-ins can render what standard charts can't. IE 8 is unfortunately still widely used in companies that make use of such visualizations, so I guess they just don't use D3 :(.\n\n> If you\u2019re stuck with IE8, you could try using Chrome Frame.\n\nThis is mostly not an alternative :(. If users are allowed to use Chrome Frame, than they're allowed to use Chrome directly, and this is not the case :(.\n"

        "body": "D3 is not a compatibility layer, and will never support IE8 with an SVG-to-VML fallback. Sorry. You are welcome to try using [SVG Web](https://code.google.com/p/svgweb/) or [Rapha\u00ebl.js](http://raphaeljs.com/) via [R2D3](https://github.com/mhemesath/r2d3/), but these require non-trivial effort, and even if you get it working, they are necessarily slow because IE8 is slow. Any fallback will greatly limit what you can do.\n\nFor my own graphics, I try to design such that the static view conveys most of the information, while interaction or animation provides an additional level of depth. (See Ben Shneiderman's [infovis mantra](http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/5784/1/TR_96-66.pdf) for further context.) This isn't always possible, of course\u2014some graphics are necessarily dynamic. But when it is, you can simply provide a screenshot as the fallback for IE8 and below, which requires minimal work on your part, and lets you devote your effort to supporting standard browsers that move the web forward.\n"

Gas could come after Solid and not cause any vertical spacing issues.  A better example would be \"Electricity Grid\".  All of those tiny lines get crushed together to form a dark blob.  If they were rotated down until they fill the height, then add another level and rotate down again, I think the visualization would be better.\n\nGreat job BTW!\n"

        "body": "That reminds me, there\u2019s a related problem where the interpolated projection can get out of sync with its a & b projections if their center or translate changes after alpha is set. I debate whether it\u2019s a requirement that the interpolated projection be a \u201cview\u201d on its constituent projection, but at the same time there\u2019s no way to take a snapshot of a projection so the alternative is to allow undefined behavior.\n\nMaybe it would be cleaner to interpolate raw projection functions instead, but then you\u2019d have to expose some other API for interpolating changes to scale, center, translate, rotate, etc. Also that would avoid trying to interpolate changes in clipping behavior, which isn\u2019t possible.\n"

If you read Stephen Few\u2019s [original paper](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/misc/Bullet_Graph_Design_Spec.pdf), you\u2019ll find that he mentions:\n- The featured measure: this is a single, primary measure encoded as a bar.\n- One or two comparative measures: these are encoded as short lines (markers in bullet.js).\n\nHe only mentions splitting the primary measure into multiple measures under \u201coptional features\u201d.  In fact, the purpose of this is to display a _projected target based on the primary measure_, not arbitrary comparative measures as you are doing.  In other words, the measures should be an array of `[current, projected based on current, \u2026]`, where it is always the case that current \u2264 projected, so reordering is done to ensure the smaller measure is drawn on top of the larger.\n"

While I really cannot rule out that I'm using it wrong, I don't fully follow the reasoning. \nIf you think e.g. about solar radiation it may well be that current measure is high while projected measure is lower based on weather forecast, leading to current > projected. In this case the sorting leads to colors being swapped for current + projected measure.\nIt might be more helpful to swap drawing order in this case by keep color coding of current/projected as-is?\n"

        "body": "I think Stephen intended the current measure to indicate the _sum_ of some metric over _part_ of a time interval, whereas the projected measure would be the same metric extended to cover the _whole_ interval.\n\nIn your solar radiation example, you appear to be showing an efficiency ratio of energy per peak output, which can\u2019t really be summed in the same manner as if you were showing total energy (e.g. kWh), in which case the projected value will be \u2265 the current value, even if the forecast is bad.\n\nAnother way of thinking about it is that the splitting of the primary measure (the bar) into two makes it look like a progress bar.  So I think it would be confusing if the colours became swapped, because it will no longer work like a progress bar.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t using a measure that can be sensibly summed, then I think it\u2019s best to use a single measure, and any comparative measures for the past (or future) should be encoded as markers.\n"

        "body": "@kunalb first of, thank you for adding that separate pull request. A quick question for you: with this pull request (adding cyclic link support), are there cases where some data without cycles is rendered worse than the old version (the one in d3-plugins)? Basically, is your PR regressing anything?\n\nIf not, it seems this is a net improvement, and one that we could iterate on. \n\nThe reason I'm pushing on this particular item is that we'd really like to include sankey visualization support in something that we're doing, but it's kind of a bummer that it either hangs/errors if your data has cycles. This is especially problematic for us because our data is dynamic and we can't control whether it is cyclic or not.\n\n@mbostock: what can we do to help get this issue solved?\n"

So, when cursor is in center of the svg element, cells near to the cursor are bigger than the cells far from cursor in all directions. \n\nFocus at center:\n![centered focus](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5295212/2284402/e9b4b0cc-9fc8-11e3-9782-e46cebbb4568.jpg)\n\nBut! When cursor is close to edges of the svg element, cells which are in outer directions from cursor are smaller then the inner ones. For example, \n\nFocus near to left side:\n![focus at left side](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5295212/2284409/f9c174e6-9fc8-11e3-8e26-3cdccf07c898.jpg)\n\nAs you can see at last screen shot, cells located at very left side of the svg element are very smaller than just next one to the right.\n\nI hope I explained it in a better way. And any help to fix this issue is welcome! ;)\n"

The way I intend it to be used is with a geographic projection:\n\n``` js\nvar projection = d3.geo.mercator()\n    .center([-76.3429, 38.7351]) // geographic center\n    .scale(1 << 12) // zoom level in tile coordinates\n    .translate([width / 2, height / 2]);\n\nvar tile = d3.geo.tile()\n    .scale(projection.scale())\n    .translate(projection([0, 0]))\n    .size([width, height]);\n```\n\nBut there\u2019s definitely an opportunity to make this usage more obvious. Open to suggestions.\n"

        "body": "This is quite simple to do, but requires a small modification to the tile plugin so that tiles with negative x-coordinates are not excluded.  Rather than include such tiles (which could cause broken images in existing examples), perhaps the best solution would be a new option, `wrap([x, y])`, where `x` and `y` are booleans indicating wrapping in either direction?  Most commonly `wrap([true, false])` would be used for maps.\n\nNote that only tiles with negative coordinates are currently excluded.  The MapBox examples seem to have grey tiles for positive tile coordinates outside the quadtree, but not for negative coordinates.  It might be worth excluding these positive tiles too for consistency, since we currently have grey on the positive edges and white on the negative edges.\n\nAlternatively we could remove the exclusion of tiles with negative coordinates.  But this would force everyone to filter the resulting tiles to ensure they don't produce broken images, and although the code for wrapping is quite simple, it would be even simpler to have an API for such a common scenario.\n"

Perhaps better stated, reducing their width (even though their starts and ends flair out to the right width, kind of reduces their visual impact more than I think is best for this kind of visualization...\nThat said, great work!  :-)\n"

The problem is that the tiles are removed immediately when they are no longer needed (e.g., when the nearest integer zoom level changes), rather than waiting until the new tiles that will replace them have loaded. One way to avoid flickering is to listen to the new tiles being loaded, and when new tiles completely cover an old tile, remove the old tile. This is outside the scope of d3.geo.tile, which simply computes which tiles are visible in a given viewport, and nothing else.\n"

Just a delay of 0.5-1s before a tile is removed can solve 90% of flickering cases. This would improve a lot of visualisations that are built on top of your example.\n\nEven if you think that de-flickering is outside of the team's interest, please at least consider replacing `Math.random()` in the tile url. See above + [demo](http://bl.ocks.org/kachkaev/cbac7a598b81973be6df9b5a1cc6d6c4).\n\nCheers!\n"

It's frustrating because parameters from Proj4 or WKT is all I have to lean on coming over from a GIS or shapefile/raster metadata.\r\n\r\n@mbostock your examples above are a little confusing because in EPSG:2163, `+lat_0=45`  and `+lon_0=-100` maps to `.rotate([100, -45])`. While in ESRI:102003 `+lat_0=37.5` maps to `.center([0, 37.5])` and `+lon_0=-96 ` maps to  `.rotate([-96, 0])`.  Is the particular placement of parameters within the projection functions dependent on the projection chosen?\r\n\r\nSo I'm looking for help in filling out what D3 functions maps to what in this list from here <http://proj4.org/parameters.html>\r\nI've given it a start for the d3.geo.albers() example, in bold\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n+a         Semimajor radius of the ellipsoid axis\r\n+alpha     ?
