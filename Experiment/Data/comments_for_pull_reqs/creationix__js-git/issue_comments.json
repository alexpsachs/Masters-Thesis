This kind of sucks.\n- The `zlib` shim only includes `inflateSync`, which means that we'll have to make use of the `\"browser\"` field in package.json's to use inflate/deflate. And those shims should certainly seek to use web workers where possible, to lower the chance of a \"this tab timed out\" notification while generating/parsing packfiles.\n\nwhat are weaknesses in node that make this hard?\n- To parse a packfile without an index, you have to be able to say \"take N bytes into inflate until you get a result of X size\"; currently node's zlib (and by extension, browserify's), doesn't handle this use case well.\n\nmy plan for the near future:\n- create a readable/writable stream that accepts packfile data and outputs offsets that can be used by `git-packfile` to read objects.\n- square away a `git-smart-http-remote` repo that works with `git-fetch-pack`.\n- work on a quick read-only git demo in browser\n- then do the read/write demo.\n"

        "body": "@creationix Agreed on there not being a huge amount of value for interop at the filesystem level; at best it provides us with test data to feed into the other packages. It shouldn't be the focus (though really, at this point it's 90% done -- both pack and loose odbs are implemented and while it's currently readonly, it's really simple to create loose pack objects).\n\nre: browserify's shims: `zlib` is probably the most problematic -- though that can be shimmed for something like `zpipe` using browserify's `\"browser\": {\"./file.js\": \"shim-file.js\"}` package.json directive. Really, the primary problem with most of the zlib implementations I've found is that they don't differentiate data returned with `Z_STREAM_END` from data returned with `Z_OK`; I've been banging my head against this for the last week or so. Ideally, we'll support node (so you can run a git server entirely in JS), so this'll have to get solved sooner rather than later. Dan Lucraft's `git.js` got around this by including a slightly modified version of `raw-deflate.js` (the zlib implementation that's been floating around the internet, unlicensed, since 1998) that counts the number of compressed bytes involved in generating output.\n\nIn practice, the buffer shim isn't a huge problem -- it can be mostly solved by converting to typed arrays either on-the-fly (which is what I've been doing thus far) using `new Uint8Array(buffer.parent).subarray(buffer.offset, buffer.offset + buffer.length)` and keeping a map of buffer parents to uint8array instances around (to offset the cost of creating uint8arrays) or at entry / exit points (harder, since this implies that every stream will have to be reworked to accept only uint8arrays and have to be piped through a conversion stream. Really, browserify buys us a lot more than it costs us -- especially with the `--standalone` generation option.\n\n@kuba-kubula thanks for the link! I recently found (like, last night) that imaya's inflate implementation might not be able to inflate certain decompressed streams (namely, those with predefined dictionaries) so I might try plugging in zpipe instead.\n\nIf all goes well (and I'm optimistic -- I just got the `git-pack-unpack` stream 90% working last night; it emits offsets of objects within a packfile so we can generate an index / pull them out and put those objects in a more browser-sane object db), I should have some sort of demo by the end of the coming weekend.\n"

So, ideally, this repo would provide the following: the project site itself plus possibly a dev blog (as a gh-pages branch), the documentation (which should cover the constituent libraries and give those curious an idea of how it all hangs together), and a porcelain library which should provide similar functionality to the `git` commands after loading a repo. \n\nSuper ideally, but totally up to you: \n- It would use vanilla node concepts -- streams, event emitters, callbacks; \n- It should be concentrated on solving the 80% use case instead of being flexible. i.e., we _could_ allow plugging different odb backends here, but it might be better to just pick one that works in node and one that works in browser and ship something like that.\n"

There is a lot of complexity mapping between how git works internally and the interface we're all familiar with.

No need to pull in more functionality than that.\n\nI also think there's value in a general purpose library, kind of in the style of [shelljs](https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs), but it should be straight forward to provide this as a sort of wrapper around what these multiple projects.\n"

A stream is very often a value you pass around and makes sense to be an object because it has two very distinct channels (data and close).  But a sink it usually either a standalone helper function in some library or a part of some other object.  The only thing I want to standardize is the property name for the sink in the case where it's part of a duplex stream object.  I think `consume` is fine.  I chose `sink` to be consistent with min-streams and also because it's four letters just like `read` and `stop`. \n"

        "body": "@Raynos I really like the tcp accepting a transformer instead of just providing a duplex object and ignoring the return value!\n\nI'm fine with `stop` requiring the callback if you feel strongly about it.  It will make the API a little harder to use, but considering it's not a hot path for most programs, that should be fine.\n\n> We should specify the allowed states. A stream is basically zero or more values followed by an end (an end which is either natural or caused by an error)\n\nYes\n\n> We should specify that once the callback fires any call to `.read()` will not return any more values. Optionally specify that when you call `.stop()` and even before the callback fires it should not return any values to the read callback. Basically it would be useful to spec out the relationship between `stop()` and `read()`\n\nThis gets tricky in larger chains.  The source may be done sending events and indeed never send anything after calling the callback to `.stop()`, but the layers after it may still have data pending in the pipeline that eventually comes out.  The `stop` channel is very fast and often will be a direct reference to the stop function in the source.  The spec should then say:\n\nThe source will never output data events after a stop request has been received, but be aware that other layers downstream may still contain data.\n"

        "body": "@dominictarr \n\n> regards a consume method, I think consistency trumps necessity.\n> There are places where you don't care whether something is a complete sink, or just one side of a transform. Also, if a sink is an object, then you can explain sources, explain sinks, and then explain a transform as both a source and a sink.\n> \n> I started using the word \"sink\" to designate a stream that has no readable side - this reflects the usage of the word 'sink' in graph theory http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sink_(disambiguation) . having a method \"sink\" on a transform stream breaks this.\n\nHaving a transform that is an object with both readable and writable ends is interesting. (also much closer to how node works with readable and writable streams)\n\n``` js\nvar source = fs.readStream(\"input.txt\");\nvar sink = fs.writeStream(\"output.txt\");\n\nfunction transform() {\n  return {\n    next: function (callback) { ... },\n    end: function (callback) { ... },\n    consume: function (stream) { ... }\n  }\n}\n\n// Very nice chaining API though\nsink.consume(transform()).consume(source);\n\n```\n\nBut this has issues.  `next` and `end` have no meaning and nothing to pull from until `consume` is called setting up their data source.   To enable chaining, `consume` could return the thing it just consumed.\n\nThe sink will start pulling from the transform before it has a chance to connect to it's source.  This would mean all `next` functions would need an extra state to handle this early call and defer calling the callback.  The nice syntax may or may not be worth this cost. (keep in mind most transforms would already have internal queues, flags and checks.  Adding one more isn't too bad in most cases)\n\n``` js\nvar source = fs.readStream(\"input.txt\");\nvar sink = fs.writeStream(\"output.txt\");\n\nfunction transform(source) {\n  return {\n    next: function (callback) { ... },\n    end: function (callback) { ... }\n  };\n}\n\n// Very simple consuming API\n// note that I'm still expressing the sink as an object even though the transform is just a function.\nsink.consume(transform(source));\n```\n\nIf a transform was modeled as a function that accepted a source and returned a new source, it would be more straightforward.\n\nNow duplex streams (as opposed to transform filters) are modeled great as a single object with `{next, end, consume}` and app logic where symmetry is needed is easy to model.\n\n``` js\nvar jsonCodec = require('json-codec');\nvar lineCodec = require('line-codec');\n\ntcp.createServer(8080, function (socket) {\n  // socket is a \"duplex\" stream with {next, end, consume}\n  // Apply protocol de-framing and framing on the duplex stream\n  socket = lineCodec(socket);\n  // Apply JSON parsing and Serialization to the duplex stream\n  socket = jsonCodec(socket);\n  // App is a simple echo server, so echo objects back\n  socket.consume(socket);\n\n  // or written as a single expression\n  socket.consume(jsonCodec(lineCodec(socket))\n});\n```\n\nBut if we make the TCP library act like a filter itself, then socket is no longer duplex.\n\n``` js\nvar json = require('json-codec');\nvar line = require('line-codec');\n\ntcp.createServer(8080, function (socket) {\n  // Written as a sequence of actions\n  socket = line.deframe(socket);\n  socket = json.decode(socket);\n  socket = app(socket);\n  socket = json.encode(socket);\n  socket = line.frame(socket);\n  return socket;\n\n  // Or written as one expression:\n  return line.frame(json.encode(app(json.decode(line.deframe(socket)))));\n});\n\nfunction app(stream) {\n  // Just an echo server\n  return stream;\n}\n```\n"

Though it's probably better to write transforms as separate encode and decode.  A generic duplex transform that accepted encode and decode would be easy to write.\n\n``` js\nfunction duplex(decode, encode) {\n  return function (original) {\n    var transformed = decode(original);\n    transformed.consume = function (source) {\n      original.consume(encode(source));\n    };\n    return transformed;\n  };\n}\n```\n"

I'm +1 on @Raynos's suggestion.\n- it feels _much_ easier to get right than min-streams.\n- is it the responsibility of the sink to call `.end` on its input stream to allow for cleanup? or is `stream.end()` more exceptional than that?\n- what do we do with extra read callbacks? the [dom example](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/simple-streams-playground/blob/master/dom) has a [filter stream](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/simple-streams-playground/blob/master/dom/lib/filter.js#L47) module that collects a list of callbacks. right now I simply truncate that buffer on `end`, then forward the `end`. is this correct?\n- there's more boilerplate than using `through`, but impressively, not much.\n"

        "body": "> sinks need more of a spec. in particular, I didn't know what how to communicate completion/errors out to client, non-stream code. I'm +1 on @Raynos's suggestion.\n\nIn min-streams, sinks return continuables for exactly this reason.  It's worked out great so far in my js-git code.  The continuable will resolve with the end/error event in the stream.\n\n> it feels much easier to get right than min-streams.\n\nThat's the goal.\n\n> is it the responsibility of the sink to call .end on its input stream to allow for cleanup? or is stream.end() more exceptional than that?\n\nNo, you only call `end` if you want to end the stream early.  Perhaps calling is `end` is confusing with the `end` in node's writable stream interface?\n\n> what do we do with extra read callbacks? the dom example has a filter stream module that collects a list of callbacks. right now I simply truncate that buffer on end, then forward the end. is this correct?\n> there's more boilerplate than using through, but impressively, not much.\n\nAfter sleeping on it, I think it's best to say that calling `.end()` doesn't guarantee the data stream will stop right away.  That adds too much boilerplate and extra code to each and every layer for little gain.  Also I don't think the source needs to insert an end event into the stream when `.end()` is called.  The \"end\" event in the stream is for natural ends.  If a filter in the middle wants to cleanup something it needs to listen for both \"end\" events and the callback to \".end(callback)\" since either could end the stream (and both may happen sometimes).\n\nAs far as truncating callbacks, just make sure to _always_ eventually call every callback.  It really messes up programs when callbacks never get called.\n"

Transforms can be modeled as duplex streams, but I don't feel it properly represents them.\n\nTo me, having only streams be objects is quite symmetrical and clean.  The _only_ basic type here is the stream.  It's the only thing in the spec that everything else has to agree on.  Things like sources, filters (transforms), and sinks are simply functions that either accept or return streams. Push-filters are just an easy way to create normal stream consuming filters and are really not part of the spec.\n- source = function that returns a stream (and accepts optional stream setup arguments)\n- filter = function that accepts a stream and returns a stream (and may have additional option arguments)\n- sink = function that accepts a stream (and returns a continuable)\n"

A string is like a stream, but instead of through time, it's a stream of bytes through memory, but all seen in an instant.  If I wanted to take a string of JSON and transform it into the object that it represents, I don't use an object to do that conversion, I use a function.\n\n``` js\nvar obj = JSON.parse(json);\n```\n\nLikewise if I have a stream of raw json strings through time and want a new stream of parsed objects through time, I would do the same thing.\n\n``` js\nvar objStream = json.decode(jsonStream);\n```\n"

I just don't want to force such a verbose construct in the spec since it's not needed or even wanted most the time.\n\nStructural typing matters more for anonymous things that are passed around and used as return values and arguments all the time.  Streams definitely fall under this category.  Sinks are more like API endpoints that consume streams.  I don't think they need structural typing as much.  I know that `fs.writeStream(stream, path, options) -> continuable` is a sink because of it's API docs, it's name, and it's documented signature.\n"

        "body": "I'm jumping to this little late (& maybe I should not do it at all). But I'll still provide my feedback based of my experience working on streams / signals / channels or whatever you wanna call them.\n1. I think in nature there is just input if you look it from the other side it will be an output. This is to say you don't need sync or duplex, you just need a data type for representing collection of eventual data chunks. Then you can write transformation functions that transforms a -> b. If you want duplex is just pair of same data types where data is pushed from left side to input end and from right side on the output end. `sync` is just a function that's just aware of data type's interface and there for can read data out of it and do whatever it needs to. That's also where `reduce`  functions is somewhat relevant since it takes accumulates state by calling reducer with previous state and a next value.\n2. It took me a while but I got to understand that data types (or shapes if you prefer so)  are a lot more composable. That to say that I dislike `.end`, `.abort` `.close`.  I think stream / signal API does not needs any of these, although it can be added as a sugar if desired. If I'd done it today I'd define stream / signal as simple as this:\n\n``` js\n var stream = {\n   spawn: function(next) {\n     next(1);\n     next(2);\n     next(END);\n   }\n}\n```\n\nWhere `END` is whatever you desire it to be special value, type or shape does not matter as long as it's specified. If streams has an error it can pass them and good thing is JS already has Error type for this.\n\n``` js\n var stream = {\n   spawn: function(next) {\n     next(1);\n     next(2);\n     next(Error(\"oops!\");\n   }\n}\n```\n1. Sync or I'd rather say consumer can have a direct coordination with an input without having to have a hold of it or having a methods like `abort` on every transformation. All it needs to is return value:\n\n``` js\nfunction take(n, input) {\n  return {\n    spawn: function(next) {\n      var left = n;\n      input.spawn(function(value) {\n        return n === 0 ? ABORT : next(value)\n      })\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOf course our input will have to recognize `ABORT` and send back `END`. If `input` does not really recognizes some of this messages we still can wrap it a normalizer to force it to comply, or to the very prevent it's brokenness to  infect\nrest of the pipeline.\n1. Of course we can't talk about streams without back-pressure, but you may have noticed that 3. actually illustrates\n   I/O coordination and back-pressure is just a different form of it. To be more specific consumer can return back data\n   indicating that backpressure should be applied, then respectful source will do that. And if you happen to deal with streams that don't really respect backpressure still not a big deal, cause you can write `buffer(input)` that will respect\n   backpressure and will buffer up input for consumer. I have explored this technique in fs-reduce library where all of the streams respect backpressure, but if you happen to face stream (like array) that does not it will be just buffered up until pressure is released.\n2. I don't think there is any winner in pull VS push type streams, and if there was a one it'll be push since in nature we have events we can't actually pause (users clicking their mice for example). But hey that's not a big deal to since\n   that's just another flavor of I/O coordination all you need to do is make `pull(stream)` which will give you pull based API (maybe that'll match min-stream proposal) and all it will have to do is:\n\n``` js\nfunction pull(stream) {\n  var buffer = [];\n  var reads = [];\n  var resume = function() { stream.spawn(accumulate); }\n\n  function drain() {\n    while (reads.length && buffer.length) reads.shift()(buffer.shift())\n    return buffer.length ? PAUSE : null;\n  }\n\n  function accumulate(value) {\n    // save value and pause stream\n    buffer.push(value);\n    return drain(buffer, reads);\n  }\n\n  // stream will give provide function to resume it.\n  function PAUSE(go) { resume = go }\n\n  return {\n    read: function(callback) {\n      reads.push(callback);\n      drain();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is queue like (imperfect) API it should give an idea how different kind of ones can be easily created in form of simple functions that compose.\n\nThat sums up my opinion on how streams should work based experience of building them for at least 4 times over past few years. I hope this will be helpful and not totally boring and insane. \n"

In my experience I'm much more likely to get it right if I'm using pull-streams than writing the back-pressure by hand using manual pause and resume.\n\nYes there are general helpers that convert between types.  I am publishing a module right now called push-to-pull that lets you write the easier push filters, but use them as back-pressure honoring pull-filters without writing your own queues.  A reduce transform could easily be written as could a filter transform.\n\nThanks for the input.\n"

I really didn't want to.\n\nI've also considered what a stream would look like if we had access to ES6 generators.  I think the simplest construct would be a generator that yielded values.\n\n``` js\nfunction* source() {\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\n  yield 3\n}\n\n// Consume like any other generator to get [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nBut like most I/O streams, you can't yield everything at once, so the generator could yield continuables instead of raw values.\n\nBy happy coincidence, simple-stream's read function is itself a continuable.  So turning a simple-stream into a generator based stream is as simple as:\n\n``` js\nfunction* () {\n  // Create a simple-stream\n  var stream = fs.readStream(\"myfile.txt\");\n  // and yield it forever\n  while (true) yield stream.read\n}\n```\n\nIn fact my [gen-run](https://github.com/creationix/gen-run) library does something very much like this, but as a control-flow helper library.\n\n``` js\nrun(function* () {\n  var stream = fs.readStream(\"myfile.txt\");\n  var data;\n  var items = [];\n  while (data = yield stream.read) {\n    items.push(data);\n  }\n  return items;\n});\n```\n\nI don't want to require generators for streams since it will be a long time before most js environment can assume ES6 generators.  I am, however, very aware of how they will interact and keep these things in mind.\n"

For example you could have something like this folds:\n\nhttps://github.com/Gozala/signalize/blob/master/core.js#L146-L172\n\nThen all the filter map drop etc.. can be easily implemented without concerning self with either error checking or special value handling:\nhttps://github.com/Gozala/signalize/blob/master/core.js#L192-L284\n\n> Yes back-pressure can be done with a manual side-channel and pause and resume commands, but I much prefer the implicit backpressure provided by pull style. In my experience I'm much more likely to get it right if I'm using pull-streams than writing the back-pressure by hand using manual pause and resume.\n\nMain issue with pull is it's inherently solver and you can't apply category theory to optimise transformation pipeline. And of course you can not represent streams that can't be paused or stopped like user events. That is why I prefer to decouple notion of stream from consumption semantics since pull is one of the ways there are more and from case to case you may want different ones. I have started writing some spec for push & pull signals that in best case perform as push and in worst case de-optimize to plain pull & of course any other case in between:\nhttps://gist.github.com/Gozala/5314269  \n\nIt's slightly out of date though\n\n> Yes there are general helpers that convert between types. I am publishing a module right now called push-to-pull that lets you write the easier push filters, but use them as back-pressure honoring pull-filters without writing your own queues. A reduce transform could easily be written as could a filter transform.\n> Thanks for the input.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub (https://github.com/creationix/js-git/issues/17#issuecomment-20392201).\n"

        "body": "@gozalla, I'm having trouble understanding you.  I do like the idea of the main data channel being _only_ data and letting everything else go through a meta channel.\n\nI'm pretty sure I want pull based for several reasons.  Besides the natural back-pressure it provides, it also provides a nice 1:1 mapping between continuations chains since each callback will be called only once for each read call.  This makes tracing and error handling much easier.  I'm currently working on improving domains in node.js and wish that everything in node had this nice 1:1 mapping.  It makes for a very simple and robust system when every stack has a direct and obvious parent stack that initiated it.\n\nI know that you can't pause some inputs easily (like user clicks or http requests), but that doesn't mean pull-streams are a bad idea.  You just buffer the events at the source waiting for someone to pull them.  Even those cases can usually be paused somewhat in extreme cases (you could disable the UI button if the stream wasn't ready to handle it or tell the TCP socket to stop accepting connections)\n\nAlready have two data channels in the form of two arguments to onRead callbacks `(err, item)`.  When `item` is anything other than `undefined`, then it's a data item.  Otherwise, it's a meta value that signifies natural end or error end.  The channel for closing an upstream source goes the other direction and so can't be encoded here.\n\nDo you have any ideas that are modifications to the current design that could simplify this?\n"

        "body": "So, two of the main goals of jsgit are to be lightweight and extremely portable (running on a variety of platforms and storage and network backends).  The C libraries make a lot of assumptions about the platform they run on that make that extremely difficult.  Also many of the C libraries that would be useful to me are GPL or LGPL licensed and I want to keep js-git more open using MIT.\n\nThe main technical problem with enscripten, even if the C libraries were exactly what I needed, is that it generates a _lot_ of javacsript.  I don't want 2mb of generated code.  I want something hand-coded so that it can be a lot leaner.  Remember this is just a library and not an entire application.  It's just a part of someone else's project.\n\nAlso the emscripten toolchain is a pain to setup, especially on platforms like ChromeOS where I expect people to use js-git a lot.  I would really like it if people could hack on js-git on the same platforms that use it.  There is no emscripten (not one that runs at usable speeds at least) in browser-style environments.\n"

I haven't implemented redirect following because url parsing isn't cross-platform yet.

In http redirects it gives the new url as a string, but smart-http works in terms of already parsed urls.\n\nThere is a strict line between what's allowed to be used in js-git proper and what js-git-node-platform can use.  Anything exported by the platform can be used by js-git, but that then means all ports of the platform have to implement that interface as well.\n\nUrlparse is pure javascript.  Maybe we could just include the source from node.js in the browser ports and make it part of the platform interface?\n"

It consumes various simple interfaces and implements git on top of them.\n\nThe node CLI tool is in the `js-git-node` repo with the node version of the various js-git interfaces implemented in the `js-git-node-platform` library.  That way the `js-git` can be used from node without being dependent on the CLI program.\n\nI'm still working on a browser version.\n\nI do apologize that the code has been less organized so far.  I prioritize getting work done over keeping things clean.  Especially when I don't even know what I want most the time.  It is starting to take shake and firming up though.  This is why I announced the project on the node list recently.  It's time for people to start consuming the library through the CLI tool to help iron out bugs and platform issues.  Right now I'm working on creating a small browser based app to test that side of the abstraction.\n"

Network communication is a little trickier.  For clone/fetch/ls-remote the platform needs to provide tcp, http, and/or ssh interfaces (depending on which protocols you want to support).\n\nIf you want to use the built-in fs-db library, then you do need inflate/deflate/sha1 as well as an fs instance.\n\nIf you want to have a working directory, you need to provide an fs instance as part of the git-db interface.  You don't have to use the fs-db adapter library.  You could do this with only indexdb by emulating the fs on top of the indexdb system, but using indexdb directly for the git-db implementation.\n"

        "body": "Thanks for writing this up.  I very much value use cases to know which direction to prioritize.  This can be `milestone #4` if that's soon enough (a few months out). Right now I'm working super hard to finish `milestone #1` since that alone will be enough for many people's use cases.  A large part of this work is creating packfiles which is currently part of `milestone #2`.\n\nOne comment on ssh.  It's probably best to reuse the existing ssh server in servers.  That's how real git works.  What I would be re-implementing is the various shell commands that get spawned.  These mini processes would then need to connect to the main git server process and talk to it on the client's behalf.\n\nNow it would be more efficient if node was also also the ssh server and only understood git commands.  But then your server wouldn't have an ssh server for remote logins anymore (unless node handled that too).\n\nAlso I would like to keep a js-git powered client as a separate task as a js-git powered server.  Your use case may require both ends to be node powered, but many others do not.\n"

        "body": "The thing is that browsers on their own are incapable of talking to most git servers.  Browsers only support websockets and HTTP.  Most git hosts support HTTP, but they don't implement CORS.  So unless your website is hosted _on_ github itself, you won't be able to talk to it using XHR.  The browser's domain security restrictions will deny the connection.\n\nI've asked Github to enable CORS on their http git endpoints, They told me they were reviewing the security implications and I haven't heard back from them.\n\nThe reason there isn't a single browser-ready version of js-git is because there is no clear-cut configuration that works for everyone.  Every platform and use case is unique.  There are literally hundreds of configurations that I've seen people and platforms need.\n\nNow github does have CORS on their other HTTP APIs.  You can use those, but they aren't git protocol and aren't supported by js-git.\n"

        "body": "Correct, there is no built-in index in js-git.  But manually creating a commit and a tree is quite simple.\n\nOne example is an old tool I wrote that scrapes a http based database, extracts the sqlite contents, parses the html and json and writes json files to a tree structure.  The goal was to run in on a schedule and create commits whenever the root tree changed. https://github.com/creationix/gospel-git-library\n\nFor some simpler code that shows how to create commits, the examples folder in js-git is a good place. https://github.com/creationix/js-git/blob/master/examples/create.js\n\nAlso I recently wrote a simple tool that imports trees from a filesystem and gives you back the root hash of the imported data. https://github.com/creationix/giblush/blob/master/importfs.js\n\nWith all the techniques, the basic idea is the same.  You import some data into the git database.  Eventually you'll have the hash to the root tree of your new data.  You then create a new commit who's parent is the last commit and who's tree is the tree.  After you create this commit, you move the relevant head ref to point to it. https://github.com/creationix/js-git/blob/master/examples/create.js#L51-L55\n\nI hope this helps.\n"

I used a combination of https://github.com/creationix/js-git/blob/master/examples/create.js (which I had already looked at) and https://github.com/creationix/giblush/blob/master/importfs.js. One problem I ran into with `importfs.js`, is that I was creating git repo in the same directory that I was traversing. Took me a little bit to figure out what was going on. The git repo was itself being included with the commit. Not sure if this will affect what you're doing, but if so, you may want to filter out '.git' directories as I did.\nThanks again.\n"

This means that a browser can never clone from github because the browser will disallow XHR requests to the domain.\nThey do, however, offer a REST interface to the raw git data.\nUsing this I wrote a mixin for js-git that uses github as the backend store.\nI am trying to understand if the lack of CORS support is limiting, if you are able to use the raw git data API. I guess this just necessitates the js-github adapter as opposed to using the normal git communication mechanisms. is it otherwise feature complete? Does this include pushing commits back to github?\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.=\n"

        "body": "Actually, diff is not part of git core.  The internal database stores the full version of every file and folder in the history.  The way that git keeps from exploding in size is via packfiles.  js-git doesn't yet support writing packfiles, but it can read them.  Yes packfiles use some form of binary diff internally, but this data is useless for the kind of diff you want to calculate.\n\nSo using one of the filesystem backends to js-git (https://github.com/creationix/git-node-fs for example), you can mount an existing git repo and read it using js-git.  Then using this, you can walk the graph manually using the low-level `.loadAs(type, hash)` api.  Also I provide a couple of higher-level APIs via the walker mixin (https://github.com/creationix/js-git/blob/master/mixins/walkers.js).  `logWalk` lets you walk the history as a flattened linear list of commits (sortes the branches by date).  The `treeWalk` walks the trees and blobs of a commit letting you do a depth first traversal of the tree as a linear stream.\n\nI'm afraid you'll have to manually track the committer and calculate diffs on your own.  I haven't implemented this logic yet.  It might be easier to find some libgit2 bindings for node that I assume would provide the backends to commands like git blame.\n\nSo, yes, js-git can give you the raw data about commits, history, files, contents, etc, but won't calculate composite information like diff, blame, per-file history, etc.\n"

        "body": "Let me work backwards from where I am today.  It's been a couple years since I've worked on the original js-git.  I recently ported lua-git to use duktape javascript and an example can be found at https://github.com/creationix/dukgit/blob/master/test.js#L58-L64\n\n``` js\n  db = mount(\".git\");\n  var queue = [\"HEAD\"];\n  while (queue.length) {\n    var commit = db.loadAs(\"commit\", queue.shift());\n    p(commit);\n    queue.push.apply(queue, commit.parents);\n  }\n```\n\nBut this does require duktape coroutines which will not work in any other JavaScript VM.  Once async/await lands I can port to that pretty easily.\n\nThe lua-git has a similar API at https://github.com/creationix/lua-git/.\n\nJS-Git was my first API in this regard and is _very_ modular because of the unique constraints I was trying to solve.  The README for https://github.com/creationix/git-node-fs is the simplest way to get started with js-git and node.  Use that to mount a repo.\n\n``` js\nvar repo = {};\nvar path = path.join(\"some/bare/repo.git\");\nrequire('git-node-fs/mixins/fs-db')(repo, path);\n```\n\nOnce you have a repo, loading commits and walking them is pretty easy using direct `repo.loadAs(...)` calls like I do in dukgit. https://github.com/creationix/js-git#basic-object-loading\n\nBut there are also helpers for some common tasks like iterating the history or a file tree as a linear list. \n\nhttps://github.com/creationix/js-git#using-walkers\n\nSo a complete example showing how to walk history and files would be:\n\n``` js\nvar path = require('path');\nvar run = require('gen-run');\n\n// use gen-run to block on contunuables (mini promises) using ES6 yield.\nrun(function*() {\n  // Create a repo object\n  var repo = {};\n  // Mixin the base DB operations using local git database on disk.\n  require('git-node-fs/mixins/fs-db')(repo, path.resolve(__dirname, \"../.git\"));\n  // Mixin the walker helpers.\n  require('js-git/mixins/walkers')(repo);\n\n  // Look up the hash that master currently points to.\n  var commitHash = yield repo.readRef(\"master\");\n\n  // Create a log stream\n  var logStream = yield repo.logWalk(commitHash);\n\n  // Looping through the stream is easy by repeatedly waiting on `read`.\n  var commit, object;\n  while ((commit = yield logStream.read())) {\n\n    console.log(commit);\n\n    // We can also loop through all the files of each commit version.\n    var treeStream = yield repo.treeWalk(commit.tree);\n    while ((object = yield treeStream.read())) {\n      console.log(object);\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n"

I really appreciate you providing a list to resources and the example (plus, I'm a big fan of your work and podcast appearances!).\n\nI think that my problem is that the API is that it is very low level so there a gap between what I want to do and knowing how to do it. I would really like to find examples of performing common operations like [here](https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit/tree/master/examples) but for js-git.\n\nBecause I do not understand the structure of a git repo or how to use git at a low level (I've used a small number of CLI commands and GUI tools), it makes me feel like I have three options for using js-git:\n\n1) first port a higher level API (like nodegit) to use js-git as the driver - this way I can study how they walk things and perform operations \n\n2) find someone to port the [nodegit examples](https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit/tree/master/examples) to js-git\n\n3) find a programming guide to using git - I'm not sure if there is a reference that someone can recommend, but it would basically be a cookbook to perform common operations (eg. checking status, etc) \n\nI guess I just need help connecting the dots between the low level API and what I would like to accomplish.\n"

        "body": "Currently js-git is basically just git core, this is simple and you can learn it very quickly.  There are 4 kinds of objects, they are commit, tag, tree, and blob.  Tags are used for annotated tags.  You'll find them used by some projects for release tags.  The tag ref will point to a tag object instead of a commit object.  The tag will contain metadata about the release and link to the commit.\n\nhttps://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects\n\nCommits point to a tree object and zero or more parent commits (merge commits typically have two parents, but there can be more!).  They also have extra metadata like tags do.\n\nA tree contains a list of pointers to other trees, blobs, or commits (submodules).  Each entry will have a name, mode, and hash.\n\nA blob is just raw binary data.\n\nSo using `repo.loadAs` you can manually walk the tree looking for things.\n\nJS-git doesn't have support for the working directory so you can't do things like `git status`.  Also I haven't implemented diff yet so anything involving that can't be done including merges.  The network actions like push and pull aren't done either.  The main thing you can do currently with js-git is read/write the core git database directly.\n"

My current limitation is time since any time I spend on js-git will take away from time with my children.  That said, there are some nights I can't sleep because of a mild sleep disorder and I will often work on stuff while they sleep.\n\nAs far as technical direction, I learned a lot from the failure, that was the js-git fundraiser.  My goals were too ambitious and the browser tech wasn't ready for what I was trying to make.\n\nToday, we have async/await coming soon and transpilers that let you use it now.  Also with service workers coming along we have much better offline support.\n\nAs far as I know, browsers still have no way to make direct TCP connections (for git://) to git servers and no git hosting company has added CORS headers to their smart-https (https://) endpoints.  I've designed a great websocket based git protocol (wss://) that can be easily deployed if you host your own git repos or could be setup as a proxy to other git servers and would love if it became used eventually by hosting services like Github.\n\nInitially I focussed on browser-based apps using only native browser I/O and direct connections to services (which is still impossible), but if we relax the requirements a little and allow proxies for browser apps, custom hosted git services, or node.js or chrome app clients, then the network constraints are no longer an issue.\n"

It is great that the passing of time is helping address some technical issues (like async/await).\n\nI'm working on a project with electron so focussing on the node.js ecosystem would be a good scope for my needs. I need to basically write a git client so diff, status, remote sync, etc are on my needs list. I also played around with the browser, but because my project's main, initial use case is the user's hard drive, I am fine to deprioritize the browser for now (but want to leave the door open for it which is why js-git is so appealing!).\n\nLoosening the requirements to proxy git requests is a fine compromise although I'm not sure if it puts other limits around git over SSH, for example. Unfortunately, my knowledge is a bit shallow on network and protocol considerations so I cannot add much there. \n"

I've implemented HTTP in pure js and lua multiple times, that isn't hard, especially for the reduced use case of git clones.\n\nThere is a pure js implementation of tls that I've been using at https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge, also I've been recently discovered https://tls.mbed.org/ which can probably be compiled to JS using emscripten.  My experience with emscripten, however, is that it generates massive JS blobs (hence the primary motivator for web assembly).\n\nI believe that implementing enough of ssh to do a git clone over it isn't that bad.  Also on the node side, you have the openssl bindings available and can use something like https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2.\n"

        "body": "@Dashed last night I looked into implementing status with js-git (again still in an experimental way).\n\nIt looks like it is implemented like:\n\n1) resolve the HEAD reference to an actual reference commit hash and collect the entries of type blob\n2) traverse the filesystem in a way that ignores the .git folder and respects .gitignore to collect the hashes for each file\n3) compare the results of 1) and 2) in two ways: a) by path looking for hash changes, b) by hash looking for renamed paths.\n\nAlso, I think there could be come caching in there to reduce rehashing checks based on modification checks.\n\nThe problem I immediately run into is that js-git's mixins virtualize git but do not virtualize the file system so writing a general-purpose implementation would require API additions. It makes sense that you would want to virtualize git so you do not need to emulate a filesystem-like interface into each type of storage, but then it seems like you might want to virtualize the filesystem anyway to implement things like status. \n\n@creationix two ways to implement this come to mind: \n\n1) virtualize the filesystem and rewrite all of the mixins to the new interface - I'm assuming that you probably think this is a little crazy given the benefits of virtualizing different types of storage methods and work that has been done to date. This is the path I've personally been experimenting with by emulating Node's fs module for a memory representation, eg. virtual file system.\n\n2) add some sort of interface like walking the filesystem - it would need to respect .gitignore and I've found a module [gitignore-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitignore-parser) that helps with testing files.\n\n@creationix given that you've written a bunch of drivers for different git implementations, with your current state of knowledge and ignoring sunk costs f what you have already implemented, what do you think is the better approach...extending the storage driver mixin APIs, emulating the filesystem, or something else? (since it seems like a slippery slope in any approach)\n\nAlso, it looks like .git/HEAD stores the working directory so in the filesystem case, it isn't a barrier to the implementation although maybe the problem is that you are referring to is a general purpose solution would need to extend the storage driver mixin API to store and modify those values and eventually the refspecs.\n\nI'm very much still climbing the git learning curve so I might have got some things wrong here!\n"

I realize that it is a little controversial for me to ask about abstracting in a different way (eg. by file system), but I'm on the edge of deciding what to do and would like to get your opinion since you have already thought about this and can foresee things that I'll encounter the hard way!\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1) how would you abstract traversing the file tree to check the hashes for each file?\n2) how would you abstract concepts like the working directory in HEAD, refspecs in config, etc? \n\nI guess I'm thinking that by abstracting by filesystem instead of git concepts allows filesystem drivers to be developed and tested like black-boxes, and allow for one codebase to do all of the above like updating HEAD rather than the other way around. I definitely see the benefits of both, but would like to hear your take on how you would approach it in the current API as the feature set increases.\n\nThank you!\n"

In this case, there will be something for working checkouts and it only needs to know if a file has changed, the git index format on disk is an implementation detail of one of the backends.  But many platforms can offer a good FS level implementation and for those, it would be good for js-git to bridge the gap between fs and working directory for you.\n\nI already do this with git-fs which implements the js-git database interface on top of a generic file system interface.  You don't have to use git-fs if you're on some strange platform where it doesn't make sense.\n\nFor example, I had a backend that stored objects and refs in indexeddb in the browser without first emulating a filesystem.  That would be unneeded overhead and complexity.\n\nSo to answer your question, the git-fs module needs to implement the needed high-level APIs for doing status, add, checkout and other working directory commands.  We also need to design what exactly those APIs are, but not hard-code them to the filesystem.  Users of js-git will be able to choose implementing the high-level interface directly or just implementing the low-level fs API and using git-fs to bridge the interface gap.\n"

I'm sort of used to just using higher level abstractions like `sort`, `limit`, `offset`, `pick` `values`, `in` that dealing with traversing data structures directly seems like a lot of detail to be thinking about. Digression over. \n\nI found https://github.com/creationix/git-fs-db. It this looks like a database-like interface into the filesystem. I think `git-fs-db` is the one you are referring to by `git-fs` above. Also, I found https://github.com/creationix/git-chrome-local-db which seems to have a similar interface so I think this is the `backend that stored objects and refs in indexeddb in the browser without first emulating a filesystem` example.\n\nHowever, I'm missing the piece that actually uses the higher-level interface since these modules look more like drivers to be consumed somewhere else. I've looked in https://github.com/creationix/js-git/tree/master/mixins and in some of your repositories to the module that uses them.\n"

You might have a better time wrapping the continuable instead of using the callback interface.\n\nFor example, make a function that converts continuables to full promises.\n\n``` js\nfunction c2p(fn) {\n  return new Promise(function (reject, resolve) {\n    return fn(function (err, result) {\n      if (err) { return reject(err); }\n      return resolve(result);\n    };\n  };\n}\n```\n\nThen you can do:\n\n``` js\nvar result = await c2p(logStream.read());\n```\n"

I read some tickets related to https/ssh, etc, and it seems currently there is no way to do that? or would this one be helpful? https://github.com/aluzzardi/wssh I know the js-github has some workaround, but which does not works with bitbucket, I would like to support use bitbucket for its free private repo reason. so is it possible use the wssh or something like that to do with ssh git repos like bitbucket and github ones?\n"

This works great for cloning public resources that don't need a password, but is a problem for private repos or pushing commits.  My plan eventually was to use the forge project to implement TLS in the browser.  I've already implemented HTTP in JS a few times.\n\nThe other problem with a proxy is the wasted network resources and dependence on new infrastructure.\n\nThe ideal solution would be for the git providers to simply add CORS headers, but I've been asking for years.

I checked the google dev doc, it seems as long as the target hosts were added into the permissions part of of manifest.json, google will allow extension use xhr to access those hosts. so maybe the CORS adjust in https://github.com/creationix/corson will be not required?\n\nthen if this HTTPS way works, I can connect to github or bitbucket, though I have to use user's password to get it authed. And I still do not know how to connect to https git endpoint with js-git, specially in chrome extension, is there any example code for it? it's really pieces everywhere and I do not have idea how to put them together.\n\nOn the other hand, I agree with you that the proxy has security problem. but if the proxy is hosted by the user own, e.g. by an heroku click to deploy button with source code, then they can trust the proxy, the only problem is how to auth with github/bitbucket ssh git together with the proxy. if this can be done, we can work with github/bitbucket private repos with low risk for any users, at least before the browser side TLS implemented.\n\nWhat do you think, is this worth a try?\n"

        "body": "Correct, if you're making the XHR calls from your extension you can just request cross-domain permission in the manifest.  My use case was an extension that can be enabled on a per-site basis by the user that bypasses the CORS restrictions.  To simulate what would happen if the providers had added it themselves.\n\nYou don't need the user's password to auth with HTTPS, I'm pretty sure github at least will allow user tokens which can be managed the same as ssh keys.  I'm not sure about bitbucket though.\n\nAs far as actually doing git over xhr, I never completed that with js-git since I hit the hard technical roadblocks with lack of CORS.  I had a prototype of cloning, but never did pushing.\n\nThat said, there are a couple other git in JS implementations out there that use xhr in chrome apps and extensions with the requested domain exception.  You'll see mention of them in the issue I linked at bitbucket.  I think everyone is using the library written for Taylor.\n\nYou could do an SSH to Websocket proxy where the user deploys their own proxy and embeds their private key in it.  That would work well.  Then the only problem is authenticating the browser so that not just anyone can access it.  But any authentication scheme will work, even http basic auth.  It's up to the dev deploying the proxy and implementing the website.  They would need `wss://` and not plain `ws://` on the proxy or whatever they are using to authenticate would be leaked to anyone listening.  This means deploying with an SSL/TLS cert.\n"

(https://github.com/creationix/js-git/blob/master/mixins/pack-ops.js#L129 ) This puts the onRead callback on the readQueue in culvert (https://github.com/creationix/culvert/blob/master/channel.js#L59 ). However the readQueue will not be touched until someone adds some new data to the stream (which won't happen because all data was already pushed to the stream). \n\nIt looks like I need to add a method to culvert to close a channel right? and then have the users of culvert use that method. @creationix is that correct?\n"

The only thing it doesn't have is fs.watch and I'm already working on an implementation of that."

One downside, no browser support yet because of rollup issues.\n\nStory of my life! Something should make a service that scans Github and autodetects similar projects. FYI BrowserFS has fairly good emscripten support. I don't think it has virtual character devices, but it is fairly extensible. Once you get past the TypeScript (ugh) it's not hard to work in. I recently upgraded the XHR backend to use window. fetch, and am planning to add a window.caches backend that should support much larger files than local storage or indexed db backends. There's a key/value store interface that makes it possible to implement a new fs backend on top of any key value store interface, but since window.caches supports streaming, the author may want to take advantage of that and do something more ambitious than treating it as a kv store.\n\nGood luck getting libgit2 to run in emscripten! I absolutely agree, there is room for many many implementations. I'm focusing on a file system based implementation rather than using an in memory or indexed db approach, and focusing on replicating the file system behavior of the git CLI so I can use it interchangeably to manipulate repos on my desktop."

I found a way to do this though, and have to refactor the virtualfs a bit a support some extra stuff (that I mentioned above) to make this monkeypatching work.\r\n\r\nI'm also focused on a filesystem focus of git, because I need the concept of a \"working\" directory and staging changes, thus the virtualfs requirement and needing the monkeypatch the emscripten rootfs mounting. It's also because libgit2 isn't going to be the only module interacting with the fs, I intend to get the other libraries like node tar and monkeypatch their fs reference such that I can archive the in-memory fs implementation.\r\n\r\nOther than that, the actual translation of libgit2 to JS is not difficult and is already working. https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/4902"

I've tried to distinguish it from js-git and es-git (and gitkit, and js-virtual-git) by creating a high-level API that's more like the git CLI, and focusing on interoperability with the `.git` directory structure so it works with repos on the desktop too. The commands still left to implement before 1.0 are git log and git merge, but the rest (clone, init, fetch, push, add, remove, commit, status, checkout) are all there: https://github.com/wmhilton/isomorphic-git"

And you'll get proper code-completion as you develop.\r\n\r\nAnd you'll be able to better restrict the input/output of each part of your program using `interface`s.\r\n\r\nFinally it's nice to be able to use all the latest ES* features that aren't supported by many browsers. Then TypeScript can just compile it down to an older JavaScript version.\r\n\r\nBut yes, obviously it's up to you. I'm not planning on maintaining a TypeScript fork of your project."
