Currently some words are used before they are defined, and when you get to the definition there's a lot of information around there that the user doesn't really have to know when starting out with the Flight framework. It took me about three reads to clearly understand the general concept.\n\nWe would also appreciate it if the example had comments that explain what the code does.\n"

        "body": "Hi Angus,\n\nThanks for your quick reply.\nI thought of this solution too before of course, but it doesn't satisfy me so much unfortunately.\nI would say it's more a workaround.\n\nAs I was saying I was looking for a solution without passing anything from one component to another (either using options or the DOM).\n\nHere I feel like we are tightly coupling the 2 modules together from their definition already (as we are defining an option in Block, defining which menu should control it).\n\nIdeally, components should trigger events and not know who's dealing with them later on.\nAny component instances should be able to listen to any specific events.\n\n**How about the following implementation?**\n\nI noticed that the call to `attachTo`doesn't return anything. What if it returned the instance of the component? Then you could setup the listener outside the Component definition (ie. after it's been instantiated) like that:\n\n```\nvar menu1 = Menu.attachTo('#menu1');\nvar menu2 = Menu.attachTo('#menu2');\nvar block1 = Block.attachTo('#block1');\nvar block2 = Block.attachTo('#block2');\n\nmenu1.on('menuItemClicked', function(){ block1.changeColor('red'); });\nmenu2.on('menuItemClicked', function(){ block2.changeColor('blue'); });\n```\n\nLet me know what you think of this or if you have another more elegant solution?\n\nThanks!\n"

        "body": "I take your point about the coupling implications of being told to listen to events on specific DOM node - but I feel that returning a component as a handle so that it's methods can be invoked externally is a much tighter coupling. Once you make a component API available to the outside world the component is no longer isolated and you are inviting a ratcheting up of complexity.\n\nAlso bear in mind I am not suggesting listening to events from a specific component - just listening to any event emanating from a DOM node. It could originate from one of many components, or it could be a native DOM event - we don't care and we don't need to know.\n\nI don't know your DOM structure - but I'd also suggest you don't need to listen to the menu element specifically - as long as you listen on any DOM node that events from the other menu will not bubble up to.\n\nAlternatively (and perhaps most simply) just have the second menu trigger a different event name from the first menu.\n"

I've installed bower without cygwin on Windows 7. \n\nHowever, es5-shim uses a symbolic link for it's component.json file in bower (to point to the `package.json`, to    avoid having to maintain both).  This symbolic link will likely cause a bower installation of Flight to fail.  \n\nLuckily I found a workaround, if you create a `.bowerrc` file and add `{ \"json\":\"package.json\" }` to it you can install  Flight without any problem.\n\n2) There's nothing to stop you from using jQuery hosted anywhere, or any local copy you might have.  You specific the jQuery script reference manually in your HTML page or requirejs config.  You could always use the bower-installed copy as a local fallback.\n"

        "body": "Hi Angus,\n\nThank you for the fast feedback. I think your suggestion works when the input element is already attached to the root node of the component. In my situation these input elements are being attached dynamically after the binding happens.\n\nThe reason I used bind on the callback with `this.$node.on` was because `on` in this situation comes from jQuery and I was loosing component context.\n\nSorry for taking your time on this. I think I will try to create a demo somewhere so it will be easier to illustrate my problem.\n"

Instead we want `withPositioning` to be mixed into whatever `withDialog` is being mixed into - which is represented by `this`, i.e. the context in which `withDialog` is being invoked.\n\nBy way of example, imagine we have a Component type called `TweetBox` which is defined by mixing the core `tweetBox` function with the mixin `withDialog`: \n\n```\ndefineComponent(tweetBox, withDialog);\n\nfunction tweetBox() {//... \n```\n\nSo now when `withDialog` is being invoked using the original code you cited above, `this` is `TweetBox.prototype` and that's what both `withDialog` and `withPosition` will be mixed into.\n\nHope this helps. It probably sounds confusing in words, but once you play with the code it should become apparent. Please look at the [demoApp source code](https://github.com/twitter/flight/tree/gh-pages/demo) for more examples.\n"

        "body": "Yes, that answered my question I think. Thank you. So, @mkuklis, it appears my suspicions were correct then unless the todomvc is a bad example. Instead of having components that reference a model (i.e. each to do item is a todo UI component that references a todo model) and the UI components have event handlers on them, you have event handlers on DOM elements that sift through the DOM for data properties. From the example:\n\n``` js\nthis.requestRemove = function (e, data) {\n  var id = $(data.el).attr('id').split('_')[1];\n  this.trigger('uiRemoveRequested', { id: id });\n}\n```\n\nI'd like to have it like:\n\n``` js\nthis.requestRemove = function (e, data) {\n  this.trigger('uiRemoveRequested', { id: this.id });\n}\n```\n\nPersonally I prefer to keep data out of the DOM. I've found that's made things to be a headache to refactor and change in the future. In the 2nd example the DOM can be freely changed (or completely removed for that matter) and it'd still work. But, as a I said, maybe this is a bad example?\n"

I think it means you would need multiple instances of the TodoUI component (one per todo) like you suggested.   \n\nI've started experimenting with the idea of the [asComponent](https://gist.github.com/mkuklis/5002179) mixin with  a default set of CRUD event types which could be used with different data providers (localStorage, xhr etc). There could be potentially another mixin on the view side of things to bind to these events. I'm not sure if this is a good idea yet but I will see where this will take me.\n"

At this point the jQuery dependency is no longer the main obstacle.\n\nThe following is beyond the scope of this pull request, but I'm going to mention it anyway in case any Flight developers are interested in sorting this out. The problem now is the usage of the \"window\" global variable, which is obviously not defined in Node's runtime environment. When I try to instantiate my UI component, I get the following error:\n\n```\nReferenceError: window is not defined\n    at Component.trigger (/home/h2s/src/tdd-flight/components/flight/lib/component.js:65:13)\n```\n\nWith that, I think we enter full-blown refactor territory in terms of supporting Node execution.

The normal way to do this is to have base methods in the component and decorators in the mixin. So for example:\n\ncomponent\n\n```\nthis.render = function(ev,data) {\n  //base render functionality\n}\n```\n\nmixin\n\n```\nthis.after('render', function(ev,data) {\n  //extra decoration specific to the mixin\n});\n\nthis.after('initialize', function() {\n  //...\n  this.render(); //invokes render, including mixin's decoration\n}\n```\n\nHowever if the base `render` method does everything you want you don't need a decorator in the mixin. Also FWIW, if you had a decorator without a base `render` method it would still work - the decorator would, in this case, become the base `render` method\n\n(re-opening issue for a while as a general FYI)\n"

When you do \n\n```\ndefineComponent(terminalComponent, withMemDB, withTemplate, withMedia);\n```\n\nthis creates one component containing all functions from all mixins. For your example to work it doesn't even matter which order the mixins are added (although they are, in fact, added in the order specified) because `initialize` is not called until you create an instance of the component (using `attachTo`)\n\nCan you post a simplified version of where you are defining the component and where you are doing `attachTo`? Thanks.\n\n(by the way you don't need to assign `this` to `self` in the `initialize` method)\n"

But I'm not really concerned about performance in either case. It's just not called often enough for 100,000 times per second to be considered a concern.\n\nIt would be nice if flight were decoupled from jQuery, but that is a huge project and this change would be the tip of the iceberg (actually that test might no longer even be required if we had no jQuery) \n"

        "body": "@angus-c Thanks for the explanation!\n\nAs for developer intention, I think the way you've defined the semantics of `#defaultAttr` is really clear, and there isn't any guesswork necessary; the rule is that the base `attr` always wins.  If an attribute has already been provided (when the component was instantiated, by the component itself, or by another mixin), then no need to use the default.  From the readme:\n\n```\nThe defaultAttr method is available to both component and mixin modules.\nWhen used with mixins it will not overwrite attributes already defined in the component module.\n```\n\nBy throwing an exception instead, it forces mixin authors to choose whether they want to define defaults themselves or allow consuming components to define their own defaults.\n\nYeah, if the mixin defines a default that accidentally collides with a component or other mixin, it would definitely be a problem.  But I think the ordering there is backwards for normal development.  If I'm writing a component and I want to use a mixin, I need to see which attributes that mixin uses so that I can pass arguments to it and so I can avoid name collisions.  Right now, I can't see that in the `with_select` mixin other than reading through the function bodies.  Allowing `defaultAttr` in mixins would make that a bit better.\n\nSince you've written substantially more Flight code than I have, I'm sure you have much better perspective here and I'm thankful to hear how you think about it.  :)\n"

I've fixed this with https://github.com/twitter/flight/pull/90\n\nTo get logging to show up, the client app needs to enable debugging and mix logging into the registry. (In hindsight this may be asking a bit much of the client app - we should consider automating the second part if `debug.enable` is `true`). For example here's how its done in our demo app (https://github.com/twitter/flight/blob/gh-pages/demo/index.html)\n\n```\nfunction(compose, registry, advice, withLogging, debug) {\n  debug.enable(true);\n  compose.mixin(registry, [advice.withAdvice, withLogging]); \n  //.. \n }\n```\n\nThe next step is to persist user logging level requests with localStorage so that they endure beyond the current page\n"

The ComponentInitializer will search for uninitialized Flight components within a given DOM node, and initializes them automatically.\n\nBut before the components are initialized, I want to trigger a \"before initialization event\" so that other (existing) components have the ability to process/modify the DOM node (the context) before the Flight components within it are initialized. Because of this, I need to send the node together with the \"ComponentInitializer:beforeInitializeContext\" event like this:\n\nthis.trigger('ComponentInitializer:beforeInitializeContext', { context: context });\n\nUnfortunately, Flight throws an error because the context property (the DOM node) is not serializable. Would this be a valid use case or am I moving in the wrong direction?\n"

On Chrome for instance it uses `MessageChannel`, which in ad-hoc testing adds delay of less than 1ms.\n"

When we call this.on in flight it does make a new handler function rather than just use this.resize every time in order to bind to the component instance so Im not sure why this.off, if passed the function instance, doesn't unbind.  Perhaps we are handling the function reference wrongly.\n\nEither way, I think we do need to re-open this issue but I either can't or can't find the button to re-open it. @angus-c  can you re-open this?\n"

        "body": "### Personal thoughts about Flight Docs++\n\nFor what I understand the idea is to eventually move docs to a webpage, right? \n\nHere are some things that I like about the docs of other JS frameworks/libraries.\n\n#### Backbone [docs](http://backbonejs.org/)\n- It is super simple. There are no subpages.\n- There is only one level of submenus in the sidebar. \n- Descriptions of methods are generally not longer than one paragraph.\n- A play button to execute the snippet of code.\n\n#### Angular [docs](http://docs.angularjs.org/api)\n- Has a complete playable and editable example of each part of the API.\n- Every part of the API has an \"Improve this doc\" button\n- There is an individual DISQUS thread for each section.\n- I find their sidebar to be super complicated to understand :(\n\n#### jQuery [docs](http://api.jquery.com/)\n- jQuery docs are quite complete but there is something that I **hate**, whenever you are navigating through the API menu and click on a method API it does a full reload of the page which makes it feel like a pretty heavy action instead of inviting you to surf and click. :(\n\n#### Mocha [docs](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/)\n- For some reason I love the minimalistic look of it. Feels really clean and well organized.\n- Even though it is nicely organized it lack of a way to navigate in the page so it is a bit difficult to have a see the full picture. :(\n\n#### Jasmine [docs](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine)\n- I feel almost the exact same way as with Mocha.\n- It is awesome that every section has \"permalinkable\" icon for easy reference and sharing. This a really nice touch, making it easy to share and bookmark without sacrificing simplicity.\n\nThoughts?\n"

On one hand, I agree that top-of-file is much more maintainable, but the downside is those directives then apply to the whole file which isn't always what you want.\n\nI feel like `validthis` and `eqnull` might better be defined globally in .jshintrc. `newcap` and `-W058` are special, and we don't necessarily want them to be global, or even file scope.\n\nI tried to strike a reasonable balance, but I only took a stab. I'm not entirely sure what the \"right\" solution is, which is why I opened the PR to get things going.\n"

Similarly a var at the component level is available via closure scope to every instance. \n\nHowever `this` within a function refers only to the current instance, so typically you would declare an instance specific property in the initialize method:\n\ne.g.\n\n``` js\n  this.after('initialize', function() {\n    this.x = 'blah';\n    //...\n  });\n```\n\nthe property x will then be available to any component method and is instance specific.\n\nHope this helps.\n"

Obviously we need a neat, native working solution.\nI'll see if I can come up with a fix next week when I'll be back from vacations.\n\nCheers\nG.\n"

In fact isn't it cleaner to remove all handlers in one go at teardown?\n\nMoreover your solution is incomplete, we'd also need to add `one` advice methods to registry and logger. IMO keeping all binding in a single API (`on`) causes less confusion all around and keeps our codebase small. Also `one` and `once` are both very unintuitive names for an event binder - they don't suggest binding at all (just because jQuery did it doesn't make it right) \n\nLet's try and keep our API simple. The following is intuitive and adds nothing to our core code base (other than a reusable util)...\n\n`this.on('click', utils.once(myHandler))` \n"

Afaik, we're only passing an object to attachTo in a few places and from a quick scan of the code, the attributes are defined in most places.\n\nOne thing I'd like to add to this discussion: a misconception I had when starting with Flight was that the component function was run once per instance at attach time. That meant I did things like:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.defaultAttrs({\n  rifftumbles: []\n});\n\nthis.somethingGood = function () {\n  this.attr.rifftumbles.push({\n    beep: 'boop'\n  });\n};\n```\n\nOf course, then the `rifftumbles` are shared between instances of the component.\n\nMy question then is: should instance-specific state go in `instance.attr`? If so, is there a possible  syntax that avoids this kind of thing?\n\nThis seems to verbose, not to mention the redundant static data it would produce.\n\n``` javascript\nthis.attributes(function () {\n  return {\n    boopSelector: '.boop',\n    rifftumbles: []\n  };\n});\n```\n"

If we unbound both events in the first `off`, the second `off` would be left high and dry with nothing to do. Moreover there would be a danger of unbinding callbacks bound to other elements (but the same instance) even when such unbindings had not been requested.\n\n> > I'm also interested: could we not have iterated on my PR (with the big commit message + explanation) to this?\n\nWe could have iterated on your PR but the emphasis was different, yours was entirely focused on registry.js, this one is focused on base.js \n"

So if Flight depends on jQuery events it could probably use just jQuery's events module. And the jQuery DOM things could even be made optional.\n\nGood point about `$.noConflict`, @webpro \n"

        "body": "Thanks - the challenge with @angus-c 's solution is that I _do_ pass things into attachTo.\n\nWhen I bootstrap a data component, I'm passing it's initial data through attachTo, which should set the defaultAttrs fields.\n\nAdding a variable as 'var foo' at the top - was something I initially tried as well - but I don't think it works?!?! It is what I'd think might work. But I think the flight component definition function is only run once, so it doesn't make a copy for each instance.  Every instance shares the same variables.  That was my _other_ solution, to use vars and wrap the entire component definition function in another function.  But that just started to feel a bit nutzo :)\n\nI extended the fiddle to do this and var, and the this method is the only one that works.\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/dBM6K/4/\n\nI value keeping all the variables in one place (helpful on a team), and don't want to have to write code to copy things like:\n\n``` javascript\n  if (this.attr.bootstrap_list){ \n    this.list = this.attr.bootstrap_list;\n  }\n```\n\nIt's also simpler that the variable passed into attachTo is the same as the one in attrs and used in the component.\n\nI thank you @giuseppeg for the mixin. I'll look into using that.  If I can use a method like this.attributes({ .... }) that does all I want, then I'll use that.\n\nI'd suggest  to the flight team at large that this behavior is really a deviation from what a developer would expect.  It's been done for good reasons, but it may be helpful to put some info around this feature.  I always just assumed that defaults were a way to easily pass in variables on attachTo (really the _only_ way) and never suspected they were read-only. Maybe change the name, put some comments into the docs, something? Because it was a bear to track down what was making my tests pass one run, then fail the next.  Oy!\n\nThanks!\n"

Thanks for sharing your opinion.\n\nHowever I have a few objections to make:\n\n<blockquote>for example in your snippet we call the original function with '5' - which the na\u00efve reader will probably now assume the only parameter passed</blockquote>\n\nThat's true but it is not a big deal in my opinion. He/she will probably use only the new parameters and ignore the rest.\n\nI can't imagine why one would invoke `existingFuncName` without the original parameters. In fact the developer may want to wrap `existingFuncName` without changing its behaviour.\n\nOn the other hand I see the inconsistency. We would call `existingFuncName()` without parameters but in fact we are passing them behind the scenes.\n\nThat said, I think that the best thing to do is to just mention this somewhere in the docs.\nIf you agree we can close this issue.\n"

        "body": "Hi @DKunin \n\nYes, data components should only deal with data - fetch/prepare/broadcast.\n\nhere is what I would do (which is similar to what you described):\n- compile and dump your templates as json string in a file (templateName - template pairs)\n- make those templates global or pass them to the page (eg. app/page/default.js) when you boot/initialize it (on app/main.js)\n- create a mixin that you can use with UI components. It exposes a render method/interface to the template engine\n- when you attach the UI component to DOM elements you pass a template from the `templates` object like this \n\n``` javascript\nFoo.attachTo(document.body, {\n    fooTpl: templates.foo\n});\n```\n- that you can render later\n\n``` javascript\nthis.dataReceived = function (event, data) {\n    var tpl = this.render(this.attr.fooTpl, data);\n    this.$node.append(tpl);\n};\n```\n\nIf you want to decouple you could create a UI component that would act as renderer (like a network printer). It would hold all the tempaltes and any UI component could ask it to render a `templateName` with some `data`. Here you'd have to deal with the event ownership issue. Also the UI component should know the `templateName` in advance.\nOverall the latter adds more complexity and I am not sure whether it is an optimal solution.\n"

        "body": "Well, TweetDeck renders everything client-side, in the UI components. We use Hogan, so the templates are pre-compiled and very fast to render. HTML is definitely a UI thing, not a data thing, so it should be exclusively ui components that deal with it. \n\nAs for getting the templates, check out the flight-hogan mixin, (https://github.com/tbrd/flight-hogan). It uses the mixin definition scope to cache compiled templates for the whole site, so there's no need to pass them as arguments. In TweetDeck, we have a templates cache outside the flight framework - a throwback from the pre-flight days.\n\nI figure templates are closely tied to the UI component that renders them - it's going to be rare that a UI component is going to render different templates with the same data. Though, thinking about it, there might be some room for decoupling there.\n"

With help from the registry it could teardown all component instances attached to  that node and any descendant nodes. The only headache is having a registry dictionary of instances keyed by node (since the key must be a string and we can't necessarily determine unique selectors programmatically).

        "body": "Ok, so I've stumbled upon this problem now as well. SPA, navigation away from view, need to tear down all components in that view, while other components exist on page.\n\n**Registry style**\nUsing Flight registry this is obviously quite simple. We did something similar to the gist @giuseppeg provided, but instead used the findInstanceByNode, since we know all nodes we attached flight components to. \n\n**Event style**\nThe other option would be to have all used Flight components listen for an event. e.g. \"requestTeardown\" and then, as a consumer, fire an event on the respective DOM nodes. The components would then check if (evt.target === this.node) { this.teardown() }. This could be accomplished in a number ways though.\n\nTo summarize possible ways:\n1. Do it through registry like above. Works fine, but...is it against Flight philosophy? Registry is currently also undocumented. Is that something to rely on? @tbrd ? (Could also be exposed in core through something like Component.teardownByNode(selector|Element|ElementCollection). Possibly Component.teardownByNode could also check if any component's node has the passed node as an ancestor and then teardown. Or there could be a Component.teardownRemoved that checks registry for components that are attached to removed nodes. I could make a pull request for this if you're interested.\n2. Have a soft requirement on all components to implement the \"requestTeardown\" event above. Not good in that it easily fails, as it's simply not the case that all 3rd party components implement this.\n3. Have some kind of extension that extends the relevant components with this teardown behavior (or mixes it in) in the cases where it makes sense. Problem is how to \"subclass\" or mixin to existing defined components. Looked at https://github.com/flightjs/flight/issues/57, but unless I'm mistaken that seems to be a problem as of  now.\n\nOverall - I really think 1. makes most sense, and thus just a blessing and some documentation of registry would be nice.\n"

You can fix this and do a manual build (provided you have Node) in order to activate debugging with the standalone version:\n1. Clone the git repo, and `cd` into the directory\n2. Run `npm install` and `bower install`\n3. Open `lib/index.js` and add the `debug` module (see example file below)\n4. Run `mkdir build`\n5. Run `node tools/standalone/build.js` (compiled `flight.js` and `flight.min.js` will appear in the `build` directory)\n6. Prior to loading your Flight component(s), add:\n\n``` javascript\nflight.debug.enable(true);\nDEBUG.events.logAll();\n```\n\nLastly: when building your Flight component(s), pass `flight.logger` as a mixin to activate debug logging:\n\n``` javascript\nvar myWidget = flight.component(init, flight.logger);\nfunction init () { ... }\n```\n\n``` javascript\n// lib/index.js\ndefine(\n\n  [\n    './advice',\n    './component',\n    './compose',\n    './debug',\n    './logger',\n    './registry',\n    './utils'\n  ],\n\n  function(advice, component, compose, debug, logger, registry, utils) {\n    'use strict';\n\n    return {\n      advice: advice,\n      component: component,\n      compose: compose,\n      debug: debug,\n      logger: logger,\n      registry: registry,\n      utils: utils\n    };\n\n  }\n);\n```\n\nI've sent a pull request (#258) to try to get this incorporated into Flight master.\n"

When some UI components use a same data component, all these UI components would receive a result at the same time, even though only one needs it.\nI know can use other event names for each UI components, but I want to make data components isolated as much as possible.\n\n@giuseppeg  I will try `{callback: function() {}}` approach, thanks. \n"

        "body": "In TweetDeck we use events similarly to the way described by @giuseppeg and others: `uiNeedsX` and `dataX`. But I think this is not always a good way of doing things, because it ties the component implementations too closely.\n\nMy recommendation would be that, wherever possible, you build your components reactively:\n\n``` js\n// UI Component\nthis.trigger('uiFinshedDoingAThing', { ... });\nthis.on('usefulDataForAnotherThing', function (e, data) { ... });\n\n// Data Component\nthis.on('uiFinshedDoingAThing', function (e, data) {\n  this.trigger('usefulDataForAnotherThing', { ... });\n});\n```\n\nThe event names are not really related, so if something changes in the data layer between `uiFinishedDoingAThing` and `usefulDataForAnotherThing`, you don't have to go change the UI component too.\n\nIf you're using a UI controller pattern, you can use this kind of thing to coordinate multiple UI components' behaviour without changing their code.\n\nOf course, _it depends_. :wink:\n"

It might be a good idea to also show how to use relative selectors:\n\n```\nthis.on(this.select('selectorAttribute'), eventType, handler)\n```\n\nOR\n\n```\nthis.on(eventType, { selectorAttribute: handler })\n```\n\nIt should be noted somewhere that in the first case, event handlers are attached directly to elements matching the selector, and are not delegated to the current node like they would be if one passes an object as the second argument\n\n```\n// this handler is attached directly to the matching element:\nthis.on(selector, eventType, handler)\n\n// this handler is attached to this.node and and will capture events from\n// all children that match `selector` now and in the future\nthis.on(eventType, { selector: handler })\n```\n"

        "body": "@necolas Hmm...I really don't agree. First, there hasn't been any confusion around whether the first arg is optional or whether one is able to send any DOM node, or that the default is `this.node` unless you pass a selector. That is clear. Also, there's no confusion around the case where you pass a map of targets.\n\nThe confusion is where you pass a string. Nowhere in the docs does it say that this selector is relative to `document`. Both @patricknixon and I assumed `this.node`. I believe others have/will as well.\n\nMy recommendation would be to, under \"selector: String | Element | Element collection\", include\n\"If selector is a string, that selector will be resolved from `document`. In other words, it would be equivalent to passing $(selector)\"\n"

        "body": "Thanks @tbrd for your comment and @necolas for reopening. \n\nRegarding your question @necolas - about why I (and others) assume that it was relative to `this.node` - why assume that? Well, it seems weird for a component to know about the \"other world\" DOM structure. Or to have requirements on clients on how the outer document should be laid out - then it's not very well encapsulated IMO. So that seems like an odd use case. Secondly, having internal selectors (the click handler for that button rendered in our template) seems like a very common use case, that's why I assumed the overload was built for that purpose. \n\nAnother reason is that the signature VERY much looks looks like jQuery's `on`, which uses current node relative selectors.\n"

Personally I've never bound to `this.select('descendants')`.\n\n@staeke is right when he says that a component shouldn't be able to query the DOM like that, and maybe it would be nice to allow it to select only a subset of it eg. window, document, html, head, body, link, meta, script etc. but that's OT\n"

I should probably mention that the code was written in Flight v 1.1.2 and since then, I have updated the versions. Everything was working fine until the version of 1.2.0, so my assumption is that something was changed in the newest version that is breaking my code. \n"

If this line was not here, there would\n        // be an unresolvable cyclic dependency.\n        'jquery-private': { 'jquery': 'jquery' }\n    }\n});\n```\n\nafter you have done that, you will have to include the dependency for `jquery` everywhere you want to use it:\n\n```\ndefine(\n    [\n        'flight/lib/component',\n        'jquery'\n    ],\n    function (defineComponent, $) {\n        'use strict';\n        //here you can use $.('something')\n}\n```\n\nNow comes the tricky part. You will have to change these Flight files to make it work: `base.js ; component.js ; logger.js ;  utils.js`\n\nThe only change that you have to make is to add the `jquery` dependency and to use it as a $ sign:\n\n```\nutils.js\n-----------------------------\n\ndefine(\n\n  ['./debug','jquery'],\n\n  function(debug, $) {\n    'use strict';\n    // Flight code for utils.js ...\n}\n```\n"

        "body": "@kmargaritis It would definitely suite my project. :)\nIMO, even if you keep the changes to flight's files as i wrote in previous post, you will not have any errors, because it is only the difference in whether you are using private jquery or not. I haven't tested this but, because you can load the jquery in require, and because the special treatment of jquery in require, it will add the jquery by default to global scope, and that is the wanted behavior as it is used now in Flight.\nBut, if you want to use private jquery, you can only make the change in require config file as I showed, and it will work because of the changes in Flight.\n\nSo, my proposal is to add the changes to the Flight and document the usage of jQuery as a separate page, so that devs will know that they can use either jQuery as a `<script>` , to add it to require on the global scope, or to add it as private jQuery, not polluting the global scope.\n"

I was going to reopen this thread when I made a last-ditch effort by creating a new file just to initialize the Debug, and requiring it before the main app in the main `require`. That worked!

Same goes for ES5-Shim/sham, it mutates other objects and therefore isn't suitable for loading as a module so its not so much that we couldn't provide jQuery to plugins, its that depending on what plugins are loaded then the jQuery you get can be completely different depending on what happens to have loaded before then.  By (quickly) reading through those links, this isn't addressed although I do think there might be a shim that could turn plugins into modules somehow.  Spent some time trying to work that out but didn't get anything working before I gave up and we globalled jQuery.\n\nWhat does it requiring jQuery get us?\n"

I wanted to manipulate the child through the instance, instead of throwing the event and catching it. \n\nIn case where i store some info of the children in parent and i know exactly which child i want to interact with, i don't need to create a listener and trigger an event, then check if that event is meant for that child, etc... It would be a lot easier if i could store the instance of the attached children and then just call a method on one child instance. \nThis will also be good for the attachment of components. \n\nIn some parent component:\n\n``` javascript\nvar childComponent = this.attachChild(SomeChildComponent, 'nodeToAttachChildTo', \n    {\n         name: 'John Do',\n         count: 3\n     });\nthis.attr.childrenArray.push(childComponent);\n```\n\nAnd then, when i need to call some method of the child:\n\n``` javascript\nthis.attr.childrenArray[3].someMethod();\n```\n"

        "body": "@phuu I hear you but that's one of the best features of flight in my opinion.\nMaybe we can improve `withChildComponents` to solve some of those problems.\n\nFor example we could add a `children registry` where we store some info about children components,\npush stuff on it when we use `this.attachChild` and have `this.attachChild` return a `ChildComponent` object that exposes the API you suggested ie. you get instance info only from `this.attachChild` instead of `Component.attachTo`.\n\n`this.attachChild` would mix an object in the child component so that after teardown we can remove the child from the parent's registry.\n`ChildComponent` would have access to the children registry of course.\n\n<s>I also suggest to introduce a new concept of `RootComponent|ComponentsGroup|FlightSquares` :) or something like that so that people understand that components that get withChildComponents are just a common place where you can organise the subtree and establish those relationships - at yelp we call them `controllers`</s> (see comment below)\n"

Not sure about focusing on it for a 2.0.0 milestone though.\n"

Unfortunately, making an optimisation like this would only work if the DOM under a component was static \u2014 if the set of nodes that matched the selector changes, a cached version would miss these changes. The boolean flag is useful, but the assumption in existing code is that select is dynamic, so this would be a significant breaking change.\n\nYou could however make a (really useful) mixin called something like `withSelectCached` that added a method exactly like you describe (perhaps `this.selectCached`) that helps in the case that you _know_ the DOM is static.\n"

        "body": "I was playing with the idea to add some component hierarchy to my app. I like how React solves the inverse data flow and the idea of passing callbacks as props / attributes to the child components.\n\nTo test this on Flight, all I had to do was remove these three lines:\nhttps://github.com/flightjs/flight/blob/master/lib/base.js#L84\n\nThis removes the ability to call a function in `this.attributes`, but it enables me to do stuff like:\n\n```\nthis.attachChild(Playlist, this.select('playlistSelector'), {\n onSongClick: this.onSongClick.bind(this)\n});\n```\n\nFor me the challenge now, is how to share state with the child components. On an individual component level you can add state through `with-state`, but it would be great to update the child component's attributes through a React like function `render` without a need for a virtual dom (which is my use case for using Flight).  \n\nIMO state should be a inherent part of Flight. Children could only be initialised through `attachChild` and pushed into an array. When the parent state is updated, a method like `this.afterStateChanged` would be invoked on the child.\n"
