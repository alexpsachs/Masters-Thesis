        "body": "The expected behaviour is that when you stub or mock a method on a real object (we call this partial stubbing/mocking), the framework takes over that method for the duration of the example. So the expectation that when the wrong args are received the call is delegated to the original object is incorrect, and making this change would introduce potential problems for other users who count on this behaviour.\n\nWhat you can do is pass a block to the stub and have a conditional in it:\n\n<pre>\n@widget = Widget.new.stub(:id => 37)\nWidget.stub(:find_by_id) do |id|\n  return @widget.new if id.to_s == \"37\"\nend\n</pre>\n\n\nThere is a request to add an explicit way to call to the original in rspec-mocks-2's issue tracker: http://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/issues#issue/23.\n\nHTH,\nDavid\n"

It looked like the latest in Github may solve our problem as we tested by adding -rrubygems to the command line used and found that rspec ran as expected. We weren't able to reproduce the sucess using bundler pointing to git so we resorted to a monkey patch.\n\nIn .autotest:\n\n```\nclass Autotest::Rspec2 < Autotest\n  def make_test_cmd(files_to_test)\n    files_to_test.empty? ? '' :\n      \"bundle exec rspec --tty #{normalize(files_to_test).keys.flatten.map { |f| \"'#{f}'\"}.join(' ')}\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis is working well for us now. Since we use RVM we like this better than being so explicit about JRuby and RSpec installations. It also means we avoid the problem with having to specifically require rubygems in the JRuby invocation.\n"

You _can_ get it to work by using extend instead of include:\n\n  RSpec::Matchers.define :my_matcher do |expected|\n    extend MyModule\n  ...\n\nbut that just happens to work given the current implementation. I can't imagine a change that would break this in the future, but I make no guarantees.\n\nCheers,\nDavid\n"

It's quite useful in some cases, like for example I define a simple pseudo-format to make human readable expectations and then reuse it in various matchers.\n\nI guess people would expect it to work with `include` like it does inside of the `describe` blocks.\n\nAnyhow, thanks for the excellent job on the project!\n\n## \n\nCheers,\nNik\n"

If you want to submit a pull request I'll be glad to merge it if it's sound, but I probably won't release it until such a serious bug requires a release (which may never happen at this point).\n"

([code](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/13fd3efb14a210bb841bdfb547a10ee4e804297c/lib/rspec/core/example.rb#L20) -- note this has since [changed](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/34cb8f9d85b2d7f9f6d78c016d0f708f438bc5a3/lib/rspec/core/example.rb#L27))\n- The metadata check their superclass hash for the :description key and return that if it exists. ([code](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/107d676aba536f38ccc7317be961305c46fc0532/lib/rspec/core/metadata.rb#L44))\n- In these cases, the description has been set to nil ([code](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/13fd3efb14a210bb841bdfb547a10ee4e804297c/lib/rspec/core/example.rb#L230) -- note this code has since [changed](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/34cb8f9d85b2d7f9f6d78c016d0f708f438bc5a3/lib/rspec/core/example.rb#L239))\n\nThat's as far as I went since I was able to get it to not die by ensuring that description assignment had a string, and I don't really know what it ought to be (based on the values of the other descriptions I saw while troubleshooting, it seems that it was wanting to render code into text for the descriptions like \"should == [\"a\", 1]\").\n"

All rspec is doing there is comparing using `!=`.\n\nIf you're still not convinced the problem lies outside rspec, please file a new issue at https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/issues and reference this issue in it so the current maintainers have the background.\n"
