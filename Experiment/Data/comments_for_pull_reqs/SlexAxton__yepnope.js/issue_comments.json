        "body": "Aiight, I'm thinking a prefix is in order here, but I'm weary about adding a bunch of specific logic to the tool just for IE. So my proposed solution (which I'm currently coding) is as follows:\n\nFor IE specific includes, it'd like like this\n\n```\nyepnope([\n  {\n    nope: ['script1.js', 'script2.js', 'ie6!style1.css', 'ie7!style1.css', 'ie8!style1.css'],\n  }\n]);\n```\n\nI'd love to make it only work on css files, but that's not really point of the addition, so I think I won't. If people are going to do things incorrectly, they'll likely find a way anyways...\n\nI think I'll add this as a prefix plugin, and the api for those plugins will be something like:\n\n```\nyepnope.addPrefix('prefix', function(location){\n  //.. logic\n  return newLocation;\n});\n```\n\nIf the new location evaluated to false, then nothing will be loaded. So for the ie ones, it would look like:\n\n```\nyepnope.addPrefix('ie6', function(location) {\n  if(isIE6) {\n    return location;\n  }\n  return false;\n});\n```\n\nOnly restrictions i can see is multiple prefixes... I suppose I could support chaining prefixes...\n\n```\n`css!ie6!style.css`\n```\n\nI'll try that... it's a little odd, but I'd rather keep it pretty simple...\n"

        "body": "Okie... I think I got this in here.\n\nCSS now loads in order... so that's a total go.\n\nI also added a new function on `yepnope` called `addPrefix`\n\nThis handles all prefixes (including the built in `css!` prefix).\n\nI added an official extension to the `prefixes` folder that contains the IE conditional logic that you seem to want.\n\nIt is a good example of what you can do with the new addPrefix function.\n\nAll prefixes are chainable, and in the case where you use multiple prefixes from the ie package, it performs a logical `OR` in order to pass the tests. Other prefix families may implement that differently though, since it's specific to this plugin. Here's an example:\n\n```\nyepnope({\n  test: Modernizr.borderradius,\n  nope: ['ie!allIE.js', 'ie6!ie7!oldIEs.js', 'iegt8!newIEs.js', 'css!ielt6!iegt8!wtf.css?rnd=123']\n});\n```\n\nHere are your total list of prefixes:\n\n```\nie\nie5\nie6\nie7\nie8\nie9\niegt5\niegt6\niegt7\niegt8\nielt7\nielt8\nielt9\n```\n\nThey should be pretty self-explanatory. I think I left out a few that no one would ever use, or that we don't have yet, but this should be good for a while.\n\nI've done some regular testing, but haven't put the stress test on it yet, so let me know if you see anything odd. I'll get some real docs, and some better demos up now that #jqcon is over.\n\n<3z\n"

        "body": "That would be true for any expression. It would need to exist prior to yepnope executing.\n\nWe're working on an api that allows for injecting things in the yepnope lab chain in a callback.\n\nUntil then, you might do that manually with the $LABjs instance that yepnope has. It's ugly, but it should work. However, I think you're underestimating the ways that a script could fail to load. Really, you can't just check for the value of jQuery since depending on the browser, the script may or may not have a callback for a bad script at all. You may need to set up some sort of polling and a timeout to do it correctly.\n\n```\nfunction doAnotherYepnopeCall(prevLabChain) {\n  yepnope([{...},{...}], prevLabChain);\n}\n\nvar myLABchain = yepnope([{\n  load: 'http://cdn.com/jquery.js',\n  callback: function(){\n    // pass our labchain into the second param of another call\n    doAnotherYepnopeCall(myLABchain);\n  }\n}]);\n\nsetTimeout(function(){\n  if (!jQuery) {\n    // pass in our different LAB call\n    doAnotherYepnopeCall(yepnope('/local/jquery.js'));\n  }\n}, 15000);\n```\n\nThis of course doesn't cancel the original attempt at loading, which could potentially break some things, but LABjs doesn't really have a 'cancel' api, so it'd be tough to put that in myself. I'd say if you _absolutely_ had to have a fallback, perhaps async loading (in any capacity) isn't your best bet. You'd still see some perf gains if you did a sync load and check of jQuery (and subsequently another load of the back up) and _then_ called yepnope on the rest of your stuff.\n\nIt's possible to do the fallbacks, but there's really no pretty api for it (that I know of) and it takes quite a bit of knowledge of browser loading patterns and callbacks on errors, etc.\n\nHopefully that helps!\n\nPS the sync pattern of this is easy:\n\n```\n<script \"http://cdn.com/jquery.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  if(!jQuery) {\n    document.write('<script src=\"local/jquery.js\"><'+'/script>');\n  }\n</script>\n<script>\n  yepnope(...);\n</script>\n```\n"

        "body": "Yepnope does request every file you put into it twice. The first time it loads itself into your cache as some sort of non-executable entity (an object element, or an img element, or a script element with a fake type attribute, depending on your browser). The second time it's injected, we inject it as an executable script, and this time it's cached. So there is really only the millisecond or less that it takes to execute the callback function and reinject a script tag extra (and however long it takes to access the cache).\n\nFirebug hasn't been the  most reliable source of what's going on (since arguably, this technique isn't exactly standard). We found that we needed to create test cases around the issue in a more foolproof manner, so we did.\n\nIf you serve the yepnope directory (on apache w/ a php installation) (with wamp or mamp works on windows or mac, respectively), then you can direct your browser at the tests folder. A few of the tests are specifically built to catch a _real_ double load (as this was _previously_ an issue in firefox - (so if you have an old version, you should update)).\n\nThe way the test works, is to put a sleep timer on resources that's long enough to be unmistakable. So we can force a JS file to take 3 seconds to download.\n\nIf at 5 seconds in it's not done (enough time for latency/slow computers etc), then it probably downloaded twice, instead of caching the second time. If it takes between 3 and 5 seconds, then it works as expected. And if it takes less than 3 seconds then it was cached to begin with an is an invalid test.\n\nSo I'd encourage you to make sure you're on the latest version and run the test suite in your browser and let me know the results. If it is double loading for real (like full-request-double-loading) then I'd love to get as much info about your set up as possible, because I'm currently passing all tests in as many browsers as I can get my hands on.\n\nThanks for reporting the issue.\n"

The scripts don't seem to be downloading twice when using the latest code.\n\nI also noticed that multiple calls to yepnope in the same page seem to cause Firefox to hang as if it's waiting for resources to download. Granted, the purpose of yepnope seems to be a onetime dynamic loader for polyfills, but I found myself in a situation where I needed to pause loading of a subsequent script until a callback is executed, ala $LAB.wait(). The callbacks specified in yepnope don't seem to force a wait, so I tried calling yepnope again from inside the callback itself. Though the second call does download the resources, I get a never-ending beachball (on a mac) and progress bar.\n"

        "body": "Actually, yepnope does enforce execution order. It's why we removed the `wait!` prefix from the api. Any order that you give your scripts in will be guaranteed to execute in that order (but all will download in parallel). We have (as you seem to have stumbled upon) created a way to load scripts inside the callbacks (and have those scripts execute before something in the next array element).  This probably isn't what you want in your case though. If you just specify the next script in an array, it will load in order. This way both scripts can download simultaneously instead of not knowing to start downloading the second script until the first is already done.\n\nThanks for the feedback! We've seen some of the firefox throbber issues, but we're not sure how to consistently reproduce them and it seems to be in conjuncture with other things. Needless to say, we'll keep our eye open.

Try updating to the RC1 that's currently the latest in the repo, and it should work (I tested it, and it did).\n\nAlso, `wait!` is no longer necessary, we decided to just always enforce order. So save the bytes.\n\nAlso, ask the selectivizr guy to make his stuff not use `document.write` so you can load jQuery and selectivizr all with yepnope (async).\n\nAlso instead of including 3 separate files for yepnope, and all of Modernizr, try the builder that I created: http://modernizr.github.com/Modernizr/2.0-beta/#flexbox-input-iepp-load\n\nThat should automagically create a build of Modernizr that just has the flexbox and input tests that you need, and it also has yepnope bundled with it. Then, I would say to concatenate the yepnope.ie-prefix.js file to the end of that, and just have 1 file up top, BUT you aren't using the ie prefix anywhere... so just leave that out.\n\nHope all that helps!\n"

(I actually would advise against it if you can avoid it, but if you're trying the hack i showed you in the google maps stuff, that'd be a good reason to do it :) ).\n\nThanks for the catch!\n\nWe moved away from LABjs in the 1.x version of yepnope so we could do some things that aren't possible (while obviously making other sacrifices) with LAB. This also helps to keep our file size down, which is priority #1 with script loaders.\n\nThanks for the congratz. Let me know if you run into anything else!\n\nP.S. thanks for the fix ralph\n"

(especially for users with ie6/7/ff2: which allow only 2 same domain tcp connections)\n\nSo for now i just moved the google loader jsapi reference to the login page, like this the users cache is already primed when he hits the actual application page, and then use googles native load function if a client ever needs to access it.\n\nThank's for the updates, will surely be integrating them with modernizr 2 :)\n"

I'd suggest not running on master branch until we get a real 1.0 - because we're getting all the grossest bugs out and I totally shouldn't have RC'd it until we did that, but I didn't have enough tests in place at the time.\n\nThanks for running the tests and letting us know. Super helpful!\n"

        "body": "Heyo,\n\nSo after looking into this issue, there's definitely a header being sent back by twitter that is prompting the pop-up. I can't tell which specifically, but I assume it has something to do with the mime / content-type.\n\nThat being said, yepnope isn't really designed to be loading json callbacks. While it may work if the headers are correct, typically JSON is sent with a <code>no-cache</code> header, and yepnope requires that there always be proper caching on the resources it loads. This is because yepnope fully decouples preloading and executing. This technique hinges on the fact that we can preload a resource, and then quickly execute it because its already loaded into the browsers cache. In the case of loading JSON, we cant preload the data because it's being sent with a <code>no-cache</code> header, so you would essentially be downloading the JSON twice (this is also the case with _any_ resources that doesn't have proper caching headers).\n\nUsing jQuery to grab the json in the callback would be the best option here:\n\n<pre><code>var twitterid = 'some_twitter_id';\n\nyepnope({\n  test: window.twitterCallback2,\n  nope: \"js!http://twitter.com/javascripts/blogger.js\",\n  complete: function() {\n    $.getScript('http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/' + twitterid +'.json?callback=twitterCallback2&count=3')\n  }\n});</code></pre>\n\n\nPerhaps we can add this to the \"gotchas\" or \"keep in mind\" section on the site.\n\nThanks,\n\nRalph\n"

        "body": "OK, couple of things:\n- I believe I'm having this issue because the Yepnope that is embedded in Modernizr does NOT include any of the prefixes that are documented on the Yepnopejs.com site.\n- I have since minified yepnope.is-prefix.js and appended it to my Modernizr build.  Sadly, this doesn't appear to have any desired affect.  I would venture to guess that this prefix would need to be installed inside one of the closures inside of the minified Modernizr code.  Since custom Modernizr builds are only available in minified form, this is a rather difficult position that us users are put in.\n- Why does yepnope load a resource that is prefixed with a string it doesn't understand?  In particular, YN appears to load resources prefixed with \"ie6!\" if there is no prefix 'installed' to handle that?  That seems to be an important logic bug, eh?\n\nI would like to make these recommendations:\n- The documentation at yepnopejs.com should use clearer language about features that aren't actually installed in the build;  Language like \"Yepnope officially supports...\" is unclear at best;\n- Modernizr should at least allow a build option to include these optional prefixes; OR Yepnope plugins should be able to be appended to the minified Modernizr builds and still work;\n- To be honest, IE-, preload!- and css!-prefixes probably should just be part of the normal build.  I do realise that we can save a few bytes by not including them, but these are only a few bytes and since this is the preloader that yepnope users will be using, how would we go about loading the extra components that we require for yepnope itself?\n- Yepnope should not treat unknown prefixes as anything special, but instead consider it the URL as per normal.  Silently ignoring them seems dangerous.  As a developer, I would rather see 404's for resources like ie6!/js/dd-belated-png.min.js in my console.  It points directly to what the problem is.\n"

        "body": "Hmm, Okay, my feedback:\n- You _do_ need the plugins in order for them to work.\n- The site _does_ list them as _plugins_ - but we'll see what we can do about making it more clear for people who didn't see the title first.\n- The Modernizr build tool options (while I may be on that team) are completely up to the Modernizr team. Yepnope went 1.0.0 2 days, ago, so I'd expect a little time before extra features show up in the _beta_ builder for modernizr. I think it'd be good to get some of the plugins as an option, but I also think that they could severely clutter the Modernizr build tool with things that no one generally cares about. I think if you're going to be loading plugins, you should probably not use it as Modernizr.load - and just concatenate your modernizr build and your yepnope build. Modernizr.load is not guaranteed to act exactly the same as yepnope in the future\n- I think you misunderstand the flexibility of plugins. The ie prefixes are just implemented as plugins, so yepnope's internals have no way of knowing that these are 'exclusive' plugins instead of just modification plugins. Some plugins would require the exact _opposite_ behavior from the one you're suggesting. We always strip off the various plugins, and then run their modification function on the resource objects. If there is no modification function, nothing gets modified, and the script loads as-is. This is entirely desired behavior. Since `!` is invalid in a url (which is why we use it) - it would be silly to just leave on an unknown prefix and request it. It would also be silly to assume anything about whether the resource should be loaded by default or not loaded by default (because different plugins may not have anything to do with _whether_ something loads or not.).\n- I don't think that IE, preload, or CSS are even close to common use-cases. While they all might be small individually, they add up (and we'll add more official plugins in the future). It doesn't make sense to include _any_ bytes in a loader that you don't absolutely need, since the loader is a blocking resource. It pains me to even have a 1.6kb library at this point.\n\nI understand that we seem to simply have a difference of opinion on most of these things, rather than any technical issues. Please know that with sufficient support, I'd consider these types of suggestions, but as of now, I think I like the structure as-is. I will certainly go back through and make the appropriate documentation changes to make these things more obvious in the future.\n\nThanks for your report!\nAlex\n\nPS: you're example of what you're trying to do seems to go against the main point of yepnope, which is to load scripts in parallel. So rather than what you have there, perhaps you could not _automatically_run_front.js_ and instead have it create an object that you can call `.init()` on (or something similar). That way, you could do:\n\n```\n<script>\n  yepnope({\n    load: [ \n      \"/js/jquery-1.5+tinypubsub-0.6.min.js\",\n      \"ie6!/js/dd-belated-png.min.js\",\n      \"/js/front.js\"\n    ],\n    complete : function() {\n      // Delay loading until DOM READY signal\n      jQuery(function(){ Front.init(); });\n    }\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\nAnd you'd get full parallel loading.\n"

        "body": "Well, darn.  I was hoping to use Modernizr.load/Yepnope to lazyload virtually all my JS until after Document Ready, and yes, I would like this to be in parallel where possible.  (In this case, I don't need really need any part of front.js until after Document Ready, so, I think I'm doing this the right way for my case.)\n\nRe: \"You're example of what you're trying to do seems to go against the main point of yepnope, which is to load scripts in parallel\".  That's weird, I thought Yepnope's goal was to serve as a \"Conditional Loader for your Polyfills\"?  =) And, what is DD_belatedPNG if not one of the original polyfills? =)\n\nRe: \"Modernizr.load is not guaranteed to act exactly the same as yepnope in the future\".  This is precisely why I would prefer to use Modernizr.load vs. a separate Yepnope build directly and therefore, precisely why I would like support for IE prefixes built in, or as an optional part of the custom Modernizr builder.  Sadly, right now, we seem to be sitting across two stools.\n\nI know that there's a stigma, nowadays about browser sniffing in favor of feature detection.  I get that, 100%.  And, I wish there was a feature detect algorithm for 32-bit PNG support, but there's not (that I am aware of).  Until there is, we (web developers at large) need to know if we're on IE6.  To be honest, I think this should be in Modernizr more-so than in Yepnope.\n\nI can continue to use conditional scripts to load PNG support for IE6, but doing that ensures that, at least for IE6, DD_belatedPNG is a blocking load.  A hybrid approach, albeit ugly is:\n\n```\n<head>\n  ...\n  <script src=\"/js/modernizr.min.js\">\n  <!--[if IE 6]>\n  <script>\n    var ie6 = true;\n  </script>\n  <![endif]-->\n<body>\n  ...\n  <script>\n    yepnope({\n      test: window.ie6,\n      yep: \"/js/dd-belated-png.min.js\",\n      load: [ \n        \"/js/jquery-1.5+tinypubsub-0.6.min.js\"\n      ],\n      complete : function() {\n        $(function(){ yepnope(\"/js/front.min.js\"); });\n      }\n    });\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nYou can imagine that this would get even uglier if, for some reason, I needed to detect other flavors of IE too.  But for now, this will suffice.\n\nThanks for the great tool!  I look forward to baking this deeper into the architecture of more projects.\n"

This is where you'll have nice performance gains.\n\nyepnope is an _asynchronous parallel script loader_ - The parallel part means that you can load all of your scripts at once. So you are welcome to load front.js later on, but you are only artificially extending the time that it takes for that script to run. This would probably end up being even slower than a normal `script` tag, because it isn't injected until _after_ the dom is ready, whereas most scripts would be a part of the dom. That's all I meant by that. Certainly it will continue to work.\n"

        "body": "Thanks, Slex, you're right of course and I do know this.\n\nSince I've posted the above, I have removed the $(function() {...}) from my complete block as I had deemed it safe to start loading front.js anytime after jQuery.  My reasoning before this change was based around not loading anything until the page is visually complete so as not to delay anything loading that is required for the visual \"ready\".  Since front.js is the last thing loaded, I can safely assume that at worse, it may download in parallel with some of images, but would never block them.  Currently this whole visually page loads in about 500ms from a server on the other side of the Atlantic, which is fantastic for this site.  Another 2-3 seconds of JS will continue to execute preloading more content that is offscreen and behaviours that aren't required right away.  I'm quite pleased with this, and Yepnope is a nice part of this, thank you.\n\nBeyond that, I don't think I should be loading any of front.js until I am certain that jQuery is available, as everything in there is within self-running closures that require jQuery as parameter.  I suppose I could preload it, but then I would need the preload! prefix now wouldn't I? =)\n\nMy main focus for this thread, however, is loading DD_belatedPNG in the right circumstances.  And, while I have a workable solution now, I was hoping to convince either the folks at Yepnope or Modernizr to include IE-detection in their respective libraries.  I can easily write my own (or just use the cond. comments as per above), but I'm not building a single webpage, but a whole, very large website, and I'm looking after getting the right mix of COTS components that I know will continue to be maintained and don't require a lot of customization over the coming months/years.\n\nModernizr, the only thing I want loaded in < head > (as it was intended) is where IE detection should reside.  Yepnope already has this capability, but sadly as a plugin, which is not included in Modernizr, nor is it an installable option.  Darn the luck.\n"

Include Modernizr (with correct options)\n2. Include yepnope 1.0.0 exactly\n3. Add `Modernizr.load=function(){yepnope.apply(window,[].slice.call(arguments,0))};`\n\nSo quite literally, there is nothing different about Modernizr.load than yepnope, because it calls `yepnope` in it. (yepnope is also leaked globally (on purpose)).\n\nI just tested to see if prefixes loaded after `Modernizr.load` was aliased and they still work fine. (though you would add them to the `yepnope` object, NOT to the `modernizr.load` object).\n\nAfter a modernizr build with `modernizr.load` try this:\n\n`yepnope.addPrefix( 'alert', function ( r ) { alert( 'works!' ); return r; });`\n\n`Modernizr.load( 'alert!something/that/exists.js' );`\n\nThis alerts just dandy.

I think exposing the underlying script injector (much like we expose the caching-only) would be a good addition. Unfortunately it'd probably be a significant amount of code change. Probably a 1.1.0 type thing.\n\nIf you want to try to hack your own version until we hit our next version, the `injectJs` function would be a good place to start. You'd just need to create an object in the format that `preloadFile` returns. That's at least where I'd start.\n\nThanks for the suggestion!\n"

        "body": "Heyo Acoustic,\n\nThe deleting of the autoprotocol filter was intentional. Back in the early days of yepnope.js, when it was basically a wrapper around LABjs, the autoprotocol filter was needed because LABjs would not properly handle \"[protocol relative URLs](http://paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/).\" However, after looking at the features and file size we were targeting, it became clear to us that we would have to ditch LABjs and write our own loader to keep the file size down and have awesome features (like recursive yepnope and fallback scripts). Once we gathered some requirements, ditched LABjs, and wrote our own loader from scratch, we no longer needed that filter because our new shnazzy loader handled protocol relative URLs correctly out of the box.\n\nSorry for the confusion, but if you're using protocol relative URLs, they'll just work, no filter needed, bro.\n\nThanks,\n\nRalph\n"

There's one yepnope called on document ready, then each section can have it's own yepnope call, triggered when it loads in. The system that loads the sections and triggers the yepnope handles caching callbacks to avoid sending duplicate requests because this was happening if if I turned allow duplicates to false in the LAB chain.\n\nTo get the issue to trigger use the next button (or jump to) to get over to the narrative. As soon as that is loaded you should see the spinner. The other option you have is using console to trigger another yepnope call once the initial spot is done. Here's what I use since I know the script doesn't result in 404.\n\n```\n      yepnope([ {test:true, yep:['js/yn_test.js']} ])\n```\n\nThe system for handling the yepnope calls\n        // check if we've already loaded the form yepnope\n        if(this.loaded_yepnope['form'] != undefined){\n            // check if it's an array (will be null if there's no resources)\n            // and if so loop through and check if it's a function, and call it\n            if($.isArray(this.loaded_yepnope['form'])){\n                $.each(this.loaded_yepnope['form'], function(){\n                    prop_to_check = this.test == true ? 'yep' : 'nope';\n                    if($.isArray(this[prop_to_check]) && $.isFunction(this.callback))\n                        this.callback.call();\n                });\n            }\n        } else {\n            $.merge(resources, this.yepnope_resources);\n            this.loaded_yepnope['form'] = this.yepnope_resources;\n        }\n\n```\n    // same as above but for the current section\n    if(this.loaded_yepnope[this.section.name] != undefined){\n        if($.isArray(this.loaded_yepnope[this.section.name])){\n            $.each(this.loaded_yepnope[this.section.name], function(){\n                prop_to_check = this.test == true ? 'yep' : 'nope';\n                if($.isArray(this[prop_to_check]) && $.isFunction(this.callback))\n                    this.callback.call();\n            });\n        }\n    } else {\n        if($.isFunction(this.section.getYepnopeResources)){\n            s_yepnope = this.section.getYepnopeResources();\n            $.merge(resources, s_yepnope);\n        } else {\n            // if there's no getYepnopeResources function, set it to null to not have to deal with it again\n            s_yepnope = null;\n        }\n        this.loaded_yepnope[this.section.name] = s_yepnope;\n    }\n\n\n    //if(this.debug)\n        console.log('yepnope resources:', resources);\n\n    // and now load\n    if(resources.length)\n        yepnope(resources);\n```\n"

        "body": "Thanks Paul.\n\nThough, while this is _possible_ with yepnope. I'd strongly suggest doing that work on the serverside. You always know which page you're serving up, so the best performance is going to come by writing a small module in whatever backend you use in order to output the correct included scripts into yepnope per page. It doesn't sound as sexy, and I love it when people use yepnope, but I think you'll be happier in the end.\n\nJust for a little insight into why, you'd actually need to load jQuery first, then start loading your script afterwards. This stops you from being able to do parallel downloads, and will end up hurting your speed. It also highly couples your dom to your app. This means that when some other designer changes the class names, the whole site stops working suddenly.\n\nHope that helps!\n"

        "body": "Hey Ben,\n\nThis is certainly an issue we've seen, and moved around quite a bit in Firefox. (and it's certainly a bug in firefox, as _nothing_ is still loading). However, as of right now, we can't really find a way around it in the scenario that you are talking about.\n\nMy best suggestion is to not wait until `domready` to load anything. The best case scenario is to wrap the script in a function and _execute_ the function on domready, instead of waiting to load it altogether.\n\nThe other, slightly dirtier option would be to use the `preload!` prefix/plugin in order to preload the plugin right away in the initial block. Then, since jQuery is on the page, just use a `getScript` call to the exact same url you preloaded with. This will avoid an additional object preload, and ensure that there is no eternal loader. We are definitely adding a 'now' prefix that will also avoid preloading, but we haven't quite got there yet.\n\nAs a background, firefox has some  bugs with object loading of elements being injected in the callbacks of other object preloads. So you _might_ have some luck just adding a `setTimeout` to the call that you have in the document ready function.\n\n```\n    OTR.ready(function() {\n      log('All base scripts have loaded...');\n      setTimeout( function() {\n      yepnope([\n        {\n          // load one, we may load more depending on what the page requires.\n          load: \"http://www.cornify.com/js/cornify.js\",\n          complete: function() {\n            cornify_add();\n            log('cornify loaded:', cornify_add);\n          }\n        }\n      ]);\n      }, 0 );\n    });\n```\n\nThough I can't guarantee that one will actually work. It's worth a shot though. :/\n\nThanks! And we'll certainly update immediately if we can figure out a way to make this go away for good.\n"

(Haven't looked deep into this fouc issue, but i think it's by design).\n\nDue to the fact, that webshims lib has its own mechanism for ordering execution (similiar to requirejs), the current way isn't needed and I would welcome a simple injectJS method.\n"

        "body": "Unfortunately, this is a bit different than the way yepnope works internally. When you load a resource with a fake `type` attribute (like `text/template`), it actually doesn't even download in most modern browsers. In the browsers that it does download in, the text isn't accessible to you like it would be if the template was inline.\n\nThe way requirejs does this is by doing an XHR request for the file, if you specify that it is a `text!` dependency. ( https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/blob/master/text.js#L22 ). This technique does not work cross-domain. The way that RequireJS gets around this, is that if you require a cross domain text file, it will pull it down during the build process, and inline it as a string in your final source code.\n\nYepnope neither has any xhr capabilities, nor a build tool, so I think this may be out of the bounds of what will ever be possible with yepnope.\n\nLet me know if you know differently about any of this stuff, but I've done a fair amount of work with this stuff in the past, and it's just an entirely different ballgame. a micro-xhr library maybe all you really need.\n"

        "body": "We're working on the next version of `yepnope` and this has actually already made it in. If you look at the `v1.1` branch, you can see in the prefixes section that we've added an attribute object that you can send via prefix or filter.\n\nIt looks something like this in practice:\n\n```\nyepnope.addPrefix( 'media_all', function ( resource ) {\n    resource.attrs = {\n        \"media\" : \"all\"\n    };\n    return resource;\n});\nyepnope('media_all!all.css');\n```\n\nBUT - this use actually kind of defeats the purpose of yepnope a little bit. These won't lazy load, because yepnope preloads files first, then injects them. So I think the real solution here is the the `Modernizr.mq` function. It allows you to pass in mediaqueries as your test;\n\n```\nyepnope({ test: Modernizr.mq('min-width:0px;'), yep: 'all.css' });\n```\n\nIt's an additional thing to add, but you can build a pretty small version of modernizr with yepnope built in.\n\nHope that helps.\n"

        "body": "From what I can tell, you aren't doing much conditional loading. Ideally, you still concatenate all files that you can together, and serve them up together. Also, I'm not positive, but last I checked, `selectivizr` had a `document.write` in it, which means that it cannot be loaded asynchronously.\n\nAssuming Selectivizr was fixed, it seems like you could reduce this to 3 requests. Concatenate all JS except selectivizr, and all css (potentially in a build tool) and use `Modernizr.load` to bring them in. Then instead of using the `ie` prefix for yepnope, you'd be better off using feature detection for support of the css3 capabilities that you need. So that should be rewritten as a test/nope situation.\n\nHope that helps!\n"

        "body": "Assuming that there is a head tag is actually way more dangerous than assuming that there is a script tag. In fact, jQuery does not assume that there is a `head` - it uses the same method that yepnope does. However, we could recompute the available script tag at the time of each injection, rather than once at the top. I will talk it over with @ralphholzmann and see if it's not a big pain. Until then, that's the patch that I'd suggest.\n\nThere are plenty of browsers, however, that do not automatically add a head element in. http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/05/12/autohead-my-first-browserscope-user-test/\n\nSo that is not a safe alternative.\n"

Lousy explanation on my side\n\nLooking forward to have yepnope working on my sites\n\nCheers\n"

Whatever event you are using to trigger the \"complete\" callback, it's firing too early on Android. :S\n\nOh, before anyone suggests it, the reason I have my scripts split up like this is I have the 3rd party scripts setup with a very long cache expiry, because they will never change (new versions have new file names). My \"main.js\" file (and my HTML file) have a fairly short cache expiry while I am in development mode. I will consider minifying these into a single blob once I reach stable.\n"

However, script1 and script2 are bound to DOM ready event. Asyncly loading a script before the DOM ready event is fired seems to delay the firing of the event until the async script has been downloaded.\n\nSo what I end up with is this code, assuming jQuery is pre-loaded:\n\n```\nModernizr.load({\n    load: ['script1.js', 'script2.js'],\n    complete: function() {\n        $(function() {\n            $.getScript('http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js');\n        })\n    }\n});\n```\n\nDependence on jQuery makes me a little uneasy, but it works. Still looking for a better solution.\n"

We've (read: @ralphholzmann ) added additional support for testing that in the `v1.1` tests by moving over some of the rewriting work to handle it better. It all seems to work well.\n\nLet me know if you find out something else. We're looking to move on `v1.1` soon so it'd be good to get a fix in for this if it's truly a bug.\n"

I will see if I can build a sanitised example (this is company code, unfortunately) to demonstrate. I put alert()s at the top of the loaded scripts and never saw any of them pop up. This is not only happening on Android, and even putting a setTimeout() in the complete handler isn't enough to guarantee script execution.\n\nI've had to resort to jQuery.getScript in the meantime, which I've noticed is blindingly fast compared to YepNope. I have a feeling I can probably do away with those setTimeout()s too. It obviously doesn't work for CSS files, but I am thinking of building something that accepts similar parameters to YepNope but uses jQuery.getScript underneath.\n"

I'm sure there's still some secret ways to break it if you try, so we'll still offer the css plugin (adds the `forceCSS` options to `true` on the resource object) just in case you need to be absolutely sure (like if you are generating urls and you don't know if they're valid.)\n\nSo I'm closing this as invalid again, but the feedback is clear that the plugin is not obvious, and so we've pushed those changes into the next version.\n\nThanks for your report. \n"

        "body": "Alright, I looked into the code it would take to add this in. It wouldn't be as small as I'd like, so I don't think I'm going to add this in.\n\nHowever, I think this really only looks good in the case when you're only loading a single string with yepnope. Like so:\n\n``` javascript\nyepnope('myscript.js', function(){ alert('done!'); });\n```\n\nI agree that that is better than creating an object and giving it a `complete` handler. But once you start creating tests and stuff, I think it becomes more clear with the explicit `complete` handler.\n\nLuckily in `v1.1` we exposed the raw injection function `yepnope.injectJs` so you'll be able to do this simple case with that:\n\n``` javascript\nyepnope.injectJs('myscript.js', function () { alert('done!'); });\n```\n\nThat bypasses all the caching mechanisms and stuff, so it's a bit more smooth anyways. So people who want to use yepnope as just an async script injector can be satisfied.\n"

        "body": "Head or bottom:\nActually, I really dislike this answer. Modern browsers can load JS without blocking other downloads, but they still block the visual rendering. If you are using yepnope or any other script loader neither downloading other resources nor rendering the page is blocked. \n\nThe only difference between putting in head and putting @bottom is, that if you are calling yepnope from head the scripts are loaded in front of other resources, which means your behavior is faster attached as content images and css images. If you put it @ bottom, first content images are loaded and then your scripts. What is best for you, really depends on what you are doing. If you have a lightbox, it is fine to put @bottom, if you are using tabs or accordions, it might be better to use from head. And if your site doesn't work without JS, you should really start your scripts as soon as possible. (There is also another technique to call scripts right after the header of website...).\n\ncombined or uncombined:\nI think the answer above already gives you some hint for this. If both scripts are really small, you should combine them to minimize request, if they are not small (above 20kb) it is ok to not combine, because the download can be parallelized.\n\nI also would suggest, that you simply try it and look into your network panel of Firefox and decide yourself, what is important, what is better in case of your site. (I really like AOL Pagetest for IE8 to look the network waterfall).\n"

We'd love to get these errors, but we can't act on the ones that we don't get. We put the timeout in place for this reason.\n\nThe other problem is a bug in yepnope that we've fixed in `v1.1` (not yet released) but is pretty easy to work around yourself. Just use a `callback` instead of a `complete` when you're relying on the fallback. I think that should solve it.\n"

This has the disadvantage of exposing loadScriptOrStyle publicly, but is only 1 additional line in the main yepnope.js.  It also requires moving loadScriptOrStyle and its dependent functions out of the yepnope function.\n\nOption 2 is to override the yepnope loader and replace it with my own, this has the advantage that the yepnope loader is already exposed, but the disadvantage that the existing callbacks call getYepnope() which creates and attaches a fresh loader.  This would have to change, and I'd need to figure out a way to translate the index reset (which I imagine is the main purpose of that call) down through the override to the base loader.  Possibly 2 or 3 more lines of code in yepnope.js.\n\nI prefer option 2, though we may regret that if later the loader needs to reset more state than just the index.  However if that is the case, exposing getYepnope so it can be overridden might solve that problem.\n\n-Gordon\n"

        "body": "Hey Alex,\n\nJust wanted to revisit this issue again with the latest version.  It looks like the above bug is fixed, but there is another issue that is semi-related.\n\nTo summarize: I'm not sure where the best place is to put jQuery-dependent code at that will ensure it runs even if the jQuery fallback script is used.\n\nTake the following example where the CDN is offline and the fallback is used:\n\n```\nyepnope([{\n    load: '//ajax.googleapisOFFLINE.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js',\n    complete: function () {\n        if (!window.jQuery) {\n            yepnope('/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js');\n        }\n\n        $(\"div.whatever\").css(\"color\",\"red\");\n    }\n}]);\n```\n\nThis code will fail, because the jQuery code used to change the css of `div.whatever` runs before the fallback is done loading.\n\nNow, if you do the following code, it works fine:\n\n```\nyepnope([{\n    load: '//ajax.googleapisOFFLINE.com/ajaxX/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js',\n    complete: function () {\n        if (!window.jQuery) {\n            yepnope('/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js');\n        }\n    }\n},\n{\n    load: \"/js/jquery.plugin.js\",\n    complete: function() {\n        $(\"div.whatever\").css(\"color\",\"red\");\n    }\n}]);\n```\n\nThis works, because `jquery.plugin.js` doesn't try to load until after the fallback is loaded.  This works great.  But what about the case where you don't have any plugins to load and you simply just need to run some jQuery to manipulate the DOM or CSS or whatever?\n\nCan't do this:\n\n```\nyepnope([{\n    load: '//ajax.googleapisOFFLINE.com/ajaxX/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js',\n    complete: function () {\n        if (!window.jQuery) {\n            yepnope('/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js');\n        }\n    }\n},\n{\n    load: \"\",\n    complete: function() {\n        $(\"div.whatever\").css(\"color\",\"red\");\n    }\n}]);\n```\n\nor this:\n\n```\nyepnope([{\n    load: '//ajax.googleapisOFFLINE.com/ajaxX/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js',\n    complete: function () {\n        if (!window.jQuery) {\n            yepnope('/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js');\n        }\n    }\n},\n{\n    load: null,\n    complete: function() {\n        $(\"div.whatever\").css(\"color\",\"red\");\n    }\n}]);\n```\n\nbecause the `div.whatever` code doesn't wait until the jQuery fallback is loaded to run, since there is no script to load and wait on.\n\nAlso can't do this:\n\n```\nyepnope([{\n    load: '//ajax.googleapisOFFLINE.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js',\n    complete: function () {\n        if (!window.jQuery) {\n            yepnope('/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js');\n        }\n\n        $(document).ready(function(){\n            $(\"div.whatever\").css(\"color\",\"red\");\n        });\n    }\n}]);\n```\n\nAnd you can't put it outside yepnope either:\n\n```\nyepnope([{\n    load: '//ajax.googleapisOFFLINE.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js',\n    complete: function () {\n        if (!window.jQuery) {\n            yepnope('/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js');\n        }\n    }\n}]);\n\n$(document).ready(function(){    // $ is undefined\n    $(\"div.whatever\").css(\"color\",\"red\");\n});\n```\n\nor simply:\n\n```\nyepnope([{\n    load: '//ajax.googleapisOFFLINE.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js',\n    complete: function () {\n        if (!window.jQuery) {\n            yepnope('/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js');\n        }\n    }\n}]);\n\n$(\"div.whatever\").css(\"color\",\"red\");   // $ still undefined\n```\n\nThe only solution I can come up with is this:\n\n```\nyepnope([{\n    load: '//ajax.googleapisOFFLINE.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js',\n    complete: function () {\n        if (!window.jQuery) {\n            yepnope('/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js');\n        }\n    }\n},\n'/js/another.script.js'\n]);\n```\n\nIn that example I just load up another file and have all my jQuery init/setup stuff in it.  This works because it waits to load that other script until after all the other stuff runs, including the jQuery fallback.  The only bad thing about this solution is that you have to load another file, which if is really small, like <4kb then it's more optimal to have it inline with the yepnope loading script...\n\nFirst of all, again, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to use yepnope properly.  Is there an obvious place I should be placing jQuery stuff that will ensure it runs properly even after the fallback is used?\n\nThere are two possible solutions I can think of with regards to improving yepnope to fix this problem:\n1. The whole problem would be solved (I think) if the `yepnope('/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js')` fallback had an option to load the script synchronously instead of asynchronously.  This would make the rest of the `complete` function wait until the script was loaded before continuing.\n2. The following would work:\n\n```\nyepnope([{\n    load: '//ajax.googleapisOFFLINE.com/ajaxX/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js',\n    complete: function () {\n        if (!window.jQuery) {\n            yepnope('/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js');\n        }\n    }\n},\n{\n    load: \"\",\n    complete: function() {\n        $(\"div.whatever\").css(\"color\",\"red\");\n    }\n}]);\n```\n\nif you still treated the empty script name as a script and putting in the loading queue anyways.  I see in the yepnope code that if the script is empty then it just returns.  If it continued like usual, added the empty script to the queue and then when  the script came to the front of the queue, return at that point, then it would maybe work then as well, because the complete function wouldn't run until then, at which point all the previous scripts (including the fallback) would have run because they already went through the queue.\n\nAnyways, let me know what you think and please let me know if I'm just doing everything wrong :-)\n"

Hadn't considered the non-reexecuting thing, although I do recall reading about it in the changelog.  I'll mess with the callback function.  Haven't used that before.\n\nAnd I agree, a blank/empty script name isn't a good solution.  I'll take a look at the yepnope code and see if any better ideas hit him.  Honestly, it kind of goes against the spirit of yepnope and it's async loading style, but having the option to synchronously load a script if you want would be nice in situations like this.  Not sure how hard that would be to pull off with the existing code base.\n\nThanks for the suggestions, Alex!\n"

        "body": "Okay so some more experimentation:\n\nThe combination of complete/callback didn't seem to work either.  I think I'm doing it right... should that have worked?\n\nI also tried the following (that I really thought would work actually).  \n\n```\nyepnope([{\n    load: '//ajax.googleapisOFFLINE.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js',\n    complete: function ()\n    {\n        if (!window.jQuery)\n        {\n                console.log(\"loading local file\");\n\n                var script=document.createElement('script');\n                script.setAttribute(\"type\",\"text/javascript\");\n                script.setAttribute(\"src\", 'local.jquery.min.js');\n                document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(script);\n\n                console.log(\"done loading local file\");\n        }\n\n        console.log(\"some jQuery stuff\");\n\n        $(\"div.whatever\").css(\"color\",\"red\");\n\n        console.log(\"done with jQuery stuff\");\n    }\n}]);\n```\n\nIt just manually appends the local script to the head.  I thought this would work for sure... Not sure why.  I was thinking that if I didn't have the `async` attribute in there, that the script would not continue until it was done loading.  I guess I was wrong.  It looks like it appends the script node (at which point the local jquery .js starts to load) and then the script continues, at which it fails since `$` still isn't defined yet.\n\nI also tried this:\n\n```\nyepnope([{\n    load: '//ajax.googleapisOFFLINE.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js',\n    complete: function ()\n    {\n        if (!window.jQuery)\n        {\n                console.log(\"loading local file\");\n\n                var script=document.createElement('script');\n                script.setAttribute(\"type\",\"text/javascript\");\n                script.setAttribute(\"src\", 'local.jquery.min.js');\n                document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(script);\n\n                while ( window.jQuery == null )\n                {\n                    setTimeout(function() {console.log(\"still not loaded yet\");},100);\n                }\n\n                console.log(\"done loading local file\");\n        }\n\n        console.log(\"some jQuery stuff\");\n\n        $(\"div.whatever\").css(\"color\",\"red\");\n\n        console.log(\"done with jQuery stuff\");\n    }\n}]);\n```\n\nTried to get the script just to sit in limbo until jQuery was loaded but it seemed to go on forever.  This probably doesn't work because setTimeout isn't really \"pausing\" the script.\n\nHonestly at this point, I think that the best solution here is go the external function route as you suggested above.  Define a function that \"inits\" all your jQuery stuff.  Set it to run after the fallback is run and run it if no fallback is run.\n\nI don't know if it's possible, very well might not be, but adding in an `async` parameter to yepnope (who's default value is `true`) would possibly solve the problem.  Something like this:\n\n```\nyepnope([{\n    load: '//ajax.googleapisOFFLINE.com/ajaxX/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js',\n    complete: function () {\n        if (!window.jQuery) {\n            yepnope({ load: '/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js', async: false });   // async default value is true\n        }\n\n        // Do jQuery-dependent stuff here...         \n    }\n  }]);\n```\n\nI think that would be the prettiest solution.  But it might not be possible with JS, not sure... I don't know if you can \"pause\" the script until the script is loaded or not.  I don't understand all the yepnope code, but perhaps doing something with the readyState stuff in there... test it to see if it's done loading or not before going to the next script/css in the stack... not sure.\n"

I personally like the first one, unless I'm using multiple groups, in which case I mix them.\n\nyepnope _does_ separate loading and execution. That's how it can load everything all at once and execute them in order. We offer a whole plugin system through filters and prefixes that we have documented on the site. We have a 'preload' prefix that just preloads a file, but doesn't allow it to execute. Then you can execute it at anytime by just injecting it (like with `injectJS`), we do this on the yepnope website.\n\n> From all I see, you can't really control either loading or execution, but can only monitor, and even then, only the execution\n\nThis is confusing to me. You decided the order by what order you call in. You can use 'recursive yepnope' (documented on the site) in order to inject scripts into the middle of the stack, and you can stop things from executing. It seems like all of the things we mention. Let me know if something is not clear here.\n"

The reason slightly differs from library to library. As the `DOMContentLoaded`-event was missed:\n- **jQuery**: waits for the `load`-event to fire\n- **MooTools**: waits for`readyState` to become `loaded` or `complete` (via `readystatechange`-event or polling)\n- **domready**: works as this [regexp](https://github.com/ded/domready/blob/master/ready.js#L14) also matches `interactive`. Instead of only matching `loaded` or `complete`, which was the authors original intend (Compare to this [check](https://github.com/ded/domready/blob/master/ready.js#L28) and the commit history).\n\n## \n\nA few links for further reading:\n\n[W3 HTML5 Parsing](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-end.html#the-end) (DOMContentLoaded)\n[WHATWG document.readyState](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/dom.html#current-document-readiness) Scroll a bit up to the see right green box about readyState\n[MooTools' 1.4.5 DOMReady](https://github.com/mootools/mootools-core/blob/1.4.5/Source/Utilities/DOMReady.js) implementation\n[jQuery's 1.7.1 $.ready](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.7.1/src/core.js#L423-L466) implementation (There is more to `$.ready` but this is the relevant stuff)\n[**jQuery Bug Report**](http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10067) regarding `readyState === 'interactive'` and `jQuery.ready`\n[domready Bug Report](https://github.com/ded/domready/issues/12) not directly related, but in a comment [jdalton](https://github.com/ded/domready/issues/12#issuecomment-2750146) points out the regexp error\n"

Otherwise all my bugs would be browser bugs ...\n\nCall this voice of 3am. Imagine it is 3am, the production server has just awoken the on-call developer, \"Peter\", with an automatic alert that some code is failing. As it turns out, yepnope.js is not allowing 1 page's javascript load. \n\nAt this moment at 3am, \"Peter\" just wants to go back to bed (or the party). Yepnope crashed - it is yepnope that has the bug as far as \"Peter\" is concerned at 3am. At this point, \"Peter\" is cursing at \"Bob\". \"Bob\" is the developer that advocated using yepnope. \n\n\"Peter\" hacks something together to bypass yepnope and his hack works. His report on the crash blames yepnope. The next day, \"Bob\" is left trying to explain that yepnope should still be used. But no one else cares. \"Peter\" proved that yepnope was the problem by removing yepnope and the crash went away.\n\nIf yepnope pointed the \"finger of blame\" saying:  _\"It wasn't me. It was some other javascript that removed the first script element.\"_ Then at 3am Peter looks for why the firstScript element went away instead of focusing on yepnope.\n\n> > Understand that my motivation to debugging other people's code is pretty limited as well. \n> \n> I offerred my help to debug the issue in the other script because I wanted to help you\n\nSorry my poor communication here. I was referring to the wordpress code or the jquery code not you or yepnope. You are cool in this regards. I should have been more clear.\n\nBut other people's code being poorly behaved or not behaved in the way that is needed is life in the glorious world of open-source code.\n\n---\n\nBut back to the issue at hand, what also confused me was \n\n```\n  insBeforeObj = isGeckoLTE18 ? docElement : firstScript.parentNode\n```\n\nbut then in the code sometimes insBeforeObj was used and sometimes firstScript.parentNode was used.\n\nI will keep an eye out for why this firstScript was being deleted. It is driving me up the wall. AFAIK there is no way to put a breakpoint when a value changes in javascript. Am I wrong about that?\n\nSorry about the miscommunication earlier\n"

There are plenty of people with incompatible systems that can't use yepnope as well as many other open source software projects. As the maintainer, you get to draw a line for the amount of noise you're willing to accept.\n\nPersonally loading more than a couple scripts (like 3) on page load - all through yepnope - is the use-case that I'm optimizing.

You can implement it as a `filter` - via the `yepnope.addFilter` method.\n\nWe try to be religious about adding features into core, so we can keep the file size as small as possible.\n\nDoes this sound agreeable? Happy to hear arguments to the contrary. Happy to help out if the docs are lacking. We _love_ pull requests and yours is great. So good when people add tests.\n"

        "body": "@ralphholzmann - I see the same symptoms not only with Android 2.3, but also with Mobile Safari on iOS 4.2.1 and with Epiphany and Chromium on Debian Squeeze (both use older versions of WebKit). I'm using Modernizr.load to conditionally load jQuery, a hyphenation plugin for jQuery and a language pattern, if the browser supports soft hyphens but not CSS hyphens (like iOS 4.2.1 or Android's browser). It only works if I clear the cache before loading a page, on all browsers above.\n\nI see a difference when loading the page in Chromium's Timeline, with and without purged cache: when the javascript files are already in cache, there's a \"Send request\" for each, they are loaded in 0ms, but there is no \"Evaluate script\" stage after that for any of them, as it happens with an empty cache. The Modernizr.load callbacks are also not executed (I set a breakpoint in my callback, which only gets hit when the cache is empty). If I try $('p') in Chromium's Web Console, it returns an array of objects with purged cache, and null if jQuery was already in the cache - I guess Timeline tells the truth...\n\nEDIT: Tested on iPod Touch 2G running iOS 4.2.1, VirtualBox VM running Android-x86 2.3RC1 and Debian Squeeze amd64 on my EeePC. I also tested with iPhone 4 running iOS 5.1, but that works properly.\n"

        "body": "Since this is getting into the realm of Internet Explorer 7 and Windows inconsistency, there's no need to address this bug.   \n\nThis is really hard to reproduce on IE7.  I have 3 IE7 virtual machines testing, and the problem appears on only 2 of them.  The other machine shows the correct order every time!  Changing the length of the pause function seems to change the behavior too.  \n\nFor those who are doing the same thing I'm doing (multiple requests for same file in different subsets and callbacks after each set), I've tested head.js and LABjs with this.  head.js has the same problem as yepnope.js.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that LABjs works in IE7 and executes callbacks in the most efficient order.\n\nLABjs:\n\n```\nasync-js-1.js: starting execution\nasync-js-1.js: completed execution\njsCallback 1\nasync-js-2.js: starting execution\nasync-js-2.js: completed execution\njsCallback 2\nasync-js-3.js: starting execution\nasync-js-3.js: completed execution\njsCallback 1 2 3\njsCallback 3\njsCallback 1 2 3\n```\n\nI'm still testing different scenarios.\n\nNOTE: I'm NOT saying yepnope.js won't work for IE7.  It's only for my case of loading similar files and having callbacks after different interwoven chains of files.  I don't think this pattern would occur in standard pages, as I'm relying on the async loader to keep track of files loaded dynamically based on changeable content.\n"

        "body": "> It looks like the complete callback is not waiting for inner yepnope calls to complete before it fires. This is indeed a bug.\n\nDid this ever get resolved/fixed?  I think I am seeing this problem with yepnope 1.5.4 as well as Modernizr 2.5.3 (which I assume is using the same yepnope code).  Here is an example:\n\n```\nyepnope([\n    {\n        load: 'http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js',\n        callback: function(url, result, key){\n            if (!window.jQuery){yepnope('jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js');}\n        },\n        complete: function(){mft.init();}\n    },\n    {\n        test: mft.ldHS,\n        yep: 'highslide/4.1.9/highslide3.js',\n        complete: function(){mft.loadHighslide();}\n    }\n]);\n\n```\n\nmft.init() and mft.loadHighslide both depend on jQuery.  What I am observing is that if mft.ldHS is set to False, then the complete that calls mft.loadHighslide is firing **before** the complete that calls mft.init **and** also before jQuery is ready (so I get a jQuery is undefined error).  Either I'm misunderstanding how yepnope works (which is certainly possible), or things aren't working the way they are supposed to.\n\nMy expectation/interpretation is that the order should be as follows:\n- try to load jQuery from Google, and if that fails, then load local fallback;\n- once jQuery (either one) has loaded, the _complete_ fires that calls mft.init;\n- then, test mft.ldHS; if True, load highslide3.js; either way, call the _complete_ that fires mft.loadHighslide (yes, I know I'm calling this even if highslide3.js is not loaded).\n\nI'm posting this in this thread/issue because it seems like exactly what @ralphholzmann was describing (ie, the complete not waiting).  I am guessing that I can use callbacks instead of completes in the meantime, but I'd rather use completes if they can function the way (I think) they're supposed to.\n\nAny help on this would be greatly appreciated!  :-)\n"

        "body": "EVERYTHING is local in my web app, it does NO external (outside of file://android_assets/www/*) resource loading, the whole point of using phone gap was to completely package the application into a native looking app.\n\nThe strange thing is that it works from the first page and every subsequent page fine, its just if I revisit a page it stops working, its like its caching mechanism doesn't work on android. \n\nAnyway just to confirm there are no www.* calls, every resource request is made from the root of file://android_assets/www/\\* or whatever the root url is, as phonegap's root url differs from trigger.io but trigger has a method to get your assets relative for you. So I dont think the issue mentioned above would apply in this case.\n\nAlthough the page urls look something like like:\n- file://android_assets/www/index.html\n- file://android_assets/www/pages/some_page/page_2.html\n- file://android_assets/www/pages/some_page/page_3.html\n\nAnd going from page 2 to page 3 works but then going from page 3 to page 2 would not work, but they are both within the same directory container. Currently this is a blocker on my project, and there are no alternatives which allow js and css loading, as I use dynamic resource loading quite heavily in this project.\n"

A flag in `complete()` would be nice too.  \n\n I've been using yepnope to load all the scripts in a JS application I've been writing, displaying a progress bar as they complete and then displaying the application once everything is loaded. Unfortunately since `callback()` and `complete()` fire regardless of whether there was an error or not the app displays even when something fails to load. This generally breaks the app and gets really ugly when something like jQuery UI fails to load. I can usually tell when something hasn't loaded and just reload the page but some of my users may not be as perceptive about these things. It's a big enough issue that I've been considering ditching yepnope and just rewriting my loading code as a convoluted mess of `jQuery.ajax()` calls.\n"

Older versions of jQuery actually inserted a `<script>` tag although looking at the 1.8 source it looks like it now evals the script via the `globalEval` function.\n"

        "body": "Unfortunately yepnope does not do any type of non-native resource loading. It doesn't do any ajax work, which is how this would need to happen. We just inject tags (script/style) on the page.\n\nThat's why it looks like you've added entire ajax libs and stuff to the prefix. I'd suggest against this. By the time you load jQuery, it'd be better to just do raw ajax requests.\n\nIf I have to choose from those three, I'd probably say 'very bad way' - because it's just going to be slower.\n\nThanks for asking, though!\n"

We added back in the test for `isOldWebkit` and added some logic to manually trigger the `onload` callback when the file is already cached.\n\nBasically, whenever the file is cached and is loaded via an image tag on 'old webkit', the image callback will fail to trigger and the file will never load properly.\n\nWe've been using this change on our app for a while now and haven't had heard any issues with \"false starts\" (breakbase.com). It's a client-heavy app and when it would fail to load users would get stuck at our load screen.\n\nHere's a link to the changes on my fork. Let me know what you guys think and I can send a pull req (I also need to pull down and merge from upstream :x)\nhttps://github.com/mikeycgto/yepnope.js/commit/bcdc296e7811b8a2fee14b3461b4863368dc3ab7\n"

Is there any way to force re-loading and re-executing a script?\n\nExplanation:\n\nI have a one-page web-app with AJAX navigation. Some \"pages\" require specific scripts to be loaded that most others do not. I'm using yepnope.js to load the scripts for those \"pages\". When navigating away from a page with those scripts, I null the relevant JS code (for garbage-collection), and remove the script elements from the page. A problem arises when navigating back to the same page (with additional scripts) again. The scripts aren't actually re-loaded because of the logic introduced in this fix.\n\nEdit:\n\nNevermind. I see you already merged a fix in 56c016eae836a13f7b041060053b6f929f755260.\nI was using the Modernizr bundled version. Switched to the latest Git version, used reexecute in my prefixes, and all is gravy. Thanks!\n"

The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the file needs to be declared in the transfer protocol or file needs to use a byte order mark as an encoding signature.\"\n\n2) Warning: \"The character encoding of a framed document was not declared. The document may appear different if viewed without the document framing it.\"\n\nMy only concern is that for our application, we are streaming into a client's website and then use yepnope to load our dependencies. This causes the errors/warnings to display for the client site. We will refer to this thread if any \"defects\" are logged by the client for our application.\n\nI did notice that if instead, injectJs or injectCss is called one at a time on the files, these issues are avoided - but this causes a slower load time since the loads happen more sequentially.\n"

        "body": "@montlebalm I did not reply with an 'ad hominem' attack. The fact that you have _warnings_ on your site is a perfectly valid argument that warnings are an accepted part of developing websites. In fact I was stating that your website is in a good/acceptable state. It would be 'ad hominem' if I was saying that your site was _bad_ because of the warnings. The point of warnings are to point developers in the direction of something that _might_ go wrong, but they aren't _errors_.\n\nThe preloading of scripts in yepnope uses images as the mechanism. It's a hack to get things to work in every browser. Using the cache that is primed with images, yepnope can be certain that the next injection of the script will happen immediately, rather than after a network delay. You could not 'fork' yepnope and keep this behavior without doing preloading. There are other ways to do async loading in-order script execution, but they break features in yepnope. It's the exact same reason that you have a `box-sizing` warning in your CSS. Because we often add all possibilities to our CSS in order to cover all bases and make things compatible everywhere.\n\nThe warning for most people serves as a way of telling that they may not be sending the right headers for their images. However, we are well aware of the headers that we are sending for scripts are the incorrect ones for images. So you can safely ignore the warning.\n\nIf you are being 'annoyed by constant pollution of the console', then you should seriously reconsider how many scripts you are loading with yepnope. 3 or less is a best practice, and the consequences of loading more are far far more serious than a developer needing to adjust their eyes 10 to 20 pixels during a console debugging scenario.\n"

I'm debating whether to file a new bug since their new code prevents any means to detect when a stylesheet's rules have been applied to the document. (Other browsers wait to fire onload until after the rules have been applied, although this behavior is not strictly part of the w3c spec.  I don't know if you care to distinguish the difference between the time when the sheet's file is loaded and when the styles are applied.)\n\nOn the bright side, all WebKit browsers now have a working onload event so this code may not be needed any more, depending on how you want to deal with previous WebKit releases. I am about to patch my plugin to deal with the latest WebKit mess. Let me know what you want to do and I can submit a pull request for your plugin, too. \n"

I think you could end up with scenarios where the handler will be called twice if you call loadResources in rapid succession (before the resources have actually been added to the page), but overall this did the job for me. \n\n``` javascript\n\nvar loadedResources = {};\nfunction loadResources(){\n    var resources = [\"redactor.js\", \"redactor.css\"];\n    processResources(resources);\n    yepnope({\n        load: resources,\n        complete: handleResourcesLoaded\n    });\n}\nfunction handleResourcesLoaded(){\n    //do something\n}\nfunction processResources(resources){\n    var hasAllResources = true;\n    for(var i=0;i<resources.length;i++){\n        if(!loadedResources[resources[i]]){\n            hasAllResources = false;\n        }\n        loadedResources[resources[i]] = true;\n    }\n    if(hassAllResources){\n        handleResourcesLoaded();\n    }\n}\n\n```\n"

We wrote some code around `getFirstScript` to handle this for scripts I'd be happy to take a PR that either just checked and gave up or did something fancier. We are rewriting this though and it won't use objects internally anymore, so if your fix works for you, you can also just use it happily and not worry about stuff in here.\n\nThank you for the report and PR!\n"

I don't necessarily need the accuracy of when the styles are applied as long as I can know about when the stylesheet has finished loading.\n"

I never have `sheets[j].ownerNode.id == id` evaluate to true. So I was thinking something else was wrong.\n\nMoreover, with both Chrome and Firefox, I get infinite calls to `poll()`, whether I comment out the line you suggested or not. And that is probably not a good thing: it sure causes unnecessary overhead, and makes profiling an app a nightmare.\n\nHowever, I can comment out the whole poll thing, and my callbacks still get called after the stylesheets have finished loading, so I was wondering what was the goal of this piece of code. Maybe it is necessary for browsers I didn't test yet, but it would still feel strange to me to have these infinite calls to `poll()` on most browsers.\n"

        "body": "Don't worry.  Its hard to grasp async until you've gotten to the point where you really need it.  And there are probably a lot of people who can describe it better than me.  But here's the idea:\n\nWhen you load everything in order (sync), you know what is available to you because the previous file is loaded.  When you load async, you put it all out there at once, and download your assets concurrently.  The only way to know when something has returned, is by using that callback.   \n\nSo you need to delay any code that depends on jQuery until you know for a fact that jQuery has loaded.  (hence putting your new code in the callback).\n\nSo for your example:  (I removed all the extra code so you can focus on the idea)\n\n```\nyepnope([{\n  load: 'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js',\n  complete: function () {\n     // add any code using jQuery in here\n     $(document.body).append('<p>jQuery is loaded!</p>'); \n   }\n}]);\n```\n\nHope that helps.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, StackOverflow is perfect for questions like this.  Devs will expect Issues in here to be possible bugs in the codebase...\n\nBest of luck.\n"

Your use case is fine, but an if statement works just as nicely:\n\n``` js\nif (window.Intl) yepnope.injectJs('js/intl.js');\n```\n\nThe `IntlPolyfill` should probably recommend a different method than they currently are. The actual nicer scenario is bundling `intl.js` with your main build for users that need it:\n\n``` js\nyepnope('js/app.js', {\n  intl: window.Intl\n}, function() {\n  console.log(new Intl.DateTimeFormat(...).format(new Date()));\n});\n```\n\nThis would request either: `js/app.js?yep=intl` or `js/app.js?nope=intl`\n\nYou could then potentially handle serving the correct file depending on those urls (which can look different with a different formatter).\n\nHope that helps!\n"

You're welcome to grab the previous version and use it. A deprecation warning generally means that the old libraries still work, but that it's no longer going to be worked on.\n\nThe master branch has a version of yepnope that's more in line with what you _should_ be doing, but also isn't a maintained, suggested library. Modernizr points you at the yepnope library in case you need backwards compatibility, not as a suggested solution. Use a build tool.\n\nIf the docs are poor, please, by all means feel free to contribute back more clear updates.\n"
