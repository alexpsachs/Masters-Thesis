As of now, whenever I write \"3\", I end up with \"j\", \"J\", \"_\" or another character as often as \"3\", \"1\" produces \"I\", \"6\" produces \"b\" etc. If there was no \"j\", \"J\" og \"b\" in the \"baseline\", ocrad would not mix it up as often?\n\nAnd it may be that I misunderstand what you mean on using regex.replace on the output. Do you mean ie. to manually replace all instances of \"j\", \"J\" with \"3\" and all instances of \"b\" with 6, and so on? Wouldn't reducing ocrad.js (in some way) be more effective programming?\n\nAll I (initially) want it to detect is \"1234567890\". Later I may want to expand to \"+-*/:\".\n\nIs it possible to strip ocrad down like this in an easy way?\n"

        "body": "@antimatter15 Thanks, yes I've tried it but it's mis-identifying the numbers since they do look quite a bit like other characters.  `8`, for example, appears often as a `B`.  If I could re-train the analysis, I think there'd be a lot more accurate detection.\r\n\r\nI'm just getting started with this, so I'm not sure how to make my own dataset for Tesseract, but I'll continue looking into it.  Thank you for your advice!"
