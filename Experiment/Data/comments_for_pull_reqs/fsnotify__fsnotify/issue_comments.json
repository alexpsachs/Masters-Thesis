        "body": "> Godoc is a relatively small program. It is built from 102 packages built from 582 source files. We certainly want to be able to build programs larger than godoc. It appears that Linux inotify will let you watch individual directories for changes within that directory, so for godoc you are looking at a little over 102 inotify watches. For OS X, fsevents will let you watch whole subtrees, so for godoc built from 1 GOROOT and 1 GOPATH entry you are looking at 2 fsevents watches.  For Microsoft Windows, FindFirstChangeNotification looks like it might be usable similar to fsevents. For Solaris, file event notifications (FEN) only apply to individual files or directories, and watching a directory inode does not appear to tell you about modifications made to files in that directory, so for godoc you are looking at almost 700 FEN watches. That might take a little while to set up, but assuming the kernel has no hard limits, it should be fine. Speaking of limits... For BSD (or OS X if you don't like fsevents), kqueue has the same \"enumerate every file or directory\" requirement as Solaris FEN, but you give them to the kernel not as file names but as file descriptors. It appears that the file descriptor must remain open while you are watching that file, so the per-process file descriptor limit imposes a limit on the number of things you can watch. Worse, the per-system file descriptor limit imposes a limit on the number of things anyone on the system can watch. The typical kernel limit on a BSD is only on the order of 10,000 file descriptors for the entire machine. - @rsc, https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-dev/bShm2sqbrTY/IR8eI20Su8EJ \n- The limits for FEN (Solaris) are high enough (#12) that a recursive watcher should be possible.\n- It's possible that kqueue (BSD, iOS) can't reasonably support a recursive watcher. For large trees, users may need to resort to Polling (#9) or another mechanism.\n"

        "body": "It seems that there are two major use cases to use a Watcher:\n1. Watch very few individual files, e.g. config files for hot reload\n2. Watch a folder, e.g., a \"Queue\" folder in which the user copies images/logs to be processed by the app and moved to an output folder\n\nNumber 1 suffers from said problem. I don't know specifics of OS implementations wrt efficiency, but it seems that setting up a \"Delete\" watcher which checks if the file is recreated and automatically sets up a new OS watcher for the new file would do the trick. To my knowledge, Move Operations are atomic in all decent file systems (I know they are in NTFS, I don't know or care if they are in FAT32/exFAT), but I don't know if a move can overwrite or if it's required to delete first and then move/rename. In that case, the watcher could be setup on the directory, equipped with a timer that checks every few ms and is automatically deleted if the file isn't coming back after let's say 1s. That works for small files, but let's say the file is a gigabyte in size, I don't know if that would work (then again, I don't know how often a hot-reload-watcher would be used on a large file)\n\nI feel that a \"persistent write timer\" is more a high level utility construct: Allow me to specify how long the timer stays alive to re-check for file creation. In fact, I wonder if it's best to have fsnotify be a small layer of abstraction on top of the OS watcher - warts/gotchas and all - and then have a \"Utility\" for high level stuff. That way, the (what I consider) common use case of hot-reloading a tiny config file that's created within a second of a delete is trivial, but someone who wants something \"weird\" (like hot reloading gigabyte-sized files that are using copy-on-save) still has low level access.\n"

Ensure that the OS API (inotify, etc) watches are removed automatically on all platforms (may just work, like it does for inotify)\n2. Automatically delete removed paths from `w.watches`, which is not even possible to do manually (from a client) right now because of #40.\n"

I've tried with a slightly larger (booking) - no issue. But with our code I still have the issue.\n\nI tried the following with our app with an instrumented revel watcher[1]:\n1. Launch the app. `revel run ourapp`\n2. Go to /robots.txt and wait for revel to rebuild and serve the file.\n3. Without touching any files of the project, refresh the browser (f5) and see what happens.\n\nWith the kqueue branch (71b4293) I got this output the first time I tried:\nhttp://paste2.org/MaDA2xsn\nand this the second time:\nhttp://paste2.org/Ih9zspp4\n\nSo it behaves differently in two different runs even though I'm doing the exact same thing. :cry: \n\nThen I switched back to the master branch (ca50e738d3) and I consistently get the following:\nhttp://paste2.org/Fmm6pvVn\n\nSo with the master branch there are no rebuilds triggered by changes to `tmp/main.go` or `routes/routes.go`. With master the only events are the folder changes to `app/tmp` and `app/routes`. Can this give you any clue?\n\n[1] Where https://github.com/revel/revel/blob/develop/watcher.go#L174-L176 was changed to this:\n\n```\ncase ev := <-watcher.Events:\n    fmt.Println(\"ev\", ev.String())\n    if w.rebuildRequired(ev, listener) {\n        fmt.Println(\"rb\", ev.String())\n        refresh = true\n```\n"

        "body": "Hi Otto. Sorry for not digging into this sooner. I've never used Revel before, but I got the booking sample running with some additional logging (on the develop branch).\n\nYour previous bisect had pointed to 4a0d1ae9df8c61fb8912829fc714f189358a3dc7 being the culprit. Most of those changes are to addWatch, so I added some logging there and compared against ca50e738d35a862c379baf8fffbc3bfd080b3cff. With the result you're seeing, it seems plausible that it was watching more than it was previously. \n\nSo far I haven't figured it out. Still digging. It might be worth confirming that bisect, since you said it wasn't 100% reproducible. If it was a commit before, that could change things quite a lot.\n\nIf there was a medium sized open source Revel app that we could reproduce this on, that would make it much easier. It might even be reproducible with a similar file structure to your app, even if those files don't contain the same code. /cc @robfig \n"

Personally, I still haven't had a chance to learn the various Linux APIs nor have I been able to attract others to help code review and maintain the project.\n\nIf you're interested in helping make some smaller incremental improvements, I'd certainly be grateful. Right now I'm trying to focus on **cleaning up the code** (see 1f65e2ef12aa538ba66b432a0c60279f4406add1) so that lower-level concerns are more isolated.\n\nI'm also trying to get an [fslog project](https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/issues/23) going to help better understand the behaviour of each OS.\n\nThanks for all your work. Nathan.\n"

I added some logging into addWatch in kqueue.go.\n\nkqueue.go is maintaining some internal state to map back and forth between filenames and descriptors. If it's a file descriptor that is already being watched, it can modifies what flags are being watched. This is something used internally.\n\nWhen a rename or remove event is fired, it calls the exported `Remove()` method to do some cleanup. For whatever reason it's sending the event on the channel and then doing the cleanup.\n\nThat's been this way since I adopted the code. Flipping those around makes sense to me.\n"

There's a truly awesome race condition that happens :D\n\nI was wondering how it could be possible that sometimes, test n was making test n+1 fail with \"bad file descriptor\" or with the wrong number of events.\n\nWhat happens is that when you've got a goroutine waiting for events, it's possible to close it and create a new one, before other goroutines have a chance to respond. But since the previous descriptor was closed, the new inotify file descriptor will have the same number as the previous one, which will then get closed once the previous test's goroutines wake up and close their stuff.\n\nSo, yeah. From now on, Close waits for the readEvents goroutine to finish.\n"

For example, `vim`:\n\n```\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 event: \"./foo.txt\": RENAME\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 event: \"./foo.txt~\": CREATE\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 event: \"./foo.txt\": CREATE\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 event: \"./foo.txt\": WRITE\n2015/03/25 23:18:42 modified file: ./foo.txt\n```\n\nIt seems like the most compatible strategy is to listen to the directory and only pay attention to events matching the file name, but it's not clear which event types to listen to. Just `fsevents.Write` is enough for vim. For many other editors, `IN_MOVE_TO` is needed.\n"

My preference is to keep a minimal API surface with the bitfields exposed for checking, coalescing, etc. This is based on the design document mentioned in the README.\n\nIf you wants additional methods like this, it's easy enough to convert to a new type and provide them there.\n\nAn article on how to do this (and how bitfields work) would be a better approach IMO.

        "body": "Ok I found this issue in this package. At https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/inotify.go#L280 because the `e.Name` will not be filled, the `Lstat()` returns an error that `os.IsNotExist()` returns true for and the event is skipped.\n\nSince the overflow event is critical it needs to get into the user code. If nothing else (see below), I vote that a special check `if mask&syscall.IN_Q_OVERFLOW == syscall.IN_Q_OVERFLOW { return false }` is put in at the top of the method. This will end up as the default value of Event that comes across the user channel.\n\nActually changing the `if !(e.Op&Remove == Remove || e.Op&Rename == Rename) { }` to a white list instead of a negative would have avoid this issue in the first place. Overflow is not the only special event that could come through. \n\nI am very dubious about ignoring any of these events. That method says in a comment that it is there because it saw a write come through after a delete event, how could that happen?\n"

        "body": "Hi. So far this issue has just been a place to collect information about USN. Nobody has begun implementing support for it is fsnotify.\n\nTo support USN directly in fsnotify, I think we'll need a driver system where people can choose between ReadDirectoryChangesW or USN much like choosing a MySQL or Postgres driver. To start, my suggestion would be to build up a stand-alone USN package and then we'll figure out how to integrate it.\n\nThat could be as a subfolder of this repository or a separate repository (I'm happy to create a repo under the go-fsnotify organization if desired).\n\nThere's also plenty of clean up work to do on the current Windows support.\nhttps://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify/labels/Windows%20%28ReadDirectoryChangesW%29\n\nThanks\n"

While editors like GNU nano triggers the WRITE event, other editors like Vim and GNOME gedit first save the changes to a temporary file, then moving the tempfile to replace the original file, triggering a REMOVE event before a CREATE or WRITE event, but the CREATE or WRITE event was never detected because the watcher quits prematurely!\n\nPlease see spf13/viper#142 for more details.\n\nIf that is the case, I don't think this bug is \"OS X (kqueue)\"-specific.  Rather, if the \"When a REMOVE event happens, it stops watching that file\" behaviour is \"as-designed\", perhaps that design needs to be changed.\n\nMany thanks for looking into this.\n"

IOW, if you want to\npause one, at least only run your pause when Len() is zero or less than\nsome threshold.\n\nThis would often be as part of a heuristic, therefore if a particular\nbackend always buffers internally and this number isn't available for\ninspection, and thus always returns 0 for the length, this isn't the end of\nthe world as long as it's documented.\n\nThanks again,\nJames\n"

This is how inotify works, and I don't think fsnotify should \"write some custom code\" to get around it.\n\nBut with this PR, this means that BSD != Linux in the single file case, and that is maybe worth a thought. Should it? \n\nIf they should work the same, this patch (excluding test) will be reduced to the `err == nil` conditional..\n"

So in summary:\n- EpollPwait needs to be added to x/sys by us or someone. https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10235\n- We need to switch to x/sys for fsnotify (on Linux at least) and mention it in the README and release notes.\n- We should look into ARM based continuous integration (the Go team is using some custom stuff running on https://www.scaleway.com/)\n\nWe can switch to InotifyInit1 at anytime, which I believe is available in the standard library sys package. It may require a slightly newer Linux kernel, but that's fine so long as the README indicates the requirements. Feel free to prepare a pull request for that if you like.\n"

That said, if no one else has fixed it in a month or two, I would be interested to experiment with it and see if I could come up with a preliminary patch.  :-)\n\nYou have a good point there about InotifyInit1().  Since it would require a newer kernel (Linux 2.6.27?), and it is working fine for all architectures anyway, I think I've better leave it alone, as in \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\".  :wink:\n"

        "body": "Thanks James. As to your question, if someone does a `go get github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify` the code should compile and build without needing to go generate anything. \n\nThis applies even more so to a library. For example, if you `go get github.com/spf13/hugo` which depends on fsnotify, it would fail to build until you run go generate on the fsnotify dependency. If multiple libraries did that it would be a total nightmare for users.\n\nIt's also what the Go team recommends, and I trust their recommendations, because they have a lot more experience than me. https://blog.golang.org/generate\n"

When a \"WRITE\" event is fired (it fires three times btw, don't know if this is normal) I decode the content of each file and put that content in a db. So quite heavy work.

This is also why my XML decoder errored with EOF. \n\nI just use a normal directory. To trigger the WRITE event I just copy the files to the watched folder. Hope it helps, if you need any other info please let me know.\n\nWhen I use FTP (on Windows) with a slow connection speed and I read the file on the first WRITE event, the file is not complete. This makes the XML decoder fail.\n"

So, if you had `test.txt`, the fileInfo stores the path to `test.txt`. After renaming it to `test2.txt`, using `os.Lstat()` on the new file stores the path as `test2.txt`. When you do a comparison with `os.Samefile()`, it sees that the file paths for the 2 `FileInfo`s are different and returns false.\n"

After adding some tracing to the code, here's what I'm seeing (both on Linux 3.4.43 and 4.1.18):\n\nWhen `Remove()` is called on a `Watcher`, it now `Wait()`s on a condition variable after calling `syscall.InotifyRmWatch()`.  The condition variable is notified from `ignoreLinux()`, at the point that we see an `Event` with the `IN_IGNORED` bit set.  This seems reasonable as the [man page for `inotify_rm_watch`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_rm_watch.2.html) says:\n\n> Removing a watch causes an `IN_IGNORED` event to be generated for this watch descriptor.\n\nHowever I'm seeing that in two of my unit tests sometimes (more than 50% of the time) there is no `IN_IGNORED` event that follows the call to `syscall.InotifyRmWatch()`.  I verified that `syscall.InotifyRmWatch()` doesn't return any error.  There is just no event on the watch descriptor that was passed to `syscall.InotifyRmWatch()`.\n\nHas anybody seen this before?\n"

Maybe they will have some insight into why it's failing.\n"

The readEvents goroutine checks the done channel before the read, so if Close happens to signal done in time then readEvents will exit cleanly and close the Events and Errors channels. If the signal comes after the check, then it'll just hang unless a new event happens to make its way through and restart the loop.\n\nThis is a stack trace where fsnotify hangs:\n\n```\ngoroutine 90 [syscall]:\nsyscall.Syscall(0x0, 0x9, 0xc8204bbe40, 0x10000, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)\n  third_party/go/gc/src/syscall/asm_linux_amd64.s:18 +0x5\nsyscall.read(0x9, 0xc8204bbe40, 0x10000, 0x10000, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)\n  third_party/go/gc/src/syscall/zsyscall_linux_amd64.go:776 +0x5f\nsyscall.Read(0x9, 0xc8204bbe40, 0x10000, 0x10000, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)\n  third_party/go/gc/src/syscall/syscall_unix.go:161 +0x4d\nthird_party/golang/fsnotify/fsnotify.(*Watcher).readEvents(0xc82035e680)\n  third_party/golang/fsnotify/inotify.go:144 +0x13f\ncreated by third_party/golang/fsnotify/fsnotify.NewWatcher\n  third_party/golang/fsnotify/inotify.go:47 +0x365\n```\n"

That fix was made to Go 1.7.\n\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/22207/\n\nBut the Go team allowed the patch to be rolled back to Go 1.6.2 which is due out today: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/15288\n\nRiku took a different approach, revising [golang.org/x/sys/unix](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix) and switching fsnotify to use it.\n\nAt this point it probably makes the most sense to apply @laboger's change to x/sys/unix as well. That way fsnotify won't require Go 1.6.2 for ppc.\n\nI don't know if @suihkulokki's change could have been made to syscall instead, but at this point it's probably too late to make the change there, and still get it in to Go 1.6.2.\n"

I haven't tested this particular case myself.\n\nAs far as the events passed, how are you changing the file? That may be related to how a text editor makes the change. See #17.\n\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish? If you need to detect changes to files on the Windows host, as seems to be the case, you will most likely need to watch the files in Windows and then trigger whatever action you need.\n\nIf instead you are looking to watch files inside the vagrant box, it's best to use a directory that isn't shared from the Windows host, as that usually won't work (as you've seen).\n"

I've spent more time than I am happy to admit realizing that this is what seems to have caused a huge regression in https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/. I realized it was the fsnotify code causing the problem, and eventually found this ticket.\n\nI haven't added a workaround to my code yet, and instead will use an older version of this lib for now, but this is a very real problem. I don't completely understand the fix, so patches and hints welcome :)\n\nFWIW I hit the hang here:\nhttps://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/master/inotify.go#L158\n"

        "body": "This is normal because there is an upper limit for queued iNotify events. See `man inotify` for more information on this.\n\nFrom the manual :\n\n```\n   /proc interfaces\n       The following interfaces can be used to limit the amount of kernel mem\u2010\n       ory consumed by inotify:\n\n       /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events\n              The  value  in  this file is used when an application calls ino\u2010\n              tify_init(2) to set an upper limit on the number of events  that\n              can  be queued to the corresponding inotify instance.  Events in\n              excess of this limit are dropped, but an IN_Q_OVERFLOW event  is\n              always generated.\n\n       /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances\n              This specifies an upper limit on the number of inotify instances\n              that can be created per real user ID.\n\n       /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches\n              This specifies an upper limit on the number of watches that  can\n              be created per real user ID.\n```\n\nand also\n\n```\n       Note that the event queue can overflow.  In this case, events are lost.\n       Robust applications should handle the possibility of lost events grace\u2010\n       fully.   For example, it may be necessary to rebuild part or all of the\n       application cache.  (One simple, but possibly expensive, approach is to\n       close  the  inotify file descriptor, empty the cache, create a new ino\u2010\n       tify file descriptor, and then re-create watches and cache entries  for\n       the objects to be monitored.)\n```\n\nSo, considering your particular use case, I suggest you increase the value of `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events` to avoid hitting the queue limit. It is a \"limitation\" of the `fsnotify` library to not inform users of dropped events due to queue overflow. \n"

But if the goroutine was doing something else, there is a time gap where the kernel can reuse the fd so that when the goroutine reaches the read it will be performed on the reassigned fd. You may then read from a file or a socket. \nEven if you add a bool flag that you test just before performing the read, there will still be a time gap between the test and the read where the Close can be performed and the fd reused by the kernel.  \nThis implies thus that another mechanism is used to inform the goroutine that it must stop. The use of epoll or equivalent is then required. \n"

It is possible to remove the watch but by using the name used to register the directory.\n\nThe problem is due to a limitation of inotify. \n\nOne of the consequences of a rename/move of a watched dir is that the returned path is invalid. So you may be informed of modifications inside the directory, but you wouldn't be able to access the files to get the stats for instance because the path is wrong. It requires more work to properly keep track of subdirectory moves. \n"

        "body": "For me, the biggest issue was that I'm running this as a longer running daemon, so cleanup was something that was a problem. It seemed as though I was leaving the watcher active (`gocode` process on OS X) which needed to have the following:\n\n```\nc := make(chan os.Signal, 1)\nsignal.Notify(c, os.Interrupt)\ngo func() {\n    for _ = range c {\n        fmt.Println(\"\")\n        logrus.Infoln(\"Cleaning up...\")\n        doneWatch <- true\n        done <- true\n    }\n}()\n```\n\nThis then sent the messages to close the watcher and close any open channels. Once I added that, I didn't run into any more gocode running after ctrl+c ended the application running.\n\nThe second thing for me which was unclear from the example was what the purpose of the done channel was since it was a bit too simplistic for me to really be able to use as a template to really base my code on. I made a more generic version to show what I was using the watch event for if it helps understand the situation.\n\nhttps://github.com/kkirsche/notify-git/blob/master/cmd/root.go\n\nLastly, I had to exit the goroutine on the above done event, or else the watcher would catch a ton (near infinite it seemed) <nil> errors / \"\" events. For this reason I'd have the done channel also exit the background goroutine in case they do any debug messaging to avoid flooding stdout. \n\nI guess my takeaways were that it would be nice to include cleanup code in the example, and provide a more \"complete\" implementation that leverages the done channel.\n\nPotentially it'd also be helpful to have a wiki page of known programs that don't trigger write events to avoid the \"hm, why doesn't vim editing the file work?\"\n\nDoes that help?\n"

Specifying this flag permits a program to avoid additional fcntl(2) F_SETFD operations to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag. Additionally, use of this flag is essential in some multithreaded programs since using a separate fcntl(2) F_SETFD operation to set the FD_CLOEXEC flag does not suffice to avoid race conditions where one thread opens a file descriptor at the same time as another thread does a fork(2) plus execve(2).\n\nfsnotify currently uses InotifyInit (not InotifyInit1).\n\n> inotify_init() first appeared in Linux 2.6.13; library support was added to glibc in version 2.4.\n> inotify_init1() was added in Linux 2.6.27; library support was added to glibc in version 2.9.\n\nThis is fine (IMO).\n\nWhat about support on ARM and PPC64? /cc @suihkulokki @TheTincho @clnperez @laboger @tophj-ibm?\n"

        "body": "I can't find a reliable / general way to work around this bug.\n- I'm watching a directory `foo` and my goal is to recursively watch the tree under `foo`.\n- I delete and re-create a subdirectory `foo/bar` repeatedly in rapid succession.\n- After a few iterations, I see a `REMOVE` event being emitted, followed by a `CREATE` event immediately thereafter.\n- When my code handles the `REMOVE` event, I need to call `Remove(\"foo/bar\")`, but I can't do so from whichever goroutine is receiving the event from fsnotify due this bug.  So I defer to another goroutine to call `Remove()` for me.\n- My code then handles the `CREATE` event and attempts to re-watch this directory by calling `Add(\"foo/bar\")`.\n\nNow we have two goroutines executing `Add(\"foo/bar\")` and `Remove(\"foo/bar\")` concurrently.  Let's say that `Add()` goes in first.  In `Add()` we have a first critical section:\n\n``` go\n    w.mu.Lock()\n    watchEntry, found := w.watches[name]\n    w.mu.Unlock()\n```\n\nin this scenario, `found` is `true`, because the goroutine calling `Remove()` hasn't gotten around to doing anything yet.  Then we issue the system call without holding the lock, followed by another critical section:\n\n``` go\n    wd, errno := unix.InotifyAddWatch(w.fd, name, flags)\n    if wd == -1 {\n        return errno\n    }\n\n    w.mu.Lock()\n    w.watches[name] = &watch{wd: uint32(wd), flags: flags}\n    w.paths[wd] = name\n    w.mu.Unlock()\n```\n\nNow while I'm in the system call, the `Remove()` goroutine starts to do its thing:\n\n``` go\n    w.mu.Lock()\n    defer w.mu.Unlock()\n    watch, ok := w.watches[name]\n```\n\nSo here `ok` is `true` as well and now `Remove()` will run to completion because it only releases the lock once it's done via the `defer` statement.  So it'll execute:\n\n``` go\n    success, errno := unix.InotifyRmWatch(w.fd, watch.wd)\n```\n\nAnd then it'll go in this loop that waits for the watch to be removed by the fsnotify goroutine:\n\n``` go\n    exists := true\n    for exists {\n        w.cv.Wait()\n        _, exists = w.watches[name]\n    }\n```\n\nWhen we go in `Wait()`, the lock is released, and `Add()` finishes, overwriting the entry in the maps with a different value for `wd` than before.\n\nMeanwhile fsnotify is trying to deliver the next event (which isn't, yet, the `IN_IGNORED` event required to unblock the `Remove()` call), but it's blocked trying to send on the `w.Events` channel because my code is trying to finish handling the previous `Add()`, which requires sending a message on a channel to the goroutine that is stuck in `Remove()`.\n\nBasically it seems that the only safe way to call `Remove()` is by doing `go watcher.Remove(path)`, but this creates other problems like not knowing exactly when I'm done removing a watch before I add another one.\n\nI'd like to see the code of a reliable recursive watch with fsnotify.  Currently I believe it's not possible to implement due to this bug (and due to #97, but that's another issue).\n"

Maybe filesystem interface also will change.\nI'll help you as much as possible.\n"

I'm thinking of putting that in a separate repo with a test suite and documentation and making that into it's own library that fsnotify depends on. \n\nStill many details to work out though -- and certainly open to other ideas.\n"

(2) That I can do, if people need it. It's pretty easy to expand up to 32 Ops.\r\n\r\n@nathany The ugly part about exposing the mask is that, how it's written now, the watcher is filtering the notifications by those agnosticEvents, and we would need either to remove this part, or have a flags parameter. The first option will generate a lot of unwanted messages, the second option would make the fsnotify less cross-platform code friendly.\r\n\r\nI read that part about the spin-off. It's a great idea, but I saw that the project is empty. If someone who knows what they're doing (not me) would put the basic code there, I'd try to expand it with any functionality I need.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I think should change in the spin-off is how the Op is defined. It's pretty nice to do bit operations, but it constrains the numbers of Ops we can have."

This also implies that `unix.IN_MASK_ADD` is not needed at all. However, this is a different story... \r\n\r\nOverall, this PR is an improvement of current logic."

        "body": "Clearly I have been doing a poor job of maintaining fsnotify. Issues without answers, pull requests left open for months... progress has stalled not due to lack of contributors, but because I am currently the bottleneck.\r\n\r\nWhen I got involved with Chris Howey's fsnotify, it was to help out with the API. I don't have the experience and knowledge of file systems necessary to vet a pull request like #124, which adds epoll to kqueue. Much less take on a whole new platform like #196. At first I thought I would learn these things, but doing so hasn't been a priority in what spare time I do have.\r\n\r\nI had hoped that having a generous policy (#126) for granting commit access combined with this call for maintainers would see a team of people volunteer to help maintain fsnotify. I had high hopes for splitting responsibility by operating system to make maintenance more palatable. But that hasn't happened... and I don't know what needs to be done for that to happen.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I am tired of feeling guilty for not being more involved in the project. I'm also tired of worrying that merging a pull request will break an upstream like Docker or a platform that isn't under CI (#136).\r\n\r\nI haven't been very involved lately, so it's time to make it official. I'm stepping away from the fsnotify project. It's up to you now.\r\n\r\nIf you need something from me during the transition, reach out to me here or on #fsnotify on [Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/). Good luck.\r\n"

        "body": "What is happening here is that Linux's inotify actually delivers two notifications when a file is deleted. It first sends `IN_ATTRIB` to indicate that the number of file links have been decremented, and follows up by `IN_DELETE_SELF` to indicate that the file is deleted from disk. When some process is has open handles to the file, the file is not actually deleted from disk until all open handles are closed, and thus the second notification is also delayed. But fsnotify propagates only the second notification and [drops](https://github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/blob/fd9ec7deca8bf46ecd2a795baaacf2b3a9be1197/inotify.go#L310) the first one after statting the file name and seeing it gone.\r\n\r\nHere is a `go test` for this.\r\n```go\r\nfunc TestInotifyDeleteOpenFile(t *testing.T) {\r\n\ttestDir := tempMkdir(t)\r\n\tdefer os.RemoveAll(testDir)\r\n\r\n\ttestFile := filepath.Join(testDir, \"testfile\")\r\n\r\n\thandle, err := os.Create(testFile)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\tt.Fatalf(\"Create failed: %v\", err)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tw, err := NewWatcher()\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\tt.Fatalf(\"Failed to create watcher: %v\", err)\r\n\t}\r\n\tdefer w.Close()\r\n\r\n\terr = w.Add(testFile)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\tt.Fatalf(\"Failed to add watch for %s: %v\", testFile, err)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\terr = os.Remove(testFile)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\tt.Fatalf(\"Failed to remove %s: %v\", testFile, err)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tvar event Event\r\n\r\n\tfunc() {\r\n\t\tdefer handle.Close()\r\n\r\n\t\tselect {\r\n\t\tcase event = <-w.Events:\r\n\t\tcase <-time.After(100 * time.Millisecond):\r\n\t\t\tt.Fatalf(\"Expected event not delivered\")\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}()\r\n\r\n\tif event.Op != Remove {\r\n\t\tt.Fatalf(\"Expected event type %s, got: %v\", Remove, event.Op)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tw.Close()\r\n\r\n\t// Wait for the close to complete.\r\n\ttime.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)\r\n\tisWatcherReallyClosed(t, w)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see a few options for dealing with this, none of them perfect:\r\n 1. Convert the `IN_ATTRIB` notification into `Remove` for files which do not show up on disk. This will cause fsnotify to always deliver two `Remove` notifications. That may break some existing clients.\r\n 2. Deliver the `Chmod` notification even for files that do not appear on disk anymore. This will allow clients at least some notification about what's happening with the file. This will probably also affect some clients but I believe fewer are checking `Chmod` events than `Delete` ones.\r\n 3. Introduce a special watching mode that will treat open files correctly. This will require addition to the API."

From https://github.com/camlistore/go4/#details:\r\n\r\n> CLA compliant contributors must agree to the Google CLA (the same as Go itself). This ensures we can move things into Go as necessary in the future. It also makes lawyers at various companies happy. The CLA is not a copyright assignment; you retain the copyright on your work. The CLA just says that your work is open source and you have permission to open source it. See https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html#tmp_6\r\n\r\nHere are the instructions from @willnorris. I suspect we will want the CLA checking for the whole organization, including fsevents or any new repos created. The fsnotify.org website doesn't really need it, but why not.\r\n\r\n>Here's the instructions to enable CLA checking for fsnotify.  You can do it either at the organization level, in which case it will apply to all repos in the org, or just to the individual repos you want it activated for.  The same webhook secret will work in either case.\r\n\r\n>1. Give googlebot write access to the repos.  Adding as an outside collaborator is fine, or you can add the account to the org if you don't want to setup each repo individually.  Up to you.  Write access is needed in order to set commit statuses and issue labels.\r\n\r\n>2. If you want googlebot to set issue labels, go ahead and create the labels \"cla: yes\" and \"cla: no\".  If you don't care about the labels, and will just check for the commit status, then just don't create them and googlebot won't try to add them.\r\n\r\n>3. Add a new webhook to the org or repo:\r\n\r\n>Payload URL: https://cla.developers.google.com/api/github/webhook\r\n>Content type: application/json\r\n>Secret: [elided, ask]\r\n>Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?\r\n>Select \"Let me select individual events\" and then select only \"Issue comment\" and \"Pull Request\".\r\n>Active: this should be checked\r\n\r\n>That should be it.\r\n\r\n>Most of the time it should go pretty smoothly.  The one edge case that we don't handle well is when someone is submitting a PR containing commits that they did not author themselves.  In that case, the comment from googlebot should hopefully explain the situation pretty well.  It's a case where we rely on a human being (you) to do a little bit of legwork and go ahead and merge the commit, even though the official status from googlebot says that things aren't okay.  I've got a feature request outstanding to try and handle this case better.\r\n"

        "body": "I'm not the author, but Solaris requires use of cgo, in general, since libc is the provider of system interfaces.  The only other comment I would add is that this should be using golang.org/x/sys/unix instead of syscall.  Per the official Go documentation, use of syscall outside of the Go standard runtime has been deprecated since 1.4:\r\n\r\n> NOTE: This package is locked down. Code outside the standard Go repository should be migrated to use the corresponding package in the golang.org/x/sys repository. That is also where updates required by new systems or versions should be applied. See https://golang.org/s/go1.4-syscall for more information. \r\nhttps://golang.org/pkg/syscall/\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this should work on commercial releases of Solaris, although I haven't tried it myself.  It appears to be using functionality shared between Solaris and OpenSolaris-based derivatives such as Illumos/SmartOS."

        "body": "Forgive any mistakes here, I'm very new to Go.  For this kind of code there seems to be a good justification for using the C pass through interfaces.  Probably lots of things don't have native Go interfaces yet.  Using \"syscall\" is another matter.  It's explicitly deprecated.  I see two places where syscall is used explicitly in the code.  1) It's used to access the enumeration of errno values.  When I visit x/sys/unix, it says that the official place to get errno values from is syscall.Errno.  (Check the top of https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix) So that seems legitimate.  2) The other place it's used is to access the C structure for stat_t.  The code starts by using os.FileInfo, then goes through Sys() to get the stat_t.  It does this because the FileInfo doesn't include atime or ctime members. (access time / create time).  Only mtime (modification time) is available through FileInfo according to the docs.  So I don't see any way the code could be changed to avoid the existing uses of syscall.\r\n\r\nIn theory you could argue that atime and ctime should be added FileInfo, but that seems like a change that should take into account the availability of those interfaces on other platforms.  I'm not sure how widely they're supported on all the Go platforms.  It doesn't seem appropriate to ask the submitter to take that on at this point.\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind, I don't see any issues with the use of cgo or syscall.\r\n\r\nI also ran the fsnotify package test on x86 Oracle Solaris (latest internal build) with the bundled Go 1.5, and it passed.  I also ran it on the same Solaris build on SPARC with the latest sparc compiler from https://github.com/4ad/go/tree/sparc64.go1.8 and it passed.\r\n\r\nI'm not that familiar with file events in Solaris, but if additional code review is what's holding this up, I can find an Oracle Solaris engineer who is familiar with file events to check over the logic.  They won't be familiar with Go, but they could vouch for the usage of Solaris interfaces.\r\n\r\n"

For example, on GNU/Linux, inotify is taking the info from the inode of the file, and not the file name. If a file is deleted and it is created again, it may have a different inode.\r\n\r\nIf you really need to closely watch a certain file, always check its parent directory. And to be 100% sure you should check all the parents until the root directory. If you don't need this kind of precision, you can just do enable a timer/ticker when a file is deleted and check from time to time when it appears again and recreate the watcher."

I added more robust support for cancellation to fix a race condition exhibited by the TestWatcherClose test, and I altered the interpretation of FEN events to more accurately implement fsnotify's expected behavior, as well as other small improvements.\r\n\r\nI intend to submit a new pull request for this work. Given that my request would still substantially contain your code, how would you like to be credited? I could add you to the `AUTHORS` file or anything else you might prefer. Thanks!\r\n\r\nTo everyone else on this thread - I would be happy to provide additional resources for testing fsnotify on SmartOS. Please let me know!"

        "body": "I've discovered a bug in the current implementation under review:\r\n\r\nThe `port_associate` function accepts a pointer to an object describing the entity being watched. `port_get,` when returning from an event, returns _the same pointer_ as the `portev_object` member of the `port_event_t` struct returned from `port_get`. Thus, if the event-handling code uses this pointer to retrieve information about the file affected (as we currently do), it must still point to valid memory.\r\n\r\nIn `associateFile`, we construct a `file_obj` and pass a pointer to it to `port_associate`. The Go runtime can relocate or garbage-collect this `file_obj`, rendering the pointer invalid. We thus may get garbage data back when we retrieve the object upon returning from `port_get`.\r\n\r\nThis bug does not manifest in the test suite, as there is not enough memory churn to trigger an overwrite of the `file_obj` memory. I discovered it when running Prometheus on SmartOS using fsnotify to watch config files.\r\n\r\nI'll have a fix committed by tomorrow (2018-09-06) at noon PST."

Here are some considerations before merging this.\r\n\r\nI'm not personally willing to take on the responsibility of supporting Solaris and FEN myself, setting up CI, or any of that. What I'd like to see is yourself, but preferably multiple people, taking ownership of the FEN support.\r\n\r\nThe Solaris group would work with myself and hopefully some others on cross-platform API considerations (rename to, recursive watching, filtering, etc.). If there are bugs in the FEN support, I need to know there are people familiar with FEN that will triage issues and provide fixes. If/when we do a v2 API, I need to know there are people familiar with FEN that will help us move fsnotify forward on all platforms.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I'd like to \"recruit\" small teams for each platform, but Solaris is a good place to start.\r\n"

        "body": "@isaacdavis In the near term I'd like to break fsnotify up into a few packages within the same repository. I've already begun some work in that direction with kqueue, by isolating the syscall wrappers.\r\n\r\nThis would allow someone to `import \"github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify/fen\"` and use it directly if they really want. My idea with the wrapper is to provide a very low-level platform-specific Go-ish API that provides documentation and testing (improving our means of testing fsnotify will be part of this effort). Also, it could provide all the things for the platform, whereas fsnotify is lowest common denominator.\r\n\r\nNot saying this needs to happen before the PR is merged, but letting you know the direction I'm thinking of taking things.\r\n\r\nThe big question is how low-level is very low level. For example, the kqueue API takes file handles, not names of files to watch, so the kqueue wrapper may operate at that low level with very little in the way of amenities.\r\n\r\nPart of my goal with this is to associate ownership to each subpackage. A small team managing each of fen, inotify, kqueue, fsevents -- possibly some people on multiple teams, and everyone participating in the common API design as well."

I'm happy to take ownership of FEN support and get involved in this project!\r\n\r\nRegarding CI: After talking with some others at Joyent, we think the easiest solution would be to set up a Jenkins instance on a VM in the Joyent Public Cloud, and run the build and tests there. This would integrate well with Github. I would be your point of contact for administering this. Does that sound reasonable to you?\r\n\r\nOne other note: I only have the resources to provide _illumos_ support - the build and tests would run on illumos, not Oracle Solaris. illumos diverged from Oracle Solaris in 2010, and there is no guarantee that the two operating systems share a common FEN API.\r\n\r\nIf this all sounds reasonable, let me know and I'll go ahead with addressing the code review and setting up CI.

I have a Jenkins server running at fsnotify-jenkins.englab.joyent.us that is configured to work with this Jenkinsfile - I've tested it with my fork of the repo. In order to integrate Jenkins with Github, the Jenkins server will need to authenticate as a user with write access to this repo. I can set you up a Jenkins account (which should be done anyway) and we can add your credentials, or, alternatively, if I'm given write access to this repo, I can set up auth using my own account. Let me know how best to move forward.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2019-01-07: A third option would be to create a Github user (named e.g. \"fsnotify automation\") for the purpose of automating Jenkins integration. This makes more sense than explicitly linking Jenkins to someone's personal account."

The target path does not include the symlink (assuming the evaluation succeeded), therefore\r\n4.

The core issue is (I believe) that `pathInfo` is overloaded: At the time of registration it captures the resolvent path for a file whose descriptor was registered with kqueue, but at the time of update it is being used to verify the presence of entries in the directory. It can't do both in the presence of symlinks.\r\n\r\nAnother possible solution would be to extend `pathInfo` with some additional data: For example, it could be given a `link string` field which is set to nonempty when the path denotes the target of a link. This is known at the point of registration, and would not interfere with the other existing uses of the struct."

I think if it handled links in the `watchDirectoryFiles` arm as links _qua_ links, rather than resolving them, it would be better. That's a bigger change, so it'll take me a while to test whether it (a) works, and (b) helps."

For most purposes, this is sufficient. In some cases, however, you may need to receive notifications with finer granularity. For example, you might need to monitor only changes made to a single file. For that purpose, the kernel queue (kqueue) notification system is more appropriate.\r\n\r\n> If you are monitoring a large hierarchy of content, you should use file system events instead, however, because kernel queues are somewhat more complex than kernel* events, and can be more resource intensive because of the additional user-kernel communication involved.\r\n\r\n*I assume they meant file system events here.\r\n\r\n"

Then, I've start writing some code that includes this lib to see how it all works out. It all made sense.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know how your editor works, or how file system notification works in general, just stop saying nonesense, especially after others have told you it's the correct behaviour.

        "body": "Allowing the list to be pulled out of the watcher gives a single source of truth to answer what files are being watched and if a certain file is being watched or not. I made this addition because I am working on a backup type program that watches for file changes and allows the config (of what files are being watched) to be hot reloaded. I am using this to then compare what the watcher is watching or not watching based on the config and if a file needs to be removed or added to the watcher. It could be tracked outside of the watcher but that would lead to having two lists (the one in the watcher and the external one) and I figured since the watcher already has the information it would be better to pull it directly."

I'm thinking it would watch any symlinks that lead some end file, and the end file itself.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of files/links and how I imagine the handling:\r\n```\r\n/a/link (to /b/link)\r\n/b/link (to /c/link)\r\n/c/link (to /file)\r\n/file\r\n/d/link (to /other-file)\r\n/other-file\r\n```\r\n`watch(\"/a/link\")` should watch (`/a/link`, `/b/link`, `/c/link`, `/file`)\r\n 1. `/b/link` changes to a a non-sysmlink, then drop the watches for (`/c/link`, `/file`). Report a change to `/a/link`\r\n 2. `/b/link` changes to a link again to `/file`, add a watch for `/file` to the list . Report a change to `/a/link`\r\n 3. `/file` is updated. Report a change to `/a/link`\r\n 4. `/file` is changed to a link to `/d/link`, add a watch to `/d/link` and `/other-file`. Report a change to `/a/link`\r\n\r\nI think any implementation of this high level interface would have some caveats around state changing between the time of the notification and the possibility of changes happening to files before the processing occurs, so getting it done as well as possible and documented in one place would be nice. I'm thinking there may also be issues with portability with regards to renaming.\r\n\r\nI'll try to have a read through the design doc and more of the project and it's competition.\r\n\r\n_P.S. I found this issue after following an issue for https://github.com/banzaicloud/bank-vaults which uses this and wants to watch config file which is commonly a link to a link to a file due to using a projection in kubernetes._"

But I came across the [fsevents](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fsevents) npm package which makes this claim:\r\n> The FSEvents API in MacOS allows applications to register for notifications of changes to a given directory tree.
